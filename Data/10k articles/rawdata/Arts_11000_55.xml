'''''A Dirty Shame''''' is a 2004 American [[Satire|satirical]] [[sex comedy]] film written and directed by [[John Waters]] and starring [[Tracey Ullman]], [[Johnny Knoxville]], [[Selma Blair]], [[Chris Isaak]], [[Suzanne Shepherd]], and [[Mink Stole]].

{{As of|2018}}, this is Waters' most recent directorial effort. He cites the film's poor box office returns as keeping his future projects from being green-lit, though he has indicated that he would be willing to make another film if sufficient funding were secured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/03/interview-john-waters-pink-flamingos-liverpool | title=John Waters: 'Doing the show is an effective anti-Alzheimer's exercise' | work=[[The Guardian]] | publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] | date=November 2, 2013 | accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The people of [[Harford Road]] are firmly divided into two camps: neuters, the [[puritan]]ical residents who despise anything even remotely carnal; and the perverts, a group of [[Sexual addiction|sex addicts]] whose unique [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]es have all been brought to the fore by accidental [[concussion]]s.

Repressed Sylvia Stickles finds herself firmly entrenched in the former camp. One day, after leaving her [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]] daughter Caprice (nicknamed Ursula Udders because of gargantuan breasts and a penchant for [[indecent exposure]] while dancing at a local dive bar) locked up over the garage, under [[house arrest]] "for her own good", Sylvia is smacked on the head by a passing car and meets Ray-Ray Perkins, a local mechanic and self-styled "sex saint" who opens her mind to a whole new world of sensual pleasure, as he and his followers search for the ultimate sex act.

Eventually, through a series of bizarre head knockings, everyone in the Harford Road area of Baltimore becomes a sex addict, as Ray-Ray shoots [[semen]] out of his head, and becomes the messiah of "Let's Go Sexin'!".

==Production==
[[John Waters]] decided to make the film after discovering several sexual slang terms and branches existed on the internet, explaining the groups and terminology found in the film.&lt;ref&gt;DVD Features&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Waters, when he asked the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] what he would need to cut in order for them to give his film an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R rating]], they replied that "after a while, we just stopped taking notes", and if everything they objected to was cut, only ten minutes could be distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video | people = John Waters | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0493459/|title=This Film Is Not Yet Rated | medium = Movie | publisher = Independent Film Channel (IFC) | date = 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They decided to simply release it with an [[NC-17]] rating.

It was shot entirely on-location in [[Baltimore]] on [[Maryland Route 147|Harford Road]] which is prominently featured in the film.

In a featurette that accompanied the film's DVD release, veteran stage actress Suzanne Shepherd recalled that when she was cast as Big Ethel, she was completely unfamiliar with Waters' work, and she had no idea what to expect when she showed up for the first script review. Horrified by what she was reading, she became so distraught that she began to cry. She tried to quit the project, but Waters and her cast mates managed to persuade her to stay.&lt;ref&gt;"All the Dirt on ''A Dirty Shame,''" New Line Home Video, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''A Dirty Shame'' received a mixed response from critics; some have lauded its unashamed vulgarity, while others have lampooned it for the same reason. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 53% based on 117 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 5.5/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dirty_shame |title=A Dirty Shame (2004) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 34 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/a-dirty-shame |title=A Dirty Shame Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more positive reviews came from Kevin Thomas of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', who wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A gross-out pioneer, Waters has always had more on his mind than delirious, sex-crazed silliness. By allowing people to speak freely about their sexual urges and practices with a bluntness that is jaw-droppingly hilarious, Waters has drawn deeply upon comedy's liberating power. The more the sex addicts talk about their hang-ups the more comically harmless they seem, and thus it's all the more absurd for the puritanical to try to punish them for their various pursuits of pleasure.

Waters has always harnessed poor taste to lampoon attempts to limit freedom of expression. This raucously gritty and high-spirited film could scarcely be bluer in terms of the language, but from Waters it comes as a gust of fresh air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/sep/24/entertainment/et-Dirty24 |title=John Waters returns to his 'Dirty' roots |first=Kevin |last=Thomas |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 24, 2004 |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Also enthusiastic was [[Peter Travers]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'':&lt;blockquote&gt;"''A Dirty Shame'' is Waters unleashed, and wicked, kinky fun for anyone except the twits who rated it NC-17...You may even shed a tear when Sylvia bonds with her daughter by confessing, "I'm a cunnilingus bottom." OK, the jokes are hit-and-miss and the plot is nonexistent, but the Waters spirit stays consistently and sweetly twisted. When the cast takes to the streets singing, "Let's go sexin'," you want to cheer them on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/a-dirty-shame-20040914 |title=A Dirty Shame |first=Peter |last=Travers |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=September 14, 2004 |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the other end of the spectrum was [[Roger Ebert]], who gave the film one star out of a possible four:&lt;blockquote&gt;"There is in show biz something known as "a bad laugh." That's the laugh you don't want to get, because it indicates not amusement but incredulity, nervousness or disapproval. John Waters' ''A Dirty Shame'' is the only comedy I can think of that gets more bad laughs than good ones...We go to a Waters film expecting bad taste, but we also expect to laugh, and ''A Dirty Shame'' is monotonous, repetitive and sometimes wildly wrong in what it hopes is funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/a-dirty-shame-2004 |title=A Dirty Shame |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |work=RogerEbert.com |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC |date=September 24, 2004 |accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Box office===
''A Dirty Shame'' opened on September 17, 2004 on one Baltimore screen to $29,384. The next weekend, it expanded to 133 venues, where it grossed $448,914 ($3,375 per screen). It ended its North American run with $1,339,668 (as of November 7, 2004).&lt;ref name="mojo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&amp;id=dirtyshame.htm|title=Box Office Mojo -- Weekly Box Office Results -- A Dirty Shame|publisher=IMDb.com, Inc.| accessdate = July 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overseas, the film earned an additional $574,498 (as of July 14, 2005), making its global box office total come to $1,914,166.&lt;ref name="mojo" /&gt;

==Home media==
{{Refimprove section|date = September 2018}}
There is both a full uncensored version and an edited, R-rated cut sold through [[Blockbuster Inc.|Blockbuster]], [[Wal-Mart]], and [[Best Buy]] as well as [[Target Corporation|Target]] dubbed "''The Neuter Version''". The R-rated version is heavily censored and removes most of the profanities including altered dialogue such as "sex toy". Additionally, a scene in which two characters stand naked in their doorway is replaced by one in which the characters are clothed. In an interview, Waters stated that this version is "essentially for brainless people and 'really weird collectors'."&lt;ref&gt;See the documentary film, ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'', in which Waters discusses many aspects of the difficulties he had with the MPAA rating system.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Netflix]] proclaims to stream the NC-17 version of the film, but for a time, it was actually the censored version. It has since replaced it with the uncensored cut. A heavily censored version aired on [[Logo (TV channel)|LOGO]], a cable channel for gay interest.

Despite several internet sites and even the spine of the DVD stating that it is "The Neuter Version", the Australian release of the film is the NC-17 version&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ezydvd.com.au/DVD/dirty-shame-a/dp/799492/799492|title=Buy Dirty Shame, A on DVD-Video from EzyDVD.com.au|publisher=[[EzyDVD]]|accessdate=April 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with all profanity and nudity intact. It is rated [[Australian Classification Board|R18+]] for "sexual references and adult themes".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1943">'''Agbagli Kossi''' (1935-1991)  was a [[Togo]]lese sculptor, whose work was representative of the West African [[Vodun art]] tradition. He was born in [[Bè]], a district of [[Lomé]], and became an eminent figure among the vodou circles of Togo.&lt;ref name="Chesi1980"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chesi|first=Gert|title=Voodoo: Africa's Secret Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gY7XAAAAMAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Perlinger|isbn=978-3-85399-013-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly noted for his little wooden voodoo figures, painted mostly with pink lacquer, and occasionally white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caacart.com/pigozzi-artist.php?i=Kossi-Agbagli&amp;bio=en&amp;m=68|title= Agbagli Kossi|publisher=Caacart.com|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He produced many examples of statuettes of twins, and children with their mothers, known as ''venavi''.&lt;ref name="MagninSoulillou1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Magnin|first1=André|last2=Soulillou|first2=Jacques|title=Contemporary Art of Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLBPAAAAMAAJ|year=1996|publisher=H.N.

Kossi exhibited at the [[Magiciens de la terre]] exhibition at the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]]  in Paris in 1989 and in 1991 his work was shown at an exhibition in [[Centro Atlántico de Arte Moderno]], in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], Spain. In 2008 his work appeared at the Mami Wata: Arts for Water Spirits in Africa and Its Diasporas showcasing at the [[Fowler Museum]] of [[UCLA]] in Los Angeles. Today, his work is represented in [[The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC)]].

'''Alternative modeling''' is a branch of the [[Model (profession)|modeling]] industry that features models who do not [[Conformity|conform]] to mainstream [[Ideals of Beauty|ideals of beauty.]] Alternative models are often [[niche market|niche]]-specific, with a personal style that represents subcultures like [[goth subculture|goth]], [[Steampunk fashion|steampunk]], and [[fetishism]]. An alternative model may, for example, be [[tattoo]]ed, [[Body piercings|pierced]], or have other [[body modification]]s, have distinctively subcultural hair such as being [[Shaved head|shaved]], dyed a distinctively unnatural color, or styled into a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]] or [[dreadlocks]]. Alternative modeling can be clothed or [[Nude (art)|unclothed]]. 

Alternative modeling was given substantial mainstream media coverage in the last decade, partly through the creation and popularization of community-based alternative modeling paysites, like [[GodsGirls]] and [[SuicideGirls]]. Alternative modeling community sites usually promote their models for their personality as well as for their looks and portfolio.

Examples of alternative models are Jéssica Veneno from Brasil and Dany Divine from London.

==Markets==
Alternative models are often employed to promote niche products, either in shops or online, particular subcultural clothing shops and websites.

'''Antisemitica''' designates, in the fields of [[book collecting]], and [[rare book]] dealing, the collection and distribution of books, pamphlets, serials, posters, and other printed literature, of an [[antisemitic]] nature. It is to be noted that antisemitica does not, generally, designate antisemitic activity, or antisemites themselves. In the [[United States]], the [[freedom of the press]] does not limit the publication or distribution of antisemitic literature, and there are scholarly and historical interests in such material.

'''Antoñita Singla''' (born 1948),&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is a [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[flamenco]] dancer and actress. She often went by the stage name '''Antoñita La Singla''' or simply "La Singla" but sometimes its written as '''Antonia Singla'''.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
She was born as '''Antonia Singla Contreras''' in 1948 in the neighborhood [[Somorrostro de la Barceloneta]], in Barcelona.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A few days after her birth she was in pain so her mother took her to many hospitals in order to see different doctors. Despite the examinations, no accurate medical diagnosis was found. It was thought that the pain was caused by severe [[meningitis]], however, the little girl was left [[deaf]] as a result of the pain she suffered during her first months.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cita web |url= https://elartedevivirelflamenco.com/bailaores206.html|title= ANTOÑITA LA SINGLA|year=2003|access-date= 6 May 2018|editor= El Arte de Vivir el Flamenco|language= spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, she made a partial recovery from her medical condition.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

While she was growing up, La Singla learned to dance rumba, fandango, bulerías and flamenco with considerable skill.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cita web |url= http://maverickmedicinebabe.blogspot.com.es/2012/10/la-singla-antonitas-miraculous-story.html|title= La Singla Antonita's miraculous story|access-date= 6 May 2018|last= Medicine Babe|first= Maverick|date= 30 October 2012|cita=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Singla began to dance by watching her mother clapping, absorbing the rhythm and turning it into a really remarkable dance full of emotions. It is said that she did not speak fluently until the age of 16.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

===Artistic career===
[[File:La Singla 1.JPG|thumb|right|La Singla dancing]]
Singla began her career at the early age of 12, dancing in some taverns in Barcelona. Her mastery of dance took her to the top, arriving to perform at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] in Paris, in Berlin and in Stuttgart, among other cities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} She was known for wearing pants when performing dramatic dancing.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
In 1960, she launched her artistic career to the top by participating in the group project [[Festival Flamenco Gitano]]&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cita web |url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2015/12/23/babelia/1450888812_211989.html |title= El primer Festival Flamenco Gitano|access-date= 6 May 2018|last= Lobatón|first= Fermín|date= 7 January 2016 |language= ES|cita=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which personalities such as [[Paco de Lucía]], [[Camarón de la Isla]], and [[El Faraón]], among others, participated.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} This 1965 event was the brainchild of German organizers of Blues and Gospel festivals, who decided to invest in flamenco, later participating in numerous television programs. In addition, the Festival Flamenco Gitano toured Europe and the American continent. The first performance took place in the German capital, Berlin. It is worth noting the fact that La Singla was more famous internationally than in Spain.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Flamenco|last=Schreiner|first=Claus|last2=Pauly|first2=Reinhard G.|last3=Claus|first3=Madeleine|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|year=1990|isbn=1574670131|location=|pages=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, she performed as an actress and dancer in the film [[Los Tarantos]], directed by [[Francisco Rovira Beleta|Francisco Rovira-Beleta]]. The film is based on a play by Alfredo Mañas and tells the story of the fierce confrontation between two gypsy families in Barcelona: "Los Tarantos" and "Los Zorongos". At a wedding, Rafael, Taranto, meets Juana, La Zoronga. The two young people, wrapped by the magic of the party, swear eternal love with a pact of blood, and after a night of love, they discover with desperation that they belong to the two rival families. Rafael's mother, seduced by the spell of Juana's dance, overcomes the ancestral hatred, but Juana's father refuses to accept the union. Antoñita La Singla participated in the film as 'Sole', one of the dancers of the clan, along with [[Sara Lezana]], Daniel Martín, Antonio Gades, Antonio Prieto, José Manuel Martín, Margarita Lozano, [[Juan Manuel Soriano]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} In addition, thanks to the filming of the movie La Singla was able to meet [[Carmen Amaya]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=farZoyKozikC&amp;source|title=Gypsies and Flamenco: The Emergence of the Art of Flamenco in Andalusia|last=Leblon|first=Bernard|publisher=Univ of Hertfordshire Press|year=2003|isbn=1902806050|location=Great Britain|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom she was compared too. The film, Los Tarantos was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] in 1964 for "Best Foreign Language Film". At present, the film serves as a documentary of the now defunct Somorrostro district.

Another important milestone in the career of Antoñita Singla was her performance in the flamenco club Los Califas, a 1964 flamenco club whose [[tablao]] flamenco was inaugurated on October 15, 1965.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} The club owners heard about her through the artistic manager Antonio Fernández, who assured them that Singla had the blessing of the great [[Salvador Dalí]] and his wife [[Gala Dalí|Gala]] as well as the support of [[Vicente Escudero]]. A few days later she traveled to Madrid ready to debut in "Los Califas".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cita web |url=http://elblogdepacobanegas.es/index.php/mi-archivo/antonita-la-singla/262-antonita-la-singla-3|title= ANTOÑITA LA SINGLA|access-date=6 May 2018|last= Banegas|first= Paco|date=4 April 2018|language=ES|cita=}} &lt;/ref&gt; Obviously, it was not easy to accompany "La Singla", not having the hearing and the speech needed, however she maintained the performance in its entirety. She danced by pure instinct, she did not hear the guitar or the flamenco singer. It was commented that she was going her own way, she was totally independent, and it was the others who had to follow her to give the performance the feeling of unity. This unexpected situation created such a high expectation that the flamenco club ‘’Los Califas’’ was entirely filled with professionals from the flamenco dance community and Singla exceeded all expectations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Legacy ==
Today, Singla lives in [[Santa Coloma de Gramenet]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.elperiodico.cat/ca/barcelona/20170317/la-singla-del-somorrostro-a-lolympia-5906621|title=Del Somorrostro a l'Olympia|last=Merino|first=Olga|date=17 March 2017|access-date=6 May 2018|language=ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Catalonia, Spain far from the tablaos. 

On April 15, 2017, one of the brothers of the artist, Juan José Singla Contreras, and his partner, Santiago Parra, opened  a flamenco tablao&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cita web |url= https://cronicaglobal.elespanol.com/vida/tablao-flamenco-barcelona-singla_69263_102.html|title= El nuevo templo del flamenco en la Cataluña del 'procés'|access-date= |last= Jorro|first= Ignasi|date= 8 March 2017|language= ES|cita=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Barcelona with the name of La Singla to pay tribute. The location of La Singla is located in front of [[La Monumental]] bullring, and it is the first flamenco establishment that opened in the city in 30 years.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Overview==
Arabic cinema is dominated by [[Cinema of Egypt|Egyptian movies]]. Three quarters of all Arab movies are produced in Egypt.

There is increased interest in films originating in the Arab world. For example, films from [[Algeria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Morocco]], the [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Syria]] and [[Tunisia]] are making wider and more frequent rounds than ever before in local film festivals and repertoire theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2501/is_1-2_27/ai_n15694703|title=FindArticles.com {{!}} CBSi|website=findarticles.com|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festivals==
There are numerous film festivals that have historically been and are held in various parts of the Arab world to both honor and showcase films from the Arab regions, as well as international standouts.

Since 1976, [[Cairo]] has held the annual [[Cairo International Film Festival]], which has been accredited by the [[International Federation of Film Producers Associations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukhotmovies.com/film-festivals/cairo-film-festival/information.html Cairo Film Festival information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208183113/http://www.ukhotmovies.com/film-festivals/cairo-film-festival/information.html |date=2011-12-08 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also another festival held in [[Alexandria]]. Of the more than 4,000 short- and feature-length films made in Arabic-speaking countries since 1908, more than three-quarters were Egyptian.

In 1987, the inaugural Mogadishu Pan-African and Arab Film Symposium (Mogpaafis) was held, bringing together an array of prominent filmmakers and movie experts from across the globe, including other parts of Northeast Africa and the Arab world, as well as [[Asia]] and [[Europe]]. Held annually in [[Mogadishu]], the capital of [[Somalia]], the film festival was organized by the [[Somali Film Agency]], the nation's film regulatory body.&lt;ref name="CEC"&gt;Commission of the European Communities, ''The Courier'', Issue 101, (Commission of the European Communities: 1987), p.97&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Film Festival of Marrakech]] (FIFM) is an international [[film festival]] held annually in [[Marrakech]], [[Morocco]]. Since its inaugural year in 2000, the FIFM has been one of the biggest events devoted to [[Cinema of Morocco|Moroccan cinema]]. It is also the site of the [[principal photography]] of many international productions. The festival's jury gathers international writers, actors and personalities, and endeavors to reward the best Moroccan and foreign [[Feature film|feature]] and [[short film]]s. The FIFM is chaired by [[Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco]].

[[File:Dubai-Filmfestival-2010.jpg|thumb|20m wide [[Inflatable movie screen|inflatable projection screen]] at the 2010 [[Dubai International Film Festival]].]]
The [[Dubai International Film Festival]] (DIFF) is an international [[film festival]] based in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. Launched in 2004, it aims to foster the growth of filmmaking in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="DIFFa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaifilmfest.com/index.php/en/about/intro/|title=Dubai International Film Festival|work=Dubai International Film Festival|access-date=2011-05-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525111646/http://www.dubaifilmfest.com/index.php/en/about/intro|archive-date=2011-05-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DIFF is held under the honorary Chairmanship of [[Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum]]. It is a not-for-profit cultural event, presented and organised by the [[Dubai Internet City|Dubai Technology, Electronic Commerce and Media Free Zone Authority]].

The DIFF presents cinematic excellence from around the world and offers a high-profile platform for aspiring home-grown talent. The Muhr Award for Excellence in Arab Cinema was launched in 2006, with the aim of recognizing Arab filmmakers both regionally and internationally. In 2008, the Muhr Awards for Excellence were expanded to include two separate competitions, the Arab Muhr Award, and the AsiaAfrica Muhr Award. It also introduced a new program segment dedicated exclusively to Animation.

The [[Abu Dhabi Film Festival]] (ADFF) is another key international film festival in the larger Arab region. Created in 2007, the ceremony is held annually in October in [[Abu Dhabi]], UAE by the [[Abu Dhabi Authority for Culture and Heritage]] (ADACH), under the patronage of Sheikh Sultan Bin Tahnoon Al Nahyan, Chairman of the ADACH. The ADFF aims to encourage and foster the growth of filmmaking in the [[Arab world]] by showcasing movies from the region alongside standout productions from prominent international filmmakers.&lt;ref name="Adff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/en/about|title=About - Sanad Abu Dhabi Film Fund|work=Abu Dhabi Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first festival debuted with 152 movies and 186 screenings shown in five Abu Dhabi venues. A total of 76 feature films and 34 short films from over 35 countries competed for the Black Pearl Awards.

The [[Doha Tribeca Film Festival]] (DTFF) is an annual five-day [[film festival]] founded in 2009 to promote [[Arab]] and international film, and to develop a sustainable [[film industry]] in [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=412351&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 Article in Gulf Times January 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128162702/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=412351&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=36&amp;parent_id=16 |date=2011-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Festival is one of Qatar's largest entertainment events attracting over 50,000 guests in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dohafilminstitute.com/filmfestival/festival|title=About — Ajyal Youth Film Festival - Doha Film Institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DTFF is the annual film festival of the [[Doha Film Institute]], an organisation founded by [[Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani|H.E. Sheikha Al Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/MEDIA_179834.html|title=Qatar launches new film institute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which implements, consolidates and oversees film initiatives in Qatar.

The 3rd annual DTFF is scheduled to take place from October 25–29, 2011 at Katara Cultural Village, [[Doha]]. Approximately 40 films will screen at the festival, within various themed sections, showcasing World and Middle Eastern Cinema.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/32/18816/Arts--Culture/Film/El-Shouq-to-participate-in-Doha-Tribeca-Film-Festi.aspx|title=El Shouq to participate in Doha Tribeca Film Festival|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support initiatives==
In conjunction with the European Audiovisual Entrepreneurs (EAVE) professional training, networking and project development organization, the Dubai International Film Festival in 2010 also began offering to filmmakers the Interchange group of development and co-production workshops earmarked for directors, screenwriters and producers from the larger Arab region.&lt;ref name="DIFF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dubaifilmfest.com/index.php/en/dubai_film_market/film-forum/interchange/|title=Dubai International Film Festival|work=Dubai International Film Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the Abu Dhabi Film Festival launched the SANAD development and post-production fund for cineastes from the Arab world. With the goal of encouraging independent and [[Auteur theory|auteur]]-based cinema, eligible filmmakers now have access to financial grants, screenwriting and pitch workshops, and personal meetings with industry mentors and experts.&lt;ref name="Afacadff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/sites/default/files/press_releases/PR_AFACSANADLab_En.pdf |format=PDF |title=AFAC and Abu Dhabi Film Festival Partner to Support Arab Documentaries Through the SANAD FilmLab |website=abudhabifilmfestival.ae |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903044458/http://www.abudhabifilmfestival.ae/sites/default/files/press_releases/PR_AFACSANADLab_En.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was founded as Bath School of Art in 1852 following [[The Great Exhibition]] of 1851.&lt;ref name="saatchi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artcolleges/InfoAll/introduction/ac_id/248 | title=Introduction – Bath Spa University | publisher=The Saatchi Gallery | accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bath Directory for 1856 shows its location at Weymouth House (roughly the rear of the present Marks and Spencers store) and its Master as Anthony Carey Stannus, an Irish painter noted for marine scenes and who later helped establish a society which evolved into the [[Royal Ulster Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newulsterbiography.co.uk/index.php/home/viewPerson/1561 |title=Featured person- Anthony Carey Stannus (1830–1919) Artist |publisher=Ulster History Circle-Dictionary of Ulster Biography|accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1858 edition he had been succeeded by John J. Drummond, who by 1860 had set up his own Mr Drummond's School of Art at 3 Bladud Buildings, and later (1862) at 5 Princes Buildings almost opposite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/findbyperiod.asp|title=Post office Bath Directory|date=1864 |work=Page 310 Princes Buildings |publisher=Historical Directories |accessdate=15 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101113155714/http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/findbyperiod.asp| archivedate= 13 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original School moved to Hetling House, Westgate Buildings, an ancient building which [[George Newenham Wright]] in his ''Historic Guide to Bath'' (1864) says had been garrisoned for the Royalists in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]], adding that "the School of Design now occupies the principal and older part".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/findbyperiod.asp|title=Post office Bath Directory|date=1864 |work=Page 831 Hetling Court School of Art |publisher=Historical Directories |accessdate=15 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101113155714/http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/findbyperiod.asp| archivedate= 13 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Master for a few years was John Hill, who later continued as a private tutor and artist at his home in [[Combe Down]] until about 1884. The School's syllabus was "in connection with Marlborough House", which meant the Government School of Design and Practical Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/findbyperiod.asp|title=Post office Bath Directory|date=1864 |work=Page 493 Bath School of Art Master John Hill|publisher=Historical Directories |accessdate=15 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101113155714/http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/findbyperiod.asp| archivedate= 13 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Walcot School and the Star Inn, Vineyards, Bath - geograph.org.uk - 179560.jpg|thumb|right|The Star Inn and Walcot School]]

By 1866 the School was at 33 [[The Paragon, Bath|Paragon]], opposite The Star Inn, and the Master was Robert Campbell Puckett, PhD, whose 1871 work "Sciography, or radial projection of shadows" was published by Chapman &amp; Hall of London. The tuition fee was one guinea per quarter according to the school's prospectus published as a one-page advertisement in the annual Directories. Courses were "in connection with the Science and Art Department, South Kensington". A branch was opened at The Corridor for evening classes. Later Head Masters were [[William Harbutt]] (1874), the inventor of [[Plasticine]], John Charles Swallow (1878), and Charles M. Hodges (1880). By 1884 William Harbutt was teaching at The Paragon Art Studio, 15 Bladud Buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/findbyperiod.asp|title=Post office Bath Directory|date=1884 |work=Page 125 Harbutt William-artist and teacher-The Paragon Art Studio|publisher=Historical Directories |accessdate=15 November 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101113155714/http://www.historicaldirectories.org/hd/findbyperiod.asp| archivedate= 13 November 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1894 the School had come under the umbrella of the [[Bath Technical School]]s&lt;ref&gt;Bath Central Library{{cite book|title=Kelly's Directory|year=1897|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in April 1896 these occupied the new north extension of the Guildhall, including the retitled School of Art, Art Crafts and Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathintime.co.uk/image.php?id=421071&amp;idx=16&amp;fromsearch=true|title=Plan for sites adjoining the Guildhall (Technical Schools) 14 March 1891|work=Central Library Collection|publisher=Bath in Time|accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Head Art Master was Frank Griffin ARCA who had won bronze and silver medals, replaced by Nathaniel Heard ARCA by 1906. By 1912 the Master was Henry Wilkinson ARCA who had been taught by Ruskin and whose son (also Henry) became a well-known engraver. Successors were D.S. (probably Douglas) Andrews ARCA (1920) and Arthur Payne ARCA (1922).

The Technical Schools evolved into the Municipal [[Bath Technical College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bathintime.co.uk/image.php?id=421065&amp;idx=7&amp;fromsearch=true|title=Plan of Technical Schools (first floor) 1932|work=Central Library Collection|publisher=Bath in Time|accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which moved to the building in Beau Street vacated by the Royal United Hospital when it moved to Combe Park.&lt;ref&gt;A potted History of the RUH [http://www.ruh.nhs.uk/about/history.asp?menu_id=1] Retrieved 17 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medical Heritage {{cite web |url=http://www.medicalheritage.co.uk/Bath/RUH.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716182426/http://www.medicalheritage.co.uk/Bath/RUH.htm |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved 17 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The process was overseen by the new head art master, the artist Paul Fripp (1934–37).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/bean95/ft/frippuk/links/rod/paul-fripp-broch.htm | title=Paul Fripp | publisher=The Fripp &amp; Pocock families | accessdate=12 December 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821191535/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/bean95/ft/frippuk/links/rod/paul-fripp-broch.htm | archive-date=21 August 2008 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then came the important appointment of the long serving [[Clifford Ellis]] (1937–1972).&lt;ref name="celebration"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.baacorsham.co.uk/A_Celebration_of_Bath%20Academy_of_Art.pdf | title=A celebration of Bath Academy of Art | last=Pope | first=Derek | publisher=Bath Academy of Art | accessdate=12 December 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110106000626/http://www.baacorsham.co.uk/A_Celebration_of_Bath%20Academy_of_Art.pdf| archivedate= 6 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Art moved to 7 and 8 Green Park early in [[World War II]], when the Beau Street building was taken over by the Admiralty. This new home was totally destroyed by bombs in April 1942, and temporary refuge was found at the home of the artist [[Walter Sickert]] at [[Bathampton]]. Sickert had been a part-time teacher at the School but had died in January 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=412031 | title=Odds and quads | publisher=Times Higher Education | accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clifford Ellis is said to have cut the lettering on Sickert's headstone.
[[File:CorshamCourtFront.jpg|thumb|[[Corsham Court]]]]
In November 1942 the School began its association with 99 Sydney Place. A note in the local history section of Bath Central Library&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/onlinelists/GB0256%20MSS.pdf|title=Bath Central Library|work=National archives NRA 25737|publisher=nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; records the opening of the new premises by Sir Kenneth Clark, then Director of the [[National Gallery]] and Surveyor of the King's Pictures.&lt;ref name="celebration"/&gt; After the war the process began of transforming into Bath Academy of Art-based mainly at [[Corsham Court]], [[Corsham]], and with an initial emphasis on training teachers of art.&lt;ref name="saatchi"/&gt; The nascent City of Bath Training College was first based in another house at Sydney Place before its move to [[Newton Park]], meaning that by 1947 (along with [[Bath College of Domestic Science]] then still at Brougham Hayes) all the major components of the future [[Bath Spa University]] were now in existence.

The 1983/4 prospectus contained a short history stating that from 1946 the Academy ran two courses at Corsham, one for teacher training and the other a National Diploma in Design with a small intake, with interaction between the two being seen as a particular asset. The Robbins report of 1963 led to more standardised teacher training provision, and the Academy's course was phased out by 1968. The introduction of Art Foundation courses from 1963 onwards led the Academy to begin such a course, based at the Sydney Place site which had been retained for part-time classes for the general public. In 1974 control of the institution passed to the new Avon County Council and from 1 September 1983 the Academy became part of Bath College of Higher Education.

In 1985/6 the Art and Design courses, now of bachelor's degree status, began the process of moving from Corsham to newly converted premises at Sion Hill, Bath, largely vacated by the switch of Home Economics and related courses to new premises at Newton Park.

In 2016 [[Bath Spa University]] purchased the former [[Herman Miller (manufacturer)|Herman Miller]] factory on [[Locksbrook Road, on the River Avon in the west of the City of Bath]], a 1970s listed building designed by [[Farrell &amp; Grimshaw]], to become the main home for an expanded and consolidated Bath School of Art and Design.  The School and its courses are to be based across just two buildings, Sion Hill and at Locksbrook Road, rather than up to seven.&lt;ref name=bathchron-20170803&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/news/bath-news/bath-spa-university-eyes-revamp-264743 |title=Bath Spa University eyes revamp of former Herman Miller site for new school of art and design |last=Crawley |first=James |newspaper=Bath Chronicle |date=3 August 2017 |accessdate=6 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NHLE-chapels&gt;{{NHLE |num=1415261 |desc=The Herman Miller Factory |grade=II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
Courses at the School include Graphic Communication, Creative Art, Fine Art, Digital Design, Fashion and Textile Design, Ceramics and MA Design (Interaction Design, Ceramics, Brand Development or Textiles), Master of Fine Art.

The School prides itself on the teaching of traditional techniques, while embracing new technologies, and encouraging co-creation across disciplines.  The new facilities planned from academic year 2019-20 include spaces specifically to encourage such inter-disciplinary creation.

'''Berikaoba''' ({{lang-ka|ბერიკაობა}}) is an improvised [[masquerade ceremony|masqueraded]] folk theatre in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], stemming from the [[paganism|pagan]] festivity of fertility and rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Burney, Charles Allen &amp; [[David Marshall Lang|Lang, David Marshall]] (1972), ''The Peoples of the Hills: Ancient Ararat and Caucasus'', p. 224. Praeger&lt;/ref&gt; The name is derived from a [[Common Kartvelian]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''ber'' (ბერ), meaning "a child". The scenes of Berikaoba range from those of explicitly [[eroticism|erotic]] nature to [[political satire]] and social protest.&lt;ref name="Georgia Today"&gt;Strelkova, Ruso. "Georgia’s pagan carnivals cherish fertility". ''Georgia Today''. April 4, 2008. Retrieved on March 25, 2011 from [http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=774&amp;Itemid=134 ''Georgian Daily''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318072518/http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=774&amp;Itemid=134 |date=March 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice, Timothy; Porter, James &amp; Goertzen, Chris (2000), ''The Garland Encyclopedia of World Music: Europe'', vol. 8, p. 834. Garland Publishing, {{ISBN|0-8240-6034-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Berikaoba typically involves several men, the berika, who are mostly disguised as animals. The costumes and masks for the [[mystery play|mystery]] are made of animal hide. Animal skulls, tails, feathers, horns, [[pumpkin]]s, ribbons and bells are used to add colorfulness to the scene. The festivity begins with a gathering of villagers who chose actors for the mystery. The procession of berikas – accompanied by sounds of [[bagpipes]] ([[gudastviri|stviri]]) – move door-to-door to pick wine, honey, floor, meat and other victuals served by hosts. The main characters in the procession are a "bride" called Kekela (კეკელა) and a groom who, after a series of attempts, persuades Kekela to marry her. The wedding is then disrupted by an appearance of a "[[Tatars|Tatar]]", a reference to the centuries of invasions from neighboring [[Muslim]] powers. The groom is killed and the people console Kekela, promising her a better husband. As berikas try to resuscitate the groom with help of healing water, herbs and minerals, the news spreads about the abduction of Kekela. This brings the groom back to life. He chases the kidnappers and relieves her bride. The performance finishes with a lengthy feast, ''[[Supra (feast)|supra]]''.&lt;ref name="Georgia Today"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abakelia, Nino (2008), [http://www.folklore.ee/Folklore/vol40/abakelia.pdf "The Spaciotemporal Patterns of Georgian Winter Solstice Festivals"]. ''Folklore'' 40: 101-116&lt;/ref&gt; 

The similar tradition, ''keenoba'' (ყეენობა, from "the [[Khan (title)|Khan]]"), satirizing the foreign invaders of Georgia and later the [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russian]] officialdom, enjoyed particular popularity in the 19th-century [[Tbilisi]] and its environs.&lt;ref name="Suny"&gt;[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'', p. 90.

Founded in 1892, '''The Bibliographical Society''' is the senior [[learned society]] dealing with the study of the [[book]] and its [[History of books|history]] in the United Kingdom.

The Society holds a monthly lecture between October and May, usually on the third Tuesday of the month at [[University College London]].

The first fifty years of the Bibliographical Society were documented in the book ''The Bibliographical Society, 1892–1942: Studies in Retrospect''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bibliographical Society, 1892–1942: Studies in Retrospect'' (London, 1949).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Book Encompassed'', a volume of essays marking the Society's centenary was published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Davison, ed., ''The Book Encompassed: Studies in Twentieth-century Bibliography'' (Cambridge, 1992) {{ISBN|978-0-521-41878-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The objectives of the Society are:

* to promote and encourage study and research in the fields of:
**   historical, analytical, descriptive and textual [[bibliography]]

==Library and archives==
The Society's library was housed at [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Hall]] in the [[City of London]] but moved to [[Senate House (University of London)|Senate House]] in January 2007 where it is now available alongside the resources of the [[Senate House Libraries]].

The Society's [[archive]] is housed at the [[Bodleian Library]] and may be used by scholars and members of the Society.

==Publications==
The Society has published a journal since 1893, originally entitled ''Transactions of the Bibliographical Society''. In 1920 it took over publication of ''The Library'' (issued since 1889) and adopted that as the main title of the ''Transactions''. (''The Library'' was founded in 1889 by [[John Young Walker MacAlister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=MacAlister, John Y. W.|journal=Who's Who|year=1916|pages= 1389|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3453981;view=1up;seq=1429}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The different series of the ''Transactions'' and ''The Library'' are:

*''Transactions of the Bibliographical Society'', vol. 1–15 (1893–1919)
*''The Library'', vol. 1–10 (1889–1898)
*''The Library'', Second/New series, vol. 1–10 (1900–1910)
*''The Library'', Third series, vol. 1–10 (1910–1919)
*''The Library'', Fourth series, vol. 1–26 (1920–1946)
*''The Library'', Fifth series, vol. 1–33 (1946–1978)
*''The Library'', Sixth series, vol. 1–21 (1979–1999)
*''The Library'', Seventh series, vol. 1– (2000– )

''The Library'' ({{ISSN|0024-2160}}; {{ISSN search link|1744-8581}}) is a quarterly journal and is issued free to members who also receive a copy of all books published by the Society.

==Gold medal==
The Society occasionally awards a [[gold]] medal for distinguished services to bibliography to individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the development of the subject and the furtherance of the Society's aims.

'''Cheekwood''' is a privately funded {{convert|55|acre|ha|adj=on}} estate on the western edge of [[Nashville, Tennessee]] that houses the '''Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art'''.  Formerly the residence of Nashville's Cheek family, the {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]-style mansion was opened as a museum in 1960.

== History ==
Christopher Cheek founded a wholesale [[grocery]] business in Nashville in the 1880s. His son, Leslie Cheek, joined him as a partner, and by 1915 was president of the family-owned company.  Leslie's wife, Mabel Wood, was a member of a prominent [[Clarksville, Tennessee]], family.  Meanwhile, [[Joel Owsley Cheek]], Leslie's cousin, had developed an acclaimed blend of [[coffee]] that was marketed through Nashville's finest hotel, the [[Maxwell House Hotel]].  Cheek's extended family, including Leslie and Mabel Cheek, were investors. In 1928, the [[Postum]] Cereals Company (now [[General Foods]]) purchased [[Maxwell House]]'s parent company, Cheek-Neal Coffee, for more than $40 million.&lt;ref name=AboutCheekwoodHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cheekwood.org/About.aspx |title=History of Cheekwood |publisher=Cheekwood Botanical Gardens and Museum of Art |accessdate=December 8, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208011001/http://www.cheekwood.org/About.aspx# |archive-date=2013-12-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the sale of the family business, Leslie Cheek bought {{convert|100|acre|ha}} of woodland in West Nashville for a country estate.  He hired [[New York City|New York]] residential and landscape architect [[Bryant Fleming]] to design the house and gardens, and gave him full control over every detail of the project, including interior furnishings.  The resulting [[limestone]] mansion and extensive formal gardens were completed in 1932. The estate design was inspired by the grand [[England|English]] manors of the 18th century.&lt;ref name=AboutCheekwoodHistory/&gt;

Leslie Cheek died just two years after moving into the mansion. Mabel Cheek and their daughter, Huldah Cheek Sharp, lived at Cheekwood until the 1950s, when Huldah Sharp and her husband offered the property as a site for a botanical garden and art museum. The Exchange Club of Nashville, the Horticultural Society of Middle Tennessee and other civic groups led the redevelopment of the property aided by funds raised from the sale of the former building of the defunct Nashville Museum of Art.  The new Cheekwood museum opened in 1960.&lt;ref name=AboutCheekwoodHistory/&gt;

== Art museum ==
Cheekwood's art collection was founded in 1959 upon the holdings of the former [[Nashville Museum of Art]] and is accredited by the [[American Alliance of Museums]]. The core holdings include broad collections of American art; American and British decorative arts; contemporary art, especially outdoor sculpture acquired for the Woodland Sculpture Trail.

Cheekwood's American art collection includes 600 paintings and 5,000 prints, drawings and photographs. The collection, assembled in the 1980s and early 1990s through a multimillion-dollar bequest, spans the history of American art. Its strength centers on [[The Eight (Nyolcak)|The Eight]]. Other strengths include the world's largest collection of sculptures of [[William Edmondson]], photographs by [[Louise Dahl-Wolfe]], and a vast variety of post-[[Second World War]] prints. Recently, the Museum has pursued a consciously focused acquisition process, having added paintings by James Hamilton, [[William Bradford (painter)|William Bradford]], and new contemporary sculpture for the Trail.

The core holdings of the decorative arts collection include the third-largest [[Worcester]] porcelain in the [[United States]], and a 650-piece silver collection, spanning the 18th-20th centuries.

The Cheek Mansion is itself considered part of the collection. A year-long renovation, completed in June 2017, restored much of the original building, which revealed authentic features (wood and marble floors that had been carpeted), and conserved historical architectural motifs, such as the illusionist murals that line the main corridor.

The Contemporary Art collection, housed in the galleries created out of the estate's original garage and stables, is small but of high quality, including paintings by [[Larry Rivers]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Robert Ryman]], [[Red Grooms]], and [[Marylyn Dintenfass]]. Additionally, seven small galleries were created in the old horse stable stalls to enable Cheekwood to display installation art.

The Carrell Woodland Sculpture Trail, a collection of fifteen sculptures by international artists, extends the contemporary art collection into nature, focusing on a kind of intimate, outdoor art not commonly found in American museums.

== Botanical garden ==
[[File:Polemonium reptans 2009.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Creeping Jacob's Ladder]] (''Polemonium reptans'') at Cheekwood Botanical Garden]] 
Extending across the grounds from the Museum of Art, the Botanical Garden encompasses the entire {{convert|55|acre|ha|adj=on}} site with an emphasis on display, education, and study.  The plant collections include [[Buxus|boxwood]], [[conifer]], [[crape myrtle]], [[daffodil]], [[daylily]], [[dogwood]], [[fern]], [[herb]], [[holly]], [[hosta]], [[hydrangea]], [[Japanese maple]], [[magnolia]], Southeastern US natives, [[redbud]], and [[trillium]].

== Other attractions ==
In addition to the Museum and the Botanical Garden, Cheekwood operates a nick-nack  shop, and a restaurant called the Pineapple Room which overlooks the west lawn.

'''Ciné-Asie''' (official name: Ciné-Asie Film Institute) is a Montreal-based, [[non-profit]] Film and Media Company that seeks to explore the unique identity of Asian-Canadian media arts and artists. Its mission is to develop and create cinema that empowers people who are marginalized by [[mass media]] and to introduce the Asian cult and genre films to the wider public. Ciné-Asie is involved in many different projects including film contests, [[exhibitions]] and film screenings at the [[Cinémathèque québécoise]].

In 2008, the company [[Ciné-Asie Creatives]] was established under the umbrella of Ciné-Asie. This division of the company is dedicated to the [[international co-production]] of Canadian and Asian films as well as sales and distribution of films between Canada and Asia. Ciné-Asie Creatives is currently developing a co-production [[feature film]] in cooperation with six Asian directors. In addition, Ciné-Asie Creatives acquired the Canadian distribution rights to the Korean films [[Breathless (2009 film)|Breathless]] by [[Yang Ik-june]] and [[My Dear Enemy]] by [[Lee Yoon-ki]].

== History ==
Founded in 1996 as a registered company, Ciné-Asie started its activities in 1997 with the "Three Korean Master Filmmakers" event in Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver in collaboration with cinémathèques in Canada and the New York Cultural Center. Between 1998 and 2000 Ciné-Asie hosted monthly Asian and Asian-American film screenings and seminars in partnership with the Cinémathèque Québécoise in Montreal. During this time Ciné-Asie also organized Asian film events at the [[Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada]] and published the bilingual monthly local film newsletter "QuiFaitQuoi" on Asian film and filmmakers from Canada and abroad.

In 1999, Ciné-Asie was incorporated and co-organized "Chinese Cinema, 1933-49" together with [[Concordia University (Montreal)|Concordia University]] as part of the Film Society of Lincoln. That same year Ciné Asie organized the "Amérasia International Film and Video Festival" in Montreal and started to host monthly social events for the Asian Film and Video Art Society, a support group of Asian-Canadian artists.

After a six-year break Ciné-Asie resumed its work by programming and coordinating Asian-Canadian film screenings at the Asian Heritage Festival for Access-Asie, a non-profit organization in Montreal. In addition, Ciné-Asie intensified its collaboration with the Cinémathèque Québécoise in Montreal by organizing a retrospective of Korean Films in 2006 and of director [[Hong Sang-soo]]'s films in 2007. In 2008 Ciné-Asie also resumed its monthly Asian-Canadian film screenings presented at the Cinémathèque Québécois.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4668">A '''cultural manager''' ({{lang-es|'''gestor cultural'''}}) is a person who is motivated by the improvement of [[art]], works independently and professionally with knowledge of the subject, and develops work as a mediator between governmental and/or private cultural institutions with artists from different areas to articulate their work in the market with promotion and national and international dissemination.&lt;ref name=uoc&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://gestiocultural.blogs.uoc.edu/2016/06/28/que-es-un-gestor-cultural-gestion-cultural/ |title=¿Qué es un gestor cultural? |trans-title=What is a Cultural Manager? |publisher=[[Open University of Catalonia]] |language=Spanish |date=28 June 2016 |access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural manager works by looking for specific measures of success, always intending to improve the level of culture, seeking active cohesion between society, the governmental sector, the private sector, and the artists. The work of culture management poses learning challenges in diverse areas such as the administration of economic resources, training, and artistic communication.&lt;ref name=uoc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.educaweb.com/profesion/gestor-cultural-334/ |title=Gestor cultural |publisher=Educaweb |language=Spanish |access-date=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''De Mensurabili Musica''''' (concerning measured music) is a musical treatise from the early 13th century (medieval period, c. 1240)  and is the first of two treatises traditionally attributed to French music theorist [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]];&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, Thomas. ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 628&lt;/ref&gt; the other is ''de plana musica'' &lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard. ''The Oxford History of western Music - I (Music from the earliest notations to the 16th Century)'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010) p196/7&lt;/ref&gt; (Concerning Plainchant). ''De Mensurabili Musica'' was the first to explain a modal rhythmic system that was already in use at the time: the [[rhythmic mode]]s.  The six rhythmic modes set out by the treatise are all in [[triple time]] and are made from combinations of the note values [[mensural notation|''longa'' (long) and ''brevis'' (short)]] and are given the names ''[[trochee]], [[Iamb (poetry)|iamb]], [[Dactyl (poetry)|dactyl]], [[anapest]], [[spondaic]]'' and ''[[Tribrach (poetry)|tribrach]]'', although ''trochee, dactyl'' and ''spondaic'' were much more common. It is evident how influential Garlandia's &lt;ref&gt;There has been recent scholarly debate on whether Johannes de Garlandia actually wrote the treatise. Some music historians believe that he was simply editor of the treatises. More information can be found on his Wikipedia page.&lt;/ref&gt; treatise has been by the number of theorists that have used its ideas. Much of the surviving music of the [[Notre Dame School]] from the 13th century is based on the rhythmic modes set out in ''De Mensurabili Musica''.

'''Debbie Bates''' (also '''Tyler''') is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Nicola Duffett]] from 1993 to 1995. She was introduced as a love-interest for [[Nigel Bates]] ([[Paul Bradley (British actor)|Paul Bradley]]), but was killed off in 1995 on Duffett's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20040819/local/british-soap-actress-has-close-ties-to-malta|title=British soap actress has close ties to Malta|publisher=''Times of Malta''|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storylines==
Debbie first appears in [[Walford]] in May 1993 as a friend of [[Tracey (EastEnders)|Tracey the barmaid]] ([[Jane Slaughter (actress)|Jane Slaughter]]). She becomes a [[Romantic interest|love interest]] for [[Nigel Bates]] ([[Paul Bradley (British actor)|Paul Bradley]]) when she meets him at his birthday party. Debbie and her daughter [[Clare Bates|Clare]] ([[Gemma Bissix]]) move nearby to escape Debbie's former ex-husband [[Liam Tyler]] ([[Francis Magee]]), who has been abusing her. Liam eventually tracks Debbie down and makes several attempts to break up Nigel and Debbie but is unsuccessful, and Debbie and Clare both move to Walford to live with Nigel.

In July 1994, Debbie marries Nigel and they are content in marriage. She starts working at the local bookmakers but her boss, Stan Dougan (Jack Chissick), constantly tries to flirt with her, which she dislikes. She keeps this a secret from Nigel but when Stan makes a move on her she quickly rejects him and quits her job. Nigel is suspicious of Debbie suddenly quitting but eventually finds out Stan has been harassing her, so he punches Stan.

Tragedy strikes soon after when Debbie is killed in a hit-and-run accident in June 1995. Police tell Nigel that she walked out into a road and someone hit her at speed, killing her instantly. Debbie's death devastates Nigel and Clare for some time. Nigel goes on to adopt Clare after Liam returns and is unsuccessful in his attempt to gain custody of her. On the 13th anniversary of Debbie's death in 2008, Clare and [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) visit her grave.

==Creation and development==
Debbie was introduced in 1993 by executive producer [[Leonard Lewis]] as a love-interest for [[Nigel Bates]] ([[Paul Bradley (British actor)|Paul Bradley]]).&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debbie's actress Duffett has described Debbie as "nice, unassuming and shy", which she claims was in stark contrast to her own personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orange.co.uk/entertainment/television/pics/3768_2.htm?linkfrom=%3C!--linkfromvariable--%3E&amp;link=link_next&amp;article=besteversoapcomebacks|title=When the soap bubble burst|publisher=''Orange.co.uk''|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debbie's introduction storyline stemmed around a storyline focusing on spousal abuse, when it was revealed that Debbie was being abused by her estranged husband [[Liam Tyler]] ([[Francis Magee]]). Nigel and Debbie's eventual marriage was the focus of ''EastEnders''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; celebratory episode on 12 July 1994, which marked the show's 1000th episode. ''EastEnders''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; writer [[Colin Brake]] has selected it as 1994's episode of the year.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Off-screen the show's Series Producer [[Barbara Emile]] decided to mark the 1000th episode with a celebration and the wedding of Nigel and Debbie was chosen as the event. It was scripted to be a happy occasion in the soap, with Debbie and Nigel's ceremony going ahead despite threats of intrusion from Liam.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

Duffett grew weary of playing Debbie saying she became too boring and drippy, and asked the producers of ''EastEnders'' to kill her character off in 1995, which they did; Debbie was killed in a hit-and-run motor accident.&lt;ref name="email"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/You've+got+m%40il%3a+Nicola+Duffett%3b+Answers+all+your+e-mails.-a092753749|title=Nicola Duffett; Answers all your e-mails|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|location=[[London]]|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffett has commented, "I left ''EastEnders'' of my own accord, without a shadow of a doubt. I begged to be killed. I ran to the script editor's office. Every time I see him at a party he says, 'I'll never forget you.' Because I ran in crying, 'Kill me NOW! I can't stand it.' Because the part was so boring. I played this simpering wimp, Debbie. All I did was walk into the Vic and say, 'Where's Nigel?'"&lt;ref name="int"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Real+Real+Me%3a+Nicola+Duffett+-+I+don't+worry+how+I+look..I've+got...-a072493889|title=The Real Real Me: Nicola Duffett |work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|location=[[London]]|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duffett has stated that she has no regrets about leaving the role,&lt;ref name="email"/&gt; and that she wanted her character killed so she had no opportunity to ever return as she worried about being typecast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/From+champagne+and+oysters+to+stew+and+lemonade...my+EastEnders+high...-a061147552|title=From champagne and oysters to stew and lemonade...my EastEnders high life has gone West.|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|location=[[London]]|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[theatre of ancient Greece]], the '''''eirôn''''' ({{lang-grc|εἴρων}}) was one of three [[stock characters]] in [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1993, 23) and Janko (1987, 45, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; The ''eirôn'' usually succeeded in bringing down his braggart opponent (the ''[[Alazon|alazôn]]'') by understating his own abilities.&lt;ref name="eiron1"&gt;Frye (1957, 172).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The ''eirôn'' developed in [[Classical Greece|Greek]] [[Old Comedy]] and can be found in many of [[Aristophanes]]' plays. For example, in ''[[The Frogs]]'' after the God [[Dionysus]] claims to have sunk 12 or 13 enemy ships with [[Cleisthenes (son of Sibyrtius)]], his slave [[Xanthias]] says 'Then I woke up.'

The [[Greek philosophy|philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] names the ''eirôn'' in his ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'', where he says: "in the form of understatement, self-deprecation, and its possessor the self-deprecator" (1108a12).&lt;ref name="eiron2"&gt;'ἡ δ' ἐπὶ τὸ ἔλαττον εἰρωνεία καὶ '''εἴρων''' (1108a12, emphasis added); Perseus Digital Library (2006). [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Nic.+Eth.+1108a+1 Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics].&lt;/ref&gt; In this passage, Aristotle establishes the ''eirôn'' as one of the main characters of comedy, along with the ''alazôn''.

===Irony===
The modern term [[irony]] is derived from the ''eirôn'' of the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical Greek theatre]]. Irony entails opposition (not mere difference) between the actual meaning and the apparent meaning of something.&lt;ref name="eiron3"&gt;Dictionary.com (2006). [http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=irony Irony]&lt;/ref&gt;

Craft graduated from [[Columbia University|Columbia College]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review of Bass Ackwards and Belly Up by Elizabeth Craft '93 and Sarah Fain|url=http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct_archive/jan_feb07/bookshelf1.php|publisher=Columbia College Today|accessdate=June 22, 2017|date=January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craft is married to producer [[Adam Fierro]] and is the sister of writer [[Gretchen Rubin]].

==Works==
=== ''Angel'' ===

Craft and Fain joined [[Mutant Enemy Productions]] in 2002, during the [[List of Angel episodes#Season 4 .282002 - 2003.29|fourth season]] of [[Joss Whedon|Joss Whedon's]] ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. They penned 8 episodes of seasons 4 and 5 and served as the show's executive [[story editor]]s during its fifth season.

=== ''The Shield'' ===

After ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' went off air in 2004, Craft and Fain joined the staff of ''[[The Shield]]'' as co-producers of the show's [[List of The Shield episodes#Season 4: 2005|fourth season]]. They eventually became producers of the fifth, and supervising producers of the sixth season, also writing several episodes during this time.

=== ''Women's Murder Club'' ===

In 2007, Craft and Fain created ''[[Women's Murder Club (TV series)|Women's Murder Club]]'', a police procedural drama produced by [[20th Century Fox Television]] and airing on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. The show premiered on October 12, 2007 and had Craft and Fain also serving as its executive producers. After producing the first ten episodes, the show went on hiatus due to the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], and Craft and Fain were subsequently fired from the project.&lt;ref name="dollhousetvforum.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dollhousetvforum.com/showpost.php?p=1313&amp;postcount=1 |title=Elizabeth Craft and Sarah Fain answer our questions..... |accessdate=2008-05-09 |date=2008-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219130031/http://www.dollhousetvforum.com/showpost.php?p=1313&amp;postcount=1 |archivedate=2009-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are therefore not involved in the final three episodes of ''Women's Murder Club''.

=== ''Dollhouse'' ===

In 2008, Craft and Fain returned to working with Joss Whedon on his new and upcoming series ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'' as [[showrunner]]s.&lt;ref name="EW Party Is TV Fan Heaven"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.eonline.com/gossip/kristin/detail/index.jsp?uuid=b77ff420-3cc1-4076-b078-2d9ac0adcab8 |title=EW Party Is TV Fan Heaven |accessdate=2005-05-15 |date=2005-05-14 |authorlink=Kristin Dos Santos |author2=Jennifer Godwin |first=Kristin |last=Dos Santos |work=Watch with Kristin |publisher=[[E!

=== ''Lie To Me'' ===

When the cancellation of ''Dollhouse'' was announced, Fox moved Craft and Fain to the writing staff of the new TV series ''[[Lie to Me (TV series)|Lie to Me]]'', which surprised Joss Whedon fans. Craft and Fain were under contract to Fox, not Whedon, and they explained that it was a decision by their employers in which they had little say.&lt;ref name="whedon-info"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.whedon.info/Elizabeth-Craft-Sarah-Fain-Lie-to.html |title=Elizabeth Craft &amp; Sarah Fain - "Lie to Me" Tv Series - Kansascity.com Interview |accessdate = 2009-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Secret Circle'' ===
Craft and Fain in 2010 developed a series with [[Kevin Williamson (screenwriter)|Kevin Williamson]] for [[The CW Television Network|The CW]] based upon [[The Secret Circle]] book trilogy by [[L. J. Smith (author)|L. J. Smith]].  Screenwriter Andrew Miller is penning the pilot.  Secret Circle follows a 16-year-old teenage girl named Cassie, who moves to New Salem and enrolls in a high school there but she soon discovers that she and the other students are witches.&lt;ref&gt;http://hollywoodcrush.mtv.com/2010/10/21/lj-smith-secret-circle-vampire-diaries/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Novels ==
The duo have written two novels, ''[[Bass Ackwards and Belly Up]]'' and its sequel ''Footfree and Fancyloose.'' They follow 9 months in the life of four teenage best friends, Harper, Becca, Kate, and Sophie.

== ''Happier in Hollywood'' podcast ==
On her weekly podcast ''Happier with Gretchen Rubin'', Elizabeth Craft discusses good habits and happiness with her New York-based sister, [[Gretchen Rubin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schawbel |first=Dan |date=March 17, 2015 |title=Gretchen Rubin: How To Create Healthy Workplace Habits |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danschawbel/2015/03/17/gretchen-rubin-how-to-create-healthy-workplace-habits/ |newspaper=[[Forbes]] |location= |access-date=2015-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elizabeth and Sarah started their own spinoff of the podcast, titled "Happier in Hollywood," in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://happierinhollywood.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''English Folk Dance and Song Society''' ('''EFDSS''', or pronounced 'EFF-diss'&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVTMoN4Arvo Challenges of Designing the Roud Folk Song Index], Library of Congress, YouTube, 9:00&lt;/ref&gt;) was formed in 1932 when two organisations merged: the Folk-Song Society and the English Folk Dance Society.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;[[Karpeles, Maud]] and Frogley, Alain (2007–2011). [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/08822 'English Folk Dance and Song Society']. In: ''[[Grove Music Online]]'', [[Oxford Music Online]]. Retrieved 24 October 2011. {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The EFDSS, a member-based organisation, was incorporated as a [[company]] limited by guarantee (no. 297142) in 1935 and became a [[Charitable organization#Charity registration|registered charity]] (no. 305999) in England and Wales in 1963.

The Folk-Song Society, founded in London in 1898,&lt;ref&gt;Keel, Frederick (1948). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4521287 'The folk song society' (1898–1948)].

Retrieved 23 October 2011  {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt; focused on collecting and publishing, primarily folk songs of Britain and Ireland although there was no formal limitation.  Participants included [[Lucy Broadwood]], [[Kate Lee (English singer)|Kate Lee]], [[Cecil Sharp]], [[Percy Grainger]], [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[George Butterworth]], [[George Barnet Gardiner]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.efdss.org/cgi-bin/textpage.cgi?file=aboutGardiner |title=G.

The English Folk Dance Society was founded in 1911 by [[Cecil Sharp]]. [[Maud Karpeles]] was a leading participant.  Its purpose was to preserve and promote [[English country dances|English folk dances]] in their traditional forms, including [[Morris dance|Morris]] and [[sword dances]], traditional [[social dances]], and interpretations of the dances published by [[John Playford]].

One of the greatest contributions that the EFDSS made to the folk movement, both dance and song, was the folk festival, starting with the [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] Festival in the 1940s and later festivals in [[Whitby]], [[Sidmouth Festival|Sidmouth]], [[Holmfirth]], [[Chippenham]] and elsewhere.

==Publications==
Since 1936 the EFDSS has published ''English Dance &amp; Song'' at least four times a year. This has become the longest-established magazine devoted to folk music, dance and song in the country. ''English Dance &amp; Song'' is aimed at stimulating the interest of the membership of the EFDSS, as well as the wider folk music and dance community.

Their regular scholarly publication is ''Folk Music Journal'', published annually in December, which was formerly entitled the ''Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society'' until 1965. The work continues the earlier journals of the two societies: ''Journal of the Folk-Song Society'', 1899–1931;&lt;ref&gt;Dean-Smith, Margaret (1951). [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4521357 'The Preservation of English Folk Song in the Journal of the Folk Song Society']. ''Journal of the English Folk Dance and Song Society'', vol 6, no 3 (December), pp 69–76. Retrieved 24 October 2011 {{subscription}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Journal of the English Folk Dance Society 191431''.

==Recent developments==
[[Image:Cecil Sharp House-1.jpg|thumb|Cecil Sharp House in Regent's Park, London, is home to the English Folk Dance and Song Society]]

In 1998, with the folk movement strongly supported by a number of other organisations and the seeds planted by EFDSS thriving, the EFDSS altered its strategy to focus on education and archiving, with its primary goal the development of the [[Vaughan Williams Memorial Library]] as the country's national archive and resource centre for folk music, dance and song. 

In 2011 the society entered into a joint commission with [[Shrewsbury Folk Festival]] to create the [[Cecil Sharp Project]], a multi-artist residential commission to create new works based on the life and collecting of [[Cecil Sharp]].  The project took place in March 2011, the artists involved being: [[Steve Knightley]], [[Andy Cutting]], [[Leonard Podolak]], [[Jim Moray]], [[Jackie Oates]], [[Caroline Herring]], [[Kathryn Roberts]] and Patsy Reid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cecil Sharp Project |url=https://www.efdss.org/efdss-artists-development/commissions/cecil-sharp-project |website=English Folk Dance and Song Society |accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, EFDSS launched [[The Full English (folk music archive)|The Full English]], an ongoing archive project supported by the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]], [[The Folklore Society]], the National Folk Music Fund and the English Miscellany Folk Dance Group. This free and searchable resource of 44,000 records and over 58,000 digitised images is the world's biggest digital archive of traditional music and dance tunes.&lt;ref name="archive launch"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chilton|first=Martin|title='Staggering' digital folk music archive launched|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/10134011/Staggering-digital-folk-music-archive-launched.html|accessdate=26 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as folk music, the EFDSS is home to a number of performance artists, providing a regular performance platform for acts including the [[Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain]], the [[Massive Violins]] and the [[The Swingle Singers|Swingle Singers]].

Translations are ordered chronologically  by date of first publication, with first lines often provided to illustrate the style of the translation.

Not all translators translated both the ''Iliad'' and ''Odyssey''; in addition to the complete translations listed here are numerous partial translations, ranging from several lines to complete books, which have appeared in a variety of publications.

The "original" text cited below is that of "the Oxford Homer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first=David B. | editor1-last=Monro | title=Homeri Opera | volume=I&amp;II Iliadis Libros ...

His own and comrades’ lives and safe return, 
Yet them he rescued not, howe’er desirous;
For by their own blind folly they all perished:
Fools that they were! to eat the Sun-god’s herds;
So, Hyperion, he who Walks above,
Bereft them of their day of home-return!
Whereof, from whatsoever source, O goddess,

On ocean-waves, his life he carried off
A prize from perils rescued, and would fain
Have homeward led his brethren in arms;
But, not to him,—not to his anxious zeal
Was giv’n their rescue; destin’d as they were
In their mad arrogance to perish; fools!
That dared to seize, and to consume for food,
Hyperion’s herds, the oxen of the Sun
That walks on high, by whose behest the day
Of their return was evermore denied.
And thou, too, goddess daughter of great Jove,
The theme pursue, and thine own record bear!&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{hidden end}}

and learned the minds of many distant men,
and weathered many bitter nights and days
in his deep heart at sea, while he fought only
to save his life, to bring his shipmates home.     
But not by will nor valor could he save them,
for their own recklessness destroyed them all--
children and fools, they killed and feasted on
the cattle of Lord Hêlios, the Sun,
and he who moves all day through heaven
took from their eyes the dawn of their return.
Of these adventures, Muse, daughter of Zeus,
tell us in our time, lift up great song again.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{hidden end}}

of that man of many devices&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{hidden begin|toggle=left}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
who wandered much
once he'd sacked the sacred citadel of Troy.
He saw the cities of many men
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;  and knew their minds,
suffering many sorrows
in order to win back his life-soul
and the return of his companions.
In the end he failed to save them,
in spite of his longing to do so,
for through their own heedlessness they perished.
Fools--who ate the cows of Helios-Hyperion,
and the day of their return was taken from them.
Of these matters, goddess, daughter of Zeus, speak through us
beginning wherever you will.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{hidden end}}

| &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;Sing to me, Muse, of that endlessly cunning man
who was blown off course to the ends of the earth, in the years
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
{{hidden begin|toggle=left}}&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;after he plundered Troy. He passed through the cities
of many people and learned how they thought, and he suffered
many bitter hardships upon the high seas
as he tried to save his own life and bring his companions
back to their home. But however bravely he struggled,
he could not rescue them, fools that they were—their own
recklessness brought disaster upon them all;
they slaughtered and ate the cattle of Hélios,
so the sun god destroyed them and blotted out their homecoming.
Goddess, daughter of Zeus, begin now, wherever
you wish to, and tell the story again, for us.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{hidden end}}

far after he had sacked the sacred city of Troy. He saw

He suffered many pains on the sea in his spirit, seeking
to save his life and the homecoming of his companions.
But even so he could not save his companions, though he wanted to,
for they perished of their own folly—the fools! They ate
the cattle of Helios Hyperion, who took from them the day
of their return. Of these matters, beginning where you want,
O daughter of Zeus, tell to us.&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{hidden end}}

{{Expand Portuguese|Forte de Nossa Senhora da Conceição de Ormuz|date=December 2015}}
{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2012}}
{{Refimprove|date=August 2010}}

The '''Fort of Our Lady of the Conception''', also known as the '''Portuguese Castle''', is a red stone fortress on [[Hormuz Island]], Iran. It is one of the last surviving monuments of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Portuguese Empire|colonial rule]] in the [[Persian Gulf]].
Ormuz (or Hormuz) was an important maritime city and a small kingdom near the entrance to the Persian Gulf. The original site of the city was on the north shore of the Gulf, about 30 miles east of the current Bandar Abbas. Around 1300, apparently in response to attacks from the Tartars, it moved to the small island of Gerun, which can be identified as the Organa of Nearcho, about 12 miles west and 5 miles from the coast. 

Constructed on reddish stone on a rocky promontory at the far north of the island, the castle was originally cut off from the rest of the island by a [[moat]], traces of which still remain. Although most of the roof caved in long ago, much of the lower part of the very substantial outer walls is intact, with the remains lying on different levels of the site.

==History==
{{Main|Capture of Ormuz (1507)|Capture of Ormuz (1622)}}

The building of the castle was ordered by Portuguese commander [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] in 1507, when his forces seized the island for a short time, being then named "Fort of Our Lady of Victory" (''Forte de Nossa Senhora da Vitória''). Engaging his men of all ranks in the building works, Albuquerque faced a revolt and had to retreat. He came back and reconquered the island in 1515, when he completed and renamed the fort. The Persian [[Safavid]] king, [[Abbas I of Persia]] (1587–1629), wanted to end Portuguese rule in the south and eventually managed to convince the [[British East India Company]] to allow its ships to cooperate with his land forces to seize the island from the Portuguese in 1622.

==Other Portuguese castles==
A number of other Portuguese castles are found in the [[Persian Gulf]] islands, including the castle in [[Qeshm]].

During the [[Philippine Dynasty|Habsburg Dynasty]] (1581–1640), the Portuguese built a fortress in [[Dibba Al-Hisn]] and a wall around the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colonialvoyage.com/persfortdoba.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225190235/http://www.colonialvoyage.com/persfortdoba.html |archivedate=December 25, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1648, the Arabs besieged [[Muscat, Oman]], and on 31 October 1648 a treaty was signed between the two opponents.

Nine months pregnant and due any day, Doris Bolton finally marries Walter Owen, a photographer who wants nothing to do with conformity or "the establishment." They want a natural childbirth, at home, with no doctors or drugs.

Her father, ad man Jim Bolton, flies to New York to be by her side. A liberal, Jim believes his daughter is risking her life and the baby's by defying convention. He asks obstetrician friend Stan to assist at the last minute, against Walter's wishes, but when everyone comes out of the childbirth all right, Jim and his son-in-law reach an accord.

In literature, the [[Epic poetry|epic]] was considered the highest form, for the reason expressed by [[Samuel Johnson]] in his ''Life of [[John Milton]]'': "By the general consent of criticks, the first praise of genius is due to the writer of an epick poem, as it requires an assemblage of all the powers which are singly sufficient for other compositions."  Below that came [[lyric poetry]], and comic poetry, with a similar ranking for [[drama]]. The [[novel]] took a long time to establish a firm place in the hierarchy, doing so only as belief in any systematic hierarchy of forms expired in the 19th century.

In music, settings of words were accorded a higher status than merely instrumental works, at least until the [[Baroque]] period, and [[opera]] retained a superior status for much longer.  The status of works also varies with the number of players and singers involved, with those for large forces, which are certainly more difficult to write and more expensive to perform, given higher status. Any element of comedy reduced the status of a work, though, as in other art forms, often increasing its popularity.

The hierarchies in figurative art are those initially formulated for painting in 16th-century Italy, which held sway with little alteration until the early 19th century.  These were formalized and promoted by the [[Academy|academies]] in Europe between the 17th century and the modern era, of which the most influential became the French [[Académie de peinture et de sculpture]], which held a central role in [[Academic art]].  The fully developed hierarchy distinguished between:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Belton|first1=Dr. Robert J.|title=Art History: A Preliminary Handbook|chapter=The Elements of Art|date=1996|chapter-url=http://fccs.ok.ubc.ca/about/links/resources/arthistory/elements.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[History painting]], including historically important, religious, mythological, or allegorical subjects
*[[Portrait painting]]
*[[Genre works|Genre painting]] or scenes of everyday life
*[[landscape art|Landscape]] and cityscape art (landscapists were called "common [[infantry|footmen]] in the Army of Art" by the Dutch theorist [[Samuel van Hoogstraten]])
*[[Animal painting]]
*[[Still life]]

The hierarchy was based on a distinction between art that made an intellectual effort to "render visible the universal essence of things" (''imitare'' in Italian) and that which merely consisted of "mechanical copying of particular appearances" (''ritrarre'').&lt;ref&gt;Bass, 36 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6TSDvkud168C&amp;pg=PA36&amp;dq=Hierarchy+of+genres+painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Idealism]] was privileged over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] in line with [[Renaissance Neo-Platonist]] philosophy.

The term is mostly used within the field of painting, and from the [[High Renaissance]] onwards, by which time painting had asserted itself as the highest form of art.  This had not been the case in [[Medieval art]] and the art-commissioning sectors of society took a considerable period to fully accept this view.  The [[Raphael Cartoons]] are a clear example of the continuing status of [[tapestry]], the most expensive form of art in the 16th century.  In the Early Medieval period lavish pieces of metalwork had typically been the most highly regarded, and valuable materials remained an important ingredient in the appreciation of art until at least the 17th century.  Until the 19th century the most extravagant [[objets d'art]] remained more expensive, both new and on the art market, than all but a few paintings.  Classical writings which valued the supreme skills of individual artists were influential, as well as developments in art which allowed the Renaissance artist to demonstrate their skill and invention to a greater degree than was usually possible in the Middle Ages.

==Renaissance art==
The hierarchy grew out of the struggle  to gain acceptance of painting as one of the [[Liberal arts]], and then controversies to establish an equal or superior status within them with [[architecture]] and [[sculpture]].  These matters were considered of great importance by artist-theorists such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Giorgio Vasari]].  Against the sculptors, Leonardo argued that the intellectual effort necessary to create an illusion of three-dimensionality made the painters' art superior to that of the sculptor, who could do so merely by recording appearances.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 28, 53-4&lt;/ref&gt;  In his ''[[De Pictura]]'' ("About Painting") of 1441, Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer.  He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 11-12,&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists of the Early and High Renaissance accepted the importance of representing nature closely, at least until the later writings of [[Michelangelo]], who was strongly influenced by [[neoplatonism]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 61, 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;  By the time of [[Mannerist]] theorists such as [[Gian Paolo Lomazzo]] and [[Federico Zuccari]] (both also painters) this was far less of a priority.  Both emphasized beauty as "something which was directly infused into the mind of man from the mind of God, and existed there independent of any sense-impressions", a view bound to further reduce the status of works depending on realism.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 140-141 (quote, 141)&lt;/ref&gt;  In practice the hierarchy represented little break with either medieval and classical thought, except to place secular history painting in the same class as religious art, and to distinguish (not always clearly) between static iconic religious subjects and narrative figure scenes, giving the latter a higher status.  Ideas of [[decorum]] also fed into the hierarchy; comic, sordid or merely frivolous subjects or treatment ranked lower than elevated and moral ones.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

During the Renaissance landscape, genre scenes and still lifes hardly existed as established genres, so discussion of the status or importance of different types of painting was mainly concerned with history subjects as against portraits, initially small and unpretentious, and iconic portrait-type religious and mythological subjects.  For most artists some commitment to realism was necessary in a portrait; few could take the high-handed approach of Michelangelo, who largely ignored the actual appearance of the [[Medici]] in his [[Medici Chapel]] sculptures, supposedly saying that in a thousand years no one would know the difference (a retort [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] is also said to have used, with a shorter timeframe).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  

Many portraits were extremely flattering, which could be justified by an appeal to idealism as well as the sitter's vanity; the theorist [[Giovanni Battista Armenini|Armenini]]&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Battista Armenini (1533-1609) ''De vera precetti della pittura'' (1587), " On the True Precepts of the Art of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; claimed in 1587 that "portraits by excellent artists are considered to be painted with better style [''maniera''] and greater perfection than others, but more often than not they are less good likenesses".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 23-24 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, numbers of courtly sitters and their parents, suitors or courtiers complained that painters entirely failed to do justice to the reality of the sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, 38-9&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of decorum in religious art became the focus of intense effort by the Catholic Church after the [[Art in Roman Catholicism#Council of Trent|decrees on art of the Council of Trent]] of 1563.  Paintings depicting biblical events as if they were occurring in the households of wealthy contemporary Italians were attacked, and soon ceased.  Until the challenge of [[Caravaggio]] at the end of the century, religious art became thoroughly ideal.{{Citation needed|date = May 2018}}

==17th and 18th century art==
The new genres of landscape, genre painting, animal painting and still life came into their own in the 17th century, with the virtual cessation of religious painting in Protestant countries, and the expansion of picture buying to the prosperous middle class.  Although similar developments occurred in all advanced European countries, they were most evident in the enormously productive schools of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]].  However no theorists emerged to champion the new genres, and the relatively small amount of Dutch theoretical writing, by [[Karel van Mander]], [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inleyding tot de Hooge Schoole der Schilderkonst'' ( Rotterdam 1678), "Introduction to the Academy of Painting".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard de Lairesse]] and others, was mostly content to rehash Italian views, so that their writings can seem oddly at variance with the Dutch art actually being produced in their day.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 103-104&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchy was mostly accepted by artists, and even genre specialists such as [[Jan Steen]], [[Karel Dujardin]] and [[Vermeer]] produced a few history paintings, which were better paid when commissions could be obtained, but in general far harder to sell.  The unhappy history of [[Rembrandt]]'s last history commission, ''[[The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis]]'' (1661) illustrates both his commitment to the form and the difficulties he had in finding an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Fuchs, 69-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In Flanders, as well as great quantities of pure genre works, there was a trend towards history paintings with a major genre element, whether animals, landscape or still life.  Often the different elements were painted by different artists; [[Rubens]] and [[Frans Snyders]] often co-operated in this way.

The size of paintings, and very often the prices they realized, increasingly tended to reflect their position in the hierarchy in this period. Until the Romantic period the price and saleability of what were essentially landscapes could be increased by adding small mythological or religious figures, creating a ''landscape with...'', a practice that went back to the beginnings of landscape painting in the Flemish [[world landscape]]s of [[Joachim Patinir]] in the early 16th century. [[Flemish Baroque painting]] was the last school to often paint the lowest genres at a large size, but usually combined with figure subjects.

An influential formulation of 1667 by [[André Félibien]], a historiographer, architect and theoretician of French classicism became the classic statement of the theory for the 18th century:&lt;blockquote&gt;Celui qui fait parfaitement des païsages est au-dessus d'un autre qui ne fait que des fruits, des fleurs ou des coquilles. Celui qui peint des animaux vivants est plus estimable que ceux qui ne représentent que des choses mortes &amp; sans mouvement ; &amp; comme la figure de l'homme est le plus parfait ouvrage de Dieu sur la Terre, il est certain aussi que celui qui se rend l'imitateur de Dieu en peignant des figures humaines, est beaucoup plus excellent que tous les autres ... un Peintre qui ne fait que des portraits, n'a pas encore cette haute perfection de l'Art, &amp; ne peut prétendre à l'honneur que reçoivent les plus sçavans. Il faut pour cela passer d'une seule figure à la représentation de plusieurs ensemble ; il faut traiter l'histoire &amp; la fable ; il faut représenter de grandes actions comme les historiens, ou des sujets agréables comme les Poëtes ; &amp; montant encore plus haut, il faut par des compositions allégoriques, sçavoir couvrir sous le voile de la fable les vertus des grands hommes, &amp; les mystères les plus relevez.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jl8IAeoj-7IC&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;pg=PA97#v=onepage&amp;q=Hierarchy%20of%20genres%20painting&amp;f=false Books.google.co.uk], translation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;He who produces perfect landscapes is above another who only produces fruit, flowers or seashells. He who paints living animals is more estimable than those who only represent dead things without movement, and as man is the most perfect work of God on the earth, it is also certain that he who becomes an imitator of God in representing human figures, is much more excellent than all the others ... a painter who only does portraits still does not have the highest perfection of his art, and cannot expect the honour due to the most skilled.  For that he must pass from representing a single figure to several together; history and myth must be depicted; great events must be represented as by historians, or like the poets, subjects that will please, and climbing still higher, he must have the skill to cover under the veil of myth the virtues of great men in allegories, and the mysteries they reveal".&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Allegorical painting was raised above other types of [[history painting]]; together they were the ''grand genre'', including paintings with religious, mythological, historical, literary, or allegorical subjects—they embodied some interpretation of life or conveyed a moral or intellectual message. The gods and goddesses from the ancient mythologies represented different aspects of the human psyche, figures from religions represented different ideas, and history, like the other sources, represented a dialectic or play of ideas. Subjects with several figures ranked higher than single figures. For a long time, especially during the [[French Revolution]], history painting often focused on depiction of the heroic male nude; though this waned in the 19th century.

After history painting came, in order of decreasing worth: [[Portrait painting|portraits]], scenes of everyday life (called ''scènes de genre'', or "[[Genre works|genre painting]]", and also ''petit genre'' to contrast it with the ''grande genre''), [[Landscape art|landscapes]], animal painting, and finally [[still life]]s. In his formulation, such paintings were inferior because they were merely reportorial pictures without moral force or artistic imagination. Genre paintings—neither ideal in style, nor elevated in subject—were admired for their skill, ingenuity, and even humour, but never confused with high art. 

The hierarchy of genres also had a corresponding hierarchy of formats: large format for history paintings, small format for still lifes.  This had occasionally been breached in the past, especially in large Flemish works, and the monumental ''[[The Young Bull]]'' of the Dutch artist [[Paulus Potter]], as well as the larger of the two ''[[Butchers' Shop]]'' canvases of [[Annibale Carracci]].  But for the most part the relative prices obtainable for the different genres ensured the hierarchy of size also; it would not have been economic to paint a very large subject from the lower genres, except for commissioned group portraits.  Rubens' largest landscapes were painted for his own houses.

The use of the pictorial elements of painting such as line and color to convey an ultimate unifying theme or idea was regarded as the highest expression of art, and an idealism was adopted in art, whereby forms seen in nature would be generalized, and in turn subordinated to the unity of the artwork. It aimed at universal truth through the imitation of nature. Later  dissenting theorists, such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], held that this focus on [[allegory]] was faulty and based on a wrong analogy between the plastic arts and poetry rooted in the [[Horace|Horatian]] dictum [[ut pictura poesis]] ("as is painting so is poetry").

The British painter [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]] in his ''Discourses'' of the 1770s and 1780s, reiterated the argument for still life to the lowest position in the hierarchy of genres on the grounds that it interfered with the painter's access to central forms, those products of the mind's generalising powers. At the summit reigned history painting, centred on the human body: familiarity with the forms of the body permitted the mind of the painter, by comparing innumerable instances of the human form, to abstract from it those typical or central features that represented the body's essence or ideal.

Though Reynolds agreed with Félibien about the natural order of the genres, he held that an important work from any genre of painting could be produced under the hand of genius: "Whether it is the human figure, an animal, or even inanimate objects, there is nothing, however unpromising in appearance, but may be raised into dignity, convey sentiment, and produce emotion, in the hands of a painter of genius. What was said of [[Virgil]], that he threw even the dung about the ground with an air of dignity, may be applied to [[Titian]]; whatever he touched, however naturally mean, and habitually familiar, by a kind of magic he invested with grandeur and importance."

Though European academies usually strictly insisted on this hierarchy, over their reign, many artists were able to invent new genres which raised the lower subjects to the importance of history painting. Reynolds himself achieved this by inventing the portraiture style that was called the [[Grand Manner]], where he flattered his sitters by likening them to mythological characters. [[Jean-Antoine Watteau]] invented a genre that was called [[fêtes galantes]], where he would show scenes of courtly amusements taking place in Arcadian setting; these often had a poetic and allegorical quality which were considered to ennoble them. 

[[Claude Lorrain]] practised a genre called the [[ideal landscape]], where a composition would be loosely based on nature and dotted with classical ruins as a  setting for a biblical or historical theme. It artfully combined landscape and history painting, thereby legitimising the former. It is synonymous with the term ''historical landscape'' which received official recognition in the Académie française when a [[Prix de Rome]] for the genre was established in 1817. Finally, [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]] was able to create still life paintings that were considered to have the charm and beauty as to be placed alongside the best allegorical subjects. However, aware of this hierarchy, Chardin began including figures in his work in about 1730, mainly women and children.

==19th century==
[[Romanticism]] greatly increased the status of landscape painting, beginning in [[British art]] and more gradually that of genre painting, which began to influence history painting in the anecdotal treatments of the [[Style Troubadour]] in France and equivalent trends elsewhere. Landscapes grew in size to reflect their new importance, often matching history paintings, especially in the American [[Hudson River School]] and Russian painting. Animal paintings also increased in size and dignity, but the full-length portrait, even of royalty, became mostly reserved for large public buildings.

Until the middle of the 19th century, [[women artists|women]] were largely unable to paint history paintings as they were not allowed to participate in the final process of artistic training—that of life drawing, in order to protect their modesty. They could work from reliefs, prints, casts and from the Old Masters, but not from the nude model. Instead they were encouraged to participate in the lower painting forms such as portraiture, landscape and genre. These were considered more feminine in that they appealed to the eye rather than the mind.

Toward the end of the 19th century, painters and critics began to rebel against the many rules of the Académie française, including the status accorded to [[history painting]], which was beginning to be bought mainly by public bodies of one sort or another, as private buyers preferred subjects from lower down the hierarchy.  In Britain the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] movement tried to revitalize the history painting, with mixed success; other movements made similar efforts.  Many Pre-Raphaelites ended their careers mainly painting other subjects.  New artistic movements included the [[Realism (visual arts)|Realists]] and [[Impressionism|Impressionists]], which each sought to depict the present moment and daily life as observed by the eye, and unattatched from historical significance; the Realists often choosing genre painting and still life, while the Impressionists would most often focus on landscapes.

'''Indies Empire style''' (Dutch: ''Indische Empire stijl'') is an architectural style that flourished in the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]] (now Indonesia) between the middle of the 18th century and the end of the 19th century.{{sfn|Handinoto|1994|pp=1}} The style is an imitation of [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Empire Style]] which was popular in mid-19th-century [[France]]. Conformed to the tropical setting of Indonesia, the style became known in the Dutch East Indies as Indies Empire style.

==History==
===Rise of the Indies Empire style===
The development of the Indies Empire style is strongly related with the [[Indos in colonial history|Indies culture]], a society of mixed descendants which developed in the Dutch East Indies.{{sfn|Handinoto|1994|pp=1}} Indies people associated themselves with high status and expressed themselves by building opulent [[Dutch Indies country houses|country houses]] usually associated with European aristocrats.{{sfn|Milone|1967|pp=408}}{{sfn|Nas|2009|pp=128–30}} Many of these country houses appeared in the periphery of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] around the middle of 17th-century, the architectural style of which reached its peak when it merged completely with the [[Javanese traditional house|Javanese local architecture]], a new style known as the [[Dutch Indies country houses|Old Indies style]].

With the arrival of [[Herman Willem Daendels]] in early 19th-century, the development of the architectural style of these country houses took a different course. Daendels was a former [[colonel-general]] of [[Louis Bonaparte]] from France. At that time, a neoclassical architectural movement named [[Empire Style]] was popular in France. When Daendels was made the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]], he made Empire Style popular in the Dutch East Indies. Conformed with the tropical architecture of Indonesia, the style became known as the Indies Empire Style.{{sfn|Handinoto|1994|pp=8}}

[[File:Musetextil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Textile Museum (Jakarta)|Textile Museum]] in Jakarta, an example of a later period of Indies Empire style with the additions of corrugated steel shades.]]
By the end of 19th-century, clubhouses and playhouses were built in big cities of the Indies such as [[Colonial buildings in Jakarta|Batavia]], [[Semarang]] and [[Surabaya]]; most were built following the Indies Empire style trend.{{sfn|Handinoto|1994|pp=11–2}} City development at the end of 19th-century also influenced the form of Indies Empire style. The lack of available space in city centers required modification of typical Indies Empire styled houses. Stone columns were replaced with wooden or narrow iron columns, usually imported from the Netherlands.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond|1990|pp=12–5}} Also changing was the additions of corrugated steel shades supported by cast iron consoles to protect the windows and the front porch from rainwater and sun.{{sfn|Gemeentemuseum Helmond|1990|pp=12–5}} Examples of Indies Empire style houses from this later period are the [[Textile Museum (Jakarta)|Jakarta Textile Museum]] and some houses in Jalan Bubutan, [[Surabaya]].

In the 19th-century, the Indies Empire style is considered a representative of the "uptown" of Batavia, the area south of the "downtown" [[Kota Tua Jakarta|Kota Tua]]. Indies Empire Style is described as a trend in which houses were built in ''"...one storey with large gardens, with front and back galleries and high and wide halls; houses with hanging roofs where shade, air and coolness were the dominant privileges..."'', compared with the earlier [[Landhuis|Dutch style houses]] in Kota Tua, described as houses with ''"...high dark rooms with the beamed ceilings, the white painted walls and the red tiled floors."''{{sfn|Merrillees|2001|p=14}} 

===Decline===
Indies Empire style flourished until early 20th century, when the style was met with criticism. Indies Empire style in Indonesia was not a work of a professional architect, but a design of the building supervisor (''opzichter''). Modern academics such as architects [[Berlage]] and [[Pieter Adriaan Jacobus Moojen|Moojen]] considered the Indies Empire style buildings to be low in quality;{{sfn|Moojen|1924b|pp=105}} which led to a renaissance of architectural style which sought a new unique identity specially attributed to the culture of Dutch Indies. Later a new style emerged, known as the [[New Indies Style]], a modern movement and a branch of [[Rationalism (architecture)|Dutch Rationalism]] which at the end replaced the Indies Empire style.

==Characteristic==
[[File:Merdeka Palace Changing Guard 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Istana Merdeka, a typical residential building in early Indies Empire style.]]
Indies Empire style is essentially Empire Style conformed into the tropical setting of the Dutch East Indies. Similar with the [[Empire Style]], Indies Empire Style made an eclectic use of antique motifs – usually Greco-Roman – to imitate an imperial colonial dynasty. Few buildings in the Indies make reference to the Gothic style e.g. [[Cikini Hospital|the residence of Raden Saleh]]. Layout is symmetrical, with high ceiling, thick walls, and marble floor. Buildings often have a front (''voorgalerij'') and rear gallery (''achtergalerij''), flanked with [[Greek columns]]. This front and rear porticos are very spacious compared with its original European-style to improve [[cross ventilation]] into the interior as well as protecting it from intense tropical heat and rain – a European attempt to imitate the local [[Javanese traditional house|pringgitan]], a Javanese veranda with a bamboo bench where people may sleep during a hot noon. Furniture may be placed in the portico. An afternoon dance party or a card game are usually held in the portico, a tradition which mimics a French tradition more than a Dutch or Javanese tradition.{{sfn|Handinoto|1994|pp=11}}

An Indies Empire Style building has a symmetrical layout and composition. It consists of a main building, sometimes with additional pavilions situated at both sides of the main building. The main building contains a central hall which connects both the front and rear portico as well as various rooms inside. A gallery connects the main building with a service building which contains rooms for slaves, storage, kitchen, and other service facilities. The whole compound is situated in a large piece of land with spacious gardens at the front, rear, and sides of the main building. Tropical palm trees usually decorate this landscaping.{{sfn|Handinoto|1994|pp=8}}

In religious and magical practice, '''insufflation''' and '''[[exsufflation]]'''&lt;ref&gt;Insufflation (from [[Latin]] word elements meaning "a blowing on") and exsufflation ("a blowing out") often cannot be distinguished in usage, and so are considered together in this article.&lt;/ref&gt; are ritual acts of blowing, breathing, hissing, or puffing that signify variously expulsion or renunciation of evil or of the [[devil]] (the Evil One), or infilling or blessing with good (especially, in religious use, with the [[Holy Spirit|Spirit]] or [[Divine grace|grace of God]]).

In historical Christian practice, such blowing appears most prominently in the [[liturgy]], and is connected almost exclusively with [[baptism]] and other ceremonies of [[Christian]] [[initiation]], achieving its greatest popularity during periods in which such ceremonies were given a prophylactic or [[exorcism|exorcistic]] significance, and were viewed as essential to the defeat of the devil or to the removal of the taint of [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Franz Josef Dölger]], Der Exorzismus im altchristlichen Taufrituel, Studien zur Geschichte und Kultur des Altertums 3 (Paderborn, 1909), chap. 7 "Die Exsufflatio" (pp. 118-130); Edmond Martène, De antiquis ecclesiae ritibus libri tres (Venice, 1763), I.1.viii-xiv ("Ritus instituendi catechumeni"); Rudolf Suntrup, Die Bedeutung der liturgischen Gebärden und Bewegungen in lateinischen und deutschen Auslegungen des 9. bis 13. Jahrhunderts (Munich, 1978), pp. 307-310; and Henry A. Kelly, The Devil at Baptism: Ritual, Theology, and Drama (Ithaca, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ritual blowing occurs in the liturgies of [[catechumenate]] and [[baptism]] from a very [[Early Christianity|early period]] and survives into the modern [[Roman Catholic]], [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Maronite]], and [[Coptic Orthodox|Coptic]] rites.&lt;ref&gt;Alongside Martène and Suntrup (cited above), convenient collections of illustrative material include W. G. Henderson, ed., Manuale et Processionale ad usum insignis Ecclesiae Eboracensis, Surtees Society Publications 63 (Durham, 1875 for 1874), especially Appendix III "Ordines Baptismi" [cited below as York Manual]; Joseph Aloysius Assemanus, Codex liturgicus ecclesiae universae, I: De Catechumenis and II: De Baptismo (Rome, 1749; reprinted Paris and Leipzig, 1902); J.

Finn, Early Christian Baptism and the Catechumenate: Italy, North Africa, and Egypt (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic liturgy post-[[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] (the so-called ''novus ordo'' 1969) has largely done away with insufflation, except in a special rite for the consecration of [[chrism]] on [[Maundy Thursday]].&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Cross, ed., The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., rev. by F. L. Cross and E. A. Livingstone (Oxford, 1998), ''s.v.'' "insufflation," p. 839.&lt;/ref&gt; Protestant liturgies typically abandoned it very early on. The [[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine Catholic liturgy]] retained both an insufflation of the baptismal water and (like the present-day Orthodox and Maronite rites)&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., 840. For the Maronite rite, derived from the ancient Syriac liturgy, see Mysteries of Initiation, Baptism, Confirmation, Communion according to the Maronite Antiochene Church, (Washington, DC, 1987); summarized by Bryan D. Spinks, Early and Medieval Rituals and Theologies of Baptism..., (Aldershot, Hants., 2006), 89-91.&lt;/ref&gt; an exsufflation of the candidate for baptism, right up to the 1960s:

  &lt;blockquote&gt;[THE INSUFFLATION] ''He breathes thrice upon the waters in the form of a cross, saying:'' Do You with Your mouth bless these pure waters: that besides their natural virtue of cleansing the body, they may also be effectual for purifying the soul.&lt;ref&gt;Saint Andrew Daily Missal..., by Dom Gaspar Lefebvre (Bruges [Belgium]: Biblica, 1962), 492 [liturgy for the Easter vigil].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote&gt;THE EXSUFFLATION. ''The priest breathes three times on the child in the form of a cross, saying:'' Go out of him...you [[unclean spirit]] and give place to the Holy Spirit, the [[Paraclete]].&lt;ref&gt;Saint Andrew Missal (Bruges, 1962), 1768 [ceremonies of baptism].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Insufflation vs. exsufflation==

From an early period, the act had two distinct but not always distinguishable meanings: it signified on the one hand the derisive repudiation or exorcism of the devil; and, on the other, purification and consecration by and inspiration with the Holy Spirit. The former is technically "exsufflation" ("blowing out") and the latter "insufflation" ("blowing in"), but ancient and medieval texts (followed by modern scholarship) make no consistent distinction in usage. For example, the texts use not only Latin ''insufflare'' ('blow in') and ''exsufflare'' ('blow out'), or their Greek or [[vernacular]] equivalents, but also the simplex ''sufflare'' ('blow'), ''halare'' ('breathe'), ''inspirare'', ''exspirare'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;P. Pashini, ''et al.,'' ed., Enciclopedia Cattolica (Florence, 1949-1954), ''s.v.'' "insufflazione," pp. 55-56. Compare Neale, The Ancient Liturgies of the Gallican Church..., p. 266, note m; Whitaker, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, p. 256; Kelly, The Devil at Baptism, p. 235. Döger, Der Exorzismus im altchristlichen Taufrituel, p. 130 similarly distinguishes between exsufflation and "halation"; and Suntrup, Die Bedeutung der liturgischen Gebärden, p. 307 warns that the distinction is a hard one to maintain. The Episcopal Dictionary of the Church, ''s.v. insufflation'' (accessed 14 Jan 2007) similarly says that "the distinction between insufflation and exsufflation has not always been preserved." And the Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church, 3rd ed., p. 839, is content to give both inspirational ("to symbolize the influence of the Holy Spirit") and exorcistic ("the expulsion of evil spirits") meanings under the single heading of "insufflation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical is the 8th-century ''Libellus de mysterio baptismatis'' of [[Magnus of Sens]], one of a number of responses to a questionnaire about baptism circulated by [[Charlemagne]]. In discussing insufflation as a means of exorcising catechumens, Magnus combines a variety of mostly exsufflation-like functions≈

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Those who are to be baptised are insufflated by the priest of God, so that the Prince of Sinners [i.e. the devil] may be put to flight from out of them, and that entry for the Lord [[Christ]] might be prepared, and that by his insufflation they might be made worthy to receive the Holy Spirit."&lt;ref&gt;Patrologia Latina, 102:982D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This double role appears as early as [[Cyril of Jerusalem]]'s 4th-century ''Mystagogic Catacheses''; as Edward Yarnold notes, "Cyril attributes both negative and positive effects [to insufflation]. … The rite of breathing on the [baptismal] candidate has the negative effect of blowing away the devil (exsufflation) and the positive effect of breathing in grace (insufflation)."&lt;ref&gt;Cyril of Jerusalem, by Edward J. Yarnold (London: Routledge, 2000), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Early period===

What might neutrally be called "sufflation" is found in some of the earliest liturgies dealing with the protracted process of initiation known as the "[[catechumenate]]," which saw its heyday in the 4th and 5th centuries. The earliest extant liturgical use is possibly that of the ''[[Apostolic Tradition]]'' attributed to [[Hippolytus of Rome]], from the 3rd or 4th century, and therefore contemporary with Cyril in the east:&lt;ref&gt;The date is controversial. The text is usually connected with practice in Rome and dated in its earliest form to the early 3rd century. But the surviving text is fragmentary, many portions surviving only in much later versions in several different languages. Chapter 20, the relevant chapter, is perhaps from the 4th century (see Maxwell E. Johnson, The Rites of Christian Initiation: Their Evolution and Interpretation (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999), 78-81). For the standard reconstruction of the text, see Bernard Botte, La "Tradition Apostolique," 42-45 (chapter 20). Whitaker, Documents, p. 4, reprints the translation of Gregory Dix, The Treatise on the Apostolic Tradition, p. 32 (sect. xx.8). Botte renders the Coptic original of the sufflation passage as "exsufflet," though Kelly (Devil at Baptism, p. 87) points out that the significance of the gesture is uncertain. Geoffrey Cumming gives the more neutral translation "breathe on": Hippolytus: A Text for Students (Bramcote, Notts, 1976), p. 18, as reproduced more fully below.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who are to be baptized should … be gathered in one place. … And [the bishop] should lay his hands on them and exorcize all alien spirits, that they may flee out of them and ever return into them. And when he has finished exorcizing them, '''he shall breathe on their faces;''' and when he has signed their foreheads, ears, and noses, he shall raise them up.&lt;ref&gt;Cuming's translation, reprinted by Maxwell Johnson, Rites of Christian Initiation, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Distribution, geographical and functional===

The practice entered the baptismal liturgy proper only as the catechumenate, rendered vestigial by the growth of routine [[infant baptism]], was absorbed into the rite of baptism. Both exsufflation and insufflation are well established by the time of [[Augustine]] and in later centuries are found widely. By the Western [[high Middle Ages]] of the 12th century, sufflation was geographically widespread, and had been applied not only to sufflating catechumens and [[wikt:baptizand|baptizands]],&lt;ref&gt;Nearly universally. E.g. (1) in Egypt: Canons of Hippolytus, Canon 19 (or §110), trans. Riedel 211, Achelis 93, Whitaker 88; Horner's translations of the Ethiopic, Arabic, and Sahidic versions may be found on pp. 152, 252, and 316. (2) In western Syria: Cyril, Procatechesis, cap. 9, ed. F. L. Cross, St. Cyril of Jerusalem's Lectures on the Christian Sacraments: The "Procatechesis" and the "Five Mystical Dialogues" (London, 1951), 5-6, trans. 45 = Patrologia Graeca 33:347-50 (translated also by E. H. Gifford, Catechetical Lectures, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series (N.Y., 1894), 3); and the ''[[Testamentum Domini nostri Jesu Christi]]'', ed. and trans. Ignatius Ephraem II Rahmani (Mainz, 1899), 125, 127 (rpt. by Quasten, Monumenta, 5:266-67. (3) In Spain: Isidore, De ecclesiasticis officiis II.xxi.3, ed. C. M. Lawson, CCSL 113 (1989), 96/21 (Patrologia Latina 83:815A; trans. Whitaker, 117); the Spanish rites in general are discussed by Kelly, 234-36 and 244-52. (4) In northern Italy: see Kelly, 232-34 and 236-38; Whitaker, 143; and Cyrille Lambot, ed., North Italian Services of the Eleventh Century, [[Henry Bradshaw Society]] 67 (London, 1931 for 1928), 5, 6, 16. (5) In the Byzantine and other eastern rites: see, e.g., Lodi, 1303 (§2925) and Whitaker, 74; the eastern rites are treated extensively by Kelly, 136-200. (6) In Roman North Africa: Augustine is the most important witness; cp. also Quodvultdeus, De Symbolo III.1.3, ed. R. Braun, CCSL 60 (1976), 349 (Patrologia Latina 40:661).&lt;/ref&gt; but also to exorcism of readmitted [[heresy|heretics]]&lt;!-- (or lapsed Catholics regarded by Donatists as heretics) --&gt;;&lt;ref&gt;Council of Constantinople (A.D. 381), Canon VII, ed. N. P. Tanner, Decrees of the Ecumenical Councils [based on the text of G. Alberigo, ''et al.''] (London, 1990) 1:35: "We exorcize them by breathing thrice their faces and ears." This canon is evidently a 5th-century addition: see Kelly 144, Tanner 1:22 note 8. &lt;!-- Augustines' anti-Donatist works --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to admission of adult converts to the catechumenate;&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in the Gelasian Sacramentary, ed. L. C. Mohlberg, Liber Sacramentorum Romanae Aeclesiae Ordinis Anni Circuli... (Sacramentum Gelasianum), Rerum Ecclesiasticarum Documenta, Serie maior, Fontes, 4 (Rome, 1981), 93 (§598) (trans. Whitaker, 192); and the Fulda Sacramentary, ed. Gregor Richter and Albert Schönfelder, Sacramentum Fuldense Saeculi X, Quellen und Abhandlungen zur Geschichte der Abtei und der Diözese Fulda 9 (Fulda, 1912), rpt. Henry Bradshaw Society 101 (1977 for 1972-7) 354 (§2723). Cp. Assemani, 1:20.&lt;/ref&gt; to renunciation of the devil on the part of catechumens;&lt;ref&gt;In Dionysius, De ecclesiasticis hierarchiis 2.6 (Patrologia Graeca 3:395/6:B); rpt. Quasten, Monumenta, 6:281; trans. Whitaker, 57. In Ephraem Syrus, In secundum adventum domini, cited by Kelly, 135 note 30. And in the Byzantine rite (see Whitaker, 70, 77). For Western sources, see further below.&lt;/ref&gt; to consecration and/or exorcism of the [[baptismal font]] and water;&lt;ref&gt;Very commonly, e.g. in the Byzantine rite (Whitaker, 80); the (Milanese) Ambrosian Manual (Whitaker, 138, 145); other North Italian rites (Lambot, 33); the Liber Ordinum (ed. Férotin, 29; trans. Whitaker, 118); the Missale Gothicum; the Gregorian Sacramentary (''Hadrianum''); the Ordo Romanus L; and in the Sarum Missal (ed. J. Wickham Legg (Oxford: Clarendon, 1916; rpt. 1969), 129) and other English texts (see below).&lt;/ref&gt; to consecration or exorcism of [[Ash Wednesday|ashes]];&lt;ref&gt;In the Ambrosian Manual (Kelly, 228) and in Beroldus (12th century Milan; trans. in Whitaker, 149).&lt;/ref&gt; and to the consecration of the chrism or holy oil.&lt;ref&gt;In the Byzantine rite (Whitaker, 81); in the Ethiopic rite (A. Salles, trans., Trois antiques rituels du baptême, [[Sources Chrétiennes]] 59 (Paris, 1958), 50); in several Ordines Romani (e.g., Ordo XXIV 18, Ordo XXVII 31, Ordo XXVIII 22, all ed. Michel Andrieu, Les Ordines Romani du Haut Moyen Âge, vol. 3, Spicilegium Sacrum Lovaniense, Études et Documents, fasc. 24 (Louvain, 1951), 291, 354, 396; also in the ''Ordo'' quoted by Amalarius, Liber Officialis, I.xii.27-8, ed. Jean-Michel Hanssens, Amalarii Episcopi Opera Liturgica Omnia, vol. 2, Studi e testi 139 (Vatican City, 1948), 75-76; and in the nine 12th-century English pontificals printed as Appendix 3.1 to the Bainbridge Pontifical (W. G. Henderson, ed., Liber Pontificalis Chr. Bainbridge Archiepiscopi Eboracensis, Surtees Society Publications 61 (Durham, 1875 for 1873), 254, 256).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval period===

Most of these variations persist in one branch or another of the hybrid [[Pontificale Romano-Germanicum|Romano-Germanic]] rite that can be traced from 5th-century Rome through the western Middle Ages to the [[Council of Trent]], and beyond that into modern ([[Tridentine Mass|Tridentine]]) Roman Catholicism. As the 'national' rites such as the [[Ambrosian Rite|Ambrosian tradition]] in [[northern Italy]] and the Spanish [[Mozarabic rite]] faded away or were absorbed into international practice, it was this hybrid Roman-Gallican standard that came to dominate western [[Christendom]], including [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[medieval England]], from the time of Charlemagne, and partly through his doing, through the high and late Middle Ages and into the modern period. Roman practice around the year 500 is reflected in a letter by a somewhat mysterious [[John the Deacon (Church of Rome)|John the Deacon]] to a correspondent named Senarius. The letter discusses the exsufflation of catechumens at length.&lt;ref&gt;John the Deacon, Epistola ad Senarium,  ed. [[A. Wilmart]], "Analecta Reginensia (Vat. Reg. Lat. 69)," Studi e testi 59 (1933), 172; trans. Whitaker, Documents of the Baptismal Liturgy, 155.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stowe Missal]], Irish in origin but largely [[Gallican Rite|Gallican]] in form, contains a prebaptismal sufflation of unclear significance.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Warren, Liturgy and Ritual of the Celtic Church (Oxford, 1881; rpt. with introduction by Jane Stevenson, Woodbridge, Suffolk, 1987), 209; The Stowe Missal, ed. George F. Warner, Henry Bradshaw Society 32 (London, 1915), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The other Gallican rites are largely devoid of sufflation, though the so-called [[Gallican rite#Missale Gothicum|Missale Gothicum]] contains a triple exsufflation of baptismal water,&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Gallican Liturgies, 97; or L. C. Mohlberg, ed., Missale Gothicum, Rerum Ecclesiasticarum Documenta, Series Maior, Fontes 5 (Rome, 1961), 67.&lt;/ref&gt; and a prebaptismal insufflation of catechumens is found in the hybrid [[Celtic Rite#The Bobbio Missal|Bobbio Missal]]&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Gallican Liturgies, 266&lt;/ref&gt; and the 10th-century [[Fulda]] [[sacramentary]], alongside the more common baptismal exsufflation.&lt;ref&gt;Fulda Sacramentary, 332 (§2631) and 343 (§2679-80).&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th-century North-Italian baptismal ritual in the [[Ambrosian Library]] MS. T.27.Sup. makes heavy use of the practice, requiring both insufflation and triple exsufflation of the baptismal candidates ''in modum crucis'', and insufflation of the font as well.&lt;ref&gt;Lambot, North Italian Services, 5, 11, 16, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Hadrianum" version of the Gregorian Sacramentary, sent to Charlemagne from Rome and augmented probably by [[Benedict of Aniane]], contains an insufflation of the baptismal font,&lt;ref&gt;Jean Deshusses, Le Sacramentaire Grégorien, vol. 1, Spicilegium Friburgense 16 (Fribourg, 1971), 188; the rubric here is reconstructed by Deshusses from a wide variety of variants. On the attribution of the Hadrianum supplement to Benedict, see Deshusses, 1:63-7 and vol. 3, Spicilegium Friburgense 28 (Fribourg, 1982), 66-75, as well as his earlier article "Le 'Supplément' au sacramentaire grégorien: Alcuin ou S. Benoît d'Aniane?" Archiv für Liturgiewissenschaft 9.1 (1965): 48-71.&lt;/ref&gt; as does the mid-10th-century ''Ordo Romanus L'',&lt;ref&gt;Ordo L, xxxix.50; Michel Andrieu, ed., Les Ordines Romani du Haut Moyen Age, vol. 5, Spicilegium Sacrum Lovaniense, Études et Documents, fasc. 29 (Louvain, 1961), 281.&lt;/ref&gt; the basis of the later Roman pontifical. ''Ordo Romanus L'' also contains a triple exsufflation of the candidates for baptism, immediately preceding the baptism itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ordo L, xx.5; Andrieu, 5:131. This section was probably also originally found in Ordo XI according to Andrieu (2:376).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the numerous [[Carolingian Empire|Carolingian]] expositions of baptism treat sufflation to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;See Jean-Paul Bouhot, "Explications du rituel baptismal à l'époque carolingienne," Revue des études augustiniennes 24 (1978): 278-301; and Susan A. Keefe, "Carolingian Baptismal Expositions: A Handlist of Tracts and MSS," in Carolingian Essays, ed. Uta-Renate Blumenthal (Washington, DC, 1983), 169-238.&lt;/ref&gt; One anonymous 9th-century catechism is unusual in distinguishing explicitly between the exsufflation of catechumens and the insufflation of baptismal water,&lt;ref&gt;[[André Wilmart]], "Une catéchèse baptismale du IX&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; siècle," Revue Bénédictine 57 (1947): 199 (Keefe, "Expositions," text 50).&lt;/ref&gt; but most of the [[tract (literature)|tract]]s and [[florilegium|florilegia]], when they treat both, do so without referring one to the other; most confine themselves to exsufflation and are usually content to quote extracts from authorities, especially [[Isidore]] and [[Alcuin]].&lt;ref&gt;E.g. in Keefe's texts 34/6 and 3: Jean-Paul Bouhot, "Alcuin et le 'De Catechizandis Rudibus,'" Recherches Augustiniennes 15 (1980): 224; and Wilmart, Analecta, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly popular was Isidore's lapidary remark in the Etymologies to the effect that it is not the human being ("God's creature") that is exsufflated, but the Prince of Sinners to whom that person is subjected by being born in sin,&lt;ref&gt;''Sciendum est quod non creatura Dei in infantibus exorcizatur aut exufflatur, sed ille sub quo sunt omnes qui cum peccato nascuntur; est enim princeps peccatorum''. Etymologiarum,VI.xix.56; ed. W. M. Lindsay (Oxford, 1911).&lt;/ref&gt; a remark that echoed [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]'s arguments against the [[Pelagians]] to the effect that it was not the human infant (God's image) that was attacked in sufflation, but the infant's possessor, the devil. Particularly influential was Alcuin's brief treatment of the subject, the so-called ''Primo paganus'', which in turn depended heavily on John the Deacon.&lt;ref&gt;Alcuin's comments are contained in two genuine letters (numbers 134, to Odwin, and 137, to monks in the south of France), ed. Ernst Dümmler, Epistolae Karolini Aevi, 2, MGH Epistolae 4 (Berlin, 1895), 202 and 214; and in a third letter of dubious authenticity, ostensibly to Charlemagne, ed. Patrologia Latina 98:938B. The three letters are nearly verbatim identical in their description of exsufflation: ''Primo paganus catechumenus fit, accedens ad baptismum; ut renuntiet maligno spiritui et omnibus eius pompis. Exsufflatur etiam; ut, fugato diabolo, Christo Deo nostro paretur introitus'' (MGH, 214, = Keefe text 9, Bouhot, 280-82.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Primo paganus'' formed the basis of Charlemagne's famous circular questionnaire on baptism, part of his effort to harmonize liturgical practice across his empire; and many of the seventeen extant direct or indirect responses to the questionnaire echo Alcuin, making the process a little circular and the texts a little repetitious.&lt;ref&gt;For the various replies, see Wilmart, 154; Bouhot, 286-93; and Keefe, ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; The burden of Alcuin's remarks, in fact, appears above in the quotation from the ''Libellus'' of Magnus of Sens, one of the respondents.&lt;ref&gt;The Libellus of Magnus of Sens is Keefe's text 15 (Bouhot, 287).&lt;/ref&gt; The questionnaire assumed that exsufflation of or on the part of the candidate for baptism was generally practiced — it merely asks what meaning is attached to the practice:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Concerning the renunciation of Satan and all his works and pomps, what is the renunciation? and what are the works of the devil and his pomps? why is he breathed upon? (''cur exsufflatur?'') why is he exorcised?"&lt;ref&gt;See J. D. C. Fisher, Christian Initiation: Baptism in the Medieval West (London, 1965), 59. The text (Keefe's text 14; Bouhot, 286) is readily available in Dorothy Bethurum's edition of the Homilies of Wulfstan (Oxford, 1957), 302-3, and less readily in Jean Michel Hanssens, Amalarii...opera 1, Studi e test 138 (1948), 235-6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most of the respondents answered that it was so that, with the devil sent fleeing, the entry of the Holy Spirit might be prepared for.

====In England====

On the other side of the Channel, in Anglo-Saxon England, sufflation is mentioned in Bishop [[Wulfstan (died 1023)|Wulfstan]]'s collection of Carolingian baptismal expositions, the ''Incipit de baptisma'', and in the two vernacular ([[Old English]]) [[homily|homilies]] based on it, the ''Quando volueris'' and the ''Sermo de baptismate''. The ''Incipit de baptisma'' reads: "On his face let the sign of the cross be made by exsufflation, so that, the devil having been put to flight, entry for our Lord Christ might be prepared."&lt;ref&gt;''In cuius … facie a sacerdote per exsufflationem signum crucis sit, ut effugeto diabolo, Cristo Domino nostro preparetur introitus''. Wulfstan, Homilies, ed. Bethurum, Homily VIIIa (p. 169, ll. 8-10). For the relationship between the three pieces, see pp. 302-4. For the parallel passages in the vernacular homilies, see Homily VIIIb (p. 172, ll. 14-22) and Homily VIIIc (pp. 176-7, ll. 29-35). Wulfstan's collection draws on a variety of Carolingian sources, but in this passage quotes almost verbatim the De Ordine Baptismi of Theodulf of Orleans (yet another Alcuin-derivative reply to Charlemagne; Keefe text 16), ed. in Patrologia Latina 105:225B.&lt;/ref&gt; Among English liturgical texts proper, the 10th-century Leofric Pontifical (and Sacramentary) dictates an insufflation of baptizands, a triple insufflation of the baptismal water, and an 'exhalation' of holy oil.&lt;ref&gt;F. E. Warren, ed., The Leofric Missal as used in the Cathedral of Exeter during the Episcopate of its First Bishop, A. D. 1050-1072 (Oxford, 1883), 236-37, 259. This text may, however, originate on the Continent: see H. M. J. Bantin, Two Anglo-Saxon Pontificals, Henry Bradshaw Society 104 (London, 1989), xxiii-xxv. The contemporary, and genuinely English, Egbert Pontifical, from York, lacks mention of sufflation.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, the ''Salisbury Pontifical'' (BL [[Cotton MS Tiberius]] C.1) and the ''Pontifical'' of [[Thomas of Canterbury]] require insufflation of the font; the ''Missal'' of [[Robert of Jumièges]] (Canterbury) has an erased [[rubric]] where it may have done likewise, as well as having an illegible rubric where it probably directed the exsufflation of catechumens, and retaining the old ''ordo ad caticuminum ex pagano faciendum,'' complete with its sufflation ceremony; and an English ''Ordo Romanus'' (BL Cotton MS Vitellius E.12) contains a triple exsufflation of baptizands.&lt;ref&gt;W. G. Henderson, ed., York Manual, 144, 136, 133, 142; H. A. Wilson, ed., The Missal of Robert of Jumiège, Henry Bradshaw Society 11 (London, 1896), 93, 98, 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Various 12th-century texts include signing and triple exsufflation of the holy oil (Sarum), triple exsufflation of baptizands (the Ely, Magdalene, and Winton Pontificals), and insufflation of the font ''in modum crucis'' (Ely and Magdalene, followed by most later texts).&lt;ref&gt;See the Bainbridge Pontifical, appendix 3, 254; York Manual, 147, 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Such are the origins of the late medieval sufflation rites, which were in turn retained in regularized form in post-Tridentine Catholicism.

===Sufflation in Protestantism===

Sufflation did not last long in any of the churches arising from the magisterial or radical reformations. [[Martin Luther]]'s first attempt at a baptismal liturgy, the Tauffbuchlin (Taufbüchlein) of 1523 (reprinted 1524 and 1525) did retain many ceremonies from the late Medieval ritual as it was known in Germany, including a triple exsufflation of baptizands. But in an epilogue, Luther listed this ceremony among the [[adiaphora]] — i.e., the inessential features that added nothing to the meaning of the sacrament:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The least importance attaches to these external things, namely '''breathing under the eyes,''' signing with the cross, placing salt in the mouth, putting spittle and clay on the ears and nose, anointing with oil the breast and shoulders, and signing the top of the head with chrism, vesting in the christening robe, and giving a burning candle into the hand, and whatever else … men have added to embellish baptism. For … they are not the kind of devices that the devil shuns."&lt;ref&gt;Luther's Works 53:103, Weimar Ausgabe 12:48; cited in Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Lutheran Strasbourg ''Taufbüchlein'' of June 1524, composed by [[Diobald Schwartz]], assistant to Cathedral preacher [[Martin Zell]], on the basis of the medieval rite used in Strasbourg combined with elements of Luther's 1523 rite, also retains baptismal exsufflation;&lt;ref&gt;Text in F. Hubert, Die Strassburger liturgischen Ordnungen in Zeitalter der Reformation (Göttingen: Vandenhoek und Ruprecht, 1900), 25ff.; transl. in Fisher, Christian Initiation: the Reformation Period, 30-33.&lt;/ref&gt; so does [[Andreas Osiander]] in Nuremberg, in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, Christian Initiation, 18. The dependence of Schwartz and Osiander on Luther appears from their use of his distinctive rubric "breathe ''under the eyes''" — not found in the medieval rites.&lt;/ref&gt;

But thereafter the practice vanished from [[Lutheranism]], and indeed from Protestantism generally. Luther's revised edition of 1526 and its successors omit exsufflation altogether, as do the Luther-influenced early reformed rites of England ([[Thomas Cranmer]]'s Prayer Book of 1549) and Sweden (the Manual of [[Olavus Petri]]), despite the former's conservative basis in the medieval Sarum ritual and the latter's strong interest in exorcism as an essential part of the baptismal ritual.&lt;ref&gt;For a handy comparison, see The Manual of Olavus Petri, 1529, ed. Eric E. Yelverton (London: SPCK, 1953), p. [110].&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly in the Swiss Reformation (the Zwinglian/Reformed tradition), only the very earliest rites retain sufflation, namely the ceremony published by Leo Jud, pastor of St. Peter's in Zurich, in the same year (1523) as Luther's first baptismal manual.&lt;ref&gt;English translation in Fisher, Christian Initiation: the Reformation Period, 126ff.; discussed briefly in Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 31, and fully in H. O. Old, The Shaping of the Reformed Baptismal Rite in the Sixteenth Century (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sufflation in Protestant-Roman Catholic debate===

Though sufflation does not appear in Protestant practice, it definitely appears in Protestant [[polemic]], where it is usually treated as an un-Scriptural and superstitious (i.e., in the Protestant view, a typically Roman Catholic) practice, and even one reeking of enchantment or witchcraft. It appears as such, for example in the work of [[Henry More]] (the 'Cambridge Platonist') on evil. His argument essentially reverses that of Augustine. Augustine had said to the Pelagians (to paraphrase): "you see that we exorcize and exsufflate infants before baptising them; therefore they must be tainted with sin and possessed by the devil since birth." More replies, in effect, "Infants cannot be devil-possessed sinners; therefore, ceremonial exorcism and exsufflation is presumptuous, frightening, and ridiculous," in a word "the most gross and fundamental Superstitions, that look like Magick or Sorcery":
   
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The conjuring the Devil also out of the Infant that is to be baptized would seem a frightful thing to the Infant himself, if he understood in what an ill plight the Priest supposes him, while he makes three Exsufflations upon his face, and uses an Exorcistical form for the ejecting of the foul Fiend. … And it is much if something might not appear affrightful to the Women in this approaching darkness. For though it be a gay thing for the Priest to be thought to have so much power over the [[Styx|Stygian]] Fiend, as to Exorcize him out of the Infant; yet it may be a sad consideration with some melancholick women laden with Superstition, to think they are never brought to bed, but they are delivered of a Devil and Child at once."&lt;ref&gt;Henry More, A Modest Enquiry into the Mystery of Iniquity (London, 1664), 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sufflation appears in Roman Catholic anti-Protestant polemic, as well. The relative antiquity of the practice, and its strong endorsement by the Protestants' favorite [[Church Father|Father]], Augustine, made it a natural element in Catholic arguments that contrasted the Protestant with the ancient and Apostolic church. A true church, according to Roman Catholic apologists, would be:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"A Church that held the exorcismes exsufflations and renunciations, which are made in baptisme, for sacred Ceremonies, and of Apostolicall tradition.... A Church which in the Ceremonies of baptisme, vsed oyle, salte, waxe, lights, exorcismes, the signe of the Cross, the word Epheta and other thinges that accompanie it; to testifie ... by exorcismes, that baptisme puts vs out of the Diuells possession.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Davy Du Perron, The reply of the most illustrious Cardinall of Perron, to the ansvveare of the most excellent King of Great Britaine (Douay. 1630) 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This was argued on the grounds that some of these ceremonies were demonstrably ancient, and all of them might be.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Sundry Ceremonies vsed in baptisme, and other Sacraments, as Exorcismes, Exsufflations, Christening, and the like mentioned by S. Augustine and by diuers other ancient Fathers ..., these being practised by the Primitiue Church (which is graunted to be the true Church) and compared to the customes of Protestants, and vs, in our Churches, will easily disclose, which of the two, they or we, do more imitate, or impugne the true Church of antiquity."&lt;ref&gt;[[Humphrey Leech]]; [[Robert Persons]], Dutifull and respective considerations vpon foure seuerall heads of proofe and triall in matters of religion  ... By a late minister &amp; preacher in England (Saint-Omer, 1609), 210&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To which a Protestant reply was that sufflation was not ancient ''enough'', and could not be proved to be apostolic:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was plain then there was no clear Tradition  in the Question, possibly there might be a custome in some Churches postnate to the times of the Apostles, but nothing that was obligatory, no Tradition Apostolicall. But this was a suppletory device ready at hand when ever they needed it; and  S. Austin confuted the Pelagians, in the Question of Original sinne, by the custome of exorcisme and insufflation, which S. Austin said came from the Apostles by Tradition, which yet was then, and is now so impossible to be prov'd, that he that shall affirm it, shall gaine only the reputation of a bold man and a confident."&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Taylor, Treatises of 1. The liberty of prophesying, 2. Prayer ex tempore, 3. Episcopacie : together with a sermon preached at Oxon.... (London, 1648), 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sufflation was judged by Protestant critics to be irrational, mysterious, and obscure, an increasingly important factor by the close of the 17th century and the dawn of [[the Enlightenment]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Mystery prevail'd very little in the first Hundred or Century of Years after Christ; but in the second and third, it began to establish it self by Ceremonies. To Baptism were then added the tasting of Milk and  Honey,  Anointing, the Sign of the Cross, a white Garment, &amp;amp;c. ... But in later times there was no end of Lights, Exorcisms, Exsufflations, and many other Extravagancies of Jewish, or Heathen Original ... for there is nothing like these in the Writings of the Apostles, but they are all plainly contain'd in the Books of the Gentiles, and was the Substance of their Worship."&lt;ref&gt;John Toland, Christianity Not Mysterious, Or, A Treatise Shewing that there is Nothing in The Gospel Contrary to Reason, nor Above it and that no Christian Doctrine can be Properly Call'd a Mystery (London, 1696), 163-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was said to be a human invention, imposed by the arbitrary whim of a tyrannical prelate against the primitive Gospel freedom of the church:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Some bishop] ... taking it into his head that there ought to be a trine-immersion in baptism; another the signation of the cross; another an unction with oil; another milk and honey, and imposition of hands immediately after it; another insufflation or breathing upon the person's face to exorcise the Devil... Thus, I say, that inundation of abominable corruptions, which at present overwhelms both the Greek and Romish Churches, gradually came in at this very breech which you are now zealously maintaining, namely, the Bishop's Power to decree rites and ceremonies in the Church."&lt;ref&gt;[[Micaiah Towgood]], A dissent from the Church of England fully justified, 5th ed. (London, 1779),&lt;!-- ECCO id no. CW3321486367--&gt; p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
To all of which, Roman Catholic apologists replied that insufflation was not only ancient and Apostolic, but had been practiced by Christ himself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"When he [Christ] had said this he breathed upon them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Ghost...." When the Pastors of our Church use the Insufflation or Breathing upon any, for the like mystical Signification, you cry aloud, Superstition, Superstition, an apish mimical action, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;James Mumford, The Catholic scripturist, or the plea of the Roman Catholics, 4th ed. (London(?), 1767),&lt;!-- ECCO doc number CW3320627310--&gt; p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Prospects===

Though liturgical sufflation is almost gone, at least from the Western churches, its revival is not inconceivable. Liturgical renewal movements always seem to look to the 'classic' catechumenate of the 4th and 5th centuries for inspiration.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Insufflation has indeed been re-introduced into the Catholic "new catechumenate." But many ceremonies dating from that or the medieval period have been re-imported even into Protestant rites during the last couple of decades.  Perhaps even more likely is a revival in the context of the growth of the [[Roman Catholicism in Africa|Roman Catholic Church in Africa]] and [[Roman Catholicism in Asia|in Asia]], where locally and culturally meaningful ceremonies have often revolutionized practice, and where the exorcistic function of baptism has taken on a new vitality. For example, a pure insufflation is apparently practiced in the [[Philippine Independent Church]],&lt;ref&gt;Peter Jagger, Christian Initiation 1552-1969... (London, 1970), 292. This is basically a Roman rite with some Anglican-like features.&lt;/ref&gt; and Spinks mentions a pre-baptismal ceremony used by the [[Christian Workers' Fellowship]] of [[Roman Catholicism in Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]], in which the candidates are struck with a cane and their faces are breathed upon.&lt;ref&gt;Spinks, Reformation and Modern Rituals, 203, citing Francis Wickremesinghe, "An Asian Inculturation of the Baptismal Liturgy," in David R. Holeton, ed., Growing in Newness of Life (Toronto: Anglican Book Centre, 1993), 213-217.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the latter represents a revival of historical sufflation, or a wholly new ceremony derived from local custom.

==Significance and associations==

There were at least three kinds of association that particularly influenced how liturgical sufflation came to be understood: [[Biblical]] antecedents; liturgical setting; and extra-liturgical (cultural) analogs.

===Biblical antecedents===

Three Biblical passages recur repeatedly with reference to insufflation narrowly defined, all of them referring to some kind of life-giving divine breath. The first and most commonly cited is {{bibleverse||Genesis|2:7}} (echoed by {{bibleverse||Wisdom|15:11}} and {{bibleverse||Job|33:4}}), in which God first creates man and then breathes into him the breath of life, in order to give him (as the passage was later interpreted) a human soul.&lt;ref&gt;"His life is of less worth than clay, because he failed to know the one who formed him and inspired him with an active soul and breathed into him a living spirit [Vulg. 'insufflavit ei spiritum vitalem']" Wisdom 15:10-11 (RSV); "The spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life" Job 33:4 (RSV). Cp. Psalm 33:6.&lt;/ref&gt; The second passage, {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|37:9}}, reinterprets the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] passage prophetically, in foreseeing God resurrecting the dead bones of exiled [[Israelites|Israel]] by means of his life-giving breath.&lt;ref&gt;"Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain [Vulg. 'insuffla super interfectos istos'], that they may live.... And the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood upon their feet" Ezekiel 37:9-10 (RSV).&lt;/ref&gt; And finally, in {{bibleverse||John|20:22}}, Christ is represented as conveying the [[Paraclete]] to his disciples, and so initiating the commissioned church, by breathing on them, here too, very possibly, with implicit reference to the original creation.&lt;ref&gt;"He breathed [on them?] [Vulg. ''insufflavit''] and said to them, 'receive the Holy Spirit'" John 20:22 (RSV).&lt;/ref&gt; The two passages were connected explicitly in later Christian exegesis: the same breath that created man re-created him.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Insufflation] signifies, To blow into, Gen. 2. 7. This sheweth mans soul not to be of the earth, as his body was, but of nothing, by the insufflation of God, and so differing from the spirit of beasts, Eccl. 3. 21. This word is used also, when Christ to make men new creatures, inspired his Apostles with the holy Ghost, Joh. 20. 21."&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Wilson (lexicographer)|Thomas Wilson]], ed. John Bagwell, ''A complete Christian dictionary wherein the significations and several acceptations of all the words mentioned in the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are fully opened, expressed, explained ...'' (London, 1661) p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Lord God, saith the Text, formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his Nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living Soul. His Body made of Earth, but his Soul the Breath of God. … We must not understand it grosly; for so Breath is not attributable unto God, who is a simple and perfect Spirit; but … as a figurative expression of God's communicating unto Man that inward Principle, whereby he lives and acts, not only in common with, but in a degree above other Animals. … The Learned P. Fagius takes notice of three things in the Text of Moses, which do conclude the Immortality of the Soul of Man. I. ''Insufflatio illa Dei:'' This Inspiration from God spoken of: For he that breaths into another, contributes unto him ''aliquid de suo'' somewhat of his own: And therefore, saith he, when our B. Saviour would communicate his Spirit to his Disciples, he did it with Insufflation, breathing on them, thereby to signifie, ''se Divinum &amp; de suo quiddam illis contribuere'' [i.e., that he was himself divine and was infusing something of his own into them]."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Camfield, A theological discourse of angels and their ministries wherein their existence, nature, number, order and offices are modestly treated of … . (London, 1678) 184-185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The associations with creation, rebirth, initiation, and revivification created by these passages of  Scripture suited insufflation for a role in baptism as it has been most commonly regarded: as figuring the waters of creation (over which the Spirit brooded); as figuring the womb of rebirth; and as figuring (in [[Saint Paul]]'s metaphor) the tomb, into which the Christian joins Christ in descending, and from which the Christian likewise joins Christ in ascending, dead to the old life but made alive again in Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Romans 6:3-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also Biblical antecedents for exsufflation, properly speaking, that is, exorcistic blowing, especially the numerous [[Old Testament]] passages in which "the breath of God" is the vehicle or symbol not of life but of death and destruction — an expression of the [[Divine retribution|wrath of God]]: "by the breath of God they perish / and by the blast of his anger they are consumed" (Job 4:9, RSV).&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Isaiah 11:4 ("with the breath of his lips he shall slay the wicked").&lt;/ref&gt; The same power is attributed metaphorically to Christ: "The lawless one will be revealed, and the Lord [[Jesus]] will slay him with the breath of his mouth" (2 Thessalonians 2:8, RSV). Even less obvious passages could be associated with liturgical exsufflation. [[Jesse of Amiens]], for example, interprets Psalm 34 (Vulg. 35):5 as descriptive of the fate of exsufflated devils: ""Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them on!"&lt;ref&gt;Psalm 34:5 (RSV) (Vulg. 35:5); Jesse of Amiens, Patrologia Latina 105:786D.&lt;/ref&gt; And the [[apocrypha]]l [[Acts of Thomas]] describes a baptismal ceremony which, though it does not explicitly contain a breathing ceremony, may imply one, "Let the gift come by which, breathing upon thine enemies, thou didst make them draw back and fall headlong, and let it dwell in this oil, over which we name thy holy name."&lt;ref&gt;Acts of Thomas, §157; trans. in New Testament Apocrypha, ed. Edgar Hennecke; rev. by Wilhelm Schneemelcher; trans. R. McL. Wilson (Cambridge, 1992), 2:401. The Biblical allusion is apparently to John 18.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

God's breath can be fiery, consuming all it touches: "I will blow upon you with the fire of my wrath" (Ezekiel 21:31, RSV).&lt;ref&gt;Vulg. "In igne furoris mei sufflabo in te." Cp. the fiery brimstone breath of God in Isaiah 30:33.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the interpretations of exsufflation may reflect this. Cyril of Jerusalem, for example, when he discusses exsufflation in his [[catechetical]] sermons, interprets the liturgical practice in terms of fire:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The breathing of the saints and the invocation of the name of God, like fiercest flame, scorch and drive out evil spirits."&lt;ref&gt;Catechesis XX.3, Patrologia Graeca 33:1079/80; trans. Gifford, 147. In the pre-catechetical lectures he seems to combine the fire of God's wrath and the Biblical motif of the refiner's fire (Malachi 3:2, 1 Peter 1:7, Revelation 3:18): "as the goldsmith..., as it were breathing on the gold which is hid in the hollow of the forge, stimulates the flame it acts upon and so obtains what he is seeking; so also exorcizers..., setting the soul on fire in the crucible of the body, make the evil spirit flee." Procatechesis §9; ed. F. L. Cross, 5-6 (Patrologia Graeca 33:347/8-349/350); trans. Cross, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fire remains a theme in later liturgical exorcisms, for devils, as [[Nicetas of Remesiana|Nicetas]] is reported to have said, "are purged by exorcisms as by fire":&lt;ref&gt;Nicetas quoted in Bouhot, De catechizandis rudibus, 225 (§67).&lt;/ref&gt; "we come against you, devil, with spiritual words and fiery speech; we ignite the hiding places in which you are concealed."&lt;ref&gt;Liber Ordinum, ed. Férotin, 75; trans. in Kelly, 248 (cp. 237-37). Cp. Lambot, North Italian Services, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Liturgical context===

More importantly, perhaps, fire is physically and symbolically associated with sufflation because of the traditional placement of baptism within the [[Paschal vigil]] — a setting heavy with symbolism of light and fire: the blessing of the Paschal candle, the lighting of the "new fire," and the singing of the ''[[Exultet]]'' and the ''[[Lumen Christi]].'' The intimate connection between divine breath and divine fire appears in its most visually arresting form during the [[benediction]] of the font, in which, according to most orders, the candle is dipped in the font while the priest declares the power of the Holy Spirit to have descended into the water: the sufflation of the font in most cases directly precedes or accompanies the immersion of the candle.&lt;ref&gt;Amalarius, Liber Officialis, I.xxv.2 (ed. Hanssens, 2:134-5) and I.xxvi (2:136-8); the Gellone Sacramentary, ed. Dumas, 99 (§704d); many manuscripts of the Hadrianum (ed. Deshusses 1:188, §374e); Ordo Romanus L xxxix.50 (ed. Andrieu 5:280-1); the Missal of Robert of Jumiège, 98-9; the York Manual, 15, 136*, 144*, 149*, 153*; Suntrup, 417-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Their close association can again be illustrated from Wulfstan's baptismal homilies:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"By the breath that the priest breathes into the font when he blesses it, the devil is straightway driven out from it. And when the priest dips the consecrated candle in the water, then that water forthwith becomes imbued with the Holy Ghost."&lt;ref&gt;Wulfstan, Homily VIIIb (ed. Bethurum, p. 173, ll. 39-43); cp. Homily VIIIa (p. 170, ll. 36-40) and Homily VIIIc (p. 179, ll. 73-6).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar considerations bind sufflation closely to imagery of light and darkness, specifically of the movement of the baptizand from the kingdom of darkness into the kingdom of light (a very common theme), and to the sign of the cross (a very common action), among others that could be mentioned. John the Deacon uses light-dark imagery to explain exsufflation in exorcism as a transition:

  &lt;blockquote&gt;The exsufflated person is exorcised so that ... having been delivered from the power of darkness, he might be translated into the kingdom ... of God.&lt;ref&gt;Wilmart, 172; thence also in many of the Carolingian expositions, e.g. in Keefe's tet 32, ed. Friedrich Stegmüller, "Bischof Angilmodus über die Taufe...," Römische Quartalschrift für Christliche Altertumskunde und Kirchengeschichte 52 (1957): 20; and text 25, the tract by Archbishop Liedrad of Lyons, Patrologia Latina 99:856D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
So also Augustine ("The church exsufflates and exorcises [infants] that the power of darkness might be cast out from them"&lt;ref&gt;Contra Julianum (opus imperf.) 1.50, ed. Michaela Zelzer, [[Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum|CSEL]] 85/1 (Vienna, 1974), 43 (Patrologia Latina 45:1073) Cp. 3.182, CSEL 85/1, 482 (PL 45:1323); the Contra Julianum 1.4.14 (PL 44:649), 1.5.19 (PL 44:653), 3.3.8 (PL 44:705), 3.5.11 (PL 44:707-8), and 6.5.11 (PL 44:828-9); and the Ennarationes in Psalmos 76.4, ed. E. Dekkers and J. Fraipont, CCSL 39 (1956), 1055.&lt;/ref&gt;), and Isidore ("The power of the devil is ... exsufflated in them, so that ... being delivered from the power of darkness, [they] might be translated unto the kingdom of their Lord"&lt;ref&gt;De ecclesiastics officiis, II.xxi.3, ed. C. M. Lawson,  CCSL 113 (1989), 96/20-24 (PL 83:815A), and thence into various Carolingian texts, e.g. the Pseudo-Maxentius Collectanea (= Keefe text 37), PL 106:54C.&lt;/ref&gt;).

And as regards signation (the sign of the cross), in Western texts from as early as the [[Gelasian Sacramentary]], the one gesture almost always precedes (or precedes and follows) the other,&lt;ref&gt;Mohlberg, Sacramentarium Gelasianum 93 (§598) ("exsufflas in faciem eius et facis ei crucem in fronte"); the same doublet is applied to the baptismal water in the Gellone Sacramentary, ed. A. Dumas, Liber Sacramentorum Gellonensis, CCSL 159 (1981), 335 (§2317-18) and 346 (§2379), and in the North Italian rituals, ed. Lambot, 33. Signing precedes and follows in the Missale Gothicum, ed. Neale, 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; and their significance is often complementary if not identical. In [[Raban Maur]]'s discussion of the baptismal liturgy, for example, the exsufflation is said to expel the devil, the signing to keep him from coming back.&lt;ref&gt;Alois Knöpfler, ed., Rabani Mauri de institutione clericorum, Veröffentlichungen aus dem kirchen-historischen Seminar München 5 (Munich, 1900), I.xxvii, p. 48 (PL 107:311D-12A).&lt;/ref&gt; The two signs are frequently combined, the blowing done in the form of a cross, e.g. in the [[Syriac Chritianity|Syriac Rite]] described by [[James of Edessa]],&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, Documents, 59.&lt;/ref&gt; in the modern Coptic rite,&lt;ref&gt;Lodi, 1557&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 9th-century ''Ordo Romanus XXXI'',&lt;ref&gt;Andrieu, 3:502, §80 ("Anhelet in modum cruce").&lt;/ref&gt; in Wulfstan's Anglo-Saxon homilies and their [[Continental Europe|Continental]] sources,&lt;ref&gt;Wulfstan, Homilies (ed. Bethurum), Homily VIIIa, p. 16; Theodulf of Orleans, De ordine baptismi, PL 105:225B.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 10th-century Ambrosian rites for catechumen and font,&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, 143, 145&lt;/ref&gt; in the 11th-century North Italian catechumenal rites,&lt;ref&gt;Lambot, 5, 6, 11, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 12th- through 15th-century English pontificals,&lt;ref&gt;York Manual, 144* (11th century), 149* (12th century), 150* (13th century), and 153* (15th century).&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Sarum Missal]],&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Legg, ed., [[Sarum Missal]], 129.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 13th-century Roman pontifical.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Andrieu, Le Pontifical Romain au Moyen Age (Vatican City, 1940), 2:514.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extra-liturgical (hagiographic and magical) use==

===Patristic period===

There are hints in some of the Church Fathers that Christians had a habit of breathing (or hissing) at evil spirits as a recognized act of revulsion or repulsion, even apart from the ceremonies of the church. [[Tertullian]] is perhaps the best witness. He seems to be talking about an extra-liturgical casting out of demons by means of exsufflation and signing when he declares that gods rejected by Christians are driven from the bodies of men "by our touch and by our breath," and are thus "carried away by the thought and vision of the fire [of judgment]."&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, Apologeticus, 23.15-16, ed. Henricus Hoppe, CSEL 69 (1939), 67; trans. by [[A. Souter]], Apology (Cambridge, 1917), 82/83. Cp. De Anima, 1.5, ed. J. W. Ph. Borleffs, CCSL 2 (1954), 782.&lt;/ref&gt; He is talking about an ordinary gesture of aversion when he asks a Christian incense-dealer (regarded as hypocritical because he sells incense for [[polytheism|polytheistic]] altars), "with what mouth, I ask, will he spit and blow before the fuming altars for which he himself provided? with what constancy will he [thus] exorcise his foster children?"&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, De idolatria XI.7, ed. and tr. [[J. H. Waszink]] and J. C. M. Van Winden, Vigiliae Christianae Supplements 1 (Leiden, 1987), 42-5 (commentary, 210); also ed. J. W. Ph. Borleffs, CCSL 2 (1954), 111; trans. S. Thelwall, Ante-Nicene Fathers, 3:68.&lt;/ref&gt; And his remarks to his wife about the dangers of mixed marriage suggest that exsufflation was a distinctively Christian practice:{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}&lt;!--see talk--&gt; "[If you marry again, to a non-Christian,] shall you escape notice when you sign your bed or your body? when you blow away some impurity? When even by night you rise to pray?"&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, Ad uxorem suam II.v.3, ed. and trans. Claude Munier, Tertullien: "A son Epouse," Sources Chrétiennes 273 (Paris, 1980), 138 (CCSL 1 (1954), 389; PL 1:1296); trans. Thelwall, Ante-Nicene Fathers 4:46.&lt;/ref&gt;

If such a custom did exist, it would clarify certain remarks by other Fathers, which might otherwise seem merely metaphorical. [[Eusebius]], for example, says of the saints that they were men "who though they only breathed and spoke, were able to scatter the counsels of evil demons."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Church History (Eusebius)|Historia Ecclesiastica]]'' VII.x.4, ed. Eduard Schwartz, Eusebius Werke 2.2, Griechischen Christlichen Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte, 9 (Leipzig, 1908), 650 (Patrologia Graeca 20:659/60); trans. Arthur C. McGiffert, Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, 1:298.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] describes the right response to [[Gnostic]] doctrine as "reviling" (καταφυσησαντας; literally ''exsufflantes'').&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' 1.16.3, ed. A. Rousseau and Louis Doutreleau, Contre les Hérésies 1, Sources Chrétiennes 263 (Paris, 1978), 262-3.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyril of Jerusalem]], speaking of resisting temptation, not of baptism, says that "the mere breathing of the exorcist becomes as a fire to that unseen foe."&lt;ref&gt;Catechesis 16.19, Patrologia Graeca 33:945/6A-B; trans. Gifford, Nicene Fathers, 2nd series, 7:120.&lt;/ref&gt; And Augustine's remarks about blowing on [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)|images of the emperor]] suggest that the significance of the gesture was well enough established to be actionable: "Of the great crime of [[Law of majestas|lese majesty]] ... is he held guilty, according to the laws of this world, who blows upon an image ... of the emperor."&lt;ref&gt;Contra Julianum, opus imperf. 3.199, CSEL 85/1:498 (PL 45:1333).&lt;/ref&gt; Even as late as [[Bede]], we may suspect that "exsufflate" in the sense of "revile" or "cast off" may be a living metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Historia ecclesiastica, in Charles Plummer, ed., Baedae opera historica (Oxford, 1896), 1:2231 and 1:7; cp. 2:226n.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hagiography==

The extremely influential ''Life of [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]]'' by [[Sulpicius Severus]] seems to have set in motion a [[hagiography|hagiographic]] tradition in which saints cast out demons or repel tempting devils by blowing at them.&lt;ref&gt;Vita Sancti Martini, ed. Carl Halm, CSEL 1.206-7 (cp. the Old English version in [[Ælfric of Eynsham|Ælfric]], Lives of the Saints, ed. W. W. Skeat, EETS 76 (1890), 292-3 (II.xxxi.42)).&lt;/ref&gt; Of Saint [[Pachomius]], for example, it is said that "defending his brow with the sign of the cross, he blew upon [the demon] and immediately he fled … ; blowing upon him, he said, 'depart from me, devil.'"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in a note to Benedict of Aniane's Concordia regularum, PL 103:1020C-D.&lt;/ref&gt; And of [[Saint Goswin]] that "a demon stood before Saint Goswin saying 'surely you see that I am Christ …' and … therefore Saint Goswin exsufflated vigorously, saying 'depart foe …,' and immediately … the devil vanished."&lt;ref&gt;Anecdota ex codicibus hagiographicis Iohannis Gielemans canonici regularis in rubea valle prope Bruxelles, ed. Hagiographi Bollandiani (Brussels, 1895), 23 (Sanctilogium 9.2).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyprian and Justina|Saint Justina]] is reported to have similarly unmasked a series of increasingly subtle and powerful demons, finally melting the prince of demons himself: "blowing upon the devil, she immediately melted him like wax and … felt herself freed from all temptation."&lt;ref&gt;Th. Graese, ed., Jacobi Voragine Legenda Aurea …, 3rd ed. (Vratislaviae, 1890), cap. cxlii (p. 634; cp. 633).&lt;/ref&gt; And [[Saint Felix]] is said to have destroyed [[Cult image|idols]] and uprooted [[sacred tree]]s by like means.&lt;ref&gt;Graesse, ed., Legenda Aurea, cap. cxxvi (p.575) and cap. xix (102-3).&lt;/ref&gt;

The breath of the saints was credited with healing, as well as exorcistic, powers from an early period. [[Gregory of Nyssa]] says of [[Gregory Thaumaturgus]] ('Gregory the magician') that he needed to resort to "no finicking  and laborious" magic, but "there sufficed, for both the casting out of demons and the healing of bodily ailments, the breath of his mouth."&lt;ref&gt;PG 46:943/4A.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar powers are attributed to the Irish saints: kindling lamps, curing dumbness.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Plummer, ed., Vitae Sanctorum Hiberniae (Oxford, 1910), 1:clxxviii.&lt;/ref&gt; This theme, too, persists in later hagiographic and quasi-hagiographic texts, appearing, for example in the ''Estoire del saint graal'' as the agency by which a madman is miraculously restored. Among English texts, Felix's ''Life of [[Saint Guthlac]]'' relates that in order to give relief to a boy afflicted by madness, he "washed him in the water of the sacred font and, breathing into his face the breath of healing [or 'spirit of salvation'], drove away from him all the power of the evil spirit,"&lt;ref&gt;Bertram Colgrave, ed. and trans., Felix's Life of Saint Guthlac (Cambridge, 1956), 130/31.&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the difficulty of distinguishing healing from exorcism in an era in which madness was attributed to demonic possession. The miracle that Bishop John performed, according to [[Bede]], on behalf of [[Herebald]], is another example, since it involved a sufflation that was seemingly exorcistic, catechetical, and curative simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Bede, Historia ecclesiastica 5.6 (Plummer, 291; see also B. Colgrave and R. A. B. Myonrs, Bede's Ecclesastical History (Oxford, 1969), 468 note.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magic and folk medicine==

[[Tertullian]] remarked to his wife about Christian practices: "will you not seem to be doing magic?" in the eyes of a non-believer.&lt;ref&gt;Ad uxorem II.v.3 (ed. Munier, 138). For additional references to blowing in ancient magic, see Waszink's and Van Winden's notes to Tertullian's De idolatria, 210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Celsus]] (according to [[Origen]]) reports the use of exsufflation by Egyptian magicians.&lt;ref&gt;Origen, ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' 1.68, ed. Marcel Borret, Origène: "Contre Celse," 1, Sources Chrétiennes 132 (Paris, 1967), 266 (PG 11:787/788A).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plotinus]] seems to attack its use by Roman ones.&lt;ref&gt;Plotinus, Enneads, II.ix.14, ed. and trans. [[A. H. Armstrong]], Loeb Classical Library, vol. 2 (Cambridge, Mass., 1966), pp. 278/9.&lt;/ref&gt; One of [[Lucian]]'s tall tales mentions a Chaldean pest-control sorcerer who causes toads and snakes to vanish by blowing on them.&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Macleod, ed., Luciani opera, vol. 2 (Oxford, 1974), 182; trans. in "The Liar," The Works of Lucian of Samosata, trans. H. W. and F. G. Fowler, vol. 3 (Oxford, 1905), 236.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is possible to see Jesus himself as a supernatural healer (Christ Jesus the son of God), in many popular events of [[the holy Bible]], in which he is constantly healing many blind, lame, crippled, lepers, maimed, and even causing his own resurrection, just to name a few. In one instance Jesus used his spit to heal the eyes of a blind man who was born blind, caused by his parents sins;&lt;ref&gt;Gospel of John, KJV text, John 9:1-9:11.&lt;/ref&gt;
. However, regarding magic, in Syria, where ceremonial breathing became formalized as part of the rite of visitation of the sick. [[Ephraem Syrus]] advises that "if medicine fails you when you are sick, the 'visitors' will help, will pray for health, and one of them will breathe in your mouth, the other will sign you [with the sign of the cross]."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Döger, Exorzismus, 125n.&lt;/ref&gt;

If it was either originally Christian (citation needed), Catholic or from the pagan practices, almost similar methods of healing have been reported, continuing until modern times: in Westphalia, the healing of a wound by triple signing and triple cruciform sufflation, or by exsufflation accompanied by a rhyming charm; and in Holland the alleviation of toothache by similar means.&lt;ref&gt;Dölger, 125.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Drechsler, "Illnesses were blown away by the breath. If a child had bumped himself, one would blow three times on the place and it would 'fly away.'"&lt;ref&gt;Paul Drechsler, Sitte, Brauch, und Volksglaube im Schlesien, vol. 2 (Leipzig, 1906), 280. Cp. 298 and chapter 14, ''passim.''&lt;/ref&gt; Burns, and conditions that in some fashion resemble burns, such as fevers, boils, sore throats and rashes, are naturally the most common objects of blowing among modern folk-remedies,&lt;ref&gt;See HddA, i, ''s.v.'' "Blasen," cols. 1357-58. See also from the Puckett collections nos. 6943, 8329, and 8401 (alleviation of a burn); 2750, 2889, 2890, 10566, and 2898 (thrush and sore mouth); and 9277 and 9279 (erysipelas): Popular Beliefs and Superstitions: A Compendium of American Folklore from the...Collection of Newbell Niles Puckett, ed. Wayland D. Hand, Anna Casetta, and Sondra B. Thiederman, 3 vols. (Boston, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt; for example the Shetland cure that requires blowing on a burn three times while reciting the charm "Here come I to cure a burnt sore. / If the dead knew what the living endure, / The burnt sore would burn no more."&lt;ref&gt;[[T. F. Thiselton-Dyer]], ''English Folklore'', 2nd rev. ed. (London, 1880), 170.&lt;/ref&gt; But everything from jaundice, convulsions, and colic to bad luck and evil spells can apparently be alleviated by a bit of blowing.&lt;ref&gt;HddA, ''loc. cit.''; cp. also the Puckett collection, nos. 23714, 23956, 23957, 9215, 25571, 19545, 9563, etc.&lt;/ref&gt; Wolters points out that exorcistic blowing was still (in 1935) found in the custom of blowing over bread that is about to be eaten.&lt;ref&gt;Wolters cites Drechsler 2:15, a passage that describes how to avert the bad luck of biting into a piece of bread already bitten.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover,

&lt;blockquote&gt;A Syrian blows over his child to avert the evil eye. Some still&lt;br/&gt;blow three times over a strange spoon before using it, and in Alaska the medicine&lt;br/&gt;man blows into the nose and mouth of a patient to drive out the daemon of disease.&lt;ref&gt;Xavier F. M. G. Wolters, Notes on Antique Folklore on the basis of Pliny's "Natural History" Bk. XXVIII.22-29 (Amsterdam, 1935), 102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
Finally, in one American example of superstition clearly derived from liturgical use, it is said that if at the baptism of a baby one turns at the door and blows three times, one can successfully prevent the devil from ever coming between the baby and the altar.&lt;ref&gt;Puckett Collection, no. 3294 (reported from Cleveland, Ohio, 1956).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Isabel San Sebastián Cabasés''' (born 15 March 1959) is a Spanish journalist and writer.

==Biography==
===Early years===
The daughter of a Spanish diplomat, Isabel San Sebastián was born in [[Santiago]], Chile. Her ancestry is Basque and Navarrese, and she is the cousin of Pamplona politician {{ill|Iñaki Cabasés|es}}. After graduating in Information Sciences from the [[Complutense University of Madrid]], she joined the newspaper ''{{ill|La Gaceta del Norte|es}}'' in [[Bilbao]]. From there she jumped to writing for national media such as the magazine ''[[Época (Spanish magazine)|Época]]'' and the newspaper ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'',&lt;ref name=entrevistadora&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://elpais.com/diario/1997/08/21/radiotv/872114417_850215.html |title=López-Amor ficha a Isabel San Sebastián como entrevistadora |trans-title=López-Amor Signs Isabel San Sebastián as an Interviewer |first=Rosario G. |last=Gómez |work=[[El País]] |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |date=21 August 1997 |access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she began to write the political column "El contrapunto", and where she remained from 1989 to 2000.

Her first contacts with the world of television were due to [[Jesús Hermida]], who brought her into the political [[tertulia]] of the programs he presented and hosted on [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]]: ''{{ill|Con Hermida y compañía|es|lt=Con Hermida y Cía}}'' (1995) and ''{{ill|La hora H|es}}'' (1996–1997). In the 1995–1996 season she also worked for [[Cadena SER]], both on ''{{ill|Hora 25 (radio program)|es|Hora 25 (programa de radio)|lt=Hora 25}}''&lt;ref name=entrevistadora/&gt; and ''[[Hoy por hoy]]''. 

===1997–1998===
In 1997, she went into public media at the request of the new [[RTVE]] director, {{ill|Fernando López-Amor|es}}.&lt;ref name=entrevistadora/&gt; At [[Radio Nacional de España]], she began to appear in September of that year, both on the recently launched morning program ''Buenos días con {{ill|Carlos Herrera Crusset|es|lt=Carlos Herrera}}'' and the nighttime program ''24 Horas''.

At [[Televisión Española]] (TVE), San Sebastián was offered the opportunity to present the interview show ''{{ill|El tercer grado|es|El tercer grado (programa de televisión)}}'' (which premiered with an interview with [[Ana Botella]], wife of then President [[José María Aznar]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://elpais.com/diario/1997/09/17/radiotv/874447204_850215.html |title=Ana Botella abre en TVE la serie de Isabel San Sebastián |trans-title=Ana Botella Opens Isabel San Sebastián's TVE Series |first=Rosario G. |last=Gómez |work=[[El País]] |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |date=17 September 1997 |access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; besides working on the morning news program ''[[Los Desayunos de TVE]]''.

===1998–2002===
In 1998, coinciding with the arrival of {{ill|Ernesto Sáenz de Buruaga|es}} at the network's news channel, she was hired by Antena 3 to replace {{ill|Antonio San José|es}} at the head of the morning news program ''{{ill|El primer café|es}}''.

At the same time, she started working at [[Onda Cero]], contributing to the programs ''A toda radio'' with [[Marta Robles]] and ''{{ill|Protagonistas (radio program)|es|Protagonistas|lt=Protagonistas}}'' with {{ill|Luis del Olmo|es}}.

In 2002 she was dismissed as the head of the program and relieved by {{ill|Carmen Gurruchaga|es}}. The exit was framed in the context of a tough confrontation between [[Pedro J. Ramírez]], director of the newspaper ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'' and [[César Alierta]], president of [[Telefónica]], majority shareholder of the network at that time.&lt;ref name=despide&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2002/11/26/sociedad/1038328953.html |title=Alierta despide a San Sebastián de Antena 3, que es sustituida por Carmen Gurruchaga |trans-title=Alierta Dismissed San Sebastián from Antena 3, Who is Replaced by Carmen Gurruchaga |work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |date=27 November 2002 |access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the journalist herself, who worked in both media (she had joined the editorial staff of ''El Mundo'' in March 2000), she was pressured to leave the newspaper. Faced with her refusal, Antena 3 acted, in her words, "repressing her."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.elperiodicoextremadura.com/noticias/television/antena-3-echa-a-isabel-san-sebastian-de-el-primer-cafe-_26278.html |title=Antena 3 echa a Isabel San Sebastián de 'El primer café' |trans-title=Antena 3 Throws Isabel San Sebastián Off 'El primer café' |first=Joan |last=Barrera |work=El Periódico Extremadura |language=Spanish |date=27 November 2002 |access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002–2006===
At that moment, [[Luis Herrero-Tejedor Algar|Luis Herrero]] on [[Cadena COPE]] and [[María Teresa Campos]] on television, both critics of the way in which the journalist was fired, offered her a spot on their respective political tertulias. Isabel San Sebastián was thus brought onto ''{{ill|La Mañana (radio program)|es|La Mañana (radio)|lt=La Mañana}}'' on COPE&lt;ref name=despide/&gt; and ''{{ill|Día a día (Spanish TV program)|es|Día a día (España)|lt=Día a día}}'' on [[Telecinco]].

In the 2004–2005 season she led the political program ''El Debate'' on [[Telemadrid]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/07/06/comunicacion/1120641981.html |title=Isabel San Sebastián da por hecho que no volverá a 'El Debate' de Telemadrid la próxima temporada |trans-title=Isabel San Sebastián Assumes that She Will Not Return to Telemadrid's 'El Debate' Next Season |first=Charo |last=Marcos |work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |date=6 July 2005 |access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; joining the María Teresa Campos team the following year, this time on Antena 3: first in September 2005, for the season of ''{{ill|Cada día (TV program)|es|Cada día|lt=Cada día}}'', and in 2006 on the short-lived show ''{{ill|Lo que inTeresa|es}}''.

That same season of 2004, when [[Federico Jiménez Losantos]] replaced Herrero at the head of ''La Mañana'', Isabel San Sebastián opted to follow Luis del Olmo in his latest radio venture and joined the new edition of ''Protagonistas'' on {{ill|Punto Radio|es}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/09/01/comunicacion/1094045244.html |title=Punto Radio se estrena con la intención de convertirse en la segunda en el índice de audiencias |trans-title=Punto Radio Debuts with the Intention of Becoming Second in the Audience Index |first=Raquel |last=Quílez |work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |date=1 September 2004 |access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007–present===
[[File:Isabel San Sebastián en la presentación de su libro 'Un reino lejano' (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|At the presentation of her fourth novel, ''Un reino lejano'', on 15 November 2012]]
In 2007 she participated in the political tertulias of the TVE program ''{{ill|59 segundos|es}}'' and Telemadrid's ''Alto y Claro''. On the latter, a verbal clash with the journalist {{ill|José María Calleja|es}} led to him leaving the show that January. At the beginning of November of the same year, it was Isabel San Sebastián who left the set of ''59 segundos'' due to the allegations that Calleja had leveled at her, accusing her of "having fattened [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]". Due to this she filed a legal claim for protection of honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://elpais.com/elpais/2007/11/08/actualidad/1194513417_850215.html |title=Bronca entre San Sebastián y Calleja en '59 segundos' |trans-title=Row Between San Sebastián and Calleja on '59 segundos' |work=[[El País]] |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |date=7 November 2007 |access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, the Court of First Instance ordered Calleja to pay €12,000 to San Sebastián.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/07/29/comunicacion/1280434517.html |title=Condenan a José María Calleja a pagar 12.000 euros a Isabel San Sebastián |trans-title=José María Calleja Ordered to Pay 12,000 Euros to Isabel San Sebastián |work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]] |location=Madrid |language=Spanish |date=4 August 2010 |access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling was overturned by the [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] in November 2014, which "placed the conflict in the field of freedom of expression and the right to honor, and concluded that this was prevalent in this case inasmuch as the accused journalist limited himself to making a criticism regarding a subject of interest and in a context of previous confrontation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.eldiario.es/politica/Supremo-Calleja-Isabel-Sebastian-ETA_0_321617951.html |title=El Supremo ampara a Calleja por acusar a Isabel San Sebastián de 'engordar a ETA' |trans-title=The Supreme Court Protects Calleja for Accusing Isabel San Sebastián of 'Fattening ETA' |first=Irene |last=Castro |work=[[Eldiario.es]] |language=Spanish |date=6 November 2014 |access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://confilegal.com/20141105-supremo-da-razon-calleja-enfrentamiento-isabel-san-sebastian-05112014-1411/ |title=El Supremo da la razón a Calleja en su enfrentamiento con Isabel San Sebastián |trans-title=The Supreme Court Agrees with Calleja in His Confrontation with Isabel San Sebastián |work=Confilegal |language=Spanish |date=5 November 2014 |access-date=28 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jeanie MacPherson''' (May 18, 1886&lt;ref name="Abbie Jean Macpherson - Massachusetts Births"&gt;{{cite web|title=Abbie Jean Macpherson - Massachusetts Births|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:FXDL-P5R|website=[[FamilySearch]]|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; – August 26, 1946) was an American actress, writer, and director from 1908 until the late 1940s. She was a pioneer for women in the film industry. She worked with some of the best filmmakers of the time period including [[D. W. Griffith]] and [[Cecil B. DeMille]]. While she started in the theater, and then had a brief stint as an actress, she ultimately dedicated her life's work to screenwriting for DeMille.&lt;ref name=jeann/&gt; She was appraised for her new level resourcefulness and attentiveness to the needs of DeMille.&lt;ref name=fem/&gt;

==Early life==
MacPherson was born '''Abbie Jean Macpherson'''&lt;ref name="Abbie Jean Macpherson - Massachusetts Births"/&gt; in [[Boston]] to a wealthy family. Her parents were John S. Macpherson and Evangeline C. Tomlinson.&lt;ref name="Abbie Jean Macpherson - Massachusetts Births"/&gt; She was a petite, spirited girl of Spanish, Scottish, and French descent.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Literary Biography"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=Randall|title=American Screenwriters|journal=Dictionary of Literary Biography|date=1986|volume=44|issue=2nd|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a teenager she was sent to Mademoiselle DeJacque's school in paris but was forced to leave when her family fell on hard times. She then returned to the United States and began to look for a job.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Literary Biography"/&gt;

It was back in the United States that MacPherson finished her degree from the prestigious Kenwood Institute in [[Chicago]]. It was there, in the windy city of Chicago, where she started her career as a dancer and stage performer. She began her theatrical career in the chorus of the Chicago Opera House. Over the next few years she took singing lessons and took whatever theater-related jobs that she could find.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Literary Biography" /&gt; However, she quickly became infatuated with film.&lt;ref name=jeann&gt;"Lowry, Carolyn. ''The First One Hundred Noted Men and Women of the Screen''"&lt;/ref&gt;

She was quoted as saying, "All I knew was that I wanted to act. Then someone told me about motion pictures, how drama was filmed. I was fascinated. I like mechanics anyway. I hunted all over New York for a studio&amp;mdash;and couldn't find one. At last a super told me a man named Griffith was doing pictures for the Biograph Company. Mr. Griffith wasn't in. His assistant was. I told him my stage experience. He ignored it, scorned it. 'We want to know what you can do before a camera.'"&lt;ref name= fem&gt;Casella, Donna. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/105092090503303#tabModule ''Feminism and the Female Author: The Not So Silent Career of the Woman Scenarist in Hollywood — 1896–1930''], tandfonline.com; accessed December 19, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
She made her film debut in 1908 with a short film called the ''[[Fatal Hour]]'' directed by [[D. W. Griffith]]. For the next year she acted in many controversial roles in which she had to portray ethnicities other than her own for Griffith's films. MacPherson had dark hair, so she was often cast in gypsy or Spanish roles, even though she was of Scotch and French origin. From 1908 to 1917 she is accredited with 146 acting credits. She was quoted as looking back on her time with Griffith as her "first glimmer of the possibilities in the new industry [and] from those days on [she had] seen a variety of attitudes toward the script writers."&lt;ref name=fem/&gt;

After Griffith, she went on to the old Universal Company where she was a leading lady.&lt;ref name=jeann/&gt; She got her first real opportunity here in 1913, when she wrote, directed, and starred in, ''[[The Tarantula]]'' (1913) for them. She played the role of a Spanish-Mexican girl, known as the tarantula, whom would get men to become obsessed with her and then once she had their infatuation, she would get bored of them and kill them with a tarantula bite. Due to this film she became the youngest director in motion picture history. The film concluded her directing career. She continued at the old Universal Company for two years until her health caused her to break from the company.&lt;ref name=jeann/&gt; Upon her recovery she found herself at Lasky Studios, however, she quickly sought out [[Cecil B. DeMille]] to see if she could act in his films. He told her, "I am not interested in star Macpherson but I am in writer Macpherson";&lt;ref name=jeann/&gt; from that point on, she solely focused on writing.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

DeMille and MacPherson formed what became one of the most influential and long-lasting partnerships in the industry.&lt;ref name=fem/&gt; She was infatuated with his perfection and force of will, while he was captivated by her high spirited courage. She penned 30 of DeMille's next 34 films. They admired each other; he would provide the crowd shots and epic sense, while she would humanize the heroine. They both loathed weakness, which they defined as a man being degraded and women, who were shallow and money-hungry, looking for a man to take care of them. They both believed in the power of people to change their ways, which many of their scripts showed.&lt;ref name=fem/&gt;

Some of their most notable works are ''[[Rose of the Rancho]]'' (1914) with [[Bessie Barriscale]], ''[[The Girl of the Golden West (1915 film)|The Girl of the Golden West]]'' with [[Mabel Van Buren]], ''[[The Cheat (1923 film)|The Cheat]]'' (1915) with [[Sessue Hayakawa]], ''[[The Golden Chance]]'' (1915) with [[Wallace Reid]], ''[[Joan the Woman]]'' (1916) with [[Geraldine Farrar]], ''[[A Romance of the Redwoods]]'' (1917) with [[Mary Pickford]], ''[[The Little American]]'' again with Pickford, and ''[[The Woman God Forgot]]'' (1917) again with Farrar.

She thoroughly believed that as motion picture owes its psychology to D. W. Griffith, it owes its dramatic picture scenario construction to that of DeMille.&lt;ref name=jeann/&gt; Through her pen as a female scenarist she was able to give women a voice in the film writing industry.&lt;ref name=fem/&gt; In 1927, she was one of the founding members of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=jeann/&gt;

==Personal life==
The outside world was very skeptical of MacPherson and DeMille's relationship, as some believed that they may be having an affair. In 1921, MacPherson told a reporter, "I shall always be grateful for Mr. DeMille's assistance. He is a hard taskmaster and he demands that a thing shall be perfect... It was hard, but it taught me that anything worth doing at all was worth doing perfectly."&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Literary Biography"/&gt; It was later confirmed by DeMille's niece that MacPherson was in fact one of his three mistresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jeanie Macpherson profile|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-jeanie-macpherson|website=Women Film Project|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was obsessed with flying, and would try to do so daily. She bragged about being the only woman having piloted the plane of the late [[Ormer Locklear|Lieutenant Locklear]], the world’s greatest stunt flier. He gave her the utmost confidence in her skill.&lt;ref name=jeann/&gt;

In 1946, MacPherson became ill with cancer while researching ''[[Unconquered]]'' (1947), a historical drama, and had to stop work.&lt;ref name="Dictionary of Literary Biography"/&gt; She died that August in [[Los Angeles]] at age 60, and was buried at the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery]] in [[Hollywood]]. She was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] located at 6150 Hollywood Blvd.&lt;ref name=jeann/&gt;

'''{{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}''' ("The Origin of the World") is a picture painted in oil on canvas by the French artist [[Gustave Courbet]] in 1866. It is a close-up view of the [[genitals]] and [[abdomen]] of a naked woman, lying on a bed with legs spread. The framing of the nude body, with head, arms and lower legs outside of view, emphasizes the [[eroticism]] of the work.

== History ==
=== Identity of the model ===
[[File:The Origin of the World (upper section).jpg|thumb|Putative upper section of ''L'Origine du monde'']]
Art historians have speculated for years that Courbet's model for {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} was his favourite model, [[Joanna Hiffernan]], also known as ''Jo''. Her lover at the time was the American painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|James Whistler]], a friend of Courbet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/25/joanna-hiffernan-courbet-nude-lorigine-du-monde |title=Who posed for the 'Mona Lisa of vaginas'? |last=Jones |first=Jonathan |author-link=Jonathan Jones (journalist) |date=25 September 2018 |website=The Guardian |access-date=2018-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gustave Courbet - Jo, la belle Irlandaise (MET-Museum).jpg|thumb|''La belle Irlandaise (Portrait of Jo)'' by Courbet: Joanna Hiffernan, possible model for ''L'Origine du monde'']]
Hiffernan was the subject of a series of four portaits by Courbet entitled [[Jo, the Beautiful Irishwoman|''La belle Irlandaise (Portrait of Jo)'']] painted in 1865-66. The possibility that she was the model for {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}&lt;ref name=tele /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Benoit|last1=Noël|first2=Jean|last2=Hournon|title=Parisiana – La capitale des peintres au XIX&lt;sup&gt;ème&lt;/sup&gt; siècle|publisher=Les Presses Franciliennes|chapter=Gustave Courbet – L'Origine du Monde, 1866|page=37|isbn=9782952721400|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that she was having an affair with Courbet might explain Courbet's and Whistler's brutal separation a short while later.&lt;ref name=Kosinski&gt;Dorothy M. Kosinski, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1483342 Gustave Courbet's ''The Sleepers.'' The Lesbian Image in Nineteenth Century French Art and Literature], Artibus et Historiae, Vol. 9, No. 18  (1988), p.187&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of Hiffernan's [[red hair]] contrasting with the darker pubic hair of {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}, the hypothesis that Hiffernan was the model continues. Redhead Jacky Colliss Harvey puts forward the idea that the woman's body-hair suggests a more obvious candidate might be the brunette painted with Hiffernan in Courbet's ''[[Le Sommeil]]''; and that the identification with Hiffernan has been greatly influenced by the eroticised and sexualised image of the female redhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = RED: A History of the Redhead|last = Colliss Harvey|first = Jacky|publisher = Black Dog &amp; Leventhal|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-57912-996-5|location = New York|pages = 119-120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Melle Queniaux opéra (ballet) par Nadar (1820-1910).jpg|thumb|left|Constance Quéniaux, possible model for ''L'Origine du monde'']]
In February 2013, ''[[Paris Match]]'' reported that Courbet expert Jean-Jacques Fernier had authenticated a painting of a young woman's head and shoulders as the upper section of {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} which according to some was severed from the original work. Fernier has stated that because of the conclusions reached after two years of analysis, the head will be added to the next edition of the Courbet [[catalogue raisonné]].&lt;ref name=tele&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/9854914/Amateur-art-buff-finds-35-million-head-of-Courbet-masterpiece.html "Amateur art buff finds £35 million head of Courbet masterpiece"] by Henry Samuel, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Paris Match]]|title=''L'Origine du monde'': Le secret de la femme cachée|url=http://www.parismatch.com/Culture-Match/Art/Actu/L-Origine-du-monde-de-Gustave-Courbet-Le-secret-de-la-femme-cachee-463132/|date=7 February 2013|language=French|access-date=2013-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130415141855/http://www.parismatch.com/Culture-Match/Art/Actu/L-Origine-du-monde-de-Gustave-Courbet-Le-secret-de-la-femme-cachee-463132/|archive-date=2013-04-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Musée d'Orsay]] has indicated that ''L'Origine du monde'' was not part of a larger work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/9860793/Has-the-head-of-The-Origin-of-the-World-been-found.html|title=Has the head of The Origin of the World been found? |work= The Telegraph|date=10 February 2013|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that "experts at the [French] art research centre CARAA (Centre d'Analyses et de Recherche en Art et Archéologie) were able to align the two paintings via grooves made by the original wooden frame and lines in the canvas itself, whose grain matched."&lt;ref name=tele /&gt; According to CARAA, it performed pigment analyses which were identified as classical pigments of the 2nd half of the 19th century. No other conclusions were reported by the CARAA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caraa.fr/EN/detail-actu.php?actu=18 "Summary of analytical report – Painting on canvas, portrait of a woman"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217201825/http://www.caraa.fr/EN/detail-actu.php?actu=18 |date=2015-02-17 }}, Centre d'Analyses et de Recherche en Art et Archéologie, 7 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The claim reported by ''Paris Match'' was characterized as dubious by ''[[Le Monde]]'' art critic [[Philippe Dagen]], indicating differences in style, and that canvas-similarities could be caused by buying from the same shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2013/0209/1224329840770.html|title=Art collector claims to have found top part of Courbet's ''Origin of the World''|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=11 February 2013|date=9 February 2013|author=Ruadhán Mac Cormaic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Documentary evidence however links the painting with [[Constance Quéniaux]], a former dancer at the [[Paris Opera]] and a mistress of the Ottoman diplomat [[Halil Şerif Pasha]] (Khalil Bey) who commisioned the painting. According to the historian Claude Schopp and the head of the [[French National Library]]'s prints department, Sylvie Aubenas, the evidence is found in correspondence between [[Alexandre Dumas fils]] and [[George Sand]].&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/sep/25/origin-of-gustave-courbet-scandalous-painting-revealed |title=Mystery solved?

=== Owners ===
Halil Şerif Pasha (Khalil Bey) is believed to have commissioned the work shortly after he moved to Paris. [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]] introduced him to Courbet and he ordered a painting to add to his personal collection of erotic pictures, which already included {{Lang|fr|[[The Turkish Bath|Le Bain turc]]}} (''The Turkish Bath'') from [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] and another painting by Courbet, ''[[Le Sommeil]]'' (''The Sleepers''), for which it is supposed that Hiffernan was one of the models.
[[File:Halil Sherif Pasha.jpg|thumbnail|left|Halil Şerif Pasha (Khalil Bey) commissioned the painting.]]
After Khalil Bey's finances were ruined by gambling, the painting subsequently passed through a series of private collections. It was first bought during the sale of the Khalil Bey collection in 1868, by antique dealer Antoine de la Narde. [[Edmond de Goncourt]] hit upon it in an antique shop in 1889, hidden behind a wooden pane decorated with the painting of a castle or a church in a snowy landscape. According to [[Robert Fernier]], who published two volumes of the Courbet catalogue raisonné and founded the [[Musée Courbet]], Hungarian collector Baron [[Ferenc Hatvany]] bought it at the [[Bernheim-Jeune]] gallery in 1910 and took it with him to Budapest. Towards the end of the [[Second World War]] the painting was looted by [[Red Army|Soviet troops]], but later ransomed by Hatvany. Hatvany left Hungary, which was on the brink of a Communist takeover, in 1947. He was allowed to take only one art work with him, and he took {{Lang|fr|L'Origine}} to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnews.com/2008/02/01/the-mysterious-journey-of-an-erotic-masterpiece/ "The Mysterious Journey of an Erotic Masterpiece"] by Konstantin Akinsha, ''[[ARTnews]]'', 1 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} was sold at auction for 1.5 million francs, about 4,285 US dollars at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.measuringworth.com/datasets/exchangeglobal/result.php?year_source=1955&amp;year_result=1955&amp;countryE%5B%5D=France|title=Measuring Worth - Relative Worth Comparators and Data Sets|website=www.measuringworth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its new owner was the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]]. He and his wife, actress [[Sylvia Bataille]], installed it in their country house in [[Guitrancourt]]. Lacan asked [[André Masson]], his stepbrother, to build a double bottom frame and draw another picture thereon. Masson painted a surrealist, allusive version of {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Lacan and the Matter of Origins'' by Shuli Barzilai, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacan.com/courbet.htm|title=courbet - origin of the world|website=www.lacan.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York public had the opportunity to view {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} in 1988 during the ''Courbet Reconsidered'' show at the [[Brooklyn Museum]]; the painting was also included in the exhibition ''Gustave Courbet'' at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 2008. After Lacan died in 1981, the French Minister of Economy and Finances agreed to settle the family's [[inheritance tax]] bill through the transfer of the work ({{Lang|fr|[[Acceptance in lieu|"Dation en paiement"]]}} in French law) to the [[Musée d'Orsay]]; the transfer was finalized in 1995.

=== Provocative work ===
During the 19th century, the display of the nude body underwent a revolution whose main activists were Courbet and [[Édouard Manet|Manet]]. Courbet rejected academic painting and its smooth, idealised nudes, but he also directly recriminated the hypocritical social conventions of the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]], where [[eroticism]] and even [[pornography]] were acceptable in [[mythology|mythological]] or [[oneiric]] paintings.

Courbet later insisted he never lied in his paintings, and his [[realism (arts)|realism]] pushed the limits of what was considered presentable. With {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}, he has made even more explicit the eroticism of Manet's ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]''. [[Maxime Du Camp]], in a harsh tirade, reported his visit to the work's purchaser, and his sight of a painting "giving realism's last word".{{sfn|Du Camp|1878|p=190}}

[[File:Courbet-origine-monde.jpg|thumb|{{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} in the {{Lang|fr|Musée d'Orsay}}]]
By the very nature of its realistic, graphic nudity, the painting still has the power to shock and triggers censorship.

Although moral standards and resulting taboos regarding the artistic display of nudity have changed since Courbet, owing especially to [[photography]] and [[film|cinema]], the painting remained provocative. Its arrival at the Musée d'Orsay caused high excitement. According to postcard sales, {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} is the second most popular painting in the Musée d'Orsay, after [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir's]] ''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/reviews/arts_and_commentary/article759415.ece|title=The history of ''The Origin of the World''| location=London|work=The Times Literary Supplement|first=Mark|last=Hutchinson|date=8 August 2007}} {{Subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics maintain that the body depicted is not (as has been argued) a lively erotic portray of a female but of a corpse: "''L’Origine'' does not represent a full female body but rather a slice of one, cut off by the frame [...]. The pallidness of the skin and the mortuary gauze surrounding the body suggest death."{{sfn|Uparella|Jauregui|2018|p=95}}

== Influence ==
The explicitness of the picture may have served as an inspiration, albeit with a satirical twist, for [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s last major work, ''[[Étant donnés]]'' (1946–1966), a construction also featuring the image of a woman lying on her back with her legs spread.&lt;ref&gt;[http://toutfait.com/femalic-molds/ "Femalic Molds"], The Marcel Duchamp Studies Online Journal (toutfait.com), 1 April 2003/5 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, French artist [[Orlan]] created the [[cibachrome]] ''L'origine de la guerre'' (''The Origin of War''), a male version of ''L'origine du monde'' showing a [[penile erection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loeildelaphotographie.com/2013/11/27/exhibition/23329/orlan-l-origine-de-la-guerre-orsay-masculin-masculin |title=ORLAN: L’origine de la Guerre |last= |first= |date= |website=The Eye of Photography |publisher= |access-date=2018-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1994, the novel {{Lang|fr|Adorations perpétuelles}} (''Perpetual Adorations'') by {{Interlanguage link multi|Jacques Henric|fr}} reproduced {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} on its cover. Police visited several French bookshops to have them withdraw the book from their windows. A few proprietors maintained the book, but others complied, and some voluntarily removed it.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Brazilian artist [[Vik Muniz]] created two versions of the famous painting. "The first [1999] is a photograph made of dust or dirt, which plays with the common moralist association between female genitalia and filth. In the second piece [2013], Muniz remakes ''L’Origine'' from an assemblage of journal clippings that are reminiscent of the anatomic and artistic procedure of cutting that produced [...] the female body."{{sfn|Uparella|Jauregui|2018|pp=103-105}}

''Two Origins of the World'' (2000) by Mexican artist [[Enrique Chagoya]] "recycles ''L’Origine du monde'' as a spectral backdrop behind three solid black, blue and white squares of canvas in three of the corners of the painting. In the foreground of the bottom right corner, an indigenous man sits at a fourth canvas, this one on an easel, apparently 'interpreting' the Courbet painting."{{sfn|Uparella|Jauregui|2018|p=105}}

In 2002, American artist [[Jack Daws]] created an homage to the painting. Entitled ''Origins of the World'', it is a collection of various photographs of vulvas, taken from pornographic magazines, and framed in montage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gregkucera.com/daws_sculpture.htm |title=Jack Daws Sculpture |website=Greg Kucera Gallery, Inc. |publisher= |access-date=2018-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British artist [[Anish Kapoor]] created an installation in 2004 called ''L'Origine du monde'', which references Courbet's painting. The piece is in the [[21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art, Kanazawa]] in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kanazawa21.jp/data_list.php?g=97&amp;d=78&amp;lng=e|title=金沢21世紀美術館|website=金沢21世紀美術館}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image is also referenced as inspiring [[Catherine Breillat]]'s filming of the female genitalia in her 2004 film {{Lang|fr|Anatomie de l'enfer}} (''[[Anatomy of Hell]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arkepix.com/kinok/Catherine%20BREILLAT/breillat_interview.html "Catherine Breillat, cinéaste"] {{Webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20091004064647/http://www.arkepix.com/kinok/Catherine%20BREILLAT/breillat_interview.html |date=2009-10-04 }}, interview by Laurent Devanne, [[Radio libertaire]] (1 February 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbian [[performance art]]ist [[Tanja Ostojić]] parodied the work in a poster in 2005, informally called the "EU panties" poster. Like Courbet's painting, the poster proved controversial, and was ultimately removed from the art exhibition in which it was originally displayed.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

On February 23, 2009 in [[Braga]], Portugal, [[Polícia de Segurança Pública|the police]] confiscated the book ''Pornocratie'' by Catherine Breillat, displayed in bookshops using {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} as its cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A great deal of controversy was sparked by the police action. The reason given was the need to maintain public order. Also, the book title incorrectly hinted at pornographic content. Portuguese law forbids public displays of pornography.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 2010, British composer [[Tony Hymas]] composed {{Lang|fr|De l'origine du monde}} a [[Suite (music)|musical suite]] dedicated to the picture as well as relations between Courbet and the [[Paris Commune]], based on texts by Courbet himself, [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Pierre Dupont]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In February 2011, [[Facebook]] censored {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} after it was posted by Copenhagen-based artist Frode Steinicke, to illustrate his comments about a television program aired on DR2. Following the incident, many other Facebook users defiantly changed their profile pictures to the Courbet painting in an act of solidarity with Steinicke. Facebook, which originally disabled Steinicke's profile, finally re-enabled it without the {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}} picture. As the case won media attention, Facebook deleted other pages about the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Greenberg [http://cornellsun.com/node/46245 "Facebook, Censorship and Art"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105104721/http://cornellsun.com/node/46245 |date=2011-11-05 }}, ''Cornell Daily Sun'', 8 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dépêche AFP du 17/02/10 [https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jvF1OWi_2s8sEFr2VEnAUYozmU0g?docId=CNG.9ddadf8072b82cd68b8e61e1dcc3a108.7e1 "''L'Origine du monde'' de Courbet interdit de Facebook pour cause de nudité"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, again, a complaint was lodged against Facebook with the [[Tribunal de grande instance de Paris]] (Paris court of general jurisdiction) by a French Facebook user after his profile was disabled for showing a picture of {{Lang|fr|L'Origine du monde}}. The picture was a link to a television program aired on [[Arte]] about the history of the painting. As he got no answer to his emails to Facebook, he decided to lodge a complaint for "infringement of freedom of expression" and against the legality of Facebook's terms which define the courts located in Santa Clara County, California, as the exclusive place of jurisdiction for all litigating claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/l-origine-du-monde-assigne-facebook-en-justice-24-10-2011-1388626_3.php "''L'Origine du monde'' assigne Facebook en justice"], ''[[Le Point]]'', 24 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2016, the Paris court ruled that Facebook could be sued in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/facebook-faces-trial-in-france-over-nudity-censorship-case-a6871791.html "Facebook in landmark censorship case after banning French user who posted naked artwork" ''The Independent'' 13 February 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German-born Turkish artist [[Taner Ceylan]] has painted a work named ''1879 (From the Lost Paintings Series)'' (2011) in which a veiled Ottoman noblewoman stands before the framed canvas of ''L'Origine du monde''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Garreth|title=Up front and personal: Turkish artist Taner Ceylan|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d14ba7c-2d23-11e4-8105-00144feabdc0|accessdate=4 October 2017|work=Financial Times|date=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Taner Ceylan 1879 (FROM THE LOST PAINTING SERIES)|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2011/contemporary-art-turkish-l11221/lot.14.html|publisher=Sothebys|accessdate=4 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2014, a Luxembourg performance artist, [[Deborah De Robertis]], sat on the floor in front of the painting and mimicked the view of the subject. This resulted in security guards closing the room and her arrest.{{sfn|Uparella|Jauregui|2018|pp=82-83}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/artist-arrested-again-for-nude-stunt-in-front-of-manets-olympia-in-paris-gallery-a6819886.html|title=An artist has been arrested (again) for a nude stunt in a Paris gallery|date=18 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

US artist [[Candice Lin]] recreated ''L’Origine du monde'' in a video of her an audiovisual sculpture ''Hunter Moon / Inside Out'' (2015). In it, ''Courbet’s L’Origine du monde with eyes'' "looks back at the onlookers." From a feminist point of view, Lin's work challenges "the asymmetry of power [...] between those who look and those who are seen."{{sfn|Uparella|Jauregui|2018|p=85}}

'''''Locke''''' is a 2013 British-American [[drama film]] written and directed by [[Steven Knight]]. The film stars [[Tom Hardy]] in the title role, the only character seen on screen, as he carries on a number of speakerphone conversations with characters voiced by [[Olivia Colman]], [[Ruth Wilson]], [[Andrew Scott (actor)|Andrew Scott]], [[Ben Daniels]], [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], and [[Bill Milner]]. 

The film premiered at [[Broad Street, Birmingham|Broad Street]] in [[Westside, Birmingham]] at the [[70th Venice Film Festival]] on 2 September 2013. The film had a limited release in the United Kingdom beginning on 18 April 2014, and grossed $5 million worldwide. ''Locke'' received critical acclaim, particularly for Hardy's performance, which won him the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor]].

==Plot==
The evening before he must supervise a large [[concrete]] pour in [[Birmingham]] (the largest non-nuclear facility concrete pour in European history), construction foreman Ivan Locke learns that Bethan, a colleague from a job in [[Croydon]] with whom he had a [[one-night stand]] seven months before (which resulted in her becoming pregnant), has gone into premature labour. Despite his job responsibilities and although his wife and sons are eagerly awaiting his arrival home to watch an important football match, Locke decides to drive to [[London]] to be with Bethan during childbirth. Locke never forgave his father for abandoning him as a child, and he is determined not to make the same mistake, even though he has no relationship with, nor any particular feelings for, Bethan.

Over the course of the two-hour drive from Birmingham to London, Locke holds a total of 36 phone calls with: his boss Gareth; his backup work colleague Donal; Katrina &amp;ndash; his wife of 15 years &amp;ndash; to confess his infidelity; his sons, Eddie and Sean, who call him separately with updates on the match and (eventually) the worrisome breakdown of their mother; St. Mary's maternity unit medical personnel, Sister Margaret then Dr. Gullu, who are working with Bethan through some troubling complications; the [[County_council#England|council head]], Cassidy, and local police authority, PC Davids, required for the road closures needed to allow the 225+ [[Concrete mixer#Trucks and trailers|concrete trucks]] to properly access the site; and with Bethan to reassure her during her labour. During these calls, he is fired from his job, banned from his house by his wife, and asked by his older son to please return home. He coaches his assistant Donal through preparing the pour despite some major setbacks, and has imaginary conversations with his dead father, whom he envisions (unseen onscreen) as a passenger in the car; he berates his father for abandoning Locke's family, and vows he will not repeat that mistake. When he is close to the hospital, Bethan calls to share the cooing of the baby, having had a successful birth.

==Production==
Almost the entire film takes place within a [[BMW X5]], which was pulled down the [[M6 motorway]] on a low flatbed trailer for most of the shoot. Shooting took place in real time, over just eight nights, with the crew only taking breaks to change the three cameras' memory cards.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/movies/locke-with-tom-hardy-is-a-minimalist-vehicle.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Movies&amp;module=RelatedCoverage&amp;region=Marginalia&amp;pgtype=article|title=A Road Movie, but With No Rest Stops|last=Murphy|first=Mekado|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 April 2014|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivan Locke is the only character to appear onscreen; the others are only heard on the vehicle's speakerphone, with their parts also recorded in real time (Locke's vehicle and road noise included) as they called from a conference room that served as the multiple "locations" of the various characters.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decoy.tvpassport.com/q_a/q-it-true-tom-hardy-did-entire-movie-himself-i-heard-him-mention-something-about-it-interview?subid=national-00001|title=Q &amp; A|last=Thomlison|first=Adam|publisher=TV Media|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 91% of 200 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 7.7/10. The critical consensus states: "A one-man show set in a single confined location, Locke demands a powerful performance – and gets it from a never-more-compelling Tom Hardy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/locke/|title=Locke (2014)|work=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film  has a score of 81 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 37 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/locke|title=Locke|work=Metacritic|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Olly Richards of ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' awarded the film 4/5 stars and said: "There are films to see on huge screens, but this is one that almost cries out for a small cinema, surrounded by total blackness. It's a daring experiment brilliantly executed, with Tom Hardy giving one of the best performances of his career".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Olly|last=Richards|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/review.asp?FID=138485|title=Locke|work=Empire|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''How to Watch a Movie'' (2015), [[David Thomson (film critic)|David Thomson]] singles out this film and says: "No film I've seen in recent years is more eloquent on where we are now, and on how alone we feel. There is little left but to watch and listen."

For his performance, Hardy won the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor|Best Actor Award]] from the [[Los Angeles Film Critics Association]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1315">The '''Metropolitan Opera House''' was a historic [[opera house]] located in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] located at 100 East Sixth Street. Plans to build the house began after the [[Grand Opera House (Saint Paul, Minnesota)|Grand Opera House]] burned down on January 21, 1889. Initial plans for the house were designed by [[Leroy Buffington]], but his plans were abandoned due to insufficient funds. Business tycoon [[Robert Mannheimer]] eventually came to the rescue, providing half a million dollars towards the project. New plans by [[Charles A. Reed]] were used for the house which was built over a few months in 1890. The opera house opened for business that year and served as Saint Paul's opera venue until 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uegmzT1auoQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA226&amp;lpg=RA1-PA226&amp;dq=St.+Paul+Metropolitan+Opera+House&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JxTiD7Z21E&amp;sig=IQQAyf6zlwaq5LqiEe3DCPtp0wU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pzdDStmZHIiwMMqzkasB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 Lost Twin Cities By Larry Millett at google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicolas Poussin''' ({{IPA-fr|nikɔlɑ pusɛ̃|lang}}; June 1594 – 19 November 1665) was the leading painter of the [[Classicism|classical]] [[French Baroque]] style, although he spent most of his working life in [[Rome]]. Most of his works were on religious and mythological subjects painted for a small group of Italian and French collectors.  He returned to Paris for a brief period to serve as [[First Painter to the King]] under Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu, but soon returned to Rome and resumed his more traditional themes. In his later years he gave growing prominence to the landscapes in his pictures.  His work is characterized by clarity, logic, and order, and favors line over color. Until the 20th&amp;nbsp;century he remained a major inspiration for such classically-oriented artists as [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] and [[Paul Cézanne]].

Details of Poussin's artistic training are somewhat obscure. Around 1612 he traveled to Paris, where he studied under minor masters and completed his earliest surviving works. His enthusiasm for the Italian works he saw in the royal collections in Paris motivated him to travel to Rome in 1624, where he studied the works of Renaissance and Baroque painters—especially [[Raphael]], who had a powerful influence on his style. He befriended a number of artists who shared his classicizing tendencies, and met important patrons, such as Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (seniore)|Francesco Barberini]] and the antiquarian [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]]. The commissions Poussin received for modestly scaled paintings of religious, mythological, and historical subjects allowed him to develop his individual style in works such as ''The Death of Germanicus'', ''The Massacre of the Innocents'', and the first of his two series of the ''[[Seven Sacraments (Poussin)|Seven Sacraments]]''.

He was persuaded to return to France in 1640 to be First Painter to the King but, dissatisfied with the overwhelming workload and the court intrigues, returned permanently to Rome after a little more than a year. Among the important works from his later years are ''Orion Blinded Searching for the Sun'', ''Landscape with Hercules and Cacus'', and ''The Seasons''.

==Biography==
=== Early years – Les Andelys and Paris ===
Nicolas Poussin's early biographer was his friend [[Giovanni Pietro Bellori]],&lt;ref&gt;His ''Lives of the Painters'' was published in Rome, 1672.&lt;/ref&gt; who relates that Poussin was born near [[Les Andelys]] in [[Normandy]] and that he received an education that included some Latin, which would stand him in good stead.  Another early friend and biographer, [[André Félibien]], reported that "He was busy without cease filling his sketchbooks with an infinite number of different figures which only his imagination could produce."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; His early sketches attracted the notice of [[Quentin Varin]], who passed some time in Andelys, but there is no mention by his biographers that he had a formal training in Varin's studio, though his later works showed the influence of Varin, particularly by their storytelling, accuracy of facial expression, finely painted drapery and rich colors.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents apparently opposed a painting career for him, and In or around 1612, at the age of eighteen, he ran away to Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrived in Paris during the regency of [[Marie de Medici]], when art was flourishing as a result of the royal commissions given by Marie de Medici for the decoration of her palace, and by the rise of wealthy Paris merchants who bought art. There was also a substantial market for paintings in the redecoration of churches outside Paris destroyed during the [[French Wars of Religion]], which had recently ended, and for the numerous convents in Paris and other cities. However, Poussin was not a member of the powerful guild of master painters and sculptors, which had a monopoly on most art commissions and brought lawsuits against outsiders like Poussin who tried to break into the profession.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; 

His early sketches gained him a place in the studios of established painters. He worked for three months in the studio of the [[Flanders|Flemish]] painter [[Ferdinand Elle]], who painted almost exclusively portraits, a genre that was of little interest to Poussin.&lt;ref name="Keazor_12"&gt;Keazor 2007, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved next to the studio of [[Georges Lallemand]], but Lallemand's inattention to precise drawing and the articulation of his figures apparently displeased Poussin.&lt;ref name="Keazor_12"/&gt; Moreover, Poussin did not fit well into the studio system, in which several painters worked on the same painting. Thereafter he preferred to work very slowly and alone.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of his life in Paris at this time. Court records show that he ran up considerable debts, which he was unable to pay. He studied anatomy and perspective, but the most important event of his first residence in Paris was his discovery of the royal art collections, thanks to his friendship with Alexandre Courtois, the ''valet de chambre'' of Marie de Medicis. There he saw for the first time engravings of the works of [[Giulio Romano]] and especially of [[Raphael]], whose work had an enormous influence on his future style.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson et al. 1992, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

He first tried to travel to Rome in 1617 or 1618, but made it only as far as Florence, where, as his biographer Bellori reported, "as a result of some sort of accident, he returned to France."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; On his return, he began making paintings for Paris churches and convents. In 1622 made another attempt to go to Rome, but went only as far as Lyon before returning. In the summer of the same year, he received his first important commission: the Order of [[Jesuits]] requested a series of six large paintings to honor the canonization of their founder, Saint [[Francis Xavier]]. The originality and energy of these paintings (since lost) brought him a series of important commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Giambattista Marino]], the court poet to [[Marie de Medici]], employed him to make a series of fifteen drawings, eleven illustrating [[Metamorphoses (poem)|Ovid's ''Metamorphoses'']]&lt;ref name="Brigstocke"&gt;Brigstocke.&lt;/ref&gt; and four illustrating battle scenes from Roman history. The "Marino drawings", now at [[Windsor Castle]], are among the earliest identifiable works of Poussin.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers 2009, p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; Marino's influence led to a commission for some decoration of Marie de Medici's residence, the [[Luxembourg Palace]], then a commission from the first Archbishop of Paris, [[Jean-François de Gondi]], for a painting of the death of the Virgin (since lost) for the Archibishop's family chapel at the Cathedral of [[Notre-Dame de Paris]].  Marino took him into his household, and, when he returned to Rome in 1623, invited Poussin to join him. Poussin remained in Paris to finish his earlier commissions, then arrived to Rome in the spring of 1624.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 20–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Poussin was thirty when he arrived in Rome in 1624. The new Pope, [[Urban VIII]], elected in 1623, was determined to maintain the position of Rome as the artistic capital of Europe, and artists from around the world gathered there. Poussin could visit the churches and convents to study the works of [[Raphael]] and other Renaissance painters, as well as the more recent works of [[Carracci]], [[Guido Reni]] and [[Caravaggio]] (whose work Poussin detested, saying that Caravaggio was born to destroy painting).&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied the art of painting nudes at the Academy of [[Domenichino]], and frequented the Academy of Saint Luke, which brought together the leading painters in Rome, and whose head in 1624 was another French painter, [[Simon Vouet]], who offered lodging to Poussin.&lt;ref&gt;In a census of 1624 (Friedlaender)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Poussin became acquainted with other artists in Rome and tended to befriend those with classicizing artistic leanings: the French sculptor [[François Duquesnoy]] whom he lodged with in 1626; the French artist [[Jacques Stella]]; [[Claude Lorraine]]; Domenichino; [[Andrea Sacchi]]; and joined an informal academy of artists and patrons opposed to the current [[Baroque]] style that formed around [[Joachim von Sandrart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=721350&amp;partId=1 The British Museum: Collection online]&lt;/ref&gt;
Rome also offered Poussin a flourishing art market and an introduction to an important number of art patrons. Through Marino, he was introduced to Cardinal [[Francesco Barberini (seniore)|Francesco Barberini]], the brother of the new Pope, and to [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], the Cardinal's secretary and a passionate scholar of ancient Rome and Greece, who both later became his important patrons. The new art collectors demanded a different format of paintings;  instead of large altarpieces and decoration for palaces, they wanted smaller-size religious paintings for private devotion or picturesque landscapes, mythological and history paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The early years of Poussin in Rome were difficult. His patron Marino departed Rome for Naples in May 1624, shortly after Poussin arrived, and died there in 1625. His other major sponsor, Cardinal Francesco Barberini, was named a papal legate to Spain and also departed soon afterwards, taking Cassiano dal Pozzo with him. Poussin became ill with [[syphilis]], but refused to go to the hospital, where the care was extremely poor, and he was unable to paint for months. He survived by selling the paintings he had for a few ecus. Thanks to the assistance of a chef, Jacques Dughet, whose family took him in and cared for him, he largely recovered by 1629, and in 1630 he married Anne-Marie Dughet, the daughter of Dughet.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; His two brothers-in-law were artists, and [[Gaspard Dughet]] later took Poussin’s surname.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt 1958, p.55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardinal Barberini and Cassiano dal Pozzo returned to Rome in 1626, and by their patronage Poussin received two major commissions. In 1628, with a commission from Cardinal Barberini, he completed his first masterwork, ''The Death of Germanicus'' ([[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]). It was partly inspired by the reliefs of the Meleager sarcophagus.&lt;ref&gt;The Meleager sarcophagus seen by Poussin is that now in the Capitoline Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1628 he received an even more prestigious commission to paint an altarpiece, the ''Martyrdom of St. Erasmus'', for the Erasmus Chapel of the Vatican (now in the Vatican Pinacoteca). This commission was originally given to [[Pietro da Cortona]], but when negotiations broke down between the Vatican and [[Guido Reni]] for another painting in the Chapel of the Holy Sacrament, da Cortona replaced Reni and Poussin was given Holy Sacrament commission.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Poussin drew upon the original design of Pietro da Cortona but painted the work in his own style.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt 1958, pp. 55, 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Martyrdom of St. Erasmus'' was the only Vatican commission Poussin received, but it established his reputation as a major painter.  With the departure of Vouet from Rome in 1627, Poussin became the most prominent French painter in Rome. Until 1630, he had painted rapidly ("with the fury of a demon", Marino recorded)&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; and produced large numbers of pictures of variable quality. Thereafter, he renounced seeking commissions for large decorative works, which were prestigious but required competitions and came with many restrictions, and concentrated instead on painting for art patrons and collectors, for whom he could work more slowly and develop his own subjects and style. In 1632 he bought a life interest in a small house on Via Paolina for his wife and himself and entered his most productive period.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Cardinal Barberini, his notable patrons in this period included Cassiano dal Pozzo, for whom he painted the first series of ''Sacraments''; the Chanoine Gian Maria Roscioli, who bought several important works, including ''The Young Pyrrhus Saved''; Cardinal Rospigliosi, for whom he painted the second version of ''The Shepherds of Arcadia''; [[Innocent X|Cardinal Luigi Omodei]], for whom he produced the ''Triumphs of Flora'' (c. 1630–32, [[Louvre]]); [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]], for whom he painted the ''Massacre of the Innocents'', and the jewel thief and art swindler, Fabrizio Valguarnera, who bought ''[[The Plague at Ashdod]]'' and commissioned ''The Empire of Flora''.  He also received his first commissions from France; first from the Marechal de Crequi, the French envoy to Italy, then a commission from [[Cardinal de Richelieu]] for a series of ''Bacchanales''.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
As the work of Poussin became well-known in Rome, he received invitations to return to Paris for important royal commissions, proposed by Sublet de Noyers, the Superintendent of buildings for [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]].  When Poussin declined, Noyers sent his cousins, Roland Fréart de Chambray and Paul Fréart, to Rome to persuade Poussin to come home, offering him the title of First Painter to the King, plus a substantial residence at the Tuileries Palace. Poussin yielded, and in December 1640 he was back in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

The correspondence of Poussin to Cassiano dal Pozzo and his other friends in Rome show that he was appreciative of the money and honors, but he was quickly overwhelmed by a large number of commissions, particularly since he had taken the habit of working slowly and carefully. His new projects included ''The Institutions of the Eurcharist'' for the chapel of the [[Chateau of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], and ''The Miracle of Saint Francis-Xavier'' for the altar of the church of the novitiate of the Jesuits. In addition, he was asked to the ceilings and vaults for the Grand gallery of the Louvre, and to paint a large allegorical work for the study of Cardinal Richelieu, on the theme ''Time Defending Truth from the Attacks of Harmony and Discord'', with the figure of "Truth" clearly standing for Cardinal Richelieu. He was also expected to provide designs for royal tapestries and the front pieces for books from the royal printing house.  He was also subjected to considerable criticism from the partisans of other French painters, including his old friend Simon Vouet. He completed a painting of the ''Last Supper'' (now in the Louvre), eight cartoons for the [[Gobelins manufactory|Gobelins]] tapestry manufactory, drawings for a proposed series of [[grisaille]] paintings of the ''Labors of Hercules'' for the Louvre, and a painting of the ''Triumph of Truth'' for Cardinal Richelieu (now in the Louvre).  He was increasingly unhappy with the court intrigues and the overwhelming number of commissions. In the autumn of 1642, when the King and court were out of Paris in [[Languedoc]], he found a pretext to leave Paris and to return permanently to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 33–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
When he returned to Rome in 1642, he found the art world was in transition. Pope Urban VIII died in 1644, and the new Pope, [[Innocent X]], was less interested in art patronage, and preferred Spanish over French culture. Poussin's great patrons, the Barberinis, departed Rome for France. He still had a few important patrons in Rome, including Cassiano dal Pozzo and the future Cardinal Camillo Massimi, but began to paint more frequently for the patrons he had found in Paris. Cardinal Richelieu died in 1632, and Louis XIII died in 1643, and Poussin's Paris sponsor, Sublet de Noyer, lost his position, but Richelieu's successor, [[Cardinal Mazarin]], began to collect Poussin's works. In October 1643, Poussin sold the furnishings of his house in the Tuileries in Paris, and settled for the rest of his life in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1647, [[André Félibien]], the secretary of the French Embassy in Rome, became a friend and painting student of Poussin, and published the first book devoted entirely to his work. His growing number of French patrons included the Abbé Louis Fouquet, brother of [[Nicolas Fouquet]], the celebrated superintendent of finances of the young Louis XIV.  In 1655 Fouquet obtained for Poussin official recognition of his earlier title as First Painter of the King, along with payment for his past French commissions. To thank Fouquet, Poussin made designs for the baths Fouquet was constructing at his chateau at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important French patron of Poussin in this period was [[Paul Fréart de Chantelou]], who came to Rome in 1643 and stayed there for several months. He commissioned from Poussin some of his most important works, including the second series of the ''[[Seven Sacraments (Poussin)|Seven Sacraments]]'', painted between 1644 and 1648, and his  ''Landscape with Diogenes''.&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1649 he painted the ''Vision of St Paul'' for the comic poet [[Paul Scarron]], and in 1651 the ''Holy Family'' for the [[Créquy family|duc de Créquy]]. Landscapes had been a secondary feature of his early work;  in his later work nature and the landscape was frequently the central element of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 42–45.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
He lived an austere and comfortable life, working slowly and apparently without assistants. The painter [[Charles Le Brun]] joined him in Rome for three years, and Poussin's work had a major influence on Le Brun's style. In 1647, his patrons Chantelou and Pointel requested portraits of Poussin. He responded by making two self-portraits, completed together in 1649.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He suffered from declining health after 1650, and was troubled by a worsening tremor in his hand, evidence of which is apparent in his late drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, in his final eight years he painted some of the most ambitious and celebrated of his works, including ''The Birth of Bacchus'', ''Orion Blinded Searching for the Sun'', ''Landcape with Hercules and Cacus'', the four paintings of ''The Seasons'' and ''Apollo in love with Daphé''. 

His wife Anne-Marie died in 1664, and thereafter his own health sank rapidly. On 21 September he dictated his will, and he died in Rome on 19 November 1665 and was buried in the church of [[San Lorenzo in Lucina]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200px&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
Each one of Poussin's paintings told a story. Though he had little formal education, Poussin became very knowledgeable in the nuances of religious history, mythology and classical literature, and, usually after consulting with his clients, took his subjects from these topics. Many of his paintings combined several different incidents, occurring at different times, into the same painting, in order to tell the story, and the ''affetti'', or facial expressions of the participants, showed their different reactions.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from his self-portraits, Poussin never painted contemporary subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, David.

===Religion===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Religion was the most common subject of his paintings, as the church was the most important art patron in Rome and because there was a growing demand by wealthy patrons for devotional paintings at home. He took a large part of his themes from the [[Old Testament]], which offered more variety and the stories were often more vague and gave him more freedom to invent.  He painted different versions of the stories of [[Eliazer]] and [[Rebecca]] from the [[Book of Genesis]] and made three versions of ''Moses saved from the waters''. The [[New Testament]] provided the subject of one of his most dramatic paintings, "The Massacre of the Innocents", where the general slaughter was reduced to a single brutal incident. In his ''Judgement of Solomon'' (1649), the story can be read in the varied facial expressions of the participants.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

His religious paintings were sometimes criticized by his rivals for their variation from tradition. His painting of Christ in the sky in his painting of Saint-Francis-Xavier was criticized by partisans of [[Simon Vouet]] for having "Too much pride, and resembling the god Jupiter more than a God of Mercy". Poussin responded that "he could not and should not imagine a Christ, no matter what he is doing, looking like a gentle father, considering that, when he was on earth among men, it was difficult to look him in the face".&lt;ref&gt;Félibien cited by Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous of his religious works were the two series called ''[[Seven Sacraments (Poussin)|The Seven Sacraments]]'', representing the meaning of the moral laws behind each of the principal ceremonies of the church, illustrated by incidents in the life of Christ.  The first series was painted in Rome by his major early patron, [[Cassiano dal Pozzo]], and was finished in 1642. It was viewed by his later patron, [[Paul Fréart de Chantelou]], who asked for a copy.  Instead of making copies, Poussin painted an entirely new series of paintings, which was finished by 1647. The new series had less of the freshness and originality of the first series, but was striking for its simplicity and austerity in achieving its effects; the second series illustrated his mastery of the balance of the figures, the variety of expressions, and the juxtaposition of colors.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mythology and classical literature===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Classical Greek and Roman mythology, history and literature provided the subjects for many of his paintings, particularly during his early years in Rome. His first successful painting in Rome, ''The Death of Germanicus'', was based upon a story in the ''Annals'' of [[Tacitus]]. In his early years he devoted a series of paintings, full of color, movement and sensuality, to the Bacchanals, colorful portrayals of ceremonies devoted to the god of wine [[Bacchus]], and celebrating the goddesses [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Flora (deity)|Flore]]. Many of his mythological paintings featured gardens and floral themes; his first Roman patrons, the Barberini family, had one of largest and most famous gardens in Rome.

Another of his early major themes was the ''Rape of the Sabine Women'', recounting how the King of Rome, [[Romulus]], wanting wives for his soldiers, invited the members of the neighboring Sabine tribe for a festival, and then, on his signal, kidnapped all of the women. He painted two versions, one in 1634, now in the Metropolitan Museum, and the other in 1637, now in the Louvre. He also painted two versions illustrating a story of Ovid in the ''Metamorphoses'' in which Venus mourning the death of [[Adonis]] after a hunting accident, transforms his blood into the color of the [[anemone]] flower.

Throughout his career, Poussin frequently achieved what the art historian [[Willibald Sauerländer]] terms a "consonance ... between the pagan and the Christian world".&lt;ref name="Sauerländer_2016"&gt;Sauerländer 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is ''The Four Seasons'' (1660–64), in which Christian and pagan themes are mingled: ''Spring'', traditionally personified by the Roman goddess [[Flora (deity)|Flora]], instead features Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden; ''Summer'' is symbolized not by [[Ceres (mythology)|Ceres]] but by the biblical [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]].&lt;ref name="Sauerländer_2016"/&gt;

In his later years, his mythological paintings became more somber, and often introduced the symbols of mortality and death. The last painting he was working on before his death was ''Apollo in love with Daphne'', which he presented to his patron, the future Cardinal Massimi, in 1665.  The figures on the left of the canvas, around Apollo, largely represented vitality and life, while those on the right, around Daphne, were symbols of sterility and death.  He was unable to complete the painting because of the trembling of his hand, and the figures on the right are unfinished.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;
===Poetry and allegory===
&lt;gallery mode="packed" heights="200px&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Besides classical literature and myth, he drew often from works of the romantic and heroic literature of his own time, usually subjects decided in advance with his patrons.  He painted scenes from the epic poem ''Jerusalem Delivered'' by [[Torquato Tasso]] (1544–1595), published in 1581, and one of the most popular books in Poussin's lifetime.  His painting ''Renaud and Armide'' illustrated the death of the Christian knight Arnaud at the hands of the magician Armide. who, when she saw his face, saw her hatred turn to love. Another poem by Tasso with a similar theme inspired ''Tancred and Hermiene''; a woman finds a wounded knight on the road, breaks down in tears, then finds the strength through love to heal him.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 94–100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegories of death are common in Poussin's work,  One of the best-known examples is ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]'', a subject he painted in about 1630 and again in the late 1630s. Idealized shepherds examine a tomb inscribed with the title phrase, "Even in [[Arcadia (paradise)|Arcadia]] I exist", reminding that death was ever-present.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fertile source for Poussin was Cardinal Giulio Rospigliosi, who wrote moralistic theatrical pieces which were staged at the Palace Barberini, his early patron. One of his most famous works, [[A Dance to the Music of Time (painting)|''A Dance to the Music of Time'']], was inspired by another Rospigliosi piece.  According to his early biographers Bellori and Felibien, the four figures in the dance represent the stages of life: Poverty leads to Work, Work to Riches, and Riches to Luxury; then, following Christian doctrine, luxury leads back to poverty, and the cycle begins again. The four women who dance represent the different stages and are distinguished by their different clothing and headdresses, ranging from plain to jeweled. In the sky over the dancing figures, the chariot of Apollo passes, accompanied by the Goddess Aurora and the Hours, a symbol of passing time.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg and Temperini, pp. 101–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscapes and townscapes===

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Poussin is an important figure in the development of [[Landscape art|landscape]] painting. In his early paintings the landscape usually forms a graceful background for a group of figures, but later the landscape played a larger and larger role and dominated the figures, illustrating stories, usually tragic, taken from the Bible, mythology, ancient history or literature.  His landscapes were very carefully composed, with the vertical trees and classical columns carefully balanced by the horizontal bodies of water and flat building stones, all organized to lead the eye to the often tiny figures. The foliage in his trees and bushes is very carefully painted, often showing every leaf.  His skies played a particularly important part,  from the blue skies and gray clouds with bright sunlit borders (a sight often called in France "a Poussin sky") to illustrate scenes of tranquility and the serenity of faith, such as the ''Landscape with Saint Jean at Patmos'', painted in the late 1630s before his departure for Paris; or extremely dark, turbulent and threatening, as a setting for tragic events, as in his ''Landscape with Pyramus and Thisbe'' (1651). Many of his landscapes have enigmatic elements noticeable only with closer inspection; for example, in the center of the landscape with Pyramus and Thisbe, despite the storm in the sky, the surface of the lake is perfectly calm, reflecting the trees.{{Sfn|Rosenberg and Temperini|1994|pages=109–127}}

Between 1650 and 1655, Poussin also painted a series of paintings now often called "townscapes",  where classical architecture replaces trees and mountains in the background. The painting ''The Death of Saphire'' uses this setting to illustrate two stories simultaneously; in the foreground, the wife of a wealthy merchant dies after being chastised by St. Peter for not giving more money to the poor; while in the background another man, more generous, gives alms to a beggar.{{Sfn|Rosenberg and Temperini|1994|pages=109–127}}

==Style and method==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Throughout his life Poussin stood apart from the popular tendency toward the decorative in French art of his time. In Poussin's works a survival of the impulses of the [[Renaissance]] is coupled with conscious reference to the art of [[classical antiquity]] as the standard of excellence. Rejecting the emotionalism of Baroque artists such as [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]] and [[Pietro da Cortona]], he emphasized the cerebral.&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt; His goal was clarity of expression achieved by ''disegno'' or ‘nobility of design’ in preference to ''colore'' or color.&lt;ref&gt;Pace.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1620s and 1630s, he experimented and formulated his own style. He studied the Antique as well as works such as [[Titian]]’s [[Bacchanal]]s (''[[The Bacchanal of the Andrians]]'', ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'', and ''[[The Worship of Venus]]'') at the [[Casino di Villa Boncompagni Ludovisi|Casino Ludovisi]] and the paintings of [[Domenichino]] and [[Guido Reni]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt 1958, pp. 54–59.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast to the warm and atmospheric style of his early paintings, Poussin by the 1630s developed a cooler palette, a drier touch, and a more stage-like presentation of figures dispersed within a well defined space.&lt;ref name="Brigstocke" /&gt; In ''The Triumph of David'' (c. 1633–34; [[Dulwich College]] Picture Gallery), the figures enacting the scene are arranged in rows that, like the architectural facade that serves as the background, are parallel to the picture plane.&lt;ref name="Brigstocke" /&gt; The violence of ''The Rape of the Sabine Women'' (c. 1638; Louvre) has the same abstract, choreographed quality seen in ''[[A Dance to the Music of Time (painting)|A Dance to the Music of Time]]'' (1639–40).&lt;ref name="Brigstocke" /&gt;

Contrary to the standard studio practice of his time, Poussin did not make detailed figure drawings as preparation for painting, and he seems not to have used assistants in the execution of his paintings.&lt;ref name="Brigstocke" /&gt; He produced few drawings as independent works, aside from the series of drawings illustrating Ovid's Metamorphoses he made early in his career. His drawings, typically in pen and [[ink wash]], include landscapes drawn from nature to be used as references for painting, and composition studies in which he blocked in his figures and their settings. To aid him in formulating his compositions he made miniature wax figures and arranged them in a box that was open on one side like a theatre stage, to serve as models for his composition sketches.&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Rosenberg]] described Poussin as "not a brilliant, elegant, or seductive draughtsman. Far from it. His lack of virtuosity is, however, compensated for by uncompromising rigour: there is never an irrelevant mark or a superfluous line."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Pierre. "Poussin Drawings from British Collections. Oxford". ''The Burlington Magazine'', vol. 133, no. 1056, 1991, pp. 210–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In the years following Poussin's death, his style had a strong influence on French art, thanks in particular to [[Charles LeBrun]], who had studied briefly with Poussin in Rome, and who, like Poussin, became a court painter for the King and later the head of the French Academy in Rome. Poussin's work had an important influence on the 17th-century paintings of [[Jacques Stella]] and [[Sébastien Bourdon]], the Italian painter [[Pier Francesco Mola]], and the Dutch painter [[Gerard de Lairesse]].&lt;ref&gt;Wright 1985, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
A debate emerged in the art world between the advocates of Poussin's style, who said the drawing was the most important element of a painting, and the advocates of Rubens, who placed color above the drawing.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 604. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], Poussin's style was championed by [[Jacques-Louis David]] in part because the leaders of the Revolution looked to replace the frivolity of French court art with Republican severity and civic-mindedness. The influence of Poussin was evident in paintings such as ''[[The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons|Brutus]]'' and ''[[Death of Marat]]''. [[Benjamin West]], an American painter of the 18th century who worked in Britain, found inspiration for his canvas of ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' in Poussin's ''The Death of Germanicus''.&lt;ref&gt;Facos 2011, pp. 32, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th century brought a resurgence of enthusiasm for Poussin. One of his greatest admirers was [[Ingres]], who studied in Rome and became Director of the French Academy there. Ingres wrote, "Only great painters of history can paint a beautiful landscape. He (Poussin) was the first, and only, to capture the nature of Italy. By the character and taste of his compositions, he proved that such nature belonged to him; so much so that when facing a beautiful site, one says, and says correctly, that it is "Poussinesque".{{Sfn|Rosenberg and Temperini|1994|page=149}} 

Another 19th-century admirer of Poussin was Ingres' great rival, [[Eugène Delacroix]]; he wrote in 1853: "The life of Poussin is reflected in his works; it is in perfect harmony with the beauty and nobility of his inventions...Poussin was one of the greatest innovators found in the history of painting. He arrived in the middle of the school of mannerism, where the craft was preferred to the intellectual role of art. He broke with all of that falseness".{{Sfn|Rosenberg and Temperini|1994|pages=147–148}} 

[[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]] appreciated Poussin's version of classicism. "Imagine how Poussin entirely redid nature, that is the classicism that I mean. What I don't accept is the classicism that limits you. I want that a visit to a master will help me find myself. Every time I leave a Poussin, I know better who I am."{{Sfn|Rosenberg and Temperini|1994|pages=147–148}}  Cézanne was described in 1907 by [[Maurice Denis]] as "the Poussin of Impressionism".&lt;ref&gt;Russell 4 November 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Georges Seurat]] was another [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] artist who admired the formal qualities of Poussin's work.&lt;ref&gt;Clay, Jean. (1973). ''Impressionism''. Paris: Hachette Réalités. p. 273. {{ISBN|2010066235}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 20th century, some art critics suggested that the analytic [[Cubist]] experiments of [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Georges Braque]] were also founded upon Poussin's example.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkin.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 Picasso based a series of paintings on Poussin's ''The Rape of the Sabine Women''. [[André Derain]],&lt;ref&gt;Cowling, Elizabeth; Jennifer Mundy (1990). ''On Classic Ground: Picasso, Léger, de Chirico and the New Classicism 1910–1930''. London: Tate Gallery. pp. 93–93. {{ISBN| 1-854-37043-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Hélion]],&lt;ref&gt;Hélion, Jean (2004). ''Jean Hélion''. London: Paul Holberton Pub. pp. 20–21. {{ISBN|1-903470-27-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Balthus]],&lt;ref&gt;Rewald, Sabine (1984). ''Balthus''. New York: Harry N. Abrams, publ. p. 82. {{ISBN|0870993666}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Hugo]] were other modern artists who acknowledged the influence of Poussin. [[Markus Lüpertz]] made a series of paintings in 1989–90 based on Poussin's works.&lt;ref&gt;Keazor 2007, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The finest collection of Poussin's paintings today is at the [[Louvre]] in Paris.  Other significant collections are in the National Gallery in London; the National Gallery of Scotland; the [[Dulwich Picture Gallery]]; the [[Château de Chantilly|Musée Condé, Chantilly]]; the [[Hermitage Museum]], St. Petersburg; and the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.

'''Plop art''' (or '''Plonk art''') is a pejorative [[slang]] term for [[public art]] (usually large, abstract, modernist or contemporary sculpture) made for government or corporate plazas, spaces in front of office buildings, skyscraper atriums, parks, and other public venues. The term connotes that the work is unattractive or inappropriate to its surroundings—that is, it has been thoughtlessly "plopped" where it lies. ''Plop art'' is a play on the term [[pop art]]. According to artnet.com, ''plop art'' was coined by architect [[James Wines]] in 1969. The derisive term was eagerly taken up both by progressives (like Wines) and by conservatives. Progressives were critical of the failure of much public art to take an environmentally-oriented approach to the relationship between public art and architecture. Conservatives liked the term because it suggested something ugly, formless, and meaningless, produced without any real skill or care. The very word "plop" suggested something falling wetly and heavily in the manner of excrement—extruded, as it were, from the fundament of the art world, and often at public expense.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

"Right now architecture and sculpture are calling to each other, and calling for response that's intelligent, not for more ghastly lumps of sculpture ... which have no sense of scale and are just plonked down in public places." — [[Anthony Caro]] (1924–2013), English sculptor.&lt;ref&gt;From an interview with Tim Marlowe for ''Tate: The Art Magazine'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently{{when|date=April 2015}}, defenders of public art funding have tried to reclaim the term. The book ''Plop: Recent Projects of the Public Art Fund'', celebrates the success of the [[Public Art Fund]] in financing many publicly placed works of art over the last few decades, many of which are now beloved, though they may at first have been derided as "ploppings". Several currents or movements in [[contemporary art]], such as [[environmental sculpture]], [[site-specific art]], and [[land art]], counterpose themselves philosophically to "plop art," as well as to traditional public monumental sculpture.

'''Počitelj''' is a village in the [[Čapljina]] municipality in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. It is located in the [[Herzegovina-Neretva Canton]] in the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The historic site of Počitelj is located on the left bank of the river [[Neretva]], on the main [[Mostar]] to [[Metković]] road, and it is about 30 km to the south of [[Mostar]].

The village is built in  a natural [[karst]] amphiteatre along the Neretva river. The walled town of Počitelj evolved in the period from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Architecturally, the stone-constructed parts of the town are a [[Citadel Počitelj|fortified complex]], in which two stages of evolution are evident: medieval, and Ottoman.&lt;ref name="unesco"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5092/UNESCO: The historic urban site of Počitelj &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2016}}
The first recorded reference to Počitelj dates from 1444, in charters by King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] and in 1448 by [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]]. {{cn-span|It was mentioned as a fortified town  of the Dubrava district, ruled by Duke Stjepan Vukčič Kosača.|date=August 2016}} In the period between 1463-1471 the town housed a Hungarian garrison and was fortified into a strategic defence stronghold.  In 1471, following a brief siege, the town was conquered by the Ottomans. It lost its strategic significance. It remained within the [[Ottoman Empire]] until 1878. From 1782 to 1879 Počitelj was the seat of a''kadiluk'' (area under the jurisdiction of a [[qadi]], or judge) and the center of the Počitelj military district from 1713 to 1835.

The significance and the town's appearance has altered during the course of its history.  As far as the development of Počitelj goes, three significant periods can be distinguished: 
# The period of the Hungarian King [[Matthias Corvinus]] during which the town had a major strategic importance (1463–1471)
# The period of the settlement development under the Ottoman Empire with the erection of public buildings: mosques, [[imaret]], [[maktab]], [[madrasa]], [[Turkish bath|hamam]], [[caravanserai|han]] and the clock-tower (1471–1698). 
# The period after the Venetians conquered and destroyed [[Gabela]] (1698–1878), the main Ottoman fortification facing [[Dalmatia]], and recovery of Počitelj's strategic importance.

After the establishment of Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878, Počitelj lost its strategic importance and started deteriorating rapidly. The population declined gradually. The loss of the town's strategic role assisted in the preservation of the original urban architectural ensemble, so that the town remained in its original form to present day.

The entire historic urban site of Počitelj and surrounding area suffered extensive collateral damage during the 1992-1996 [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Namely, it was heavily damaged by Croatian forces during the 1993 [[Bosnian War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gort|first=Jerald|title=Religion, Conflict and Reconciliation: Multifaith Ideals and Realities|year=2002|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-1460-1|page=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="layton"&gt;{{cite book|last=Layton|first=Robert|title=Destruction and Conservation of Cultural Property|year=2001|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-21695-8|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sells"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sells|first=Michael|title=The Bridge Betrayed: Religion and Genocide in Bosnia|year=1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-21662-8|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the bombing, Počitelj's sixteenth-century master works of Islamic art and architecture were destroyed and a large part of the town's population was displaced.&lt;ref name="layton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sells"/&gt;

As proposed by the University of York, United Kingdom, and the University of Sarajevo, Počitelj was in 1996 named by the [[World Monuments Watch]] as one of the world's 100 most endangered cultural heritage sites.
In  the year 2000 the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Government initiated the Programme of the permanent protection of Počitelj. The programme includes the protection of cultural heritage from deterioration, restoration of damaged and destroyed buildings, encouraging the return of the refugees and displaced persons to their homes and the long-term protection and revitalization of the Počitelj's historic urban area. The Programme is on-going.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

As of 2008, the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) expressed concern over the proposed construction of a nearby highway, Corridor Vc.  Initial plans include a 1,000-meter long, 100-meter high bridge over the Neretva river.  It is feared that the construction will result in a “physical, visual and ecological degradation and devastation of this cultural and historical unity and its authentic surroundings.” &lt;ref&gt;ICOMOS Bosnia-Herzegovina (2008).

Berlin: hendrik Bäßler verlag, 2010, pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  While a new potential location for the bridge crossing is being investigated, non-controversial sections are under construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankwatch.org/sites/default/files/FFMReport_Vc_02Feb2010.pdf |title=Report from fact-finding mission on Corridor Vc motorway, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 23–25 February 2010 |author=Bankwatch Network |date= 18 July 2010 |accessdate=27 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historic sites==
* The '''Gavrakanpetanović house''': built at the end of the 16th century, it was named after and housed the captains of Počitelj, who belonged to the Gavrakanpetanovič family. It is typical example of the residential architecture of the village. It is the only house in town to have separate rooms for men and women. The house became the residence of an artists' colony between 1961 and 1975, one of which was the Italian painter [[Vittorio Miele]]. This was the longest operating artist colony in Southeast Europe. During the Bosnian war, the house was set on fire. It was restored in its original state in 2003.
* The '''Šišman Ibrahim-pašina džamija''' or '''Hajji Alija''' mosque: built in 1563 by Hajji-Alija, son of Musa. It was repaired in the 17th century by Šišman Ibrahim pasha. The locals gave the mosque afterwards his name. The domed mosque is notable for its special acoustics. The mosque was restored in the 1970s, but badly damaged during the Bosnian War in 1993. It was restored again in 2002.
* The '''Kula''', a silo-shaped fort overlooking the village from the top of the hill. It used to house watchmen and military as a guard against possible intrusions from the Neretva valley.
* The '''Sahat Kula''', a bell tower located closer to the river and at the south side of the old town.

No up-to-date data currently exists for Počitelj and its demographic profile was significantly altered after the Bosnian war. The last demographics research was conducted in 1991 and its results were as follows:

Population Total: 905&lt;ref&gt;Official results from the book: Ethnic composition of Bosnia-Herzegovina population, by municipalities and settlements, 1991. census, Zavod za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine - Bilten no.234, Sarajevo 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Muslims (nationality)|Muslims]] - 660 (72.92%)
* [[Croats]] - 172 (19.00%)
* [[Yugoslavs]] - 36 (3.97%)
* [[Serbs]] - 20 (2.20%)
* others and unknown - 17 (1.87%)

== Significance ==
Počitelj represents one of the few urban ensembles in Bosnia and Herzegovina that were preserved in their integrity to the present times. It was also developed through the several phases of the history beginning with the medieval period. Its significant strategic role from the 13th to 17th century gave its inhabitants the power to build one of the most important, and best preserved ensembles within the city walls in the region. 
The town can be compared with some of the noted world heritage sites as the old towns of Mostar (Bosnia and Herzegovina), [[Ohrid]] ([[Republic of Macedonia]]), [[Safranbolu]] (Turkey), [[Gjirokaster]] (Albania). Počitelj's layout and use of building materials put it into the group of Ottoman-Mediterranean types of small settlements.&lt;ref name="unesco"/&gt;

'''Road of Hope in Color''' (Spanish: '''Ruta de Esperanza en Color'''; Macedonian: '''Патот на Надежта во Боја'''; Croatian: '''Put Nade u Boji''') is an [[art exhibition]] and a movement against [[cancer]] that proposes the creation by law of an art workshop for each Regional Hospital along [[Chile]], to benefit cancer patients and those who must face long-term illness, thereby improving the system of [[Public health|Public Health]].

It consists of 28 [[oil painting]]s on canvas, 12 of which were painted from February to August 2011 over the treatment of six sessions of [[chemotherapy]] of a 79-year-old patient diagnosed with cancer in December 2010, Prof. Dora Formas. Two renowned European artists, Tome Mishev and Chendo, contributed six works, each created especially for this exhibition. Marysol Salval, a Spanish artist who lives in Chile, contributed four paintings. The background music of the exposition is donated by [[Simon Trpčeski]], piano soloist from the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]] of [[London]]. In addition, this initiative is being supported by ADICA (Professional Diplomats Association) and FALP (Arturo Lopez Perez Foundation against cancer).

The collection opened in the Cultural Center “[[Palacio de La Moneda]]” and is planned to be presented in cities in Chile, United States, Spain, [[Croatia]], [[Turkey]], and [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]. It is a tribute to women as a symbol of fertility, creative force, beauty, harmony, and spiritual strength. It has depth and complexity, expressing theology, mythology and how they confuse each other to this day; it encourages reflection and perhaps a metaphysical concept along with other philosophical disquisitions. The Road of Hope in Color is a masterful expression of love for life. Each work reflects the symbolism of life, death and resurrection, spiritual peace, the [[Eucharist]] and the hope for renewal of faith.

'''''Sartre: Romantic Rationalist''''' is a book by [[Iris Murdoch]]. Published in 1953 by [[Bowes &amp; Bowes]] of [[Cambridge]], it was Murdoch's first book and the first book about [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s work to be published in English.

==Publication history==

In 1950 Iris Murdoch, then a tutor of philosophy at [[St Anne's College, Oxford]], contracted with the Cambridge publishing house Bowes &amp; Bowes to write a short book on the French existentialists. It was to have focussed on the literary works of Sartre, [[Albert Camus]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]].&lt;ref name=Living&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Princeton University Press| isbn = 978-0-691-17056-5| last = Murdoch| first = Iris| others = Avril Horner, Anne Rowe (eds.)| title = Living on Paper: Letters from Iris Murdoch 1934–1995| location = Princeton, NJ| date = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|123}} This project was not completed, but Murdoch developed the section on Sartre into the monograph ''Sartre: Romantic Rationalist'', which appeared in November 1953 as part of Bowes &amp; Bowes's "Studies in modern European literature and thought" series. It was the first book devoted to the work of Sartre to be published in English,&lt;ref name=Moran&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-928990-5| pages = 181–196| editor-first = Justin |editor-last=Broackes | last = Moran| first = Richard| title = Iris Murdoch, Philosopher| chapter = Iris Murdoch and existentialism| location = Oxford, England| date = 2012| chapterurl = https://books.google.ca/books?id=CkNcGU2TrsAC&amp;pg=PA182}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|182}} as well as being Murdoch's first published book.&lt;ref name=Broakesintro&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Oxford University Press| isbn = 978-0-19-928990-5| last = Broackes| first = Justin| title = Iris Murdoch, Philosopher| chapter = Introduction| url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=CkNcGU2TrsAC&amp;pg=PA1|location = Oxford, England| date = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name=bove&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Univ of South Carolina Press| isbn = 978-0-87249-876-1| last = Bove| first = Cheryl Browning| title = Understanding Iris Murdoch |location = Columbia, SC| date = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|20}}

The book was first published in the United States by [[Yale University Press]], also in 1953. It was reprinted in paperback in 1967 by [[HarperCollins|Collins]] under the Fontana Library imprint. Spanish, Turkish and Japanese editions were published in 1956, 1964 and 1968 respectively. A revised edition with a new introduction by Murdoch was published by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] in London in 1987 and reprinted by [[Penguin Books]] in 1989. &lt;ref name=bibliography&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Garland Publishing| isbn = 0-8240-8910-3| last1 = Fletcher| first1 = John| last2 = Bove| first2 = Cheryl Browning| title = Iris Murdoch: A Descriptive Primary and Annotated Secondary Bibliography| location = New York| date = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|94–97}}

==Themes==

Murdoch had met Sartre in Brussels in 1945 while she was working for the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] and was impressed by his existentialist philosophy and by the fact that he was also a novelist and playwright.&lt;ref name=Conradilife&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Norton| isbn = 0-393-04875-6| last = Conradi| first = Peter J.,| title = Iris Murdoch: A Life| location = New York| date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|216}}  In ''Sartre: Romantic Rationalist'' she took Sartre's novels as the starting point for examining his thought, which she characterized as influenced by "three post-Hegelian movements: the Marxist, the existentialist, and the phenomenological", while being "profoundly and self-consciously contemporary".&lt;ref name=SRR&gt;{{Cite book| publisher =Collins| last=Murdoch| first=Iris| title=Sartre: Romantic Rationalist|location=London|date=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}} As well as ''[[Nausea (novel)|Nausea]]'' and the trilogy of novels making up ''[[The Roads to Freedom]]'', she drew on his philosophical works including ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' and ''[[What Is Literature?]]''. Among the themes she discussed were Sartre's views of freedom, interpersonal relations, and politics. She characterized him as "more at home as a playwright than a novelist", arguing that his "interest in issues rather than people, while it may sometimes be appropriate for a dramatist is not appropriate for a novelist". &lt;ref name="SRR" /&gt;{{rp|110, 119}}

In her introduction to the new edition of ''Sartre: Romantic Rationalist'', which appeared in 1987, Murdoch considered Sartre's writing since 1953, including the ''[[Critique of Dialectical Reason]]'', ''[[Saint Genet]]'', and ''The Family Idiot'', his biography of Flaubert.&lt;ref name="Bok" /&gt; 

==Reception==

''Sartre: Romantic Rationalist'' was well received and favourably reviewed. ''[[World Literature Today|Books Abroad]]'' called it "an interesting book", particularly welcome for attempting "an objective evaluation" of Sartre, whose followers on American university campuses seemed to see him as "the high priest of a new cult".&lt;ref name=Roland&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/40093717|volume = 28| issue = 4| pages = 481–481| last = Roland| first = Albert| title = Review of Sartre: Romantic Rationalist| journal = Books Abroad| date = 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The London Magazine]]'', [[Maurice Cranston]] described it as "a model of intelligent exposition" in which Murdoch displayed "an uncommonly wide knowledge of continental authors as well as the sharp wits of an Oxford philosophy don".&lt;ref name=Cranston&gt;{{Cite news| volume = 1| issue = 1| pages = 102| last = Cranston| first = Maurice| title = Sartre by Iris Murdoch| authorlink=Maurice Cranston|work = London Magazine| date = 1 February 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stuart Hampshire]], Murdoch's fellow Oxford philosophy don, reviewed the book for the ''[[New Statesman|New Statesman and Nation]]''. He saw her "main purpose" as being "to explain what Sartre's existentialism is, and why it has been largely ignored here, particularly by English philosophers", a task in which "she almost wholly succeeds."&lt;ref name=Hampshire&gt;{{Cite news| volume = 47| issue = 1191| page = 19| last = Hampshire| first = Stuart| authorlink=Stuart Hampshire|title = The Latest Hegelian| work = New Statesman and Nation| date = 2 January 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both [[Sissela Bok]] and [[Jay Parini]] reviewed the 1987 edition along with new biographies of Sartre. Bok noted that her "perspective, rooted, as was Sartre's, in philosophy and in literature" was necessary in order to understand Sartre's "role and his intellectual legacy".&lt;ref name=Bok&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 48–52| last = Bok| first = Sissela| title = Reassessing Sartre| journal = The Harvard Review of Philosophy | url=http://www.harvardphilosophy.com/issues/1991/Bok.pdf|date = 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Parini concluded in ''[[The Hudson Review]]'' that Murdoch "has ''understood'' Sartre better than any other critic thus far".&lt;ref name=Parini&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/3850885| volume = 41| issue = 2| pages = 363–369| last = Parini| first = Jay| title = Sartre's life of writing| journal = The Hudson Review| date = 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sitting and Smiling''' is an [[endurance art]] performance by Benjamin Bennett. In a typical performance, Bennett looks into a video camera which is recording him while sitting and smiling motionless for four hours.

Bennett uploaded his first "Sitting and Smiling" video on July 28, 2014. Over the next years he uploaded similar videos at a rate of about one per week. Currently, his videos have earned more than 15.1 million views with over 196 thousand subscribers. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqW54i24PGw1q7IxciRmgTA/about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Putney 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Putney|first1=Dean|title=Internet man sits and smiles at camera for hundreds of hours|url=http://boingboing.net/2015/10/07/internet-man-sits-and-smiles-a.html|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=Boing Boing|date=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bennett cites [[Claire Bishop]]'s 2012 ''Artificial Hells: Participatory Art and the Politics of Spectatorship'' as an inspiration for his art.&lt;ref name="Suzdaltsev 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suzdaltsev|first1=Jules|title=This Guy Is Filming Himself Sitting and Smiling for Four Hours a Day|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/meet-the-man-whos-filming-himself-sitting-and-smiling-for-four-hours-a-day-121|accessdate=17 February 2017|work=Vice|date=22 January 2015|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Incidents on stream ==
During the fifth installment of his stream, a burglar broke into his house. He kicked down the door into Bennett's house. The thief entered the room he was streaming in and said "Hello?", and quickly left. The incident generated attention online and the video currently has over 5 million views.&lt;ref name="Sumitra 2015"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Sumitra|title=This Guy Is Filming Himself Just Sitting and Smiling for Four Hours a Day |url=http://www.odditycentral.com/news/for-some-reason-this-guy-is-filming-himself-just-sitting-and-smiling-for-four-hours-a-day.html|website=Oddity Central|accessdate=17 February 2017|date=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tmrXakd_r6I|title=Sitting and Smiling #5|publisher=Benjamin Bennett|website=''[[YouTube]]''|time=2:36:30|date=25 November 2014|accessdate=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a separate incident in his 52nd livestream, Benjamin clearly urinates himself, with a wet puddle seeping out from under him and gradually evaporating over the remainder of the footage. He never acknowledges this or breaks his composure and continues to sit and smile to the camera.

The term "Soft IP" was first used at the European Patent Forum in Munich in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;EPO web site, [http://www.epo.org/about-us/press/releases/archive/2008/20080507.html ''Europe well-positioned in eco-innovation, determined to become world leader''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518045855/http://www.epo.org/about-us/press/releases/archive/2008/20080507.html |date=2008-05-18 }}, Press releases, May 7, 2008. Consulted on March 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; At this conference, the [[European Patent Office]] published a report about their work on four scenarios which are considered to describe the most likely developments in the area of intellectual property. One of these scenarios (called Blue Skies) shows a novel idea called “Soft IP”, a new form of IP.

In the field of patents there is effectively a Soft IP system in UK and Germany where patents may be endorsed "Licenses of Right" (LOR).

A Licence of Right is not a [[compulsory license]] to use the patented invention. A patent may, at the request of the patent owner, be endorsed LOR in the UK and/or Germany.  The request is made by the patent owner to the German Patent Office or UK Intellectual Property Office.  As a "reward" for doing so, the annual renewal fees for the patent are reduced by 50%. Any person wishing to obtain a license may approach the patent owner and agree terms for the license, and only if unable to agree is it necessary to apply to the appropriate national patent office or court to have the terms settled.  The terms of the license, in particular the royalties to be paid for using the invention, are normally on the basis of willing licensee/willing licensor informed by actual licensing practice and where they exist, licenses entered into voluntarily by the patentee.

Provisions for LOR have been included in the proposals for the [[European Community Patent]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1585">In algebraic topology, a '''symmetric spectrum''' ''X'' is a [[spectrum (topology)|spectrum]] of pointed [[simplicial set]]s that comes with an action of the [[symmetric group]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_n&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X_n&lt;/math&gt; such that the composition of structure maps
:&lt;math&gt;S^1 \wedge \dots \wedge S^1 \wedge X_n \to S^1 \wedge \dots \wedge S^1 \wedge X_{n+1} \to \dots \to S^1 \wedge X_{n+p-1} \to X_{n+p}&lt;/math&gt;
is equivariant with respect to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_p \times \Sigma_n&lt;/math&gt;. A morphism between symmetric spectra is a morphism of spectra that is equivariant with respect to the actions of symmetric groups.

The technical advantage of the category &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}p^\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; of symmetric spectra is that it has a closed [[symmetric monoidal category|symmetric]] [[Monoidal category|monoidal structure]] (with respect to [[smash product]]). It is also a [[simplicial model category]]. A '''symmetric ring spectrum''' is a monoid in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}p^\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;; if the monoid is commutative, it's a [[commutative ring spectrum]]. The possibility of this definition of "ring spectrum" was one of motivations behind the category.

A similar technical goal is also achieved by May's theory of [[S-modules]], a competing theory.

is a kind of order in  [[absolute zero|zero-temperature]]  quantum-mechanical states of matter that have  a symmetry and a finite energy gap.

To derive the results in a most-invariant way,  [[renormalization group|renormalization group methods]] are used (leading to equivalence classes corresponding to certain fixed points).&lt;ref name=defspt /&gt; The SPT order  has the following defining properties:

(a) ''distinct SPT states with a given symmetry cannot be smoothly deformed into each other without a phase transition, if the deformation preserves the symmetry''. &lt;br&gt;
(b) ''however, they all can be smoothly deformed into the same trivial product state without a phase transition, if the symmetry is broken during the deformation''.

The above definition works for both bosonic systems and fermionic systems, which leads to the notions of bosonic SPT order and fermionic SPT order.

Using the notion of [[quantum entanglement]], we can say that SPT states
are [[short-range entanglement|short-range entangled]] states ''with a symmetry'' (by contrast: for long-range entanglement see [[topological order]], which is not related to the famous [[EPR paradox]]).
Since short-range entangled states have only trivial [[topological order]]s 
we may also refer the SPT order as Symmetry Protected "Trivial" order.

==Characteristic properties of SPT order==

# The boundary effective theory of a non-trivial SPT state always has pure [[Anomaly matching condition|gauge anomaly]] or mixed gauge-gravity anomaly for the symmetry group.&lt;ref&gt;
Xiao-Gang Wen,
''Classifying gauge anomalies through SPT orders and classifying gravitational anomalies through topological orders''
Phys. Rev. D 88, 045013 (2013); arXiv:1303.1803.
&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the boundary of a SPT state is either gapless or degenerate, regardless how we cut the sample to form the boundary. A gapped non-degenerate boundary is impossible for a non-trivial SPT state.  If the boundary is a gapped degenerate state, the degeneracy may be caused by  spontaneous symmetry breaking and/or (intrinsic) topological order.

&lt;/ref&gt; of the symmetry group. Monodromy defects are created by twisting the boundary condition along a cut by a symmetry transformation. The ends of such cut are the monodromy defects. For example, 2+1D bosonic Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; SPT states are classified by a Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; integer ''m''. One can show that ''n'' identical elementary monodromy defects in a Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; SPT state labeled by ''m'' will carry a total Z&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; quantum number ''2m'' which is not a multiple of ''n''.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation between SPT order and (intrinsic) topological order==
SPT states are short-range entangled while topologically ordered states are long-range entangled.
Both intrinsic [[topological order]], and also SPT order, can sometimes have protected [[gapless boundary excitation]]s. The difference is subtle: the gapless boundary excitations in intrinsic [[topological order]] can be robust against any local perturbations, while the gapless boundary excitations in SPT order are robust only against local perturbations ''that do not break the symmetry''. So the gapless boundary excitations in intrinsic [[topological order]] are topologically protected, while the gapless boundary excitations in SPT order are ''symmetry protected''.&lt;ref&gt;One should also note the semantical subtleness of the name SPT: "symmetry protected"  does not mean that the stability of the state is  conserved "because of the symmetry", but it is  just meant that the symmetry is ''kept'' by the interactions corresponding to the process.&lt;/ref&gt;

We also know that an intrinsic [[topological order]] has emergent [[fractional charge]], emergent [[fractional statistics]], and emergent [[gauge theory]]. In contrast, a SPT order has no emergent [[fractional charge]]/[[fractional statistics]] for finite-energy excitations, nor emergent [[gauge theory]] (due to its short-range entanglement). Note that the monodromy defects discussed above are not finite-energy excitations in the spectrum of the Hamiltonian, but defects created by '''modifying''' the Hamiltonian.

==Examples of SPT order==

The first example of SPT order is the [[AKLT|Haldane phase]] of odd-integer-spin chain.&lt;ref&gt;
F. D. M. Haldane, Phys. Rev. Lett. 50, 1153 (1983), Phys.
Lett. 3,464 (1983); I. Affleck and F. D. M. Haldane, Pyhs.
Rev. B 36, 5291 (1987); I. Affleck, J. Phys.: Condens.
Matter. 1, 3047 (1989).
&lt;/ref&gt; It is a SPT phase protected by [[SO(3)]] spin rotation symmetry.&lt;ref name=defspt/&gt; 
(Note that Haldane phases of even-integer-spin chain do not have SPT order.)
A more well known example of SPT order is the [[topological insulator]] of non-interacting fermions, a SPT phase protected by [[U(1)]] and [[time reversal symmetry]].

On the other hand, fractional [[quantum Hall effect|quantum Hall]] states are not SPT states. They are states with (intrinsic) topological order and long-range entanglements.

==Group cohomology theory for SPT phases==

Using the notion of [[quantum entanglement]], one obtains the following general picture of gapped
phases at zero temperature. All gapped zero-temperature phases can be divided into two classes: [[long-range entanglement|long-range entangled]] phases (''ie'' phases with intrinsic [[topological order]]) and [[short-range entanglement|short-range entangled]] phases (''ie'' phases with no intrinsic [[topological order]]). All short-range entangled phases can be further divided into three classes:  [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] phases, SPT phases, and their mix (symmetry breaking order and SPT order can appear together).

It is well known that [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] orders are described by [[group theory]]. For bosonic SPT phases with pure gauge anomalous boundary, it was shown that they are classified by [[group cohomology]] theory:&lt;ref name=spt&gt;

The phases before "+" come from &lt;math&gt;H^{d+1} [G, U(1)]&lt;/math&gt;. The phases after "+" come from &lt;math&gt;\oplus_{k=1}^d H^k[G,iTO^{d+1-k}]&lt;/math&gt;.
Just like group theory can give us 230 crystal structures in 3+1D, [[group cohomology]] theory can give us various SPT phases in any dimensions with any on-site symmetry groups.

On the other hand, the fermionic SPT orders are described by [[group super-cohomology]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;
Zheng-Cheng Gu, [[Xiao-Gang Wen]],
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2648 Symmetry-protected topological orders for interacting fermions – fermionic topological non-linear sigma-models and a group super-cohomology theory ]
&lt;/ref&gt; So the group (super-)cohomology theory allows us to construct many
SPT orders even for interacting systems, which include  interacting topological insulator/superconductor.

==A complete classification of 1D gapped quantum phases (with interactions)==

Using the notions of [[quantum entanglement]] and SPT order, one can obtain
a complete classification of all 1D gapped quantum phases.

First, it is shown that there is no (intrinsic) [[topological order]] in 1D (''ie'' all 1D gapped states
are short-range entangled).&lt;ref&gt;
F. Verstraete, J. I. Cirac, J. I. Latorre, E. Rico, and M. M.
Wolf, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 140601 (2005).
&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, if the Hamiltonians have no symmetry, all their 1D gapped quantum states belong to one phase—the phase of trivial product states.
On the other hand, if the Hamiltonians do have a symmetry,  their 1D gapped quantum states 
are either [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|symmetry-breaking]] phases, SPT phases, and their mix.

Such an understanding allows one to classify all 1D gapped quantum phases:&lt;ref name=spt/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Xie Chen, Zheng-Cheng Gu, Xiao-Gang Wen, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.3745  Classification of Gapped Symmetric Phases in 1D Spin Systems],
Phys. Rev. B 83, 035107 (2011);

Lukasz Fidkowski, Alexei Kitaev, [https://arxiv.org/abs/1008.4138  Topological phases of fermions in one dimension],

84, 165139, (2011), [https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.3732 arXiv:1010.3732].
&lt;/ref&gt; All 1D gapped phases are classified by
the following three mathematical objects: &lt;math&gt;(G_H, G_\Psi, H^{2} [G_\Psi , U(1)])&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;G_H&lt;/math&gt; is the symmetry group of the Hamiltonian, &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi&lt;/math&gt; the symmetry group of the ground states, and &lt;math&gt;H^{2} [G_\Psi, U(1)]&lt;/math&gt; the second [[group cohomology]] class of &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi&lt;/math&gt;. (Note that &lt;math&gt;H^{2} [G, U(1)]&lt;/math&gt; classifies the projective representations of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.) If there is no symmetry breaking (''ie'' &lt;math&gt;G_\Psi=G_H&lt;/math&gt;), the 1D gapped phases are classified by the projective representations of symmetry group &lt;math&gt;G_H&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:WSTM Mark Frank 0039.jpg|thumb|The Flea Theater]]
'''The Flea Theater''', founded in 1996, is a [[theatre]] in the [[TriBeCa]] section of [[New York City]].  It presents primarily new American theatre, and provides a venue for film stars to act on a very small (74-seat) stage, as well as a smaller black box theater for experimental and new works. The theater was founded by distinguished downtown theater artists: director [[Jim Simpson (director)|Jim Simpson]], playwright [[Mac Wellman]], and designer [[Kyle Chepulis]].  The Flea earned early acclaim for original productions of post-[[September 11, 2001 attacks|9-11]] play "[[The Guys]]" and political works by [[A. R. Gurney]]. “Since its inception in 1996, The Flea has presented over 100 plays and numerous dance and live music performances. Under Artistic Director Jim Simpson and Producing Director Carol Ostrow,  The Flea is one of New York’s leading off-off-Broadway companies."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/theater/flea-theater-gets-a-place-to-call-home.html Flea Theater Gets A Place To Call Home, New York Times 12/8/2013] The New York Times, Retrieved April 25, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1996, the award-winning{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Flea Theater was originally formed out of the purely artistic impulse to create “a joyful hell in a small space”.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} "Soon thereafter a more formal mission was born: to present distinctive work that raises the standards of [[Off-Off-Broadway]] for artists &amp; audiences alike…Non-institutional and resolutely noncommercial, The Flea embodies the spirit of adventure and experimentation that has defined Off-Off-Broadway since its inception. Despite its tiny capacity, more than 17,000 adventurous New Yorkers make their way to The Flea each year. Because of the huge variety, the Flea draws students, uptown residents, downtown enthusiasts—in short, as diverse a group in age, interests, and ethnicity as lives in the city itself. And while its primary service area is Lower Manhattan, in recent years their burgeoning reputation has brought audiences and patrons from throughout the tri-state area.”{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} In March of 2015, The Flea announced that Niegel Smith would be taking over for Jim Simpson as its new artistic director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/29/flea-theater-names-niegel-smith-as-next-artistic-director/|title=Flea Theater Names Niegel Smith as Next Artistic Director|first=Michael|last=Paulson|date=29 March 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production highlights include "Oh the Humanity and Other Exclamations", by Pulitzer finalist [[Will Eno]], starring Marisa Tomei and Brian Hutchison. This transcendent collection of five short plays extended through winter 2008. Another recent Flea hit was "Mrs. Farnsworth", a timely political comedy written specially for The Flea by renowned playwright A.R. Gurney. Performed by the incomparable duo of Sigourney Weaver and John Lithgow, Mrs. Farnsworth won rave reviews and returned to The Flea for a special encore in the fall. For two years in a row, The New York Times named a Flea production as one of the best Off-Broadway shows of the season—"Mrs. Farnsworth" in 2004 and "O Jerusalem" in 2003. Recent productions include "The Great Recession", six plays commissioned by The Flea exploring the impact of the current economic crisis on the younger generation by Thomas Bradshaw, Sheila Callaghan, Erin Courtney, Will Eno, Itamar Moses and Adam Rapp, Jonathan Reynold’s "Girls in Trouble" and Bathsheba Doran’s "Parents’ Evening".

==New Works==
The Flea produces several original major productions each year, along with new work by the most iconoclastic, imaginative, and talented artists. Each year The Flea presents and produces dozens of new works in an environment that is professional, welcoming, and intimate.  Flea artists have been honored with two OBIE Awards, an Otto Award and, in May 2004, The Flea was given a Drama Desk Award for Distinguished Achievement commending its dedication to adventurous theater. With the continued participation of its founders and an ever-growing community of diverse and creative talents, The Flea strives to represent the wide range of what is possible Off-Off-Broadway.

== Awards and Recognition ==
In 2010, The Flea was awarded the [[American Theatre Wing]]'s National Theatre Company Grant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/American-Theatre-Wing-Announces-2010-National-Theatre-Company-Grants-20010101|title=American Theatre Wing Announces 2010 National Theatre Company Grants|last=Desk|first=BWW News|work=BroadwayWorld.com|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The BATS==
The Bats are the resident acting company of The Flea Theater. Each year over a thousand actors audition for a place in this unique company. The Bats perform in extended runs of challenging classic and new plays. Not a school, but a repertory company, the Bats also work to support all the visiting performing artists at The Flea Theater.

Past Bat productions include: "Benten Kozo", an Obie award winning production that played for over 6 months, "The Great Recession" by Thomas Bradshaw, "These Seven Sicknesses" by Sean Graney,
and "Future Anxiety" by Laurel Haines.

“The performances by the Bats, the Flea’s young resident company, are all well thought out and fresh. The Bats are most definitely a talented group of young artists.” – NYtheatre.com

==Resident Director Program==
Modeled after The Flea Theater’s successful resident company of actors, The Bats (now in its 16th season), this intensive residency program allow a small team of young directors to work, train and direct in support of The Flea’s season under the supervision of Artistic Director Jim Simpson and The Flea Theater staff. Applicants must be ready to roll up their sleeves and get involved with all aspects of theater production- dilettantes need not apply.

'''''The Four Apostles''''' is a [[panel painting]] by the German [[Renaissance]] master [[Albrecht Dürer]]. It was finished in 1526, and is the last of his large works. It depicts the four apostles larger-than-life-size.  The Bavarian  [[Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria|Elector Maximilian I]] obtained ''The Four Apostles'' in the year 1627 due to pressure on the Nuremberg city fathers.  Since then, the painting has been in [[Munich]] and, despite all the efforts of Nuremberg since 1806, it has not been returned.

==Description==
{{external media | width = 210px | headerimage = [[File:Albrecht Dürer - The Four Holy Men (detail) - WGA07027.jpg|210px]] | align = right | video1 =[http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/durer-four-apostles.html Smarthistory - Dürer's ''The Four Apostles'']}}
When Dürer moved back to [[Nuremberg]] he produced many famous paintings there, including several self-portraits. He gave ''The Four Apostles'' to the town council.  Saints John and Peter appear in the left panel; the figures in the right panel are Saints Mark and Paul. Mark and Paul both hold Bibles, and John and Peter are shown reading from the opening page of John's own Gospel.  At the bottom of each panel, quotations from the Bible are inscribed.&lt;ref name=smart&gt;
{{cite web | title =Dürer's Four Apostles | work = | publisher =Smarthistory at Khan Academy | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/durer-four-apostles.html | accessdate =December 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The apostles are recognizable by their symbols:
*St. John the Evangelist: open book
*St. Peter: keys
*St. Mark: scroll
*St. Paul: sword and closed book

They are also associated with the [[four temperaments]].
*St. John: sanguine
*St. Peter: phlegmatic
*St. Mark: choleric
*St. Paul: melancholy

==Historical context==
''The Four Apostles'' was created during the Reformation, begun in 1517 and having the largest initial impact on Germany. As it was a Protestant belief that icons were contradictory to the Word of God, which was held in the utmost supremacy over Protestant ideas, the Protestant church was not a patron of any sacred art. Therefore, any Protestant artist, like Dürer became, had to commission their own works. Many aspects of the image depicted prove significant in light of the Reformation itself.&lt;ref name=smart/&gt;

== Content ==
In 1933, eight young female friends graduate from [[Vassar College]].  The book describes these women's lives post-graduation, beginning with the marriage of one of the friends, Kay Strong, and ending with her funeral in 1940.  Each character struggles with different issues, including sexism in the work place, child-rearing, financial difficulties, family crises, and sexual relationships.  Nearly all the women's issues involve the men in their lives: fathers, employers, lovers, or husbands.  As highly educated women from affluent backgrounds, they must strive for autonomy and independence in a time when a woman's role is still largely restricted to marriage and childbirth.  The plot is influenced by the political and economic atmosphere of the time. Over the course of the book, the reader learns about the women's views on contraception, love, sex, socialism, and psychoanalysis.

== Characters ==
'''Kay Strong''':  Marries Harald Petersen, who is involved in theater management and stage directing.  Kay calls him a "Yale man", even though he did only graduate work there; this mildly offends the analytical Lakey.  Harald writes plays that are not produced and is frequently unemployed.  Kay has "a ruthless hatred of poor people", and is frustrated by their financial situation.  She supports them by working at Macy's and cares greatly about her material surroundings.  Her husband has multiple extramarital affairs.  Their fights and his drinking escalate; finally he hits her until she threatens him with a bread knife.  The next morning, he commits her to a psychiatric hospital, where Polly is working as a nurse.  Kay is later released from the hospital; she divorces Harald.  Her death at the end of the book is mysterious; no one knows whether she fell from the window on the twentieth floor of the Vassar Club, while airplane spotting, or whether she jumped.  Her friends reunite at the end of the novel at her funeral, where they shun Harald.

'''Mary Prothero, "Pokey"''':  The wealthiest of the Group.  Described as a "fat, cheerful New York society girl", "very rich and lazy".  Pokey says she made it through Vassar only with the help of Priss, a [[Phi Beta Kappa]].  Pokey's father gives her a plane so she is able to commute to Cornell Agricultural School; her mother, upon learning that Harald was arrested at a labor demonstration, is devastated that a "jailbird" once dined at the Prothero home.  Pokey eventually marries.  Her family has an earnest, eccentric, and observant butler named Hatton, who comes to Kay's funeral.

'''Dottie Renfrew''':  From a Boston family, she aims to be a welfare worker after Vassar. She goes home from Kay's wedding with Dick Brown, a poor artist, and he proceeds to take her virginity. He treats her abruptly and warns her not to fall in love with him. He tells her things can be a lot better between them (sexually) if she would go see a "lady doctor" (so that he wouldn't have to use withdrawal, which he did use in this instance, or condoms). He explains that he prefers diaphragms for upper-class women and condoms for lower-class women. She is fitted for a [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] by a woman doctor who is willing to fit unmarried as well as married women.  Dick has not called her or returned her calls. She returns to Dick's apartment, but he is gone.  She waits for him for hours in Washington Square Park; eventually she hides the birth control kit under a bench and goes back to Boston.  Dottie eventually marries Brook Latham from Arizona. Before the wedding, she admits to her perceptive mother that she has slept with Dick and is still in love with him. Her mother suggests she postpone the wedding and see Dick to explore her feelings, but Dottie refuses and marries Brook on schedule.

'''Elinor Eastlake, "Lakey”''':  From Lake Forest, Illinois.  After Pokey, she is the wealthiest of the group; she is cool and aristocratic, a "dark beauty", with pale skin, black hair, and large green eyes.  She spends most of the book in Europe, where she goes to study art history and get a doctorate.  At the end of the book, she returns to America, having fled the war in Europe.  The Group assembles at the pier to greet her arrival, where they find Lakey accompanied by the Baroness, who, it transpires, is her lesbian lover.  The group notes that the Baroness is not terribly bright; they are conflicted over Lakey's sexual orientation.

'''Polly Andrews''':  Her family suffers financial losses due to the Depression.  She is pretty, with "almost flaxen hair", "milk-white skin” and "big blue eyes".  She lives in a building where most of her neighbors are socialists, and she works as a technician in a local hospital.  She has an affair with Gus LeRoy, a married publisher, who is going through [[psychoanalysis]] at the request of his wife.  Polly does not understand why he needs analysis, and after reading Freud, she decides that she herself needs analysis.  Gus eventually leaves Polly and goes back to his wife.  Polly's father, who has just gotten divorced from Polly's mother and suffers from [[bipolar disorder]], comes to live with Polly.  Her father converts to [[Trotskyism]].  In the manic phase of his disorder, he overspends their budget, forcing Polly to sell her blood at the hospital.  Polly marries Dr. Jim Ridgeley, a psychiatrist, who offers her financial and moral support.

'''Priss Hartshorn''':  An idealistic believer in the FDR program, she marries Dr. Sloan Crockett, a pediatrician.  She has a job with the [[National Recovery Administration]].  She gives birth to Stephen, whom she has difficulty breast-feeding and potty-training.  Under the hospital regimen, she sleeps apart from her son, whom she hears crying most of the nights. Her husband wishes her to feed Stephen her breast milk rather than formula, a somewhat radical notion at the time.  Priss, pressured at the hospital to allow them to bottle feed the baby, also feels pressured by her husband, thinking, "Sloan…was enamored of his own theories, which he wanted to enforce, like Prohibition, regardless of the human factor".

'''Helena Davison''':  "A short, sandy haired girl with an appealing snub nose", Helena was "regarded as the droll member of the group", because of her sense of humor.  Her mother has her "tutored in every conceivable subject", including athletics, musical instruments, outdoor activities and crafts.  Despite her Vassar education, she gets a job as a teacher at an experimental school in Cleveland, Ohio, teaching "finger-painting".  She catches Kay's husband kissing another woman, Norine, a Vassar girl who was involved in left politics and not in The Group.  She decides not to tell Kay, but agrees to go to Norine's house to talk.  Norine's husband is impotent and Norine has had several affairs.  Norine asks Helena how she should fix her life, and Helena makes several suggestions, including scrubbing the floor, painting the sitting room a different color, and buying "some real food". By the end of the novel, Helena moves to New York to pursue an art career. She is the only character who remains single.

'''Libby MacAusland''':  A "tall, pretty blonde", who majored in English and is determined to break into the New York publishing industry.  Gus LeRoy, the publisher, hires her to read book manuscripts.  For five dollars apiece, she reads the manuscripts and writes a summary and opinion.  Libby can read Italian, so Gus gives her an Italian manuscript to summarize.  However, the book is mostly in a dialect, which she can't understand and she writes an inaccurate report. Gus fires her, telling her that "Publishing's a man's business…. Marry a publisher, Miss MacAusland, and be his hostess."  He later gets her a job as a literary agent's assistant and then an agent herself, becoming wealthy in the process and living well.  A Norwegian baron and ski jumper, Nils Aslund, tries to seduce her by reading Marlowe's "The Passionate Shepherd to His Love".  Libby tries to fend him off by quoting Sir Walter Raleigh's "The Shepherdess Replies".  Nils replies by ripping her clothes off and attempting to rape her; he desists when she tells him she is a virgin.

'''Norine Schmittlapp''': She is Vassar '33, but not a member of The Group.  Talking to Helena, she says, "You people were the aesthetes.  We were the politicals."  Norine is interested in psychoanalysis, socialism, and anthropology.  She has a dog named [[Nietzsche]].  While married to Putnam Blake, she has an affair with Harald, Kay's husband.  Norine's husband, Put, suffers from impotency; according to Norine, he is only aroused by "fallen women".  Norine helps Harald put Kay in the psychiatric ward by convincing Kay that she needs a rest.  She spreads the rumor that Kay was mentally disturbed, saying to Priss, "A lot of basic things were the matter.  Sex.  Competitiveness with men.  An underlying Lesbian drive that was too firmly repressed.  Thwarted social strivings."  Norine later divorces Put, and marries Freddy Rogers, a wealthy banker who has suffered from anti-Jewish discrimination.  She has a son, Ichabod.  Priss is horrified by her choice of name and her careless manner of raising Ichabod.  Norine tells Priss that her husband expects her to be a dutiful housewife, but Norine says "Our Vassar education made it tough for me to accept my womanly role".  Norine believes that because of her education, she is "crippled for life".

== Background ==
In some aspects the novel is autobiographical, in a satirical tone. Mary McCarthy studied literature at Vassar College and graduated in 1933, which is the class year of her group of eight characters. McCarthy's classmates from Vassar accused her of basing ''The Group'' characters on them and their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Elizabeth. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/29/the-group-mary-mccarthy "The Group by Mary McCarthy."] The Guardian, 29 November 2013. Retrieved 6 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, her first husband, Harald Johnsrud, shares the first name of the husband of the character Kay; the unusual (Nordic) spelling of the name is discussed several times in the novel. In parts of the book where McCarthy discusses sex, such as when Dottie loses her virginity, the author claims to come from her memories with past lovers, as an observer.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Alan. "Just Words." Yale University Press, 2011, p.174.&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy was also a supporter of [[Leon Trotsky]], a political position shared by another of the characters in the novel, Polly Andrews.

Mary McCarthy adopted the title of "lady-writer" mostly given by male critics. Although her works are supposedly written for women, they are commended by feminists. However, McCarthy denies being a feminist or writing for the "second-wave of feminism" as she believes in equality and freedom of rights, but does not view it as a gendered issue.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, Sabrina Fuchs. "Mary McCarthy: Gender, Politics, and the Postwar Intellectual." Peter Lang Publishing Inc., 2004, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The novel topped the ''New York Times'' best-seller for almost two years. It was banned in Australia, Italy, and Ireland for being offensive to public morals.&lt;ref&gt;Brightman, Carol. "Writing Dangerously: Mary McCarthy and Her World." Clarkson Potter/Publishers, 1992, p.486.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was reviewed critically and intensely for its vivid detail, length, and number of characters. At the time of its release, men questioned McCarthy's ability to be a professional writer. Notably, Norman Mailer for [[The New York Review of Books]]  wrote that, "her book fails as a novel by being good but not nearly good enough...she is simply not a good enough woman to write a major novel." &lt;ref&gt;Mailer, Norman. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1963/10/17/the-mary-mccarthy-case/ "The Mary McCarthy Case."] New York Review of Books, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

When an editor suggested to [[Candace Bushnell]] that she write "the modern-day version of ''The Group''", she wrote ''[[Sex and the City]]'', a collection of revealing essays that became the popular TV series and film. As Bushnell summarizes: "''The Group'' reminds us that not much has really changed".&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Day |title=The Group by Mary McCarthy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/29/the-group-mary-mccarthy |work=[[The Observer]] |location=London |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film adaptation ==
{{Main article|The Group (film)}}
In 1966 [[United Artists]] released a [[The Group (film)|film]] adaptation of McCarthy's novel directed by [[Sidney Lumet]]. The main characters were played by [[Candice Bergen]] (Lakey), [[Joan Hackett]] (Dottie), [[Elizabeth Hartman]] (Priss), [[Shirley Knight]] (Polly), [[Joanna Pettet]] (Kay), [[Mary-Robin Redd]] (Pokey), [[Jessica Walter]] (Libby), [[Kathleen Widdoes]] (Helena), [[Larry Hagman]] (Harald), [[James Broderick]] (Jim), [[Richard Mulligan]] (Dick), [[Carrie Nye]] (Norine), and [[Hal Holbrook]] (Gus). The film was exhibited in competition in the 1966 [[Berlinale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Group (1966) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060479/ |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio ==
In 2001, ''The Group'' was broadcast on BBC Radio 4.  It was adapted by Moya O'Shea, produced/Directed by Tracey Neale, and starred [[Gayle Hunnicutt]], [[Rebecca Front]], [[Teresa Gallagher]], [[Joanna Weir]], [[Tara Ward]], [[Laurel Lefkow]], [[Lorelei King]], [[Moya O'Shea]], [[Mark Caven]], [[Henry Goodman]], and [[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]].

== Popular culture references ==
The book appears in episode ten, season three of the television series ''[[Mad Men]]''. It is also referred to in the pilot episode of the series ''[[American Dreams]]'', during a scene in which one member of a woman's book group suggests "The Group" as a title that might make her contemporaries re-evaluate their lives as housewives. The suggestion is quickly dismissed by the group's leader, ("Oh!  That sounds so…depressing"), who rules in favor of Book of the Month Club's ''[[The Shoes of the Fisherman (novel)|The Shoes of the Fisherman]]''. In the following episode of ''American Dreams'', one of the main characters, Helen Pryor, reads the book and she says that "her whole world is falling apart" because of it. 

It is also mentioned in the ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' short "The Home Economics Story" (where Joel Robinson referring to the group of college students from said short as "The Group") as well as the episode featuring the film "[[The Sinister Urge (film)|The Sinister Urge]]" (where Mike Nelson refers to a group of young women as "Mary McCarthy's 'The Group'"). 

In the film ''[[The Sterile Cuckoo]]'', the character of Pookie Adams ([[Liza Minnelli]]) can be seen clutching a copy of ''The Group'' when she departs the bus after her first encounter with love interest Jerry Payne.  Mentioned in ''[[A Right to Die]]'' by Rex Stout: Nero Wolfe "had read two chapters and ditched it."

In Season 1, episode 9 of "[[Gilmore Girls]]", Rory is seen reading a copy of the book as she stands on line to buy tickets to a dance.

'''''The Magdalen Reading''''' is one of three surviving fragments of a large mid-15th-century [[Panel painting|oil-on-panel]] [[altarpiece]] by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] painter [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. The panel, originally [[oak]], was completed some time between 1435 and 1438 and has been in the [[National Gallery]], London since 1860. It shows a woman with the pale skin, high cheek bones and oval eyelids typical of the idealised portraits of noble women of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky pp.&amp;nbsp;258–9 (writing before the painting had been cleaned of its overpaint): "Soon after the completion of the 'Descent from the Cross,' that is to say, in 1436–1437, Roger would seem to have produced two works in which the youthful feminine types of the Escorial picture, still vaguely Flémallesque, appear refined to greater spirituality: a major composition, apparently a ''Virgo inter Virgines,'' of which only a fragment, the 'Magdalen Reading' in the National Gallery at London, survives; and the beautiful "Madonna Duran" or "Madonna in Red" in the Prado".&lt;/ref&gt; She is identifiable as the [[Mary Magdalene|Magdalen]] from the jar of ointment placed in the foreground, which is her traditional attribute in Christian art. She is presented as completely absorbed in her reading, a model of the contemplative life, repentant and absolved of past sins. In Catholic tradition the [[Mary of Bethany#Catholic identification with Mary Magdalene|Magdalen was conflated]] with both [[Mary of Bethany]] who anointed the feet of Jesus with oil&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleref2|John|12:3–8}}, {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–48}} is also relevant.&lt;/ref&gt; and the unnamed "sinner" of {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–50}}. [[Iconography]] of the Magdalen commonly shows her with a book, in a moment of reflection, in tears, or with eyes averted.

The background of the painting had been [[overpainting|overpainted]] with a thick layer of brown paint. A cleaning between 1955 and 1956 revealed the figure standing behind the Magdalene and the kneeling figure with its bare foot protruding in front of her, with a landscape visible through a window. The two partially seen figures are both cut off at the edges of the London panel. The figure above her has been identified as belonging to a fragment in the [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon, which shows the head of [[Saint Joseph]], while another Lisbon fragment, showing what is believed to be [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], is thought to be from the same larger work.&lt;ref name="NG"&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/rogier-van-der-weyden-the-magdalen-reading The Magdalen Reading]".

The drawing shows that ''The Magdalen'' occupied the lower right-hand corner of the altarpiece. The Lisbon fragments are each a third of the size of ''The Magdalen'', which measures {{convert|62.2|x|54.4|cm|abbr=on}}.

Although internationally successful in his lifetime, van der Weyden fell from view during the 17th century, and was not rediscovered until the early 19th century. ''The Magdalen Reading'' can first be traced to an 1811 sale. After passing through the hands of a number of dealers in the Netherlands, the panel was purchased by the [[National Gallery]], London, in 1860 from a collector in Paris. It is described by art historian [[Lorne Campbell (Art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] as "one of the great masterpieces of 15th-century art and among van der Weyden's most important early works."&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998, 405"&gt;Campbell (1998), 405&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:M Reading Detail2.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail showing the face and veil of Mary Magdalene painted in pure whites. The eyebrows and eyelids have been plucked in accordance with conventional ideals of beauty at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Plucked-Shaved-Braided-Renaissance-Practices/dp/193006408X Turudich] (2004), 198&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Mary Magdalene]] as depicted in early [[Renaissance art|Renaissance painting]] is a composite of various biblical figures. Here, she is based on [[Mary of Bethany]], who is identified as the Magdalene in the Roman Catholic tradition. Mary of Bethany sat at Jesus' feet and "listened to His Word", and thus is seen as a contemplative figure. The counterpoint is Mary's sister [[Martha]] who, representative of the active life, wished that Mary would help her serve.&lt;ref name="jj54"&gt;Jones (2011), 54&lt;/ref&gt; Mary is shown by van der Weyden as youthful, sitting in quiet piety with her head tilted and eyes modestly averted from the viewer. She is absorbed in her reading of a holy book, the covers of which include a ''chemise'' of white cloth, a common form of protective binding. Four coloured cloth bookmarks are tied to a gold bar near the top of the spine. According to Lorne Campbell, the manuscript "looks rather like a 13th-century French Bible" and is "clearly a devotional text".&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 395–396, 398; quotes 396, 398.&lt;/ref&gt; It was rare for contemporary portraits to show women reading, and if the model herself could read then she was likely from a noble family.&lt;ref name="B58"&gt;Belloli (2001), 58&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Weyden often linked form and meaning, and in this fragment the semicircular outline of the Magdalene reinforces her quiet detachment from her surroundings.&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;  She is seated on a red cushion and rests her back against a wooden [[sideboard]]. By her feet is her usual [[emblem|attribute]] of an [[alabaster]] jar; in the [[Gospel]]s she brought spices to the [[Holy Sepulchre|tomb of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998),398; {{Bibleref2|Mark|16:1}} and {{Bibleref2|Luke|24:1}}. Another passage, taken in the [[Middle Ages]] to refer to the Magdalene, {{Bibleref2|John|12:3–8}} is the source of the [[alabaster]] jar.&lt;/ref&gt; The view through the window is of a distant canal, with an [[Archery|archer]] atop the garden wall and a figure walking on the other side of the water, whose reflection shows in the water.&lt;ref name="P54"&gt;Potterton (1977), 54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M Reading Detail.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Detail showing the prayer book, likely a [[book of hours]], decorated with white cloth and gold clasps.]]
Van der Weyden's pose for the Magdalene is similar to a number of female religious figures painted by his master [[Robert Campin]] or his workshop.&lt;ref name="KC" /&gt;  It closely resembles, in theme and tone, the figure of [[Saint Barbara]] in Campin's ''[[The Werl Triptych|Werl Altarpiece]]'',&lt;ref name="KC"&gt;Clark (1960), 45&lt;/ref&gt; and also the Virgin in an ''[[Annunciation]]'' attributed to Campin in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 400; the ''[[Merode Altarpiece]]'' is another version of this composition, though the Virgin's figure there is less similar.&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically for a van der Weyden, the Magdalen's face has an almost sculpted look, and the elements of her clothes are conveyed in minute detail. She wears a green robe; in medieval art the Magdalene is usually depicted naked (sometimes clad only in her long hair) or in richly coloured dress, typically red, blue or green, almost never in white.&lt;ref&gt;Salih (2002), 130&lt;/ref&gt; Her robe is tightly pulled below her bust by a blue [[sash]], while the gold [[brocade]] of her [[Petticoat|underskirt]] is adorned by a jewelled hem.&lt;ref name="B58" /&gt; Art critic Charles Darwent observed that the Magdalen's past as a "[[Prostitution|fallen woman]]" is hinted at by the [[Nap (textile)|nap]] in the [[fur]] lining of her dress and the few strands of hair loose from her veil.  Darwent wrote, "Even her fingers, absent-mindedly circled, suggest completeness. In her mix of purity and eroticism, van der Weyden's Magdalen feels whole; but she isn't."&lt;ref name="Darw"&gt;Darwent, Charles. "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/rogier-van-der-weyden-master-of-passions-museum-leuven-belgium-1793708.html Rogier van der Weyden: Master of Passions, Museum Leuven, Belgium]". ''[[The Independent]]'', 27 September 2009. Retrieved 1 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period, fur symbolized female sexuality and was commonly associated with the Magdalene. Medieval historian Philip Crispin explains that artists such as [[Hans Memling|Memling]] and [[Quentin Matsys|Matsys]] often portrayed the Magdalen in furs and notes that she "is noticeably dressed in fur-lined garments in ''The Magdalen Reading'' by Rogier van der Weyden".&lt;ref&gt;Crispin (2008), 157&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:M Reading Detail3.jpg|thumb|240px|Detail showing the jar and row of nails on the timber floor at the lower right corner of the panel. Note the attention paid to the gilded clasp and fall of the shadow.]]

The level of detail used in portraying the Magdalene has been described by Campbell as "far exceed[ing]" [[Jan van Eyck|van Eyck]]. Her lips are painted with a shades of [[vermilion]], white and red which are mixed into each other to give a transparent look at the edges. The fur lining of her dress is painted in a range of greys running from almost pure white to pure black. Rogier gave the fur a textured look by painting stripes parallel to the line of the dress and then feathering the paint before it dried. The gold on the cloth is rendered with a variety of [[impasto]], grid and dots of varying colour and size.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998 402"&gt;Campbell (1998), 402&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the objects around her are also closely detailed, in particular the wooden floor and nails, the folds of the Magdalene's dress, the costume of the figures in the exterior and the beads of Joseph's rosary.&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P54"/&gt; The effect of falling light is closely studied; Joseph's crystal [[Rosary#Rosary beads|rosary beads]] have bright highlights, while subtle delineations of light and shade can be seen in the sideboard's tracery and in the clasps of her book. Mary is absorbed in her reading and seemingly unaware of her surroundings. Van der Weyden has given her a quiet dignity although he is generally seen as the more emotional of the master Netherlandish painters of the era, in particular when contrasted with [[Jan van Eyck]].&lt;ref name="P54"/&gt;

Lorne Campbell describes the tiny figure of the woman seen through the window and her reflection in the water as "small miracles of painting", and says that "the attention to detail far exceeds that of Jan van Eyck and the skill of execution is astounding". He notes that these tiny details would have been impossible for a viewer to observe when the altarpiece was in its intended position.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 396 and 402&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of the panel, however, have been described as dull and uninspired. One critic wrote that the areas of the floor and most of the cupboard behind her seem unfinished and "much too narrow and papery in effect".&lt;ref name="Darw" /&gt; A number of objects placed on the cupboard are now barely visible save for their bases.&lt;ref&gt;These objects are often cut off in reproduction.&lt;/ref&gt; The object on the right seated on legs alongside a box is likely a small [[pitcher (container)|pitcher]], possibly a [[reliquary]]. A moulding to the left of the cupboard may represent a doorway.&lt;ref name="JW35"&gt;Ward (1971), 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Altarpiece fragment==
[[File:Rogier van der Weyden - St Joseph - WGA25722.jpg|thumb|220px|''Head of Saint Joseph'' (fragment). {{convert|21|x|18|cm|abbr=on}}. [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]], Lisbon. This panel is thought to show [[Saint Joseph]], whose body is visible to his upper arm in ''The Magdalen Reading''.]]

''Virgin and Child with Saints'',&lt;ref name="C49"&gt;Campbell (2004), 49&lt;/ref&gt; a drawing in Stockholm's [[Nationalmuseum]], is believed to be a study of a portion of the original altarpiece by a follower of van der Weyden,&lt;ref name="C398-400"&gt;Campbell (1998), 398–400&lt;/ref&gt; who possibly may have been the [[Master of the Drapery Studies|Master of the Coburger Rundblätter]]. The drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows, from left to right: an unidentified bishop saint with [[mitre]] and [[crosier]] making a blessing gesture; a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure; a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as Saint [[John the Baptist]]; a seated Virgin holding on her lap the Christ Child who leans to the right, looking at a book; and holding the book, a kneeling beardless male identified as [[John the Evangelist]]. The drawing stops at the end of John's robe, at about the point on the London panel where Joseph's walking stick meets John and the Magdalene's robes.&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt; This suggests that the Magdalene panel was the first to be cut from the larger work.

A possible representation of [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], it is of lower quality than the other two known fragments, indicating that it was probably completed by members of van der Weyden's workshop.]]

At an unknown point before 1811, the original altarpiece was broken into at least three pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 394, 398&lt;/ref&gt; possibly due to damage, although ''The Magdalen'' fragment is in good condition. The black overpaint was likely added after the early 17th century when Netherlandish painting had fallen from favour and was unfashionable. Campbell believes that after the removal of the background detail "it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch seventeenth-century paintings".&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998, 405"/&gt; From the size of three surviving panels in relation to the drawing, it is estimated that the original was at least 1&amp;nbsp;m high by 1.5&amp;nbsp;m wide; the bishop and the Magdalene seem to clearly mark the horizontal extremities, but the extent of the picture above and below the surviving elements and the drawing cannot be judged. Such a size is comparable with smaller altarpieces of the period.&lt;ref name="C398-400"/&gt; The background was overpainted with a thick layer of black/brown pigment until it was cleaned in 1955; it was only after the layer's removal that it was linked to the upper body and head of Joseph from the Lisbon piece. These two works were not recorded in inventory until 1907, when they appear in the collection of Léo Lardus in [[Suresnes]], France.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt;

The London panel shows much of the clothing of two other figures from the original altarpiece. To the left of the Magdalene is the red robe of what appears to be a kneeling figure. The figure and robe, and less precisely the background, match a kneeling Saint John the Evangelist.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt; Behind the Magdalen is a standing figure in blue and red robes, with linear [[rosary]] beads in one hand&lt;ref&gt;Joseph's beads closely resemble those in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', which was painted around the same time and is on permanent display in the National Gallery alongside ''The Magdalen Reading''. See Jones, 46, 54&lt;/ref&gt; and a walking stick in the other. A panel at the [[Museu Calouste Gulbenkian]] in [[Lisbon]] shows the head of a figure believed to be the [[Saint Joseph]]; the background and clothes match with those of the figure behind the Magdalen on the London panel.&lt;ref name="C49"/&gt;

[[File:The Magdalen Reading uncleaned.jpg|thumb|260px|Cropped 1930s black and white photograph of the panel before it was cleaned of the overpaint.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Davies (museum director)|Davies, Martin]] (1937), 140, 142–145&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the overpainting and the breaking up of the altarpiece are unknown.]]

There is a further small panel in Lisbon of a female head, richly or royally dressed, which first appeared in 1907 with the Joseph panel when it was recorded in the inventory of Leo Nardus at [[Suresnes]]. The figure may represent [[Catherine of Alexandria|Saint Catherine of Alexandria]], and from both the angle of her cloth and the fact that the river behind her would be parallel to that in the exterior of the London panel it can be assumed that she was kneeling.&lt;ref name="Campell49"&gt;Campell (2009), 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the Stockholm drawing she is omitted, or only traces of her dress shown. The Joseph panel has a sliver of a view through a window to an exterior scene; if the other female is presumed to be kneeling, the trees above the waterway aligns with those in the London panel.&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt;  Some art historians, including [[Martin Davies (museum director)|Martin Davies]] and John Ward,&lt;ref&gt;Davies and Ward have published, in 1957 and 1971 respectively, diagrammatic reconstructions of the altarpiece based on evidence available of the time. Campbell is responsible for much of the scholarship since.&lt;/ref&gt; have been slow to allow the Catherine panel as part of the altarpiece, though it is undoubtedly by van der Weyden or a near-contemporary follower. Evidence against this link includes the fact that the moulding of the window to the left of the Gulbenkian female saint is plain, while that next to Saint Joseph is [[chamfer]]ed. Such an inconsistency in a single van der Weyden work is unusual. The panels are of equal thickness (1.3&amp;nbsp;cm) and of near-identical size; the Saint Catherine panel measures {{convert|18.6|x|21.7|cm|abbr=on}}, the Saint Joseph {{convert|18.2|x|21|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "W32"&gt;Ward (1971), 32&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorne Campbell thinks that though the Catherine head is "obviously less well drawn and less successfully painted than the ''Magdalen''",&lt;ref name="Campbell 1998 402"/&gt; it "seems likely" that all three fragments came from the same original work; he points out that "about half way up the right edge of this fragment ["Catherine"] is a small triangle of red, outlined by a continuous underdrawn brushstroke&amp;nbsp;... It is likely that the red is part of the contour of the missing figure of the Baptist".&lt;ref name="C398-400" /&gt;  The small piece is on the outermost edge of the panel, and only visible when it was removed from the frame. Ward believes the piece corresponds directly with the folds of John's robes.&lt;!-- Campbell says J the Baptist &amp; Ward says J the Evangelist? Is this a mistake? --&gt;&lt;ref name = "W32"/&gt;

The Stockholm drawing contains a narrow blank gap to the right of the bishop with a few indistinct lines that could represent the lower profile of the kneeling figure of Saint Catherine. Although none of the faces in the three surviving panels match any in the drawing, a 1971 reconstruction by art historian John Ward—which combined all of the works into a composition of a central Virgin and Child flanked by six saints—is widely accepted. The Stockholm drawing's original location or history before the 19th century is unknown, except that the ''[[recto and verso|verso]]'' shows a surviving carving of the Virgin and Child attributed to a [[Brussels]] workshop from about 1440. This carving is also now in Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 398–400, illustrating the drawing, and with a drawing of a full reconstruction.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Weyden, Rogier van der - Descent from the Cross - Detail women (left).jpg|260px|thumb|Detail from ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'',  c. 1435. Here van der Weyden portrays the tears and partially visible eyes of [[Mary of Clopas]].&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 34&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Van der Weyden's depiction of the Magdalen is based on Mary of Bethany,&lt;ref name="jj54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Described as "This Mary, whose brother Lazarus now lay sick, was the same one who poured perfume on the Lord and wiped his feet with her hair".{{Bibleref2|John|11:1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified by the time of [[Pope Gregory I]] as the repentant prostitute of {{Bibleref2|Luke|7:36–50}}.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara (1994), 24&lt;/ref&gt; She then became associated with weeping and reading: Christ's mercy causes the eyes of the sinner to be contrite or tearful. Early Renaissance artists often conveyed this idea by portraying contemplative eyes, associating tears with words, and in turn weeping with reading. Examples can be seen in 16th-century works by [[Tintoretto]] and [[Titian]] which show the Magdalen reading, often with her eyes averted towards her book (and presumably away from a [[Gaze|male gaze]]), or looking up to the heavens or, sometimes, glancing coyly towards the viewer.&lt;ref name = McMullan212/&gt; Writing in "The Crying Face", Mosche Barasch explains that in van der Weyden's time the gesture of averting or concealing the eyes became a "pictorial formula for crying".&lt;ref&gt;Barasch (1987), 23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Campin Annunciation triptych.jpg|thumb|left|280px|''[[Mérode Altarpiece|Annunciation]]'', attributed to Robert Campin, [[Brussels]], c. 1427–1432, where the figure of the Virgin is close to van der Weyden's London Magdalen.]]

By the medieval period, reading became synonymous with devotion, which involved withdrawal from public view. Van der Weyden's placement of the Magdalen in an interior scene reflects the increasing literacy of domestic or laywomen in the mid-15th century. The increased production of devotional texts showed that noble women of the period routinely read texts such as a [[psalter]] or [[book of hours]] in the privacy of their homes.&lt;ref&gt;Green (2007), 10–12, 119&lt;/ref&gt; Whether the Magdalen herself was a reader, by the 17th century she was firmly established as such in the visual arts. Because the Magdalen was present at Christ's death and subsequent resurrection, she was seen as the bearer of news—a witness—and hence directly associated with the text.&lt;ref&gt;Jagodzinski (1999), 136–137&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magdalen imagery further draws on the idea of Christ as the word, represented by a book, with the Magdalen as the reader learning of her own life story in a moment of reflection and repentance.  Her devotion to reading reflects her traditional status as the piously repentant harlot, as well as a prophetess or seer.&lt;ref name = McMullan212&gt;Badir (2007), 212&lt;/ref&gt;  According to legend, the Magdalen lived the last 30 years of her life as a hermit in [[Sainte-Baume]] and is often shown with a book, reading or writing, symbolizing her later years of contemplation and repentance.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton (2009), 174&lt;/ref&gt; By the 13th century she acquired the imagery of a once-shamed woman who, clothed in long hair, now hid her nakedness in exile and "borne by angels, floats between heaven and earth".&lt;ref&gt;Maisch (1998), 48&lt;/ref&gt;

The Magdalen's ointment jar was common in the lexicon of art in van der Weyden's period. Mary of Bethany may have used a jar when she repented of her sins at Christ's feet in her home; by the Renaissance, the image of the Magdalen was of the woman who bathed Christ's feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.&lt;ref&gt;Ross (1996), 170&lt;/ref&gt; She signified the "sacrament of anointing ([[Chrism]] and [[Anointing|Unction]])" by pouring precious [[spikenard]] on Christ's feet at his tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Apostolos-Cappadona (2005), 215&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating and provenance==

The altarpiece's date is uncertain but believed to be between 1435 and 1438. Van der Weyden was made painter to the city of Brussels in 1435, and it is believed to have been painted after this appointment. The National Gallery gives "before 1438".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/artists/rogier-van-der-weyden Rogier van der Weyden]". [[National Gallery]], London. Retrieved 24 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian John Ward notes that the altarpiece was one of van der Weyden's first masterpieces, created early in his career when he was still heavily influenced by [[Robert Campin]].&lt;ref name="JW35"/&gt; He proposes a c. 1437 date based on similarities to Campin's ''[[The Werl Triptych|Werl Altarpiece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 28&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Madonna and Child with Saints Master of the Koberger.JPG|thumb|280px|The Stockholm drawing, attributed to the Master of the Coburger Rundblätter, likely shows the portion of the altarpiece to the left of the Magdalen. The kneeling figure to the far right is probably Saint [[John the Evangelist]], some of whose red drapery can be seen in the London fragment.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 27&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's position on the lower right hand corner (out of view) is guessed at by Ward from van der Weyden's positioning of similar figures in other works.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1971), 29&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Because van der Weyden, like most of the [[Early Netherlandish painting|early Netherlandish painters]], was not rediscovered until the early 19th century, many of his works were wrongly attributed or dated, and major pieces such as the Berlin ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' continue to emerge. Conversely, when a number of pieces considered either by van der Weyden or assistants under his supervision were cleaned in the mid- to late 20th century, his hand or direct influence was disproved,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 7, 126, 127&lt;/ref&gt; or in the case of the Magdalen, associated with other images whose attribution had been uncertain.

''The Magdalen Reading'' can first be traced to an 1811 sale of the estate of Cassino, a little-known collector in [[Haarlem]],&lt;ref&gt;Campbell; Stock (2009), 441&lt;/ref&gt; when the work was already cut down.&lt;ref name="Darw"/&gt; The painting is recorded in the inventory of Demoiselles Hoofman, also of Haarlem.&lt;ref name="C50"&gt;Campbell (2004), 50&lt;/ref&gt; After passing to the Nieuwenhuys brothers, who were leading dealers in art of the early Netherlandish period, it moved to the collector Edmond Beaucousin&lt;ref name="C50" /&gt; in Paris, whose "small but choice" collection of early Netherlandish paintings was purchased for the [[National Gallery]], London by [[Charles Lock Eastlake]] in 1860; an acquisition that also included two [[Robert Campin]] portraits and panels by [[Simon Marmion]] (1425–1489).&lt;ref name ="R203"&gt;Borchert (2005), 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 13–14, 394&lt;/ref&gt; This was during a period of acquisition intended to establish the international prestige of the gallery.&lt;ref name ="R203"/&gt; Probably before 1811, all the background except the red robe on the left and the alabaster jar and floorboards was overpainted in plain brown, which was not removed until the cleaning begun in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 394, with photo on 395&lt;/ref&gt;  In general the "painted surface is in very good condition", although better in the parts that were not overpainted, and there are a few small losses.&lt;ref name="C394"&gt;Campbell (1998), 394&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Magdalen Reading'' was transferred from its original oak to a [[mahogany]] panel (West Indian [[swietenia]])&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 395&lt;/ref&gt; by unknown craftsmen sometime between 1828 and when the National Gallery acquired it in 1860. Campbell states that the transfer was "Certainly after 1828, probably after 1845, and certainly before 1860", the year it was acquired by the National Gallery.&lt;ref name="C394"/&gt; Artificial [[ultramarine]]-coloured paint found in the transfer ground indicates that the change of panel took place after 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1997), 85&lt;/ref&gt; The heads in Lisbon are still on their original oak panels.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 398&lt;/ref&gt; The Stockholm drawing was discovered in a German inventory c. 1916 and is likely of Swedish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Bjurström (1985), 166&lt;/ref&gt; It was bequeathed by a Norwegian collector, Christian Langaad, to the Swedish [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum of Fine Arts]] in 1918.&lt;ref name="C49" /&gt;

'''The Society for the Preservation of Wild Culture''' (SPWC) was a Toronto [[Not-for-profit arts organization|arts organization]] in existence from 1986 to 1991 that explored environmental and ecological issues from an artistic perspective in a "quirky and innovative" way.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview"&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The SPWC was best known for three programs: a literary magazine, The Journal of Wild Culture; artist-guided walks, "landscape readings"; and a series of cabarets, The Café of Wild Culture.

The organization was a unique hybrid. The oxymoron "wild culture" tweaked the interest of contrasting types: artists, scientists and activists, and the efforts made by the organization to develop creative projects and discourse around the term were well received.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar"/&gt; It was concurrently accepted as an arts organization by artists and an environmental organization by environmentalists.

The organisation was resurrected in 2011 and is now producing an online magazine based in London and Toronto.

== Art and ecology ==
The style of the organization was determined by how participating artists expressed themselves around the undefined idea of "wild culture" (also see "[[wildculture]]"). While calling for new articulations of wild culture through its projects, at its height the society filled the cultural vacuum in Toronto with an eclectic kind of "thinking man's" fun and provided a forum for experimentation amongst performance artists.&lt;ref name="MetropolisMarch"&gt;''Metropolis'', March 30, 1989, Donna Lypchuk, "Mock on the Wild Side".&lt;/ref&gt; The broader public was encouraged by the SPWC to engage with questions about nature and art, while frequently congregating in the outdoors. This audience was also attracted to the organization's ability to 'soft pedal doom and gloom while partying for the planet".&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', April 20, 1990, Vit Wagner, "Wild Culture artists party for the planet"., p. D1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a landscape reading on the aboriginal history of downtown Toronto, poet M. T. Kelly offered a view of how the SPWC sought to affect its audience: "There is a bridge between history and landscape. To get people to change their view of the environment, you can't just argue in economic terms. It's an emotional thing. People act politically when they get emotionally involved".&lt;ref name="GlobeMail"&gt;''Globe and Mail'', Sept 7, 1988, June Callwood, 'sunday morning landscape readings cultivate food for thought"., p. A2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "wild culture" grew out of multidisciplinary artist [[Whitney Smith (multidisciplinary artist)|Whitney Smith]]'s experience of "a spiritual updraft in the art spheres" while foraging wild foods in the Ontario forest that he sold to local chefs. From 1982 to 1985 a series of three performances, "Fern Policy", explored the possibilities of artistic growth in the nature-culture ecotone. In May 1985 Smith made the first public announcement on the formation of the society at a Toronto art event, "L'Affaire 'Pataphysique", that presented examples of [['pataphysics]] by local artists parodying theory and methods of modern science. Following this event Smith began recruiting artists to help develop ''The Journal of Wild Culture''.

== Defining wild culture ==
Though there were attempts by the organization to define "wild culture", there was never an accepted definition. Smith preferred his colleagues and audiences to find wild culture's meaning through the titles of the projects in which it appeared,  where the social context was at play; that is, that there existed a serious-sounding and possibly genuine [[academic journal]] published by a preserving society with a long name, all devoted to a subject no one knew anything about.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar"&gt;''Toronto Star'', April 20, 1990, Vit Wagner, "Wild Culture artists party for the planet"., p. D2.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiating the serious and the non-serious in a way that made sense and entertained became part of the artists' work.

Before there was Smith's recent definition of wild culture ("the articulated [[ecotone]] between what humans do and what they can't control in nature"), no single explanation existed around which the S.P.W.C artists" work was done. Some said that it was the vagueness of the idea, the inability to pin it down, that made it so attractive.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview" /&gt; In the absence of concrete description, Smith offered a metaphor, which he has recently modified: On the surface of a transparent painting&lt;ref name="RyersonReview" /&gt; is the human geographic reality that is part of our everyday life, and in the background are elements of nature, seen and unseen, that are very much alive but that people aren"t always aware of, whether out of convenience, ignorance, apathy, or any state of unconsciousness or self-centeredness that contributes to the disconnection from our primal history and our present psychic hold on the home terrain. Wild culture is the two planes, foreground and background, seen together.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt;

== Programs ==

=== ''The Journal of Wild Culture'' ===
The literary organ of the SPWC, its subtitle, ecology, and imagination, spoke to the notion of ''[[The Journal of Wild Culture]]'' being a platform for artists to express themselves through the lens, or mirror, of the natural world. Smith said that "one of the things wild culture ''is'', is a tolerance for ambiguity and an acceptance that things cannot be defined".&lt;ref name="NOW Magazine 1987"&gt;''NOW Magazine'', July 9–15, 1987, Ted Mumford, 'society mines wild culture".&lt;/ref&gt; The "quirky and innovative" magazine carried on its discourse in a way that influenced the way more serious themes could be delivered with a sense of play and timeliness.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview_a"&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Organic start ====
Born out of the wild foods foraging of founder Whitney Smith, the magazine was conceived in 1986-1987 by an editorial team that included Smith and architect [[Peter Ferguson]], public relations consultant [[Kim Obrist]] and filmmaker and publisher [[Christopher Lowry]]. Smith attributed his inspiration for the formation of the society to the [[National Geographic Society]] (which published its own journal) and ''FILE'' magazine, produced by the conceptual and media-based art collective, [[General Idea]], and to the ''[[Utne Reader]]'''s use of other published materials.&lt;ref name="NOW Magazine 1987"/&gt; The SPWC was in production in Toronto from 1986 to 1991. Graphic designer [[Bernard Stockl]] became the art director and quickly established the look of the magazine, including the characteristic contents page. Smith and Lowry assembled a photocopied "Journal of Wild Culture" Preview Issue that was circulated in the arts community, and a donation of $5000 "from an anonymous angel" followed, just enough to pay for the printing of the first issue.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview_a" /&gt;

==== Recruitment through social events ====
The premier issue was launched on July 27, 1987 at the Wild Culture Hoedown on Toronto Island. It was described by Smith at the time as "a cross between a literary journal and an arty comic book with ecology as its theme".&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Sun'', July 24, 1987, Marion Kane, "Get Down at Wild Culture Hoedown"., p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Future Wild Culture events followed the format and spirit of the Hoedown by offering down-home high-end cuisine using wild foods and made on site by Chris Klugman, a well-known local chef, and featuring artists whose personae related to nature themes: the Marquis de Sod and Mr. Potatohead were the guests of honour at the launch. Poet Christopher Dewdney, an early contributor to the magazine, said that "half of the experience at "The Journal of Wild Culture" is the parties.) Volume I, Number 1 was sold for $3.95 and 3000 copies were widely distributed in Canada by Disticor, and the issue sold out; later distribution of increased numbers went into the U.S. It developed a small but devoted fan base, particularly in British Columbia. In 1990 its southwestern U.S. distributor reported that the magazine had "a cult following in Texas".

==== Visual language ====
Smith said that Stockl, who died of AIDS-related causes in 1992, was a significant contributor to JWC. "Bernie's deep sense of graphic taste and design intelligence struck the right tone with the first issue: serious like an academic journal but also accessible and visually engaging. In order for the quirkiness to work we needed the credible and elegant look that his gave us". Stockl said he modeled the JWC design after "Harper's" and "Arts and Architecture": "The trick was to create certain effects with what was available to us. Trying to cheat our way through it without it looking like that". The Bernard Franklin Stockl Memorial Scholarship is offered annually at the Alberta College of Design for "creative and innovative exploration in the use of typography for the purpose of communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acad.ab.ca/award_descriptions_winter.html |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310055407/http://www.acad.ab.ca/award_descriptions_winter.html |archivedate=March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Difficulties and demise ====
In the late 1980s, when advertisers were slow to embrace the few existing green magazines, and particularly one which the ''Utne Reader'' editor, [[Eric Utne]], called "indescribable", low ad sales made it difficult to pay the bills and meet that quarterly schedule; only seven issues were published. Two Wild Culture auctions and funding from the federal and provincials arts councils helped take up the slack, but with a low subscription base and advertising revenue, a sudden drop in grant revenue, fund-raising and marketing fatigue, Smith's reluctance to step into the role of "a career publisher",&lt;ref&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine decided to take a sabbatical. More recently Smith commented on his own burn-out keeping the magazine and the SPWC going, the dilemma of the artist-publisher, and the difficulty of keeping cultural magazines afloat in factors relating to demise of JWC. In early 1991, on CBC radio's "Arts Report", it was announced that the magazine was suspending publication. The plan was to pursue a more economically feasible course by following the format of ''[[Granta]]'' magazine, offering it as a trade paperback available in bookstores. A pilot issue of selections from past JWC issues was put out by Somerville House in 1992, ''Wild Culture'', edited by Smith and Lowry, but sales were not encouraging; one explanation for this was that the book did not offer new material.

An attempt by Smith and some new colleagues in 2002 to resurrect the ''Journal of Wild Culture'' online never got off the ground. Smith said that wild culture was "a notion with a mind of its own" and that "the ingredients for a re-launch in 2002 just weren't there".

=== Landscape Readings ===
Landscape Readings were public walking tours led by artists of outdoor environments that held an intellectual or personal interest for the artist. Landscape Readings were a hybrid that combined the attraction of authors reading their own works with a bracing picnic outing in a setting which combines the context for a lecture on ecology, geology, history or biography.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt;

The readings were a project initially conceived by Smith to provide a venue for writer and poet Christopher Dewdney to share his extensive knowledge of palaeozoic geology, among other things, and his sense of humour. In July 1987 he gave the first landscape reading of Toronto's High Park Carolinian forest,&lt;ref&gt;''NOW Magazine'', July 9–15, 1987, Ted Mumford, 'society mines wild culture," p. ?.&lt;/ref&gt; which was documented in the forthcoming issue of ''The Journal of Wild Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Dewdney, photos by David Hlynsky, Fall 1987, "Evidence Revealed During Walk in Park", ''The Journal of Wild Culture'', Vol. I, No. 3., p. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artist guides included [[Gordon Rayner]], [[Hank Hedges]], [[M. T. Kelly]], [[June Callwood]], [[Larry Zolf]], [[Joyce Weiland]], and architect [[Donald Schmitt]]. The Readings were created to "give [SPWC participating] artists a new venue".&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt;

=== The Café of Wild Culture ===
The Café of Wild Culture was conceived in collaboration with bookseller and film programmer [[Marc Glassman]], who recognized that the sense of humour that was so much a part of the 60s and 70s was missing in the 80s.&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', February 4, 1989, Ingrid Hamilton, "Scene and Heard", p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Café was performed first in Toronto at [[The Rivoli]], and later in New York at the Village Gate and at Goddard College in Vermont. Its legitimate non-theatre style &lt;ref name="MetropolisMarch" /&gt; played off the vaudeville and variety revue made up of several short unrelated acts (in the Café's case, no longer than 7 minutes) that caught the wild culture spirit of thoughtful irreverence. Acts ranged from tendentious 'pataphysical lectures, authentic scientific explanations, obtuse dance works, gentlemen's shirt-ironing contests, and wild food cooking demonstrations, in which small servings were provided for the audience, and a game called StorySlide where artists improvised a performed text based on a random photographic slide show.

=== Other programs ===
Smith met his match when he began a project called the Great Festival of the Lakes,&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt; which was to encourage the presentation of community arts festivals in Great Lakes cities.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt; "I was very concerned about water quality issues at the time, and thought that the SPWC needed an activist project to sponsor. I was wrong. Organizing anything around the Great Lakes is like trying to organize Europe. I learned a lot about underestimating scale on that one, and spreading myself too thin". The project was abandoned after a couple of years.

In 1990, the SPWC worked with an organization started by Michael Stadtlander and Jamie Kennedy, Knives and Forks, on Spring Feast,&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt; which became a precursor of future events promoting local chefs and wild and organic foods.

== The Journal of Wild Culture 2.0 ==
From September 2011 Smith's work on the SPWC focused on the online publishing platform, The Journal of Wild Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Whitney|title=Wild Culture info|url=http://www.whitneysmith.ca/wildcultureinfo.htm|work=Information page|publisher=Whitney Smith|accessdate=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was beta-launched in December 2012 in London as www.wildculture.com by an editorial and design team including Smith, Joe Hedges of Branding by Garden, Tom Jeffreys, Sarah Lester, Rosie Jackson and Liam Desroy, continued with Smith, Jeffreys and designer Hedges from February to October 2013, at which time Smith took over sole editorial responsibilities, in collaboration, until 2016, with board members Lisa Wilson and Richard Stursberg; Stursberg continues to participate in an advisory role. The publication has no advertising, sends out a weekly newsletter, is supported by donations and the work of a growing community of international contributors. Current editors and contributing editors under publisher/editor Smith include Chellis Glendinning, Herbert Wright, Chris Lowry, Henry Giroux and illustrator Brad Harley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild Culture, people page|url=http://www.wildculture.com/people|website=The Journal of Wild Culture|publisher=Society for the Preservation of Wild Culture|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The edifice lay in [[Istanbul]], in the district of [[Fatih]], in the neighborhood ({{lang-tr|[[Mahalle]]}}) of [[Ayvansaray, Istanbul|Ayvansaray]]. The only remaining part of the building&amp;nbsp;– the south wall&amp;nbsp;– is enclosed in a modern house at ''Toklu Ibrahim Dede Sokak'', a few meters inside the [[walls of Constantinople|walled]] city, a short distance from the shore of the [[Golden Horn]], at the junction between the [[Blachernae]] wall and the largely pulled down [[Golden Horn]] walls.

===Byzantine Age===
The origin of this building, which was erected at the northern foot of the [[Seven hills of Istanbul|sixth hill]] of [[Constantinople]] in the neighborhood of ''ta Karianou'',&lt;ref name=jamap&gt;Janin (1953), Map of Constantinople&lt;/ref&gt; part of the [[Blachernae]] quarter, is obscure. The small shrine lay on the inner side of the Wall of [[Heraclius]], less than 100 m west of the now demolished Gate of Küçük Ayvansaray (in Greek the Koiliomene Gate) of the [[Walls_of_Constantinople#Golden_Horn_Wall|Golden Horn Walls]], and east of the [[Walls_of_constantinople#Walls_of_Blachernae|Gate of Blachernae]].&lt;ref name=mw302&gt;Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt; The church,&amp;nbsp;– in common with the nearby [[Atik Mustafa Pasha Mosque]], also originally a Byzantine church&amp;nbsp;– has been identified with Saint Thekla of the Palace of [[Blachernae]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Άγία Θέκλα τοῦ Παλατίου τῶν Βλαχερνών}}, ''Hagia Thekla tou Palatiou tōn Vlakhernōn'').&lt;ref name=ey66&gt; According to Semavi Eyice the building could be identified with the church of the Saints Priskos and Nikolaos, a 6th-century foundation. Eyice (1955) p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; However, the building lay too far from the [[Blachernae Palace]], so that this identification, based only on the similarity of the name, should be rejected.&lt;ref name=ja148&gt;Janin (1953), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Stylistically the church belongs to the [[Komnenian era]]  (middle/second half of the 11th century).&lt;ref name=mw206/&gt;&lt;ref name=kr409&gt;Krautheimer (1986), p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the 14th century&amp;nbsp;– in the [[Palaiologan era]]&amp;nbsp;– the church underwent minor architectonic changes and its [[fresco]] decoration was renewed.&lt;ref name=mw206/&gt;
[[File:Naos tis Hagias Theklis.jpg|right|250px|thumb|The mosque viewed from northeast in a drawing of 1877, from A.G. Paspates' ''Byzantine topographical studies'']]

===Ottoman and Turkish Age===
After the [[Fall of Constantinople]] to the Ottomans in 1453, between the end of the 15th and the beginning of the 16th century the church was converted into a small mosque (Mescid) by Toklu Ibrahim Dede, a former soldier of [[Mehmed II|Mehmed the Conqueror]],&lt;ref name=gul248&gt;Gülersoy (1976), p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; who was the custodian of the nearby ''[[türbe]]'' of Ebû Șeybet ül Hudrî, like the more famous [[Abu Ayyub al-Ansari]] (the standard bearer of [[Muhammad]]), a [[Ansar (Islam)|companion]] of the Prophet.&lt;ref name=mw206/&gt; Both died during the [[Siege of Constantinople (674–678)|first Arab siege of Constantinople]] and were buried outside the wall of Heraclius. The ''türbe'' of Ebû Șeybet ül Hudrî is now placed in the citadel between the Wall of Heraclius and that of [[Leo V the Armenian|Leo the Armenian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://istanbulholidays.blogspot.com/2011/02/walls-of-leo-and-heraclius.html|accessdate=20 April 2012|publisher=istanbulholidays.blogspot.com|title=Walls of Leo and Heraclius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the owner of the building demolished it almost completely, leaving in place only the south wall and the apse. With the demolition the paintings, whose existence was known since 1890, came again to light. The first surveying of the remains occurred in 1954. &lt;ref name=mw206/&gt;  As of 2012, only the surviving south wall, enclosed in a new building, and the name of the road where it once lay remember the small edifice.

==Description==

The building had a rectangular plan with external sides of 14.2 m and 6.7 m.&lt;ref name=mw206/&gt; A square single [[Cella|nave]] was surmounted by a [[barrel vault]] and covered at its center by a dome with a diameter of about 4 m.&lt;ref name=kr409/&gt;&lt;ref name=os23&gt;Ousterhout (1987), p.23&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by arches carried by angular piers.&lt;ref name=os23/&gt; The nave was preceded by an [[Narthex|esonarthex]] and ended towards East with a [[bema]] and a polygonal [[apse]] adorned internally and externally with shallow niches.&lt;ref name=mw206/&gt;&lt;ref name=kr409/&gt;&lt;ref name=mw207&gt;Müller Wiener (1977), p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; The plan of the building is similar on a reduced size to that of the [[Chora Church]].&lt;ref name=os23/&gt;  The edifice's  [[brickwork]] consisted of courses of rows of white stones alternating with rows of red [[brick]]s. The external wall were divided with half pillars and with [[lesene]]s surmounted by arches. &lt;ref name=kr409/&gt; The church was decorated with 14th-century frescoes, among them images of the Saints [[Pope Eleuterus|Eleuterus]], [[Saint Abercius|Abercius]], [[Saint Polykarpos|Polykarpos]], [[Saint Spyridon|Spyridon]], [[Procopius of Scythopolis|Procopius]] and [[Nicetas of Remesiana|Nicetas]], some of them framed in [[Medaillon (architecture)|medallions]]. The barrel vault above the altar was decorated with a fresco representing the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=mw206/&gt;

'''Urban fiction''', also known as '''street lit''' or '''street fiction''' is a [[literary genre]] set in a city landscape; however, the genre is as much defined by the socio-economic realities and culture of its characters as the urban setting. The tone for urban fiction is usually dark, focusing on the underside of city living. Profanity, sex, and violence are usually explicit, with the writer not shying away from or watering-down the material. Most authors of this genre draw upon their past experiences to depict their storylines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Urban fiction: words on the street|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/08785ece-86ee-11e5-9f8c-a8d619fa707c.html|newspaper = Financial Times|date = 2015-11-13|access-date = 2016-02-23|issn = 0307-1766|first = Neil|last = Munshi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genesis and historical forces ==
Contemporary urban fiction was (and largely still is) a genre written by [[African Americans]]. In his famous essay "[[The Souls of Black Folk]]", [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] discussed how a veil separated the African American community from the outside world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/114/|title=Du Bois, W. E. B. 1903. The Souls of Black Folk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By extension, fiction written by people outside the African American culture could not (at least with any degree of verisimilitude) depict the people, settings, and events experienced by people in that culture. Try as some might, those who grew up outside the veil (i.e., outside the urban culture) may find it difficult to write fiction grounded in inner-city and African American life.

City novels of yesteryear that depict the low-income survivalist realities of city living can also be considered urban fiction or street lit. In her book, ''The Readers' Advisory Guide to Street Literature'' (2011),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Readers-Advisory-Guide-Street-Literature/dp/0838911102/ The Readers' Advisory Guide to Street Literature (2011)]&lt;/ref&gt; Vanessa Irvin Morris points out that titles considered canonical or "classic" today, could be considered the urban fiction or "street lit" of its day.

Titles that depict historical inner-city realities include Stephen Crane's ''[[Maggie: A Girl of the Streets|Maggie, A Girl of the Streets]]'' (1893), Charles Dickens' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'' (1838), [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]]'s ''[[The Sport of the Gods]]'' (1902) and [[Langston Hughes|Langston Hughes']] The Ballad Of The Landlord (1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Urban fiction (or nonfiction) would not exist without Langston Hughes|url = http://www.chicagonow.com/lupus-purple-reigns/2016/02/urban-fiction-or-nonfiction-would-not-exist-without-langston-hughes/|website = www.chicagonow.com|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://allpoetry.com/The-Ballad-Of-The-Landlord The Ballad Of The Landlord]&lt;/ref&gt; In this vein, urban fiction is not just an African American or Latino phenomenon, but rather, the genre exists along a historical continuum that includes stories from diverse cultural and ethnic experiences.

== Emergence of contemporary urban fiction ==
In the 1970s, during the culmination of the [[Black Power]] movement, a jailed Black man named Robert Beck took the pen name [[Iceberg Slim]] and wrote ''Pimp'', a dark, gritty tale of life in the inner-city underworld. While the book contained elements of the Black Power agenda, it was most notable for its unsparing depiction of street life.

Iceberg Slim wrote many other novels and attained an international following. Some of the terminology he used in his books crossed over into the lexicon of [[African American Vernacular English|Black English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsubculture.com/pop/bio_project/iceberg_slim.html|title=Iceberg Slim: biography, bibliography, filmography and links - Biography Project: An Independent Reference Resource for counterculture-subculture-underground|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers included [[Donald Goines]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0324786/bio]&lt;/ref&gt; and, notably, [[Claude Brown]]'s ''Manchild in the Promised Land'', which was published in 1965. Also published that year was ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm X]]'' by [[Alex Haley]]''.'' Because Haley's non-fictional read captured the realistic nature of African American urban life for coming-of-age young men, the book has consistently served as a standard for reading among African American teenaged boys.

== Hip hop lit: hip hop music as an urban ballad ==
During the 1980s and early 1990s, urban fiction in print experienced a decline. However, one could make a cogent argument that urban tales simply moved from print to music, as [[hip hop music]] exploded in popularity. Of course, for every emcee who signed a recording contract and made the airwaves, ten more amateurs plied the streets and local clubs, much like urban [[bards]], [[griot]]s or [[troubadour]]s telling urban fiction in an informal, oral manner rather than in a neat, written form.

One of the most famous emcees, [[Tupac Shakur]], is sometimes called a ghetto prophet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = INTERVIEWS: Kendrick Lamar CONFIRMS Engagement To Whitney Alford, Calls Tupac Shakur A Prophet, Discusses J. Cole Trying To Sign Him|url = http://www.theybf.com/2015/04/03/interviews-kendrick-lamar-confirms-engagement-to-whitney-alford-calls-tupac-shakur-a|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an author of urban fiction in lyrical form. Shakur's early poetry was posthumously compiled into a volume entitled ''[[The Rose That Grew from Concrete (book)|The Rose That Grew from Concrete]]'' in 1999.

Modern hip-hop literature in print form is a thriving and popular genre.&lt;ref&gt;PINTO, C. "Urban lit blazes off bookshelves." Gannett News Service. 2009, August 31&lt;/ref&gt; Many non-fiction publications from figures in the hip-hop realm such as [[Russell Simmons]], [[Kevin Liles]], [[LL Cool J]], and [[FUBU]] founder [[Daymond John]] feature prominently in this genre. [[Karrine Steffans]] and shock jock [[Wendy Williams (radio host)|Wendy Williams]] have written blockbuster books for this audience. Both Steffans and emcee [[50 Cent]] have had such success with their books that they were given their own imprints to usher in similar authors, such as for [[50 Cent]]'s [[G-Unit Books]].

== Contemporary street lit: The new wave of urban fiction ==

===1990s===
Toward the end of the 1990s, urban fiction experienced a revival, as demand for novels authentically conveying the urban experience increased, and new [[business models]] enabled fledgling writers to more easily bring a manuscript to market and to libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Urban Fiction Makes Its Way From Streets to Libraries|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/23/nyregion/23fiction.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 2008-10-22|access-date = 2016-02-23|issn = 0362-4331|first = Anne|last = Barnard}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first writers in this new cycle of urban fiction was [[Omar Tyree]], who published the novel ''[[Flyy Girl]]'' in 1996, reissued as a reprint in 1999.

The genre gained significant momentum in 1999 with [[Sister Souljah]]'s bestseller ''[[The Coldest Winter Ever]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(Morris, Hughes-Hassell, Agosto, &amp; Cottman, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Teri Woods]]'s ''True to the Game'' was also published in 1999, and became the standard from which the entrepreneurial publishing and distribution of contemporary urban fiction took note. The simultaneous publishing of these three novels created a momentum of readership for urban fiction and carried that wave for years. Thus ''The Coldest Winter Ever'', ''True to the Game'', and ''Flyy Girl'' are considered classics in the renaissance of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;(Morris, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sister Souljah describes the untapped market for urban fiction and the stereotypes that held it back in its early years:

{{Cquote|The publishing industry did not realize that there was a huge market of Black readers. A lot of people in publishing fell into the same stereotypes that people in the mainstream fall victim to: that Black people either can't read or can't write, or don't read and don't write [...] When ''The Coldest Winter Ever'' came out... it took to task those stereotypes and showed that, yes, Black people love great stories like every other people from every other culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Melody K.|title=Urban fiction set to heat up the summer with hot new titles|journal=JET|date=April 7, 2008|volume=113|issue=13|pages=50|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===2000–present===
In less than a decade, urban fiction has experienced a renaissance that boasts thousands of titles. The newest wave of street fiction is urban Latino fiction novels such as ''Devil's Mambo'' by Jerry Rodriguez, Chained by Deborah Cardona (a.k.a. Sexy) and [[Jeff Rivera]]'s ''Forever My Lady''.

Major writers of contemporary urban fiction include [[Wahida Clark]], [[Vickie Stringer]], [[Nikki Turner]], [[Kole Black]], [[K'wan Foye|K'wan]], [[Toy Styles]], Kwame Teague, who many believed penned [[Teri Woods]]' ''Dutch'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Message from the Penitentiary|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/seth-ferranti/a-message-from-the-penite_b_9212556.html|website = The Huffington Post|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the writing duo [[Meesha Mink]] &amp; De'Nesha Diamond.

There is also an unexpected literary wave of hip-hop fiction and street lit, which was sparked by Sister Souljah.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Authors with a book or books in this offering include [[Saul Williams]], [[Abiola Abrams]], and [[Felicia Pride]]. These are hip hop lit or street lit books that take a more literary approach using metaphor, signifying and other literary devices. These books may also be used in socially redeeming or classroom capacities, while maintaining love and positivity for the music and hip hop culture.

With this new wave of renaissance, "street lit" was breaking new ground when it came to promotion and exposure. Aside from hand-to-hand sales, which seems to work best in a genre where word-of-mouth has proven to be worth more than any large ad campaign, the Internet has increased the authors' and publishers' ability to reach out to the genre's readers.

With Internet savvy, many self-published authors who once had no shot of recognition are now household names, such as author Rasheed Clark, who went from relatively unknown, to being honored with fourteen Infini Literary Award nominations for his first two novels, ''Stories I Wouldn't Tell Nobody But God'' and ''Cold Summer Afternoon'', both of which became instant bestsellers and proved that Clark was a fresh voice in African American fiction, and a leading African-American writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Jessie Carney|title=Encyclopedia of African American Popular Culture [Four Volumes]|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313357978|pages=507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors in this genre such as [[K'wan|K'wan Foye]], Nikki Turner, [[Toy Styles]], Kole Black, are known for bringing street teams and other musical promotion efforts to the book scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Tome Rule: Toy Styles can write a novel in a week. But can she dominate the cutthroat world of street lit? - Washington City Paper|url = http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/articles/36077/tome-rule|website = Washington City Paper|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, some of these authors have joined with hip hop artists such as 50 Cent to further promote the genre by penning the musicians' real-life stories.

In 2010, the hip hop music label, Cash Money Records, established a publishing branch to their brand, Cash Money Content. However, Cash Money Content's last book, ''Animal 3'', was published in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = K’wan Animal III:Revelations set to release Nov. 4th!|url = http://cashmoneycontent.com/kwan-animal-iiirevelations-set-to-release-nov-4th/|website = Cash Money Content|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vickie Stringer is an urban lit author, as well as founder and CEO of her own publishing company, Triple Crown Publications, a publisher of 45 novels and 35 writers as of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Melody K.|title=Urban fiction set to heat up the summer with hot new titles|journal=JET|date=April 7, 2008|volume=113|issue=13|pages=48|issn=0021-5996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forums like [[AALBC.com|AALBC]] are often used to keep track of the progressive urban fiction genre as it grows tremendously daily.

===Criticism===
Early criticism of street lit was that books were badly edited due to lack of [[copy editing]] by independent publishers.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Simone Cade|title=Critical Engagements: Adolescent African American Girls &amp; Urban Fiction|year=2009|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109198478|pages=23–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in recent years the mainstream publishing industry recognized the genre's potential and signed many street lit authors to contracts, thus producing better packaged product. One such author was Treasure E. Blue, according to Kirkus Reviews Magazine, a self-published sensation—it has reportedly sold 65,000 copies before getting signed to a major six-figure deal with Random House Publishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HARLEM GIRL LOST by Treasure E. Blue |url = https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/treasure-e-blue/harlem-girl-lost/|website = [[Kirkus Reviews]] |access-date = 2016-02-23|language = en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reach of urban fiction into a large youth readership is undeniable today. Researchers have turned their attention to its influence on urban literacy, particularly among adolescent girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Simone Cade|title=Critical Engagements: Adolescent African American Girls &amp; Urban Fiction|year=2009|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=9781109198478|pages=24–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite misgivings about editing quality issues, secondary school teachers in suburban settings have included urban literature in curricula, referring to it as "multicultural young adult literature" to expose students to "authentic" voices representing urban life.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
