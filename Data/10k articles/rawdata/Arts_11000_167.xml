'''Aaron Siskind''' (December 4, 1903 – February 8, 1991) was an American [[photographer]]. He is considered to be closely involved with, if not a part of, the [[abstract expressionist]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10051&amp;texttype=2 Abstract Expressionism - Museum of Modern Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

Siskind was a grade school English teacher in the New York Public School System for 25 years, and began photography when he received a camera as a wedding gift and began taking pictures on his honeymoon. Early in his career Siskind was a member of the New York [[Photo League]], where he produced several significant socially conscious series of images in the 1930s, among them "Harlem Document".

Siskind's work focuses on the details of nature and [[architecture]]. He presents them as flat surfaces to create a new image which stands independent of the original subject. For some his work has been described as crossing the line between photography and painting, his photographs are works unique to the art form of photography.

== Life ==
Born in [[New York City]], Siskind grew up on the Lower East Side. Shortly after graduating from [[City College of New York|City College]], he became a public school English teacher. In 1950 Siskind met [[Harry Callahan (photographer)|Harry Callahan]] when both were teaching at [[Black Mountain College]] in the summer. Later, Callahan persuaded Siskind to join him as part of the faculty of the [[IIT Institute of Design]] in Chicago (founded by [[László Moholy-Nagy]] as the [[New Bauhaus]]). In 1971 he followed Callahan (who had left in 1961) by his invitation to teach at the Rhode Island School of Design, until both retired in the late 1970s. Siskind's monumental work includes works done in Rome in 1963 and 1967, Mexico in the 1970s, and in the 1980s works such as the Tar Series in Providence, Vermont, and Route 88 near Westport, Rhode Island. He continued making photographs until his death on February 8, 1991.

'''Alfred Angelo Bridal''' was one of the world's largest manufacturers and retailers of [[wedding dresses]]. The company was headquartered in [[Delray Beach, Florida]]. While Alfred Angelo was most recognized for its wedding dress fashions, the company also designed [[bridesmaid]] dresses, fashions for the mother of the bride, flower girl dresses, and wedding accessories. In 2014, Alfred Angelo celebrated 80 years of dressing brides.

In 2017, Alfred Angelo abruptly closed all of its store locations and filed for [[Chapter 7, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 7]] bankruptcy liquidation.

== History ==
The company was founded by Alfred Angelo and his wife Edythe Piccione in the mid-1930s in [[Philadelphia]]. Edythe designed the dresses and Alfred's focus was on ensuring quality manufacturing and business development. In the 1980s, the Piccione children, Vincent and Michele Piccione, began managing the company and did so for the next 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alfredangelo.com/Company/AboutUs.aspx History about the company]&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was featured on a 2013 episode of the television show ''[[Undercover Boss]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/undercover_boss/bios/1001462/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826115544/http://www.cbs.com/shows/undercover_boss/bios/1001462/ |archive-date=2014-08-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Stores and collections ==
Designs were sold in over 2,500 stores in 34 countries. The company's wedding dress collections included the Alfred Angelo Collection, Modern Vintage by Alfred Angelo, Alfred Angelo Sapphire, Truly Forever by Alfred Angelo, and [[Disney]] Fairy Tale Weddings by Alfred Angelo, a collaboration with Disney that started in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/beauty/disney-debuts-movie-princess-inspired-wedding-gowns-2395365/#photoViewer=1 Disney debuts movie princess-inspired wedding gowns]&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred Angelo dresses were sold at Alfred Angelo retail "Signature Stores" and retailers in the United States.

== Bankruptcy ==

On July 13, 2017, the company filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation and immediately closed all of its stores.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2017/07/14/alfred-angelo-closes-files-bankruptcy-and-leaves-brides-empty-handed/480832001/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2017/07/14/brides-panic-as-alfred-angelo-closes-stores-nationwide/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''In re Alfred Angelo (Australia) Pty, Ltd.'', Ch. 7 petition filed July 14, 2017, case no. 17-18884-EPK, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida; ''In re Alfred Angelo - The Bride's Studio, No. 3, Inc.'', Ch. 7 petition filed July 14, 2017, case no. 17-18871-PGH, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida; ''In re Alfred Angelo Canada ULC'', Ch. 7 petition filed July 14, 2017, case no. 17-18886-EPK, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida; ''In re Alfred Angelo Investment China I'', Ch. 7 petition filed July 14, 2017, case no. 17-18887-EPK, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida; ''In re Alfred Angelo Investment China III'', Ch. 7 petition filed July 14, 2017, case no. 17-18888-PGH, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida; ''In re Alfred Angelo Investment Company, Limited (Hong Kong)'', Ch. 7 petition filed July 14, 2017, case no. 17-18898-EPK, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida; ''In re Alfred Angelo Newco, Inc.'', Ch. 7 petition filed July 14, 2017, case no. 17-18900-EPK, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was led by the politically neutral writer [[Lao She]] and membership ranged from 100 to 400 writers during the years of the organization's existence. Notable members included [[Mao Dun]], [[Ding Ling]], [[Ba Jin]], [[Lin Yutang]], [[Shi Zhecun]], and many others.

'''''All Quiet on the Western Front''''' ({{lang-de|Im Westen nichts Neues|lit=In the West Nothing New}}) is a novel by [[Erich Maria Remarque]], a German veteran of [[World War I]]. The book describes the German soldiers' extreme physical and mental stress during the war, and the detachment from civilian life felt by many of these soldiers upon returning home from the front.

The novel was first published in November and December 1928 in the German newspaper ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' and in book form in late January 1929. The book and its sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]'' (1930), were among the books banned and [[Nazi book burnings|burned]] in [[Nazi Germany]]. ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' sold 2.5 million copies in 22 languages in its first 18 months in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, the book was adapted as an Academy-Award-winning [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|film of the same name]], directed by [[Lewis Milestone]]. It was adapted again in 1979 by [[Delbert Mann]], this time as [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1979 film)|a television film]] starring [[Richard Thomas (actor)|Richard Thomas]] and [[Ernest Borgnine]].

==Title and translation==
The English translation by [[Arthur Wesley Wheen]] gives the title as '' All Quiet on the Western Front''. The literal translation of "Im Westen nichts Neues" is "In the West Nothing New," with "West" being the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]]; the phrase refers to the content of an official communiqué at the end of the novel.

[[Brian O Murdoch|Brian Murdoch's]] 1993 translation would render the phrase as "there was nothing new to report on the Western Front" within the narrative. Explaining his retention of the original book-title, he says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although it does not match the German exactly, Wheen's title has justly become part of the English language and is retained here with gratitude.

The phrase "all quiet on the Western Front" has become a colloquial expression meaning stagnation, or lack of visible change, in any context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/all+quiet+on+the+Western+Front|title=all quiet on the Western Front|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|access-date=2017-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book tells the story of Paul Bäumer who belongs to a group of German soldiers on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] during [[World War I]]. The patriotic speeches of his teacher Kantorek had led the whole class to volunteer for military service shortly after the start of [[World War I]]. His class was "scattered over the platoons amongst [[Frisians|Frisian]] fishermen, peasants, and labourers." Bäumer arrives at the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] with his friends and schoolmates (Leer, Müller, Kropp and a number of other characters). There they meet Stanislaus Katczinsky, an older soldier, nicknamed Kat, who becomes Paul's mentor. While fighting at the front, Bäumer and his comrades have to engage in frequent battles and endure the treacherous and filthy conditions of trench warfare.

At the beginning of the book, Remarque writes, "This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand face to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped (its) shells, were destroyed by the war."&lt;ref name="DestroyedByWar" /&gt; The book does not focus on heroic stories of bravery, but rather gives a view of the conditions in which the soldiers find themselves. The monotony between battles, the constant threat of [[artillery]] fire and bombardments, the struggle to find food, the lack of training of young recruits (meaning lower chances of survival), and the overarching role of random chance in the lives and deaths of the soldiers are described in detail. They had been forced into the army.

The battles fought here have no names and seem to have little overall significance, except for the impending possibility of injury or death for Bäumer and his comrades. Only pitifully small pieces of land are gained, about the size of a football field, which are often lost again later. Remarque often refers to the living soldiers as old and dead, emotionally drained and shaken. "We are not youth any longer. We don't want to take the world by storm. We are fleeing from ourselves, from our life. We were eighteen and had begun to love life and the world; and we had to shoot it to pieces."

Paul's visit on leave to his home highlight the cost of the war on his psyche. The town has not changed since he went off to war; however, he finds that he does "not belong here anymore, it is a foreign world."  He feels disconnected from most of the townspeople. His father asks him "stupid and distressing" questions about his war experiences, not understanding "that a man cannot talk of such things."  An old schoolmaster lectures him about strategy and advancing to Paris while insisting that Paul and his friends know only their "own little sector" of the war but nothing of the big picture.

Indeed, the only person he remains connected to is his dying mother, with whom he shares a tender, yet restrained relationship. The night before he is to return from leave, he stays up with her, exchanging small expressions of love and concern for each other. He thinks to himself, "Ah! Mother, Mother! How can it be that I must part from you?  Here I sit and there you are lying; we have so much to say, and we shall never say it."  In the end, he concludes that he "ought never to have come [home] on leave."

Paul feels glad to be reunited with his comrades. Soon after, he volunteers to go on a patrol and kills a man for the first time in hand-to-hand combat. He watches the man die, in pain for hours. He feels remorse and asks forgiveness from the man's corpse. He is devastated and later confesses to Kat and Albert, who try to comfort him and reassure him that it is only part of the war.
They are then sent on what Paul calls a "good job." They must guard a supply depot in a village that was evacuated due to being shelled too heavily. During this time, the men are able to adequately feed themselves, unlike the near-starvation conditions in the German trenches. In addition, the men enjoy themselves while living off the spoils from the village and officers' luxuries from the supply depot (such as fine cigars). While evacuating the villagers (enemy civilians), Paul and Albert are taken by surprise by artillery fired at the civilian convoy and wounded by a shell. On the train back home, Albert takes a turn for the worse and cannot complete the journey, instead being sent off the train to recuperate in a Catholic hospital.
Paul uses a combination of bartering and manipulation to stay by Albert's side. Albert eventually has his leg amputated, while Paul is deemed fit for service and returned to the front.

By now, the war is nearing its end and the German Army is retreating. In despair, Paul watches as his friends fall one by one. It is the death of Kat that eventually makes Paul careless about living. In the final chapter, he comments that peace is coming soon, but he does not see the future as bright and shining with hope. Paul feels that he has no aims or goals left in life and that their generation will be different and misunderstood.

In October 1918, Paul is finally killed on a remarkably peaceful day. The situation report from the frontline states a simple phrase: "All quiet on the Western Front." Paul's corpse displays a calm expression on its face, "as though almost glad the end had come."

==Themes==
One of the major themes of the novel is the difficulty of soldiers to revert to civilian life after having experienced extreme combat situations. Remarque comments in the preface that "[This book] will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped its shells, were destroyed by the war."&lt;ref name="DestroyedByWar"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5UVJYPUw18AC&amp;pg=PA48&amp;dq=%22It+will+try+simply+to+tell+of+a+generation+of+men+who,+even+though+they+may+have+escaped+its+shells,+were+destroyed+by+the+war.%22 |title=Erich Maria Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front |page=48 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This internal destruction can be found as early as the first chapter as Paul comments that, although all the boys are young, their youth has left them. In addition, the massive loss of life and negligible gains from the fighting are constantly emphasized. Soldiers' lives are thrown away by their commanding officers who are stationed comfortably away from the front, ignorant of the daily terrors of the front line.

==Main characters==
[[Image:AllQuietOnTheWesternFront.jpg|thumb|Cover of first English language edition. The design is based upon a German [[war bonds]] poster by [[Fritz Erler (painter)|Fritz Erler]].]]

===Albert Kropp===
Kropp was in Paul's class at school and is described as the clearest thinker of the group as well as the smallest. Kropp is wounded towards the end of the novel and undergoes a [[leg amputation]]. Both he and Bäumer end up spending time in a [[Catholic]] hospital together, Bäumer suffering from shrapnel wounds to the leg and arm. Though Kropp initially plans to commit [[suicide]] if he requires an amputation, the book suggests he postponed suicide because of the strength of military camaraderie. Kropp and Bäumer part ways when Bäumer is recalled to his regiment after recovering. Paul comments that saying farewell was "very hard, but it is something a soldier learns to deal with."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter Ten of All Quiet on the Western Front&lt;/ref&gt;

===Haie Westhus===
Haie is described as being tall and strong, and a [[peat]]-digger by profession. Overall, his size and behavior make him seem older than Paul, yet he is the same age as Paul and his school-friends (roughly 19 at the start of the book). Haie, in addition, has a good sense of humour. During combat, he is injured in his back, fatally (Chapter 6)—the resulting wound is large enough for Paul to see Haie's breathing lung when Himmelstoß (Himmelstoss) carries him to safety.

===Friedrich Müller===
Müller is about 18 and a half years of age, one of Bäumer's classmates, when he also joins the German army as a volunteer to go to the war. Carrying his old school books with him to the battlefield, he constantly reminds himself of the importance of learning and education. Even while under enemy fire, he "mutters propositions in physics". He became interested in Kemmerich's boots and inherits them when Kemmerich dies early in the novel. He is killed later in the book after being shot point-blank in the stomach with a "light pistol" (flare gun). As he was dying "quite conscious and in terrible pain", he gave his boots which he inherited from Kemmerich to Paul.

===Stanislaus "Kat" Katczinsky===
Kat has the most positive influence on Paul and his comrades on the battlefield. Katczinsky was a cobbler ([[shoemaker]]) in civilian life; he is older than Paul Bäumer and his comrades, about 40 years old, and serves as their leadership figure. He also represents a literary model highlighting the differences between the younger and older soldiers. While the older men have already had a life of professional and personal experience before the war, Bäumer and the men of his age have had little life experience or time for personal growth.

Kat is also well known for his ability to scavenge nearly any item needed, especially food. At one point he secures four boxes of lobster. Bäumer describes Kat as possessing a [[Extrasensory perception|sixth sense]]. One night, Bäumer along with a group of other soldiers are holed up in a factory with neither rations nor comfortable bedding. Katczinsky leaves for a short while, returning with straw to put over the bare wires of the beds. Later, to feed the hungry men, Kat brings bread, a bag of horse flesh, a lump of fat, a pinch of salt and a pan in which to cook the food.

Kat is hit by shrapnel at the end of the story, leaving him with a smashed shin. Paul carries him back to camp on his back, only to discover upon their arrival that a stray splinter had hit Kat in the back of the head and killed him on the way. He is thus the last of Paul's close friends to die in battle. It is Kat's death that eventually makes Bäumer indifferent as to whether he survives the war or not, yet certain that he can face the rest of his life without fear. "Let the months and the years come, they can take nothing from me, they can take nothing more. I am so alone, and so without hope that I can confront them without fear."

=== Tjaden ===
One of Bäumer's non-schoolmate friends. Before the war, Tjaden was a locksmith. A big eater with a grudge against the former postman-turned corporal Himmelstoß (thanks to his strict "disciplinary actions"), he manages to forgive Himmelstoß later in the book. Throughout the book, Paul frequently remarks on how much of an eater he is, yet somehow manages to stay as "thin as a rake". He appears in the sequel, ''[[The Road Back]]''.

==Minor characters==

===Kantorek===
Kantorek was the [[schoolmaster]] of Paul and his friends, including  Kropp, Leer, Müller, and Behm. Behaving "in a way that cost [him] nothing," Kantorek is a strong supporter of the war and encourages Bäumer and other students in his class to join the war effort. Among twenty enlistees was Joseph Behm, the first of the class to die in battle. In an example of tragic irony, Behm was the only one who did not want to enter the war.

Kantorek is a hypocrite, urging the young men he teaches to fight in the name of patriotism, while not voluntarily enlisting himself. In a twist of fate, Kantorek is later called up as a soldier as well. He very reluctantly joins the ranks of his former students, only to be drilled and taunted by Mittelstädt, one of the students he had earlier persuaded to enlist.

===Peter Leer===
Leer is an intelligent soldier in Bäumer's company, and one of his classmates. He is very popular with women; when he and his comrades meet three French women, he is the first to seduce one of them. Bäumer describes Leer's ability to attract women by saying "Leer is an old hand at the game". In chapter 11, Leer is hit by a shell fragment, which also hits Bertinck. The shrapnel tears open Leer's hip, causing him to bleed to death quickly. His death causes Paul to ask himself, "What use is it to him now that he was such a good mathematician in school?"&lt;ref&gt;''All Quiet on the Western Front'' (London: Putnam &amp; Company Ltd, 1970 reprint), p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bertinck===
Lieutenant Bertinck is the leader of Bäumer's [[Company (military)|company]]. His men have a great respect for him, and Bertinck has great respect for his men. He permits them to eat the rations of the men that had been killed in action, standing up to the chef Ginger who would only allow them their allotted share. Bertinck is genuinely despondent when he learns that few of his men had survived an engagement.

When he and the other characters are trapped in a trench under heavy attack, Bertinck, who has been injured in the firefight, spots a flamethrower team advancing on them. He gets out of cover and takes aim on the flamethrower but misses, and gets hit by enemy fire. With his next shot he kills the flamethrower, and immediately afterwards an enemy shell explodes on his position blowing off his chin. The same explosion also fatally wounds Leer.

===Himmelstoss===
Corporal Himmelstoss (spelled Himmelstoß in some editions) was a postman before enlisting in the war. He is a power-hungry corporal with special contempt for Paul and his friends, taking sadistic pleasure in punishing the minor infractions of his trainees during their basic training in preparation for their deployment. Paul later figures that the training taught by Himmelstoss made them "hard, suspicious, pitiless, and tough" but most importantly it taught them comradeship. However, Bäumer and his comrades have a chance to get back at Himmelstoss because of his punishments, mercilessly whipping him on the night before they board trains to go to the front.

Himmelstoss later joins them at the front, revealing himself as a coward who shirks his duties for fear of getting hurt or killed, and pretends to be wounded because of a scratch on his face. Paul Bäumer beats him because of it and when a lieutenant comes along looking for men for a trench charge, Himmelstoss joins and leads the charge. He carries Haie Westhus's body to Bäumer after he is fatally wounded. Matured and repentant through his experiences Himmelstoß later asks for forgiveness from his previous charges. As he becomes the new staff cook, to prove his friendship he secures two pounds of sugar for Bäumer and half a pound of butter for Tjaden.

===Detering===
Detering is a farmer who constantly longs to return to his wife and farm. He is also fond of horses and is angered when he sees them used in combat. He says, "It is of the vilest baseness to use horses in the war," when the group hears several wounded horses writhe and scream for a long time before dying during a bombardment. He tries to shoot them to put them out of their misery, but is stopped by Kat to keep their current position hidden. He is driven to desert when he sees a cherry tree in blossom, which reminds him of home too much and inspires him to leave. He is found by military police and court-martialed, and is never heard from again.

===Josef Hamacher===
Hamacher is a patient at the Catholic hospital where Paul and Albert Kropp are temporarily stationed. He has an intimate knowledge of the workings of the hospital. He also has a "Special Permit," certifying him as sporadically not responsible for his actions due to a head wound, though he is clearly quite sane and exploiting his permit so he can stay in the hospital and away from the war as long as possible.

===Franz Kemmerich===
A young boy of only 19 years. Franz Kemmerich had enlisted in the army for World War I along with his best friend and classmate, Bäumer. Kemmerich is shot in the leg early in the story; his injured leg has to be amputated, and he dies shortly after. In anticipation of Kemmerich's imminent death, Müller was eager to get his boots. While in the hospital, someone steals Kemmerich's watch that he intended to give to his mother, causing him great distress and prompting him to ask about his watch every time his friends visit him in the hospital. Paul later finds the watch and hands it over to Kemmerich's mother, only to lie and say Franz died instantly and painlessly when questioned.

===Joseph Behm===
A student in Paul's class who is described as youthful and overweight. Behm was the only student that was not quickly influenced by Kantorek's patriotism to join the war, but eventually, due to pressure from friends and Kantorek, he joins the war. He is the first of Paul's friends to die. He is blinded in [[no man's land]] and believed to be dead by his friends. The next day, when he is seen walking blindly around [[no-man's-land]], it is discovered that he was only unconscious. However, he is killed before he can be rescued.

==Publication and reception==
From November 10 to December 9, 1928, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' was published in serial form in ''[[Vossische Zeitung]]'' magazine. It was released in book form the following year to smashing success, selling one and a half million copies that same year. Although publishers had worried that interest in [[World War I]] had waned more than 10 years after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]], Remarque's realistic depiction of trench warfare from the perspective of young soldiers struck a chord with the war's survivors—soldiers and civilians alike—and provoked strong reactions, both positive and negative, around the world.

With ''All Quiet on the Western Front'', Remarque emerged as an eloquent spokesman for a generation that had been, in his own words, "destroyed by war, even though it might have escaped its shells." Remarque's harshest critics, in turn, were his countrymen, many of whom felt the book denigrated the German war effort, and that Remarque had exaggerated the horrors of war to further his pacifist agenda. The strongest voices against Remarque came from the emerging [[Nazi Party]] and its ideological allies. In 1933, when the Nazis rose to power, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' became one of the first [[degenerate art|degenerate books]] to be publicly burnt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/remarque-publishes-all-quiet-on-the-western-front|title=Nov 10, 1928: Remarque publishes All Quiet on the Western Front|work=[[History.com]]|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1930, screenings of the [[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|Academy Award-winning film based on the book]] were met with Nazi-organized protests and mob attacks on both movie theatres and audience members.&lt;ref name=SI&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sauer|first1=Patrick|title=The Most Loved and Hated Novel About World War I|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/most-loved-and-hated-novel-about-world-war-I-180955540/|website=Smithsonian.com|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=June 21, 2015|date=June 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, objections to Remarque’s portrayal of the German army personnel during World War I were not limited to the Nazis. Dr. Karl Kroner ([[:de:Karl Kroner|de]]) objected to Remarque’s depiction of the medical personnel as being inattentive, uncaring, or absent from frontline action. Dr. Kroner was specifically worried that the book would perpetuate German stereotypes abroad that had subsided since the First World War. He offered the following clarification: “People abroad will draw the following conclusions: if German doctors deal with their own fellow countrymen in this manner, what acts of inhumanity will they not perpetuate against helpless prisoners delivered up into their hands or against the populations of occupied territory?”&lt;ref name="clardy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front#Reception|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130615102102/http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/All_Quiet_on_the_Western_Front#Reception|dead-url=yes|archive-date=June 15, 2013|title=All Quiet on the Western Front: Reception|author=Patrick Clardy|work=Yale Modernism Lab|accessdate=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barker"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Christine R.|last1=Barker|first2=Rex William|last2=Last|title=Erich Maria Remarque|location=New York|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fellow patient of Remarque’s in the military hospital in [[Duisburg]] objected to the negative depictions of the nuns and patients, and of the general portrayal of soldiers: “There were soldiers to whom the protection of homeland, protection of house and homestead, protection of family were the highest objective, and to whom this will to protect their homeland gave the strength to endure any extremities.”&lt;ref name="barker"/&gt;

These criticisms suggest that perhaps experiences of the war and the personal reactions of individual soldiers to their experiences may be more diverse than Remarque portrays them; however, it is beyond question that Remarque gives voice to a side of the war and its experience that was overlooked or suppressed at the time. This perspective is crucial to understanding the true effects of World War I. The evidence can be seen in the lingering depression that Remarque and many of his friends and acquaintances were suffering a decade later.&lt;ref name="clardy"/&gt;

In contrast, ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' was trumpeted by [[pacifists]] as an anti-war book.&lt;ref name="barker"/&gt; Remarque makes a point in the opening statement that the novel does not advocate any political position, but is merely an attempt to describe the experiences of the soldier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Hans|last=Wagner|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=uk&amp;id=sPH4NyyUlmAC&amp;dq=0-87249-740-2&amp;q=night+in+lisbon#v=snippet&amp;q=night%20in%20lisbon&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Erich Maria Remarque|location=Columbia, SC|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main artistic criticism was that it was a mediocre attempt to cash in on public sentiment.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} The enormous popularity the work received was a point of contention for some literary critics, who scoffed at the fact that such a simple work could be so earth-shattering.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Much of this literary criticism came from [[Salomo Friedlaender]], who wrote a book ''Hat Erich Maria Remarque wirklich gelebt?'' "Did Erich Maria Remarque really live?" (under pen name Mynona), which was, in its turn, criticized in: ''Hat Mynona wirklich gelebt?'' "Did Mynona really live?" by [[Kurt Tucholsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Tucholsky (under pen name Ignaz Wrobel), [http://www.textlog.de/tucholsky-mynona-wirklich.html ''Hat Mynona wirklich gelebt?''], ''Die Weltbühne'', December 31, 1929, No. 1, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Friedlaender’s criticism was mainly personal in nature—he attacked Remarque as being ego-centric and greedy. Remarque publicly stated that he wrote ''All Quiet on the Western Front'' for personal reasons, not for profit, as Friedlaender had charged.&lt;ref name="clardy" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barker" /&gt;   {{Interlanguage link multi|Max Joseph Wolff|de}} wrote a parody titled ''Vor Troja nichts Neues'' (''Compared to Troy, Nothing New'') under the pseudonym ''Emil Marius Requark''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://d-nb.info/578423782 Catalogue entry] for ''Vor Troja nichts Neues'' in the German National Library, retrieved January 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Architecture Brio''' is an [[India]]n design studio set up in [[Mumbai]] in 2006. The team of architects is led by Shefali Balwani ([[Center for Environmental Planning and Technology]], [[India]]) and  Robert Verrijt ([[Technical University Delft]], [[the Netherlands]]).

==History==
Architecture BRIO is a design studio focusing primarily on the fields of [[architecture]], interior and [[sustainable]] design.
The work of Architecture BRIO is characterized by a conceptual approach towards understanding and reinterpreting the specific context in which it is located. One of their first projects, a design proposal for a Dormitory at the Magic Bus Campus, received critically acclaim&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inhabitat.com/2008/11/05/magic-bus-dormitory/ Inhabitat Article on Architecture BRIO's sustainable design]&lt;/ref&gt; and was featured in the publication Architecture of Change 2&lt;ref&gt;Architecture of Change 2, Sustainability and Humanity in the Built Environment [https://archive.is/20090816180911/http://www.gestalten.com/books/detail?id=ceaea7651fc964c301225ac46ae802b5]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Ten years later, Architecture BRIO's work field spans the vast variety of cultures, climates and landscapes across the Indian Subcontinent and South East Asia. Each project is seen as a challenge and opportunity to uncover the unique characteristics of these specific conditions, investigating which intervention has a potential for positive change and impact in the way we deal with our natural and built world. Simultaneously the studio believes that architecture should remain a backdrop to life rather than taking centre stage. In order for Architecture is to have a long lasting sensory impact it needs to evoke the urge to be discovered.
The work of Architecture BRIO has since been published widely in national and international media. The Riparian House was featured in the BBC documentary series [[The World's Most Extraordinary Homes]].

==Awards==
Architecture Brio has been the recipient of several prestigious awards. [[Robert Verrijt]] was awarded the second prize in the Dutch Archiprix 2004 &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130703121915/http://www.archiprix.archined.nl/e/2004/inclusive_e.html Dutch Archiprix 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; for his design of an Asylum Seekers Centre in Maastricht. Together with [[Floris Cornelisse]] he won the first prize for the entry [https://web.archive.org/web/20130728130442/http://www.europan.nl/detail-winner/items/78.html Triade] in the [[Europan]] 8 Competition 2005.

'''''Cadence''''' (also known as Stockade) is a 1990 film directed by (and starring) [[Martin Sheen]], in which [[Charlie Sheen]] plays an [[inmate]] in a [[United States Army]] [[military prison]] in [[West Germany]] during the 1960s.  Sheen plays alongside his father [[Martin Sheen]] and brother [[Ramon Estevez]]. The film is based on a novel by [[Gordon Weaver]].

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=June 2016}}
Franklin Bean (Charlie Sheen) is shown in flashback with his father, a [[postal worker]] at his high school. His poor performance is attributed to a lack of discipline which a school officials assures the elder Bean can be fixed with a stint in the Army. Then, in present day, [[Private First Class|PFC]] Bean is attending his father's funeral before returning to his duty station in Germany. In his state of grief he gets [[drunk]], punches an [[Military police|MP]] and breaks through a plate-glass window in a local bar. Bean's army lawyer secures a plea deal, struck by his attorney Captain Ramon Garcia (Abraham), in lieu of a court martial which involves him removing unauthorized tattoos from his hands (obtained during his drunken rampage), paying for a broken window and serving 90 days in the camp [[stockade]]. He is met at the gates by a decorated Korean War veteran Master Sergeant named Otis McKinney (Martin Sheen). 

McKinney explains that the stockade is fairly small and, as a result, he is in complete charge of the compound while being supported by two guards; Corporals Harold Lamar and Gerald Gessner. Bean finds a sympathetic ear in stockade guard Corporal Lamar after learning he is just as afraid of McKinney and only "serving his own time." Gessner is a somewhat spineless lackey to McKinney whom he clearly admires and respects. 

Bean is introduced to his fellow prisoners, all of them black and led by section leader Roosevelt Stokes (Fishburne). Stokes is serving an unspecified sentence for larceny and, despite his conviction, apparently retains his rank of [[Corporal]]. Bean resists McKinney by refusing to refer to him as [[sergeant]] and refusing most military customs and courtesies. The prisoner detail is regularly trucked to a nearby farm where they perform manual labor such as digging ditches and building fences. While there, Bean becomes obsessed with a nonfunctional and off-limits [[windmill]]. He requests permission to repair the windmill from MSgt McKinney through Corporal Lamar but his request is denied. Bean submits a written request to the commanding officer, secretly bypassing McKinney by passing his request through Lamar, who grants him permission to work on the windmill only during meal breaks. 

Bean challenges fellow inmate Webb, a Harlem born boxer, to a pickup game of basketball after suffering a humiliating loss to him in a fist fight which was initiated after Bean accused Webb of stealing his gold [[zippo]] lighter. Bean agrees to pay Webb $10 if he loses and Webb agrees to help Bean with his windmill project if Bean wins. Bean wins the game and begins building trust and credibility among the other prisoners. Bean begins to connect with the others and learns of some of their crimes. He soon shares a bunk with Bryce (Mankuma), who was convicted of murder despite his pleas to the contrary. Bryce advises that he expects his appeal to fail and to eventually be shipped out of the stockade to be hanged. Lawrence (Toles-Bey), a fellow prisoner who harbors sympathetic views toward the Nation of Islam, reveals that he was convicted of rape and sentenced to seven years though he denies his crime. Among the prisoners is also the largely silent Harry "Sweetbread" Crane (Stewart) who is an inspiring vocalist who sings at church services and leads the prisoners' soulful marching cadence.

In the meantime, McKinney becomes increasingly irritated with Bean's refusal to submit to his authority. It is revealed that he is estranged from his son, whom he states is roughly Bean's age. When McKinney calls his (presumed) ex-wife on his birthday hoping to speak to his son he is told that his son is unavailable, sending McKinney into a drunken bender in the enlisted club. In the middle of the night he tries to break into the prisoner compound to confront Bean while yelling challenges to him. The noise rouses both Lamar and Gessner. Lamar threatens to arrest McKinney and refuses to comply with his order to open the gates. Gessner, however, makes a move to comply but is stopped by Lamar. A fellow sergeant and friend of McKinney arrives on the scene and is warned by Lamar that he will arrest McKinney unless he takes him away immediately and gets him to bed. During a Sunday visit with a friend from his unit, Bean is informed that they are being sent to Vietnam and that he will likely join them there after he is released from the stockade.

McKinney decides to try to use tact with Bean and invites him to his office to talk through their differences while plying him with chocolates, which Bean refuses. Bean states that McKinney is a bully and he hates everything he stands for. McKinney dismisses him and is visibly angry. The next day, while Bean and Webb are nearly finished with the windmill repair, McKinney arrives on the scene with a written order from a Colonel in the Army Corps of Engineers to cease all work on the windmill and placing it off limits for all personnel. When McKinney isn't present Webb and Bean return to the windmill to activate it despite the loud protestations from Gessner. 

In the middle of a rainy night, McKinney arrives at the prisoner barracks in rain gear and a combat helmet while holding a rifle. He orders the prisoners into the yard and summons Gessner. He writes up all of the prisoners, and Gessner, for appearing in formation out of uniform as they are all still in their underwear. He orders the men into the back of a [[deuce-and-a-half]] and orders Gessner to drive them to the farm where they normally work. Upon arrival he dismisses Gessner and orders him back to his quarters. When Gessner questions the order, McKinney strikes him sending him face down into the mud. He departs and McKinney begins to march the prisoners in the deep mud, quickly finding that he is unable to keep up with the younger men in the harsh conditions. He orders the prisoners into formation, throws the ammunition clip from his rifle behind him, and tells the men they should run to escape. He then draws his service pistol and begins firing toward the men while shouting incoherently. "Sweetbread" Crane begins wandering toward the windmill and climbing it. McKinney scrambles for his clip, murmuring "help me" as he tries to load his rifle. All the while the prisoners plead with Sweetbread to return and explain to McKinney that he has a tendency to wander off and isn't trying to escape. Sweetbread climbs down from the windmill and begins moving toward McKinney. Bean leaps toward him to try to protect him from McKinney's rifle fire but Sweetbread is struck in the head. Bean removes his shirt to try to stop the bleeding as the other prisoners subdue McKinney, but the wound is fatal. 

It is revealed that the remainder of Bean's sentence has been commuted by the commanding officer. McKinney is court-martialed for the shooting of Crane and is represented by Captain Garcia. Stokes testifies against McKinney and whispers to Bean, as he leaves the witness stand, that they have McKinney "on the gallows." Garcia elicits from Bean the testimony that McKinney said "help me" as he was loading his weapon. He argues that it couldn't possibly have been a muttering to himself as Bean would not have heard it from his distance and that this was actually a call for the prisoners to assist him with Crane. This, he argues, constitutes a "warning shot" and that the killing was lawful. McKinney is presumably cleared, though it is never explicitly stated. Garcia confronts Bean after the proceedings smiling as he tells Bean that he had no choice but to tell the truth otherwise he would have committed perjury. He then assures Bean that he knows how he feels. Bean replies "No sir, you don't" before saluting and attempting to visit the prisoners. Lamar informs him that they don't want to meet with him though he leaves gifts which Lamar promises to convey.

Bean visits McKinney, who despite his acquittal is committed to the base psychiatric unit. McKinney sits motionless in his room in a state of undress and refuses to speak to Bean. When Bean attempts to initiate conversation, McKinney slowly turns in his chair to face away from him. 

As Bean prepares to leave camp to ship to Vietnam to join his unit, he makes peace with Gessner and receives best wishes from Lamar as they march the prisoners. Webb breaks ranks and tosses the stolen lighter to Bean advising him to stick close to the brothers in Vietnam and they'll keep him safe. The prisoners then call the [[chain gang]] cadence that Sweetbread used to call, turning to face Bean in an apparent reconciliation. Bean tearfully joins in the movements and cadence while observing the formation before saluting the men and departing for Vietnam.

'''''Come Back, Africa''''' (1959) is the second feature-length film written, produced, and directed by American independent filmmaker [[Lionel Rogosin]].

The film had a profound effect on [[African Cinema]], and remains of great historical and cultural importance as a document preserving the heritage of the townships in South Africa in the 1950s. It may be classified as [[reportage]], documentary, [[historical movie]] or [[political cinema]], since it portrays real events and people. On the other hand, it reveals an interpretation of meaningful social facts and a strong ethical assumption towards human behaviours like racism.

Like Rogosin's feature debut ''[[On the Bowery]]'', ''Come Back, Africa'' is a scripted film based on fictional narrative, in which actors play invented roles. However, unlike mainstream films and against Hollywood traditions, its actors are street people, improvising lived experiences: they play their own lives or those of people like them. That is why ''Come Back, Africa'' is a fiction / non-fiction, a [[hybrid genre|hybrid]] of [[fictional film]] and documentary: a [[docufiction]]. Additionally, it is a rare combination in film history of docufiction and [[political film]].

Both Lionel Rogosin in America and [[Jean Rouch]] in France, at the same time, considered themselves as [[Robert Flaherty]]'s heirs for similar reasons. Both used amateur actors, "street people" playing their own roles in search of [[truth]] or to unveil some hidden mystery beyond crude reality: Rogosin, contrary to Flaherty, sustained by strong [[ideological]] beliefs, Rouch, beyond Flaherty, inspired by [[surrealism]], which he believed to be a useful means to reveal the '’truth of cinema'’ (the [[cinéma-vérité]]) and also an important tool to be used by an [[ethnographer]] for scientific research. Following different paths to reach similar results, both converged in [[ethnofiction]] with surprising results (See: Glossary).

==Synopsis==
''Come Back, Africa'' comprises a storyline acted out by black South Africans, from whose own experiences the film's events are drawn.

Desperate to feed his household, Zachariah, a young [[Zulu people|Zulu]], departs his famine-stricken [[kraal]] to work in the [[Johannesburg]] gold mines. He eventually settles in one of the squalid [[apartheid]]-era [[Township (South Africa)|township]]s, only to find himself confronted with a barrage of South Africa's infamous [[pass laws]] restricting his every move. Zachariah learns that he cannot seek employment without a pass; paradoxially, he cannot obtain a pass without employment. Meanwhile, his family is consistently threatened with exile or imprisonment if they fail to comply with these draconian regulations.

Zachariah subsequently drifts through a succession of odd jobs as vadalect, garage attendant, waiter, and public labourer – ridiculed, insulted, and ostracised by unfeeling [[Afrikaner]] superintendents. As they struggle to support their home, even Zachariah's spouse Vinah is forced to take up domestic service; she lives on the property of a white landowner, away from her husband. When the latter visits her one lonely evening, he is arrested by the [[South African Police|SAP]] on [[trespassing]] charges.

Upon his release from detention, Zachariah discovers that Vinah has been murdered by Marumu, an infamous [[Sophiatown]] hoodlum, after resisting several unwanted sexual advances. His overwhelming sense of torment, helplessness, and frustration is intended to capture the resentment of South Africa's indigenous population. Denied basic [[civil rights]], many must weave a treacherous path of survival through the myriad of legal and unofficial racial codes, while their families disintegrate on the townships' violent streets. Some – like Zachariah –  are utterly defenceless in this struggle, impossibly torn between apartheid's calculated suppression and the wanton atrocities of [[organised crime]].

==Reception==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
{{POV | section|date=May 2013}}
* "...a timely and remarkable piece of cinema journalism: a matter-of-fact, horrifying study of life in the black depths of South African society. Filmed in secret..in constant danger of arrest and deportation, Come Back Africa..looks deep into the private nightmare and social desperation of a man and his people.” (''Time'' magazine)
* “Burning with integrity; it is the most damning indictment of apartheid and the pass system that I have ever seen..In a climax of almost unbearable anger and frustration it beats out a question which, though unspoken, must be in the mind of everyone who sees it: How long are we going to allow these appalling conditions to exist?” – Nina Hibbin – Daily Worker (London)
* “If you want to see and understand South Africa, there is no better way than this picture of Johannesburg: the bitterness of the whites, the growing anger of the Negroes and the horror of the shacks and tin shelters of Sophiatown..Extraordinary timeliness.” – Archer Winsten, New York Post
* “Highest Recommendation! Extraordinary film, powerfully dramatic, brilliantly photographed, splendidly played against the background of explosive South Africa.” – Jesse Zunser, Cue Magazine
* “The very spontaneity of the scenes gives his story illumination, shock, and intense poignancy.” – Hollis Alpert, Saturday Review
* “...I have just seen a film that makes me ashamed of being white – ashamed of belonging to a race which can oppress and terrorize people of other colors. It shows how colored men are so hedged about by restrictions and brutal laws that their lives are little better than the lives of animals in a cage. " – Anthony Carthew,  Daily Herald
* “...a film which is not so much a work of art but is of vast importance as a contribution to awareness of the gigantic problem of racial conflict existing in South Africa today..It is a fine film, entertaining in many ways, and quite authentic in its presentation..the musical background..is superb...and interspersed among the story scenes are excellent shots of Johannesburg streets, filled with constantly moving tides of Africans, restless, surging forward, overwhelming in their numbers.” – Christian Science Monitor	
* "Come Back Africa" has been restored by the '''Cineteca di Bologna''' and the laboratory''' L’Imagine Ritrovata''' with the collaboration of '''Rogosin Heritage''' in 2005.

==Awards==
The film was premiered at the 1960 Venice Film Festival. Rogosin financed and backed Bloke Modisane’s escape from South Africa and his transition period in London, where he wrote his book ''Blame me on History''. Rogosin at the same time bribed officials in South Africa and managed to get [[Miriam Makeba]] out of the country against the payment of a bond so that she could present the film with him at the Venice Film Festival. The film along with Makeba's singing and "afro" hair-style created a sensation and the film won the prestigious "Italian Critics Award". It was almost impossible to get black artists out of South Africa at the time, and impossible for these artists to make a career outside of the country. Rogosin engaged Makeba under contract, and financed her travels and living expenses in England and the United States. He also hired a publicity agent, and arranged her appearance at the Village Vanguard in New York City and her debut on ''[[The Steve Allen Show]]''.
	
* [[Italian Critics Award]], [[Venice Film Festival]], 1959
* Winner of the award for "the film showing the most significant advance in content means of expression and technique." – The Canadian Federation of Film Societies, Vancouver Film Festival, 1959
* Selected by ''Time'' magazine as one of the "Ten Best Pictures of 1960”
* Selected by Chevalier de la Barre, Paris, as "Most Worthy Picture of 1960”

==Filming==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
After the [[World War II|Second World War]], Rogosin wanted to make a film that would expose the [[apartheid]] system to the world. He made his first film ''[[On the Bowery]]'' (1956) as a way to prepare for making ''Come Back, Africa''.

Rogosin and his wife Elinor arrived in South Africa in May 1957, and spent six months preparing and getting to know the people and country. He secretly met Myrtle and Marty Berman (organizers in the anti-apartheid movement) who introduced him to the groups fighting against apartheid and to [[Bloke Modisane]], a writer and journalist working for ''[[Drum (South African magazine)|Drum]]'' magazine. Modisane then introduced Rogosin to [[Lewis Nkosi]], another young ''Drum'' journalist, and other journalists, musicians and writers.

Rogosin, Modisane and Nkosis worked out a simple script with which Rogosin improvised and worked with non-professional actors. The filming was done under the danger of being discovered by the apartheid regime. Rogosin carefully made up different stories for different people so that he was able to film and get the materials out of the country safely. The tiny film crew shot on location in the streets of Johannesburg, Sophiatown and in restricted areas prohibited to whites, where 50,000 African homes were being annihilated to make room for a white suburb called Triumph. Filming finished in October 1959, and Rogosin left South Africa. The editing was done in New York by Carl Lerner, who was receiving the rushes from South Africa.

===Context===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}
Rogosin's crew worked in secret, disguised as a commercial film unit making a musical, and in constant fear of confiscation and deportation. It was one of the first non-musical films, if not the first to document the lives of black people in Africa using native languages.
	
The South African government attacked ''Come Back, Africa'' and banned it from being shown in South Africa.

Beside the Critics' award at the Venice Film Festival, the film won many awards and was a critical success in Europe. It had its biggest impact in France where Madame Yvonne Decaris who ran the legendary [[:fr:La Pagode|Pagode cinema]], in Paris, opened the film. It was reviewed by many great French intellectuals such as [[Roland Barthes]]. It then went on to be taken up and screened through the French [[Cinéclubs]] system; it is estimated that over a million people saw the film in France.

Rogosin opened the [[Bleecker Street Cinema]] in New York in the spring of 1960&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lionelrogosin.org/bleeker_street_LR.html|title=The Official Lionel Rogosin Website :: Biography|website=www.lionelrogosin.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and premiered ''Come Back, Africa'' one week before the [[Sharpeville massacre]].

===Languages===
[[Fanakalo]] is used for the mine scenes (it is the mining lingua franca), [[Afrikaans]] is used by the policeman who arrests Zacharia for a pass offence, [[Zulu language|Zulu]] is Zacharia's home language and English is used by the intellectuals in the [[shebeen]] scene.

===Music===
Rogosin wanted to expose the ordeal of the people but also wanted to capture the culture of the streets. He was passionate about the music and dancing he observed in the townships, so he also had a "story" for the authorities that he was making a street musical / travelogue, which he used to obtain permission to film outdoors. There are scenes with gumboot dancers, [[Kwela|penny-whistle musicians]], a group singing [[Elvis Presley]]'s hit Teddy Bear, and a young Miriam Makeba singing in the shebeen scene.

===Related content===
Lionel Rogosin's diaries of this period are collected in the book ''A Man Possessed'', edited by Peter Davis.

==="Making of" documentary===
In 2007, Rogosin's sons Michael and Daniel co-produced a 55-minute "Making of" documentary entitled ''An American in Sophiatown''. The film was directed by Lloyd Ross.

==Home media==
[[Milestone Films]] released a restored ''Come Back, Africa'' on DVD and Blu-ray in 2012.

A '''diploma''' is a certificate or deed issued by an educational institution, such as college or university, that testifies that the recipient has successfully completed a particular course of study. The word diploma also refers to an academic award which is given after the completion of study in different courses such as diploma in higher education, diploma in graduation or diploma in post graduation etc. Historically, it can also refer to a charter or official document,&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/diploma|title=Diploma|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus [[diplomatic]],&lt;ref name=diplomatic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/diplomatic|title=Diplomatic|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[diplomat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/diplomat|title=Diplomat|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[diplomacy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/diplomacy|title=Diplomacy|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; via the ''Codex Juris Gentium Diplomaticus''.&lt;ref name=diplomatic/&gt;

The diploma (as a document certifying a qualification) may also be called a '''testamur''', [[Latin]] for "we testify" or "certify" (testari), so called from the word with which the certificate begins;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/testamur|title=Testamur|work=Collins Dictionary|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; this is commonly used in Australia to refer to the document certifying the award of a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monash.edu/graduations/get-ready/documents/award-degree-certificate|title=Testamur (degree certificates)|publisher=[[Monash University]]|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ask.unimelb.edu.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/5964/~/my-graduation-certificate/|title=My Graduation Certificate|publisher=[[University of Melbourne]]|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uow.edu.au/student/graduation/testamurs/index.html|title=Testamur (certificate)|publisher=[[University of Wollongong]]|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, this document can simply be referred to as a degree certificate or graduation certificate, or as a '''parchment'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/parchment|title=Parchment|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The certificate that a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate receives is also called a diploma.

The term diploma is also used in some historical contexts, to refer to documents signed by a King affirming a grant or tenure of specified land and its conditions (see [[Anglo-Saxon Charters]] and [[Diplomatics]]).

It is typically completed with 12 to 18 months of full-time study. When accepted for credit as part of a bachelor's degree, it is usually deemed to be equivalent to the first year of the degree.
* an "Advanced Diploma", which is equivalent to an Australian "[[Associate Degree]]".
* a "Graduate Diploma", which is undertaken after completing a bachelor's degree (or being deemed to have equivalent knowledge). This can be in a field other than that covered by said degree (e.g., the [[Graduate Diploma of Education]] necessary to become a school teacher in most Australian states). It can also be a coursework-only qualification undertaken as additional study in a specialisation within one's degree area.

The "Vocational Graduate Diploma" was a short lived AQF qualification equivalent to the "Graduate Diploma", intended to be delivered exclusively in the VET sector. On January 1, 2015, all such qualifications being offered lost the word "Vocational" from their title.

Diplomas' Certifications in Singapore are well recognised by various other countries, due to Singapore High Educational Standards.  Even Singapore Technical schools (ITEs) offers Diploma courses: www.ite.edu.sg/wps/portal/fts.admission.dip

===Spain===
In the [[Kingdom of Spain]], university diplomas are issued in the name of the [[King]]. As such, they are Public Official documents, strictly regulated and protected by the law. They are internationally recognized by the [[Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents|Hague Convention]] of October 5, 1961.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[UK]], ''diploma'' can refer to several different types of qualification. A Diploma can be a qualification worth 37 or more [[Credit Accumulation and Transfer Scheme|credits]] on the [[Regulated Qualifications Framework]], e.g. Entry Level Diploma, Level 3 Diploma. The [[Diploma of Higher Education]] is a higher education award below the standard of a bachelor's degree, at the same level as a [[Foundation Degree]]. The [[Higher National Diploma]] is a vocational qualification at the same level. A [[Graduate Diploma]] is a one-year qualification at bachelor's degree level, normally taken by those who have already obtained a degree. A [[Postgraduate Diploma]] is an award at the level of a master's degree, but normally taking less time to complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/what-different-qualification-levels-mean/list-of-qualification-levels|title=What qualification levels mean|website=Gov.uk|date=25 October 2016|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some universities may offer other qualifications, such as the [[University of Cambridge]]'s Undergraduate Diploma (a 1-year, part-time cost at the same level as a Diploma of Higher Education)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ice.cam.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate-certificates-and-diplomas|title=Undergraduate Certificates and Diplomas|publisher=University of Cambridge|website=Institute of Continuing Education|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Advanced Diploma (equivalent to a Graduate Diploma).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/graduate/diploma/|title=Advanced Diploma in Economics|publisher=University of Cambridge|website=Faculty of Economics|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document certifying the award of a degree is normally called a degree certificate in the UK, and details are printed in English, not in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|quote=It has not been practice for UK providers to issue degree certificates in Latin for at least 10 years. Contemporary certificates are in English. Latin versions are occasionally issued as mementos, but are supplementary to the English version.|website=Higher Education Degree Datacheck|url=http://cdn.prospects.ac.uk/pdf/Advice%20and%20Guidance%20on%20Degree%20Fraud%20for%20HE%20Providers.pdf|title=Advice and Guidance on Degree Fraud|publisher=Prospects|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the USA, the word ''diploma'' usually refers to the actual document received at the end of high school, undergraduate studies, or graduate/professional school. This can lead to some confusion when persons who obtained US degrees are presenting their academic credentials in other countries.

Diploma also can refer to a specific academic or training award. An example of the former is in the field of Nursing where the [[Diploma in Nursing]] was offered by hospital based schools.

In an even wider fashion, a [[diplomat]] can refer to a person holding a specific accreditation.
It can also mean what colleges will be willing to take you in freshman year of college.

===International===
The [[IB Diploma Programme|International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma]] is a pre-university qualification normally taken by students in the final two years of [[high school]].&lt;ref name="IBDiploma"&gt;[http://www.ibo.org/diploma/ "International Baccalaureate] Diploma Programme".

'''Edwards Villa''' is a building located in [[Bornova]], [[İzmir]]. It currently serves as a [[Ege University|university]] cafeteria and social communication centre.

==History==
Edwards Villa was built by the Edwards Family in 1880, at which time it became the family's own residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ege.edu.tr/index.php?lid=1&amp;SayfaID=299&amp;cat=details |title=Ege Universitesi |publisher=Ege.edu.tr |date= |accessdate=2016-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Charles Edwards passed away, the villa was given the name "Murat Villa". 

In 1980, it was expropriated by the local government and the İzmir Province Vulnerable Child Protection Union. In 1983, it was transferred to the Social Services Society for the Protection of Children General Directorate. 

In 2001, The Society for the Protection of Children and Izmir Metropolitan Municipality started a project to comprehensively restore the villa. The project lasted fifteen years. After restoration in 2005, it was given to the [[Ege University]] and currently serves as a cafeteria and a community center.

==Location==
The villa is located on the opposite side of an [[Anglican Church]], at the corner of [[Central Boulevard]] and Flower Street.

==Architecture==
The [[façade]] is symmetrical about the central plane. This symmetry is accentuated by double entry doors. 

The porch is surrounded by [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] and approached by double-arm stairs. The stairs on the porch open the southern façade of the main hall and are reminiscent of the Italian architecture used in the entire structure, especially in the front parts.

The porch is a specimen of late Italian civil architecture. 

==Interior==

The interior of the building has several ornaments made out of plaster and wood. 

The ceilings have various eye-catching motifs of animals such as lions and dragons. The ground floor hall is adorned with black-and-white marble plaques, intricate niches and large wooden doors. The fireplace is made out of cast iron. The first floor rooms are decorated simply in stark contrast with the hall's ornate ceiling centers. 

A low-arched transition element is made of plasters and wood. 

The restoration process involved stripping the plaster and the cladding from the basement and covering the chimney with bricks, as well as replacing the lighting fixtures, which left the architecture inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Hümeyra BİROL AKKURT, 19.YUZYIL BATILAŞMA KESITINDE, BORNOVA VE BUCA LEVANTEN KOSKLERI MEKANSAL KİMLIGININ IRDELENMESİ, Dokuz Eylul University, Instıtute of Science, PhD Thesis, Department of Architecture, Restoration Program, 2004-March, Izmir, pg.144-149&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ernests Brastiņš''' (19 March 1892–28 Januari 1942) was a Latvian artist, amateur historian, folklorist and archaeologist. He is known as the founder and driving force behind the [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]] religion [[Dievturība]], which he started in the 1920s and which was re-established after the fall of the Soviet Union.

== Biography ==
Ernests Brastiņš was educated at the [[Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy|Stieglitz Art Academy]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1911-1915. After military service in [[World War I]] and the [[Latvian War of Independence]] he became the director of the [[Latvian War Museum]]. During his time at the museum he studied Latvian history, Latvian ethnography, folk art and symbols, and investigated around 300 Latvian hill forts and the folklore connected to them.&lt;ref name="ozolins"&gt;Gatis Ozoliņš. 2014. "The Dievturi movement in Latvia as invention of tradition". ''Modern Pagan and Native Faith Movements in Central and Eastern Europe''. {{ISBN|9781317544616}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926 he officially founded the first [[Dievturība]] organization together with his sculptor brother. Dievturība is a [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]] religion based on the old Baltic religion, Latvian folk culture, and especially the folk songs known as ''[[Daina (Latvia)|dainas]]''. The word Dievturība roughly means "the people who hold or live according to God's laws". With its fokus on folklore and national character, the Dievturība movement carried on a cultural inheritance from the 19th-century [[Young Latvians]] movement.&lt;ref name="ozolins" /&gt;

Brastiņš' published works include three books on Latvian folk songs (1928-1929) and ''Dievturu cerokslis'' ("The Intentions of Dievturi") (1932) which outlines the principles of Dievturība, modeled on ''[[Luther's Small Catechism]]''.&lt;ref name="ozolins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="opentheology"&gt;Anita Stasulane, Gatis Ozoliņš. [https://www.degruyter.com/downloadpdf/j/opth.2017.3.issue-1/opth-2017-0019/opth-2017-0019.pdf Transformations of Neopaganism in Latvia: From Survival to Revival]. ''[[Open Theology]]'' 2017; 3: 235–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Having attracted prominent artists and intellectuals to the movement, Brastiņš unsuccessfully tried to have Dievturība adopted as the official state religion of Latvia.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Pourchier-Plasseraud. 2015. ''Arts and a Nation: The Role of Visual Arts and Artists in the Making of the Latvian Identity'', 1905-1940. p. 76. {{ISBN| 9789004300286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1934 Latvian coup d'état]] the movement was forced to re-register as a secular organization. Brastiņš' research as well as his religious engagements were terminated with the [[Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940]].&lt;ref name="ozolins" /&gt; He was arrested by the Soviet security services on 6 July 1940. On 24 May 1941, he was sentenced to eight years in a correctional labour camp in Russia for having founded and led the Dievturība organization. He was put on another trial in Russia on 27 January 1942 and was sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="opentheology" /&gt; The execution was carried out the following day.&lt;ref name="ozolins" /&gt;

== Legacy ==

[[File:Memorial stone of Ernests Brastiņš, founder of Dievturity, in Riga, Latvia v2.png|thumb|Ernests Brastiņš' monument in Riga, Kronvald Park, beside the congress hall at the city's canal.]]

During the Soviet era the Dievturība religion primarily lived on abroad in Latvian emigré communities. These varied in their view of it as a religion or just as a way to preserve Latvian traditions. The movement was officially re-registered in Latvia on 18 April 1990. Its contemporary adherents recognize Brastiņš as its founder and leading ideologue.&lt;ref name="ozolins" /&gt;

== Architectural career ==
[[File:207 Bluff Road, Sandringham.jpeg|thumb|207 Bluff Road, Sandringham, Victoria, Australia. Mewton's residence for two decades.]]
Mewton began his architectural career in 1923, working at the [[Blackett, Foster &amp; Craig]] office while studying at night at the Working Men's College (later to be known as the [[Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology]], RMIT).&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Throughout 1926 to 1928 Mewton attended night classes at the [[Melbourne University Architectural Atelier]] (MUAA).&lt;ref name=langmore /&gt; After graduating from MUAA on 27 August 1928 Mewton travelled to London with [[Roy Grounds]] and [[Oscar Bayne]], colleagues at the University Atelier.&lt;ref name=langmore /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Here Grounds, Mewton and Bayne lived together in rented accommodation in London.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

During his time in London, Mewton worked for [[Adems Holden &amp; Pearson]], the firm is known for the design of the modernist brick and concrete suburban [[London Underground]] railway stations.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

In 1929 after travelling to New York Mewton started working in the [[Van Alen]] office. At the time the firm was in the completion stage of the Chrysler buildings.&lt;ref name=ancestry&gt;[http://search.ancestrylibrary.com/cgi-bin/sse.dll?new=I&amp;gsfn=Geoffrey+Harley&amp;gsln=Mewton&amp;gl=ROOT-CATEGORY&amp;rank=I&amp;gss+sfs62_&amp;msbdy=1905], www.ancestrylibrary.com, viewed 24 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

At the age of 25 on 20 October 1930 Mewton returned to London to sit his [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA) examinations and took the opportunity to travel throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=ancestry /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

On returning home to Melbourne, Australia on 13 September 1932, Mewton set up his own office.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; A year later Roy Grounds returned to Melbourne and the pair formed the office [[Mewton &amp; Grounds]].&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Together they were subsequently responsible for the design of several buildings that introduced modernism to Melbourne.&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt; Their partnership was informal and each worked individually, collecting their own profits.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; Quickly the pair became acknowledged as the protagonists of modernism in Melbourne.

Within this body of work Mewton demonstrates a skill in rectilinear arrangement which also exhibits an interest in the work of Dutch Modernist Architect [[William Dudok]] and Russian architect [[Lakov Chernikov]].&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; The Watt House Toorak, VIC (1934), Fairbairn House, Toorak VIC (1935–1936) and Mewton's own home 207 Bluff Road (1938) epitomise his interest in living room garden windows. To create a house that opened to the garden Mewton used windows that could be folded back completely.&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; [[Robin Boyd (architect)|Robin Boyd]] described Mewton's work as "the perfect example of the Victorian type, house and garden are really planned as one."&lt;ref name=bayside /&gt;

In 1939 the partnership between Mewton and Grounds was dissolved. From here Mewton began partnership with [[Edward Billson]]. The pair practised together from 1939 to 1942.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

Mewton worked for the [[Department of Labour and National Service]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=madge&gt;Madge, J and Peckham, A (2006).

Mewton worked briefly in 1945 for the firm A.C. Leith &amp; Barttett. He assisted in the design of the Housing Commission of Victoria.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt; He was nominated that same year as judge for the Sun Post War Homes competition (1945). He was an advocate and committee member of 'Small Homes Service' [[Royal Victorian Institute of Architects]] (RVIA).&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;

Later in 1945 Mewton joined the firm [[Godfrey &amp; Spowers]]. Also joining the partnership were Eric Hughes and John Lobb. Together they formed '[[Godfrey&amp;Spowers, Hughes, Mewton and Lobb]]'.&lt;ref name=encyclopaedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=peterson&gt;Peterson, R (2005).

[[File:Popovici-Selfportrait.jpg|thumb|200px|Self-portrait (1882).]]
'''Gheorghe Popovici''' (5 October 1859, [[Iași]] - 24 February 1933, Iași) was a Romanian painter and designer in the [[Academic art|Academic]] style.

==Biography==
He spent his childhood in [[Hotin]]. Later, he attended the secondary schools in Iași, graduating from the "Școala de Arte Frumoase" (School of Fine Arts) in 1883.&lt;ref name="E2"&gt;[http://www.ziarulevenimentul.ro/stiri-2/Casa%20si%20gradina/pictorul-gheorghe-popovici--195208.html "Pictorul Gheorghe Popovici"] @ Evenimentul.&lt;/ref&gt; His talents earned him a state scholarship to study in Rome, then Paris, where he worked with [[Léon Bonnat]], absorbing cultural influences as well as artistic techniques. In 1900, he won critical acclaim at the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] for his depiction of [[Vasile Ursu Nicola|Horea's execution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cronicaromana.com/2011/05/23/gheorghe-popovici-un-maestru-expus-foarte-rar/ "Gheorghe Popovici, un maestru expus foarte rar"] @ Cronica Românǎ.&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning home, he was appointed Professor of painting and composition at his old alma mater, the School of Fine Arts. From 1911 to 1929, he served as Director.&lt;ref name="E1" /&gt; During his thirty years as a teacher, his students included [[Nicolae Tonitza]], [[Ștefan Dimitrescu]], [[Camil Ressu]] and [[Aurel Băeșu]].&lt;ref name="E1"&gt;[http://www.ziarulevenimentul.ro/stiri/moldova/gheorghe-popovici-pictor--111637.html "Gheorghe Popovici - Pictor"] @ Evenimentul.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a time, he was also Director of the school's library, which later became an art museum. 
During World War I, when the second shipment of the [[Romanian Treasure]] was being put together for transport to Moscow, he used the library to hide well-known art works from the local area, and they became the basis for the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziarulevenimentul.ro/stiri-2/Rubrici/in-memoriam-pictorul-gheorghe-popovici--55862.html "In Memoriam Pictorul Gheorghe Popovici"] @ Evenimentul.&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, he preferred large oil paintings and created murals for the "Metropolitan Palace", depicting the [[Second Council of Nicaea|Nicene Council]] and the [[Synod of Jassy]].&lt;ref name="E2" /&gt;

[[File:HAVE - House in Pompeii.jpg|thumb|The "HAVE" Mosaic (spelling variant of [[Ave]])]]
[[File:StatueFaunePompéi.JPG|thumb|Copy of the Dancing Faun]]
The '''House of the Faun''' ({{lang-it|Casa del Fauno}}), built during the 2nd century BC, was one of the largest and most impressive [[Domus|private residences]] in [[Pompeii]], Italy, and housed many great pieces of art. It is one of the most luxurious aristocratic houses from the [[Roman republic]], and reflects this period better than most archaeological evidence found even in [[Rome]] itself.&lt;ref name="Grant1988"&gt;{{cite book |title=Civilization of the ancient Mediterranean: Greece and Rome |last=Grant |first=Michael |authorlink= |author2=Kitzinger, Rachel |year=1988 |publisher=Scribner's |location=New York |isbn=0-684-17594-0 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The House of the Faun was built in the 2nd century BC during the [[Samnium|Samnite]] period (80 BC).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Cambridge Ancient History]].'' [New] ed. London: Cambridge University Press, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is evidence, most notably in the eastern walls of the [[tetrastyle]] [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], that after the [[62 Pompeii earthquake|great earthquake in AD 62]], the House of the Faun was rebuilt and/or repaired;&lt;ref name="Dwyer2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dwyer |first=Eugene J. |authorlink= |year=2001 |title=The Unified Plan of the House of the Faun |journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=328–343 |doi=10.2307/991759 |jstor= 991759}}&lt;/ref&gt;  yet, the building was only used again until AD 79, ultimately rendered unusable by the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption]] of [[Mount Vesuvius]]. Although the eruption was devastating, the layers of [[Volcanic ash|ash]] covering the city preserved artworks, like the [[mosaic]]s of the House of the Faun, which would have otherwise been likely destroyed or decayed due to the passage of time.

The House of the Faun was named for the bronze statue of the dancing [[faun]] located, originally, on the lip of the [[impluvium]], a basin for catching rainwater; it has been moved to the center of the impluvium, as seen in the adjacent picture. [[Faun]]s are spirits of untamed woodland, which literate and [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Romans often connected to [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] and Greek [[satyr]]s, or wild followers of the Greek god of wine and drama, [[Dionysus]]. It is purely decorative sculpture of a high order: "the pose is light and graceful," [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] observed,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Nude: A Study in Ideal Form'' 1956:263 (illustrated fig. 145).&lt;/ref&gt; the modeling well understood, the general sense of movement admirably sustained," though he missed in its suavity the stimulus of sharper contrasts to be found in Renaissance nudes.

Archaeologists discovered an inscription bearing the [[cognomen]] Saturninus, suggesting that the dwelling was owned by the important [[gens]], or clan, Satria; a ring bearing the family name [[Cassius (gens)|Cassius]] was also found, indicating that someone of the Cassii family married into the ''gens'' Satria and lived in the House of the Faun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Mary L. |authorlink= |year=1927 |title=The Ordo of Pompeii |journal=Journal of Roman Studies |volume=17 |issue= |pages=165–183 |doi=10.2307/296132 |jstor= 296132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of the Faun was initially excavated in 1830 by the German archeological institute.

==Artworks==
[[File:Alexandermosaic.jpg|thumb|left|The Alexander Mosaic]]
The House of the Faun contained the [[Alexander Mosaic]], depicting the [[Battle of Issus (333 BC)|Battle of Issus]] in 333 BC between [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Darius III of Persia]]. This mosaic may be inspired by or copied from a Greek painting finished in the late fourth century BC,&lt;ref name="Grant1988" /&gt; probably by the artist [[Philoxenus of Eretria]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' xxxv. 10.36§ 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most Pompeian pavements of the late second and early first centuries, this mosaic is made of [[Tessellation|tesserae]], and not the more common [[opus signinum]], or other kinds of stone chips set in mortar.&lt;ref name="Westgate2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Westgate |first=Ruth |authorlink= |year=2000 |title=''{{lang|la|Pavimenta Atque Emblemata Vermiculata}}'': Regional Styles in Hellenistic Mosaic and the First Mosaics At Pompeii |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |volume=104 |issue=2 |pages=255–275 |doi=10.2307/507451 |jstor= 507451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alexander Mosaic is complemented by other floor mosaics with [[Nilotic]] scenes and theatrical masks.&lt;ref name="Grant1988" /&gt;  Other notable works of art from the House of Faun include an erotic ''Satyr and Nymph'' and the fish mosaic, a piece closely resembling other mosaics in Pompeii.&lt;ref name="Westgate2000" /&gt;

==Architecture==
[[File:House of the Faun.svg|alt=Building Plan of the House of the Faun|frame|256x256px|Building Plan]]
The House of the Faun covers nearly 3000 square meters and occupies an entire city block, or ''[[Insulae|insula]]''. The house can be divided into five major parts: the Tuscan atrium, peristyle atrium, service rooms and corridors, first, or [[Ionic order|Ionic]], [[peristyle]], and second, or [[Doric order|Doric]], peristyle, and their corresponding dependent rooms.&lt;ref name="Dwyer2001" /&gt;  Like many ancient Roman houses, the House of the Faun had ''[[taberna]]e'', or storefront shops, and a highly sophisticated building plan, which details the many rooms. The entrance is decorated by the [[Latin]] message “[[ave|HAVE]]”, a greeting both for meeting and parting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/|title=Perseus Digital Library|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other wealthy aristocrats of the Roman Republic, the owners of the House of the Faun installed a [[Ancient Roman bathing|private bath system]], or ''[[balneum]]'', in the house. The bathing room was located in the domestic wing, which was to the right of the entrance, and along with the kitchen was heated by a large furnace.&lt;ref name="Grant1988" /&gt; The servants’ quarters were dark and cramped, and there was not much furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Princeton Encyclopedia of Classical Sites |last=Stillwell |first=Richard |authorlink= |author2=MacDonald, William Lloyd |author3=McAllister, Marian Holland  |year=1976 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |isbn= |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The house features beautiful peristyle gardens, the second of which was created as a stage to host [[recitation]]s, [[Mime artist|mimes]], and [[pantomime]]s. Additionally, the house contained an entrance passage, a number of bedrooms (''cubicula''), dining rooms (''[[Triclinium|triclinia]]'') for both the summer and winter, a reception room (''[[oecus]]''), and an office (''[[tablinum]]'').&lt;ref name="Grant1988" /&gt;

==Remains==
[[File:HoFTourists.jpg|thumb|Tourists in the garden]]
Today visitors can still explore the remains of the House of the Faun in modern Pompeii, along Via di Nola. Although most of the original artworks have been relocated to the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|National Archaeological Museum]] (''Museo Archeologico Nazionale'') in [[Naples]], the most famous pieces, like the Dancing Faun and the Alexander Mosaic, have been recreated to give tourists a clearer picture of what the house was originally like.&lt;ref name="Merola2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Merola |first=Marco |authorlink= |year=2006 |title=Alexander, Piece by Piece |journal=Archaeology |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=  |url=http://www.archaeology.org/0601/abstracts/mosaic.html |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pietro Giovanni Guzzo, one of Pompeii’s past archaeological superintendents, explained, “I want visitors to have the impression that they are entering the same luxurious house in which the ancient Pompeian owners lived before it was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79.”&lt;ref name="Merola2006" /&gt;

In traditional [[Persian architecture]], a '''howz''' ({{lang-fa|حوض}}) is a centrally positioned symmetrical axis [[Reflecting pool|pool]].

'''IDEA Office''' is an [[United States|American]] [[architectural practice]] based in downtown [[Los Angeles]]. It was founded in 1988. The office is formed by the [[partnership]] of Eric A. Kahn and Russell N. Thomsen.

==History==
Eric A. Kahn and Russell N. Thomsen established their architectural firm in Los Angeles, California in 1988 with a series of theoretical projects and texts about urban and architectural speculations.  They worked in parallel on a series of realized architectural projects including the Brix Restaurant in [[Marina Del Rey]],&lt;ref&gt;Betsky, Aaron. Experimental Architecture in Los Angeles. New York, Rizzoli, 1991.4. {{ISBN|9780847813384}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a series of private residences in Los Angeles and [[New York City]], and the award winning Y-House in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]][http://www.archdaily.com/89093/y-house-idea-office/]. In 2008, the office began working on a wider spectrum of projects, including gallery installations in [[San Francisco]] and Los Angeles. For the past four years they have been working on a project entitled, “Thinking the Future of Auschwitz,” a far reaching proposal which considers a possible future for the fragile site of [[Auschwitz-Birkenau]].

=== Biography of founders ===
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
Kahn and Thomsen both received their [[Bachelor of Architecture]] degree from [[California Polytechnic State University]], [[San Luis Obispo]], [[California]] in 1981 and are registered architects in the State of California. They completed additional studies in [[Florence]], [[Italy]] under Cristiano Toraldo di Francia, one of the founders of the architecture office, [[Superstudio]].

Upon completion of their formal education, Kahn and Thomsen worked for the Italian Radical Architecture office, Superstudio in Florence, Italy. Upon return to the United States, Kahn completed his [[apprenticeship]] with [[Thom Mayne]] and Michael Rotondi at [[Morphosis]], Architects, and Thomsen with [[Richard Meier]] and Partners, Architects; both offices are located in Los Angeles. Shortly after establishing their own office in 1988, Kahn and Thomsen were invited to join the faculty at the [[Southern California Institute of Architecture]] (SCI-Arc). They are currently senior design studio faculty at the school, teaching studios and seminars in both the graduate and undergraduate programs [http://sciarc.edu/faculty.php?id=15]. Located in downtown Los Angeles, SCI-Arc is ranked as one of the top five schools of architecture and design in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/features/Americas_Best_Architecture_Schools/2012/schools-4.asp |title=America’s Best Architecture Schools 2012 &amp;#124; Features &amp;#124; Architectural Record |publisher=Archrecord.construction.com |date=2011-10-05 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to teaching at SCI-Arc, they have been visiting professors and held endowed chairs at the [[University of California Berkeley]], the [[University of Michigan]][http://taubmancollege.umich.edu/architecture/faculty/visiting_faculty/eric_kahn/], [[Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning]], [[Kyoto Seika University]], Kyoto,Japan, [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]], [[Arizona State University]], the [[University of Arkansas]] and SCI-Arc in [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]].

'''Idyllwild Arts Foundation''' encompasses two institutions in [[Idyllwild, California]] for training in the arts: '''[[Idyllwild Arts Academy]]''' ('''IAA''') and the '''Idyllwild Arts Summer Program'''.  The institution was formerly known as '''Idyllwild School of Music and the Arts''' ('''ISOMATA''').

Idyllwild Arts is in the San Jacinto Mountains above [[Palm Springs, California]] in the [[San Bernardino National Forest]], at an elevation of {{convert|5300|ft|m}}, 2 hours from Los Angeles, 2 hours from San Diego and 1 hour from Palm Springs.

==History==
Idyllwild Arts was founded by Dr. Max Krone and his wife, Beatrice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Myrna|title=Beatrice Perham Krone; Co-Founder of Idyllwild Arts School|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/aug/24/local/me-9641|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=24 August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Envisioning a remote place where people of all backgrounds could come together to experience the arts, they established the Idyllwild Arts Foundation in 1946 and purchased acreage in the San Jacinto Mountains on which to build.  In 1950, approximately one hundred adult students began attending summer classes in the arts.

Over the years, summer activities have continued to grow, expanding to include programs for children of all ages, a Family Camp, Metals Week, Native American Arts Festival and the Chamber Music Festival.  Classes in music, dance, theatre, visual arts, film, writing and Native American arts are offered to students from age 5 to adult.  Each year over 1800 adults and children attend Idyllwild Arts Summer Program courses. Norman Corwin, Ansel Adams, Herbert Zipper, Marguerite N. Clapp, Mark Wilke, Bella Lewitzky, Fritz Scholder, Maria Martinez, Lucy Lewis, Meredith Willson and other luminaries taught courses there in the summer.

In 1964, the school was given to the [[University of Southern California]] under the terms of an agreement with the Idyllwild Arts Foundation.  In 1983, the Foundation exercised its option to resume independent management and resumed sole ownership of the school.  In 1985, the first independent boarding high school for the arts in the western United States, the Idyllwild Arts Academy, was established.

==Idyllwild Arts Academy==
{{Main|Idyllwild Arts Academy}}
Idyllwild Arts Academy, the boarding school, offers a college preparatory program for grades 9–12 and post-graduates, with training in music, theater, dance, visual art, creative writing, film and interdisciplinary arts. An audition or portfolio is required for admission.

==Idyllwild Arts Summer Program==
The Idyllwild Arts Summer Program which began in the summer of 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=PRWEB|title=Idyllwild Arts Summer Program Students to Present a Community Concert|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/8/prweb10989977.htm|publisher=prweb.com|accessdate=5 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  includes more than 95 workshops. These are taught by professional artist-teachers, in dance, music, theatre, visual arts, creative writing, poetry, filmmaking, and Native Arts.

The program for young people features a Children's Center whose participants range in age from 5 to 12 and who select classes and workshops in a variety of arts including multi-arts, dance, piano, theatre, visual arts, poetry and journal writing.

Junior Artist's Center (ages 11–13) and Youth Arts Center (ages 13–18) offer courses to accommodate a broad range of skill levels and a wide variety of art experiences. Music opportunities include musical theatre, piano classes, jazz workshop, two bands, two orchestras and chamber music. Visual artists can select courses from introductory art exploration to ceramics, advanced painting and drawing, jewelry, photography, computer animation, mixed media, and video production. Writers can take poetry, fiction and playwriting workshops. Dancers participate in ballet, jazz and modern. Actors may take up to six weeks of Theatre Festival workshops, each of which includes a major performance.

Each year, Idyllwild Arts provides financial aid for young people with limited financial resources: twenty-five percent of young people who participate in an arts workshop are awarded financial aid totaling approximately $500,000.

Part of the program involves theme-related workshops, seminars and performances featuring artists, poets and musicians. Programs include: Native American Arts, Metals Week &amp; the Chamber Music Festival.

The culmination of the Summer Program is celebrated with a concert by the Festival Choir, Festival Wind Ensemble and the Festival Orchestra.  In previous years this concert ended with a performance of [[Meredith Willson]]'s "In Idyllwild" by the combined ensembles.

The '''LafargeHolcim Awards''' is an international competition that seeks projects and visionary concepts in [[sustainable]] construction – irrespective of scale. A total of USD 2&amp;nbsp;million in prize money is awarded in each three-year cycle.&lt;ref name="Holcim Awards Schedule"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holcimfoundation.org/AwardApplication/holcim-awards/prizesandschedule |title=Holcim Awards Schedule|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Eligible for entry are projects in: buildings and civil engineering works; landscape, urban design and infrastructure; and materials, products and construction technologies. The LafargeHolcim Awards is conducted by the [[LafargeHolcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction]] based in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="HolcimFoundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holcimfoundation.org |title=Holcim Foundation |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entries can only be made online.&lt;ref name="OpenForEntries"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archdaily.com/398738/ |title=The 4th Edition of the Holcim Awards Now Open for Entries |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition was known as the Holcim Awards from 2003. Holcim Ltd and Lafarge S.A. completed their global merger and launched [[LafargeHolcim]], a world leader in the building materials industry, in July 2015. The name of the foundation was changed to LafargeHolcim Foundation, and the competition became the LafargeHolcim Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The initiatives of the LafargeHolcim Foundation|url=http://lafargeholcim-foundation.org/AboutPages/initiatives|website=LafargeHolcim Foundation for Sustainable Construction|publisher=LafargeHolcim Foundation|accessdate=21 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional and global phase==

The LafargeHolcim Awards competition opens with five regional LafargeHolcim Awards competitions and is followed by the Global LafargeHolcim Awards. The regional LafargeHolcim Awards are based on five geographic areas: [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Latin America]], [[Africa Middle East]], and [[Asia Pacific]]. Entries in the competition are allocated to a region based on the location of the project.

==LafargeHolcim Awards (main) and “Next Generation” (student) categories==

There are two categories within the competition:&lt;ref name="Award Categories"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holcimfoundation.org/AwardApplication/holcim-awards/overview |title=Holcim Awards Categories|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Holcim Awards Categories 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bustler.net/index.php/article/winners_of_regional_holcim_awards_competition_announced_in_new_delhi/ |title=Awards Categories featured in Bustler.net |accessdate=20 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main category of the competition is open to architects, planners, engineers, and project owners that showcase sustainable responses to technological, environmental, socioeconomic and cultural issues affective contemporary building and construction. The fifteen projects that receive LafargeHolcim Awards Gold, Silver or Bronze in the five regions are then qualified for the competition for the Global LafargeHolcim Awards.&lt;ref name="LafargeHolcim Awards Global Winners"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archdaily.com/222057/global-holcim-award-2012-winners-announced/ |title=Global Holcim Awards winners 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The “Next Generation” category is open to bold ideas and visions of students in between the age of 18 and 30.

==Evaluation criteria==

Submissions in both categories are evaluated by independent juries, using five “target issues” to define sustainable construction.&lt;ref name="TargetIssues"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holcimawards.org/target |title=Target issues for sustainable construction|accessdate=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of these align with the [[triple bottom line|triple bottom line concept]] of balanced social, environmental and economic performance. The two remaining target issues define contextual and aesthetic impact, as well as innovation and transferability.

==Juries==

The independent juries consist of renowned experts from architecture, engineering, planning, and the construction industry.&lt;ref name="Jury"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lafargeholcim-foundation.org/awards/5th-cycle/global/JuryGlobal|title=Global LafargeHolcim Awards Jury|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Prizes==

The total prize money for each cycle of the regional and global LafargeHolcim Awards competitions is USD 2 million.&lt;ref name="StepByStep"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holcimfoundation.org/AwardApplication/holcim-awards/prizesandschedule |title=Prizes and schedule |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leon Golub''' (January 23, 1922 – August 8, 2004) was an American [[Painting|painter]]. He was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], where he also studied, receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1942, and his [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] and [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in 1949 and 1950, respectively.

He was married to and collaborated with the artist [[Nancy Spero]] (1926 – October 18, 2009). Their son [[Stephen Golub]] is an economics professor at [[Swarthmore College]]. Their son Philip Golub is Professor of International and Comparative Politics at the American University of Paris and was a longstanding contributing editor of the influential journal ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]''. Their youngest son Paul Golub is a theater director and acting teacher working in France.

== Early life ==
Born in Chicago in 1922, Golub received his B.A. in Art History from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1942. From 1947 to 1949 he studied under the [[G.I. Bill]] at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] (SAIC). The student body included a large number of vets, including Golub’s one-time flatmate [[Cosmo Campoli]], [[George Cohen (artist)|George Cohen]], Theodore Halkin and [[Seymour Rosofsky|Seymour Rosofsky,]] whose work often reflected the horrors of war, as well as the uncertainties of the Cold War and Nuclear age.&lt;ref name="Corbett"&gt;Corbett, John. "Bleak House: Chicago's Monster Artists," in ''Monster Roster: Existentialist Art in Postwar Chicago,'' John Corbett, Jim Dempsey, Jessica Moss, and Richard A. Born, University of Chicago Press: Smart Museum of Art, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at SAIC that he met the artist Nancy Spero, to whom he was married for nearly fifty years. Golub helped organize and showed in the seminal Momentum Exhibitions of 1948–1949, put together by SAIC and [[IIT Institute of Design|Institute of Design]] students in protest over their exclusion from the Art Institute’s prestigious "Annual Exhibition by Artists of Chicago and Vicinity."&lt;ref name="Corbett" /&gt; He was also featured, along with Campoli, Halkin and Rosofsky, in the Art Institute’s "Veteran's Exhibition" of 1948.&lt;ref name="Smart"&gt;Corbett, John and Jim Dempsey, Jessica Moss, and Richard A. Born. [https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Roster-Existentialist-Postwar-Chicago/dp/0935573488 ''Monster Roster: Existentialist Art in Postwar Chicago,''] University of Chicago Press: Smart Museum of Art, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The group included, in addition to Golub’s aforementioned classmates, [[June Leaf]], [[H.C. Westermann]], [[Irving Petlin]], Evelyn Statsinger, Don Baum, and [[Arthur Lerner]].&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt;

In Chicago, Golub became involved with other artists collectively dubbed the "[[Chicago Imagists|Monster Roster]]" by critic Franz Schulze in the late 1950s, based on their affinity for sometimes gruesome, [[Expressionism|expressive figuration]], fantasy and mythology, and [[Existentialism|existential]] thought.&lt;ref name="MCA"&gt;Schulze, Franz. "Art in Chicago: The Two Traditions," in [https://www.amazon.com/Art-Chicago-1945-1995-Jeff-Abell/dp/050023728X ''Art in Chicago 1945-1995''], Museum of Contemporary Art, ed. Lynne Warren. New York: Thames and Hudson, 1996, p.16-20. Retrieved March 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smart" /&gt; They believed that an observable connection to the external world and to actual events was essential if art was to have any relevance to the viewer or society. This is a view that informed Golub's work throughout his career.

Golub, and the group, gained notice in the 1950s when art historian and curator Peter Selz featured him, Campoli and Cohen in a 1955 ''ARTnews'' article, "Is There a New Chicago School?", and included him, Campoli and Westermann in the 1959 Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) exhibition, ''New Images of Man'', as examples of vanguard expressive figurative work in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name="Adrian"&gt;Adrian, Dennis. "Introduction," in ''Monster Roster: Existentialist Art in Postwar Chicago,'' John Corbett, Jim Dempsey, Jessica Moss, and Richard A. Born, University of Chicago Press: Smart Museum of Art, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huebner"&gt;Huebner, Jeff, [https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-in-crowd/Content?oid=891943 "The In-Crowd,"], ''Chicago Reader''. Retrieved April 13, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, the Monster Roster would be regarded as forerunners to the more widely known [[Chicago Imagists]].

== Career ==
Golub, who always painted in a figural style, drew upon diverse representations of the body from ancient Greek and Roman sculpture, to photographs of athletic competitions, to gay pornography; often pulled directly from a huge database he assembled of journalistic images from the mass media. He likened his painting process to sculptural technique and employed a method of layering and scraping away paint, sometimes using a [[Cleaver (knife)|meat cleaver]], leaving varying amounts of canvas untouched.

From 1959 through 1964, Golub and his wife [[Nancy Spero]] opted to live in Europe, a move occasioned in part by the belief that Europe would be more receptive to their work dealing overtly with issues of power, sexual and political. During this period Golub's work increased in size because of larger available studio space and the inspiration of the French tradition of large-scale history painting. He also switched from using [[lacquer]] to [[Acrylic paint|acrylics]], left more of the surface unpainted, and began to grind the paint directly into the canvas. While in Italy, both Golub and Spero were profoundly influenced by the figurative works of [[Etruscan art|Etruscan]] and [[Roman art]], whose narratives addressed ancient themes of power and violence.

When Golub returned to [[New York (state)|New York State]], the [[Vietnam War]] was escalating, and he responded with his two series: Napalm and Vietnam.  He and Spero became active with ''Artists and Writers Protest'', "the first such group to take a public stand against the war".&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, Lester R, ''Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict'' Second Edition, Academic Press, 2008. {{ISBN|0123695031}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967 as part of the group's ''Angry Arts Week'', Golub organized ''The Collage of Indignation'', a collaborative work by over 150 artists which he described as "not political art, but rather an expression of popular revulsion."&lt;ref&gt;Event, quote and source found in ''The Turning Point Art And Politics In 1968'' by Nina Castelli Sundell, 
Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art, Cleveland, 1988. See:[http://www.lehman.edu/vpadvance/artgallery/gallery/turning_point/sundell.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Golub had a career breakthrough that same year when he was selected to exhibit five paintings at the Museum of Modern Art's "New Images of Man" show in New York City. His work was included alongside that of such established and rising artists as Willem de Kooning, Francis Bacon and Jackson Pollock.

In the mid-1970s, Golub was beset with self-doubt. He destroyed or cut up many works he produced up to this period and nearly abandoned painting. In the late seventies, however, he produced more than a hundred portraits of public figures, among them political leaders, dictators, and religious figures. ''Leon Golub: Paintings, 1950-2000'' includes several portraits of [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[Ho Chi Minh]], along with images of [[Fidel Castro]], [[Francisco Franco]], [[Richard Nixon]], and [[Henry Kissinger]].

In the 1980s, Golub turned his attention to terrorism in a variety of forms, from the subversive operations of governments to urban street violence. Killing fields, torture chambers, bars, and brothels became inspiration and subject for work that dealt with such themes as violent aggression, racial inequality, gender ambiguity, oppression, and exclusion. Among the work produced in this period are the series ''Mercenaries'', ''Interrogation'', ''Riot'', and ''Horsing Around''.  His ''Interrogation II'' (1981; Art Institute of Chicago&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/100250 ''Interrogation II''] at the Art Institute of Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;) is representative of the subject from this period and Golub's technique, "the canvas painted, scraped and repainted many times to create a tense, skinlike surface."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Gowing]], ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.2 (Facts on File, 2005): 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the nineties to his death, Golub's work shifted toward the illusionistic, with forms semi-visible, and appropriated graphic styles from ancient carvings, medieval manuscripts, and contemporary [[graffiti]]. As an older man he began to consider his own mortality, and moved toward themes of separation, loss, and death. Text appeared in many of the paintings combined with a series of symbolic references, including dogs, lions, skulls, and skeletons.

Golub's work was seen in solo exhibitions throughout the world, among them ''World Wide'' (1991), a Grand Lobby project at the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art]]. For ''World Wide'' the artist created a process, repeated in exhibitions at several other museums, by which he enlarged images and details from his paintings and screened them on transparent sheets of vinyl, hung so that they surround the viewer. He was represented in many group exhibitions and was one of the few white artists included in ''Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art'' at the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in 1994.

In 1996, Golub was given a commission to design a set of stained glass windows for [[Temple Sholom]] in [[Chicago]], the four windows depict the life of Joseph. These would be the only stained glass windows Leon Golub ever did. They were fabricated in New York by Victor Rothman and Gene Mallard.

== 2001: renaissance ==

While Leon Golub's later works from the 1990s offer more fragmented (in his words "left-over") reincarnations of his early messages, it is his larger, carved works, vividly depicting power relations that have re-gained attention with the U.S.'s involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 2003, Golub revisited his 1959 painting, ''Reclining Youth'', part of a series of paintings inspired by [[frieze]]s at the [[Pergamon Altar|Great Altar of Zeus]] in [[Pergamon]]. Working with [[Magnolia Editions]], the artist translated the painting into a large-scale [{{convert|14|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}}] [[tapestry|Jacquard tapestry]], his first and only textile work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/Content/Golub/F00001.html Magnolia Editions - Leon Golub.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720113934/http://www.magnoliaeditions.com/Content/Golub/F00001.html |date=2008-07-20 }} Retrieved Nov. 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retrospectives==

From March to May 2015 the [[Serpentine Gallery]] in London held a career retrospective&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Searle ''Leon Golub: Bite Your Tongue'' The Guardian. March 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; which was "spun off" and presented as a three-floor career retrospective at the Manhattan [[Hauser &amp; Wirth]] in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter, Holland, ''Leon Golub’s ‘Riot’ Revisits Political Art With a Sense of the Absurd'' New York Times June 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Japanese releases==
*[[Europe]]: ADV Films UK released the series on DVD in [[Europe]] in at least two versions, one of them being [[Scandinavia]]n.&lt;br /&gt;Klub Publishing released the first two series on DVD in [[Hungary]].

==Toys==

===Human figures===
The series has many figures of the various characters. Atelier Sai has produced a blind-box set based on Fumoffu's female characters-a set with guns, and a set from the hot spring. 1/6 and 1/8 scale figures of Tessa and Kaname are available, some of which have removable clothing.

===Arm Slaves===
The series has various action figures of the Arm Slaves. Alter and Aoshima produced 1/48 and 1/35 scale figures of Kurz and Mao's Gernsbacks, the Arbalest and an RK-92 Savage. Kaiyodo introduced the Arbalest and Laevatein into their Revoltech line in 2007 and 2008. In August 2011, Revoltech re-released the Laevatein in a much bigger package which includes the XL-3 flight pack as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hlj.com/product/KYD010476 |title=Revoltech ARX-8 Laevatein with XL-3 Booster by Kaiyodo &amp;#124; HobbyLink Japan |publisher=Hlj.com |date=2012-01-02 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bandai took it a step further in 2009 by including the Arm Slaves as part of the company's ''Robot Damashii'' (Robot Spirits) line-up, starting with the Arbalest in September 2009. Since then, the firm produced replicas of Kurz and Mao's Gernsbacks, the Falke, desert and urban versions of the Savage AS, the standard and Combat variations of Sousuke's Bonta-kun, the ARX-8 Laevatein,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://tamashii.jp/item/item.php?eid=01478&amp;pref=500 |title=ROBOT魂 ARX-8 レーバテイン &amp;#124; 魂ウェブ |publisher=Tamashii.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Codarl,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://tamashii.jp/item/item.php?eid=01509&amp;pref=500 |title=ROBOT魂 コダール &amp;#124; 魂ウェブ |publisher=Tamashii.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; a recolored Arbalest with Lambda Driver flame-effect parts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://tamashii.jp/item/item.php?eid=01658&amp;pref=500 |title=ROBOT魂 アーバレスト ラムダ・ドライバ &amp;#124; 魂ウェブ |publisher=Tamashii.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leonard Testarossa's Belial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://tamashii.jp/item/10412/ |title=ROBOT魂 〈SIDE AS〉Plan1055 ベリアル &amp;#124; 魂ウェブ |publisher=Tamashii.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The XL-2 Emergency jetpack,&lt;ref&gt;http://p-bandai.jp/tamashiiwebshouten/robotdamashii/item-1000004645/&lt;/ref&gt; the mass-produced Combat Bonta-kun (a gray-skinned soldier version that appeared in the ''Fumoffu'' episode ''Fancy without Honor or Humanity''),&lt;ref&gt;http://p-bandai.jp/tamashiiwebshouten/robotdamashii/item-1000006115/&lt;/ref&gt; a blue-and-white Savage that appeared in the novel ''Burning One-Man Force'',&lt;ref&gt;http://p-bandai.jp/tamashiiwebshouten/robotdamashii/item-1000003968/&lt;/ref&gt; the XL-3 flight pack,&lt;ref&gt;http://p-bandai.jp/tamashiiwebshouten/robotdamashii/item-1000009493/&lt;/ref&gt; Gates and Gauron's Venom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://p-bandai.jp/tamashiiwebshouten/item-1000014776/ |title=ROBOT魂 コダールi(ヴェノム) &amp;#124; プレミアムバンダイ &amp;#124; バンダイ公式通販サイト |publisher=P-bandai.jp |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; the mass-produced Codarl,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://p-bandai.jp/tamashiiwebshouten/item-1000015225/ |title=ROBOT魂 コダールm &amp;#124; プレミアムバンダイ &amp;#124; バンダイ公式通販サイト |publisher=P-bandai.jp |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; their weapon set,&lt;ref&gt;http://p-bandai.jp/bc/img/model/m/1000015226_1.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; and a flight pack designed for the Arbalest Lambda Driver &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://p-bandai.jp/tamashiiwebshouten/item-1000015586/ |title=ROBOT魂 アーバレスト"ラムダ・ドライバ"専用 緊急展開ブースター＋プロトデモリッションガンセット &amp;#124; プレミアムバンダイ &amp;#124; バンダイ公式通販サイト |publisher=P-bandai.jp |date=2012-11-22 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; are limited-edition online exclusives, with a sniper version of the Zy-99m Shadow slated for March 2014. &lt;ref&gt;http://tamashii.jp/item/10503/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hobby Japan]] offered the Hiroshi Squadron Gernsback (desert versions featured in the first season's ''Wind Blows at Home'' storyarc) as a mail-order exclusive in its issues from March to April 2010.

The '''Mammoth spear thrower''' is a [[spear thrower]] in the form of a [[mammoth]], discovered at the [[rock shelter]] of [[Montastruc, Tarn-et-Garonne]], France. It is from the late [[Magdalenian]] period and around 12,500 years old. It now forms part of the [[Henry Christy|Christy Collection]] in the [[British Museum]] (Palart 551), and is normally on display in Room 2.&lt;ref name=bm&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/s/mammoth_spear_thrower.aspx Spear thrower carved as a mammoth.] British Museum 2011. Retrieved 14 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 7 February – 26 May 2013 it was displayed in the exhibition at the British Museum ''Ice Age Art: Arrival of the Modern Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/ice_age_art.aspx Ice Age Art: Arrival of the Modern Mind]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

The spear thrower was carved from a reindeer antler and depicts a mammoth with a hole for an eye which probably held a bone or stone insert originally. The hook has been repaired after the antler from which it was carved broke. The tusks of the mammoth appear on each side but have mostly been lost due to damage. It is about 12&amp;nbsp;cm in length.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

The mammoth is produced in low-relief on both sides of the object. When it was discovered, the broken tail hook had already been repaired. This was achieved by drilling a hole through the mammoth shape, just in front of the broken hook - and inserting in another piece of antler (Sieveking 1987, 65).

Spear throwers were first used in western Europe about 20,000 years ago and enabled hunters to launch spears with more force and speed than if they threw just by hand. It was common for them to be decorated with animal carvings.&lt;ref name=bm/&gt;

Other types of spear throwers include the perforated batons, which are also often decorated. A wonderful [[Baton fragment (Palart 310)|example]] from La Madeleine can be seen at the British Museum in Room 2.

{{National Literary "Matters"}}
The '''Matter of Britain''' is the body of [[Medieval literature]] and legendary material associated with [[Great Britain]], and sometimes [[Brittany]], and the [[list of legendary kings of Britain|legendary kings]] and heroes associated with it, particularly [[King Arthur]]. It was one of the three great [[short story cycle|story cycles]] recalled repeatedly in medieval literature, together with the [[Matter of France]], which concerned the legends of [[Charlemagne]], and the [[Matter of Rome]], which included material derived from or inspired by [[classical mythology]].

==History==
The three "Matters" were first described in the [[12th century]] by [[France|French]] poet [[Jean Bodel]], whose epic ''[[:fr:Chanson des Saisnes|La Chanson des Saisnes]]'' ("Song of the Saxons") contains the line:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''Ne sont que III matières à nul homme atandant,''
''De France et de Bretaigne, et de Rome la grant.''

"Not but with three matters no man should attend:
Of France, and of Britain, and of Rome the grand."&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The name distinguishes and relates the Matter of Britain from the mythological themes taken from [[classical antiquity]], the "[[Matter of Rome]]", and the tales of the [[paladin]]s of [[Charlemagne]] and their wars with the [[Moors]] and [[Saracen]]s, which constituted the "[[Matter of France]]". Arthur is the chief subject of the Matter of Britain, along with stories related to the [[List of legendary kings of Britain|legendary kings of the British]], as well as lesser-known topics related to the history of [[Great Britain]] and [[Brittany]], such as the stories of [[Brutus of Troy]], [[Coel Hen]], [[Leir of Britain]] (King Lear), and [[Gogmagog (giant)|Gogmagog]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Themes and subjects==
===Legendary history of Britain===
It could be said that the legendary history of Britain was created partly to form a body of patriotic myth for the country. Several agendas thus can be seen in this body of literature.

The ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', the earliest known source of the story of Brutus of Troy, may have been devised to create a distinguished [[genealogy]] for a number of [[Wales|Welsh]] princes in the 9th century. Traditionally attributed to [[Nennius]], its actual compiler is unknown; it exists in several recensions. This tale went on to achieve greater currency because its inventor linked Brutus to the diaspora of [[hero]]es that followed the [[Trojan War]], and thus provided raw material which later mythographers such as [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]], [[Michael Drayton]], and [[John Milton]] could draw upon, linking the settlement of [[Great Britain|Britain]] to the [[heroic Age (literary theory)|heroic age]] of [[Greek literature]], for their several and diverse literary purposes. As such, this material could be used for patriotic mythmaking just as [[Virgil]] linked the [[founding of Rome]] to the Trojan War in ''[[Aeneid|The Æneid]]''. Geoffrey of Monmouth also introduced the fanciful claim that the [[Trinovantes]], reported by [[Tacitus]] as dwelling in the area of [[London]], had a name he interpreted as ''Troi-novant'', "New [[Troy]]".

More speculative claims link [[Welsh mythology]] with several of the rulers and incidents compiled by Geoffrey of Monmouth in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae|Historia Regum Britanniæ]]''. It has been suggested, for instance, that Leir of Britain, who later became [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'', was originally the Welsh sea-god [[Llŷr]] (see also the [[Ireland|Irish]] sea-god [[Ler (mythology)|Ler]]). Various Celtic [[deity|deities]] have been identified with characters from Arthurian literature as well: [[Morgan le Fay]] was often thought to have originally been the Welsh goddess [[Modron]] (cf. [[the Morrígan]]). Many of these identifications come from the speculative [[comparative religion]] of the late 19th century, and have been questioned in more recent years.

[[William Shakespeare]] was interested in the legendary history of Britain, and was familiar with some of its more obscure byways. Shakespeare's plays contain several tales relating to these legendary kings, such as ''King Lear'' and ''[[Cymbeline]]''. It has been suggested that Shakespeare's [[Wales|Welsh]] [[teacher|schoolmaster]] [[Thomas Jenkins (headmaster)|Thomas Jenkins]] introduced him to this material, and perhaps directed him to read Geoffrey of Monmouth{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}. These tales also figure in [[Raphael Holinshed]]'s ''The Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland'', which also appears in Shakespeare's sources for ''[[Macbeth]]''.

Other early authors also drew from the early Arthurian and pseudo-historical sources of the Matter of Britain. The [[Scotland|Scots]], for instance, formulated a mythical history in the [[List of kings of the Picts|Picts]] and the [[List of kings of Dál Riata|Dál Riata]] royal lines. While they do eventually become factual lines, unlike those of Geoffrey, their origins are vague and often incorporate both aspects of mythical British history and mythical [[Irish mythology|Irish]] history. The story of [[Gabrán mac Domangairt]] especially incorporates elements of both those histories.

===Arthurian cycle===
The Arthurian [[List of literary cycles|literary cycle]] is the best known part of the Matter of Britain. It has succeeded largely because it tells two interlocking stories that have intrigued many later authors. One concerns [[Camelot]], usually envisioned as a doomed [[utopia]] of chivalric virtue, undone by the fatal flaws of Arthur and Sir Lancelot. The other concerns the quests of the various knights to achieve the [[Holy Grail]]; some succeed ([[Galahad]], [[Percival]]), and others fail ([[Lancelot]]).

The medieval tale of Arthur and his knights is full of [[Christian]] themes; those themes involve the destruction of human plans for virtue by the moral failures of their characters, and the quest for an important Christian [[relic]]. Finally, the relationships between the characters invited treatment in the tradition of [[courtly love]], such as Lancelot and [[Guinevere]], or [[Tristan and Iseult]]. In more recent years, the trend has been to attempt to link the tales of King Arthur and his knights with Celtic mythology, usually in highly romanticized, early 20th century reconstructed versions.

The work of [[Jessie Weston]], in particular ''[[From Ritual to Romance]]'', traced Arthurian imagery through Christianity to roots in early nature worship and vegetation rites, though this interpretation is no longer fashionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Waste Land and Jessie Weston: A Reassessment |first=Leon |last=Surette |journal=Twentieth Century Literature |volume=34 |issue=2 |date=Summer 1988 |pages=223–244 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it is possible to read the Arthurian literature in general, and that concerned with the Grail tradition in particular, as an allegory of human development and spiritual growth (a theme explored by [[mythology|mythologist]] [[Joseph Campbell]] amongst others).

'''Monumental brass''' is a species of engraved [[church monument|sepulchral memorial]] which in the early part of the 13th century began to partially take the place of three-dimensional [[church monument|monuments]] and [[effigy|effigies]] carved in stone or wood. Made of hard [[latten]] or sheet [[brass]], let into the pavement, and thus forming no obstruction in the space required for the services of the church, they speedily came into general use, and continued to be a favourite style of sepulchral memorial for three centuries.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |title=Monumental brass |volume=4 |page=434 |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri04chisrich#page/434/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Europe==
[[File:Brass of Simon de Felbrigge and wife St Margaret's Church Felbrigg Norfolk.jpg|thumb|220px|Monumental brass of Simon de Felbrigge and wife Margaret of Teschen, St Margaret's Church, [[Felbrigg]], [[Norfolk]].]]
Besides their great value as historical monuments, monumental brasses are interesting as authentic contemporary evidence of the varieties of armour and costume, or the peculiarities of [[palaeography]] and [[heraldic]] designs, and they are often the only authoritative records of the intricate details of family history. Although the intrinsic value of the metal has unfortunately contributed to the wholesale spoliation of these interesting monuments, they are still found in remarkable profusion in [[England]], and they were at one time equally common in [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[Low Countries]]. In France, however, those that survived the troubles of the 16th century were totally swept away during the [[Reign of Terror]], and almost the only evidence of their existence is now supplied by the collection of drawings bequeathed by [[Richard Gough (antiquarian)|Gough]] to the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

Only two or three examples, and these of late date, are known in [[Scotland]], among which are the memorials of Alexander Cockburn (1564) at [[Ormiston]]; of the regent [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|Murray]] (1569) in the collegiate church of [[St Giles]], [[Edinburgh]]; and of the [[Earl of Minto|Minto family]] (1605) in the south aisle of the nave of [[Glasgow Cathedral]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The Earl of Moray had been [[James Hamilton (assassin)|assassinated]], and his monumental brass carries the Moray arms and figures representing Religion and Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Love (1989). Page 34 and 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The fine memorials of the royal [[Rulers of Saxony|house of Saxony]] in the cathedrals of [[Albrechtsburg|Meissen]] and [[Freiberg Cathedral|Freiberg]] are the most artistic and striking brasses in Germany. Among the 13th-century examples existing in German churches are the full-length memorials of Yso von Welpe, [[Prince-Bishop of Verden]] (1231), and of Bernard, [[bishop of Paderborn]] (1340). Many fine Flemish specimens exist in [[Belgium]], especially at [[Bruges]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==In England==
The majority of extant memorial brasses are now found in England, where it is calculated that there may be about 4,000 still remaining in various churches. They are most abundant in the eastern counties, and this fact has been frequently adduced in support of the opinion that they were of Flemish manufacture. But at the time sepulchral brasses were most often fashioned, the eastern counties of England were a centre of commercial activity and wealth, and there are numerous engraved memorials of civilians and prosperous merchants in the churches of [[Ipswich]], [[Norwich]], [[King's Lynn|Lynn]] and [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]]. Flemish brasses can be found in England, but they are not common, and they are readily distinguished from English workmanship. The Flemish examples have the figures engraved in the centre of a large plate, the background filled in with diapered or scroll work, and the inscription placed round the edge of the plate. The English examples have the figures cut out to the outline and inserted in corresponding cavities in the slab, the darker colour of the stone serving as a background. This is not an invariable distinction, however, as figure-brasses of Flemish origin are found both at Bruges and in England. But the character of the engraving is constant, the Flemish work being more florid in design, the lines shallower, and the broad lines cut with a chisel-pointed tool instead of the lozenge-shaped [[burin (engraving)|burin]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The brass of [[Robert Hallum]], [[bishop of Salisbury]], the envoy of [[Henry V of England|King Henry V]] to the [[council of Constance]], who died and was interred there in 1416, precisely resembles the brasses of England in the details which distinguish them from styles elsewhere in Europe. Scarcely any of the brasses which now exist in England can be confidently referred to the first half of the 13th century, though several undoubted examples of this period are on record. The full-sized brass of Sir John d'Aubernon at [[Stoke d'Abernon]] in [[Surrey]] (c. 1277) has the decorations of the shield filled in with a species of enamel. Other examples of this occur, and the probability is that, in most cases, the lines of the engraving were filled with colouring matter, though brass would scarcely bear the heat requisite to fuse the ordinary enamels. A well-known 13th-century example is that of Sir Roger de Trumpington (c. 1290), who accompanied [[Edward I of England|Prince Edward]] in his expedition to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and is represented cross-legged. About half a dozen examples of this stylistic feature are known.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

The 14th-century brasses are much more numerous, and present a remarkable variety in their details. The finest specimen is that of Nicholas Lord Burnell (1315) in the [[St Mary's Church, Acton Burnell|church of Acton Burnell]], [[Shropshire]]. In the 15th century the design and execution of monumental brasses had attained their highest excellence. The beautiful brass of [[Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick]] (d. 1401), and his wife Margaret, which formerly covered the tomb in [[Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick|St Mary’s church, Warwick]], is a striking example. One of the best specimens of plate armour is that of Sir Robert Stantoun (1458) in [[Castle Donington]] church, [[Leicestershire]], and one of the finest existing brasses of ecclesiastics is that of Thomas de la Mare, Abbot of [[St Albans Cathedral|St Albans Abbey]] from 1349 to 1396.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; An interesting [[monumental brass of John Rudying]] dated 1481 in the [[Church of St Andrew, Biggleswade|Church of St Andrew]] in [[Biggleswade]] shows the figure of Death about to strike [[Archdeacon]] Rudying with a spear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dro.dur.ac.uk/17917/ Cartlidge, Neil, ''A debate with death : John Rudyng's Brass in St Andrew's Church, Biggleswade'', Transactions of the Monumental Brass Society., 19 (2) (2015) pp. 94-100 - [[University of Durham]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.org/ash/objects/makedetail.php?pmu=504&amp;mu=505&amp;gty=brow&amp;sec=&amp;dtn=50&amp;sfn=Region,County,Site%20name,Find%20Spot&amp;cpa=3&amp;rpos=115 Brass Monumental Brass of Death and John Rudying - Rubbings Collection - [[Ashmolean Museum]], [[University of Oxford]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is only in the 16th century that the engraved representations become portraits. Previous to that period the features were invariably represented conventionally, though sometimes personal peculiarities were added. A large number of brasses in England are [[palimpsest]]s, the back of an ancient brass having been engraved for the more recent memorial. Thus a brass commemorative of Margaret Bulstrode (1540) at [[Hedgerley]] in [[Buckinghamshire]], on being removed from its position, was discovered to have been previously the memorial of Thomas Totyngton, abbot of [[Bury St. Edmunds|St Edmundsbury]] (1312). The abbey was only surrendered to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] in 1539, so that before the year was out the work of spoliation had begun, and the abbot’s brass had been removed and re-engraved to Margaret Bulstrode. These ancient brasses were often stolen and re-erected after being engraved on the reverse, as at [[Berkhampstead]], because until the establishment of a manufactory at [[Esher]] in [[Surrey]] by a German artisan in 1649, all sheet brass had to be imported from other countries on the European mainland.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==Nineteenth-century brasses==
[[File:Trumpington monumental brass.jpg|right|thumb|Sir Roger de Trumpington in [[Trumpington, Cambridgeshire]]]]
There was a revival of interest in monumental brasses in the Victorian era. Victorian brasses can be seen at [[Truro Cathedral]] ([[Archbishop Benson]]), [[Oscott College]], Birmingham (Bishop [[John Milner (bishop)|John Milner]]), [[St. Nicolas' Church, Guildford|St. Nicolas', Guildford]] (Rev. W. S. Sanders), and All Saints, Boyne Hill, [[Maidenhead]] (Rev. Gresley and Canon Drummond).

The '''Municipal Theatre of Corfu''' ({{lang-el|Δημοτικό Θέατρο Κέρκυρας}}) was the main [[theatre]] and [[opera house]] in [[Corfu]], [[Greece]], from 1902 to 1943.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"&gt;Municipality of Corfu Official Website.

On its premises the exiled Serbian parliament, the Skoupsina, held up meetings in 1916, which decided the creation of the new Unified Kingdom of Yugoslavia.") Accessed 29 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre was the successor of the [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù]], which became the Corfu [[city hall]]. It was destroyed during a [[Luftwaffe]] [[airstrike|aerial bombardment]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; During its 41-year history it was one of the premier theatres and opera houses in [[Greece]].

== History and architecture ==

The Municipal theatre was built to accommodate the demands of a growing audience.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The decision for its construction was taken in 1885, during the mayoralty of [[Georgios Theotokis]], and construction started in 1893 by mayor Michael Theotokis.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; High construction 
costs delayed its inaugural opening until 1902.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The architect was the Italian Conrado Pergolesi who developed plans modelled after [[La Scala]] in [[Milan]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The maximum height of the theatre was 39 meters; there was a gallery at the front entrance adorned by high columns of the [[Tuscan order]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The entrance featured large purple [[column]]s and its high walls were decorated with [[fresco]]es of famous [[composer]]s created by Italian artists.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The upper floor was decorated by four [[Corinthian order]] semi-columns and a [[gable]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The official [[emblem]] [[shield]] of Corfu stood in [[relief]] at the centre of the gable surrounded by a [[laurel wreath]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;

[[File:Municipal Theatre of Corfu interior.jpg|thumb|left|220px|The interior of the Municipal Theatre of Corfu. The three ascending levels (rows) of boxes are visible; the gallery is on the fourth level at the top of the picture.]]

The auditorium included 64 decorated boxes arranged in three levels and a gallery for the general public at the top.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The first box in the first row was reserved for the theatre committee.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; Behind this box, inside an office, the archives of [[Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù|Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo]] were kept.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The first box of the second row was reserved for the Greek royal family.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; All boxes included [[gas light]]s at their bow.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The [[commoner]]s gathered at the top level in the gallery.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;  There was a [[proscenium]] which accommodated the [[orchestra]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; The orchestra was mainly made up of locals and it performed 10 operas per cycle.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; Opera season started in September and ended on the Sunday before [[Ash Monday]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;

The [[stage curtain]] of the new theatre was inherited from its predecessor, Teatro di San Giacomo, and was created by an Italian artist.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; It depicted a scene from the ''[[Odyssey]]'' where [[Odysseus]] was welcomed by King [[Alcinous]] to the land of the [[Phaiax|Phaiakes]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;

[[File:Stage curtain of San Giacomo.jpg|thumb|200px|The historic stage curtain of Teatro di San Giacomo depicting a scene from the [[Odyssey]]. It is the only artefact known to have survived the bombardment.]]

The theatre was considered one of [[Europe]]'s best, with great [[acoustics]] and richly decorated interiors depicting ancient [[Greek gods]] and musical themes, painted by Italian artists.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; It also functioned as a social gathering place where [[Upper class|high society]] gathered for [[dance]]s and [[Ball (dance)|balls]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; Its official opening date was 7 December 1902, with [[Wagner]]'s opera ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'' as the inaugural performance.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] also attended performances while vacationing at his [[Achilleion (Corfu)|Achilleion]] palace.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; In 1907 the [[Philharmonic Society of Corfu|Old Philharmonic of Corfu]] rendered a [[symphony]] in a performance which received much acclaim from the audience.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;

During the first quarter of the twentieth century, many [[Italian opera]]s were performed at the theatre.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; This tradition came to a halt following the [[Corfu incident|bombardment of Corfu]] in 1923 by the Italians.&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt; After the bombardment the theatre featured Greek operas as well as Greek theatre performances by distinguished Greek actors such as [[Marika Kotopouli]] and [[Pelos Katselis]].&lt;ref name="History of the municipal theatre"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5125">'''Nasîhatnâme''' ({{lang-ota|نصيحت نامه}}, ''Naṣīḥat-nāme'') were a type of guidance letter for [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman]] sultans, similar to [[mirrors for princes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Third Congress on the Social and Economic History of Turkey|year=1990|publisher=Varia Turcica|isbn=9780941469012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They draw on a variety of historical and religious sources, and were influenced by the governance of previous empires such as the Seljuk Turks or the Mongols, as well as by early Muslim history and by contemporary events.

==History==
Nasîhatnâme became common in the sixteenth century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Faroqhi|first=Suraiya|title=The Ottoman Empire and the world around it|year=2011|publisher=I. B. Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-122-9|pages=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but built on earlier works such as the Kutadgu Bilig (''Knowledge of Prosperity''), written in 1070 by Yusuf Has Hacip. Early influences include the inşa literature of the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ePmqBgAAQBAJ|title = The Culture of Letter-Writing in Pre-Modern Islamic Society|last = Gully|first = Adrian|date = 2008-02-07|publisher = Edinburgh University Press|isbn = 9780748633746|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some refer to [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref name="Good Old Days"&gt;{{cite journal|last=İnan|first=Kenan|title=Remembering the Good Old Days: the Ottoman Nasihatname [Advice  Letters] Literature of the 17th Century|journal=Ideology, Society and Values|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, nasîhatnâme are different from [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] ''Chronographia'', and were written for a different audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ottomans and the Balkans: A Discussion of Historiography|year=2002|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004119024|pages=199}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasîhatnâme were even commissioned by aspirants to Ottoman government - including, in one case, by the [[Phanariot]] [[Alexandros Skarlatou Kallimaki]], the probable father of [[Skarlatos Voyvodas Alexandrou Kallimaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Philiou|title=Biography of an Empire: Governing Ottomans in an Age of Revolution|year=2011|isbn=9780520266339|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 17th century, a sense of imperial decline began to affect the content of these texts; more than just advocating a return to some golden age (i.e. [[Suleyman the Magnificent]]) they highlighted specific systemic problems in the empire - including nepotism, revolts, military defeat, and corrupt [[Janissary|Janissaries]].&lt;ref name="Good Old Days"/&gt;

==Content==
Nasîhatnâme typically state a clear moral reason for why they are written and presented to leaders; whether piety, or morality, or realpolitik.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Comité international d'études pré-ottomanes et ottomanes, VIth Symposium|journal=Varia Turcica|year=1987|volume=4|pages=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Nativel Preciado began her professional career at the ''[[Arriba (newspaper)|Arriba]]'' (the official newspaper of the [[Francoist Spain|Franco regime]]) in 1966, then moved to the now-defunct newspaper ''{{ill|Madrid (newspaper)|es|Madrid (diario)|lt=Madrid}}'', where she remained from 1967 to 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=19kaAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Nativel+Preciado%22+%22Arriba%22 |title=Nosotras Que Contamos: Mujeres Periodistas en España |trans-title=We That Count: Women Journalists in Spain |first=Inés |last=García-Albi Gil de Biedma |publisher=Plaza &amp; Janés |isbn=9788401379819 |page=92 |date=1 January 2007 |access-date=23 August 2018 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specializing in political news, she was a witness and reporter of the important events that took place during the [[Spanish transition to democracy|Transition]] period for the newspaper ''[[ABC (newspaper)|ABC]]'' and the magazines ''[[Interviú]]'' and ''{{ill|Vindicación Feminista|es}}''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |title=Prensa de información general durante la transición política española (1974–1984) |trans-title=General Information Press During the Spanish Political Transition (1974–1984) |first=Núria |last=Simelio Solá |publisher=[[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] Faculty of Communication Sciences |page=153 |language=Spanish |year=2006 |via=Tesis Doctorals en Xarxa}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 she joined the editorial staff of the newly created ''[[Tiempo (magazine)|Tiempo]]'' magazine.

Her activity as an opinion columnist in the written press has been combined with participation in discussions and debates both on radio and television.

'''''Nursing Madonna with an Angel''''' is an oil on panel painting by [[Correggio]], painted around 1524 and now in the [[Museum of Fine Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Fine Arts]] in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Giuseppe Adani, ''Correggio pittore universale'', Silvana Editoriale, Correggio 2007. {{ISBN|9788836609772}}&lt;/ref&gt; It measures 68.5 by 87 cm and belongs to the [[Nursing Madonna]] or 'Madonna Lactans' genre.

==History==
The painting's style places it around the same time as the commission of paintings for the Del Bono Chapel in [[San Giovanni Evangelista (Parma)|San Giovanni Evangelista]] abbey church, that is at the start of the 1530s. Nothing more is known about who commissioned it or when and the first documentary evidence for it is a 1603 inventory of the [[Aldobrandini]] collection in Rome, where it was probably admired by [[Federico Barocci]] and later by the young [[Antony van Dyck]] and [[Pietro da Cortona]]. It was praised by father Ottonelli in his ''Trattato della Pittura e della Scultura, uso et abuso loro'' as a model to explain how a religious subject could succeed unlike a secular one. According to Ottonelli, the main Roman cardinals of the 17th century competed to possess the ''Nursing Madonna''. There is an engraving of it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correggioarthome.it/Sezione.jsp?idSezione=173&amp;idSezioneRif=54|title=Lelio Orsi, Madonna col Bambino e i Santi Andrea e Giuda, XVI sec. - Correggio ART HOME|first=Netribe|last=srl|website=www.correggioarthome.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a drawing of it by [[Lelio Orsi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.correggioarthome.it/Sezione.jsp?idSezione=106&amp;idSezioneRif=54|title=Anonimo, Madonna del latte, da Correggio, XVI sec. - Correggio ART HOME|first=Netribe|last=srl|website=www.correggioarthome.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Persian Letters''''' ({{lang-fr|Lettres persanes}}) is a literary work, written in 1721, by [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu]], recounting the experiences of two [[Persia]]n noblemen, Usbek and Rica, who are traveling through [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url =http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k1051588x/f5.image.r=| title =  Lettres persanes | access-date= 13 June 2016 | year = 1721| publisher = P.

Brunel | place=Amsterdam| volume = II |via= Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
In 1711 Usbek leaves his [[seraglio]] in [[Isfahan]] to take the long journey to France, accompanied by his young friend Rica. He leaves behind five wives (Zashi, Zéphis, Fatmé, Zélis, and Roxane) in the care of a number of black [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuchs]], one of whom is the head or first eunuch. During the trip and their long stay in [[Paris]] (1712–1720), they comment, in letters exchanged with friends and [[mullah]]s, on numerous aspects of Western, Christian society, particularly French politics and [[Moors]], ending with a biting satire of the System of [[John Law (economist)|John Law]]. Over time, various disorders surface back in the seraglio, and, beginning in 1717 (Letter 139 [147]), the situation there rapidly unravels. Usbek orders his head eunuch to crack down, but his message does not arrive in time, and a revolt brings about the death of his wives, including the vengeful suicide of his favorite, Roxane, and, it appears, most of the eunuchs.

The Chronology breaks down as follows:

*Letters 1–21 [1–23]: The journey from Isfahan to France, which lasts almost 14 months (from 19 March 1711 to 4 May 1712).
*Letters 22 [24]–89 [92]: Paris in the reign of [[Louis XIV]], 3 years in all (from May 1712 to September 1715).
*Letters 90 [93]–137 [143] or [supplementary Letter 8 =145]: the Regency of [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|Philippe d’Orléans]], covering five years (from September 1715 to November 1720).
*Letters 138 [146]– 150 [161]: the collapse of the seraglio in Isfahan, approximately 3 years (1717–1720).

The first edition of the novel, which consists of 150 letters, appeared in May 1721 under the rubric Cologne: [[Pierre Marteau]], a front for the Amsterdam publisher Jacques Desbordes whose business is now run by his widow, Susanne de Caux.{{clarify|date=November 2014}} Called edition A, this is the text utilized in the recent critical edition of ''Lettres persanes'' for the complete works of Montesquieu published by the Voltaire Foundation in 2004. A second edition (B) by the same publisher later in the same year, for which there is so far no entirely satisfactory explanation, curiously included three new letters but omitted thirteen of the original ones. All subsequent editions in the author’s lifetime (i.e., until 1755) derive from A or B. A new edition in 1758, prepared by Montesquieu’s son, included eight new letters – bringing the total to 161 – and a short piece by the author entitled "Quelques réflexions sur les ''Lettres persanes''." This latter edition has been used for all subsequent editions until the ''Œuvres complètes'' of 2004, which reverts to the original edition but includes the added letters marked as "supplementary" and, in parentheses, the numbering scheme of 1758.

==An epistolary novel==
[[File:Persianische Briefe.jpg|thumb|An early illustration depicting Usbek and Rica]]
Montesquieu never referred to ''Lettres persanes'' (Persian Letters) as a [[novel]] until "Quelques remarques sur les ''Lettres persanes''," which begins: "Nothing about the ''Lettres persanes'' was more ingratiating than to find in it unexpectedly a sort of novel. There is a visible beginning, development, and ending […]." Initially, for most of its first readers as well as for its author, it was not considered primarily a novel, and even less an "[[epistolary novel]]" (as it is often classified now), which was not at that time a constituted genre. Indeed, it has little in common with the sole model at the time, Guilleragues’s ''[[Letters of a Portuguese Nun|Lettres portugaises]]'' of 1669. A collection of "letters" in 1721 would more likely evoke the recent tradition of essentially polemical and political periodicals, such as ''Lettres historiques'' (1692–1728), the Jesuits’ famous ''Lettres édifiantes et curieuses'' (1703–1776), not to mention [[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer|Mme Dunoyer’s]] ''Lettres historiques et galantes'' (1707–1717) which, in the form of a correspondence between two women, provide a chronicle of the end of the reign of Louis XIV and the beginning of the Regency. The ''Lettres persanes'' thus helped confirm the vogue of a format that was already established. But it is in its numerous imitations – such as ''Lettres juives'' (1738) and ''Lettres chinoises'' (1739) of [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|Boyer d’Argens]], ''Lettres d’une Turque à Paris, écrites à sa sœur'' (1730) by Poullain de Saint-Foix (published several times in conjunction with ''Lettres persanes''), and perhaps especially [[Françoise d'Issembourg d'Happoncourt, Madame de Graffigny|Françoise de Graffigny]]’s ''Lettres d’une Péruvienne'' (1747) – not to mention the letter-novels of [[Samuel Richardson|Richardson]] – which, between 1721 and 1754, had in effect transformed ''Lettres persanes'' into an "epistolary novel." Whence this remark in Montesquieu’s ''Mes Pensées'': "My ''Lettres persanes'' taught people to write letter-novels" (no. 1621).

The [[Epistolary novel|epistolary structure]] is quite flexible: nineteen correspondents in all, with at least twenty-two different recipients. Usbek and Rica by far dominate with sixty-six letters for the former and forty-seven for the latter (of the final 161). Ibben, who functions more as addressee than correspondent, writes only two letters but receives forty-two. Likewise, an unnamed person (designated only as ***) – if always the same – receives eighteen letters and writes none at all. There is even one complete anomaly, a letter from Hagi Ibbi to Ben Josué (Letter 37 [39]), neither of whom is mentioned elsewhere in the novel.

The letters are apparently all dated in accordance with a [[lunar calendar]] which, as [[Robert Shackleton]] showed in 1954, in fact corresponds to our own, by simple substitution of Muslim names, as follows: Zilcadé (January), Zilhagé (February), Maharram (March), Saphar (April), Rebiab I (May), Rebiab II (June), Gemmadi I (July), Gemmadi II (August), Rhegeb (September), Chahban (October), Rhamazan (November), Chalval (December).

==Social commentary==

In Paris, the Persians express themselves on a wide variety of subjects, from governmental institutions to salon caricatures. The difference of temperament of the two friends is notable, Usbek being more experienced and asking many questions, Rica less implicated and more free, and more attracted by Parisian life. Both retain Montesquieu's rich satirical tone, as in Rica's ''Lettre 72'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Je me trouvai l’autre jour dans une compagnie où je vis un homme bien content de lui. Dans un quart d’heure, il décida trois questions de morale, quatre problèmes historiques, et cinq points de physique : Je n’ai jamais vu un décisionnaire si universel ; son esprit ne fut jamais suspendu par le moindre doute. On laissa les sciences ; on parla des nouvelles du temps : il décida sur les nouvelles du temps. Je voulus l’attraper, et je dis en moi-même : Il faut que je me mette dans mon fort ; je vais me réfugier dans mon pays. Je lui parlai de la Perse ; mais, à peine lui eus-je dit quatre mots, qu’il me donna deux démentis, fondés sur l’autorité de messieurs Tavernier et Chardin. Ah ! bon Dieu ! dis-je en moi-même, quel homme est-ce là ? Il connoîtra tout à l’heure les rues d’Ispahan mieux que moi ! Mon parti fut bientôt pris : je me tus, je le laissai parler, et il décide encore.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Lettres_persanes/Lettre_72 Lettre 72]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;I found myself recently in a company where I met am man very well satisfied with himself. In a quarter of an hour, he decided three questions in morals, four historical problems, and five points in physics. I have never seen so universal a decider; his mind was not once troubled with the least doubt. We left science, and talked of the current news: he decided upon the current news. I wished to catch him, so I said to myself, “I must get to my strong point; I will betake me to my own country.” I spoke to him of Persia; but hardly had I opened my mouth, when he contradicted me twice, basing his objections upon the authority of Tavernier and Chardin. “Ah! Good heavens!” said I to myself, “what kind of man is this? He will know next all the streets in Ispahan better than I do!” I soon knew what part to play-to be silent, and let him talk; and he is still laying down the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Persian_Letters/Letter_72 Letter 72], trans. [[John Davidson (poet)|John Davidson]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although this takes place in the declining years of the aged king, much of what he has accomplished is still admired in a Paris where the Invalides is being completed and cafés and theatre proliferate. We observe the function of parliaments, tribunals, religious bodies ([[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]], [[Jesuits]], etc.), public places and their publics (the [[Tuileries]], the [[Palais Royal]]), state foundations (the hospital of the Quinze-Vingts [300] for the blind, the [[Les Invalides|Invalides]] for those wounded in war). They describe a thriving culture, where even the presence of two Persians quickly becomes a popular phenomenon, thanks to the proliferation of prints (letter 28 [30]). The café&amp;nbsp;– where debates take place (letter 34 [36])&amp;nbsp;– has become established as a public institution, as were already the theatre and opera. There are still people foolish enough to search at their own expense for the [[philosopher's stone]]; the newsmonger and the periodical press are beginning to play a role in everyday life. Everything from institutions (the [[University of Paris|university]], the [[Académie française|Academy]], Sciences, the Bull ''[[Unigenitus]]'') via groups (fashion, dandies, coquettes) to individuals (the opera singer, the old warrior, the rake, and so forth) comes to the eye of the reader.

Usbek for his part is troubled by religious contrasts. Though it never occurs to him to cease being a [[Muslim]], and while he still wonders at some aspects of Christianity (the [[Trinity]], [[Communion rite|communion]]), he writes to austere authorities to inquire, for example, why some foods are considered to be unclean (letters 15–17 [16–18]). He also assimilates the two religions and even all religions with respect to their social utility.

Certain sequences of letters by a single author develop more fully a particular subject, such as letters 11–14 from Usbek to Mirza on the Troglodytes, letters 109–118 (113–122) from Usbek to Rhedi on [[demography]], letters 128–132 (134–138) from Rica on his visit to the library at Saint-Victor. They sketch analyses that will later be developed in [[The Spirit of the Laws|''L’Esprit des lois'']] for many subjects such as the types of powers, the influence of climate and the critique of colonization.

==The dénouement==

While Usbek appreciates the freer relations among men and women in the West, he remains, as master of a seraglio, a prisoner of his past. His wives play the role of languorous and lonely lovers, he the role of master and lover, with no true communication and without revealing much about their true selves. Usbek’s language with them is as constrained as theirs with him. Knowing, moreover, from the outset that he is not assured of a return to Persia, Usbek is also already disabused about their attitude (letters 6 and 19 [20]). The seraglio is a hothouse from which he increasingly distances himself, trusting his wives no more than his eunuchs (Letter 6).

Everything cascades in the final letters (139–150 [147–161]), thanks to a sudden analepse of more than three years with respect to the preceding letters. From letter 69 (71) to letter 139 (147) – chronologically from 1714 to 1720 – not a single letter from Usbek relates to the seraglio, which is unmentioned in any guise from letter 94 to 143 (and even in the edition of 1758 from supplementary letter 8 (97) to 145. Moreover, all the letters from 126 (132) to 137 (148) are from Rica, which means that for about fifteen months (from 4 August 1719 to 22 October 1720) Usbek is completely silent. Although he has in the meantime received letters, the reader does not learn of them until the final series, which is more developed after the addition of supplementary letters 9–11 (157, 158, 160) of 1758. Although Usbek has learned as early as October 1714 that "the seraglio is in disorder" (letter 63 [65]). As the spirit of rebellion advances, he decides to act, but too late; with delays in the transmission of letters and the loss of some, the situation is beyond remedy.

A dejected Usbek is apparently resigned to the necessity of returning, with little hope, to Persia; on 4 October 1719 he laments: "I shall deliver my head to my enemies" (147 [155]). He nevertheless does not do so: late in 1720 he is still in Paris, for letters 134–137 (140–145), which contain the whole history of Law’s "System," are in fact posterior to Roxane’s last missive (dated 8 May 1720), which he must already have received – the usual time for delivery being about five months – when he writes the latest in date of his own (supplementary letter 8 and letter 138 [145 and 146]), in October and November 1720.

==Sources==

Montesquieu’s "sources" are legion, since they doubtless extend to readings and conversations which are modified en route. The impact of [[Jean Chardin]]’s ''Voyages en Perse'', to which he owes most of his information about Persia – which is far from superficial – must of course be recognized; he owned the two-volume edition of 1687 and purchased the extended edition in ten volumes in 1720. To a lesser degree, he drew on the ''Voyages'' of [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]] and [[Paul Rycaut]], not to mention many other works which his vast library afforded him. Everything having to do with contemporary France or Paris, on the other hand, comes from his own experience, and from conversations of anecdotes related to him.

Various aspects of the book are doubtless indebted to particular models, of which the most important is Giovanni Paolo Marana’s ''L’Espion dans les cours des princes chrétiens'' (''[[Letters Writ by a Turkish Spy]]''), widely known at the time, even though Montesquieu’s characters obviously are Persians and not Turks. While the great popularity of [[Antoine Galland]]’s ''Mille et Une Nuits'' (''[[The Arabian Nights]]'') contributes, as do the Bible and the Qu’ran, to the general ambiance of oriental subjects, in fact it has almost nothing in common with the ''Lettres persanes''.

==Critical history==

The ''Lettres persanes'' was an immediate success and often imitated, but it has been diversely interpreted over time. Until the middle of the twentieth century, it was its "spirit" of the Regency which was largely admired, as well as the caricature in the classical tradition of [[Jean de La Bruyère|La Bruyère]], [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] and [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle|Fontenelle]]. No one had the notion of attaching it to the novelistic genre. The Persian side of the novel tended to be considered as a fanciful decor, the true interest of the work lying in its factitious "oriental" impressions of French society, along with political and religious satire and critique.

In the 1950s began a new era of studies based on better texts and renewed perspectives. Particularly important were the extensively annotated edition by Paul Vernière and the research of [[Robert Shackleton]] on Muslim chronology; also studies by Roger Laufer, Pauline Kra and Roger Mercier, which put new focus on the work’s unity and integrated the seraglio into its overall meaning. Others who have followed have looked into the ramifications of epistolary form, the structure and meaning of the seraglio, Usbek’s contradictions. Beginning about 1970 it is religion (Kra) and especially politics (Ehrard, Goulemot, Benrekassa) which predominate in studies on ''Lettres persanes'', with a progressive return to the role of the seraglio with all its women and eunuchs (Delon, Grosrichard, Singerman, Spector) or the cultural cleavage of Orient and Occident.

The American philosopher [[Marshall Berman]] devotes several chapters in his book ''The Politics of Authenticity'' (1970) to the radical humanism of the Persian Letters.

===The Jewish Letters===
{{main article|Jewish Letters}}
The Jewish Letters of [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens|Boyer d'Argens]] were published in 1738, composed in a total of 180 letters that originally spanned 30 volumes. Although they are certainly an imitation of the Persian Letters, they are not considered plagiarism due to the distinction of content between the two works. Although he titled himself as the work's "translator", he is most ascribed as the work's author.

"'''Saginaw, Michigan'''" is a 1964 song performed by [[Lefty Frizzell]].  The single was Lefty Frizzell's sixth and final number one on the U.S. country chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book Of Top 40 Country Hits: 1944-2006, Second edition|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Saginaw, Michigan" spent a total of twenty-three weeks on the country chart and peaked at number eighty-five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;[Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The song earned Lefty Frizzell a Grammy nomination.

The most notable cover of the song was done by [[Bobby Bare]]. It was included on his 1966 LP, ''The Streets of Baltimore''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discogs.com/Bobby-Bare-The-Streets-Of-Baltimore/release/3093334&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The song is sung from the point of view of the working-class son of a fisherman from the titular city of [[Saginaw, Michigan]], who falls in love with the daughter of a much wealthier man. The rich man does not believe the singer is worthy of his daughter, so the singer travels north to Alaska in hopes of finding gold. When there is no gold, the singer concocts a ruse upon returning to Saginaw: he tells the wealthy man that he had struck a huge amount of gold and sells the worthless plot to the rich man for him to develop.

The song ends with the bamboozled rich man searching in vain for the gold in Alaska, while his daughter gladly accepts the singer's hand in marriage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1396">A '''sail switch''', '''vane switch''' or '''flow switch''' is a [[Machine|mechanical]] switch that is switched on or off in response to the flow or non-flow of a [[fluid]] such as air or water. A sail switch typically operates through the use of a [[paddle]] which gets displaced due to the force of fluid moving past it. Sail switches find application in the detection of fluid flow and measurement of [[Mechanical fan|fan]] speeds. A sail switch might be used to protect a central heating system electric heating element from being energized before the air flow from the blower is established.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.appliedgmc.com/images/suburban_ntseries_furnace.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Sail switches might also be used to alarm if a ventilation fan in a hazardous location fails and air flow has stopped.

{{RunicChars}}
What is usually referred to as '''St Cuthbert's coffin''' is a fragmentary oak coffin in [[Durham Cathedral]], pieced together in the 20th century, which between AD 698 and 1827 contained the remains of [[Saint Cuthbert]], who died in 687. In fact when Cuthbert's remains were yet again reburied in 1827 in a new coffin, some 6,000 pieces of up to four previous layers of coffin were left in the burial, and then finally removed in 1899.  This coffin is thought to be Cuthbert's first wooden coffin, and probably to date to 698, when his remains were moved from a stone sarcophagus in the abbey church at [[Lindisfarne]] to the main altar.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;Wilson, 49-50; [http://www.earlymedievalart.com/category/metalwork/ here for number of fragments]&lt;/ref&gt;

The coffin is almost the only survival of what was no doubt a very large body of Anglo-Saxon wood carving, being inscribed or engraved with linear images which have ''[[tituli]]'' in Latin lettering and [[Anglo-Saxon runes]] with names of apostles and saints; many names are illegible.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

==History==
[[File:St Cuthberts Tomb.jpg|thumb|The most recent resting place of Cuthbert's remains, in [[Durham Cathedral]]]]
Cuthbert died on 20 March 687 in his hermit's cell on [[Farne Islands|Inner Farne Island]], two miles from [[Bamburgh]], [[Northumberland]], and was taken back to the main monastery at  Lindisfarne to be buried.  Eleven years later the coffin was re-opened, and according to his biographies (including prose and verse ones by [[Bede]] from about 720) his remains were found to be "[[Incorruptibility|incorrupt]]" or undecayed.  This was a traditional attribute of sainthood and helped greatly in his subsequent cult.  He was reburied in a new coffin, apparently over the original one, which is described in his biographies, and matches the surviving coffin closely; this is called a ''levis theca'' ("light chest" in Latin) in Bede's biography.  This was placed above ground at the altar, and apparently covered with a linen cloth, an indication that Cuthbert was already regarded as a saint.&lt;ref&gt;Lexicon, 112-113; Bonner et al, xxi-xxii, and 105&lt;/ref&gt;

In 875 the monks evacuated the abbey with the coffin, in anticipation of the [[Great Heathen Army]] moving into the area.  For seven years they carried it with them to various places in modern Scotland and Northumbria before settling it in the still existing [[St Mary and St Cuthbert, Chester-le-Street|St Cuthbert's church]] in [[Chester-le-Street]] until 995, when another Danish invasion led to its removal to [[Ripon]]. It was at Chester-le-Street that King Athelstan visited it, and the textiles were placed inside.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 28&lt;/ref&gt;  Travelling once again, the cart with the coffin became stuck at [[Durham, England|Durham]], which was taken as a sign that the saint wished to remain there.  A new stone church—the so-called 'White Church'—was built, the predecessor of the present grand cathedral.  The body was moved within the cathedral at various points; perhaps in 1041, in 1069 to escape the [[Harrying of the North]] by [[William the Conqueror]],{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} in 1104 when the Norman cathedral was constructed, and in 1541 when the medieval shrine which was one of the principal English pilgrimage sites was destroyed during the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lexicon, 112-113; Bonner et al, xxi-xxii&lt;/ref&gt;  The coffin was opened at various times during this period: one mid-10th century monk was in the habit of often combing the hair of the saint, and was also responsible for placing the purloined bones of Bede in the coffin.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, 28-29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827 the coffin was once again removed, having been found in a walled space at the site of the shrine.  By then there were up to four layers of coffin in fragmentary condition, taken to date from 1541, 1041, 698 and 687, housing a complete skeleton, and other human remains, though many of the contents had been removed earlier. The textiles were removed in 1827.  The human remains were reburied in a new coffin under a plain inscribed slab, with the remains of the old coffins, which were removed in yet another opening of the burial in 1899.  These totalled some 6,000, of which 169 showed signs of having been carved or engraved.  The art-historian [[Ernst Kitzinger]], then with the [[British Museum]], made a reconstruction of the carved oak sections in 1939, which has subsequently been slightly re-arranged.&lt;ref&gt;Cronyn &amp; Horie, 247&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstructed coffin and most of the contents are on now view in the Cathedral Museum; the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] has been often on display in London since the 1970s, but following its purchase for the nation in 2012, will in future be also displayed for equal periods in Durham or elsewhere in the North-East.

==Engraving and contents==
From the several thousand fragments collected in 1899 the art historian [[Ernst Kitzinger]] pieced together in 1939 a selection of 169 to make the fragmentary montages of the 7th century coffin now exhibited in the museum in Durham Cathedral, with engraved figures of Christ&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/myths_legends/england/wear/img/p1_body.jpg image]&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by four [[Evangelists' symbols]] on the lid, on one end the earliest surviving iconic representation of the [[Virgin and Child]] outside Rome from the medieval art of the Western Church,&lt;ref&gt;As opposed to their inclusion in scenes of the Nativity or ''Adoration of the Magi''. There is at least one Virgin and Child, with another figure, in the [[Catacombs of Rome]]. There is a group of icons in Roman churches, some of which are probably older.&lt;/ref&gt; with the archangels Michael and Gabriel on the other.  The sides show the [[Twelve Apostles]] and five archangels.&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;

The coffin also contained the Stonyhurst or [[Saint Cuthbert Gospel]] (now [[British Library]]) and the best surviving examples of Anglo-Saxon embroidery or ''[[opus Anglicanum]]'', a [[stole (vestment)|stole]] and [[maniple (vestment)|maniple]] which were probably added in the 930s, and given by [[King Athelstan]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 154-155; Brown, 28; see also the articles at pp. 303-366 in Bonner et al.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other probable possessions of Cuthbert found inside are an ivory comb, a portable altar, and a [[pectoral cross]] with gold and garnet [[cloisonné]], a rare and important early example of Christian Anglo-Saxon jewellery.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 49-50, [http://www.cushnieent.force9.co.uk/WebSitePhotoGallery/cuthbertcross.htm Image of pectoral cross]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inscriptions==
The runic inscription reads:
:''ihs xps mat(t)[h](eus)''
The ''ma'' and possibly the ''eu'' are [[bind rune]]s. The ''t'' is inverted. Then follows:
:''marcus''
The ''ma'' is again a bind rune, then:
:''LVCAS''
In Latin letters, followed by runic:
:''iohann(i)s''
Followed by Latin:
:''(RAPH)AEL (M)A(RIA)''

The names of Matthew, Mark and John are thus in runes, while that of Luke is in Latin letters. The [[Christogram]] is notably in runic writing, ''ihs xps'' ᛁᚻᛋ ᛉᛈᛋ, with the ''h'' double-barred in the continental style, the first attestation of that variant in England. The monogram reflects a runic variant of a partly Latinized ''XPS'' from Greek ''ΧΡΙϹΤΟϹ'', with the [[Ρ|rho]] rendered as runic ''p'' and the ''eolc'' rune (the old [[Algiz]] rune ''z'') used to render [[Chi (letter)|chi]]. It is difficult to account for the mixture of scripts, or find significance in which parts are in which script, but it can be said that such mixtures are not uncommon among inscriptions of the period from northern England, including the [[Franks Casket]] and stones from Lindisfarne and [[Monkwearmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;Page, 264-265&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sylvia Beatrice Anderson'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/afcVTCbrp2hvKroG7T88JU8L35M/appointments Profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322023156/https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/officers/afcVTCbrp2hvKroG7T88JU8L35M/appointments |date=22 March 2016 }}, companieshouse.gov.uk; accessed 18 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; (née '''Thomas'''; 25 March 1927 – 15 March 2016) was an English television and film producer, writer, voice actress and costume designer, best known for her collaborations with [[Gerry Anderson]], her husband between 1960 and 1981.&lt;ref name="Space1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space1999.net/catacombs/main/crguide/vcpsa.html |title=Sylvia Anderson Biography |last= |first= |date= |publisher=Space1999.net |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Ch2xwnKe?url=http://www.space1999.net/catacombs/main/crguide/vcpsa.html |archivedate=5 December 2012 |deadurl=No}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to serving as co-creator and co-writer on their TV series during the 1960s and early 1970s, Anderson's primary contribution was character development and [[costume design]].&lt;ref name=Express/&gt; She regularly directed the bi-weekly voice recording sessions, and provided the voices of many female and child characters, in particular the creation of [[Lady Penelope]] and Parker in ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''.

==Early life==
Anderson was born in [[Camberwell]], [[London]], England,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160405022124/http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=sylvia&amp;lastname=thomas&amp;mothersmaidenname=aberdeen]&lt;/ref&gt; on 25 March 1927. Her father, Sidney Thomas, was a champion boxer, and her mother, Beatrice (née Aberdeen), a dressmaker.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/16/thunderbirds-sylvia-anderson-voice-of-lady-penelope-dies-aged-88|title=Thunderbirds' Sylvia Anderson, voice of Lady Penelope, dies aged 88|last=Association|first=Press|date=16 March 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from the [[London School of Economics]]&lt;ref name=Express/&gt; with a degree in sociology and political science, she became a [[social work]]er. She emigrated to the United States to live with her first husband, an American golfer.&lt;ref name="Space1999"/&gt; Whilst in America she worked as a journalist.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-35818530|title=Sylvia Anderson, voice of Thunderbirds' Lady Penelope, dies|website=BBC News|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Anderson returned to the United Kingdom in 1955 with her daughter.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; She joined the newly founded and short-lived Polytechnic Films as an office assistant in 1957.&lt;ref name="Express"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Space1999"/&gt; There, she met [[Gerry Anderson]], an editor and director.&lt;ref name="Space1999"/&gt; That year, when Anderson and [[Arthur Provis]] created [[AP Films]] following Polytechnic's collapse, she joined them on the board of directors of the new company, alongside their colleagues [[John Read (producer)|John Read]] and [[Reg Hill]].&lt;ref name="Express"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Space1999"/&gt;

===Collaboration with Gerry Anderson===
In 1957 [[AP Films]] was commissioned by writer [[Roberta Leigh]] to produce films based on her children's stories, including ''[[The Adventures of Twizzle]]'' and ''[[Torchy the Battery Boy]]''.&lt;ref name="Hayward2016"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hayward|first=Anthony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/16/sylvia-anderson-obituary-thunderbirds-co-creator|title=Sylvia Anderson obituary|work=The Guardian|date=16 March 2016|access-date=18 November 2018|language=en-gb|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvia Anderson worked on these projects as a production assistant.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; In late 1960 the couple married,&lt;ref&gt;England and Wales Civil Marriages Register Q4 1960, Westminster, Ref: 5c/679&lt;/ref&gt; and she developed a wider role in production duties.&lt;ref name="Express"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Space1999"/&gt;

The couple worked together as a team, co-writing and co-creating the first episode of a series then sharing the work according to their strengths. Gerry tended to specialise in special effects and hardware, and Sylvia in character, voices, costume, dialogue, and plotlines.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fanderson.org.uk/prodguides/prodind.html |title=The Gerry Anderson Production Index |website=www.fanderson.org.uk |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/sylvia-anderson-pioneering-producer-and-writer-who-with-her-husband-gerry-anderson-found-lasting-a6935391.html |title=Sylvia Anderson: Producer and writer who found fame with Thunderbirds |website=The Independent |language=en-GB |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way, Anderson contributed plot development and voice work for a series of half-hour shows including ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]'' and ''[[Fireball XL5]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/being-lady-penelope-thunderbirds-co-creator-sylvia-anderson-looks-back-on-her-extraordinary-life-8914024.html|title=Being Lady Penelope: Thunderbirds co-creator Sylvia Anderson looks|website=The Independent|language=en-GB|accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she felt the half-hour format was insufficient to fully develop characters and stories, and she persuaded the team's TV producer [[Lew Grade, Baron Grade|Lew Grade]] to extend their shows to a full hour.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

In the early 1960s, the Andersons co-created the series ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', and Sylvia created the characters. She was aware that Grade intended to sell the show to American TV networks and wanted to make the show appealing to American audiences, hence she introduced the "British aristocrat" character of [[Lady Penelope]], and Parker her "Cockney chauffeur".&lt;ref name="Hayward2016"/&gt;

Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward, an aristocratic fashionista who was an undercover agent, was to become one of her most popular characters; Anderson both created the character and provided her voice.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; AP&amp;nbsp;Films puppet designer Mary Turner used Anderson as the template for the creation of the Lady Penelope puppets, a decision of which Anderson was not immediately aware. Interviewed by the&amp;nbsp;''Daily Mirror'' in 1968, Turner commented: "we wanted a glamorous blonde and [Anderson] was the obvious choice."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book |title=Yes, M'Lady |last=Anderson |first=Sylvia |publisher=Smith Gryphon |year=1991 |isbn=978-1-856850-11-7 |location=London |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 and 1968, Anderson produced two feature-length films based on the ''Thunderbirds'' story, ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]'' and ''[[Thunderbird 6]]''.&lt;ref name="Hayward2016"/&gt;

She was co-creator with Gerry Anderson for the series ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' (1969-1970) on which she co-produced, was responsible for fashions on the show, and did the majority of the casting.

The Andersons' creative partnership ended when their marriage broke down during the production of the [[List of Space: 1999 episodes#Year One (1975–1976)|first series]] of ''[[Space: 1999]]'' in 1975.&lt;ref name="Space1999"/&gt; Gerry announced his intention to separate on the evening of the [[wrap party]],&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GAbio-171"&gt;{{cite book |authors=Simon Archer, [[Stan Nicholls]] |title=Gerry Anderson: the Authorised Biography |year=1996 |publisher=[[Legend Books]] |page=171 |isbn=0-09-978141-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; following which Sylvia ceased her involvement with the company, which by this time had twice been renamed and was now called Group Three.

===Talent scout and writing===
In 1983 she published a novel titled ''Love and Hisses''&lt;ref name="Space1999"/&gt; and in 1994 she reprised her voice role as Lady Penelope for an episode of ''[[Absolutely Fabulous]]''. She worked as a London-based talent scout for [[HBO]] for 30&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref name=Express/&gt;&lt;ref name="Space1999"/&gt;

Her autobiography, ''Yes M'Lady'', was first published in 1991;&lt;ref name="SAbio"&gt;{{cite book |title=Yes M'Lady |publisher=Smith Gryphon |year=1991 |isbn=1-85685-011-0 |author=Sylvia Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007, it was re-published as ''My FAB Years''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sylvia Anderson |title=My FAB Years |year=2007 |publisher=Hermes Press |isbn=1-932563-91-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; with new material to bring it up to date with the latest developments in her life, such as her role as a production consultant for the [[Thunderbirds (2004 film)|2004 live-action film adaptation]] of ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]''.

Of the film, Anderson commented, "I'm personally thrilled that the production team have paid us the great compliment of bringing to life our original concept for the big screen. If we had made it ourselves (and we have had over 30&amp;nbsp;years to do it!) we could not have improved on this new version. It is a great tribute to the original creative team who inspired the movie all those years ago. It was a personal thrill for me to see my characters come to life on the big screen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sylviaanderson.org.uk/html/movie.html|title=''Thunderbirds'': The Movie |publisher=SylviaAnderson.org.uk |accessdate=24 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722183855/http://www.sylviaanderson.org.uk/html/movie.html |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''My FAB Years'' was re-released as a spoken CD, narrated by Anderson, in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sylviaanderson.org.uk/html/my_fab_years_audiobook.html |title=''My FAB Years'' – the Audiobook |publisher=SylviaAnderson.org.uk |accessdate=24 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722184024/http://www.sylviaanderson.org.uk/html/my_fab_years_audiobook.html |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/My-FAB-Years/dp/B00355ARE6 |title=''My FAB Years'' |edition=abridged |series=Audible Audio |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late career and charity work===
In 2013, Anderson worked with her daughter Dee, a [[jazz]] singer, on a concept for a new TV series&lt;ref name=Express/&gt; named ''The Last Station''. They set up a crowdfunding campaign on [http://igg.me/at/the-last-station-tv-series Indiegogo] for followers to contribute and be a part of the series.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 2015, Anderson briefly returned to the ''Thunderbirds'' universe, when she guest-starred in an episode of the reboot TV series, ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go (TV series)|Thunderbirds Are Go]]'', as Great Aunt Sylvia, a relative of Lady Penelope.

Anderson was also known for her charity work, particularly in support of [[Breast Cancer Care]]&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and [[Barnardo's]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://glotime.tv/sylvia-anderson-leads-safety-campaign-families-jackloc |title=Sylvia Anderson Leads Safety Campaign |website=GloTIME|accessdate=16 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502094339/http://glotime.tv/sylvia-anderson-leads-safety-campaign-families-jackloc/ |archivedate=2 May 2016 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition===
In 1966, ''Thunderbirds'' received the [[Royal Television Society]] Silver Medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/9767345/Gerry-Anderson-creator-of-Thunderbirds-Fireball-XL5-and-Captain-Scarlet.html?frame=2437446 |title=Gerry Anderson, creator of Thunderbirds, Fireball XL5 and Captain Scarlet |website=Telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Anderson travelled to Italy to receive a [[Pulcinella Award]] in recognition of her career in television production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studiohari.com/news/the-owl-co-awarded-at-venice?lang=fr |title="La Chouette &amp; cie" récompensée à Venise |series=News |website= Studio Hari, www.studiohari.com |accessdate=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sylviaanderson.org.uk/sylvia-anderson-presented-with-the-special-pulcinella-award/ |title=Sylvia Anderson presented with the Special Pulcinella Award |website=Sylvia Anderson |accessdate=16 March 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318145432/http://www.sylviaanderson.org.uk/sylvia-anderson-presented-with-the-special-pulcinella-award/ |archivedate=18 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and death==
Anderson married Jack Brooks in 1946 with whom she had a daughter, Dee. She remarried in 1952 to George Thamm, which also resulted in divorce. She married for a third time in 1960 to Gerry Anderson, with whom she had a son, Gerry Anderson Jr before divorcing in 1980.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/16/sylvia-anderson-obituary-thunderbirds-co-creator Obituary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105061349/http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/16/sylvia-anderson-obituary-thunderbirds-co-creator |date=5 November 2016 }}, theguardian.com; accessed 19 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 March 2016 (twelve days before her 89th birthday), Anderson died.&lt;ref name="Hayward2016"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13980">In [[mathematics]], the '''symmetry of second derivatives''' (also called the '''equality of mixed partials''') refers to the possibility under certain conditions (see below) of interchanging the order of taking [[partial derivative]]s of a function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x_{1},x_{2}, \dots ,x_{n})&lt;/math&gt;

of ''n'' variables. If the partial derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;x_{i}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted with a subscript &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, then the symmetry is the assertion that the second-order partial derivatives &lt;math&gt;f_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; satisfy the identity

:&lt;math&gt;f_{ij}=f_{ji}&lt;/math&gt;

so that they form an ''n'' × ''n'' [[symmetric matrix]]. This is sometimes known as '''Schwarz's theorem''', '''Clairaut's theorem''', or '''Young's theorem'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://are.berkeley.edu/courses/ARE210/fall2005/lecture_notes/Young%27s-Theorem.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060518134739/http://are.berkeley.edu/courses/ARE210/fall2005/lecture_notes/Young%27s-Theorem.pdf |archivedate=May 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Allen |first=R. G. D. |title=Mathematical Analysis for Economists |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1964 |isbn= |pages=300–305 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fgm9O6reUcsC&amp;pg=PA300 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of [[partial differential equation]]s it is called the
'''Schwarz [[integrability conditions for differential systems|integrability]] condition'''. &lt;!-- In physics, however, it is important
for the understanding of many phenomena in nature to remove this restrictions and allow functions to violate the
Schwarz integrability criterion, which makes them multivalued.
The simplest example is the function
&lt;math&gt;\arctan\; y/x&lt;/math&gt;. At first one defines this with a cut
in the complex
&lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;-plane running from 0 to infinity.
The cut makes the function single-valued. In complex analysis, however, one thinks of this function as having several 'sheets' (forming a [[Riemann surface]]).
 It is useless until they explain where and how the function violates Schwarz integrability condition --&gt;

== Hessian matrix ==

This matrix of second-order partial derivatives of ''f'' is called the '''[[Hessian matrix]]''' of ''f''. The entries in it off the [[main diagonal]] are the '''mixed derivatives'''; that is, successive partial derivatives with respect to different variables.

In most "real-life" circumstances the Hessian matrix is [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]], although there are a great number of functions that do not have this property. [[Mathematical analysis]] reveals that symmetry requires a hypothesis on ''f'' that goes further than simply stating the existence of the second derivatives at a particular point. [[#Schwarz's theorem|Schwarz' theorem]] gives a sufficient condition on ''f'' for this to occur.

== Formal expressions of symmetry ==
In symbols, the symmetry says that, for example,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {\partial}{\partial x} \left( \frac { \partial f }{ \partial y} \right) =
       \frac {\partial}{\partial y} \left( \frac { \partial f }{ \partial x} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

This equality can also be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{xy} f = \partial_{yx} f.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the symmetry can be written as an algebraic statement involving the [[differential operator]] ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; which  takes the partial derivative with respect to ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; . ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; . ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;.

From this relation it follows that the [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] of differential operators with [[constant coefficients]], generated by the ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, is [[commutative]]. But one should naturally specify some domain for these operators. It is easy to check the symmetry as applied to [[monomial]]s, so that one can take [[polynomial]]s in the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; as a domain. In fact [[smooth function]]s are possible.

== Schwarz's theorem&lt;!--'Schwarz's theorem' and 'Clairaut's theorem on equality of mixed partials' redirect here--&gt; ==
In [[mathematical]] [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], '''Schwarz's theorem'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (or '''Clairaut's theorem on equality of mixed partials'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=James |first=R. C. |year=1966 |title=Advanced Calculus |location=Belmont, CA |publisher=Wadsworth |isbn= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5kpAQAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Alexis Clairaut]] and [[Hermann Schwarz]], states that if

:&lt;math&gt;f \colon \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;

has [[continuous function|continuous]] second [[partial derivatives]] at a given point in &lt;math&gt; \mathbb{R}^n &lt;/math&gt;, say, &lt;math&gt; (a_1, \dots, a_n),&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\forall i, j \in \{ 1,2,\ldots, n\},&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_i\, \partial x_j}(a_1, \dots, a_n) = \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x_j\, \partial x_i}(a_1, \dots, a_n).&lt;/math&gt;

The partial differentiations of this function are [[commutative operation|commutative]] at that point. One easy way to establish this theorem (in the case where &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;i = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;j = 2&lt;/math&gt;, which readily entails the result in general) is by applying [[Green's theorem]] to the [[gradient]] of &lt;math&gt;f.&lt;/math&gt;

== Sufficiency of twice-differentiability ==
A weaker condition than the continuity of second partial derivatives (which is implied by the latter) which suffices to ensure symmetry is that all partial derivatives are themselves [[Differentiable function#Differentiability in higher dimensions|differentiable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=John|last2=Hubbard|first2=Barbara|title=Vector Calculus, Linear Algebra and Differential Forms|publisher=Matrix Editions|pages=732–733|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strengthening of the theorem, in which ''existence'' of the permuted mixed partial is asserted, was provided by Peano:

''If &lt;math&gt;f:E\to \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined on an open set &lt;math&gt;E\subset \R^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_1f, D_2f, D_{2,1}f&lt;/math&gt; exist everywhere on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; , and &lt;math&gt;D_{2,1}f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\in E&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;D_{1,2}f&lt;/math&gt; exists at &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_{1,2}f(a,b)=D_{2,1}f(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=0-07-054235-X|location=New York|pages=235-236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The result of the equality of the mixed partial derivatives under certain conditions has a long history.  [[Nicolaus I Bernoulli]] implicitly assumed the result as early as 1721, but [[Euler]] was the first to provide a proof.  Other proofs followed by [[Alexis Clairaut|Clairaut]] (1740), [[Lagrange]] (1797), [[Cauchy]] (1823) and many others in the 19th century.  None of these proofs were without fault however (for example, Clairaut assumed all definite integrals could be differentiated under the integral sign).  In 1867 [[Ernst Leonard Lindelöf]] published a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lindelöf|first1=Ernst Leonard|title=Remarques sur les différentes manières d'établir la formule &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 z}{d xd y} = \frac{d^2 z}{d yd x}&lt;/math&gt;|journal=Acta Societatis Scientiarum Fennicae|date=1867|volume=8, part 1|pages=205–213|url=https://archive.org/stream/actasocietatissc81suom#page/205/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing in detail all the proofs he was familiar with.  Finally, six years later [[Hermann Schwarz]] (1873) gave the first satisfactory proof. This was followed by successive refinements that relaxed the hypotheses in Schwarz's theorem in various ways, among others by [[Ulisse Dini|Dini]], [[Camille Jordan|Jordan]], [[Peano]], [[E. W. Hobson]], [[W. H. Young]]. For a good historical account, see.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Higgins|first1=Thomas James|title=A note on the history of mixed partial derivatives|journal=Scripta Mathematica|date=1940|volume=7|pages=59–62|url=http://mathforum.org/kb/thread.jspa?forumID=13&amp;threadID=1580215&amp;messageID=5765194|accessdate=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distribution theory formulation ==

The theory of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] (generalized functions) eliminates analytic problems with the symmetry. The derivative of an [[integrable]] function can always be defined as a distribution, and symmetry of mixed partial derivatives always holds as an equality of distributions. The use of formal [[integration by parts]] to define differentiation of distributions puts the symmetry question back onto the [[test function]]s, which are smooth and certainly satisfy this symmetry. In more detail (where ''f'' is a distribution, written as an operator on test functions, and ''φ'' is a test function),
: &lt;math&gt; (D_1D_2f)[\phi] = -(D_2f)[D_1\phi] = f[D_2D_1\phi] = f[D_1D_2\phi] = -(D_1f)[D_2\phi] = (D_2D_1f)[\phi] .&lt;/math&gt;

Another approach, which defines the [[Fourier transform]] of a function, is to note that on such transforms partial derivatives become multiplication operators that commute much more obviously.

== Requirement of continuity ==
The symmetry may be broken if the function fails to have differentiable partial derivatives, which is possible if Clairaut's theorem is not satisfied (the second partial derivatives are not [[Continuous function|continuous]]).

[[File:Graph001.png|thumb|right|The function ''f(x,y)'', as shown in equation ({{EquationNote|1}}), does not have symmetric second derivatives at its origin.]]
An example of non-symmetry is the function
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = \begin{cases}
                     \frac{xy(x^2 - y^2)}{x^2+y^2} &amp; \mbox{ for } (x, y) \ne (0, 0)\\
                      0                            &amp; \mbox{ for } (x, y) = (0, 0).
                \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
This function is everywhere continuous, but its derivatives at (0,0) cannot be computed algebraically. Rather, the limit of difference quotients shows that &lt;math&gt;\partial_x f|_{(0,0)}=\partial_y f|_{(0,0)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, so the graph z = f(x,y) has a horizontal tangent plane at (0,0), and the partial derivatives &lt;math&gt;\partial_x f, \partial_y f&lt;/math&gt; exist and are everywhere continuous. However, the second partial derivatives are not continuous at (0,0), and the symmetry fails. In fact, along the ''x''-axis the ''y''-derivative is &lt;math&gt;\partial_y f|_{(x,0)}=x&lt;/math&gt;, and so:
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_x\partial_y f|_{(0,0)} =
\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0} \frac { \partial_y f|_{(\epsilon,0)}-\partial_y f|_{(0,0)} } \epsilon = 1.&lt;/math&gt;
In contrast, along the ''y''-axis the ''x''-derivative &lt;math&gt;\partial_x f|_{(0,y)}=-y&lt;/math&gt;,
and so &lt;math&gt;\partial_y\partial_x f|_{(0,0)} = -1&lt;/math&gt;.
That is, &lt;math&gt;\partial_{xy}f\ne\partial_{yx}f&lt;/math&gt; at (0,&amp;nbsp;0), although the mixed partial derivatives do exist, and at every other point the symmetry does hold.

The above function, written in a cylindrical coordinate system, can be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;f(r, \theta) = \frac{r^2 \sin{4\theta}}{4},&lt;/math&gt;
showing that the function oscillates four times when traveling once around an arbitrarily small loop containing the origin. Intuitively, therefore, the local behavior of the function at &lt;math&gt;(0, 0)&lt;/math&gt; cannot be described as a quadratic form, and the Hessian matrix thus fails to be symmetric.

In general, the [[interchange of limiting operations]] need not [[Commutative property|commute]]. Given two variables near (0,&amp;nbsp;0) and two limiting processes on
:&lt;math&gt;f(h,k) - f(h,0) - f(0,k) + f(0,0)&lt;/math&gt;
corresponding to making ''h'' → 0 first, and to making ''k'' → 0 first. It can matter, looking at the first-order terms, which is applied first. This leads to the construction of [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] examples in which second derivatives are non-symmetric. This kind of example belongs to the theory of [[real analysis]] where the pointwise value of functions matters.  When viewed as a distribution the second partial derivative's values can be changed at an arbitrary set of points as long as this has Lebesgue measure 0. Since in the example the Hessian is symmetric everywhere except (0,0), there is no contradiction with the fact that the Hessian, viewed as a [[Schwartz distribution]], is symmetric.

== In Lie theory ==
Consider the first-order differential operators ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be [[infinitesimal operator]]s on [[Euclidean space]]. That is, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; in a sense generates the [[one-parameter group]] of [[translation]]s parallel to the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;-axis. These groups commute with each other, and therefore the [[Lie group#The Lie algebra associated to a Lie group|infinitesimal generators]] do also; the [[Lie bracket]]

:[''D''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''D''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;] = 0

is this property's  reflection. In other words, the Lie derivative of one coordinate with respect to another is zero.

== Application to differential forms ==
The Clairaut-Schwarz theorem is the key fact needed to prove that for every &lt;math&gt;C^\infty&lt;/math&gt;(or at least twice continuously differentiable) [[differential form]] &lt;math&gt;\omega\in\Omega^k(M)&lt;/math&gt;, the second exterior derivative vanishes: &lt;math&gt;d^2\omega:=d(d\omega)=0&lt;/math&gt;.  This implies that every [[Exact differential form|exact]] form (i.e., a form &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\alpha=d\omega&lt;/math&gt; for some form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;) is [[Closed differential form|closed]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt;d\alpha=0&lt;/math&gt;), since &lt;math&gt;d\alpha=d(d\omega)=0&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/TuL.W.AnIntroductionToManifolds2e2010Springer|title=An Introduction to Manifolds|last=Tu|first=Loring W.|publisher=Springer|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4419-7399-3|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Democratic Paradox''''' is a collection of essays by the Belgian [[political theory|political theorist]] [[Chantal Mouffe]], published in 2000 by [[Verso Books]]. The essays offer further discussion of the concept of [[radical democracy]] that Mouffe explored in ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]'', co-authored by [[Ernesto Laclau]]. In this collection, Mouffe deals with the specific conflicts between the [[post-Marxist]] democratic theory that she and Laclau theorized in ''Hegemony and Socialist Strategy'' and the competing democratic theories proposed by [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[John Rawls]]. Verso's UK blog characterizes ''The Democratic Paradox'' as Mouffe's most accessible review of her perspectives on radical democracy.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://versouk.wordpress.com/2009/07/17/radical-thinkers-question-10-chantal-mouffe-%E2%80%98the-democratic-paradox%E2%80%99/ Radical Thinkers Question 10: CHANTAL MOUFFE 'The Democratic Paradox']'' Verso UK blog, July 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The eponymous paradox of democracy that this collection of essays deals with is the internal conflict within modern democracy that is created by the union of two separate strands of political thought: the tradition of [[classical liberalism]] and the tradition of [[Democracy|democratic theory]], forming the institution of [[liberal democracy]]. {{Quotation|We are dealing with a new political form of society whose specificity comes from the articulation between two different traditions. On one side we have the liberal tradition constituted by the rule of law, the defence of human rights and the respect of individual liberty; on the other the democratic tradition whose main ideas are those of equality, identity between governing and governed and popular sovereignty. There is no necessary relation between those two distinct traditions but only a contingent historical articulation....Let's not forget that, while we tend today to take the link between liberalism and democracy for granted, their union, far from being a smooth process, was the result of bitter struggles.| Mouffe, ''The Democratic Paradox'', pp. 2-3&lt;ref&gt;Mouffe, C. (2000). ''The Democratic Paradox''. New York, NY: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mouffe sees Radical Democracy as a means for continuing to sustain the balance between the values of liberalism and democracy. This balance is accomplished through the [[agonism|agonistic]] practice of valuing and sustaining dissent in the democratic process as a more important goal than [[consensus]]. This point is where ''Radical Democratic'' theory diverges from both Habermas and Rawls, as it contradicts Habermas's quest for [[communicative rationality|rational consensus]] and Rawls's project for [[political liberalism]]. Mouffe describes the importance of the radical democratic alternative in a 2009 interview, saying that "The aim of a pluralist democracy is to provide the institutions that will allow them to take an agonistic form, in which opponents will treat each other not as enemies to be destroyed, but as adversaries who will fight for the victory of their position while recognising the right of their opponents to fight for theirs. An agonistic democracy requires the availability of a choice between real alternatives."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/11/agonistic-democracy-bnp-post The Books Interview: Chantal Mouffe]''.

'''''The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas That Have Shaped Our World View''''' is a 1991 book by [[cultural historian]] [[Richard Tarnas]].

==Summary==
Tarnas argues that the movement from the Greek and Christian world views, through modernity and to [[postmodernism]] can be seen as a natural and [[dialectical]] unfolding of a [[collective mind]] or [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]].&lt;ref&gt;Sean Kelly, ''Coming Home'' [np] SteinerBooks&lt;/ref&gt; Tarnas outlines the intellectual-cultural development of the modern [[world view]] from its origins in [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Judeo-Christian|Judaeo-Christian]] [[mythology|mythologies]]. He then argues that with the advent of postmodernism, the modern world is in a serious [[spiritual crisis]], which manifests as the global [[ecological crisis]]. He proposes that a potential resolution, which he calls ''the [[participatory theory|participatory framework]]'', has also been in development in the West for centuries.

Tarnas first describes the ancient world view, in which the self is undifferentiated from the [[anima mundi|world-soul]] in a ''[[participation mystique]]''. The rise of the great [[monotheistic religion]]s began with the [[Axial age]] in the sixth century BCE. In monotheistic religion, god is [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]. The cosmos became a de-sacralized object, which is no longer imbued with divinity and meaning. Mankind began to see the world as an [[objective reality]] which can be studied by science and manipulated with technology. The human subject, on the other hand, became empowered, liberated, and autonomous.

With the [[Scientific Revolution]], and subsequent [[secularization]] of Europe, the overwhelming success of science and technology eroded belief in the existence of the transcendent god. Eventually, mankind became [[disenchantment|disenchanted]] with and alienated from the world. 20th century man tended to find spirituality in modern psychology rather than in traditional religion. Finally, in [[Postmodernism|postmodern thought]], meaning is seen as projected onto or [[Constructivist epistemology|constructed]] in an empty, meaningless world.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus the modern condition begins as a Promethean movement toward human freedom, toward autonomy from the encompassing matrix of nature, toward individuation from the collective, yet gradually and ineluctably the Cartesian-Kantian condition evolves into a Kafka-Beckett-like state of existential isolation and absurdity--an intolerable double bind leading to a kind of deconstructive frenzy.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tarnas, "Epilogue", ''The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View''[http://www.gaiamind.org/Tarnas.html gaiamind.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The contemporary world of postmodern thought, according to Tarnas, is caught "between the inner craving for a life of meaning and the relentless attrition of existence in a cosmos that our rational scientific world view has assured us is empty, dead, devoid of all purpose."&lt;ref&gt;
Bob Craft, untitled review of ''The Passion of the Western Mind'', ''Quest'' Summer 1992 [http://www.theosophical.org/publications/BookReviews/1992.php#pw theosophical.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The great irony suggested here of course is that it is just when the modern mind believes it has most fully purified itself from any anthropomorphic projections, when it actively construes the world as unconscious, mechanistic, and impersonal, it is just then that the world is most completely a selective construct of the human mind. The human mind has abstracted from the whole all conscious intelligence and purpose and meaning, and claimed these exclusively for itself, and then projected onto the world a machine. As Rupert Sheldrake has pointed out, this is the ultimate anthropomorphic projection: a man-made machine, something not in fact ever found in nature. From this perspective, it is the modern mind's own impersonal soullessness that has been projected from within onto the world--or, to be more precise, that has been projectively elicited from the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Tarnas' proposed way out of this "[[Cartesian dualism|Cartesian]]-[[Kantian]] [[epistemological]] box"&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer, 143&lt;/ref&gt; involves a [[participatory epistemology]]: a [[theory of knowledge]] in which "human beings are regarded as an essential vehicle for the creative self-unfolding of reality."&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer, 155&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tarnas, the participatory framework takes into account the critical insights of [[modernism]] and [[postmodernism]], while repairing the ontological separateness of the psyche and the cosmos, which are, in the participatory framework, synthesized in a dialectical ''[[hieros gamos]]'', or sacred marriage.&lt;blockquote&gt;This participatory epistemology, developed in different ways by Goethe, Hegel, Steiner, and others, can be understood not as a regression to naive ''participation mystique'', but as the dialectical synthesis of the long evolution from the primordial undifferentiated consciousness through the dualistic alienation. It incorporates the postmodern understanding of knowledge and yet goes beyond it. The interpretive and constructive character of human cognition is fully acknowledged, but the intimate, interpenetrating and all-permeating relationship of nature to the human being and human mind allows the Kantian consequence of epistemological alienation to be entirely overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tarnas, "Epilogue", ''The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View''[http://www.gaiamind.org/Tarnas.html gaiamind.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
''The Passion of the Western Mind'' became a [[bestseller]], selling over 200,000 copies by 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Grasse, "Cosmos and Psyche: An Interview with Richard Tarnas" ''The Mountain Astrologer'', issue #124, Dec/Jan 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It "became a staple in some college curriculums".&lt;ref&gt;

| quote                 = When 'The Passion of the Western Mind' was published, it was hailed as a liberal education in one volume and became a staple in some college curriculums. For educators willing to overlook that a liberal education should probably consist of more than one volume, Mr. Tarnas's book provided an efficient survey of the Western worldview, especially of the scientific revolutions that helped shape it.

It gave Tarnas' work international respect&lt;ref&gt;Sean Kelly, ''Coming Home'' [np] SteinerBooks&lt;/ref&gt; and was hailed as an important work by [[Joseph Campbell]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Stanislav Grof]], [[John E. Mack]], [[Stanley Krippner]], [[Georg Feuerstein]], [[David Steindl-Rast]], [[John Sculley]], [[Robert A. McDermott]], [[Jeffrey Hart]], [[Gary Lachman]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmosandpsyche.com/ cosmosandpsyche.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacifica.edu/innerContentpp.aspx?id=1518 pacifica.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Christopher Bache]], ''Passion'' is "[w]idely regarded as one of the most discerning overviews of [[Western philosophy]] from the ancient Greeks to postmodern thought."&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Martin Bache, ''Dark night, early dawn: steps to a [[deep ecology]] of mind'', p22 [[SUNY]] Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0791446050}}, 9780791446058 [https://books.google.com/books?id=cEL8eWF-vHgC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=tarnas&amp;ei=Qo8eS5q8O4mCNL6cmM8I&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=tarnas&amp;f=false google.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Ferrer]] wrote that it contained a "devastating assault on the Cartesian-Kantian paradigm."&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer, 155&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 [[Nobel Prize|Nobel laureate]] [[Ilya Prigogine]] approvingly quoted Tarnas in a paper entitled "Science, Reason, and Passion". The paper discussed the idea that contemporary science appears to have started overcoming the duality which separates humans from nature.&lt;blockquote&gt;What can man do in a deterministic universe in which he is a stranger? This is the anxiety expressed in so many recent writings, like those of...Richard Tarnas, who writes "For the deepest passion of the Western mind has been to reunite with the ground of its being." I believe this is true, and that our period is indeed one of reunification, of a quest for unity&amp;mdash;witness the deep interest in nature shown by so many young people today, and man's growing sense of solidarity with all living beings.&lt;ref&gt;"science, Reason and Passion", ''Leonardo'' Vol. 29, No. 1 (1996), pp. 39-42 The MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his 2000 book ''Wandering God: A Study of Nomadic Spirituality'', [[cultural critic]] [[Morris Berman]] called ''The Passion of the Western Mind'': "a fairly decent summary of European [[intellectual history]], written in a lucid and accessible style". Berman then wrote that Tarnas "argues for a biological mysticism", and called Tarnas' theory [[escapism|escapist]], [[Regression (psychology)|regressive]], [[totalitarian]], and [[utopian]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris Berman, ''Wandering God: a study in nomadic spirituality'' SUNY Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0791444414}} p224 [https://books.google.com/books?id=PND77sMoFswC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=tarnas&amp;ei=dCYMS9N0gtYwgMvBrgE#v=onepage&amp;q=tarnas&amp;f=false google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In papers posted to the [[Shambhala Publications]] website in 2003, [[Ken Wilber]] called Tarnas a "[[boomeritis]] theorist", and criticized him for using [[Abraham Maslow]] as a "[[whipping boy]]",&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;(Maslow has been a favorite whipping boy of boomeritis theorists—e.g., Richard Tarnas, [[Jorge Ferrer]]—but he is, by any balanced assessment, one of the three or four greatest psychologists America has ever produced.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ken Wilber, "Excerpt D: The Look of a Feeling: The Importance of Post/Structuralism: Part IV. Conclusions of Adequate Structuralism (page 1)" [http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptD/part4-1.cfm shambhala.com]&lt;/ref&gt; for allegedly misusing [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s concept of the [[paradigm]],&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The way Kuhn used the term "paradigm," of course, has been badly misunderstood by the public and by most critics and appropriators of the term, who incorrectly use it to mean some sort of theory or super theory. [[Fritjof Capra]], [[Stan Grof]], [[Duane Elgin]], Richard Tarnas, [[Charlene Spretnak]]--the list is virtually endless--would say that a new holistic or ecological theory should replace the old atomistic, Newtonian-Cartesian worldview, and that would be a new paradigm. But that typically incorrect use has Kuhn exactly backward. "Paradigm," for Kuhn, does not mean the theory or the superstructure, but the base or social practice. Paradigm is an almost exact equivalent of techno-economic base, social practice, behavioral injunction, or exemplar.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ken Wilber, "Excerpt A: An Integral Age at the Leading Edge: Part III. The Nature of Revolutionary Social Transformation (page 1)"[http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/kosmos/excerptA/part3-1.cfm shambhala.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and for allegedly engaging in "[[hermeneutic]] violence" by using a [[metanarrative]] which denies [[hierarchical]] stages.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In other words, the denial of hierarchical stages is itself an invalid metanarrative. From Ferrer to Tarnas to Hickman to Delores to Beliot, you can see these invalid and inauthentic metanarratives parading as sensitive, caring, empathic resonances, whereas they are hermeneutic violence by any other name.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Ken Wilber, "Sidebar A: Who Ate [[Captain Cook]]? Integral [[Historiography]] in a Postmodern Age
[http://wilber.shambhala.com/html/books/boomeritis/cook/part2.cfm/ shambhala.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, contrary to one of Wilber's claims, Tarnas only mentions Maslow once in ''Passion'', and in a non-critical context.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0n2C299jeOMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=tarnas&amp;ei=Hj8VS4GZJozKNdbypcIL#v=onepage&amp;q=maslow&amp;f=false ''Passion'', p428]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=k35piIm2C90C&amp;dq=cosmos+and+psyche&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jYVKa8eOJt&amp;sig=iPLmagQhojlUFutMqgR6tqV0zBw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=w5EVS8uvA4_iNcTB6bgG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=maslow&amp;f=false google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2007 [[Jack Canfield]] book, ''You've got to read this book: 55 people tell the story of the book that changed their life'', [[Jim MacLaren]] described how he encountered ''Passion'' in a bookstore after recovering from an accident which had rendered him a [[quadriplegic]]. MacLaren wrote that ''Passion'' "triggered a desire to understand my own belief system and how it connected to the universal issues of being human". ''Passion'' inspired MacLaren to go to graduate school to study world religions, mythology, and depth psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Canfield, Gay Hendricks, Carol Kline, ''You've got to read this book: 55 people tell the story of the book that changed their life'' p.20-21 New York: Collins, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Plug-In Drug: Television, Children, And The Family''''' is a book of social criticism written by [[Marie Winn]] and published in 1977 by [[Viking Penguin]] with the {{ISBN|0140076980}}. In it, Winn brought the communications medium of [[television]] under withering fire, accusing it of wielding an addictive influence on the very young.

Wrote Winn: &lt;blockquote&gt; "The very nature of the television experience apart from the contents of the programs is rarely considered. Perhaps the ever-changing array of sights and sounds coming out of the machine--the wild variety of images meeting the eye and the barrage of human and inhuman sounds reaching the ear--fosters the illusion of a varied experience for the viewer. It is easy to overlook a deceptively simple fact: one is always ''watching television'' when one is watching television rather than having any other experience."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A 25th-anniversary revision was published in 2002, which included new material that was subtitled "Television, Computers, And Family Life". Winn was even more hostile to the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]] than she had been to television itself twenty-five years before.

'''''The Rules of Charity''''' is a 2005 play by the American [[playwright]] [[John Belluso]]. The play premiered on April 23, 2005 at the [[Magic Theatre]] in [[San Francisco]], California. It has since had an [[Off-Broadway]] run.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/theater/reviews/13rules.html?_r=0|title=A Caregiver Not in a Giving Mood|last=Genzlinger|first=Neil|date=2007-06-13|work=New York Times|accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play focuses on a man named Monty with [[cerebral palsy]] who uses a wheelchair, and whose adult daughter takes care of him.

[[John Belluso]] - whose contemporaries included the playwright [[Tony Kushner]] - used a wheelchair himself. His wheelchair use was a result of a bone disease called [[Camurati–Engelmann disease]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shinn |first=Christopher |url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/10/20/what-john-belluso-taught-me-about-disability-christopher-shinn/ |title=What John Belluso Taught Me About Disability, Generosity, and Life |publisher=American Theatre |date=2015-10-20 |accessdate=2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rules of Charity'', like most of Belluso's work, explores what it means to be [[Disability|disabled]] or [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] in modern American society. He was an advocate for writers, playwrights, and artists with disabilities&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/disabled-playwright-john-belluso-dies/|title=Disabled Playwright John Belluso Dies|last=Schou|first=Solvej|date=February 15, 2006|website=backstage|agency=Associated Press|access-date=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used his own personal experience to deepen and drive his own work. As a young playwright, Belluso worked with the [[New Dramatists]],&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newdramatists.org/who/alumni|title=Alumni Playwrights|last=|first=|date=2016|website=New Dramatists|publisher=New Dramatists|access-date=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting with his fellow playwrights of the time and making an impression during his unfortunately short career that impacted many.

The [[Dramatists Play Service]] version of the published script contains, next to the character descriptions and play setting, a poem by [[Wallace Stevens]] entitled ''A Postcard from the Volcano.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/43432|title=A Postcard from the Volcano|last=Stevens|first=Wallace|date=1990|website=Poetry Foundation|publisher=|access-date=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem speaks to the leaving behind of the experience of an older generation, a generation that suffered and that the younger generation will know nothing about.

This speaks to the themes of the play as a whole, as it focuses heavily on [[familial relationship]]s, and the younger generation being so preoccupied with their own problems that they cannot see the long-suffering of the older generation.

==Plot summary==
''The Rules of Charity'' focuses on a middle-aged man named Monty, and his daughter Loretta. Monty has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, and Loretta, a grown woman, cares for him. The play focuses around their relationship, the anger and resentment that lives within their connection, as well as the love between them. The play also focuses on how one navigates our world when one is an outsider, whether that is because of one's ability or disability, sexuality, religion, or social class.

Structurally, ''The Rules of Charity'' is in a standard two-act dramatic structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://playwriting.vcu.edu/structure.html|title=Structure of Two Act Plays|last=Toscan|first=Richard|date=2012|website=Playwrighting Seminars|publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University|access-date=August 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Act I taking place in the present day, and Act II taking place one year later. The play is also split up by named sections that divide up the action further, framed by a prologue and an epilogue.

=== Prologue: The Introduction of Cruelty ===
The play opens with Loretta at the end of her rope, in the apartment that she and her father share, having just slapped her father, knocking over his wheelchair. "Cruelty is a form of goodness", she tells him. Menacingly, but laced with the love that she has for her father, she tells him that she will only treat him with cruelty from that moment on.

=== Act One, Section 1: Apothetai (The Place of Exposure) ===
The next morning, Loretta and Monty are at home, things are normal again. LH, the superintendent of the building comes in with a bottle of scotch, celebrating his recent raise. Monty invites him to stay for dinner, and LH encourages Monty to try and leave his apartment in order to look for a job. Monty refuses, and it is revealed that Monty and LH are secret lovers. LH tells Monty that he has invited over the daughter of the building owner Paz, who is a documentary filmmaker. She wants to talk to Monty. Monty is unsure, but LH assures him that everything will be fine.

Later that evening, Loretta meets a dull man named Horace by a street corner. They flirt and he asks her out on a date, which she refuses.

The next morning, Paz arrives with LH at Monty and Loretta's apartment. Paz pitches her documentary to Monty - she wants to write about what she perceives as the enormous and dramatic struggle of the disabled. Monty is clearly far superior to her in intelligence, and does not take to her well. However, she offers him a large sum of money to be a part of her documentary, and so Monty promises LH that he will consider it. Monty and Loretta are left alone and share a brief moment of tenderness, it is also revealed that Loretta's mother, Monty's wife, is no longer living and that that day would have been her birthday.

Loretta returns to the street corner to invite Horace over to her apartment for dinner. Initially he is nervous about going to dinner, and says that he usually works until late at the fish factory. She promises him that she will give her father pills to fall asleep so that he can come over without Monty bothering them. He accepts, and she kisses him.

LH and Monty are alone, drinking in Loretta and Monty's apartment. They recount the tales of Greek Mythology that LH read about in books that Monty lent him. Monty describes to LH what the Apothetai was in ancient Greece - the place where disabled babies were left to die. LH is very moved, and asks Monty if he knew he was gay, even when he was married. Monty says that yes, he did. Loretta then enters and puts Monty to bed, giving him his pill that helps him sleep. Monty whispers to himself that he wants to go away with LH and let her live on her own, and in doing so, he throws himself from his bed and lands on the floor. Angry and exasperated, Loretta tells him that he can sleep on the floor.

=== Act One, Section 2: The Poor Laws ===
The following morning. Monty is sitting on the couch of his apartment while Paz prepares to begin shooting the documentary. LH and Loretta, one after the other, enter the apartment. They watch as Paz begins to interview Monty for the camera. Her questions offend Monty, as they obsess over what Paz determines to be the 'grotesque' aspect of Monty's disabled existence. She suggests that he ask her some questions in order to make them more comfortable around one another. When he is asking questions about her personal life, Paz reveals that she and LH are together. Monty did not know this and is blindsided. Unaware of Monty and LH's relationship, Paz continues to question Monty, pressing him on his sexuality and financial situation. Turning the questions once more back on her, Monty suggests to Paz that she make her film more about the overall concept of charity. He suggests that she structure her film around the origins of how disability caused societal isolation. She is disappointed, and when she once again asks to hear about his life story, he is enraged and asks her to leave his house. She does.

Once Paz leaves, Monty tells LH that he wants them to be together. LH responds saying that he doesn't want to be with Monty, both because he doesn't want to be gay and because he doesn't want to have to take care of him. LH breaks it off between them, leaving Monty in the apartment alone.

LH and Paz stand outside of the apartment building under a lamppost. LH has moved out of the building and is no longer the janitor there. He proposes marriage to Paz. She accepts.

Back in the apartment, Loretta has fed Monty four of his pills to make him sleep while she and Horace have dinner. They talk about their families and Loretta admits, while Horace sleeps, that she both loves and hates her father. Monty groggily hears her say all of this. Loretta and Horace exit to her bedroom to make love. Monty takes the pill bottle from his bedside table and slowly eats every pill.

=== Act Two, Section 3: The Baby, Or A Testimony of Dark Things ===
One year after the events of Act I, Loretta and Horace, and Monty are back in the apartment. Loretta has developed a habit of pretending to be pregnant by sticking a balloon under her shirt, but she tells Horace that they can't afford a real baby.

Later, on a street corner, Loretta, wearing the balloon as a fake pregnant belly, runs into Paz. Paz introduces herself by her real name, Joyce. She tells Loretta that she and LH (now known as Mr. Millicent) are married and are born-again Christians. Seemingly relieved to see Loretta, she asks if a publisher has published her father's journal. Loretta is surprised by this and answers that the journal is not published, that it is not even finished. Joyce offers Loretta money in exchange for her father's journal, for his story.

Back at the apartment, Loretta tries to convince Monty to give her his journal for money. He refuses, especially refusing to give his journal to LH. LH is seen desperately trying to read, but since he can't without Monty, he despairs. At the apartment once again, Horace comes home very drunk after having gotten in a bar fight. Loretta approaches him and tells him that they are going to pretend to be a happily married, pregnant couple in order to sell her father's journal to Joyce. She tells him that after they do so, he is going to leave the apartment and never come back, calling him a cripple who has made her life even worse.

=== Act Two, Section 4: Knot Stew ===
Loretta and Horace set up dinner at the apartment, nervous that everything will go well for the dinner with LH (now Mr. Millicent) where they will try to sell Monty's journal. Mr. Millicent arrives at dinner, appearing much changed from the last time Loretta, Horace, and Monty saw him. Monty arrives as well, and begins grilling Mr. Millicent on his latest reading material. Mr. Millicent has trouble keeping up with Monty, which makes Monty smug. Angry, Mr. Millicent reveals that he has come to dinner to ask for the pages in Monty's journal in which he wrote about their romantic relationship, claiming that those stories are lies. Loretta begs for charity, for money in exchange for the journal. Mr. Millicent declares that they are unworthy of charity and refuses Monty's journal, violently flipping over Monty's wheelchair in the process. In response, Horace slits Mr. Millicent's throat, killing him. He apologizes profusely as Mr. Millicent dies, with Monty and Loretta looking on.

=== Epilogue: The Swallows ===
Loretta and Monty sit on the floor, Loretta cradling Monty, who is hurt from his fall from his wheelchair. Horace has put Mr. Millicent's body in his car, and tells Loretta that he will drive away with it forever. He tells her to blame the murder all on him, and she agrees. Horace leaves, and Monty hands Loretta the last pages of his journal to read. She reads out loud the last passage from his journal, where he describes telling her, as a baby, that she will have to learn to swallow her pain. Monty dies in Loretta's arms. She smiles.

== Playwright ==
[[John Belluso]] (1969-2006) was a well-established young American playwright whose works focused on the life of people with disabilities in modern America, and how they navigated a world that was generally set against them. Belluso had [[Camurati–Engelmann disease|Camurati-Englemann Disease]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and used a wheelchair. He believed that disability created a perfect mindset for a person to have a yearning to make theatre - as someone who is often looked at and scrutinized by society, he felt that it was a natural feeling for a person to want to turn that mirror back on society, and he chose to do so by creating theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americantheatre.org/2015/10/20/what-john-belluso-taught-me-about-disability-christopher-shinn/|title=What John Belluso Taught Me About Disability, Generosity, and Life|last=Shinn|first=Christopher|date=2015-10-20|website=AMERICAN THEATRE|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rules of Charity'', like most of Belluso's work, explores what it means to be [[Disability|disabled]] or [[Social exclusion|marginalized]] in modern American society. Belluso was an [[advocate]] for writers, playwrights, and artists with disabilities,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and used his own personal experience to deepen and drive his own work.

As a young playwright, [[John Belluso]] worked with the [[New Dramatists]],&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; connecting with his fellow contemporary playwrights (for example, the playwright [[Tony Kushner]]) and making an impression during his unfortunately short career that impacted many.

'''''Ugolino and His Sons''''' is a marble sculpture of [[Ugolino della Gherardesca|Ugolino]] made by [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]] in Paris during the 1860s. It depicts the story of Ugolino from Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' in which the 13th century count is imprisoned and starving with his children. The work, known for its expressive detail, launched Carpeaux's career.&lt;ref name="Europe Age"/&gt;

== Description and style ==

The work is a highly expressive depiction of [[Ugolino della Gherardesca]] from Canto XXXIII of Dante's ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''. In the story, the Pisan count Ugolino is sentenced to die in a tower prison with his children and grandchildren. Carpeaux shows Ugolino at the moment where he considers cannibalism. The work is emblematic of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] style's heightened physical and emotional states.&lt;ref name="Europe Age"/&gt; Ugolino looks into the distance. His posture ignores the four children that cling to his body as if he were unaware they were there—the youngest is curled at his feet and possibly dead. In the source text, Ugolino grieves the agonizing death of his children and whether he eats his children's flesh is unclear to the reader, as it is in the sculpture.&lt;ref name="Weineck2014"/&gt; Ugolino's body is muscular even though he is starving. Its style reflects the Vatican's ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]''.&lt;ref name="Weineck2014"/&gt;

== Production ==
[[File:Laocoon and His Sons.jpg|thumb|''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'' (1st century BCE) compositionally influenced Carpeaux's ''Ugolino and His Sons'']]
Carpeaux won the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1854.&lt;ref name="Lombardi2009"/&gt; While in Rome, he stayed in the [[French Academy in Rome]]'s [[Villa Medici]] and studied the works of [[Michaelangelo]].&lt;ref name="Europe Age"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lombardi2009"/&gt; Carpeaux's Ugolino was prototyped on Michaelangelo's works from three centuries prior,&lt;ref name="Europe Age"/&gt; particular his ''Last Judgment'' panel of the [[Sistine Chapel]].&lt;ref name="Burn1997"/&gt; The children's anatomy was based on naturalistic observation. He sketched dying children as part of his preparation. He was compositionally influenced by ''Laocoön and His Sons'' at the Vatican. Carpeaux completed the work in the last year of his residence at the French Academy in Rome.&lt;ref name="Europe Age"/&gt;

The sculpture was cast in bronze in 1863 by the [[French Ministry of Fine Arts]] and displayed in the Parisian [[Tuileries]] to accompany a replica of ''Laocoön''.&lt;!--1862 version in Musée d'Orsay the same one? see Lombardi text's image--&gt; A marble version was completed in Paris under Carpeaux's supervision for the owner of the [[Saint-Béat]] marble quarry to exhibit at the [[International Exposition (1867)|1867 International Exposition]]. This version was later acquired by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Europe Age"/&gt;

== Reception ==

The initial release of the plaster model created a "public sensation". ''Ugolino and His Sons'' departed from the French Academy's tradition with "boldness and vigor" and the "spirit and masterly technique worthy of Michaelangelo".&lt;ref name="Europe Age"/&gt; The sculpture, and Carpeaux, were considered descendants of the 1830s French Romantic sculptor tradition associated with [[François Rude]] and [[Auguste Préault]]. Carpeaux admired the works of Rude, who once served as his mentor. ''Ugolino and His Sons'' launched Carpeaux's career and led to his commission for the [[façade]] of the [[Palais Garnier]] opera house: ''[[La Danse (Carpeaux)|La Danse]]'',&lt;ref name="Europe Age"/&gt;{{r|Chilvers2004}} a work that made him famous.&lt;ref name="Lombardi2009"/&gt;

== Legacy ==

Surrealist artist [[Max Ernst]] used a woodcut of ''Ugolino'', presumably from the International Exposition's catalog, in his 1929 graphic novel ''La femme 100 têtes''. His collage preserves the terror of Ugolino's face, but juxtaposes it against musical instruments.&lt;ref name="Ernst Retrospective"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spies|first1=Werner|last2=Rewald|first2=Sabine|location=New York|title=Max Ernst: A Retrospective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g645i-qeTuoC&amp;pg=PA43|year=2005|publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|isbn=978-0-300-10718-0|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
