'''Adele Briscoe Looscan''' ({{nee|Adele Lubbock Briscoe}} 5 February 1848 – 23 November 1935) was a club organizer,  writer, and historical preservationist from [[Harris County, Texas]]. She was president of the [[Texas State Historical Association]] (1915{{endash}}1925).

==Early life==
Adele Briscoe Looscan was born Adele Lubbock Briscoe on 5 February 1848.&lt;ref name=HTO&gt;{{cite web|series=Handbook of Texas Online|last=Hazlewood| first=Claudia|title=LOOSCAN, ADELE LUBBOCK BRISCOE|access-date=13 July 2018|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/flo19|date=16 May 2017|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father was [[Andrew Briscoe]], signer of the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]] and the first District Judge of Harris County. Her mother, Mary Jane (Harris) Briscoe, descended from an early settler and namesake of Harris County, [[John Richardson Harris]]. He also founded [[Harrisburg, Texas]], which was taken over and overseen by her grandmother, Jane Birdsall Briscoe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Daughter of the Republic|last=McLemore|first=Rebecca Lyons|title=Texas Women: Their Histories, Their Lives|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens, Georgia|year=2015|editor1=Turner, Elizabeth Hayes |editor2=Stephanie Cole |editor3=Rebecca Sharpless|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was named for one of her country neighbors, Adele Lubbock, the wife of Harris County Clerk and future Texas Governor, [[Francis Richard Lubbock]].&lt;ref name="McLemore 2015, p. 153"&gt;McLemore (2015), p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adele's father died when she was less than two-years old. The family moved to Mississippi to live with her paternal grandfather, General Parmenas Briscoe.&lt;ref name="McLemore 2015, p. 153"/&gt; After his death in 1851, Mary Jane Briscoe lost their residence in Mississippi and moved to [[Anderson, Texas]] in 1852. Seven years later she returned with her family to her hometown of Harrisburg, Texas. With the school at Harrisburg closed, Adele attended Miss Browne's School for Young Ladies (Houston) from 1861, where she graduated as valedictorian in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;McLemore (2015), pp. 154{{endash}}155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adele married Major Michael Looscan on 13 September 1881.&lt;ref name=HTO/&gt;

==Clubs and preservation==

In February 1885, Looscan started a club at her mother's home in Houston to promote “intellectual and social culture.”&lt;ref name=BTC&gt;{{cite web|series=Handbook of Texas Online|author=Chapman, Betty Trapp|title=LADIES’ READING CLUB (HOUSTON)|access-date=13 July 2018|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/vwlad|date=20 February 2017|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later her club had attracted thirty-five members, and become known as the Ladies’ Reading Club. Members collaborated in collecting periodicals and books to create a club library.  By 1900, Looscan organized a coalition of local clubs to form the City Federation of Woman's Clubs, which sponsored social events and raised money to buy a lot in Houston. The club's land purchase, combined with city of Houston and Carnegie grants, culminated in the opening of Houston's first public library on 2 March 1904.&lt;ref name=BTC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLemore (2015), pp. 158–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

Looscan and her mother hosted meetings to establish the [[Daughters of the Republic of Texas|Daughters of the Lone Star Republic]] (DRT) in 1891.&lt;ref name=daughters&gt;{{cite web|series=Handbook of Texas Online|last=Grady|first=Mrs. Rash, Jr.|title=DAUGHTERS OF THE REPUBLIC OF TEXAS|access-date=13 July 2018|date=12 June 2010|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/vnd03|publisher=Texas State Historical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLemore (2015), pp. 159–160.&lt;/ref&gt;  She poured her energy into recruitment for new members. She met resistance from many prospects, but persuaded [[Adina De Zavala]], a granddaughter of the first Vice-President of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;McLemore (2015), p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Looscan published writings in major Texas newspapers and some Texas literary magazines. Most famously, she published her mother's memoir of the “First Anniversary Ball of the Battle of San Jacinto.” She wrote frequently about Texas history, but also submitted essays about education and gender issues. Her works caught the attention of Dora Fowler Arthur, editor of ''Texas Magazine'', who offered column space to the DRT in 1896.  She wrote articles for Dudley G. Wooten's ''Comprehensive History of Texas'' and for his ''New History of Texas for Schools''.&lt;ref&gt;McLemore (2015), pp. 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Looscan was a combatant in a schism within the DRT about the [[Alamo]] site in [[San Antonio]]. De Zavala, who had established an eponymous chapter of the DRT, was adamant about historical restoration and preservation. Looscan supported De Zavala and her principles. Clara Driscoll advocated remaking the site as an urban park. The acrimony of the debate resulted in Looscan withdrawing from the DRT.&lt;ref&gt;McLemore (2015), pp. 165–166.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Texas State Historical Association (TSHA), organized in 1897, recruited Looscan and other writers from the women's clubs and trained them for scholarly historical writing. After the Alamo dispute, Looscan and De Zavala remained engaged with the TSHA, though many other women dropped out in reaction to the Alamo dispute. Looscan continued to write and recruit other writers for the TSHA. In 1915, [[Eugene C. Barker]] appointed Looscan to serve as president of the Texas State Historical Commission. She promoted TSHA's magazine, with a focus on Houston as a base of expansion, approaching [[Rice University|Rice Institute]] and various women's clubs.&lt;ref&gt;McLemore (2015), 167–169.&lt;/ref&gt;
Looscan resigned as president of TSHA in 1925, but remained active in the Association for the Preservation of the Historical Landmarks in Texas and the United Daughters of the Confederacy.&lt;ref&gt;McLemore (2015), pp. 170–171.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
[[File:GC adele briscoe looscan.jpg|thumb|Grave marker for Adele Briscoe Looscan, Glenwood Cemetery, Houston.]]
Looscan died in Houston on 23 November 1935 and was interred at [[Glenwood Cemetery (Houston, Texas)|Glenwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=HTO/&gt; She donated an extensive collection of Texas history books to the [[Houston Public Library]] and the Looscan Neighborhood Library in Houston is named in her honor.&lt;ref name=HTO/&gt;&lt;ref name=BTC/&gt;

== Background ==
Mor (previously Malowany) was born in 1947 in [[Wrocław|Wrocław, Poland]], to parents who were both survivors of [[the Holocaust]] (Shoah). He spent his childhood in Poland and made [[Aliyah]] to Israel in 1957. He lived with his parents on a [[moshav]], studying and working on the family farm.

The first thesis was titled "Tax Reduction for Donors of Non-Profit Organizations in Israel in Reference to Fundraising of Israeli Non-Profit Organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.btl.gov.il/Publications/Social_Security/גיליון%2066/Pages/סוגיית%20ההנחות%20במס%20לתורמים%20בפקודת%20מס%20הכנסה%20(סעיף%2046%20)%20וההשלכות%20על%20גיוס%20כספים%20במגזר%20השלישי.aspx |language=Hebrew|title=סוגיית ההנחות במס לתורמים בפקודת מס הכנסה (סעיף 46) וההשלכות על גיוס כספים במגזר השלישי | publisher=Mosad leBituach Leumi}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second was titled "A Comparative Analysis of Shoah Restitution in Three European Countries since the 1990s".

Mor served as a director at the International Affairs Department from 2001 to 2008, when he left the Ministry of Finance for his current position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/20/world/africa/20iht-holocaust.html?_r=1 |title=Israel sets Holocaust damages at $240 billion |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2005-04-21 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004-05 he served as senior advisor for the restitution of rights and Jewish property at the Prime Minister's Office and was nominated by the Israeli cabinet as co-chairman of the steering committee for restitution of Jewish rights and property.

== Representing Israel ==
Mor represented Israel as an emissary with three different organizations during three stints overseas: as Regional Director for the [[United Israel Appeal]] in the United Kingdom with the Joint Israel Appeal (1983–86, now the UJIA); in Canada with the Jewish Federation (1991–95); and in Australia with the [[Jewish National Fund]] (2001–02).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.waverley.nsw.gov.au/info/columns/2002/13_02_02.htm |title=Mayor's Column |publisher=.waverley.nsw.gov.au |date=2002-02-13 |accessdate=2011-07-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724070331/http://www1.waverley.nsw.gov.au/info/columns/2002/13_02_02.htm# |archivedate=2011-07-24 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also worked with organizations such as the World Jewish Restitution Organization (a branch of the [[World Jewish Congress]]), the Swiss Humanitarian Fund and the [[International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims|ICHEIC]].

Mor has established a number of NGOs. The first, established in 1974, helped families of the soldiers in his reserve tank brigade during wartime. The second, established in 1982, dealt with municipal issues. The third, established in 1997, dealt with programs for preventing violence at elementary schools.

'''Akhmad Abdulkhamidovich Kadyrov''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Ахмат Абдулхамидович Кадыров}}; {{lang-ce|Къадири lабдулхьамидан кlант Ахьмад-Хьажи / Q̇adiri Jabdulẋamidan khant Aẋmad-Ẋaƶi}};  23 August 1951&amp;nbsp;– 9 May 2004), also spelled '''Akhmat''', was the Chief [[Mufti]] of the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] in the 1990s during and after the [[First Chechen War]]. At the outbreak of the [[Second Chechen War]] he switched sides, offering his service to the Russian government, and later became the [[President of the Chechen Republic]] from 5 October 2003, acting as head of administration since July 2000.

On 9 May 2004, he was assassinated by Chechen Islamists in [[Grozny]], using a bomb blast during a [[World War II]] memorial [[victory parade]]. His son, [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], who led [[Kadyrovtsy|his father's militia]], became one of his successors in March 2007 as the [[President of the Chechen Republic]].

==Early life==
{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}
Akhmad (or Akhmat) Abdulkhamidovich Kadyrov was born in [[Karaganda]] in the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] on 23 August 1951 to a [[Chechen people|Chechen]] family that had been expelled from Chechnya during the [[Great Purge|Stalinist repressions]]. In April 1957, his family returned to [[Shalinsky District, Chechen Republic|Shalinsky District]] of the [[History of Chechnya|Chechen-Ingush ASSR]]. In 1980, he started studying Islam at [[Mir-i Arab Madrasah]] in [[Bukhara]], and followed by studying at [[Tashkent Islamic University|Islamic University]] in [[Tashkent]], Uzbekistan, from 1982 to 1986. In the early 1990s, he returned to Chechnya, and founded the Islam Institute in the village of [[Kurchaloy]].

===First Chechen War===
Following the Chechen [[declaration of independence]], he became a supporter of separatist president [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]]. Kadyrov fought prominently in the [[First Chechen War]] on the Chechen side as a [[militia]] commander.&lt;ref name="bowker"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowker|first=Mike|title=Chechnya: From Past to Future|editor=Richard Sakwa|publisher = Anthem Press|location=London |year=2005|edition=1st|pages=223–38|chapter=Western Views of the Chechen Conflict|isbn=978-1-84331-164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he was appointed Chief [[Mufti]] of [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]]. Following the outbreak of violence between Moscow and Chechen separatists, Kadyrov declared that "Russians outnumber Chechens in many times, thus every Chechen would have to kill 150 [[Russians]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/08/09/007.html The High Cost of Job Security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821230223/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2006/08/09/007.html |date=21 August 2006 }}, ''The Moscow Times'', 8 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-05/10/content_329330.htm Profile: Akhmad Kadyrov], ''China Daily'', 10 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Chechen War===
[[Image:Akhmad Kadyrov and Vladimir Putin.jpg|thumb|left|Akhmad Kadyrov and [[Vladimir Putin]].]]
While the first war was mainly fought for nationalism, after the ''de facto'' independence of [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria|Ichkeria]], much of the Chechen forces were [[jihad]]is, such as the [[Arab Mujahideen in Chechnya]].

Kadyrov, as Chief Mufti, was critical of [[Wahhabi]]sm, to which many of the foreign fighters adhered.

Early in 1999 he gave a speech before the armed militia telling them that the nation was behind them, that the recent outbreak of violence was the fault of Christian and foreign involvement, and that they should continue on fighting with persistence and trust.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59tb_VrAyzY Ahmad Kadyrov 1999 speech] (with English translation, posted by Islamists, YouTube)&lt;/ref&gt;

But by the autumn of 1999, Kadyrov – a leading figure in the resistance movement – decided to abandon the insurgency and offered his support to Russian federal forces in [[Second Chechen War]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.il/books?id=kIs4DgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT118&amp;lpg=PT118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A Woman Behind the Lines of the War in Chechnya] Anne Nivat, PublicAffairs publishers, 2001 {{ISBN|1586480448}} (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aslan Maskhadov|Maskhadov]] immediately fired him from the Chief Mufti chair, although this decree was never accepted by Kadyrov, who abdicated himself a few months later due to his civilian chairman career. According to [[James Hughes (political scientist)|James Hughes]], Kadyrov's U-turn may have been motivated partly by personal ambition and partly by a concern with the desperate condition of the Chechen population, and was also driven by a fear of the growing sectarian Wahhabi influence on the insurgency.&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=James|title=Chechnya: From Past to Future|editor=Richard Sakwa|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|year=2005|edition=1st|pages=265–288|chapter=The Peace Process in Chechnya|isbn=978-1-84331-164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Russian forces seized control over Chechnya in July 2000, Kadyrov was appointed acting head of the administration by the Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/787811.stm Russia appoints Chechen leader], BBC News, 12 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2003, he was elected the first [[President of Chechnya]]. In this position, he remained mainly pro-Moscow. He also advocated numerous [[amnesty]] campaigns for former rebel fighters, who were allowed to join Chechen police and [[Kadyrovtsy|loyalist militia]] forces if they surrendered. His chief personal [[bodyguard]] was [[Movladi Baisarov]]. Reportedly, there were at least a dozen assassination attempts against him before the final one.

==Death and legacy==
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev and Ramzan Kadyrov 19 June 2012 10.jpeg|thumb|Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] at the grave of Akhmad Kadyrov in June 2012]]
On 9 May 2004, [[2004 Grozny stadium bombing|an explosion ripped through the VIP seating at the Dinamo football stadium]] during a mid-morning [[Victory Day (Eastern Europe)|Soviet Victory Day]] [[parade]] in the capital city of [[Grozny]], instantly killing Akhmad Kadyrov. Two of his bodyguards, the Chairman of the Chechen State Council, a [[Reuters]] journalist, and as many as a dozen others were also killed (a later report stated that more than 30 people had died).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.khaleejtimes.com/darticlen.asp?xfile=data/theworld/2008/July/theworld_July1590.xml&amp;section=theworld&amp;col= Bodyguards foil assassination of Chechen leader: report]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805033856/http://www.khaleejtimes.com/darticlen.asp?xfile=data%2Ftheworld%2F2008%2FJuly%2Ftheworld_July1590.xml&amp;section=theworld&amp;col= |date=5 August 2008 }}, AFP, 29 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Some 56 others were wounded, including [[Colonel General]] [[Valery Baranov (soldier)|Valery Baranov]], the commander of Russian forces in Chechnya, who lost a leg in the explosion. The bomb was said to have been built into the concrete of a supporting column during recent repairs. The Islamist Chechen rebel leader [[Shamil Basayev]] later claimed that he had paid $50,000 for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=$50,000 Bounty in Chechen Blood Feud |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/17/world/europe/17briefs-002.html |newspaper= The New York Times|work= |date=17 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akhmad Kadyrov had four children, two daughters (Zargan and Zulay) and two sons. The older son, Zelimkhan Kadyrov, died on 31 May 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=26597 Eldest Son Of Akhmad Kadyrov Dies], The Jamestown Foundation, 2 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The younger son, [[Ramzan Kadyrov]], led [[Kadyrovtsy|his father's militia]] and was appointed prime minister and president of Chechnya in March 2007.

The [[Akhmad Kadyrov Mosque]] in Grozny is named for him.

On 7 June 2017, the football club Terek Grozny was renamed to [[FC Akhmat Grozny|Akhmat Grozny]], after Akhmad Kadyrov.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=FC Akhmat Grozny|url=http://fc-akhmat.ru/page/8581|script-title=ru:Главная футбольная команда Чеченской Республики будет переименована в «АХМАТ»|date=7 June 2017|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3360">'''Augustin Lippi''' (* 1678 in [[Paris]]; † November 10, 1705 in [[Sennar]])&lt;ref&gt;Todesdatum nach E. A. Wallis Budge: ''The Egyptian Sudan: Its History and Monuments Part One''. 2004. {{ISBN|1417977221}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a French [[Physician|physician]] and [[Botanist|botanist]] of Italian descent.

== Life and Work ==
Augustin Lippi was born in 1678 in Paris. His parents came from the Italian town of [[Lucca]]. He studied medicine at the [[University of Paris]] and collected plants in [[Egypt]].

In 1703, the French King [[Louis XIV]] planned on establishing trade relations and resuming missionary activity in the [[Kingdom of Ethiopia]]. A delegation was therefore to be sent to Ethiopian [[Negus]] [[Iyasu I]]. However, the French [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in [[Cairo]], [[Benoît de Maillet]], had been commissioned recently for the first time and shied away from the difficulty and danger of the trip. He in turn proposed the vice-consul of [[Damiette]], Le Noir Du Roule (1665?-1705), to carry out the expedition.  

Despite hostility to the mission from the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], the [[Order of Friars Minor|Franciscans]] and the [[Copts|Coptic ]] [[Patriarch]], a small group including Augustin Lippi left Cairo on July 9, 1704.

The group first traveled along the [[Nile]] to the city of [[Asyut]], reached Selfma on October 3, and arrived in Moshi thirteen days later where a long rest was taken.

At the end of May 1705, the delegation reached the town of [[Sennar]] on the [[Blue Nile]] in modern-day [[Sudan]], ruled by the [[Funj Sultanate]]. Here the journey was repeatedly delayed. On November 10, 1705 the six-person party was attacked on a square in Sennar. Five of the six (including Lippi) were murdered, and only one European survived.

== Dedication Names ==
[[William Houston]] named the genus "Lippia," of the [[Verbenaceae]] plant family, in Lippi's honor.&lt;ref&gt;Carl von Linné: ''Critica Botanica'' Leiden 1737, S. 93&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus]] later renamed the plant after himself.&lt;ref&gt;Carl von Linné: ''Genera Plantarum''. Leiden 1742, S. 299&lt;/ref&gt;

Created by [[Bob Haney]] and [[Nick Cardy]], the character first appeared in ''[[Aquaman (comic book)|Aquaman]]'' #35 (September 1967). He is a ruthless underwater-based [[mercenary]] and killer who is usually depicted as the [[archenemy]] of the [[superhero]] [[Aquaman]].&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Greenberger|first = Robert|author-link =|contribution = Black Manta|editor-last = Dougall|editor-first = Alastair|title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia|page = 52|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|place = London|year = 2008|isbn = 0-7566-4119-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including several [[Animated series|cartoon]] [[television series]], [[Animation|animated]] [[DC Animated Movie Universe|movies]], and [[video games]]. Black Manta made his [[live action|live-action]] cinematic debut in the [[2018 in film|2018]] [[DC Extended Universe]] film ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]'', portrayed by [[Yahya Abdul-Mateen II]].&lt;ref name="Manta"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kit|first1=Borys|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/aquaman-finds-black-manta-villain-get-down-actor-970629|title='Aquaman' Finds Its Black Manta Villain With 'Get Down' Actor (Exclusive)|date=31 January 2017|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Black Manta had no definitive origin story until #6 of the 1993 ''Aquaman'' series. In this origin, the boy who would become Black Manta grew up in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], and loved to play by [[the Chesapeake Bay]]. Throughout his youth he was kidnapped and forced to work on a ship for an unspecified amount of time, where he was physically abused by his captors. At one point, he saw Aquaman with his [[dolphin]] friends and tried to signal him for help but was not seen. Finally, he was forced to defend himself, killing one of his tormentors on the ship with a knife. Hating the emotionless sea and Aquaman, whom he saw as its representative, the boy was determined to become its master.&lt;ref name="aquaman6"&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 4, #6, 1993, DC Comics, writer Shaun McLaughlin&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative version was given in #8 of the 2003 ''Aquaman'' series. In this origin, the boy who would become Black Manta was an autistic orphan placed in [[Gotham City]]'s [[Arkham Asylum]]. He felt comfortable in freezing cold water, but found cotton sheets excruciatingly painful. Because the attendants at Arkham did not know how to deal with autism, they would end up restraining him to the bed as he struggled and screamed whenever they tried putting him to bed. In this version, young Black Manta was also fascinated when he saw Aquaman on television.

The boy would end up being subjected to experimental treatments. One treatment seemed to clear the boy's head, but left him violent as a result; he killed the scientist who had administered the treatment and escaped from Arkham.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aquaman8"&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 6, #8, 2003, DC Comics, writer Rick Veitch&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Blackmantaunmasked.PNG|left|180px|Black Manta, without his mask. Art by [[Jim Aparo]].]]
As an adult, the man who would become Black Manta designed a costume (primarily a black wetsuit with a bug-eyed helmet, that was able to shoot rays from its eyes) and fashioned a high-tech submersible inspired by [[manta ray]]s. Taking the name Black Manta, he and his masked army became a formidable force, engaging in at least one unrecorded clash with Aquaman prior to his first appearance as a rival to the [[Ocean Master]] (and before joining the short-lived [[Injustice League]] in the [[retroactive continuity|retcon]] ''Silver Age'' third week event).

His first name, David, is revealed in the 2010 ''[[Brightest Day]]'' storyline, although his last name has not been revealed.&lt;ref name=bd9 /&gt;

Black Manta and Aquaman battled repeatedly over the next several years. During one of these clashes,&lt;ref name="Adventure Comics #452"&gt;''[[Adventure Comics]]'' #452, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; it is revealed that Black Manta is actually black, whose stated objective at one point was for [[black people]] to dominate the ocean after having been oppressed for so long on dry land (though this goal was revealed to be a ruse he used to trick [[Cal Durham]] into following him, and this objective was not at all evident in either his earlier or later appearances). During most of his appearances, his main goals are defeating Aquaman and gaining power for himself through the conquest of [[Atlantis (DC Comics)|Atlantis]]. Finally, Manta kills Arthur Curry, Jr., Aquaman's son, which leaves Aquaman obsessed with revenge.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Adventure Comics #452" /&gt;

Black Manta is later transformed into a human/manta ray hybrid by the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for his soul, though after a while he returns to wearing his original outfit, which covers his new appearance. At one point he engages in drug smuggling from his new base in [[Star City (comics)|Star City]], where he is opposed by a returning [[Green Arrow]] and Aquaman.

In a later confrontation, Aquaman, sporting the [[Lady of the Lake]]'s Healing Hand, reverses Neron's alterations to Black Manta and rewires Manta's afflicted brain, making him normal for the first time in his life. Unfortunately, Manta remains a violent criminal, lulling Aquaman into a false sense of partnership and almost killing the Sea King in the process.

In later events, Black Manta is used as a genetic manipulation test subject to make water breathers. This succeeds; since then, Black Manta has returned to the oceans to face Aquaman once again.

Black Manta causes a disturbance in [[Sub Diego]] in which Captain Marley is severely injured.&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 4 #39&lt;/ref&gt; Aquaman summons various predatory sea-life to attack Black Manta and leaves him for dead. It is later revealed that Black Manta was able to survive by generating an electric charge with his suit.

[[One Year Later]], he overtakes Sub Diego but is forced to flee when [[King Shark]] bites off his face.&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis'' #52–53 (July–August 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Aquaman dies at the end of the 2003 series, Black Manta begins working for [[Libra (DC Comics)|Libra]] as part of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]]. However, after Libra betrays the group and helps [[Darkseid]] conquer the Earth, Black Manta quits.

===Brightest Day===
[[File:BlackManta.jpg|thumb|Black Manta on the cover of ''Brightest Day'' #19 (April 2011). Art by David Finch.]]
In a 2011 ''[[Brightest Day]]'' storyline called "Aquawar", Black Manta has retired from his criminal ways. He has opened a fish market to earn an honest living. When he discovers that Aquaman has been resurrected following the end of the ''[[Blackest Night]]'', Black Manta murders the customers in the store and burns down his shorefront house as he resumes his criminal career and vendetta against Aquaman.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #1 (May 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Black Manta is seen later at the grave of Thomas Curry, Aquaman's father, where he is approached by Siren and her Death Squad after demolishing the tombstone. The Death Squad battles Black Manta, but before the fight continues too long, Siren stops them. She informs Black Manta that they need to work together to find his son, showing him a hard water image of [[Aqualad (Kaldur'ahm)|Jackson Hyde]].&lt;ref name=bd9 /&gt;

Black Manta and Siren locate Jackson and attempt to kill his foster father. Jackson (using his ability to create hard water constructs) fights back but was unable to stop Black Manta from shooting a trident-shaped dart at his foster father. However, at the last moment, Aquaman intervened, blocking the fatal shot. Black Manta then faced his old nemesis again.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #10 (September 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; During the battle, Aquaman pulls Jackson and his foster father to safety.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #11 (October 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a flashback, it is revealed that Black Manta was once a treasure hunter who, along with his wife, was captured while exploring the [[Bermuda Triangle]].&lt;ref name="bd16"&gt;''Brightest Day'' #16 (December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Their captors were the other-dimensional residents of Xebel, and the two were tortured mercilessly. The captors experimented on Black Manta's pregnant wife which gave the unborn child powers similar to those of the residents of Xebel.&lt;ref name="bd16" /&gt; Fearing the child (Jackson) would be used as a pawn in an invasion of Earth, Xebel princess Mera kidnapped the child and took him to Earth, where she arranged him to be adopted and raised far away from water in order to keep him from her people.&lt;ref name="bd16" /&gt; Black Manta ultimately escaped from Xebel, though his wife ultimately died.&lt;ref name="bd16" /&gt;

After Jackson learns the truth behind his origin, Aquaman and Jackson (now calling himself Aqualad) were ambushed by Siren and the Xebel soldiers on a California beach, where innocent citizens became caught in the crossfire. As Aquaman is about to strike back at Siren, Black Manta springs from the water and severs Aquaman's right hand.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #19 (February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson attacks his father, berating him for siding with the people who killed his own wife, only for Black Manta to throw Jackson to the ground and coldly state that both he and his mother meant nothing to him. As Black Manta prepares to impale his son with one of his blades, Mera arrives with [[Aquagirl (Lorena Marquez)|Aquagirl]], who saves Jackson by striking Black Manta in the face. Jackson and Mera work together to seal Black Manta, Siren, and the rest of the invaders away in the Bermuda Triangle. Black Manta vows from within the prison to get his son, Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;''Brightest Day'' #20 (February 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New 52===
In [[The New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Black Manta kills a woman named Kahina the Seer, a former teammate of Aquaman, and steals her Atlantean relic. He then vows to kill her entire family before getting his revenge on Aquaman.&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 5 #7 (March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; A flashback shows that Aquaman created a team known as the Others (forged of six Atlantean relics from the Dead King's tomb) who are trying to catch Black Manta, but they fail and Black Manta escapes. Black Manta goes after Aquaman's former teammate Prisoner-of-War in [[Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #8 (April 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is then revealed that Aquaman had killed Black Manta's father by accident in retaliation for attacking Aquaman's father.&lt;ref name="a9"&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #9 (May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="a10"&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #10 (June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking revenge, Black Manta attempted to kill all of Aquaman's family and friends. When Black Manta chased Prisoner-of-War, he was confronted by Aquaman in a battle.&lt;ref name="a9" /&gt; During the attack, Black Manta stole one of Ya'Wara's Atlantean relics and teleported to Stephen Shin, Aquaman's former friend.&lt;ref name="a10" /&gt; Black Manta then tasered Mera and pulled Shin to him in order to teleport away.

Meanwhile, the Others were reunited and discovered that there was a seventh Atlantean relic in the Dead King's tomb. Manta took Shin captive in the Dead King's tomb in order to find the seventh relic and located in the Dead King's throne.&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #11 (July 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Manta prepared to kill Shin, but was thwarted when Aquaman and the Others attacked his henchmen. Black Manta killed Vostok-X and escaped with the relic scepter. After Vostok-X's death, Aquaman, through tears, swore that he would kill Manta in revenge.&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #12 (August 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Black Manta delivered the relic scepter to [[Nuidis Vulko|a mysterious Atlantean]], who was revealed to be his employer, but the Others ambushed them and attacked. The mysterious Atlantean managed to grab the relic scepter and escape while Black Manta was forced to battle the Others, resulting in Manta and his henchmen being taken away by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #13 (October 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; While in [[Belle Reve]] Prison, Black Manta refused to join [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Suicide Squad]].&lt;ref&gt;''Aquaman'' vol. 7 #14 (November 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Forever Evil]]'' storyline, Amanda Waller approached Black Manta again to join the Suicide Squad.

====The Drowning====
Black Manta's first ''Rebirth'' appearance was in the one-shot ''Aquaman: Rebirth'' #1, acting as the narrator until he reveals himself at the very end. Manta later appeared in ''Aquaman'' vol. 8, #1, in which he attacks Spindrift Station, an Atlantean embassy built by Aquaman near his hometown of Amnesty Bay to promote relations between Atlantis and the surface. Black Manta fights with Aquaman, and even wounds him, but the fight is ended with words about how hollow and empty Black Manta's purpose in life truly is. He's eventually taken into custody by the U.S. military, but the vehicle transporting him is attacked by N.E.M.O forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aquaman #2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A woman named Blackjack takes him to the organization's base in Antarctica, where he meets the Fisher King. N.E.M.O plans to discredit Aquaman in the eyes of the world by manipulating conflicts with the United States and other surface nations, and Black Manta decides to continue this mission after killing the Fisher King and claiming the title for himself.&lt;ref name="Aquaman #6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Aquaman #6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Aquaman #7, Manta appears at a meeting of the N.E.M.O board in Venice, Italy, where he kills those who oppose his rule as the Fisher King and commands the Shaggy Man to attack Atlantis. Later, Manta oversees N.E.M.O's usage of Atlantean pretender forces against the U.S, which prompts the nation to declare war on Atlantis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aquaman #11}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a team of American Aquamarines, super soldiers who can take on the form of sharks and other aquatic creatures, fails to assassinate Aquaman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Aquaman #14}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Atlantean king attacks Black Manta on his ship in the Azores in issue #15. Rather than surrender, Black Manta blows up the ship and all aboard, but Aquaman and Blackjack escape.

====Rise of Aqualad/Blood of Manta====
It is revealed, however, that Manta survived the explosion, perhaps with the help of Blackjack, and has become obsessed with finding his illegitimate son Jackson Hyde, who has joined the Teen Titans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teen Titans #7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manta's desire to find him stems from his remembrance of a lost relic with power over the sea itself, '''The Black Pearl'''. A weapon which can bend the very oceans to the user's whim, which once belonged to a notorious Atlantean pirate who died in Xebel. Knowing only a denizen of Xebel had the map to its keep and only Xebelian hands could unseal it, he nearly murdered Hyde's mother in order to get to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teen Titans #9-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his son in tow, Manta and Jackson set out to find his prize, needing his son to unlock the trove that the pearl was sealed in. Eventually a clash broke out between him and the Teen Titans after achieving his goal and with it, power to dominate the world. he was finally bested by [[Aqualad (Kaldur'ahm)|Aqualad]] who near fatally electrocuted him before taking the pearl ring from his hand.&lt;ref name="Teen Titans #11"&gt;{{cite book|title=Teen Titans #11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Society====
He's later seen having joined up with ''The Secret Society'', who've recently sent for Deathstroke due to previous misconduct against fellow member [[Deadline (DC Comics)|Deadline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=''Deathstroke'' (2016 'Rebirth' series) #23-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Black Manta possesses a keen scientific mind and is an expert in mechanical [[engineering]] and [[military tactics]]. Despite being a skilled [[Hand-to-hand combat|hand-to-hand combatant]] and [[Swordsmanship|swordsman]], he generally relies more on technology and strategic planning than direct physical confrontations.

As a result of the serum that cured him of his autism, Black Manta possesses some degree of advanced stamina and endurance. He utilizes a nigh-invulnerable [[powered exoskeleton|battle suit]] that further enhances his physical strength and durability to superhuman levels, allowing him to lift and throw cars with ease. This armor is [[Adaptation|adapted]] to an oceanic environment, providing complete resistance to deep sea pressures and granting Black Manta the ability to breathe underwater. The suit also includes a jet pack propulsion system that functions in or out of water, a [[telepathy|telepathic]] scrambler, and a wide array of different weapons and gadgets; it houses twin swords, a hand trident, a wrist-mounted [[speargun]] on the right arm, a retractable blade in the left gauntlet, deployable miniaturized [[torpedo|torpedoes]], and can discharge powerful optic blasts from the eye lenses of the helmet. Black Manta often uses unique vehicles, such as a modified manta ray-shaped [[submarine]], for traveling underwater.

At one point, Black Manta was transformed by the demon Neron into a human-manta ray hybrid in exchange for his soul, which allowed him to breathe underwater without the use of his suit. This transformation has since been undone by Aquaman.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt; For a brief time, Black Manta possessed a powerful mystical relic named "The Black Pearl", a powerful Atlantean artifact that allowed him to control the oceans at will.&lt;ref name="Teen Titans #11"/&gt;

==Other versions==

===Justice===
Black Manta appeared as one of the major villains in the 2005-2006 ''[[Justice (DC Comics)|Justice]]'' miniseries by [[Alex Ross]] and [[Jim Krueger]] as part of the [[Legion of Doom]]. This version appears to be based on the time period when Black Manta fought for African Americans as shown by all of his henchmen being black and his city being completely populated by African Americans. He is first seen luring Aquaman into an ambush and controlling Aquaman's sharks into attacking him before taking Aquaman to [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]]. When [[Lex Luthor]] makes his speech to the world to join him in saving it, Black Manta is one of the villains alongside him.

As the Legion begins kidnapping the people close to the heroes, Black Manta takes control of [[Garth (comics)|Garth]] and forces him to assault [[Mera (comics)|Mera]] and kidnap Aquaman's son. During the Justice League's attack on the Hall of Doom, Black Manta faces off against Aquaman for the entire battle. Black Manta is one of the few villains to escape the Justice League and teleport to his city along with Aquaman's son, who follows behind him. Aquaman eventually finds Black Manta's hideout, but Black Manta's men savagely beat him in front of his son, comparing it to the treatment of his own people. Aquaman counters Black Manta is doing the same by using [[Doctor Sivana]]'s technology to control his men, smashing the pack on Black Manta's suit to free his henchmen from Black Manta's control. Black Manta realizes that Aquaman was right, but makes one last effort to kill him in desperation. He is quickly struck down by Aquaman, saying that Black Manta never really had a chance to begin with.

Black Manta appears in ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'' #4 where he is shown trapped by [[Plastic Man]].

'''Hussain Sha''' (September 9, 1905 &amp;ndash; September 24, 1981) was the seventh head of [[Sri Viswa Viznana Vidya Adhyatmika Peetham]] in [[Pithapuram]]. He was born in [[Rajahmundry]], [[East Godavari District]]. He succeeded his father, [[Kavisekhara Dr Umar Alisha]] Sathguru. He completed his primary education at [[Pithapuram]] and passed the Final Arts course from National College in [[Machilipatnam]]. He was a scholar in [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Arabic]], [[Urdu]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Sanskrit]].

Sha and his wife Ajeemunnisa Begum had four sons and four daughters. Prior to assuming the charge as Peethadhipathi (Head of the Institution), his main occupation was farming. Drawing on that knowledge, he made a celestial herbal medicine ''Devadaru''.

Hussain Sha had taken up preaching of the Peetham’s philosophy from February 10, 1945. He delivered Divine spiritual messages at many villages and cities of Andhra Pradesh to propagate Jnanayoga (Yoga of Supreme Knowledge) and Bhaktiyoga (Yoga of Devotion). He died in [[Pithapuram]], [[East Godavari District]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[India]].

Hussain Sha is also known for his philosophy. In SHA TATWAM, he has explained many things about the Miraculous Brilliant Divine Light and how the man should behave.

'''Cleveland Orenthal Brown Jr.''' is a character in the [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] ''[[Family Guy]]'', and its spin-off series ''[[The Cleveland Show]]''.&lt;ref name="debut"&gt;{{cite episode |people=[[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]], [[Matt Weitzman]] (writers); Jack Dyer (director)|title=Love Thy Trophy |series=Family Guy |serieslink=Family Guy|network=Fox |date=March 14, 2000|season=2|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the son of [[Cleveland Brown]] and his late ex-wife [[Loretta Brown|Loretta]]. On ''Family Guy'', he was depicted as slim and hyperactive; however, on ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'' he is shown to have undergone a marked transformation, both in terms of a significant increase in weight and a newly subdued personality. He was voiced by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] in ''Family Guy'' and by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] in ''The Cleveland Show'' and on the character's return to the former show.

At 14 years old, Junior is the only child of [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] and [[Loretta Brown]], stepson of [[Donna Tubbs]], and the stepbrother of [[Roberta Tubbs|Roberta]] and [[Rallo Tubbs]]. Junior's most prominent character traits are his laziness, obesity, and low social intelligence (although there are occasional references to him being academically bright). He has obtained poor eyesight over the years and now wears glasses. Since his parents' divorce, Loretta gave custody of Cleveland Jr. back to Cleveland and forced him to move. Thus, the pair left for California. However, en route, they decided to live in Stoolbend, Virginia instead, where Cleveland married Donna Tubbs, and Rallo and Roberta became his step-siblings.

==Role in ''The Cleveland Show''==
Cleveland Jr. is a frequent target of weight related jokes from a variety of characters in the series, in particular Rallo, his step-brother. When Rallo met Cleveland Jr. and his father he would often call them "fat". In the second episode, Cleveland Jr. served as a door in the bathroom so that he could earn his classmates' respect, which angered Cleveland. He also exudes a nervous and overly sensitive nature, and seems to have a fear of toasters as the toaster in his house scares and taunts him (akin to [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and the monkey in his closet).

It is revealed in "[[Birth of a Salesman (The Cleveland Show)|Birth of a Salesman]]" that Cleveland Jr. has repressed emotions from the divorce of his parents and has in fact never cried before. He has also revealed resentment towards his own mother, Loretta, for cheating on his father with [[Glenn Quagmire|Quagmire]] back in "[[The Cleveland-Loretta Quagmire]]". Feeling bad for the way they treated him, Roberta and Rallo help Cleveland Jr. to express his sadness and at the same time the three of them accepted one another as family. In "[[The Hurricane!]]", Junior reveals that he had lost faith in God after learning from Loretta that Jesus forgave her for her affair with Glenn Quagmire that lead to her divorcing Cleveland. He also states that he [[Nontheism|does not believe in God]], although he claims he is not an [[atheism|atheist]] either, which he calls  atheism "a religion, too". However, in later episodes he explicitly identifies as an atheist without any such qualification. Yet in "[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Brown]]", he tells Rallo that he is reading ''[[Blubber (novel)|Blubber]]'' by [[Judy Blume]] because they don't have the Quran, implying that he may be a [[Muslim]].

Junior's obesity and low self-esteem makes it difficult for him to find friends. In "[[Da Doggone Daddy-Daughter Dinner Dance]]", he seems to become friends with Derek, Laine, Reggie and Kyle, although this is solely due to his agreeing to act as a replacement bathroom door as, in later episodes, Derek, Laine and Reggie continue to bully Junior, often under the lead of Oliver Wilkerson. In "The One About Friends", Cleveland Jr. creates an actual friendship with Lester Krinklesac's son, Ernie. He shared a kiss with Laura Davis at the Stoolbend Community Church's chastity ball.

While Junior is not as active as he was in ''Family Guy'', he has other hobbies and interests; he enjoys [[science]], playing the [[tuba]] in the Stoolbend High School [[school band]], and is the leader of a troop of Freedom Scouts, Stoolbend's version of the [[Boy Scouts]]. Derek nominated him for student-council president as a joke, but, after saving Oliver Wilkerson's life, he won. Additionally, while he may not know much when it comes to social situations, he is an excellent student attending Stoolbend High School along with his older sister, Roberta.

A scene in a "[[A Rodent Like This]]" suggests that ''The Cleveland Show''{{'}}s Junior has a dark double life. He reveals to Rallo that he is a secret agent who killed the original Cleveland Jr. (as drawn in the first four seasons of ''Family Guy'') in order to be placed in the Brown family. This gag is not followed up in later episodes, suggesting that it was either real or an elaborate prank on Rallo out of annoyance the latter was determined to find out what was in Jr.'s suitcase earlier in the episode that led to the top-secret organization.

Cleveland Brown Jr. is married to Cecilia, as shown in "Y Tu Junior También", to prevent her deportation.

==Character==

===Creation===
Cleveland Jr. debuted in the ''Family Guy'' [[Family Guy (season 2)|season 2]] episode "[[Love Thy Trophy]]", but only made a handful more appearances thereafter. He was presumably taken into Loretta's custody after she divorced Cleveland in "[[The Cleveland–Loretta Quagmire]]" and has since undergone a major character reinvention upon becoming a leading character in ''The Cleveland Show''. After Cleveland and Loretta's divorce is finalized in the [[Pilot (The Cleveland Show)|pilot episode of ''The Cleveland Show'']], Junior is placed in Cleveland's custody, and they move out of [[Quahog, Rhode Island]] to [[Stoolbend, Virginia]] where Cleveland rekindles a relationship with, and subsequently marries, his high school sweetheart, Donna Tubbs. His recent status is pronounced deceased as the he has abandon life support unit (LSU) in Season 10 EP 4 "The Cookie Club"  and is seen sleeping in the woods, without his life support unit he probably died during nightfall. Before Cleveland would noticed, as he and his wife Donna go out for a drink every night.

===Design===
[[File:Cleveland Jr (FamilyGuy).png|130px|left|thumb|Cleveland Jr. as he appeared prior to 2009.]]
In ''Family Guy'' Cleveland Jr. is an active child of average size, but in ''The Cleveland Show'' he has aged, gained weight, appears potentially smarter, and wears glasses. In ''Family Guy'', he wears a purple T-shirt, blue jeans and white sneakers, but in ''The Cleveland Show'', he wears a red T-shirt, blue shorts, sneakers and glasses. He is also notably shorter, as ''Family Guy'' shows him to be of average height for his age, while in ''The Cleveland Show'', he appears to be no more than 5 ft. at the age of 14.

Cleveland Jr. was a minor character who had a short time with [[Peter Griffin]] in the episode, "[[Fore Father]]", where he showed a talent for playing [[golf]]. After that episode, he made short appearances later in the show, with his last on ''Family Guy'', until 2010 at his father's supposed funeral, along with Loretta.

===Voice===
[[File:Kevin Michael Richardson by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Kevin Michael Richardson has voiced Junior as of 2009.]]
Junior's voice is provided by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], who voices other characters on ''The Cleveland Show'', including Lester Krinklesac, Julius, and P-Hound. In ''Family Guy'', Junior's voice is provided by [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]].

Richardson stated that he describes voicing Cleveland Jr. as "a character he did on ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' named Patrick, who was mentally impaired and wore a football helmet."&lt;ref name="voicesbehind"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20309493,00.html|title=The Voices Behind 'Cleveland'|date=2 October 2009|publisher=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the show aired in 2009, the show's panel appeared at the 2009 [[Comic Con International]], and held a discussion about the show. When describing Junior's change in physical appearance and age, [[Mike Henry (voice actor)|Mike Henry]] said "Cleveland Jr. really didn't have much to him and so he didn't appear for a while and so we sort of aged him up and made room for [[Rallo Tubbs|Rallo]] to be the younger one for a while."&lt;ref name="ccicleveland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=22408|title=CCI: The Cleveland Show|last=Cronan|first=Mark|date=5 August 2009|publisher=Comic Book Resources|accessdate=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's creators later gave an explanation of Junior's altered look in "[[A Rodent Like This]]., although to some it may see unrealistic even in the context of the show (Cleveland Jr. as an operative of a crime-fighting entity run by ex-CIA agents deemed, as Junior says, "too extreme by the agency". It is even a possibility that this was all a joke, even in the program's context, because in the episode "Cleveland Live!" it is said that the characters basically run the show, and assist with the writing; this is obviously not true because these characters are fictional.

Around 1634 John Dwight came with his wife Hannah, daughter Hannah, and sons Timothy Dwight and John Dwight, from [[Dedham, Essex]], [[England]] to North America where the town was named [[Dedham, Massachusetts]]. Son John died in 1638, and he had two more daughters, before dying in 1660.
Known descendants are from their son Captain Timothy Dwight (1629–1717) and his third wife Anna Flint.

Justice Nathaniel Dwight (1666–1711) married Mehitable Partidge (1675–1756) in 1693.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21528">[[File:HootGibson.jpg|thumb|alt=Hoot Gibson|Hoot Gibson (c. 1924)]] This is a complete filmography of American actor [[Hoot Gibson]] (August 6, 1892 – August 23, 1962), including his performances between 1910 and 1960. Gibson appeared in more than 200 films.

==Background==
Gibson's career began in 1910 with early [[silent film]] "[[short film|shorts]]", and he continued as a movie star once "[[talkies]]" were introduced, his first sound film being ''The Long, Long Trail'' (1929).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0020107/trivia IMDb: ''The Long, Long Trail'' trivia]&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily starring in [[Western (genre)|Western]] films, Gibson worked with many directors, including [[John Ford]], who would direct many popular American Westerns and [[American Civil War|Civil War]] films, over his fifty years of film production, including ''The Horse Soldiers'' (1959), starring [[John Wayne]], in which Gibson played a supporting role. As with many silent and early recordings, a number of Gibson's films are considered to be [[lost film|lost]].

'''Jack Coe''' (March 11, 1918 – December 16, 1956) was a Pentecostal evangelist, nicknamed "the man of reckless faith". He one of the first [[faith healing|faith healers]] in the United States with a touring tent ministry after [[World War II]]. Coe was ordained in the [[Assemblies of God]] in 1944, and began to preach while still serving in World War II. In the following twelve years, he travelled the U.S. organizing tent revivals to spread his message. "Coe was frequently the center of controversy" and "preached extensively through the South and employed some 80 persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0003/6786971/40874678_clean.html |title=Faith Healer Dies of Polio |publisher=[[Charleston Gazette]] |date=December 17, 1956 |first= |last= |accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Jack Coe was born in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]], the seventh child of George Henry and Blanche Zoe (Mays) Coe of Pleasantville, Venango County, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma City.{{Cn|date=December 2015}}  His parents later placed him in an orphanage. He left there at the age of 17, in about 1935. A heavy drinker, he joined the Army after [[World War II]] began. He later claimed to have experienced a miracle during his time in the military that caused him to become a [[Christian minister]]. Coe had close ties with the [[Assemblies of God]], and preached several meetings while he was in the Army. He was ordained in 1944 and then began his career as an itinerant preacher.&lt;ref name=h58&gt;Harrell 1975, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tent evangelist and ministries==
Coe was dynamic and enthusiastic in his beliefs.&lt;ref name=h58/&gt; He knew [[Oral Roberts]] and was impressed by the size of Robert’s revival tent. One day Coe went to tent meeting of Roberts's and measured the tent; he then ordered a larger one.&lt;ref name=h59&gt;Harrell 1975, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  Coe was not bashful about announcing that his tent was the largest in the world; bigger, he claimed, than the one [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]] used.&lt;ref name=h60&gt;Harrell 1975, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

Coe was co-editor of fellow evangelist [[Gordon Lindsay]]'s ''[[Voice of Healing]]'' magazine until 1950, when he began his own magazine, the ''Herald of Healing''. By 1956 its circulation was approximately 250,000.&lt;ref name=h60/&gt;  Coe also opened a children's orphanage&lt;ref name=h175&gt;Harrell 1975, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; and built a large church building known as the Dallas Revival Center.&lt;ref name=h61&gt;Harrell 1975, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack Coe’s first encounter with William Branham'''

"I was having a tent revival in San Antonio in 1945 when I heard that a man called [[William Branham]] was discerning people's hearts and praying for sick. Sometimes we think we are the only one doing something for God. When I heard about discernment, I thought that was fortune telling. So I decided to go find for myself what it was all about since he was in the same town I was. I tried to get in the healing line but failed. He was discerning people and declaring them healed. One man that he prayed for had no eyeballs at all and he told him that eyeballs will be formed in three days. I thought anybody could say that! So as William Branham finished praying for the people, they led him out using the door to where I was sitting nearby. As he reached close to me, he stopped instantly and laid his hands on me as he prayed silently. After that, he told me that I was not sick but that my body was just tired. Then he softly said "You were doubting whether this is of God or not, I want to tell you that this is of God and we are both fighting the same devil. Go on and continue in your revival for you were also called to pray for the sick." When I left that meeting it was like I was walking on clouds! After three days I decided to find out about that man without eyeballs. When I saw him, he was still blind but eyeballs had formed. It was now noon. And that night, after he fell asleep, he awoke around 7 pm and started running around shouting praises to the Lord because he was now seeing. From then on, I knew that Rev. Branham was no ordinary preacher but was called for a dispensational purpose"... 
By Evangelist Jack Coe.

==Conflict with denomination and controversy==
Coe’s revival messages centered upon healing, and he was adamant about not taking medicines and not visiting doctors.&lt;ref name=h62&gt;Harrell 1975, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, the Assemblies of God expelled him on the grounds that he was "misleading the public" and "antagonizing Dallas Civil Authorities". He was also accused of having an extravagant lifestyle and home. Upon hearing that, Coe printed pictures of four large homes owned by some top officials in the Assemblies of God and the smaller homes of himself and three other revivalists. Coe also charged that the Assemblies of God were "fighting divine healing". Other revivalists soon came into conflict with Pentecostal denominations as well.&lt;ref name=h111&gt;Harrell 1975, p. 111–112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coe's arrest and case dismissed==
Coe taught and preached fervently on divine healing, claiming to have healed visitors to his revivals. In a 1955 revival service in [[Miami, Florida]], Coe told the parents of a three-year-old boy that he had healed their son of [[polio]].&lt;ref name=arrest&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0040/6776104/33436272_clean.html |title=Faith healer Dies- Victim of Bulbar Polio |publisher=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|Daily Courier]] |date=December 18, 1956 |first= |last= |accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coe then told the parents to remove the boy's [[leg braces]].&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt; However, the boy was not cured, and removing the braces left him in constant pain.&lt;ref name=arrest/&gt; As a result, Coe was arrested and on February 6, 1956 and was charged with practicing medicine without a license, a felony in the state of Florida. A judge dismissed the case on grounds that Florida exempts divine healing from the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Week In Religion |publisher=[[Walla Walla Union-Bulletin]] |date=July 1, 1956 |first= |last= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=etsOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CXYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7419,2676337&amp;dq=jack-coe+dismissed |title=Charges Against Texas Faith Healer Dismissed |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=February 21, 1956 |first= |last= |accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/121256820.html?dids=121256820:121256820&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=FEB+21%2C+1956&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;desc='Faith+Healer'+Cleared+Of+Illegal+Practice&amp;pqatl=google |title='Faith Healer' Cleared Of Illegal Practice |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date=February 21, 1956 |first= |last= |accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death==
In November, a few months after the charges were dismissed, Coe became sick while in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]].&lt;ref name="Coe Ill"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newspaperarchive.com/newspapers1/na0001/654218/7504003_clean.html |title=Faith Healer Ill |publisher=[[Reno Evening Gazette]] |date=November 27, 1956 |first= |last= |accessdate =2007-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Texas and underwent a [[tracheotomy]] to help his breathing after his muscles became paralyzed.&lt;ref name="Coe Ill"/&gt; He was diagnosed with bulbar polio, and died a few weeks later at [[Dallas]]' [[Parkland Hospital]] on December 16, 1956.

==Background and education==
Muyingo was born on 22 February 1960 to John Chrysestom Ssekidde of Kakoola Village, Bamunanika County, [[Luwero District]] and Victoria Nakiwala of [[Naakulabye]], [[Lubaga Division]], in [[Kampala]], Uganda's capital. He attended the Mulajje Primary School, Kisubi Seminary, and [[Makerere College School]], before joining [[Makerere University]] in 1983. He graduated in 1986 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] with a Diploma in Education. He also holds a [[Masters degree|Master]] of Arts in Educational Management, obtained in 1996, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] obtained in 2004, both from Makerere University. The dissertation for his doctorate focused on the financing of university education in Uganda.&lt;ref name="Member"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography"&gt;{{cite web | last=JCMF | url=http://www.jcmuyingo.org/biograhpy.html | title=Biography of John C. Muyingo PhD | publisher=John Chrysostom Muyingo Foundation (JCMF) | date=2013 | accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Muyingo started his teaching career at Ndejje Secondary School where he taught chemistry and mathematics. He later taught at St. Joseph’s School Nsambya where he became director of studies. He was then transferred to St. Joseph Secondary School Naggalama, in [[Naggalama]], [[Mukono District]].

At Naggalama he became [[headmaster]] when the school was still O-Level only (S1 - S4). He started a boarding section for boys at [[Naggalama|Naggalama Hill]], despite initial reservations by the school board. He then started an A-Level section at the school (S5 - S6). From Naggalama, he was transferred in 1992 to [[Uganda Martyrs' Secondary School Namugongo]], located adjacent to the [[Uganda Martyrs|Uganda Martyrs Shine]] at [[Namugongo]].

When he arrived at Namugongo, his first challenge was to upgrade and improve the school, then in a sorry state. The teachers would go home on Friday and return on Monday, leaving students on their own over the weekend. The infrastructure was poor, the classes inadequate, and there was no serious science lab. Male teachers were fratenising with female students. The school's [[Board of Governors]] had little interest in the school. Gradually, the new headmaster’s efforts paid off. The year before he joined, the school had registered five first grades at O-level. In 1992, the number rose to 32, then 58 in 1993, 64 in 1994 and 90 in 1995. Henceforth, the numbers steadily rose with some years registering a 100 percent first grade pass rate. He served in that capacity from 1992 until 2010.&lt;ref name="Member"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biography"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date=8 January 2006 | accessdate=15 February 2015 | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/9/35/475062 | title=New Salary Scheme To Tackle Teachers' Woes | newspaper=[[New Vision]] (Kampala) | first=Irene | last=Nabusoba | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215205647/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/9/35/475062 | archivedate=15 February 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
In 2011, Muyingo entered active politics by contesting for the parliamentary seat of Bamunanika County in [[Luweero District]], as an Independent. He won that seat with 92 percent of the votes cast and is the [[incumbent]] [[Parliament of Uganda|Member of Parliament]] for that constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/9/803/739340 | title=Former Buganda Education Minister Eyes Bamunanika | date=25 November 2010 | accessdate=15 February 2015 | first=Frederick | last=Kiwanuka | newspaper=[[New Vision]] (Kampala) | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215215836/http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/9/803/739340 | archivedate=15 February 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has various ongoing projects in his constituency aimed at boosting the livelihood of his people. He is assisted by Mwebe William,  Matabi Christopher, and Bazira Paul who lead the coordination team. They have steered a number of successful projects such as a pioneer elderly project the only of that kind in Uganda, a scholarship scheme called BACEF headed by Ssenyonjo Moses, the director of St. Mary's College Lugazi and assisted by Matabi Christopher and Bazira Paul. It has helped over 2500 less privileged students to access secondary education. He was appointed State Minister for Higher Education on 27 May 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Personal details==
While at [[Uganda Martyrs' Secondary School Namugongo]], Muyingo met Rosemary Namayanja, whom he married in 1992. They have six children. She is the [[Director (education)|Director]] at ''Seeta High Schools'', in [[Seeta, Uganda|Seeta]], [[Mukono District]]. The Muyingo family own ''Seeta High Schools''. They are now three in total with a total of approximately 4,500 students all combined. They have also opened up two primary sections under the name Seeta Junior School and also have a Kindergarten wing with two branches. Away from school administration matters, Muyingo is popularly referred to as ‘Musajja wa Kabaka’ (Kabaka’s right-hand man).

      <comment>/* Reception */ Citing proponents of IS as "reception" is irrelevant, because it's obvious what their opinion is.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7427">'''Letter to Baghdadi''' is an open letter to [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], the leader of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]] as a theological refutation of the practices of [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to Baghdadi|url=http://www.lettertobaghdadi.com|website=Letter to Baghdadi|accessdate=23 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is signed by numerous [[ulema|Muslim theologian]]s, [[lawmakers]] and community leaders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hussain|first1=Murtaza|title=The Atlantic Ignores Muslim Intellectuals, Defines "True Islam" As Isis|url=https://theintercept.com/2015/02/20/atlantic-defines-real-islam-says-isis/|accessdate=23 March 2016|agency=The Intercept|publisher=The Intercept|date=20 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The letter includes a technical point-by-point refutation of [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]]'s actions and ideology based on the [[Quran|Qur'an]] and other classical texts, using a style that is unfamiliar to [[Liberal Islam|liberal]] or even uninformed [[Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ioannou|first1=Filipa|title=Scholars’ Open Letter Adds to Chorus of Muslim Leaders Condemning ISIS|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/09/25/muslims_scholars_open_letter_to_isis_baghdadi_caliphate_s_actions_against.html|accessdate=23 March 2016|agency=Religion News Service|publisher=The Slate|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In September 2014, the letter, initially signed by 122 [[Muslim]] scholars&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; from around the world and was presented at [[Washington, D.C.]] by [[Nihad Awad]] of the [[Council on American Islamic Relations]]. Stating that the purpose of the letter was not to warn [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]] but to dissuade potential radicals from joining the ranks [[ISIS|Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]], he said:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"You have misinterpreted Islam into a religion of harshness, brutality, torture and murder". "This is a great wrong and an offense to Islam, to [[Muslims]] and to the entire world."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Summary==
*Islam forbids the issuing of fatwas without all the necessary learning requirements. One must consider the entire [[Qur’an]] and [[Hadith]], when delivering them;

*It is forbidden in Islam to ignore the reality of contemporary times when deriving legal rulings.
*Islam forbids killing of the innocent, emissaries, [[ambassadors]], and diplomats; hence it is forbidden to kill journalists and aid workers.

*Islam forbids to deny women and children their rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Enacting [[hudud|legal punishments]] without following the correct procedures that ensure justice and mercy.
*It is [[haraam]] to [[mutilate]] the dead and to torture people.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/international-coalition-of-muslim-scholars-refute-isis-religious-arguments-in-open-letter-to-al-baghdadi-127032/|title=International Coalition of Muslim Scholars Refute ISIS' Religious Arguments in Open Letter to al-Baghdadi|last=Smith|first=Samuel|date=25 September 2014|website=|publisher=The Christian Post|access-date=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*It is forbidden in [[Islam]] to attribute evil acts to [[Allah]].
*Armed insurrection ([[baghy]]) is forbidden in [[Islam]] for any reason other than clear disbelief by the ruler and not allowing people to pray.

==Reception==
[[Huffington Post]] said that the open letter is "meticulously blasting its ([[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]]) ideology."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim Scholars Release Open Letter To Islamic State Meticulously Blasting Its Ideology|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/24/muslim-scholars-islamic-state_n_5878038.html|accessdate=23 March 2016|agency=[[Huffington Post]]|publisher=[[Huffington Post]]|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lis Hartel''' (March 14, 1921 – February 12, 2009) was an equestrian from Denmark.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/15/local/me-passings15.S2 OBITUARIES / PASSINGS / Lis Hartel - Los Angeles Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/lis-hartel Lis HARTEL | Olympic Athlete | Helsinki 1952, Melbourne Stockholm 1956&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She was originally coached by her mother, Else Holst, but began to be coached by professional horseman Gunnar Andersen when she became nationally competitive.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ha/lis-hartel-1.html Lis Hartel Bio, Stats, and Results | Olympics at Sports-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was the Danish [[dressage]] champion in 1943 and 1944.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/sport/olympics/article773434.ece 100 greatest Olympic moments: Rider blazes trail for polio victims | The Sunday Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1944 at age 23 she contracted [[polio]], which permanently paralyzed her below the knees, as well as affecting her arms and hands.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3nE0AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT141&amp;lpg=PT141&amp;dq=%22lis+hartel%22+obituary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rGsHBZlUPG&amp;sig=euPXGgIs83N8O7Q9wa0nYW-MGrE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4jLmU6-xB4KbyATl-oCgDg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22lis%20hartel%22%20obituary&amp;f=false Fields of Courage: The Bravest Chapters in Sport - Max Davidson - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; She was pregnant at the time, but had a healthy daughter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/olympics/reflections/article-9397307 Reflections on Glory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Hartel was determined to continue her equestrian career despite medical advice otherwise, and in 1947 she finished second at the Scandinavian championships, although she had to be helped onto her horse when she rode.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2009/02/14/lis_hartel_87_equestrian_won_silver_medals_despite_paralysis/ Lis Hartel, 87; equestrian won silver medals despite paralysis - The Boston Globe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dressage at the Olympics was open only to commissioned military officers until 1952, and in that year Hartel was one of the first women to compete against men in an equestrian sport at the Olympics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Her silver medal in 1952 for Individual Dressage was the first by any woman in any individual sport when in direct competition with men at the Olympics, and she was also the Danish champion in dressage that year.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; She continued to be Danish champion in dressage in 1953, 1954, 1956 and 1959.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In 1956 she also won another silver medal, this time at the 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia (the Equestrian Games of those Olympics were held in Stockholm because of Australian quarantine laws for horses).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/equestrian/1956/ 1956 Stockholm Equestrian Games | Olympics at Sports-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After retiring from competitive riding, Hartel gave demonstrations, raising money for polio sufferers and supporting therapeutic riding for people with disabilities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Lis Hartel Foundation in the Netherlands, named after her, offers such riding opportunities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In 1992 Hartel was inducted into Denmark's Hall of Fame, and in 2005 she was named one of Denmark's top 10 athletes of all time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

'''Charlotte Ida Anna "Lotte" Stam-Beese''' (January 28, 1903 - November 18, 1988) was a [[Germany|German-Dutch]] [[architect]] and [[urban planner]] who helped with the reconstruction of [[Rotterdam]] after [[World War II]].

==Life and work==
Beese was born in [[Reisicht]], [[Silesia, Germany]] (now [[Rokitki, Tczew County]], [[Poland]]).&lt;ref name=bauhaus/&gt; As a young adult she first found work as a [[weaving|weaver]] in [[Dresden]].&lt;ref name=bauhaus/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bosma|first=John|date=2014|title=Beese, Charlotte Ida Anna|url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/vrouwenlexicon/lemmata/data/Beese|journal=Digitaal Vrouwenlexicon van Nederland|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1926, she attended the [[Bauhaus]] school, where she studied with [[Josef Albers]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Joost Schmidt]], and [[Gunta Stölzl]]. She enrolled to study the more "feminine" subject of weaving, but later, Beese got accepted into an architecture course from [[Hannes Meyer|Hans Emil (Hannes) Meyer]] as the first woman to study in the building department of Bauhaus Dessau. Compared to his predecessor, Meyer was less prejudiced about the idea of women studying subjects that were dominated by and previously reserved for men.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oosterhof|first=J.|date=2017|title=Lotte Stam-Beese (1903-1988) : from 'Entwurfsarchitektin' to urban-planning architect.|url=https://pure.tue.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/71366190/A_U_1_2_2017_Oosterhof.pdf|journal=Architektúra &amp; Urbanizmus|volume=51(1-2)|pages=94-105|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beese was a good student but Meyer was not convinced of Beese’s future prospects, unless she would marry a male architect and work for his firm. Meyer, Bauhaus-director and a married man with two children, and Beese started a love affair.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite the school’s liberal climate, the affair was not approved of, and in December 1928, Meyer suggested Beese to leave Bauhaus, which she did.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/109446|title=Lotte Stam-Beese|last=RKD - Nederland Instituut voor Kunstgeschiedenis|first=|date=October 11, 1996|website=RKD|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer hired Beese at his office in Berlin, but she was dissatisfied. He then tried to find Beese another job through his network, in vain. She was turned down by Walter Traulau, because, as indicated in a letter to his friend, he did not 'like working with women'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Later, she followed him to Moscow, where she also met [[Mart Stam]], whom she would later marry. Although reuniting with Meyer had not been a success, she had become pregnant. She moved back to Brno, to continue her work at Bohuslav Fuchs’ architecture firm, and gave birth in Brno to her son, Peter.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Beese took Fuchs to court because he, as correspondence with a lawyer reveals, refused to pay the necessary allowance for the three months' maternity leave that he had offered. She did not return to his firm, and, given her status as a single mother and the deepening economic crisis, she struggled to find new work in Brno.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Later, Beese left to Ukraine and ran into her former Bauhaus lecturer and Dutch architect [[Mart Stam]], with whom she started a love affair. Due to difficulties that were arising from the changing climate of the USSR, Stam and Beese decided to marry before moving to the Netherlands in 1934.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In Amsterdam, the couple set up their own firm, Stam en Beese Architecten, and in 1935, they had a daughter, Ariane. Because of her early departure at the Bauhaus, she had never received a diploma. This made it harder for her to become an architect in the Netherlands, due to the union's pressure to the Association of Dutch Architects to dismiss non-graduates from the professional world before the end of  the year, in 1940. That year, at age 37, she got admitted to start a degree in architecture at the VHBO in Amsterdam, due to her unique prior experience.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lotte Stam-Beese 1903-1988|last=Damen &amp; Devolder|first=|publisher=Rotterdamse Kunststichting|year=1993|isbn=|location=Rotterdam|pages=20-21, 24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of her studies and the care for two children added pressure on her marriage with Stam. In 1943, they divorced, after Stam committed adultery.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, Lotte Stam-Beese decided to keep Stam's name, because the affiliation with his last name could give her a head start as an independent female architect in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/106946/Rotterdammers-van-Formaat-Lotte-Stam|title=Rotterdammers van Formaat: Lotte Stam|last=|first=|date=August 30, 2013|work=RTV Rijnmond|access-date=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated in 1945.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

From 1946-1968, Beese worked as an urban-planning architect, and later as chief architect, for the Agency for Urban Development and Reconstruction of Rotterdam, [[German bombing of Rotterdam|which had been heavily bombed]] in 1940 during the Second World War.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She was one of the few women who made such a huge contribution to the reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=50/50 Vrouwen bouwen aan Rotterdam 1945-1995|last=de Wit|first=Mieke|publisher=|year=1995|isbn=|location=Rotterdam|pages=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designing in a Functionalist style and influenced by the planning ideologies of the [[Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne|CIAM]] association, Beese worked on several (social) housing districts around the city, including Kleinpolder (1946-1952), Pendrecht (1948-1952), Westpunt in Hoogvliet (1956-1957), het Lage Land (1961-1962) and Alexanderpolder/Ommoord (1957-1971).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She included the 'neighborhood concept' (wijkgedachte) and 'cluster' (wooneenheid) in her plan for Pendrecht, which is considered to be her most significant architectural contribution.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women - Architecture &amp; Design Itineraries across Europe|last=MoMoWo|first=|publisher=France Stele Institute of Art History ZRC SAZU|year=2016|isbn=|location=Ljubljana, Turin|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood concept referred to the neighborhood as a self-supporting geographical unit, a city within a city, with a social structure and community reminiscent of that of a village.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Use Matters: An Alternative History of Architecture|last=Cupers|first=Kenny|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|location=New York|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the post-war reconstruction, the neighborhood idea became a widely employed model  for the creation of communities and the harmonious ordering of society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The cluster was a form of spatial organization with a physical and social connection between each home and the neighborhood as a whole. Beese introduced a small-scale unit, the 'stamp' (stempel), to represent a microcosm of the larger community. The design of each stamp was tailored to the needs of different categories of residents such as families, single dwellers and elderly. The spatial arrangement of the freestanding blocks of different heights also reflected the social diversity. Shopping centers, schools and churches of different denominations were divided over the neighborhoods, with some traffic-free streets in between. Buildings were separated by communal gardens and strips of greenery, with the hope that residents of these different stamps would meet and interact in the open spaces. The diversity of residents in a small-scale district would be representative of an open, democratic society, with a close-knit neighborhood quality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.architectureguide.nl/project/list_projects_of_architect/arc_id/12/prj_id/291|title=Urban Design Pendrecht|last=|first=|date=|website=Architecture Guide|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ontwerp en Politiek, Design and Politics|last=Ovink and Wieringa|first=|publisher=010 Publishers|year=2009|isbn=|location=Rotterdam|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the following decades, the idea of the neighborhood unit had been abandoned and large parts of Pendrecht were modified or torn down.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Before beginning her career as an architect, Beese was a successful [[photographer]]. Though she only worked with the medium professionally for a short period from 1926-1928, her work had a disproportionate impact and is now held in the collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York,&lt;ref name=moma/&gt; [[Arthur M. Sackler Museum]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} and the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/artists/1367/lotte-beese-german-1903-1988/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luke Daniel Harding'''  is a British journalist who is a [[foreign correspondent (journalism)|foreign correspondent]] for ''[[The Guardian]]''. He was based in [[Russia]] for ''The Guardian'' from 2007 until, returning from a stay in the UK on 5 February 2011, he was refused re-entry to Russia and deported back the same day.&lt;ref&gt;Luke Harding (23 September 2011). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/23/luke-harding-russia "Enemy of the state"], ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' said his expulsion was linked with his critical articles on Russia,&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;Dan Sabbagh (9 February 2011). [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/09/russia-deportation-guardian-journalist "Russia U-turns over Guardian journalist's deportation"], ''[[The Guardian]]'.'&lt;/ref&gt; a claim denied by the Russian government. After the reversal of the decision on 9 February and the granting of a short-term [[Visa (document)|visa]], Harding chose not to seek a further visa extension.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; His 2011 book ''[[Mafia State (book)|Mafia State]]'' discusses his experience in Russia and the political system under [[Vladimir Putin]], which he describes as a [[mafia state]].

==Early life and career==
Harding graduated with an [[International Baccalaureate]] diploma from UWC [[Atlantic College]], South Wales and studied English at [[University College, Oxford]]. While there he edited the student newspaper ''[[Cherwell (newspaper)|Cherwell]]''. He worked for ''[[The Sunday Correspondent]]'', the ''[[The Argus (Brighton)|Evening Argus]]'' in Brighton and then the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' before joining ''The Guardian'' in 1996.&lt;ref name=reutersinstitute-bio&gt;{{cite web |url=https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/people/luke-harding |title=Luke Harding |publisher=Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism |accessdate=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has lived in and reported from [[Delhi]], [[Berlin]], and [[Moscow]], and has covered wars in [[Afghanistan]], [[Iraq]], and [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lukeharding Luke Harding's contributor page], theguardian.com&lt;/ref&gt; In  2014 he was the recipient of the James Cameron prize for his work on Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[WikiLeaks]], and [[Edward Snowden]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/26/guardian-luke-harding-james-cameron-prize-wikileaks-ukraine-snowden "Guardian’s Luke Harding wins prestigious James Cameron prize"], "[[The Guardian]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian expulsion==
In February 2011, Harding was refused re-entry into Russia. According to Harding, this made him the first foreign journalist to be expelled from Russia since the end of the [[Cold War]]. ''The Guardian'' said his expulsion was linked with his unflattering coverage of Russia, including speculation about [[Vladimir Putin]]'s wealth and Putin's knowledge of the London assassination of ex-Russian spy [[Alexander Litvinenko]].&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; The director of [[Index on Censorship]], [[John Kampfner]], said "The Russian government's treatment of Luke Harding is petty and vindictive, and evidence – if more was needed – of the poor state of free expression in that country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/feb/07/guardian-moscow-correspondent-expelled-from-russia ''Guardian's Moscow correspondent expelled from Russia''], ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Elsa Vidal, head of the European and Central Asia desk at the media freedom watchdog, was quoted in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' as saying: "This is a serious and shocking step, unprecedented since the Cold War [...] It's an attempt to force correspondents working for foreign media in Moscow to engage in self-censorship."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/08/AR2011020803769.html ''Russia expels U.K. reporter Luke Harding, who covered corruption''], ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on the following day, Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergei Lavrov]] explained at a press conference that no visa cancellation had taken place and the problem had been caused by the fact that Harding's visa had expired, a statement disputed by Harding due to his visa being valid until May of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/lukeharding1968/status/737282233447415808|title=Luke Harding on Twitter|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lavrov, Harding had requested an exceptional visa extension until May which was approved. Lavrov also added that Harding had previously broken the rules of his press accreditation by visiting the area of [[counter-terrorism]] operations without informing the relevant security authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/media/20110208/331950001.html|title=Лавров: Люк Хардинг неоднократно нарушал правила аккредитации в России|date=8 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expulsion preceded a visit to Britain by Lavrov, which led to suggestions from [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Chris Bryant]] that the British government might rescind Lavrov's invitation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/feb/08/russia-visit-guardian-journalist-expelled ''Call to halt Russian foreign minister's visit after Guardian journalist expelled''], The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 February, Russia reversed the decision not to re-admit him&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; although it only granted him a short term visa. Harding chose not to seek a further visa and returned to the UK in February. Harding has said that during his time in Russia he was the subject of largely psychological harassment by the [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|Federal Security Service]], whom he alleges were unhappy at the stories he wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Enemy of the state |author=Luke Harding |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/23/luke-harding-russia |newspaper=The Guardian |date=23 September 2011 |accessdate=25 September 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==WikiLeaks==
In 2011, a book written by Harding and [[David Leigh (journalist)|David Leigh]] was published by Vintage Books in the US and Guardian Faber in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/review-wikileaks-inside-julian-assanges-war-on-secrecy-by-david-leigh-and-luke-harding-26715172.html "Review: Wikileaks: Inside Julian Assange's War On Secrecy by David Leigh and Luke Harding"], ''The Independent'' (Eire), 18 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[WikiLeaks: Inside Julian Assange's War on Secrecy]]'' was made into a Hollywood film, ''[[The Fifth Estate (film)|The Fifth Estate]]'' (2013). WikiLeaks condemned the film, stating that its depiction of Assange rushing to publication with no redactions was false.

On November 27, 2018, Harding co-authored a piece for ''The Guardian'' claiming that Julian Assange and [[Paul Manafort]] had become familiar in the course of meetings at the Ecuadorian embassy. Commentators including [[Preet Bharara]] and [[Benjamin Wittes]] stated that they would be interested in seeing more evidence as the sources in Harding's piece were described only as "sources". Manafort and Assange both denied ever having met with the latter threatening legal action against ''The Guardian''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2018/11/the-guardian-paul-manafort-julian-assange|title="It might be the biggest get this year": How the Guardian's bombshell set off its own little media world war|first=Joe|last=Pompeo|publisher=Vanity Fair|date=2018-11-27|accessdate=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Edward Snowden==
{{main|The Snowden Files}}
Harding's book on [[Edward Snowden]], ''[[The Snowden Files]]'' (2014), received a glowing review from ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}s [[Michiko Kakutani]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/books/the-snowden-files-by-luke-harding.html?_r=1 "The Needles in the Monumental N.S.A. Haystack ‘The Snowden Files,’ by Luke Harding"] ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; who noted that it “reads like a le Carré novel crossed with something by Kafka. .  A fast-paced, almost novelistic narrative. . .. [The book] gives readers . .  a succinct overview of the momentous events of the past year. . . . Leave[s] readers with an acute understanding of the serious issues involved”. Additionally, it received positive reviews from several other major publications, including ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/feb/13/snowden-files-luke-harding-review|title=The Snowden Files by Luke Harding – review|first=David|last=Runciman|date=13 February 2014|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[London Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n04/daniel-soar/incendiary-devices Daniel Soar reviews ‘The Snowden Files’ by Luke Harding · LRB 20 February 2014] – '[[The London Review of Books]]'&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-snowden-files-the-inside-story-of-the-worlds-most-wanted-man-by-luke-harding/2014/02/14/60df3c66-934f-11e3-84e1-27626c5ef5fb_story.html "Opinions ‘The Snowden Files: The Inside Story of the World’s Most Wanted Man’ by Luke Harding"] ''[[The Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a mixed review from ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'s'' [[David Blair (journalist)|David Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/10628503/The-Snowden-Files-by-Luke-Harding-review.html|title=The Snowden Files by Luke Harding, review|first=David|last=Blair|date=11 February 2014|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adapted into a film, ''[[Snowden (film)|Snowden]]'', directed by [[Oliver Stone]] and starring [[Joseph Gordon-Levitt]], released in September 2016.

==Alexander Litvinenko==
In 2016, Harding published ''A Very Expensive Poison'', an account of the [[Poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko|murder of the Russian ex-KGB whistle-blower]] and outspoken Putin critic [[Alexander Litvinenko]]. The book garnered a positive response from reviewers, including from the ''[[The Spectator|Spectator]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/03/the-litvinenko-case-mayfair-murder-most-foul/|title=The Litvinenko case: Mayfair murder most foul - The Spectator|date=26 March 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/29/a-very-expensive-poison-by-luke-harding-review-definitive|title=A Very Expensive Poison review – definitive account of Litvinenko murder |publisher=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times|Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/a-very-expensive-poison-by-luke-harding-w9jg6rh82|title=A Very Expensive Poison by Luke Harding|first=Michael|last=Burleigh|date=19 March 2016|publisher=|via=www.thetimes.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[London Review of Books]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n07/peter-pomerantsev/murder-in-mayfair|title=Murder in Mayfair|first=Peter|last=Pomerantsev|date=31 March 2016|publisher=|pages=3–6|via=London Review of Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Fox, writing for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'' called it 'one of the best political thrillers [he had] come across in years'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/books/a-very-expensive-poison-the-definitive-story-of-the-murder-of-litvinenko-and-russia-s-war-with-the-a3200626.html|title=A Very Expensive Poison by Luke Harding - review|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' [[Lucy Prebble]] has adapted the book for the stage, with the play due to première in [[The Old Vic]] theatre, London in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/29/alexander-litvinenko-murder-adapted-for-stage-lucy-prebble-luke-harding|title=Spies, assassins and strip clubs: death of Alexander Litvinenko adapted for stage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Donald Trump and Russia==

A public memorial service for [[Michael Jackson]]&lt;!--NOTE: Per WP:BOLDTITLE, the title should not be bolded in this case.--&gt; was held on 7 July 2009 at the [[Staples Center]] in [[Los Angeles]], California, twelve days after [[Death of Michael Jackson|his death]]. The event was preceded by a private family service at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills)#Court of Liberty|Forest Lawn Memorial Park's Hall of Liberty]] in [[Hollywood Hills]], and followed by a gathering in [[Beverly Hills]] for Jackson's family and close friends.

Jackson's closed, solid-bronze casket, plated with 14-karat gold and lined with blue velvet, which was not originally expected to be at the memorial service, arrived just before 10:00 a.m. local time, when it was placed in front of the stage. The memorial began a few minutes after 10:30 a.m. with music and a [[eulogy]] from [[Pastor]] Lucious Smith. The stage was filled with floral arrangements, with photographs and film of Jackson and [[the Jackson 5]] projected onto screens at the back. Music and video montages traced his life from the beginning of his career to the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=TVGuideNews| title=Top Moments: Michael Jackson Memorial | url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Jackson-Memorial-Moments-1007748.aspx | work=TVGuide.com | date=July 7, 2009 | accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson's brothers, sitting in the front row, each wore a single white [[sequin]]ed glove in tribute to their brother. [[Mariah Carey]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Lionel Richie]], [[Jennifer Hudson]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Jermaine Jackson]], and [[Shaheen Jafargholi]] sang Jackson's songs, and [[John Mayer]] played guitar. [[Berry Gordy]], [[Brooke Shields]], and [[Smokey Robinson]] gave eulogies, while [[Queen Latifah]] read "We Had Him", a poem written for the occasion by [[Maya Angelou]].&lt;!--please don't wikilink all the city names--&gt;
The Reverend [[Al Sharpton]] received a standing ovation when he told Jackson's children, "Wasn't nothing strange about your daddy. It was strange what your daddy had to deal with."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/07/07/there-was-nothing-strange-about-your-daddy|title=Video of Sharpton's eulogy|work=Macleans|date=July 7, 2009|publisher=macleans.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the end, the family gathered on stage to offer the final eulogies. Jackson's then-11-year-old daughter, Paris, while unable to give her speech without crying, told the crowd, "I just want to say, ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine, and I just want to say I love him... so much."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2009/jul/07/michaeljackson|title= Liveblogging Michael Jackson's funeral and memorial service|work=The Guardian|date=July 7, 2009 | location=London | first=Oliver | last=Burkeman | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an emotional [[Marlon Jackson]] said, "Maybe now, Michael, they will leave you alone."&lt;ref name=BBCJuly7&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8137700.stm|title=Emotional farewell to King of Pop|work=BBC News|publisher=bbcnews.com|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=September 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

up to a million fans were expected to congregate outside Staples Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/celeb/articles/2009/07/03/20090703michael-jacksons-starstudded-memorial.html |title=One million fans expected at Michael Jackson memorial|publisher=azcentral.com |date=July 3, 2009 |accessdate=July 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Starmagazine7&gt;.{{cite web|url=http://www.starmagazine.com/michael_jackson_memorial/news/15798|work=Star Magazine|date=July 3, 2009|title=1 Million Expected at Jackson's Star-Studded Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States viewership was extremely high taking into consideration that the service was unusually held on a workday (Tuesday) and a host of people reported watching the service during work.

==Service==
The service began with [[Smokey Robinson]] reading messages of condolences from [[Diana Ross]] and former [[President of South Africa|South African President]] [[Nelson Mandela]]. A gospel choir sang [[Andrae Crouch]]'s "Soon and Very Soon" as Jackson's casket entered (culminating around the line "you will see the King"), followed by statements from Pastor Lucious Smith. [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Trey Lorenz]] then sang "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]", a number one single for both [[The Jackson 5]] and Carey and Lorenz. This was followed by a statement from [[Queen Latifah]], who also read "We Had Him", a poem written by [[Maya Angelou]] for the occasion. [[Lionel Richie]], Jackson's friend and his co-writer on "[[We Are the World]]", performed the song "[[Heroes (Commodores album)|Jesus Is Love]]" by [[The Commodores]]. In the eulogy of [[Berry Gordy]], founder of [[Motown Records]], he stated, "In fact, the more I think and talk about Michael Jackson, I feel the King of Pop is not big enough for him. I think he is simply the greatest entertainer that ever lived." The statement was met with the longest standing ovation of the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Farewell to a King|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20292614,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810203619/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20292614,00.html|dead-url=no|archive-date=August 10, 2009|work=People |date=July 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 26, 2009}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BERRY GORDY - GORDY BRINGS MOURNERS TO THEIR FEET WITH JACKSON TRIBUTE|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/gordy-brings-mourners-to-their-feet-with-jackson-tribute_1108973|work=Contact Music |date=July 7, 2009 |accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Jackson hailed as greatest entertainer, best dad|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE5615KN20090708|work=Reuters UK |date=July 8, 2009 |accessdate=November 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MichaelJacksonMemorial 05.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A crowd of spectators gathering outside the Staples Center during the memorial service.]]

A video montage of Michael Jackson's life followed. [[Stevie Wonder]] spoke, played a small portion of "I Can't Help It", a song from ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'' that Wonder co-wrote, then performed a version of his songs "[[Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer]]" and "[[They Won't Go When I Go]]".  Next [[Kobe Bryant]] spoke about Jackson's humanitarian work, and [[Magic Johnson]] (who had appeared in the music video for "[[Remember the Time]]") recalled his memories of Jackson. Accompanied by a dancing chorus, [[Jennifer Hudson]] performed "[[Will You Be There]]" a song Jackson wrote and performed for the 1993 film ''[[Free Willy]]'' which is also from his ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' album, along with the dancers who would have been on stage with Jackson for his O2 concerts. [[John Mayer]] played guitar on a mainly instrumental version of "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]" from Jackson's ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]''. [[Brooke Shields]] then spoke about the personal time she spent with Jackson, read excerpts from ''[[The Little Prince]]'', and said that his favorite song was [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s "[[Smile (Charlie Chaplin song)|Smile]]", which was then performed by [[Jermaine Jackson]].

[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s children, [[Martin Luther King III|Martin III]] and [[Bernice King|Bernice]], then stated that Michael Jackson was the best that he could be. [[Sheila Jackson-Lee]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Texas's 18th congressional district|Texas]], Houston), representing the [[United States House of Representatives]], emphasized that in the US, people are "[[innocent until proven guilty]]" (as the crowd cheered) then spoke about his "American story" plus his meetings with foreign diplomats, and that "Michael never stopped giving". She then went on to claim him as an American legend and world humanitarian (House Resolution 600&lt;ref&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.RES.600:&lt;/ref&gt;), closing her speech with a military salute as she said, "Michael Jackson, I salute you." [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] walked to the casket and then sang Larry Grossman and Buzz Kohan's "[[Gone Too Soon]]", which Jackson recorded as a tribute for [[Ryan White]] after his death; Usher cried near the end of the song as he placed his hand on the casket, but managed to finish. Following Usher, a clip from ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1969 featuring the Jackson 5's rendition of [[The Miracles]]' "[[Who's Lovin' You]]" was shown. Following this, the song's composer and Miracles lead singer, [[Smokey Robinson]], spoke about and made joking remarks about the Jackson 5 covering his song, and continued with a speech. [[Shaheen Jafargholi]] from ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' then performed the song.

Jackson choreographer [[Kenny Ortega]] presented Jafargholi, honored Jackson, and introduced the final performance of the memorial, which Jackson had been slated to perform during the ''[[This Is It (Michael Jackson concerts)|This Is It]]'' dates. The concerts' chorus singers, Darrell Phinnessee, Ken Stacey, [[Dorian Holley]], [[Judith Hill]] and guitarist [[Orianthi]] performed "[[We Are the World]]" and were joined on the stage by several of the guest speakers and performers as well as the Jackson family for the final chorus. With the entire group still on stage, Hill then led a performance of "[[Heal the World]]", with the remainder of the group joining in the chorus. Jackson's family then addressed the crowd. Jermaine&amp;mdash;who had earlier performed a tearful rendition of "Smile"&amp;mdash;gave a brief speech, followed by a eulogy by [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]], where he tributed his stillborn twin brother Brandon, who died at birth, telling his younger brother to "give him a hug" for himself as a favor. Marlon then handed the microphone over to [[Janet Jackson|Janet]], but in a move that came as a surprise to the show's organizers, she said that her niece, Paris, had something to say. Surrounded by her paternal aunts and uncles, Paris emotionally addressed the crowd before collapsing in tears and being escorted off the stage by her family:

{{cquote|I just want to say. Ever since I was born, Daddy has been the best father you could ever imagine...and I just want to say I love him... so much.}}

[[Image:MichaelJacksonMemorial 01.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Outside the Staples Center during the memorial service.]]

Marlon Jackson then thanked the crowd in attendance, and the family escorted the casket out of the arena while an instrumental version of "[[Man in the Mirror]]" was performed. A microphone placed center stage was lit by spotlight while the instrumental version of "Man in the Mirror" played out, symbolizing the 'absence' of Michael Jackson. Many in the crowd applauded and cheered as Michael Jackson's coffin was carried out of the building.  Pastor Lucious Smith closed the service with a prayer and quote saying "I'm alive and I'm here forever" from the [[Paul McCartney]]/[[Michael Jackson]] duet song ''[[Pipes of Peace|The Man]]''. The memorial was finished at 12:48 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8139422.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Reporters' log: Jackson memorial |publisher=BBC News |date= July 7, 2009|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Itzkoff |first=Dave |url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/07/watching-the-jackson-memorial/?hp |title=Live Blogging the Jackson Memorial - ArtsBeat Blog - NYTimes.com |publisher=Artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com |date=July 7, 2009 |accessdate=July 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|first2=Cara Mia|last2=DiMassa|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-michael-jackson-memorial8-2009jul08,0,4224405,print.story|title= Michael Jackson hailed during emotional memorial service|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 7, 2009|accessdate=September 3, 2009|publisher=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before broadcast of the service ended, a final slideshow of photos starting with Jackson's childhood and concluding with his final years played with Mariah Carey's version of "I'll Be There" playing.

===Casket===
Jackson was presented in a gold-plated solid bronze Promethean casket furnished by the [[Batesville Casket Company]], which cost roughly $25,000. It is similar to the one in which [[James Brown]] was buried.&lt;ref name=HarlowJuly5&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Harlow|title=Police target 30 in hunt for Michael Jackson’s drug suppliers|work=The Sunday Times|date=July 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casketsite.com/batesville/items/bronze/prometheanbronze.htm|title=Promethean Bronze|work=Caskets by Batesville}}&lt;/ref&gt; The closed casket at the Staples Center was decorated with red roses and [[Bells of Ireland]] flower arrangement. The casket was escorted by Jackson's brothers, each wearing a single sequined white glove on the hand in which they held the casket. Jackson was originally to be buried on what would have been his 51st birthday, however the services were postponed and he was interred at [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Cemetery]] in Glendale on September 3, 2009.

===Live broadcast===
The service was broadcast live around the world, from the U.S. to Slovakia to parts of Asia. Public screenings were held in 37 cinemas across the U.S., as well as in Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels, Bucharest, Gothenburg, Lisbon, London, Madrid, Malmö, Oslo, Paris, Milan, Seville, Stockholm, and Tallinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investor.cinedigm.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=394461|title=Broadcast of Jackson Memorial Service to Mann Chinese Six Theatre in Los Angeles, CA to Be Cancelled at Request of Los Angeles Police Department|work=Cinedigm Digital Cinema Corp.|date=July 7, 2009|publisher=cinedigm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a live broadcast at 3am in Melbourne, Australia at Federation Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jackson's world fans mourn idol before memorial|date=July 7, 2009|first=Jill|last=Lawless|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the event, the organizers expected an estimated one billion viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/07/08/AR2009070803095.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Lisa | last=de Moraes | title=Lisa De Moraes Column on Michael Jackson's Memorial Service | date=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vancouversun.com/Entertainment/Michael+Jackson+billion+people+estimated+watching+gold+plated+casket+memorial+service/1767503/story.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710103145/http://www.vancouversun.com/Entertainment/Michael+Jackson+billion+people+estimated+watching+gold+plated+casket+memorial+service/1767503/story.html |archivedate=July 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/32375160/ns/today-entertainment/]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]], 31.1 million Americans watched the service live on television;&lt;ref name="demoraes-ratings"&gt;{{cite news|url=

===Media coverage ===
According to [[Global Language Monitor]], the coverage from the death and aftermath to the funeral of Michael Jackson tops [[Pope John Paul II]] as No.1 media (noting the longer timeframe and contentious circumstances re. the former).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.languagemonitor.com/about/news/michael-jackson-funeral-tops-pope-john-paul-ii-as-no-1-media/|title=Michael Jackson funeral tops Pope John Paul II as No. 1 media|publisher=Global Language Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost===
Due to the [[Great Recession in the United States|economic downturn]] concerns at the time, the city of Los Angeles said the memorial had cost the city $1.4 million for 1,400 police officers, trash pick-up, sanitation, and traffic control. The city set up a webpage asking fans for donations to help with the expenses, though it kept crashing. City Attorney Carmen Trutanich said it would be wrong to expect taxpayers to finance a private event. "The city attorney does not want something like this happening again, the city paying for a private event," spokesman John Franklin told CNN. "That's especially in a cash-strapped city, where people have been [[furlough]]ed or even lost jobs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Alan|first2=Ahmed|last2=Saeed|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/07/09/jackson.wrap/index.html|title=More associates link Jackson to prescription drugs|work=CNN|date=July 8, 2009|publisher=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mufarrij ibn Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah al-Tayyi''' ({{floruit|ca. 977–1013}}), in some sources erroneously called '''Daghfal ibn Mufarrij''', was an emir of the [[Jarrahid]] family and leader of the [[Tayy]] tribe. Mufarrij was engaged in repeated rebellions against the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], which controlled southern [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] at the time. Although he was several times defeated and forced into exile, by the 990s Mufarrij managed to establish himself and his tribe as the ''de facto'' autonomous masters of much of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] around [[Ramlah]] (the district of ''[[Jund Filastin]]'') with Fatimid acquiescence. In 1011, another rebellion against Fatimid authority was more successful, and a short-lived Jarrahid-led [[Bedouin]] state was established in Palestine centred at Ramlah. The Bedouin even proclaimed a rival [[Caliph]] to the Fatimid [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]], in the person of the [[Alid]] [[Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far]]. Bedouin independence survived until 1013, when the Fatimids launched their counterattack. Their will to resist weakened by Fatimid bribes, the Bedouin were quickly defeated. At the same time Mufarrij died, possibly poisoned, and his sons quickly came to terms with the Fatimids. Among them, [[Hassan ibn Mufarrij al-Jarrah]] managed to succeed to his father's position, and became a major player in the politics of the region over the next decades.

== Early life and career ==
[[File:Syria in the 9th century.svg|thumb|right|250px|Map of Early Islamic Syria and its provinces in the 9th–10th centuries]]
Mufarrij was the son of Daghfal ibn al-Jarrah, a member of the [[Banu Tayy]] who was the first of the [[Jarrahid]] family to rise to prominence, as an ally of the [[Qarmatians]] in their wars with the [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimids]] in the early 970s.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=482}} During this time, the Jarrahids emerged to lead the Banu Tayy opposition to the first attempts by the Fatimids, who had just captured [[Egypt]], to impose their control over Palestine.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=336}}

Mufarrij first appears in the aftermath of the Battle of Ramlah in 977, where the Turkish ruler of [[Damascus]], [[Alptakin|Alptekin]], was defeated by the forces of the Fatimid caliph [[al-Aziz]]. Alptekin fled the field and almost died of thirst in the desert, until he was found by Mufarrij, who had in earlier times befriended him. Mufarrij rescued Alptekin and brought him to his home, but while his guest rested, he went to al-Aziz and betrayed Alptakin in exchange for the 100,000 [[gold dinar]]s the Caliph had promised as a reward for his capture.{{sfn|Canard|1991|pp=482–483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=351}}

Mufarrij next appears in 979, when the [[Hamdanid]] emir [[Abu Taghlib]] arrived in Palestine fleeing from the [[Buyid]] conquest of his domains in the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]], and became embroiled in the complex power struggles between the Fatimid government and local elites.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=272}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=354–355}} Abu Taghlib with his followers established himself in [[Jawlan]] and endeavoured to gain recognition by the Fatimids as governor of Damascus, but the rebel general al-Qassam, who held the city, repulsed him. Under attack by the Damascenes, and with members of his family starting to desert him, Abu Taghlib moved further south to the region of [[Lake Tiberias]]. Hoping to sow disunion among the Arab tribes and weaken their power to the benefit of the Fatimids, the local Fatimid general al-Fadl ibn Salih promised Ramlah to Abu Taghlib, even though he himself had previously handed Mufarrij a document from al-Aziz that gave the city to the Jarrahids.{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=354–355}}{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}} When Abu Taghlib, joined by Mufarrij's rivals, the [[Banu Uqayl]], attacked Ramlah, Mufarrij called upon al-Fadl for aid. Al-Fadl agreed, and in the ensuing battle on 29 August Abu Taghlib was defeated and taken captive by Mufarrij. After parading him through Ramlah tied to a camel, Mufarrij killed his prisoner with his own hands to prevent him from being used by the Fatimids against him in the future.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=355}} This episode cemented Mufarrij's control over Ramlah and marked his and his tribe's rise to a powerful position in local affairs. With their rivals defeated, the Tayy now became "the major bedouin power in the area", according to [[Hugh N. Kennedy|Hugh Kennedy]], and a continuing nuisance to the Fatimids, since although they recognized Fatimid authority, in practice Mufarrij and his followers acted as independent agents.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=323}}

== Rebellions against the Fatimids and exile ==
The accord between Mufarrij and al-Fadl soon ended, and the Fatimid general turned against the Jarrahids, but through diplomatic means Mufarrij succeeded in getting al-Aziz to order his general to cease the attacks on him.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}} Nevertheless, Mufarrij and his men followed this up with destructive raids across Palestine in 980. On 7 July 981, while the Fatimid army was engaged in besieging Qassam in Damascus, Mufarrij openly rebelled against the Fatimids, and was joined by Bishara, the governor of [[Tiberias]], who joined the bedouin along with many of his men, mostly former Hamdanid soldiers.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=358}} The Fatimids responded by dispatching another army, headed by Rashiq al-Azizi, which quickly routed the Jarrahids. The latter fled south into the [[Hejaz]], where they attacked a caravan of [[Hajj]] pilgrims returning from [[Mecca]] in June 982, before in turn destroying a pursuing Fatimid army under Muflih al-Wahbani at [[Ayla (city)|Ayla]].{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=358}}

After this success Mufarrij and his men returned to Palestine where they confronted Rashiq, but were again defeated and forced to flee across the desert to [[Homs]], where [[Bakjur]], the local governor on behalf of the Hamdanid [[emir of Aleppo]], [[Sa'd al-Dawla]], took them in and catered for them, probably in winter 982. Despite this hospitality, the Tayy now went north and sought to enter the service of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Emperor [[Basil II]] accepted their request, and a few months later, in autumn 983, the Tayy fought alongside the Byzantines under the ''[[dux|doux]]'' of [[Antioch]], [[Bardas Phokas the Younger|Bardas Phokas]], when he went to relieve Aleppo from an attack by Bakjur, who had rebelled against Sa'd al-Dawla.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=358}}

Soon afterwards, Mufarrij apparently obtained a pardon (''aman'') for himself and his followers from al-Aziz,{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=358–359}} although when he returned to the Fatimid domains in late 983 or early 984 he allied himself with Bakjur, who was now the Fatimid governor of Damascus, against the Fatimid [[vizier]] [[Ibn Killis]]. In the end, in 988 Ibn Killis prevailed upon al-Aziz to oust Bakjur, and an army was sent against the allies. The Fatimid commander, Munis, took Ramlah, but the Jarrahids withdrew north towards Damascus. Munis recruited the other Arab tribes, rivals of the Tayy, in his ranks, and in a battle at Dariya, near Damascus, his forces defeated the troops of Bakjur and Mufarrij. This forced Bakjur to relinquish his post on 29 October and retreat with his followers north to [[Raqqa]] on the [[Euphrates]].{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=365–366}} Mufarrij and his men followed Bakjur, and in 989 are recorded as attacking yet another Hajj caravan in north Arabia.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}

== Return to Palestine ==

}}
It was only after the death of Ibn Killis in 991, that Mufarrij was able to return to Palestine. Ibn Killis had remained implacably opposed to Mufarrij, whom he regarded a dangerous individual: even on his deathbed, the vizier had urged al-Aziz to have Mufarrij executed should he fall into Fatimid hands, but in the event, the Caliph gave the Jarrahid a full pardon.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}} In 992 al-Aziz invited Mufarrij to participate in the campaign against Aleppo under the Turkish general [[Manjutakin]], but it is unclear whether Mufarrij fought in this or the subsequent campaigns, as he is not mentioned again until 996.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}

Al-Aziz died in October 996 and was succeeded by his under-age son, [[al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]], whereupon a fierce factional struggle erupted between the Turkish troops, led by Manjutakin, on the one hand, and the [[Kutama]] [[Berbers]], who under [[al-Hasan ibn 'Ammar]] moved to seize control of the caliphal government. Mufarrij sided with Manjutakin and fought alongside him in the battle outside [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], but the Berber general [[Sulayman ibn Ja'far ibn Fallah]] was victorious.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|pp=327–328}} Mufarrij, however, managed once more to emerge unscathed. As the orientalist [[Marius Canard]] writes, "following his usual tactics", he "did not hesitate to desert [Manjutakin] and to cross over to Sulayman's camp", and it was his son [[Ali ibn Mufarrij al-Jarrah|Ali]] who pursued and took Manjutakin prisoner.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}

In 997, Mufarrij tried to capture Ramlah and devastated the surrounding lands, but was attacked by the new governor of Damascus, [[Jaysh ibn Samsama]], and forced to once again flee to the lands of his fellow Tayy in the mountains of northern Hejaz. There, Canard says, "on the point of being captured he took part in a little comedy, sending the old women of his tribe to ask for ''aman'' and pardon, which were granted".{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=370}} In 1005/6, Mufarrij sent his sons Ali, [[Hassan ibn Mufarrij al-Jarrah|Hassan]] and [[Mahmud ibn Mufarrij al-Jarrah|Mahmud]] to lead a Bedouin army to assist the Fatimid army sent to quell the rebellion of Abu Rikwa.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}} In the next year, however, he is again found holding up one of the pilgrim caravans from [[Baghdad]] while it was crossing Tayy territory, and forcing them to pay tribute to him.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}

== Renewed uprising and autonomous rule ==
[[File:Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Portrait of Caliph al-Hakim]]
In 1011, [[Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn ibn Ali al-Maghribi|Abu'l-Qasim al-Husayn]], son of the executed [[Abu'l-Hasan Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Maghribi]], fled to Palestine, where he sought refuge in Hassan ibn Mufarrij's camp. In response, al-Hakim charged the Turk [[Yarukh]] with assembling an army to bring Abu'l-Qasim and his Jarrahid protectors to heel. Mufarrij's two other sons, Mahmud and Ali, were in Egypt at the time, and, having learned of the Caliph's preparations, rushed to their father to warn him. Together, Abu'l-Qasim and the younger Jarrahids convinced Mufarrij of the danger represented by Yarukh and the need to confront him before he reached Ramlah.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=381}} Consequently, the Jarrahids prepared to attack the Fatimid army at [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. Yarukh was informed of this, and planned to catch the ambushers by surprise by having 1,000 cavalry from the Ramlah garrison strike them in the rear along with his own troops. In the event, however, the messenger he sent to Ramlah to inform the garrison was captured by the Jarrahids, and Hassan managed to ambush Yarukh and capture him and his family near [[Rafiah]].{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=381–382}} Upon Abu'l-Qasim's suggestion, the Jarrahids now raised all the tribesmen of the ''[[Jund Filastin]]'' to open revolt and recruited them for an attack on Ramlah, the provincial capital. Ramlah fell and was pillaged by the Bedouin, who had been offered "a general licence to despoil and plunder" (M. Gil).{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=382}}

Learning of these events, al-Hakim wrote to Mufarrij and reproached him, demanding the safe return of Yarukh to Egypt, while at the same time offering the sum of 50,000 dinars if the Jarrahids would again submit. Abu'l-Qasim, who feared that Mufarrij was inclined to accept, persuaded Hassan to have Yarukh executed. The Jarrahids followed this open act of rebellion by recognizing an anti-caliph in the person of the [[Alid]] [[Sharif of Mecca]], [[Abu'l-Futuh al-Hasan ibn Ja'far]], in July 1012. Abu'l-Qasim himself journeyed to Mecca, where he persuaded Abu'l-Futuh to accept the role. The latter, assuming the title of ''al-Rashid bi'llah'' ("Righteous with God"), succeeded in winning the recognition of the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], and went to Ramlah. On his arrival there in September, he was greeted with jubilation by the Bedouin, and the local preacher read the [[Friday prayer]] in his name.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=382–383}}

Mufarrij also tried to win support among the Christians, and possibly curry the favour of the [[Byzantine Empire]] as well, by sponsoring works to restore the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]], which had only recently been demolished on the orders of al-Hakim, and by arranging the re-appointment of a Patriarch to the vacant [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|see]].{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=333}} In general, the Jarrahids seem to have had close relations with the Christians and maintained contact with Byzantium, a fact which would play a role in later events.{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=385}}

This period marked the apogee of the Bedouin power in Palestine: as the contemporary historian [[Yahya of Antioch]] writes, the entire interior of the land, "from [[al-Farama]] to [[Tiberias]]", was under their control, with only the coastal cities resisting the siege attempts, and coins were minted in Abu'l-Futuh's name.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=333}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=383}} Although in the end short-lived, this period of Bedouin domination had a considerable negative impact on the region. Kennedy remarks that "it was marked by the destruction and desolation of many of the settled communities, and as elsewhere in the [[Fertile Crescent]] at this period, the extension of nomad-controlled area at the expense of the urban and agricultural areas."{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=333}}

Despite its apparent success, Bedouin power was fragile, as the Jarrahids proved susceptible to bribery. Al-Hakim sent large sums and gifts to Mufarrij and his sons, with Hassan in return sending back the grandsons of [[Jawhar al-Siqilli]], who had been entrusted to his care, to be executed.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=483}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=383}} Abu'l-Futuh began to have second thoughts, as the Jarrahids increasingly treated him disrespectfully after the money he had brought with him ran out. Eventually he returned to Mecca and Fatimid allegiance. Abu'l-Qasim too feared a Jarrahid rapprochement with the Fatimids, and fled for [[Iraq]], eventually rising to become a vizier for the [[Marwanid]] and [[Uqaylid]] rulers of the Jazira.{{sfn|Kennedy|2004|p=333}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|p=383}} Finally, in July/August 1013, al-Hakim sent a 24,000-strong army under [[Ali ibn Ja'far ibn Fallah]] against the Bedouin. The latter were heavily defeated in the field and lost Ramlah. Ali and Mahmud surrendered, and at the same time, Mufarrij died, possibly poisoned by agents of the Caliph. Thereupon Hassan too secured a pardon, and managed to retain his father's lands in Palestine.{{sfn|Canard|1991|pp=483–484}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=383–384}} Although initially loyal to the Fatimids, he too held ambitions to rule Palestine as an autonomous ruler. From 1024, he launched a series of rebellions, allied with the Christians of Palestine and the Byzantines. Like his father, however, he failed to achieve but ephemeral success.{{sfn|Canard|1991|p=484}}{{sfn|Gil|1997|pp=385ff.}}

'''Muhammad{{efn|The spelling of Muhammad Ali's first name in both Arabic, : محمد (Muhammad). This is the name by which he was known to his Egyptian subjects, and the name used uniformly in Egyptian, and Arab historical scholarship. However, given his original status as a commander in the [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman military]], his first name is often rendered as Mehmed, , or Mehmet in [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and Current English-language historical scholarship is divided as to which is preferable, with the majority opinion favoring the former. Typically, historians accentuating the Egyptian character of his rule opt for 'Muhammad', whilst those accentuating the Ottoman character opt for 'Mehmed' or 'Mehmet'. This distinction is an issue for those writing in the Latin alphabet, but not in Arabic.&lt;ref name= Fahmy &gt;{{Cite book | title = All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt | author = Khalid Fahmy | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Ali Pasha al-Mas'ud ibn Agha''' ({{lang-ota|محمد علی پاشا المسعود بن آغا}}; {{lang-ar|محمد علي باشا}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Muḥammad ‘Alī Bāshā''; [[Albanian language|Albanian]]: '''Mehmet Ali Pasha'''; [[Turkish language|Turkish]]: '''Kavalalı Mehmet Ali Paşa''';&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EHsAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=mohamed+ali+ ''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'' January–June 1841] (indexed by [[Google Books]])&lt;/ref&gt; 4 March 1769 – 2 August 1849) was an [[Albania under the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Albanian]] commander who rose to the rank of [[Pasha]], and became [[Wāli]], and self-declared [[Khedive]] of [[History of Egypt under the Muhammad Ali dynasty|Egypt]] and [[Egyptian conquest of Sudan (1820–1824)|Sudan]] with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans']] temporary approval. Though not a modern nationalist, he is regarded as the founder of modern Egypt because of the dramatic reforms in the military, economic and cultural spheres that he instituted.

&lt;!--these paragraphs refer to "he", but the text shows that "he" is sometimes Muhammad, and sometimes Ibrahim, and maybe others.  This REALLY needs to be cleared up, but I don't know enough to do it--&gt;
[[File:Kavala Mehemet Pacha's house.jpg|thumb|left|Muhammad Ali's birthplace in [[Kavala]], now in northeastern Greece.]]

Muhammad Ali was born in [[Kavala]], in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], [[Rumeli Eyalet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], today a city 
in [[Greece]]. He was born to an [[Albanians|Albanian]] family whose origins were from [[Korçë]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.al/books?id=J5U3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA266 | page=266 | title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam | last1=Gibb | first1=Sir Hamilton | publisher=Brill | date=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ottoman architecture in Albania, 1385-1912|publisher=Research Centre for Islamic History, Art and Culture|date=1990|last1=Kiel|first1=Machiel}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second son of a tobacco and shipping [[merchant]] named Ibrahim Agha, who also served as an Ottoman commander of a small unit in Kavala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kia|first1=Mehrdad|title=The Ottoman Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia [2 volumes]|date=2017|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610693899|page=87|url=https://books.google.gr/books?id=UgUmDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=|language=en|quote=His father... was the commander of a small army unit that served the governor of Kavala}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Elsie2012&gt;{{Cite book | title = A Biographical Dictionary of Albanian History | author = Robert Elsie | publisher = I.B.Tauris | year = 2012 | isbn = 9781780764313 | p = 303 | url= https://books.google.it/books?id=pgf6GWJxuZgC&amp;pg=PA303&amp;dq#v}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Zeynep, the daughter of the "Ayan of [[Kavala]]" Çorbaci Husain Agha. When his father died at a young age, Muhammad was taken and raised by his uncle with his cousins. As a reward for Muhammad Ali's hard work, his uncle gave him the rank of "[[Bolukbashi]]" for the collection of taxes in the town of Kavala.&lt;ref name=Elsie2012 /&gt;

After Muhammad's promising success in collecting taxes, he gained Second Commander rank under his cousin Sarechesme Halil Agha in the Kavala Volunteer Contingent of Albanian mercenaries that was sent to re-occupy Egypt following General Napoleon Bonaparte's withdrawal.&lt;ref name=Elsie2012 /&gt; He later married Ali Agha's daughter, Emine Nosratli, a wealthy widow, who was his maternal Cousin, because her Mother Kadriye and his Mother Zeynep were sisters, both daughters of Çorbaci Husain Agha. In 1801, his unit was sent, as part of a much larger Ottoman force, to re-occupy Egypt following a brief [[Napoleonic Campaign in Egypt|French occupation]] that threatened the way of life in Egypt. The expedition landed at [[Aboukir]] in the spring of 1801.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, William L, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'', (Boulder: Westview Press, 2009), 65–66&lt;/ref&gt; One of his trusted army commanders was Miralay Mustafa Bey, who had married Muhammad's sister Zubayda and was the Ancestor of the Yakan family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Mahmud Sami al-Barudi: Reconfiguring Society and the Self | author = Terri DeYoung | publisher = Syracuse University Press | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-0-8156-5315-8 | p = 161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise to power==
{{main|Muhammad Ali's seizure of power}}
The French withdrawal left a power vacuum in Egypt. [[Mamluk]] power had been weakened, but not destroyed, and Ottoman forces clashed with the Mamluks for power.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Little, ''Egypt'', (New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1958), 57.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of turmoil Muhammad Ali used his loyal Albanian troops to work with both sides, gaining power and prestige for himself.&lt;ref name=Little57&gt;Little, 57.&lt;/ref&gt; As the conflict drew on, the local populace grew weary of the power struggle. In 1801, he allied with the [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]ian leader [[Umar Makram]] and Egypt's [[Grand Imam of al-Azhar]]. During the infighting between the Ottomans and Mamluks between 1801 and 1805, Muhammad Ali carefully acted to gain the support of the general public.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Vatikiotis, ''The History of Egypt'', (Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1985), 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1805, a group of prominent Egyptians led by the [[ulema]] demanded the replacement of ''Wāli'' (viceroy) [[Ahmad Khurshid Pasha]] by Muhammad Ali, and the Ottomans yielded. In 1809, though, Ali exiled Makram to [[Damietta]]. According to [[Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti]], Makram had discovered Muhammad Ali's intentions to seize power for himself.&lt;ref name=Little57/&gt;

Sultan [[Selim III]] could not oppose Muhammad Ali’s ascension. By appearing as the champion of the people Muhammad Ali was able to forestall popular opposition until he had consolidated his power.

[[File:Mamluks, Horace Vernet.jpg|thumb|Massacre of the Mamelukes at the Cairo citadel by [[Horace Vernet]].]]
The Mamluks still posed the greatest threat to Muhammad Ali. They controlled Egypt for more than 600 years, and over that time they extended their rule systematically south along the Nile River to Upper Egypt. Muhammad Ali’s approach was to eliminate the Mamluk leadership, then move against the rank and file. Muhammad Ali invited the Mamluk leaders to a celebration at the [[Cairo Citadel]] in honour of his son, [[Tusun Pasha]], who was to lead a military expedition into [[Arabia]]. The event was held on March 1, 1811. When the Mamluks had gathered at the Citadel, and were surrounded by Muhammad Ali's troops, he had his troops kill them.{{efn|Reports vary about how many died. William Cleveland claims 74 killed while H. Wood Jarvis claims nearly 500. Whatever the actual number, it is clear that the event dealt a serious blow to the Mamluks.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Wood Jarvis, ''Pharaoh to Farouk'', (London: John Murray, 1956), 124.&lt;/ref&gt;}} After the leaders were killed, Muhammad Ali dispatched his army throughout Egypt to rout the remainder of the Mamluk forces.

Muhammad Ali transformed Egypt into a regional power which he saw as the natural successor to the decaying Ottoman Empire. He summed up his vision for Egypt as follows:

{{bquote|I am well aware that the (Ottoman) Empire is heading by the day toward destruction... On its ruins I will build a vast kingdom... up to the Euphrates and the Tigris.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Douin, ed. ''Une Mission militaire francaise aupres de Mohamed Aly, correspondance des Generaux Belliard et Boyer'' (Cairo: ''Société Royale de Geographie d'Egypte'', 1923)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Reinventing Egypt ==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2017}}
[[File:Mouhamed ali army&amp;navy.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali of Egypt establishes a modern Navy.]]

Sultan [[Selim III]] (reigned 1789–1807) had recognized the need to reform and modernize the Ottoman Empire, specifically the military, along European lines to ensure that his state could compete. Selim III, however, faced stiff local opposition from an entrenched clergy and military apparatus, especially from the [[Janissaries]], the Ottoman infantry formed from the [[devshirme]] system. Consequently, Selim III was deposed and ultimately killed in 1808. Muhammad Ali, too, recognized the need to modernize, and unlike Selim, he had dispatched his chief rivals, giving him a free hand to attempt reforms similar to those first begun by Selim III.&lt;ref&gt;William L. Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'' (Boulder: Westview Press, 2013), 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad Ali's goal was for Egypt to leave the Ottoman Empire and be ruled by his own hereditary dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; To do that, he had to reorganize Egyptian society, streamline the economy, train a professional bureaucracy, and build a modern military.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;All the Pasha’s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt, Khaled Famy&lt;/ref&gt;

His first task was to secure a revenue stream for Egypt. To accomplish this, Muhammad Ali 'nationalized' all the [[iltizam]] lands of Egypt, thereby officially owning all the production of the land. He accomplished the state annexation of property by raising taxes on the '[[tax-farmer]]s' who had previously owned the land throughout Egypt. The new taxes were intentionally high and when the tax-farmers could not extract the demanded payments from the peasants who worked the land, Muhammad Ali confiscated their properties. The other major source of revenue Muhammad Ali created was a new tax on [[waqf]] endowments, which were previously tax-free. Through these endowments, personal income could be set aside for schools or other charitable purposes. As well as raising revenue to fund his new military, this tax took revenue away from the local elite, Mamluks and the ulama, weakening opposition to Muhammad Ali's reforms.&lt;ref&gt;Vatikiotis, 55; Cleveland, 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, Muhammad Ali's land reform amounted to a monopoly on trade in Egypt. He required all producers to sell their goods to the state. The state in turn resold Egyptian goods, within Egypt and to foreign markets, and retained the surplus. The practice proved very profitable for Egypt with the cultivation of [[long staple cotton]], a new [[cash crop]]. To help improve production, he expanded the land used for agriculture and overhauled the irrigation system, largely completed by the [[corvée]], or forced peasant labor. The new-found profits also extended down to the individual farmers, as the average wage increased fourfold.&lt;ref&gt;Little, 59; Cleveland, 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to bolstering the agricultural sector, Muhammad Ali built an industrial base for Egypt. His motivation for doing so was primarily an effort to build a modern military. Consequently, he focused on weapons production. Factories based in Cairo produced [[musket]]s and [[cannon]]s. With a [[shipyard]] he built in [[Alexandria]], he began construction of a navy. By the end of the 1830s, Egypt’s war industries had constructed nine 100-gun warships and were turning out 1,600 muskets a month.&lt;ref name=Cleveland69&gt;Cleveland, 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the industrial innovations were not limited to weapons production. Muhammad Ali established a [[textile industry]] in an effort to compete with European industries and produce greater revenues for Egypt. While the textile industry was not successful, the entire endeavour employed tens of thousands of Egyptians.&lt;ref name=Cleveland69 /&gt; Muhammad Ali used contracts called [[concession (contract)|concessions]] to build cheap infrastructure - dams and railroads - whereby foreign European companies would raise capital, build projects, and collect most of the operating revenue but would provide Ali's government with a portion of that revenue. Ali also granted [[Barthélemy Prosper Enfantin]] permission to build technical schools modeled after [[Ecole Polytechnique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Zachary|last=Karabell|title=Parting the desert: the creation of the Suez Canal|publisher=Alfred A.

To staff his new industries, Muhammad Ali employed a [[corvée]] labor system. The peasantry objected to these conscriptions and many ran away from their villages to avoid being taken, sometimes fleeing as far away as [[Syria]]. A number of them maimed themselves so as to be unsuitable for combat: common ways of self-maiming were blinding an eye with rat poison and cutting off a finger of the right hand, so as to be unable to fire a rifle.

Beyond building a functioning, industrial economy, Muhammad Ali also made an effort to train a professional military and bureaucracy. He sent promising citizens to Europe to study. Again the driving impulse behind the effort was to build a European-style army. Students were sent to study European languages, primarily French, so they could in turn translate military manuals into Arabic. He then used both educated Egyptians and imported European experts to establish schools and hospitals in Egypt. The European education also provided talented Egyptians with a means of social mobility.

A by-product of Muhammad Ali's training program was the establishment of a [[Civil service|professional bureaucracy]]. Establishing an efficient central bureaucracy was an essential prerequisite for the success of Muhammad Ali's other reforms. In the process of destroying the Mamluks, the Wāli had to fill the governmental roles that the Mamluks had previously filled. In doing so, Muhammad Ali kept all central authority for himself. He partitioned Egypt into ten provinces responsible for collecting taxes and maintaining order.&lt;ref name=Cleveland69 /&gt; Muhammad Ali installed his sons in most key positions; however, his reforms did offer Egyptians opportunities beyond agriculture and industry.

A 2015 study found that Ali's economic policies had a positive impact on industrialization in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Panza|first=Laura|last2=Williamson|first2=Jeffrey G.|date=2015-02-01|title=Did Muhammad Ali foster industrialization in early nineteenth-century Egypt?|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0289.12063/abstract|journal=The Economic History Review|language=en|volume=68|issue=1|pages=79–100|doi=10.1111/1468-0289.12063|issn=1468-0289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law under Muhammad Ali ==
The purpose of the law was to represent Muhammad Ali in his absence.&lt;ref&gt;All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 133&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad Ali started his renovations in law by moving towards a more effective control over crime within Egypt. Most notably he did this by passing his first penal legislation in 1829, in an effort to get a stronger hold over the population. By this time, Muhammad Ali was already moving towards an establishment of an independent state, which he first expressed in 1830, by creating a state of "law and order", where Christians within Egypt can be safe, which was a way Muhammad was able to pull influence from Europe.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fahmy|first=Khaled|date=1999-01-01|title=The Anatomy of Justice: Forensic Medicine and Criminal Law in Nineteenth-Century Egypt|jstor=3399313|journal=Islamic Law and Society|volume=6|issue=2|pages=224–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; He started gradually renovating more of the government for him to hold more sway over it rather than the sultan. He implemented a police force, mostly well known within Cairo and Alexandria, that functioned not just as a form of authority over the law, but also as a form of a public prosecutor's office.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Renovation of evidence used within the courts, that previously would not be used, started to be part of the system, the biggest one being autopsy reports, becoming an important asset among investigations and trials alike. With the use of non Shari'a evidence allowed the process of law to work around the strict Shari'a rule of evidence, which restricted the use of certain forms of evidence.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Autopsy became an important form of evidence used within criminal law in Egypt, even being used after Muhammad's reign amongst his successors in the 1850s.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Hakimas and the school of medicine for women ==
In 1832, Muhammad Ali allowed [[Antoine Clot]], known as "Clot Bey" in Egypt, to establish a School of Medicine for women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kuhnke, LaVerne. ''Lives at Risk: Public Health in Nineteenth-Century Egypt.'' Berkeley:  University of California Press, 1990. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft5t1nb3mq/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Clot-Bey had been invited in 1827 by Muhammad Ali to found the Qasral-‘Ayni School of Medicine at the Army hospital of Abou Zabel which later transferred to Cairo. The Army Medical School had a difficult beginning with religious officials against dissection of corpses for anatomy lessons.&lt;ref&gt;M. Paul Merruau, ''L’Egypte Contemporaine de Mehemet-ali a Said Pacha'',
Paris, Librarie Internationale, 1860, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The medical school for women would produce hakimas, "doctoress",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; to treat women and children. French women adherents of the [[Saint-Simonianism|Saint-Simonian]] social reform movement were living in Egypt during 1833-36 and studied or provided medical care under Clot Bey's direction. French ''sage-femme'' (midwife) [[Suzanne Voilquin]] writes of assisting during the cholera epidemic of 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Voilquin, Suzanne. ''Souvenirs d'une fille du peuple: ou, La Saint-Simonienne en Egypte'', Intro by Lydia Elhadad. Paris: F. Maspero, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the French women contracted cholera and died.

Ali’s military and economic goals required a healthy army and population from which young boys could be conscripted. Venereal diseases, especially syphilis, were common among soldiers and smallpox outbreaks led to high childhood mortality rates. Clot Bey argued that female-provided health care for women and children was crucial to maintain a healthy population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He believed that the untrained local dayas (midwives) were unable to provide appropriate care and under Egyptian law, male doctors could not treat women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kozma, Liat. ''Policing Egyptian Women: Sex, Law, and Medicine in Khedival Egypt''. Syracuse, NY, USA: Syracuse University Press, 2011. ProQuest ebrary. Web. 24 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Clot Bey’s solution was a school to train female doctors.

The school of medicine for women followed a French model. The first two years of training provided Arabic literacy in order to communicate with patients. The following four included training in: obstetrics, pre- and post-natal care, dressing wounds, cauterization, vaccination, scarification, cupping, application of leeches, identification / preparation of common medicines. Students were provided housing, food, clothes and a monthly allowance from the state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Graduates served at the Civil Hospital in Cairo or at health centres throughout Egypt. Some stayed at the school to serve as instructors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Marriages were arranged by the state to male doctors. Once married, hakimas were given the title of [[Effendi]], the rank of second lieutenant, and a monthly salary of 250 piasters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Licensed hakimas treated women and children, providing vaccinations and delivering children. They served a fundamental role in reducing the incidence of smallpox during the 19th century by vaccinating approximately 600 children a month in the Civil Hospital.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They checked and treated women, mainly prostitutes, for venereal diseases.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Fahmy, Khaled. “Women, Medicine, and Power in Nineteenth-Century Egypt.” ''Remaking Women: Feminism and Modernity in the Middle East''. Lila Abu-Lughod. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1998. 35–63. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important task was the “forensic examination”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; of women. In this respect, hakimas operated in legal setting. Their examination was used as evidence in cases involving unnatural death, suspected premarital loss of virginity, or miscarriage.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Although one task of the hakimas was overseeing childbirth, the majority of the population continued to use the dayas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hakimas performed almost no deliveries and often were only called upon during difficult deliveries.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, dayas were required to have a certificate to perform deliveries, which could only be obtained from hakimas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They were also expected to report statistics on births to the hakimas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A significant issue was recruitment of students. Egyptian culture at the time opposed the education of women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Therefore, the first students at the medical school were young slave girls.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Slaves continued to be recruited through slave auctions as well as orphans from hospices.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite the modest success of the school and its graduates, increasing enrolment remained a consistent problem, though the limit of 60 students was reached in 1846.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Contemporary and modern historians have viewed the creation of a school of medicine for women and the position of hakima as an example of modernization and reform for women under Muhammad Ali.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Khaled Fahmy argues against this view.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Fahmy states that, because the reasons for the creation of the school are primarily for the maintenance of a healthy army, the school was not a sign of reform but Ali furthering his military goals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, their treatment of venereal diseases was intended to curb its incidence among soldiers and smallpox vaccinations increased the pool of potential soldiers by reducing childhood mortality rate. Furthermore, the hakimas allowed for increased state control over social life. This is observed in the use of hakimas to collect statistics on childbirth, either personally or through dayas, as well as in the cases where a hakima was used to examine a woman.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Role in Arabic literary renaissance ==
In the 1820s, Muhammad Ali sent the first educational "mission" of Egyptian students to Europe. This contact resulted in literature that is considered the dawn of the Arabic literary renaissance, known as the [[Nahda]].

To support the modernization of industry and the military, Muhammad Ali set up a number of schools in various fields where French texts were studied. [[Rifa'a al-Tahtawi]] supervised translations from French to Arabic on topics ranging from sociology and history to military technology, and these translations have been considered the second great translation movement, after the first [[Arab transmission of the Classics to the West#First period: Greek – Arabic translations|from Greek into Arabic]].

In 1819/21, his government founded the first indigenous press in the Arab World, the [[Bulaq Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Verdery|first=Richard|title=The Publications of the Būlāq Press under Muhammad 'Alī of Egypt|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=1971|volume=91|issue=1|pages=129–132|url=http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos-91-1-rnv.pdf|accessdate=22 May 2014|doi=10.2307/600448}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bulaq press published the official [[gazette]] of Muhammad Ali's government.

Among his personal interests was the accumulation and breeding of [[Arabian horse]]s. In horses obtained as taxes and [[tribute]], Muhammad Ali recognised the unique characteristics and careful attention to bloodlines of the horses bred by the [[Bedouin]], particularly by the [[Anazeh]] in Syria and those bred in the [[Nejd]]. While his immediate successor had minimal interest in the horse breeding program, his grandson, who became [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]] shared this interest and further built upon his work.

== Military campaigns ==
[[File:Flag of Muhammad Ali.svg|The Flag of Muhamma Ali|thumb|Muhammad Ali's flag.]]

Though Muhammad Ali’s chief aim was to establish a European-style military, and carve out a personal empire, he waged war initially on behalf of the Ottoman Sultan, [[Mahmud II]], in Arabia and Greece, although he later came into open conflict with the Ottoman Empire.  He used several new strategies to ensure the success of his new military. First new recruits were isolated from the environment they were used to. They began housing soldiers in barracks, leadership enforced a strict regime of surveillance, roll call was done several times a day, and use of corporal punishment to ensure the new fighting force grew to become a strong disciplined military.&lt;ref&gt;All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt&lt;/ref&gt; The army often used the bastinado and the whip to control and punish the soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt 127&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad not only wanted his soldiers to be disciplined, he also created many military codes to regulate the definitions of crime and punishment, this helped to create blind obedience to the laws.&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha’s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 119–47.&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of Ali's goal of a European-style military was through the creation of new labelling and organizational systems to identify soldiers, distinguish officers from enlisted men, structure units, and properly distribute salaries.&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha’s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers were given a unique number that identified their unit and their role within it, and officers were expected to use lists with these numbers to keep a close watch on the men and ensure every man performed his clearly assigned duty.&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha’s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; This was particularly useful in identifying deserters who often fled in the chaos of massed movement, such as during forced marches or relocation to a new encampment.&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Fahmy, All the Pasha’s Men: Mehmed Ali, his army and the making of modern Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 144.&lt;/ref&gt;
The soldiers were placed under strict surveillance in the barracks. In order to accomplish this Muhammad Ali relied on the Bedouins to guard the troops that were sent to the training camps.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Despite being hired to control the troops the Bedouins were actually a menace to the government who often had to use the army to control the Bedouins.&lt;ref&gt;All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 123&lt;/ref&gt; In order to combat this the government slowly switched from using Bedouins to guard the soldiers and to capture deserters and instead attempted to set up the expectation of internment from the beginning of the soldiers stay at the training camps in order to deter them from deserting the military in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;All the Pasha's Men: Mehmed Ali, his Army and the Making of Modern Egypt, 124&lt;/ref&gt;
His first military campaign was an expedition into the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. The holy cities of [[Mecca]], and [[Medina]] had been captured by the [[House of Saud]], who had recently embraced a literalist [[Hanbali]] interpretation of [[Islam]]. Armed with their newfound religious zeal, the Saudis began conquering parts of Arabia. This culminated in the capture of the [[Hejaz]] region by 1805.

With the main Ottoman army tied up in Europe, Mahmud II turned to Muhammad Ali to [[Ottoman–Saudi War|recapture the Arabian territories]]. Muhammad Ali in turn appointed his son, [[Tusun Pasha|Tusun]], to lead a military expedition in 1811. The campaign was initially turned back in Arabia; however, a second attack was launched in 1812 that succeeded in recapturing Hejaz.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammal ‘Ali'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1967), 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the campaign was successful, the power of the Saudis was not broken. They continued to harass Ottoman and Egyptian forces from the central [[Nejd]] region of the Peninsula. Consequently, Muhammad Ali dispatched another of his sons, Ibrahim, at the head of another army to finally rout the Saudis. After a two-year campaign, the Saudis were crushed and most of the Saudi family was captured. The family leader, [[Abdullah ibn Saud]], was sent to Istanbul, and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad Ali next turned his attention to military campaigns independent of the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]], beginning with the [[Sudan]] which he viewed as a valuable addition resource of territory, gold, and slaves. The Sudan at the time had no real central authority, as since the 18th century many petty kingdoms and tribal sheikhdoms had seceded from the declining [[Sultanate of Sennar]], fighting each other with Medieval weaponry. In 1820 Muhammad Ali dispatched an army of 5,000 troops commanded by his third son, Ismail and [[Abidin Bey]], south into Sudan with the intent of conquering the territory and subjugating it to his authority.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 51.&lt;/ref&gt; Ali's troops made headway into Sudan in 1821, but met with fierce resistance by the [[Shaigiya]]. Ultimately, the superiority of the Egyptian troops and firearms ensured the defeat of the [[Shaigiya]] and the subsequent conquest of the Sudan. Ali now had an outpost from which he could expand to the source of the [[Nile]] in [[Ethiopia]], and [[Uganda]]. His administration captured slaves from the [[Nuba Mountains]], and west and south Sudan, all incorporated into a foot regiment known as the ''Gihadiya'' which were composed of the recently defeated [[Shaigiya]] who now took service under the invaders in exchange for keeping their domains. (pronounced ''Jihadiya'' in non-Egyptian Arabic). Ali's reign in Sudan, and that of his immediate successors, is remembered in Sudan as brutal and heavy-handed, contributing to the popular independence struggle of the self-proclaimed [[Mahdi]], [[Muhammad Ahmad]], in 1881.

[[File:Ibrahim-Mehmet-Seve.jpg|thumb|Muhammad Ali Pasha with [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|his son, Ibrahim]], and [[Soliman Pasha (al-Faransawi)|Colonel Joseph Sève (''later'' Suleiman Pasha)]].]]
While Muhammad Ali was expanding his authority into Africa, the Ottoman Empire was being challenged by ethnic rebellions in its European territories. The [[Greek War of Independence|rebellion]] in the [[Greece|Greek provinces]] of the Ottoman Empire began in 1821. The Ottoman army proved ineffectual in its attempts to put down the revolt as ethnic violence spread as far as [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]. With his own army proving ineffective, Sultan Mahmud II offered Muhammad Ali the island of [[Crete]] in exchange for his support in putting down the revolt.

Muhammad Ali sent 16,000 soldiers, 100 transports, and 63 escort vessels under command of his son, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Britain, France, and Russia intervened to protect the Greeks. On 20 October 1827 at the [[Battle of Navarino]], while under the command of Muharram Bey, the Ottoman representative, the entire Egyptian navy was sunk by the European Allied fleet, under the command of Admiral [[Edward Codrington]]. If the [[Ottoman Porte|Porte]] was not in the least prepared for this confrontation, Muhammad Ali was even less prepared for the loss of his highly competent, expensively assembled and maintained navy. With its fleet essentially destroyed, Egypt had no way to support its forces in Greece and was forced to withdraw. Ultimately the campaign cost Muhammad Ali his navy and yielded no tangible gains.

In compensation for this loss, Muhammad Ali asked the Porte for the territory of [[Syria]]. The Ottomans were indifferent to the request; the Sultan himself asked blandly what would happen if Syria was given over and Muhammad Ali later deposed.&lt;ref&gt;12 Bahr Barra, Jamad I 1243/1828&lt;/ref&gt; But Muhammad Ali was no longer willing to tolerate Ottoman indifference. To compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the wheels for the conquest of Syria were set in motion.

Like other rulers of Egypt before him, Ali desired to control [[Bilad al-Sham]] (the Levant), both for its strategic value and for its rich natural resources; nor was this a sudden, vindictive decision on the part of the Wāli since he had harboured this goal since his early years as Egypt's unofficial ruler. For not only had Syria abundant natural resources, it also had a thriving international trading community with well-developed markets throughout the [[Levant]]; in addition, it would be a [[captive market]] for the goods now being produced in Egypt. Yet perhaps most of all, Syria was desirable as a buffer state between Egypt and the Ottoman Sultan.

A new fleet was built, a new army was raised and on 31 October 1831, under Ibrahim Pasha, the Egyptian invasion of Syria initiated the [[First Turko-Egyptian War]]. For the sake of appearance on the world stage, a pretext for the invasion was vital. Ultimately, the excuse for the expedition was a quarrel with [[Abdullah Pasha ibn Ali|Abdullah Pasha]] of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]]. The Wāli alleged that 6,000 [[fellahin]] had fled to Acre to escape the draft, corvée, and taxes, and he wanted them back.&lt;ref&gt;Afaf Lutfi al-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', University of Cambridge, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; (See also: [[1834 Arab revolt in Palestine]])

The Egyptians overran most of Syria and its hinterland with ease. The strongest and only really significant resistance was put up at the port city of Acre. The Egyptian force eventually captured the city after a six-month siege, which lasted from 3 November 1831 to 27 May 1832. Unrest on the Egyptian home front increased dramatically during the course of the siege. Ali was forced to squeeze Egypt more and more in order to support his campaign and his people resented the increased burden.

After the fall of Acre, the Egyptian army marched north into [[Anatolia]]. At the [[Battle of Konya]] (21 December 1832), Ibrahim Pasha soundly defeated the Ottoman army led by the ''sadr azam'' [[Grand Vizier]] Reshid Pasha. There were now no military obstacles between Ibrahim's forces and Constantinople itself.

Through the course of the campaign, Muhammad Ali paid particular focus to the European powers. Fearing another intervention that would reverse all his gains, he proceeded slowly and cautiously. For example, Muhammad Ali continued the practice of using the sultan’s name at Friday prayers in the newly captured territories and continued to circulate Ottoman coins instead of issuing new ones bearing his likeness.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 111.&lt;/ref&gt; So long as Muhammad Ali’s march did not threaten to cause the complete collapse of the Ottoman state, the powers in Europe remained as passive observers.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this show, Muhammad Ali's goal was now to remove the current Ottoman Sultan [[Mahmud II]] and replace him with the sultan's son, the infant [[Abdülmecid I|Abdülmecid]]. This possibility so alarmed Mahmud II that he accepted Russia's offer of military aid resulting in the [[Treaty of Hünkâr İskelesi]].&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's gain dismayed the British and French governments, resulting in their direct intervention. From this position, the European powers brokered a negotiated solution in May 1833 known as the [[Convention of Kutahya]].&lt;ref name= Kupchan &gt;{{cite book | title = Power in Transition: The Peaceful Change of International Order | author = Charles Kupchan  | publisher = United Nations University Press | year = 2001 |  page = 117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of the peace were that Ali would withdraw his forces from Anatolia and receive the territories of [[Crete]] (then known as Candia) and the [[Hijaz]] as compensation, and Ibrahim Pasha would be appointed Wāli of Syria. The peace agreement fell short, however, of granting Muhammad Ali an independent kingdom for himself, leaving him wanting.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RecepcionMehmetAli.jpg|thumb|left|''Interview with Mehmet Ali in his Palace at Alexandria'' (1839) by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]].]]
Sensing that Muhammad Ali was not content with his gains, the sultan attempted to pre-empt further action against the Ottoman Empire by offering him hereditary rule in Egypt and Arabia if he withdrew from Syria and Crete and renounced any desire for full independence.&lt;ref name=Vatikiotis66&gt;Vatikiotis, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad Ali rejected the offer, knowing that Mahmud could not force the Egyptian presence from Syria and Crete.

On 25 May 1838, Muhammad Ali informed Britain, and France that he intended to declare independence from the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; This action was contrary to the desire of the European powers to maintain the status quo within the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=Vatikiotis66/&gt; With Muhammad Ali’s intentions clear, the European powers, particularly Russia, attempted to moderate the situation and prevent conflict. Within the Empire, however, both sides were gearing for war. Ibrahim already had a sizable force in Syria. In Constantinople, the Ottoman commander, Hafiz Pasha, assured the Sultan that he could defeat the Egyptian army.

When Mahmud II ordered his forces to advance on the Syrian frontier, Ibrahim attacked and destroyed them at the [[Battle of Nezib]] (24 June 1839) near [[Urfa]]. In an echo of the Battle of Konya, Constantinople was again left vulnerable to Ali's forces. A further blow to the Ottomans was the defection of their fleet to Muhammad Ali.&lt;ref name=Vatikiotis66/&gt; Mahmud II died almost immediately after the battle took place and was succeeded by sixteen-year-old [[Abdülmecid I|Abdülmecid]]. At this point, Ali and Ibrahim began to argue about which course to follow; Ibrahim favoured conquering the Ottoman capital and demanding the imperial seat while Muhammad Ali was inclined simply to demand numerous concessions of territory and political autonomy for himself and his family.

At this point, the European powers again intervened (see [[Oriental Crisis of 1840]]). On 15 July 1840, the British Government, which had colluded with [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austria]], [[Prussia]], and Russia to sign the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]], offered Muhammad Ali hereditary rule of Egypt as part of the Ottoman Empire if he withdrew from the Syrian hinterland and the coastal regions of Mount Lebanon. Muhammad Ali hesitated, believing he had support from France. His hesitation proved costly. France eventually backed down as [[King Louis-Philippe]] did not want his country to find itself involved and isolated in a war against the other powers, especially at a time when he also had to deal with the [[Rhine crisis]]. So British naval forces moved against Syria, and Alexandria.&lt;ref&gt;Jarvis, 134.&lt;/ref&gt; In the face of European military might, Muhammad Ali acquiesced.

After the [[Royal Navy|British]], and Austrian navies blockaded the [[Nile delta]] coastline, shelled [[Beirut]] (11 September 1840), and after Acre had capitulated (3 November 1840), Muhammad Ali agreed to the terms of the Convention on 27 November 1840. These terms included renouncing his claims over Crete, and Hejaz, downsizing his navy, and reducing his standing army to 18,000 men, provided that he and his descendants would enjoy [[hereditary]] rule over Egypt and [[Sudan (region)|Sudan]]: an unheard-of status for an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[viceroy]].&lt;ref&gt;Morroe Berger, ''Military Elite and Social Change: Egypt Since Napoleon'', (Princeton, New Jersey: Center for International Studies, 1960), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final years ==
[[File:mohammed-ali-basha-mosque.jpg|thumb|[[The Mosque of Muhammad Ali]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]]]

After 1843, fast on the heels of the Syrian debacle, and the [[treaty of Balta Liman]], which forced the Egyptian government to tear down its import barriers, and to give up its monopolies, Muhammad Ali's mind became increasingly clouded and tended towards paranoia. Whether it was genuine senility or the effects of the [[silver nitrate]] he had been given years before to treat an attack of dysentery remains a subject of debate.&lt;ref&gt;"...the silver nitrate his doctors gave him earlier to cure his dysentery was taking its toll...", Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 255; Cambridge Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1844 the tax receipts were in, and Sherif Pasha, the head of the diwan al-maliyya (financial ministry), was too fearful for his life to tell the Wāli the news that Egyptian debt now stood at 80&amp;nbsp;million francs (£2,400,000). Tax arrears came to 14,081,500 piastres{{efn|A [[Kuruş|piastre]] is forty ''[[Para (currency)|paras]]''. A ''para'' is the smallest Egyptian silver coin. In this instance, a piastre can be viewed as approximately 40% of a British pound sterling.}} out of a total estimated tax of 75,227,500 pts.&lt;ref&gt;Afaf Lutfi as-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the reign of Muhammad Ali'', Chapter 11, page 252; Cambridge Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt; Timidly he approached Ibrahim Pasha with these facts, and together came up with a report and a plan. Anticipating his father's initial reaction, İbrahim arranged for Muhammad Ali's favourite daughter to break the news. It did little, if any, good. The resulting rage was far beyond what any had been expected, and it took six full days for a tenuous peace to take hold.

A year later while Ibrahim, progressively crippled by rheumatic pains and tuberculosis (he was beginning to cough up blood), was sent to Italy to take the waters, Muhammad Ali, in 1846, travelled to Constantinople. There he approached the Sultan, expressed his fears, and made his peace, explaining: "[My son] Ibrahim is old and sick, [my grandson] Abbas is indolent (''happa''), and then children will rule Egypt. How will they keep Egypt?"&lt;ref&gt;Nubar Pasha,''Memoirs'', p.63.&lt;/ref&gt;
After he secured hereditary rule for his family, the Wali ruled until 1848, when senility made further governance by him impossible.

[[File:Tomb Muhammad Ali Pasha 2.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Muhammad Ali in Alabaster Mosque in Cairo]]

It soon came to the point where his son and heir, the mortally ailing Ibrahim, had no choice but to travel to Constantinople and request that the Sultan recognize him ruler of Egypt and Sudan even though his father was still alive. However, on the ship returning home, Ibrahim, gripped by fever and guilt, succumbed to seizures and hallucinations. He survived the journey but within six months was dead. He was succeeded by his nephew (Tosun's son) [[Abbas I of Egypt|Abbas I]].

By this time Muhammad Ali had become so ill and senile that he was not informed of his son's death. Lingering a few months more, Muhammad Ali died at [[Ras el-Tin Palace]] in [[Alexandria]] on 2 August 1849, and ultimately was buried in the imposing mosque he had commissioned in the [[Cairo Citadel]].

But the immediate reaction to his death was noticeably low key, thanks in no small part to the contempt the new wāli Abbas Pasha had always felt towards his grandfather.

Eye-witness British consul John Murray wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;... the ceremonial of the funeral was a most meagre, miserable affair; the [diplomatic] Consular was not invited to attend, and neither the shops nor the Public offices were closed – in short, a general impression prevails that Abbas Pasha has shown a culpable lack of respect for the memory of his illustrious grandfather, in allowing his obsequies to be conducted in so paltry a manner, and in neglecting to attend them in person.

&lt;br&gt;...[the] attachment and veneration of all classes in Egypt for the name of Muhammad Ali are prouder obsequies than any of which it was in power of his successor to confer. The old inhabitants remember and talk of the chaos and anarchy from which he rescued this country; the younger compare his energetic rule with the capricious, vacillating government of his successor; all classes whether Turk, or Arab, not only feel, but do not hesitate to say openly that the prosperity of Egypt has died with Muhammad Ali...In truth my Lord, it cannot be denied, that Muhammad Ali, notwithstanding all his faults was a great man.&lt;ref&gt;F.O. 78/804. Murray to Palmerston, September 1849&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Historical debate==
[[File:Muhammadalipasha.jpg|thumb|A portrait of Muhammad Ali of Egypt by [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]].]]

The prevailing historical view of Muhammad Ali is as the 'Father of Modern Egypt', being the first ruler since the [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|Ottoman conquest in 1517]] to permanently divest the [[Sublime Porte|Porte]] of its power in Egypt. While failing to achieve formal independence for Egypt during his lifetime, he was successful in laying the foundation for a modern Egyptian state. In the process of building an army to defend and expand his realm, he built a central bureaucracy, an educational system that allowed social mobility, and an economic base that included an agricultural cash crop, cotton, and military-based manufacturing. His efforts established his progeny as the rulers of Egypt and Sudan for nearly 150 years and rendered Egypt a de facto independent state.&lt;ref&gt;The 'Father of Modern Egypt' school includes: Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad ‘Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1965); Arthur Goldschmidt, Jr., Modern Egypt: The Formation of a Nation-State (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1988); Albert Haurani, ''A History of the Arab Peoples'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2002); Jean Lacouture and Simonne Lacouture, ''Egypt in Transition', trans. Francis Scarfe (New York: Criterion Books, 1958); P.J. Vatikiotis, ''The History of Modern Egypt: From Muhammad Ali to Mubarak'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1991). The following internet sources, while not necessarily scholarly, show how widespread this interpretation is. "History," The Egyptian Presidency, 2008, {{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.gov.eg/html/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517072053/http://www.presidency.gov.eg/html/history.html |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }} (accessed 29 October 2008); Metz, Helen, Chapin. "Muhammad Ali of Egypt 1805–48," Egypt: a Country Study, 1990, http://countrystudies.us/egypt/ (accessed 29 October 2008); "Muhammad Ali of Egypt 1805–48: The Father of Modern Egypt," Travel to Egypt – Egypt Travel Guide, 2007, http://www.travel-to-egypt.net/muhammad-ali.html (accessed 29 October 2008); "Muhammad Ali of Egypt," Answer.com, 2008, http://www.answers.com/topic/muhammad-ali  (accessed 29 October 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, however, view him not as a builder, but rather as a conqueror. He was of Albanian origin rather than Egyptian, and throughout his reign, Turkish was the official language of his court rather than Arabic. Some argue that he exploited Egyptian manpower and resources for his own personal ends, not Egyptian national ones, with the manpower requirements that he placed on Egyptians being particularly onerous. Taken together in this light, Muhammad Ali is cast by some as another in a long line of foreign conquerors dating back to the [[History of Persian Egypt|Persian occupation]] in 525&amp;nbsp;B.C.&lt;ref&gt;The 'Foreign Ruler' school includes: Morroe Berger, ''Military Elite and Social Change: Egypt Since Napoleon'' (Princeton, NJ: Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, 1960); William L. Cleveland, ''A History of the Modern Middle East'' (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1994); Khaled Fahmy, ''All the Pash'a Men: Mehmed Ali, His Army and the Making of Modern Egypt'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997); Haseeba, Khadijah. {{cite web |title=Year’s Lesson |publisher=UCLA Center for Near East Studies |year=2003 |url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/cnes/people/article.asp?parentid=12110 |accessdate=29 October 2008}} Tom Little, ''Modern Egypt'' (London: Ernest Benn Limited, 1967); Afaf Lutfi Al-Sayyid Marsot, ''Egypt in the Reign of Muhammad Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1984); John Marlowe, ''A History of Modern Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Relations 1800–1953'' (New York: Praeger, 1954).&lt;/ref&gt; This view, however, is at odds with the majority opinion of Egyptian, and other Arab historians, and Egyptian public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammed Heikal, ''Origins of Establishment''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the historical debate regarding Muhammad Ali reflects the simultaneous political struggles which occurred in Egypt during the 20th century. [[Fuad I of Egypt]] in the 1930s sponsored the collection, arrangement, and translation of the available historical documents relating to his predecessors, which became the Royal Archives of Egypt. These Royal Archives represented the primary and, in the case of some important works,&lt;ref&gt;For example, Henry Dodwell, ''The Founder of Modern Egypt: A Study of Muhammad 'Ali'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1931)&lt;/ref&gt; the only source of information for Egyptian history until the sharia court records became available in the 1970s. Fuad's portrayal of Muhammad Ali as a [[Egyptian nationalism|nationalist]] and benevolent monarch therefore heavily influenced the historical debate. Later, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] and his revolutionary republican regime promoted an alternative narrative which portrayed Muhammad Ali as the nationalist founder of modern Egypt but also an ambitious monarch with little regard for his people whose policies ultimately benefited himself and his dynasty at the expense of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Fahmy, ''Mehmed Ali: From Ottoman Governor to Ruler of Egypt'' (Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3798">'''Muhammad ibn al-Ba'ith ibn Halbas''' ({{lang-fa|محمدبن‌بعیث}}) (circa early 9th century) also known as '''Ibn Ba'ith''' (Son of Ba'ith) was an Arab governor of [[Marand]] during the Abbassid caliphate.&lt;ref name="Minorsky"&gt;Minorsky, “Marand” in Encyclopaedia of Islam. Edited by: P. Bearman , Th. Bianquis , C.E. Bosworth , E. van Donzel and W.P. Heinrichs. Vol. 6, (1991): pg 504 "According to one of al-Tabari's authorities (iii, 1388), the shaykhs of Maragha who praised the bravery and literary ability (adab) of Ibn Bai'th also quoted his Persian verses (bi'l-fdrisiyya). This important passage, already quoted by Barthold, BSOS, ii (1923), 836-8, is evidence of the existence of the cultivation of poetry in Persian in northwestern Persia at the beginning of the 9th century. Ibn Bai’th must have been Iranicised to a considerable extent, and, as has been mentioned, he relied for support on the non-Arab elements in his Rustakhs (‘Uludj Rasatikhi’)”&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the [[Arab conquest of Persia]], Halbas (his grandfather), who was a mercenary took [[Marand]]. Muhammad ibn al-Ba'ith built castles in Marand and eventually took [[Tabriz]] (815 AD) and [[Shahi (city)|Shahi]] (a place near [[Lake Urmia]]).&lt;ref name="Minorsky"/&gt;  He started in good terms with the [[Khurramite]] movement of [[Babak Khorramdin|Babak]], but later joined the Caliph against the Khurramites by capturing one of Babak's generals.&lt;ref name="Minorsky"/&gt;  However, his relationship with the Abbassids did not last long and he was imprisoned under the Caliphate of [[Al-Mutawakkil|Mutawwakil]].&lt;ref name="Minorsky"/&gt; [[Ibn Khordadbeh]] who wrote in 848 AD mentions Marand as being Muhammad ibn al-Ba'iths fiefdom.&lt;ref name="Minorsky"/&gt;  The historian [[al-Tabari]] retells a very graphic expedition sent against the town. Tabari states that there were walls which enclosed Marand, and its garden's was a [[Parasang|Farsang]] in circumference.  The forest outside of the town gave the town of Marand further protection.  Ibn Ba'ith had collected some 2200 adventurers, reinforced by a number of non-Arab Iranian elements.&lt;ref name="Minorsky"/&gt;  But this was not enough and he was seized in around 849-850 AD by the forces of the Abbassid caliphate.&lt;ref name="Minorsky"/&gt;  When he was taken to the court of Mutawwakil, the Caliph ordered Ibn Ba'ith to be beheaded.  However, Ibn Ba'ith recited some [[Arabic poetry]] and Mutawwakil was amazed by his poetic gifts. Subsequently he was only imprisoned and he died in prison.

Ibn Ba'ith was also considerably Iranicized and the elders of [[Maragha]] praised his bravery and quoted his [[Persian poetry]].&lt;ref name="Minorsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moḥammad Amin Riāḥi 1996"&gt;Jamal-Din Ḵalil Šarvāni, Nozhat al-majāles, ed. Moḥammad Amin Riāḥi, Tehran, 2nd ed. Tehran, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Original Arabic from Tabari on this passage:
«‌حد ثني انه انشدني بالمراغه جماعه من اشياخها اشعاراً لابن البعيث بالفارسيه و تذكرون ادبه و شجاعه و له اخباراً و احاديث»
طبري، محمدبن جرير، تاريخ طبري، جلد 7، چاپ دوم، انتشارات اساطير، 1363.
Tabari, the History of Tabari, volume 7, 2nd edition, Asatir Publications, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  His Persian poetry also is an evidence of the existence of the cultivation of poetry in Persian in northwest Iran (Azerbaijan) at the beginning of the 9th century.&lt;ref name="Minorsky"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moḥammad Amin Riāḥi 1996"/&gt;

'''Nadine Bernadette Neumann''' (born 3 December 1975) is an Australian former [[breaststroke]] [[swimming (sport)|swimmer]] who by the age of 20 had already lived a lifetime of success and setbacks. She overcame [[chronic fatigue syndrome]] at the age of 15, only to have her dream of an Olympic berth in Barcelona shattered by a broken neck. She fought back to compete for Australia at the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta, where she finished in sixth position, clocking 2:28.34 in the final of the [[Swimming at the 1996 Summer Olympics - Women's 200 metre breaststroke|200-metre breaststroke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Sports Reference profile | work = Sports Reference | year = 2014 | url = https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ne/nadine-neumann-1.html|accessdate = 20 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to Captain the Australian Swimming Team at the 1998 Commonwealth Games and 1999 Pan Pacific Championships, competing in the 400-metre Individual Medley, 200-metre Butterfly and 800-metre Freestyle events as well as the breaststroke.

Upon retiring from competitive swimming, Nadine had to completely re-define her life. She worked in public relations and marketing before beginning her teaching career at [[Cheltenham Girls High School]] as an English teacher. After her move to Newcastle, New South Wales, she taught English to students studying for their trade certificate and HSC concurrently at the Australian Technical College – Hunter and ran a wellbeing program in high schools which she designed to engage, empower and equip young people for a healthy future.

Her memoir, ''Wobbles – An Olympic Story'', won the 2009 IP Picks Award for Best Creative Non-Fiction and was published the same year. She has published a number of other short pieces and is currently working on a picture book for teenagers and a historical fiction novel based on the lives of her two grandmothers. Nadine is also studying to complete a Graduate Diploma in Psychology as a follow-on from her teaching and youth work qualifications.

She lives with her husband and four young children in the Hunter Valley, NSW, and occasionally enjoys sharing her technique tips with young swimmers. She also teaches English and is a well-being counselour at Linuwel School in East Maitland.

'''Papa Lazarou''' is a fictional character in the [[BBC]] TV comedy programme ''[[The League of Gentlemen (comedy)|The League of Gentlemen]].'' He appears in four episodes – the first episode in the second series, the Christmas special, the final episode of the third series, and the final episode of the fourth series – and in the film ''[[The League of Gentlemen's Apocalypse]]''. The character is part-written by and played by [[Reece Shearsmith]]. Papa Lazarou has been listed as both the 8th and 14th most popular sketch of all time with British audiences, according to the ''[[Radio Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4052641.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Python Dead Parrot is top sketch |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-11-29 |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Channel 4]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/comedy_sketches/results.html |title=50 Greatest Comedy Sketches |publisher=Channel4 |date= |accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

==Origins==

Despite being one of the more bizarre characters in the series, Papa Lazarou was in fact loosely based on a real person, Peter Papalazarou, who was the [[landlord]] of a flat in which [[Reece Shearsmith]] and [[Steve Pemberton]] lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnP9kjcLoEo|title=The League of Gentlemen- Origin of Papa Lazarou|last=|first=|date=21 May 2008|website=You Tube|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On occasion, when he called, he would only ever ask for "Steve" (Pemberton), and would refuse to talk to Shearsmith. Many of the sayings in the show are fictional and for comedy purposes.  Papalazarou is a common [[Greeks|Greek]] surname.

==Appearances in The League of Gentlemen==

Papa Lazarou's first appearance in ''The League of Gentlemen'' is in the first episode of the second series  Destination: Royston Vasey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0630121/|title=Destination: Royston Vasey|last=Doe|first=John|date=14 January 2000|website=IMDb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first appearance he runs the Pandemonium Carnival, and has three diminutive helpers called Simba, Pebbil and Tiktik. He is seen to collect wives by forcing his way into women's homes posing as a humble peg-seller, then talking gibberish at them, invariably referring to them as 'Dave', until they hand over their wedding ring. Once they do this he exclaims, "You're my wife now!". His first visit to the town ends when the noses of the circus audience start bleeding simultaneously. Out-weirded by Royston Vasey, he and the other circus performers flee.

Lazarou's next appearance is during the Christmas Special, Yule Never Leave. It is revealed that the town vicar Bernice's mother was kidnapped by Lazarou when she was a child. Lazarou then kidnaps Bernice and takes her away with members of his circus troupe at the end of the special.

In the Third series, Lazarou disguises himself as an Amateur Theatre director called Keith Drop. This alter ego is used as a front to capture more wives. Lazarou used the makeup tips he has gleaned from his wives to effect a very convincing transformation. As Keith he helps out in the charity shop with Reenie Calver (whose friend, Vinnie Wythenshaw has been killed in an accident). This was merely a front for Lazarou to gain more wives. Despite being rumbled by Brian and Reenie, he manages to evade capture. It is also revealed that he imprisons his wives and anyone who tries to follow him inside circus animals. In the third series audio commentary the League revealed this is just one of a number of things (many of which haven't been shown) that he does with his captives.

Lazarou's most recent appearance was in the 2017 anniversary special, where he used a photo booth to capture a number of Royston Vasey women, including Iris and Tubbs, to create a “wife mine”. It is revealed that the rights to Royston Vasey land was sold to him by current town mayor, Reverend Bernice.

==Appearances in Other Media==

During the Comic Aid Telethon to raise fund for relief in the aftermath of the South Asian Tsunami in 2004, Lazarou appeared in a specially written sketch performed live during the telethon, alongside his wife played by Mark Gatiss. During this appearance, Lazarou attempts to kidnap Miranda Richardson, before Tubbs kidnaps her instead.

{{cquote|Please do what he says, he's a very dangerous man. He'll shit on you and set you on fire.|author=Mark Gatiss, Comic Aid}}

== Characterisation and Physical Appearance ==
Papa Lazarou is a demonic circus master and collector of wives. He has a rasping voice, an indefinable accent, and blackface. It is revealed that his skin is actually black and white, and uses pink foundation to appear Caucasian. The character is one of the most bizarre and mysterious of the League's. Some of the women in his 'book of wives', seen in series three, appear to have lived over a century ago. This hints at the character's unnatural lifespan. When he was tied to a bed in the charity shop he reveals he has the supernatural gift of being able to speak with the voices of deceased people he has never met, although it seems he cannot directly commune with the dead, as evidenced by the unconvincing medium act he performed when his circus came to town the previous year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2783">'''Pieter Corbeels''' ([[Leuven]], 12 March 1755 – [[Tournai]], 21 June 1799) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] book printer and resistance leader. He was a founder of the Belgian based publishing company [[Brepols]]. He commanded part of the [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabantine]] forces during a revolt against the French Revolutionary regime known as the ''[[Peasants' War (1798)|Boerenkrijg]]'' ("Peasants' War"). For his role in the war he was executed.

==Service in Austrian Army==

Corbeels, was a corporal in the [[Austria]]n army. He fought in the rebel army of [[Jean-André van der Mersch]], who won the [[Battle of Turnhout (1789)|Battle of Turnhout]] against the Austrians in 1789. After the defeat of the [[Brabant Revolution]], he started a printing business in Leuven in 1790. He established his printing business in the Gommarushuis in the Tiensestraat in Leuven. Corbeels printed besides the ordinary, ordered printed papers, also a large number of inciting leaflets and almanacs. For this he was arrested by the French, on 28 November 1792, and transferred to [[Valenciennes]] in France. On 15 December 1792, he was released whereupon he resumed printing. In 1793 he moved into the house called ''Hertog van Brabant'' on the ''Grote Markt'' of Leuven. In 1796, he moved with his wife, Barbara Panz, and assistant, [[Philippus Jacobus Brepols]], to [[Turnhout]], where he was less impeded by the French. On 16 September 1797, his wife died and on 31 October he remarried with Joanna Antonia Servaes.

==Life in Turnhout and Peasants War== 

Corbeels remarried while living in Turnhout, and he left Turnhout in the summer of 1798 as a leader of the ''Boerenkrijg'' also known as the [[Peasants' War (1798)]] against the French. &lt;ref&gt;http://historiek.net/de-boerenkrijg/8675/&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 November 1798, he was caught in Postel and taken by the French, whereupon he ended up in the prison, and was executed, together with Albert Meulemans, on 21 June 1799 in Tournai.

His widow initially continued the printing business, together with Philippus Jacobus Brepols. But in 1800 he bought the business from her. The [[Brepols]] printing business in Turnhout, grew out of this.

He twice ran for leader of the [[Liberal Party of New Brunswick|New Brunswick Liberals]]. He lost in 1982 to [[Doug Young (politician)|Doug Young]] and in 1985 to [[Frank McKenna]]. He served as [[interim leader (Canada)|interim leader]] of the party from 1983 to 1985 and again from October 1997 to May 1998, also serving as [[Premier of New Brunswick|Premier]].

Following his political career, Frenette was appointed by [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean Chrétien]] to be a director of [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] (AECL) for a three-year term from 1998–2001 following which he served as chair from 2001–05.

Jensen writes for popular media, both alternative and mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Jensen | first = Robert | url = http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~rjensen/articles.html | title = Robert W.

==Controversy==

===9/11 opinion piece===
Jensen wrote an opinion piece for the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' on September 14, 2001, shortly after the [[September 11th terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref name=Houston_Chronicle&gt;{{cite news | last = Jensen | first = Robert | title = U.S. just as guilty of committing own violent acts | work = [[Houston Chronicle]] | publisher = [[Hearst Corporation]] | url = http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~rjensen/freelance/attack1.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151018091758/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~rjensen/freelance/attack1.htm | date = September 14, 2001 | archive-date = October 18, 2015 | access-date = November 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the piece, Jensen wrote that the September 11th terrorist attacks were "reprehensible and indefensible" but "no more despicable than the massive acts of terrorism – the deliberate killing of civilians for political purposes – that the U.S. government has committed during my lifetime."&lt;ref name=Houston_Chronicle /&gt;

Jensen's piece drew both praise and criticism. Some individuals demanded that The University of Texas fire Jensen. In response, University of Texas President [[Larry Faulkner]] wrote in a letter to the editor published in the Houston Chronicle that he was "disgusted by Jensen's article" and called Jensen "a fountain of undiluted foolishness on issues of public policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Lee | last = Nichols | title = War of Words | date = September 28, 2001 | url = http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2001-09-28/83161/ | work = [[The Austin Chronicle]] | publisher = Nick Barbaro | accessdate = November 23, 2013 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121104163401/http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2001-09-28/83161/ | archivedate=November 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views on transgender ideology ===
In early July 2014, MonkeyWrench Books collective cut all ties with Jensen over his article reviewing two feminist books that critiqued transgenderism.&lt;ref name=MonkeyWrench_Books&gt;{{cite web | last = MonkeyWrench books collective | url = http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=6cd8e997251fc0b0a88b19ea2&amp;id=a48679cee3&amp;e=1ca6c3321c | title = Smash the Cistem | website = us7.campaign-archive1.com |publisher=MonkeyWrench books collective | date = June 2014 | accessdate = July 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These books were [[Sheila Jeffreys]]' ''Gender Hurts: A Feminist Analysis of the Politics of Transgenderism'' and [[Michael Schwalbe]]'s ''Manhood Acts: Gender and the Practices of Domination''. In the review published by ''Dissident Voice'', Jensen concluded that, "On the surface, transgenderism may seem to be a more revolutionary approach, but radical feminism offers a deeper critique of the domination/subordination dynamic at the heart of patriarchy and a more promising path to liberation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Jensen | first = Robert | title = Some basic propositions about sex, gender, and patriarchy | url = http://dissidentvoice.org/2014/06/some-basic-propositions-about-sex-gender-and-patriarchy/ | website = dissidentvoice.org | publisher = Dissident Voice | date = June 13, 2014 | access-date = November 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which they felt "contributes to a dangerous culture of transphobia".&lt;ref name=MonkeyWrench_Books /&gt; In addition, Dexter M. Thomas wrote a rebuttal which was also published by ''Dissident Voice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Thomas | first = Dexter M. | title = Gender and sexual diversity | url = http://dissidentvoice.org/2014/06/gender-and-sexual-diversity/ | website = dissidentvoice.org | publisher = Dissident Voice | date = June 21, 2014 | access-date = November 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen responded by writing a follow-up article which elaborated on his views on the ecological and social implications of the trans ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Jensen | first = Robert | title = Ecological and social implications of trans and climate change | url = http://dissidentvoice.org/2014/09/ecological-and-social-implications-of-trans-and-climate-change/ | website = dissidentvoice.org | publisher = Dissident Voice | date = September 12, 2014 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170724062046/http://dissidentvoice.org:80/2014/09/ecological-and-social-implications-of-trans-and-climate-change/ |archive-date=2017-07-24 | access-date = November 9, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salem Chaker''' (born 1950 in [[Nevers]]) is an Algerian Berberologist. He's a specialist in Berber linguistics (syntax, diachrony, sociolinguistics). He is recognized as the "dean" of modern Berber studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xVpxZSTyhb0C|title=The Berber Identity Movement and the Challenge to North African States|last=Maddy-Weitzman|first=Bruce|date=|publisher=University of Texas Press|year=2011|isbn=9780292745056|location=|pages=115|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Salem Chaker was born in 1950 in Nevers, France. In a family from Ait Iraten tribe of Kabylia. He studied at the [[University of Provence]], then in [[Paris Descartes University]] where he received his [[Doctorate|''Doctorat de troisième cycle'']] in 1973 and a [[Habilitation|''Doctorat d'Etat'']] in 1978. After an early career in the Faculty of Letters of Algiers and CRAPE (''Centre de Recherches Anthropologiques Préhistoriques et Ethnologiques'') from 1973 to 1981, he joins University of Provence serving as an associate professor of Berber Language from 1981 to 1983, and [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] from 1984 to 1989 where he continued his research activities in the laboratory LAPMO (''Laboratoire d'anthropologie et de préhistoire de la Méditerranée occidentale'') founded and directed by [[Gabriel Camps]]. From 1989 to 2008, he worked as a Berber Language Professor at ''[[Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales]]'' ("''Langues'O''") in Paris, where he created in 1990 ''[[Centre de Recherche Berbère]]'' (Berber Research Center) he directed until the end of 2009. He is currently Professor of Berber language at the [[Aix-Marseille University]] where he is also a research associate at Iremam (''Institut de recherches et d'études sur le monde arabe et musulman'').&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.openedition.org/encyclopedieberbere/2534|title=Salem Chaker|last=|first=|date=|website=Encyclopédie berbère [Online]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://iremam.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article50&amp;lang=fr|title=Iremam - CHAKER Salem (PU)|last=|first=|date=|website=Institut de recherches et d'études sur les mondes arabes et musulmans Iremam - UMR 7310|language=fr|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Encyclopédie berbère ===
His involvement in the ''[[Encyclopédie berbère]]'' dates back to the launching phase of the project by Gabriel Camps in 1970, when he was still a student at the University of Provence. The founding team comprising only pre-historians and ethnologists, Gabriel asked him to invest in the linguistic field. Thus appeared his first contribution to the Encyclopedie, in Fascicle 1, dated 1970, of the provisional edition with restricted diffusion. It was also his first scientific text, while he was still studying linguistics. He started publishing regularly entries in the provisional edition, then in the final edition from 1984. At the launch of the final edition, he officially became a scientific advisor for linguistics. When Camps retired in 1992, he asked him to ensure the succession of the Encyclopédie berbère in case of default. Salem Chaker has been in charge of the ''Encyclopédie'' since the death of G. Camps in September 2002.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Sergio Panunzio''' (July 20, 1886 &amp;ndash; October 8, 1944) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[:wikt:theoretician|theoretician]] of [[national syndicalism]]. In the 1920s, he became a major theoretician of [[Italian Fascism]].

==Early life==
Sergio Panunzio was born on July 20, 1886 in [[Molfetta]], Italy. He started his political involvement young by associating with syndicalist circles in 1902.  From the [[University of Naples]], he obtained two degrees in [[jurisprudence]] in 1908 and in [[philosophy]] in 1911. 

==Career==
Panunzio became the head of the Fascist Faculty of Political Sciences at [[Perugia University]] in 1928.

Panunzio said that syndicalism is the historical development of [[Marxism]]. He pointed to [[George Sorel]] and [[Francesco Saverio Merlino]] as revising [[Karl Marx|Marx]] to fit the times and emboldening it.  He is said to have spearheaded the [[Marxist revisionism|revisionism]] that led many syndicalists through [[Economic interventionism|interventionism]] to [[corporativism]] and he ostensibly "gave [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]’s dictatorship a veneer of revolutionary legitimacy."&lt;ref name="ju.edu"&gt;{{cite web | author=Clarke, Jay | title=Fascism and Bolshevis | work=History of Modern Italy | url=http://users.ju.edu/jclarke/hy350italyclarke.htm | accessdate=2006-04-24|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050315080916/http://users.ju.edu/jclarke/hy350italyclarke.htm |archivedate = 2005-03-15}} (From the [[Internet Archive]], 15 March 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Panunzio criticized the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] state as a "dictatorship ''over'' the proletariat, and not ''of'' the proletariat." Also, he is quoted as saying "[[Moscow]] bows before the light radiating from [[Rome]]. The [[Communist International]] no longer speaks to the spirit; it is dead." He opposed the [[anti-Semitic]] campaign of 1938. A strong supporter of the state for its own sake, he had a long-running academic dispute with [[corporatism|corporatist]] [[Carlo Costamagna]] regarding the role of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philip Rees]], ''[[Biographical Dictionary of the Extreme Right Since 1890]]'', 1990, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Panunzio died on October 8, 1944.

He was born in [[Lutsk]] and resided there until 1754, when he moved to Chufut-Qaleh (Crimea) by invitation of the rich patron Mordecai ben Berakhah, one of the heads of the local community, to become the new head of their [[Madrasa]]. He was a copyist of early Karaite Jewish manuscripts, and wrote various studies of theology, philosophy, halakhah, and kabbalah. His "Light of the Righteous" (1757)&lt;ref&gt;"Karaite Judaism and Historical Understanding", By Fred Astren, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; is a history of [[Karaite Judaism]] and its literature in which he presented a [[silsila]] for the [[Sevel HaYerushah]] (the Karaite Jewish "unwritten" version of the [[Mishna]]&lt;ref&gt;"From Judah Hadassi to Elijah Bashyatchi: Studies in Late Medieval Karaite Philosophy" By Daniel Lasker. pp. 143-144&lt;/ref&gt;) from [[Judah ben Tabbai]].

In the introduction to most of his works he mentioned that he was the son of Moses son of Simhah, son of Joseph son of Yeshu'a (died in Derazhne in 1649 during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]]), son of Simḥah, son of Yeshu'a, son of Samuel, of a noble family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6102">'''Slovak names''' consist of a [[given name]] and a [[surname|family name]] (surname). [[Slovakia]] uses the [[Personal name#Name order|Western name order]] with the given name first and the surname last, although there is a historical tradition to reverse this order, especially in official context (like in administrative papers and legal documents) as well as on gravestones and memorials. 

Most [[Slovak people|Slovaks]] do not have a middle name. The family name forms for males and females are distinct in Slovakia, making it possible to identify [[gender]] from the name alone. As of 2003 there were 185,288 different family names in use among 5.4 million Slovaks, or one family name for every 29 citizens. There is an estimated 90,000 lineages in Slovakia.&lt;ref name=Geni&gt;{{cite web|title=Najčastejšie priezviská na Slovensku (Most common family names in Slovakia)|url=http://www.geni.sk/najcastejsie-priezviska-na-slovensku/|publisher=Geni.sk|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With marriage, the bride typically adopts the bridegroom's surname. Slovak names are very similar to [[Czech name]]s.

The most common Slovak given name are [[Joseph (given name)|Jozef]] (male) and [[Maria (given name)|Mária]] (female); the most common family name in Slovakia is [[Horváth]] (male) and Horváthová (female).

==Given name==
{{further|Name days in Slovakia}}

[[Given name]]s in [[Slovakia]] are called ''baptismal names'' ({{lang-sk|krstné mená}}) even though today they are completely separate from the Christian [[baptismal name]]s. Proper baptismal names given during [[infant baptism]] are still common in the countryside, yet they are only seldom used within the official name (if they are, they form the person's middle name). Generally, names in Slovakia can be of several distinct origins:
* [[Slavic names]] of pre-Christian origin (e.g. [[Dobromil (given name)|Dobromil]])
* [[Christian name]]s often inspired by [[saint]]s (e.g. [[Vojtech]])
* Names of past kings and rulers (e.g. [[Ladislav]])
* Modern names (e.g. [[Lukas]])
* Names of ethnic minorities living in Slovakia (e.g. [[Béla (given name)|Béla]])

Traditionally, it was common to choose a given name for the newborn from within the family; grandfather and grandmother names being particularly popular. While this is no longer as common as in the past, it is still widely practiced especially in the rural areas.

Many Slovak given names, like in most other Slavic naming systems, have a [[diminutive]] and shorter version, which is used in an informal context. For example, the diminutive of Slavomír is Slavo, of Vojtech — Vojto, of Alexandra — Saša, etc. Sometimes these diminutive names become independent and "official" given names. Some older, traditional given names have distinct shortened forms, quite different from the original, for example Štefan — Pišta, etc. These traditional shortened forms are becoming quite rare in everyday usage.

==Surnames==

Surnames differ according to gender. Generally feminine form is created by adding suffix "ová" to the masculine form. In some cases a "y"/"ý" at the end of a masculine name is replaced with an "á".  Feminine names almost always end in "á" while masculine names almost never do. Note that [[á]] is a different character from [[a]]. For example, Bača is a masculine form while Bačová would be feminine.  Because Slovakia also has people with Hungarian, German, and other ancestors, some surnames in Slovakia will follow the convention of those languages and not conform to these norms.

'''Suleiman Kabalan Frangieh,''' last name also spelled '''''Frangié,''''' '''''Franjieh,''''' or '''''Franjiyeh''''' (15 June 1910 – 23 July 1992) ({{Lang-ar|سليمان فرنجية}}), was a [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] [[Maronite]] [[politician]], [[List of Presidents of Lebanon|President]] of [[Lebanon]] from 1970 to 1976.

==Early life and education==
Suleiman Frangieh was a scion of one of the leading [[Maronite Christianity in Lebanon|Maronite]] families of [[Zgharta]], near [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]; the family's name comes from the Greek ''Φρὰγκοι'' (pron. "Franggi"), after the [[Franks]].

Frangieh was born in [[Zgharta]] on 15 June 1910.&lt;ref name=wofl&gt;{{cite web|title=Suleiman Franjiyah|url=http://wars.meskawi.nl/people.html#6|publisher=Wars of Lebanon|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the second son of a politician, Kabalan Suleiman Frangieh. His mother was Lamia Raffoul. Kabalan Frangieh was District Governor of Ehden (1908-1913) and a Member of Parliament (1929-1932). His grandfather, Suleiman Ghnatios Frangieh, was District Governor of Ehden (1904-1908).&lt;ref name=tmnews&gt;{{cite news|title=Requiem Mass for President Sleiman Kabalan Frangieh (1910-1992)|url=http://www.marada-news.org/?q=node/4012|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=The Marada News|date=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suleiman Frangieh's brother [[Hamid Beik Frangieh|Hamid]] served as Foreign Minister under the French mandate in 1939.&lt;ref name=fisk92/&gt;

Suleiman Kabalan Frangieh received education at [[Antoura]], near [[Beirut]].&lt;ref name=nyties92&gt;{{cite news|last=Pace|first=Eric|title=Suleiman Franjieh, Lebanese Ex-Chief, Dies at 82|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/24/nyregion/suleiman-franjieh-lebanese-ex-chief-dies-at-82.html|accessdate=4 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 July 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also educated in [[Tripoli]] and Beirut.&lt;ref name=wofl/&gt;

==Career and presidency==
Suleiman Frangieh dealt with the export-import business in Beirut for a time before his political career.&lt;ref name=nyties92/&gt; In 1957, he was accused in the machine-gun slaying of more than a score of members of a competing clan, the [[Douaihy]]s, in a church not far from [[Zgharta]].&lt;ref name=nyties92/&gt; More specifically, he was believed to be responsible for killing around 700 people, 20 of them Christians shot to death during a requiem mass in the north Lebanese town of Miziara.&lt;ref name=fisk92/&gt; Therefore, he had to take refuge in the Syrian coastal city of [[Latakia]], where he met with two Syrian army officers, [[Hafez al-Assad|Hafez]] and [[Rifaat al-Assad|Rifaat Assad]] who would be his friends.&lt;ref name=nyties92/&gt; In 1958, he benefited from the amnesty and returned to Lebanon.&lt;ref name=mug08jul&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mugraby | first = Muhamad | title = The syndrome of one-time exceptions and the drive to establish the proposed Hariri court | journal = [[Mediterranean Politics]], special issue: The Politics of Violence, Truth and Reconciliation in the Arab Middle East | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–194 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/13629390802127513 | date = July 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13629390802127513 | ref = harv | postscript = . }} [http://www.cggl.org/publicdocs/20080707.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012044649/http://www.cggl.org/publicdocs/20080707.pdf |date=2013-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tsr16sept&gt;{{cite news|title=Feuds rampant in Lebanon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hdoRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5e4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7109,315468&amp;dq=gemayel+family+in+lebanon&amp;hl=en|accessdate=23 March 2013|newspaper=The Spokesman Review|date=16 September 1982|agency=AP|location=Beirut}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, Frangieh was elected to his elder brother [[Hamid Frangieh|Hamid]]'s old seat in the Lebanese Parliament.&lt;ref name=nyties92/&gt;&lt;ref name=tmnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=zagehd&gt;{{cite web|title=Minister Hamid Frangieh: (1907-1981)|url=http://www.zgharta-ehden.org/node/4143|publisher=Zgharta-Ehden|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became the head of his clan due to Hamid's illness.&lt;ref name=zagehd/&gt; Frangieh was reelected to the Parliament in 1964 and 1968. Until 1970, he held the following ministerial posts: minister of post, telegraph and telephone (1960-1961), minister of agriculture (1961), minister of interior (1968), minister of justice (1968-1969) and minister of economy (1968-1970).&lt;ref name=tmnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=rulers2&gt;{{cite web|title=Franjieh, Suleiman (Kabalan)|url=http://rulers.org/indexf2.html#franj|work=Rulers|accessdate=24 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the closest and possibly most controversial presidential election in [[History of Lebanon|Lebanese history]], the [[Parliament of Lebanon|National Assembly]] elected Frangieh to the Presidency of the Republic on 23 September 1970. He owed his upset victory over [[Elias Sarkis]], the official candidate of the Chehabi regime to a last minute change of mind by [[Kamal Jumblatt]], whose supporters in the Parliament switched their votes to Frangieh.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} 
[[Image:Michel Sassine and Suleiman Franjieh.jpg|thumb|left|Deputy Speaker [[Michel Georges Sassine|Michel Sassine]] declaring Suleiman Franjieh President of [[Lebanon]] in 1970]]
Posing as a consensus candidate, Frangieh drew support from both the right and the left and from all religious factions; his election was a backlash to the administrations of Presidents of [[Fuad Chehab]] (1958–1964) and [[Charles Helou]] (1964–1970) and the "Deuxième Bureau" ({{Lang-ar|المكتب الثاني}}) run by the preceding two administrations of Chehab and Helou, as the opposing candidate Elias Sarkis who was head of the [[Banque du Liban]] (Central Bank of Lebanon) was widely seen as a continuation of the earlier Chehabi regime.

There were three rounds of elections that year:&lt;br/&gt;
Round 1 - 99 Deputies, 5 candidates - no majority&lt;br/&gt;
Round 2 - 99 Deputies, 2 candidates - 50 votes each (1 fake vote found), round was negated.&lt;br/&gt;
Round 3 - 99 Deputies, 2 candidates, Kamal Jumblatt assigns one of his deputies to vote for Frangieh.  Suleiman Frangieh becomes President legally. The events listed above as per the testimony of the late Kamal Joumblatt of his role in the vote.

[[Sabri Hamadeh]], then Speaker of Parliament, had refused to announce the election of a President on a 1-vote difference. As Hamadeh exited parliament [[Michel Georges Sassine|Michel Sassine]], Deputy Speaker of Parliament, stepped up and exercised his powers of Deputy to announce Frangieh President.&lt;ref name=akouri&gt;{{cite news|last=Akouri|first=George|title=Talking To: Edmund Rizk|url=http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=13521|accessdate=24 October 2012|newspaper=Now Lebanon|date=18 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frangieh's term lasted until 22 September 1976.&lt;ref name=tmnews/&gt;

Frangie's term ended in 1976 when Elias Sarkis was elected as president. However, Sarkis could move to office four months after his election on 23 September 1976, since Frangieh objected at first to leave office.&lt;ref name=rulers&gt;{{cite web|title=Elias Sarkis|url=http://rulers.org/indexs1.html#sarki|work=Rulers|accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The civil war years==
[[Lebanese Civil War|Civil war]] in Lebanon began on 13 April 1975.&lt;ref name=khazen04&gt;{{cite journal|last=El Khazen|first=Farid|title=Ending conflict in wartime Lebanon: Reform, sovereignty and power, 1976–88|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|year=2004|volume=40|issue=1|pages=65–84|doi=10.1080/00263200412331301897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frangieh as the Lebanese President declared the Constitutional Document on 14 February 1976 that was the first serious initiative to end the conflict and reach a consensus.&lt;ref name=khazen04/&gt; The document empowered prime minister and suggested a "parity between Christians and Muslims in Parliament", reducing the power of Maronites.&lt;ref name=khazen04/&gt;&lt;ref name=rab1sep&gt;{{cite news|last=Rabil|first=Robert G.|title=The Maronites and Syrian withdrawal: from "isolationists" to "traitors"?|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Maronites+and+Syrian+withdrawal%3a+from+%22isolationists%22+to...-a080013150|accessdate=18 March 2013|newspaper=	Middle East Policy|date=1 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was supported by major politicians and religious leaders, it could not achieve its objectives.&lt;ref name=khazen04/&gt;

Then Frangieh invited Syrian troops into Lebanon in May 1976 in the early stages of the Lebanese civil war.&lt;ref name=unmeh&gt;{{cite web|title=Mehlis Report|url=https://www.un.org/news/dh/docs/mehlisreport/pdf/background.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs06&gt;{{cite news|title=Syria's Influence in Lebanon|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/indepth_coverage/middle_east/syria/presence.html|accessdate=5 July 2012|newspaper=PBS|date=14 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=childsol&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunter|first=Catherine|title=The South Lebanon Army (SLA) and child recruitment Putting the pressure on whom?|url=http://www.child-soldiers.org/childsoldiers/CSC_AG_Forum_case_study_June_2006_Lebanon_SLA.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509033132/http://www.child-soldiers.org/childsoldiers/CSC_AG_Forum_case_study_June_2006_Lebanon_SLA.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=9 May 2009|publisher=Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers|accessdate=5 July 2012|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had full support of the Lebanese Christians in this regard, since they thought that Syria would able to force a cease-fire and protect Christians.&lt;ref name="Zisser2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eyal Zisser|title=Commanding Syria: Bashar al-Asad and the First Years in Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pVovmiI-ijQC&amp;pg=PR6|accessdate=22 October 2012|date=26 December 2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-153-3|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is regarded as in large part being responsible for Lebanon's descent into war in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name=wofl/&gt;

When the [[Lebanese Civil War]] began, Frangieh maintained a militia, the [[Marada Brigade]], under the command of his son [[Tony Frangieh]]. He initially participated in the [[Lebanese Front]], a right-wing, mainly Christian, coalition of politicians and militia leaders, but in early 1978 he broke with them because of his own pro-Syrian leanings. In June 1978, Tony, together with his wife and infant daughter, was assassinated by militiamen with [[Kataeb Party (Lebanon)|Phalangist militia]] being accused of the plot. The killings are known as [[Ehden massacre]] after which the power of the Frangiehs decreased.&lt;ref name=wofl/&gt; Ever since then, Suleiman Frangieh was reported to have been depressed. He swore to take revenge, declaring in an interview "the family will exact its retribution."&lt;ref name=nyties92/&gt; By some accounts, he went on to engineer the killing of hundreds of Phalange members.&lt;ref name=nyties92/&gt;

==Later years==
Frangieh remained an ally of Syria. In July 1983, after [[Amine Gemayel]] became president, Frangieh along with [[Rashid Karami]] and [[Walid Jumblatt]] formed a Syrian-backed National Salvation Front to challenge Gemayel's rule and the pact between Lebanon and [[Israel]] that was financially supported by the US.&lt;ref name=mil23jul&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Gemayel 'front' formed in Lebanon|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CW4aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=8ykEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5397,1565585&amp;dq=gemayel+family+in+lebanon&amp;hl=en|accessdate=23 March 2013|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=23 July 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later Syria tried to make Frangieh president for second term after the end of Amine Gemayel's term in 1988, but the National Assembly failed to achieve a [[quorum]] owing to a boycott by some Christian parliamentarians enforced by the [[Lebanese Forces]] militia.&lt;ref name=khazen04/&gt; In fact, Frangieh announced his candidacy on 17 August 1988.&lt;ref name=HijaziTimes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hijazi|first1=Ihsan A.|title=Syrian-Backed Ex-President To Seek Lebanon Post Again|work=The New York Times|page=10|date=17 August 1988|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/17/world/syrian-backed-ex-president-to-seek-lebanon-post-again.html|accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Suleiman Frangieh had five children with his Egypt-born wife, Iris Handaly: two sons, Tony and Robert, and three daughters, Lamia, Sonia and Maya.&lt;ref name=nyties92/&gt;

In June 1978, Suleiman Frangieh's son [[Tony Frangieh]], himself then a Member of Parliament, was killed together with his wife, Vera, three-year-old daughter, Jihane, and thirty other Marada partisans in [[Ehden massacre|the Ehden Massacre]].&lt;ref name=nisan12&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nisan|first=Mordechai|title=Of Wars and Woes.

He is known to have served with the [[Marada Brigade]] in the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Frangieh was called in Lebanon as "the tough man" due to his harsh tongue, volatile temper and ruthless approach to some of his opponents.&lt;ref name=nyties92/&gt; [[Robert Fisk]] describes Frangieh as a "Christian warlord, mafioso, militia strongman, grief- stricken father, corrupt president, mountain baron and, eventually, a thoughtful, intelligent, rather frightening old man, living out his last years beside the lions of Ehden."&lt;ref name=fisk92&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisk|first=Robert|title=Obituary: Suleiman Frangieh|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-suleiman-franjieh-1535126.html|accessdate=21 July 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=24 July 1002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Suleiman Frangieh died at age 82 in the hospital of the American University in Beirut, after three weeks of hospitalization, on 23 July 1992.&lt;ref name=tmnews/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyties92/&gt; He reportedly died of acute pneumonia and had heart and stomach ailments.&lt;ref name=nyties92/&gt; He was buried in Ehden next to his son Tony.&lt;ref name=nyties92/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3714">'''Tracy Jackson Putnam''' (April 14, 1894 – March 29, 1975) was the co-discoverer, together with [[H. Houston Merritt]], of [[Dilantin]] for controlling [[epilepsy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis P. Rowland, The Legacy of Tracy J. Putnam and H. Houston Merritt: Modern Neurology in the United States, Arch Neurol. 2009; 66(3):415.&lt;/ref&gt;

He graduated from Harvard College in 1915, and then from Harvard Medical School in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.societyns.org/society/bio.aspx?MemberID=2839|title=The Society of Neurological Surgeons|website=Societyns.org|accessdate=20 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829110230/http://www.societyns.org/society/bio.aspx?MemberID=2839|archive-date=2018-08-29|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for the Boston City Hospital and in the New York Neurological Institute at Columbia University. He was promoted to director after his work with [[phenytoin]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis P. Rowland, The Legacy of Tracy J. Putnam and H. Houston Merritt: Modern Neurology in the United States, N Engl J Med 2009; 360:941–942, February 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At his time there were quotas for Jewish physicians. He opposed the existence of the quotas. He was forced to resign from Columbia in 1947, maybe because of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/health/26quot.html|title=When Jewish Doctors Faced Quotas, a Pose in Defiance|first=Barron H.|last=Lerner|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=20 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127113821/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/26/health/26quot.html|archive-date=2018-01-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other sources mention a "personal tragedy" Putnam went through at that time (presumably the death of his daughter, Lucy Washburn Putnam, on September 24, 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alums.vassar.edu/connect/class/1940s/1948-9/index.html#cca-memoriam|title=1948/49 -     Office of Alumnae/i Affairs &amp; Development (OAAD) - Vassar College|website=Alums.vassar.edu|accessdate=20 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817174017/http://alums.vassar.edu/connect/class/1940s/1948-9/index.html#cca-memoriam|archive-date=2015-08-17|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), after which he resigned from Columbia and abandoned all scientific activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ilae.org/visitors/Documents/PutnamTJ1894-1975andHoustonMerritt1902-1979refere.pdf |title={title} |access-date=2013-08-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407062219/http://www.ilae.org/visitors/Documents/PutnamTJ1894-1975andHoustonMerritt1902-1979refere.pdf |archive-date=2014-04-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied [[multiple sclerosis]] together with [[Alexandra Adler]].&lt;ref&gt;Putnam T and Adler A: Vascular architecture of the lesions of multiple sclerosis. Arch Neurol Psychiat 1937; 38:1&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first persons to propose, as early as the 1930s, a vascular cause for [[multiple sclerosis]],&lt;ref&gt;Putnam T: Evidences of vascular occlusion in multiple sclerosis and encephalomyelitis. Arch Neurol Psychiatry 1937; 37(6):1298–1321.&lt;/ref&gt; resurrecting the previous works of [[Eduard von Rindfleisch]]. The idea remained obscure until the syndrome of [[chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency]] (CCSVI) was associated with multiple sclerosis in 2008.
