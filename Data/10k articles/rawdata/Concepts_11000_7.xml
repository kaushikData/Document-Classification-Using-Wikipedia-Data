To these descriptions, one can also add the Kantian notion of the wrongness of using another human being as means to an end rather than as ends in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychodynamic Perspectives on Abuse: The Cost of Fear|last=McCluskey|first=Una|last2=Hooper|first2=Carol-Ann|publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers|year=2000|isbn=1853026859|location=London|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources describe abuse as "socially constructed", which means there may be more or less recognition of the suffering of a victim at different times and societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Child Neglect and Emotional Abuse: Understanding, Assessment and Response|last=Doyle|first=Celia|last2=Timms|first2=Charles|publisher=SAGE|year=2014|isbn=9780857022301|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and contexts of abuse==

===Abuse of authority===

Abuse of authority, in the form of political corruption, is the use of legislated or otherwise authorised powers by government officials for illegitimate private gain. Misuse of government power for other purposes, such as [[Political repression|repression]] of political opponents and general [[police brutality]], is not considered political corruption. Neither are illegal acts by private persons or corporations not directly involved with the government. An illegal act by an officeholder constitutes political corruption only if the act is directly related to their official duties.

Abuse of authority is separated from [[abuse of power]] in that the act is originally condoned, but is extended beyond that initially conceived and is in not all cases

==={{Anchor|Ad hominem abuse}} Ad hominem abuse===
{{Main|Ad hominem abuse}}

===Adolescent abuse===
:''See: [[Anti-social behaviour]], [[Juvenile delinquency]], [[Parental abuse by adolescents]], [[Parental abuse of adolescents]]''

===Adult abuse===
Adult abuse refers to the abuse of [[Vulnerability|vulnerable]] adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/adultawstaff.pdf |format=PDF |title=Adult abuse |accessdate=5 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211200952/http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/adultawstaff.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alcohol abuse===
{{Main|Alcohol abuse}}
Alcohol abuse, as described in the [[DSM-IV]], is a psychiatric diagnosis describing the recurring use of [[alcoholic beverage]]s despite its negative consequences.&lt;ref name="pubs.niaaa"&gt;National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. [http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa30.htm "Diagnostic Criteria for Alcohol Abuse and Dependence"] ''Alcohol Alert,'' No. 30 PH 359, October 1995.&lt;!--Retrieved 17 August 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol abuse is sometimes referred to by the less specific term [[alcoholism]]. However, many definitions of alcoholism exist, and only some are compatible with alcohol abuse. There are two types of alcoholics: those who have anti social and pleasure-seeking tendencies, and those who are anxiety-ridden- people who are able to go without drinking for long periods of time but are unable to control themselves once they start.&lt;ref name="Neil R 2010, p.572"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Carlson, Neil R. |author2=Heth, C. Donald |title=Psychology: The Science of Behaviour |publisher=Pearson Canada Inc. |year=2010 |page=572}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Binge drinking]] is another form of alcohol abuse. Frequent binge drinking or getting severely drunk more than twice is classed as alcohol misuse.&lt;ref name="Michaud-2007"&gt;{{cite journal | date=February 2007 | first1=PA. | last1=Michaud | title=Alcohol misuse in adolescents – a challenge for general practitioners | journal=Ther Umsch | volume=64 | issue=2 | pages=121–6 | doi=10.1024/0040-5930.64.2.121 | pmid=17245680}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to research done through international surveys, the heaviest drinkers happen to be the United Kingdom's adolescent generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McArdle |first=Paul |title=Alcohol abuse in adolescents |journal=[[Archives of Disease in Childhood]] |date=27 February 2008 |volume=93 |issue=6| doi = 10.1136/adc.2007.115840 |pages=524–527 |pmid=18305075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal abuse===
{{Main|Cruelty to animals}}
{{See also|:Category:Cruelty to animals}}
Animal abuse is the infliction of [[suffering]] or [[harm]] upon animals, other than [[human]]s, for purposes other than self-defense. More narrowly, it can be harm for specific gain, such as killing animals for fur. Diverging viewpoints are held by jurisdictions throughout the world.

===Anti-social behavior===
{{Main|Anti-social behavior}}
{{See also|Incivility}}
Anti-social behavior is often seen as public [[behavior]] that lacks judgement and consideration for others and may damage them or their property. It may be intentional, as with [[vandalism]] or [[graffiti]], or the result of [[negligence]]. Persistent anti-social behavior may be a manifestation of an [[antisocial personality disorder]]. The counterpart of anti-social behavior is [[social behavior|pro-social behavior]], namely any behavior intended to help or benefit another person, group or society.&lt;ref&gt;

It typically involves subtle methods of [[coercion]] such as [[intimidation]]. Bullying can be defined in many different ways. Although the UK currently has no legal definition of bullying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://documents.manchester.ac.uk/display.aspx?DocID=2755 |title=The University of Manchester : Dignity at Work and Study Procedure for Students |publisher=Documents.manchester.ac.uk |accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; some US states have laws against it.

{{Main|Character assassination}}
Character assassination is an attempt to tarnish a person's [[reputation]].

{{Main|Child abuse}}
{{See also|Category:Child abuse|Child neglect}}
Child abuse is the physical or psychological/emotional mistreatment of children. In the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) define child maltreatment as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child.&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/CMP/CMP-Surveillance.htm |accessdate=20 October 2008 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |title=Child Maltreatment Surveillance: Uniform Definitions for Public Health and Recommended Data Elements |date=1 January 2008 |author1=Leeb, R.T. |author2=Paulozzi, L.J. |author3=Melanson, C. |author4=Simon, T.R. |author5=Arias, I. |lastauthoramp=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016225901/http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/dvp/CMP/CMP-Surveillance.htm |archivedate=16 October 2008 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most child abuse occurs in a child's home, with a smaller amount occurring in the organisations, schools or communities the child interacts with. There are four major categories of child abuse: [[neglect]], [[physical abuse]], [[psychological abuse|psychological/emotional abuse]], and [[sexual abuse]].

It has been noted that [[disabled]] people are disproportionately affected by disability abuse and [[bullying]], and such activity has been cited as a [[hate crime]].&lt;ref name=Quarmby&gt;{{cite book |last=Quarmby |first=Katharine |title=Scapegoat: Why we are failing disabled people |publisher=Portobello |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bullying is not limited to those who are visibly disabled – such as wheelchair-users or individuals with physical deformities (e.g., [[cleft lip]]) – but also those with [[learning disabilities]] such as [[autism]]&lt;ref name=Sainsbury&gt;{{cite book |last=Sainsbury |first=Clare |title=Martian in the Playground: Understanding the schoolchild with Asperger's syndrome |publisher=Paul Chapman Publishing |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Attwood&gt;{{cite book |last=Attwood |first=Tony |title=The Complete Guide to Asperger's Syndrome |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |year=2007 |pages=95–111}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[developmental coordination disorder]].&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;{{cite book |last=Kirby |first=Amanda |title=Dyspraxia: The Hidden Handicap |publisher=Souvenir Press |year=1999 |pages=106–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brookes&gt;{{cite book |last=Brookes |first=Geoff |title=Dyspraxia |publisher=Continuum 2005 |pages=43–46 |isbn=0826475817 |chapter=8: Dyspraxia in the Preschool and Nursery}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, this is linked to a poor ability in physical education, and this behaviour can be encouraged by an ignorant physical education teacher. Abuse of the disabled is not limited to schools; there are many known cases in which the disabled have been abused by staff of a "care institution", such as the case revealed in a [[BBC]] [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] programme on a Castlebeck care home ([[Winterbourne View]]) near [[Bristol, England|Bristol]], leading to its closure and suspension or firing of staff members.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news

===Discriminatory abuse===
{{Main|Discrimination|:Category:Discrimination| Template:Discrimination|Template:Discrimination sidebar|Prejudice|Religious discrimination}}
Discriminatory abuse involves picking on or treating someone unfairly because something about them is different; for example concerning:
{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|
* [[ageism|age]]
* clothing or appearance
* [[ethnic discrimination|ethnicity]], nationality or culture including traits like [[language]]
* [[Sexism|gender]], including gender-related traits (e.g., Pregnancy)
* health (such as HIV/AIDS) or [[disability]] (e.g., [[mental disorders]])
* [[language]] usage
* lifestyle or occupation
* [[racism|race]] or skin colour
* [[religious persecution|religion]] or political affiliation
* [[Homophobia|sexuality]] and [[sexual orientation]]
* social class or creed
* weight or height
}}

Discriminatory laws such as [[redlining]] have existed in many countries. In some countries, controversial attempts such as [[racial quota]]s have been used to redress negative effects of discrimination.

Other acts of discrimination include [[political libel]], [[defamation]] of groups and [[stereotype]]s based on [[exaggeration]]s.

Domestic abuse can be broadly defined as any form of abusive behaviours by one or both partners in an [[intimate relationship]], such as marriage, cohabitation, family, dating, or even friends. It is important to remember that abuse is always intentional, and can not happen by accident.
Domestic violence has many forms, including:
* physical aggression (hitting, kicking, biting, shoving, restraining, throwing objects), or threats thereof
* [[sexual abuse]]
* [[Psychological abuse|emotional abuse]]
* financial abuse (withholding money or controlling all money, including that of other family members)
* social abuse (restricting access to friends and/or family, insulting or threatening friends and/or family), controlling or domineering
* [[intimidation]]
* [[stalking]]

===Flag abuse===
{{Main|Flag desecration}}
Flag abuse (or flag desecration) is a term applied to various acts that intentionally destroy, damage or mutilate a flag in public, most often a national flag. Often, such action is intended to make a political point against a country or its policies. Some countries have laws forbidding methods of destruction (such as burning in public) or forbidding particular uses (such as for commercial purposes); such laws may distinguish between desecration of the country's own national flag and flags of other countries. Countries may have laws protecting the right to burn a flag as free speech.

In some cases criminal or [[anti-social behavior]] occurs when the person is under the influence of a drug, and long term personality changes in individuals may occur as well.&lt;ref name=Ksir&gt;{{cite book|last=Ksir|first=Oakley Ray; Charles|title=Drugs, society, and human behavior|year=2002|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=0072319631|edition=9th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFBHAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=antisocial}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to possible physical, social, and psychological harm, use of some drugs may also lead to criminal penalties, although these vary widely depending on the local jurisdiction.&lt;ref name="mosby"&gt;(2002).

===Surveillance abuse===
{{Main|Surveillance abuse}}
Surveillance abuse is the use of [[surveillance]] methods or technology to monitor the activity of an individual or group of individuals in a way which violates the [[social norm]]s or laws of a society. [[Mass surveillance]] by the state may constitute surveillance abuse if not appropriately regulated. Surveillance abuse often falls outside the scope of [[lawful interception]]. It is illegal because it violates peoples' [[right to privacy]].

===Taunting===
{{Main|Taunting}}
A taunt is a [[battle cry]], a method in hand-to-hand combat, sarcastic remark, or [[insult]] intended to demoralise the recipient, or to anger them and encourage reactionary behaviours without thinking. Taunting can exist as a form of social competition to gain control of the target's [[cultural capital]] (i.e. [[social status|status]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In [[sociological]] theory, the control of the three social capitals{{refn|Economic capital, cultural capital, and social capital, according to sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Forms of Capital|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/bourdieu-forms-capital.htm|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=11 March 2014|author =Pierre Bourdieu|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} is used to produce an advantage in the social hierarchy as to enforce one's own position in relation to others. Taunting is committed by either directly [[bullying]], or indirectly encouraging others to bully the target. It is also possible to give a response of the same kind, to ensure one's own status. It can be compared to [[fighting words]] and [[trash-talk]].

===Teasing===
{{Main|Teasing}}
Teasing is a word with many meanings. In human interactions, teasing comes in two major forms, ''playful'' and ''hurtful''. In mild cases, and especially when it is reciprocal, teasing can be viewed as playful and friendly.
However, teasing is often unwelcome and then it takes the form of [[harassment]]. In extreme cases, teasing may escalate to actual violence, and may even result in abuse. Children are commonly teased on such matters as their [[Human physical appearance|appearance]], weight, [[behaviour]], [[Skill|abilities]], and clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0146167200264009 | last1 = Kowalski | first1 = R. | year = 2000 | title = I was only kidding:Victim and perpetrators' perceptions of teasing | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 231–241 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This kind of teasing is often hurtful, even when the teaser believes he or she is being playful. One may also tease an animal. Some animals, such as dogs and cats, may recognise this as play; but in humans, teasing can become hurtful and take the form of [[bullying]] and abuse.

It is sometimes sponsored by state policies when a country is not able to prove itself militarily to another enemy country.

===Transgender abuse or trans bashing===
{{Main|Trans bashing}}
Trans bashing is the act of [[victimising]] a person physically, sexually, or verbally because they are [[transgender]] or [[Transsexualism|transsexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,20774504-5005961,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502173830/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0%2C21985%2C20774504-5005961%2C00.html |archivedate=2 May 2008 |date=17 November 2006 |author=Mariza O'Keefe |work=Herald Sun |title=Guilty plea over transsexual bashing |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike [[gay bashing]], it is committed because of the target's actual or perceived [[gender identity]], not [[sexual orientation]].

===Umpire abuse===
{{Main|Umpire abuse}}
Umpire abuse refers to the act of abuse towards a [[umpire]], referee, or other official in sport. The abuse can be [[verbal abuse]] (such as [[namecalling]]), or [[physical abuse]] (such as punching).

===Verbal abuse or verbal attacks===
{{Main|Verbal abuse}}
Verbal abuse is a form of abusive behaviour involving the use of [[language]]. It is a form of [[profanity]] that can occur with or without the use of [[Expletive attributive|expletives]]. While oral communication is the most common form of verbal abuse, it also includes abusive words in written form.

Verbal abuse is a pattern of behaviour that can seriously interfere with one's positive emotional development and can lead to significant detriment to one's [[self-esteem]], emotional [[Quality of life|well-being]], and physical state. It has been further described as an ongoing emotional environment organised by the abuser for the purposes of control.

===Whispering campaign===
{{Main|Whispering campaign}}
A whispering campaign is a method of [[persuasion]] in which damaging rumours or innuendo are spread about the target, while the source of the rumours seeks to avoid being detected while spreading them (for example, a political campaign might distribute anonymous flyers attacking the other candidate).

Workplace bullying, like [[childhood]] [[bullying]], is the tendency of individuals or groups to use persistent aggressive or unreasonable behaviour against a co-worker. Workplace bullying can include such tactics as [[verbal abuse|verbal]], [[nonverbal]], [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse]] and [[humiliation]]. This type of [[aggression]] is particularly difficult because unlike the typical forms of [[school bullying]], workplace bullies often operate within the established rules and policies of their organisation and their society.

== Abusive power and control ==
{{Main|Abusive power and control}}
{{See also|Coercive power}}
Abusive power and control (or controlling behaviour or coercive control) is the way that abusers gain and maintain [[Power (social and political)|power]] and control over a victim for an [[abusive]] purpose such as [[psychological abuse|psychological]], [[physical abuse|physical]], [[sexual abuse|sexual]], or [[financial abuse|financial]] abuse. The abuse can be for various reasons such as personal gain, personal [[gratification]], [[psychological projection]], [[Idealization and devaluation|devaluation]], [[envy]], or just for the sake of it as the abuser may simply enjoy exercising power and control.

Controlling abusers may use multiple tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The tactics themselves are psychologically and sometimes physically abusive. Control may be helped through [[Economic abuse#Controlling mechanism|economic abuse]] thus limiting the victim's actions as they may then lack the necessary resources to resist the abuse.&lt;ref name=wdachoices&gt;[http://wdachoices.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/WDAH_flipchart_money_wheel.pdf ''Economic abuse wheel''].

[[Psychological manipulation|Manipulators]] and abusers control their victims with a range of tactics, including [[positive reinforcement]] (such as [[praise]], [[superficial charm]], [[flattery]], [[ingratiation]], [[love bombing]], [[smiling]], [[gift]]s, attention), [[negative reinforcement]], intermittent or partial reinforcement, [[Punishment (psychology)|psychological punishment]] (such as [[nagging]], [[silent treatment]], [[profanity|swearing]], threats, [[intimidation]], [[emotional blackmail]], [[guilt trip]]s, inattention) and traumatic tactics (such as [[verbal abuse]] or [[explosive anger]]).&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ?

In their review of data from the [[Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study]] (a longitudinal birth cohort study; n = 941) Moffitt et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Moffitt, T.E. |author2=Caspi, A. |author3=Rutter, M. |author4=Silva, P.A. |year=2001 |title=Sex differences in antisocial behavior: Conduct Disorder, Delinquency, and Violence in the Dunedin Longitudinal Study |publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; report that while men exhibit more aggression overall, gender is not a reliable predictor of interpersonal aggression, including psychological aggression. The study found that whether male or female, aggressive people share a cluster of traits, including high rates of suspicion and jealousy; sudden and drastic mood swings; poor self-control; and higher than average rates of approval of violence and aggression (in American society, females are, on average, excused when violent against males). Moffitt et al. also argue that [[antisocial personality disorder|antisocial]] men exhibit two distinct types of interpersonal aggression (one against strangers, the other against intimate female partners), while antisocial women are rarely aggressive against anyone other than intimate male partners.

'''Advice''' (also called '''exhortation''') is a form of relating personal or institutional [[opinion]]s, [[belief systems]], values, recommendations or guidance about certain situations relayed in some context to another person, group or party often offered as a guide to action and/or conduct. Put a little more simply, an advice message is a recommendation about what might be thought, said, or otherwise done to address a problem, make a decision, or manage a situation.

==Kinds of advice==
Advice is believed to be theoretical, and is often considered [[taboo]] as well as helpful. The kinds of advice can range from systems of [[Education|instructional]] and practical toward more [[esoteric]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]], and is often attributable toward problem solving, strategy seeking, and solution finding, either from a social standpoint or a personal one. Advice may pertain to [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]], lifestyle changes, legal choices, business goals, personal goals, career goals, [[education]] goals, [[religious]] beliefs, personal growth, [[motivation]], inspiration and so on. Advice is not pertinent to any solid criteria, and may be given freely, or only given when asked upon. In some cultures advice is socially unacceptable to be released unless requested. In other cultures advice is given more openly. It may, especially if it is expert advice such as legal advice or methodological advice also be given only in exchange for payment.

Many expressions and quotations have been used to describe the status of advice, whether given, or received. One such expression is "Advice is what we ask for when we already know the answer but wish we didn't." ([[Erica Jong]], How to Save Your Own Life, 1977). Advice is like water, you drink it to replenish your soul. This particular quotation pertains the belief system that states that the answers to one's questions are within themselves, and do not come from any external stimuli. The accuracy of this particular belief is often disputed among theologians, philosophers, etc. However, a person who would hold such a belief, would "advise" another person to seek the answers out from within one's own esoteric and inner spiritual natures.

Advice when adhered to and followed may be beneficial, non-beneficial, damaging, non-damaging, partially beneficial and partially damaging, in reference to personal or social paradigms. In other words, not all advice is either "all good" or "all bad". Many people consider unrequested advice to be paternalistic and patronizing and are thus offended.

Therefore, some people may come to the conclusion that advice is morally better to be left out of the equation altogether, and this theory is included within the following quote (author unknown): "The best advice is this: Don't take advice and don't give advice." Yet, often in society advice has been helpful. A more day to day example would be "eat your vegetables" or "don't drink and drive." If this advice is adhered to we can see that the benefits would outweigh the consequences.

Grammatically speaking, advice is an uncountable noun, like rice or milk. Clicheing or using a cliche, refers to mainstream advice that is overused.&lt;ref&gt;Constant, David, Lee Sproull, and Sara Kiesler. "The kindness of strangers: The usefulness of electronic weak ties for technical advice." Organization science 7.2 (1996): 119-135.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advice-giving and advice-taking in the social sciences==

===Background information===

Advice-taking and advice-giving are of interest to researchers in the disciplines of [[psychology]], [[economics]], judgment and [[decision-making]], [[organizational behavior]] and [[human resources]], and [[human communication]], among others.&lt;ref name="organizational2006"&gt;Bonaccio, S., &amp; Dalal, R. S.  (2006). Advice taking and decision-making: An integrative literature review, and implications for the organizational sciences. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 101,'' 127-151.&lt;/ref&gt;

In psychology, seminal articles include Brehmer and Hagafors (1986), Hollenbeck et al. (1995), and Sniezek and Buckley (1995).&lt;ref&gt;Brehmer, B., &amp; Hagafors, R. (1986). The use of experts in complex decision-making: a paradigm for the study of staff work. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 38,'' 181–195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollenbeck, J. R., Ilgen, D. R., Sego, D. J., Hedlund, J., Major, D. A., &amp; Phillips, J. (1995). Multilevel theory of team decision making: decision performance in teams incorporating distributed expertise. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 80,'' 292–316.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sniezek, J. A., &amp; Buckley, T. (1995). Cueing and cognitive conflict in judge–advisor decision making. ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 62,'' 159–174.&lt;/ref&gt; The Sniezek and Buckley (1995) and Hollenbeck et al. (1995) articles, in particular, introduced researchers to standardized ways of studying advice in the [[laboratory]].&lt;ref name="organizational2006"/&gt; The psychological literature on advice-giving and advice-taking was [[Literature review|reviewed]] by Bonaccio and Dalal (2006), and a portion of this literature was also reviewed by Humphrey et al. (2002).&lt;ref name="organizational2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Humphrey, S. E., Hollenbeck, J. R., Meyer, C. J., &amp; Ilgen, D. R.(2002). Hierarchical team decision making. In G. R. Ferris &amp; J. J. Martocchio (Eds.). ''Research in personnel and human resources management'' (Vol. 21, pp. 175–213). Stamford, CT: JAI Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication researchers have tended to study advice as part of their research on supportive communication.&lt;ref&gt;Burleson, B. R., &amp; MacGeorge, E. L. (2002). Supportive communication. In M. L. Knapp &amp; J. A. Daly (Eds.), ''Handbook of interpersonal communication'' (3rd ed., pp. 374-424). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacGeorge, E. L., Feng, B., &amp; Thompson, E. R. (2008). "Good" and "bad" advice: How to advise more effectively. In M. T. Motley (Ed.), ''Studies in applied interpersonal communication'' (pp. 145-164). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Much research has focused on [[Sex differences in humans|gender differences]] (and similarities) in the provision and receipt of supportive communication.&lt;ref&gt;MacGeorge, E. L., Graves, A. R., Feng, B., Gillihan, S. J., &amp; Burleson, B. R. (2004). The myth of gender cultures: Similarities outweigh differences in men’s and women’s provision of and responses to supportive communication. ''Sex Roles, 50,'' 144-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In economics, the willingness of entrepreneurs to take advice from early investors and other partners (i.e., entrepreneurial ''coachability'') has long been considered a critical factor in entrepreneurial success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timmons|first=Jeffry A.|last2=Bygrave|first2=William D.|date=1986-03-01|title=Venture capital's role in financing innovation for economic growth|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0883902686900121|journal=Journal of Business Venturing|volume=1|issue=2|pages=161–176|doi=10.1016/0883-9026(86)90012-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, some economists have argued that entrepreneurs should not simply act on all advice given to them, even when that advice comes from well-informed sources, because the entrepreneurs themselves possess far deeper and richer local knowledge about their own firm than any outsider. Indeed, measures of advice-taking are ''not'' actually predictive of subsequent entrepreneurial success (e.g., measured as success in subsequent funding rounds, acquisitions, pivots, and firm survival).

===Social science definitions of "advice"===

In the social sciences in general, and in psychological research in particular, advice has typically been defined as a recommendation to do something.&lt;ref name="organizational2006"/&gt; For example, in response to a client's question regarding whether to invest in stocks, bonds, or T-notes, a financial planner (the advisor) might say: "I recommend going with bonds at this time." However, Dalal and Bonaccio (2010) have argued, based on a review of the research literature, that such a definition is incomplete and leaves out several important types of advice&lt;ref name="organizational1"&gt;Dalal, R. S., &amp; Bonaccio, S. (2010). What types of advice do decision-makers prefer? ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 112,'' 11-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sapients.net/article/howtogiveafriendadvice/ |title=Difficult Times – How to give a friend Advice |publisher=Sapients.net |date=2011-07-25 |accessdate=2012-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321200947/http://www.sapients.net/article/howtogiveafriendadvice/ |archivedate=2012-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors have provided the following taxonomy of advice:
* Recommending a particular course of action (this is the usual form of advice that is studied)
* Recommending ''against'' a particular course of action
* Providing additional information about a particular course of action without explicitly prescribing or proscribing that course of action
* Recommending ''how'' to go about making the decision (here, too, no courses of action are explicitly prescribed or proscribed)
Of these four types of advice (and [[Social support|socio-emotional support]], which is a related form of interpersonal assistance that often accompanies advice), Dalal and Bonaccio (2010) found that decision-makers reacted most favorably to the provision of information, because this form of advice not only increased decision [[accuracy]] but also allowed the decision-maker to maintain [[autonomy]].&lt;ref name="organizational1"/&gt;

==Methodological advice==

Methodological advice concerns expert advice on [[research methodology]]. This kind of advice is, as opposed to some forms of advising mentioned above, usually initiated by the person who receives the advice, thus not unrequested. The goal of the advisor (see [[statistical consultant]]) is to guarantee the quality of research undertaken by his client, a [[researcher]], by providing sound methodological advice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Adèr, H. J.]], [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|Mellenbergh G. J.]], &amp; Hand, D. J. (2008). ''Advising on research methods: A consultants companion.'' Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The advice may take different forms. In some cases the advisor collaborates with a researcher in a more long-term process, and guides him through the more technical parts of the research (this type of advising is called longitudinal consultancy). In complex, longterm projects it is not uncommon for the advisor to help by doing part of the work him or herself (interactive consultancy). In other cases a researcher may have a specific question that can be answered in a brief conversation with a consultant (cross-sectional consultancy, or advisory consulting).&lt;ref&gt;Van Belle, G. (2008). ''Statistical rules of thumb (2nd ed.).'' New York: Wiley: Chapter 10 (pp. 217-235).&lt;/ref&gt; The advisors role can also take a didactic form, when the client is not familiar with suggested (statistical) methods. Sometimes the best advice is not statistically ideal, but is comprehensible for the client.

Depending on the function of the methodological advisor, the advice that is given may not be free. If a student conducts research commissioned by a professor, this professor will probably help this student for free, if needed. However, if a researcher contacts an independent advisor, this probably costs him/her. In this case the methodological advisor is basically being hired by the researcher. In other cases the advisor may be incorporated into research team, leading to co-authorship. It is advisable to make clear agreements about the advisors compensation on fore hand.

Researchers may seek advice on a wide range of subjects concerning their research. One of the major tasks of the methodological advisor is to help his clients think about what they really want to accomplish. This may involve helping them to (re)formulate the [[research question]] and relatedly, the research hypothesis (see [[scientific hypothesis]]). Clients may also seek advice on the construction of a measurement instrument (for instance a [[psychological test]]). Or, they may want to know how to implement an appropriate [[research design]]. Often questions arise on how to analyze the data (see [[data analysis]]), and how to interpret and report the results (see [[scientific publishing]]).

A researcher will usually know more about the field in which the study is conducted than the methodological advisor. The advisor on the other hand will know more about the method. By combining their expertise and, through dialog and cooperation, researcher and consultant may achieve better, more reliable results.&lt;ref&gt;Derr, J. (2008). Having an impact in a multi-disciplinary setting. In [[H. J. Adèr]] &amp; [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|G. J. Mellenbergh]] (Eds.), ''Proceedings of the 2007 KNAW colloquium Advising on research methods'': pp. 11-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21001">{{Algebraic structures}}

In [[mathematics]], and more specifically in [[abstract algebra]], an '''algebraic structure''' on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' (called '''carrier set''' or '''underlying set''') is a collection of [[finitary]] [[operation (mathematics)|operation]]s on ''A''; the set ''A'' with this [[Structure (mathematical logic)|structure]] is also called an '''algebra'''.&lt;ref&gt;P.M. Cohn. (1981) ''Universal Algebra'', Springer, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of algebraic structures include [[group (mathematics)|groups]], [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[field (mathematics)|fields]], and [[lattice (order)|lattices]]. More complex structures can be defined by introducing multiple operations, different underlying sets, or by altering the defining axioms. Examples of more complex algebraic structures include [[vector space]]s, [[Module (mathematics)|modules]], and [[Algebra (ring theory)|algebras]].

The properties of specific algebraic structures are studied in abstract algebra.  The general theory of algebraic structures has been formalized in [[universal algebra]]. The language of [[category theory]] is used to express and study relationships between different classes of algebraic and non-algebraic objects. This is because it is sometimes possible to find strong connections between some classes of objects, sometimes of different kinds. For example, [[Galois theory]] establishes a connection between certain fields and groups: two algebraic structures of different kinds.

== Introduction ==

Addition and multiplication on numbers are the prototypical example of an operation that combines two elements of a set to produce a third. These operations obey several algebraic laws. For example, ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' and ''a''(''bc'') = (''ab'')''c'', both examples of the ''associative law''. Also ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'', and ''ab'' = ''ba'', the ''commutative law.'' Many systems studied by mathematicians have operations that obey some, but not necessarily all, of the laws of ordinary arithmetic. For example, rotations of objects in three-dimensional space can be combined by performing the first rotation and then applying the second rotation to the object in its new orientation. This operation on rotations obeys the associative law, but can fail the commutative law.

Mathematicians give names to sets with one or more operations that obey a particular collection of laws, and study them in the abstract as algebraic structures. When a new problem can be shown to follow the laws of one of these algebraic structures, all the work that has been done on that category in the past can be applied to the new problem.

In full generality, algebraic structures may involve an arbitrary number of sets and operations that can combine more than two elements (higher [[arity]]), but this article focuses on binary operations on one or two sets. The examples here are by no means a complete list, but they are meant to be a representative list and include the most common structures. Longer lists of algebraic structures may be found in the external links and within ''[[:Category:Algebraic structures]].'' Structures are listed in approximate order of increasing complexity.

== Examples ==

=== One set with operations ===

'''Simple structures''': '''no''' [[binary operation]]:

* [[Set (mathematics)|Set]]: a degenerate algebraic structure ''S''   having no operations.
* [[Pointed set]]: ''S'' has one or more distinguished elements, often 0, 1, or both.
* {{anchor|unary system}}Unary system: ''S'' and a single [[unary operation]] over ''S''.
* {{vanchor|Pointed unary system}}: a unary system with ''S'' a pointed set.

'''Group-like structures''': '''one''' binary operation. The binary operation can be indicated by any symbol, or with no symbol (juxtaposition) as is done for ordinary multiplication of real numbers.

* [[Magma (algebra)|Magma or groupoid]]: ''S'' and a single binary operation over ''S''.
* [[Semigroup]]: an [[associative]] magma.
* [[Monoid]]: a semigroup with [[Identity element|identity]].
* [[Group (mathematics)|Group]]: a monoid with a unary operation (inverse), giving rise to [[inverse element]]s.
* [[Abelian group]]: a group whose binary operation is [[commutative]].
* [[Semilattice]]: a semigroup whose operation is [[idempotence|idempotent]] and commutative. The binary operation can be called either [[meet (mathematics)|meet]] or [[join (mathematics)|join]].
* [[Quasigroup]]: a magma obeying the [[latin square property]]. A quasigroup may also be represented using three binary operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | accessdate = 2012-08-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Loop (mathematics)|Loop]]: a quasigroup with [[Identity element|identity]].

'''Ring-like structures''' or '''Ringoids''': '''two''' binary operations, often called [[addition]] and [[multiplication]], with multiplication [[distributivity|distributing]] over addition.

* [[Semiring]]: a ringoid such that ''S'' is a monoid under each operation. Addition is typically assumed to be commutative and associative, and the monoid product is assumed to distribute over the addition on both sides, and the additive identity satisfies 0&amp;#8239;''x'' = 0 for all ''x''.
* [[Near-ring]]: a semiring whose additive monoid is a (not necessarily abelian) group.
* [[Ring (mathematics)|Ring]]: a semiring whose additive monoid is an abelian group.
* [[Lie ring]]: a ringoid whose additive monoid is an abelian group, but whose multiplicative operation satisfies the [[Jacobi identity]] rather than associativity.
* [[Boolean ring]]: a commutative ring with idempotent multiplication operation.
* [[field (mathematics)|Field]]: a commutative ring which contains a multiplicative inverse for every nonzero element
* [[Kleene algebra]]s: a semiring with idempotent addition and a unary operation, the [[Kleene star]], satisfying additional properties.
* [[*-algebra]]: a ring with an additional unary operation (*) satisfying additional properties.

'''Lattice structures''': '''two''' or more binary operations, including operations called [[meet and join]], connected by the [[absorption law]].&lt;ref&gt;Ringoids and [[Lattice (order)|lattice]]s can be clearly distinguished despite both having two defining binary operations. In the case of ringoids, the two operations are linked by the [[distributive law]]; in the case of lattices, they are linked by the [[absorption law]]. Ringoids also tend to have numerical [[model theory|model]]s, while lattices tend to have [[set theory|set-theoretic]] models.
&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Complete lattice]]: a lattice in which arbitrary [[meet and join]]s exist.
* [[Bounded lattice]]: a lattice with a [[greatest element]] and least element.
* [[Complemented lattice]]: a bounded lattice with a unary operation, complementation, denoted by [[reverse Polish notation|postfix]] &lt;sup&gt;[[⊥]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;!-- or [[prefix notation|prefix]] [[¬]] --&gt;. The join of an element with its complement is the greatest element, and the meet of the two elements is the least element.
* [[Modular lattice]]: a lattice whose elements satisfy the additional ''modular identity''.
* [[Distributive lattice]]: a lattice in which each of meet and join [[distributive lattice|distributes]] over the other. Distributive lattices are modular, but the converse does not hold.
* [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]: a complemented distributive lattice. Either of meet or join can be defined in terms of the other and complementation. This can be shown to be equivalent with the ring-like structure of the same name above.
* [[Heyting algebra]]: a bounded distributive lattice with an added binary operation, [[relative pseudo-complement]], denoted by [[infix]] →, and governed by the axioms ''x''&amp;#8239;→&amp;#8239;''x'' = 1, ''x''&amp;#8239;(''x''&amp;#8239;→&amp;#8239;''y'') = ''x&amp;#8239;y'', ''y''&amp;#8239;(''x''&amp;#8239;→&amp;#8239;''y'') = ''y'', ''x''&amp;#8239;→&amp;#8239;(''y&amp;#8239;z'') = (''x''&amp;#8239;→&amp;#8239;''y'')&amp;#8239;(''x''&amp;#8239;→&amp;#8239;''z'').

'''Arithmetics''': '''two''' [[binary operation]]s, addition and multiplication. ''S'' is an [[infinite set]]. Arithmetics are pointed unary systems, whose [[unary operation]] is [[injective]] [[successor function|successor]], and with distinguished element 0.

* [[Robinson arithmetic]]. Addition and multiplication are [[Recursion|recursively]] defined by means of successor. 0 is the identity element for addition, and annihilates multiplication. Robinson arithmetic is listed here even though it is a variety, because of its closeness to Peano arithmetic.
* [[Peano arithmetic]]. Robinson arithmetic with an [[axiom schema]] of [[mathematical induction|induction]]. Most ring and field axioms bearing on the properties of addition and multiplication are theorems of Peano arithmetic or of proper extensions thereof.

=== Two sets with operations ===

'''[[module (mathematics)|Module]]-like structures:''' composite systems involving two sets and employing at least two binary operations.

* [[Group with operators]]: a group ''G'' with a set Ω and a binary operation Ω&amp;#8239;×&amp;#8239;''G'' → ''G'' satisfying certain axioms.
* [[module (mathematics)|Module]]: an abelian group ''M'' and a ring ''R'' acting as operators on ''M''. The members of ''R'' are sometimes called [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s, and the binary operation of ''scalar multiplication'' is a function ''R''&amp;#8239;×&amp;#8239;''M'' → ''M'', which satisfies several axioms. Counting the ring operations these systems have at least three operations.
* [[Vector space]]: a module where the ring ''R'' is a [[division ring]] or [[field (mathematics)|field]].
* [[Graded vector space]]: a vector space with a [[Direct sum of modules|direct sum]] decomposition breaking the space into "grades".
* [[Quadratic space]]: a vector space ''V'' over a field ''F'' with a function from ''V'' into ''F'' satisfying certain properties. Every quadratic space is also an inner product space (see below).

'''[[algebra (ring theory)|Algebra]]-like structures''': composite system defined over two sets, a ring ''R'' and a ''R'' module ''M'' equipped with an operation called multiplication. This can be viewed as a system with five binary operations: two operations on ''R'', two on ''M'' and one involving both ''R'' and ''M''.

* [[Algebra over a ring]] (also ''R-algebra''): a module over a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', which also carries a multiplication operation that is compatible with the module structure. This includes distributivity over addition and [[Bilinear map|linearity]] with respect to multiplication by elements of ''R''. The theory of an [[algebra over a field]] is especially well developed.
* [[Associative algebra]]: an algebra over a ring such that the multiplication is [[associative property|associative]].
* [[Nonassociative algebra]]: a module over a commutative ring, equipped with a ring multiplication operation that is not necessarily associative. Often associativity is replaced with a different identity, such as [[alternative algebra|alternation]], the [[Jacobi identity]], or the [[Jordan identity]].
* [[Coalgebra]]: a vector space with a "comultiplication" defined dually to that of associative algebras.
* [[Lie algebra]]: a special type of nonassociative algebra whose product satisfies the [[Jacobi identity]].
* [[Lie coalgebra]]: a vector space with a "comultiplication" defined dually to that of Lie algebras.
* [[Graded algebra]]: a graded vector space with an algebra structure compatible with the grading. The idea is that if the grades of two elements ''a'' and ''b'' are known, then the grade of ''ab'' is known, and so the location of the product ''ab'' is determined in the decomposition.
* [[Inner product space]]: an ''F'' vector space ''V'' with a sesquilinear binary operation {{nowrap|''V'' × ''V'' → ''F''}}.

'''Four''' or more binary operations:

* [[Bialgebra]]: an associative algebra with a compatible coalgebra structure.
* [[Lie bialgebra]]: a Lie algebra with a compatible bialgebra structure.
* [[Hopf algebra]]: a bialgebra with a connection axiom (antipode).
* [[Clifford algebra]]: a graded associative algebra equipped with an [[exterior product]] from which may be derived several possible inner products.  [[Exterior algebra]]s and [[geometric algebra]]s are special cases of this construction.

== Hybrid structures ==

Algebraic structures can also coexist with added structure of non-algebraic nature, such as [[Partially ordered set#Formal definition|partial order]] or a [[topology]]. The added structure must be compatible, in some sense, with the algebraic structure.

* [[Topological group]]: a group with a topology compatible with the group operation.
* [[Lie group]]: a topological group with a compatible smooth [[manifold]] structure.
* [[Ordered group]]s, [[ordered ring]]s and [[ordered field]]s: each type of structure with a compatible [[partial order]].
* [[Archimedean group]]: a linearly ordered group for which the [[Archimedean property]] holds.
* [[Topological vector space]]: a vector space whose ''M'' has a compatible topology.
* [[Normed vector space]]: a vector space with a compatible [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]. If such a space is [[complete metric space|complete]] (as a metric space) then it is called a [[Banach space]].
* [[Hilbert space]]: an inner product space over the real or complex numbers whose inner product gives rise to a Banach space structure.
* [[Vertex operator algebra]]
* [[Von Neumann algebra]]: a *-algebra of operators on a Hilbert space equipped with the [[weak operator topology]].

== Universal algebra ==
{{main | Universal algebra}}
Algebraic structures are defined through different configurations of [[axiom]]s. [[Universal algebra]] abstractly studies such objects. One major dichotomy is between structures that are axiomatized entirely by ''identities'' and structures that are not. If all axioms defining a class of algebras are identities, then the class of objects is a [[variety (universal algebra)|variety]] (not to be confused with [[algebraic variety]] in the sense of [[algebraic geometry]]).

Identities are equations formulated using only the operations the structure allows, and variables that are tacitly [[universal quantifier|universally quantified]] over the relevant [[universe (mathematics)|universe]]. Identities contain no [[Logical connective|connectives]], [[Quantification (science)|existentially quantified variables]], or [[finitary relation|relations]] of any kind other than the allowed operations. The study of varieties is an important part of [[universal algebra]]. An algebraic structure in a variety may be understood as the [[quotient algebra]] of term algebra (also called "absolutely  [[free object|free algebra]]") divided by the equivalence relations generated by a set of identities.  So, a collection of functions with given [[signature (logic)|signatures]] generate a free algebra, the [[term algebra]] ''T''. Given a set of equational identities (the axioms), one may consider their symmetric, transitive closure ''E''.  The [[quotient algebra]] ''T''/''E'' is then the algebraic structure or variety.  Thus, for example, groups have a signature containing two operators: the multiplication operator ''m'', taking two arguments, and the inverse operator ''i'', taking one argument, and the identity element ''e'', a constant, which may be considered an operator that takes zero arguments.  Given a (countable) set of variables ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', etc. the term algebra is the collection of all possible [[term (mathematics)|terms]] involving ''m'', ''i'', ''e'' and the variables; so for example, ''m(i(x), m(x,m(y,e)))'' would be an element of the term algebra. One of the axioms defining a group is the identity ''m(x, i(x)) = e''; another is ''m(x,e) = x''. The axioms can be represented as [http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/variety+of+algebras#examples_4 trees]. These equations induce [[equivalence class]]es on the free algebra; the quotient algebra then has the algebraic structure of a group.

Several non-variety structures fail to be varieties, because either:

# It is necessary that 0&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;1, 0 being the additive [[identity element]] and 1 being a multiplicative identity element, but this is a nonidentity;
# Structures such as fields have some axioms that hold only for nonzero members of ''S''. For an algebraic structure to be a variety, its operations must be defined for ''all'' members of ''S''; there can be no partial operations.

Structures whose axioms unavoidably include nonidentities are among the most important ones in mathematics, e.g., [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s and [[division ring]]s. Although structures with nonidentities retain an undoubted algebraic flavor, they suffer from defects varieties do not have. For example, the product of two [[field (mathematics)|field]]s is not a field.

== Category theory ==

[[Category theory]] is another tool for studying algebraic structures (see, for example, Mac Lane 1998). A category is a collection of ''objects'' with associated ''morphisms.'' Every algebraic structure has its own notion of [[homomorphism]], namely any [[function (mathematics)|function]] compatible with the operation(s) defining the structure. In this way, every algebraic structure gives rise to a [[category theory|category]]. For example, the [[category of groups]] has all [[Group (mathematics)|groups]] as objects and all [[group homomorphism]]s as morphisms. This [[concrete category]] may be seen as a [[category of sets]] with added category-theoretic [[structure (category theory)|structure]]. Likewise, the category of [[topological group]]s (whose morphisms are the continuous group homomorphisms) is a [[category of topological spaces]] with extra structure. A [[forgetful functor]] between categories of algebraic structures "forgets" a part of a structure.

There are various concepts in category theory that try to capture the algebraic character of a context, for instance

* [[algebraic category]]
* [[essentially algebraic category]]
* [[presentable category]]
* [[locally presentable category]]
* [[Monad (category theory)|monadic]] functors and categories
* [[universal property]].

== Different meanings of "structure" ==

In a slight [[abuse of notation]], the word "structure" can also refer to just the operations on a structure, instead of the underlying set itself. For example, the sentence, "We have defined a ring ''structure'' on the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;," means that we have defined [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''operations'' on the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. For another example, the group &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb Z, +)&lt;/math&gt; can be seen as a set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb Z&lt;/math&gt; that is equipped with an ''algebraic structure,'' namely the ''operation'' &lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''argument from free will''', also called the '''paradox of free will''' or '''[[Theological determinism|theological fatalism]]''', contends that [[omniscience]] and [[free will]] are [[Incompatible-properties argument|incompatible]] and that any conception of [[God]] that incorporates both properties is therefore inherently [[Contradiction|contradictory]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;See the various [[Omniscience#Controversies|controversies]] over claims of God's omniscience, in particular the critical notion of [[predestination|foreknowledge]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/free-will-foreknowledge/ Foreknowledge and Free Will]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="iep"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/foreknow|title=Foreknowledge and Free Will|last=Swartz|first=Norman|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

==Omniscience and free will==
[[File:Chess-king.JPG|thumb|right|150px|If God made the game, its rules, and the players, then how can any player be free?]]
Some arguments against the [[existence of God]] focus on the supposed incoherence of humankind possessing [[free will]] and God's [[omniscience]]. These arguments are deeply concerned with the implications of [[predestination]].

[[Moses Maimonides]] formulated an argument regarding a person's free will, in traditional terms of good and evil actions, as follows:

{{quote|… "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that the man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand how he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…"&lt;ref name=maimonides&gt;''The Eight Chapters of Maimonides on Ethics (Semonah Perakhim)'', edited, annotated, and translated with an Introduction by Joseph I. Gorfinkle, pp. 99–100. (New York: AMS Press), 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A logical formulation of this argument might go as follows:&lt;ref name=stanford /&gt;
# God knows choice "C" that a human would claim to "make freely".
# It is now necessary that C.
# If it is now necessary that C, then C cannot be otherwise (this is the definition of “necessary”). That is, there are no actual "possibilities" due to predestination.
# If you cannot do otherwise when you act, you do not act freely (Principle of Alternate Possibilities)
# Therefore, when you do an act, you will not do it freely.

[[Norman Swartz]], however, contends that the above arguments commit the [[modal fallacy]]. In particular, he asserts that these arguments assume that if C is true, it becomes necessary for C to be true, which is incorrect as C is contingent (see [[Modal logic | modal logic]]). Otherwise, one can argue that the future is set already regardless of his actions.&lt;ref name=iep /&gt;

Other means of reconciling God's omniscience with human free will have been proposed. Some have attempted to redefine or reconceptualize free will:
* God can know in advance what I will do, because free will is to be understood only as freedom from [[coercion]], and anything further is an illusion. This is the move made by [[Compatibilism|compatibilistic]] philosophies.
* The sovereignty (autonomy) of God, existing within a free agent, provides strong inner compulsions toward a course of action (calling), and the power of choice (election). The actions of a human are thus determined by a human acting on relatively strong or weak urges (both from God and the environment around them) and their own relative power to choose.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philosopher's Handbook'', Stanley Rosen, ed., Random House Reference, New York, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

A proposition first offered by [[Boethius]]&lt;ref&gt;''Consolatio Philosophiae'', Boethius, book 5:4&lt;/ref&gt; and later by [[Thomas Aquinas]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also ''[[Divine Providence]]'' versus the concept of [[Destiny|Fate]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[C. S. Lewis]], suggests that God's perception of time is different, and that this is relevant to our understanding of our own free will. In his book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'', Lewis argues that God is actually outside time and therefore does not "foresee" events, but rather simply observes them all at once. He explains:
{{quote|But suppose God is outside and above the Time-line. In that case, what we call "tomorrow" is visible to Him in just the same way as what we call "today". All the days are "Now" for Him. He does not remember you doing things yesterday, He simply sees you doing them: because, though you have lost yesterday, He has not. He does not "foresee" you doing things tomorrow, He simply sees you doing them: because, though tomorrow is not yet there for you, it is for Him. You never supposed that your actions at this moment were any less free because God knows what you are doing. Well, He knows your tomorrow's actions in just the same way—because He is already in tomorrow and can simply watch you. In a sense, He does not know your action till you have done it: but then the moment at which you have done it is already "Now" for Him.&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis ''Mere Christianity'' Touchstone:New York, 1980 p.149&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A common objection is to argue that [[Molinism]], or the belief that God can know counterfactually the actions of his creations, is true. This has been used as an argument by [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[William Lane Craig]], amongst others.

==Freewill argument for the nonexistence of God==
[[Dan Barker]] suggests that this can lead to a "Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God"&lt;ref&gt;''The Freewill Argument for the Nonexistence of God'' by Dan Barker, [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] [https://ffrf.org/legacy/about/bybarker/fang.php]&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds that God's omniscience is incompatible with God having free will and that if God does not have freewill God is not a [[personal God|personal being]].

Theists generally agree that God is a personal being and that God is [[omniscience|omniscient]],&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[Richard Swinburne]] ''Does God Exist?'' of ''The Catechism of the Catholic Church''&lt;/ref&gt; but there is some disagreement about whether "omniscient" means:
# "knows everything that God chooses to know and that is logically possible to know"; Or instead the slightly stronger:
# "knows everything that is logically possible to know"&lt;ref group=note&gt;see e.g. [[John Polkinghorne]]&lt;/ref&gt;

These two terms are known as ''inherent'' and ''total'' omniscience, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2899">As a novel type of semi-discrete [[dynamical systems]], '''Boolean delay equations (BDEs)''' are models with Boolean-valued variables that evolve in continuous time.  Since at the present time, most phenomena are too complex to be modeled by [[partial differential equations]] (as continuous infinite-dimensional systems), BDEs are intended as a ([[heuristic]]) first step on the challenging road to further understanding and [[scientific model|modeling]] them.  For instance, one can mention complex problems in [[fluid dynamics]], [[climate]] dynamics, solid-earth [[geophysics]], and many problems elsewhere in [[natural sciences]] where much of the discourse is still [[wikt:conceptual|conceptual]].

==Hopes and promises==
Although in recent centuries, [[differential equation]]s (both ordinary and partial) have extensively served as [[quantitative property|quantitative]] models of vast categories of problems, by the recent greedy and rapid burst of complexities everywhere, the gap between [[quantitative property|quantitative]] and [[qualitative property|qualitative]] modeling and [[reasoning]] techniques is widening.  BDEs offer a formal [[mathematical]] language that is promising to help bridge that gap.

In [[mathematics]], '''Chebyshev's sum inequality''', named after [[Pafnuty Chebyshev]], states that if

and

H.|last2=Littlewood|first2=J. E.|last3=Pólya|first3=G.|title=Inequalities|series=Cambridge Mathematical Library|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1988|isbn=0-521-35880-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof==
Consider the sum

:&lt;math&gt; S = \sum_{j=1}^n \sum_{k=1}^n (a_j - a_k) (b_j - b_k).&lt;/math&gt;

The two sequences are non-increasing, therefore {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''b''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;}} have the same sign for any {{math|''j'',&amp;nbsp;''k''}}. Hence {{math|''S''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ge;&amp;nbsp;0}}.

Opening the brackets, we deduce:

:&lt;math&gt; 0 \leq 2 n \sum_{j=1}^n a_j b_j - 2 \sum_{j=1}^n a_j \, \sum_{k=1}^n b_k,&lt;/math&gt;

whence

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j b_j \geq \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{j=1}^n a_j\right) \, \left(\frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^n b_k\right).&lt;/math&gt;

An alternative proof is simply obtained with the [[rearrangement inequality]], writing that
:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} b_j = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} a_i b_j =\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}  a_i b_{i+k~\text{mod}~n} = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i b_{i+k~\text{mod}~n}
\leq \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_ib_i = n \sum_i a_ib_i.&lt;/math&gt;

==Continuous version==
There is also a continuous version of Chebyshev's sum inequality:

If ''f'' and ''g'' are real-valued, integrable functions over [0,1], both non-increasing or both non-decreasing, then

:&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 f(x)g(x) \, dx \geq \int_0^1 f(x) \, dx \int_0^1 g(x) \, dx, &lt;/math&gt;

with the inequality reversed if one is non-increasing and the other is non-decreasing.

'''Cheonmin''', or "vulgar commoners," were the lowest caste of commoners in dynastical Korea. They abounded during the [[Goryeo]] (918–1392) and [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] (1392–1897) periods of Korea's agrarian bureaucracy.

==Social class system==
Like the [[caste system in India]], this social class was largely hereditary and based on certain professions considered "unclean" by the upper classes. This list of unclean professions included butchers, [[Shamanism#Korea|shamans]], shoemakers, metalworkers, prostitutes, magicians, sorcerers, jail-keepers, and performers (like the ''kisaeng'').  [[Nobi]] (slaves), were servants taken from the cheonmin class to serve [[yangban]] (aristocracy) and royalty, but like slaves, they were considered the property of their owners and could be given away to other high-ranking people.

[[Kisaeng]], female entertainers for yangban, were in this class, educated but not respected by others in society. The hereditary nature of the caste system bred institutionalized discrimination and prejudice early on in Korea's history, as the cheonmin were barred from most forms of social advancement, including entry into government service or taking the [[gwageo]] civil service examinations.

The cheonmin, although a step above the traditional caste of untouchables or outcasts called the [[Baekjeong]], lived segregated lives, like the baekjeong, isolated from the rest of society and shunted away in ghettoes far away from the rest of society.  While the cheonmin performed tasks that other Koreans considered unclean or undignified, they still had an essential function and role within dynastical Korean society.  Their work as butchers, shoemakers, low-class entertainers, performing unclean jobs, provided services to the other classes that were unavailable from anyone else.

==Legacy==
While the class and caste system of dynastical Korea no longer exists and has largely disappeared in the modern era, remnants of such social discrimination based solely on one's occupation or a forebearer's previous line of work continue to shape traditional Korean thinking and values today.

==Exception==
In all the history of the Joseon Dynasty there are only a few extraordinary examples of a cheonmin who overcame their class status.

'''Choi Suk Bin''' gained the highest rank, just under the Queen, and became a Royal [[concubine]]. Choi Suk Bin, mother of [[King Yeongjo]], who originally entered the Palace as a ''musori'' or slave-girl.  Due to his mother's low origins, Yeongjo suffered multiple attempts to his life when he was named Crown prince over his half brother. Although he was adopted by [[Queen Inwon]] and under her protection, many nobles were against a low-born son ruling the country as king.

'''[[Jang Geum]]''' (fl. early 16th century; [[Korean name#Family names|family name]] Seo), originally an [[Uinyeo]] of the cheonmin class, became the first female Royal Physician in [[Korean history]]. 
According to the ''[[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]]'' [[Jungjong of Joseon|King Jungjong]] recognized Jang Geum's medical knowledge and entrusted her the royal care of all royal family members. [[King Jungjung]] therefore, promoted Jang Geum to become the third highest-ranking officer in the Court, and was granted the use of ''Dae ''({{Ko-hhrm|대|大|Dae|Tae}}) (which means "great" in Korean) before her first name.

== Terminology == &lt;!-- Courtesy note per [[WP:RSECT]]: [[Pullet]] links here. Maybe others too. --&gt;
[[File:Chicken anatomy.jpg|thumb|[[Educational toy|Didactic model]] of a chicken.]]
In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as ''[[cock (bird)|cock]]s'', whereas in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called ''[[rooster]]s''. Males less than a year old are ''[[cockerels]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cockerel |title=Cockerel – definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[castration|Castrated]] roosters are called ''[[capon]]s'' (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world). Females over a year old are known as ''hens'', and younger females as ''[[pullet]]s'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/pullet |title=Pullet – definitions from Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen when she begins to lay eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age.  In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic term ''[[chook]]'' {{IPAc-en|tʃ|ʊ|k}} to describe all ages and both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Definition of "chook" in ''Encarta''.  The vernacular use is said to be offensive in this dictionary but it may also be used as a term of jocular familiarity |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/chook.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwQrJia9?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/chook.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young are often called ''chicks''.

"Chicken" originally referred to young domestic fowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Encyclopedia of Historic and Endangered Livestock and Poultry Breeds |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJCTL_mC5w4C |publisher=Yale University Press |date=2001-01-01 |isbn=978-0300138139 |first=Janet Vorwald |last=Dohner}}&lt;/ref&gt; The species as a whole was then called ''domestic fowl'', or just ''[[fowl]]''.  This use of "chicken" survives in the phrase "Hen and Chickens", sometimes used as a British [[public house]] or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks or islands in the sea (see for example [[Hen and Chicken Islands]]). The word "chicken" is sometimes erroneously construed to mean females exclusively, despite the term "hen" for females being in wide circulation, and the term “rooster” for males being that most commonly used.

In the [[Deep South]] of the United States, chickens are also referred to by the slang term ''[[yardbird]]''.&lt;ref name=berhardt&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berhardt |first1=Clyde E.

The average chicken may live for five to ten years, depending on the [[breed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ruleworks.co.uk/cgi-bin/TUfaq.exe?Guide=Poultry&amp;Category=Poultry%20-%20General#q9 |title=The Poultry Guide – A to Z and FAQs |publisher=Ruleworks.co.uk |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The world's oldest known chicken was a hen which died of heart failure at the age of 16 years according to the [[Guinness World Records]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Jamon. [http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060806/NEWS/608060400/1007/NEWS02 Tuscaloosanews.com "World’s oldest chicken starred in magic shows, was on 'Tonight Show’"], ''[[Tuscaloosa News]]'' (Alabama, USA). August 6, 2006.  Retrieved on February 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks (''hackles'') and backs (''saddle''), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the [[Sebright chicken]], the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the [[Comb (anatomy)|comb]], or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called [[Wattle (anatomy)|wattles]]. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called [[Caruncle (bird anatomy)|caruncles]].  Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males.
A ''muff'' or ''beard'' is a [[mutation]] found in several chicken breeds which causes extra [[feather]]ing under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a [[beard]].
Domestic chickens are not capable of long distance flight, although lighter birds are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.

=== Behavior ===
==== Social behaviour ====
[[File:Hen with chicks, Raisen district, MP, India.jpg|thumb|x200px|Hen with chicks, India.]]
[[File:Cascais Costa do Esteril 52 (36583204550).jpg|thumb|200px|Hen with chicks, [[Portugal]].]]
Chickens are [[gregarious]] birds and live together in [[herd|flocks]]. They have a communal approach to the [[avian incubation|incubation]] of eggs and raising of young. Individual chickens in a flock will dominate others, establishing a "[[pecking order]]", with dominant individuals having priority for food access and nesting locations. Removing hens or roosters from a flock causes a temporary disruption to this social order until a new pecking order is established. Adding hens, especially younger birds, to an existing flock can lead to fighting and injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stonehead |url=http://stonehead.wordpress.com/2006/06/28/introducing-new-hens-to-a-flock/ |title=Introducing new hens to a flock " Musings from a Stonehead |publisher=Stonehead.wordpress.com |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When a rooster finds food, he may call other chickens to eat first. He does this by clucking in a high pitch as well as picking up and dropping the food. This behaviour may also be observed in mother hens to call their chicks and encourage them to eat.

A rooster's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call and sends a territorial signal to other roosters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://phys.org/news/2015-07-cock-roosters-crow.html |title=Top cock: Roosters crow in pecking order |access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, roosters may also crow in response to sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after laying an egg, and also to call their chicks. Chickens also give different warning calls when they sense a predator approaching from the air or on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1993-07-01 |title=On the meaning of alarm calls: functional reference in an avian vocal system |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347283711589 |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=23–38 |doi=10.1006/anbe.1993.1158 |issn=0003-3472 |last1=Evans |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Evans |first2=Linda |last3=Marler |first3=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Courtship ====
To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near a hen ("a circle dance"), often lowering the wing which is closest to the hen.&lt;ref name="grandin69"&gt;{{cite book |title=Animals in Translation |last=Grandin |first=Temple |authorlink=Temple Grandin |author2=Johnson, Catherine |year=2005 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York City |isbn=978-0-7432-4769-6 |pages=69–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dance triggers a response in the hen&lt;ref name="grandin69" /&gt; and when she responds to his "call", the rooster may mount the hen and proceed with the mating.

More specifically, mating typically involves the following sequence:  1. Male approaching the hen.  2. Male pre-copulatory waltzing.  3. Male waltzing.  4. Female crouching (receptive posture) or stepping aside or running away (if unwilling to copulate). 5. Male mounting. 6. Male treading with both feet  on hen’s back. 7. Male tail bending (following successful copulation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cheng |first=Kimberly M.  and Burns, Jeffrey T. |date=1988 |title=Dominance relationship and mating behavior of domestic cocks--a model to study mate-guarding and sperm competition in birds |url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/condor/v090n03/p0697-p0704.pdf |journal=The Condor |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=697–704 |via= |doi=10.2307/1368360 |jstor=1368360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nesting and laying behaviour ====
[[File:Chicken eggs.jpg|thumb|200px|Chicken [[egg (biology)|eggs]] vary in colour depending on the hen, typically ranging from bright white to shades of brown and even blue, green, and recently reported purple (found in South Asia) ([[Araucana]] varieties).]]
[[File:Küken vor dem ersten Ausflug.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Chicks before their first outing]]

Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own.  The result of this behaviour is that a flock will use only a few preferred locations, rather than having a different nest for every bird.  Hens will often express a preference to lay in the same location. It is not unknown for two (or more) hens to try to share the same nest at the same time. If the nest is small, or one of the hens is particularly determined, this may result in chickens trying to lay on top of each other.  There is evidence that individual hens prefer to be either solitary or gregarious nesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sherwin |first1=C.M. |last2=Nicol |first2=C.J. |year=1993 |title=Factors influencing floor-laying by hens in modified cages |url= |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=36 |issue=2–3 |pages=211–222 |doi=10.1016/0168-1591(93)90011-d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Broodiness ====
Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] is complete, and they will then incubate all the eggs. Hens are then said to "go [[Broodiness|broody]]".  The broody hen will stop laying and instead will focus on the incubation of the eggs (a full clutch is usually about 12 eggs). She will "sit" or "set" on the nest, protesting or pecking in defense if disturbed or removed, and she will rarely leave the nest to eat, drink, or dust-bathe.  While brooding, the hen maintains the nest at a constant temperature and humidity, as well as turning the eggs regularly during the first part of the incubation.  To stimulate broodiness, owners may place several artificial eggs in the nest.  To discourage it, they may place the hen in an elevated cage with an open wire floor.

[[Breed]]s artificially developed for [[egg as food|egg production]] rarely go broody, and those that do often stop part-way through the incubation. However, other breeds, such as the [[Cochin (chicken)|Cochin]], [[Cornish (chicken)|Cornish]] and [[Silkie (chicken)|Silkie]], do regularly go broody, and they make excellent mothers, not only for chicken eggs but also for those of other species—even those with much smaller or larger eggs and different incubation periods, such as [[quail]], [[pheasant]]s, [[turkey (bird)|turkeys]] or [[Goose|geese]].

==== Hatching and early life ====
Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21 days.&lt;ref name="grandin69" /&gt;  Development of the chick starts only when incubation begins, so all chicks hatch within a day or two of each other, despite perhaps being laid over a period of two weeks or so.  Before hatching, the hen can hear the chicks peeping inside the eggs, and will gently cluck to stimulate them to break out of their shells. The chick begins by "pipping"; pecking a breathing hole with its [[egg tooth]] towards the blunt end of the egg, usually on the upper side.  The chick then rests for some hours, absorbing the remaining egg yolk and withdrawing the blood supply from the membrane beneath the shell (used earlier for breathing through the shell).  The chick then enlarges the hole, gradually turning round as it goes, and eventually severing the blunt end of the shell completely to make a lid.  The chick crawls out of the remaining shell, and the wet [[Down feather|down]] dries out in the warmth of the nest.

Hens usually remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick hatches, and during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the internal [[yolk sac]].  Some breeds sometimes start eating cracked eggs, which can become habitual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://ps.oxfordjournals.org/content/64/5/789.short | doi=10.3382/ps.0640789| pmid=4001066| title=Early Egg Production in Genetically Blind (rc/rc) Chickens in Comparison with Sighted (Rc+/rc) Controls| journal=Poultry Science| volume=64| issue=5| pages=789–794| year=1985| last1=Ali| first1=A.| last2=Cheng| first2=K.

She leads them to food and water and will call them toward edible items, but seldom feeds them directly. She continues to care for them until they are several weeks old.

=== Embryology ===
[[File:Embryo.ogv|thumb|Earliest gestation stages and blood circulation of a chicken embryo]]
In 2006, scientists researching the ancestry of birds "turned on" a chicken [[recessive gene]], ''talpid2'', and found that the embryo jaws initiated formation of teeth, like those found in ancient bird fossils. John Fallon, the overseer of the project, stated that chickens have "...retained the ability to make teeth, under certain conditions... ."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1666805 Scientists Find Chickens Retain Ancient Ability to Grow Teeth] Ammu Kannampilly, [[ABC News]], February 27, 2006.

=== Origins ===
[[File:Gallus gallus male Kaziranga 0.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Male red junglefowl.]]

The domestic chicken is descended primarily from the [[red junglefowl]] (''Gallus gallus'') and is scientifically classified as the same species.&lt;ref name=nature&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wong |first1=GK |display-authors=etal |title=A genetic variation map for chicken with 2.8 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms |journal=Nature |volume=432 |issue=7018 |pages=717–722 |doi=10.1038/nature03156 |pmid=15592405 |pmc=2263125 |date=December 2004 |bibcode=2004Natur.432..717B}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it can and does freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.&lt;ref name=nature /&gt; Recent genetic analysis has revealed that at least the gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the [[grey junglefowl]] (''G. sonneratii'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eriksson |first1=J |last2=Larson |first2=G |last3=Gunnarsson |first3=U |last4=Bed'hom |first4=B |last5=Tixier-Boichard |first5=M |display-authors=etal |year=2008 |title=Identification of the Yellow Skin Gene Reveals a Hybrid Origin of the Domestic Chicken |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000010 |journal=PLoS Genet |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=e1000010 |pmid=18454198 |pmc=2265484}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional view is that chickens [[domestication|were first domesticated]] for [[cockfighting]] in Asia, Africa, and Europe.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt; In the last decade, there have been a number of genetic studies to clarify the origins. According to one early study, a single domestication event which took place in what now is the country of [[Thailand]] gave rise to the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.&lt;ref name="oneMatriarch"&gt;{{citation |title=One subspecies of the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus gallus) suffices as the matriarchic ancestor of all domestic breeds |first=A |last=Fumihito |first2=T |last2=Miyake |first3=S |last3=Sumi |first4=M |last4=Takada |first5=S |last5=Ohno |first6=N |last6=Kondo |journal=PNAS |date=December 20, 1994 |volume=91 |number=26 |pages=12505–12509 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.26.12505 |pmid=7809067 |bibcode=1994PNAS...9112505F |pmc=45467}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that study was later found to be based on incomplete data, and recent studies point to multiple maternal origins, with the [[clade]] found in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]], where a large number of unique [[haplotype]]s occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Yi-Ping |last=Liu |first2=Gui-Sheng |last2=Wu |first3=Yong-Gang |last3=Yao |first4=Yong-Wang |last4=Miao |first5=Gordon |last5=Luikart |first6=Mumtaz |last6=Baig |first7=Albano |last7=Beja-Pereira |first8=Zhao-Li |last8=Ding |first9=Malliya Gounder |last9=Palanichamy |first10=Ya-Ping |last10=Zhang |title=Multiple maternal origins of chickens: Out of the Asian jungles |journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution |volume=38 |number=1 |year=2006 |pages=12–19 |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2005.09.014 |pmid=16275023}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zeder |year=2006 |title=Documenting domestication: the intersection of genetics and archaeology |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2006.01.007 |journal=Trends in Genetics |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=139–155 |pmid=16458995 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is postulated that the red junglefowl, known as the bamboo fowl in many Southeast Asian languages, is a special bird well-adapted to take advantage of the large amounts of fruits that are produced during the end of the 50-year [[bamboo]] seeding cycle, to boost its own reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Rick |last=King |title=Rat Attack |date=February 24, 2009 |journal=NOVA and National Geographic Television |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/nature/rat-attack.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of this predisposition for prolific reproduction of the red junglefowl when exposed to large amounts of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Rick |last=King |title=Plant vs. Predator |date=February 1, 2009 |journal=NOVA |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/nature/plant-vs-predator.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been claimed (based on paleoclimatic assumptions) that chickens were domesticated in Southern China in 6000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=West |first1=B. |last2=Zhou |first2=B.X. |year=1988 |title=Did chickens go north?

Instead, the origin could be the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappan culture]] of the [[Indus River|Indus Valley]]. Eventually, the chicken moved to the [[Tarim Basin|Tarim basin]] of central Asia. The chicken reached Europe (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Ukraine) about 3000 BC.&lt;ref name="CHOF"&gt;CHOF : The Cambridge History of Food, 2000, [[Cambridge University Press]], vol.1,  pp496-499&lt;/ref&gt;
Introduction into Western Europe came far later, about the 1st millennium BC. Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts as far as Iberia. Breeding increased under the [[Roman Empire]], and was reduced in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;  [[DNA sequencing|Genetic sequencing]] of chicken bones from archaeological sites in Europe revealed that in the [[High Middle Ages]] chickens became less aggressive and began to lay eggs earlier in the breeding season.&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Marley |title=Fast Food |journal=Archaeology |date=Sep–Oct 2017 |volume=70 |issue=5 |page=18 |url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=38&amp;sid=d022d3dd-d76c-4a0c-8bda-3d22c2e5033b%40sessionmgr103 |accessdate=31 August 2017 |format=PDF |issn=0003-8113 |postscript={{subscription needed |via=[https://www.ebsco.com EBSCO]'s Master File Complete}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Middle East traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC, in [[Syria]]; chickens went southward only in the 1st millennium BC. They reached [[Egypt]] for purposes of [[cockfighting]] about 1400 BC, and became widely bred only in [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaic]] Egypt (about 300 BC).&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt; Little is known about the chicken's introduction into Africa. It was during the [[Hellenistic period]] (4th-2nd centuries BC), in the Southern Levant, that chickens began widely to be domesticated for food.&lt;ref name="pnas.org"/&gt; This change occurred at least 100 years before domestication of chickens spread to Europe.

Three possible routes of introduction in about the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian [[Nile River|Nile]] Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the [[Sahara Desert|Sahara]]. The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;

Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western conquest is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;

A lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by [[extinction]] may also help with research into this area.&lt;ref name="CHOF" /&gt;

==== South America ====
An unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the [[araucana]], bred in southern [[Chile]] by the [[Mapuche]] people. Araucanas, some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears, lay blue-green eggs. It has long been suggested that they pre-date the arrival of European chickens brought by the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] and are evidence of [[pre-Columbian]] trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples, particularly the Polynesians, and South America. In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the [[Arauco Peninsula]] in [[Zona Sur|south-central Chile]]. Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070604/full/447620b.html DNA reveals how the chicken crossed the sea] Brendan Borrell, ''Nature'', June 5, 2007. Retrieved October 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus's arrival in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Storey et al., "Radiocarbon and DNA evidence for a pre-Columbian introduction of Polynesian chickens to Chile", ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0703993104; John Noble Wilford, "First Chickens in Americas were Brought from Polynesia, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a later report looking at the same specimens concluded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gongora |first1=Jaime |last2=Rawlence |first2=Nicolas J. |last3=Mobegi |first3=Victor A. |last4=Jianlin |first4=Han |last5=Alcalde |first5=Jose A. |last6=Matus |first6=Jose T. |last7=Hanotte |first7=Olivier |last8=Moran |first8=Chris |last9=Austin |first9=J. | last10 = Ulm | first10 = Sean |last11=Anderson |first11=Atholl J. |last12=Larson |first12=Greger |last13=Cooper |first13=Alan |year=2008 |title=Indo-European and Asian origins for Chilean and Pacific chickens revealed by mtDNA |url= |journal=PNAS |volume=105 |issue=30 |pages=10308–10313 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0801991105 |pmid=18663216 |pmc=2492461 |bibcode=2008PNAS..10510308G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperature regulation is the most critical factor for a successful hatch. Variations of more than 1&amp;nbsp;°C (1.8&amp;nbsp;°F) from the optimum temperature of {{convert|37.5|°C|°F}} will reduce hatch rates. Humidity is also important because the rate at which eggs lose water by evaporation depends on the ambient relative humidity. Evaporation can be assessed by candling, to view the size of the air sac, or by measuring weight loss. [[Relative humidity]] should be increased to around 70% in the last three days of incubation to keep the membrane around the hatching chick from drying out after the chick cracks the shell. Lower humidity is usual in the first 18 days to ensure adequate evaporation. The position of the eggs in the incubator can also influence hatch rates. For best results, eggs should be placed with the pointed ends down and turned regularly (at least three times per day) until one to three days before hatching. If the eggs aren't turned, the [[embryo]] inside may stick to the shell and may hatch with physical defects. Adequate ventilation is necessary to provide the [[embryo]] with oxygen. Older eggs require increased ventilation.

Many commercial incubators are industrial-sized with shelves holding tens of thousands of eggs at a time, with rotation of the eggs a fully automated process. Home incubators are boxes holding from 6 to 75 eggs; they are usually electrically powered, but in the past some were heated with an oil or paraffin lamp.

[[File:Persian Cock.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Vatican Persian Cock — A 1919 print of a fabric square of a Persian cock or a Persian bird design belonging to the Vatican ([[Holy See]]) in Rome dating to 600 CE. Notice the [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]] denoting the status of being [[holy]] in that religious schema.]]
Since antiquity chickens have been, and still are, a sacred animal in some cultures&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com"&gt;{{cite magazine |last1=Adler |first1=Jerry |last2=Lawler |first2=Andrew |date=June 2012 |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/How-the-Chicken-Conquered-the-World.html |magazine=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; and deeply embedded within belief systems and [[religious worship]]. The term "Persian bird" for the rooster appears to have been given by the Greeks after Persian contact "because of his great importance and his religious use among the Persians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peters |first=John P. |date=1913 |title=The Cock |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AGUPAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA377 |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=33 |pages=363–396 |jstor=592841 |doi=10.2307/592841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesia]] the chicken has great significance during the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[cremation]] ceremony. A chicken is considered a channel for [[evil spirit]]s which may be present during the ceremony. A chicken is tethered by the leg and kept present at the ceremony for its duration to ensure that any evil spirits present go into the chicken and not the family members. The chicken is then taken home and returns to its normal life.

In [[ancient Greece]], the chicken was not normally used for sacrifices, perhaps because it was still considered an exotic animal. Because of its valor, the cock is found as an attribute of [[Ares]], [[Heracles]], and [[Athena]]. The alleged last words of [[Socrates]] as he died from [[conium|hemlock]] poisoning, as recounted by [[Plato]], were "[[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], I owe a cock to [[Asclepius]]; will you remember to pay the debt?", signifying that death was a cure for the illness of life.

The Greeks believed that even lions were afraid of roosters. Several of [[Aesop's Fables]] reference this belief.

In the [[New Testament]], Jesus prophesied the betrayal by [[Saint Peter|Peter]]: "Jesus answered, 'I tell you, Peter, before the rooster crows today, you will deny three times that you know me.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:34&lt;/ref&gt; It happened,&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:61&lt;/ref&gt; and Peter cried bitterly. This made the rooster a symbol for both vigilance and betrayal.

Earlier, Jesus compares himself to a mother hen when talking about [[Jerusalem]]: "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather your children together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were not willing."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 23:37; also Luke 13:34. For a recent study of chickens in the New Testament, see Joshua N. Tilton "[http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/12933/ Chickens and the Cultural Context of the Gospels]" [http://www.jerusalemperspective.com/ www.jerusalemperspective.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the sixth century, [[Pope Gregory I]] declared the rooster the emblem of Christianity&lt;ref&gt;The Antiquary: a magazine devoted to the study of the past, Volume 17 edited by [[Edward Walford]], [[John Charles Cox]], George Latimer Apperson – page 202&lt;/ref&gt; and another Papal enactment of the ninth century by [[Pope Nicholas I]]&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com" /&gt; ordered the figure of the rooster to be placed on every church steeple.&lt;ref&gt;''The Philadelphia Museum bulletin'', Volumes 1-5, Pennsylvania Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, p 14, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Central European [[Folklore|folk tales]], the [[devil]] is believed to flee at the first crowing of a rooster.

In traditional [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish]] practice, a kosher animal is swung around the head and then slaughtered on the afternoon before [[Yom Kippur]], the Day of Atonement, in a ritual called [[kapparos]]; it is now common practice to cradle the bird and move it around the head. A chicken or fish is typically used because it is commonly available (and small enough to hold). The sacrifice of the animal is to receive atonement, for the animal symbolically takes on all the person's sins in kapparos. The meat is then donated to the poor. A woman brings a hen for the ceremony, while a man brings a rooster. Although not a sacrifice in the biblical sense, the death of the animal reminds the penitent sinner that his or her life is in God's hands.

The [[Talmud]] speaks of learning "courtesy toward one's mate" from the rooster.&lt;ref&gt;Eruvin 100b.&lt;/ref&gt; This might refer to the fact that when a rooster finds something good to eat, he calls his hens to eat first.  A rooster might also come to the aid of a hen if she is attacked. The [[Talmud]] likewise provides us with the statement "Had the Torah not been given to us, we would have learned modesty from cats, honest toil from ants, chastity from doves and gallantry from cocks",&lt;ref&gt;A Treasury of [[Jew]]ish Quotations By Joseph L. Baron – 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan ben Nappaha. [[Talmud]]: Erubin 100b&lt;/ref&gt; which may be further understood as to that of the gallantry of cocks being taken in the context of a religious instilling vessel of "a girt one of the loins" ([[Young's Literal Translation]]) that which is "stately in his stride" and "move with stately bearing" in the [[Book of Proverbs]] 30:29-31 as referenced by [[Michael V. Fox]] in his ''Proverbs'' 10-31 where Saʻadiah ben Yosef Gaon ([[Saadia Gaon]]) identifies the definitive trait of "A cock girded about the loins" in [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] 30:31 ([[Douay–Rheims Bible]]) as "the honesty of their behavior and their success",&lt;ref&gt;PROVERBS 10-31, Volume 18, Michael V. Fox, Yale University Press 2009, 704 pages&lt;/ref&gt; identifying a spiritual purpose of a religious vessel within that religious instilling schema of purpose and use.

The chicken is one of the symbols of the [[Chinese Zodiac]]. In [[Chinese folk religion]], a cooked chicken as a religious offering is usually limited to ancestor veneration and worship of village deities. Vegetarian deities such as the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] are not recipients of such offerings. Under some observations, an offering of chicken is presented with "serious" prayer (while roasted pork is offered during a joyous celebration). In [[Confucian]] Chinese weddings, a chicken can be used as a substitute for one who is seriously ill or not available (e.g., sudden death) to attend the ceremony. A red silk scarf is placed on the chicken's head and a close relative of the absent bride/groom holds the chicken so the ceremony may proceed. However, this practice is rare today.

A [[cockatrice]] was supposed to have been born from an egg laid by a rooster, as well as killed by a rooster's call.

[[File:Red junglefowl hm.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[red junglefowl]]]]
An early domestication of chickens in Southeast Asia is probable, since the word for domestic chicken (''*manuk'') is part of the reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian language]] {{crossref|(see [[Austronesian languages]])}}. Chickens, together with dogs and pigs, were the domestic animals of the [[Lapita]] culture,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FJ9ULYwX3zgC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=Chickens,+together+with+dogs+and+pigs,+were+the+domestic+animals+of+the+Lapita+culture,+the+first+Neolithic+culture+of+Oceania.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3e3mOr4AZE&amp;sig=MJjoAwUowJLntgnWNZpz2CQxpOc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UmVLUPPYD8KO2AWrt4GYAw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Chickens%2C%20together%20with%20dogs%20and%20pigs%2C%20were%20the%20domestic%20animals%20of%20the%20Lapita%20culture%2C%20the%20first%20Neolithic%20culture%20of%20Oceania.&amp;f=false] The Cambridge History of the Pacific Islanders By Donald Denoon, Malama Meleisea – Cambridge University Press, March 25, 2004 – page 56&lt;/ref&gt; the first [[Neolithic]] culture of Oceania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tlSspaBLkhoC&amp;pg=PA411&amp;lpg=PA411&amp;dq=lapita+the+first+Neolithic+culture+of+Oceania&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WIEGSQMt8O&amp;sig=vH8TP9pGgf2FwZ4upxIjoxfCXbs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1GVLUIqrIMaI2gW_uYCIBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=lapita%20the%20first%20Neolithic%20culture%20of%20Oceania&amp;f=false] Anthropological Genetics: Theory, Methods and Applications edited by Michael H.

In ancient Greece, chickens were still rare and were a rather prestigious food for [[Symposium|symposia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/onagriculturewit02coluuoft |title=On agriculture, with a recension of the text and an English translation by Harrison Boyd Ash |last=Columella |first=Lucius Junius Moderatus |date=1941 |publisher=Cambridge Harvard University Press |others=Robarts - University of Toronto |page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delos]] seems to have been a center of chicken breeding (Columella, ''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.4). "About 3200 BC chickens were common in [[Sindh]]. After the attacks of [[Aria]] people these fowls spred from Sindh to Balakh and Iran. During attacks and wars between Iranian and  Greeks the chickens of Hellanic breed came in Iran and about 1000 BC Hellanic chickens came into [[Sindh]] through [[Medan]]".&lt;ref&gt;Marely A.Jull; Poultry Husbandry, chapter I,pages2-3; New York,1938&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] used chickens for oracles, both when flying ("ex avibus", [[Augury]]) and when feeding ("auspicium ex tripudiis", [[Alectryomancy]]). The hen ("gallina") gave a favourable omen ("auspicium ratum"), when appearing from the left (Cic., de Div. ii.26), like the crow and the owl.

For the oracle "ex tripudiis" according to [[Cicero]] (Cic. de Div. ii.34), any bird could be used in [[auspice]], and shows at one point that any bird could perform the ''tripudium''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6RYhAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA601&amp;lpg=PA601&amp;dq=The+Romans+used+chickens+for+oracles&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OpWs3qaTCq&amp;sig=JQkBl7qznVphAkr5c_EsrNfQP6c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cpxLUNv2CIjq2QX0yYHwBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sacred%20chickens&amp;f=false] A classical and archaeological dictionary of the manners, customs, laws, institutions, arts, etc. of the celebrated nations of antiquity, and of the middle ages: To which is prefixed A synoptical and chronological view of ancient history – P.

The chickens were cared for by the pullarius, who opened their cage and fed them pulses or a special kind of soft cake when an augury was needed. If the chickens stayed in their cage, made noises ("occinerent"), beat their wings or flew away, the omen was bad; if they ate greedily, the omen was good.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PTECAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA458&amp;lpg=PA458&amp;dq=if+they+ate+greedily,+the+omen+was+good&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=py1anUTtz5&amp;sig=HLNcfIBhlBnZ5zo7d3eUv35-8zQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dKFLUL3QE9H82gW_lYCICA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=if%20they%20ate%20greedily%2C%20the%20omen%20was%20good&amp;f=false] Chambers's information for the people, ed. by W. and R.

In 162 BC, the ''Lex Faunia'' forbade fattening hens to conserve grain rations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QmevzbQ0AsIC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=Rome+forbade+the+consumption+of+fattened+chickens&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oNJ71NY_rm&amp;sig=KgEDxCUwRHAtFHMDRS8t4Uw5jlk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nndLUJaJHc6ByAHYtoC4DQ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Rome%20forbade%20the%20consumption%20of%20fattened%20chickens&amp;f=false] A History of Food By Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat – John Wiley &amp; Sons, March 25, 2009 – page 305&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[A History of Food By Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat – John Wiley &amp; Sons, March 25, 2009 – page 305]&lt;/ref&gt;  To get around this, the Romans castrated roosters ([[capon]]), which resulted in a doubling of size&lt;ref&gt;Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat, (Anthea Bell, translator) ''The History of Food'', Ch. 11 "The History of Poultry", revised ed. 2009, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; despite the law that was passed in Rome that forbade the consumption of fattened chickens. It was renewed a number of times, but does not seem to have been successful. Fattening chickens with bread soaked in milk was thought to give especially delicious results. The Roman gourmet [[Apicius]] offers 17 recipes for chicken, mainly boiled chicken with a sauce. All parts of the animal are used: the recipes include the [[stomach]], liver, [[testicle]]s and even the [[pygostyle]] (the fatty "tail" of the chicken where the tail feathers attach).

The Roman author [[Columella]] gives advice on chicken breeding in the eighth book of his treatise, ''De Re Rustica'' (On Agriculture). He identified Tanagrian, Rhodic, Chalkidic and Median (commonly misidentified as Melian) breeds, which have an impressive appearance, a quarrelsome nature and were used for [[cockfighting]] by the Greeks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.4). For farming, native (Roman) chickens are to be preferred, or a cross between native hens and Greek cocks (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.13). Dwarf chickens are nice to watch because of their size but have no other advantages.

According to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.2.7), the ideal flock consists of 200 birds, which can be supervised by one person if someone is watching for stray animals. White chickens should be avoided as they are not very fertile and are easily caught by eagles or goshawks. One cock should be kept for five hens. In the case of Rhodian and Median cocks that are very heavy and therefore not much inclined to sex, only three hens are kept per cock. The hens of heavy fowls are not much inclined to brood; therefore their eggs are best hatched by normal hens. A hen can hatch no more than 15-23 eggs, depending on the time of year, and supervise no more than 30 hatchlings. Eggs that are long and pointed give more male hatchlings, rounded eggs mainly female hatchlings (''De Re Rustica'' 8.5.11).

Columella also states that chicken coops should face southeast and lie adjacent to the kitchen, as smoke is beneficial for the animals and "poultry never thrive so well as in warmth and smoke" (''De Re Rustica'' 8.3.1).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uCVOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=Per+Columella,+chicken+coops&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=surOAlOzK9&amp;sig=M7g4WsSKZE0xt-tSoYD8dmPyi8w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=MqJLULLIMarg2wWtpoHYDQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Per%20Columella%2C%20chicken%20coops&amp;f=false] The New England farmer, Volume 6 By Thomas Greene Fessenden – Thomas W. Shepard, 1828 – page 69&lt;/ref&gt; Coops should consist of three rooms and possess a hearth. Dry dust or ash should be provided for dust-baths.

According to Columella (''De Re Rustica'' 8.4.1), chickens should be fed on barley groats, small chick-peas, millet and wheat bran, if they are cheap. Wheat itself should be avoided as it is harmful to the birds. Boiled ryegrass (''Lolium'' sp.) and the leaves and seeds of alfalfa (''Medicago sativa'' L.) can be used as well. Grape marc can be used, but only when the hens stop laying eggs, that is, about the middle of November; otherwise eggs are small and few. When feeding grape marc, it should be supplemented with some bran. Hens start to lay eggs after the [[winter solstice]], in warm places around the first of January, in colder areas in the middle of February. Parboiled barley increases their fertility; this should be mixed with alfalfa leaves and seeds, or vetches or millet if alfalfa is not at hand. Free-ranging chickens should receive two cups of barley daily.

Columella&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=On agriculture, volume II: books 5–9 |last=ES Forster, EH Heffner |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1954 |isbn=978-0674994485 |location=The Loeb Classical Library |pages=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; advises farmers to slaughter hens that are older than three years, those that aren't productive or are poor care-takers of their eggs, and particularly those that eat their own and other hens' eggs.

Chickens were spread by [[Polynesia]]n seafarers and reached [[Easter Island]] in the 12th century AD, where they were the only domestic animal, with the possible exception of the [[Polynesian rat]] (''Rattus exulans''). They were housed in extremely solid [[chicken coop]]s built from stone, which was first reported as such to Linton Palmer in 1868, who also "expressed his doubts about this".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W1xCKNncacEC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=first+chickens+on+easter+island&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VKw8YhMpCU&amp;sig=8eRmXh4PLFOn8AK8_25faTE4HjM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=bIBLULfOFuGCyAGg_YHoDg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=chickens&amp;f=false] The Enigmas of Easter Island  By Paul Bahn, John Flenley – Oxford University Press, May 29, 2003 – page 96&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3630">In [[macroeconomics]], the '''classical dichotomy''' is the idea, attributed to [[classical economics|classical]] and pre-[[Keynesian]] economics, that [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real and nominal variables]] can be analyzed separately. To be precise, an economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if real variables such as output  and [[real interest rate]]s can be completely analyzed without considering what is happening to their nominal counterparts, the money value of output and the interest rate. In particular, this means that [[real GDP]] and other real variables can be determined without knowing the level of the nominal [[money supply]] or the rate of [[inflation]].  An economy exhibits the classical dichotomy if money is [[neutrality of money|neutral]], affecting only the price level, not real variables.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The classical dichotomy was integral to the thinking of some pre-Keynesian economists ("[[Veil of money|money as a veil]]") as a long-run proposition and is found today in [[new classical economics|new classical]] theories of macroeconomics. In new classical macroeconomics there is a short-run [[Phillips curve]] which can shift vertically according to the [[rational expectations]] being reviewed continuously. In the strict sense, money is not neutral in the short-run, that is, classical dichotomy does not hold, since agents tend to respond to changes in prices and in the quantity of money through changing their supply decisions. However, money should be neutral in the long run, and the classical dichotomy should be restored in the long-run, since there was no relationship between prices and real macroeconomic performance at the data level. This view has serious economic policy consequences. In the long-run, owing to the dichotomy, money is not assumed to be an effective instrument in controlling macroeconomic performance, while in the short-run there is a trade-off between prices and output (or unemployment), but, owing to rational expectations, government cannot exploit it in order to build a systematic countercyclical economic policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbács |first=Peter |title=The Theory of New Classical Macroeconomics. A Positive Critique |location=Heidelberg/New York/Dordrecht/London |publisher=Springer |year=2015 |isbn= 978-3-319-17578-2 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-17578-2 |url = https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-17578-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Keynesian economics|Keynesians]] and [[Monetarism|monetarists]] reject the classical dichotomy, because they argue that prices are [[sticky (economics)|sticky]]. That is, they think prices fail to adjust in the [[Long run and short run|short run]], so that an increase in the money supply raises [[aggregate demand]] and thus alters real macroeconomic variables. [[Post-Keynesians]] reject the classic dichotomy as well, for different reasons, emphasizing the role of banks in [[money creation|creating money]], as in [[monetary circuit theory]].

A '''cognitive module''' is, in theories of the [[modularity of mind]] and the closely related [[society of mind theory]], a specialised tool or sub-unit that can be used by other parts to resolve [[cognitive]] tasks. The question of their existence and nature is a major topic in [[cognitive science]] and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Some see cognitive modules as an independent part of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Coltheart]]: [http://www.biols.susx.ac.uk/ugteach/cws/iin/Readings/coltheart.pdf ''Modularity and cognition''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040829145655/http://www.biols.susx.ac.uk/ugteach/cws/iin/Readings/coltheart.pdf |date=2004-08-29 }} - Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Others also see new thought patterns achieved by experience as cognitive modules.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tooby|Tooby, John]] and [[Leda Cosmides|Cosmides, Leda]] 1992 ''The Psychological Foundations of Culture'', in Barkow, Jerome H., Cosmides, Leda, Tooby, John, (1992) ''[[The Adapted Mind]]: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture,'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-506023-7}}, page 30-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a mechanism, if created by evolution, is known as ''[[evolved psychological mechanism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;David M.

==Psychological disorders – cognitive modules run amok==
Many common psychological and [[personality disorder]]s are caused by cognitive modules running amok.

'''[[Jealousy]]:''' A common cause of unnecessary conflict in relations is that a [[man]] is jealous of a [[woman]]'s  [[serial polygamy|previous sexual partners]] before she met him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web4health.info/en/answers/life-jealousy-past-relations.htm ''Problem with Jealousy of Past Relations''] By Gunborg Palme 2006&lt;/ref&gt; All people are born with a basic jealousy cognitive module, developed through as [[evolutionarily stable strategy|evolutionary strategy]] in order to [[sexual selection|safeguard a mate]] and trigger [[aggression]] towards competitors to ensure [[paternity (law)|paternity]] and prevent [[Offspring|bastards]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?q=Olivia+Judson&amp;btnG=Search+Books Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation: The Definitive Guide to the Evolutionary Biology of Sex] Olivia Judson, Dr. Publisher: Vintage; New Ed (2003), 320p. {{ISBN|0-09-928375-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this module is activated to too strong a degree, it becomes a personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Buss: ''The evolution of desire''] - 2nd edition, Basic Books 2003, pages 125ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margo Wilson and Martin Daly: ''The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Chattel'', in Jerome H. Barkow et al., The Adapted Mind, Oxford University Press, 1992, page 302-305.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David M. Buss: ''The evolution of desire''] - 2nd edition, Basic Books 2003, pages 129ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Stalking]]:''' An extreme psychological disorder related to jealousy is stalking.&lt;ref&gt;J. Reid Meloy ''The Psychology of Stalking - Clinical and Forensic Perspectives'', by J. Reid Meloy (ed.), Academic Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A stalker is a person (usually a man) who behaves as if he had a relation to another person (usually a woman) who is not interested in him. There are also women who stalk men, men who stalk men and women who stalk women, but most common is a man stalking a woman. In modern [[western culture]] this behaviour is strongly frowned upon.

'''[[Paranoia]]:'''&lt;ref&gt;''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - DSM-IV'', American Psychiatric Association 1994 page 287&lt;/ref&gt; Being suspicious of fellow human beings [[trait theory|is a trait]] to safeguard against perceived, secret [[game theory|plots against us]], a basic human cognitive module useful for [[natural selection|survival]]. But in some people, this turns into unreasonable suspiciousness where there is in reality no plotting against one. Such [[behaviour]] is by psychiatrists labeled as ''[[paranoid schizophrenia]]'' or in milder forms as ''[[paranoid personality disorder]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - DSM-IV'', American Psychiatric Association 1994 pages 634ff&lt;/ref&gt; These disorders thus occur when the suspiciousness cognitive module is triggered too often and too strongly for triggers that would not trigger this module in normal people.&lt;ref&gt;Erlene Rosowsky, Robert C. Abrams, Richard A. Zweig: Personality Disorders in Older Adults: Emerging Issues in Diagnosis and Treatment; Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1999. p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Obsessive-compulsive disorder]]:''' In this quite common disorder, a person will repeatedly check, for example, that a door is locked. One may repeatedly wash hands or other body parts, sometimes for hours, to ensure cleanliness.&lt;!--relation to phobias?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - DSM-IV'', American Psychiatric Association 1994 pages 417ff&lt;/ref&gt; Again, this disorder is a malfunction of a normal [[adaptation]] in all humans to check that a door is locked, to wash to keep us [[hygiene|clean]], etc.

'''[[Transference]]:'''&lt;ref&gt;Thornton, Stephen P. (2006) ''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/freud.htm Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)]''&lt;/ref&gt; A cognitive module developed to solve a particular problem can sometimes crop up in other situations where it is not appropriate. One may be angry at one's boss, but take the anger out on one's fellow man. Often, the transference is [[consciousness|unconscious]] (see also [[Subconscious mind]] and [[Unconscious mind]]). In [[psychotherapy]], the [[patient]] is made aware of this, which makes it easier to modify the unsuitable behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Gabbard GO, Horwitz L, Allen JG, Frieswyk S, Newsom G, Colson DB, Coyne L.: "Transference interpretation in the psychotherapy of borderline patients: a high-risk, high-gain phenomenon", Harv Rev Psychiatry. 1994 Jul-Aug;2(2):59-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimation]]:'''&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.iep.utm.edu/f/freud.htm Sigmund Freud (1856-1939)]'' Thornton, Stephen P. (2006)''&lt;/ref&gt; said that cognitive modules for some activities, such as [[sex]], may incorrectly show up in disguise in cases where they are not suitable. Freud also [[Sigmund Freud#The Unconscious|introduced the idea of the unconscious]], which interpreted as cognitive modules where a person is not aware of the initial cause of these modules and may use them inappropriately.

'''[[Schizophrenia]]:''' is a psychotic disorder where cognitive modules are triggered too often, overwhelming the brain with information.&lt;ref&gt;D. Weinberger, ''Prefrontal neurons and the genetics of schizophrenia'' Biological Psychiatry, Volume 50, Issue 11, Pages 825-844.&lt;/ref&gt; The inability to repress [[information processing|overwhelming information]] is a cause of schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;Randolph M. Nesse and Alan T. Lloyd, ''The Evolution of Psychodynamic Mechanisms'', in Jerome H. Barkow et al., The Adapted Mind, Oxford University Press, 1992, page 608.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment of cognitive module psychological disorders===
[[Cognitive therapy]] is a [[psychotherapeutic]] method that helps people better understand the cognitive modules that cause them to do certain things, and to teach them alternative, more appropriate cognitive modules to use instead in the future.

===Psychoanalytic view of cognitive modules===
According to [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic theory]], many cognitive modules are unconscious and [[psychological repression|repressed]], to avoid mental conflicts. ''Defenses'' are meant to be cognitive modules used to suppress the awareness of other cognitive modules. Unconscious cognitive modules may influence our behaviour without our being aware of it.

==Evolutionary psychology view==
In the research field of [[evolutionary psychology]] it is believed that some cognitive modules are inherited and some are created by learning, but the creation of new modules by learning is often guided by inherited modules.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Buss: ''Evolutionary Psychology - The New Science of the Mind''] - 2nd edition, Pearson Education 2004, pages 19–21&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the ability to drive a car or throw a basketball are certainly learned and not inherited modules, but they may make use of inherited modules to rapidly compute trajectories.

There is some disagreement between different social scientists on the importance to the capabilities of the human mind of inherited modules. Evolutionary psychologists claim that other social scientists do not accept that some modules are partially inherited,&lt;ref&gt;[[John Tooby|Tooby, John]] and [[Leda Cosmides|Cosmides, Leda]] 1992 ''The Psychological Foundations of Culture'', in ''[[The Adapted Mind]]: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture,'' Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-506023-7}} page 38.&lt;/ref&gt; other social scientists claim that evolutionary psychologists are exaggerating the importance of inherited cognitive modules.

==Memory and creative thought==
A very important aspect of how humans think is the ability, when encountering a situation or problem, to find more or less similar, but not identical, experiences or cognitive modules. This can be compared to what happens if you sound a tone near a piano. The piano string corresponding to this particular tone will then vibrate. But also other strings, from nearby strings, will vibrate to a lesser extent.

Exactly how the human mind does this is not known, but it is believed that when you encounter a situation or problem, many different cognitive modules are activated at the same time, and the mind selects those most useful for understanding a new situation or solving a new problem.&lt;ref&gt;Liane Gabora: [http://cogprints.org/2105/0/inklings.htm ''Toward a theory of creative inklings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015121252/http://cogprints.org/2105/0/inklings.htm |date=2007-10-15 }} In (R. Ascott, ed.) ''Art, Technology, and Consciousness,'' Intellect Press, p. 159-164.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Goleman, ''Vital lies, simple truths, Simon &amp; Schuster 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and law==
Most law-abiding people have cognitive modules that stop them from committing crimes. Criminals have different modules, causing criminal behaviour. Thus, cognitive modules can be a cause of both ethical and unethical behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Abrahamsen]]: The Psychology of Crime; Columbia University Press, 1960. p. 158ff&lt;/ref&gt;

In his research on popular [[social representations|representations]] of [[psychoanalysis]] in [[France]], [[Serge Moscovici]]  observed that different and even contradictory modes of thinking about the same issue often co-exist. In contemporary societies people are "speaking" medical, psychological, technical, and political languages in their daily affairs. By extending this phenomenon to the level of thought he suggests that "the dynamic co-existence—interference or specialization—of the distinct modalities of [[knowledge]], corresponding to definite relations between man and his environment, ''determines a state of cognitive polyphasia''".&lt;ref&gt;Moscovici, S. (1976). ''La psychanalyse son image et son public''. Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extension and applications==
[[Cognition|Cognitive]] systems do not habitually develop towards a state of [[consistency]]. Instead, judgements are based on representational terms being dominant in one field of interests, while playing a minor role in other fields; that is, thoughts tend to be ''locally'' but not ''globally consistent''. Contemporaries in Western and non-western societies alike face a variety of situations where particular modes of reasoning fit better than others. Some are more useful in the family and in matters involving relatives, and others are more apt in situations involving political, economic, societal, religious or scientific matters. Knowledge and talking are always situated.

[[Science|Scientific]] explanations frequently contradict everyday and common-sense based explanations. Nevertheless, people tend to apply each of the two ways of [[explanation]] in their talk depending on the audience and the particular situation. This can be observed with health related issues where [[Sandra Jovchelovitch]] and Marie-Claude Gervais have shown how members of the Chinese community attend to Western medical doctors and simultaneously apply traditional Chinese treatments.&lt;ref&gt;Jovchelovitch, S., &amp; Gervais, M.-C. (1999). Social representations of health and illness: The case of the Chinese community in England. Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology, 9, 247-260.&lt;/ref&gt; In their study on modernization processes in the educated middle-class of the city of [[Patna]] in [[India]], [[Wolfgang Wagner (social psychologist)|Wolfgang Wagner]], [[Gerard Duveen]], Matthias Themel and Jyoti Verma showed a similar behaviour with regard to [[mental health]]. Respondents in the study were more likely to mention traditional ideas about treatment in private and family contexts while displaying "modern" psychiatric reasoning in the public.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, W., Duveen, G., Verma, J. &amp; Themel, M. (2000). "I have some faith and at the same time I don't believe in it" - Cognitive polyphasia and culture change. Journal of Community and Applied Social Psychology, 10, 301-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of [[social representations|social representation theory]] such contradictions highlight the role of representational systems as serving the purpose of relating, social belonging and communication in everyday life. This contrasts with [[science]] that aims at veridical representations of the world according to standards of scientific evidence. Both systems of knowledge have their own domain of validity but they are at the same time fluid enough to cross-fertilize each other in [[dialog]]ical encounters.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, W. &amp; Hayes, N. (2005). Everyday Discourse and Common-Sense—The Theory of Social Representations. New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jovchelovitch, S. (2008). The rehabilitation of common sense: Social representations, science and cognitive polyphasia. Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 38(4), 431-448.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1347">The '''comparative case''' ([[list of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''comp'''}}) is a [[grammatical case]] used in languages such as [[Mari language|Mari]] and [[Chechen language|Chechen]] to mark a likeness to something. 

It is not to be confused with the [[comparison (grammar)|comparative degree]], a much more widely used paradigm used to signify heightening of [[adjectives]] and [[adverbs]].

In Mari, the comparative case is marked with the suffix -ла ('-la')  For example, if something were to taste like fish (кол - 'kol'), the form used would be колла - 'kolla'). It is also used in regard to languages, when denoting the language a person is speaking, writing, or hearing. Then, however, the accentuation varies slightly from the standard case. Usually, the suffix is not stressed. When it is used with languages, however, it is stressed.

In Chechen, it is marked with the suffix ''-l''. For example, ''sha'' is 'ice', ''shiila'' is 'cold', and ''shal shiila'' is 'cold as ice'.

In [[crystallography]], '''crystal structure''' is a description of the ordered arrangement of [[atom]]s, [[ion]]s or [[molecule]]s in a [[crystal|crystalline material]].&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Solid State Physics |edition=2nd |first1=J.R. |last1=Hook |first2=H.E. |last2=Hall |series=Manchester Physics Series |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=2010 |isbn=9780471928041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ordered structures occur from the intrinsic nature of the constituent particles to form symmetric patterns that repeat along the principal directions of [[Three-dimensional space (mathematics)|three-dimensional space]] in matter.

The smallest group of particles in the material that constitutes the repeating pattern is the '''unit cell''' of the structure. The unit cell completely defines the symmetry and structure of the entire crystal lattice, which is built up by repetitive [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] of the unit cell along its principal axes.  The repeating patterns are said to be located at the points of the [[Bravais lattice]].

The lengths of the principal axes, or edges, of the unit cell and the angles between them are the [[lattice constant]]s, also called ''lattice parameters''. The [[symmetry]] properties of the crystal are described by the concept of [[space group]]s.&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"/&gt; All possible symmetric arrangements of particles in three-dimensional space may be described by the 230 [[space groups]].

The crystal structure and symmetry play a critical role in determining many physical properties, such as [[cleavage (crystal)|cleavage]], [[electronic band structure]], and [[crystal optics|optical transparency]].

== Unit cell ==
Crystal structure is described in terms of the geometry of arrangement of particles in the unit cell. The unit cell is defined as the smallest repeating unit having the full symmetry of the crystal structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Basic Solid State Chemistry |first=Anthony R. |last=West |publisher=Wiley |edition=2nd |date=1999 |page=1 |isbn=978-0-471-98756-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The geometry of the unit cell is defined as a [[parallelepiped]], providing six lattice parameters taken as the lengths of the cell edges (''a'', ''b'', ''c'') and the angles between them (α, β, γ).  The positions of particles inside the unit cell are described by the [[fractional coordinates]] (''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'') along the cell edges, measured from a reference point. It is only necessary to report the coordinates of a smallest asymmetric subset of particles. This group of particles may be chosen so that it occupies the smallest physical space, which means that not all particles need to be physically located inside the boundaries given by the lattice parameters. All other particles of the unit cell are generated by the symmetry operations that characterize the symmetry of the unit cell. The collection of symmetry operations of the unit cell is expressed formally as the [[space group]] of the crystal structure.&lt;ref name="Space-group symmetry"&gt;International Tables for Crystallography (2006). Volume A, Space-group symmetry.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Miller indices ===
[[File:Miller Indices Cubes.svg|thumb|250px|Planes with different Miller indices in cubic crystals]]
Vectors and planes in a crystal lattice are described by the three-value [[Miller index]] notation. This syntax uses the indices ''ℓ'', ''m'', and ''n'' as directional orthogonal parameters, which are separated by 90°.&lt;ref name="Physics 1991"&gt;Encyclopaedia of Physics (2nd Edition), R.G. Lerner, G.L. Trigg, VHC publishers, 1991, ISBN (Verlagsgesellschaft) 3-527-26954-1, ISBN (VHC Inc.) 0-89573-752-3&lt;/ref&gt;

By definition, the syntax (''ℓmn'') denotes a plane that intercepts the three points ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/''ℓ'', ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/''m'', and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'', or some multiple thereof. That is, the Miller indices are proportional to the inverses of the intercepts of the plane with the unit cell (in the basis of the lattice vectors). If one or more of the indices is zero, it means that the planes do not intersect that axis (i.e., the intercept is "at infinity"). A plane containing a coordinate axis is translated so that it no longer contains that axis before its Miller indices are determined. The Miller indices for a plane are [[integer]]s with no common factors. Negative indices are indicated with horizontal bars, as in (1{{overbar|2}}3). In an orthogonal coordinate system for a cubic cell, the Miller indices of a plane are the Cartesian components of a vector normal to the plane.

Considering only (''ℓmn'') planes intersecting one or more lattice points (the ''lattice planes''), the distance ''d'' between adjacent lattice planes is related to the (shortest) [[reciprocal lattice]] vector orthogonal to the planes by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{2\pi}  {|\mathbf{g}_{\ell m n}|}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Planes and directions ===
The crystallographic directions are geometric [[line (mathematics)|line]]s linking nodes ([[atom]]s, [[ion]]s or [[molecule]]s) of a crystal. Likewise, the crystallographic [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]s are geometric ''planes'' linking nodes. Some directions and planes have a higher density of nodes. These high density planes have an influence on the behavior of the crystal as follows:&lt;ref name="Solid State Physics 2010"/&gt;

*[[optics|Optical properties]]: [[Refractive index]] is directly related to density (or periodic density fluctuations).
*[[Adsorption]] and [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactivity]]: Physical adsorption and chemical reactions occur at or near surface atoms or molecules. These phenomena are thus sensitive to the density of nodes.
*[[Surface tension]]: The condensation of a material means that the atoms, ions or molecules are more stable if they are surrounded by other similar species. The surface tension of an interface thus varies according to the density on the surface.

[[File:Cristal densite surface.svg|thumb|300px|Dense crystallographic planes]]

*Microstructural [[Crystallographic defect|defects]]: [[sintering|Pores]] and [[crystallite]]s tend to have straight grain boundaries following higher density planes.
*[[cleavage (crystal)|Cleavage]]: This typically occurs preferentially parallel to higher density planes.
*[[Plastic deformation]]: [[Dislocation]] glide occurs preferentially parallel to higher density planes. The perturbation carried by the dislocation ([[Burgers vector]]) is along a dense direction. The shift of one node in a more dense direction requires a lesser distortion of the crystal lattice.

Some directions and planes are defined by symmetry of the crystal system. In monoclinic, rhombohedral, tetragonal, and trigonal/hexagonal systems there is one unique axis (sometimes called the '''principal axis''') which has higher [[rotational symmetry]] than the other two axes. The '''basal plane''' is the plane perpendicular to the principal axis in these crystal systems. For triclinic, orthorhombic, and cubic crystal systems the axis designation is arbitrary and there is no principal axis.

==== Cubic structures ====
For the special case of simple cubic crystals, the lattice vectors are orthogonal and of equal length (usually denoted ''a''); similarly for the reciprocal lattice. So, in this common case, the Miller indices (''ℓmn'') and [''ℓmn''] both simply denote normals/directions in [[Cartesian coordinates]]. For cubic crystals with [[lattice constant]] ''a'', the spacing ''d'' between adjacent (ℓmn) lattice planes is (from above):
:&lt;math&gt;d_{\ell mn}= \frac {a} { \sqrt{\ell ^2 + m^2 + n^2} }&lt;/math&gt;
Because of the symmetry of cubic crystals, it is possible to change the place and sign of the integers and have equivalent directions and planes:

*Coordinates in ''angle brackets'' such as {{angbr|100}} denote a ''family'' of directions that are equivalent due to symmetry operations, such as [100], [010], [001] or the negative of any of those directions.
*Coordinates in ''curly brackets'' or ''braces'' such as {100} denote a family of plane normals that are equivalent due to symmetry operations, much the way angle brackets denote a family of directions.

For [[face-centered cubic]] (fcc) and [[body-centered cubic]] (bcc) lattices, the primitive lattice vectors are not orthogonal. However, in these cases the Miller indices are conventionally defined relative to the lattice vectors of the cubic [[supercell (crystal)|supercell]] and hence are again simply the [[Cartesian coordinates|Cartesian directions]].

===Interplanar spacing===
The spacing '''''d''''' between adjacent (''hkl'') lattice planes is given by:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=4. Direct and reciprocal lattices |website=CSIC Dept de Cristalografia y Biologia Estructural |url= http://www.xtal.iqfr.csic.es/Cristalografia/parte_04-en.html |date=6 Apr 2017 |access-date=18 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cubic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac {h^2+k^2+l^2} {a^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Tetragonal:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac {h^2+k^2} {a^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Hexagonal:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{4}{3}\left(\frac{h^2+hk+k^2}{a^2}\right)+\frac{l^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Rhombohedral:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{(h^2+k^2+l^2)\sin^2\alpha+2(hk+kl+hl)(\cos^2\alpha-\cos\alpha)}{a^2(1-3\cos^2\alpha+2\cos^3\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt;
*Orthorhombic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{h^2}{a^2}+\frac{k^2}{b^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*Monoclinic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}=\left(\frac{h^2}{a^2}+\frac{k^2\sin^2\beta}{b^2}+\frac{l^2}{c^2}-\frac{2hl\cos\beta}{ac}\right) \csc^2\beta&lt;/math&gt;
*Triclinic:
*:&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {d^{2}}= \frac{\frac{h^2}{a^2}\sin^2\alpha+\frac{k^2}{b^2}\sin^2\beta+\frac{l^2}{c^2}\sin^2\gamma+\frac{2kl}{bc}\cos\alpha+\frac{2hl}{ac}\cos\beta+\frac{2hk}{ab}\cos\gamma}{1-\cos^2\alpha-\cos^2\beta-\cos^2\gamma+2\cos\alpha\cos\beta\cos\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

== Classification by symmetry ==
{{main|Crystal system}}
The defining property of a crystal is its inherent symmetry, by which we mean that under certain 'operations' the crystal remains unchanged. All crystals have translational symmetry in three directions, but some have other symmetry elements as well. For example, rotating the crystal 180° about a certain axis may result in an atomic configuration that is identical to the original configuration. The crystal is then said to have a twofold rotational symmetry about this axis. In addition to rotational symmetries like this, a crystal may have symmetries in the form of mirror planes and [[translational symmetries]], and also the so-called "compound symmetries," which are a combination of translation and rotation/mirror symmetries. A full classification of a crystal is achieved when all of these inherent symmetries of the crystal are identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ashcroft|first1=N.|author-link1=Neil Ashcroft|last2=Mermin|first2=D.|authorlink2=David Mermin|date=1976|title=Solid State Physics|publisher=Brooks/Cole (Thomson Learning, Inc.)|chapter=Chapter 7|isbn=978-0030493461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lattice systems ===
These [[lattice system]]s are a grouping of crystal structures according to the axial system used to describe their lattice. Each lattice system consists of a set of three axes in a particular geometric arrangement. There are seven lattice systems. They are similar to but not quite the same as the seven [[crystal system]]s.

{{clear}}
The simplest and most symmetric, the [[cubic (crystal system)|cubic]] (or isometric) system, has the symmetry of a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]], that is, it exhibits four threefold rotational axes oriented at 109.5° (the [[tetrahedral angle]]) with respect to each other. These threefold axes lie along the body diagonals of the cube. The other six lattice systems, are [[Hexagonal lattice system|hexagonal]], [[tetragonal]], [[rhombohedral lattice system|rhombohedral]] (often confused with the [[trigonal crystal system]]), [[orthorhombic]], [[monoclinic]] and [[triclinic]].

==== Bravais lattices ====
{{main|Bravais lattice}}
Bravais lattices, also referred to as ''space lattices'', describe the geometric arrangement of the lattice points,&lt;ref name="Physics 1991"/&gt; and therefore the translational symmetry of the crystal. The three dimensions of space afford 14 distinct Bravais lattices describing the translational symmetry. All crystalline materials recognized today, not including [[quasicrystal]]s, fit in one of these arrangements. The fourteen three-dimensional lattices, classified by lattice system, are shown above.

The crystal structure consists of the same group of atoms, the ''basis'', positioned around each and every lattice point. This group of atoms therefore repeats indefinitely in three dimensions according to the arrangement of one of the Bravais lattices. The characteristic rotation and mirror symmetries of the unit cell is described by its [[crystallographic point group]].

===Crystal systems===
A crystal system is a set of point groups in which the point groups themselves and their corresponding space groups are assigned to a lattice system. Of the 32 point groups that exist in three dimensions, most are assigned to only one lattice system, in which case the crystal system and lattice system both have the same name. However, five point groups are assigned to two lattice systems, rhombohedral and hexagonal, because both lattice systems exhibit threefold rotational symmetry. These point groups are assigned to the trigonal crystal system.

In total there are seven crystal systems: triclinic, monoclinic, orthorhombic, tetragonal, trigonal, hexagonal, and cubic.

==== Point groups ====
{{main|Crystallographic point group}}
The crystallographic point group or ''crystal class'' is the mathematical group comprising the symmetry operations that leave at least one point unmoved and that leave the appearance of the crystal structure unchanged. These symmetry operations include

*''Reflection'', which reflects the structure across a ''reflection plane''
*''Rotation'', which rotates the structure a specified portion of a circle about a ''rotation axis''
*''Inversion'', which changes the sign of the coordinate of each point with respect to a ''center of symmetry'' or ''inversion point''
*''[[Improper rotation]]'', which consists of a rotation about an axis followed by an inversion.

Rotation axes (proper and improper), reflection planes, and centers of symmetry are collectively called ''symmetry elements''. There are 32 possible crystal classes. Each one can be classified into one of the seven crystal systems.

=== Space groups ===
{{main|Space group}}
In addition to the operations of the point group, the space group of the crystal structure contains translational symmetry operations. These include:
*Pure ''translations'', which move a point along a vector
*''Screw axes'', which rotate a point around an axis while translating parallel to the axis.&lt;ref name=Sands&gt;
{{cite book |title=Introduction to Crystallography |author=Donald E. Sands |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h_A5u5sczJoC&amp;pg=PA71 |chapter=§4-2 Screw axes and §4-3 Glide planes |pages= 70–71 |isbn=978-0486678399 |publisher=Courier-Dover |year=1994 |edition=Reprint of WA Benjamin corrected 1975}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Glide planes'', which reflect a point through a plane while translating it parallel to the plane.&lt;ref name=Sands/&gt;

There are 230 distinct space groups.

== Atomic coordination ==
By considering the arrangement of atoms relative to each other, their coordination numbers (or number of nearest neighbors), interatomic distances, types of bonding, etc., it is possible to form a general view of the structures and alternative ways of visualizing them.&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"&gt;{{cite book|title=McGraw Hill Encyclopaedia of Physics |edition=2nd |editor1-first=C.B. |editor1-last=Parker |date=1994 |isbn=978-0070514003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Close packing ===
[[File:close packing.svg|thumb|right|341px|The hcp lattice (left) and the fcc lattice (right)]]
The principles involved can be understood by considering the most efficient way of packing together equal-sized spheres and stacking [[close-packed]] atomic planes in three dimensions. For example, if plane A lies beneath plane B, there are two possible ways of placing an additional atom on top of layer B. If an additional layer was placed directly over plane A, this would give rise to the following series:
:...'''ABABABAB'''...
This arrangement of atoms in a crystal structure is known as '''hexagonal close packing (hcp)'''.

If, however, all three planes are staggered relative to each other and it is not until the fourth layer is positioned directly over plane A that the sequence is repeated, then the following sequence arises:
:...'''ABCABCABC'''...
This type of structural arrangement is known as '''cubic close packing (ccp)'''.

The unit cell of a ccp arrangement of atoms is the face-centered cubic (fcc) unit cell. This is not immediately obvious as the closely packed layers are parallel to the {111} planes of the fcc unit cell. There are four different orientations of the close-packed layers.

The '''packing efficiency''' can be worked out by calculating the total volume of the spheres and dividing by the volume of the cell as follows:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{4 \times \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3}{16 \sqrt{2} r^3} = \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{2}} = 0.7405...&lt;/math&gt;

The 74% packing efficiency is the maximum density possible in unit cells constructed of spheres of only one size. Most crystalline forms of metallic elements are hcp, fcc, or bcc (body-centered cubic). The [[coordination number]] of atoms in hcp and fcc structures is 12 and its [[atomic packing factor]] (APF) is the number mentioned above, 0.74. This can be compared to the APF of a bcc structure, which is 0.68.

== Grain boundaries ==
Grain boundaries are interfaces where crystals of different orientations meet.&lt;ref name="Physics 1991"/&gt; A [[grain boundary]] is a single-phase interface, with crystals on each side of the boundary being identical except in orientation. The term "crystallite boundary" is sometimes, though rarely, used. Grain boundary areas contain those atoms that have been perturbed from their original lattice sites, [[dislocations]], and impurities that have migrated to the lower energy grain boundary.

Treating a grain boundary geometrically as an interface of a single crystal cut into two parts, one of which is rotated, we see that there are five variables required to define a grain boundary. The first two numbers come from the unit vector that specifies a rotation axis. The third number designates the angle of rotation of the grain. The final two numbers specify the plane of the grain boundary (or a unit vector that is normal to this plane).&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"/&gt;

Grain boundaries disrupt the motion of dislocations through a material, so reducing crystallite size is a common way to improve strength, as described by the [[Hall–Petch]] relationship. Since grain boundaries are defects in the crystal structure they tend to decrease the [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]] of the material. The high interfacial energy and relatively weak bonding in most grain boundaries often makes them preferred sites for the onset of corrosion and for the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of new phases from the solid. They are also important to many of the mechanisms of [[creep (deformation)|creep]].&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"/&gt;

Grain boundaries are in general only a few nanometers wide. In common materials, crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for a small fraction of the material. However, very small grain sizes are achievable. In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant volume fraction of the material, with profound effects on such properties as [[diffusion]] and [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]]. In the limit of small crystallites, as the volume fraction of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and thus becomes an [[amorphous solid]].&lt;ref name="Physics 1994"/&gt;

== Defects and impurities ==
Real crystals feature [[crystallographic defect|defects]] or irregularities in the ideal arrangements described above and it is these defects that critically determine many of the electrical and mechanical properties of real materials. When one atom substitutes for one of the principal atomic components within the crystal structure, alteration in the electrical and thermal properties of the material may ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nikola |last=Kallay |date=2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZXsBk20WO1sC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Interfacial Dynamics |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=978-0824700065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impurities may also manifest as spin impurities in certain materials. Research on magnetic impurities demonstrates that substantial alteration of certain properties such as specific heat may be affected by small concentrations of an impurity, as for example impurities in semiconducting [[ferromagnetic]] [[alloy]]s may lead to different properties as first predicted in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.188.870|title = Density of States of an Insulating Ferromagnetic Alloy|year = 1969|author = Hogan, C.

== Prediction of structure ==
{{Main| Crystal structure prediction}}
[[File:Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png|thumb|Crystal structure of sodium chloride (table salt)]]
The difficulty of predicting stable crystal structures based on the knowledge of only the chemical composition has long been a stumbling block on the way to fully computational materials design. Now, with more powerful algorithms and high-performance computing, structures of medium complexity can be predicted using such approaches as [[evolutionary algorithms]], random sampling, or metadynamics.

The crystal structures of simple ionic solids (e.g., NaCl or table salt) have long been rationalized in terms of [[Pauling's rules]], first set out in 1929 by [[Linus Pauling]], referred to by many since as the "father of the chemical bond".&lt;ref name="Paulingsrules"&gt;{{cite journal|author= [[Linus Pauling|L. Pauling]]|year = 1929|title = The principles determining the structure of complex ionic crystals|journal = [[J. Am. Chem. Soc.]]|volume = 51|issue = 4|pages= 1010–1026|doi= 10.1021/ja01379a006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pauling also considered the nature of the interatomic forces in metals, and concluded that about half of the five d-orbitals in the transition metals are involved in bonding, with the remaining nonbonding d-orbitals being responsible for the magnetic properties. He, therefore, was able to correlate the number of d-orbitals in bond formation with the bond length as well as many of the physical properties of the substance. He subsequently introduced the metallic orbital, an extra orbital necessary to permit uninhibited resonance of valence bonds among various electronic structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.54.899|title=The Nature of the Interatomic Forces in Metals|year=1938|last1=Pauling|first1=Linus|journal=Physical Review|volume=54|issue=11|pages=899-904|bibcode = 1938PhRv...54..899P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[resonating valence bond theory]], the factors that determine the choice of one from among alternative crystal structures of a metal or intermetallic compound revolve around the energy of resonance of bonds among interatomic positions. It is clear that some modes of resonance would make larger contributions (be more mechanically stable than others), and that in particular a simple ratio of number of bonds to number of positions would be exceptional. The resulting principle is that a special stability is associated with the simplest ratios or "bond numbers": {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|1|3}}, {{frac|2|3}}, {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|3|4}}, etc. The choice of structure and the value of the [[axial ratio]] (which determines the relative bond lengths) are thus a result of the effort of an atom to use its valency in the formation of stable bonds with simple fractional bond numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja01195a024|year=1947|last1=Pauling|first1=Linus|title=Atomic Radii and Interatomic Distances in Metals|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=69|issue=3|pages=542-553}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1949.0032|title=A Resonating-Valence-Bond Theory of Metals and Intermetallic Compounds|year=1949|last1=Pauling|first1=L.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|volume=196|issue=1046|pages=343-362|bibcode = 1949RSPSA.196..343P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After postulating a direct correlation between electron concentration and crystal structure in beta-phase alloys, [[Hume-Rothery]] analyzed the trends in melting points, compressibilities and bond lengths as a function of group number in the periodic table in order to establish a system of valencies of the transition elements in the metallic state. This treatment thus emphasized the increasing bond strength as a function of group number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1951.0172|title=The Valencies of the Transition Elements in the Metallic State|year=1951|last1=Hume-rothery|first1=W.|first2=H. M.|first3=R. J. P.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]|volume=208|issue=1095|pages=431|last2=Irving|last3=Williams|bibcode = 1951RSPSA.208..431H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation of directional forces were emphasized in one article on the relation between bond hybrids and the metallic structures. The resulting correlation between electronic and crystalline structures is summarized by a single parameter, the weight of the d-electrons per hybridized metallic orbital. The "d-weight" calculates out to 0.5, 0.7 and 0.9 for the fcc, hcp and bcc structures respectively. The relationship between d-electrons and crystal structure thus becomes apparent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1098/rspa.1957.0073|title=On the Relation between Bond Hybrids and the Metallic Structures|year=1957|last1=Altmann|first1=S. L.|first2=C. A.|first3=W.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]]| volume=240| issue=1221| pages=145| last2=Coulson| last3=Hume-Rothery| bibcode = 1957RSPSA.240..145A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In crystal structure predictions/simulations, the periodicity is usually applied, since the system is imagined as unlimited big in all directions. Starting from a triclinic structure with no further symmetry property assumed, the system may be driven to show some additional symmetry properties by applying Newton's Second Law on particles in the unit cell and a recently developed dynamical equation for the system period vectors
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1139/cjp-2014-0518|title=Dynamical equations for the period vectors in a periodic system under constant external stress|year=2015|last1=Liu|first1=Gang|journal=[[Can. J. Phys.]]| volume=93| issue=9| pages=974-978|bibcode = 2015CaJPh..93..974L |arxiv=cond-mat/0209372}}&lt;/ref&gt; (lattice parameters including angles), even if the system is subject to external stress.

== Polymorphism ==
[[File:Quartz, Tibet.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Quartz]] is one of the several [[crystalline]] forms of [[silica]], SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The most important forms of silica include: [[quartz|α-quartz]], [[quartz|β-quartz]], [[tridymite]], [[cristobalite]], [[coesite]], and [[stishovite]].]]
[[Polymorphism (materials science)|Polymorphism]] is the occurrence of multiple crystalline forms of a material. It is found in many crystalline materials including [[polymer]]s, [[mineral]]s, and [[metal]]s.  According to Gibbs' rules of phase equilibria, these unique crystalline phases are dependent on intensive variables such as pressure and temperature.  Polymorphism is related to [[allotropy]], which refers to [[chemical elements|elemental solids]]. The complete morphology of a material is described by polymorphism and other variables such as [[crystal habit]], [[Amorphous solid|amorphous fraction]] or [[crystallographic defect]]s. Polymorphs have different stabilities and may spontaneously convert from a metastable form (or thermodynamically unstable form) to the [[stable]] form at a particular temperature. They also exhibit different [[melting points]], solubilities, and [[X-ray diffraction]] patterns.

One good example of this is the [[quartz]] form of [[silicon dioxide]], or SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In the vast majority of [[silicates]], the Si atom shows tetrahedral coordination by 4 oxygens. All but one of the crystalline forms involve tetrahedral {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} units linked together by shared vertices in different arrangements. In different minerals the tetrahedra show different degrees of networking and polymerization. For example, they occur singly, joined together in pairs, in larger finite clusters including rings, in chains, double chains, sheets, and three-dimensional frameworks. The minerals are classified into groups based on these structures. In each of the 7 thermodynamically stable crystalline forms or polymorphs of crystalline quartz, only 2 out of 4 of each the edges of the {SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;} tetrahedra are shared with others, yielding the net chemical formula for silica: SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Another example is elemental [[tin]] (Sn), which is malleable near ambient temperatures but is [[brittle]] when cooled. This change in mechanical properties due to existence of its two major [[allotrope]]s, α- and β-tin. The two [[allotrope]]s that are encountered at normal pressure and temperature, α-tin and β-tin, are more commonly known as ''gray tin'' and ''white tin'' respectively. Two more allotropes, γ and σ, exist at temperatures above 161&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures above several GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first = A. M.|last = Molodets|author2=Nabatov, S. S.|title = Thermodynamic Potentials, Diagram of State, and Phase Transitions of Tin on Shock Compression|journal = High Temperature|volume = 38|issue = 5|year = 2000|pages = 715–721|doi = 10.1007/BF02755923}}&lt;/ref&gt; White tin is metallic, and is the stable crystalline form at or above room temperature. Below 13.2&amp;nbsp;°C, tin exists in the gray form, which has a [[diamond cubic]] crystal structure, similar to [[diamond]], [[silicon]] or [[germanium]]. Gray tin has no metallic properties at all, is a dull gray powdery material, and has few uses, other than a few specialized [[semiconductor]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|year = 1985|edition = 91–100|issue = |pages = 793–800|isbn = 978-3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|first = Arnold F.|last = Holleman |author2=Wiberg, Egon |author3=Wiberg, Nils|chapter = Tin| language = German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the α–β transformation temperature of tin is nominally 13.2&amp;nbsp;°C, impurities (e.g. Al, Zn, etc.) lower the transition temperature well below 0&amp;nbsp;°C, and upon addition of Sb or Bi the transformation may not occur at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Mel|last = Schwartz |title = Encyclopedia of Materials, Parts and Finishes|edition = 2nd|chapter = Tin and Alloys, Properties|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2002|isbn= 978-1-56676-661-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical properties ==
Twenty of the 32 crystal classes are [[piezoelectric]], and crystals belonging to one of these classes (point groups) display [[piezoelectricity]]. All piezoelectric classes lack a center of symmetry. Any material develops a [[dielectric]] polarization when an electric field is applied, but a substance that has such a natural charge separation even in the absence of a field is called a polar material. Whether or not a material is polar is determined solely by its crystal structure. Only 10 of the 32 point groups are [[polar point group|polar]]. All polar crystals are [[pyroelectric]], so the 10 polar crystal classes are sometimes referred to as the pyroelectric classes.

There are a few crystal structures, notably the [[Perovskite (structure)|perovskite structure]], which exhibit [[ferroelectric]] behavior. This is analogous to [[ferromagnetism]], in that, in the absence of an electric field during production, the ferroelectric crystal does not exhibit a polarization. Upon the application of an electric field of sufficient magnitude, the crystal becomes permanently polarized. This polarization can be reversed by a sufficiently large counter-charge, in the same way that a ferromagnet can be reversed. However, although they are called ferroelectrics, the effect is due to the crystal structure (not the presence of a ferrous metal).

A '''design review''' is a milestone within a [[product development]] process whereby a [[design]] is evaluated against its [[requirements analysis|requirements]] in order to verify the outcomes of previous activities and identify issues before committing to - and if need to be re-prioritise - further work. The ultimate design review, if successful, therefore triggers the product launch or product release.

The conduct of design reviews is compulsory as part of [[design controls]], when developing products in certain regulated contexts such as [[medical devices]].

By definition, a review must include persons who are external to the design team.

==Contents of a design review==
In order to evaluate a [[design]] against its requirements, a number of means may be considered, such as:
*Physical tests.
*Engineering simulations.
*Examinations (Walk-through).

==Timing of design reviews==
Most formalised [[systems engineering process]]es recognise that the cost of correcting a fault increases as it progresses through the [[Systems Development Life Cycle|development process]].  Additional effort spent in the early stages of development to discover and correct errors is therefore likely to be worthwhile.  Design reviews are example of such an effort.
Therefore, a number of design reviews may be carried out, for example to evaluate the design against different sets of criteria (consistency, [[usability]], ease of [[language localisation|localisation]], environmental) or during various stages of the design process.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2007}}
'''Disembowelment''' or '''evisceration''' is the removal of some or all of the [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] (the [[bowels]], or viscera), usually through a horizontal incision made across the [[Abdomen|abdominal]] area.  Disembowelment may result from an accident but has also been used as a method of [[torture]] and [[execution]].  In such practices, disembowelment may be accompanied by other forms of torture, or the removal of other vital organs.

==Disembowelment as torture==
If a living creature is disemboweled, it is invariably fatal without major medical intervention.  Historically, disembowelment has been used as a severe form of [[capital punishment]].  If the intestinal tract alone is removed, death follows after several hours of gruesome pain. The victim will often be fully conscious while the torture is performed if the vital organs aren't damaged, and will be able to see their intestine being removed, but will eventually lose consciousness due to blood loss. However, in some forms of intentional disembowelment, decapitation or the removal of the [[heart]] and [[lung]]s would hasten the victim's death.

===Asia===
[[File:Seppuku-2.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ukiyo-e]]'' woodblock print of warrior about to perform ''[[seppuku]]'', from the [[Edo period]].]]

====Japan====
In [[Japan]], disembowelment played a central part as a method of execution or the ritualized [[suicide]] of a [[samurai]]. In killing themselves by this method, they were deemed to be free from the dishonor resulting from their crimes. The most common form of disembowelment was referred to in Japanese as ''[[seppuku]]'' (or, colloquially, ''hara-kiri''), literally "stomach cutting," involving two cuts across the abdomen, sometimes followed by pulling out one's own [[Viscus|viscera]]. The act of [[decapitation]] by a second (''kaishaku-nin'') was added to this ritual suicide in later times in order to shorten the suffering of the samurai or leader, an attempt at rendering the ritual more humane. Even later the knife was just a simple formality and the swordsman would decapitate before the subject could reach for it.  The commission of a crime or dishonorable act was only one of many reasons for the performance of seppuku; others included the atonement of cowardice, as a means of apology, or following the loss of a battle or the surrender of a [[Japanese castle|castle]].

====Vietnam====
Various accounts have asserted that during the [[Vietnam War]], members of the [[Viet Cong]] sometimes made calculated use of disembowelment as a means of [[psychological warfare]], to coerce and intimidate rural [[peasant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hubbel |first=John G. |title=The Blood-Red Hands of Ho Chi Minh |journal=Readers Digest |date= November 1968  |pages=61–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Off With Their Hands |journal=Newsweek |date=15 May 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peer De Silva, former head of the [[Saigon]] department of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), wrote that from as early as 1963, Viet Cong units were using disembowelment and other methods of mutilation as psychological warfare.&lt;ref name=desilva&gt;{{cite book |last=De Silva |first=Peer |title=Sub Rosa: The CIA and the Uses of Intelligence |year=1978 |publisher=Time Books |place=New York |isbn=0-8129-0745-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent, however, to which this punishment was perpetrated may be impossible to gauge and while detailed accounts survive regarding how civilians were disemboweled by Viet Cong, the use of this torture appears to have been quite arbitrary and there is no record that such actions were sanctioned by the [[North Vietnam]]ese government in [[Hanoi]]. Disembowelment and other methods of intimidation and torture were intended to frighten civilian peasants at a local level into cooperating with the Viet Cong or discourage them from cooperating with the [[South Vietnamese Army]] or its allies.&lt;ref name=desilva/&gt;

===Europe===

====Romania====
In early 1941, during the [[Legionnaires%27 rebellion and Bucharest pogrom#The Bucharest pogrom|Bucharest pogrom]] in which 125 [[Jewish]] civilians were killed, multiple cases of torture including disembowelment were recorded.&lt;ref name="Ancel"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ancel|first=Jean|title=History of the Holocaust – Romania |year=2002|publisher=[[Yad Vashem]]|location=[[Israel]]|isbn=965-308-157-8|language=he}} For details of the Pogrom itself, see volume I, pp. 363–400.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
On 10 July 1584, [[Balthasar Gérard]] shot and killed [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], who had advocated for [[Spanish Netherlands|Dutch independence]] from the [[Philip II of Spain|King of Spain]].&lt;ref name=jardine&gt;{{Cite book| author= [[Lisa Jardine|Jardine, Lisa]] |title= The Awful End of William the Silent: The First Assassination of A Head of State With A Handgun |place= London |publisher= HarperCollins |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-00-719257-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The assassin was interrogated and condemned to death almost immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Motley|first=John L.|title=The Rise of the Dutch Republic, Vol. 3|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/4836|authorlink=John Lothrop Motley|year=1856}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July, after suffering various tortures during each of the five days since the assassination, Gérard was disemboweled and [[dismembered]] while still alive, after which his heart was torn out and then he was beheaded by his Dutch executioners.&lt;ref name=jardine/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] |first =Michel |title=[[Discipline and Punish]] |chapter = The Spectacle of the scaffold. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Empire====
[[Christian]] tradition states that [[Erasmus of Formiae]], also known as Saint Elmo, was finally executed by disembowelment in about A.D. 303, after he had suffered extreme forms of torture during the persecutions of Emperor [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]].

====England====
[[File:BNMsFr2643FroissartFol97vExecHughDespenser.jpg|thumb|The execution of [[Hugh Despenser the Younger]], who was hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason in 1326]]
In [[England]], the punishment of being "[[hanged, drawn and quartered]]" was typically used for men convicted of [[high treason]]. This referred to the practice of dragging a man by a hurdle (similar to a fence) through the streets, removing him from the hurdle and (1) hanging him from the neck (but removing him before [[death]]), (2) drawing (i.e. disembowelling) him slowly on a wooden block by slitting open his abdomen, removing his [[entrail]]s and his other organs (which were frequently thrown on a fire), and then [[decapitation|decapitating]] him and (3) quartering, i.e. dividing the body into four pieces.  The man's head and quarters would often be [[parboiled]] and displayed as a [[Deterrence (legal)|warning]] to others. As part of the disembowelment, the man was also typically [[emasculation|emasculated]] and his genitals and entrails would be burned.

[[William Harrington (priest)|William Harrington]] is an example of someone tortured on the rack, [[Hanging|hanged]] until not quite dead, then subjected to disembowelment.&lt;ref name="Schama"&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Schama |title=Simon Schama's John Donne |date=26 May 2009 |publisher=BBC2 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctwo |accessdate=18 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
From the 15th century, ordinances are retained that threaten with a terrible punishment for those who stripped off the bark of a standing tree in the common woods. A typical wording is found in the 1401 ordinance from [[Oberursel (Taunus)|Oberursel]]:&lt;ref&gt;For a number of such ordinances, see * {{cite book|last=Grimm|first=Jacob|title=Deutsche Rechtsalterthümer

{{quote|"and whoever is caught stripping off a standing tree, mercy would have been more beneficial to him than the law is; for when law is to be fulfilled, then one is to cut up his stomach at the navel, and pull out a length of the gut. The gut is to be nailed to the tree, and one is keep going around that tree with the person, so long as he still has any part of the gut left in his body"}}
[[Jacob Grimm]] observes that no case of the punishment being carried out has been found in records from that period (15th century), but 300 to 500 years earlier, the [[West Slavs|Western Slavic]] tribes like the [[Wends]]  are said to have revenged themselves upon Christians by binding the guts to an erect pole and driving them around until the person was fully eviscerated.&lt;ref&gt;'''i)''' General comment, with connotations of this being a type of human sacrifice {{cite book|last=Hübner|first=Johann|title=Kurtze Fragen aus der politischen Historia, volume 6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9t4GAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA500|page=500|year=1703|publisher=Gleditsch|location=|accessdate=2013-03-13}}, '''ii)''' 8th century description from 772-73, {{cite book|last=Caesar|first=Aquilin Julius|title=Beschreibung des Herzogthum Steyermarks, Volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r4wAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA88|pages=88–89|year=1786|publisher=Zaunrith|location=Gräz|accessdate=2013-03-13}},  '''iii)''' Danish 1096 retaliation on Wends, by like execution method, {{cite book|last=Sell|first=Johann Jakob|title=Geschichte des Herzogthums Pommern, volume 1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iQcBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA88|pages=88–89|year=1819|publisher=Flittner|location=Berlin|accessdate=2013-03-13}}, '''iv)''' 1131 pagan attacks on Christians by Wends, {{cite book|last=Röper|first=Friedrich L.|title=Geschichte und Anekdoten von Dobberan in Mecklenburg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f30AAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA111|pages=111–13|year=1808|publisher=Self-published|location=Dobberan|accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 13th century, members of the now extinct Baltic ethnic group of [[Old Prussians]] in one of the battles against the [[Teutonic Knights]], are said to have captured one such knight in 1248, and made to undergo this punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Voigt|first=Johannes|title=Geschichte Preussens: Von den altesten Zeiten bis zum Untergange der Herrschaft des Deutschen Ordens.

[[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], a 15th-century [[Acolhua]]n ruler of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]], a member of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]] (now [[Mexico]]), promulgated a law code that was partially preserved. Those who had engaged in the passive role of homosexual anal intercourse had their intestines pulled out, then their bodies were filled with ash, and finally, were burnt.  The active or penetrating partner was simply [[Suffocation in ash|suffocated in a heap of ash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Täubel|first=Gottlob|title=Allgemeines Historienbuch von den Merkwurdigsten Entdeckungen fremder ehedem ganz unbekannter Länder und Inseln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KooM0KKNHr8C&amp;pg=RA1-PA207#v=onepage&amp;q=sodomiterey&amp;f=false|pages=206–07|year=1796|publisher=Gottlob Täubel|location=Vienna|accessdate=2013-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suicide==
The Japanese tradition of ''seppuku'' is a well known example of highly ritualized suicide, within a wider cultural world of norms and symbolism. However, reported examples of suicides exist, in which a person performed disembowelment on himself or herself, without any ambient culture of approved, or expected, suicide.

The Spartan king [[Cleomenes I]]  is reported, in a fit of madness, to have slit his stomach open, and ripped his own bowels out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lauremberg|first=Peter|title=Neue und vermehrte Acerra philologica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wcRCAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA985|page=985|year=1708|publisher=Johann A. Plener|location=Frankfurt and Leipzig|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman statesman [[Cato the Younger]] committed suicide in [[Utica, Tunisia|Utica]], after [[Cato_the_Younger#The_Civil_War|his side]] lost to [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]], by plunging a knife in his own gut, in the dead of night. According to [[Parallel Lives|Plutarch]], Cato's son heard the commotion from a nearby room, and called a doctor who stitched the wound close; after his son and the doctor left, Cato tore the stitching open with his hand and died. On account of his tragic, highly symbolic suicide, Cato is often termed ''Uticensis'' ("of Utica"), in order to differentiate him from his homonymous ancestor, [[Cato the Elder|Cato "the Elder" or "the Censor"]].

In 1593, a suicide occurred in [[Bad Wimpfen|Wimpfen]]. A young, pregnant woman, who had become a widow a few weeks before, was lying in her bed. She took a large knife, opened her belly in a cross, and threw out the fetus, her own intestines, and dug out her spleen and flung that out as well. She lived for 10 hours after the act, and when the priests sought to bring her a final consolation and blessing, she said it would all be in vain, because she was a daughter of the devil, and was beyond any sort of redemption. Then, she died, was put in a sack and thrown in the river. She was affluent, so it was clear that poverty had not driven her to this act.&lt;ref&gt;Forty years earlier, in 1555 Seidenberg (nowadays [[Zawidow]]), a woman who had become pregnant by another man than her (absent) husband sought to preserve her honour by cutting out the fetus. Having pulled it out, along with much else, she began screaming of pain, but no one could help her, and she died three days later. {{cite book|last=Döpler|first=Jacob|title=Theatrum Poenarum, volume 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LZlBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA313|pages=313–14|year=1697|publisher=Friedrich Lanckischen Erben|location=Leipzig|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1617, a merchant in the municipality Grossglockau&lt;ref&gt;For status as municipality, see:{{cite book|last=Janssen|first=Johannes|title=History of the German People at the Close of the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N509AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA336|page=336|year=1896|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=London|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; slit up his abdomen so that the intestines fell out; he then pulled out his stomach and threw it on the bed. The chronicler notes he lived long enough to regret his action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khevenhüller|first=Franz C.|title=Annales Ferdinandei, volume 7-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnFZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT138|page=column 1158|year=1723|publisher=M.G. Weidmann|location=Leipzig|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transanal evisceration==
When a portion of the intestinal tract is forcefully pulled from or expelled from the body through the anus, it is referred to as ''transanal evisceration''. Following the first report of transanal small intestine evisceration by Brodie in 1827, more than 70 cases have been reported to date, the majority occurring spontaneously in elderly individuals. Straining, chronic constipation, and rectal ulcerations predispose to spontaneous perforation in elderly individuals.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Medappil|first1=Noushif|title=Blunt abdominal trauma with transanal small bowel evisceration|journal=J Emerg Trauma Shock|date=Jan–Mar 2013|volume=6|issue=1|pages=56–57|doi=10.4103/0974-2700.106328|pmid=23493429|pmc=3589862}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cases of transanal evisceration of children whilst sitting over uncovered [[swimming pool]] drains have been reported; notable cases include Valerie Lakey (1993) and [[Death of Abigail Taylor|Abigail Taylor]] (2007).  In Taylor's case, the suction dislodged and damaged her liver and pancreas; several meters of her small intestine were forcefully pulled through her anus.  In both these cases, the victims were left with [[short bowel syndrome]] and required feeding by total [[parenteral nutrition]]. After multiple operations, Taylor later died from transplant-related cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/13626279/detail.html |title=Wading Pool Drain Sucks Out Girl's Organ |date=5 Jul 2007 |work=WSB Atlanta |accessdate=28 June 2011 |location=MINNEAPOLIS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629124327/http://www.wsbtv.com/news/13626279/detail.html |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wral.com/news/local/story/160648/ |title=Family Reaches Settlement that Guarantees $25 Million Payment |date=January 14, 1997 |work=[[WRAL-TV]] |accessdate=29 October 2010 |location=RALEIGH}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A person, usually a child, can suffer a similar injury if a heavy weight is applied directly over the abdomen. Large intestine (Rectosigmoid) rupture with transanal evisceration has been reported from blunt abdominal trauma and suction injuries. A direct blow or impingement of intestine between the vertebrae and anterior abdominal wall results in sudden increase in the intra-abdominal or intraluminal pressure of the intestine and rupture.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; The downward pressure forces a portion of the intestine to burst from the anus.

===Cultural references===
The short story "[[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)#"Guts"|Guts]]" from the book ''[[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)|Haunted]]'' by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] is based on the concept of transanal evisceration.

In Japanese folklore, it was believed that malicious ''[[Kappa (folklore)|Kappa]]''{{spaced ndash}}water-goblins that inhabited ponds and rivers{{spaced ndash}}might thrust a hand into the anus of a human swimmer, seeking a mythical sphere called a ''shirikodama''.

In American Horror Story: Roanoke (2016), Cricket is disemboweled by The Butcher (Thomyson White)

In the video game [[Fallout: New Vegas]], if the character Arcade Gannon is sold into slavery, during the ending slideshow he narrates how, during an unguarded moment, he used a [[Scalpel|medical scalpel]] to disembowel himself.

==Embalming==
The process of [[embalming]] sometimes includes removing the internal organs. [[Mummy|Mummification]], especially as practised by the [[ancient Egypt]]ians, entailed the removal of the internal organs prior to the preservation of the remainder of the body.  The organs removed were embalmed, stored in [[canopic jars]] and then placed in the tomb with the body.

James Cook, on his second voyage, noted an embalming custom on some of the Pacific islands his crew visited, a custom utilizing transanal evisceration:&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|last=Potts|first=James|title=The Hibernian Magazine, Or, Compendium of Entertaining Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbkRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA693|year=1784|publisher=James Potts|location=Dublin|page=693, col 2|accessdate=2013-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|We found the body not only entire in every part; but, what surprised us much more, was, that putrefaction had scarcely begun (...); though the climate is one of the hottest, and Tee had been dead above five months.(...) Such were Mr. [[William Anderson (naturalist)|Anderson]]'s remarks to me, who also told me, on his enquiring inte the method of effecting this preservation of their dead bodies, he had been informed, that, soon after their death, they are disemboweled, by drawing their intestines, and other viscera, out at the anus; and the whole cavity is then filled or stuffed with cloth; introduced through the same part(...)}}

== Relationship prevalence==
===General===
The ''Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention'' states, "For several methodological reasons&amp;nbsp;– nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others&amp;nbsp;– it is not possible to assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between gay male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association."&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Bonnie S. Fisher, Steven P. Lab| title = Encyclopedia of Gender and Society, Volume 1| publisher =[[Sage Publications|SAGE]]|year = 2010|page=312|accessdate = August 19, 2014| isbn = 1412960479 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=8kHrWPLLX54C&amp;pg=PA312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay males and lesbians===
{{further information|Domestic violence#Same-sex relationships|Domestic violence in lesbian relationships}}
Some sources state that [[Human male sexuality|gay]] and [[lesbian]] couples experience domestic violence at the same frequency as [[heterosexual]] couples,&lt;ref name="Karmen"&gt;{{cite book| author=Andrew Karmen| title = Crime Victims: An Introduction to Victimology| publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2010|page=255|accessdate = August 19, 2014| isbn = 0495599298 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=yb4Nkeks15AC&amp;pg=PA255}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other sources state domestic violence among gay, lesbian, and [[bisexual]] individuals might be higher than among heterosexual individuals, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are less likely to report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that lesbian couples experience domestic violence less than heterosexual couples do.&lt;ref name="Hampton"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Robert L. Hampton, Thomas P. Gullotta| title = Interpersonal Violence in the African-American Community: Evidence-Based Prevention and Treatment Practices| publisher =[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|year = 2010|page=49|accessdate = August 19, 2014| isbn = 0387295984 |url =https://books.google.com/books?id=IAG1R-ZMmkYC&amp;pg=PA49}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.&lt;ref name="Fisher"/&gt; According to a 2012 report from the National Coalition of Anti-Violence Programs (NCAVP) of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, and HIV-Affected Intimate Partner Violence Gay men were more likely to require medical attention and suffer injuries as a result of IPV. Gay men were close to two times (1.7) more likely to require medical attention and 16 times more likely to suffer injury as compared to individuals who did not identify as gay men.&lt;ref&gt; "Who is Doing What to Whom? Determining the Core Aggressor in Relationships Where Domestic Violence Exists." National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. https://www.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/who_is_doing_what_to_whom.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 review of the literature found that rates of domestic violence among same-sex couples are similar to or greater than opposite-sexed couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stiles-Shields |first1=C |last2=Carroll |first2=RA |title=Same-Sex Domestic Violence: Prevalence, Unique Aspects, and Clinical Implications. |journal=Journal of sex &amp; marital therapy |date=2015 |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=636-48 |doi=10.1080/0092623X.2014.958792 |pmid=25189218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In a 2010 [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) study, reporting on domestic violence in the U.S., 26% of gay men said that they experienced [[physical violence]], [[stalking]], or [[rape]] by their partners.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Walters, Mikel L., Jieru Chen, and Matthew J. Breiding. "The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 findings on victimization by sexual orientation." Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 648, no. 73 (2013): 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 29% of heterosexual men reported similar violence in the same study.

The CDC also stated that 40% of lesbian women reported physical violence by their partners, and 44% reported experiencing physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners. In contrast, 35% of heterosexual women reported physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners in the same study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) among same-gender female couples, researchers found that internalized homophobia and discrimination were correlated with IPV.&lt;ref&gt;[[cite url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-6402.2005.00220.x&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, research done on psychological aggression of lesbian relationships, researchers found that internalized homophobia and social constraints in talking with friends about sexual identity issues showed correlation with IPV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0361684313517866 | volume=38 | title=Sexual Minority Stressors and Psychological Aggression in Lesbian Women’s Intimate Relationships | year=2014 | journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly | pages=535–550 | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Robin J. | last2 = Milletich | first2 = Robert J. | last3 = Derlega | first3 = Valerian J. | last4 = Padilla | first4 = Miguel A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literature on intimate partner violence (IPV) among same-gender male couples, SES, attachment orientation, HIV status, and public outness, and internalized homophobia showed relationship with intimate partner violence in gay men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1891/0886-6708.23.3.344 | volume=23 | title=Correlates of Partner Abuse in Male Same-Sex Relationships | year=2008 | journal=Violence and Victims | pages=344–360 | last1 = Bartholomew | first1 = Kim | last2 = Regan | first2 = Katherine V. | last3 = Oram | first3 = Doug | last4 = White | first4 = Monica A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a study conducted on the predictors of IPA of gay men found a correlation between public outness, alcohol consumption, and internalized homophobia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10896-014-9620-7 | volume=29 | title=Predictors of Women’s Same-Sex Partner Violence Perpetration | year=2014 | journal=Journal of Family Violence | pages=653–664 | last1 = Milletich | first1 = Robert J. | last2 = Gumienny | first2 = Leslie A. | last3 = Kelley | first3 = Michelle L. | last4 = D'Lima | first4 = Gabrielle M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bisexual===
Although [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] people may be in relationships with people of any gender, they are often victims of domestic violence. The CDC reported that 61% of bisexual women said they experienced physical violence, stalking, or rape by their partners.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For men in the same study, 37% reported having experienced similar violence.

For both men and women, the percentage of bisexual people who have experienced domestic violence is higher than either gay men or lesbians. The high rate of domestic violence faced by bisexual people may be in part because of the [[Biphobia|specific challenges bisexual people face]] in receiving help, as bisexuality is often misunderstood, even by those who administer domestic violence help professionally.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===Transgender===
[[Transgender]] people may be in relationships with people of any gender, but they experience high rates of domestic violence. Comparatively, little research has been conducted on domestic violence towards transgender individuals, especially within the context of romantic relationships. In a 2009 United States study, 56% to 66% of transgender individuals reported experiencing violence within their homes, though not necessarily by a romantic partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stotzer | first1 = Rebecca L | year = 2009 | title = Violence against transgender people: A review of United States data | url = | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 170–179 | doi=10.1016/j.avb.2009.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences and factors ==

=== Legal issues ===
Members of same-sex relationships who face domestic violence often have issues accessing legal recourse, as domestic violence laws are often drafted in such a way as to only include different sex partnerships.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some are worried about being involved in the legal system because they are afraid they will be mistreated or dismissed due to their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Although often the abuser can still be arrested or tried for [[assault]] or similar crimes, not classifying the crime as domestic may change how it is dealt with in the court system and change how the victim is treated. Also, studies have shown that law enforcement officers do not treat domestic violence in same-sex relationships as seriously as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Victims of domestic violence in same sex relationships do have legal rights afforded to them in some U.S. states, whether or not they are married to their partner, although the requirements and protections vary by state.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Some of these rights include having a [[Injunction|civil protection order]] or [[restraining order]] placed on the abuser to keep them from stalking or harassing the victim.

Some cities and states in the U.S. are working to improve the legal situation for LGBT victims of domestic violence, through policy change and police training.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] the city has created an LGBT unit of their police department to combat [[Violence against LGBT people|homophobic violence]] and to deal with [[Transphobia|violence against transgender people]] by professionals who are also members of the [[LGBT community]].&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mpdc.dc.gov/page/lesbian-gay-bisexual-and-transgender-liaison-unit-lgbtlu|title=Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Liaison Unit (LGBTLU) {{!}} mpdc|website=mpdc.dc.gov|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/10/06/496404041/for-d-c-s-lgbt-community-a-police-liaison-who-can-relate|title=For D.C.'s LGBT Community, A Police Liaison Who Can Relate|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== HIV/AIDS ===
[[File:Minnesota AIDS Project - HIV Stigma Stops Here - Twin Cities Pride Parade (9180874836).jpg|thumb|People carry a banner promoting the end of HIV stigma at a [[Pride parade|Pride Parade]]]]

[[HIV/AIDS]] may create additional problems for those in violent relationships, financially, emotionally, and health wise, whether it is the perpetrator or the victim who is living with HIV or AIDS.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncavp.org/issues/DomesticViolence.aspx|title=NCAVP :: Issues :: Domestic Violence|website=www.ncavp.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specifically affects those in same-sex relationships because [[men who have sex with men]], no matter how they identity, are significantly more likely to have HIV or AIDS than others.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.avert.org/professionals/hiv-social-issues/key-affected-populations/men-sex-men|title=Men who have sex with men, HIV and AIDS {{!}} AVERT|website=www.avert.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those living with HIV are often financially dependent on their partners, making it more difficult to leave abusive relationships.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If it is the victim who has HIV or AIDS the abuser may take control of their finances in order to have even more control over their life.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; This issue is compounded by the fact that those living with HIV or AIDS may often become too sick to work and support themselves, and that even when they are able to work they often face [[discrimination]] in the workplace or in the hiring process, even though this is technically illegal under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|Americans with Disabilities Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/hiv-aids-and-employment-discrimination|title=HIV &amp; AIDS and Employment Discrimination {{!}} Human Rights Campaign|last=Campaign|first=Human Rights|website=Human Rights Campaign|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abusers may use emotional tactics to exert control over their partners, whether it is them or the victim who has HIV or AIDS.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Some abusive partners may threaten to reveal their partner's positive [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV status]] to others as a form of control, as there is a [[Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS|stigma surrounding HIV and AIDS]] that could affect a victim's life.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; If it is the abuser who has HIV or AIDS, the victim may fear that leaving someone who is sick makes them seem shallow, uncaring, or discriminatory, or the abuser may insinuate that if their partner leaves the relationship the abuser will become sicker as a result.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Oppositionally, if it is the victim who has HIV or AIDS, the abuser may imply that the victim will be unable to find another partner due to their positive HIV status or that they will die alone.The abuser may also claim that it is the victim's fault that the abuser has HIV or AIDS, essentially [[Emotional blackmail|emotionally blackmailing]] them to stay in the relationship.

There are many health related ways that HIV or AIDS can affect domestic violence in same-sex relationships.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Some perpetrators of domestic violence purposefully try to transmit [[Sexually transmitted infection|STDs]] to their partner or to transmit their partner's STD to themselves, as a tactic to control their partner. Additionally, many people in same-sex relationships who experienced domestic violence experienced violence specifically because they had asked their partners to use [[condom]]s or other [[prophylactics]], which are known to limit the spread of HIV.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; In conjunction with this, abusers may tamper with their partner's [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]] medications that prevent the spread of HIV, or may use the social [[Slut-shaming|stigma surrounding the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis]] to convince their partner not to use it.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Calabrese|first=Sarah K.|last2=Underhill|first2=Kristen|date=2016-10-26|title=How Stigma Surrounding the Use of HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis Undermines Prevention and Pleasure: A Call to Destigmatize "Truvada Whores"|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=105|issue=10|pages=1960–1964|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2015.302816|issn=0090-0036|pmc=4566537|pmid=26270298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=Tim|title=Mediated Intimacies: Raw Sex, Truvada, &amp; the Biopolitics of Chemoprophylaxis|url=https://www.academia.edu/19691468/Mediated_Intimacies_Raw_Sex_Truvada_and_the_Biopolitics_of_Chemoprophylaxis|journal=Sexualities|publication-date=February 2015|volume=18|pages=224–246|doi=10.1177/1363460715569137|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The abuser may also tamper with their partner's or their own [[Management of HIV/AIDS|HIV medication]], or keep their partner from receiving health care in other ways.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Furthermore, those with HIV or AIDS may be more affected by physical violence than those who are healthy, as their [[immune system]]s are weak and physical injuries will be harder to recover from. Those living with HIV or AIDS may also be more affected by [[emotional trauma]] for the same reason.

=== Homophobia ===
Homophobia plays a role in causing domestic violence in same-sex relationships as well as being a systemic issue as to why victims of same-sex domestic violence lack access to resources.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

One way this occurs is through the fear of being "[[Outing|outed]]," as abusers may use this fear of being outed to control their partners or an abuser may use the fact that they are not out to limit their partner's exposure to other LGBT people who would recognize that their relationship is unhealthy.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/administrative/domestic_violence1/publications/ABA_LGBT-rights_Final.authcheckdam.pdf|title=What Rights Do I Have As An LGBT Victim of Domestic Violence?|last=|first=|date=|website=www.americanbar.org|publisher=American Bar Association|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Another way homophobia plays a role in domestic violence is that people in same-sex relationships may feel that they have a duty to represent the LGBT community in a positive manner, and that if their relationship is abusive it is proof that homosexuality is inherently wrong, immoral, or otherwise flawed.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Further, the abuser may frame the abuse as justified because of the victim's [[Sexual orientation]], or imply that no one will help the victim because of their sexual orientation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehotline.org/is-this-abuse/lgbt-abuse/|title=The National Domestic Violence Hotline {{!}}   LGBTQ Abuse|website=www.thehotline.org|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a systematic level, many resources offered to victims of domestic violence are not offered to victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships. This refusal to help victims of same-sex domestic violence victims occurs both by private domestic violence help centers and by law enforcement, who may not treat same-sex domestic violence as seriously as domestic violence in heterosexual relationships.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Gendered expectations ===
Historically, domestic violence was viewed by many [[Feminism|feminists]] as "a manifestation of patriarchal power."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This definition saw domestic violence as a phenomenon acted out by men onto women, therefore leaving out [[Domestic violence against men|male victims of domestic violence]] and victims of domestic violence in same-sex relationships. Some abusers even capitalize on the idea that domestic violence cannot occur in same-sex relationships to convince their partner that the abuse is normal or non-abusive.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

One idea that persists and is harmful to lesbians, is that sexual assault is less serious or aggressive when perpetrated by women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, being sexually assaulted can be traumatic to victims regardless of the gender of the perpetrator. Similarly, women stalking other women or men seem as less threatening than the same actions being perpetrated by men, so lesbian victims of stalking may be ignored by law enforcement and other individuals.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Part of this problem that specifically impacts lesbians is that lesbians are assumed to have perfect relationships specifically because there is no man involved in the situation. This idea of a "lesbian utopia" makes it more difficult for lesbians to report domestic violence, because often people don't believe it can be true.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Gay men may feel that being battered is a threat to their [[masculinity]], and thus are hesitant to report domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Some abusers may frame the abuse as simply an "expression of masculinity," which normalizes the physical violence.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Data collection issues ===
There are several problems with data collection about domestic violence in same-sex relationships, including lack of reporting, biased sampling, and lack of interest in studying same-sex domestic violence.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, if samples are taken at a center that caters to LGBT individuals, the results may be unregularly high, as those who use these services may also be those in need of help, or unregularly low, as abusers often limit their partner's exposure to others, especially those who may recognize their relationship as abusive.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

[[File:Do not disturb.svg|right|thumb|150px|''Do not disturb'' door sign]]
A '''door hanger''' (also spelled '''''doorhanger''''' or '''''door-hanger''''') is a [[plastic]] or [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] sign, generally rectangular in shape, cut to hang from the handle or knob of a [[door]].   They are sometimes used to distribute print [[advertising]] to residences.  Door hangers are often seen in [[hotel]]s and other places of lodging as a means for guests to communicate with maintenance and housekeeping staff.

== Other meanings ==

In computer [[user interface]] design, a "doorhanger" notification is a sort of pop-up panel that "hangs" from another user interface element, typically an icon in the tool bar.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://bsdpower.com/modern-design-abominations-firefox-doorhanger-notifications/ here] for an example.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

One common place where do not disturb signs are used is in [[hotel|places of lodging]], where guests can place these signs on the door in order to inform staff, including [[Maid service|housekeeping]], to respect their [[privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/29/TRVA11DNES.DTL |title=As hotels squeeze cleaning staff, guests get caught in the middle. How to make sure your housekeeping needs get met |first=Christopher |last=Elliott |date=June 29, 2008 |publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some hotels also provide "make up room" signs giving the opposite instructions.

They are also used in schools to let other staff members and students at the school know that testing is in progress in the particular classroom.

Do not disturb signs can also be used by those who keep valuables in their rooms in order to deter possible thieves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVoVKSXBTzwC&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22do+not+disturb+sign%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html |title=Importers manual USA. |volume=4 |author1=Edward G. Hinkelman |author2=Myron Manley |author3=James L. Nolan |author4=Karla C. Shippey |author5=Wendy Bidwell |author6=Alexandra Woznick |page=46 |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems ==
In multiple cases, a ''do not disturb'' sign on the door of a hotel room has been blamed for concealing a [[homicide]], suspicious death, or other [[criminal activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-06-26-3285533780_x.htm |title=Warrant: Body of pregnant soldier found in tub |first=Kevin |last=Maurer |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/104279/Hotel-do-not-disturb-sign-hid-murder |title=Hotel 'Do not Disturb' sign hid murder |publisher=Express.co.uk |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.startribune.com/local/18730289.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120910134044/http://www.startribune.com/local/18730289.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 September 2012 |title=Hotel 'do not disturb' sign hid murder |date=30 May 2009 |first=Chris |last=Riches |publisher=[[Star Tribune]] |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a ''do not disturb'' sign was blamed for concealing the disappearance of an elderly couple on a cruise ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/01/17/national/main4730518.shtml |title=Elderly Couple Disappears On Cruise Ship |date=January 17, 2009 |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, mass murderer [[Stephen Paddock]] kept a "do not disturb" sign on his hotel room door, concealing ten suitcases with a stockpile of rifles and ammunition he used to commit the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]].

[[File:Electronic Do Not Disturb Sign as seen at Loews Miami Beach Hotel.jpg|thumb|alt=A Electronic Do Not Disturb|An electronic "do not disturb" indicator (the illuminated red lamp is a signal to hotel staff).]]
Some hotels are using high-tech means to replace paper do not disturb signs that hang on the door. One example is a privacy button that one can press from within the room to light up an indicator outside the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/05/09/1210131215154.html |title=From hotel rooms to hi-tech havens |date=May 9, 23008 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising ==
More recently, hotels have used the do not disturb signs as a way to brand themselves and provide inexpensive advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/news_travel_story_skin/476263?format=html |title=Catching ZZZZZZZZs a sign of the times |date=26 February 2005 |publisher=tvnz.co.nz |accessdate=2 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.projo.com/travel/content/projo_20050227_shush27x.1de18b8.html |title=Genius works behind 'do not disturb' sign |date=27 February 2005 |first=Amanda |last=Kingsbury |publisher=projo.com |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Embassy Suites]] ran a contest allowing the public to design do not disturb signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap_travel/20070917/ap_tr_ge/travel_brief_do_not_disturb |title= Make your own 'Do Not Disturb' sign|publisher=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner was announced in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotelchatter.com/story/2008/2/18/102222/497/hotels/The_Disturbing_Results_of_Embassy_Suites_Do_Not_Disturb_Sign_Contest |title=The disturbin results of Embassy Suites 'Do Not Disturb' sign |publisher=hotelchatter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Door Hangers are also used in competition with direct mail as an advertising vehicle. Most recently, companies providing this type of advertising have been using the term Direct to Door Advertising. This type of advertising offers a number of advantages over traditional direct mail in that the impression is "guaranteed". The home owner must handle the piece and typically on a door hanger there is just one advertising message giving the advertiser great exposure.&lt;ref&gt;http://marketing.allovermedia.com/door-hanger-infographic&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of advertising is used by national brands and local companies to help drive traffic into their stores, increase trial by offering a sample, and to increase their brand awareness. This method of delivery can often be more cost effective and with today's technology, the delivery of the pieces is completely trackable by integrating GPS and photos into the Proof of Performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aapsinc.org/members-only-section/doorhangers-are-simply-better/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710220458/http://aapsinc.org/members-only-section/doorhangers-are-simply-better/ |archivedate=2015-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DINISO2768-2example.jpg|thumb|Example for the DIN ISO 2768-2 tolerance table. This is just one example for linear tolerances for a 100mm value. This is just one of the 8 defined ranges (30-120 mm).]]
'''Engineering tolerance'''  is the permissible limit or limits of variation in:
# a physical [[dimension]];
# a measured value or [[physical property]] of a material, [[manufacturing|manufactured]] object, system, or service;
# other measured values (such as temperature, humidity, etc.);
# in [[engineering]] and [[safety]], a physical [[distance]] or space (tolerance), as in a [[truck]] (lorry), [[train]] or [[boat]] under a [[bridge]] as well as a train in a [[tunnel]] (see [[structure gauge]] and [[loading gauge]]);
# in [[mechanical engineering]] the [[Engineering tolerance#Mechanical component tolerance|space]] between a [[Screw|bolt]] and a [[Nut (hardware)|nut]] or a hole, etc..
Dimensions, properties, or conditions may have some variation without significantly affecting functioning of systems, machines, structures, etc.
A variation beyond the tolerance (for example, a temperature that is too hot or too cold) is said to be noncompliant, rejected, or exceeding the tolerance.

==Considerations when setting tolerances==
A primary concern is to determine how wide the tolerances may be without affecting other factors or the outcome of a process.  This can be by the use of scientific principles, engineering knowledge, and professional experience. Experimental investigation is very useful to investigate the effects of tolerances: [[Design of experiments]], formal engineering evaluations, etc.

A good set of engineering tolerances in a [[specification]], by itself, does not imply that compliance with those tolerances will be achieved.  Actual production of any product (or operation of any system) involves some inherent variation of input and output. Measurement error and statistical uncertainty are also present in all measurements.  With a [[normal distribution]], the tails of measured values may extend well beyond plus and minus three standard deviations from the process average. Appreciable portions of one (or both) tails might extend beyond the specified tolerance.

The [[process capability]] of systems, materials, and products needs to be compatible with the specified engineering tolerances. [[Process control]]s must be in place and an effective [[Quality management system]], such as [[Total Quality Management]], needs to keep actual production within the desired tolerances. A [[process capability index]] is used to indicate the relationship between tolerances and actual measured production.

The choice of tolerances is also affected by the intended statistical [[sampling plan]] and its characteristics such as the Acceptable Quality Level. This relates to the question of whether tolerances must be extremely rigid (high confidence in 100% conformance) or whether some small percentage of being out-of-tolerance may sometimes be acceptable.

==An alternative view of tolerances==
[[Genichi Taguchi]] and others have suggested that traditional two-sided tolerancing is analogous to "goal posts" in a [[Football (disambiguation)|football game]]: It implies that all data within those tolerances are equally acceptable.  The alternative is that the best product has a measurement which is precisely on target. There is an increasing loss which is a function of the deviation or variability from the target value of any design parameter. The greater the deviation from target, the greater is the loss. This is described as the [[Taguchi loss function]] or "quality loss function", and it is the key principle of an alternative system called "inertial tolerancing".

Research and development work conducted by M. Pillet and colleagues&lt;ref&gt;Pillet M., Adragna P-A., Germain F., Inertial Tolerancing: "The Sorting Problem", Journal of Machine Engineering : Manufacturing Accuracy Increasing Problems, optimization, Vol. 6, No. 1, 2006, pp. 95-102.&lt;/ref&gt; at the Savoy University has resulted in industry-specific adoption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblion.epfl.ch/EPFL/theses/2007/3825/3825_abs.pdf Thesis Quality Control and Inertial Tolerancing in the watchmaking industry, in french]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently the publishing of the French standard NFX 04-008 has allowed further consideration by the manufacturing community.

== Mechanical component tolerance ==
[[File:Mechanical Tolerance Definitions.svg|thumb|Summary of basic size, fundamental deviation and IT grades compared to minimum and maximum sizes of the shaft and hole.]]

Dimensional tolerance is related to, but different from [[Engineering fit|fit]] in mechanical engineering, which is a ''designed-in'' clearance or interference between two parts. Tolerances are assigned to parts for manufacturing purposes, as boundaries for acceptable build. No machine can hold dimensions precisely to the nominal value, so there must be acceptable degrees of variation. If a part is manufactured, but has dimensions that are out of tolerance, it is not a usable part according to the design intent. Tolerances can be applied to any dimension. The commonly used terms are:

* '''Basic size''': the nominal diameter of the shaft (or bolt) and the hole. This is, in general, the same for both components.
* '''Lower deviation''': the difference between the minimum possible component size and the basic size  .
* '''Upper deviation''': the difference between the maximum possible component size and the basic size  .
* '''Fundamental deviation''': the ''minimum'' difference in size between a component and the basic size. This is identical to the upper deviation for shafts and the lower deviation for holes.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} If the fundamental deviation is greater than zero, the bolt will always be smaller than the basic size and the hole will always be wider. Fundamental deviation is a form of [[allowance (engineering)|allowance]], rather than tolerance.
* '''International Tolerance grade''': this is a standardised measure of the ''maximum'' difference in size between the component and the basic size (see below).

For example, if a shaft with a nominal diameter of 10 [[millimeter|mm]] is to have a sliding fit within a hole, the shaft might be specified with a tolerance range from 9.964 to 10&amp;nbsp;mm (i.e. a zero fundamental deviation, but a lower deviation of 0.036&amp;nbsp;mm) and the hole might be specified with a tolerance range from 10.04&amp;nbsp;mm to 10.076&amp;nbsp;mm (0.04&amp;nbsp;mm fundamental deviation and 0.076&amp;nbsp;mm upper deviation). This would provide a clearance fit of somewhere between 0.04&amp;nbsp;mm (largest shaft paired with the smallest hole, called the "maximum material condition") and 0.112&amp;nbsp;mm (smallest shaft paired with the largest hole). In this case the size of the tolerance range for both the shaft and hole is chosen to be the same (0.036&amp;nbsp;mm), meaning that both components have the same International Tolerance grade but this need not be the case in general.

When no other tolerances are provided, the [[machining industry]] uses the following '''standard tolerances''':&lt;ref&gt;2, 3 and 4 decimal places quoted from page 29 of "Machine Tool Practices", 6th edition, by R.R.;&amp;nbsp;Kibbe, J.E.;&amp;nbsp;Neely, R.O.;&amp;nbsp;Meyer &amp; W.T.;&amp;nbsp;White, {{ISBN|0-13-270232-0}}, 2nd printing, copyright 1999, 1995, 1991, 1987, 1982 and 1979 by Prentice Hall.&lt;br&gt;(All four places, including the single decimal place, are common knowledge in the field, although a reference for the single place could not be found.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Chris McCauley, Editor-In-Chief of Industrial Press' [[Machinery's Handbook]]: '''Standard Tolerance''' "...''does not appear to originate with any of the recent editions (24-28) of [[Machinery's Handbook]], although those tolerances may have been mentioned somewhere in one of the many old editions of the Handbook.''"

===International Tolerance grades===
{{main|IT Grade}}
When designing mechanical components, a system of standardized tolerances called '''International Tolerance grades''' are often used. The standard (size) tolerances are divided into two categories: hole and shaft. They are labelled with a letter (capitals for holes and lowercase for shafts) and a number. For example: H7 (hole, [[Tap and die#Machine tapping|tapped hole]], or [[Nut (hardware)|nut]]) and h7 (shaft or bolt). H7/h6 is a very common standard tolerance which gives a tight fit. The tolerances work in such a way that for a hole H7 means that the hole should be made slightly larger than the base dimension (in this case for an ISO fit 10+0.015−0, meaning that it may be up to 0.015&amp;nbsp;mm larger than the base dimension, and 0&amp;nbsp;mm smaller). The actual amount bigger/smaller depends on the base dimension. For a shaft of the same size h6 would mean 10+0-0.009, which means the shaft may be as small as 0.009&amp;nbsp;mm smaller than the base dimension and 0&amp;nbsp;mm larger. This method of standard tolerances is also known as Limits and Fits and can be found in [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=45975&amp;ICS1=17&amp;ICS2=40&amp;ICS3=10 ISO 286-1:2010 (Link to ISO catalog)].

The table below summarises the International Tolerance (IT) grades and the general applications of these grades:
{{IT grades}}

An analysis of fit by [[Statistical interference]] is also extremely useful: It indicates the frequency (or probability) of parts properly fitting together.

== Electrical component tolerance ==
An electrical specification might call for a [[resistor]] with a nominal value of 100 Ω ([[Ohm (unit)|ohms]]), but will also state a tolerance such as "±1%". This means that any resistor with a value in the range 99 Ω to 101 Ω is acceptable. For critical components, one might specify that the actual resistance must remain within tolerance within a specified temperature range, over a specified lifetime, and so on.

Many commercially available [[resistor]]s and [[capacitor]]s of standard types, and some small [[inductor]]s, are often marked with [[Electronic color code|coloured bands]] to indicate their value and the tolerance. High-precision components of non-standard values may have numerical information printed on them.

==Difference between ''allowance and tolerance''==
The terms are often confused but sometimes a difference is maintained. See [[Allowance (engineering)#Confounding of the engineering concepts of allowance and tolerance]].

==Clearance (civil engineering)==
In [[civil engineering]], '''clearance''' refers to the difference between the [[loading gauge]] and the [[structure gauge]] in the case of [[railroad car]]s or [[tram]]s, or the difference between the size of any [[vehicle]] and the width/height of doors or the height of an [[overpass]] as well as the [[air draft]] under a [[bridge]].

'''Environmental inequality in the United Kingdom''' is the way in which the quality of the environment differs between different communities in the UK.&lt;ref name="defra1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/reports/cat09/0701110944_AQinequalitiesFNL_AEAT_0506.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415121248/http://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/reports/cat09/0701110944_AQinequalitiesFNL_AEAT_0506.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences are felt across a number of aspects of the environment, including air pollution, access to green space and exposure to flood risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lsx.org.uk/resources/EJIDefinition_page3198.aspx |title=London Sustainability Exchange |publisher=LSX |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425162529/http://www.lsx.org.uk/resources/EJIDefinition_page3198.aspx# |archive-date=2012-04-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept of 'environmental inequality'==
===Definitions===
[[The Environment Agency]], a British non-departmental public body of the [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA), defines 'environmental inequality' as follows: 'To observe or claim an environmental inequality is to point out that an aspect of the environment is distributed unevenly amongst different social groups (differentiated by social class, ethnicity, gender, age, location, etc.)'.&lt;ref name="staffs1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staffs.ac.uk/schools/sciences/geography/links/IESR/downloads/SC020061_SR1%20report%20-%20inequalities%20%20flood%20risk.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - PUBLISHED FLOOD.doc |website=Staffs.ac.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sustainable Development Research Network (SDRN) define environmental inequality as follows: 'Environmental inequality refers to the unequal distribution of environmental risks and hazards and access to environmental goods and services.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sd-research.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sdrnbriefingtwo_final_000.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425162529/http://www.sd-research.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/sdrnbriefingtwo_final_000.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Walker (professor)|Gordon Walker]] (Department of Geography, Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University and Malcolm Eames (University of Cardiff) define 'environmental inequality' as 'covering a wide range of questions of difference or unevenness, including:

*Who has good quality and safe environment to live in, who experiences pollution, hazards and risks and who is distanced or protected from such impacts?
*Who accesses and consumes environmental resources and who is unable to do so, or limited in their degree of access and consumption?
*Who is able to shape environmental decision-making and who is not? Who is included who is excluded?'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/downloads/ei_discussion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313100328/http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/downloads/ei_discussion.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist Liam Downey (2005) has distinguished five different ways of defining environmental inequality:

i) Intentional racism definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise when environmental hazards are intentionally placed in minority neighbourhoods by private companies.

ii) Disparate exposure definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when members of a specific social group are more highly exposed to some set of environmental pollutants than we would expect if group members were randomly distributed across residential space'.

iii) Disparate health impact definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when the negative health effects of residential proximity or exposure to environmental hazards are distributed unequally across social groups.'

iv) Disparate social impacts definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when members of a specific social group are more likely to live in environmentally hazardous neighborhoods than we would expect if group members were randomly distributed across residential space.'

v) Relative distribution of burdens versus benefits definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise when groups that receive greater benefits from capitalist social relations (according to proponents of this definition, this means whites and the middle and upper classes) are less burdened by industrial pollution than groups that receive fewer benefits from capitalist social relations (according to proponents of this definition, this means people of colour, the poor and the working classes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3162366 | pmid=21874079 | doi=10.1080/027321790518870 | volume=25 | title=Assessing Environmental Inequality: How the conclusions we draw vary according to the definitions we employ | year=2005 | journal=Sociol Spectr | pages=349–369 | last1 = Downey | first1 = L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History ===
The concept of environmental inequality emerged in the context of the movement for [[Environmental Justice]]. The Environmental Justice movement originated in the US in the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/ejinthe21century.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125172813/http://www.ejrc.cau.edu/ejinthe21century.htm |archivedate=2011-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to concerns about communities from poor, black and minority ethnic environments being disproportionately affected by environmental issues and excluded from environmental decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;See Schlosberg, David. (2007) Defining Environmental Justice: Theories, Movements, and Nature. [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Much initial progress on promoting an Environmental Justice agenda in the UK was made in Scotland, beginning with a speech made by [[Jack McConnell]], First Minister of the [[Scottish Executive]] in 2002. McConnell said: '... the reality is that the people who have the most urgent environmental concerns in Scotland are those who daily cope with the consequences of a poor quality of life, and live in a rotten environment – close to industrial pollution, plagued by vehicle emissions, streets filled by litter and walls covered in graffiti. This is true for Scotland and also true elsewhere in the world. These are circumstances which would not be acceptable to better off communities in our society, and those who have to endure such environments in which to bring up a family, or grow old themselves are being denied environmental justice.'&lt;ref name="scotland2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2006/05/23091323/12 |title=Sustainable Development: A Review of International Literature |website=Scotland.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this speech, and in light of Environmental Justice campaigning by [[Friends of the Earth]] Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe-scotland.org.uk/access-to-justice |title=Access to Environmental Justice &amp;#124; Friends of the Earth Scotland |website=Foe-scotland.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  references to Environmental Justice have been made in several Scottish policy documents ( e.g. Scottish Executive 2002c, 2003, 2003a (the Partnership Agreement); Scottish Executive Development Department, 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005). The Scottish Executive, in 2005, commissioned research into ways of making environmental information more accessible to the public, and has also recently commissioned a study that investigates the social impacts of flooding.&lt;ref name="scotland2006"/&gt;

An Environmental Justice agenda has also been emerging in England since the late 1990s. In 1999, Environment Minister [[Michael Meacher]] wrote, in a foreword to 'Equality and the Environment' by Brenda Boardman: 'environmental problems are serious and impact most heavily on the most vulnerable members of society: the old, the very young and the poor.'&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/environmental_justice.pdf |format=PDF |title=Environmental justice : Rights and means to a healthy environment for all |website=Foe.co.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 speech, Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] spoke about the need to address environmental issues such as access to green space and air quality in deprived urban areas&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://number10.gov.uk/page158 |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20061004085342/number10.gov.uk/page158 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-10-04 |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; UK Government Web Archive – The National Archives |website=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a speech given to the UN in New York, 2007, Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] said that 'the consequences of climate change will be disproportionately felt by the poorest who are least responsible for it – making the issue of climate change one of justice as much as economic development...economic progress social justice and environmental care now go together.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6924570.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; UK Politics &amp;#124; In full: Brown's speech at UN |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-07-31 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of this agenda became clear at a policy level in England, in [[DEFRA]]'s 1999 Sustainable Development Strategy 'A Better Life', in which there was a focus on access to environmental information, decision making and justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/uk-strategy99/index.htm |title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT&amp;#93; UK Government Web Archive – The National Archives |website=Collections.europarchive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080530153425/http:/www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/uk-strategy99/index.htm |archivedate=2008-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Justice theme was evident again in the 2004 Sustainable Development Strategy, which commissioned a public consultation on issues around environmental justice and equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/pdf/finalsummary.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - Draft final.doc |website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080530153425/http://www.sustainable-development.gov.uk/publications/pdf/finalsummary.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, in 2003, the government's Social Exclusion Unit published a report that examined issues around inequalities in transport and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100907154242/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-09-07 |format=PDF |title=Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion |website=Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One governmental actor involved in pushing forward the Environmental Justice agenda was The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. In 2004, it included environmental factors in its indices of deprivation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/131209.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20081211181656/http://www.communities.gov.uk/documents/communities/pdf/131209.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2005, it commissioned research into the links between social and economic conditions and environmental quality.&lt;ref&gt;'Improving the prospects of people living in areas of multiple deprivation in England' (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; The UK Environmental Justice agenda was also taken on by the government's [[Sustainable Development Commission]] (SDC). In their November 2001 review of the UK's Sustainable Development Strategy, SDC approached issues of regeneration, poverty and the environment with an environmental justice perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/data/files/publications/011101%20Review%202001%20-%20headlining%20sustainable%20development.pdf |format=PDF |title=Review 2001: headlining sustainable development |website=Sd-commission.org.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in their 2002 report 'Vision for Sustainable Regeneration, Environment and Poverty', SDC stressed the need for a new approach to sustainable regeneration that acknowledges the importance of environmental inequalities and the links between poverty and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sd-commission.org.uk/data/files/publications/021001%20Vision%20for%20sustainable%20regeneration,%20environment.pdf |format=PDF |title=Vision for sustainable regeneration, environment &amp; poverty – the missing link |website=Sd-commission.org.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discourse around environmental justice in the UK is often framed in terms of 'environmental equality', following DEFRA's decision to use environmental equality as one of its sustainable development indicators.&lt;ref name="defra2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sd.defra.gov.uk/2011/09/defra-invites-feedback-on-proposals-for-new-indicators/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111108152326/http://sd.defra.gov.uk/2011/09/defra-invites-feedback-on-proposals-for-new-indicators/ |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sd.defra.gov.uk/progress/national/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20111108125944/http://sd.defra.gov.uk/progress/national/ |archivedate=2011-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==People affected==
The Environment Agency states that 'People who are socially and economically disadvantaged often live in the worst environments. For example, those living in the most deprived parts of England experience the worst air quality and have less access to green space and adequate housing. These problems can affect people's health and well being and can add to the burden of social and economic deprivation. They can also limit the opportunities available for people to improve their lives and undermine attempts to renew local neighbourhoods. Those affected tend to be the most vulnerable and excluded in society.'&lt;ref name="Archived copy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/library/position/41189.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529041353/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/research/library/position/41189.aspx |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also evidence that people from [[Black and ethnic minority|BME]] (black and minority ethnic) backgrounds suffer the worst environmental conditions, and are excluded from environmental decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Agyeman, J., 'Ethnic minorities in Britain: short change, systematic indifference and sustainable development', 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; UK NGO and think-tank Capacity Global, in 'BMEs – Tackling Social and Environmental Justice', argue that several barriers exist, which hinder BAME communities' action on tackling environmental problems.&lt;ref name="capacity1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/BAMEs_tackling_social_environmental_justice.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402025518/http://www.capacity.org.uk/downloads/BAMEs_tackling_social_environmental_justice.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Access to parks, green spaces and the natural environment===
The most affluent 20 per cent of council wards have five times the amount of parks or general green space (excluding gardens) per person than the most deprived 10 per cent of wards.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabe.org.uk/files/urban-green-nation.pdf |title=Online Casino - Play Blackjack, Roulette, Slots &amp; More &amp;#124; Casino Oasis |website=Cabe.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wards with a population with fewer than 2% black and minority ethnic residents have six times as many parks and eleven times more public green space as wards where more than 40 per cent of the population are people from black and minority ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

According to a 2011 DEFRA White Paper on the Natural Environment, people in deprived areas are nearly six times less likely than those in affluent ones to describe their area as 'green', and 'those living in deprived areas, minority ethnic communities, elderly people and those with disabilities have less access to green spaces or tend to use them less.' This paper also noted that the frequency of exposure to the natural environment (incorporating a broad array of living things including wildlife, forests, rivers, streams, lakes, seas, countryside, farmed land and urban green space) is 'significantly lower' amongst those aged above 65, BME populations and those on low incomes (members of DE socioeconomic groups).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm80/8082/8082.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725050649/http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm80/8082/8082.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the government's [[Forestry Commission]], several factors interact to prevent black and minority ethnic groups from having the same access to woodland as other groups. These are: economic factors; lack of awareness, familiarity, knowledge, confidence or interest; cultural attitudes and preferences; feeling unwelcome and out of place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/FR290807_RESFinalReport.pdf/$FILE/FR290807_RESFinalReport.pdf |title=Race Equality and the Forestry Commission - Final Report |website=Forestry.gov.uk |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exposure to flood risk===
Deprived communities are more exposed to flood risk, with eight times more people in the most deprived 10% of the population living in tidal floodplains than the least deprived 10%. People in deciles 1 and 2 (decile 1 being the most deprived 10% of the population and decile 2 the second most deprived 10%) are 47 per cent more likely to be living at risk of flooding than the rest of the population for zone 2 floodrisk areas, and 62% more likely for zone 3.&lt;ref name="staffs1"/&gt;

===Air pollution===
The worst levels of [[air pollution]] are experienced by people in the most deprived 10% areas in England. These people are also subject to 41% higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide from transport and industry than the average.&lt;ref name="defra1"/&gt; The average black or black-British African in the UK person is exposed to 27.25 micrograms per cubic metre of harmful pollutant PM10. This is over 28% higher than the average urban white person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endsreport.com/docs/20090820a.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710192634/http://www.endsreport.com/docs/20090820a.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exposure to harmful chemicals===
A 1999 Friends of the Earth report found that 82% of all carcinogenic chemical emissions were released by factories in the most deprived 20% wards. Further, the report suggested that because 70% of all people from ethnic minorities in the UK live in the 88 most deprived wards, this exposure to harmful chemicals disproportionately affects these people.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

===Transport-related problems===
Over a quarter  of child pedestrian casualties happen in the most deprived 10% of wards. In Wales, children and people aged over 65 are twice as likely to be injured by motor vehicles in deprived areas than in more advantaged areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustrans.org.uk/assets/files/AT/Publications/health_inequality_FINAL.pdf) ]{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proximity to waste and landfill sites===
An investigation by the Environment Agency into Environmental Justice in South Yorkshire revealed that in South Yorkshire, people in decile 1 are twice as likely to be living next to a recycling site, a waste transfer site or a landfill site as the rest of the population and three times more likely to be living near to an amenity site.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental Justice in South Yorkshire: Locating Social Deprivation and Poor Environments using Multiple Indicators Fairburn J, Butler B and Smith G, Local Environment Vol. 14 (2) 2009 pp 139 – 154 Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK as a whole, deprived communities are more likely to live near waste sites except landfill sites, where it is the least deprived populations that are located nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/EnvJustice/downloads/SR3%20Waste.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512064536/http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/EnvJustice/downloads/SR3%20Waste.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Export of products banned for sale in the UK===
[[Innospec]], a company based in [[Ellesmere Port]], is the last remaining manufacturer of [[tetraethyl lead]] in the world. The product is banned for general sale in the UK, but has been exported to countries such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Burma]], [[Iraq]] and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Monbiot |first1=George |title=Yes, lead poisoning could really be a cause of violent crime |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jan/07/violent-crime-lead-poisoning-british-export |accessdate=10 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm has admitted paying bribes to foreign officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Evans |first1=Rob |title=Chemical firm Innospec admits bribing foreign officials |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/mar/18/firm-bribes-banned-chemical-tetraethyl |accessdate=10 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[George Monbiot]] has argued that Innospec was let off lightly for the bribery and has termed the continued permissiveness in allowing Innospec to export its product as 'environmental racism'.&lt;ref name="The Guardian"/&gt;

==Causes==
As for the causes of environmental inequalities in the UK, the Environment Agency writes: 'The causes of these inequalities are often complex and long-standing. Some problems are due to the historical location of industry and communities; others are the result of the impacts of new developments such as traffic. Often these environmental problems are caused by the actions of others who do not live in the affected community. Often those most affected have not been involved in the decisions that affect the quality of their environment.'&lt;ref name="Archived copy"/&gt; Environmental equity advocates often argue that environmental inequalities are entrenched due to the fact that the vulnerable communities exposed to environmental burdens lack the means necessary to change their situation due to factors such as limited economic means, exclusion from decision-making processes and [[institutionalised racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbecal.org/pdf/healthy-communities.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007040211/http://www.cbecal.org/pdf/healthy-communities.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work being done==
The UK government has included environmental equality as one of its [[sustainable development]] indicators since the establishment of these indicators in 1992.&lt;ref name="defra2"/&gt;  Further, [[DEFRA]] have incorporated an environmental inequalities analysis into its work,&lt;ref name="defra1"/&gt; and the Environment Agency have published several reports on environmental inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0507BMRW-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0905BJOK-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0507BMRU-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.environment-agency.gov.uk/PDF/SCHO0507BMRV-E-E.pdf |title=Publications - GOV.UK |website=Publications.environment-agency.gov.uk |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wales, action around environmental inequalities has primarily been coordinated through the [[Welsh Assembly]]'s Community First initiative, which has attempted to enable deprived communities to take action themselves on sustainable development issues, with a particular focus on health inequalities and the health benefits of access to environmental goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wcva.org.uk/all/dsp_text.cfm?0%3D0%26display_sitetextid%3D1504 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208213351/http://www.wcva.org.uk/all/dsp_text.cfm?0=0&amp;display_sitetextid=1504 |archivedate=2011-12-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh Assembly have recognised the environmental aspects of deprivation, incorporating this into its 2008 index of multiple deprivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wales.gov.uk/docs/statistics/2010/100712wimd08summaryen.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.proni.gov.uk/20110830024651/http://wales.gov.uk/docs/statistics/2010/100712wimd08summaryen.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several UK academics have published widely around environmental inequalities. Academics working on environmental inequalities include Gordon Walker of Lancaster University and Professor Malcolm Eames of Cardiff University.&lt;ref&gt;See a paper co-written by Walker and Eames called 'Environmental inequalities : reflections on a transdisciplinary seminar series.' Local Environment, 13 (8). pp. 663-667&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Brunel University and Lancaster University organised a series of seminars on environmental inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002232803/http://geography.lancs.ac.uk/envjustice/eiseminars/ |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was supported by the Economic &amp; Social Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Sustainable Development Research Council, the Environment Agency and DEFRA.

The following UK NGOs work on issues around environmental inequalities:
* [[Friends of the Earth]] do some work on issues around environmental justice and inequalities. In 2001, they published a briefing on Environmental Justice with the [[ESRC]]&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; and they have also published a report on social exclusion and transport in Bradford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foe.co.uk/resource/reports/env_justice_bradford.pdf |format=PDF |title=Environmental Justice : Mapping transport and social exclusion in Bradford |website=Foe.co.uk |accessdate=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gender neutrality'''  (adjective form: '''gender-neutral'''), also known as '''gender-neutralism''' or the '''gender neutrality movement''',  describes the idea that policies, language, and other [[social institutions]] should avoid distinguishing roles according to people's [[sex]] or [[gender]], in order to avoid discrimination arising from the impression that there are [[Gender role|social roles]] for which one gender is more suited than another.

==In policy==

Proponents of gender neutrality may support public policies designed to eliminate gender distinctions, such as [[unisex public toilet|gender-neutral bathroom]]s, with public restrooms being available without distinguishing the gender of the person using them. It has been observed that gender neutrality in the law has changed the nature of custody disputes, making it more likely that men will be awarded custody of their children in the event of a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;[[Regina Graycar]], Jenny Morgan, ''The Hidden Gender of Law'' (2002), p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal definition of gender has been a controversial topic particularly to [[transgender]] people; in some countries in order to be legally defined as a new sex people must first undergo [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicole Pasulka |url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2012/02/most-european-countries-force-sterilization-transgender-people-map |title=17 European Countries Force Transgender Sterilization (Map) |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[California]] joined [[Oregon]] in its effort to recognize gender neutrality. On October 15, 2017 California governor [[Jerry Brown]] signed new legislation into law that allows persons the option to select gender-neutral on state identification cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/nation-and-world/california-to-add-gender-neutral-option-on-state-drivers-licenses/|title=California to add gender-neutral option on state driver’s licenses|date=2017-10-17|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=2017-10-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gray areas in gender==
{{main|Sex and gender distinction}}
An issue related to gender neutrality is the gray areas that exist in gender. Trying to legally define the boundaries of gender has proven a difficult issue with the existence of people who identify or who are identified by others as [[intersex]], [[third gender]], [[transgender]] and more generally [[genderqueer]] or [[non-binary]].

==Gender blindness==
{{Main|Gender-blind}}
Someone who identifies as [[gender blind]] takes the perspective of gender neutrality in everyday life.

==Gender-neutral language==
{{Main|Gender-neutral language}}
'''Gender-neutral language''', '''gender-inclusive language''', '''inclusive language''' or '''gender neutrality''' is a form of [[linguistic prescriptivism]] that aims to eliminate (or neutralize) reference to gender in terms that describe people. This can involve discouragement of the use of [[gender-specific job title]]s, such as ''policeman/policewoman'', ''fireman'', ''stewardess'', and, arguably, ''chairman'', in favour of corresponding gender-neutral terms such as ''police officer'', ''firefighter'', ''flight attendant'' and ''chairperson'' (or ''chair''). Other gender-specific terms, such as ''actor'' and ''actress'', may be replaced by the originally male term (''actor'' used for either gender).

The [[pronouns]] ''he''  or ''she'' may be replaced with ''[[singular they|they]]'' when the gender of the person referred to is unknown. Some also advocate for a [[gender-neutral pronoun]] to be used even when the sex of a person is known, in an effort to remove the alleged subconscious effects of language in reinforcing gender and [[gender stereotypes]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In addition, those who do not identify as either female or male may use a [[gender-neutral pronoun]] to refer to themselves or have others refer to them.

In 2012, a gender-neutral pronoun "hen" was proposed in Sweden. Swedish was the first language to officially add a third neutral pronoun. "Hen" can be used to describe anyone regardless of their sex or gender identification.&lt;ref name = "Gustafsson_Sendén_2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gustafsson Sendén|first=Marie|last2=Bäck|first2=Emma A.|last3=Lindqvist|first3=Anna|date= July 2015 |title=Introducing a gender-neutral pronoun in a natural gender language: the influence of time on attitudes and behavior |journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=6|pages=893|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00893 |pmc=4486751|pmid=26191016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender-neutral pronouns that have been proposed in the United States have not had widespread use outside of LGBTQ communities.&lt;ref name = "Gustafsson_Sendén_2015" /&gt; The practice of gender-neutral language is highly encouraged among law students and the Supreme Court of the United States. However, research has shown that only one judge on the Supreme Court consistently uses gender-neutral language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rose|first=Leslie|date=January 2010|title=THE SUPREME COURT AND GENDER-NEUTRAL LANGUAGE: SETTING THE STANDARD OR LAGGING BEHIND?|url=https://search.proquest.com/genderwatch/docview/613423895/fulltextPDF/1D19F44F63064114PQ/1?accountid=7418|journal=Duke Journal of Gender Law &amp; Policy|volume=17|pages=81–129|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LGBTQ activists have suggested that the pronouns "he/she and his/her linguistically enforce a normative two sex system" where one must fall into the gender binary of either male or female. There is a growing variety of several different gender-neutral pronouns. These may include sie, hir, hirs, and hirself, and also include "z" or "p". Some argue that only changing pronouns to be gender-neutral for people who are "sex/gender" ambiguous creates someone "other" than the norm. A proposed solution to this issue is to move towards the use of inclusive language and gender-neutral pronouns for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wayne|first=Linda|date=Winter–Spring 2005|title=Neutral Pronouns: A Modest Proposal Whose Time Has Come|url=https://search.proquest.com/genderwatch/docview/217472802/fulltextPDF/EAB6B3433C2D4EBAPQ/10?accountid=7418|journal=Canadian Woman Studies|volume=24|pages=85–91|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Gender-neutral language" should not be confused with "[[genderless language]]", which refers to a language that does not have [[grammatical gender]].

==Relationship to feminism and masculism==
Gender neutrality emphasizes the [[gender equality|equal treatment of men and women]] and people of any other gender legally with no discrimination whatsoever. This goal is in principle shared with both [[feminist]]s and [[masculist]]s. However, in gender neutralism, the emphasis is on transcending the perspective of gender altogether rather than focusing on the rights of specific genders.

==Relationship to transhumanism==
{{Main|Postgenderism}}
Gender neutrality or "gender transcendence" is part of the [[transhumanist]] concept of [[postgenderism]].

Advocates of postgenderism argue that the presence of [[gender roles]], [[social stratification]], and [[gender differences|cogno-physical disparities and differences]] are generally to the detriment of individuals and society. Given the radical potential for advanced assistive reproductive options, postgenderists believe that sex for [[sexual reproduction|reproductive]] purposes will either become obsolete, or that all post-gendered humans will have the ability, if they so choose, to both carry a pregnancy to term ''and'' father a child, which, postgenderists believe, would have the effect of eliminating the need for definite genders in such a society.&lt;ref name="Dvorsky 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|author = [[George Dvorsky|Dvorsky, George]]|title=Postgenderism: Beyond the Gender Binary|year=2008|url=http://sentientdevelopments.blogspot.com/2008/03/postgenderism-beyond-gender-binary.html|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In marketing==
Marketing is often focused on [[Target market|targeting]] specific demographics and creates products focused on specific genders. Public views on gender-specific marketing have gained media attention in recent years, for example a protest against a [[Société Bic|bic]] pen "Bic for her" that was targeted towards women by the posting of thousands of fake reviews of the pen mocking its female-specific advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/9503359/BIC-ridiculed-over-comfortable-pink-pens-for-women.html |title=BIC ridiculed over 'comfortable' pink pens for women |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Children's toys ===
In the marketing of children's toys, gender-specific marketing has been very prevalent. According to a study conducted in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auster|first=Carol J.|last2=Mansbach|first2=Claire S.|date=2012-10-01|title=The Gender Marketing of Toys: An Analysis of Color and Type of Toy on the Disney Store Website|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=67|issue=7–8|pages=375–388|doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0177-8|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; "children learn about the toys seen as appropriate for their gender not only from adults and children but also through the media, which serves as an important source of socialization and gender socialization." Color palettes and types of toys are gendered characteristics of the toys marketed to either boys or girls. The results of the study mentioned above, showed that "toys that were pastel colored were much more likely to be marketed as toys for 'only girls', while bold colored toys were much more likely to be marketed as toys for 'boys only'" and also found that blue was a more gender-neutral color. Action toys, like cars, weapons, and building toys are marketed toward boys, while toys that have to do with beauty and domestic work are marketed towards girls. Some toys, like stuffed animals, proven to be gender-neutral and are usually marketed to both boys and girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stagnitti|first=Karen|last2=Rodger|first2=Sylvia|last3=Clarke|first3=John|date=1997-09-01|title=Determining gender-neutral toys for assessment of preschool children's imaginative play|journal=[[Australian Occupational Therapy Journal]]|language=en|volume=44|issue=3|pages=119–131|doi=10.1111/j.1440-1630.1997.tb00764.x|issn=1440-1630}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parent's also play a large role in building their children's gender socialization, as they are the ones buying the toys for their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldera|first=Yvonne M.|last2=Huston|first2=Aletha C.|last3=O'Brien|first3=Marion|date=1989|title=Social Interactions and Play Patterns of Parents and Toddlers with Feminine, Masculine, and Neutral Toys|journal=Child Development|volume=60|issue=1|pages=70–76|doi=10.2307/1131072|jstor=1131072}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popularity of making toy advertising gender neutral has been increasing such as ads showing boys playing with baby dolls (a toy that has commonly been marketed towards girls only in the past).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sally Peck, The Telegraph |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/gender-bending-toys-r-us-ads-from-sweden-2012-11 |title=Gender-Bending Toys R Us Ads From Sweden |publisher=Business Insider |date=28 November 2012 |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fashion ===
In the marketing of fashion lines, designers are beginning to design gender-neutral clothing, that is not labeling their clothing as either "men's" or "women's", but depends on suitable for men and women. Many sportswear are now include gender neutrality in order to promote [[gender equality]] for men and women.

==In education==
There has been some advancement in the incorporation of gender neutrality within the classroom. Attempts to encourage this mentality in schools are demonstrated by institutions such as Nicolaigarden and Egalia, two preschools in Sweden. Their efforts to replace terms “girl” and “boy” to the gender neutral pronoun “hen” grants students the ability to challenge or cross gender boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/28/health/sweden-gender-neutral-preschool/index.html|title=There are no girls or boys at this school|last=CNN|first=Katy Scott|work=CNN|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are however, implicit biases within the faculty and staff in schools that ultimately prevent gender fluidity in classroom settings. In a study done in 2016 that measured teacher's facilitations of gender-typed and gender- neutral activities during free play, it was concluded that teachers facilitated masculine activities at higher rates than feminine. It is suggested by the study that, "Informing teachers about this trend may prompt teachers to reflect on their own teaching practices and serve as a catalyst for the promotion of teaching practices that create classroom environments in which boys and girls receive support for engagement with a variety of classroom activities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Granger|first=Kristen L.|date=April 2017|title=Preschool Teachers' Facilitation of Gender-Typed and Gender- Neutral Activities during Free Play|url=|journal=Sex Roles|volume=76|pages=498–510|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Other suggestions and pursuits to broaden the mentality behind gender neutrality in schools include

=== Dress code ===
The abolishment of certain dress codes has been conserved amongst institutions depending on the limitations imposed on students and their comfort in such attire. For transgender students, strict dress codes may complicate their path towards confirming their gender identity, a cost which can affect these individuals well throughout their life. Ways in which compliance with attire in institutions can cause reverberations in other areas of life are factors such as a lowered academic performance, higher dropout rates, and increased disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glickman|first=Deanna J.|date=2016|title=Fashioning children: gender restrictive dress codes as an entry point for the trans: school to prison pipeline|url=|journal=The American University Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law|volume=24|pages=264–284|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2017}}, 150 primary schools in the United Kingdom have introduced gender neutral uniforms and students feel more in control their identity as a result to this policy change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4901292/More-100-schools-introduce-gender-neutral-uniforms.html|title=More than 100 schools introduce gender neutral uniforms|work=Mail Online|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== College ===
In 2005, [[University of California, Riverside]] became the first public university campus in the US to offer a gender-neutral housing option.&lt;ref name="LGBT ranking"&gt;{{cite press release|title=LGBT Resource Center UC Riverside Named Among 100 Best for LGBT Students|date=11 August 2006|publisher=University of California, Riverside|url=http://out.ucr.edu/campus/100best.htm|accessdate=3 February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703195130/http://out.ucr.edu/campus/100best.htm|archivedate=3 July 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A February 2014 ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' article noted that nearly 150 US schools now have gender-neutral housing programs.&lt;ref name="WP Housing 2014" /&gt; Other institutions such as University of Southern California and Princeton,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2009|title=Princeton to Offer Mixed-Gender Dorms|url=https://search.proquest.com/genderwatch/docview/222727389/AD59DAAA44324740PQ/1?accountid=7418|journal=ProQuest|volume=18|pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledge some of the dangers that come as a result to housing options as a member of the LGBTQ community and have also developed separate housing to accommodate such students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://housing.usc.edu/index.php/gender-neutral-housing-information/|title=Gender Neutral Housing Information {{!}} USC Housing|website=housing.usc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[La Salle University]] students voted to have a gender-neutral housing option in their dormitories, which would make La Salle the first [[Catholic]] university in the United States to offer gender-neutral living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2016-02-26/news/70943501_1_catholic-university-student-safety-colleges|title=Archives - Philly.com|date=|website=Articles.philly.com|accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This student-led vote caused controversy in Catholic circles across the United States, since it is traditional for Catholic school residence halls to be completely separated by gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cardinalnewmansociety.org/CatholicEducationDaily/DetailsPage/tabid/102/ArticleID/4681/La-Salle-Univ-Students-Approve-of-Gender-Neutral-Housing-in-Online-Ballot.aspx|title=Cardinal Newman Society|date=|publisher=Cardinal Newman Society|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510181911/http://www.cardinalnewmansociety.org/CatholicEducationDaily/DetailsPage/tabid/102/ArticleID/4681/La-Salle-Univ-Students-Approve-of-Gender-Neutral-Housing-in-Online-Ballot.aspx|archivedate=10 May 2016|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2017-03-27|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Salle University has since incorporated accommodating housing options for students and has urged other Catholic universities to make changes in housing policies as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cardinalnewmansociety.org/la-salle-univ-students-approve-of-gender-neutral-housing-in-online-ballot/|title=La Salle Univ.

== In parenting ==

Helen Davies describes gender as "the classification of male or female that includes social, psychological, and intellectual characteristics. The theory of gender neutrality is a theory that claims that biological sex does not inevitably determine social, psychological, and intellectual characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thinking woman : a philosophical approach to the quandary of gender|last=Dragseth|first=Jennifer|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parental control strategies can be defined as any strategy that a parent uses to alter, change, or influence their child's behavior, thoughts, or feelings. Meta-analysis reveals from Endendijk, "the basis of gender neutral parenting also known as GNP, does not project a gender onto a child. It allows parents and children to break away from gender binary."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Gender-Differentiated Parenting Revisited: Meta-Analysis Reveals Very Few Differences in Parental Control of Boys and Girls|journal=PLOS One|volume=11|issue=7|pages=e0159193|last=Endendijk|first=Joyce|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0159193|pmid=27416099|pmc=4945059|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender neutral parenting is allowing children to be exposed to a variety of gender types so children can explore their gender without restriction from society or the gender they were born with. Autonomy-supportive strategies provide the child with an appropriate amount of control, a desired amount of choice, acknowledge the child's perspectives, and provide the child with meaningful rationales when choice is constrained. Even if a child does not display gender bending behaviors, GNP allows them to explore and not be constrained from the gender they were born with. This can be through letting them play with non-stereotypical toys for their gender, allowing them to pick their own clothing, allowing them to act more "feminine" or masculine", and allowing children to question their gender. In the sociology book ''Sex Differences In Social Behavior: A Social Role Interpretation'', Alice Eagly theorizes that sex differences have been proposed, based on biological factors, early childhood socialization, and other perspectives. This allows children to express themselves without feeling pressure from being extremely masculine or feminine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sex Differences In Social Behavior: A Social Role Interpretation|last=Eagly|first=Alice|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They will also be granted exposure to gender roles and be able to think critically about them at a young age.

== In children's literature ==
Gender neutrality in children's literature refers to the idea that publishers, writers and illustrators should avoid marketing towards children through the basis of their sex or gender, and should instead focus on expanding content rather than reinforcing social and gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Let Books Be Books|url=http://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/time-to-let-books-be-books/|website=Lettoysbetoys.org.uk|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender roles and stereotypes permeate our culture and are established through a variety of means such as visual culture or daily interactions with family and peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Identity and Gender Confusion in Children|publisher=Caring for Your School-Age Child: Ages 5 to 12 (Copyright © 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics)|date=5 November 2013|url=http://Healthychildren.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics of gender neutrality and [[gender performativity]] have been discussed in a broader sense amongst scholars such as [[Judith Butler]] in ''[[Undoing Gender]]'' and ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' in relation to other aspects of society such as in the case of [[David Reimer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does "Gender Neutral" look like?|url=http://thegenderoffender.blogspot.ca/2012/04/what-does-gender-neutral-look-like.html|website=The Gender Offender|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to children's marketing, gender neutrality is a growing movement amongst parents, children and publishers.&lt;ref name="publishingperspectives.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abrams|first1=Dennis|title=Should UK Children's Books Be Non-Gender Specific|url=http://publishingperspectives.com/2014/03/should-uk-childrens-books-be-non-gender-specific/|website=Publishing Perspectives|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many homes to [[gender stereotypes]], the books that children are encountering have both psychological and social uses during a time when children are constantly constructing ideas from information around them and assimilating new knowledge with previous knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsao|first1=Ya-Lun|title=Gender Issues in Young Children's Literature|journal=Journal of Healthcare Management|date=2008 |volume=53|issue=5|pages=108–114|url=https://fu-ctge-5245.wikispaces.com/file/view/Tsao.pdf|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations such as [[Let Toys Be Toys]], [[Let Books Be Books]] and [[Pinkstinks]] have been gaining publicity for their work in favour of gender neutrality within children's literature and toys.

=== Representations of gender within picture books ===
With the emphasis placed on children's literature today, especially the genre of the picture book, parental and feminist groups have been increasingly vocal on the social implications of gender-specific marketing and the limitations they impose on children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kreitler|first1=Katy|title=Why Children Need Books About Adventurous Girls|url=http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/09/why-children-need-books-about-adventurous-girls/|website=Everyday Feminism|accessdate=4 December 2014|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies at Provider-Parent Partnerships have shown that children begin forming their sense of gender identity at 2–3 years old and begin '[[Gender typing]]' at ages 3–4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Putnam|first1=Jodi|last2=Myers-Walls|first2=Judith A.|last3=Love|first3=Dee|title=Ages and Stages|url=https://www.extension.purdue.edu/providerparent/child%20growth-development/AgesStages.htm|website=Provider-Parent Partnerships|publisher=Purdue University|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study surrounding ''Gender Perception in Adults'', Dr. Kyle Pruett reported: "A defining moment came in gender difference research when a group of male babies were dressed in pink, and then handed to adults who were told they were girls. The adults responded with language and handling styles shown to be classically female-stereotypic: "adorable, cuddly, sweet, cute," etc. Female babies in blue were called "slugger, tough, strong, stubborn," etc. This is how we simply wind up reinforcing gender-stereotypic behaviors, rather than fostering individual growth and development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pruett|first1=Dr. Kyle|title=Gender Differences|url=http://life.familyeducation.com/early-learning/gender-differences/36229.html|website=Family Education|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a child developing their sense of self in formative years has been a topic of discussion amongst cultural theorists as well as in [[children's literature criticism]]. In ''The Pleasures of Children's Literature'', Shulamith Shahar states, "Child raising practices and educational methods as well as parent-child relation are determined not solely by biological laws but are also culturally constructed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nodelman|first1=Perry|last2=Reimer|first2=Mavis|title=The pleasures of children's literature|date=2003|publisher=Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9780801332487|page=1|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists such as [[Jacques Lacan]] and Judith Butler have contributed to this notion of the formation of an individual's subjectivity and sense of self. Lacan's concept of the [[mirror stage]] has contributed to modern understanding of subjectivity and has since been applied to Children's Literature Criticism and child development.

Judith Butler's notion of gender performativity also forms correlations to gender-specific children's literature through analyzing the ways characters perform their gender and has been taken up in Children's literature criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nikolajeva|first1=Maria|author-link=Maria Nikolajeva|title=Aesthetic Approaches to Children's Literature: An Introduction|date=July 2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810854260|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler has defined gender performativity stating: "the production actually happens through a certain kind of repetition and recitation".&lt;ref name="Radical Philosophy Ltd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Osborne|first1=Peter|last2=Segal|first2=Lynne|title=Gender as Performance: An Interview with Judith Butler|date=1994|publisher=Radical Philosophy Ltd|pages=32–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butler also relays that, "Performativity is the discursive mode by which ontological effects are installed."&lt;ref name="Radical Philosophy Ltd"/&gt; Although Butler's subject is the adult subject the concept of repetition transcends to themes of childhood as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollen|first1=Annebella|title=Performing Spectacular Girlhood: Massed-Produced Dressing-Up Costumes and the Commodification of Imagination|journal=Textile History|date=November 2011|volume=2|issue=42|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Butler and Lacan consider repetition as being an underlying factor in forming one's identity which can then be applied to children's literature through the act of children rereading books multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Hephzibah|title=Re-reading: The ultimate guilty pleasure?|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20140305-are-you-a-re-reader|website=BBC|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Studies in representation in children's literature ===
Gender imbalances have continued to appear in children's literature through the lack of diverse representations.  In the 2011 issue of ''[[Gender &amp; Society]]'', the study "Gender in Twentieth-Century Children's Books" discovered large disparities. Through looking at almost 6,000 children's books published between 1900 and 2000, the study, led by Janice McCabe, a professor of sociology at Florida State University, found that males are central characters in 57% of children's books published each year, with just 31% having female central characters. Male animals are central characters in 23% of books per year, the study found, while female animals star in only 7.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Flood |first = Alison |title = Study finds huge gender imbalance in children's literature |url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/06/gender-imbalance-children-s-literature |work = [[The Guardian]] |date = 6 May 2011 |accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = McCabe |first1 = Janice |last2 = Fairchild |first2 = Emily |last3 = Grauerholz |first3 = Liz |last4 = Pescosolido |first4 = Bernice A. |last5 = Tope |first5 = Daniel |title = Gender in twentieth-century children's books: patterns of disparity in titles and central characters |journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] |volume = 25 |issue = 2 |pages = 197–226 |doi = 10.1177/0891243211398358 |date = April 2011 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In putting forth these narrow representations of characters, it becomes difficult for a child to identify themselves within gender binaries and roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kreitler|first1=Katy|title=Why Children Need Books About Adventurous Girls |url=http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/09/why-children-need-books-about-adventurous-girls/|website=Everyday Feminism|accessdate=1 December 2014|date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier study in 1971, out of fifty-eight books, twenty-five had a picture of a woman somewhere in them, yet only four did not having a woman (or animal representing a woman) wearing an apron.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Nilsen |first = Alleen Pace |title = Women in children's literature |journal = [[College English]] |volume = 8 |issue = 32 |date = May 1971 |url = http://www.ncte.org/journals/ce/issues/v32-8 |ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many parents read their own childhood favourites to their children, through an endearing plot, or through beautiful illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brotman|first1=Barbara|title=Bonding over generations of childhood books |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/columnists/ct-madeline-brotman-talk-0908-20140908-column.html |date = 8 September 2014 |accessdate=4 December 2014|work= [[Chicago Tribune]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the adult may recognize that the stereotypes may be outdated, the children may lack that criticality in reading these stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Egoff |first = Sheila |title = Thursday's child: trends and patterns in contemporary children's literature |date = 1981 |publisher = American Library Association |location = Chicago, Illinois |isbn = 9780838903278 |page=28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthering this portrayal of gender in children's books the ways in which each gender is portrayed is very different. Female characters are much more likely to take on passive and supportive roles whereas male characters fulfill a self-sufficient, strong and active role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kreitler|first1=Katy|title=Why children need books about adventurous girls |url = http://everydayfeminism.com/2012/09/why-children-need-books-about-adventurous-girls/ |website = Everyday Feminism|accessdate=4 December 2014|date= September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discriminatory portrayal takes place in many children's books and runs the risk of leading children toward a misrepresented and misguided realization of their true potential in their expanding world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last = Tsao |first = Ya-Lun |title = Gender issues in young children's literature |journal = Reading Improvement |volume = 45 |issue = 3 |pages = 108–114 |date = 2008 |url = http://ingentaconnect.com/content/prin/rimp |ref = harv }} [https://fu-ctge-5245.wikispaces.com/file/view/Tsao.pdf Proquest.] [https://fu-ctge-5245.wikispaces.com/file/view/Tsao.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only are these inequalities present within the books, but gender disparities also exist amongst those creating children's books. In the 2013 [[Vida: Women in Literary Arts]] count, male authors and illustrators drastically outnumbered those who were female (64:21).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Magoon |first = Kekla |title = VIDA count: children's literature young adult and children's literature: do women truly dominate? | url = http://www.vidaweb.org/vida-count-childrens-literature/ |website = VIDA: Women in Literary Arts | accessdate = 4 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In children's literature in the media ===
In March 2014, the British organization, Let Toys Be Toys, expanded to include a children's book specific category, Let Books Be Books.  This expansion specifically addressed gender specific titles on books such as ''The Beautiful Girl's Colouring Book'' and ''The Brilliant Boys Colouring Book'' and the limitations in which these titles impose upon children. As Katy Guest stated in an article for the ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'' in March 2014, after Let Books Be Books launched, "What we are doing by pigeon-holing children is badly letting them down. And books, above all things, should be available to any child who is interested in them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guest|first1=Katy|title=Gender-specific books demean all our children. So the Independent on Sunday will no longer review anything marketed to exclude either sex|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/genderspecific-books-demean-all-our-children-so-the-independent-on-sunday-will-no-longer-review-anything-marketed-to-exclude-either-sex-9194694.html|accessdate=4 December 2014|agency=The Independent|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the organization Let Toys Be Toys states, "Just like labelling toys 'for girls' or 'for boys' these books send out very limiting messages to children about what kinds of things are appropriate for girls or for boys."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Time to Let Books Be Books|url=http://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/time-to-let-books-be-books/|website=Let Toys Be Toys|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization quickly gained momentum and almost immediately acquired over 3000 signatures for their petition causing publishers [[Parragon]] and [[Usborne Publishing|Usborne]] to lend their support and stop publishing gender specific children's books.&lt;ref name="publishingperspectives.com"/&gt; In November 2014, publishers of Peter and Jane Books, [[Ladybird Books]] agreed to make titles gender neutral stating: 'At Ladybird, we certainly don't want to be seen to be limiting children in any way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Styles|first1=Ruth|title=Rapunzel is definitely not just for girls, says top publisher as it announces plans to make all of its children's books gender-neutral|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2843801/Rapunzel-definitely-not-just-girls-says-publisher-announces-plans-make-children-s-books-gender-neutral.html|accessdate=4 December 2014|agency=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Controversy ===
Publishers such as Igloo Books and [[Buster Books]] continue to publish gender-specific children's books. In an interview in March 2014 Buster Editor Michael O'Mara stated: "The proof is in the pudding. Our two best children books ever are ''The Boys' Book'' and ''The Girls' Book''. The boys' one included things like how to make a bow and arrow and how to play certain sports and you'd get things about style and how to look cool in the girls' book. 2,000 people signed this petition [in the first day], but we sold 500,000 copies of ''The Girls' Book''. These statistics tell me I'm going in the right direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morrison|first1=Sarah|title=Gender-specific children's books 'are easier to sell', insists children's book publisher|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/genderspecific-childrens-books-are-easier-to-sell-insists-childrens-book-publisher-9185067.html|accessdate=4 December 2014|agency=The Independent|date=11 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter in response to this interview ''Let Books Be Books'' expressed the following concerns to Michael O'Mara: "We have been contacted by many parents, teachers and supporters who have serious concerns about several of the titles currently on your website and being marketed in shops across the UK. They believe, as we do, that labelling books by gender narrows children's choices and imaginations by telling them what they 'should' be reading, instead of letting them choose books that interest them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter to Buster Books|url=http://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/letter-to-buster-books/|website=Let Toys Be Toys|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender-neutral lawsuits==
{{Globalize|section|date=June 2018}}{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

=== ''Jones v. Bon Appetit Management Company et al'' ===
In February 2014, former catering worker Valeria Jones sued employer [[Bon Appétit Management Company|Bon Appetit Management Co.]] in [[Oregon]] for US$518,000 after co-workers repeatedly referred to Jones as female. Jones did not identify as either male or female and when applying to work at Bon Appetit, purposely never filled out the male or female identification question. They repeatedly informed co-workers that they did not want to be identified using male or female gender pronouns and asked managers to address the employees as a group and educate them about gender identity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last=Green|first=Aimee|date=7 February 2014|title=Gender-neutral employee sues for $518,000; suit says employee wrongly referred to as woman|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2014/02/gender-neutral_employee_sues_f.html|work=The Oregonian|publisher=Oregon Live|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones's suit states that the complaint to human resources was never resolved and the managers did not follow through per their requests, prompting their resignation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Zzyym v. Tillerson'' ===
In September 2014, [[Dana Zzyym]], an American U.S. veteran, tried to apply for a passport. Instead of labeling their gender as male or female on the application form, they "wrote 'intersex' below the 'sex' category" and "requested 'X' as an acceptable marker."&lt;ref&gt;United States District Court for the District of Colorado. ''Zzyym v. Kerry''. 22 Nov. 2016. ''LexisNexis Academic [LexisNexis]'', advance.lexis.com/search/?pdmfid=1516831&amp;crid=bf589987-5931-449f-8065-3b388e99a8d5&amp;pdsearchterms=Zzyym+v.+Kerry%2C+220+F.+Supp.+3d+1106&amp;pdstartin=hlct%3A1%3A8&amp;pdtypeofsearch=searchboxclick&amp;pdsearchtype=SearchBox&amp;pdqttype=and&amp;pdpsf=&amp;ecomp=48sgkgk&amp;earg=pdpsf&amp;prid=020ba714-a3d4-4935-8c13-f58494abafae.&lt;/ref&gt; They presented a birth certificate which labels Zzyym as neither male nor female. Zzyym was born with ambiguous genitalia and identifies as intersex. The State Department declined Zzyym's application. They have sued the State Department, "saying the federal government violated the Constitution's guarantees of due process rights and discriminated against Zzyym based on gender."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-intersex-lawsuit-20160720-snap-story.html|title=Intersex person who was denied a passport over gender designation sues U.S. government|last=Branson-Potts|first=Hailey|website=latimes.com|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2016, the court issued the ruling in favor of Zzyym. But {{as of|2017|October|lc=y}}, the case has been reopened due to the State Department's continued refusal of a gender marker that is neither male nor female on its passport applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/a/us-state-department-intersex-persons-lawsuit/4087623.html|title=US State Department in Solidarity With Intersex Persons but Faces Lawsuit|last=Saine|first=Cindy|work=VOA|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jamie Shupe ===
On April 27, 2016, [[Jamie Shupe]] filed a petition to no longer assume the designation of male or female. Shupe, a retired United States Army sergeant, was born with male anatomy and changed their gender to female later in life. But Shupe still struggled finding their gender identity in the confines of either being male or female. As time progressed, Shupe recognized as being of non-binary gender status. When they brought the petition to court, Judge Amy Holmes Hehn granted the position of approving non-binary as a legal gender designation by saying: "the sex of Jamie Shupe is hereby changed from female to non-binary. Notice of this legal change shall be posted in a public place in Multnomah County as required by law."&lt;ref&gt;Hanssen, Shelby. “NOTE: Beyond Male or Female: Using Nonbinary Gender Identity to Confront Outdated Notions of Sex and Gender in the Law.” ''LexisNexis'', RELX Group, 2017, advance.lexis.com/document/searchwithindocument/?pdmfid=1516831&amp;crid=61a918dc-fdf2-48b0-a47e-36a745c20ad2&amp;pdsearchwithinterm=jamie%2Bshupe&amp;ecomp=5gLdk&amp;prid=8ac71439-8bd4-4891-9085-2a78d90d0e89.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Shupe's medical records affirmed that they were neither male nor female and the ambiguity of the statute did not require transition, Judge Holmes Hehn was able to grant Shupe's request. Shupe's accomplishment is a significant advance toward government recognition of non-binary individuals.

==Criticism==

Much as with [[Color blindness (race)|similar approaches to dealing with racism and ethnicity]], not recognising and taking account of participants' sex can be harmful. It posits that it functions in a post-sexism society where women are no longer treated differently than men on the basis of their sex. Meanwhile, gendered treatment prevails all over the world. Of a study of organisations which offered women-only services, 23% said that their reason was based on women's inequality and the desire to address that imbalance; 20% that women-only spaces promote female development and empowerment; 18% that they were providing a service not being met by unisex services and which focused on the specific needs of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Women-only services: making the case. A guide for women’s organisations|date=July 2011|publisher=Women's Resource Centre|page=18|url=https://thewomensresourcecentre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/Making-the-case-for-women-only-July-2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal test of the "reasonable person" has been criticised for being genderblind to be applied in some areas of the law, particularly sexual harassment. Women are subjected to more normalised and endemic sexual harassment than men. On the grounds of this, the American case of ''Ellison v. Brady'' 924 F.2d 872 (1991), the court held that "a sex-blind reasonable person standard tends to be male-based and tends to systematically ignore the experiences of women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=McCammon,|editor1-first=Holly J.|editor2-last=Taylor|editor2-first=Verta|editor3-last=Reger|editor3-first=Jo|editor4-last=Einwohner|editor4-first=Rachel L.|title=The Oxford Handbook of U.S. Women's Social Movement Activism|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies indicate a broad support for single-sex service options to remain available. Of 1000 women polled by the Women's Resource Centre, 97% stated that women should have the option of accessing female-only services if they were victims of sexual assault. 57% indicated that they would choose a women-only gym over a mixed gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Women-only services: making the case.

'''Graded absolutism''' is a theory of [[moral absolutism]] in [[Christian ethics]] which resolves the objection to absolutism that in moral conflicts we are obligated to opposites.  Moral absolutism is the [[Ethics|ethical]] view that certain actions are absolutely right or wrong regardless of other contexts such as their consequences or the intentions behind them.  Graded absolutism is moral absolutism but qualifies that a moral absolute, like "Do not kill," can be greater or lesser than another moral absolute, like "Do not lie". Also called contextual absolutism or the greater good view, is an alternative to the third alternative view and the [[Lesser of two evils principle|lesser evil view]], both discussed below, regarding moral conflict resolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

According to graded absolutism, in [[Ethical dilemma|moral conflicts]], the dilemma is not that we are obligated to opposites, because greater absolutes are not opposites of lesser absolutes, and evil is not the opposite of good but is instead the privation of good.  Since evil is the privation of good, only the privation of the greater good counts as evil, since whenever there is a moral conflict, we are only obligated to the greater good.  The real dilemma is that we cannot perform both conflicting absolutes at the same time.  'Which' absolutes are in conflict depends on the context, but which conflicting absolute is ‘greater’ does not depend on the context. That is why graded absolutism is also called 'contextual absolutism' but is not to be confused with [[situational ethics]]. The conflict is resolved in acting according to the greater absolute. That is why graded absolutism is also called the 'greater good view', but is not to be confused with [[utilitarianism]].

==The third alternative view==

This is the view that there are never any real moral conflicts and that there is always a third alternative. For example, instead of answering in the affirmative or negative to the Nazi at the door, one may simply withhold an answer.

==The lesser evil view==

[[Lesser of two evils principle|The lesser evil view]] is the view that the only way out of a moral conflict is to violate one of the moral absolutes and choose the lesser evil.  For example, if we disagree with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s thoughts on the [[categorical imperative]] and say that lying is a lesser evil than helping a would-be murderer, the lesser evil view would have us lie rather than help a would-be murderer.  According to the proponent of graded absolutism, this violates the [[ought implies can]] principle and defeats itself in obligating evil.

==The greater good view==

The greater good view is the view that there are real moral conflicts between absolutes, but rather than requiring a third alternative (as in the case of the third alternative view above) or obligating evil (as in the case of the lesser evil view above), this view obligates the greater absolute, or greater good.  For example, when one saves a life rather than telling the truth to a would-be murderer, one is committing the greater good of saving life, rather than violating the lesser good of telling the truth or committing the lesser (than aiding a murderer) evil of lying.  Since evil is the privation of good, only the privation of the greater good counts as evil, since whenever there is a moral conflict, we are only obligated to the greater good.

'''Graeme Donald Snooks''' (born 1944 in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]]) is a systems theorist and stratologist who has developed a general dynamic theory to explain complex [[living systems]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sites.google.com/site/graemesnooks/]&lt;/ref&gt; His resulting "dynamic-strategy theory" has been employed to analyse the fluctuating fortunes of life over the past 4,000 million years (myrs) and of human society over the past 2 myrs; to analyse contemporary economic problems (inflation,&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; financial crises,&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP007.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; climate change&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;); to explore socio-political issues (population expansion, the emergence of democracy, the "clash of civilizations"); to analyse the emergence, operation, and malfunction of the mind; and to make scientific predictions about the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/pdf/GDSC/WP010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; New discoveries emerging from Snooks' publications include: '''existential schizophrenia''', '''strategic frustration''', '''strategic selection''', the '''growth-inflation curve''', the '''strategy function''', the '''logological constant''' (akin to the cosmological constant), the '''Snooks–Panov Vertical''', '''technological paradigm shifts''', the '''Solar Revolution''', and, most importantly, the '''strategic ''logos'''''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''. His body of work challenges the existing paradigms of orthodox (neo-classical) [[economics]], climate-mitigation economics, [[Marxism]], neo-[[Darwinism]], [[evolutionary psychology]], self-organisation theory, and all other supply-side systems.''

For twenty-one years, from 1989 to 2010, Graeme Snooks was the foundation Coghlan Research Professor of Economics in the [[Institute of Advanced Studies]] at the [[Australian National University]]. Currently he is the Executive Director of both the '''Institute of Global Dynamic Systems''' and '''IGDS Books'''&lt;ref&gt;http://econrsss.anu.edu.au/GDSCpapers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in Canberra. He was educated at [[Mount Lawley Senior High School]] (1957–1961), the [[University of Western Australia]] (BEc,1966; MEc, 1968), and the [[Australian National University]] (PhD, 1972). Professor Snooks has been elected Fellow of the Australian Academy of Social Sciences (1991), Fellow of the Royal Historical Society (UK) (1990), and Fellow of the Russian Academy of Humanities (2006).

==Books and articles==
[[File: Graeme Donald Snooks, Canberra, May 2013.jpg|thumb|'''Graeme Donald Snooks''', May 2013]]
Professor Snooks has published 30 books, including: ''Depression and Recovery'' (1974), ''Domesday Economy'' (with J. McDonald) (1986), ''Economics Without Time'' (1993), ''Historical Analysis in Economics'' (1993), ''Portrait of the Family within the Total Economy'' (1994), ''Was the Industrial Revolution Necessary?'', (1994), ''The Dynamic Society'' (1996), ''The Ephemeral Civilization'' (1997), ''The Laws of History'' (1998), ''Longrun Dynamics'' (1998), ''Global Transition'' (1999), ''The Global Crisis Makers'' (2000), ''The Collapse of Darwinism'' (2003), ''The Selfcreating Mind'' (2006), ''The Coming Eclipse, or The Triumph of Climate Mitigation Over Solar Revolution'' (2010),&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/graemesnooks/home/books/the-coming-eclipse]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dead God Rising. Religion and Science in the Universal Life-System'' (2010).,&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/graemesnooks/home/books/dead-god-rising-1]&lt;/ref&gt; , ''The Death of Zarathustra. Notes on Truth for the Risk-Taker'' (2011), ''Ark of the Sun: the improbable voyage of life'' (November 2015), ''Ultimate Reality &amp; its Dissidents'' (March 2016), and ''Time's Gateway: a personal quest for ultimate reality'' (August 2017). 

Graeme Snooks' recent book, '''Ark of the Sun''' provides an overview of his thinking over five decades on the dynamics of life and human society and reveals the underlying reality of life - the strategic '''''logos''''' - which is the ultimate complex living system. '''Ultimate Reality &amp; its Dissidents''' provides a unique philosophy of life based on his realist general dynamic theory. And '''Time's Gateway''' shows how these ideas emerged over the past fifty years. He is currently exploring two major issues. First, the existential dangers of metaphysical systems of thought to the survival of humanity, together with the corrective contribution of realist thinking. And second, the contribution of DNA testing to the exploration of societal dynamics over the past 60,000 years. 

Articles on the theory of complex living systems have been published by Snooks in ''Advances in Space Research'' (2005), ''Complexity'' (the journal of the [[Santa Fe Institute]]) (2008), and [[Social Evolution &amp; History]] (2002, 2005, 2007). In a recent (11 November 2016) article - '''The Triumph of Trump and the failure of the intellectuals''' - he applies the dynamic-strategy theory to the recent US Presidential election (see Graeme Snooks, Researchgate) and provides suggestions for the type of dynamic strategy that the USA would need to pursue in order to "make America great again" and to position itself at the forefront of the forthcoming technological paradigm shift.

'''Green consumption''', is closely related to the notions of [[sustainable development]] or [[sustainable consumer behaviour]]. It is a form of consumption that is compatible with the safeguard of the environment for the present and for the next generations. It is a concept which ascribes to consumers responsibility or co-responsibility for addressing environmental problems through adoption of environmentally friendly behaviors, such as the use of organic products, clean and [[renewable energy]] and the research of goods produced by companies with zero, or almost, impact.&lt;ref&gt;J. Connoly, A. Prothero, 2008, Green consumption: life-politics, risk and contradictions, Journal of consumer culture, vol. 8, pp. 117-145&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In Western societies, during the ‘60s and the early ‘70s, the necessity to protect the environment and the people health from the effects caused by industrial pollutants and by the continuous growth of economic and population has developed this new idea of consumption. In the 1980s first American "green" brands began to appear and exploded on the American market. During the 1990s green products had a slow mild growth, remaining a niche phenomenon. American interest in green products . started to increase again in the early 2000s with greater speed and, despite the latest recession, it has been continuing to grow.&lt;ref&gt;R.Elliott, 2013, The taste for green:the possibilities and dynamics of status differentiation through "green" consumption, Sci Verse ScienceDirect, ELSEVIER, vol. 41, pp. 294-322&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and development ==
The origin of the necessity to behave in an environmental-friendly way goes back to the 1960s and '70s. In particular after the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis of 1973]], Western countries start to think about the use of renewable energy, as an alternative to fuel fossil. Nowadays green consumption is considered a basic point of environmental reform and it is also guarantee by supra-national organizations like European Union.  Some sociologist argue that after the increasing [[globalization]], people feel more interconnected with other people and the environment, so there has been increasing awareness of global [[environmental problems]], especially in western countries. 
The main forums in which the issue has been discussed, and provided guidelines to orient national governments are: [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment]]; [[International Union for Conservation of Nature#World Conservation Strategy|IUCN 1980 World Conservation Strategy]]; [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development in 1983 and 1987 Brundtland Report]]; Italy 1993 National Plan for Sustainable Development; Aalborg 1994, 1st European Conference on Sustainable Cities; Lisbon 1996, 2nd European Conference on Sustainable Cities; Hannover 2000, 3rd Conference on Sustainable Cities; European Union in 2001, VI Environmental Action Plan 2002/2010; Aalborg +10 and the Aalborg Commitments in 2004.

== Pro-environmental behavior ==
Green consumer behavior is a form of pro-environmental behavior, which can be defined as a form of consumption that harms the environment as little as possible, or even benefits the environment.&lt;ref&gt;L. Steg, C. Vlek, 2009, Encouraging pro-environmental behaviour: An integrative review and research agenda, Journal of environmental psychology, vol. 29, pp. 309-317&lt;/ref&gt; Past research has provided empirical support to the claim that green or pro-environmental consumer behavior is a multidimensional construct&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt; which is composed of:

* "Private-sphere behavior" refers to the purchase, use and disposal of personal and household products that have environmental impact,&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Stern, 2000, Toward a coherent theory of environmentally significant behavior, Journal of social issues, vol. 53, no.3, pp. 407-424&lt;/ref&gt; such as automobiles, public transportation, or recycling&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Public-sphere behavior" refers to behavior that affects the environment directly through committed environmental activism or indirectly by influencing public policies,&lt;ref&gt;P. C. Stern, 2000, Toward a coherent theory of environmentally significant behavior, Journal of social issues, vol. 53, no.3, pp. 407-424&lt;/ref&gt; such as active involvement in environmental organizations and demonstrations (direct impact) or petitioning on environmental issues (indirect impact)&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt;

The contextual factors such as monetary incentives, costs, regulations, public policy norms, as well as subjectively perceived factors such as perceived resources available&lt;ref&gt;E. Olli, G. Grendstad, D. Wollebaek, 2001, Correlates of environmental behaviors: Bringing back social context, Environment and Behavior, vol. 33, no. 2, pp. 181-208&lt;/ref&gt; have a strong impact on consumer pro-environmental behavior and thus green consumption through the mediating effect of attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ertz, F. Karakas, E. Sarigollu, 2016, Exploring pro-environmental behaviors of consumers: An analysis of contextual factors, attitude, and behaviors, Journal of business research, vol. 69, no. 10, pp. 3971-3980&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, it is through attitude, that subjectively perceived contextual factors such as, for example, the extent to which consumers perceive having more or less time, money and power available, modulate pro-environmental behavior, in general, and green consumption, in particular.

== Green consumer behavior ==
We can define a green consumer behavior the one that has these characteristics:

* "purchase choice, product use and post-use, household management, collective, and consumer activism behaviors, reflecting some degree of environmental- related motivation";&lt;ref&gt;K. Peattie, 2010, Green consumption: behavior and norms, vol. 35, pp. 195-228&lt;/ref&gt;
* "purchase and use of products with lower environmental impacts, such as biodegradable products, recycled or reduced packaging, and low energy usage";&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on sustainable consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;
* use of organic product, made with processes that provide [[energy saving]], then by the action of [[recycling]], in fact a green consumer is "one who purchase products and services perceived to have a positive (or less negative) influence on the environment […]"&lt;ref&gt;K. Haws, R. Walker Naylor, K. Page Winterich, 2013, Seeing the world through GREEN- tinted Glasses: Green Consumption Values and Responses to Environmentally Friendly Products, Journal of Consumer Psychology&lt;/ref&gt; 
We can find a green consumer behavior when an individual acts ethically, motivated not only by his/her personal needs, but also by the respect and preservation of the welfare of entire society, because a green consumer takes into account the environmental consequences (costs and benefits) of his/her private consumption. Green consumers are expected to be more conscientious in their use of assets, for example by using their goods without wasting resources. 
However the Eurobarometer’s survey of consumers’ behavior (2013) showed that consumers seem not to be fully conscious of the importance to adopt a set of new behaviors, that are more environmental-friendly. In this report it is possible to find that even though a very high proportion of citizens buy green products (80%), more than a half are classified as occasional maintenance (54%), and only a quarter are regular buyer of green products (26%).
This fact implies that most of people do not behave like green consumer continuously, probably because of a lot of social and economic constraints, such as the fact that green products are much more expensive than non-green ones, and also because it is not always so easy to find organic and [[biological]] goods for each category, and because the green-retailers are not so widespread. Some researchers find that personal values are influential determinants of consumption and that pro-environmental behavior might serve as a signal of personality dimension. Considering the time-horizon in the acquisition of green behavior, we can distinguish two types of consumers:

# prevention-type consumers, that feel a moral duty towards a greener lifestyle
# promotion-type, that are more focused on their aspirations and their dreams and don't strongly feel the pressure to quickly adjust their behavior in the direction of becoming more environmental-friendly.&lt;ref&gt;G. Bertoli, M. Bonera, A. Codini, E. Corvi, G. Miniero, 2014, Being green: from attitude to actual consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 521-528&lt;/ref&gt;
Another research find the effect of gender and [[social identity]] on green consumption: "female declared higher levels of sustainable consumption compared with male participants; however when social identity is salient, male increased their [[sustainable consumption]] intentions to the same level as female.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on sustainable consumption, International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;  In this research are identified two kind of people, that have more:

# self-transcendent values, like woman, that are more willing to engage in sustainable consumption
# self-enhanced values, like men, that are less interested in green behavior

The fact is that sustainable consumption is, for men, a way to reinforce their social image, showing to others that they care about environment, instead for women is intrinsically important. The evidence is that green consumers are mainly female, aged between 30 and 44 years old, well educated, in a household with a high annual income.&lt;ref&gt;D. C. Pinto, M. M. Herter, P. Rossi, A. Borges, 2014, Going green for self or for others? Gender and identity salience effects on [[sustainable consumption]], International Journal of Consumer Studies, vol. 38, pp. 540-549&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principal areas of developed green consumption ==

=== [[Green energy]] ===
Green energy includes natural energetic processes that can be harnessed with little pollution.

=== Green food ===
In the food area, there is a recent growing of demand for less environmentally-damaging food production, that leads people to buy more [[organic food|organic]] and [[local food|local]] food.  
Organic food is produced through agriculture which does not use artificial chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and animals reared in more natural conditions, without the routine use of drugs, antibiotics and wormers common in intensive livestock farming. 
Consumers can also choose to buy local food in order to reduce the social and environmental impacts of "food miles" – the distance food travels between being produced and being consumed. This behavior can create a new sense of connection with the land, through a concern for the authenticity and provenience of the food eaten, operating a social as much as a technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;G. Seyfang, 2007, Growing sustainable consumption communities, The case of local organic food networks, International Journal of Sociology and social policy, vol. 27, pp. 120-134&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, taste, health and safety concerns can be other reasons behind this consumption practices.

=== Green fashion ===
{{Main article|Sustainable fashion}}
''"Ethical clothing refers to clothing that takes into consideration the impact of production and trade on the environment and on the people behind the clothes we wear. Eco clothing refers to all clothing that has been manufactured using environmentally friendly processes. It includes organic textiles and sustainable materials such as hemp and non-textiles such as bamboo or recycled plastic bottles. It also includes recycled products (clothes made from recycled clothing including vintage, textile and other materials and can also be termed re-used) and is not necessarily made from organic fibers. Organic clothing means clothes that have been made with a minimum use of chemicals and with minimum damage to the environment and fair-trade is intended to achieve better prices, decent working conditions, local sustainability and fair terms for farmers and workers in the developing world".''&lt;ref&gt;M.C Cervellon, H. Hjerth, S. Ricard, L. Carey, 2010, GREEN IN FASHION? An exploratory study of national differences in consumers concern for eco-fashion, Paper presented at 9th International Marketing Trends Conference, Venice, Italy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The three main reasons that would motivate the purchase of organic cloths are:
* Environmental -friendly protection;
* Health impact;
* Ethical concerns.

Another important question is related to the textile and clothing industry that generates much pollution and consumes a large amount of resources. Improper uses and disposal of clothing products make the problems much more severe. 
Consumers are concerned about this (environmental) issues, and are best motivated to change their behaviors in a [[philanthropic]] or environmental-friendly actions that adapt with their financial and sustainability interests.
An intuitive and sustainable strategy is the reusing cloths. Textile recycling is a method of reprocessing used clothing, fibrous material and clothing scraps from the manufacturing process. This can reduce manufacturing pollution and [[resource consumption]].&lt;ref&gt;Z. H. Hu, Q. Li, X. J. Chen, Y. F. Wang, 2014, Sustainable Rent-Based Closed-Loop Supply Chain for Fashion Products, Sustainability, vol. 6, pp. 7063-7088&lt;/ref&gt;  The world is facing one of the worst economic crises ever, which affects all industries, including fashion and luxury. In this way moderate consumption is becoming an implicit rules.&lt;ref&gt;M.C Cervellon, H. Hjerth, S. Ricard, L. Carey, 2010, GREEN IN FASHION? An exploratory study of national differences in consumers concern for eco-fashion, Paper presented at 9th International Marketing Trends Conference, Venice, Italy&lt;/ref&gt;  
Consumers pay attention to the origin and the materials of the clothes they buy and the fact that they are not harmful to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton incorporated: http://www.cottoninc.com/corporate/Market-Data/SupplyChainInsights/consumer-perspectives-on-green-apparel/&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the issue of trust arises and a label certifying the organic origin is strongly required. 
But consumers often have a lack of information of green fashion or maybe they are unaware of the existence of green fashion alternatives to traditional adult fashion. 
Thus, there is a need to create awareness and inform better the consumers on the nature of organic fashion.

{{Campaignbox Norman Conquest}}



The '''Harrying of the North''' was a number of campaigns 
waged by [[William the Conqueror]] in the winter of 1069–70 to subjugate [[northern England]], where the presence of the last [[House of Wessex|Wessex]] claimant, [[Edgar the Atheling|Edgar Atheling]], had encouraged Anglo-Danish rebellions. William paid the Danes to go home, but the remaining rebels refused to meet him in battle, and he decided to starve them out by laying waste to the northern shires, especially the city of [[York]], before installing a Norman aristocracy throughout the region.

Contemporary chronicles vividly record the savagery of the campaign, the huge scale of the destruction and the widespread famine caused by looting, burning and slaughtering. Some present-day scholars have labelled the campaigns a [[genocide]] although others doubt whether William could have assembled enough troops to inflict so much damage and they have concluded that the records may have been exaggerated or misinterpreted.

==Background==
{{see also|Gwynedd in the High Middle Ages#Mathrafal ascendency and English alliances; 1063–1081|l1=Gwynedd's alliance with Mercia and Northumbria}}
At the time of the Norman Conquest ''the North'' consisted of what became [[Yorkshire]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], and [[Northumberland]] in the east and [[Lancashire]] with the southern parts of [[Cumberland]] and [[Westmorland]] in the west.&lt;ref name=kapell5&gt;William E. Kapelle, The Norman Conquest of the North. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The population of the north pre-conquest can be described as "[[Anglo-Scandinavian]]" carrying a cultural continuity from a mixing of [[Viking]] and Anglo-Saxon traditions. The dialect of [[Old English|English]] spoken in Yorkshire may well have been unintelligible to people from the south of England, and the aristocracy was primarily [[Danish people|Danish]] in origin.&lt;ref name=kapelle11&gt;Kapelle, pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, communications between the north and south were difficult, partly due to the terrain but also because of the poor state of the roads. The more popular route between York and the south was by ship.&lt;ref name=kapelle7&gt;Kapelle, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 962 [[Edgar the Peaceful]] had granted legal autonomy to the northern earls of the [[Danelaw]] in return for their loyalty; this had limited the powers of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kings who succeeded him north of the [[Humber]]. The earldom of Northumbria stretched from the [[River Tees|Tees]] to the [[River Tweed|Tweed]].&lt;ref name=kapelle11/&gt;

After the defeat of the English army and death of [[Harold Godwinson]] at the [[Battle of Hastings]], English resistance to the conquest was centred on [[Edgar Ætheling]], the grandson of [[Edmund Ironside]]. Ironside was half-brother to [[Edward the Confessor]].&lt;ref name="horspool5"&gt;Horspool. ''The English Rebel'', pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; It is said the English conceded defeat, not at [[Hastings]], but at [[Berkhamsted]] two months later when Edgar and his supporters submitted to William in December 1066.&lt;ref name="horspool5"/&gt; However, of all the men who submitted to William at Berkhamsted it was only [[Ealdred (bishop)|Ealdred]], [[Bishop of York]], who would remain loyal to the Norman king.&lt;ref name=horspool7&gt;Horspool, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; William faced a series of rebellions and border skirmishes in [[Dover]], [[Exeter]], [[Hereford]], [[Nottingham]], Durham, [[York]] and [[Peterborough]].&lt;ref name=horspool8&gt;Horspool, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Baile Hill - geograph.org.uk - 765177.jpg|thumb|left|Remains of the [[Motte-and-bailey castle|motte]] at [[Baile Hill, York]] 1068–69.]]
[[Copsi]], a supporter of [[Tostig]] (a previous Anglo-Saxon earl of Northumbria who had been banished by Edward the Confessor), was a native of Northumbria and his family had a history of being rulers of [[Bernicia]], and at times Northumbria. Copsi had fought in [[Harald Hardrada]]'s army with Tostig, against Harold Godwinson at the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] in 1066. He had managed to escape after Harald's defeat. When Copsi offered homage to William at [[Barking, London|Barking]] in 1067, William rewarded him by making him earl of Northumbria.&lt;ref name=kapelle103&gt;Kapelle, pp. 103–06.&lt;/ref&gt;

After just five weeks as earl, Copsi was murdered by [[Osulf, Earl of Bamburgh|Osulf]], son of Earl [[Eadulf III of Bernicia]]. When, in turn, the usurping Osulf was also killed, his cousin, [[Cospatrick of Northumbria|Cospatrick]], bought the earldom from William. He was not long in power before he joined [[Edgar Ætheling]] in rebellion against William in 1068.&lt;ref name=kapelle103/&gt;

With two earls murdered and one changing sides, William decided to intervene personally in Northumbria.&lt;ref name=horspool10&gt;Horspool, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; He marched north and arrived in York during the summer of 1068. The opposition melted away, with some of them&amp;nbsp;– including Edgar&amp;nbsp;– taking refuge at the court of the [[Malcolm III of Scotland|Scottish king Malcolm III]].&lt;ref name=stenton606&gt;Stenton, ''Anglo-Saxon England'', pg. 606&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in Northumbria, William changed tack and appointed a Norman, [[Robert de Comines]], as earl, rather than an Anglo-Saxon. Despite warnings from the [[bishop of Durham|bishop]], [[Ethelwin]], that a rebel army was mobilised against him, Robert rode into Durham with a party of men on 28 January 1069, where he and his men were surrounded and slaughtered.&lt;ref name=asc1068&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' 1068. English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html Project Gutenberg]; accessdate 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels then turned their attention to York where they killed the guardian of the [[York Castle|castle]] there plus a large number of his men.&lt;ref name=horspool10/&gt;&lt;ref name=asc1068/&gt; William's response was swift and brutal: he returned to York, where he fell on the besiegers, killing or putting them to flight.&lt;ref name=horspool11&gt;Horspool, ''The English Rebel'', pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly emboldened by the fighting in the north, rebellions broke out in other parts of the country. William sent earls to deal with problems in [[Dorset]], [[Shrewsbury]] and [[Devon]], while he dealt with rebels in the [[The Midlands|Midlands]] and [[Stafford]].&lt;ref name=horspool12&gt;Horspool. ''The English Rebel''. pg. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgar Ætheling had sought assistance from the [[king of Denmark]], [[Sweyn Estridson|Sweyn II]], a nephew of [[Canute the Great|King Canute]]. Sweyn assembled a fleet of ships under the command of his sons. The fleet sailed up the east coast of England raiding as they went. The [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] with their English allies retook the city of York.&lt;ref name=asc1069&gt;''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' 1069. English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html Project Gutenberg]; accessdate 26 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in the winter of 1069, William marched his army from Nottingham to York with the intention of engaging the rebel army. However, by the time William's army had reached York, the rebel army had fled, with Edgar returning to Scotland. As they had nowhere suitable on land to stay for the winter, the Danes decided to go back to their ships in the [[Humber Estuary]]. After negotiation with William, it was agreed that, if he made payment to them, then they would go home to [[Denmark]] without a fight.&lt;ref name=kapelle117&gt;Kapelle, pg. 117&lt;/ref&gt; With the Danes having returned home, William's patience with the rebels seems to have run out. As they were not prepared to meet his army in [[pitched battle]], he employed a strategy that would attack the rebel army's sources of support and their food supply.&lt;ref name=horspool12/&gt;

==The Harrying==
William's strategy, implemented during the winter of 1069–70 (he spent Christmas 1069 in York), has been described by [[William E. Kapelle]] and some other modern scholars as an act of [[genocide]].&lt;ref name=kapelle3&gt;Kapelle, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rex108&gt;Rex.

Contemporary biographers of William considered it to be his cruelest act and a "stain upon his soul".&lt;ref name=dalton298&gt;Dalton. ''Conquest, Anarchy and Lordship: Yorkshire, 1066–1154''. pg. 298&lt;/ref&gt; Writing about the Harrying of the North, over fifty years later, the Anglo-Norman chronicler [[Orderic Vitalis]] wrote (summarized):{{quote|The King stopped at nothing to hunt his enemies. He cut down many people and destroyed homes and land. Nowhere else had he shown such cruelty. This made a real change.
To his shame, William made no effort to control his fury, punishing the innocent with the guilty. He ordered that crops and herds, tools and food be burned to ashes. More than 100,000 people perished of starvation.&lt;br&gt;I have often praised William in this book, but I can say nothing good about this brutal slaughter. God will punish him.&lt;ref name="vitalis28"&gt;Orderic Vitalis.

The land was ravaged on either side of William's route north from the [[River Aire]]. His army destroyed crops and settlements and forced rebels into hiding. In the New Year of 1070 he split his army into smaller units and sent them out to burn, loot, and terrify.&lt;ref name=dalto11&gt;Dalton, pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Florence of Worcester]] said  that from the Humber to the [[Tees]], William's men burnt whole villages and slaughtered the inhabitants. Food stores and livestock were destroyed so that anyone surviving the initial [[massacre]] would succumb to starvation over the winter. The survivors were reduced to [[cannibalism]].&lt;ref name=forester174&gt;Forester, Thomas. ''The Chronicle of Florence of Worcester'', pg. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Refugees from the harrying are mentioned as far away as [[Worcestershire]] in the [[Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham|Evesham Abbey chronicle]].&lt;ref name=horspool13&gt;Horspool, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stick274&gt;Strickland.

In 1086, Yorkshire and the North Riding still had large areas of waste territory. The Domesday Book entries indicate ''wasteas est'' or ''hoc est vast'' (''it is wasted'') for estate after estate; in all a total of 60% of all holdings were waste. It states that 66% of all villages contained wasted manors. Even the prosperous areas of the county had lost 60% of its value compared to 1066. Only 25% of the population and plough teams remained with a reported loss of 80,000 oxen and 150,000 people.&lt;ref name=muir120&gt;Muir. ''The Yorkshire Countryside'', pp. 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stric273&gt;Palmer, J.. "War and Domesday waste" in Strickland. ''Armies, chivalry and warfare in medieval Britain and France: proceedings of the 1995 Harlaxton Symposium'' (p. 273).&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent archaeological evidence supports the massive destruction and displacement of people. The archaeologist [[Richard Ernest Muir]] wrote that there was evidence for the "violent disruption [that] took place in Yorkshire in 1069–71, in the form of hoards of coins which were buried by the inhabitants."&lt;ref name=muir120/&gt; B.K. Roberts in his book ''The Making of the English Village'', suggests the reason that large numbers of villages have been laid out in regular pattern in Durham and  Yorkshire, was through a restructuring at a single point in time, as opposed to natural settlement growth. He goes on to say that it is highly unlikely that such plans could have resulted from piecemeal additions and must have been necessary after the Harrying of the North.  The dating is thought to be secure as it is known that Norman lords used similar regular plans in founding new towns in the 'plantation' of rural settlements in other conquered parts of the British Isles.&lt;ref name=oup126&gt;Hey. ''The Oxford Companion to family and local history''. pg. 126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=roberts178&gt;Roberts. ''The Making of the English Village'', pp. 212–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eh5&gt;Stamper. ''Introductions to Heritage Assets: Medieval Settlements'', pg. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although the Domesday Book records large numbers of manors in the north as waste, some historians have posited it was not possible for William's relatively small army to be responsible for such wide-scale devastation imputed to him, so perhaps raiding Danes {{efn|name=Florence|According to Florence of Worcester ".. [William] sent messengers to the Danish earl and promised to pay him secretly a large sum of money, and to grant permission for the Danish army to forage freely along the sea coast, on condition that the Danes would depart without fighting when the winter was over." &lt;ref name=forester173&gt;Forester, Thomas.

The ''Anglo-Saxon Chronicle'' MS E for 1079 said that Malcolm "ravaged Northumberland as far as the Tyne and killed many hundreds of people and took home much money and people into captivity".}} may have contributed to some of the destruction. It has been variously argued that ''waste'' signified manorial re-organisation, some form of tax break, or merely a confession of ignorance by the Domesday commissioners when unable to determine details of population and other manorial resources.&lt;ref name=thoms95&gt;Thomas.

According to Paul Dalton,&lt;ref name=dalto23/&gt; it was questionable whether the Conqueror had the time, manpower or good weather necessary to reduce the north to a desert. It was evident, from the chroniclers, that William did harry the north but as the bulk of William's troops, Dalton suggests, were guarding castles in southern England and Wales, and as William was only in the north for a maximum of three months, the amount of damage he could do was limited.&lt;ref name=dalto23/&gt;

Mark Hagger&lt;ref name=hagger100/&gt; suggests that in the words of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', William's Harrying of the North was "stern beyond measure"&lt;ref name=asc1087&gt;ASC 1087 - English translation at [http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/657/pg657.html Project Gutenberg]. Accessdate 21 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; but we should not describe it as genocide as William was acting by the [[Genocides in history|rules of his own time]], not ours.{{efn|name=moses28}}&lt;ref name=hagger100&gt;Hagger. ''William King and Conqueror'', pp. 100–01.&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetius, the Latin writer, wrote his treatise ''[[De Re Militari]]'' in the fourth century about Roman warfare, and posits that this still would have provided the basis for military thinking in the eleventh century.&lt;ref name=hagger100/&gt; Vegetius said ''The main and principal point in war is to secure plenty of provisions and to destroy the enemy by famine'', so Hagger's conclusion is that the Harrying of the North was no worse than other similar conflicts of the time.&lt;ref name=hagger100/&gt;&lt;ref name=vegetius&gt;Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus.

Other historians have questioned the figures supplied by Orderic Vitalis, who was born in 1075 and would have been writing his ''Ecclesiastical History'' around 55 years after the event. The figure of 100,000 deaths was perhaps used in a rhetorical sense, as the estimated population for the whole of England, based on the 1086 Domesday returns was about 2.25 million; thus, a figure of 100,000 represented a large proportion of the entire population of the country at that time (~4.5%).&lt;ref name=horspool13/&gt;&lt;ref name=muir120/&gt;&lt;ref name=bartlett291&gt;Bartlett. ''England Under the Norman and Angevin Kings'', pg. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Horspool]] concludes that despite the Harrying of the North, being regarded with some "shock" in Northern England for some centuries after the event, the destruction may have been exaggerated and the number of dead not as high as previously thought.&lt;ref name=horspool13/&gt;

In 1071 William appointed another Earl of Northumbria. This time it was [[William Walcher]], a [[Lotharingian]], who was the first non-English [[Bishop of Durham]].&lt;ref name=Handbook241&gt;Fryde, et al.

Having effectively subdued the population, William carried out a complete replacement of Anglo-Saxon leaders with Norman ones in the North. The new aristocracy in England was predominately of Norman extraction; however, one exception was that of [[Alan Rufus]], a trusted [[Breton people|Breton]] lord, who obtained in 1069–1071 a substantial fiefdom in North Yorkshire, which the [[Domesday Book]] calls "the Hundred of the Land of Count Alan", later known as [[Richmondshire]].&lt;ref name=barlow114&gt;Frank Barlow, ''The Feudal Kingdom of England, 1042–1216'' (London; New York: Longmans, Green, 1955), pg. 114, [https://www.questia.com/read/91383886 Questia.com] accessdate 27 August 2013.

Here Alan governed, as it were, his own principality: the only location held by the King in this area was [[Ainderby Steeple]] on its eastern edge, while Robert of Mortain held one village on its southern fringe; the other Norman lords were excluded, whereas Alan retained the surviving Anglo-Danish lords or their heirs. Alan also exercised patronage in York, where he founded [[St Mary's Abbey, York|St Mary's Abbey]] in 1088. By 1086 Alan was one of the richest and most powerful men in England.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Keats-Rohan "[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/52358 Alan Rufus (died 1093)]", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''; retrieved 27 August 2013.{{paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal link between the royal house of Scotland and [[Wessex]] was a threat to William, who marched up to Scotland in 1072 to confront the Scottish king. The two kings negotiated the [[Treaty of Abernethy]] (1072), through which, according to the ''Anglo Saxon Chronicle'', Malcolm became William's vassal; among the other provisions was the expulsion of Edgar Ætheling from the Scottish court.&lt;ref name=asc1072/&gt;&lt;ref name=huscroft61&gt;Huscroft. ''Ruling England, 1042–1217'', pg. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Edgar finally submitted to William in 1074. William's hold on the crown was then theoretically uncontested.&lt;ref name="huscroft61"/&gt;&lt;ref name=horspool14&gt;Horspool, pg. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1080 [[Walcher]], the Bishop of Durham, was murdered by the local Northumbrians. In response, William sent his half-brother [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]] north with an army to harry the Northumbrian countryside. Odo destroyed much land north of the Tees, from York to Durham, and stole valuable items from Durham monastery. Many of the Northumbrian nobility were driven into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Rollason. ''Libellus de Exordio.'' pp. 218–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the depopulation, Norman landowners sought settlers to work in the fields. Evidence suggests that such barons were willing to rent lands to any men not obviously disloyal. Unlike the [[Vikings]] in the centuries before, Normans did not settle wholesale in the shire, but only occupied the upper ranks of society. This allowed an Anglo-Scandinavian culture to survive beneath Norman rule. Evidence for continuity can be seen in the retention of many cultural traits:{{quote|Many personal names of a pre-conquest character appear in charters that date from the 11th to the 13th century. The vigorous northern literary tradition in the Middle English period and its distinctive dialect also suggest the survival of an Anglo-Scandinavian population. The relative scarcity of Norman place-names implies that the new settlers came in only at the top rank. Domesday Book shows that at this level, however, Norman takeover in Yorkshire was virtually complete.&lt;ref name=hey19&gt;Hey. ''Yorkshire from AD 1000.'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Normans used the church as an agent of colonisation and, post-1070, founded several monasteries in the north. There had been no monasteries north of [[Burton upon Trent]] before the harrying.&lt;ref name=harper171/&gt; Of the monasteries built, Fountains Abbey became one of the largest and richest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Fountains Abbey History|url=http://cistercians.shef.ac.uk/fountains/|publisher=University of Sheffield|accessdate=1 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the foundation of the northern monasteries, the Normans increased the number of [[motte-and-bailey castle]]s they built there.&lt;ref name=harper171/&gt;

From the Norman point of view, the Harrying of the North was a successful strategy, as large areas, including [[Cheshire]], [[Shropshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and [[Staffordshire]] were devastated, and the Domesday Book confirms this, although in those counties it was not as complete as in Yorkshire. The object of the harrying was to prevent further revolts in [[Mercia]] and Northumbria; however, it did not prevent rebellions elsewhere.&lt;ref name=stenton605&gt;Stenton. ''Anglo-Saxon England.'' pg. 605.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huscroft60&gt;Huscroft. ''Ruling England, 1042–1217.'' pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
According to literary theorist [[Rita Felski]], it is "a distinctively modern style of interpretation that circumvents obvious or self-evident meanings in order to draw out less visible and less flattering truths;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"{{bracket|Marx, Freud, and Nietzsche}} share a commitment to unmasking 'the lies and [[illusion]]s of [[consciousness]]'; they are the architects of a distinctively modern style of interpretation that circumvents obvious or self-evident meanings in order to draw out less visible and less flattering truths ...

Felski also notes that "The 'hermeneutics of suspicion' is the name usually bestowed on [a] technique of reading texts against the grain and between the lines, of cataloging their omissions and laying bare their contradictions, of rubbing in what they fail to know and cannot represent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Felski |first=Rita |title=Context Stinks |url=http://kclunc19.web.unc.edu/files/2014/10/FelskiRita-Context-Stinks.pdf |journal=[[New Literary History]] |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location=[[Baltimore, Maryland]] |date=Autumn 2011 |volume=42 |issue=4 |pages=573-591 |doi=10.1353/nlh.2011.0045}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that sense, it can be seen as being related to [[Critique of ideology|ideology critique]].

[[Ruthellen Josselson]] explains that "Ricoeur distinguishes between two forms of hermeneutics: a hermeneutics of faith which aims to restore meaning to a text and a hermeneutics of suspicion which attempts to decode meanings that are disguised."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://ruthellenjosselson.com/articles/josselson.ni.14-1.1e.pdf |first=Ruthellen |last=Josselson |authorlink=Ruthellen Josselson |title=The Hermeneutics of Faith and the Hermeneutics of Suspicion |journal=Narrative Inquiry |publisher=[[John Benjamins Publishing Company]] |location=[[Amsterdam]] |volume=14 |issue=1 |date=1 July 2004 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1075/ni.14.1.01jos |ISSN=1387-6740 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206142102/http://ruthellenjosselson.com/articles/josselson.ni.14-1.1e.pdf |archivedate=6 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4939">The '''hydrogen hypothesis''' is a model proposed by [[William F. Martin]] and Miklós Müller in 1998 that describes a possible way in which the [[mitochondrion]] arose as an [[endosymbiont]] within an [[archaeon]] (without doubts classified as [[prokaryote]] at then times), giving rise to a [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] association of two cells from which the first [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic cell]] could have arisen ([[symbiogenesis]]).

According to the hydrogen hypothesis:&lt;ref name=EmbleyMartin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lane2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=LopezMoreira/&gt;&lt;ref name=MartinMuller/&gt;&lt;ref name=PoolePenny/&gt;
* The host that acquired the mitochondrion was a [[hydrogen]]-dependent archaeon, possibly similar in physiology to a modern [[methanogenic]] archaea, which use hydrogen and [[carbon dioxide]] to produce [[methane]];
* The future mitochondrion was a [[Facultative anaerobic|facultatively anaerobic]] [[Eubacteria|eubacterium]] which produced hydrogen and carbon dioxide as byproducts of [[anaerobic respiration]];
* A symbiotic relationship between the two started, based on the host's hydrogen dependence (anaerobic [[syntrophy]]).

==Mechanism==

The hypothesis differs from many alternative views within the [[endosymbiotic theory]] framework, which suggest that the first eukaryotic [[Cell (biology)|cells]] evolved a nucleus but lacked mitochondria, the latter arising as a eukaryote engulfed a primitive [[bacterium]] that eventually became the mitochondrion. The hypothesis attaches [[evolution]]ary significance to [[hydrogenosome]]s and provides a rationale for their common ancestry with mitochondria. Hydrogenosomes are anaerobic mitochondria that produce [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] by, as a rule, converting [[pyruvate]] into hydrogen, carbon dioxide and [[acetate]]. Examples from modern biology are known where methanogens cluster around hydrogenosomes within eukaryotic cells. Most theories within the [[endosymbiotic theory]] framework do not address the common ancestry of mitochondria and hydrogenosomes. The hypothesis provides a straightforward explanation for the observation that eukaryotes are genetic [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeras]] with genes of archaeal and eubacterial ancestry. Furthermore, it would imply that archaea and eukarya split after the modern groups of archaea appeared. Most theories within the [[endosymbiotic theory]] framework predict that some eukaryotes never possessed mitochondria. The hydrogen hypothesis predicts that no primitively mitochondrion-lacking eukaryotes ever existed. In the 15 years following the publication of the hydrogen hypothesis, this specific prediction has been tested many times and found to be in agreement with observation.&lt;ref name=EmbleyMartin&gt;{{cite journal | author=Embley TM and Martin W | title=Eukaryotic evolution, changes and challenges | journal=Nature | year=2006 | volume=440 | pages=623–630 | doi=10.1038/nature04546 | pmid=16572163 | issue=7084}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lane2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Lane, Nick |authorlink=Nick Lane |title=[[Power, Sex, Suicide: Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life]] |year=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-920564-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LopezMoreira&gt;{{cite journal |author=López-Garćia P and Moreira D | title=Metabolic symbiosis at the origin of eukaryotes | journal=Trends Biochem Sci | year=1999 | volume=24 | pages=88–93 | issue=3 | doi=10.1016/S0968-0004(98)01342-5 | pmid=10203753}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MartinMuller&gt;{{cite journal | author=Martin W and Müller M | title=The hydrogen hypothesis for the first eukaryote | journal=Nature | year=1998 | volume=392 | pages=37–41 | issue=6671  | doi=10.1038/32096 | pmid=9510246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PoolePenny&gt;{{cite journal | author=Poole AM and Penny D | title=Evaluating hypotheses for the origin of eukaryotes | journal=BioEssays | year=2007 | volume=29 | pages=74–84 | issue=1  | doi=10.1002/bies.20516 | pmid=17187354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the discovery and placement of the [[Lokiarchaeota]] (an archaeal lineage possessing an expanded genetic repertoire including genes involved in membrane remodeling and [[actin]] cytoskeletal structure) as the sister group to eukaryotes called into question particular tenets of the hydrogen hypothesis, as Lokiarchaeota appear to lack methanogenesis.&lt;ref name="SpangSaw2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spang |first1=Anja |last2=Saw |first2=Jimmy H. |last3=Jørgensen |first3=Steffen L. |last4=Zaremba-Niedzwiedzka |first4=Katarzyna |last5=Martijn |first5=Joran |last6=Lind |first6=Anders E.|last7=van Eijk |first7=Roel |last8=Schleper|first8=Christa |last9=Guy |first9=Lionel |last10=Ettema |first10=Thijs J.

'''Hyperlink cinema''' is a term coined by author [[Alissa Quart]], who used the term in her review of the film ''[[Happy Endings (film)|Happy Endings]]'' (2005) for the film journal ''[[Film Comment]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name=quart&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] popularized the term when reviewing the film ''[[Syriana]]'' in 2005.&lt;ref name=ebert-syriana&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate =July 25, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt; These films are not [[hypermedia]] and do not have actual [[hyperlink]]s, but are multilinear in a more metaphorical sense.

In describing ''Happy Endings'', Quart considers captions acting as [[footnote]]s and [[Split screen (film)|split screen]] as elements of hyperlink cinema and notes the influence of the [[World Wide Web]] and [[Human multitasking|multitasking]].&lt;ref name="quart" /&gt; Playing with time and characters' personal history, [[plot twist]]s, interwoven storylines between multiple characters, jumping between the beginning and end ([[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] and [[flashforward]]) are also elements.&lt;ref name="quart" /&gt; Ebert further described hyperlink cinema as films where the characters or action reside in separate stories, but a connection or influence between those disparate stories is slowly revealed to the audience; illustrated in Mexican director [[Alejandro González Iñárritu|Alejandro González Iñárritu's]] films ''[[Amores perros]]'' (2000), ''[[21 Grams]]'' (2003), and ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'' (2006).&lt;ref name="ebert-syriana" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ebert-babel" /&gt;

Quart suggests that director [[Robert Altman]] created the structure for the genre and demonstrated its usefulness for combining interlocking stories in his films ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'' (1975) and ''[[Short Cuts]]'' (1993).&lt;ref name="MovieYearbook2007"&gt;[[Roger Ebert|Ebert, Roger]] (2006). ''Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2007''. Andrews McMeel Publishing. p. 100. {{ISBN|0-7407-6157-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Jean Renoir|Jean Renoir's]] 1939 ''[[The Rules of the Game ]]'' first used a narrative structure based on multiple characters and predates Altman's ''Nashville'' by 36 years.&lt;ref name="amc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amc.com/movie/1962/Kanchenjungha|title=Kanchenjungha|work=AMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quart also mentions the television series ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'' and discusses [[Alan Rudolph]]'s film ''[[Welcome to L.A.]]'' (1976) as an early prototype.&lt;ref name="quart"/&gt; ''[[Crash (2004 film)|Crash]]'' (2004) is an example of the genre, as are [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Traffic (2000 film)|Traffic]]'' (2000), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' (2002), ''[[Syriana]]'' (2005) ''[[Nine Lives (2005 film)|Nine Lives]]'' (2005) and ''[[Odu Raja Odu]]'' (2018).&lt;ref name="MovieYearbook2007" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/odu-raja-odu--a-black-comedy-that-is-watchable-review-tamil-siqvNtidjiifd.html|title=Review : Odu Raja Odu -A black comedy that is watchable (2018)|website=www.sify.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
The hyperlink cinema narrative and story structure can be compared to social science's [[spatial analysis]]. As described by Edward Soja and Costis Hadjimichalis spatial analysis examines the "'horizontal experience'  of human life, the spatial dimension of individual behavior and social relations, as opposed to the 'vertical experience' of history, tradition, and biography."&lt;ref name="Soja-p59-67"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soja |first=Edward W. |last2=Hadjimichalis |first2=Costis |year=1979 |title=Between Geographical Materialism and Spatial Fetishism: Some Observations on the Development of Marxist Spatial Analysis |journal=Antipode |volume=17 |issue=2–3 |pages=59–67 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.1985.tb00334.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; English critic [[John Berger]] notes for the novel that "it is scarcely any longer possible to tell a straight story sequentially unfolding in time" for "we are too aware of what is continually traversing the story line laterally."&lt;ref name="Soja-p59-67" /&gt;

An academic analysis of hyperlink cinema appeared in the journal ''Critical Studies in Media Communication,'' and referred to the films as Global Network Films. Narine's study examines the films ''Traffic'' (2000), ''Amores perros'' (2000), ''21 Grams'' (2003), ''Beyond Borders'' (2003), ''Crash'' (2004; released 2005), ''Syriana'' (2005), ''Babel'' (2006) and others, citing network theorist [[Manuel Castells]] and philosophers [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]]. The study suggests that the films are network narratives that map the [[network society]] and the new connections citizens experience in the age of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Narine |first=Neil |title=Global Trauma and the Cinematic Network Society |journal=Critical Studies in Media Communication |volume=27 |issue=3 |year=2010 |pages=209–234 |doi=10.1080/15295030903583556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hyperlink television ==

An extension to hyperlink cinema has been proposed by [[Robert K. Logan]] and Emma Findlay-White to suggest that hyperlink television has many of the properties of hyperlink cinema in that it also plays with time and characters' personal history, [[plot twist]]s, contains interwoven storylines between multiple characters, jumps between the beginning and end ([[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] and [[flashforward]]), and makes use of split screens and footnotes. But in addition it has some marked differences, to wit: weekly dramatic episodes often with multiple seasons such as ''[[Downton Abbey]]'', ''[[Boardwalk Empire]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' and multiple episodes as in nightly newscasts such as [[CNN]]'s ''[[The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer]]''. The multiple characters of newscasts include two categories: the newsmakers, i.e. the subjects of the news and the anchors, reporters and commentators of the news shows.

A '''kishka''' is a type of [[prison]] cell used in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] prisons.  The cell was named after the gut ({{lang-ru|[[wikt:кишка|кишка]]}}, ''[[Intestine|kíshka]]''), in that it was tall and narrow, like an [[intestine]], but more like a chimney.  The prisoner had room to stand, but could not sit or kneel, let alone lie down.  In some Soviet prisons there was no drainage and the prisoner was forced to excrete standing up and to stand in his own urine and feces.  In some cases the cells were never cleaned. Prisoners could be held in these cells for days at a time.

{{quote|[[Sławomir Rawicz|Rawicz]] was transferred to an immense fortress prison in [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], Ukraine, where he became the personal project of a huge, muscular – and inventively sadistic – NKVD major known as "The Bull." "He ran his interrogation sessions like an eminent surgeon, always showing off his skill before a changing crowd of junior officers," reflected Rawicz. "His methods were despicably ingenious."

One of'' The Bull's ''preferred methods of breaking his subjects' will was to insert them in a kishka. No provision was made for the inmates' bodily functions and the kishkas were never cleaned. Each day, Rawicz would be hauled out of his tiny cell, hosed off, and sent to The Bull for interrogation and torture.&lt;ref&gt;''Freedom Trek'' Grigg, William Norman

[[Ali bin Abi Talib]] took part in all the battles of Prophet [[Muhammad]]'s time, except the [[Battle of Tabuk]], as standard bearer. He also led parties of warriors on raids into enemy lands, and was an ambassador. Ali's fame grew with every battle that he was in, due to his courage, valour, and chivalry, as well as the fact that he single-handedly, destroyed many of Arabia's most famous and feared warriors. [[Muhammad]] acknowledged him as the greatest warrior of all time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alm3refh.com/vb/t26624.html{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Battle of Badr==
{{further|Battle of Badr}}
[[File:Siyer-i Nebi - Imam Ali und Hamza bei dem vorgezogenen Einzelkampf in Badr gegen die Götzendiener.jpg|thumb|[[Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib]] and Ali lead the Muslim armies during the [[Battle of Badr]].]]

===Scouting===
Muhammad did not know that an army had left [[Mecca]], was marching toward [[Medina]] to protect the caravan of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]], and to challenge the Muslims. When Muhammad arrived in the environs of [[Badr, Saudi Arabia|Badr]], he sent Ali to reconnoiter the surrounding country. At the wells of Badr, Ali surprised some water-carriers. In reply to his questions, they told him that they were carrying water for an army which came from Makkah, and which was encamped on the other side of the nearby hills.

Ali brought the water-carriers before Muhammad. From them he learned that the caravan of the Quraysh had already escaped, and that the [[Muslim]]s, at that very moment, were confronted by the army of Mecca.

&lt;blockquote&gt;On reaching the neighbourhood of Badr, Muhammad sent forward Ali, with a few others, to reconnoiter the rising ground above the springs. There they surprised three water-carriers of the enemy, as they were about to fill their sheepskins. One escaped to the Quraysh; the other two were captured and taken to the Muslim  army. From them Muhammad discovered the proximity of his enemy. There were 950 men; more than threefold the number of the Moslem army. They were mounted on 700 camels and 100 horses, the horsemen all clad in mail. (Sir William Muir, ''The Life of Mohammed, London, 1877'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The Battle===

Ali, along with his uncle Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib and cousin [[Ubaydah ibn al-Harith]], proceeded to single duels. Ali's duel was against [[Walid ibn Utba]], one of Mecca's fiercest warriors.

The youngest pair engaged first, Ali stepping forward to meet Walid. After a few moments of fencing, Waleed fell by the sword of his Muslim opponent. Then Hamza engaged Shaybah ibn Rab'iah and cut him down. Ubayda ibn Harith, the third Muslim champion, received a fatal wound from Utbah ibn Rab'iah. Ali and Hamza hastily dispatched Ut'bah ibn Rab'iah, carrying Ubaida to die in the Muslim lines.&lt;ref&gt;Sir John Glubb, The Great Arab Conquests, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

By noon the battle was over. The Quraysh fled. Forty-nine of the enemy had fallen and Ali had killed twenty-two, either alone or with the help of others. An equal number was captured. The believers had lost fourteen men on the field of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Tor Andre, ''Mohammed, the Man and his Faith, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali first distinguished himself as a warrior in 624, at the [[Battle of Badr]]. He defeated the [[Umayyad]] champion [[Walid ibn Utba]] as well as many other Meccan soldiers. His art of battle was so brilliant that in the battle, there were 70 Polytheist (Mushrikeen), 35 of them (almost half of them) were killed by Ali.

He also said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Half of them were killed by me, and the other half were killed by the other companions of Prophet Muhammad with the help of angels who descended on Earth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See:

==The Battle of Uhud==
{{further|Battle of Uhud}}

One year after the battle of Badr, the new army of the idolaters of Mecca was ready to take the field against the Muslims. In March 625 AD, [[Abu Sufyan]] left Mecca at the head of three thousand seasoned warriors. Most of them were foot soldiers but they were supported by a strong contingent of cavalry. Also accompanying the army, was a band of warlike women. Their duty was to wage "psychological warfare" against the Muslims by reading poetry and by singing amatory songs to spur the courage and the will-to-fight of the soldiers. They knew that nothing held such terror for the [[Arabs]] as the jibes of women for cowardice, and they also knew that nothing was so efficacious to turn them into utterly reckless fighters as the promise of physical love. These amazons included the wives of Abu Sufyan and [[Amr bin Aas]], and the sister of [[Khalid bin Walid]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Killing the Pagans Standard Bearers===

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Meccans, generously assisted by the women who had brought their timbrels, flung insults at the Muslims. These were alternated by Hind, the wife of Abu Sufyan, who led triumphant choruses as she danced round the idol which perched on the camel.

Talha, the hereditary standard-bearer of the Koreishites, was the first Meccan challenger. As he stepped out of Abu Sufyan's ranks, Ali stepped out of Muhammad's. The two men met in the middle of 'no man's land.' Without words or preliminary flourishes the duel began. Talha never stood a chance. Ali's scimitar flashed in the morning sun and the head of the standard-bearer leaped from his shoulder and rolled away on the sand.

'Allahu Akbar!'([[Allah]] is the greatest) echoed from the eagerly watching Muslims. ([[R. V. C. Bodley]], ''The Messenger, the Life of Mohammed, New York, 1946'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; When Ali ibn Abu Talib killed the carrier of the Meccan flag, Talhah ibn Abu Talha, it was immediately raised again by Uthman ibn Abu Talha. And when Uthman fell at the hands of Hamzah, it was raised again by Abu Sa'd ibn Abu Talhah. At the moment he raised the Meccan flag he shouted at the Muslims. ''"Do you pretend that your martyrs are in paradise and ours in hell? By God, you lie! If anyone of you truly believes such a story, let him come forward and fight with me."'' His challenge attracted Ali who killed him on the spot. The Banu Abd al Dar kept on carrying the Meccan flag until they lost nine men.  (Muhammad Husayn Haykal, ''The Life of Muhammad'') &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ali alone had killed eight standard-bearers of the idolaters of Mecca.

[[Ibn Athir]], the Arab historian, writes in his ''Tarikh Kamil'' "''The man who killed the standard-bearers (of the pagans) was Ali.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Ali ibn al-Athir]], [[The Complete History]] (Al-Kamil fi al-Tarikh), vol 3 p 107&lt;/ref&gt;

===The General Offensive===

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ali ibn Abu Talib pressed on undismayed into the enemy ranks – it was Badr again; the Muslims were invincible.  (''Sir John Glubb, The Great Arab Conquests, 1963'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ali and [[Hamza]] had broken the ranks of the Quraysh, and he was already deep inside their lines. Unable to resist his attack, they began to yield ground. Between them, they were grinding back the army of Quraysh.

===The Flight of the Muslims===

The death of the bearers of the banner heightened the morale of the Muslims, who pursued the enemy headlong. This however resulted in complacency, with some of the Muslim soldiers beginning to claim war spoils for themselves whilst the battle had not yet been fully won. This allowed the pagans to launch a counter-attack, which dismayed the Muslim army and sent it into headlong retreat. Muhammad remained stranded, with only a few soldiers left to defend him against the attacks of Khalid ibn Waleed. It is recorded that 'Ali alone remained, fending off the assaults of Khaleed's cavalrymen. According to Ibn Atheer, ''"The Prophet became the object of the attack of various units of the army of Quraish from all sides. Ali attacked, in compliance with Muhammad's orders, every unit that made an attack upon him and dispersed them or killed some of them, and this thing took place a number of times in Uhud."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ezsoftech.com/islamic/ohod.asp|title=History of Islam and Muslims, The second battle of Islam at Uhud, Battle of Ohod|author=Akramulla Syed|work=ezsoftech.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...when somebody raised the cry that Muhammad was killed, chaos reigned supreme, Muslim morale plunged to the bottom and Muslimzsoldiers fought sporadically and purposelessly. This chaos was responsible for their killing of Husayl ibn Jabir Abu Hudhayfah by mistake, as everyone sought to save his own skin by taking flight except such men as Ali ibn Abu Talib whom God had guided and protected. (Muhammad Husayn Haykal, ''The Life of Muhammad, 1935, Cairo'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The first of the Qurash to reach the Prophet's position was Ikrimah. As Ikrimah led a group of his men forward the Prophet turned to Ali and, pointing at the group, said, "Attack those men." Ali attacked and drove them back, killing one of them. Now another group of horsemen approached the position. Again the Prophet said to Ali, "Attack those men." 1 Ali drove them back and killed another infidel.
A regiment arrived from Kinanah in which four of the children of Sufyan Ibn Oweif were present. Khalid, Abu AI-Sha-atha, Abu Al-Hamra, and Ghurab. The Messenger of God said to Ali: "Take care of this regiment." Ali charged the regiment, and it was about fifty horsemen. He fought them while he was on foot until he scattered them. They gathered again and he charged them again. This was repeated several times until he killed the four children of Sufyan and added to them six more ... (Ibn Abu Al Hadeed, in his Commentary, vol 1 p 372)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was said that during 'Ali's defence of the Prophet, a call was heard, as follows: "There is no soldier but Ali, and there is no sword save Zhulfiqar."&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Al Atheer, In his Biography, vol 2 p 107&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Battle of the Trench==
{{further|Battle of the Trench}}
[[File:Combat between Ali ibn Abi Talib and Amr Ben Wad near Medina.JPG|thumb|A depicted painting of combat between Ali ibn Abi Talib (left) and Amr Ben Wad during [[Battle of the Trench]].]]

After the battle of Uhud, Abu Sufyan and the other pagan leaders realized that they had fought an indecisive action, and that their victory had not borne any fruits for them. Islam had, in fact, resiled from its reverse at Uhud, and within an astonishingly short time, had reestablished its authority in Medina and the surrounding areas. Again Ali proved to be an invincible warrior by killing Amr ibn wod al ameree who was one of the most feared warriors at the time. After Ali dropped Amr ibn wod al ameree off his horse, Amr spat at Ali. Ali got angry, and so he walked away for a moment and then got back after he calmed down, he told Amr ibn wod al ameree "If i killed you then i would have satisfied myself and not God's will" and then he killed Amr. The Muslim ranks roared and were happy. The Prophet said "Ali's strike on the day of the trench, is worth the combined worship of all of mankind and Jinns" {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==The Battle of Khaybar==

The campaign of Khaybar was one of the greatest. The masses of Jews living in Khaybar were the strongest, the richest, and the best equipped for war of all the peoples of Arabia. Even though they were rich and lived in castles Muhammed and Ali still had respect for them in Khaybar Imam Ali suffered from an eye illness and was not in battle-ready condition. Although he was ill, Prophet Muhammed called him and he came to his service. According to Islamic historians, Muhammed cured Ali's illness by rubbing his saliva on Ali's eyes. According to this tradition, Ali killed a Jewish chieftain with a sword-stroke, which split in two the helmet, the head and the body of the victim. Having lost his shield, Ali is said to have lifted both of the doors of the fortress from its hinges, climbed into the moat and held them up to make a bridge whereby the attackers gained access to the redoubt. This story is one basis for the Muslim view, especially in Shi'a Islam, of Ali as the prototype of heroes.

==The other expeditions==
Ali also participated in the [[Expedition of Fidak]]. Muhammad sent Ali to attack the Bani Sa‘d bin Bakr tribe, because Muhammad received intelligence they were planning to help the Jews of Khaybar&lt;ref&gt;Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 211. ([https://www.webcitation.org/60wanT9G2?url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SM_tsn/ch4s13.html online])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of the Camel===
[[File:Muhammad's widow, Aisha, battling the fourth caliph Ali in the Battle of the Camel.jpg|thumb|[[Aisha]] battling the fourth Rashidun Caliph Ali in the [[Battle of the Camel]].]]
{{main|Battle of the Camel}}

The [[Battle of the Camel]], sometimes called the Battle of Jamal or the Battle of Bassorah, took place at [[Basra]], [[Iraq]] on {{date|7 November 656}}.  [[A'isha]] heard about the killing of [[Uthman]] (644-656), the third [[Caliph]]. At the time she was on a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]. It was on this journey that she became so angered by his unavenged death, and the naming of [[Ali]] as the fourth caliph, that she took up arms against those supporting Ali. She gained support of the big city of Basra and, for the first time, Muslims took up arms against each other. This battle is now known as the [[First Fitna]], or Muslim civil war.&lt;ref name="Oxford Islamic Studies Online 1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mernissi|first=Fatima|title=A Feminist Interpretation of Women's Rights in Islam|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/book/islam-9780195116212/islam-9780195116212-chapter-13?_hi=0&amp;_pos=1#islam-9780195116212-bibItem-063-1|accessdate=2014-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Siffin===
{{main|Battle of Siffin}}
The Battle of Siffin ({{lang-ar|صفين}}; May–July 657 [[Common Era|CE]]) occurred during the [[First Fitna]], or first Muslim civil war, with the main engagement taking place from July 26 to July 28. It was fought between [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] and [[Muawiyah I]], on the banks of the [[Euphrates]] river, in what is now [[Raqqa]], [[Syria]].

The two armies encamped themselves at [[Siffin]] for more than one hundred days, most of the time being spent in negotiations. Neither side wanted to fight. Then on 11th Safar 37 AH, the Iraqis under Ashtar's command, the Qurra, in Ali's army, who had their own camp started the fighting in earnest which lasted three days.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley, p.  22 from Ibn Hisham from Ibn Muzahim died 212 AH from Abu Mikhnaf died 170 AH&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Yaqubi wrote that Ali had 80,000 men, including 70 Companions who participated in the [[Battle of Badr]], 70 Companions who took oath at Hudaibia, and 400 prominent [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansars]] and [[Muhajirun]]; while Muawiya had 120,000 Syrians.&lt;ref&gt;Yaqubi, vol 2, p. 188.  ''Tarikh Al-Yaqubi (Tarikh Ibn Wadih)''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The battle of siffin was one of the bloodiest battles in the Islamic history, all of the bravest warriors of Arabia participated in the battle both from Iraq and Syria. the fighting usually began in the morning and continued till evening. at first Ali  didn't want a general war because he had all the hope of convincing Muawiya to put down his rebellion. The first 3 month's both camps where in full negotiations with each other, the fighting was very limited and each day a commander of Ali's army came out with a battalion and from the other side there was the same respond. After 3 months of negotiations Ali realised that its all in vain and prepared for a general war. the night before the battle the soldiers spent their night sharpening their swords, spears and arrows. By this announcement Muawiya became worried because he knew the bravery of Ali and his swordsmanship skills. Muawiya also did the same and prepared his troops for a bloody battle. Early in the morning Ali set his troops in formation, he gave the command of the left flank to his best general Malik al-ashtar who was renown for his bravery and fighting skills, over the right flank he gave the command to a courageous soldier named Abdullah ibn Abbas, Ali himself took position in the centre of the army. By the time both armies stood in front of each other, Ali gave the order for a full attack, the fight was so fierce that even the bravest warriors perished. by midday the right flank of Ali's army began to fall en the men began to flee, when Ali saw his right flank is falling he himself moved to the right flank and faced the onslaught of the enemy who were great in numbers, Ali drove the enemy back because of his great valor and fighting skills, he slaughtered every soldiers who came in his way, when the men saw their flank is reorganized by Ali himself they came back to the battlefield for a new attack. When Ali saw his right flank back in formation he returned to the centre and made an attack with the men from the centre and his personal bodyguard elite, The attack was so fierce that the whole Syrian army where pushed back. Ali himself fought with such a valor that even the great Syrian warriors got frightend of him when they heard that Ali is coming for an attack. the battle of that day was so fierce that it continued to the night. by the time Ali and his army had pushed the Syrians 500 meters back from the battleground and victory became in sight. it is said that every man Ali killed he called out " god is great " and when it was counted it came on 534 confirmed kills which is a record in history of war.

[[William Muir]] wrote that, "Both armies drawn out in entire array, fought till the shades of evening fell, neither having got the better. The following morning, the combat was renewed with great vigour. Ali posed himself in the centre with the flower of his troops from Medina, and the wings were formed, one of the warriors from Basra, the other of those from Kufa. Muawiya had a pavilion pitched on the field; and there, surrounded by five lines of his sworn body-guards, watched the day. Amr with a great weight of horse, bore down upon the Kufa wing which gave away; and Ali was exposed to imminent peril, both from thick showers of arrows and from close encounter ... Ali's general Ashtar, at the head of 300 Hafiz-e-Qur'an(those who had memorized the Koran) led forward the other wing, which fell with fury on Muawiya's body-guards. Four of its five ranks were cut to pieces, and Muawiya, bethinking himself of flight, had already called for his horse, when a martial couplet flashed in his mind, and he held his ground."&lt;ref name="The Caliphate, its Rise and Fall--p261"&gt;William Muir, ''The Caliphate, its Rise and Fall'' (London, 1924) page 261&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Nahrawan===
{{main|Battle of Nahrawan}}
The Battle of Nahrawan ({{lang-ar-at|معركة النهروان|M'arkah an-Nahrawān}}) was a battle between [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]] (the first [[The Twelve Imams|Shi'ah Imam]] and the fourth Sunni [[Caliph]]) and the [[Kharijites]], near [[Nahrawan]], twelve miles from Baghdad.

'''Molyneux's problem''' is a [[thought experiment]] in philosophy concerning immediate [[recovery from blindness]]. It was first formulated by [[William Molyneux]], and notably referred to in [[John Locke]]'s ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689). The problem can be stated in brief, "if a man born blind can feel the differences between [[shape]]s such as [[sphere]]s and [[cube]]s, could he, if given the ability to see, distinguish those objects by sight alone, in reference to the tactile schemata he already possessed?"

==Original correspondence==
The question was originally posed to Locke by philosopher [[William Molyneux]], whose wife was blind:&lt;ref&gt;

Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which is the sphere. Suppose then the cube and the sphere placed on a table, and the blind man made to see: query, Whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube? To which the acute and judicious proposer answers: 'Not. For though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, and how a cube, affects his touch; yet he has not yet attained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so...'

{{quote|
I shall here insert a problem of that very ingenious and studious promoter of real knowledge, the learned and worthy Mr. Molyneux, which he was pleased to send me in a letter some months since; and it is this:—"Suppose a man born blind, and now adult, and taught by his touch to distinguish between a cube and a sphere of the same metal, and nighly of the same bigness, so as to tell, when he felt one and the other, which is the cube, which the sphere. Suppose then the cube and sphere placed on a table, and the blind man be made to see: quaere, whether by his sight, before he touched them, he could now distinguish and tell which is the globe, which the cube?" To which the acute and judicious proposer answers, "Not. For, though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, how a cube affects his touch, yet he has not yet obtained the experience, that what affects his touch so or so, must affect his sight so or so; or that a protuberant angle in the cube, that pressed his hand unequally, shall appear to his eye as it does in the cube."—'''I agree with this thinking gentleman, whom I am proud to call my friend, in his answer to this problem; and am of opinion that the blind man, at first sight, would not be able with certainty to say which was the globe, which the cube, whilst he only saw them; though he could unerringly name them by his touch, and certainly distinguish them by the difference of their figures felt.''' This I have set down, and leave with my reader, as an occasion for him to consider how much he may be beholden to experience, improvement, and acquired notions, where he thinks he had not the least use of, or help from them. And the rather, because this observing gentleman further adds, that "having, upon the occasion of my book, proposed this to divers very ingenious men, he hardly ever met with one that at first gave the answer to it which he thinks true, till by hearing his reasons they were convinced.

==Responses==
In 1709, in ''A New Theory of Vision'', [[George Berkeley]] also concluded that there was no necessary connection between a tactile world and a sight world—that a connection between them could be established only on the basis of experience. He speculated:
{{quote|
the objects to which he had hitherto used to apply the terms up and down, high and low, were such as only affected or were in some way perceived by touch; but the proper objects of vision make a new set of ideas, perfectly distinct and different from the former, and which can in no sort make themselves perceived by touch|
(sect. 95).
}}

In 1749, [[Denis Diderot]] wrote ''[[Lettre sur les aveugles à l'usage de ceux qui voient|Letter on the blind for the benefit of those who see]]'' as a criticism of our knowledge of ultimate reality.

A similar problem was also addressed earlier in the 12th century by [[Ibn Tufail]] (Abubacer), in his [[philosophical novel]], ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' (''Philosophus Autodidactus''). His version of the problem, however, dealt mainly with [[color]]s rather than shapes&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad ibn Abd al-Malik [[Ibn Tufayl]] and Léon Gauthier (1981), ''Risalat Hayy ibn Yaqzan'', p. 5, Editions de la Méditerranée:[http://limitedinc.blogspot.com/2007/04/things-about-arabick-influence-on-john.html]

If you want a comparison that will make you clearly grasp the difference between the perception, such as it is understood by that sect [the Sufis] and the perception as others understand it, imagine a person born [[Blindness|blind]], endowed however with a happy natural [[temperament]], with a lively and firm [[intelligence]], a sure [[memory]], a straight sprite, who grew up from the time he was an infant in a city where he never stopped learning, by means of the [[sense]]s he did dispose of, to know the inhabitants individually, the numerous species of beings, living as well as non-living, there, the streets and sidestreets, the houses, the steps, in such a manner as to be able to cross the city without a guide, and to recognize immediately those he met; the colors alone would not be known to him except by the names they bore, and by certain definitions that designated them. Suppose that he had arrived at this point and suddenly, his eyes were opened, he recovered his view, and he crosses the entire city, making a tour of it. He would find no object different from the idea he had made of it; he would encounter nothing he didn’t recognize, he would find the colors conformable to the descriptions of them that had been given to him; and in this there would only be two new important things for him, one the consequence of the other: a clarity, a greater [[brightness]], and a great voluptuousness.

Regarding Molyneux's problem, the authors [[Asif A. Ghazanfar]] &amp; [[Hjalmar K. Turesson]] (2008) have recently noted:
{{quote|
Production of speech is seen as a pure motor act, involving muscles and the neurons controlling them, while perception of speech is seen as purely sensory, involving the ear and the auditory pathway. This parcellation of the systems appear intuitive and clear, but recent studies [beginning with Taine 1870!] ... suggest that such divisions may be fundamentally wrong. Rather than separate processes for motor outputs and individual sensory modalities, adaptive action seems to use all the available context-specific information. That is, neural representations across the brain may be centered on specific actions. This view on neural representations puts 'Molyneux's Problem' in a new light. Unisensory signals are fused into multisensory motor representations unified by an action, but since Molyneux does not suggest any action, his 'problem' may be better viewed as an ill-posed question—at least from a neuroscientific perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Ghazanfar, A. A. &amp; Turesson, H. K. (2008). Speech production: How does a word feel? ''Current Biology'', ''18'',24: R1142–1144.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

One reason that Molyneux's Problem could be posed in the first place is the extreme dearth of human subjects who gain vision after extended congenital blindness.  Alberto Valvo estimated that fewer than twenty cases have been known in the last 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Valvo, A. (1971). Sight restoration after long-term blindness: The problems and behavior patterns of visual rehabilitation. New York: American Foundation for the Blind.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ostrovsky, et al.,&lt;ref&gt;Ostrovsky, et al., "Vision following extended congenital blindness", Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences Massachusetts Institute of Technology&lt;/ref&gt; studied a woman who gained sight at the age of 12 when she underwent surgery for dense bilateral congenital cataracts.  They report that the subject could recognize family members by sight six months after surgery, but took up to a year to recognize most household objects purely by sight.

In 2003, [[Pawan Sinha]], a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], set up a program in the framework of the Project Prakash&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectprakash.org/|title=Project Prakash|website=Project Prakash}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually had the opportunity to find five individuals who satisfied the requirements for an experiment aimed at answering Molyneux's question experimentally.  Prior to treatment, the subjects (aged 8 to 17) were only able to discriminate between light and dark, with two of them also being able to determine the direction of a bright light. The surgical treatments took place between 2007 and 2010, and quickly brought the relevant subject from total congenital blindness to fully seeing.  A carefully designed test was submitted to each subject within the next 48 hours.  Based on its result, the experimenters concluded that the answer, in short, to Molyneux's problem is "no". Although after restoration of sight, the subjects could distinguish between objects visually almost as effectively as they would do by touch alone, they were unable to form the connection between an object perceived using the two different senses. The correlation was barely better than if the subjects had guessed.  They had no innate ability to transfer their tactile shape knowledge to the visual domain.  However, the experimenters could test three of the five subjects on later dates (5 days, 7 days, and 5 months after, respectively) and found that the performance in the touch-to-vision case improved significantly, reaching 80–90%.&lt;ref name=Held2011&gt;

A '''no-win situation''', also called a “'''lose-lose situation'''”, is one where a person has choices, but no choice leads to a net gain. For example, if an executioner offers the condemned the choice of death by being hanged, shot, or poisoned, all choices lead to death; the condemned is in a no-win situation. This bleak situation gives the chooser no room: whichever choice is made the person making it will lose their life. Less drastic situations may also be considered no-win situations - if one has a choice for lunch between a [[ham]] [[ham sandwich|sandwich]] and a [[roast beef]] [[roast beef sandwich|sandwich]], but is a [[vegetarian]] or has a [[wheat allergy]], that might also be considered a no-win situation.

==In game theory==
In [[game theory]], a "no-win" situation is one in which no player benefits from any outcome. This may be because of any or all  of the following:
* Unavoidable or unforeseeable circumstances causing the situation to change after decisions have been made. This is common in [[text adventure]]s.
* [[Zugzwang]], as in [[chess]], when any move a player chooses makes him worse off than before.
* A situation in which the player has to accomplish two mutually dependent tasks [[Deadlock|each of which must be completed before the other]] or that are mutually exclusive (a [[Catch-22 (logic)|Catch-22]]).
* Ignorance of other players' actions, meaning the best decision for all differs from that for any one player (as in the [[prisoner's dilemma]]).

==In history==
[[Carl von Clausewitz]]'s advice (never to launch a [[war]] that one has not already won) characterizes war as a no-win situation. A similar example is the [[Pyrrhic victory]], in which a military victory is so costly that the winning side actually ends up worse off than before it started. Looking at the victory as a part of a larger situation, the situation could either be no-win, or more of a win for the other side than the one that won the "victory", or victory at such cost that the gains are outweighed by the cost and are no longer a source of joy.

For example, the "victorious" side may have accomplished their objective, but the objective may have been worthless, or they may lose a strategic advantage in manpower or positioning. (One example is Great Britain in WWII, where Britain was one of the victorious powers, but found itself so exhausted in the process as to no longer be able to maintain its great power status in a world now dominated by the United States and the Soviet Union.) A related concept is sometimes described as winning the battle but losing the war, where a lesser (sub-) objective is won but the true objective beyond it is not well pursued and is lost.

In past [[Europe]], those accused of being [[witches]] were sometimes bound and then thrown or dunked in water to test their innocence. A witch would float (by calling upon the Devil to save her from drowning), and then be executed; but a woman not a witch would drown (proving her innocence but causing her death).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A6358926 BBC - h2g2 - Matthew Hopkins, 'Witchfinder General' of East Anglia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In video games ==
{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2015}}
'''Unwinnable''' is a state in many [[text adventure]]s, graphical [[adventure game]]s and [[role-playing video game]]s where it is impossible for the player to win the game (either due to a [[Software bug|bug]] or by design), and where the only options are restarting the game, loading a previously saved game, wandering indefinitely, or a [[game over]] (negative game end, such as death). It is also known as a '''dead end''' situation. Usually, this is the result of the player's previous choices, and not due to the game itself lacking a path to victory. For example, in games such as ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|Goldeneye 007]]'', ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', and ''[[TimeSplitters (video game)|TimeSplitters]]'', the level does not end once a player fails an objective short of being killed, but it is impossible to progress to the next level no matter what the player does afterwards. Other games take steps to ''avoid'' unwinnable situations; for example, a game may not allow players to drop items which are necessary to continue.

''Unwinnable'' should not be confused with ''unbeatable'', which is used to describe a character, monster, or puzzle that is too powerful or difficult to be overcome by the player or character at a lower standing, and is normally found in [[role-playing video game]]s. In many cases, "unbeatable" gamestates occur because of [[integer overflow]] or other errors programmers did not take into account, called a [[kill screen]]. In this situation, the game may also crash.

== In other media ==
In the film ''[[WarGames]]'', the supercomputer [[WOPR]] simulates all possible games of [[tic-tac-toe]] as a metaphor for all possible scenarios of a [[nuclear war]], each of them ending in a [[nuclear holocaust]] ([[mutual assured destruction]]). The computer then exclaims, "A strange game; the only winning move is not to play."

In the ''[[Star Trek]]'' canon, the ''[[Kobayashi Maru]]'' simulation is a no-win scenario designed as a character test for command track cadets at [[Starfleet Academy]]. It first appears in the film ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]''. In the film, Admiral [[James T. Kirk]] states that he does not believe in the no-win scenario.

In the TV show ''[[Quantico (TV series)|Quantico]]'', the agents are put in a terrorist hijack flight simulation mission that is unbeatable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22527">{{Attributes of God}}

'''Omnipotence''' is the quality of having unlimited power. [[Monotheism|Monotheistic]] [[religion]]s generally attribute omnipotence to only the [[deity]] of their faith. In the monotheistic [[religious philosophy|philosophies]] of [[Abrahamic religions]], omnipotence is often listed as one of a deity's characteristics among many, including [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], and [[omnibenevolence]]. The presence of all these properties in a single entity has given rise to considerable [[theological]] debate, prominently including the problem of [[theodicy]], the question of why such a deity would permit the manifestation of evil.

==Meanings==
The term omnipotent has been used to connote a number of different positions. These positions include, but are not limited to, the following:
# A deity is able to do anything that it chooses to do.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]] ''City of God''&lt;/ref&gt;
# A deity is able to do anything that is in accord with its own nature (thus, for instance, if it is a [[logical consequence]] of a deity's nature that what it speaks is truth, then it is not able to [[lie]]).
# It is part of a deity's nature to be consistent and that it would be inconsistent for said deity to go against its own laws unless there was a reason to do so.&lt;ref name="scireligion"&gt;This is a consistent theme of Polkinghorne's work, see e.g. Polkinghorne's ''Science and Religion''.{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A deity can bring about any state of affairs which is logically possible for anyone to bring about in that situation.
# A deity is able to do anything that corresponds with its [[omniscience]] and therefore with its worldplan.
# Every action performed in the world is 'actually' being performed by the deity, either due to omni-[[immanence]], or because all actions must be 'supported' or 'permitted' by the deity.

Under many philosophical definitions of the term "deity", senses 2, 3 and 4 can be shown to be equivalent. However, on all understandings of omnipotence, it is generally held that a deity is able to intervene in the world by superseding the laws of physics, since they are not part of its nature, but the principles on which it has created the physical world.  However many modern scholars (such as [[John Polkinghorne]]) hold that it is part of a deity's nature to be consistent and that it would be inconsistent for a deity to go against its own laws unless there were an overwhelming reason to do so.&lt;ref name="scireligion"/&gt;

The word "Omnipotence" derives from the Latin term "''Omni Potens''", meaning "All-Powerful" instead of "Infinite Power" implied by its English counterpart. The term could be applied to both deities and Roman Emperors. Being the one with "All the power", it was not uncommon for nobles to attempt to prove their Emperor's "''Omni Potens''" to the people, by demonstrating his effectiveness at leading the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;This presents the most controversy when applied to Abrahamic Religions, since there was no word for "Infinite Power" in ancient Semitic Languages like Hebrew or Aramaic.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholastic definition===
[[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas Aquinas, OP]] acknowledged difficulty in comprehending the Deity's power: "All confess that God is omnipotent; but it seems difficult to explain in what His omnipotence precisely consists: for there may be doubt as to the precise meaning of the word 'all' when we say that God can do all things. If, however, we consider the matter aright, since power is said in reference to possible things, this phrase, 'God can do all things,' is rightly understood to mean that God can do all things that are possible; and for this reason He is said to be omnipotent."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''Summa Theologiae'', 1a, Q. 25, A. 3, Respondeo; quoted from [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas, Second and Revised Edition, 1920, translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province, at ''New Advent'', copyright 2008 by Kevin Knight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121213839/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm |date=2011-11-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the scholastic understanding, omnipotence is generally understood to be compatible with certain limitations or restrictions. A proposition that is [[logical truth|necessarily true]] is one whose negation is self-contradictory.
:"It is sometimes objected that this aspect of omnipotence involves the contradiction that God cannot do all that He can do; but the argument is sophistical; it is no contradiction to assert that God can realize whatever is possible, but that no number of actualized possibilities exhausts His power. Omnipotence is perfect power, free from all mere potentiality. Hence, although God does not bring into external being all that He is able to accomplish, His power must not be understood as passing through successive stages before its effect is accomplished. The activity of God is simple and eternal, without evolution or change. The transition from possibility to actuality or from act to potentiality, occurs only in creatures. When it is said that God can or could do a thing, the terms are not to be understood in the sense in which they are applied to created causes, but as conveying the idea of a Being possessed of infinite unchangeable power, the range of Whose activity is limited only by His sovereign Will".&lt;ref&gt;CITATION NEEDED; probably St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''Summa Theologiae'', 1a, Q. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Thomas explains that:
: "Power is predicated of God not as something really distinct from His knowledge and will, but as differing from them logically; inasmuch as power implies a notion of a principle putting into execution what the will commands, and what knowledge directs, which three things in God are identified. Or we may say, that the knowledge or will of God, according as it is the effective principle, has the notion of power contained in it. Hence the consideration of the knowledge and will of God precedes the consideration of His power, as the cause precedes the operation and effect."&lt;ref&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''Summa Theologiae'', 1a, Q. 25, A. 1, Ad 4; quoted from [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm The Summa Theologica of St. Thomas Aquinas, Second and Revised Edition, 1920, translated by the Fathers of the English Dominican Province, at ''New Advent'', copyright 2008 by Kevin Knight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121213839/http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1025.htm |date=2011-11-21 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Omnipotence is all-sufficient power. The adaptation of means to ends in the universe does not argue, as J. S. Mill would have it, that the power of the designer is limited, but only that God has willed to manifest his glory by a world so constituted rather than by another. Indeed, the production of secondary causes, capable of accomplishing certain effects, requires greater power than the direct accomplishment of these same effects. On the other hand, even though no creature existed, God's power would not be barren, for "creatures are not an end to God."&lt;ref&gt;St. Thomas Aquinas, OP, ''[[Summa Theologica|Summa Theologiae]]'', incomplete citation.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the Deity's power, medieval theologians contended that there are certain things that even an omnipotent deity cannot do. The statement "a deity can do anything" is only sensible with an assumed suppressed clause, "that implies the perfection of true power". This standard scholastic answer allows that acts of creatures such as walking can be performed by humans but not by a deity. Rather than an advantage in power, human acts such as walking, sitting, or giving birth were possible only because of a ''defect'' in human power. The capacity to [[sin]], for example, is not a power but a defect or infirmity. In response to questions of a deity performing impossibilities, e.g. making square circles, St. Thomas says that "everything that does not imply a contradiction in terms, is numbered amongst those possible things, in respect of which God is called omnipotent: whereas whatever implies contradiction does not come within the scope of divine omnipotence, because it cannot have the aspect of possibility. Hence it is better to say that such things cannot be done, than that God cannot do them. Nor is this contrary to the word of the angel, saying: 'No word shall be impossible with God.' For whatever implies a contradiction cannot be a word, because no intellect can possibly conceive such a thing."&lt;ref name="newadvent.org"/&gt;

In recent times, [[C. S. Lewis]] has adopted a scholastic position in the course of his work ''[[The Problem of Pain]]''. Lewis follows Aquinas' view on contradiction:
{{quotation|His Omnipotence means power to do all that is intrinsically possible, not to do the intrinsically impossible. You may attribute miracles to him, but not nonsense. This is no limit to his power. If you choose to say 'God can give a creature [[free will]] and at the same time withhold free will from it,' you have not succeeded in saying ''anything'' about God: meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words 'God can.'... It is no more possible for God than for the weakest of his creatures to carry out both of two mutually exclusive alternatives; not because his power meets an obstacle, but because nonsense remains nonsense even when we talk it about God.|Lewis, 18}}

==In psychology==
Early [[Freud]]ianism saw a feeling of omnipotence as intrinsic to early childhood. 'As Freud and [[Sándor Ferenczi|Ferenczi]] have shown, the child lives in a sort of [[megalomania]] for a long period...the "fiction of omnipotence"'.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Bergler, in J. Halliday/P.

==Rejection or limitation==
Some monotheists reject the view that a deity is or could be omnipotent, or take the view that, by choosing to create creatures with freewill, a deity has chosen to limit divine omnipotence.  In [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] and [[Reform Judaism]], and some movements within [[Protestant Christianity]], including [[open theism]], deities are said to act in the world through persuasion, and not by coercion (this is a matter of choice—a deity could act miraculously, and perhaps on occasion does so—while for process theism it is a matter of necessity—creatures have inherent powers that a deity cannot, even in principle, override).  Deities are manifested in the world through inspiration and the creation of possibility, not necessarily by [[miracle]]s or violations of the laws of nature.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The rejection of omnipotence often follows from either philosophical or scriptural considerations, discussed below.

===Philosophical grounds===
Process theology rejects unlimited omnipotence on a philosophical basis, arguing that omnipotence as classically understood would be less than perfect, and is therefore incompatible with the idea of a perfect deity. The idea is grounded in Plato's oft-overlooked statement that "being is power."
{{quotation|My notion would be, that anything which possesses any sort of power to affect another, or to be affected by another, if only for a single moment, however trifling the cause and however slight the
effect, has real existence; and I hold that the definition of being is simply power.|Plato, 247E&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051230161511/http://philosophy.eserver.org/plato/sophist.txt |archivedate=2005-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this premise, [[Charles Hartshorne]] argues further that:
{{quotation|Power is influence, and perfect power is perfect influence ... power must be exercised upon something, at least if by power we mean influence, control; but the something controlled cannot be absolutely inert, since the merely passive, that which has no active tendency of its own, is nothing; yet if the something acted upon is itself partly active, then there must be some resistance, however slight, to the "absolute" power, and how can power which is resisted be absolute?|Hartshorne, 89}}

The argument can be stated as follows:
:1) If a being exists, then it must have some active tendency.
:2) If a being has some active tendency, then it has some power to resist its creator.
:3) If a being has the power to resist its creator, then the creator does not have absolute power.

For example, though someone might control a lump of jelly-pudding almost completely, the inability of that pudding to stage any resistance renders that person's power rather unimpressive. Power can only be said to be great if it is over something that has defenses and its own agenda. If a deity's power is to be great, it must therefore be over beings that have at least some of their own defenses and agenda. Thus, if a deity does not have absolute power, it must therefore embody some of the characteristics of power, and some of the characteristics of persuasion. This view is known as [[dipolar theism]].

The most popular works espousing this point are from [[Harold Kushner]] (in Judaism).  The need for a modified view of omnipotence was also articulated by [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in the early 20th century and expanded upon by the aforementioned philosopher Charles Hartshorne. Hartshorne proceeded within the context of the theological system known as process theology.

===Scriptural grounds===
In the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the [[Bible]], as well as several other versions, in [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 19:6 it is stated "...the Lord God omnipotent reigneth" (the original Greek word is παντοκράτωρ, "all-mighty").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://strongsnumbers.com/greek/3841.htm |title=Strong's Greek Dictionary: 3841. pantokrator (pan-tok-rat'-ore) |publisher=Strongsnumbers.com |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319205959/http://strongsnumbers.com/greek/3841.htm |archivedate=2011-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uncertainty and other views==
All the above stated claims of power are each based on scriptural grounds and upon [[empirical]] human perception. This perception is limited to our [[senses]]. The power of a deity is related to its existence.There are however other ways of perception like: [[reason]], [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]], [[revelation]], [[divine inspiration]], [[religious experience]], [[mystical| mystical states]], and historical testimony.

According to the Hindu philosophy the essence of God or [[Brahman]] can never be understood or known since Brahman is beyond both existence and non-existence, transcending and including time, causation and space, and thus can never be known in the same material sense as one traditionally 'understands' a given concept or object.&lt;ref name="gita"&gt;''brahmano hi pratisthaham'', [[Bhagavad Gita]] 14.27&lt;/ref&gt;

So presuming there is a god-like entity consciently taking actions, we cannot comprehend the limits of a deity's powers.&lt;ref name="sex"&gt;Since this article deals on the all power of a deity, it would be logic to assign deities to both sexes. Since having only one sex would make a deity less powerful and thus no longer all-powerful. This article is also not (only) on omnipotence of the biblical God, there are other monotheistic religions who consider their God having both sexes ([[Shaktism]], [[Shaivism]], [[Vaishnavism]]). These aspects are not meant literally, but are aspects of divinity to illustrate a duality just as the [[Tao]] in [[Taoism]] consists of [[yin and yang]].
Also an anthropocentric perspective seems at odds with many philosophers, such as [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the current laws of physics are only known to be valid in this universe, it is possible that the laws of physics are different in parallel universes, giving a God-like entity more power. If the number of universes is unlimited, then the power of a certain God-like entity is also unlimited, since the laws of physics may be different in other universes, and accordingly&lt;ref name="par"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/program.html |title=String Theory and Parallel universes |publisher=Pbs.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20060606234642/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/program.html |archivedate=2006-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; making this entity omnipotent. Unfortunately concerning a multiverse there is a lack of empirical correlation. To the extreme there are theories about realms beyond this [[multiverse]] ([[Nirvana (concept)|Nirvana]], [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], [[Nothingness]]).

Also trying to develop a theory to explain, assign or reject omnipotence on grounds of logic has little merit, since being omnipotent, in a Cartesian sense, would mean the omnipotent being is above logic, a view supported by [[René Descartes]].&lt;ref name="rene"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ontological/ |title=Descartes' Ontological Argument |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He issues this idea in his [[Meditations on First Philosophy]]. This view is called universal possibilism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Logical Truth and Omnipotence|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/logical-truth-and-omnipotence|accessdate=20 May 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520215755/http://www.reasonablefaith.org/logical-truth-and-omnipotence|archivedate=20 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allowing assumption that a deity exists, further debate may be provoked that said deity is consciously taking actions. It could be concluded from an [[emanationism]]&lt;ref name="eman_cath"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05397b.htm |title=Catholic view on emanationism |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1909-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805012018/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05397b.htm |archivedate=2011-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eman_hindu"&gt;{{cite web |author=M.Alan Kazlev |url=http://www.kheper.net/topics/religion/Hindu_emanationism.htm |title=Hindu view on emanationism |publisher=Kheper.net |date= |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514062547/http://www.kheper.net/topics/religion/Hindu_emanationism.htm |archivedate=2011-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; point of view, that all actions and creations by a deity are simply flows of divine energy (the flowing [[Tao]] in conjunction with [[qi]] is often seen as a river;&lt;ref name="river"&gt;Tao Te Ching Chapter LXI Verse 140 [http://www.friesian.com/taote.htm Comments on the Tao Te Ching] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224052803/http://www.friesian.com/taote.htm |date=2007-02-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dharma (Buddhism)]] the law of nature discovered by [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] has no beginning or end.)
[[Pantheism]] and [[pandeism]] see the universe/multiverse itself as God (or, at least, the current state of God), while [[panentheism]] sees the universe/multiverse as 'the body of God', making 'God' everybody and everything. So if one does something, actually 'God' is doing it. We are 'God's' means according to this view.

In the [[Taoist]] religious or philosophical tradition, the Tao is in some ways equivalent to a deity or the [[logos]]. The Tao is understood to have inexhaustible power, yet that power is simply another aspect of its weakness.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14671">'''Pantisocracy''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] πᾶν and ἰσοκρατία meaning "equal or level government by/for all") was a utopian scheme devised in 1794 by the poets [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and [[Robert Southey]] for an [[egalitarian]] community. It is a system of government where all rule equally. They originally intended to establish such a community on the banks of the [[Susquehanna River]] in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Companion to Coleridge |last=Newlyn |first=Lucy |year=2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-65909-4 |pages=129 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=_sF-QCKwnSIC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=Pantisocracy#PPA129,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but by 1795 Southey had doubts about the viability of this and proposed moving the project to [[Wales]]. The two men were unable to agree on the location, causing the project to collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Romantic Indians: Native  Americans, British Literature, and Transatlantic Culture, 1756–1830 |last=Fulford |first=Tim |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-927337-5 |pages=120–121 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JRWDvjsIfeMC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=Pantisocracy#PPA120,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==

Coleridge and Southey believed that contemporary society and politics were responsible for cultures of servitude and oppression.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, John (1990).  ''Coleridge's Political Thought'', p. 8. St. Martin's Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-312-03645-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having abandoned these corrupting influences along with [[personal property]] for a fresh start in the wilderness, the Pantisocrats hoped that men might be governed by the “dictates of rational benevolence.”

As spelled out by Southey, the utopian community he and Coleridge planned was to be built on two principles: "Pantisocracy" (meaning government by all) and "Aspheterism" (meaning general ownership of property).&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. Ernest Coleridge. (1895). ''Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge'', vol. 1, p. 73. Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston and New York. {{ISBN|1-4212-7161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme called for a small group of educated individuals to give up their possessions and labor together for the [[common good]]. Few regulations would be necessary to govern the colony and decisions would be made so as to avoid one man having more power than another. Coleridge envisioned Pantisocracy as a way to minimize the greed among men.&lt;ref name="Woodring"&gt;Woodring, Carl R.. ''Politics in the Poetry of Coleridge'', p. 63. The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Coleridge and Southey hoped to enjoy a more relaxing existence than was possible in England, and expected that each member of the community would have to work just two to three hours per day to sustain the [[colony]].&lt;ref name="MacGillivray"&gt;MacGillivray, J.R., Ed. Malcolm Wallace (1931). "The Pantisocracy Scheme and Its Immediate Background" in ''Studies in English''. The University of Toronto Press, Toronto. {{oclc|27738043}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|132}}

The Pantisocrats viewed their attempt as not only a search for personal domestic peace, but also as an attempt to change the status quo in England.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, John (1990).  ''Coleridge's Political Thought'', p. 9. St. Martin's Press, New York. {{ISBN|0-312-03645-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; One influence on the plan was disillusionment with the [[French Revolution]] and with the current politics of [[England]], from which Coleridge may have sought solace through a utopian escape.&lt;ref name="Woodring" /&gt;  Coleridge viewed the utopian scheme as an [[experiment]] that, if successful, might be gradually extended to a larger citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;Sister Eugenia (1930).  "Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts", in ''PMLA'' p. 1079. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/457827] 28/1/2010&lt;/ref&gt; Coleridge also hoped that through a more active, natural lifestyle he would live a healthier and more wholesome existence with his family.&lt;ref name="Woodring1"&gt;Woodring, Carl R. (1961). ''Politics in the Poetry of Coleridge'', p. 69. The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and inspirations==

Like many utopian societies, the Pantisocracy envisioned by Coleridge and Southey owed its origins to Plato's ideal commonwealth, envisioned in the later books of ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' and in ''[[Critias (dialogue)|Critias]]''.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|134}} More modern examples for the Pantisocrats included [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More’s]] [[Utopia (book)|''Utopia'']], [[Francis Bacon|Francis Bacon’s]] ''[[New Atlantis]]'', [[Tommaso Campanella|Tommaso Campanella’s]] ''Civitas Solis'', and the accounts of [[Cotton Mather]].

The Pantisocrats were also heavily influenced by contemporary travel accounts of the new world.&lt;ref&gt;Sister Eugenia (1930).  "Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts", in ''PMLA'' p. 1069-1074. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/457827] 28/1/2010&lt;/ref&gt; Many writers who visited the new world (including [[Jacques Pierre Brissot|J. P. Brissot]], [[Thomas Cooper (US politician)|Thomas Cooper]], and [[Joseph Priestley]]) described a fresh and inviting country, whose inhabitants were untainted by the evils of society. Coleridge and Southey poured over these and other accounts of the American continent.

==Beginnings==

As early as November, 1793, Robert Southey was envisioning a utopia in the US.&lt;ref name="Southey"&gt;Southey, Rev. Charles Cuthbert, Ed. (1850). ''The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey'', vol. 1, p. 211. Longman, Brown, Greene, and Longmans, London. {{ISBN|1-4255-6343-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1794, Coleridge left [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] to visit [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and there met Southey, a student and poet.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|157–158}} Within weeks, Southey and Coleridge were deep in the planning stages of Pantisocracy.

In July, Coleridge left Oxford for a walking tour of Wales with his friend (and Oxford graduate), Joseph Hucks. Throughout July, Coleridge corresponded regularly with Southey about their plans. Coleridge even went so far as to share his enthusiasm for Pantisocracy with many of the people he and Hucks met along the road, offending several listeners with their radical ideas. During the walking tour Coleridge also encountered an old flame, Mary Evans, and his interaction with her momentarily drove thoughts of Pantisocracy from his mind. On August 3, Coleridge and Hucks rejoined Southey in Bristol.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|159}}

In Bristol, Southey and Coleridge continued to flesh out their plans, and spoke openly of their radical ideas. One listener was John Poole, cousin of [[Thomas Poole (tanner)|Tom Poole]] of Nether Stowey, who writes of his encounter with the two young men: “Each of them was shamefully hot with Democratic rage as regards politics, and both [[Infidel]] as to religion. I was extremely indignant…”.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|159}}

During this time the young men also became acquainted with the family of Mrs. Fricker, a widow whose daughters seemed willing to join in the scheme (as Mrs. Southey and Coleridge).&lt;ref name="OX"&gt;Beer, John, (2004). "Samuel Taylor Coleridge", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Oxford University Press, Oxford. http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/5888&lt;/ref&gt; Southey became interested in Edith and Coleridge began showing interest in Sara.

==Further planning and practical implications==

In the autumn of 1794, Coleridge began seriously to investigate the practical problems of setting up a community in America. During this time he encountered George Dyer, a student familiar with Priestley (who at the time was already living in Pennsylvania), and also spoke with a land agent. In a letter to Southey on September 6 he writes:&lt;ref&gt;Southey, Rev. Charles Cuthbert, Ed. (1850). ''The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey'', vol. 1, p. 193-196. Longman, Brown, Greene, and Longmans, London. {{ISBN|1-4255-6343-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|[The land agent] says £2000 will do; that he doubts not we can contract for our passage under £400; that we shall buy the land a great deal cheaper when we arrive in American than we could do in England…That twelve men may easily clear 300 acres in four or five months; and that, for 600 dollars, a thousand acres may be cleared and houses built on them. He recommends the Susquehannah for its excessive beauty and its security from hostile Indians.}}

Neither Coleridge nor Southey possessed the requisite wealth, but plans were laid for a spring departure in 1795.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|165}} The young men hoped that other, wealthier immigrants who would join in the endeavor would be willing to fund it. Returning to Cambridge in late September, Coleridge began to spread word of the plan.

Coleridge at this time envisioned the community including “twelve men with their families,” among whom the costs would be split, with the wealthier members of the community making up for the shortcomings of the poorer members.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|166}} Besides money, other practical issues arose. Having little ability in farming or carpentry, the young men planned to acquire these skills over the winter in time for a March departure. Among the families who were planning to make the voyage were children, and Coleridge worried that they might already be deeply prejudiced by society, which could subvert and corrupt the Pantisocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. Ernest Coleridge. (1895). ''Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge'', vol. 1, p. 168. Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston and New York. {{ISBN|1-4212-7161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disillusionment==

As the date set for departure arrived and the financial difficulties in undertaking the journey remained unsolved, the would-be emigrants began to lose excitement and resolve.&lt;ref name="MacGillivray" /&gt;{{rp|168}} Besides their lack of funds, other concerns challenged the Pantisocrats. Contrary to the glowing travel narratives that Coleridge pored over while researching the prospect of settling in America, other accounts of American life were less encouraging, and described a difficult and laborious existence.&lt;ref&gt;Sister Eugenia (1930). "Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts", in ''PMLA'' p. 1079-1081. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/457827] 28/1/2010&lt;/ref&gt; In a review of Thomas Cooper’s ''Some Information Respecting America,'' (one of the positive accounts of the [[New World]] that Coleridge consulted) a reviewer describes Cooper and those like him as “rival auctioneers, or rather show-men, stationed for the allurement of incautious passengers. 'Pray, ladies and gentlemen, walk in and admire the wonders of Kentucky—Pray, stop and see the incomparable beauties of the Susquehanna.'”

Coleridge also faced personal challenges in carrying out the scheme. He received a letter from Mary Evans which argued against the plan, and his feelings for her for a time swayed him against Pantisocracy.&lt;ref name="OX" /&gt; Learning that she had become engaged, Coleridge turned his attention back to Pantisocracy and Sara Fricker. Under pressure from Southey to act with regard to Sara (both because of the demands of Pantisocracy and also because she was being courted by other men), Coleridge married Sara in October 1795.

As plans bogged down, Southey and Coleridge eventually reached an impasse. Southey at one point advocated taking servants to the new world to do the hard work, a proposition Coleridge scoffed at. Southey and other would-be Pantisocrats also considered a less ambitious plan: the purchase of a common farm in Wales. Coleridge, still dreaming of the new world, felt that this compromise failed to meet the standards of Pantisocracy. In a letter to Southey he complains that private resources would not be abandoned at the farm in Wales and that, "In short, we were to commence partners in a petty farming trade."&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. Ernest Coleridge. (1895). ''Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge'', vol. 1, p. 140. Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston and New York. {{ISBN|1-4212-7161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the winter of 1795, the dream of Pantisocracy had all but died out.

==Impact on Coleridge==

There are two of Coleridge’s poems that directly address the plans he and Southey were envisioning. "Pantisocracy," a sonnet sent to Southey in a letter of September 18, 1794, was not published during Coleridge’s lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Samuel Taylor. Ed. William Keach. (1997). ''The Complete Poems'', p. 57-58. Houghton Mifflin &amp; Co., Boston and New York. {{ISBN|1-4212-7161-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second sonnet, "On the Prospect of Establishing a Pantisocracy," has also been attributed to Coleridge, and was first published in 1826. Many of Coleridge's other works of the time implicitly suggest the New World, and may owe a debt to his musings over the Susquehanna.&lt;ref&gt;Cottle, Joseph. (1847). ''Reminiscences of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and Robert Southey'', p. 22. Houlston and Stoneman, London.&lt;/ref&gt; An early version of the poem "To a Young Ass" also makes mention of Pantisocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Woodring, Carl R. (1961). ''Politics in the Poetry of Coleridge'', p. 70. The University of Wisconsin Press, Madison. {{ISBN|978-0-299-02440-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pantisocracy presented Coleridge a practical outlet for ideas he had previously only considered theoretically.&lt;ref&gt;Colmer, John. Ed. R.L. Brett. (1971). '"Coleridge and Politics," in ''Writers and Their Background: S.T. Coleridge'' p. 254 . G. Bell &amp; Sons, London. {{ISBN|0-7135-1900-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the scheme never produced an actual community, it did impact Coleridge's philosophical thinking. His lectures of the time reflect his Pantisocratic thinking on social relations and wealth. He wrote of the scheme years afterward that it was “a plan as harmless as it was extravagant” but it can be argued that much of the fantastic imagery and political thoughts present in his work owe a debt both to Pantisocracy and to the research he conducted in preparation for his voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Sister Eugenia (1930).  "Coleridge's Scheme of Pantisocracy and American Travel Accounts", in ''PMLA'' p. 1084. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/457827] 28/1/2010&lt;/ref&gt; On a literal level, perhaps the greatest impact Pantisocracy had on the young Coleridge was the addition of Sara Fricker (and their subsequent family) to his life.

'''Pattern theory''', formulated by [[Ulf Grenander]], is a mathematical [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalism]] to describe knowledge of the world as patterns. It differs from other approaches to [[artificial intelligence]] in that it does not begin by prescribing [[algorithm]]s and machinery to recognize and classify patterns; rather, it prescribes a vocabulary to articulate and recast the pattern concepts in precise language.

In addition to the new algebraic vocabulary, its [[Statistics|statistical]] approach is novel in its aim to:
* Identify the [[Latent variable|hidden variables]] of a [[data set]] using real world data rather than artificial stimuli, which was previously commonplace.
* Formulate prior distributions for hidden variables and models for the observed variables that form the vertices of a [[Gibbs sampling|Gibbs]]-like graph.
* Study the randomness and variability of these graphs.
* Create the basic classes of [[stochastic]] models applied by listing the deformations of the patterns.
* Synthesize (sample) from the models, not just analyze signals with them.
Broad in its mathematical coverage, Pattern Theory spans algebra and statistics, as well as local topological and global entropic properties.

The [[Brown University]] Pattern Theory Group was formed in 1972 by [https://web.archive.org/web/20090122102751/http://www.dam.brown.edu/pattern/ug.html Ulf Grenander]. Many mathematicians are currently working in this group, noteworthy among them being the [[Fields Medal]]ist [[David Mumford]].  Mumford regards Grenander as his "guru" in this subject.

==Example: Natural Language Grammar==
[[File:grammar automaton.png|right|thumb|200px|Grammar automaton]]
[[File:generator list.png|right|frame|Grammar generators]]

We begin with an example to motivate the algebraic definitions that follow. If we want to represent language patterns, the most immediate candidate for primitives might be words.  However, [[set phrase]]s, such as “in order to”, immediately indicate the inappropriateness of words as atoms.  In searching for other primitives, we might try the rules of [[grammar]].  We can represent grammars as [[finite state automata]] or [[context-free grammar]]s.  Below is a sample finite state grammar automaton.

The following phrases are generated from a few simple rules of the [[automaton]] and programming code in pattern theory:
:: ''the boy who owned the small cottage went to the deep forest''
:: ''the prince walked to the lake''
:: ''the girl walked to the lake and the princess went to the lake''
:: ''the pretty prince walked to the dark forest''
To create such sentences, rewriting rules in finite state automata act as [[generator (mathematics)|generators]] to create the sentences as follows: if a machine starts in state 1, it goes to state 2 and writes the word “the”.  From state 2, it writes one of 4 words:  prince, boy, princess, girl, chosen at random. The probability of choosing any given word is given by the [[Markov chain]] corresponding to the automaton.  Such a simplistic automaton occasionally generates more awkward sentences
:: ''the evil evil prince walked to the lake''
:: ''the prince walked to the dark forest and the prince walked to a forest and the princess who lived in some big small big cottage who owned the small big small house went to a forest''

From the finite state diagram we can infer the following generators (shown at right) that creates the  signal.  A generator is a 4-tuple:  current state, next state, word written, probability of written word when there are multiple choices.  That is, each generator is a [[state transition]] arrow of [[state diagram]] for a Markov chain.

Imagine that a configuration of generators are strung together linearly so its output forms a sentence, so each generator "bonds" to the generators before and after it.  Denote these bonds as 1a,1b,2a,2b,…12a,12b.  Each numerical label corresponds to the automaton's state and each letter "a" and "b" corresponds to the inbound and outbound bonds.  Then the following bond table (left) is equivalent to the automaton diagram. For the sake of simplicity, only half of the bond table is shown—the table is actually [[Symmetry|symmetric]].

As one can tell from this example, and typical of signals that are studied, identifying the primitives and bond tables requires some thought.  The example highlights another important fact not readily apparent in other signals problems: that a configuration is not the signal that is observed; rather, its image as a sentence is observed.  Herein lies a significant justification for distinguishing an observable from a non-observable construct.  Additionally, it provides an algebraic structure to associate with [[hidden Markov model]]s.  In sensory examples such as the vision example below, the hidden configurations and observed images are much more similar, and such a distinction may not seem justified.  Fortunately, the grammar example reminds us of this distinction.

A more sophisticated example can be found in the [[link grammar]] theory of [[natural language]].

==Algebraic foundations==
Motivated by the example, we have the following definitions:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A '''generator''' &lt;math&gt;g{\in}G&lt;/math&gt;, drawn as
:[[File:Generators 1.jpg|300px|1 and 2 dimensional generators]]
is the primitive of Pattern Theory that generates the observed signal.   Structurally, it is a value with interfaces, called bonds &lt;math&gt;b{\in}B&lt;/math&gt;, which connects the &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;'s to form a signal generator.  2 neighboring generators are connected when their bond values are the same.  Similarity self-maps &lt;math&gt;s{\in}S&lt;/math&gt; s: G -&gt; G express the invariances of the world we are looking at, such as rigid body transformations, or scaling.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  Bonds glue generators into a '''configuration''', c, which creates the signal against a backdrop '''Σ''', with global features described locally by a bond coupling table called &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;.  The boolean function &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the principal component of the regularity 4-tuple &lt;G,S, &amp;rho;,Σ&gt;, which is defined as

: &lt;math&gt; \rho(c) = \prod_{ \text{neighboring bonds }b',b'' \in c } \rho(b',b'' ). &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; seems to capture the notion of allowable generator neighbors.  That is, Regularity is the law of the stimulus domain defining, via a bond table, what neighbors are acceptable for a generator.  It is the laws of the stimulus domain.  Later, we will relax regularity from a boolean function to a probability value, it would capture what stimulus neighbors are probable.

'''Σ''' is the physical arrangement of the generators.  In vision, it could be a 2-dimensional lattice.  In language, it is a linear arrangement.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  An '''image''' (C mod R) captures the notion of an observed Configuration, as opposed to one which exists independently from any perceptual apparatus.  Images are configurations distinguished only by their external bonds, inheriting the configuration’s composition and similarities transformations.  Formally, images are equivalence classes partitioned by an Identification Rule "~" with 3 properties:
# ext(c) = ext(c') whenever c~c'
# sc~sc' whenever c~c'
# sigma(c1,c2) ~ sigma(c1',c2') whenever c1~c1', c2~c2' are all regular.
A configuration corresponding to a physical stimulus may have many images, corresponding to many observer perception's identification rule.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A '''pattern'''  is the repeatable components of an image, defined as the S-invariant subset of an image.  Similarities are reference transformations we use to define patterns, e.g. rigid body transformations.  At first glance, this definition seems suited for only texture patterns where the minimal sub-image is repeated over and over again.  If we were to view an image of an object such as a dog, it is not repeated, yet seem like it seems familiar and should be a pattern.  (Help needed here).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;  A '''deformation''' is a transformation of the original image that accounts for the noise in the environment and error in the perceptual apparatus.  Grenander identifies 4 types of deformations:  noise and blur, multi-scale superposition, domain warping, and interruptions.

:'''Example 2'''  Directed boundary
[[File:directed boundary configuration.jpg|right|thumb|Configuration]]
[[File:directed boundary image.jpg|right|thumb|Image]]
[[File:directed boundary generators.jpg|right|thumb|Generators]]
:This configuration of generators generating the image is created by primitives woven together by the bonding table, and perceived by an observer with the identification rule that maps non "0" &amp; "1" generators to a single boundary element.  Nine other undepicted generators are created by rotating each of the non-"0"&amp;"1" generators by 90 degrees.  Keeping the feature of "directed boundaries" in mind, the generators are cooked with some thought and is interpreted as follows:  the "0" generator corresponds to interior elements, "1" to the exterior, "2" and its rotations are straight elements, and the remainder are the turning elements.

:With Boolean regularity defined as Product (all nbr bonds), any configurations with even a single generator violating the bond table is discarded from consideration.  Thus only features in its purest form with all neighboring generators adhering to the bond table are allowed.  This stringent condition can be relaxed using probability measures instead of Boolean bond tables.

::&lt;math&gt;p(c) = \prod_{ \text{neighboring bonds }b',b'' \in c } A(b',b'' ) &lt;/math&gt;

:The new regularity no longer dictates a perfect directed boundary, but it defines a probability of a configuration in terms of the Acceptor function A().  Such configurations are allowed to have impurities and imperfections with respect to the feature of interest.

With the benefit of being given generators and complete bond tables, a difficult part of pattern analysis is done.  In tackling a new class of signals and features, the task of devising the generators and bond table is much more difficult

Again, just as in grammars, identifying the generators and bond tables require some thought.  Just as subtle is the fact that a configuration is not the signal we observe. Rather, we observe its image as silhouette projections of the identification rule.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==Entropy==
Pattern Theory defines order in terms of the feature of interest given by ''p''(''c'').

: Energy(''c'') = &amp;minus;log ''P''(''c'')

==Statistics==

Grenander’s Pattern Theory treatment of [[Bayesian inference]] in seems to be skewed towards on image reconstruction (e.g. content addressable memory).  That is given image I-deformed, find I.  However, Mumford’s interpretation of Pattern Theory is broader and he defines PT to include many more well-known statistical methods.  Mumford’s criteria for inclusion of a topic as Pattern Theory are those methods "characterized by common techniques and motivations", such as the [[Hidden Markov model|HMM]], [[Expectation Maximization|EM algorithm]], [[dynamic programming]] circle of ideas.  Topics in this section will reflect Mumford's treatment of Pattern Theory.  His principle of statistical Pattern Theory are the following:
* Use real world signals rather than constructed ones to infer the hidden states of interest.
* Such signals contain too much complexity and artifacts to succumb to a purely deterministic analysis, so employ stochastic methods too.
* Respect the natural structure of the signal, including any symmetries, independence of parts, marginals on key statistics.  Validate by sampling from the derived models by and infer hidden states with Bayes’ rule.
* Across all modalities, a limited family of deformations distort the ''pure patterns'' into real world signals.
* Stochastic factors affecting an observation show strong conditional independence.

Statistical PT makes ubiquitous use of conditional probability in the form of [[Bayes theorem]] and [[Hidden Markov models|Markov]] Models.  Both these concepts are used to express the relation between hidden states (configurations) and observed states (images).  Markov Models also captures the local properties of the stimulus, reminiscent of the purpose of bond table for regularity.

The generic set up is the following:
Let ''s'' = the hidden state of the data that we wish to know.  ''i'' = observed image.  Bayes theorem gives

:: ''p'' (''s'' | ''i'' ) ''p''(''i'') = ''p'' (''s'', ''i'' ) = ''p'' (''i''|''s'' ) ''p''(''s'')

:To analyze the signal (recognition):  fix i, maximize p, infer s.
:To synthesize signals (sampling): fix s, generate i's, compare w/ real world images

The following conditional probability examples illustrates these methods in action:

===Conditional probability for local properties===

===Conditional probability for hidden-observed states===
====Bayes Theorem for Machine translation====
Supposing we want to translate French sentences to English. Here, the hidden configurations are English sentences and the observed signal they generate are French sentences. Bayes theorem gives ''p''(''e''|''f'')''p''(''f'') = ''p''(''e'', ''f'') = ''p''(''f''|''e'')''p''(''e'') and reduces to the fundamental equation of machine translation: maximize ''p''(''e''|''f'') = ''p''(''f''|''e'')''p''(''e'') over the appropriate ''e'' (note that ''p''(''f'') is independent of ''e'', and so drops out when we maximize over ''e'').  This reduces the problem to three main calculations for:
# ''p''(''e'') for any given ''e'', using the ''N''-gram method and dynamic programming
# ''p''(''f''|''e'') for any given ''e'' and ''f'', using alignments and an [[EM algorithm|expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm]]
# ''e'' that maximizes the product of 1 and 2, again, using dynamic programming
The analysis seems to be symmetric with respect to the two languages, and if we think can calculate ''p''(''f''|''e''), why not turn the analysis around and calculate ''p''(''e''|''f'') directly?  The reason is that during the calculation of ''p''(''f''|''e'') the asymmetric assumption is made that source sentence be well formed and we cannot make any such assumption about the target translation because we do not know what it will translate into.

We now focus on ''p''(''f''|''e'') in the three-part decomposition above.  The other two parts, ''p''(''e'') and maximizing ''e'', uses similar techniques as the ''N''-gram model.  Given a French-English translation from a large training data set (such data sets exists from the Canadian parliament),
        NULL   And    the    program      has    been    implemented
                      Le     programme    a ete     mis en application
the sentence pair can be encoded as an ''alignment'' (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6) that reads as follows: the first word in French comes from the second English word, the second word in French comes from the 3rd English word, and so forth.  Although an alignment is a straightforward encoding of the translation, a more computationally convenient approach to an alignment is to break it down into four parameters:
# ''Fertility'':  the number of words in the French string that will be connected to it.  E.g. ''n''( 3 | implemented ) = probability that “implemented” translates into three words – the word’s fertility
# ''Spuriousness'':  we introduce the artifact NULL as a word to represent the probability of tossing in a spurious French word.  E.g. {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and its complement will be {{math|1=''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
# ''Translation'':  the translated version of each word.  E.g. ''t''(''a'' | has ) = translation probability that the English "has" translates into the French "a".
# ''Distortion'':  the actual positions in the French string that these words will occupy.  E.g.  ''d''( 5 | 2, 4, 6 ) = distortion of second position French word moving into the fifth position English word for a four-word English sentence and a six-word French sentence.  We encode the alignments this way to  easily represent and extract priors from our training data and the new formula becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
p(f|e) &amp; = \text{Sum over all possible alignments an of } p(a, f | e ) \\
&amp; = n_0(v_0 | \sum_{j=1}^{l}{v_j} )
\cdot \prod_{j=1}^{l} n(v_j | e_j)v_j! 
\cdot \prod_{j=1}^{m} t(f_j | e_{a_j}) 
\cdot \prod_{j:a_j\not =0}^{m} d(j | a_j,l,m)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

For the sake of simplicity in demonstrating an EM algorithm, we shall go through a simple calculation involving only translation probabilities ''t''(), but needless to say that it the method applies to all parameters in their full glory.  Consider the simplified case (1) without the NULL word (2) where  every word has fertility 1 and (3) there are no distortion probabilities.  Our training data corpus will contain two-sentence pairs: ''bc''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''xy'' and ''b''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''y''.  The translation of a two-word English sentence “b c” into the French sentence “''x y''” has two possible alignments, and including the one-sentence words, the alignments are:
                          b c   b c   b
                          | |    x    |
                          x y   x y   y
called Parallel, Crossed, and Singleton respectively.

To illustrate an EM algorithm, first set the desired parameter uniformly, that is

: ''t''(''x'' | ''b'' ) = ''t''(''y'' | ''b'' ) = ''t''(''x'' | ''c'' ) = ''t''(''y'' | ''c'' ) = {{frac|1|2}}

Then EM iterates as follows
[[File:em iterations.jpg|frame|center|Iterations of an EM algorithm]]

The alignment probability for the “crossing alignment” (where ''b'' connects to ''y'') got a boost from the second sentence pair ''b''/''y''.  That further solidified ''t''(''y'' | ''b''), but as a side effect also boosted ''t''(''x'' | ''c''), because ''x'' connects to ''c'' in that same “crossing alignment.”  The effect of boosting ''t''(''x'' | ''c'') necessarily means downgrading ''t''(''y'' | ''c'') because they sum to one.  So, even though ''y'' and ''c'' co-occur, analysis reveals that they are not translations of each other.  With real data, EM also is subject to the usual local extremum traps.

====HMMs for speech recognition====
[[File:ski recording.jpg|left|thumb|400px|Vibrational breakdown of "ski"]]
For decades, speech recognition seemed to hit an impasse as scientists sought descriptive and analytic solution.  The [[sound wave]] p(t) below is produced by speaking the word “ski”.

Its four distinct segments has very different characteristics.   One can choose from many levels of generators (hidden variables): the intention of the speaker’s brain, the state of the mouth and vocal cords, or the ‘phones’ themselves.  Phones are the generator of choice to be inferred and it encodes the word in a noisy, highly variable way.  Early work on speech recognition attempted to make this inference deterministically using logical rules based on binary features extracted from p(t).  For instance, the table below shows some of the features used to distinguish [[English consonants]].

In real situations, the signal is further complicated by background noises such as cars driving by or artifacts such as a cough in mid sentence (Mumford’s 2nd underpinning).  The deterministic rule-based approach failed and the state of the art (e.g. Dragon Naturally Speaking) is to use  a family of precisely tuned HMMs and Bayesian MAP estimators to do better.  Similar stories played out in vision, and other stimulus categories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20591">[[File:Intersecting planes.svg|thumb|Two intersecting planes in three-dimensional space]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''plane''' is a flat, two-[[dimension]]al [[surface (topology)|surface]] that extends infinitely far. A plane is the [[two-dimensional space|two-dimensional analogue]] of a [[point (geometry)|point]] (zero dimensions), a [[line (geometry)|line]] (one dimension) and [[three-dimensional space]]. Planes can arise as subspaces of some higher-dimensional space, as with a room's walls extended infinitely far, or they may enjoy an independent existence in their own right, as in the setting of [[Euclidean geometry]].

When working exclusively in two-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], the definite article is used, so, ''the'' plane refers to the whole space. Many fundamental tasks in mathematics, [[geometry]], [[trigonometry]], [[graph theory]], and [[graph of a function|graphing]] are performed in a two-dimensional space, or, in other words, in the plane.

==Euclidean geometry==
{{Main|Euclidean geometry}}

[[Euclid]] set forth the first great landmark of mathematical thought, an axiomatic treatment of geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc= pg. 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He selected a small core of undefined terms (called ''common notions'') and postulates (or [[axiom]]s) which he then used to prove various geometrical statements. Although the plane in its modern sense is not directly given a definition anywhere in the ''Elements'', it may be thought of as part of the common notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
|last= Joyce
|first= D. E.
|title= Euclid's Elements, Book I, Definition 7
|publisher= Clark University
|year= 1996
|url= http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/defI7.html
|accessdate= 8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Euclid never used numbers to measure length, angle, or area. In this way the Euclidean plane is not quite the same as the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] plane.
&lt;!--In higher-dimensional Euclidean space, a plane inside this space can be uniquely determined by any of the following sets of objects:

*three [[non-collinear points]] (i.e. not lying on the same [[line (mathematics)|line]])
*a line and a point not on the line
*two distinct intersecting lines --&gt;

[[File:Planes parallel.svg|thumb|right|150px|Three parallel planes.]]
&lt;!--In 3 dimensional Euclidean space, planes, like [[line (geometry)|line]]s, can be [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or intersecting. Lines drawn on two parallel planes will either be parallel or [[skew lines|skew]] but will not intersect. Intersecting planes may be [[perpendicular]] or may form any number of other angles. In Euclidean spaces of more than 3 dimensions, it is possible to have two planes that intersect in a single point.--&gt;

A plane is a [[ruled surface]].

==Planes embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space==
This section is solely concerned with planes embedded in three dimensions: specifically, in [[Cartesian product|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;]].

===Determination by contained points and lines===
In a Euclidean space of any number of dimensions, a plane is uniquely determined by any of the following:
*Three non-[[collinear]] points (points not on a single line).
*A line and a point not on that line.
*Two distinct but intersecting lines.
*Two [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] lines.

===Properties===
The following statements hold in three-dimensional Euclidean space but not in higher dimensions, though they have higher-dimensional analogues:

*Two distinct planes are either parallel or they intersect in a [[line (geometry)|line]].
*A line is either parallel to a plane, intersects it at a single point, or is contained in the plane.
*Two distinct lines [[perpendicular]] to the same plane must be parallel to each other.
*Two distinct planes perpendicular to the same line must be parallel to each other.

===Point-normal form and general form of the equation of a plane===
In a manner analogous to the way lines in a two-dimensional space are described using a point-slope form for their equations, planes in a three dimensional space have a natural description using a point in the plane and a vector orthogonal to it (the [[normal vector]]) to indicate its "inclination".

Specifically, let {{math|'''''r'''''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} be the position vector of some point {{math|1=''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and let {{math|1='''''n''''' = (''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} be a nonzero vector. The plane determined by the point {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the vector {{mvar|'''n'''}} consists of those points {{math|''P''}}, with position vector {{mvar|'''r'''}}, such that the vector drawn from {{math|''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} to {{math|''P''}} is perpendicular to {{mvar|'''n'''}}. Recalling that two vectors are perpendicular if and only if their dot product is zero, it follows that the desired plane can be described as the set of all points {{mvar|'''r'''}} such that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r}_0)=0.&lt;/math&gt;
(The dot here means a [[dot product|dot (scalar) product]].)
Expanded this becomes
:&lt;math&gt; a (x-x_0)+ b(y-y_0)+ c(z-z_0)=0,&lt;/math&gt;
which is the ''point-normal'' form of the equation of a plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anton|1994|loc=p. 155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is just a [[linear equation]]
:&lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; d = -(ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0).&lt;/math&gt;
Conversely, it is easily shown that if {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} and {{math|''d''}} are constants and {{math|''a'', ''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are not all zero, then the graph of the equation
::&lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
is a plane having the vector {{math|1='''''n''''' = (''a'', ''b'', ''c'')}} as a normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Anton|1994|loc=p. 156}}&lt;/ref&gt; This familiar equation for a plane is called the ''general form'' of the equation of the plane.&lt;ref name=Weisstein2009&gt;{{Citation
|title= Plane

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus for example a [[regression equation]] of the form {{math|1=''y'' = ''d'' + ''ax'' + ''cz''}} (with {{math|1=''b'' = −1}}) establishes a best-fit plane in three-dimensional space when there are two explanatory variables.

===Describing a plane with a point and two vectors lying on it===
Alternatively, a plane may be described parametrically as the set of all points of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = \mathbf {r}_0 + s \mathbf{v} + t \mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:PlaneR.jpg|thumb|Vector description of a plane]]
where ''s'' and ''t'' range over all real numbers, '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} are given [[linear independence|linearly independent]] [[vector (geometry)|vectors]] defining the plane, and {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the vector representing the position of an arbitrary (but fixed) point on the plane. The vectors '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} can be visualized as vectors starting at {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and pointing in different directions along the plane. Note that '''{{math|v}}''' and {{math|'''w'''}} can be [[perpendicular]], but cannot be parallel.

===Describing a plane through three points===
Let {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, and {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{=}}(x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, z&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)}} be non-collinear points.

====Method 1====
The plane passing through {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be described as the set of all points (x,y,z) that satisfy the following [[determinant]] equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{vmatrix}
x - x_1 &amp; y - y_1 &amp; z - z_1 \\
x_2 - x_1 &amp; y_2 - y_1&amp; z_2 - z_1 \\
x_3 - x_1 &amp; y_3 - y_1 &amp; z_3 - z_1
\end{vmatrix} =\begin{vmatrix}
x - x_1 &amp; y - y_1 &amp; z - z_1 \\
x - x_2 &amp; y - y_2 &amp; z - z_2 \\
x - x_3 &amp; y - y_3 &amp; z - z_3
\end{vmatrix} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

====Method 2====
To describe the plane by an equation of the form &lt;math&gt; ax + by + cz + d = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, solve the following system of equations:
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_1 + by_1 + cz_1 + d = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_2 + by_2 + cz_2 + d = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\, ax_3 + by_3 + cz_3 + d = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

This system can be solved using [[Cramer's rule]] and basic matrix manipulations. Let
: &lt;math&gt;D = \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\
x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \\
x_3 &amp; y_3 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;.

If ''D'' is non-zero (so for planes not through the origin) the values for ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' can be calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;a = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
1 &amp; y_1 &amp; z_1 \\
1 &amp; y_2 &amp; z_2 \\
1 &amp; y_3 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; 1 &amp; z_1 \\
x_2 &amp; 1 &amp; z_2 \\
x_3 &amp; 1 &amp; z_3
\end{vmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{-d}{D} \begin{vmatrix}
x_1 &amp; y_1 &amp; 1 \\
x_2 &amp; y_2 &amp; 1 \\
x_3 &amp; y_3 &amp; 1
\end{vmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

These equations are parametric in ''d''. Setting ''d'' equal to any non-zero number and substituting it into these equations will yield one solution set.

====Method 3====
This plane can also be described by the "[[plane_(geometry)#Point-normal_form_and_general_form_of_the_equation_of_a_plane|point and a normal vector]]" prescription above. A suitable normal vector is given by the [[cross product]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf n = ( \mathbf p_2 - \mathbf p_1 ) \times ( \mathbf p_3 - \mathbf p_1 ), &lt;/math&gt;
and the point {{math|'''r'''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} can be taken to be any of the given points {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}},{{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} or {{math|'''p'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}&lt;ref name=PaulsPlanes&gt;{{citation
|last= Dawkins
|first= Paul
|title= Calculus III
|chapter= Equations of Planes
|chapterurl= http://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcIII/EqnsOfPlanes.aspx
}}&lt;/ref&gt; (or any other point in the plane).

===Distance from a point to a plane===
{{Main|Distance from a point to a plane}}
For a plane &lt;math&gt;\Pi : ax + by + cz + d = 0&lt;/math&gt; and a point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1 = (x_1,y_1,z_1) &lt;/math&gt; not necessarily lying on the plane, the shortest distance from &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1&lt;/math&gt; to the plane is
:&lt;math&gt; D = \frac{\left | a x_1 + b y_1 + c z_1+d \right |}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

It follows that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf p_1&lt;/math&gt; lies in the plane [[if and only if]] ''D=0''.

If &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}=1&lt;/math&gt; meaning that ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are normalized&lt;ref&gt;To normalize arbitrary coefficients, divide each of ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' and ''d'' by &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2}&lt;/math&gt; (which can not be 0). The "new" coefficients are now normalized and the following formula is valid for the "new" coefficients.&lt;/ref&gt; then the equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt; D = \ | a x_1 + b y_1 + c z_1+d |.&lt;/math&gt;

Another vector form for the equation of a plane, known as the [[Hesse normal form]] relies on the parameter ''D''. This form is:&lt;ref name=Weisstein2009/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r} - D_0 = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a unit normal vector to the plane, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}&lt;/math&gt; a position vector of a point of the plane and ''D''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the distance of the plane from the origin.

The general formula for higher dimensions can be quickly arrived at using [[vector notation]]. Let the [[hyperplane]] have equation &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, where the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[normal vector]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_0 = (x_{10},x_{20},\dots,x_{N0})&lt;/math&gt; is a [[position vector]] to a point in the [[hyperplane]]. We desire the perpendicular distance to the point &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1 = (x_{11},x_{21},\dots,x_{N1})&lt;/math&gt;. The [[hyperplane]] may also be represented by the scalar equation &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^N a_i x_i = -a_0&lt;/math&gt;, for constants &lt;math&gt;\{a_i\}&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, a corresponding &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt; may be represented as &lt;math&gt;(a_1,a_2, \dots, a_N)&lt;/math&gt;. We desire the [[scalar projection]] of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}&lt;/math&gt;. Noting that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{r}_0 = \mathbf{r}_0 \cdot \mathbf{n} = -a_0&lt;/math&gt; (as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{r}_0&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the equation of the [[hyperplane]]) we have
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
D &amp;= \frac{|(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0) \cdot \mathbf{n}|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|\mathbf{r}_1\cdot \mathbf{n} - \mathbf{r}_0 \cdot \mathbf{n}|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|\mathbf{r}_1\cdot \mathbf{n} + a_0|}{|\mathbf{n}|} \\
&amp;= \frac{|a_1x_{11} + a_2x_{21} + \dots + a_Nx_{N1} + a_0|}{\sqrt{a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \dots + a_N^2}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.

===Line of intersection between two planes===
The line of intersection between two planes &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 : \mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf r = h_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2 : \mathbf {n}_2 \cdot \mathbf r = h_2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_i&lt;/math&gt; are normalized is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf {r} = (c_1 \mathbf {n}_1 + c_2 \mathbf {n}_2) + \lambda (\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2) &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt; c_1 = \frac{ h_1 - h_2(\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2) }{ 1 - (\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2)^2 } &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; c_2 = \frac{ h_2 - h_1(\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2) }{ 1 - (\mathbf {n}_1 \cdot \mathbf {n}_2)^2 }.&lt;/math&gt;

This is found by noticing that the line must be perpendicular to both plane normals, and so parallel to their cross product &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt; (this cross product is zero if and only if the planes are parallel, and are therefore non-intersecting or entirely coincident).

The remainder of the expression is arrived at by finding an arbitrary point on the line. To do so, consider that any point in space may be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r = c_1\mathbf {n}_1 + c_2\mathbf {n}_2 + \lambda(\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;\{ \mathbf {n}_1, \mathbf {n}_2, (\mathbf {n}_1 \times \mathbf {n}_2) \}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. We wish to find a point which is on both planes (i.e. on their intersection), so insert this equation into each of the equations of the planes to get two simultaneous equations which can be solved for &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;.

If we further assume that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt; are [[orthonormal]] then the closest point on the line of intersection to the origin is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf r_0 = h_1\mathbf {n}_1 + h_2\mathbf {n}_2&lt;/math&gt;. If that is not the case, then a more complex procedure must be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Plane-PlaneIntersection.html Plane-Plane Intersection - from Wolfram MathWorld].

===Dihedral angle===
{{See also|Dihedral angle}}
Given two intersecting planes described by &lt;math&gt;\Pi_1 : a_1 x + b_1 y + c_1 z + d_1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Pi_2 : a_2 x + b_2 y + c_2 z + d_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;, the [[dihedral angle]] between them is defined to be the angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; between their normal directions:
:&lt;math&gt;\cos\alpha = \frac{\hat n_1\cdot \hat n_2}{|\hat n_1||\hat n_2|} = \frac{a_1 a_2 + b_1 b_2 + c_1 c_2}{\sqrt{a_1^2+b_1^2+c_1^2}\sqrt{a_2^2+b_2^2+c_2^2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Planes in various areas of mathematics==
In addition to its familiar [[geometric]] structure, with [[isomorphism]]s that are [[isometry|isometries]] with respect to the usual inner product, the plane may be viewed at various other levels of [[abstraction (mathematics)|abstraction]]. Each level of abstraction corresponds to a specific [[category (mathematics)|category]].

At one extreme, all geometrical and [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] concepts may be dropped to leave the [[topological]] plane, which may be thought of as an idealized [[homotopy|homotopically]] trivial infinite rubber sheet, which retains a notion of proximity, but has no distances. The topological plane has a concept of a linear path, but no concept of a straight line. The topological plane, or its equivalent the open disc, is the basic topological neighborhood used to construct [[surface (topology)|surface]]s (or 2-manifolds) classified in [[low-dimensional topology]]. Isomorphisms of the topological plane are all [[continuous function|continuous]] [[bijection]]s. The topological plane is the natural context for the branch of [[graph theory]] that deals with [[planar graphs]], and results such as the [[four color theorem]].

The plane may also be viewed as an [[affine space]], whose isomorphisms are combinations of translations and non-singular linear maps. From this viewpoint there are no distances, but [[collinearity]] and ratios of distances on any line are preserved.

[[Differential geometry]] views a plane as a 2-dimensional real [[manifold]], a topological plane which is provided with a [[differential structure]]. Again in this case, there is no notion of distance, but there is now a concept of smoothness of maps, for example a [[differentiable function|differentiable]] or [[smooth function|smooth]] path (depending on the type of differential structure applied). The isomorphisms in this case are bijections with the chosen degree of differentiability.

In the opposite direction of abstraction, we may apply a compatible field structure to the geometric plane, giving rise to the [[complex plane]] and the major area of [[complex analysis]]. The complex field has only two isomorphisms that leave the real line fixed, the identity and [[complex conjugation|conjugation]].

In the same way as in the real case, the plane may also be viewed as the simplest, one-dimensional (over the complex numbers) [[complex manifold]], sometimes called the complex line. However, this viewpoint contrasts sharply with the case of the plane as a 2-dimensional real manifold. The isomorphisms are all [[conformal map|conformal]] bijections of the complex plane, but the only possibilities are maps that correspond to the composition of a multiplication by a complex number and a translation.

In addition, the Euclidean geometry (which has zero [[curvature]] everywhere) is not the only geometry that the plane may have. The plane may be given a [[spherical geometry]] by using the [[stereographic projection]]. This can be thought of as placing a sphere on the plane (just like a ball on the floor), removing the top point, and projecting the sphere onto the plane from this point). This is one of the projections that may be used in making a flat map of part of the Earth's surface. The resulting geometry has constant positive curvature.

Alternatively, the plane can also be given a metric which gives it constant negative curvature giving the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]]. The latter possibility finds an application in the theory of [[special relativity]] in the simplified case where there are two spatial dimensions and one time dimension. (The hyperbolic plane is a [[timelike]] [[hypersurface]] in three-dimensional [[Minkowski space]].)

==Topological and differential geometric notions==
The [[one-point compactification]] of the plane is homeomorphic to a [[sphere]] (see [[stereographic projection]]); the open disk is homeomorphic to a sphere with the "north pole" missing; adding that point completes the (compact) sphere. The result of this compactification is a [[manifold]] referred to as the [[Riemann sphere]] or the [[complex numbers|complex]] [[projective line]]. The projection from the Euclidean plane to a sphere without a point is a [[diffeomorphism]] and even a [[conformal map]].

The plane itself is homeomorphic (and diffeomorphic) to an open [[disk (mathematics)|disk]]. For the [[hyperbolic geometry|hyperbolic plane]] such diffeomorphism is conformal, but for the Euclidean plane it is not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1436">'''Psychic assault''' is a term used by academic legal writers as a synonym for [[assault]] (or [[common assault]]) in order to distinguish that offence from the related crime of [[battery (crime)|battery]] and so avoid confusion. The need for this term arises from the fact that the word assault is frequently used to refer collectively both to that offence and to battery.

The word 'psychic' is used to denote the fact that the [[actus reus]] of the offence that is correctly described as assault consists of affecting the mind of the other person (whereas battery consists of the application of force).

[[File:Income Tax Germany 2010.png|thumb|German [[progressive tax]] rates for different incomes. Progressive tax systems require the rich to pay taxes at higher rates, to make it possible to raise larger total sums to pay for governmental functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Investopedia|title=The Advantages of a Progressive Tax|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue such systems are primarily for wealth redistribution.]]

'''Redistribution of income''' and '''redistribution of wealth''' are respectively the transfer of [[income]] and of [[wealth]] (including physical [[property]]) from some [[individual]]s to others by means of a social mechanism such as [[taxation]], [[charity (practice)|charity]], [[welfare]], [[public services]], [[land reform]], [[monetary policies]], [[confiscation]], [[divorce]] or [[tort]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/redistribution/ |title=Redistribution |date=2 July 2004 |work=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  |publisher=Stanford University |quote=The ''social mechanism'', such as a change in tax laws, monetary policies, or tort law, that engenders the redistribution of goods among these subjects|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term typically refers to redistribution on an economy-wide basis rather than between selected individuals.

Interpretations of the phrase vary, depending on personal perspectives, political ideologies and the selective use of statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kessler|first1=Glenn|title=Fact Checker: Elizabeth Warren’s claim that the bottom 90 percent got ‘zero percent’ of wage growth after Reagan.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/10/23/elizabeth-warrens-claim-that-the-bottom-90-percent-got-zero-percent-of-wage-growth-after-reagan/|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is frequently heard in politics, usually referring to perceived redistributions from those who have more to those who have less.  Occasionally, however, it is used to describe laws or policies that cause opposite redistributions that shift monetary burdens from wealthy to low-income individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reich|first1=Robert|title=Trump’s Stock in Trade is Cruelty. Count the ways.|url=http://www.newsweek.com/robert-reich-trumps-stock-trade-cruelty-count-ways-594472|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase can be emotionally charged and used to exaggerate or misconstrue the motivations of opponents during political debates.  For example, if an individual politician calls for increased taxes on higher income individuals, their sole focus may be to raise funds for specific government programs, tapping the largest available sources while realizing that low-wage workers have little or no excess income to draw tax revenues from. Political opponents might argue that this politician's prime motivation is to redistribute wealth, when redistribution is not their goal.

The phrase is often coupled with the term "[[Class conflict|class warfare]]," with high income earners and the wealthy portrayed as victims of unfairness and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=FAIR|title=For Media, ‘Class War’ Has Wealthy Victims, Rich getting richer seldom labeled as belligerents.|url=http://fair.org/extra/for-media-class-war-has-wealthy-victims/|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Redistribution tax policy should not be confused with [[predistribution]] policies.  "Predistribution" is the idea that the state should try to prevent inequalities occurring in the first place rather than through the tax and benefits system once they have occurred.  For example, a government predistribution policy might require employers to pay all employees a [[living wage]], not just a [[minimum wage]], as a "bottom-up" response to widespread income inequalities or high poverty rates.

Many alternate taxation proposals have been floated without the political will to alter the status quo. One example is the proposed "[[Buffett Rule]]", which is a hybrid taxation model composed of opposing systems, intended to minimize the favoritism of the special interest tax design.

The effects of a redistribution system are actively debated on ethical and economic grounds. The subject includes analysis of its rationales, objectives, means, and policy effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;F.A. Cowell ([1987] 2008).  "redistribution of income and wealth," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition, [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_R000067&amp;edition=current&amp;q= TOC.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20140127"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Rugaber |first1=Christopher S. |last2=Boak |first2=Josh |title=Wealth gap: A guide to what it is, why it matters |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20140127/DABJ40P00.html |date=January 27, 2014 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=January 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 survey among 264 members of the [[American Economic Association]] found that 71.2% of them support redistribution, while 20.4% oppose it, and 7.2% had mixed feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Daniel B.|last2=Stern|first2=Charlotta|title=Economists’ policy views and voting|journal=Public Choice|date=2006|volume=126|issue=3-4|page=337|doi=10.1007/s11127-006-7509-6|url=http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/klein/PdfPapers/KS_PublCh06.pdf|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In ancient times, redistribution operated as a [[palace economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Lukas|last=de Blois |author2=R.J. van der Spek |translator=Susan Mellor |title=An Introduction to the Ancient World|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|pages=56–60|isbn=0-415-12773-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These economies were centrally based around the administration, so the dictator or pharaoh had both the ability and the right to say who was taxed and who got special treatment.

Another early form of wealth redistribution occurred in [[Plymouth Colony]] under the leadership of [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]].&lt;ref name=commoncourse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/william-bradford|title=William Bradford – Facts &amp; Summary |publisher=History.com|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradford records in his diary that this "common course"&lt;ref name=commoncourse /&gt; bred confusion, discontent, distrust, and the colonists looked upon it as a form of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tYecOAN1cwwC&amp;pg=PA135 ''History of Plymouth Plantation''], p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term [[Distributism]] (also known as distributionism or distributivism) is an economic ideology that developed in Europe in the late 19th and early 20th century based upon the principles of [[Catholic social teaching]], especially the teachings of [[Pope Leo XIII]] in his encyclical ''Rerum novarum'' and [[Pope Pius XI]] in ''Quadragesimo anno''.  More recently, [[Pope Francis]] in his ''Evangelii Gaudium'', echoed the earlier Papal statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunt III|first1=Arthur W.|title=Pope Francis Needs Distributism: Americans and popes alike can embrace a humane alternative to modern capitalism.|url=http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/pope-francis-needs-distributism/|publisher=The American Conservative|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role in economic systems ==
Different types of [[economic system]]s feature varying degrees of interventionism aimed at redistributing income, depending on how unequal their initial distributions of income are. Free-market [[capitalist]] economies tend to feature high degrees of income redistribution. However, Japan's government engages in much less redistribution because its initial wage distribution is much more equal than Western economies. Likewise, the [[socialist]] planned economies of the former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc featured very little income redistribution because private [[Property income|capital and land income]] – the major drivers of income inequality in capitalist systems – was virtually nonexistent; and because the wage rates were set by the government in these economies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Rosser|first= Mariana V. and J Barkley Jr.|title= Comparative Economics in a Transforming World Economy|publisher= MIT Press|date=July 23, 2003|isbn= 978-0262182348|page = 11|quote=Economies vary based on the extent to which and the methods by which governments intervene to redistribute income. This depends partly on how unequal income is to begin with before any redistributive policies are implemented. Thus the Japanese government does much less redistributing than the governments of many other capitalist countries because Japan has a more equal distribution of wages than most other capitalist countries. Command socialist economies also have had less income redistribution because governments initially control the distribution of income by setting wages and forbidding capital or land income.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern forms of redistribution ==
Today, income redistribution occurs in some form in most [[Democracy|democratic]] countries through economic policies. Some redistributive policies attempt to take wealth, income, and other resources from the “haves” and give them to the “have-nots,” but many redistributions go elsewhere.

In his article ''Redistribution'',&lt;ref name="Redistribution"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Dwight R.|title=Redistribution|publisher=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwight R. Lee states:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 
“…most government transfers are not from the rich to the poor. Instead, government takes from the relatively unorganized (e.g., consumers and general taxpayers) and gives to the relatively organized (groups politically organized around common interests, such as the elderly, sugar farmers, and steel producers). The most important factor in determining the pattern of redistribution appears to be political influence, not poverty. “

“The direct transfer of cash and services is only one way that government transfers income. Another way is by restricting competition among producers. The inevitable consequence—indeed, the intended consequence—of these restrictions is to enrich organized groups of producers at the expense of consumers. Here, the transfers are more perverse than with Medicare and Social Security. They help relatively wealthy producers at the expense of relatively poor (and, in some cases, absolutely poor) consumers. Many government restrictions on agricultural production, for example, allow farmers to capture billions of consumer dollars through higher food prices (see [[agricultural subsidy]] programs). Most of these dollars go to relatively few large farms, whose owners are far wealthier than the average taxpayer and consumer (or the average farmer). Also, wealthy farmers receive most of the government’s direct agricultural subsidies."

|}

Some consider the U.S. government’s progressive-rate [[income tax]] policy as redistributive, because some of the tax revenue goes to social programs such as welfare and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, Christine, and Gerald C. Wright. ''Keeping the Republic: Power and Citizenship in American Politics.'' 7th ed.: CQ, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Progressive tax|progressive income tax]] system, a high income earner will pay a higher tax rate (a larger percentage of their income) than a low income earner; and therefore, will pay more total dollars per person.&lt;ref&gt;Prante, Gerald, and Scott A. Hodge. "The Distribution of Tax and Spending Policies in the United States." Tax Foundation. N.p., 13 Nov. 2013. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other taxation-based methods of redistributing income are the [[negative income tax]] for very low income earners and [[tax loopholes]] (tax avoidance) for the better-off.

Two other common types of governmental redistribution of income are [[subsidies]] and [[vouchers]] (such as [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]]). These [[transfer payment]] programs are funded through general taxation, but benefit the poor or influential special interest groups and corporations.&lt;ref name="Redistribution"/&gt; While the persons receiving transfers from such programs may prefer to be directly given cash, these programs may be more palatable to society than cash assistance, as they give society some measure of control over how the funds are spent.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey S. Rosen &amp; Ted Gayer, Public Finance pp. 271–72 (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the U.S. [[Social security|Social Security]] program redistributes income from the rich to the poor,  but the majority of those receiving Social Security earned their benefits through tax withholding from their paychecks or quarterly income statements, and most benefits are indexed to the actual earning levels of individual workers.  Only the highest- and lowest-income workers fall outside normal rates.  In addition, Social Security deductions are only taken from the first $200,000 in income, with nothing further taken from higher incomes over that amount. In other words, a person who earns $100 million a year pays the same Social Security tax as another worker who earns $200,000 a year.

Contrary to popular belief, a recent study&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balls|first1=Andrew|title=Social Security Does Not Redistribute Income|url=https://www.nber.org/digest/may00/w7520.html#navDiv=6|publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that, overall, the Social Security System was slightly regressive against the poor and not redistributive, once important factors were taken into account (for example, the longer life expectancy of the wealthy when compared to the poor gives them more years to collect benefits).

Governmental redistribution of income may include a direct benefit program involving either cash transfers or the purchase of specific services for an individual. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] is one example.&lt;ref&gt;Rector, Robert. "The Redistributive State: The Allocation of Government Benefits, Services, and Taxes in the United States." The Heritage Foundation. N.p., 15 Sept. 2015. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Medicare is a government-run health insurance program that covers people age 65 or older, certain younger people with disabilities, and people with [[end-stage renal disease]] (permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant, sometimes called ESRD). This is a direct benefit program because the government is directly providing health insurance for those who qualify.

The difference between the [[Gini index]] for the [[income distribution]] before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Wealth redistribution can be implemented through [[land reform]] that transfers ownership of land from one category of people to another, or through [[inheritance tax]]es or direct [[wealth tax]]es. Before-and-after Gini coefficients for the [[distribution of wealth]] can be compared.

==Objectives==
The objectives of income redistribution are to increase economic stability and opportunity for the less wealthy members of society and thus usually include the funding of [[public services]].

One basis for redistribution is the concept of [[distributive justice]], whose premise is that money and resources ought to be distributed in such a way as to lead to a [[socially just]], and possibly more financially [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]], society. Another argument is that a larger [[middle class]] benefits an economy by enabling more people to be [[consumer]]s, while providing equal opportunities for individuals to reach a better standard of living. Seen for example in the work of [[John Rawls]],{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} another argument is that a truly fair society would be organized in a manner benefiting the least advantaged, and any inequality would be permissible only to the extent that it benefits the least advantaged.

Some proponents of redistribution argue that [[capitalism]] results in an [[externality]] that creates unequal wealth distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. A. ,''Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy''. Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{who|date=December 2011}} argue that wealth and income inequality are a cause of [[economic crises]], and that reducing these inequalities is one way to prevent or ameliorate economic crises, with redistribution thus benefiting the economy overall. This view was associated with the [[underconsumptionism]] school in the 19th century, now considered an aspect of some schools of [[Keynesian economics]]; it has also been advanced, for different reasons, by [[Marxian economics]]. It was particularly advanced in the US in the 1920s by [[Waddill Catchings]] and [[William Trufant Foster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Dorfman|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allgoewer"&gt;{{cite web |last=Allgoewer|first=Elisabeth|date=May 2002|title= Underconsumption theories and Keynesian economics.

There is currently a great debate concerning the extent to which the world's extremely rich have become richer over recent decades. Thomas Piketty's ''[[Capital in the Twenty-First Century]]'' is at the forefront, critiqued in certain publications such as ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Forget the 1%; Free Exchange", ''The Economist'', 8 November 2014, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using statistics from 23 developed countries and the 50 states of the US, British researchers [[Richard G. Wilkinson]] and [[Kate Pickett]] show a correlation between income inequality and higher rates of health and social problems ([[obesity]], [[mental illness]], [[homicide]]s, [[teenage birth]]s, [[List of countries by incarceration rate|incarceration]], child conflict, drug use), and lower rates of social goods ([[List of countries by life expectancy|life expectancy]], educational performance, [[Trust (social sciences)|trust among strangers]], [[Women's rights#2011 study of status by country|women's status]], [[social mobility]], even numbers of [[patent]]s issued per capita), on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalitytrust.org.uk/resources/slides|title=The Spirit Level - The Equality Trust|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors argue inequality leads to the social ills through the psychosocial [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], [[Social status|status]] anxiety it creates.&lt;ref name=thinktanks&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/14/the-spirit-level-equality-thinktanks "The Spirit Level: how 'ideas wreckers' turned book into political punchbag"], Robert Booth, ''The Guardian'', 13 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 report by the [[International Monetary Fund]] by Andrew G. Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry found a strong association between lower levels of inequality and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries (such as Brazil, Cameroon, Jordan) with high inequality have "succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years" but "longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2011/sdn1108.pdf "Inequality and Unsustainable Growth: Two Sides of the Same Coin?"] Andrew G.

==Criticism==
[[Public choice]] theory states that redistribution tends to benefit those with political clout to set spending priorities more than those in need, who lack real influence on government.&lt;ref&gt;Plotnick, Robert (1986) "An Interest Group Model of Direct Income Redistribution", ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'', vol. 68, no. 4, pp. 594–602.&lt;/ref&gt;

The socialist economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] criticize redistribution via taxation in the context of [[Nordic model|Nordic-style]] [[social democracy]], highlighting its limited success at promoting relative egalitarianism and its lack of sustainability. They point out that social democracy requires a strong labor movement to sustain its heavy redistribution, and that it is unrealistic to expect such redistribution to be feasible in countries with weaker labor movements. They point out that, even in the Scandinavian countries, social democracy has been in decline since the labor movement weakened. Instead, Roemer and Bardhan argue that changing the patterns of enterprise ownership and [[market socialism]], obviating the need for redistribution, would be more sustainable and effective at promoting egalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;"Market socialism, a case for rejuvenation", by Pranab Bardhan and Johen E. Roemer. 1992. ''Journal of Economic Perspectives'', vol. 6, no. 3, p. 104: "Since it (social democracy) permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labor movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxian economics|Marxian economists]] argue that social democratic reforms – including policies to redistribute income – such as unemployment benefits and high taxes on profits and the wealthy create more contradictions in capitalism by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system via reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.&lt;ref name="Market Socialism 1998. P.60-61"&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. pp. 60–61: "The Marxist answers that...it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the [[reserve army of labour]], taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion)."&lt;/ref&gt; In the Marxist view, redistribution cannot resolve the fundamental issues of capitalism – only a transition to a socialist economy can.

'''Risk compensation'''  is a [[theory]] which suggests that people typically adjust their [[behavior]] in response to the perceived level of risk, becoming more careful where they sense greater risk and less careful if they feel more protected. Although usually small in comparison to the fundamental benefits of safety interventions, it may result in a lower net benefit than expected.&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Vrolix|2006}} "Behavioural adaptation generally does not eliminate the safety gains from programmes, but tends to reduce the size of the expected effects"&lt;/ref&gt;

By way of example, it has been observed that motorists drove faster when wearing [[seatbelt]]s and closer to the vehicle in front when the vehicles were fitted with [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]]. There is also evidence that the risk compensation phenomenon could explain the failure of condom distribution programs to reverse [[HIV]] prevalence and that condoms may foster disinhibition, with people engaging in risky sex both with and without [[condom]]s.

By contrast, [[shared space]] is a highway design method which consciously aims to ''increase'' the level of perceived risk and uncertainty, thereby slowing traffic and reducing the number of and seriousness of injuries.

==Overview==
Risk compensation is related to the broader term [[adaptive behavior|behavioral adaptation]] which includes all behavior changes in response to safety measures, whether compensatory or not. However, since researchers are primarily interested in the compensatory or negative adaptive behavior the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Vrolix|2006}} "A term, closely related to risk compensation, is ‘behavioural adaptation’. Behavioural adaptation is a wider term referring to all behavioural changes triggered by a safety measure (OECD, 1997). Strictly spoken, this includes all positive and negative behavioural changes induced by road safety measures. Nevertheless, the emphasis is primarily put on the negative aspects of this phenomenon."&lt;/ref&gt; The more recent version emerged from [[road safety]] research after it was claimed that many interventions failed to achieve the expected level of benefits but has since been investigated in many other fields.&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Vrolix|2006}} "Risk compensation is the term given to a theory which tries to understand the behaviour of people in potentially hazardous activities. In the context of the road user, risk compensation refers to the tendency of road users to compensate for changes in the road system that are perceived as improving safety by adapting behaviour (Elvik and Vaa,2004). So measures, designed to improve traffic safety, may bring along negative consequences in a way that individuals increase the riskiness of their driving behaviour because they feel safer (Dulisse, 1997)"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Hedlund|2000}} "The early risk compensation literature deals with road safety... Several recent studies examine risk compensation in response to both aggregate and specific consumer product and workplace safety regulations"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peltzman effect===
The reduction of predicted benefit from regulations that intend to increase safety is sometimes referred to as the '''Peltzman effect''' in recognition of [[Sam Peltzman]], a professor of economics at the [[University of Chicago Booth School of Business]], who published "The Effects of Automobile Safety Regulation" in the ''[[Journal of Political Economy]]'' in 1975 in which he controversially suggested that "offsets (due to risk compensation) are virtually complete, so that regulation has not decreased highway deaths".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=1830396|title=The Effects of Automobile Safety Regulation|first=Sam |last=Peltzman | volume=83|issue=4|pages=677–726|year=1975|doi=10.1086/260352|journal=Journal of Political Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peltzman claimed to originate this theory in the 1970s but it was used to oppose the requirement of safety equipment on trains in the Nineteenth Century {{harv|Adams|1879}}. A reanalysis of his original data found numerous errors and his model failed to predict fatality rates before regulation {{harv|Robertson|1977}}. According to Peltzman, regulation was at best useless, at worst counterproductive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11127-009-9548-2|title="Rubbin' is racin": evidence of the Peltzman effect from NASCAR|volume=142|issue=3–4 |journal=Public Choice|pages=507–513|quote="The Peltzman (1975) effect predicts that when automobile safety regulations are made mandatory, at least some of their benefits will be offset by changes in the behavior of drivers |year=2010 |last1=Pope |first1=Adam T.|last2=Tollison|first2=Robert D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Hedlund|2000}} "This conclusion startled the road safety community and challenged the role of government in attempting to improve safety through regulation. In Peltzman's view, government regulation was useless and perhaps even counterproductive."&lt;/ref&gt; Peltzman found that the level of risk compensation in response to highway safety regulations was ''complete'' in original study. But "Peltzman’s theory does not predict the magnitude of risk compensatory behaviour." Substantial further empirical work has found that the effect exists in many contexts but generally offsets less than half of the direct effect.{{sfn|Vrolix|2006}} In the U.S., motor vehicle fatalities per population declined by more than half from the beginning of regulation in the 1960s through 2012. Vehicle safety standards accounted for most of the reduction augmented by seat belt use laws, changes in the minimum drinking age, and reductions in teen driving {{harv|Robertson|2015}}.

The Peltzman effect can also result in a redistributing effect where the consequences of risky behaviour are increasingly felt by innocent parties (see [[moral hazard]]). By way of example, if a risk-tolerant driver responds to driver-safety interventions, such as compulsory [[seat belt]]s, [[crumple zone]]s, ABS etc. by driving faster with less attention, then this can result in increases in injuries and deaths to pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mautc.psu.edu/docs/WVU-2006-02.pdf|title=Safety Externalities of SUVs on Passenger Cars: An Analysis Of the Peltzman Effect Using FARS Data|author1=David R. Martinelli|author2=Maria-Paulina Diosdado-De-La-Pena|publisher=West Virginia University 2008|quote="In general, safety regulation did decrease the probability of death for drivers, but this is offset by involving themselves in a riskier behavior, which reassigns the change of deaths from vehicle occupants to pedestrians}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk homeostasis===&lt;!-- [[Risk homeostasis]] redirects to this section --&gt;
Risk homeostasis is a controversial [[hypothesis]], initially proposed in 1982 by Gerald J. S. Wilde, a professor at [[Queen's University]] in Canada, which suggests that people maximise their benefit by comparing the expected costs and benefits of safer and riskier behaviour and which introduced the idea of the ''target level of risk''.&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Wilde|1998}} "The level of risk at which the net benefit is expected to maximize is called the target level of risk in recognition of the realization that people do not try to minimize risk (which would be zero at zero mobility), but instead attempt to optimize it"&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed four constituents to a person's calculations relating to risk:&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Wilde|1998}} "Besides macroeconomic influences, there are other factors that influence the level of accepted risk; these are of a cultural, social, or psychological kind. In general, the amount of risk that people are willing (in fact, prefer) to take can be said to depend on four utility factors and will be greater to the extent that factors..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* Expected benefits of risky behavior (e.g., gaining time by speeding, fighting boredom, increasing mobility)
* Expected costs of risky behavior (e.g., speeding tickets, car repairs, insurance surcharges)
* Expected benefits of safe behavior (e.g., insurance discounts for accident-free periods, enhancement of reputation of responsibility)
* Expected costs of safe behavior (e.g., using an uncomfortable seat belt, being called a coward by one's peers, time loss)

Wilde noted that when Sweden [[dagen H|changed from]] [[Right- and left-hand traffic|driving on the left to driving on the right]] in 1967, this was followed by a marked reduction in the traffic fatality rate for 18 months after which the trend returned to its previous values. He suggested that drivers had responded to increased perceived danger by taking more care, only to revert to previous habits as they became accustomed to the new regime.&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Wilde|1998}} "In the fall of 1967 Sweden changed over from left hand to right hand traffic. This was followed by a marked reduction in the traffic fatality rate. About a year and a half later, the accident rate returned to the trend before the changeover."&lt;/ref&gt; A similar pattern was seen following [[H-dagurinn|Iceland's switch from left- to right-hand driving]].

In a [[Munich]] study, part of a fleet of [[taxicab]]s were equipped with [[antilock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] (ABS), while the remainder had conventional brake systems. In other respects, the two types of cars were identical. The crash rates, studied over three years, were a little higher for the cabs with ABS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Over a period of 36 months they observed part of a taxi fleet in Munich, Germany. Half of the observed vehicles were equipped with an anti-lock braking system (ABS)... The overall accident rate showed a slight increase for ABS taxis, but no significant differences between cars with the superior brake-system (ABS) versus cars without the system|title=The Psychology of Risk Taking Behavior|author=Trimpop|first=R.M. |isbn=0444899618|year=1994|page=219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rI4c24VTriEC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilde concluded that drivers of ABS-equipped cabs took more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them; non-ABS drivers were said to drive more carefully since they could not rely on ABS in a dangerous situation.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The idea of risk homeostasis is disputed. One author claimed that it received "little support",&lt;ref group=n&gt;{{harvtxt|Hedlund|2000}} "The extreme views of risk homeostasis have attracted little support"&lt;/ref&gt; another suggested that it "commands about as much credence as the flat earth hypothesis",&lt;ref group="n"&gt;{{harvtxt|O'Neill|Williams|1998}} "Risk homeostasis is not a theory. It is a hypothesis that repeatedly has been refuted by empirical studies. As Evans has noted, it commands about as much credence as the flat earth hypothesis"&lt;/ref&gt; a third noted that the proposal did create considerable media attention: "What set the debate alight, rather like petrol on flames, was the proposition in 1982 that road users did not just adapt to perceptions of changing risk through compensatory behaviors, but that the process was a homeostatic one, producing overall equilibrium in safety-related outcomes".&lt;ref group="n"&gt;{{harvtxt|Rudin-Brown |Jamson|2013|p=28}}, 'Early Theories of Behavioural Adaptations' by Oliver Carsten: "What set the debate alight, rather like petrol on flames, was the proposition in 1982 that road users did not just adapt to perceptions of changing risk through compensatory behaviors, but that the process was a homeostatic one, producing overall equilibrium in safety-related outcomes"&lt;/ref&gt; Others claimed that road fatality statistics, which have fallen considerably since the introduction of safety measures, do not support the theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote=risk homeostasis theory should be rejected because there is no convincing evidence supporting it and much evidence refuting it|title=Risk Homeostasis Theory and Traffic Accident Data |journal=Risk Analysis |volume=6|issue=1|pages=81–94|date=March 1986|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1986.tb00196.x |pmid=3602497 |last1=Evans |first1=Leonard }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author =  Andreassen |first=D.

==Examples==

===Road transport===

====Anti-lock brakes====
[[Anti-lock braking system]]s are designed to increase vehicle safety by reducing skidding.

A number of studies show that drivers of vehicles with ABS tend to drive faster, follow closer and brake later, accounting for the failure of ABS to result in any measurable improvement in road safety. The studies were performed in Canada, Denmark, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Grant and Smiley, "Driver response to antilock brakes: a demonstration on behavioural adaptation" from Proceedings, Canadian Multidisciplinary Road Safety Conference VIII, June 14–16, Saskatchewan 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0001-4575(96)00083-8 |title=An investigation of behavioural adaptation to airbags and antilock brakes among taxi drivers |journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention |volume=29|issue=3|pages=293–302|year=1997|last1=Sagberg|first1=Fridulv|last2=Fosser|first2=Stein|last3=Sætermo|first3=Inger-Anne F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aschenbrenner and Biehl, "Improved safety through improved technical measures? empirical studies regarding risk compensation processes in relation to anti-lock braking systems". In Trimpop and Wilde, Challenges to Accident Prevention: The issue of risk compensation behaviour (Groningen, NL, Styx Publications, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; A study led by Fred Mannering, a professor of [[civil engineering]] at the [[University of South Florida]] supports risk compensation, terming it the "offset hypothesis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Venere|first= Emil|year=2006|url=http://news.uns.purdue.edu/html4ever/2006/060927ManneringOffset.html|title=Study: Airbags, antilock brakes not likely to reduce accidents, injuries|work=Purdue University News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of crashes involving [[taxicab]]s in [[Munich]] of which half had been equipped with anti-lock brakes noted that crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and concluded this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psyc.queensu.ca/target/chapter07.html |title=Remedy by engineering? |publisher=Psyc.queensu.ca |year=1994 |first=Gerald J.

However, the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] released a study in 2010 that found motorcycles with ABS 37% less likely to be involved in a fatal crash than models without ABS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ultimatemotorcycling.com/2012/motorcycle-abs-skepticism-debunked | title = Motorcycle ABS: Skepticism Debunked | date = 2012-05-16 |accessdate=2012-08-18 | publisher = Ultimate Motorcycling}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study found that ABS reduced the risk of [[Multiple-vehicle collision|multiple vehicle crashes]] by 18 percent, but had increased the risk of [[Run-off-road collision|run-off-road crashes]] by 35 percent.&lt;ref name="monash.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monash.edu.au/miri/research/reports/other/racv-abs-braking-system-effectiveness.pdf |title=Effectiveness of ABS and Vehicle Stability Control Systems |format=PDF |date=April 2004 | publisher = Royal Automobile Club of Victoria |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bicycle helmets====
A Spanish study of traffic accidents between 1990 and 1999 found that cyclists wearing [[bicycle helmet]]s who were involved in accidents were less likely to have committed a traffic law violation than unhelmeted cyclists, and that helmeted cyclists were no more likely to have committed a speeding violation in association with the accident than unhelmeted cyclists. The authors concluded that "although the findings do not support the existence of a strong risk compensation mechanism among helmeted cyclists, this possibility cannot be ruled out".&lt;ref name=Lardelli-Claret-et-al2003&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/ip.9.2.128 |title=Risk compensation theory and voluntary helmet use by cyclists in Spain |year=2003 |last1=Lardelli-Claret |first1=P |journal=Injury Prevention |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=128–32 |pmid=12810738 |last2=De Dios Luna-Del-Castillo |first2=J |last3=Jiménez-Moleón |first3=JJ |last4=García-Martín |first4=M |last5=Bueno-Cavanillas |first5=A |last6=Gálvez-Vargas |first6=R |pmc=1730952|display-authors = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one experimental study, adults accustomed to wearing helmets cycled more slowly without a helmet, but no difference in helmeted and unhelmeted cycling speed was found for cyclists who do not usually wear helmets.&lt;ref name="Fyhri2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2011.01589.x |title=Risk Compensation and Bicycle Helmets |year=2011 |last1=Phillips |first1=Ross Owen |last2=Fyhri |first2=Aslak |last3=Sagberg |first3=Fridulv |journal=Risk Analysis |volume=31 |issue=8 |pages=1187–95 |pmid=21418079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motorists may also alter their behavior toward helmeted cyclists. One study by Walker in England found that 2,500 vehicles passed a helmeted cyclist with measurably less clearance (8.5&amp;nbsp;cm) than that given to the same cyclist unhelmeted (out of an average total passing distance of 1.2 to 1.3 metres).&lt;ref name="Walker2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.aap.2006.08.010 |title=Drivers overtaking bicyclists: Objective data on the effects of riding position, helmet use, vehicle type and apparent gender |year=2007 |last1=Walker |first1=Ian |journal=Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=417–25 |pmid=17064655}}&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of these differences has been re-analysed by Olivier.&lt;ref name=OlivierBell2013&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058777 |title=Effect Sizes for 2×2 Contingency Tables |year=2013 |editor1-last=Rapallo |editor1-first=Fabio |last1=Olivier |first1=Jake |last2=Bell |first2=Melanie L. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=e58777 |pmid=23505560 |pmc=3591379}}&lt;/ref&gt; See also slides 40-45 in for further analysis by Olivier of the data from the Walker study.&lt;ref name=OlivierStatSocNSW2012&gt;{{cite web |last=Olivier |first=Jake |title=Mandatory helmet legislation in New South Wales: A statistical perspective |url=http://www.statsoc.org.au/objectlibrary/1198?filename=Mandatory%20helmet%20legislation%20-%20Jake%20Olivier.pdf |publisher=Statistical Society of Australia (NSW branch) |accessdate=2013-04-04 |date=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Rodgers re-analysed data which supposedly showed helmets to be effective and found both data errors and methodological weaknesses. He concluded that in fact the data showed "bicycle-related fatalities are positively and significantly associated with increased helmet use" and mentioned risk compensation as one possible explanation of this association.&lt;ref name="Rodgers"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rodgers GB |year=1988 |title=Reducing Bicycle Accidents: A Re-evaluation of the Impacts of the CPSC Bicycle Standard and Helmet Use |journal=Journal of Products Liability |volume=11 |pages=307–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Seat belts====
A 1994 research study of people who both wore and habitually did not wear [[seatbelt]]s concluded that drivers were found to drive faster and less carefully when belted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=8198694|year=1994|author1=Janssen|first1=W|title=Seat-belt wearing and driving behavior: An instrumented-vehicle study|journal=Accident Analysis and Prevention|volume=26|issue=2|pages=249–61|doi=10.1016/0001-4575(94)90095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several important driving behaviors were observed on the road before and after the belt use law was enforced in Newfoundland, and in Nova Scotia during the same period without a law. Belt use increased from 16 percent to 77 percent in Newfoundland and remained virtually unchanged in Nova Scotia. Four driver behaviors (speed, stopping at intersections when the control light was amber, turning left in front of oncoming traffic, and gaps in following distance) were measured at various sites before and after the law. Changes in these behaviors in Newfoundland were similar to those in Nova Scotia, except that drivers in Newfoundland drove slower on expressways after the law, contrary to the risk compensation theory {{harv|Lund|Zador|1984}}.

In Britain in 1981 at a time when the government was considering the introduction of [[seat belt legislation]], [[John Adams (geographer)|John Adams]] of University College London, suggested that there was no convincing evidence of a correlation between the seat-belt legislation and reductions injuries and fatalities based on a comparison between states with and without seat belt laws. He also suggested that some injuries were displaced from car drivers to pedestrians and other road users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite techreport|last1=Adams|first1=John|url=http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jadams/PDFs/SAE%20seatbelts.pdf|title=The efficacy of seatbelt legislation: A comparative study of road accident fatality statistics from 18 countries|publisher=Dept. of Geography, [[University College, London]]|year=1981|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623162149/http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~jadams/PDFs/SAE%20seatbelts.pdf|archivedate=2006-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Isles Report" echoed these concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport|last1=Adams|first1=John|url=http://john-adams.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/isles%20report.pdf|title=Isles Report|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adams subsequently argued that the reduction in fatalities that followed the introduction of legislation could not be attributed with confidence to seat-belt use due to the simultaneous introduction of [[breath testing]] for driving under the influence of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=http://john-adams.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2006/failure%20of%20seatbelt%20legislation.pdf|title=Clumsy Solutions for a Complex World: Governance, Politics and Plural Perceptions|pages=132–154|doi=10.1057/9780230624887_6|chapter=The Failure of Seat Belt Legislation|year=2006|last1=Adams|first1=John|isbn=978-1-349-28058-2|editor1= Marco Verweij |editor2=Michael Thompson|series=Global Issues Series |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a 2007 study based on data from the [[Fatality Analysis Reporting System]] (FARS) of the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] concluded that between 1985 and 2002 there were "significant reductions in fatality rates for occupants and motorcyclists after the implementation of belt use laws", and that "seatbelt use rate is significantly related to lower fatality rates for the total, pedestrian, and all non-occupant models even when controlling for the presence of other state traffic safety policies and a variety of demographic factors".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Risk Compensation or Risk Reduction? Seatbelts, State Laws, and Traffic Fatalities|volume=88|issue=4|work=Social Science Quarterly|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Limited|year=2007|pages=913–936|doi= 10.1111/j.1540-6237.2007.00510.x|last1=Houston|first1=David J.|last2=Richardson|first2=Lilliard E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Swedish change to driving on the right====
In Sweden, following [[Dagen H|the change from driving on the left to driving on the right in 1967]] there was a drop in crashes and fatalities, which was linked to the increased apparent risk. The number of motor insurance claims went down by 40%, returning to normal over the next six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Risk and Freedom: Record of Road Safety Regulation|author=John Adams|publisher=Brefi Press|year=1985|isbn=9780948537059}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|quote=On the day of the change, only 150 minor accidents were reported. Traffic accidents over the next few months went down. ... By 1969, however, accidents were back at normal levels|title=Dagen H: The day Sweden switched sides of the road|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/dagen-h-the-day-sweden-switched-sides-of-the-road-photo/2012/02/17/gIQAOwFVKR_blog.html|first=Elizabeth|last=Flock|date=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fatality levels took two years to return to normal.&lt;ref&gt;"On September 4 there were 125 reported traffic accidents as opposed to 130-196 from the previous Mondays. No traffic fatalities were linked to the switch. In fact, fatalities dropped for two years, possibly because drivers were more vigilant after the switch." Sweden finally began driving on the right side of the road in 1967 ''The Examiner'' Sept 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="n"&gt;{{harvtxt|Rudin-Brown |Jamson|2013}} "An example of risk overestimation in the short run is offered by the experience in Sweden when that country changed from left- to right-hand driving in the fall of 1967.  This intervention led to a marked surge in perceived risk that exceeded the target level and thus was followed by a very cautious behavior that caused a major decrease in road fatalities.  ...the accident rate returned to 'normal' within 2 years."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shared space====
{{main|Shared space}}
[[Shared space]] is an approach to the design of roads, where risk compensation is consciously used to ''increase'' the level of uncertainty for drivers and other road users by removing traditional demarcations between [[vehicle]] [[traffic]] by removing [[kerb (road)|curbs]], [[road surface marking]]s, and [[traffic sign]]s. The approach has been found to result in lower vehicle speeds and fewer road casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1057/udi.2008.13|url=http://www.hamilton-baillie.co.uk/_files/_publications/30-1.pdf|title=Towards shared space|journal=Urban Design International|volume=13|issue=2|pages=130–138|year=2008|quote=A recognition of ‘risk compensation effect’ prompts a fresh understanding of the adverse effects of measures such as traffic signals, signs, pedestrian guard rails and barriers on safety, and of their tendency to discourage informal physical activity. It may seem perverse to argue that well being can be improved through making spaces feel riskier, but that is the firm conclusion from both research, and from empirical studies|last1=Hamilton-Baillie|first1=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Speed limits====
The control of traffic speeds using effectively enforced [[speed limit]]s and other traffic calming methods plays an important role in the reduction of road traffic casualties;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/publications/road_traffic/world_report/en/index.html |title=World Report on Road Traffic Injury Prevention |publisher=[[World Health Organization]], [[World Bank Group]]|year=2004|language=|accessdate=2010-04-13|isbn=9789241562607|quote=In high-income countries, an established set of interventions have contributed to significant reductions in the incidence and impact of road traffic injuries.

A 1994 study conducted to test the risk homeostasis theory, using a [[driving simulator]], found that increasing posted speed limits and a reduction of speeding fines had significantly increased driving speed but resulted in no change in the accident frequency. It also showed that increased accident cost caused large and significant reductions in accident frequency but no change in speed choice. The results suggest that regulation of specific risky behaviors such as speed choice may have little influence on accident rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

====Ski helmets====
Recent studies indicate that skiers wearing helmets go faster on average than non-helmeted skiers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote=The average speed for helmet users of 45.8 km/h (28.4 mph) was significantly higher than those not using a helmet at 41.0 km/h (25.4 mph)|title=How Fast Do Winter Sports Participants Travel on Alpine Slopes?|journal=Journal of ASTM International|volume=2|issue=7|pages=12092|year=2005|doi=10.1520/JAI12092|last1=Shealy|first1=JE|last2=Ettlinger|first2=CF|last3=Johnson|first3=RJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that overall risk index is higher in helmeted skiers than non-helmeted skiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|quote=The main findings of this study indicate that the overall Risk Index is higher in helmeted skiers than non-helmeted skiers.

'Booth's rule #2', often attributed to [[skydiving]] pioneer [[Bill Booth]], states, "the safer skydiving gear becomes, the more chances skydivers will take, in order to keep the fatality rate constant".&lt;ref name=BoothsRule&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zolli|first1=Andrew|last2=Healy|first2=Ann Marie|title=Resilience: Why Things Bounce Back|date=2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=9781451683806|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1jSdGYHbSQ0C&amp;pg=PA194|language=en|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johansson|first1=Franz|title=The Click Moment: Seizing Opportunity in an Unpredictable World|date=2012|publisher=Penguin UK|isbn=9780241963517|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wlqOZBB2E9UC|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though skydiving equipment has made huge leaps forward in terms of reliability, including the introduction of safety devices such as [[Automatic activation device|AADs]], the fatality rate has stayed roughly constant when adjusted for the increasing number of participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On risk: perception and direction|pages=364–365|quote=his finding is in alignment with risk compensation theory because it predicts that, essentially, skydivers will compensate for any new safety mechanism and consequently perform more dangerous types of jumping|doi=10.1016/j.cose.2004.05.003|volume=23|issue=5|journal=Computers|year=2004|last1=Stewart|first1=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skydivenet.com/fatalities/fatalities_history.html |title=US Skydiving Fatalities History |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211051448/http://www.skydivenet.com/fatalities/fatalities_history.html |archivedate=February 11, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can largely be attributed to an increase in the popularity of high performance canopies, which fly much faster than traditional parachutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parachutistonline.com/feature/lessons-to-be-learned|title=Lessons to be Learned - The 2012 Fatality Summary|quote=The biggest opportunity for improvement in safety remains the selection and operation of main parachutes.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A greater number of landing fatalities in recent years has been attributed to high speed maneuvers close to the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parachutistonline.com/feature/lessons-to-be-learned|title=Lessons to be Learned - The 2012 Fatality Summary|quote=It appears that most of the incidents happened under small (the average reported size was 107 square feet), highly loaded canopies.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Risky sexual behavior and HIV/AIDS====
Evidence on risk compensation associated with HIV prevention interventions is mixed. [[Harvard]] researcher [[Edward C.

While [[pre-exposure prophylaxis]] (PrEP) with anti-[[HIV]] drugs appears to be extremely successful in suppressing the spread of HIV infection, there is some evidence that the reduction in HIV risk has led to some people taking more sexual risks; specifically, reduced use of [[condom]]s in [[anal sex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holt|first=Martin|last2=Lea|first2=Toby|last3=Mao|first3=Limin|last4=Kolstee|first4=Johann|last5=Zablotska|first5=Iryna|last6=Duck|first6=Tim|last7=Allan|first7=Brent|last8=West|first8=Michael|last9=Lee|first9=Evelyn|date=June 2018|title=Community-level changes in condom use and uptake of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis by gay and bisexual men in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia: results of repeated behavioural surveillance in 2013–17|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352301818300729|journal=The Lancet HIV|doi=10.1016/s2352-3018(18)30072-9|issn=2352-3018}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising risks of spreading sexually transmitted diseases other than HIV.

A '''role''' (also '''rôle''' or '''social role''') is a set of connected [[behavior]]s, [[rights]], [[moral obligation|obligation]]s, beliefs, and norms as conceptualized by people in a social situation. It is an expected or free or continuously changing behaviour and may have a given individual [[social status]] or [[social position]]. It is vital to both [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist]] and [[interactionism|interactionist]] understandings of society.
Social role posits the following about social behaviour:
# The division of labour in society takes the form of the interaction among heterogeneous specialised [[Social position|positions]], we call roles.
# Social roles included appropriate and permitted forms of behaviour and actions that recur in a group, guided by social [[norm (sociology)|norms]], which are commonly known and hence determine the expectations for appropriate behaviour in these roles, which further explains the place of a person in the society.
# Roles are occupied by individuals, who are called [[Actor (UML)|actors]].
# When individuals approve of a social role (i.e., they consider the role [[legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] and [[constructive]]), they will incur costs to conform to role norms, and will also incur costs to [[Social control|punish those who violate]] role norms.
# Changed conditions can render a social role outdated or illegitimate, in which case social pressures are likely to lead to role change.
# The anticipation of [[Reinforcement|rewards]] and [[punishment]]s, as well as the satisfaction of behaving prosocially, account for why agents conform to role requirements.

The notion of the role is examined in the [[social sciences]], more specifically [[economics]], [[sociology]] and [[organisation theory]].

==Determinants and characteristics==
Roles may be [[achieved status|achieved]] or [[ascribed status|ascribed]] or they can be accidental in different situations. An ''achieved role'' is a position that a person assumes voluntarily which reflects personal skills, abilities, and effort. An ''ascribed role'' is a position assigned to individuals or groups without regard for merit but because of certain traits beyond their control, {{Harv|Stark|2007}}, and is usually forced upon a person.

Roles can be semi-permanent ("[[physician|doctor]]", "mother", "child"), or they can be transitory. A well-known example is the ''[[sick role]]'' as formulated by [[Talcott Parsons]] in the late 1940s. In the transitory "sick role", a person is exempted from their usual roles, but is expected to conform to transitory behavioural standards, such as following doctors' orders and trying to recover.

For many roles, individuals must meet certain conditions, biological or sociological. For instance, a boy cannot ordinarily take the biological role of mother. Other roles require training or experience. For instance, in many cultures doctors must be educated and certified before practising medicine.

Role development can be influenced by a number of additional factors, including [[social]], [[Genetics|genetic]] predisposition, [[cultural]] or [[situational]].
*Societal influence: The structure of society often forms individuals into certain roles based on the social situations they choose to experience. Parents enrolling their children in certain programs at a young age increases the chance that the child will follow that role.
*Genetic predisposition: People take on roles that come naturally to them. Those with athletic ability generally take on roles of athletes. Those with mental genius often take on roles devoted to education and knowledge. This does not mean that people must choose only one path, each individual can reprise multiple roles (i.e. Evelyn can be the point guard on the basketball team and the editor of her school newspaper).
*Cultural influence: Different cultures place different values on certain roles based on their lifestyle. For instance, [[Association football|soccer]] players are regarded higher in European countries than in the [[United States]], where soccer is less popular.
*Situational influence: Roles can be created or altered based on the situation a person is put in outside their own influence.

Roles are also frequently interconnected in a [[role set]], that complement of role-relationships in which persons are involved by virtue of occupying a particular social status {{Harv|Merton|1957}}. For example, a high school football player carries the roles of student, athlete, classmate, etc.

== Role theory ==
{{Main|Role theory}}
Role theory is the sociological study of role development, concerned with explaining what forces cause people to develop the expectations of their own and others' behaviours.&lt;ref name="Biddle"&gt;
{{cite journal
 | last=Biddle | first=B.J.
 | year=1986

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociologist Bruce Biddle (1986), the five major models of role theory include:&lt;ref name="Biddle"/&gt;
#Functional Role Theory, which examines role development as shared social norms for a given social position,
#Symbolic Interactionist Role Theory, which examines role development as the outcome of individual interpretation of responses to behaviour,
#Structural Role Theory, which emphasises the influence of society rather than the individual in roles and utilises mathematical models,
#Organizational Role Theory, which examines role development in organisations, and
#Cognitive Role Theory, which is summarised by Flynn and Lemay as "the relationship between expectations and behaviours"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Robert John | last = Flynn |author2=Raymond A. Lemay  | title = A Quarter-Century of Normalization and Social Role Valorization: Evolution and Impact | publisher = University of Ottawa Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-7766-0485-6 | page = 224 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=n14-2xhMz2cC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=%22Structural+Role+Theory%22+definition }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in functionalist and consensus theory===
The [[Functionalism (sociology)|functionalist]] approach to role theory, which is largely borrowed from [[anthropology]], sees a "role" as the set of expectations that [[society]] places on an individual. By unspoken consensus, certain behaviours are deemed "appropriate" and others "inappropriate". For example, an appropriate [[Physician|doctor]] dresses fairly conservatively, asks a series of personal questions about one's health, touches one in ways that would normally be forbidden, writes [[Medical prescription|prescriptions]], and shows more concern for the personal [[Quality of life|wellbeing]] of his or her clients than is expected of, say, an [[electrician]] or a [[shopkeeper]].

"Role" is what the doctor ''does'' (or, at least, is expected to do) while status is what the doctor  ''is; ''in other words, "status" is the position an actor occupies, while "role" is the expected behaviour attached to that position.  Roles are not limited to occupational status, of course, nor does the fact that one is cast in the role of "doctor" during working hours prevent one from taking on other roles at other times: husband/wife, friend, father/mother, and so on.

===Role in interactionist or social action theory===
In interactionist social theory, the concept of role is crucial. The interactionist definition of "role" pre-dates the functionalist one. A role, in this conception, is not fixed or prescribed but something that is constantly negotiated between individuals in a tentative, creative way. [[philosophy|Philosopher]] [[George Herbert Mead]] explored roles in his seminal 1934 work, ''Mind, self and society''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | last=Mead | first=George H.
 | author-link=George Herbert Mead
 | year=1934
 | title=Mind, Self, and Society
 | publisher=University of Chicago Press
 | location=Chicago
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mead's main interest was the way in which children learn how to become a part of society by imaginative ''role-taking'', observing and mimicking others. This is always done in an interactive way: it's not meaningful to think of a role for one person alone, only for that person as an individual who is both co-operating and competing with others. Adults behave similarly: taking roles from those that they see around them, adapting them in creative ways, and (by the process of social interaction) testing them and either confirming them or modifying them. This can be most easily seen in encounters where there is considerable [[ambiguity]], but is nevertheless something that is part of all social interactions: each individual actively tries to "define the situation" (understand their role within it); choose a role that is advantageous or appealing; play that role; and persuade others to support the role.

===Social norms theory===
[[Social norms approach|Social norms theory]] states that much of people's behaviour is influenced by their perception of how other members of their [[Ingroups and outgroups|social group]] behave. When individuals are in a state of [[deindividuation]], they see themselves only in terms of group identity, and their behaviour is likely to be guided by group norms alone.
But while group norms have a powerful effect on behaviour, they can only guide behaviour when they are activated by obvious reminders or by subtle cues. People adhere to social norms through enforcement, internalisation, the sharing of norms by other group members, and frequent activation {{Harv|Smith|2007}}. Norms can be enforced through punishment or reward. Individuals are rewarded for living up to their roles (i.e. students getting an "A" on their exam) or punished for not completing the duties of their role (i.e. a salesman is fired for not selling enough product).

Social norm theory has been applied as an environmental approach, with an aim of influencing individuals by manipulating their [[Social environment|social and cultural environments]]. It has been widely applied using [[social marketing]] techniques. Normative messages are designed for delivery using various media and promotional strategies in order to effectively reach a target population. Social norms theory has also been successfully applied through strategies such as curriculum infusion, creating press coverage, policy development, and small group inventions.(Main Frame 2002)

====The theory of planned behaviour====
People display [[reactance (psychology)|reactance]] by fighting against threats to their freedom of action when they find norms inappropriate. [[Propositional attitude|Attitudes]] and norms typically work together to influence behaviour (directly or indirectly). The [[theory of planned behaviour]] intentions are a function of three factors: attitudes about the behaviour, social norms relevant to the behaviour, and perceptions of control over the behaviour. When attitudes and norms disagree, their influence on behaviour will depend on their relative accessibility.

====Team role theory====
As described in ''Working in Groups'' by Engleberg and Wynn, team role theory is when "members assume roles that are compatible with their personal characteristics and skills". [[Meredith Belbin]], a psychologist, first explored the concept of team-role theory in the 1970s when he and his research team went about observing teams and wanted to find out what made teams work and what did not. According to Belbin and his research team "the research revealed that the difference between success and failure for a team was not dependent on factors such as intellect, but more on behavior" (Belbin). They began to identify separate clusters of behaviors and found that behavior was more influential on a team than anything else. These separate clusters of behaviors are known as the "Team Roles".  The nine "team roles" are as follows: coordinator/chairperson, shaper, innovator, resource investigator, monitor/evaluator, implementer, teamworker, completer/finisher, and specialist.

== Role conflict and role confusion ==
{{See also|Role conflict}}

There are situations where the prescribed sets of behaviour that characterise roles may lead to [[cognitive dissonance]] in individuals. Role conflict is a special form of [[social conflict]] that takes place when one is forced to take on two different and incompatible roles at the same time. For example, a person may find conflict between her role as a mother and her role as an employee of a company when her child's demands for time and attention distract her from the needs of her employer.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, Leslie and Cynthia Thompson. (2003-05-12) [http://wfnetwork.bc.edu/encyclopedia_entry.php?id=264 Work-Family role conflict] ''Encyclopedia.'' Sloan Family Work and Research Network, Boston College. Retrieved 2008-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, role confusion occurs in a situation where an individual has trouble determining which role he or she should play, but where the roles are not necessarily incompatible. For example, if a college student attending a social function encounters his teacher as a fellow guest, he will have to determine whether to relate to the teacher as a student or a peer.

== Role enhancement ==
Role enhancement or ''role enrichment'' refers to a situation in which roles which are held by a person are compatible and moreover enacting one role has beneficial [[spillover effect]]s on the enactment of the other role. An example which has been studied in depth is the enhancement among roles of ''breadwinner'' and ''caretaker'' ([[work–family enrichment]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey H. Greenhaus, Gary N. Powell, [http://aomarticles.metapress.com/content/959878ur98n7aap6/ ''When Work and Family are Allies: A Theory of Work-Family Enrichment''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120726090616/http://aomarticles.metapress.com/content/959878ur98n7aap6/ |date=2012-07-26 }}, The Academy of Management Review, Vol. 31, No. 1, January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence indicates that role conflict and role enhancement can occur simultaneously,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Beth Tiedje | first1 = Linda | last2 = Wortman | first2 = Camille B. | last3 = Downey | first3 = Geraldine | last4 = Emmons | first4 = Carol | last5 = Biernat | first5 = Monica | last6 = Lang | first6 = Eric | year = 1990 | title = Women with Multiple Roles: Role-Compatibility Perceptions, Satisfaction, and Mental Health | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 63| jstor=352838 | doi=10.2307/352838}}&lt;/ref&gt; and further evidence suggests that [[mental health]] correlates with low role conflict and high role enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grzywacz | first1 = Joseph G. | last2 = Bass | first2 = Brenda L. | year = 2003 | title = Work, Family, and Mental Health: Testing Different Models of Work–Family Fit | url = http://midus.wisc.edu/findings/pdfs/155.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Marriage and Family | volume = 65 | issue = 1| pages = 248–261 | doi=10.1111/j.1741-3737.2003.00248.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wfnetwork.bc.edu/encyclopedia_entry.php?id=264 ''Work-Family Role Conflict''], 2003, [[Alfred P. Sloan Foundation|Sloan Work and Family Research Network]] Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; Also certain [[personality trait]]s, in particular traits linked to perceiving and seeking greater levels of support, are associated with lower inter-role conflict and increase inter-role enrichment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friede Westring | first1 = Alyssa | last2 = Marie Ryan | first2 = Ann | year = 2010 | title = Personality and inter-role conflict and enrichment: Investigating the mediating role of support | url = http://hum.sagepub.com/content/63/12/1815.short | journal = Human Relations | volume = 63 | issue = 12| pages = 1815–1834 | doi = 10.1177/0018726710371236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documenting roles ==
In business, documenting roles on [[process model]]s, such as [[Business Process Model and Notation|BPMN diagrams]] as [[swim lane]]s, is becoming common practice in large companies (50% of European and North American companies reported a "significant" or "strategic" commitment&lt;ref&gt;Harmon, Paul and Wolf, Celia [http://www.bptrends.com/members_surveys/deliver.cfm?report_id=1003&amp;target=BPTrends%202008%20Survey%20Report%202-11-08%20Final,%20V_2_.pdf&amp;return=surveys_landing.cfm ''The State of Business Process Management: 2008''], Business Process Trends, February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;). This documentation helps organisations undertaking change projects to formally define the current or envisioned (future) roles expected to be responsible for a business process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1949">The '''SAGA System''' is a [[role-playing game]] system that uses "fate cards" to determine the effects of actions. The cards have numbers, suits, positive and negative states, and role-playing cues that guide the [[gamemaster]] in telling the story and administering the game. The system has been used in [[TSR, Inc.]]'s ''[[Dragonlance: Fifth Age]]'' game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | author=Staff | journal=[[Shadis]]
 | title=Review: Dragonlance: The Fifth Age
 |date=May 1996 | issue=27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''[[Marvel Super Heroes Adventure Game]]'', later published by TSR. [[Sue Weinlein Cook|Sue Cook]] was the brand manager for both of those game systems, and helped design the SAGA game rules.&lt;ref name="Dragon #259"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Kenson| first = Stephen| authorlink = Steve Kenson| title = Profiles: Sue Cook| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #259| page = 112| publisher = [[Wizards of the Coast]]| location = [[Renton, Washington]]|date=May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In SAGA, a player holds a hand of fate cards that represent his health and the range of actions he can take. The maximum number of cards he can hold is determined by the number of quests he has completed. This replaces the [[experience points]] system of many other role-playing games. The cards replace dice-rolling, as well. When a player attempts an action, he plays a card from his hand. If the suit on the card matches the action type (swords for strength-related actions, for example) it is considered "Trump." Playing a trump card means that the player can draw another card from the top of the Fate Deck and add the number on it to his total for attempting the action. When a character takes damage, the player must discard the number of points of damage to be taken from his hand. When a player has no more cards in his hand, the character is unconscious.

[[File:William Holman Hunt - The Scapegoat.jpg|thumb|''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'', by [[William Holman Hunt]], 1854]]

In the [[Bible]], a '''scapegoat''' is an animal which is ritually burdened with the sins of others, then driven away. The concept first appears in [[Book of Leviticus|Leviticus]], in which a goat is designated to be cast into the desert to carry away the sins of the community. 

{{Quote|And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats: one lot for the {{Lord}}, and the other lot for Azazel.||Leviticus 16:8, Jewish Publication Society (1917)}}

Practices with some similarities to the scapegoat ritual also appears in ancient Greece and [[Ebla]].

==Etymology==
{{main|Azazel}}

The word 'scapegoat' is an English translation of the Hebrew ''‘ăzāzêl'' (Hebrew: עזאזל) which occurs in [[Leviticus]] 16:8. The lexicographer [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]&lt;ref&gt;Gesenius "I have no doubt that it should be rendered 'averter'"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brown–Driver–Briggs]] Hebrew Lexicon&lt;ref&gt;p736&lt;/ref&gt; give ''la-azazel'' (Hebrew: לעזאזל) as a [[reduplicative]] intensive of the stem ''‘-Z-L'' "remove", hence ''la-‘ăzāzêl,'' "for entire removal". This reading is supported by the [[Septuagint|Greek Old Testament]] translation as "the sender away (of sins)".

Alternatively, broadly contemporary with the Septuagint, the pseudepigraphical [[Book of Enoch]] may preserve Azazel as the name of a [[fallen angel]].&lt;ref&gt;Archie T.

Early English [[Christian Bible]] versions follow the translation of the [[Septuagint]] and Latin [[Vulgate]] which interpret ''azazel'' as "the goat that departs" (Greek ''tragos apopompaios'', "goat sent out", Latin ''caper emissarius'', "emissary goat"). [[William Tyndale]] rendered the Latin as "(e)scape goat" in his [[Tyndale Bible|1530 Bible]]. This translation was followed by following versions up to the [[King James Version]] of the Bible in 1611: "And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the Lord, and the other lot for the scapegoat."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrcZEZ1bOJsC&amp;pg=PA412|year=1991|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|isbn=978-0-87779-603-9|pages=411–412}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several modern versions however either follow the reading as a demon, Azazel, or footnote "for Azazel." as an alternative reading.

Jewish sources in the [[Talmud]] (Yoma 6:4,67b) give the etymology of ''azazel'' as a compound of ''az'', strong or rough, and ''el'', mighty, that the goat was sent from the most rugged or strongest of mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=2203&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Azazel#6890 |title=AZAZEL |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the [[Targums]] onwards the term ''azazel'' was also seen by some rabbinical commentators as the name of a Hebrew demon, angelic force, or pagan deity.&lt;ref&gt;The JPS guide to Jewish traditions - Page 224 Ronald L. Eisenberg, Jewish Publication Society - 2004 "(Leviticus 16:8–10). In talmudic times, a popular rabbinic interpretation was that Azazel referred to the place to which the goat was sent, the eretz g'zera (inaccessible region) of Leviticus (16:22). Later, Azazel became associated with another..."&lt;/ref&gt; The two readings are still disputed today.&lt;ref&gt;The JPS Torah Commentary: Leviticus Nahum M. Sarna, Chaim Potok, Jewish Publication Society - 1989 " According to the first, Azazel is the name of the place in the wilderness to which the scapegoat was dispatched; ... According to the second line of interpretation, Azazel describes the goat. The word ' aza''zel is a contraction&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Judaism==
{{main|Azazel}}
The scapegoat was a [[goat]] that was designated (Hebrew לַעֲזָאזֵֽל ) ''la-aza'zeyl''; "[[Azazel|for absolute removal]]" (for symbolic removal of the people's sins with the literal removal of the goat), and outcast in the desert as part of the ceremonies of the [[Day of Atonement]], that began during the Exodus with the original Tabernacle and continued through the times of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temples in Jerusalem]].

Once a year, on [[Yom Kippur]], the [[Cohen Gadol]] sacrificed a bull as a [[sin offering]] to [[Atonement in Judaism|atone]] for sins he may have committed unintentionally throughout the year. Subsequently he took two goats and presented them at the door of the tabernacle. Two goats were chosen by [[cleromancy|lot]]: one to be "for [[YHWH]]", which was offered as a blood sacrifice, and the other to be the scapegoat to be sent away into the wilderness. The blood of the slain goat was taken into the Holy of Holies behind the sacred veil and sprinkled on the mercy seat, the lid of the ark of the covenant. Later in the ceremonies of the day, the High Priest [[confession in Judaism|confessed]] the intentional sins of the Israelites to God placing them figuratively on the head of the other goat, the Azazel scapegoat, who would symbolically "take them away".

== Christian perspectives ==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Agnus-Dei The Scapegoat (Agnus-Dei. Le bouc émissaire.) - James Tissot.jpg|thumb|''Agnus-Dei: The Scapegoat'' (''Agnus-Dei. Le bouc émissaire.''), by [[James Tissot]]]]
In Christianity this process prefigures the sacrifice of [[Christ]] on the cross through which God has been propitiated and sins can be expiated. Jesus Christ is seen to have fulfilled all of the biblical "types"—the High Priest who officiates at the ceremony, the Lord's goat that deals with the pollution of sin and the scapegoat that removes the "burden of sin". Christians believe that sinners who own their guilt and confess their [[sins]], exercising faith and trust in the person and sacrifice of [[Jesus]], are forgiven of their sins. 

Since the second goat was sent away to perish,&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Golden Bough]]'' p. 569 Sir [[James Frazer]], Worsworth Reference {{ISBN|1-85326-310-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the word "scapegoat" has developed to indicate a person who is blamed and punished for the sins of others.

== Similar practices==

===Ancient Syria===
A concept superficially similar to the biblical scapegoat is attested in two ritual texts in archives at [[Ebla]] of the 24th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zatelli |first=Ida |date=April 1998 |title=The Origin of the Biblical Scapegoat Ritual: The Evidence of Two Eblaite Text |journal=[[Vetus Testamentum]] |volume=48 |issue=2 |page= |pages=254–263 |ref=href |doi=10.1163/1568533982721604}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were connected with ritual purification on the occasion of the king's wedding. In them, a she-goat with a silver bracelet hung from her neck was driven forth into the wasteland of "Alini"; "we" in the report of the ritual involves the whole community. Such "elimination rites", in which an animal, without confession of sins, is the vehicle of evils (not sins) that are chased from the community are widely attested in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;David P. Wright, ''The Disposal of the Impurity: Elimination Rites in the Bible and in Hittite and Mesopotamian Literature'' (Atlanta: Scholars Press) 1987:15-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient Greece===
Ancient Greeks practiced scapegoating rituals in exceptional times based on the belief that the repudiation of one or two individuals would save the whole community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bremmer|first=Jan|date=1983|title=Scapegoat Rituals in Ancient Greece|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/311262|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=87|pages=299–320|doi=10.2307/311262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westbrook|first=Raymond|date=|title=Who Led the Scapegoat in Leviticus 16:21?|url=|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scapegoating was practiced with different rituals across ancient Greece for different reasons but was mainly used during extraordinary circumstances such as famine, drought or plague.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The scapegoat would usually be an individual of lower society such as a criminal, slave or poor person and was referred to as the [[pharmakos|''pharmakos'']], ''katharma'' or ''peripsima''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There is a dichotomy, however, in the individuals used as scapegoats in mythical tales and the ones used in the actual rituals. In mythical tales it was stressed that someone of high importance had to be sacrificed if the whole society would benefit from the aversion of catastrophe (usually a king or the king's children).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, since no king or person of importance would be willing to sacrifice himself or his children, the scapegoat in actual rituals would be someone of lower society who would be given value through special treatment such as fine clothes and dining before the sacrificial ceremony.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Sacrificial ceremonies varied across Greece depending on the festival and type of catastrophe. In [[Abdera, Thrace|Abdera]], for example, a poor man was feasted and led around the walls of the city once before being chased out with stones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Massilia a poor man was feasted for a year and then cast out of the city in order to stop a plague.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The scholia refer to the ''pharmakos'' being killed, but many scholars reject this, and argue that the earliest evidence (the fragments of the [[Iambic poetry|iambic satirist]] [[Hipponax]]) only show the ''pharmakos'' being stoned, beaten and driven from the community.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25916">A '''sensory cue''' is a statistic or signal that can be extracted from the sensory input by a perceiver, that indicates the state of some property of the world that the perceiver is interested in perceiving.

A cue is some organization of the data present in the signal which allows for meaningful extrapolation. For example, [[Senses|sensory]] cues include visual cues, auditory cues, haptic cues, olfactory cues and environmental cues. Sensory cues are a fundamental part of theories of perception, especially theories of appearance (how things look).

== Concept ==
There are two primary theory sets used to describe the roles of sensory cues in perception. One set of theories are based on the Constructivist theory of perception, while the others are based on the Ecological theory.

Basing his views on the Constructivist theory of perception, [[Helmholtz]] (1821-1894) held that the visual system constructs visual percepts through a process of ''[[unconscious inference]]'', in which cues are used to make probabilistic inferences about the state of the world. These inferences are based on prior experience, assuming that the most commonly correct interpretation of a cue will continue to hold true.&lt;ref name="Perception of Space 1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=edited by William Epstein, Sheena|title=Perception of space and motion|year=1995|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0080538614|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A visual [[Perception#Process and terminology|percept]] is the final manifestation of this process. [[Egon Brunswik|Brunswik]] (1903-1955) later went on to formalize these concepts with the ''lens model'', which breaks the system's use of a cue into two parts: the [[ecological validity (perception)|ecological validity]] of the cue, which is its likelihood of correlating with a property of the world, and the system's ''utilization'' of the cue.&lt;ref name="Perception of Space 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=edited by William Epstein, Sheena|title=Perception of space and motion|year=1995|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0080538614|pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these theories, accurate perception requires both the existence of cues with sufficiently high ecological validity to make inference possible, and that the system actually utilizes these cues in an appropriate fashion during the construction of percepts.

A second set of theories was posited by [[James J. Gibson|Gibson]] (1904-1979), based on the Ecological theory of perception. These theories held that no inferences are necessary to accomplish accurate perception. Rather, the visual system is able to take in sufficient cues related to objects and their surroundings. This means that a one:one mapping between the incoming cues and the environment they represent can be made. These mappings will be shaped by certain computational constraints; traits known to be common in an organism's environment.&lt;ref name="Perception of Space 3"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=edited by William Epstein, Sheena|title=Perception of space and motion|year=1995|publisher=Academic Press|location=San Diego|isbn=0080538614|pages=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate result is the same: a visual precept is manifested by the process.

''Cue combination'' is an active area of research in [[perception]], that seeks to understand how information from multiple sources is combined by the brain to create a single perceptual experience or response.  Recent [[cue recruitment]] experiments have shown that the adult human visual system can learn to utilize new cues through [[classical conditioning|classical (Pavlovian) conditioning]].

== Visual cues ==

Visual cues are sensory cues received by the [[eye]] in the form of light and processed by the [[visual system]] during [[visual perception]]. Since the visual system is dominant in many species, especially humans, visual cues are a large source of information in how the world is [[Perception|perceived]].&lt;ref name="VisualDominance"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Posner|first=Michael I.|author2=Nissen, Mary J. |author3=Klein, Raymond M. |title=Visual dominance: An information-processing account of its origins and significance.|journal=Psychological Review|date=March 1976|volume=83|issue=2|pages=157–171|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.83.2.157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types of cues ===

==== Depth ====
{{Main|Depth perception}}
The ability to perceive the world in three dimensions and estimate the size and distance to an object depends heavily on depth cues. The two major depth cues, [[Stereopsis]] and motion parallax, both rely on [[parallax]] which is the difference between the perceived position of an object given two different viewpoints. In stereopsis the distance between the eyes is the source of the two different viewpoints, resulting in a [[Binocular disparity]]. Motion parallax relies head and body movement to produce the necessary viewpoints.&lt;ref name="Binocular Vision"&gt;{{Cite book | last=Steinman | first=Scott B. | last2=Garzia | first2=Ralph Philip | year=2000 | title=Foundations of Binocular Vision: A Clinical perspective |  publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional | isbn=0-8385-2670-5 | pages=2&amp;ndash;5 | ref=harv | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Motion ====
{{Main|Motion perception}}
The visual system can detect motion both using a simple mechanism based on information from multiple clusters of neurons as well as by aggregate through by integrating multiple cues including contrast, form, and texture. One major source of visual information when determining self-motion is [[optic flow]]. Optic flow not only indicates whether an agent is moving but in which direction and at what relative speed.

===== Biological motion =====
{{Main|Biological motion}}
Humans in particular have evolved a particularly keen ability to detect if motion is being generated by biological source, even with '''point light displays''' where dots representing the joints of an animal.&lt;ref name="Biological Motion"&gt;{{cite journal| author=G. Johansson | title=Visual perception of biological motion and a model for its analysis | journal=Percept. Psychophys. | volume=14 | year=1973 | pages=201–211| doi=10.3758/BF03212378| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research suggests that this mechanism can also reveal the gender, emotional state, and action of a given human light point model.&lt;ref name="Point Light Displays"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alaerts|first=Kaat|author2=Nackaerts, Evelien |author3=Meyns, Pieter |author4=Swinnen, Stephan P. |author5=Wenderoth, Nicole |author6= Valdes-Sosa, Mitchell |title=Action and Emotion Recognition from Point Light Displays: An Investigation of Gender Differences|journal=PLoS ONE|date=June 9, 2011|volume=6|issue=6|pages=e20989|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0020989 |pmid=21695266 |pmc=3111458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Color ====
{{Main|Color vision}}
The ability to distinguish between colors allows an organism quickly and easily recognize danger since [[Aposematism|many brightly colored plants and animals pose some kind of threat]], usually harboring some kind of toxin. Color also serves as an inferential cue that can [[Priming (psychology)|prime]] both motor action&lt;ref name="Schmidt13"&gt;Schmidt, T.: ''The finger in flight: Real-time motor control by visually masked color stimuli.''

===== Contrast =====
{{Main|Contrast (vision)}}
Contrast, or the difference in luminance and/or color that helps make an object distinguishable, is important in [[edge detection]] and serves as a cue.

== Auditory Cues ==
An auditory cue is a sound signal that represents an incoming sign received through the ears, causing the brain to hear. The results of receiving and processing these cues are collectively known as the sense of [[hearing (sense)|hearing]],  and are the subject of research within the fields of [[psychology]], [[Cognitive Science|cognitive science]], and [[neurobiology]].

=== Auditory system ===
{{Main|Hearing}}
The auditory system of humans and animals allows individuals to assimilate information from the surroundings, represented as sound waves. Sound waves first pass through the [[pinnae]] and the auditory canal, the parts of the ear that comprise the outer ear.  Sound then reaches the tympanic membrane in the [[Middle Ear|middle ear]] (also known as the eardrum). The tympanic membrane sets the [[malleus]], [[incus]], and [[stapes]] into vibration. The stapes transmits these vibrations to the [[inner ear]] by pushing on the membrane covering the [[oval window]], which separates the middle and inner ear. The inner ear contains the [[cochlea]], the liquid-filled structure containing the hair cells. These cells serve to transform the incoming vibration to electrical signals, which can then be transmitted to the brain.
The auditory nerve carries the signal generated by the hair cells away from the inner ear and towards the auditory receiving area in the cortex. The signal then travels through fibers to several subcortical structures and then to the primary [[Primary auditory cortex|auditory receiving area]] in the temporal lobe

=== Cues for sound locating ===
Humans use several cues to determine the location of a given stimuli, mainly by using the timing difference between ears. These cues allow individuals to identify both the elevation, the height of the stimuli relative to the individual, and [[azimuth]], the angle of the sound relative to the direction the individual is facing.

==== Interaural time and level difference ====
Unless a sound is directly in front of or behind the individual, the sound stimuli will have a slightly different distance to travel to reach each ear. This difference in distance causes a slight delay in the time the signal is perceived by each ear. The magnitude of the interaural time difference is greater the more the signal comes from the side of the head. Thus, this time delay allows humans to accurately predict the location of incoming sound cues. Interaural level difference is caused by the difference in sound pressure level reaching the two ears. This is because the head blocks the sound waves for the further ear, causing less intense sound to reach it. This level difference between the two ears allows humans to accurately predict azimuth of an auditory signal. This effect only occurs at sounds that are high frequency.

==== Spectral cue ====
A spectral cue is a monaural (single ear) cue for locating incoming sounds based on the distribution of the incoming signal. The differences in distribution (or spectrum) of the sound waves are caused by  interactions of the sounds with the head and the outer ear before entering the ear canal.

=== Principles of auditory cue grouping ===
The auditory system uses several [[Heuristics#Psychology|heuristics]] to make sense of incoming cues, based on the properties of auditory stimuli that usually occur in the environment. Cue grouping refers to how humans naturally perceive incoming stimuli as organized patterns, based on certain rules.

==== Onset time ====
If two sounds start at different times, they are likely to have originated from different sources. Sounds that originate simultaneously likely come from the same source.

==== Location ====
Cues originating at the same or slowly changing positions usually have the same source. When two sounds are separated in space, the cue of location (see: [[sound localization]]) helps an individual to separate them perceptually. If a sound is moving, it will move continuously. Erratically jumping sound is unlikely to come from the same source.

==== Similarity of timbre ====
[[Timbre]] is the tone quality or tone character of a sound, independent of pitch. This helps us distinguish between musical instruments playing the same notes. When hearing multiple sounds, the timbre of each sound will be unchanging (regardless of pitch), and thus we can differentiate between sounds from different sources over time.&lt;ref name="Audio Order"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bregman|first=Albert|title=Primary Auditory Stream Segregation and Perception of Order in Rapid Sequences of Tones|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|year=1971|volume=89|issue=2|pages=244–249|doi=10.1037/h0031163|pmid=5567132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Similarity of pitch ====
[[Pitch (music)|Pitch]] refers to the frequency of the sound wave reaching us. Although a single object could produce a variety of pitches over time, it is more likely that it would produce sounds in a similar range. Erratic changes in pitch are more likely to be perceived as originating from different sources.

==== Auditory continuity ====
Similar to the Gestalt principle of good continuation (see: [[principles of grouping]]), sounds that change smoothly or remain constant are often produced by the same source. Sound with the same frequency, even when interrupted by other noise, is perceived as continuous. Highly variable sound that is interrupted is perceived as separate.&lt;ref name="Auditory induction"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warren|first=R. M.|author2=Obusek, C. J. |author3=Ackroff, J. M. |title=Auditory Induction: Perceptual Synthesis of Absent Sounds|journal=Science|date=9 June 1972|volume=176|issue=4039|pages=1149–1151|doi=10.1126/science.176.4039.1149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factors affecting auditory cue perception ===

==== The precedence effect ====
When one sound is presented for a long interval before the introduction of a second one originating from a different location, individuals will hear them as two distinct sounds, each originating from the correct location. However, when the delay between the onset of the first and second sound is shortened, listeners are unable to distinguish between the two sounds. Instead, they perceive them as both coming from the location of the lead sound. This effect counteracts the small disparity between the perception of sound caused by the difference in distance between each ear and the source of the auditory stimuli.

==== The interaction between auditory and visual cues ====
There are strong interactions between visual and auditory stimuli. Since both auditory and [[visual cues]] provide an accurate source of information about the location of an object, most times there will be minimal discrepancy between the two. However, it is possible to have a disparity in the information provided by the two sets of cues.
Visual capture, also known as the ventriloquism effect, occurs when an individual's visual system locates the source of an auditory stimulus at a different position than where the auditory system locates it. When this occurs, the visual cues will override the auditory ones. The individual will perceive the sound as coming from the location where the object is seen.
Audition can also affect visual perception. Research has demonstrated this effect by showing two objects on a screen, one moving diagonally from top-right to bottom-left and the other from top-left to bottom-right, intersecting in the middle. The paths of these identical objects could have been interpreted as crossing over each other, or as bouncing off each other.  Without any auditory cue, a vast majority of subjects saw the objects crossing paths and continuing in their original trajectory. But with the addition of a small "click" sound, a majority of subjects perceived the objects as bouncing off each other. In this case, auditory cues help interpret visual cues.&lt;ref name="Sound and Vision"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sekuler|first=Robert|author2=Sekuler, Allison B. |author3=Lau, Renee |title=Sound alters visual motion perception|journal=Nature|volume=385|issue=6614|pages=308–308|doi=10.1038/385308a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Haptic cues ==
A haptic cue is either a tactile sensation that represents an incoming signal received by the somatic system, or a relationship between tactile sensations which can be used to infer a higher level of information.&lt;ref name="Sensation_Perception" /&gt;   The results of receiving and processing these cues are collectively known as the sense of [[Somatosensory system|touch]], and are the subject of research in the fields of [[psychology]], [[Cognitive Science|cognitive science]], and [[neurobiology]].

The word "haptic" can refer explicitly to [[Haptic perception|active exploration]] of an environment (particularly in experimental psychology and physiology), but is often used to refer to the whole of the somesthetic experience.&lt;ref name="Touch Importance"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robles-De-La-Torre|first=G.|title=The Importance of the Sense of Touch in Virtual and Real Environments|journal=IEEE Multimedia|date=1 July 2006|volume=13|issue=3|pages=24–30|doi=10.1109/MMUL.2006.69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Somatosensory system ===
{{Main|Somatosensory system}}

The somatosensory system assimilates many kinds of information from the environment: temperature, texture, pressure, proprioception, and pain. The signals vary for each of these perceptions, and the receptor systems reflect this: [[Thermoreceptor]]s, [[mechanoreceptors]], [[nociceptors]], and [[chemoreceptors]].

=== Haptic cues in research ===

==== The interaction between haptic and visual cues ====
In addition to the interplay of [[haptic communication]] and [[nonverbal communication]], haptic cues as primers have been looked at as a means of decreasing reaction time for identifying a visual stimulus.&lt;ref name="Haptic Visual Priming"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Validity of Haptic Cues and Its Effect on Priming Visual Spatial Attention|year=2003|doi=10.1109/HAPTIC.2003.1191265|url=https://engineering.purdue.edu/hirl/projects/papers/back/C36_Young_HS2003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subjects were placed in a chair fitted with a back which provided haptic cues indicating where the stimulus would appear on a screen. Valid haptic cues significantly decreased reaction time while invalid cues increased reaction time.&lt;ref name="Haptic Visual Priming" /&gt;

==== Use in technology for the visually impaired ====
Haptic cues are used frequently to allow those who have impaired vision to have access to a greater wealth of information. [[Braille]] is a tactile written language which is read via touch, brushing the fingers over the raised patterns. [[Braille technology]] is the attempt to extend Braille to digital media and developing new tools to aid in the reading of web pages and other electronic devices often involves a combination of haptic and auditory cues.&lt;ref name="Structure recognition"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jay|first=Caroline|author2=Stevens, Robert |author3=Hubbold, Roger |author4= Glencross, Mashhuda |title=Using haptic cues to aid nonvisual structure recognition|journal=ACM Transactions on Applied Perception|date=1 May 2008|volume=5|issue=2|pages=1–14|doi=10.1145/1279920.1279922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major issue that different technologies in this area attempt to overcome is sensory overload. The amount of information that can be quickly related via touch is less than that of vision and is limited by current technology. As a result, multi-modal approaches, converting the visual information into both haptic and auditory output, often have the best results. For example, an electronic pen can be drawn across a tablet mapped to the screen and produce different vibrations and sounds depending on what is at that location.&lt;ref name="Structure recognition" /&gt;

== Olfactory cues ==
An olfactory cue is a chemical signal received by the olfactory system that represents an incoming signal received through the nose. This allows humans and animals to smell the chemical signal given off by a physical object. Olfactory cues are extremely important for sexual reproduction, as they trigger [[Animal sexual behavior|mating behavior]] in many species, as well as maternal bonding and survival techniques such as detecting spoiled food. The results of receiving and processing this information is known as the sense of smell.

=== Olfactory system ===
{{Main|Olfactory System}}
The process of smelling begins when chemical molecules enter the nose and reach the [[olfactory mucosa]], a dime-sized region located in the nasal cavity that contains olfactory receptor neurons. There are 350 types of olfactory receptors, each sensitive to a narrow range of odorants. These neurons send signals to the glomeruli within the [[olfactory bulb]]. Each glomerulus collects information from a specific olfactory receptor neuron. The olfactory signal is then conducted to [[piriform cortex]] and the [[amygdala]], and then to the [[Orbitofrontal cortex|orbitalfrontal cortex]], where higher level processing of the odor occurs.

=== Olfactory memory ===
{{Main|Olfactory Memory}}
Olfactory memory is the recollection of a given smell. Research has found that [[odor]] memory is highly persistent and has a high resistance to interference, meaning these memories remain within an individual for long times despite possible interference of other olfactory memories. These memories are mostly [[Explicit memory|explicit]], though implicit forms of odor memory do provide some understanding of memory.  Mammalian olfactory cues play an important role in the coordination of the mother infant bond, and the following normal development of the offspring.
Olfactory memory is especially important for maternal behavior. Studies have shown that the fetus becomes familiar with olfactory cues in the within the uterus. This is demonstrated by research that suggests that newborns respond positively to the smell of their own amniotic fluid, meaning that fetuses learn from these cues in the womb.&lt;ref name="Odour preferences"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Varendi|first=H|author2=Porter, RH |author3=Winberg, J |title=Natural odour preferences of newborn infants change over time|journal=Acta Paediatrica|date=1 September 1997|volume=86|issue=9|pages=985–990|doi=10.1111/j.1651-2227.1997.tb15184.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental cues ==
'''Environmental cues''' are all of the sensory cues that exist in the environment.

With [[Attention|directed attention]] an environmental cue becomes an attended cue.&lt;ref name=Sensation_Perception&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Bruce E.|title=Sensation and Perception|year=2007|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=978-0-495-60149-4|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most environmental cues are assimilated subconsciously, as in [[Contextual cueing effect|visual contextual cueing]].

Environmental cues serve as the primary context that shapes how the world is perceived and as such they can [[Priming (psychology)|prime]] prior experience to influence memory recall&lt;ref name = "Context_Dependent_Memory"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Godden | first1 = D | last2 = Baddeley | first2 = A. | year = 1975 | title = Context dependent memory in two natural environments | url = | journal = British Journal of Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 3| pages = 325–331 | doi = 10.1111/j.2044-8295.1975.tb01468.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; and decision making.&lt;ref name="Food_Choice"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/605327 |title=The Effects of Advertising Copy on Sensory Thoughts and Perceived Taste |year=2010 |last1=Elder |first1=Ryan S. |last2=Krishna |first2=Aradhna |journal=Journal of Consumer Research |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=748–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has applied use in [[marketing]] as there is evidence to suggest a store's atmosphere and layout can influence purchasing behavior.&lt;ref name="Marketing_Influence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Julie|author2=Parasuraman, A. |author3=Grewal, Dhruv |author4= Voss, Glenn B. |title=The Influence of Multiple Store Environment Cues on Perceived Merchandise Value and Patronage Intentions|journal=Journal of Marketing|date=1 April 2002|volume=66|issue=2|pages=120–141|doi=10.1509/jmkg.66.2.120.18470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental cues play a direct role in mediating the behavior of both plants&lt;ref name="Plant_Environment"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berger|first=Jonah A.|author2=Heath, Chip |title=Idea Habitats: How the Prevalence of Environmental Cues Influences the Success of Ideas|journal=Cognitive Science |date= March–April 2010 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages= 195–221 |doi= 10.1207/s15516709cog0000_10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and animals. For example, environmental cues, such as temperature change or food availability affect the [[Spawning triggers|spawning behavior]] of fish. In addition to cues generated by the environment itself, cues generated by other agents, such as ant pheromone trails, can influence behavior [[Stygmergy|to indirectly coordinate actions between those agents]].

In the study of perception environmental cues play a large role in experimental design since these mechanisms evolved within a natural environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geisler | first1 = W.

If the experimental environment is too artificial it can damage external validity in an [[Ideal observer analysis#Natural and pseudo-natural tasks|ideal observer]] experiment that makes use of natural scene statistics.

{{MahayanaBuddhism}}

The '''Ten suchnesses''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 十如是 ''shí rúshì''; [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 十如是 ''jū nyoze'') are a [[Mahayana]] doctrine which is important, as well as unique, to that of the [[Tiantai]] ([[Tendai]]) and [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren]] [[Buddhist]] schools of thought.  The doctrine is derived from a passage found within the second chapter of Kumarajiva's Chinese translation of the [[Lotus Sutra]], that "characterizes the ultimate reality (literally, “real mark”) of all dharmas in terms of ten suchnesses."{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=845}} This concept is also known as the '''ten reality aspects''', '''ten factors of life''', or the '''Reality of all Existence'''.&lt;ref name=Reeves&gt;{{harvnb|Reeves|2008|p=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soka Gakkai English Buddhist Dictionary Committee"&gt;{{harvnb|Soka Gakkai English Buddhist Dictionary Committee|2002|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kato&gt;{{harvnb|Kato|1993|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The list of ten suchnesses is neither found in [[Dharmaraksha]]'s Chinese translation nor in the Tibetan edition or any of the extant Sanskrit manuscripts.{{sfn|Robert|2011|pp=148-153}}{{sfn|Pye|2003|pp=20-21}}{{sfn|Groner|2014|p=7}} 
  
The Sanskrit editions of the Lotus Sutra list only five elements:{{sfn|Groner|2014|p=7}}{{refn |group=note|Similar translations of this passage in Sanskrit manuscripts were published by Kern and Burnouf.{{sfn|Kern |1884|p=32}}{{sfn|Burnouf|1925|p=20}}}}
{{quote|Only the Thus Come One knows all the dharmas:
what are the dharmas,
how are the dharmas,
what are the dharmas like,
of what characteristics are the dharmas,
of what nature are the dharmas;
what they are,
how they are,
what they are like,
of what characteristics they are,
of what nature are the dharmas,
only the Thus Come One has had direct experience in those dharmas.{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=148}}{{sfn|Wogihara|1934|p=20}}}}

[[Kumarajiva]] translates the passage in Chapter Two as:{{refn |group=note|For alternative English translations of Kumarajiva's text, see Kato, Kubo and Watson.{{sfn|Kato|1975|p=31}}{{sfn|Kubo|2007|p=23}}{{sfn|Watson|2009|p=57}}}}
{{quote|Only a Buddha and a Buddha can exhaust their reality, namely the suchness of the dharmas, the suchness of their marks, the suchness of their nature, the suchness of their substance, the suchness of their powers, the suchness of their functions, the suchness of their causes, the suchness of their conditions, the suchness of their effects, the suchness of their retributions, and the absolute identity of their beginning and end.{{sfn|Hurvitz |1976|pp=22-23}}}}

The discrepancy between Kumarajivas translation and  the Sanskrit editions might be due to Kumarajiva's use of a manuscript variant but Groner and Stone suggest that "the expansion of this list to ten is probably
Kumarajiva's invention and may well be presaged in a passage in the Dazhidulun that includes nine aspects."{{sfn|Groner|2014|p=7-8}}{{sfn|Robert|2011|p=148}}{{refn |group=note|The Great Perfection of Wisdom Treatise (Chinese Dazhidu lun, Japanese Daichido ron), a work traditionally attributed to [[Nagarjuna]], translated by [[Kumarajiva]] in 406 CE (T 25.298c). It contains a broad commentary on the Pancavimsatisahasrikaprajnaparamitasutra and Buswell describes it as an "authoritative source" of Mahayana doctrine for Chinese scholars like Sengzhao, Fazang, Zhiyi and Tanluan.{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=227}}{{sfn|Lamotte|1944|p=}}}}

== Definitions ==
The following definitions are given by the Soka Gakkai English Buddhist Dictionary Committee&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Soka Gakkai English Buddhist Dictionary Committee|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describe what each suchness means in more detail:

* Appearance (form): the attributes of everything that is discernible, such as color, shape, or behavior.
* Nature (nature): the inherent disposition or quality of a person or thing that cannot be discerned from the outward appearance.
* Entity (embodiment): the substance of life that permeates as well as integrates both appearance and nature.
The above three suchnesses describe the reality of life itself.  The next six suchnesses, from the fourth through the ninth, explain the functions and workings of life.
* Power (potency): life's potential energy.
* Influence (function): the activity produced when life's inherent power or potential energy is activated.
* Internal cause (primary cause): the potential cause in life that produces an effect of the same quality as itself, i.e., good, evil, or neutral.
* Relation (secondary Cause): the relationship of secondary, indirect causes to the internal cause. Secondary causes are various conditions, both internal and external, that help the internal cause produce an effect.
* Latent effect (effect): the dormant effect produced in life when an internal cause is activated through its related conditions.
* Manifest effect (recompense): the tangible, perceivable effect that emerges in time as an expression of a dormant effect and therefore of a potential cause, again through its related conditions.
* Consistency from beginning to end (complete fundamental whole): the unifying factor among the ten suchnesses. It indicates that all of the other nine suchnesses from ''Appearance'' to ''Manifest Effect'' are consistently interrelated. All nine suchnesses thus harmoniously express the same condition of existence at any given moment.

==Interpretation==
The ten suchnesses, or categories, are what led the sixth century [[Chinese Buddhist]] philosopher [[Zhiyi]] to establish the doctrine of the "three thousand [worlds] in one thought."&lt;ref name=Kato /&gt;  
The Tiantai school describes [[Ten spiritual realms|ten dharma realms]] (ch. shi fajie) of sentient beings, the realms of hell dwellers, [[hungry ghosts]], beasts, [[asuras]], humans, gods ([[deva (Buddhism)|deva]]s), [[sravaka]]s, [[pratyekabuddha]]s, [[bodhisattva]]s and [[Buddhas]].{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=804}}{{sfn|Pocezki|2014|p=168}} According to Zhiyi, each of these ten dharma realms mutually includes all of the other realms, resulting in 100 "states of existence" that share the characteristics of the ten suchnesses.{{sfn|Swanson|1989|pp=11-12}} The one thousand suchnesses are active in each of the three spheres (the five [[skandha]]s, sentient beings,and their environment) forming three thousand worlds in one thought moment.{{sfn|Gregory|2002|pp=410-411, 437}}{{sfn|Buswell|2013|p=1029}}

[[Nichiren]] regarded the doctrine of "three thousand [worlds] in one thought" (''ichinen-sanzen'') as the fundamental principle of the Lotus Sutra{{sfn|Endo|2014|p=59}} and the very essence of the [[Buddha]]'s teachings.&lt;ref name=Niwano&gt;{{harvnb|Niwano|1976|p=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote in his work ''Kaimoku-shō'' (Essay on the Eye-opener) concerning ''ichinen-sanzen'': "The very doctrine of the Three Thousand Realms in One Mind of the Tendai sect appears to be the way to lead man to [[buddhahood]]."&lt;ref name=Niwano /&gt;

[[Nikkyo Niwano]] states that the principle of the Reality of All Existence not only analyzes what modern science would analyze in physical substances to the extent of [[subatomic particles]], but also extends to [[:wikt:mental state|mental state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niwano|1976|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, everyone's mind has existing within it the [[Ten spiritual realms|ten realms of existence]] which are said to be found within one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niwano|1976|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The suchnesses reveal the deepest reality inherent within all things, and, consequently, innumerable embodied substances existing in the universe are interrelated with all things.
The suchnesses, one through nine, operate according to the [[Dharma (Buddhism)|law of the universal truth]], namely from the "complete fundamental whole" under which no one, no thing, and no function can depart.  All things, including man, along with their relations with everything else are formed from the Reality of All Existence that is the Ten Suchnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Niwano|1976|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Verbal Behavior''''' is a 1957 book by [[psychologist]] [[B. F.

However, he opted to remove most of the research, he says, because it made the book "unbalanced". This research was also primarily structural in nature, and owed more to Skinner's history as a college English major than it did to his later functional analysis of behavior.&lt;/ref&gt; It was an outgrowth of a series of lectures first presented at the University of Minnesota in the early 1940s and developed further in his summer lectures at Columbia and [[William James]] lectures at Harvard in the decade before the book's publication.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F.

==Functional analysis==
{{Psychology sidebar}}

This is now sometimes called the ''four-term contingency model'' with setting conditions added as a fourth term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bijou |last2=Baer |year=1978 |title=The behavior analysis of child development |publisher=Englewood-cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hill |isbn=1-878978-03-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Morris |first=E.K. |year=1992 |title=The aim, progress, and evolution of behavior analysis  |pmc=2733403 |journal=The Behavior Analyst |volume=15 |pages=3–29 |pmid=22478111 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This consists of a ''motivating operation'' (MO), ''discriminative stimulus'' (S{{sup|D}}), ''response'' (R), and ''reinforcement'' (S{{sup|rein}}).&lt;ref&gt;However, the four-term model post-dates Skinner's work—having arisen most notably in the writings of Dr. Jack Michael, and Skinner refers exclusively to the three-term model without the MO as such. Although Skinner does refer to states of ''deprivation'' and ''satiation'' which are essentially the same thing which the MO term encompasses and extends upon.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's ''Verbal Behavior'' also introduced the [[autoclitic]] and six elementary operants: mand, tact, audience relation, echoic, textual, and intraverbal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Verbal Behavior  |authorlink=B.F. Skinner |place=Acton, MA |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |year=1957 |isbn=1-58390-021-7}} from the forward by Jack Michael, p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; For Skinner, the proper object of study is ''behavior itself'', analyzed without reference to hypothetical (mental) structures, but rather with reference to the functional relationships of the behavior in the environment in which it occurs. This analysis extends [[Ernst Mach]]'s pragmatic inductive position in physics, and extends even further a disinclination towards hypothesis-making and testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Skinner |first=B.F. |year=1950 |title=Are Theories of Learning Necessary? |url=http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Theories/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verbal Behavior'' is divided into 5 parts with 19 chapters.&lt;ref name="Chiesa 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=William |last=Baum |title=Understanding Behaviorism: Behavior, Culture, and Evolution |place=Malden, MA |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-4051-1262-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first chapter sets the stage for this work, a functional analysis of verbal behavior. Skinner presents verbal behavior as a function of controlling consequences and stimuli, not as the product of a special inherent capacity. Neither does he ask us to be satisfied with simply describing the structure, or patterns, of behavior. Skinner deals with some alternative, traditional formulations, and moves on to his own functional position.

==General problems==
In the ascertaining of the strength of a response Skinner suggests some criteria for ''strength'' (probability): emission, energy-level, speed, repetition, but notes that these are all very limited means for inferring the strength of a response as they do not always vary together as they may come under the control of other factors. Emission is a [[yes/no]] measure, however the other three—energy-level, speed, repetition—comprise ''possible indications of relative strength''.&lt;ref name="Burrhus"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Behavior of Organisms |authorlink=B.F. Skinner |place=Acton, MA |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |orig-year=First published 1938 |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-87411-487-4 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Emission – If a response is emitted it may tend to be interpreted as having some strength. Unusual or difficult conditions would tend to lend evidence to the inference of strength. Under typical conditions it becomes a less compelling basis for inferring strength. This is an inference that is either there or not, and has no gradation of value.
* Energy-level – Unlike emission as a basis for inference, energy-level (response magnitude) provides a basis for inferring the response has a strength with a high range of varying strength. Energy level is a basis from which we can infer a high tendency to respond. An energetic and strong ''"Chomsky!"'' forms the basis for inferring the strength of the response as opposed to a weak, brief "Chomsky".&lt;ref name="Burrhus"/&gt;
* Speed – Speed is the speed of the response itself, or the latency from the time in which it could have occurred to the time in which it occurs. A response given quickly when prompted forms the basis for inferring a high strength.&lt;ref name="Burrhus"/&gt;
* Repetition – "Chomsky! Chomsky! Chomsky!" may be emitted and used as an indication of relative strength compared to the speedy and/or energetic emission of "Chomsky!". In this way repetition can be used as a way to infer strength

==Mands==
{{Main|Mand (psychology)}}
Chapter Three of Skinner's work ''Verbal Behavior'' discusses a functional relationship called the "mand". Mand is verbal behaviour under functional control of satiation or deprivation (that is, motivating operations) followed by characteristic reinforcement often specified by the response.  A mand is typically a demand, command, or request.  The mand is often said to "describe its own reinforcer" although this is not always the case, especially as Skinner's definition of verbal behaviour does not require that mands be vocal.  A loud knock at the door, may be a mand "open the door" and a servant may be called by a hand clap as much as a child might "ask for milk".

Lamarre &amp; Holland (1985) study on mands demonstrated the role of motivating operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lamarre, J. |author2=Holland, J.G. |title=The functional independence of mands and tacts |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=5–19 |date=January 1985 |pmid=16812407 |pmc=1348092 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1985.43-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors contrived motivating operations for objects by training behavioural chains that could not be completed without certain objects.  The participants learned to mand for these missing objects, which they had previously only been able to tact...

==Behavior under the control of verbal stimuli==

===Textual===
In Chapter Four Skinner notes forms of control by verbal stimuli. One form is textual behavior which refers to the type of behavior we might typically call reading or writing. A vocal response is controlled by a verbal stimulus that is not heard. There are two different modalities involved ("reading"). If they are the same they become "copying text" (see Jack Michael on copying text), if they are heard, then written, it becomes "taking dictation", and so on.

===Echoic===
Skinner was one of the first to seriously consider the role of imitation in language learning. He introduced this concept into his book ''Verbal Behavior'' with the concept of the echoic. It is a behavior under the functional control of a verbal stimulus. The verbal response and the verbal stimulus share what is called point to point correspondence (a formal similarity.) The speaker repeats what is said. In echoic behavior, the stimulus is auditory and response is vocal. It is often seen in early shaping behavior. For example, in learning a new language, a teacher might say "parsimonious" and then say "can you say it?" to induce an echoic response.

Winokur (1978) is one example of research about echoic relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boe, R. |author2=Winokur, S. |title=A procedure for studying echoic control in verbal behavior |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=213–7 |date=September 1978 |pmid=16812100 |pmc=1332717 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1978.30-213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tacts==
{{Main|Tact (psychology)}}
Chapter Five of ''Verbal Behavior'' discusses the tact in depth. A tact is said to "make contact with" the world, and refers to behavior that is under functional control of a non-verbal stimulus and generalized conditioned reinforcement. The controlling stimulus is nonverbal, "the whole of the physical environment". In linguistic terms, the tact might be regarded as "expressive labelling".  Tact is the most useful form of verbal behaviour to other listeners, as it extends the listeners contact with the environment.  In contrast, the tact is the most useful form of verbal behaviour to the speaker as it allows to contact tangible reinforcement.   
Tacts can undergo many extensions: generic, metaphoric, metonymical, solecistic, nomination, and "guessing". It can also be involved in abstraction. Lowe, Horne, Harris &amp; Randle (2002) would be one example of recent work in tacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fergus Lowe, C. |author2=Horne, P.J. |author3=Harris, F.D. |author4=Randle, V.R. |title=Naming and categorization in young children: vocal tact training |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=527–49 |date=November 2002 |pmid=12507018 |pmc=1284914 |doi=10.1901/jeab.2002.78-527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intraverbal==
Intraverbals are verbal behavior under the control of other verbal behavior. Intraverbals are often studied by the use of classic association techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moran |first=D.J. |last2= Verplanck |first2=W.S. |year=2003 |title=The Associate Technique: Assessing Intraverbal Repertoires in the Classroom |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=4 |issue=4 |pages=346–60 |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-44679-002.pdf
|doi=10.1037/h0100126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audiences==
Audience control is developed through long histories of reinforcement and punishment. Skinner's [[Applied behavior analysis#Discriminated operant and three-term contingency|three-term contingency]] can be used to analyze how this works: the first term, the antecedent, refers to the audience, in whose presence the verbal response (the second term) occurs. The consequences of the response are the third term, and whether or not those consequences strengthen or weaken the response will affect whether that response will occur again in the presence of that audience. Through this process, audience control, or the probability that certain responses will occur in the presence of certain audiences, develops. Skinner notes that while audience control is developed due to histories with certain audiences, we do not have to have a long history with every listener in order to effectively engage in verbal behavior in their presence (p.&amp;nbsp;176). We can respond to new audiences (new stimuli) as we would to similar audiences with whom we have a history.

===Negative audiences===
An audience that has punished certain kinds of verbal behavior is called a negative audience (p.&amp;nbsp;178): in the presence of this audience, the punished verbal behavior is less likely to occur. Skinner gives the examples of adults punishing certain verbal behavior of children, and a king punishing the verbal behavior of his subjects.

==Summary of verbal operants==

One must keep in mind, however, that almost all verbal behavior does not consist of these "pure" operants, but of a mixture of them.

==Use in literary analysis==
Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior drew heavily on methods of literary analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1957). ''Verbal Behavior''.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition has continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grant L.K. |year=2005 |title=Story Analysis and the Literary Method |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2014-51875-003.pdf |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=178–85 |doi=10.1037/h0100069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Verbal operants as a unit of analysis==
Skinner notes his categories of verbal behavior: ''mand, textual, intraverbal, tact, audience relations'', and notes how behavior might be classified. He notes that form alone is not sufficient (he uses the example of "fire!" having multiple possible relationships depending on the circumstances). Classification depends on knowing the circumstances under which the behavior is emitted. Skinner then notes that the "same response" may be emitted under different operant conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner's analysis of verbal behavior is not specifically a matter of "teaching children how to talk", however he does speculate on this on p. 189 in terms of mands and tacts acquisition by children. I note this because Skinner's ''Verbal Behavior'' is widely cited as a template for teaching children language skills although it does not appear to specifically be designed for this task.&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner states:
{{quote|"Classification is not an end in itself. Even though any instance of verbal behavior can be shown to be a function of variables in one or more of these classes, there are other aspects to be treated. Such a formulation permits us to apply to verbal behavior concepts and laws which emerge from a more general analysis" (p. 187).&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, Burrhus Frederick (1957), ''Verbal Behavior'', Acton, MA: Copley Publishing Group, {{ISBN|1-58390-021-7}} p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;}}

That is, classification alone does little to further the analysis—the functional relations controlling the operants outlined must be analyzed consistent with the general approach of a scientific analysis of behavior.

==Multiple causation==
Skinner notes in this chapter how any given response is likely to be the result of multiple variables. Secondly, that any given variable usually affects multiple responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Verbal Behavior |authorlink=B.F. Skinner |place=Acton, MA |publisher=Copley Publishing Group |year=1957 |isbn=1-58390-021-7 |page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of multiple audiences is also addressed, as each audience is, as already noted, an occasion for strong and successful responding. Combining audiences produces differing tendencies to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Normand |first=M. |year=2001 |title=Verbal Behavior: History and Future |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_1_3/ai_n28132971/ |accessdate=1 April 2011 |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages= 41–55 |doi=10.1037/h0099959}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leigland2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leigland |first=S. |year=2007 |title=Fifty Years Later: Comments on the Further Development of a Science of Verbal Behavior |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_8/ai_n28461024/ |accessdate=1 April 2011 |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=336–46 |doi=10.1037/h0100625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supplementary stimulation==
Supplementary stimulation is a discussion to practical matters of controlling verbal behavior given the context of material which has been presented thus far. Issues of multiple control, and involving many of the elementary operants stated in previous chapters are discussed.

==New combinations of fragmentary responses==
A special case of where multiple causation comes into play creating new verbal forms is in what Skinner describes as fragmentary responses. Such combinations are typically vocal, although this may be due to different conditions of self-editing rather than any special property. Such mutations may be "nonsense" and may not further the verbal interchange in which it occurs. Freudian slips may be one special case of fragmentary responses which tend to be given reinforcement and may discourage self-editing. This phenomenon appears to be more common in children, and in adults learning a second language. Fatigue, illness and insobriety may tend to produce fragmentary responding.

==Autoclitics==
{{Main|Autoclitic}}
An autoclitic is a form of verbal behavior which modifies the functions of other forms of verbal behavior. For example, "I think it is raining" possesses the autoclitic "I think" which moderates the strength of the statement "it is raining". An example of research that involved autoclitics would be Lodhi &amp; Greer (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lodhi, S. |author2=Greer, R.D. |title=The speaker as listener |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=353–9 |date=May 1989 |pmid=16812582 |pmc=1338927 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1989.51-353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One form of autoclitic of critical importance in the development of language, is Skinner's concept of the autoclitic frame. Autoclitic frames help for rapid learning of new verbal behavior and the building of rules.&lt;ref name="Stemmer N 2000 23–28"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stemmer, N. |year=2000 |title=The Role of Action Names, Action Frames, and Modifiers in Listener |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_1/ai_n28820034/ |accessdate=1 April 2011 |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=23–8 |doi=10.1037/h0099876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stemmer (2000) holds: "(1) The events are responsible for the productive character of listener behavior and, via the transfer effect, of verbal behavior in general. (2) Together with ostensive events, the events are responsible for most aspects, probably even for all aspects, of early listener behavior. (3) Because ostensive learning does not require the repeated reinforcement of specific responses to vocal stimuli, the events are the main cause of the explosion in early verbal behavior."&lt;ref name="Stemmer N 2000 23–28"/&gt;
&lt;!--remove until there is something here? ===Defective self-observation===--&gt;

==Self-strengthening==
Here Skinner draws a parallel to his position on self-control and notes: "A person controls his own behavior, verbal or otherwise, as he controls the behavior of others."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Burrhus Frederick |last=Skinner |title=Science and human behavior |publisher=Mcmillon |year=1953 |isbn=0-02-929040-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriate verbal behavior may be weak, as in forgetting a name, and in need of strengthening. It may have been inadequately learned, as in a foreign language. Repeating a formula, reciting a poem, and so on. The techniques are manipulating stimuli, changing the level of editing, the mechanical production of verbal behavior, changing motivational and emotional variables, incubation, and so on. Skinner gives an example of the use of some of these techniques provided by an author.

==Logical and scientific==
The special audience in this case is one concerned with "successful action". Special methods of [[stimulus control]] are encouraged that will allow for maximum effectiveness. Skinner notes that "graphs, models, tables" are forms of texts that allow for this kind of development. The logical and scientific community also sharpens responses to assure accuracy and avoiding distortion. Little progress in the area of science has been made from a verbal behavior perspective; however, suggestions of a research agenda have been laid out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cautilli, J.D. |author2=Skinner, L. |year=2001 |title=Toward a Functional Analysis of "Scientific" Verbal Behavior: A Preliminary Essay |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_2/ai_n28128045/ |accessdate=1 April 2011 |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=250–2 |doi=10.1037/h0099943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.11.1423 |author=Guerin, B. |year=1992 |title=Behavior analysis and the social construction of knowledge |journal=American Psychologist |volume=47 |issue=11 |pages=1423–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tacting private events==
Private events are events accessible to only the speaker. Public events are events that occur outside of an organism's skin that are observed by more than one individual. A headache is an example of a private event and a car accident is an example of a public event.

The tacting of private events by an organism is shaped by the verbal community who differentially reinforce a variety of behaviors and responses to the private events that occur (Catania, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;9). For example, if a child verbally states, "a circle" when a circle is in the immediate environment, it may be a tact. If a child verbally states, "I have a toothache", she/he may be tacting a private event, whereas the stimulus is present to the speaker, but not the rest of the verbal community.

The verbal community shapes the original development and the maintenance or discontinuation of the tacts for private events (Catania, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;232). An organism responds similarly to both private stimuli and public stimuli (Skinner, 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;130). However, it is harder for the verbal community to shape the verbal behavior associated with private events (Catania, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;403). It may be more difficult to shape private events, but there are critical things that occur within an organism's skin that should not be excluded from our understanding of verbal behavior (Catania, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;9).

Several concerns are associated with tacting private events. Skinner (1957) acknowledged two major dilemmas. First, he acknowledges our difficulty with predicting and controlling the stimuli associated with tacting private events (p.&amp;nbsp;130). Catania (2007) describes this as the unavailability of the stimulus to the members of the verbal community (p.&amp;nbsp;253). The second problem Skinner (1957) describes is our current inability to understand how the verbal behavior associated with private events is developed (p.&amp;nbsp;131).

Skinner (1957) continues to describe four potential ways a verbal community can encourage verbal behavior with no access to the stimuli of the speaker. He suggests the most frequent method is via "a common public accompaniment". An example might be that when a kid falls and starts bleeding, the caregiver tells them statements like, "you got hurt". Another method is the "collateral response" associated with the private stimulus. An example would be when a kid comes running and is crying and holding their hands over their knee, the caregiver might make a statement like, "you got hurt". The third way is when the verbal community provides reinforcement contingent on the overt behavior and the organism generalizes that to the private event that is occurring. Skinner refers to this as "metaphorical or metonymical extension". The final method that Skinner suggests may help form our verbal behavior is when the behavior is initially at a low level and then turns into a private event (Skinner, 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;134). This notion can be summarized by understanding that the verbal behavior of private events can be shaped through the verbal community by extending the language of tacts (Catania, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;263).

Private events are limited and should not serve as "explanations of behavior" (Skinner, 1957, p.&amp;nbsp;254). Skinner (1957) continues to caution that, "the language of private events can easily distract us from the public causes of behavior" (see functions of behavior).

===Chomsky's review===

According to [[Frederick J. Newmeyer]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Chomsky's review has come to be regarded as one of the foundational documents of the discipline of [[cognitive psychology]], and even after the passage of twenty-five years it is considered the most important refutation of behaviorism.  Of all his writings, it was the Skinner review which contributed most to spreading his reputation beyond the small circle of professional linguists.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Newmeyer, ''The Politics of Linguistics'' (1986), {{ISBN|0-226-57720-1}}, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chomsky's 1959 review, amongst his other work of the period, is generally thought to have been influential in the decline of behaviorism's influence within [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogsci.umn.edu/OLD/calendar/past_events/millennium/final.html |accessdate=2008-07-09 |title=The Cognitive Science Millennium Project |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624123743/http://www.cogsci.umn.edu/OLD/calendar/past_events/millennium/final.html |archivedate=June 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Miller, G.A. |title=The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective |journal=Trends Cogn. Sci. (Regul. Ed.) |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=141–4 |date=March 2003 |pmid=12639696 |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00029-9 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364661303000299}}&lt;!--http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~geo/Miller.pdf--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has drawn fire from a number of critics, the most famous criticism being that of Kenneth MacCorquodale's 1970 paper ''On Chomsky's Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior''.&lt;ref name=MacQuorcodale&gt;{{Cite journal |last=MacQuorcodale |first=Kenneth |title=A reply to Chomsky's Review of Skinner's Verbal Behavior |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=13 |pages=83–99 |pmc=1333660 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1970.13-83 |year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacCorquodale argued that Chomsky did not possess an adequate understanding of either behavioral psychology in general, or the differences between Skinner's behaviorism and other varieties. As a consequence, he argued, Chomsky made several serious errors of logic. On account of these problems, MacCorquodale maintains that the review failed to demonstrate what it has often been cited as doing, implying that those most influenced by Chomsky's paper probably already substantially agreed with him. Chomsky's review has been further argued to misrepresent the work of Skinner and others, including by taking quotes out of context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Adelman |first=Barry Eshkol |title=An Underdiscussed Aspect of Chomsky (1959) |journal=Anal Verbal Behav |year=2007 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=29–34 |pmc=2774611 |pmid=22477378 |doi=10.1007/bf03393044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky has maintained that the review was directed at the way Skinner's variant of behavioral psychology "was being used in Quinean empiricism and naturalization of philosophy".&lt;ref&gt;Barsky (1997), {{cite web |url=http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/3/2.html |title=Chapter 3 |accessdate=2007-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012220023/http://cognet.mit.edu/library/books/chomsky/chomsky/3/2.html |archive-date=2007-10-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky's influence was a point that Skinner himself conceded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=David C|date=2006-01-01|title=On Chomsky's Appraisal of Skinner's Verbal Behavior: A Half Century of Misunderstanding|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=29|issue=2|pages=253–267|issn=0738-6729|pmc=2223153|pmid=22478467|doi=10.1007/bf03392134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Leigland suggests that interest in Skinner's work is growing with the next focus on a variety of complex verbal phenomena.&lt;ref name="Leigland2007"/&gt;

===Alternatives to Skinner's behavior analysis===
There is also now an alternative to Skinner's account within behavior analysis, [[relational frame theory]], and authors in that area have developed a number of behavior analytic objections to Skinner's specific approach. There is some controversy regarding RFT's status in regard to behavior analysis. Its founder Steven Hayes regards it as an extension of [[operant conditioning]] principles that is consistent with Skinner's analysis but goes beyond it (personal communication{{Clarify|date=December 2008|reason=to whom?, when?}}).

Others feel that it is consistent with behavior analysis but involves emergent principles '''not''' found in conventional operant conditioning. Finally, there are those who feel that it is simply another form of cognitive behaviorism, rather than radical behaviorism.

==Research and theory==
[[Functional analytic psychotherapy]] is one application of Skinner's model of verbal behavior to typically developing adult human populations in non-laboratory (clinical) settings.&lt;ref&gt;Kohlenberg &amp; Tsai 1991 Functional Analytic Psychotherapy&lt;/ref&gt; As such this approach represents an attempt to empirically validate [[applied behavior analysis]] and verbal behavior for problems such as depression and other common clinical problems.

Current research in verbal behavior is published in ''The Analysis of Verbal Behavior''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abainternational.org/TAVB.asp |title=Journals of the Association for Behavior Analysis |publisher=Abainternational.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306110601/http://www.abainternational.org/TAVB.asp |archivedate=March 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (TAVB), and other Behavior Analytic journals such as ''The [[Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior]]'' (JEAB) and the ''[[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]'' (JABA). Also research is presented at poster sessions and conferences, such as at regional Behavior Analysis conventions&lt;ref&gt;see the California Association for Behavior Analysis (CalABA) for example&lt;/ref&gt; or Association for Behavior Analysis (ABA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abainternational.org |title=Association for Behavior Analysis International |publisher=Abainternational.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; conventions nationally or internationally. There is also a Verbal Behavior Special Interest Group (SIG)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psyc.csustan.edu/verbalbehavior/ |title=Verbal Behavior-Special Interest Group |publisher=Psyc.csustan.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128031246/http://psyc.csustan.edu/verbalbehavior/ |archive-date=2012-01-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Association for Behavior Analysis (ABA) which has a mailing list.&lt;ref&gt;http://lists.csustan.edu/mailman/listinfo/verbalbeh-l&lt;/ref&gt;

''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Cautilli, Copyright,2009-Website designed and maintained by BAO Journals |url=http://www.baojournal.com/ |title=See Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention |publisher=Baojournal.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joe Cautilli, Copyright,2009-Website designed and maintained by BAO Journals |url=http://www.baojournal.com/ |title=See Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis |publisher=Baojournal.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; both publish clinical articles on interventions based on verbal behavior.

Skinner has argued that his account of verbal behavior might have a strong evolutionary parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Skinner, B.F. |title=The Evolution of Verbal Behavior |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=115–22 |date=January 1986 |pmid=16812440 |pmc=1348216 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1986.45-115}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Skinner's essay, ''Selection by Consequences'' he argued that operant conditioning was a part of a three-level process involving genetic evolution, cultural evolution and operant conditioning. All three processes, he argued, were examples of parallel processes of selection by consequences. David L. Hull, Rodney E. Langman and Sigrid S. Glenn have developed this parallel in detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hull |first=David |last2=Langman |first2=Rodney E. |last3=Glenn |first3=Sigrid S. |year=2001 |title=A general account of selection: Biology, immunology, and behavior |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=24 |pmid=11682800 |issue=3 |pages=511–28 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=88687 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X0156416X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This topic continues to be a focus for behavior analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Greer |first=R.D. |year=2006 |title=The Evolution of Verbal Behavior in Children |journal=Journal of Speech-Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=1 |pages=111–50 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6888/is_2_1/ai_n28461334/ |doi=10.1037/h0100194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cautilli |first=J.D. |last2=Hantula |first2=D.A. |year=2004 |title=Defining The Verbal Specialist: An Adaptive-Evolutionary View of Deception and Counter-Control |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=204–14 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_2/ai_n28128042/ |accessdate=1 April 2011 |doi=10.1037/h0100032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviour analysists have been working on developing ideas based on Verbal Behaviour for fifty years, and despite this, experience difficulty explaining generative verbal behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chase | first1= PN |last2= Ellenwood |first2= DW| last3= Madden | first3= G |title=A behavior analytic analogue of learning to use synonyms, syntax, and parts of speech |journal=Anal Verbal Behav |volume=24 |issue= |pages=31–54 |year=2008 |pmid=22477402 |pmc=2779919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huber, and B.E. Vieux, 2008, Hydrology and Floodplain Analysis, Fourth Edition, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 795 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; V''flo'' employs [[GIS]] maps for parameterization via a desktop interface.&lt;ref&gt;Vieux, B.E., Z. Cui, and A. Gaur, 2004, Evaluation of a physics-based distributed hydrologic model for flood forecasting. ''J. Hydrol.'', '''298'''(1-4): 155-177. DMIP special issue.&lt;/ref&gt;  The model is suited for [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and in continuous operations.  V''flo'' output is in the form of [[hydrograph]]s at selected [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]] grids, as well as [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] runoff maps covering the watershed. Model applications include civil [[infrastructure]] operations and maintenance, [[stormwater]] prediction and [[emergency management]], continuous and short-term surface water [[runoff model (reservoir)|runoff]], recharge estimation, [[soil moisture]] monitoring, [[land use]] planning, [[water quality]] monitoring, and water resources management.

== History ==
V''flo'' considers the spatial character of the [[parameter]]s and precipitation controlling hydrologic processes, and thus improves upon lumped representations previously used in [[Hydrological modelling|hydrologic modeling]].  Historical practice has been to use lumped representations because of computational limitations or because sufficient data was not available to populate a [[Distributed parameter system|distributed]] model database.&lt;ref&gt;Desconnets, J.-C., B.E. Vieux, B. Cappelaere, and F. Delclaux (1996), “A GIS for hydrologic modeling in the semi-arid, HAPEX-Sahel experiment area of Niger Africa.” ''Trans. in GIS'', '''1'''(2): 82-94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Advances in [[computation]]al speed; development of high-resolution precipitation data from [[weather radar|radar]] and satellites; and availability of worldwide digital data sets and [[GIS]] technology makes distributed, physics-based modeling possible.&lt;ref&gt;ASCE, 1999, ''GIS Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed'', Report, ASCE Task Committee, GIS Modules and Distributed Models of the Watershed, P.A. DeBarry, R.G. Quimpo, eds., American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, VA., p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;  V''flo'' is designed to take advantage of the spatial variability of high resolution [[Weather radar|radar rainfall]] input, [[GIS]] datasets, and hydraulic channel characteristics.  Because it is [[physics]]-based, it produces [[hydrograph]]s based on conservation equations and the hydraulics of the [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]], and can be employed in locations where there are no [[rain gauge]]s or previous modeling studies.  In addition, V''flo''’s network approach makes models scalable from upland [[Drainage basin|watersheds]] to river basins using the same [[Drainage system (geomorphology)|drainage network]].

== Formulation ==
V''flo'' is suited for distributed hydrologic forecasting in post-analysis and continuous operations.  V''flo'' models may be [[calibration|calibrated]] by loading precipitation maps for historical events and comparing simulated volume/peak [[hydrograph]]s to observed hydrographs.  Elevation data are taken from a [[digital elevation model]].  A vector channel representation is employed.  Parameterization utilizes digital data sets at any resolution, including [[LIDAR]] terrain data and other digital maps of [[Permeability (earth sciences)|impervious area]], soils, and land use/cover.  V''flo'' is developed to utilize multi-sensor inputs from [[Weather radar|radar]], satellites, [[rain gauge]]s, or model forecasts.  The kinematic wave analogy is used to represent hydraulic conditions in a [[Drainage basin|watershed]].
