      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6663">'''Abu al-Muhajir Dinar''' ({{lang-ar|أبو المهاجر دينار}}) (died 683), [[amir]] of [[Ifriqiya]] under the [[Umayyad]]s. 

== Biography ==
His biography is complicated by the existence of two versions of the history of the [[Umayyad conquest of North Africa]], those written before the 11th century and those written later.&lt;ref&gt;See Benabbès (2005), [[Yves Modéran|Modéran]] (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

He may have been of [[arab]] &lt;ref&gt;See https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abu-al-Muhajir-Dinar-al-Ansari &lt;/ref&gt;, [[Copts|Coptic]], [[Greeks|Greek]] or [[Berbers|Berber]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QNsCPOnTfhoC|title=The Great Arab Conquests: How the Spread of Islam Changed the World We Live In|last=Kennedy|first=Hugh|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2007|isbn=9780306817281|location=|pages=211|language=en|author-link=Hugh N. Kennedy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was originally a slave of [[Maslama ibn Mukhallad al-Ansari|Maslama ibn Mukhallad]], a member of the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]], who gave him his freedom. Maslama, one of [[Muhammad's companions]], was appointed by the first Umayyad caliph [[Muawiyah I]] to the position of [[List of governors of Islamic Egypt|governor of Egypt]] and [[Ifriqiya]]. The inclusion of [[Ifriqiya]] was nominal, as until then the [[Arab]]s had made only temporary raids in that direction without attempting permanent control. 

In 675,&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Abd al-Hakam, p. 197 of Torrey's Arabic text, but on p. 320 of the English translation the date given is 10 years earlier. This is because the translation is based on a single manuscript. The earlier date is not supported by better manuscripts.&lt;/ref&gt; Maslama appointed Abu al-Muhajir to the position of [[amir]] or general of the Umayyad forces in Ifriqiya. This position was already occupied by [[Uqba ibn Nafi]], a member of the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Banu Quraish]]. Maslama advised Abu al-Muhajir to relieve Uqba of his position with due deference, but it seems that this did not happen. Uqba was shackled and thrown into prison, from which he was only released when the Caliph requested to see him. As Uqba left Ifriqiya for [[Damascus]], he vowed to treat Abu al-Muhajir as he had been treated.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Abd al-Hakam, p. 197 of Torrey's Arabic text, p. 321 of English translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Uqba had established a camp at [[Qayrawan]]. It is said that Abu al-Muhajir abandoned this (in some accounts, destroyed it) and built another settlement two miles away.&lt;ref&gt;Location not known with certainty. Ibn Abd al-Hakam, p. 197 Arabic text or p. 321 of translation, states it was 2 miles from [[Qayrawan]]. [[Ibn Idhari]] added that this was in the direction of [[Tunis]]. Solignac p. 22 suggests a [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]-like hill northeast of [[Qayrawan]] called Draa Temmar.&lt;/ref&gt; According to histories written many centuries later this city was called Tākarwān ({{lang-ar|تاكروان}}).&lt;ref&gt;Ad-Dabbagh/Ibn Naji, p. 47 of Cairo edition. In footnotes, the editor gives two later variations: Tīkīrwān ({{lang-ar|تيكيروان}}) from [[Al-Nuwayri]] (14th century) and Tīkarwān ({{lang-ar|تيكروان}}) from [[Ibn Abi Dinar]] in the 16th century.&lt;/ref&gt; Until then it had been the custom for the amirs of Ifriqiya to return to Egypt between raids, and Abu al-Muhajir is said to be the first amir to stay in Ifriqiya permanently.

What Abu al-Muhajir accomplished in the nine or so years of his command are not agreed by the two different versions of the histories. Histories written in the 9th century credit him with advancing no further west than [[Mila, Algeria]],&lt;ref&gt;Or alternatively, the Saharan fort of [[Gemellae]]. [[Khalifa ibn Khayyat]], ''Tarikh'', fide Benabbès (2005), Modéran (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; while those written from the eleventh century on have him capturing [[Tlemcen]].

Muawiyah's successor as Caliph, [[Yazid I]], was responsible for restoring Uqba to his previous position.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Abd al-Hakam, p. 198 of Torrey's Arabic text, p. 322 of English translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Uqba arrived in Ifriqiya in 682, and immediately fulfilled his vow. Abu al-Muhajir was shackled and forced to accompany Uqba whenever he went on expeditions.

In 683,&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Abd al-Hakam, p. 199 of Torrey's Arabic text, p. 324 of English translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Uqba's forces were ambushed by the [[Berber people|Berber]] chief [[Kusaila]] near Tehouda - the ancient Roman fort of ''Thabudeos'' - in [[Algeria]]. Uqba is said to have offered to unchain Abu al-Muhajir so that he might have a better chance to fight, but Abu al-Muhajir said that he would rather die fighting wearing his chains.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Abd al-Hakam, p. 199 of Torrey's Arabic text, p. 323 of English translation.&lt;/ref&gt; Both men were killed in this battle with 300 members of Okba's cavalry . 

He is buried in [[Sidi Okba District|Sidi Okba]] in [[Algeria]] in the al-Shurafa cemetery with 300 dead of the [[Battle of Vescera]] in front of the mosque of Sidi Okba or what is the tomb Uqba ibn Nafi General

'''Alexander Romanovich Belyaev''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Рома́нович Беля́ев}}, {{IPA-ru|ɐlʲɪkˈsandr rɐˈmanəvʲɪtɕ bʲɪˈlʲæɪf|}}; 16 March 1884 – 6 January 1942) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] [[Russia]]n writer of [[science fiction]]. His works from the 1920s and 1930s made him a highly regarded figure in [[Russian science fiction and fantasy|Russian science fiction]], often referred to as "Russia's [[Jules Verne]]".&lt;ref&gt;Русские писатели и поэты. Краткий биографический словарь. Москва, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Belyaev's best known books include ''[[Professor Dowell's Head]]'', ''[[Amphibian Man]]'', ''[[Ariel (novel)|Ariel]]'', and ''[[The Air Seller]]''.

==Biography ==

[[File:Illustrations in science fiction 02.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration to [[Professor Dowell's Head]], a novella about [[mad scientist]] reviving a disembodied head]]

Alexander Belyaev was born in [[Smolensk]] in the family of an [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[priest]]. His father, after losing two other children (Alexander's sister Nina died at childhood from [[sarcoma]] and his brother Vasiliy, a veterinary student, drowned during a boat trip), wanted him to continue the family tradition and enrolled Alexander into Smolensk [[seminary]]. Belyaev, on the other hand, didn't feel particularly religious and even became an [[atheist]] in seminary. After graduating he didn't take his vows and enrolled into a law school. While he studied law his father died and he had to support his mother and other family by giving lessons and writing for theater.

After graduating from the school in 1906 Belyaev became a practicing lawyer and made himself a good reputation. In that period his finances markedly improved, and he traveled around the world extensively as a vacation after each successful case. During that time he continued to write, albeit on small scale. Literature, however, proved increasingly appealing to him, and in 1914 he left law to concentrate on his literary pursuits. However, at the same time, at the age of 30, Alexander became ill with [[tuberculosis]].

Treatment was unsuccessful; the infection spread to his spine and resulted in [[paralysis]] of the legs. Belyaev suffered constant pain and was paralysed for six years. His wife left him, not wanting to care for the paralyzed. In search for the right treatment he moved to [[Yalta]] together with his mother and old nanny. During his convalescence, he read the work of [[Jules Verne]], [[H. G. Wells]], and [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]], and began to write poetry in his hospital bed.

By 1922 he had overcome the disease and tried to find occupation in Yalta. He served a brief stint as a police inspector, tried other odd jobs such as a librarian, but life remained difficult, and in 1923 he moved to [[Moscow]] where he started to practice law again, as a consultant for various Soviet organizations. At the same time Belyaev began his serious literary activity as writer of science fiction novels. In 1925 his first novel, ''Professor Dowell's Head'' (Голова Профессора Доуэля) was published. From 1931 he lived in Leningrad with his wife and oldest daughter; his youngest daughter died of meningitis in 1930, aged six. In Leningrad he met H. G. Wells, who visited the USSR in 1934.

In the last years of his life Belyaev lived in the [[Leningrad]] suburb of [[Pushkin (town)|Pushkin]] (formerly [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). At the beginning of the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]] during the Second World War he refused to evacuate because he was recovering after an operation that he had undergone a few months earlier.

==Death==
Belyaev died of starvation in the Soviet town of Pushkin in 1942 while it was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]]. The exact location of his grave is unknown. A memorial stone at the Kazanskoe cemetery in the town of Pushkin is placed on the mass grave where his body is assumed to be buried.

His wife and daughter managed to survive and got registered as [[Volksdeutsche]] (Belyaev's wife's mother was of Swedish descent). Near the end of the war they were taken away to [[Poland]] by the Nazis. Due to this, after the war, Soviets treated them as collaborators: they were exiled to [[Barnaul]] (Western Siberia) and lived there for 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2001.novayagazeta.ru/nomer/2001/44n/n44n-s15.shtml МАТЕРИК ПОГИБШИХ КОРАБЛЕЙ]. 2001.novayagazeta.ru (28 June 2001). Retrieved on 2015-07-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alexandrbelyaev.ru/content/view/16/184/ Александр Романович Беляев (1942-1984)]. Alexandrbelyaev.ru. Retrieved on 7 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous copyright dispute==
According to the [[Copyright law of the Soviet Union|Soviet copyright law]] in effect until 1964, Belyaev's works entered the [[public domain]] 15 years after his death. In the post-Soviet era, [[Copyright law of Russia|Russia's 1993 copyright law]] granted copyright protection for 50 years after the author's death. With the adoption of Part IV of the [[Civil Code of Russia]] in 2004, copyright protection was extended to 70 years after the author's death, and by an additional 4 years for authors who worked or fought during the [[Great Patriotic War]]. And a 2006 law stated that the Civil Code's copyright protections described under articles 1281, 1318, 1327, and 1331 do not apply to works whose 50 year ''[[post mortem auctoris|p.m.a.]]'' copyright term expired before the 1993 law came into force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Федеральный закон от 18.12.2006 № 231-ФЗ|url=https://ru.wikisource.org/wiki/Федеральный_закон_от_18.12.2006_№_231-ФЗ|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=Russian|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of this contributed to confusion about whether or not Belyaev's works are protected by copyright, and for how long.

In 2008, Terra publishing company acquired exclusive rights to print Belyaev's works from his heirs, and proceeded to sue Astrel and AST-Moskva publishing companies (both part of [[AST (publisher)|AST]]) for violating those exclusive rights. The Moscow arbitration court found in favor of Terra, awarding 7.5 billion rubles in damages and barring Astrel from distributing the "illegally published" works.&lt;ref name="pravo_2011"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Шиняева|first1=Наталья|title=Два года войны продлили срок защиты авторского права фантаста Беляева - решение ВАС|url=https://pravo.ru/news/view/61949/|publisher=Pravo.ru|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=Russian|date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An appellate court found that the awarded damages were calculated unjustifiably and dismissed them.&lt;ref name="pravo_2011"/&gt; On further appeal, a federal arbitration court found that Belyaev's works entered the public domain on 1 January 1993, and could not enjoy copyright protection at all. In 2010, a Krasnodar cassation panel agreed that Belyaev's works are in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Суд признал "Человека-амфибию" народным достоянием|url=https://lenta.ru/news/2010/07/22/belyaev/|publisher=[[Lenta.ru]]|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=Russian|date=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 2011 the [[Supreme Court of Arbitration of Russia]] found that Belyaev's works are protected by copyright until 1 January 2017 due to his activity during the Great Patriotic War, and remanded the case to lower courts for retrial.&lt;ref name="pravo_2011"/&gt;

  Please note:
    The consensus since April 2007 has been to include all three of the definitions of atheism presented in the first paragraph below. They are the result of extensive debate and searches through existing sources – see, for example, the archived talkpage threads [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 27#A survey of definitions for atheism]] and [[Talk:Atheism/Archive 29#List of definitions]] – and formed part of the article when it achieved "Featured Article" status.

    Please, therefore, do not change the contents of the first paragraph without prior discussion on the talk page ([[Talk:Atheism]]), preferably after consulting at least these two threads. If you do make changes to the paragraph without prior discussion, be prepared to see them reverted as an invitation to discussion on the talk page (see [[Wikipedia:BRD]]).

'''Atheism''' is, in the broadest sense, the absence of [[belief]] in the existence of [[Deity|deities]].&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxdicphil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="religioustolerance" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/atheism |encyclopedia=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |title=Atheism |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |accessdate=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less broadly, atheism is the rejection of belief that any deities exist.&lt;ref name="eb2011-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc-philosophy" /&gt;  In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities.&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oxdicphil" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RoweRoutledge" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/#1

The etymological root for the word ''atheism'' originated before the 5th century BCE from the ancient Greek {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}} (''atheos''), meaning "without god(s)". In antiquity it had multiple uses as a pejorative term applied to those thought to reject the gods worshiped by the larger society,&lt;ref name="drachmann" /&gt; those who were forsaken by the gods or those who had no commitment to belief in the gods.&lt;ref name="Battling Whitmarsh" /&gt; The term denoted a social category created by orthodox religionists into which those who did not share their religious beliefs were placed.&lt;ref name="Battling Whitmarsh"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitmarsh|first1=Tim|title=Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|isbn=978-0-307-94877-9 |chapter=8.

New Histories of Atheism}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the spread of [[freethought]], [[skeptical inquiry]], and subsequent increase in [[criticism of religion]], application of the term narrowed in scope. The [[List of atheist philosophers|first individuals]] to identify themselves using the word ''atheist'' lived in the 18th century during the [[Age of Enlightenment]].{{sfn|Armstrong|1999}}&lt;ref name="Hunter ch 1" /&gt; The [[French Revolution]], noted for its "unprecedented atheism," witnessed the first major political movement in history to advocate for the supremacy of human [[reason]].&lt;ref name="HancockLambert"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hancock |first=Ralph |title=The Legacy of the French Revolution |year=1996 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield Publishers |location=Lanham, United States |isbn=978-0-847-67842-6 |page=22 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPgQy3VJ3iIC |accessdate=2015-05-30}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=uPgQy3VJ3iIC&amp;pg=PA22 Extract of page 22]&lt;/ref&gt; The French Revolution can be described as the first period where atheism became implemented politically.

Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches. Rationales for not believing in deities include arguments that there is a lack of [[Existence of God#Empirical arguments|empirical evidence]],&lt;ref name="logical" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://shook.pragmatism.org/skepticismaboutthesupernatural.pdf |title=Skepticism about the Supernatural |last=Shook |first=John R. |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[problem of evil]], the [[argument from inconsistent revelations]], the rejection of concepts that cannot [[Falsifiability|be falsified]], and the [[argument from nonbelief]].&lt;ref name="logical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drange-1996" /&gt; Nonbelievers contend that atheism is a more [[parsimonious]] position than theism and that everyone is born without beliefs in deities;&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-def-issues" /&gt; therefore, they argue that the [[Philosophic burden of proof|burden of proof]] lies not on the atheist to disprove the existence of gods but on the theist to provide a rationale for theism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stenger|2007|pp=17–18}}, citing {{cite book |last=Parsons |first=Keith M. |title=God and the Burden of Proof: Plantinga, Swinburne, and the Analytical Defense of Theism |year=1989 |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-0-879-75551-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some atheists have adopted [[Secularism|secular]] philosophies (e.g. [[secular humanism]]),&lt;ref name="honderich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fales |first=Evan |title=Naturalism and Physicalism |postscript=,}} in {{harvnb|Martin|2006|pp=122–131}}.&lt;/ref&gt; there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=3–4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions and types ==
[[File:AtheismImplicitExplicit3.svg|thumb|A diagram showing the relationship between the definitions of [[Weak and strong atheism|weak/strong]] and [[Implicit and explicit atheism|implicit/explicit]] atheism.
&lt;br /&gt;
Explicit strong/positive/hard atheists (in {{Font color|purple|'''purple'''}} on the '''right''') assert that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
&lt;br /&gt;
Explicit weak/negative/soft atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''right''') reject or eschew belief that any deities exist without actually asserting that ''"at least one deity exists"'' is a false statement.
&lt;br /&gt;
Implicit weak/negative atheists (in {{Font color|blue|'''blue'''}} on the '''left'''), according to authors such as George H. Smith, would include people (such as young children and some agnostics) who do not believe in a deity but have not explicitly rejected such belief.
&lt;br /&gt;

Writers disagree on how best to define and classify ''atheism'',&lt;ref name="eb1911-atheism" /&gt; contesting what supernatural entities are considered gods, whether it is a philosophic position in its own right or merely the absence of one, and whether it requires a conscious, explicit rejection. Atheism has been regarded as compatible with [[agnosticism]],&lt;ref name="agnosticism-compatible" /&gt;&lt;ref name="flint-agnostic-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyc-unbelief-compatible" /&gt;&lt;ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /&gt;&lt;ref name="barker-agnostic-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="besant-open-to-new-truth" /&gt;&lt;ref name="holyoake-question-of-probability" /&gt; and has also been contrasted with it.&lt;ref name="eb2011-atheism-critique" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eb2011concise-atheism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eb1911-atheism-sceptical" /&gt; A variety of categories have been used to distinguish the different forms of atheism.

=== Range ===
Some of the ambiguity and controversy involved in defining ''atheism'' arises from difficulty in reaching a consensus for the definitions of words like ''deity'' and ''god''. The plurality of wildly different [[conceptions of God]] and deities leads to differing ideas regarding atheism's applicability. The ancient Romans accused Christians of being atheists for not worshiping the [[paganism|pagan]] deities. Gradually, this view fell into disfavor as ''theism'' came to be understood as encompassing belief in any divinity.{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

With respect to the range of phenomena being rejected, atheism may counter anything from the existence of a deity, to the existence of any [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[supernatural]], or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] concepts, such as those of [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Taoism]].&lt;ref name="eb2011-Rejection-of-all-religious-beliefs" /&gt;

=== Implicit vs. explicit ===
{{Main|Implicit and explicit atheism}}
Definitions of atheism also vary in the degree of consideration a person must put to the idea of gods to be considered an atheist. Atheism has sometimes been defined to include the simple absence of belief that any deities exist. This broad definition would include newborns and other people who have not been exposed to theistic ideas. As far back as 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=Good Sense |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/7319 |year=1772 |accessdate=2011-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, [[George H. Smith]] (1979) suggested that: "The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Implicit atheism'' is "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it" and ''explicit atheism'' is the conscious rejection of belief.
For the purposes of his paper on "philosophical atheism", [[Ernest Nagel]] contested including mere absence of theistic belief as a type of atheism.&lt;ref name= Nagel1959&gt;{{cite book

I shall understand by "atheism" a critique and a denial of the major claims of all varieties of theism. &amp;nbsp;... atheism is not to be identified with sheer unbelief, or with disbelief in some particular creed of a religious group. Thus, a child who has received no religious instruction and has never heard about God, is not an atheist – for he is not denying any theistic claims. Similarly in the case of an adult who, if he has withdrawn from the faith of his father without reflection or because of frank indifference to any theological issue, is also not an atheist – for such an adult is not challenging theism and not professing any views on the subject. &amp;nbsp;...

&lt;br /&gt;reprinted in ''Critiques of God'', edited by Peter A. Angeles, Prometheus Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Graham Oppy]] classifies as ''innocents'' those who never considered the question because they lack any understanding of what a god is. According to Oppy, these could be [[Infant cognitive development|one-month-old babies]], humans with severe traumatic [[Brain injury|brain injuries]], or patients with [[dementia|advanced dementia]].{{sfn|Oppy|2018|p=4|ps=:Agnostics are distinguished from innocents, who also neither believe that there are gods nor believe that there are no gods, by the fact that they have given consideration to the question whether there are gods. Innocents are those who have never considered the question whether there are gods. Typically, innocents have never considered the question whether there are gods because they are not able to consider that question. How could that be? Well, in order to consider the question whether there are gods, one must understand what it would mean for something to be a god. That is, one needs to have the concept of a god. Those who lack the concept of a god are not able to entertain the thought that there are gods. Consider, for example, one-month-old babies. It is very plausible that one-month-old babies lack the concept of a god. So it is very plausible that one-month-old babies are innocents. Other plausible cases of innocents include chimpanzees, human beings who have suffered severe traumatic brain injuries, and human beings with advanced dementia}}

=== Positive vs. negative ===
{{Main|Negative and positive atheism}}
Philosophers such as [[Antony Flew]]&lt;ref name="presumption"&gt;{{harvnb|Flew|1976|pp=14ff}}: "In this interpretation an atheist becomes: not someone who positively asserts the non-existence of God; but someone who is simply not a theist. Let us, for future ready reference, introduce the labels 'positive atheist' for the former and 'negative atheist' for the latter."&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]]{{sfn|Martin|2006}} have contrasted positive (strong/hard) atheism with negative (weak/soft) atheism. Positive atheism is the explicit affirmation that gods do not exist. Negative atheism includes all other forms of non-theism. According to this categorization, anyone who is not a theist is either a negative or a positive atheist.
The terms ''weak'' and ''strong'' are relatively recent, while the terms ''negative'' and ''positive'' atheism are of older origin, having been used (in slightly different ways) in the philosophical literature&lt;ref name="presumption" /&gt; and in Catholic apologetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |title=On the Meaning of Contemporary Atheism |journal=The Review of Politics |first=Jacques |last=Maritain |date=July 1949 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=267–280 |doi=10.1017/S0034670500044168 |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051113062053/http://www.nd.edu/Departments/Maritain/jm3303.htm |archivedate=13 November 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Under this demarcation of atheism, most agnostics qualify as negative atheists.

While Martin, for example, asserts that agnosticism [[logical consequence|entails]] negative atheism,&lt;ref name="martin-agnosticism-entails" /&gt; many agnostics see their view as distinct from atheism,&lt;ref name=Kenny2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/omar-baddar/why-im-not-an-atheist-the-case-for-agnosticism_b_3345544.html | title=Why I'm Not an Atheist: The Case for Agnosticism |date=28 May 2013 |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which they may consider no more justified than theism or requiring an equal conviction.&lt;ref name=Kenny2006&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Kenny |authorlink=Anthony Kenny |title=What I believe |chapter=Why I Am Not an Atheist |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-0-82648971-5 |quote=The true default position is neither theism nor atheism, but agnosticism&amp;nbsp;... a claim to knowledge needs to be substantiated; ignorance need only be confessed. |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The assertion of unattainability of knowledge for or against the existence of gods is sometimes seen as an indication that atheism requires a [[leap of faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Many atheists I know would be certain of a high place in heaven |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |last=O'Brien |first=Breda |authorlink=Breda O'Brien |work=Irish Times |accessdate=2011-04-09 |date=7 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520132651/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0725/1224251303564.html |archivedate=20 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Warner |first=Matthew |url=http://www.ncregister.com/blog/matthew-warner/more-faith-to-be-an-atheist-than-a-christian |title=More faith to be an atheist than a Christian |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Common atheist responses to this argument include that unproven ''[[faith#Faith in world religions|religious]]'' propositions deserve as much disbelief as all ''other'' unproven propositions,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|pp=30–34}}. "Who seriously claims we should say 'I neither believe nor disbelieve that the Pope is a robot', or 'As to whether or not eating this piece of chocolate will turn me into an elephant I am completely agnostic'. In the absence of any good reasons to believe these outlandish claims, we rightly disbelieve them, we don't just suspend judgement."&lt;/ref&gt;
and that the unprovability of a god's existence does not imply equal probability of either possibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=22}}. "A lack of proof is no grounds for the suspension of belief. This is because when we have a lack of absolute proof we can still have overwhelming evidence or one explanation which is far superior to the alternatives."&lt;/ref&gt;
Australian philosopher [[J. J. C. Smart]] even argues that "sometimes a person who is really an atheist may describe herself, even passionately, as an agnostic because of unreasonable generalized [[philosophical skepticism]] which would preclude us from saying that we know anything whatever, except perhaps the truths of mathematics and formal logic."&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/ |title=Atheism and Agnosticism |first=J.C.C. |last=Smart |date=9 March 2004 |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, some atheist authors such as [[Richard Dawkins]] prefer distinguishing theist, agnostic and atheist positions along a [[spectrum of theistic probability]]—the likelihood that each assigns to the statement "God exists".{{sfn|Dawkins|2006|p=50}}

=== Definition as impossible or impermanent ===
Before the 18th century, the existence of God was so accepted in the western world that even the possibility of true atheism was questioned. This is called ''theistic [[innatism]]''—the notion that all people believe in God from birth; within this view was the connotation that atheists are simply in denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cudworth |first=Ralph |authorlink=Ralph Cudworth |title=The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the first part, wherein all the reason and philosophy of atheism is confuted and its impossibility demonstrated |year=1678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a position claiming that atheists are quick to believe in God in times of crisis, that atheists make [[deathbed conversion]]s, or that "there are no [[atheists in foxholes]]".&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: {{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/features/ohair090896.htm |title=Atheist Group Moves Ahead Without O'Hair |first=Sue Anne |last=Pressley |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=8 September 1996 |accessdate=2014-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There have however been examples to the contrary, among them examples of literal "atheists in foxholes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lowder |first=Jeffery Jay |year=1997 |title=Atheism and Society |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html |accessdate=2011-04-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522025011/http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/jeff_lowder/society.html |archivedate=22 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some atheists have doubted the very need for the term "atheism". In his book ''[[Letter to a Christian Nation]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In fact, "atheism" is a term that should not even exist. No one ever needs to identify himself as a "non-[[Astrology|astrologer]]" or a "non-[[Alchemy|alchemist]]". We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and their cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.{{sfn|Harris|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=ypyMZlkgHGIC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=%22No+one+ever+needs+to+identify+himself+as+a+%22non-astrologer%22%22or+a%22%22non-alchemist%22 51]}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pragmatic atheism===
Pragmatic atheism is the view one should reject a belief in a god or gods because it is unnecessary for a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] life. This view is related to [[apatheism]] and [[practical atheism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://atheism.about.com/od/Atheist-Dictionary/g/Definition-Pragmatic-Atheist.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments ==
[[File:D'Holbach.jpg|thumb|[[Baron d'Holbach|Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach]], an 18th-century advocate of atheism.
&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
"The source of man's unhappiness is his ignorance of Nature. The pertinacity with which he clings to blind opinions imbibed in his infancy, which interweave themselves with his existence, the consequent prejudice that warps his mind, that prevents its expansion, that renders him the slave of fiction, appears to doom him to continual error."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Henri Thiry, Baron d'Holbach, ''System of Nature; or, the Laws of the Moral and Physical World'' (London, 1797), Vol. 1, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;]]

=== Epistemological arguments ===
{{Further|Agnostic atheism|Theological noncognitivism}}
Atheists have also argued that people cannot know a God or prove the existence of a God.  The latter is called agnosticism, which takes a variety of forms. In the philosophy of [[immanence]], divinity is inseparable from the world itself, including a person's mind, and each person's [[consciousness]] is locked in the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject]]. According to this form of agnosticism, this limitation in perspective prevents any objective inference from belief in a god to assertions of its existence. The [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] agnosticism of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] only accepts knowledge deduced with human rationality; this form of atheism holds that gods are not discernible as a matter of principle, and therefore cannot be known to exist. [[Skepticism]], based on the ideas of [[David Hume|Hume]], asserts that certainty about anything is impossible, so one can never know for sure whether or not a god exists. Hume, however, held that such unobservable metaphysical concepts should be rejected as "sophistry and illusion".&lt;ref name="hume-metaphysics" /&gt; The allocation of agnosticism to atheism is disputed; it can also be regarded as an independent, basic worldview.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka-p20"&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other arguments for atheism that can be classified as epistemological or [[ontology|ontological]], including  [[ignosticism]], assert the meaninglessness or unintelligibility of basic terms such as "God" and statements such as "God is all-powerful." [[Theological noncognitivism]] holds that the statement "God exists" does not express a proposition, but is nonsensical or cognitively meaningless. It has been argued both ways as to whether such individuals can be classified into some form of atheism or agnosticism. Philosophers [[Alfred Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] and [[Theodore M. Drange]] reject both categories, stating that both camps accept "God exists" as a proposition; they instead place noncognitivism in its own category.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Drange|Drange, Theodore M.]] (1998). "[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/definition.html Atheism, Agnosticism, Noncognitivism]". [[Internet Infidels]], ''Secular Web Library''. Retrieved 2007-APR-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Ayer|Ayer, A. J.]] (1946). ''Language, Truth and Logic''. Dover. pp. 115–116. In a footnote, Ayer attributes this view to "Professor H. H. Price".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Metaphysical arguments ===
{{Further|Monism|Physicalism}}
Philosopher, [[Zofia Zdybicka]] writes:
{{quote|"Metaphysical atheism&amp;nbsp;... includes all doctrines that hold to metaphysical monism (the homogeneity of reality). Metaphysical atheism may be either: a) absolute — an explicit denial of God's existence associated with materialistic monism (all materialistic trends, both in ancient and modern times); b) relative — the implicit denial of God in all philosophies that, while they accept the existence of an absolute, conceive of the absolute as not possessing any of the attributes proper to God: transcendence, a personal character or unity. Relative atheism is associated with idealistic monism (pantheism, panentheism, deism)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Epikouros BM 1843.jpg|thumb|left|[[Epicurus]] is credited with first expounding the [[problem of evil]]. [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues concerning Natural Religion]]'' (1779) cited Epicurus in stating the argument as a series of questions:{{sfn|Hume|1779}}
"Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is impotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"]]

=== Logical arguments ===
{{further|Existence of God#Arguments against the existence of God|l1=Arguments against the existence of God|Problem of evil|Argument from nonbelief|l3=Divine hiddenness}}
Some atheists hold the view that the various [[conceptions of God|conceptions of gods]], such as the [[personal god]] of Christianity, are ascribed logically inconsistent qualities. Such atheists present [[existence of God#Deductive arguments|deductive arguments]] against the existence of God, which assert the incompatibility between certain traits, such as perfection, creator-status, [[immutability (theology)|immutability]], [[omniscience]], [[omnipresence]], [[omnipotence]], [[omnibenevolence]], [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendence]], personhood (a personal being), nonphysicality, [[justice]], and [[mercy]].&lt;ref name=logical&gt;{{cite web |author=Various authors |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/logical.html |title=Logical Arguments for Atheism |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] |website=The Secular Web Library |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Theodicy|Theodicean]] atheists believe that the world as they experience it cannot be reconciled with the qualities commonly ascribed to God and gods by theologians. They argue that an [[omniscience|omniscient]], [[omnipotence|omnipotent]], and [[omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] God is not compatible with a world where there is [[problem of evil|evil]] and [[suffering]], and where divine love is [[Divine hiddenness|hidden]] from many people.&lt;ref name="Drange-1996"&gt;{{cite web |first=Theodore M. |last=Drange |authorlink=Theodore Drange |year=1996 |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/aeanb.html |title=The Arguments From Evil and Nonbelief |publisher=[[Internet Infidels]] |website=Secular Web Library |accessdate=2012-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A similar argument is attributed to [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;V.A. Gunasekara, {{cite web |url=http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm |title=The Buddhist Attitude to God |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102053643/http://www.buddhistinformation.com/buddhist_attitude_to_god.htm |archivedate=2 January 2008}} In the Bhuridatta Jataka, "The Buddha argues that the three most commonly given attributes of God, viz. omnipotence, omniscience and benevolence towards humanity cannot all be mutually compatible with the existential fact of dukkha."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reductionary accounts of religion ===
{{Further|Evolutionary origin of religions|Evolutionary psychology of religion|Psychology of religion}}
Philosopher [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]&lt;ref&gt;Feuerbach, Ludwig (1841) ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
and psychoanalyst [[Sigmund Freud]] have argued that God and other religious beliefs are human inventions, created to fulfill various psychological and emotional wants or needs. This is also a view of many [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, ''What the Buddha Taught.'' Grove Press, 1974. Pages 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], influenced by the work of Feuerbach, argued that belief in God and religion are social functions, used by those in power to oppress the working class. According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], "the idea of God implies the abdication of human reason and justice; it is the most decisive negation of human liberty, and necessarily ends in the enslavement of mankind, in theory and practice." He reversed [[Voltaire]]'s famous aphorism that if God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him, writing instead that "if God really existed, it would be necessary to abolish him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |title=God and the State |last=Bakunin |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Bakunin |year=1916 |website= |publisher=New York: Mother Earth Publishing Association |accessdate=2011-04-09 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521195435/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Archives/bakunin/godandstate/godandstate_ch1.html |archivedate=21 May 2011  |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atheistic philosophies ==
{{Further|Atheist existentialism|Secular humanism}}
[[Axiology|Axiological]], or constructive, atheism rejects the existence of gods in favor of a "higher absolute", such as [[Human nature|humanity]]. This form of atheism favors humanity as the absolute source of ethics and values, and permits individuals to resolve moral problems without resorting to God. Marx and Freud used this argument to convey messages of liberation, full-development, and unfettered happiness.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka-p20" /&gt; One of the most common [[criticism of atheism|criticisms of atheism]] has been to the contrary: that denying the existence of a god either leads to [[moral relativism]] and leaves one with no moral or ethical foundation,&lt;ref name="misconceptions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.exchristian.net/2006/12/common-misconceptions-about-atheists.html |title=Common Misconceptions About Atheists and Atheism |last=Gleeson |first=David |date=10 August 2006 |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or renders life [[meaning of life (religious)|meaningless]] and miserable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Perhaps the most common criticism of atheism is the claim that it leads inevitably to [[moral bankruptcy]]."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]] argued this view in his ''[[Pensées]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Blaise Pascal|Pascal, Blaise]] (1669). ''[[Pensées]]'', II: "The Misery of Man Without God".&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] identified himself as a representative of an "[[atheist existentialism]]"{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
concerned less with denying the existence of God than with establishing that "man needs&amp;nbsp;... to find himself again and to understand that nothing can save him from himself, not even a valid proof of the existence of God."{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=45}}
Sartre said a corollary of his atheism was that "if God does not exist, there is at least one being in whom existence precedes essence, a being who exists before he can be defined by any concept, and&amp;nbsp;... this being is man."{{sfn|Sartre|2004|p=127}}
The practical consequence of this atheism was described by Sartre as meaning that there are no ''a priori rules'' or absolute values that can be invoked to govern human conduct, and that humans are "condemned" to invent these for themselves, making "man" absolutely "responsible for everything he does".{{sfn|Sartre|2001|p=32}}

=== Association with world views and social behaviors ===
Sociologist [[Phil Zuckerman]] analyzed previous social science research on secularity and non-belief, and concluded that societal well-being is positively correlated with irreligion. He found that there are much lower concentrations of atheism and secularity in poorer, less developed nations (particularly in Africa and South America) than in the richer industrialized democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Norris |first=Pippa |first2=Ronald |last2=Inglehart |year=2004 |title=Sacred and Secular: Religion and Politics Worldwide |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Steve |year=2003 |title=Religion and Politics |location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Irreligion ===
[[File:Lightmatter buddha3.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Buddhism]] is sometimes described as nontheistic because of [[God in Buddhism|the absence]] of a [[creator god]], but that can be too simplistic a view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=B.

The strictest sense of positive atheism does not entail any specific beliefs outside of disbelief in any deity; as such, atheists can hold any number of spiritual beliefs. For the same reason, atheists can hold a wide variety of ethical beliefs, ranging from the [[moral universalism]] of [[humanism]], which holds that a moral code should be applied consistently to all humans, to [[moral nihilism]], which holds that morality is meaningless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|pp=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atheism is accepted as a valid philosophical position within some varieties of [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Chakravarti| first = Sitansu| title = Hinduism, a way of life| publisher = Motilal Banarsidass Publ.| year = 1991| page = 71| url = https://books.google.com/?id=J_-rASTgw8wC&amp;pg=PA71| isbn = 978-81-208-0899-7|quote = According to Hinduism, the path of the atheist is very difficult to follow in matters of spirituality, though it is a valid one. |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers such as [[Slavoj Žižek]],&lt;ref&gt;Slavoj Žižek: Less Than Nothing (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alain de Botton]],&lt;ref&gt;Alain de Botton: [[Religion for Atheists]] (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Bard]] and [[Jan Söderqvist]],&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Bard and Jan Söderqvist: The Global Empire (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; have all argued that atheists should reclaim religion as an act of defiance against theism, precisely not to leave religion as an unwarranted monopoly to theists.

=== Divine command ===
According to Plato's [[Euthyphro dilemma]], the role of the gods in determining right from wrong is either unnecessary or arbitrary. [[Divine command theory|The argument that morality must be derived from God]], and cannot exist without a wise creator, has been a persistent feature of political if not so much philosophical debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1979|p=275}}. "Among the many myths associated with religion, none is more widespread -{{sic}}or more disastrous in its effects—than the myth that moral values cannot be divorced from the belief in a god."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In [[Dostoevsky]]'s ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'' (Book Eleven: ''Brother Ivan Fyodorovich'', Chapter 4) there is the famous argument that ''If there is no God, all things are permitted.'': "'But what will become of men then?' I asked him, 'without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?'"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kant CPR A811"&gt;For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], the presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was a practical concern, for "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in such a world, which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams&amp;nbsp;..." (''Critique of Pure Reason'', A811).&lt;/ref&gt;
Moral precepts such as "murder is wrong" are seen as [[divine law]]s, requiring a divine lawmaker and judge. However, many atheists argue that treating morality legalistically involves a [[false analogy]], and that morality does not depend on a lawmaker in the same way that laws do.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] believed in a morality independent of theistic belief, and stated that morality based upon God "has truth only if God is truth—it stands or falls with faith in God."&lt;ref name="Fortin &amp; Benestad"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=19ccmx1W58IC&amp;pg=PA16|title =Human Rights, Virtue, and the Common Good|publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|quote=That problem was brought home to us with dazzling clarity by Nietzsche, who had reflected more deeply than any of his contemporaries on the implications of godlessness and come to the conclusion that a fatal contradiction lay at the heart of modern theological enterprise: it thought that Christian morality, which it wished to preserve, was independent of Christian dogma, which it rejected. This, in Nietzsche's mind, was an absurdity. It amounted to nothing less than dismissing the architect while trying to keep the building or getting rid of the lawgiver while claiming the protection of the law. | accessdate=2011-04-09|isbn = 978-0-8476-8279-9|year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Craig &amp; Moreland"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=g8bHRrVu3SsC&amp;pg=PA392|title =The Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology|publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell]]|quote=Morality "has truth only if God is truth–it stands or falls with faith in God" (Nietzsche 1968, p. 70).

There exist [[Normative ethics|normative ethical systems]] that do not require principles and rules to be given by a deity. Some include [[virtue ethics]], [[social contract]], [[Kantian ethics]], [[utilitarianism]], and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] has proposed that moral prescription (ethical rule making) is not just an issue to be explored by philosophy, but that we can meaningfully practice a [[science of morality]].

and [[Julian Baggini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(among others) assert that behaving ethically only because of divine mandate is not true ethical behavior but merely blind obedience. Baggini argues that atheism is a superior basis for ethics, claiming that a moral basis external to religious imperatives is necessary to evaluate the morality of the imperatives themselves—to be able to discern, for example, that "thou shalt steal" is immoral even if one's religion instructs it—and that atheists, therefore, have the advantage of being more inclined to make such evaluations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baggini|2003|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The contemporary British political philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] has offered the more historically telling example of Biblical injunctions in favor of torture and slavery as evidence of how religious injunctions follow political and social customs, rather than vice versa, but also noted that the same tendency seems to be true of supposedly dispassionate and objective philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;101 Ethical Dilemmas, 2nd edition, by Cohen, M., Routledge 2007, pp&amp;nbsp;184–5. (Cohen notes particularly that Plato and Aristotle produced arguments in favour of slavery.)&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen extends this argument in more detail in ''Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao'', where he argues that the [[Qur'an]] played a role in perpetuating social codes from the early 7th century despite changes in secular society.&lt;ref&gt;Political Philosophy from Plato to Mao, by Cohen, M, Second edition 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Marx]]]]

The 19th-century German political theorist and sociologist Karl Marx called religion "the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]". He goes on to say, "The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is the demand for their real happiness. To call on them to give up their illusions about their condition is to call on them to give up a condition that requires illusions. The criticism of religion is, therefore, in embryo, the criticism of that vale of tears of which religion is the halo."&lt;ref&gt;Marx, K. 1976. Introduction to A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right. Collected Works, v. 3. New York.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] said that "every religious idea and every idea of God is unutterable vileness&amp;nbsp;... of the most dangerous kind, 'contagion' of the most abominable kind.

[[File:Ephesians 2,12 - Greek atheos.jpg|thumb|left|The Greek word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}} (''atheoi''), as it appears in the [[Epistle to the Ephesians]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|2:12}}) on the early 3rd-century [[Papyrus 46]]. It is usually translated into English as "[those who are] without God".&lt;ref&gt;The word {{lang|grc|αθεοι}}—in any of its forms—appears nowhere else in the [[Septuagint]] or the [[New Testament]]. {{cite book |last=Robertson |first=A.T. |title=Word Pictures in the New Testament |origyear=1932 |year=1960 |publisher=Broadman Press |chapter=Ephesians: Chapter 2 |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/r/robertson_at/wordpictures/htm/EPH2.RWP.html |quote=Old Greek word, not in LXX, only here in N.T.

In early [[ancient Greek]], the adjective ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' ({{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]]}}, from the [[privative a|privative ἀ-]] + {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:θεός|θεός]]}} "god") meant "godless". It was first used as a term of censure roughly meaning "ungodly" or "impious". In the 5th century BCE, the word began to indicate more deliberate and active godlessness in the sense of "severing relations with the gods" or "denying the gods". The term [[:wikt:ἀσεβής|ἀσεβής]] (''{{Transl|grc|asebēs}}'') then came to be applied against those who impiously denied or disrespected the local gods, even if they believed in other gods. Modern translations of classical texts sometimes render ''{{Transl|grc|átheos}}'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also {{lang|grc|[[:wikt:ἀθεότης|ἀθεότης]]}} (''{{Transl|grc|atheotēs}}''), "atheism".

Cudworth, Ralph. The true intellectual system of the universe. 1678. Chapter V Section II p.73&lt;/ref&gt;
At that time "deist" and "deism" already carried their modern meaning. The term ''theism'' came to be contrasted with deism.

[[Karen Armstrong]] writes that "During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was still reserved exclusively for [[polemic]]&amp;nbsp;... The term 'atheist' was an insult. Nobody would have dreamed of calling ''himself'' an atheist."{{sfn|Armstrong|1999}}

''Atheism'' was first used to describe a self-avowed belief in late 18th-century Europe, specifically denoting disbelief in the [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[Abrahamic god]].&lt;ref name="adevism"&gt;In part because of its wide use in monotheistic Western society, ''atheism'' is usually described as "disbelief in God", rather than more generally as "disbelief in deities". A clear distinction is rarely drawn in modern writings between these two definitions, but some archaic uses of ''atheism'' encompassed only disbelief in the singular God, not in [[polytheism|polytheistic]] deities. It is on this basis that the obsolete term ''[[adevism]]'' was coined in the late 19th century to describe an absence of belief in plural deities.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the 20th century, [[globalization]] contributed to the expansion of the term to refer to disbelief in all deities, though it remains common in Western society to describe atheism as simply "disbelief in God".{{sfn|Martin|2006}}

{{Main|History of atheism}}
While the earliest-found usage of the term ''atheism'' is in 16th-century [[France]],&lt;ref name="mw-online"&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/atheism | title=Merriam-Webster Online:Atheism | quote=First Known Use: 1546 | accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Golding /&gt; ideas that would be recognized today as atheistic are documented from the [[Vedic period]] and the [[classical antiquity]].

{{Main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
Atheistic schools are found in early Indian thought and have existed from the times of the [[historical Vedic religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pandian |title=India, that is, sidd |publisher=Allied Publishers |year=1996 |page=64 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=B90uj14NHjMC&amp;pg=PA64 |isbn=978-8-170-23561-3 |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the six [[Astika and Nastika|orthodox]] schools of Hindu philosophy, [[Samkhya]], the oldest philosophical school of thought, does not accept God, and the early [[Mimamsa]] also rejected the notion of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dasgupta |first=Surendranath |title=A history of Indian philosophy, Volume 1 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1992 |page=258 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PoaMFmS1_lEC&amp;pg=PA258 |isbn=978-8-120-80412-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The thoroughly materialistic and anti-theistic philosophical [[Cārvāka]] (or ''Lokāyata'') school that originated in [[India]] around the 6th century BCE is probably the most explicitly atheistic school of philosophy in India, similar to the Greek [[Cyrenaic school]]. This branch of Indian philosophy is classified as [[nastika|heterodox]] due to its rejection of the authority of [[Vedas]] and hence is not considered part of the six orthodox schools of Hinduism, but it is noteworthy as evidence of a materialistic movement within Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore. ''A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy''. (Princeton University Press: 1957, Twelfth Princeton Paperback printing 1989) pp. 227–249. {{ISBN|0-69101958-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Chatterjee and Datta explain that our understanding of Cārvāka philosophy is fragmentary, based largely on criticism of the ideas by other schools, and that it is not a living tradition:&lt;ref&gt;Satischandra Chatterjee and Dhirendramohan Datta. ''An Introduction to Indian Philosophy''. Eighth Reprint Edition. (University of Calcutta: 1984). p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|Though [[materialism]] in some form or other has always been present in India, and occasional references are found in the Vedas, the Buddhistic literature, the Epics, as well as in the later philosophical works we do not find any systematic work on materialism, nor any organized school of followers as the other philosophical schools possess. But almost every work of the other schools states, for refutation, the materialistic views. Our knowledge of Indian materialism is chiefly based on these.}}

Other Indian philosophies generally regarded as atheistic include [[Samkhya|Classical Samkhya]] and [[Mimamsa|Purva Mimamsa]]. The rejection of a personal creator God is also seen in [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] in India.&lt;ref name="Joshi"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Joshi |first=L.R. |year=1966 |title=A New Interpretation of Indian Atheism |journal=Philosophy East and West |volume=16 |issue=3/4 |pages=189–206 |doi=10.2307/1397540 |ref=harv |jstor=1397540}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early Middle Ages to the Renaissance ===
During the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Islamic world]] experienced a [[Islamic Golden Age|Golden Age]].  Along with advances in science and philosophy, Arab and Persian lands produced outspoken rationalists and atheists, including [[Muhammad al Warraq]] (fl. 9th century), [[Ibn al-Rawandi]] (827–911), [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Al-Razi]] (854–925), and [[Al-Maʿarri]] (973–1058).  Al-Ma'arri wrote and taught that religion itself was a "fable invented by the ancients"&lt;ref name="Nicholson318"&gt;Reynold Alleyne Nicholson, 1962, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', page 318.

In Europe, the espousal of atheistic views was rare during the Early Middle Ages and [[Middle Ages]] (see [[Medieval Inquisition]]); [[metaphysics]] and theology were the dominant interests pertaining to religion.&lt;ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, movements within this period that furthered heterodox conceptions of the Christian god, including differing views of the nature, transcendence, and knowability of God. Individuals and groups such as [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], [[David of Dinant]], [[Amalric of Bena]], and the [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]] maintained Christian viewpoints with [[pantheism|pantheistic]] tendencies.  [[Nicholas of Cusa]] held to a form of [[fideism]] he called ''[[De Docta Ignorantia|docta ignorantia]]'' ("learned ignorance"), asserting that God is beyond human categorization, and thus our knowledge of him is limited to conjecture. [[William of Ockham]] inspired anti-metaphysical tendencies with his [[nominalism|nominalistic]] limitation of human knowledge to singular objects, and asserted that the divine [[essence]] could not be intuitively or rationally apprehended by human intellect. Followers of Ockham, such as [[John of Mirecourt]] and [[Nicholas of Autrecourt]] furthered this view. The resulting division between [[Faith and rationality|faith and reason]] influenced later radical and reformist theologians such as [[John Wycliffe]], [[Jan Hus]], and [[Martin Luther]].&lt;ref name="Zdybicka 2005 4" /&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] did much to expand the scope of free thought and skeptical inquiry. Individuals such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] sought experimentation as a means of explanation, and opposed [[Appeal to authority|arguments from religious authority]].  Other critics of religion and the Church during this time included [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Bonaventure des Périers]], [[Michel de Montaigne]], and [[François Rabelais]].&lt;ref name="gordonstein" /&gt;

=== Early modern period ===
Historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn "quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.388&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deism]] gained influence in France, Prussia, and England. The philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] was "probably the first well known 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era", according to Blainey. Spinoza believed that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his ''Short Treatise on God''.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.343&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Criticism of Christianity]] became increasingly frequent in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and England, where there appears to have been a religious [[malaise]], according to contemporary sources. Some Protestant thinkers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]], espoused a materialist philosophy and skepticism toward supernatural occurrences, while Spinoza rejected [[divine providence]] in favor of a [[panentheistic]] naturalism. By the late 17th century, deism came to be openly espoused by intellectuals such as [[John Toland (Irish Philosopher)|John Toland]] who coined the term "pantheist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pantheism |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known explicit atheist was the German critic of religion [[Matthias Knutzen]] in his three writings of 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Winfried Schröder, in: Matthias Knutzen: Schriften und Materialien (2010), p. 8. See also Rececca Moore, ''The Heritage of Western Humanism, Scepticism and Freethought'' (2011), calling Knutzen "the first open advocate of a modern atheist perspective" [http://reason.sdsu.edu/germany.html online here]&lt;/ref&gt; He was followed by two other explicit atheist writers, the Polish ex-Jesuit philosopher [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]] and in the 1720s by the French priest [[Jean Meslier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nova.wpunj.edu/newpolitics/issue40/Onfray40.htm |title=Michel Onfray on Jean Meslier |publisher=William Paterson University |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the 18th century, other openly atheistic thinkers followed, such as [[Baron d'Holbach]], [[Jacques-André Naigeon]], and other [[French materialism|French materialists]].&lt;ref name="Holbach-SoN"&gt;{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=The System of Nature |url=http://fulltextarchive.com/page/The-System-of-Nature-Vol-21/ |accessdate=2011-04-07 |year=1770 |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]] in contrast, though an advocate of tolerance, urged authorities not to tolerate atheism, believing that the denial of God's existence would undermine the social order and lead to chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Waldron]]; ''God, Locke, and Equality: Christian Foundations in Locke's Political Thought''; Cambridge, UK; 2002; p.217&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[David Hume]] developed a skeptical epistemology grounded in [[empiricism]], and [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy has strongly questioned the very possibility of a metaphysical knowledge. Both philosophers undermined the metaphysical basis of natural theology and criticized classical [[arguments for the existence of God]].

[[File:Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' (1841) would greatly influence philosophers such as [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[David Strauss]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[Max Stirner]]. He considered God to be a human invention and religious activities to be wish-fulfillment. For this he is considered the founding father of modern [[anthropology of religion]].]]
Blainey notes that, although [[Voltaire]] is widely considered to have strongly contributed to atheistic thinking during the Revolution, he also considered fear of God to have discouraged further disorder, having said "If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him."&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.&amp;nbsp;390–391&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]'' (1790), the philosopher [[Edmund Burke]] denounced atheism, writing of a "literary cabal" who had "some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety&amp;nbsp;... These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own&amp;nbsp;...".  But, Burke asserted, "man is by his constitution a religious animal" and "atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and&amp;nbsp;... it cannot prevail long".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/b/burke/edmund/reflections-on-the-revolution-in-france/|title=Reflections on the Revolution in France|website=adelaide.edu.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Baron d'Holbach]] was a prominent figure in the [[French Enlightenment]] who is best known for his atheism and for his voluminous writings against religion, the most famous of them being ''[[The System of Nature]]'' (1770) but also ''[[Christianity Unveiled]]''. One goal of the [[French Revolution]] was a restructuring and subordination of the clergy with respect to the state through the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]]. Attempts to enforce it led to [[anticlericalism|anti-clerical]] violence and the expulsion of many clergy from France, lasting until the [[Thermidorian Reaction]]. The radical [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]] seized power in 1793, ushering in the [[Reign of Terror]]. The Jacobins were deists and introduced the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] as a new French state religion. Some atheists surrounding [[Jacques Hébert]] instead sought to establish a [[Cult of Reason]], a form of atheistic pseudo-religion with a goddess personifying reason. The [[Napoleonic era]] further institutionalized the secularization of French society.

In the latter half of the 19th century, atheism rose to prominence under the influence of [[rationalism|rationalistic]] and [[freethought|freethinking]] philosophers. Many prominent German philosophers of this era denied the existence of deities and were critical of religion, including [[Ludwig Andreas Feuerbach|Ludwig Feuerbach]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Karl Marx]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BKz2FcDrFy0C&amp;pg=PA1 |title=Subjectivity and Irreligion: Atheism and Agnosticism in Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche |publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |last=Ray |first=Matthew Alun |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-754-63456-0 |accessdate=2011-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Further|Marxism and religion}}
Atheism, particularly in the form of practical atheism, advanced in many societies in the 20th century. Atheistic thought found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies, such as [[existentialism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|objectivism]], [[secular humanism]], [[nihilism]], [[anarchism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[feminism]],&lt;ref name=feminism&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tAeFipOVx4MC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=%22Feminism+and+Atheism%22 |last=Overall |first=Christine |chapter=Feminism and Atheism |year=2006 |accessdate=2011-04-09 |title=The Cambridge Companion to Atheism |isbn=978-1-139-82739-3}} in {{harvnb|Martin|2006|pp=233–246}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the general scientific and [[rationalist movement]].

[[File:Honourable Bertrand Russell.jpg|thumb|upright|The British philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]]]
Logical positivism and [[scientism]] paved the way for [[neopositivism]], [[analytical philosophy]], [[structuralism]], and [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]]. Neopositivism and analytical philosophy discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[A. J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. Relatedly the [[Structural anthropology|applied structuralism]] of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious in denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] and [[J. J. C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. Naturalists and materialistic monists such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.&lt;ref name="stanford" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zdybicka|2005|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2010 Eurobarometer Poll, the percentage of those polled who agreed with the statement "you don't believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force" varied from a high percentage in France (40%), Czech Republic (37%), Sweden (34%), Netherlands (30%), and Estonia (29%); medium-high percentage in Germany (27%), Belgium (27%), UK (25%); to very low in Poland (5%), Greece (4%), Cyprus (3%), Malta (2%), and Romania (1%), with the European Union as a whole at 20%.&lt;ref name="EU" /&gt; In a 2012 Eurobarometer poll on discrimination in the European Union, 16% of those polled considered themselves non believers/agnostics and 7% considered themselves atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discrimination in the EU in 2012 |work=[[Eurobarometer|Special Eurobarometer]] |year=2012 |series=383 |page=233 |url=http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |accessdate=14 August 2013 |publisher=[[European Commission]] |location=[[European Union]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202023700/http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_393_en.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 |df= }} The question asked was "Do you consider yourself to be...?", with a card showing: Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Other Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Sikh, Buddhist, Hindu, Atheist, and non-believer/agnostic.

According to a [[Pew Research Center]] survey in 2012 [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]] (including agnostics and atheists) make up about 18% of Europeans.&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewforum.org/global-religious-landscape-unaffiliated.aspx|title=Religiously Unaffiliated|date=18 December 2012|website=Pew Research Center's Religion &amp; Public Life Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same survey, the religiously unaffiliated are the majority of the population only in two European countries: Czech Republic (75%) and Estonia (60%).&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated" /&gt;

===Asia===
There are another four countries where the unaffiliated make up a majority of the population: [[Irreligion in North Korea|North Korea]] (71%), [[Religion in Japan#Thoughts and movements against organised religion|Japan]] (57%), Hong Kong (56%), and China (52%).&lt;ref name="Religiously Unaffiliated" /&gt;

===Australasia===
According to the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], 30% of Australians have "no religion", a category that includes atheists.&lt;ref name="abs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/mediareleasesbyReleaseDate/7E65A144540551D7CA258148000E2B85?OpenDocument |title=Religion In Australia |date=27 June 2017 |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Statistics]] |accessdate=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

According to the [[World Values Survey]], 4.4% of Americans self-identified as atheists in 2014.&lt;ref name="WVS"&gt;{{cite web|title=WVS Database|url=http://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSOnline.jsp|website=World Values Survey|publisher=Institute for Comparative Survey Research|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same survey showed that 11.1% of all respondents stated "no" when asked if they believed in God.&lt;ref name="WVS"/&gt; In 1984, these same figures were 1.1% and 2.2%, respectively. According to a 2014 report by the Pew Research Center, 3.1% of the US adult population identify as atheist, up from 1.6% in 2007; and within the religiously unaffiliated (or "no religion") demographic, atheists made up 13.6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ America’s Changing Religious Landscape], Pew Research Center, 12 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2015 General Sociological Survey the number of atheists and agnostics in the US has remained relatively flat in the past 23 years since in 1991 only 2% identified as atheist and 4% identified as agnostic and in 2014 only 3% identified as atheists and 5% identified as agnostics.&lt;ref name="GSS 2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hout |first1=Michael |last2=Smith |first2=Tom |title=Fewer Americans Affiliate with Organized Religions, Belief and Practice Unchanged: Key Findings from the 2014 General Social Survey |url=http://www.norc.org/PDFs/GSS%20Reports/GSS_Religion_2014.pdf |website=General Social Survey |publisher=NORC |date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arab world ===
In recent years, the profile of atheism has risen substantially in the Arab world.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newhumanist.org.uk/articles/4898/the-rise-of-arab-atheism |title=The rise of Arab atheism|accessdate=2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In major cities across the region, such as [[Cairo]], atheists have been organizing in cafés and social media, despite regular crackdowns from authoritarian governments.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; A 2012 poll by Gallup International revealed that 5% of Saudis considered themselves to be "convinced atheists."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, very few young people in the Arab world have atheists in their circle of friends or acquaintances. According to one study, less than 1% did in Morocco, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, or Jordan; only 3% to 7% in the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Palestine.&lt;ref name = "Tabah2016"&gt;[http://mmgsurvey.tabahfoundation.org/downloads/mmgsurvey_full_En_web.pdf Muslim Millennial Attitudes on Religion and Religious Leadership, Arab World], Tabah Foundation, Abu Dhabi, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; When asked whether they have "seen or heard traces of atheism in [their] locality, community, and society" only about 3% to 8% responded yes in all the countries surveyed. The only exception was the UAE, with a percentage of 51%.&lt;ref name = "Tabah2016"/&gt;

===Wealth and education===

A study noted positive correlations between levels of education and secularism, including atheism, in America.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman" /&gt; According to evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber, atheism blossoms in places where most people feel economically secure, particularly in the [[Social democracy|social democracies]] of Europe, as there is less uncertainty about the future with extensive social safety nets and better health care resulting in a greater quality of life and higher life expectancy. By contrast, in underdeveloped countries, there are virtually no atheists.&lt;ref&gt;Nigel Barber (2010). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/why-atheism-will-replace-religion Why Atheism Will Replace Religion]. [[Psychology Today]]. Retrieved 2013-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 study, researchers found intelligence to be negatively related to religious belief in Europe and the United States. In a sample of 137 countries, the correlation between national IQ and disbelief in God was found to be 0.60.&lt;ref name="intmag"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Lynn |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Lynn |last2=Harvey |first2=John |last3=Nyborg |first3=Helmuth |title=Average intelligence predicts atheism rates across 137 nations |journal=[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]] |year=2009 |volume=37 |pages=11–15 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289608000238 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2008.03.004 |accessdate=2015-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary psychologist Nigel Barber states that the reason atheists are more intelligent than religious people is better explained by social, environmental, and wealth factors which happen to correlate with loss of religious belief as well. He doubts that religion causes stupidity, noting that some highly intelligent people have also been religious, but he says it is plausible that higher intelligence correlates to rejection of improbable religious beliefs and that the situation between intelligence and rejection of religious beliefs is quite complex.&lt;ref name="Nigel atheists"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barber|first1=Nigel|title=The Real Reason Atheists Have Higher IQs: Is Atheism a Sign of Intelligence?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/the-real-reason-atheists-have-higher-iqs|publisher=Psychology Today|date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 study, it was shown that compared to religious individuals, atheists have higher reasoning capacities and this difference seemed to be unrelated to sociodemographic factors  such as age, education and country of origin.&lt;ref name="Daws"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daws|first1=Richard E.|last2=Hampshire|first2=Adam|title=The Negative Relationship between Reasoning and Religiosity Is Underpinned by a Bias for Intuitive Responses Specifically When Intuition and Logic Are in Conflict|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=19 December 2017|volume=8|pages=2191|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.02191|pmid=29312057|pmc=5742220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitudes toward atheism===

Statistically, atheists are held in poor regard across the globe. Non-atheists, and possibly even fellow atheists, seem to implicitly view atheists as prone to exhibit immoral behaviors ranging from mass murder to not paying at a restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carey|first1=Benedict|title=The Serial Killer Test: Biases Against Atheists Emerge in Study|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/health/atheists-religion-study.html|accessdate=2018-01-23|work=The New York Times|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Paris|first1=Agence France-Presse in|title=Atheists tend to be seen as immoral – even by other atheists: study|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/07/anti-atheist-prejudice-secularity|accessdate=2018-01-23|work=the Guardian|date=7 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gervais|first1=Will M.|last2=Xygalatas|first2=Dimitris|last3=McKay|first3=Ryan T.|last4=van Elk|first4=Michiel|last5=Buchtel|first5=Emma E.|last6=Aveyard|first6=Mark|last7=Schiavone|first7=Sarah R.|last8=Dar-Nimrod|first8=Ilan|last9=Svedholm-Häkkinen|first9=Annika M.|last10=Riekki|first10=Tapani|last11=Klocová|first11=Eva Kundtová|last12=Ramsay|first12=Jonathan E.|last13=Bulbulia|first13=Joseph|title=Global evidence of extreme intuitive moral prejudice against atheists|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|date=7 August 2017|volume=1|issue=8|pages=0151|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0151|url=http://psyarxiv.com/csnp2/|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to a 2016 [[Pew Research Center]] publication, 15% of French people, 45% of Americans, and 99% of Indonesians explicitly believe that a person must believe in God to be moral. Pew furthermore noted that, in a U.S. poll, atheists and Muslims tied for the lowest rating among the major religious demographics on a "feeling thermometer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 facts about atheists|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/06/01/10-facts-about-atheists/|website=Pew Research Center|accessdate=2018-01-23|date=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first takes the privative ''a'' both before the Greek ''theos'' (divinity) and ''gnosis'' (to know) to mean that atheism is simply the absence of belief in the gods and agnosticism is simply lack of knowledge of some specified subject matter. The second definition takes atheism to mean the explicit denial of the existence of gods and agnosticism as the position of someone who, because the existence of gods is unknowable, suspends judgment regarding them&amp;nbsp;... The first is the more inclusive and recognizes only two alternatives: Either one believes in the gods or one does not. Consequently, there is no third alternative, as those who call themselves agnostics sometimes claim. Insofar as they lack belief, they are really atheists. Moreover, since absence of belief is the cognitive position in which everyone is born, the burden of proof falls on those who advocate religious belief. The proponents of the second definition, by contrast, regard the first definition as too broad because it includes uninformed children along with aggressive and explicit atheists. Consequently, it is unlikely that the public will adopt it."&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common among contemporary philosophers, and indeed it was not uncommon in earlier centuries, to reject positions on the ground that they are meaningless.

'''BIA Separations''' is a [[biotechnology]] company focused on the production of [[Acrylate polymers|methacrylate]] [[monolithic HPLC column]]s and developing industrial [[Downstream processing|purification]] processes and analytical methods.

==Company history==
BIA Separations was formed in 1998 by a group of scientists in [[Ljubljana]], [[Slovenia]] to commercialize a new [[chromatography|chromatographic]] resin based on monolith technology. Monolithic resin was developed independently by three different laboratories in late 1980s led by Hjertén, Švec and Tennikova.&lt;ref&gt;F. Švec, T. B. Tennikova, Z. Deyl [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/bookseries/03014770/67 ''Monolithic materials preparation, properties and applications''] Journal of Chromatography Library, Elsevier, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The company was one of the few Slovenian companies to receive [[venture capital]] funding at that time-Horizonte Venture Management realizing the potential of monoliths made the initial investment in the company. During that year, BIA Separations released its first commercial product marketed under the trade name of CIM (Convective Interaction Media). The new technique was named HPMC (High Performance Monolith Chromatography). During the 1999 and 2000s, the company promoted this new platform technology to the scientific and business community and registered several patents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trademarkia.com/cim-convective-interaction-media-75782521.html CIM Convective Interaction Media]

In 2011 BIA Separations entered a strategic partnership with Japan Synthetic Rubber Corporation, a Japanese company producing synthetic materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biotechnology-europe.com/news/news%20by%20company/JSR%20Corporation/18.01.2012%20JSR%20Expands%20its%20Biomedical%20Business%20by%20Investing%20in%20BIA%20Separations%20Unique%20Purification%20Technology.htm JSR Expands its Biomedical Business by Investing in BIA Separations' Unique Purification Technology]
*[http://www.process-worldwide.com/management/markets_industries/articles/345300/ JSR Buys Into Austrian Separations Solutions Manufacturer]&lt;/ref&gt; A strategic partnership agreement with [[Showa Denko]] K.K. (SDK) was signed in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.in-pharmatechnologist.com/Processing/SDK-invests-in-BIAsep-to-get-resins-know-how SDK invests in BIAsep to get resins know-how]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
CIM monoliths are made of [[porosity|porous]] methacrylate polymers composed of interconnected channels that range in size from 1-6 μm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biaseparations.com/sp/209/cim-technology CIM Technology] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121171748/http://www.biaseparations.com/sp/209/cim-technology |date=2013-01-21 }}
*[http://www.agilent.com/about/newsroom/presrel/2008/29may-ca08038.html Agilent Technologies, BIA Separations GmbH Sign Agreement Giving Agilent Access to BIA Separations Bio-Monolithic Technology]&lt;/ref&gt; It is these channels that account for the media separation power and flow characteristics and ability to purify large biomolecules, such as large [[proteins]], [[immunoglobulin]]s, [[plasmid|plasmid DNA]] and [[virus]]es with their activity intact. Components to be separated are conveyed to the  active groups located on the [[surface modification|surface]] of the channels by [[convection|bulk flow]] of the mobile phase. Since the channels are interconnected, there is no [[diffusion]], no [[Cul-de-sac|dead end]] pores, no [[High-performance liquid chromatography#Parameters|void volume]] and no stagnant zones to slow down the transport between the [[Stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary]] and [[mobile phase]]. Consequently, monolithic columns have flow independent resolution and binding capacity. They exhibit low [[back pressure]], even at very high flow rates. In this way, the purification time can be significantly decreased, resulting in a pronounced reduction of the purification [[process costing|process costs]].

==Applications==
Depending on the column size, CIM monolithic columns are primarily used for the purification or analysis of large biomolecules which are being used for [[cancer]] [[gene therapy]], treatment of viral [[infection|infectious diseases]] and treatment of [[genetic disease]]s. Some types of molecules that can be successfully purified using CIM columns are [[plasmid|pDNA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shin|first1=Min Jae|last2=Tan|first2=Lihan|last3=Jeong|first3=Min Ho|last4=Kim|first4=Ji-Heung|last5=Choe|first5=Woo-Seok|title=Monolith-based immobilized metal affinity chromatography increases production efficiency for plasmid DNA purification|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|volume=1218|issue=31|year=2011|pages=5273–5278|issn=0021-9673|doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2011.06.040}}

==The Monolith Summer School==
Since 2004, BIA Separations has organized and hosted the Monolith Summer School and Symposium (MSS) which takes place every 2 years. MSS was established as there were no dedicated conferences to this technology and to bring together the top international scientists and researchers in the area of monolith chromatography to share their experiences and innovative applications.

The BRAIN Initiative reflects a number of influences, stemming back over a decade. Some of these include: planning meetings at the [[National Institutes of Health]] that led to the NIH's Blueprint for Neuroscience Research;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research|url=http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/|website=nih.gov|publisher=National Institutes of Health|accessdate=7 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; workshops at the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) on [[cognition]], [[neuroscience]], and [[Emerging technologies|convergent science]], including a 2006 report on "Grand Challenges of Mind and Brain";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSF Report on Grand Challenges of Mind and Brain|url=https://www.nsf.gov/publications/pub_summ.jsp?ods_key=biorpt080706|website=NSF publication|publisher=NSF|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; reports from the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] and the [[Institute of Medicine]]'s Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders, including "From Molecules to Mind: Challenges for the 21st Century," a report of a June 25, 2008 Workshop on Grand Challenges in Neuroscience.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Workshop on Grand Challenges in Neuroscience |url=http://www.iom.edu/Activities/Research/NeuroForum/2008-JUN-25.aspx |website=Institute of Medicine |publisher=National Academies of Science |accessdate=9 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110221031831/http://www.iom.edu/Activities/Research/NeuroForum/2008-JUN-25.aspx |archivedate=21 February 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; years of research and reports from scientists and professional societies; and congressional interest. One important activity was the [[Brain Activity Map Project]]. In September 2011, molecular biologist Miyoung Chun of [[Kavli Foundation (United States)|The Kavli Foundation]] organized a conference in London, at which scientists first put forth the idea of such a project.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2/&gt;&lt;ref name=BostonGlobe&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bo.st/17htYTC|title=Local Scientists on Brain Mapping Dream Team Reflect on Challenges, Opportunity|first=Carolyn|last=Johnson|newspaper=Boston Globe|date=April 5, 2013|accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At subsequent meetings, scientists from US government laboratories, including members of the [[Office of Science and Technology Policy]], and from the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] and the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]], along with representatives from [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Qualcomm]], discussed possibilities for a future government-led project.&lt;ref name=NYTimes1/&gt; Other influences included the interdisciplinary "Decade of the Mind" project led by James L. Olds, who is currently the Assistant Director for Biological Sciences at NSF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olds|first1=James L.|title=For an International Decade of the Mind|journal=The Malaysian Journal of Medical Studies|date=Apr–Jun 2011|volume=18|issue=2|pages=1–2|pmc=3216206|pmid=22135580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSF Selects James Olds to head Biological Science Directorate|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=132477|website=NSF.gov|publisher=NSF|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Revolutionizing Prosthetics" project at [[DARPA]], led by Dr. [[Geoffrey Ling]] and shown on [[60 Minutes]] in April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pentagon's Bionic Arm|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-pentagons-bionic-arm/|website=cbsnews.com|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the plan for the BRAIN Initiative within the [[Executive Office of the President]] (EOP) was led by OSTP and included the following EOP staff:  [[Philip Rubin]], then Principal Assistant Director for Science and leader of the White House Neuroscience Initiative; [[Thomas Kalil]], Deputy Director for Technology and Innovation; Cristin Dorgelo, then Assistant Director for Grand Challenges, and currently Chief of Staff at OSTP; and Carlos Peña, Assistant Director for Emerging Technologies and currently the Division Director for the Division of Neurological and Physical Medicine Devices, in the Office of Device Evaluation, Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), at the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=White House OSTP staff|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/about/leadershipstaff|website=WhiteHouse.gov|publisher=US Government|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BRAIN Grand Challenges Conference|url=http://gcbme.embs.org/brain2014/speakers/|website=IEEE EMBS|publisher=IEEE|accessdate=9 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203065054/http://gcbme.embs.org/brain2014/speakers/|archive-date=2015-12-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Announcement==
[[File:BRAIN Initiative announcement.png|thumb|right|[[NIH]] Director Dr. [[Francis Collins]] and President [[Barack Obama]] announcing the BRAIN Initiative]]
On April 2, 2013, at  a White House event, President [[Barack Obama]] announced The BRAIN Initiative, with proposed initial expenditures for fiscal year 2014 of approximately $110 million from the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), the  [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), and the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF).&lt;ref name=NYTimes2/&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=WhiteHouse/&gt; The President also directed the [[Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues]] to explore the ethical, legal, and societal implications raised by the initiative and by neuroscience in general. Additional commitments were also made by the [[Allen Institute for Brain Science]], the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], and [[Kavli Foundation (United States)|The Kavli Foundation]]. The NIH also announced the creation of a working group of the Advisory Committee to the Director, led by neuroscientists [[Cornelia Bargmann]] and [[William Newsome]] and with ''ex officio'' participation from DARPA and NSF, to help shape NIH's role in the BRAIN Initiative. NSF planned to receive advice from its directorate advisory committees, from the [[National Science Board]], and from a series of meetings bringing together scientists in neuroscience and related areas.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2&gt;{{Cite news|title=Obama to unveil initiative to map the human brain |first1=John| last1=Markoff| first2=James| last2=Gorman |newspaper=New York Times |date=April 2, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/science/obama-to-unveil-initiative-to-map-the-human-brain.html|accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=WhiteHouse/&gt;

News reports said the research would map the dynamics of neuron activity in [[animal testing|mice and other animals]]&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://healthland.time.com/2013/02/19/brain-map-president-obama-proposes-first-detailed-guide-of-human-brain-function/|title=Brain Map: President Obama Proposes First Detailed Guide of Human Brain Function|first=Maia|last=Szalavitz|journal=Time|date=February 19, 2013|accessdate=February 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually the tens of billions of neurons in the human brain.&lt;ref&gt;Human brains average 86 billion neurons by a recent estimate.

In a 2012 scientific commentary outlining experimental plans for a more limited project, Alivisatos ''et al.'' outlined a variety of specific experimental techniques that might be used to achieve what they termed a "functional [[connectome]]", as well as new technologies that will have to be developed in the course of the project.&lt;ref name=Neuron2012&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Alivisatos|first1=A.

Mid-term studies could be done in [[zebrafish]], [[laboratory mice|mice]], and the [[Etruscan shrew]], with studies ultimately to be done in [[Animal testing on non-human primates|primates]] and humans. They proposed the development of [[nanoparticle]]s that could be used as [[voltage]] [[sensor]]s that would detect individual [[action potential]]s, as well as [[Nanoprobe (device)|nanoprobes]] that could serve as [[electrophysiology|electrophysiological]] [[multielectrode array]]s. In particular, they called for the use of wireless, noninvasive methods of neuronal activity detection, either utilizing [[Microelectronics|microelectronic]] [[very-large-scale integration]], or based on [[synthetic biology]] rather than microelectronics. In one such proposed method, enzymatically produced [[DNA]] would serve as a "ticker tape record" of neuronal activity,&lt;ref name=Neuron2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=PlosCB&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Kording|first1=Konrad|authorlink1=Konrad Kording|title=Of Toasters and Molecular Ticker Tapes|journal=[[PLOS Computational Biology]]|date=December 2011|volume=7|issue=12|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002291|url=http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1002291|accessdate=February 27, 2013|pages=e1002291}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on [[calcium]] ion-induced errors in coding by [[DNA polymerase]].&lt;ref name=PlosONE&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Zamft|first1=Bradley Michael|last2=Marblestone|first2=Adam H.|last3=Kording|first3=Konrad|authorlink3=Konrad Kording|last4=Schmidt|first4=Daniel|last5=Martin-Alarcon|first5=Daniel|last6=Tyo|first6=Keith|last7=Boyden|first7=Edward S.|last8=Church|first8=George|title=Measuring Cation Dependent DNA Polymerase Fidelity Landscapes by Deep Sequencing|journal=[[PLOS ONE]]|date=August 2012|volume=7|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0043876|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0043876|accessdate=February 27, 2013|pmid=22928047|pages=e43876|pmc=3425509}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data would be analyzed and modeled by large scale [[computational neuroscience|computation]].&lt;ref name=Neuron2012/&gt; A related technique proposed the use of high-throughput [[DNA sequencing]] for rapidly mapping neural connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zador |first1=Anthony M. |last2=Dubnau |first2=Joshua |last3=Oyibo |first3=Hassana K. |last4=Zhan |first4=Huiqing |last5=Cao |first5=Gang |last6=Peikon |first6=Ian D. |title=Sequencing the Connectome |journal=PLoS Biology |volume=10 |issue=10 |year=2012 |pmid=23109909 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001411 |pages=e1001411 |pmc=3479097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Scientists offered differing views of the plan. Neuroscientist John Donoghue said that the project would fill a gap in [[neuroscience]] research between, on the one hand, activity measurements at the level of brain regions using methods such as [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]], and, on the other hand, measurements at the level of [[single-unit recording|single cells]].&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Psychologist Ed Vul expressed concern, however, that the initiative would divert funding from individual investigator studies.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; Neuroscientist Donald Stein expressed concern that it would be a mistake to begin by spending money on technological methods, before knowing exactly what would be measured.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2/&gt; Physicist [[Michael Roukes]] argued instead that methods in nanotechnology are becoming sufficiently mature to make the time right for a brain activity map.&lt;ref name=NYTimes2/&gt;

The projects face great logistical challenges. Neuroscientists estimated that the project would generate 300 [[exabyte]]s of data every year, presenting a significant technical barrier.&lt;ref name=dots&gt;{{cite news |title=Connecting the Neural Dots |first=John |last=Markoff |newspaper=New York Times |date=February 26, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/science/proposed-brain-mapping-project-faces-significant-hurdles.html?pagewanted=all |accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the available high-resolution brain activity monitors are of limited use, as they must be invasively implanted surgically by opening the skull.&lt;ref name=dots/&gt; Parallels have been drawn to past large-scale government-led research efforts including the map of the human genome, the voyage to the moon, and the [[Manhattan Project|development of the atomic bomb]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes1/&gt;

'''Barbara Coombs Lee''' (born 1947), R.N., P.A., F.N.P., J.D., is an [[United States|American]] activist, former health insurance company executive, and president of [[Compassion &amp; Choices]], a national non-profit organization dedicated to expanding and protecting the rights of the terminally ill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2008/06/06/CMR51086S5.DTL|title=Hastening the End In the face of painful, debilitating illness, some people turn to end-of-life consultants as they plan for death|accessdate=24 February 2010 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Katherine | last=Seligman | date=8 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staffing the Oregon Senate Healthcare and Bioethics committee in 1991, Coombs Lee helped Oregon State Senator [[Frank L. Roberts]] as he proposed one of the first [[medical aid in dying|aid in dying]] laws in the nation. When Coombs Lee read in her [[church bulletin]] that congregants wanted to draft a Death with Dignity bill and place it before Oregon voters, she volunteered to help. She joined the Oregon Right to Die Political Action Committee that had already been working on draft bills, and was later selected, together with Elven Sinnard and Dr. Peter Goodwin, to be a chief petitioner who filed the [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act]] as a citizens' initiative in 1994. Coombs Lee served as spokesperson for the group through two statewide campaigns and 10 years defending against attacks on the nation's first Death with Dignity law in both the judicial and legislative arenas. Senator Roberts' wife, Oregon Governor [[Barbara Roberts]], became a good friend and a tireless and outspoken advocate for Death with Dignity.

Under Coombs Lee's leadership, since 1996 as president of Compassion in Dying (which became Compassion &amp; Choices in 2005), the end-of-life choice movement has achieved many milestones. In 2008, Coombs Lee was a senior advisor for the Washington State Death with Dignity ballot initiative that voters approved by an 18-point margin, becoming the second state to legalize [[medical aid in dying|aid in dying]]. In 2009, the Montana Supreme Court ruled in the landmark case brought by Compassion &amp; Choices (''[[Baxter v. Montana]]'') that it is not against the state's public policy for a physician to provide aid in dying to a mentally competent, terminally ill adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/IndyBlog/archives/2011/09/15/montana-leads-the-way-in-end-of-life-choice|title=Montana leads the way in end-of-life choice|accessdate=28 June 2013 | work=The Missoula Independent | first=Skylar| last=Browning}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coombs Lee has been interviewed by many of the nation's leading media outlets, including Bloomberg News, ''The New York Times, USA Today, The Washington Post, The Chicago Tribune'', All Things Considered, The Diane Rehm Show, NBC News, Crossfire, 60 Minutes, The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, The Today Show, On Our Own Terms: Moyers on Dying, and The Dr. Oz Show.

Coombs Lee has presented at TEDx Talks, Stanford MedicineX, CUSP Conference, Plato Society, American Bar Association, Older Women's League, American Pain Society, Oregon State Bar, Cleveland City Club, Americans for Better Care of the Dying, American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Pain Society, and the World Federation Right to Die. Her audiences include the Oregon Gerontological Association and the California Nurse Assembly &amp; Education Conference. Her 1999 debate Doctor Assisted Suicide: Compassionate Alternative or Murder with James Bopp, Jr., was produced the Annenberg Public Policy Center for Public Radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.justicetalking.org/ShowPage.aspx?ShowID=127|title=Compassion or Killing: Doctor Assisted Suicide|accessdate=28 June 2013 | work=Justice Talking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coombs Lee studied literature and nursing at Vassar College, Cornell University, and the New York Hospital School of Nursing, and earned advanced degrees in medicine and law from the School of Public Health Medex Program and Lewis &amp; Clark Law School. She is an inactive member of the Oregon State Bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.osbar.org/members/membersearch_display.asp?b=902365 |title=Oregon State Bar: Barbara Coombs Lee |accessdate=21 January 2016 |website=Oregon Bar Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alvastra monasty Sweden 3.jpg|thumb|150px|Queen Benedicta was buried at [[Alvastra]]]]
'''Benedicta Ebbesdotter of Hvide''' (c. 1165 or 1170 – c. 1199 or 1200) was a Swedish queen consort, first consort of king [[Sverker II of Sweden]]. In [[Sweden]] she was often called '''''Queen Bengta'''''.

==Early life==

Our knowledge of Benedicta comes from a genealogy of the [[Hvide]] family compiled in the [[Sorø Abbey]] in the 14th century. From the terse data of this source, the following life-story has been deduced. Benedicta was born in [[Knadrup]] in Northern [[Zealand]] in [[Denmark]] between 1165 and 1170 as the child of the noble Ebbe Sunesson [[Hvide]]. The Swedish infant prince [[Sverker Karlsson]] was brought to Denmark in 1167 after the killing of his father, and was apparently raised by his powerful maternal relatives.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Nygren, "Benedicta", ''Svenskt biografiskt lexikon'', https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=18473&lt;/ref&gt; Most probably he met his future bride, a kinswoman of his mother, there, and married her when reaching manly years. This may have happened in the mid-1180s.

In 1195 or 1196, her spouse became king of Sweden, and she became queen consort. The same year, her relative, the [[priest]] Andreas Sunesson, returned to Denmark from [[France]] and became the leading [[cleric]]al politician in the [[archbishopric]] under [[Absalon]], also a relative of Benedicta. It is probable that Queen Benedicta shared the strongly pro-clerical position of her husband, and supported the power aspirations of the Church and the archbishop [[Olov Lambatunga]] in [[Uppsala]].

Since Sverker's next queen [[Ingegerd Birgersdotter of Bjelbo|Ingegerd]] gave birth to a son in 1201, it is assumed that Queen Benedicta died no later than in 1199 or 1200. The cause of her death is unknown, but is sometimes guessed that she succumbed in [[childbirth]]. However, a grave inscription from the so-called Sverker Chapel in [[Alvastra]] has been associated with her. It mentions "the servant of Our Lord Jesus Christ, Benedicta", with an expression of hope that "she may find rest from the horrible disease which struck her".&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Nygren, "Benedicta", ''Svenskt biografiskt lexikon'', https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=18473&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems of chronology==

The extreme curtness of the sources on Sverker II's wives has given rise to an alternative chronology of the marriages. It has been suggested that Ingegerd was in fact his first consort, which tied him to the powerful [[House of Bjälbo]] in [[Östergötland]]. Ingegerd's father, Jarl [[Birger Brosa]], was presumably instrumental in arranging the peaceful succession in 1195/96, when Sverker was enthroned after the death of his father's murderer [[Canute I of Sweden|Canute I]]. On the other hand, Sverker was able to gather strong support from his Danish in-laws when he tried to take back his kingdom from Canute I's son [[Eric X of Sweden|Eric]] in 1208. This support would have come more naturally if Sverker was married to Benedicta at this time.&lt;ref&gt;H. Toll, "Sverker II:s drottningar", ''Fornvännen'', 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children==
#[[Helena Sverkersdotter]] born c. 1190, died after 1222, mother of [[Catherine of Ymseborg|Queen Catherine of Sweden]].
# [[Karl Sverkersson the younger]] (d. 1198); parentage unconfirmed. 
# [[Christina, princess of Mecklenburg|Christina]] (d. 1252), married to [[Henry Borwin II, Lord of Mecklenburg|Henry Borwin II of Mecklenburg]]; parentage unconfirmed.
# [[Margareta Sverkersdotter|Margareta]] (1192–1232), married to [[Wizlaw I, Prince of Rügen]]; parentage unconfirmed.

'''Bison Dele''' (born '''Brian Carson Williams'''; April 6, 1969 &amp;ndash; [[Declared death in absentia|presumed dead]] July 7, 2002) was an American professional [[basketball]] player who played [[center (basketball)|center]]. He played for the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]'s [[Orlando Magic]], [[Denver Nuggets]], [[Los Angeles Clippers]], [[Chicago Bulls]] and [[Detroit Pistons]]. Dele won a championship with the Bulls in 1997. He is believed to have been [[murder]]ed at sea by his older brother in 2002.&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite news|last=Keown|first=Tim|title=Paradise Lost|url=http://espn.go.com/magazine/vol5no21dele.html|accessdate=October 19, 2013|newspaper=ESPN The Magazine|date=October 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and NCAA career==
Williams was born in [[Fresno]], [[California]], the second son of Patricia Phillips and of singer Eugene "Geno" Williams Jr. of the musical group [[The Platters]], who later divorced.&lt;ref name=oag&gt;{{Cite journal|title=DEARLY DEPARTED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BISON DELE AND MILES DABORD WAS FILLED WITH LOVE, JEALOUSY - AND UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.(Sports)|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-92959671.html|work=Rocky Mountain News|date=October 12, 2002|author=Michael BeDan|author2=Brian D.

==Pro basketball career==
===NBA===
After playing for two seasons at Arizona, he was drafted in the first round of the [[1991 NBA Draft]] by the [[Orlando Magic]]. He saw limited action during two seasons in Orlando.

After playing for Orlando, Williams joined the [[Denver Nuggets]], for whom he played for two seasons. In [[1993–94 NBA season|1993–94]], he played a career-high 80 games and averaged 8.0 points per game. He subsequently played one year for the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], earning increased playing time and averaging 15.8 points per game. Due to a contract dispute and reports that Williams' asking price was too high, he could not find a team at the beginning of the [[1996–97 NBA season|1996–97]] season, sitting out most of the season. He was then signed by the [[Chicago Bulls]] nine games before the end of the season and became an important backup player in the Bulls' run to their fifth championship. He finished his career playing two seasons with the [[Detroit Pistons]], where he set career highs of 16.2 points and 8.9 rebounds per game in [[1997–98 NBA season|1997–98]].

In 1998, he changed his name to Bison Dele to honor his [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] (Cherokee)&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] ancestry, and played his final season under that name.

=== Retirement ===
Dele, who was known for his eccentric behavior, suddenly retired from the NBA in an equally perplexing fashion. He retired before the start of the [[1999–2000 NBA season|1999–2000]] season at age 30, when he was still in the prime of his career. He had been the Pistons' highest-paid player, but had strained relationships with the organization and decided to walk away from the remaining five years and US$36.45 million on his contract rather than be traded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency=The Associated Press | title=Pistons' Dele Retires | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/10/22/archive/main67585.shtml | publisher=CBS News | date=1999-10-22 | accessdate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been theorized he had never been especially passionate about playing basketball and felt he had earned enough money to allow him to walk away from the pro game and lifestyle.&lt;ref name=oag/&gt;

=== Personal ===
Dele reportedly dated [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] at one point in his career.&lt;ref name=espn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/magic/cohen_unsolvedmystery_110811.html Cohen: An Unsolved Mystery]&lt;/ref&gt; He played the saxophone, violin and trumpet, enjoyed adventure travel, and earned a pilot's licence. After his retirement he spent long periods traveling to Lebanon, the Mediterranean, and in Australia's Outback before learning to sail and purchasing a catamaran to sail the [[seven seas]].&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;

== Disappearance in the South Pacific ==
On July 6, 2002 Dele and his girlfriend, Serena Karlan, along with skipper Bertrand Saldo, sailed from [[Tahiti]] on Dele's [[catamaran]], the ''Hukuna Matata''.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt;  Dele's brother, Miles Dabord (born Kevin Williams), was the only person involved in the voyage who was seen or heard from after July 8, 2002, when the last of three satellite phone calls from the voyage was made.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; Dele and Karlan had previously kept regular contact with their banks and family members. On July 20, Dabord brought the boat into Tahiti; he was alone aboard the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=The Associated Press  | title=Witnesses say Dele's brother brought boat in alone | url=http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2002/0915/1432129.html | work=ESPN | date=2002-09-15 | accessdate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 5, 2002, police used a [[sting operation]] organized by Dele's family and friends to detain Dabord in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]]. Dabord had [[forgery|forged]] Dele's signature in order to buy US$152,000 worth of gold under his brother's name, using Dele's [[passport]] as identification.&lt;ref name=departed&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Bedan; Brian D. Crecente | title=Dearly Departed | url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/dele/index.shtml | work=Rocky Mountain News | date=2002-10-12 | accessdate=2007-09-29 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930220248/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/dele/index.shtml | archivedate=2007-09-30 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mexican police later found that Dabord had been staying at a hotel in [[Tijuana]], [[Mexico]]. Two days before, the ''Hukuna Matata'', which had been registered in Tahiti under another name, was found off the coast of Tahiti with its name plate removed and some possible bullet holes patched. About the same time, Dabord phoned his mother, Patricia Phillips, telling her that he would never hurt Dele and that he could not survive in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=The Associated Press | title=Ex-NBA star Dele, girlfriend missing in Pacific | url=http://static.espn.go.com/nba/news/2002/0911/1430715.html | work=ESPN | date=2002-09-12 | accessdate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] and French authorities became involved in the investigation, and concluded that Dele, Karlan and Saldo were probably murdered and then thrown overboard, or forced to walk off the boat into the ocean, by Dabord. Given that the bodies were likely dumped in the middle of the [[Pacific Ocean]], it would be highly unlikely that the three would ever be found.&lt;ref name=oag/&gt;&lt;ref name=departed/&gt;

Dabord, the only first-person source of information regarding the case, intentionally overdosed on [[insulin (medication)|insulin]] and slipped into a [[coma]]. On September 27, 2002, Dabord died in a California hospital. In his account of events, Dabord said he and his brother had fought, and that Karlan had been accidentally hit and died when her head struck part of the boat. When Saldo wanted to report her death, a panicked Dele killed him; Dabord then shot his brother in [[self-defense]], threw the bodies overboard and subsequently fled back to the U.S.&lt;ref name=SI/&gt; After Dabord's suicide, officials did not expect to find much more regarding the case. A memorial service was then held for both Dabord and Dele.

The brothers were frequently at odds with each other. After Dabord's death, his lawyer and lifelong best friend, Paul White, was questioned regarding his client but gave little information about what happened. Dabord had said that he knew for sure that Dele and Karlan were in [[French Polynesia]], but not much more other than that he was trying to help Dele.&lt;ref name=departed/&gt;

''Chemical Leasing'' is a business model that intends to shift the focus from increasing sales volume of chemicals towards a value-added approach.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]]&lt;/ref&gt; It leads to the more efficient use of chemicals, and to the improved health and safety, environmental, and economic benefits. '''Find the definition and the examples''' on [http://www.chemicalleasing.org www.chemicalleasing.org] 

== Definitions ==
The term Chemical Leasing is the name of a business model and is NOT the same thing as leasing of chemicals, although it may include leasing operations.&lt;ref&gt;"Chemical Leasing" vs leasing of chemicals, Vojislavka Satric and Maria Grineva, ([https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chemical-leasing-vs-chemicals-maria-grineva/ LinkedIn], 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

The producer mainly sells the functions performed by the chemical and the functional units, such as the number of pieces painted, are the main basis for payment.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical Leasing Goes Global&amp;nbsp;– Selling Services Instead of Barrels: A Win-Win Business Model for Environment and Industry, Eds Thomas Jakl and Petra Schwager, (Wien : Springer&amp;nbsp;– Verlag, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; It is a business model in which a customer engages with a service provider in a strategic, long-term contract to supply and manage the customer’s chemical and related services.&lt;ref&gt;M Stoughton, T Votta, Implementing service-based chemical procurement: Lessons and results. Journal of Cleaner Production 11(8) (2003) 839– 849.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chemical Leasing applied in many companies, but sometimes under different names. Similar concepts: eco-efficient services, product-service systems, pay-per-use, circular-economy, performance-based, functional-based, service-oriented, chemicals-as-a-service, etc. In case of the doubt, it is better to check the official UNIDO definition of Chemical Leasing &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemicalleasing.org Chemical Leasing website]&lt;/ref&gt;:

* Chemical Leasing is a service-oriented business model that shifts the focus from increasing sales volume of chemicals towards a value-added approach.
* The producer mainly sells the functions performed by the chemical and functional units are the main basis for payment.
* Within Chemical Leasing business models the responsibility of the user and the supplier is extended and may include management of the entire lifecycle.
* Chemical Leasing strives for a win-win situation. It aims at increasing the efficient use of chemicals while reducing the risks of chemicals and protecting human health. It improves the economic and environmental performance of participating companies and enhances their access to new markets.
* Key elements of successful Chemical Leasing business models are proper benefit sharing, high-quality standards and mutual trust between participating companies.

[[File:ChL service.jpg|center|500px|thumb|Differences between traditional buyer-seller relationship and service-based model of chemical leasing.]]


Chemical leasing promotes the sustainable management of chemicals. By shifting the focus from increasing the sales volume of chemicals towards a more value-added approach, it is an illustration of [[extended producer responsibility]]. The chemical company supplies chemicals for a specific service, such as coatings, adhesives, washing agents, solvents, and also advises the user on its best use.&lt;ref&gt;Anurag Priyadarshi, The Colourist, 1 (4) (2009) 8 &lt;/ref&gt;.

Built on strong cooperation between partners and based on mutual trust, it increases the efficient use of chemicals, reduces the risks to human health brought about by their use, improves the economic and environmental performance of participating companies and ultimately enhances business performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unido.org/our-focus/safeguarding-environment/resource-efficient-and-low-carbon-industrial-production/chemical-leasing] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Globalization ==
At the [[Earth Summit 2002]] on sustainable development, the international community agreed on the goal of ensuring that, by the year 2020, chemicals will be produced and used in ways that minimize significant adverse impacts on human health and the environment. As a consequence the [http://www.unep.org United Nations Environmental Programme] (UNEP) decided to develop of the Strategic Approach to International Chemicals Management ([[SAICM]]) in 2003. In 2006 at the International Conference on Chemicals Management (ICCM) in Dubai, the signing countries committed themselves to promote the sound management of chemicals and hazardous wastes at all levels.

The Austrian government has played an important role in promoting chemicals management based on resource efficiency and precaution. When Austria held the [[Presidency of the European Union]] during the first half of 2006, chemicals policy was on top of the environmental agenda. Austria continues to promote chemical leasing.

The [[Federal Environment Agency]] (UBA) of [[Germany]] proposed to promote chemical leasing in its "Sustainable Chemicals" paper.&lt;ref&gt;Chemical Leasing Unburdens Environment&amp;nbsp;– UBA presents sustainable chemicals concept, UBA Press Release 14 (Umwelt Bundes Amt, Germany, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [https://web.archive.org/web/20110610142122/http://www.umweltdaten.de/publikationen/fpdf-l/3734.pdf][http://www.chemikalienleasing.de/]

== UNIDO ==

In 2004, the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) and the [[Austrian Ministry of Environment]] decided to jointly support chemical leasing through a number of global projects.  In partnership with [[National Cleaner Production Centers]], UNIDO has implemented chemical leasing projects in Austria, Egypt, Mexico, and Russia. Since then, pilot projects have been conducted in Latin and South America, Africa, Europe and Asia. Nowadays, more than 100 companies worldwide have included Chemical Leasing in their business strategies. 

Chemical Leasing can be applied in many industries and processes, ranging from car manufacturing to cleaning operations, wastewater treatment, textiles, beverage and food production. Some examples of the successful Chemical Leasing collaboration between the chemical user and the chemical supplier can be found here: http://chemicalleasing-toolkit.org/node/8 

A Joint Declaration of Intent on Chemical Leasing was signed between UNIDO, Austria, Germany and Switzerland in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unido.org/news/press/joint-declaration-of.html|title=Joint Declaration of Intent on Chemical Leasing signed between UNIDO, Austria, Germany and Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

PERO Innovative Services GmbH together with [[SAFECHEM Europe GmbH]], a subsidiary of [[The Dow Chemical Company]], have supported Automobiltechnik Blau in metal cleaning to use cost-efficient machines, lower the energy consumption and chemical usage.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[Akzo Nobel Powder Coatings]] S.A.E has supported the chemical leasing of [[powder coating]] in Egypt to [[ABB ARAB]]. Environmental benefits are said to include recycling of powder waste, compliance with environmental regulations, and enhancement of supply chain management.

== REACH ==
The reversal of the burden of proof is a key component of the [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals]] (REACH) system leading to a "no data&amp;nbsp;– no market" concept, obliging producers or importers of substances to deliver documentation regarding properties of chemicals and possible risks during their application as a pre-condition for market access. The OECD Conference in Vienna in 2003 Nov. reiterated that, "... The new EU chemicals policy (REACH) will require a new relationship between provider and user ...." According to [[Thomas Jakl]], Chairman of the European Chemical Agency (ECHA), chemical leasing paves the way to comply with REACH obligations.

Chemical leasing and REACH share the same philosophy of ensuring compliance with a [[duty of care]] (REACH recital 16), as a tool to demonstrate adequate control (REACH para 60). They are mutually supportive in developing rules for sharing costs, and ensuring that chemicals are handled properly. Both are involve several different stages of the supply chain. There is a strong effort by the Austrian and German Governments to bring chemical leasing within the purview of EU Chemicals policy and regulations.&lt;ref name="Barrels 2008"&gt;Chemical Leasing Goes Global&amp;nbsp;– Selling Services Instead of Barrels: A Win-Win Business Model for Environment and Industry, Eds T Jakl and P Schwager, (Wien : Springer&amp;nbsp;– Verlag, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ChL REACH.jpg|500px|thumb|center|[[Synergy|Synergies]] between chemical leasing and [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|EU REACH]] legislation.]]

== Project phases ==
Chemical leasing projects are divided into planning, implementation, evaluation and dissemination stages, based on a [[Deming Cycle]]. The planning stage consists of a preparatory phase, a process optimisation phase and a design phase. In this stage, discussions around the leasing model, its cost implications versus quality and environmental benefits, commercial terms, and conditions begin. A baseline audit is performed, and a report presented to the factory management. This audit outlines the potential for improvements and forms the basis of defining the [[key performance indicators]] (KPIs). The resources needed to fulfil improvements are also defined.

The implementation stage starts with the signing of a chemical leasing agreement that defines the scope and conditions, unit of payment, KPIs, roles, and responsibilities. The chemical company  supervises the chemical process, transporting and managing the inventory, laboratory management, improving process controls, record keeping, and training workers. Periodic checks and inspections are carried out independently to verify that the implementation is proceeding on expected lines. At the end of the implementation phase, progress is evaluated, often by an external party to secure objectivity. Finally, any project benefits are quantified and learning is documented, to provide input for future projects.&lt;ref name="Barrels 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anurag Priyadarshi, Chemical Leasing in Colour and Environmental Management&amp;nbsp;– theoretical framework, implementation methodology and future outlook, paper read at UNIDO&amp;nbsp;– GCPC Chemical Leasing workshop, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25532">A '''cognitive model''' is an approximation to animal [[cognition|cognitive processes]] (predominantly human) for the purposes of comprehension and prediction. Cognitive models can be developed within or without a [[cognitive architecture]], though the two are not always easily distinguishable.

In contrast to cognitive architectures, cognitive models tend to be focused on a single cognitive phenomenon or process (e.g. list learning), how two or more processes interact (e.g. visual search and decision making), or to make behavioral predictions for a specific task or tool (e.g. how instituting a new software package will affect productivity). Cognitive architectures tend to be focused on the structural properties of the modeled system, and help constrain the development of cognitive models within the architecture. Likewise, model development helps to inform limitations and shortcomings of the architecture. Some of the most popular architectures for cognitive modeling include [[ACT-R]], [[CLARION (cognitive architecture)|Clarion]], and [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|Soar]].

==History==
Cognitive modeling historically developed within [[cognitive psychology]]/[[cognitive science]] (including [[human factors]]), and has received contributions from the fields of [[machine learning]] and [[artificial intelligence]] to name a few. There are many types of cognitive models, and they can range from box-and-arrow diagrams to a set of equations to software programs that interact with the same tools that humans use to complete tasks (e.g., computer mouse and keyboard)&lt;ref&gt; Sun, R. (ed.), (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Box-and-arrow models==
A number of key terms are used to describe the processes involved in the perception, storage, and production of speech. Typically, they are used by speech pathologists while treating a child patient. The input signal is the speech signal heard by the child, usually assumed to come from an adult speaker. The output signal is the utterance produced by the child. The unseen psychological events that occur between the arrival of an input signal and the production of speech are the focus of psycholinguistic models. Events that process the input signal are referred to as input processes, whereas events that process the production of speech are referred to as output processes. Some aspects of speech processing are thought to happen online—that is, they occur during the actual perception
or production of speech and thus require a share of the attentional resources dedicated to the speech task. Other processes, thought to happen offline, take place as part of the child's background mental processing rather than during the time dedicated to the speech task.
In this sense, online processing is sometimes defined as occurring in real-time, whereas offline processing is said to be time-free (Hewlett, 1990). In box-and-arrow psycholinguistic models, each hypothesized level of representation or processing can be represented in a diagram by a “box,” and the relationships between them by “arrows,” hence the name. Sometimes (as in the models of Smith, 1973, and Menn, 1978, described later in this paper) the arrows represent processes additional to those shown in boxes. Such models make explicit the hypothesized information-
processing activities carried out in a particular cognitive function (such as language), in a manner analogous to computer flowcharts that depict the processes and decisions carried out by a computer program. Box-and-arrow models differ widely in the number of unseen psychological processes they describe and thus in the number of boxes they contain. Some have only one or two boxes between the input and output signals (e.g., Menn, 1978; Smith, 1973), whereas others have multiple boxes representing complex relationships between a number of different information-processing events (e.g., Hewlett, 1990; Hewlett, Gibbon, &amp; Cohen- McKenzie,1998; Stackhouse &amp; Wells, 1997). The most important box, however, and the source of much ongoing debate, is that representing the underlying representation (or UR). In essence, an underlying representation captures information stored in a child's mind about a word he or she knows and uses. As the following description of several models will illustrate, the nature of this information and thus the type(s) of representation present in the child's knowledge base have captured the attention of researchers for some time. (Elise Baker et al. Psycholinguistic Models of Speech Development and Their Application to Clinical Practice. Journal of Speech, Language, and Hearing Research. June 2001. 44. p 685–702.)

==Computational models==
A [[computational model]] is a mathematical model in [[computational science]] that requires extensive computational resources to study the behavior of a complex system by computer simulation. The system under study is often a complex nonlinear system for which simple, intuitive analytical solutions are not readily available. Rather than deriving a mathematical analytical solution to the problem, experimentation with the model is done by changing the parameters of the system in the computer, and studying the differences in the outcome of the experiments. Theories of operation of the model can be derived/deduced from these computational experiments.
Examples of common computational models are weather forecasting models, earth simulator models, flight simulator models, molecular protein folding models, and neural network models.

===Hybrid===
Hybrid computers are computers that exhibit features of analog computers and digital computers. The digital component normally serves as the controller and provides logical operations, while the analog component normally serves as a solver of differential equations.

==Dynamical systems==
In the traditional [[Computer Simulation|computational approach]], [[Mental representation|representations]] are viewed as static structures of discrete [[Symbolic system|symbols]]. [[Cognition]] takes place by transforming static symbol structures in [[Discrete time|discrete]], sequential steps. [[Sensory system|Sensory]] information is transformed into symbolic inputs, which produce symbolic outputs that get transformed into [[Motor system|motor]] outputs. The entire system operates in an ongoing cycle.

What is missing from this traditional view is that human cognition happens [[Continuous function|continuously]] and in real time. Breaking down the processes into discrete time steps may not fully [[Mathematical model|capture]] this behavior. An alternative approach is to define a system with (1) a state of the system at any given time, (2) a behavior, defined as the change over time in overall state, and (3) a state set or [[State space (dynamical system)|state space]], representing the totality of overall states the system could be in.&lt;ref&gt;van Gelder, T. (1998). [https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170214115306027-0503:S0140525X98311735:S0140525X9800173Xa.pdf The dynamical hypothesis in cognitive science]. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 21, 615-665.&lt;/ref&gt; The system is distinguished by the fact that all of these states belong together. A change in any aspect of the system depends on other aspects of the system.&lt;ref&gt;van Gelder, T. &amp; Port, R. F. (1995). [http://cogsci.ucd.ie/connectionism/Articles/vanGelderPort.pdf It's about time: An overview of the dynamical Approach to cognition]. In R.F. Port and T. van Gelder (Eds.), Mind as motion: Explorations in the Dynamics of Cognition. (pp. 1-43). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical [[Dynamical system|dynamical]] model is [[Formalism (mathematics)|formalized]] by several [[differential equation]]s that describe how the system's state changes over time.  By doing so, the form of the space of possible [[Orbit (dynamics)|trajectories]] and the internal and external forces that shape a specific trajectory that unfold over time, instead of the physical nature of the underlying [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that manifest this dynamics, carry explanatory force. On this dynamical view, parametric inputs alter the system's intrinsic dynamics, rather than specifying an internal state that describes some external state of affairs.

===Early dynamical systems===

====Associative memory====
Early work in the application of dynamical systems to cognition can be found in the model of [[Hopfield network]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Hopfield, J. J. (1982). [http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/79/8/2554.full.pdf Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities]. PNAS, 79, 2554-2558.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hopfield, J. J. (1984). [http://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/81/10/3088.full.pdf Neurons with graded response have collective computational properties like those of two-state neurons]. PNAS, 81, 3088-3092.&lt;/ref&gt; These networks were proposed as a model for [[associative memory (psychology)|associative memory]]. They represent the neural level of [[memory]], modeling systems of around 30 neurons which can be in either an on or off state.  By letting the [[Neural network|network]] learn on its own, structure and computational properties naturally arise. Unlike previous models, “memories” can be formed and recalled by inputting a small portion of the entire memory. Time ordering of memories can also be encoded. The behavior of the system is modeled with [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] which can change values, representing different states of the system. This early model was a major step toward a dynamical systems view of human cognition, though many details had yet to be added and more phenomena accounted for.

==== Language acquisition====
By taking into account the [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary development]] of the human [[nervous system]] and the similarity of the [[brain]] to other organs, [[Jeffrey Elman|Elman]] proposed that [[language]] and cognition should be treated as a dynamical system rather than a digital symbol processor.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, J. L. (1995). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.50.7356&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Language as a dynamical system]. In R.F. Port and T. van Gelder (Eds.), Mind as motion: Explorations in the Dynamics of Cognition. (pp. 195-223). Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Neural networks of the type Elman implemented have come to be known as [[Recurrent neural networks|Elman networks]].  Instead of treating language as a collection of static [[Lexicon|lexical]] items and [[grammar]] rules that are learned and then used according to fixed rules, the dynamical systems view defines the [[lexicon]] as regions of state space within a dynamical system. Grammar is made up of [[attractor]]s and repellers that constrain movement in the state space. This means that representations are sensitive to context, with mental representations viewed as trajectories through mental space instead of objects that are constructed and remain static. Elman networks were trained with simple sentences to represent grammar as a dynamical system. Once a basic grammar had been learned, the networks could then parse complex sentences by predicting which words would appear next according to the dynamical model.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, J. L. (1991). [https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00114844.pdf Distributed representations, simple recurrent networks, and grammatical structure]. Machine Learning, 7, 195-225.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cognitive development====
A classic developmental error has been investigated in the context of dynamical systems:&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, J. P., Smith, L. B., &amp; Thelen, E. (2001). Tests of dynamical systems account of the A-not-B error: The influence of prior experience on the spatial memory abilities of two-year-olds. Child Development, 72(5), 1327-1346.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thelen"&gt;Thelen E., Schoner, G., Scheier, C., Smith, L. B. (2001). [https://static.cambridge.org/resource/id/urn:cambridge.org:id:binary:20170214114618504-0222:S0140525X01223917:S0140525X01003910a.pdf The dynamics of embodiment: A field theory of infant preservative reaching]. Behavioral and Brain Sciences, 24, 1-86.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[A-not-B error]] is proposed to be not a distinct error occurring at a specific age (8 to 10 months), but a feature of a dynamic learning process that is also present in older children. Children 2 years old were found to make an error similar to the A-not-B error when searching for toys hidden in a sandbox. After observing the toy being hidden in location A and repeatedly searching for it there, the 2-year-olds were shown a toy hidden in a new location B. When they looked for the toy, they searched in locations that were biased toward location A. This suggests that there is an ongoing representation of the toy's location that changes over time. The child's past behavior influences its model of locations of the sandbox, and so an account of behavior and learning must take into account how the system of the sandbox and the child's past actions is changing over time.&lt;ref name="Thelen" /&gt;

====Locomotion====
One proposed mechanism of a dynamical system comes from analysis of continuous-time [[recurrent neural networks]] (CTRNNs).  By focusing on the output of the neural networks rather than their states and examining fully interconnected networks, three-neuron [[central pattern generator]] (CPG) can be used to represent systems such as leg movements during walking.&lt;ref&gt;Chiel, H. J., Beer, R. D., &amp; Gallagher, J. C. (1999). Evolution and analysis of model CPGs for walking. Journal of Computational Neuroscience, 7, 99-118.&lt;/ref&gt; This CPG contains three [[motor neuron]]s to control the foot, backward swing, and forward swing effectors of the leg. Outputs of the network represent whether the foot is up or down and how much force is being applied to generate [[torque]] in the leg joint. One feature of this pattern is that neuron outputs are either [[Binary number|off or on]] most of the time. Another feature is that the states are quasi-stable, meaning that they will eventually transition to other states. A simple pattern generator circuit like this is proposed to be a building block for a dynamical system. Sets of neurons that simultaneously transition from one quasi-stable state to another are defined as a dynamic module. These modules can in theory be combined to create larger circuits that comprise a complete dynamical system. However, the details of how this combination could occur are not fully worked out.

===Modern dynamical systems===

====Behavioral dynamics====
Modern formalizations of dynamical systems applied to the study of cognition vary. One such formalization, referred to as “behavioral dynamics”,&lt;ref name="Warren"&gt;Warren, W. H. (2006). [http://rci.rutgers.edu/~persci/speakers/Warren_P%26A_PR06.pdf The dynamics of perception and action]. Psychological Review, 113(2), 359-389. doi: 10.1037/0033-295X.113.2.358&lt;/ref&gt; treats the [[Intelligent agent|agent]] and the environment as a pair of [[Coupling (physics)|coupled]] dynamical systems based on classical dynamical systems theory.  In this formalization, the information from the [[Environment (systems)|environment]] informs the agent's behavior and the agent's actions modify the environment. In the specific case of [[Motor cognition|perception-action cycles]], the coupling of the environment and the agent is formalized by two [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].  The first transforms the representation of the agents action into specific patterns of muscle activation that in turn produce forces in the environment.  The second function transforms the information from the environment (i.e., patterns of stimulation at the agent's receptors that reflect the environment's current state) into a representation that is useful for controlling the agents actions.  Other similar dynamical systems have been proposed (although not developed into a formal framework) in which the agent's nervous systems, the agent's body, and the environment are coupled together&lt;ref&gt;Beer, R. D. (2000). Dynamical approaches to cognitive science.  Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 4(3), 91-99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beer, R. D. (2003). [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.120.3706&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf The dynamics of active categorical perception in an evolved model agent]. Adaptive Behavior, 11(4), 209-243. doi: 10.1177/1059712303114001&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Adaptive behaviors=====
Behavioral dynamics have been applied to locomotive behavior.&lt;ref name="Warren" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fajen, B., R., &amp; Warren, W. H. (2003). [http://www.rc.unesp.br/ib/e_fisica/aplab/obstacle%20avoidance.pdf Behavioral dynamics of steering, obstacle avoidance, and route selection]. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 29, 343-362.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fajen, B. R., Warren, W. H., Temizer, S., &amp; Kaelbling, L. P. (2003). [http://cs.ait.ac.th/~mdailey/cvreadings/Fajen-Dynamical.pdf A dynamical model of visually-guided steering, obstacle avoidance, and route selection]. International Journal of Computer Vision, 54, 15-34.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modeling locomotion with behavioral dynamics demonstrates that adaptive behaviors could arise from the interactions of an agent and the environment.  According to this framework, adaptive behaviors can be captured by two levels of analysis.  At the first level of perception and action, an agent and an environment can be conceptualized as a pair of dynamical systems coupled together by the forces the agent applies to the environment and by the structured information provided by the environment.  Thus, behavioral dynamics emerge from the agent-environment interaction.  At the second level of time evolution,  behavior can be expressed as a dynamical system represented as a vector field. In this vector field, attractors reflect stable behavioral solutions, where as bifurcations reflect changes in behavior.  In contrast to previous work on central pattern generators, this framework suggests that stable behavioral patterns are an emergent, self-organizing property of the agent-environment system rather than determined by the structure of either the agent or the environment.

====Open dynamical systems====
In an extension of classical [[dynamical systems theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Hotton, S., &amp; Yoshimi, J. (2010). The dynamics of embodied cognition. International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 20(4), 943-972. doi: 10.1142/S0218127410026241&lt;/ref&gt; rather than coupling the environment's and the agent's dynamical systems to each other, an “open dynamical system” defines a “total system”, an “agent system”, and a mechanism to relate these two systems.  The total system is a dynamical system that models an agent in an environment, whereas the agent system is a dynamical system that models an agent's intrinsic dynamics (i.e., the agent's dynamics in the absence of an environment).  Importantly, the relation mechanism does not couple the two systems together, but rather continuously modifies the total system into the decoupled agent's total system. By distinguishing between total and agent systems, it is possible to investigate an agent's behavior when it is isolated from the environment and when it is embedded within an environment.  This formalization can be seen as a generalization from the classical formalization, whereby the agent system can be viewed as the agent system in an open dynamical system, and the agent coupled to the environment and the environment can be viewed as the total system in an open dynamical system.

=====Embodied cognition=====
In the context of dynamical systems and [[embodied cognition]], representations can be conceptualized as indicators or mediators.  In the indicator view, internal states carry information about the existence of an object in the environment, where the state of a system during exposure to an object is the representation of that object.  In the mediator view, internal states carry information about the environment which is used by the system in obtaining its goals. In this more complex account, the states of the system carries information that mediates between the information the agent takes in from the environment, and the force exerted on the environment by the agents behavior.  The application of open dynamical systems have been discussed for four types of classical embodied cognition examples:&lt;ref&gt;Hotton, S., &amp; Yoshimi, J. (2011). [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01151.x Extending dynamical systems theory to model embodied cognition]. Cognitive Science, 35, 444-479. doi: 10.1111/j.1551-6709.2010.01151.x&lt;/ref&gt;   
# Instances where the environment and agent must work together to achieve a goal, referred to as "intimacy". A classic example of intimacy is the behavior of simple agents working to achieve a goal (e.g., insects traversing the environment).  The successful completion of the goal relies fully on the coupling of the agent to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Haugeland, J. (1996). [https://philpapers.org/rec/HAUMEA Mind embodied and embedded]. In J. Haugeland (Ed.), Having thought: Essays in the metaphysics of mind (pp. 207-237). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Instances where the use of external artifacts improves the performance of tasks relative to performance without these artifacts. The process is referred to as "offloading".  A classic example of offloading is the behavior of [[Scrabble]] players; people are able to create more words when playing Scrabble if they have the tiles in front of them and are allowed to physically manipulate their arrangement.  In this example, the Scrabble tiles allow the agent to offload [[working memory]] demands on to the tiles themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Maglio, P., Matlock, T., Raphaely, D., Chernickym B., &amp; Kirsh, D. (1999). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Kirsh/publication/2518995_Interactive_Skill_in_Scrabble/links/0912f51230e9fea0bb000000/Interactive-Skill-in-Scrabble.pdf Interactive skill in scrabble]. In M. Hahn &amp; S. C. Stoness (Eds.), Proceedings of twenty-first annual conference of the Cognitive Science Society, (pp. 326-330). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Instances where a functionally equivalent external artifact replaces functions that are normally performed internally by the agent, which is a special case of offloading.  One famous example is that of human (specifically the agents Otto and Inga) navigation in a complex environment with or without assistance of an artifact.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, A., &amp; Chalmers, D. (1998). [https://www.era.lib.ed.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1842/1312/TheExtendedMind.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y The extended mind]. Analysis, 58(1), 7-19.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Instances where there is not a single agent. The individual agent is part of larger system that contains multiple agents and multiple artifacts. One famous example, formulated by [[Edwin Hutchins|Ed Hutchins]] in his book ''Cognition in the Wild'', is that of navigating a naval ship.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, E., (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CGIaNc3F1MgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cognition in the wild]. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
The interpretations of these examples rely on the following [[Reason|logic]]: (1) the total system captures embodiment; (2) one or more agent systems capture the intrinsic dynamics of individual agents; (3) the complete behavior of an agent can be understood as a change to the agent's intrinsic dynamics in relation to its situation in the environment; and (4) the paths of an open dynamical system can be interpreted as representational processes.  These embodied cognition examples show the importance of studying the emergent dynamics of an agent-environment systems, as well as the intrinsic dynamics of agent systems.  Rather than being at odds with traditional cognitive science approaches, dynamical systems are a natural extension of these methods and should be studied in parallel rather than in competition.

'''Concurrent MetateM''' is a [[Multi-agent system|multi-agent]] language in which each agent is programmed using a set of (augmented) [[temporal logic]] specifications of the behaviour it should exhibit. These specifications are executed directly to generate the behaviour of the agent. As a result, there is no risk of invalidating the logic as with systems where logical specification must first be translated to a lower-level implementation.

The root of the MetateM concept is [[Gabbay's separation theorem]]; any arbitrary temporal logic formula can be rewritten in a [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] ''past&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;future'' form. Execution proceeds by a process of continually matching rules against a history, and ''firing'' those rules when [[Antecedent (logic)|antecedent]]s are satisfied. Any instantiated future-time consequents become commitments which must subsequently be satisfied, iteratively generating a model for the formula made up of the program rules.

==Temporal Connectives==
The Temporal Connectives of Concurrent MetateM can divided into two categories, as follows:

* Strict past time connectives: '●' (weak last), '◎' (strong last), '◆' (was), '■' (heretofore), {{'}}''S''{{'}} (since), and {{'}}''Z''{{'}} (zince, or  weak since).
* Present and future time connectives: '◯' (next), '◇' (sometime), '□' (always), {{'}}''U''{{'}} (until), and {{'}}''W''{{'}} (unless).

The connectives {◎,●,◆,■,◯,◇,□} are unary; the remainder are binary.

===Strict past time connectives===

====Weak last====
'''●ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ was true in the previous time. If ●ρ is interpreted at the beginning of time, it is satisfied despite there being no actual previous time.  Hence "weak" last.

====Strong last====
'''◎ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ was true in the previous time.  If ◎ρ is interpreted at the beginning of time, it is not satisfied because there is no actual previous time.  Hence "strong" last.

====Was====
'''◆ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ was true in any previous moment in time.

====Heretofore====
'''■ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ was true in every previous moment in time.

====Since====
'''ρ''S''ψ''' is satisfied now if ψ is true at any previous moment and ρ is true at every moment after that moment.

====Zince, or weak since====
'''ρ''Z''ψ''' is satisfied now if (ψ is true at any previous moment and ρ is true at every moment after that moment) OR ψ has not happened in the past.

===Present and future time connectives===

====Next====
'''◯ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ is true in the next moment in time.

====Sometime====
'''◇ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ is true now or in any future moment in time.

====Always====
□'''ρ''' is satisfied now if ρ is true now and in every future moment in time.

====Until====
'''ρ''U''ψ''' is satisfied now if ψ is true at any future moment and ρ is true at every moment prior.

====Unless====
'''ρ''W''ψ''' is satisfied now if (ψ is true at any future moment and ρ is true at every moment prior) OR ψ does not happen in the future.

''' David Andrew Sinclair''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} (born ca 1969)&lt;ref name=MIT2007/&gt; is an [[Australia]]n [[biologist]] and professor of genetics best known for his advocacy for [[resveratrol]] as an [[anti-aging]] [[dietary supplement]] and potential drug.

==Early life==
David Andrew Sinclair was born in Australia around 1969, and he grew up in [[St Ives, New South Wales]]; his paternal grandmother had immigrated to Australia following the suppression of the  [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]] and his father changed the family name from Szigeti to Sinclair.&lt;ref name=MIT2007/&gt;

==Education and career==
Sinclair obtained a Bachelor of Science at the [[University of New South Wales]], Sydney, and received the Australian Commonwealth Prize. In 1995, he received a Ph.D. in Molecular Genetics from the same school,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Sinclair|url=http://genetics.med.harvard.edu/sinclair/people/sinclair.php|publisher=The Sinclair Lab,  Harvard Medical School, Department of Genetics|accessdate=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on gene regulation in yeast.&lt;ref name=MIT2007/&gt;  In 1993 he met [[Leonard P. Guarente]], an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] professor who studied genes involved in the regulation of aging, when Guarente was on a lecture tour in Australia, and the meeting spurred Sinclair to apply for a post-doc position in Guarente's lab.&lt;ref name=MIT2007/&gt;  Earlier that year [[Cynthia Kenyon]]'s lab at UCSF had discovered that a single-gene mutation in ([[Daf-2]]) could double the lifespan of ''C. elegans''.&lt;ref name=MIT2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Duncan|first1=David Ewing|title=The Enthusiast|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/408433/the-enthusiast/|work=MIT Technology Review|date=August 15, 2007|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 Sinclair was hired at [[Harvard Medical School]].&lt;ref name=MIT2007/&gt;  In 2003 his lab was small and struggling for funding.&lt;ref name=MIT2007/&gt;  In 2004 Sinclair met with the philanthropist [[Paul F. Glenn]] who donated $5 million to Harvard to establish the Paul F. Glenn Laboratories for the Biological Mechanisms of Aging at Harvard, of which Sinclair became the founding Director. He currently serves as the co-Director with Bruce Yankner.&lt;ref name=MIT2007/&gt;

In 2004 Sinclair, along with serial entrepreneur [[Andrew Perlman]], [[Christoph Westphal]], Richard Aldrich, Richard Pops, and Paul Schimmel, founded [[Sirtris Pharmaceuticals]].&lt;ref name=Science2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Couzin|first1=J|title=Scientific community.

One hundred years from now, people will maybe be taking these molecules on a daily basis to prevent heart disease, stroke, and cancer.”&lt;ref name=Science2004/&gt;  Most of the anti-aging field was more cautious, especially with regard to what else resveratrol might do in the body and its lack of [[bioavailability]].&lt;ref name=Science2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2009&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wade|first1=Nicholas|title=Tests Begin on Drugs That May Slow Aging|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/18/science/18aging.html?8dpc|work=The New York Times|date=17 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company's initial product was called SRT501, and was a formulation of resveratrol.;&lt;ref name=Xconomy2010&gt;{{cite news|last1=McBride|first1=Ryan|title=Former Sirtris Execs' Nonprofit Starts Selling Resveratrol with Potential Anti-Aging Effects Online|url=http://www.xconomy.com/boston/2010/08/12/former-sirtris-execs-nonprofit-starts-selling-resveratrol-with-potential-anti-aging-effects-online/?single_page=true|work=Xconomy|date=12 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sirtris went public in 2007 and was subsequently purchased and made a subsidiary of [[GlaxoSmithKline]] in 2008 for $720 million.&lt;ref name=Fierce2013&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=John|last2=McBride|first2=Ryan|title=UPDATED: GSK moves to shutter Sirtris' Cambridge office, integrate R&amp;D|url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/r-d/updated-gsk-moves-to-shutter-sirtris-cambridge-office-integrate-r-d|work=FierceBiotech|date=Mar 12, 2013|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/news/2013/03/gsk-absorbs-controversial-longevity-company.html|title=GSK absorbs controversial ‘longevity’ company : News blog|publisher=Nature Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 [[Genocea Biosciences]] was founded based on work of Harvard scientist [[Darren E. Higgins]] around antigens that stimulate [[T cells]] and the use of these antigens to create vaccines;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richtel|first1=Matt|title=Warding Off Diseases, Many Vaccines at a Time|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/business/smallbusiness/16genocea.html?mcubz=0|work=The New York Times|date=16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinclair was a co-founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McBride|first1=Ryan|title=Polaris' Bitterman is humble about his early VC success|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/blog/mass-high-tech/2008/05/polaris-bitterman-is-humble-about-his-early.html|work=Boston Business Journal|date=May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Sinclair was promoted to tenured professor at Harvard Medical School.&lt;ref name=NSWprofile/&gt; He also became a professor at the [[University of New South Wales]].&lt;ref name=NSWprofile&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medicalsciences.med.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-david-sinclair|title=Professor David Sinclair {{!}} School of Medical Sciences|website=medicalsciences.med.unsw.edu.au|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2008 Sinclair joined the scientific advisory board of [[Shaklee]] and helped them devise and introduce a product containing resveratrol called "Vivix"; after the ''Wall Street Journal'' requested an interview about his work with the company and its marketing, he disputed the use of his name and words to promote the supplement, and resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Jacob|title=Harvard Researcher Tied to Shaklee ‘Anti-Aging Tonic’ Vivix|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2008/12/26/harvard-researcher-tied-to-shaklee-anti-aging-tonic-vivix/|work=WSJ|date=26 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Sinclair was a co-founder of [[OvaScience]] with [[Michelle Dipp]] (who had been involved with Sirtris), Aldrich, Westphal, and Jonathan Tilly, based on scientific work done by Tilly concerning mammalian [[oogonial stem cells]] and work on [[mitochondria]] by Sinclair.&lt;ref name=S1&gt;{{cite web|title=OvaScience S-1|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1544227/000104746912008575/a2210793zs-1.htm|publisher=OvaScience via SEC Edgar|date=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TechRev20161209&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weintraub|first1=Karen|title=Can fertility startup OvaScience really help women conceive late in life, as promised?|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/603065/rejuvenating-the-chance-of-motherhood/|work=MIT Technology Review|date=December 9, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tilly's work was controversial, with some groups unable to replicate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grieve|first=Kelsey M.|last2=McLaughlin|first2=Marie|last3=Dunlop|first3=Cheryl E.|last4=Telfer|first4=Evelyn E.|author-link4=Evelyn Telfer|last5=Anderson|first5=Richard A.|date=|title=The controversial existence and functional potential of oogonial stem cells|url=|journal=Maturitas|volume=82|issue=3|pages=278–281|doi=10.1016/j.maturitas.2015.07.017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powell|first1=K|title=Born or made?

In 2011 Sinclair was also a co-founder of [[CohBar]], along with [[Nir Barzilai]] and other colleagues; CoBar aimed to discover and develop novel peptides derived from mitochondria.&lt;ref name=Scientist/&gt; 

In 2015 Sinclair described to ''The Scientist'' his efforts to get funding for his lab, how his lab grew to around 20 people, shrunk back down to about 5, and then grew again as he brought in funding from philanthropic organizations and companies, including companies that he helped to start.&lt;ref name=Scientist&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grant|first1=Bob|title=Follow the Funding|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/42799/title/Follow-the-Funding/|work=The Scientist|date=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2015 his lab had 22 people and was supported by one R01 grant and was 75% funded by non-federal funds. &lt;ref name=Scientist/&gt;

In 2018 Sinclair was made an Officer of the [[Order of Australia]] (AO) for "distinguished service to medical research into the biology of ageing and lifespan extension, as a geneticist and academic, to biosecurity initiatives, and as an advocate for the study of science"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://honours.pmc.gov.au/honours/awards/2000557|title=Australia Day 2018 Honours List|last=Sinclair|first=Andrew David|date=26 January 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Research==
While Sinclair was in Guarente's lab, he discovered that [[Sirtuin 1]] (called ''sir2'' in yeast) slows aging in yeast by reducing the accumulation of [[extrachromosomal rDNA circle]]s.  Others working in the lab at the time identified [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide |NAD]] as an essential [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] for sirtuin function.&lt;ref name=MIT2007/&gt;  In 2002 after he had left for Harvard, he clashed with Guarente at a scientific meeting at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, challenging Guarante's description of how ''sir2'' might be involved in aging; this set off a scientific rivalry.&lt;ref name=Science2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Couzin|first1=J|title=Scientific community. Aging research's family feud.|journal=Science |date=27 February 2004|volume=303|issue=5662|pages=1276–9|doi=10.1126/science.303.5662.1276|pmid=14988530|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/303/5662/1276.full?ijkey=boCCM4akb2Rj6&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, when his lab was still small, Sinclair learned that scientists at a Pennsylvania biotech company called Biomol Research Laboratories discovered that [[polyphenol]]s including resveratrol could activate ''sir2'', and he collaborated with them to confirm this.&lt;ref name=MIT2007/&gt;   This led to publications authored in part by Sinclair in both ''Nature'' and ''Science'' in 2003.&lt;ref name=Science2004/&gt;  Sinclair's outspoken advocacy for resveratrol as an anti-aging compound started a scientific controversy over whether this was true, and whether resveratrol even activated sirtuins.&lt;ref name=MIT2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Science2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wallace|first1=Benjamin|title=An MIT Scientist Claims That This Pill Is the Fountain of Youth|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/08/is-elysium-healths-basis-the-fountain-of-youth.html|work=New York Magazine|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Work in another lab, done partially funding from Sirtris, found increases in the number of mitochondria in the cells of mice given high doses of resveratrol.&lt;ref name=MIT2007/&gt;  Sinclair's lab continued to work on reservatrol and analogs of it, as well as on mitochondria and NAD, all directed to understanding aging and how to prevent it.&lt;ref name=Wallace/&gt;

In classical [[Freudian]] [[psychoanalytic theory]], the '''death drive''' ({{lang-de|Todestrieb}}) is the [[Drive theory|drive]] toward death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by [[Sabina Spielrein]] in her paper "Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |date=April 1994 |title=Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being |journal=Journal of Analytical Psychology |volume=39 |issue=2 |pages=155–186 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-5922.1994.00155.x}} [http://www.arizonapsychoanalyticsociety.com/downloads/sabrina.pdf Free pdf of the full essay] by the Arizona Psychoanalytic Society.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |year=1995 |title=Destruction as Cause of Becoming |journal=Psychoanalysis and Contemporary Thought |volume=18 |issue= |pages=85–118|doi= |url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=pct.018.0085a}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens'')&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite journal |last=Spielrein |first=Sabina |year=1912 |title=''Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens'' |journal=Jahrbuch für Psychoanalytische und Psychopathologische Forschungen |volume=IV |issue= |pages=465–503 |doi= |url=https://archive.org/stream/JahrbuchFuumlrPsychoanalytischeUndPsychopathologischeForschungenIv_509/JdP_IV_1912_1_Haelfte#page/n467/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1912, which was then taken up by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1920 in ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]].'' This concept has been translated as "opposition between the ego or death [[instinct]]s and the sexual or life instincts".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Beyond the Pleasure Principle" in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex 1987), p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Pleasure Principle'', Freud used the plural "death drives" (''Todestriebe'') much more frequently than in the singular.&lt;ref&gt;See occurrences of [https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=%22death+drives%22 "death drives"] and of [https://books.google.com/?id=LQcUz3FVkNQC&amp;q=%22death+drive%22 "death drive"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The death drive opposes [[Eros (concept)#Sigmund Freud|Eros]], the tendency toward survival, propagation, sex, and other creative, life-producing drives. The death drive is sometimes referred to as "[[Thanatos]]" in post-Freudian thought, complementing "Eros", although this term was not used in Freud's own work, being rather introduced by [[Wilhelm Stekel]] in 1909 and then by [[Paul Federn]] in the present context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Ernest |authorlink=Ernest Jones |title=The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud.

The Standard Edition of Freud's works in English confuses two terms that are different in German, ''Instinkt'' ("instinct") and ''Trieb'' ("drive"), often translating both as ''instinct''; for example, "the hypothesis of a ''death instinct'', the task of which is to lead organic life back into the inanimate state".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "The Ego and the Id", in ''On Metapsychology'' (Middlesex, 1987), p. 380.&lt;/ref&gt; "This equating of ''instinkt'' and ''Trieb'' has created serious misunderstandings".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'', (London, 1946), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laplanche, Jean; Pontalis, Jean-Bertrand (1988) [1973]. "[https://books.google.com/?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=%22Instinct+(or+Drive)+=+I.+D.:+Instinkt%22%22D.:+Trieb%22 Instinct (or Drive) (pp. 214-7).]"&lt;/ref&gt; Freud actually refers to the term "instinkt" in explicit use elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Nagera |editor-first=Humberto |chapter=Instinct and Drive (pp. 19ff.) |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/?id=qbWuAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=%22Instinct+and+Drive%22 |title=Basic Psychoanalytic Concepts on the Theory of Instincts |url=https://books.google.com/?id=qbWuAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |year=2014 |origyear=[https://books.google.com/?id=qnowAAAAIAAJ 1970] |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames]] |isbn=978-1-317-67045-2 |id={{ISBN|1-31767045-0}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and so while the concept of "instinct" can loosely be referred to as a "drive," any essentialist or naturalist connotations of the term should be put in abeyance. In a sense, the death drive is a force that is not essential to the life of an organism (unlike an "instinct") and tends to denature it or make it behave in ways that are sometimes counter-intuitive. In other words, the term death "drive" is simply a false representation of death instinct. The term is almost universally known in scholarly literature on Freud as the "death drive", and Lacanian psychoanalysts often shorten it to simply "drive" (although Freud posited the existence of other drives as well, and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] explicitly states in Seminar XI that all drives are partial to the death drive).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The four fundamental concepts of psychoanalysis|last=|first=|publisher=W.W. Norton|year=|isbn=9780393317756|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Penguin translations of Freud translate ''Trieb'' and ''Instinkt'' as "drive" and "instinct" respectively.

==Origin of the theory: ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''==
{{Main|Beyond the Pleasure Principle}}
{{Anchors|origin}}It was a basic premise of Freud's that "the course taken by mental events is automatically regulated by the pleasure principle...[associated] with an avoidance of unpleasure or a production of pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond the Pleasure Principle", p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Three main types of conflictual evidence, difficult to explain satisfactorily in such terms, led Freud late in his career to look for another principle in mental life ''beyond'' the [[pleasure principle (psychology)|pleasure principle]]—a search that would ultimately lead him to the concept of the death drive.

The first problem Freud encountered was the phenomenon of repetition in (war) trauma. When Freud worked with people with [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] (particularly the trauma experienced by soldiers returning from [[World War I]]), he observed that subjects often tended to repeat or re-enact these traumatic experiences: "dreams occurring in traumatic have the characteristic of repeatedly bringing the patient back into the situation of his accident",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to the expectations of the pleasure principle.

A second problematic area was found by Freud in children's [[Play (activity)|play]] (such as the ''Fort/Da'' [Forth/here] game played by Freud's grandson, who would stage and re-stage the disappearance of his mother and even himself). "How then does his repetition of this distressing experience as a game fit in with the pleasure principle?"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third problem came from clinical practice.  Freud found his patients, dealing with painful experiences that had been repressed, regularly "obliged to ''repeat'' the repressed material as a contemporary experience instead of [...] ''remembering'' it as something belonging to the past".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond" p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with what he called "the compulsion of destiny [...] come across [in] people all of whose human relationships have the same outcome",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond" p. 294 and p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt; such evidence led Freud "to justify the hypothesis of a compulsion to repeat—something that would seem more primitive, more elementary, more instinctual than the pleasure principle which it over-rides".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

He then set out to find an explanation of such a compulsion; in Freud's own words, "What follows is speculation, often far-fetched speculation, which the reader will consider or dismiss according to his individual predilection".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 295.&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking a new instinctual paradigm for such problematic repetition, he found it ultimately in "''an urge in organic life to restore an earlier state of things''"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt;—the inorganic state from which life originally emerged. From the conservative, restorative character of instinctual life, Freud derived his death drive, with its "pressure towards death", and the resulting "separation of the death instincts from the life instincts"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", pp. 316 and 322.&lt;/ref&gt; seen in Eros. The death drive then manifested itself in the individual creature as a force "whose function is to assure that the organism shall follow its own path to death".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking further potential clinical support for the existence of such a self-destructive force, Freud found it through a reconsideration of his views of masochism—previously "regarded as sadism that has been turned round upon the subject's own ego"—so as to allow that "there ''might'' be such a thing as primary masochism—a possibility which I had contested"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt; before. Even with such support, however, he remained very tentative to the book's close about the provisional nature of his theoretical construct: what he called "the whole of our artificial structure of hypotheses".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Beyond", p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Spielrein's paper was published in 1912, Freud initially resisted the concept as he considered it to be too Jungian. Nevertheless, Freud eventually adopted the concept, and in later years would build extensively upon the tentative foundations he had set out in ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle''. In ''[[The Ego and the Id]]'' (1923) he would develop his argument to state that "the death instinct would thus seem to express itself—though probably only in part—as an ''instinct of destruction'' directed against the external world".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Ego/Id", p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; The following year he would spell out more clearly that the "libido has the task of making the destroying instinct innocuous, and it fulfils the task by diverting that instinct to a great extent outwards [...]. The instinct is then called the destructive instinct, the instinct for mastery, or the will to power",&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "The Economic Problem of Masochism" in ''On Metapsychology'', p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; a perhaps much more recognisable set of manifestations.

At the close of the decade, in ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' (1930), Freud acknowledged that "To begin with it was only tentatively that I put forward the views I have developed here, but in the course of time they have gained such a hold upon me that I can no longer think in any other way".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, "Civilization and Its Discontents", in ''Civilization, Society and Religion'' (Middlesex, 1987), p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
{{see also|Arthur Schopenhauer#Philosophy of the "Will"{{!}}Philosophy of the "Will" in Schopenhauer}}
From a philosophical perspective, the death drive may be viewed in relation to the work of the German philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. His philosophy, expounded in ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1818) postulates that all exists by a metaphysical "will" (more clearly, a '''will to live'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Schopenhauer |first=Arthur |title=The World as Will and Presentation |others=Translated by Richard E. Aquila and David Carus |location= New York |publisher= Longman |year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and that pleasure affirms this will. Schopenhauer's [[pessimism]] led him to believe that the affirmation of the "will" was a negative and immoral thing, due to his belief of life producing more suffering than happiness. The death drive would seem to manifest as a natural and psychological negation of the "will".

Freud was well aware of such possible linkages. In a letter of 1919, he wrote that regarding "the theme of death, [that I] have stumbled onto an odd idea via the drives and must now read all sorts of things that belong to it, for instance Schopenhauer".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Peter Gay, ''Freud: A life for our time'' (London, 1989), p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, [[Ernest Jones]] (who like many analysts was not convinced of the need for the death drive, over and above an instinct of aggression) considered that "Freud seemed to have landed in the position of Schopenhauer, who taught that 'death is the goal of life'".&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Jones, ''The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud'' (London, 1964), p. 508.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as Freud put it to the imagined auditors of his ''New Introductory Lectures'' (1932), "You may perhaps shrug your shoulders and say: "That isn't natural science, it's Schopenhauer's philosophy!" But, ladies and gentlemen, why should not a bold thinker have guessed something that is afterwards confirmed by sober and painstaking detailed research?"&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (London, 1991), pp. 140-1.&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to add that "what we are saying is not even genuine Schopenhauer....we are not overlooking the fact that there is life as well as death. We recognise two basic instincts and give each of them its own aim".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural application: ''Civilization and Its Discontents''==
{{Main|Civilization and Its Discontents}}
Freud applied his new theoretical construct in ''Civilization and Its Discontents'' (1930) to the difficulties inherent in [[western culture|Western civilization]]—indeed, in civilization and in social life as a whole. In particular, given that "a portion of the [death] instinct is diverted towards the external world and comes to light as an instinct of aggressiveness', he saw 'the inclination to aggression [...] [as] the greatest impediment to civilization".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'' pp. 310 and 313.&lt;/ref&gt; The need to overcome such aggression entailed the formation of the [cultural] superego: "We have even been guilty of the heresy of attributing the origin of conscience to this diversion inwards of aggressiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, "Why War?" in ''Civilization'', p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;  The presence thereafter in the individual of the superego and a related sense of guilt—"Civilization, therefore, obtains mastery over the individual's dangerous desire for aggression by [...] setting up an agency within him to watch over it"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;—leaves an abiding sense of uneasiness inherent in civilized life, thereby providing a structural explanation for 'the suffering of civilized man'.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London, 1997), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud made a further connection between [[Group (sociology)|group]] life and innate aggression, where the former comes together more closely by directing aggression to other groups, an idea later picked up by group analysts like [[Wilfred Bion]].

==Continuing development of Freud's views==
In the closing decade of Freud's life, it has been suggested, his view of the death drive changed somewhat, with "the stress much more upon the death instinct's manifestations ''outwards''".&lt;ref&gt;Albert Dickson, "Editor's Introduction", ''Civilization'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  Given "the ubiquity of non-erotic aggressivity and destructiveness", he wrote in 1930, "I adopt the standpoint, therefore, that the inclination to aggression is an original, self-subsisting instinctual disposition in man".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', pp. 311 and 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 he conceded of his original formulation of the death drive 'the improbability of our speculations.  A queer instinct, indeed, directed to the destruction of its own organic home!'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote moreover that "Our hypothesis is that there are two essentially different classes of instincts: the sexual instincts, understood in the widest sense—Eros, if you prefer that name—and the aggressive instincts, whose aim is destruction".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''New'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, he went so far as to suggest privately that 'We should have a neat schematic picture if we supposed that originally, at the beginning of life, all libido was directed to the inside and all aggressiveness to the outside'.&lt;ref&gt;Freud quoted by Dickson, ''Civilization'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his last writings, it was the contrast of "two basic instincts, ''Eros'' and ''the destructive instinct'' [...] our two primal instincts, ''Eros'' and ''destructiveness'',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Standard Edition'' vol. xxiii (London 1964), pp. 148 and 246.&lt;/ref&gt; on which he laid stress.  Nevertheless, his belief in "the death instinct [...] [as] a return to an earlier state [...] into an inorganic state"&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''SE'', xxiii, pp. 148-9.&lt;/ref&gt; continued to the end.

==Analytic reception==
As Freud wryly commented in 1930, "The assumption of the existence of an instinct of death or destruction has met with resistance even in analytic circles".&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''Civilization'', p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Ernest Jones would comment of ''Beyond the Pleasure Principle'' that the book not only "displayed a boldness of speculation that was unique in all his writings" but was "further noteworthy in being the only one of Freud's which has received little acceptance on the part of his followers".&lt;ref&gt;Jones, ''Life'', p. 505.&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Fenichel in his compendious survey of the first Freudian half-century concluded that "the facts on which Freud based his concept of a death instinct in no way necessitate the assumption [...] of a genuine self-destructive instinct".&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (London, 1946), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinz Hartmann]] set the tone for [[ego psychology]] when he "chose to [...] do without 'Freud's other, mainly biologically oriented set of hypotheses of the "life" and "death instincts"'".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gay, ''Freud'', pp. 402-3n.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[object relations theory]], among the independent group 'the most common repudiation was the loathsome notion of the death instinct'.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Appignanesi, ed., ''Introducing Melanie Klein'' (Cambridge, 2006), p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeed, "for most analysts Freud's idea of a primitive urge towards death, of a primary masochism, was [...] bedevilled by problems".&lt;ref&gt;Gay, ''Freud'', p. 402.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, the concept has been defended, extended, and carried forward by some analysts, generally those tangential to the psychoanalytic mainstream; while among the more orthodox, arguably of "those who, in contrast to most other analysts, take Freud's doctrine of the death drive seriously, K. R. Eissler has been the most persuasive—or least unpersuasive".&lt;ref&gt;Gay, p. 768.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Melanie Klein]] and her immediate followers considered that "the infant is exposed from birth to the anxiety stirred up by the inborn polarity of instincts—the immediate conflict between the life instinct and the death instinct";&lt;ref name=Segal&gt;[[Hanna Segal]], ''Introduction to the work of Melanie Klein'' (London, 1964), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and Kleinians indeed built much of their theory of early childhood around the outward deflection of the latter. "This deflection of the death instinct, described by Freud, in Melanie Klein's view consists partly of a projection, partly of the conversion of the death instinct into aggression".&lt;ref name=Segal /&gt;

French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], for his part, castigated the "refusal to accept this culminating point of Freud's doctrine [...] by those who conduct their analysis on the basis of a conception of the ''ego'' [...] that death instinct whose enigma Freud propounded for us at the height of his experience".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'', p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, he stressed the linguistic aspects of the death drive: "the symbol is substituted for death in order to take possession of the first swelling of life [...]. There is therefore no further need to have recourse to the outworn notion of primordial masochism in order to understand the reason for the repetitive games in [...] his ''Fort!'' and in his ''Da!''."&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, ''Ecrits'' pp. 124 and 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eric Berne]] too would proudly proclaim that he, "besides having repeated and confirmed the conventional observations of Freud, also believes right down the line with him concerning the death instinct, and the pervasiveness of the [[repetition compulsion]]".&lt;ref&gt;Eric Berne, ''What Do You say After You Say Hello?'' (London, 1975) pp. 399-400.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the twenty-first century, "the death drive today [...] remains a highly controversial theory for many psychoanalysts [...] [almost] as many opinions as there are psychoanalysts".&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London, 2005), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's conceptual opposition of death and eros drives in the human psyche was applied by Walter A. Davis in ''Deracination: Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative''&lt;ref name=Adams01&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Walter A.|title=Deracination; Historicity, Hiroshima, and the Tragic Imperative|date=2001|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0-79144834-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Death's Dream Kingdom: The American Psyche since 9/11.''&lt;ref name=Adam02&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Walter A.|title=Death's Dream Kingdom|date=2006|publisher=Pluto Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-74532468-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis described social reactions to both Hiroshima and 9/11 from the Freudian viewpoint of the death force. Unless they consciously take responsibility for the damage of those reactions, Davis claims that Americans will repeat them.

'''Philip Cairns''' (born 1 September 1973) disappeared on the afternoon of 23 October 1986 while walking back to school in south [[Dublin]], Ireland. The 13-year-old schoolboy left his home in [[Ballyroan, Dublin|Ballyroan]] to return to school, but has not been seen since. A large-scale investigation was carried out but no trace of the boy has ever been found.&lt;ref name="Ireland's disappeared people"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/irelands-disappeared-people-1248524.html|title=Ireland's disappeared people|date=16 December 2007|accessdate=4 June 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="'The next victim has every chance of being your mother ... or even you'The team handling the Garda's 'cold case' inquiries faces huge obstacles, writes Jim Cusack"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/the-next-victim-has-every-chance-of-being-your-mom--or-even-youthe-team-handling----the-gardas-cold-case-inquiries-faces-huge-obstacles-writes-------jim-cusack-1210772.html|title='The next victim has every chance of being your mom ... or even you'The team handling the Garda's 'cold case' inquiries faces huge obstacles, writes Jim Cusack|date=4 November 2007|accessdate=4 June 2009|work=[[Irish Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His disappearance is now treated as a high-profile child murder case, the only similar incident in Ireland being the murder of [[Robert Holohan]] in January 2005.&lt;ref name="Profile of a killer: What clues reveal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/01/16/story1606.asp |title=Profile of a killer: What clues reveal |date=16 January 2005 |accessdate=4 June 2009 |publisher=''[[The Sunday Business Post]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060117154703/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/01/16/story1606.asp |archivedate=17 January 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most high-profile disappearances in recent Irish history.&lt;ref name="Search for Philip Cairns to continue for third day"/&gt;

Philip's family have issued numerous appeals for information. A reconstruction took place in 2007 and was later televised on [[RTÉ One]], while a reward of €10,000 has also been offered. The book, ''[[When Heaven Waits]]'', published in 2007, featured an interview with Philip's mother. Nobody has ever been arrested.&lt;ref name="Search for Philip Cairns to continue for third day"/&gt; The case remains open.

{{Quote box | width=30% | align=right | quote="The very sad fact is that life went on after we lost Philip.

Philip Cairns disappeared while returning to school in [[Rathfarnham]].&lt;ref name="Fresh appeal from family of Philip Cairns (2006-10-23)"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Land searched in Cairns disappearance"/&gt; He had departed [[Coláiste Éanna]] secondary school at 12:45 to go home for lunch.&lt;ref name="Gardaí begin new dig for missing boy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Search for missing schoolboy extended"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardai to search woods for body in 22-year-old case"/&gt; He left his home at 13:30 to return to Coláiste Éanna.&lt;ref name="Gardaí begin new dig for missing boy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Search for missing schoolboy extended"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardai to search woods for body in 22-year-old case"/&gt; There have been no confirmed sightings of the boy since.&lt;ref name="Gardaí begin new dig for missing boy"/&gt; His family believe he was abducted by someone who knew him personally.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt;

Speculation at his school the day after his disappearance had Philip being kidnapped by a "bad man" who had offered him sweets then lured him into a van.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt;

== Investigation ==
Several hundred [[Garda Síochána]] officers and divers took part in a large-scale search of forests, lakes, mountains and rivers.&lt;ref name="Gardaí begin new dig for missing boy"/&gt; Psychics and clairvoyants were called in to assist.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt; Posters were distributed by milk companies.&lt;ref name="Area excavated in Philip Cairns probe"/&gt; Cairns' classmates were interviewed by Gardaí at the school during their mid-term holiday break the following week.&lt;ref name="Area excavated in Philip Cairns probe"/&gt;

Six days after his disappearance, Philip's school bag was located by two girls in an alley close to his house.&lt;ref name="Gardaí begin new dig for missing boy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Search for missing schoolboy extended"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Family continue search 21 years on"/&gt; The lane had already been searched, and the bag was not there at that time.&lt;ref name="Search for Philip Cairns to continue for third day"/&gt; The school bag was thought to hold vital clues, but nothing is known of how it came to be in the lane.&lt;ref name="Fresh appeal from family of Philip Cairns (2006-10-23)"/&gt; It is thought the bag had been left there a short time previously.&lt;ref name="Fresh appeal in Cairns disappearance case"/&gt; It was examined forensically but no clues were located.  Philip's implements, including pens, pencils, copybook, maths textbook, school journal and his pencil case were within.&lt;ref name="Land searched in Cairns disappearance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fresh appeal in Cairns disappearance case"/&gt; Some of Philip's books were missing, including a geography book and two religion books.&lt;ref name="Search for Philip Cairns to continue for third day"/&gt;&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Search for missing schoolboy extended"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardai to search woods for body in 22-year-old case"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Family continue search 21 years on"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fresh appeal in Cairns disappearance case"/&gt; A forensic examination produced no clues as to Philip's whereabouts.&lt;ref name="Search for missing schoolboy extended"/&gt; Gardaí have sealed the bag and it is now locked in a safe.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schoolbag may hold DNA clue to disappearance 20 years ago"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/schoolbag-may-hold-dna-clue-to-disappearance-20-years-ago-74686.html|title=Schoolbag may hold DNA clue to disappearance 20 years ago|date=23 May 2006|accessdate=4 June 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 400 sightings were reported in the aftermath of the boy's disappearance.&lt;ref name="Gardaí begin new dig for missing boy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Area excavated in Philip Cairns probe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.ie/breakingnews/ireland/eyausngbqlcw/|title=Area excavated in Philip Cairns probe|date=6 May 2009|accessdate=4 June 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Examiner]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one, Philip was reportedly seen in [[Manchester]] in the United Kingdom after his disappearance.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt; Each sighting was seriously investigated, but none led to Philip.

Philip's parents appeared regularly on the news and clutched what has now become a well-recognised picture of a smiling Philip in his [[Confirmation]] clothes of a blue jacket and a red rosette.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt; This photo has been deemed a precursor to that of British infant [[Disappearance of Madeleine McCann|Madeleine McCann]], who disappeared in [[Portugal]] 21 years later.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt; However, the family, unlike the McCanns, have been relatively private about their loss, speaking to the media on only a few occasions in the past 25 years.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt; It has been reported that this is due to several inaccurate reports of the incident of which they have disapproved.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt; Gardaí have, however, praised the media as a proven method for encouraging people to come forward with further information on the case each time an appeal is broadcast.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt; Residents' organisation ACRA also launched an intense campaign to attempt to find Philip.&lt;ref name="Family continue search 21 years on"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/family-continue-search-21-years-on-1208463.html|title=Family continue search 21 years on|date=23 October 2006|accessdate=4 June 2009|publisher=''[[Irish Independent]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theories have been reported by the media, most of which have been discounted by investigators. These have ranged from death by accident to Philip having been taken by extremists such as [[Pedophilia|paedophile]]s and [[Satanism|Satanist]]s.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt; One theory had a woman tell gardaí that her partner, an alleged paedophile, had killed Philip after abducting him.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt; This was later declared a false allegation.&lt;ref name="'I hoped every day, for months': Philip Cairns"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6931">'''Dmitriy Yurievich Shemyaka''' (Дмитрий Юрьевич Шемяка in [[Russian language|Russian]]) (died 1453) was the second son of [[Yury of Zvenigorod]] by Anastasia of [[Smolensk]] and grandson of [[Dmitri Donskoi]]. His hereditary patrimony was the rich Northern town [[Galich-Mersky]]. Shemyaka (1445, 1446–1447) was twice Grand Prince of [[Moscow]].

The causes of the [[Muscovite Civil War]] waged in the second quarter of the 15th century are still disputed. No small part, however, was played by [[Dmitri Donskoi]]'s will, which ran contrary to Rurikid dynastic custom whereby the throne would pass from an elder brother to a younger one ([[agnatic seniority]]), rather than from father to son ([[primogeniture]]). The testament provided for the accession of his son, Vasily I, which was still in keeping with the tradition of lateral succession since Vasily was the eldest of his generation.

In the event of Vasily having no surviving son at his death, his brother, Dmitry's second son, Yury of [[Zvenigorod]], was to succeed as grand prince in Moscow. Upon [[Vasily I]]'s death, however, Yury refused to come to Moscow and swear allegiance to his nephew, [[Vasily II]], and claimed the throne himself in accordance with his right under the long-held custom of lateral inheritance. (He further claimed it was provided for in Dmitry's testament – but this ignored the provision that voided Yury's succession in the event of Vasily I producing a son). Yury's son, Dmitry Shemyaka, actively participated in all of his father's incursions against Moscow, culminating in Yury's capture of Moscow and accession as grand prince in 1433. Yury of Zvenigorod died in Moscow in 1434.

[[Image:Meeting of Dmitry Shemyaka with Vasily II..jpg|thumb|250px|''Meeting of Shemyaka with Vasily II after the Latter's Blinding''.]]

After Yury's death, Shemyaka continued to press his branch's claim to the grand princely throne, and was seldom at peace with Vasily II. Initially, Dmitry and his younger brother [[Dmitry Krasnyi]] concluded an alliance with Vasily against their elder brother [[Vasily Kosoy]], who had proclaimed himself grand prince. They succeeded in driving Kosoy from [[Moscow]] and were rewarded with the towns of [[Uglich]] and [[Rzhev]]. The following year Shemyaka came to [[Moscow]] in order to invite [[Vasily II]] to his impending wedding with a princess of [[Yaroslavl]], but was accused of siding with Kosoy and taken prisoner. Released several months later, he was sent by Vasily II to defend [[Belyov]] against a small army of the [[Kazan Khanate|Kazan Khan]] [[Olug Moxammat]] but was defeated. Thereupon he refused to support Vasily in his hostilities against the khan, and only the mediation of a [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra|Trinity hegumen]] could forestall a new civil war between the cousins.

The two men maintained an uneasy peace for much of the next decade until 1445, when Vasily II was taken prisoner by Olug Moxammat after the Muscovite forces were surprised by the Tatar prince outside Suzdal, Shemyaka seized [[Moscow]], had the recently released Vasily blinded and proclaimed himself the Grand Prince of Vladimir. He could claim this by right of lateral inheritance since his father had sat on the throne. (A prince was excluded from the succession (izgoi) if his father had not sat on the throne before him.)  Shemyaka's lack of support among the Muscovite boyars forced him, however, to leave the city for [[Lake Chukhloma]], but he continued to press his claim to the grand princely throne.

Despite several peace treaties, Shemyaka continued to plot against his cousin. He suffered a series of defeats in 1450 and 1452 which forced him to seek refuge in [[Republic of Novgorod|Novgorod]]. There, on July 17, 1453, he was poisoned while eating a dinner of chicken in the Gorodishche, the princely compound south of the Market side of the city,&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Yanin,
"Posmertnaia Sudba Dmitriia Shemiaki," in ''Srednevekovyi Novgorod'' (Moscow: Nauka, 2004), 342.&lt;/ref&gt; his cook having been bribed by Muscovite agents. Delighted at the news, Vasily II ennobled a herald who had first brought him the message of Shemyaka's death. Nikolai Karamzin famously wrote in his history that the grand prince showed "indecent joy" at the news of his rival's untimely demise.

According to chronicle sources, Shemyaka was buried in the Church of St. George in the [[Yuriev Monastery]] south of Novgorod,
&lt;ref&gt;Yanin, "Posmertnaia Sudba Dmitriia Shemiaki," 342.&lt;/ref&gt; however, twentieth-century archaeological excavations of the necropolis of the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Cathedral of Holy Wisdom]] in the [[Novgorod Kremlin]] suggest that the prince was actually buried there and his grave has been misidentified since at least 1616 as that of Prince Fedor Yaroslavich (died 1233).&lt;ref&gt;Yanin, ''Nekropol' Novgorodskogo Sofiiskogo sobora: tserkovnaia traditsiia i istoricheskaia kritika'' (Moscow: Nauka, 1988), 89-113; Idem, "Posmertnaia Sudba Dmitriia Shemiaki", 337-346.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of Shemyaka's murder, his wife and son fled [[Novgorod]] to the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], where they were given [[Rylsk, Russia|Rylsk]] and [[Novgorod-Seversky]] in appanage.

Shemyaka's male line died out by 1561, but there are many living descendants from his daughter's marriage to Prince [[Czartoryski|Alexander Chertoryzhsky]].

Shemyaka's name survives in the [[Russian language|Russian]] expression "Shemyakin sud" ("Shemyaka's Justice", "Shemyaka's Judgement"), which means hasty and unfair judgement. It comes from the 17th century literary work ''The Tale of Shemyaka's Judgement'' (see its translation here&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=tV-27KrCerYC&amp;pg=PA183&amp;lpg=PA183&amp;dq=%22shemyaka+judg%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QKVxCHn4Tx&amp;sig=b26Km3iVYpgoybxpRtrCwelsfv4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eruTTL2nKI7CsAPSyojBCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "The Judgment of Shemyaka"]&lt;/ref&gt;). However modern researchers question the identification of Dmitry Shemyaka with Judge Shemyaka in the tale. &lt;!-- one may pick refs for this claim (and expand this bit) from the well-referenced page in Russian Wikipedia --&gt;

'''Enhanced biological phosphorus removal''' (EBPR) is a [[sewage treatment]] configuration applied to [[activated sludge]] systems for the removal of [[phosphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=Max Maurer | title=Erhöhte biologische Phosphorelimination | publisher=[[ETH Zurich]] | year=1996 | doi=10.3929/ethz-a-001755939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common element in EBPR implementations is the presence of an [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] tank ([[nitrate]] and [[oxygen]] are absent) prior to the [[aeration]] tank.  Under these conditions a group of [[heterotroph]]ic [[bacteria]], called [[polyphosphate-accumulating organisms]] (PAO) are selectively enriched in the bacterial community within the activated sludge. These bacteria accumulate large quantities of [[polyphosphate]] within their [[cell (biology)|cell]]s and the removal of phosphorus is said to be ''enhanced''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. |title=Wastewater engineering: treatment and reuse |year=2003 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=Boston |isbn=0070418780 |page=624 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, all bacteria contain a fraction (1-2%) of [[phosphorus]] in their [[biomass]] due to its presence in cellular components, such as [[Cell membrane|membrane]] [[phospholipid]]s and [[DNA]]. Therefore, as bacteria in a wastewater treatment plant consume nutrients in the wastewater, they grow and phosphorus is incorporated into the bacterial biomass. When PAOs grow they not only consume phosphorus for cellular components but also accumulate large quantities of polyphosphate within their cells. Thus, the phosphorus fraction of phosphorus accumulating biomass is 5-7%. This biomass is then separated from the treated water at end of the process and the phosphorus is thus removed.  Thus if PAOs are selectively enriched by the EBPR configuration, considerably more phosphorus is removed, compared to the relatively poor phosphorus removal in conventional activated sludge systems.

Some individuals show greater asymmetry than others.
]]
As a form of biological asymmetry, '''fluctuating asymmetry''' ('''FA'''), along with anti-symmetry and direction asymmetry, refers to small, random deviations away from perfect [[Symmetry in biology|bilateral symmetry]].&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valen1962"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valen|first=Leigh Van|title=A Study of Fluctuating Asymmetry|journal=Evolution|date=June 1962|volume=16|issue=2|pages=125–142|jstor=2406192|doi=10.2307/2406192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fluctuating Asymmetry|last=Tomkins|first=J. L.|last2=Kotiaho|first2=J. S.|publisher=Macmillan Publishers Ltd.|year=2001|isbn=|location=London|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deviation from perfection is thought to reflect the genetic and environmental pressures experienced throughout development, with greater pressures resulting in higher levels of asymmetry.&lt;ref name="Valen1962" /&gt; Examples of FA in the human body include unequal sizes (asymmetry) of bilateral features in the face and body, such as left and right eyes, ears, wrists, [[breast]]s, [[testicle]]s, and thighs.

Research has exposed multiple factors that are associated with FA. As measuring FA can indicate developmental stability, it can also suggest the genetic fitness of an individual. This can further have an effect on mate attraction and sexual selection, as less asymmetry reflects greater developmental stability and subsequent fitness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Human [[Health|physical health]] is also associated with FA. For example, young men with greater FA report more medical conditions than those with lower levels of FA.&lt;ref name="Fluctuating asymmetry and physical health among young adults" /&gt; Multiple other factors can be linked to FA, such as intelligence&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and personality traits.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Measurement ==
Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) can be measured by the equation: Mean FA = mean absolute value of left sides - mean absolute value of right sides.

The closer the mean value is to zero, the lower the levels of FA, indicating more symmetrical features. By taking many measurements of multiple traits per individual, this increases the accuracy in determining that individual's developmental stability. However, these traits must be chosen carefully, as different traits are affected by different selection pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patrice|first=D.|last2=Hingle|first2=A.|last3=Fowler|first3=K.|last4=Pomiankowski|first4=A.|date=1999|title=Measurement bias and fluctuating asymmetry estimates.|url=|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=57|issue=1|pages=251–253|doi=10.1006/anbe.1998.0977|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This equation can further be used to study the distribution of asymmetries at population levels, to distinguish between traits that show FA, directional asymmetry, and anti-symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swaddle|first=J. P.|date=2003|title=Fluctuating asymmetry, animal behaviour, and evolution.|url=|journal=Advances in the study of behaviour.|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=R.|last2=Strobeck|first2=C.|date=1992|title=Fluctuating asymmetry as a measure of developmental stability: Implications of non-normal distributions and power of statistical tests.|url=|journal=Acta Zoologica Fennica|pages=57–72|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of FA around a mean point of zero suggests that FA is not an adaptive trait, where symmetry is ideal. Directional asymmetry of traits can be distinguished by showing significantly biased measurements towards traits being larger on either the left or right sides, for example, human [[testicle]]s (where the right is more commonly larger), or handedness (85% are right handed, 15% are left handed). Anti-symmetry can be distinguished by the bimodal distributions, due to some adaptive functions.

== Causes ==
Fluctuating asymmetry (FA) is often considered to be the product of [[Developmental biology|developmental]] stress and instability, caused by both genetic and environmental stressors. The notion that FA is a result of genetic and environmental factors is supported by [[C. H. Waddington|Waddington's]] notion of [[Canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]], which implies that FA is a measure of the [[genome|genome's]] ability to successfully buffer development to achieve a normal [[phenotype]] under imperfect environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=WADDINGTON|first=C. H.|title=Canalization of Development and the Inheritance of Acquired Characters|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/150563a0|journal=Nature|volume=150|issue=3811|pages=563–565|doi=10.1038/150563a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various factors causing developmental instability and FA include [[infection]]s, [[mutation]]s, and [[toxin]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The evolutionary biology of human female sexuality|last=Thornhill, Gangestad|first=Randy, Steven W.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|isbn=0195340981|location=Oxford, England|pages=162–168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genetic factors ===
Research on [[twin]]s suggests that there are genetic influences on FA,&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Wendy|last2=Segal|first2=Nancy L.|last3=Bouchard Jr.|first3=Thomas J.|date=2008-05-01|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and general intelligence: No genetic or phenotypic association|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289607000967|journal=Intelligence|volume=36|issue=3|pages=279–288|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2007.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and increased levels of mutations and perturbations is also linked to greater asymmetry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

FA may also result from a lack of genetic immunity to diseases, as those with higher FA show less effective immune responses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is further supported by evidence showing an association between FA and the number of respiratory infections experienced by an individual, such that those with higher levels of FA experience more infections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Increased prevalence of parasites and diseases in an organism is also seen more in individuals with greater levels of FA.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fink|first=Bernhard|last2=Neave|first2=Nick|last3=Manning|first3=John T.|last4=Grammer|first4=Karl|date=2006-08-01|title=Facial symmetry and judgements of attractiveness, health and personality|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886906000973|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=41|issue=3|pages=491–499|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2006.01.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the research in this field is predominantly correlational, so caution must be taken when inferring causation. For example, rather than a lack of immunity causing FA, FA may weaken the immune responses of an organism, or there may be another factor involved.

There is some speculation that [[inbreeding]] contributes towards FA. One study on young Turkish males demonstrated that, although inbred individuals show more asymmetry in observed bilateral traits, the differences were not significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Özener|first=Bariş|date=2010-07-01|title=Effect of inbreeding depression on growth and fluctuating asymmetry in Turkish young males|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajhb.21046/abstract|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=557–562|doi=10.1002/ajhb.21046|issn=1520-6300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, ant colonies created by an inbreeding queen do not show significantly higher FA than those produced by a non-inbreeding queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keller|first=Laurent|last2=Passera|first2=Luc|date=1993-09-01|title=Incest avoidance, fluctuating asymmetry, and the consequences of inbreeding in Iridomyrmex humilis, an ant with multiple queen colonies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00216600|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=33|issue=3|pages=191–199|doi=10.1007/BF00216600|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental factors ===
Multiple sources provide information on environmental factors that are correlated with FA. A meta-analysis of related studies suggests that FA is an appropriate marker of environmental stress during development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beasley|first=De Anna E.|last2=Bonisoli-Alquati|first2=Andrea|last3=Mousseau|first3=Timothy A.|date=2013-07-01|title=The use of fluctuating asymmetry as a measure of environmentally induced developmental instability: A meta-analysis|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470160X13000988|journal=Ecological Indicators|volume=30|pages=218–226|doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence suggests that [[poverty]] and [[Malnutrition|lack of food]] during development may contribute to greater levels of FA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ozener|first=Bariş|date=2011-12-01|title=Does urban poverty increase body fluctuating asymmetry?|journal=Collegium Antropologicum|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1001–1005|issn=0350-6134|pmid=22397230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mallard|first=Samantha T.|last2=Barnard|first2=C. J.|date=2004-02-01|title=Food stress, fluctuating asymmetry and reproductive performance in the gryllid crickets Gryllus bimaculatus and Gryllodes sigillatus|url=http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156853904322890825|journal=Behaviour|volume=141|issue=2|pages=219–232|doi=10.1163/156853904322890825|issn=1568-539X}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Infection|Infectious diseases]] can also lead to FA, as studies have repeatedly shown that those with higher FA report more infections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Møller|first=Anders Pape|date=2006-03-01|title=A review of developmental instability, parasitism and disease: Infection, genetics and evolution|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S156713480500064X|journal=Infection, Genetics and Evolution|volume=6|issue=2|pages=133–140|doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2005.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, this association between levels of FA and infections may be due to a lack of immunity to diseases, as mentioned earlier (see 'Genetic factors'). Fluctuating asymmetry in human males is also seen to positively correlate with levels of [[oxidative stress]]. This process occurs when an organism creates excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to ROS-neutralising antioxidants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gangestad|first=Steven W.|last2=Merriman|first2=Leslie A.|last3=Emery Thompson|first3=Melissa|date=2010-12-01|title=Men’s oxidative stress, fluctuating asymmetry and physical attractiveness|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347210003416|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=80|issue=6|pages=1005–1013|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2010.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxidative stress may mediate the association seen between high FA and infection amounts during development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Toxins and poisons are considered to increase FA. [[Morning sickness|Pregnancy sickness]] is argued to be an [[adaptation]] for avoiding toxins during [[Prenatal development|foetal development]]. Research has reported that when a mother has no sickness or a sickness that extends beyond week 12 of gestation, the offspring shows higher FA (as demonstrated by measuring thigh circumferences). This suggests that when a mother fails to expel environmental toxins, this creates stress and developmental instability for the foetus, later leading to increased asymmetry in that individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Devendra|last2=Rosen|first2=Valerie C.|title=Effects of maternal body morphology, morning sickness, gestational diabetes and hypertension on fluctuating asymmetry in young women|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1090513801000824|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|volume=22|issue=6|pages=373–384|doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(01)00082-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greater exposure to [[pollution]] may also be a fundamental cause of FA. Research on skull characteristics of [[Grey seal|Baltic grey seals]] (''Halichoerus grypus'') demonstrated that those born after 1960 (marking an increase in environmental pollution) had increased levels of asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zakharov|first=Vladmir M.|last2=Yablokov|first2=Alexay V.|date=1990-01-01|title=Skull Asymmetry in the Baltic Grey Seal: Effects of Environmental Pollution|journal=Ambio|volume=19|issue=5|pages=266–269|jstor=4313708}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Greater white-toothed shrew|shrews]] (''Crocidura russula)'' from more polluted areas show higher levels of asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sánchez-Chardi|first=Alejandro|last2=García-Pando|first2=Marián|last3=López-Fuster|first3=María José|date=2013-10-01|title=Chronic exposure to environmental stressors induces fluctuating asymmetry in shrews inhabiting protected Mediterranean sites|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045653513008023|journal=Chemosphere|volume=93|issue=6|pages=916–923|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2013.05.056|pmid=23800592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radioactive contamination may also increase FA levels, as [[Yellow-necked mouse|mice]] (''Apodemus flavicollis'') living closer to the failed [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl reactor]] show greater asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Oleksyk|first=Taras K|last2=Novak|first2=James M|last3=Purdue|first3=James R|last4=Gashchak|first4=Sergiy P|last5=Smith|first5=Michael H|date=2004-01-01|title=High levels of fluctuating asymmetry in populations of Apodemus flavicollis from the most contaminated areas in Chornobyl|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X03002224|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity|volume=73|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2003.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developmental stability ==
Developmental stability is achieved when an organism is able to withstand genetic and environmental stress, to display the bilaterally symmetrical traits determined by its developmentally programmed phenotype.&lt;ref name="Valen1962" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Markow|first=Therese Ann|date=1995-01-01|title=Evolutionary Ecology and Developmental Instability|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.en.40.010195.000541|journal=Annual Review of Entomology|volume=40|issue=1|pages=105–120|doi=10.1146/annurev.en.40.010195.000541|pmid=&lt;!--none--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; To measure an individual's developmental stability, the FA measurements of 10 traits are added together, including ear width, elbows, ankles, wrists, feet, length of ears and fingers. This is achieved by: (L - R)trait 1 + (L - R)trait 2 + ......(L - R)trait 10. This provides a good overall measure of body FA, as every individual has some features that are not perfectly symmetrical.

Common environmental pressures leading to lower developmental stability include exposure to toxins, poison and infectious diseases, low food quality and malnutrition. Genetic pressures include spontaneous new mutations, and "bad genes" (genes that once had adaptive functions, but are being removed through evolutionary selection). A large fluctuating asymmetry (FA) and a low developmental stability suggests that an organism is unable to develop according to the ideal state of bilateral symmetry. The energy required for bilateral symmetry development is extremely high, making perfect bilateral symmetry rare. Energy is invested into survival in spite of the genetic and environmental pressures, before making bilaterally symmetrical traits. Research has also revealed links between FA and depression, genetic or environmental stress and measures of mate quality for sexual selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Graham | first1 = J.

==Health==

===Susceptibility to diseases===

Research has linked higher levels of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) to poorer outcomes in some domains of physical health in humans.

For example, studies have found that higher levels of facial asymmetry are associated with poorer overall health in female rhesus macaques (''Macaca mulatta''),&lt;ref name="FA and health in female macaques"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Little|first1=Anthony C.|last2=Paukner|first2=Annika|last3=Woodward|first3=Ruth A.|last4=Suomi|first4=Stephen J.|title=Facial asymmetry is negatively related to condition in female macaque monkeys|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=21 July 2012|volume=66|issue=9|pages=1311–1318|doi=10.1007/s00265-012-1386-4|url=http://media.proquest.com/media/pq/classic/doc/2748861961/fmt/pi/rep/NONE?hl=&amp;cit%3Aauth=Little%2C+Anthony+C%3BPaukner%2C+Annika%3BWoodward%2C+Ruth+A%3BSuomi%2C+Stephen+J&amp;cit%3Atitle=Facial+asymmetry+is+negatively+related+to+condition+in+female+macaque+monkeys&amp;cit%3Apub=Behavioral+Ecology+and+Sociobiology&amp;cit%3Avol=66&amp;cit%3Aiss=9&amp;cit%3Apg=1311&amp;cit%3Adate=Sep+2012&amp;ic=true&amp;cit%3Aprod=PsycINFO&amp;_a=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%3D%3D&amp;_s=MAMCvAoYUz1EfxAJfVCgE6akFXY%3D|accessdate=30 March 2016|pmc=3649767}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that higher FA is also linked to more health issues in chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'').&lt;ref name="FA and health in chimpanzees"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sefcek|first1=Jon A.|last2=King|first2=James E.|title=Chimpanzee facial symmetry: A biometric measure of chimpanzee health.|journal=American Journal of Primatology|date=2007|volume=69|issue=11|pages=1257–1263|doi=10.1002/ajp.20426|pmid=17387675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The link between FA and health has also been investigated in non-primates. In three gazelle species (''Gazella cuvieri; Gazella dama; Gazella dorcas''), for instance, FA has been linked to a range of blood parameters associated with health in mammals, although the specific relevance of these blood parameters for these gazelle species was not examined.&lt;ref name="FA and blood parameters in gazelles"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuervo|first1=José Javier|last2=Dhaoui|first2=Mohamed|last3=Espeso|first3=Gerardo|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and blood parameters in three endangered gazelle species|journal=Mammalian Biology|date=July 2011|volume=76|issue=4|pages=498–505|doi=10.1016/j.mambio.2011.01.007|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1616504711000085/1-s2.0-S1616504711000085-main.pdf?_tid=fd3356e4-f67e-11e5-a5a0-00000aab0f26&amp;acdnat=1459346278_36c5ab2b6d055a31818b2842befb9983|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that, among Iberian red deer (''Cervus elaphus hispanicus''), higher FA was slightly negatively related to both antler size and overall body mass (traits thought to indicate overall condition). Antlers more involved in fighting were found to be more symmetrical than those not involved, and antler asymmetry at reproductive age was lower than in development or at post-reproductive age.&lt;ref name="FA and antler size/body mass"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mateos|first1=Concha|last2=Alarcos|first2=Susana|last3=Carranza|first3=Juan|last4=Sánchez-Prieto|first4=Cristina B.|last5=Valencia|first5=Juliana|title=Fluctuating asymmetry of red deer antlers negatively relates to individual condition and proximity to prime age|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=May 2008|volume=75|issue=5|pages=1629–1640|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.10.016}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

FA and health outcomes have been examined within insect populations. For instance, it has been found that Mediterranean field crickets (''Gryllus bimaculatus'') with higher levels of FA in three hind-limb traits have lower encapsulation rates, but do not differ from low-FA crickets in lytic activity (both are measures of immunocompetence).&lt;ref name="FA and immune function in field crickets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rantala|first1=Markus J.|last2=Ahtiainen|first2=Jari J.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and immune function in a field cricket.|journal=Oikos|date=December 2004|volume=107|issue=3|pages=479–484|doi=10.1111/j.0030-1299.2004.12776.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=30 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While research on the relationship between FA and longevity is sparse in humans, some studies using non-human populations have suggested an association between the symmetry of an organism and its lifespan. For instance, it has been found that flies whose wing veins showed more bilateral symmetry live longer than less symmetrical flies. This difference was greatest for male flies.&lt;ref name="Flies' symmetry and longevity"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harshman|first1=Lawrence G|last2=Müller|first2=Hans-Georg|last3=Liu|first3=Xueli|last4=Wang|first4=Yue|last5=Carey|first5=James R|title=The symmetry of longevity|journal=Journal of Gerontology: Biological Sciences|date=October 2005|volume=60|issue=10|pages=1233–1237|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2611956/pdf/nihms47754.pdf|pmc=2611956|accessdate=19 February 2016|pmid=16282553|doi=10.1093/gerona/60.10.1233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual selection in non-human animals===
Many non-human animals have been shown to be able to distinguish between potential partners, based upon levels of FA. As with humans, lower levels of FA are seen in the most reproductively successful members of species. For instance, FA of male forewing length seem to have an important role in successful mating for many insect species, such as dark-wing damselflies and Japanese [[Mecoptera|scorpionflies]].  In the dark-winged [[damselfly]] (''Calopteryx maculate''), successfully mating male flies showed significantly lower levels of FA in their forewings than unsuccessful males,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beck|first1=Michelle L.|last2=Pruett-Jones|first2=Stephen|title=Fluctuating asymmetry, sexual selection, and survivorship in male dark-winged damselflies.|journal=Ethology|date=2002|volume=108|issue=9|pages=779–791|doi=10.1046/j.1439-0310.2002.00814.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; while for Japanese scorpionflies, FA levels are a good predictor for the outcome of fights between males in that more symmetrical males won significantly more fights.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thornhill|first1=R.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and the mating system of the japanese scorpionfly, panorpa japonica.|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1992|volume=44|issue=5|pages=867–879|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80583-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other animals also show similar patterns, for example, many species of butterfly, males with lower levels of FA tended to live longer and flew more actively, allowing them to have more reproductive success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tsubaki|first1=Y.|last2=Matsumoto|first2=K.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and male mating success in a sphragis-bearing butterfly luehdorfia japonica (lepidoptera: Papilionidae).|journal=Journal of Insect Behavior|date=1998|volume=11|issue=4|pages=571–582|doi=10.1023/a:1022371531263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, female swallows have been shown to prefer longer, and more symmetrical tails as a cue for mate choice. Therefore, the males with longer and more symmetrical tails show higher levels of reproductive success with more attractive females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Møller|first1=A. P.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry in male sexual ornaments may reliable reveal male quality.|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=1990|volume=40|issue=6|pages=1185–1187|doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80187-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In red deer, sexual selection has effected antler development, in that larger and more symmetrical antlers are favoured in males at prime mating age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mateos|first1=C.|last2=Alarcos|first2=S.|last3=Carranza|first3=J.|last4=Sánchez-Prieto|first4=C.

However, some evidence for the effects of sexual selection of FA levels have been inconsistent, suggesting that the relationship between FA and sexual selection may be more complex than originally thought. For instance, in the lekking black grouse and red junglefowl, no correlations were found between FA and mating success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rintamäki|first1=P. T.|last2=Alatalo|first2=R.

==Other associated factors ==

=== Intelligence ===
Through research, fluctuating asymmetry (FA) has been found to have a negative [[correlation]] to [[psychometrics|measurements of human traits]] such as [[working memory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yeo|first=RA|author2=Hill, D |author3=Campbell, R |author4=Vigil, J |author5=Brooks, WM |title=Developmental instability and working memory ability in children: a magnetic resonance spectroscopy investigation.|journal=Developmental Neuropsychology|year=2000|volume=17|issue=2|pages=143–59|doi=10.1207/S15326942DN1702_01|pmid=10955200|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a784400620}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[intelligence]], such that individuals showing greater asymmetry have lower IQ scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furlow|first=FB|author2=Armijo-Prewitt, T |author3=Gangestad, SW |author4=Thornhill, R |title=Fluctuating asymmetry and psychometric intelligence.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]]|date=1997-06-22|volume=264|issue=1383|pages=823–9|doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0115|pmid=9265189|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/264/1383/823.short |pmc=1688437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bates|first=T|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and intelligence|journal=Intelligence|date=1 January 2007|volume=35|issue=1|pages=41–46|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2006.03.013|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289606000353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prokosch|first=M|author2=Yeo, R |author3=Miller, G |title=Intelligence tests with higher -loadings show higher correlations with body symmetry: Evidence for a general fitness factor mediated by developmental stability|journal=Intelligence|date=1 April 2005|volume=33|issue=2|pages=203–213|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2004.07.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As FA links with both intelligence and facial attractiveness, it is possible that our perceptions of attractiveness have evolved based upon developmental quality, which includes traits such as intelligence and health.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt; However, some literature shows no such correlations between FA and intelligence.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A meta-analysis of the research covering this topic demonstrated that whilst published studies largely report negative correlations, unpublished studies often find no association between FA and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Banks|first=George C.|last2=Batchelor|first2=John H.|last3=McDaniel|first3=Michael A.|date=2010-07-01|title=Smarter people are (a bit) more symmetrical: A meta-analysis of the relationship between intelligence and fluctuating asymmetry|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289610000310|journal=Intelligence|volume=38|issue=4|pages=393–401|doi=10.1016/j.intell.2010.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality ===
Research into FA suggests that there may be some correlation to specific personality factors, in particular, the [[Big Five personality traits]]. From a general view, one would expect someone who is more symmetrical (usually meaning greater attractiveness), to be high on agreeableness, [[conscientiousness]], [[Extraversion and introversion|extraversion]] and openness, and low on [[neuroticism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Tartaglia|first = Stefano|last2 = Rollero|first2 = Chiara|date = 2015-11-27|title = The Effects of Attractiveness and Status on Personality Evaluation|url = http://ejop.psychopen.eu/article/view/896|journal = Europe’s Journal of Psychology|volume = 11|issue = 4|pages = 677–690|doi = 10.5964/ejop.v11i4.896|issn = 1841-0413}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most consistent findings reported is that low FA is positively associated with measures of extraversion, suggesting that more symmetrical people tend to be more extraverted than less symmetrical individuals, particularly when specifying to symmetry within the face.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Fink|first = Bernhard|last2 = Neave|first2 = Nick|last3 = Manning|first3 = John T.|last4 = Grammer|first4 = Karl|date = 2005-08-01|title = Facial symmetry and the ‘big-five’ personality factors|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886905000541|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 39|issue = 3|pages = 523–529|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Pound|first = Nicholas|last2 = Penton-Voak|first2 = Ian S.|last3 = Brown|first3 = William M.|date = 2007-10-01|title = Facial symmetry is positively associated with self-reported extraversion|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019188690700164X|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 43|issue = 6|pages = 1572–1582|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2007.04.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Fink|first = Bernhard|last2 = Neave|first2 = Nick|last3 = Manning|first3 = John T.|last4 = Grammer|first4 = Karl|date = 2006-08-01|title = Facial symmetry and judgements of attractiveness, health and personality|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886906000973|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 41|issue = 3|pages = 491–499|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.01.017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A correlation has also been reported between FA and human [[Dominance hierarchy|social dominance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Furlow|first=B |author2=Gangestad, SW |author3=Armijo-Prewitt, T|title=Developmental stability and human violence.|journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |date=1998-01-07|volume=265|issue=1390|pages=1–6|doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0255|pmid=9470212|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/265/1390/1.short|pmc=1688754}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research is proving less consistent with other personality factors, with some finding some weak correlations between low FA and conscientiousness and openness to experience, and others finding no significant differences between those with high or low FA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hope|first = David|last2 = Bates|first2 = Timothy|last3 = Penke|first3 = Lars|last4 = Gow|first4 = Alan J.|last5 = Starr|first5 = John M.|last6 = Deary|first6 = Ian J.|date = 2011-01-01|title = Fluctuating Asymmetry and personality|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886910004228|journal = Personality and Individual Differences|volume = 50|issue = 1|pages = 49–52|doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2010.08.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antisocial behaviours ===
Some studies suggest a link between FA and [[aggression]], but the evidence is mixed. In humans, criminal offenders show greater FA than nonoffenders.&lt;ref name="FA and psychopathy" /&gt; However, other studies report that human males with higher FA show less physical aggression&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manning|first=J. T.|last2=Wood|first2=D.|date=1998-03-01|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and aggression in boys|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-998-1011-4|journal=Human Nature|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=53–65|doi=10.1007/s12110-998-1011-4|issn=1045-6767}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Furlow|first=Bryant|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W.|last3=Armijo-Prewitt|first3=Tara|date=1998-01-07|title=Developmental stability and human violence|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/265/1390/1|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|language=en|volume=265|issue=1390|pages=1–6|doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0255|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1688754|pmid=9470212}}&lt;/ref&gt; and less anger.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muñoz-Reyes|first=José Antonio|last2=Gil-Burmann|first2=Carlos|last3=Fink|first3=Bernhard|last4=Turiegano|first4=Enrique|date=2012-11-01|title=Facial asymmetry and aggression in Spanish adolescents|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886912003005|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|volume=53|issue=7|pages=857–861|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2012.06.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Females show no association between FA and physical aggression,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; but some research has suggested that older female adolescents with higher facial FA are less hostile.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The type of aggression being studied may account for the mixed evidence that is seen here. For example, one study found that females with higher FA demonstrated higher levels of reactive aggression in response to high levels of provocation, whereas high FA males showed more reactive aggression under low levels of provocation.&lt;ref name="FA and reactive aggression"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Benderlioglu|first1=Zeynep|last2=Sciulli|first2=Paul W.|last3=Nelson|first3=Randy J.|title=Fluctuating asymmetry predicts human reactive aggression|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|date=2004|volume=16|issue=4|pages=458–469|doi=10.1002/ajhb.20047}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Research is also mixed in other animals. In Japanese [[Panorpa|scorpionflies]] (''Panorpa nipponensis'' and ''Panorpa ochraceopennis''), FA differences between members of the same sex competing for food determines the outcome of [[Interspecific competition|interspecific contests]] and aggression better than body size or ownership of food.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thornhill|first=Randy|date=1992-05-01|title=Fluctuating asymmetry, interspecific aggression and male mating tactics in two species of Japanese scorpionflies|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00170603|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|language=en|volume=30|issue=5|pages=357–363|doi=10.1007/BF00170603|issn=0340-5443}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, cannibalistic laying [[Chicken|hens]] (''Gallus gallus domesticus'') demonstrate more asymmetry than normal hens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yngvesson|first=Jenny|last2=Keeling|first2=Linda J.|date=2001-03-01|title=Body size and fluctuating asymmetry in relation to cannibalistic behaviour in laying hens|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347200916166|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=61|issue=3|pages=609–615|doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1616}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this link between FA and aggression in hens is questionable, as victimised hens also showed greater asymmetry. Furthermore, when [[Prenatal development|prenatally]] injecting hen eggs with excess [[serotonin]] (5-HT), the hens later exhibited more FA at 18 weeks of age, but displayed less aggressive behaviours. It is suggested that the stress introduced during early embryonic stages via certain factors (such as excess serotonin) may create developmental instability, causing phenotypic and behavioural variations (such as increased or decreased aggression).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennis|first=Rachel L.|last2=Fahey|first2=Alan G.|last3=Cheng|first3=Heng W.|date=2013-03-01|title=Alterations to Embryonic Serotonin Change Aggression and Fearfulness|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.21459/abstract|journal=Aggressive Behavior|language=en|volume=39|issue=2|pages=91–98|doi=10.1002/ab.21459|issn=1098-2337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ageing===

In old age, facial symmetry has been associated with better [[Aging brain|cognitive aging]], as lower levels of FA have been associated with higher intelligence and more efficient information processing in older men.&lt;ref name="FA and cognitive aging"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penke|first1=Lars|last2=Bates|first2=Timothy C|last3=Gow|first3=Alan J|last4=Pattie|first4=Alison|last5=Starr|first5=John M|last6=Jones|first6=Benedict C|last7=Perrett|first7=David I|last8=Deary|first8=Ian J|title=Symmetric faces are a sign of successful cognitive aging|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=November 2009|volume=30|issue=6|pages=429–437|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2009.06.001|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1090513809000543/1-s2.0-S1090513809000543-main.pdf?_tid=e47f5726-d723-11e5-b37a-00000aacb35d&amp;acdnat=1455898666_db9300ce5bbce8595f8dd1bde41f0277|accessdate=19 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, it has been found that risk of mortality cannot be predicted accurately from levels of FA in photographs of older adults.&lt;ref name="Predicting mortality from human faces"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dykiert|first1=Dominika|last2=Bates|first2=Timothy C|last3=Gow|first3=Alan J|last4=Penke|first4=Lars|last5=Starr|first5=John M|last6=Deary|first6=Ian J|title=Predicting mortality from human faces|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|date=2012|volume=74|issue=6|pages=560–566|doi=10.1097/PSY.0b013e318259c33f}}&lt;!--|accessdate=19 February 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other factors ===
Additionally, FA has been shown to predict atypical asymmetry of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=J. T|last2=Gangestad|first2=S. W|last3=Lewine|first3=J. D|last4=Thoma|first4=R.

A|title=Fluctuating asymmetry and the human brain|journal=Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition|date=2002|volume=7|pages=45–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that growth rates after birth positively correlate with FA. For example, increased FA has been found in people who were currently obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A trade-off between early growth rate and fluctuating asymmetry in Brazilian boys|journal = Annals of Human Biology|date = 2006-02-01|issn = 0301-4460|pmid = 16500816|pages = 112–124|volume = 33|issue = 1|doi = 10.1080/03014460500480391|first = Jonathan C.

{{Humanism}}

The '''Humanist Movement''' is an international volunteer organisation that promotes [[nonviolence]] and non-discrimination.  It is not an institution.  It takes its inspiration from the current of thought referred to as New or Universal Humanism that has been developed since 1969 by its founder [[Mario Rodríguez Cobos]], pen name: Silo.

New Humanism focuses on the overcoming of pain and suffering at a personal, interpersonal and social level.  It defines violence as anything that causes pain and suffering to human beings.  In this way violence is seen to have many different aspects, not just the well-known physical form but also; economic, religious, psychological, sexual, ethnic, etc.

==Introduction and basic philosophy==
The Humanist Movement's conception is based on the Siloist thought, the major points of which are the following:
Prior to thinking about his origin or destiny, the human being finds himself in a determined vital situation, one not of his own choosing.  Thus, he is born submerged in a natural and also a social world plagued by physical and mental aggression that he experiences as pain and suffering.  Consequently, he mobilizes himself trying to overcome pain and suffering.  
In his acting against these painful factors, he produces objects and signs which are incorporated into society and are transmitted historically. And all that is produced is loaded with meaning, with an intention and this intention is ultimately to surpass pain and suffering.

The history of mankind, then &amp;ndash; of its economy, of its politics, of its science, of its art &amp;ndash; is the history of the struggle against pain and suffering.  And this struggle is the motor of the progress.  This struggle is not between mechanical forces.  It is not a natural reflection.  It is a struggle between human intentions.  And, precisely this is what enables one to speak of oppressors and oppressed, of just and unjust ones, of heroes and cowards.  This is the only thing that enables one to rescue the personal subjectivity and is the only thing that enables one to practice with meaning the social solidarity and the commitment with the liberation of those discriminated against, be these majorities or minorities.
At this point, a definition of "human being" is a must.  It will not suffice to say "man is the social animal" or "man is the manufacturer of objects" or "man is the possessor of language", etc.  In the Siloist doctrine "Man is the historical being whose mode of social action transforms his own nature."

In short, New Humanism is based on two basic points:

* Solidarity &amp;ndash; defined as treating other people the way one would like to be treated and,
* Coherence &amp;ndash; defined as thinking, feeling and acting in the same way.

The project of the Humanist Movement is nothing less than to eradicate war, hunger, poverty and economic exploitation across the planet and develop a new system based on the value of human life as the central value, higher than money, power, prestige, etc.  Siloists call this vision of the future the Universal Human Nation.  The methodology used is to work in groups and undertake personal development activities as well as social projects.  Once sufficiently experienced, new groups develop according to their interests.

New Humanists share the following humanist attitudes:

* Placing the human being as the central value and concern, in such a way that nothing is above the human being and no human being is above another.
* Affirming the equality of all human beings.
* Recognizing personal and cultural diversity, affirming the characteristics proper to each human group and condemning discrimination, whether motivated by economic, racial, ethnic, gender or cultural differences.
* Developing knowledge beyond the limitations imposed by prejudices accepted as absolute and immutable truths.
* Affirming the freedom of ideas and beliefs.
* Repudiating violence in all its forms.

==History==

Near the end of the 1960s, Silo organized a group to study the personal and social [[crisis]] occurring in the world. The group intends to give a global intellectual response to a world in crises which takes place in the social and personal fields.  The personal and social crisis of the '60s demands responses that are not in sight and that requires previous pausing anew (reformulations) in which the intelectual prejudice must be eliminated.  Three sectors of research are organised.  
1) that of daily and personal existence
2) that of the social activity
3) that of the methodology of the research
the group makes its own Kant's declaration: "criticism, to which everything should be submitted, is characteristic of our ephoch: in vain try to escape from it religion for being saint and legislation for being majestic, since they would then arise founded suspicions upson trying to impede their thorough examination, rationally carried out.

This group, and others like it, organized around his writings, grew and developed into what started life as The School and after many iterations later became known as the Humanist Movement.

The Humanist Movement is often said to have been started May 4, 1969, with the talk "The Healing of Suffering" by Silo at [[Punta de Vacas]], [[Argentina]].  Because of the [[military dictatorship]] in place at that time, this talk was permitted on the condition that it would be held high in the [[Andes|Andes Mountains]], far from the nearest town.

These initial groups faced repression and disinformation campaigns as they grew and spread throughout [[Latin America]]. This growth was reinforced when some of the members, freely or as political [[exile]]s, took up residence in various countries in [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]].

In 1975 one hundred members from different countries met in [[Corfu]], [[Greece]], to agree on proposals, objectives and a rudimentary organisation that would be tested over the next four years.

By 1980 the Movement was functioning in forty two countries.  In 1981 The Community for Human Development organised a lecture tour around Europe and Asia.  The Look Within, The Internal Landscape, and the Book of the Community were published and translated into many languages.

In 1983 the Movement was articulated into Councils (see Organisation) and a way of working was defined in a material called the Norms.  In 1984 the Humanist Party was founded, followed by The Greens.

After the launch of the [[Humanist International]] in 1989, the strategy turned once more to the development of the Humanist Movement in a more general form and its organisation structure.  A stage of putting down roots in communities, with the opening of Centres of Communication and the publication of hundreds of neighbourhood newspapers around the world was started.

In 1993 the Document of the Humanist Movement was published. The first Humanist Forum was held in Moscow, Russia, and The [[World Center of Humanist Studies]] was founded.

By 1995 the direction of the Humanist Movement went towards a phase of massive growth with the opening up of 10s of new countries across [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and the [[Caribbean]].  This mostly was made possible through the launching of the Centre of Cultures.  In addition, from Spain the action front called World without Wars was legalised that later went on to become an official organisation of the Humanist Movement.

By 2006, the first Parks of Study and Reflection was launched around the world.

In 2009, the organisational structure articulated in 1983 was dissolved by Silo leaving behind 5 official organisations to represent the Humanist Movement's interests in various fields of human endeavour.

On 2 October 2009, until 2 January 2010, the [[World March for Peace and Nonviolence]] went around the world from [[New Zealand]] to Argentina calling for the eradication of [[Nuclear Weapons]], the withdrawal of invading troops from foreign territories, the signing of peace treaties between countries in dispute, progressive and proportional conventional weapons disarmament and the implementation of articles in national constitutions to renounce the use of war as a means to resolve conflicts, such as Article 9 of the Japanese constitution.  The World March was the initiative of the Humanist organisation, [[World without Wars and without Violence]] and was promoted around the world by Humanist and other organisations.

==Organisation==
The Humanist Movement- defined as "the organization that interprets the needs of the Human being and produces the means for advancing from the ground of determination to the ground of freedom" should be framed as a broad and developing movement which generates specific base teams with a human base aiming at the same objective.

The organizational form of the Humanist Movement is constantly changing. Currently the movement is in a process of transformation of its organizational form and the form that was applied until now, is no longer valid. At the moment the Humanist Movement consists simply of all those who adhere to the Document of the Humanist Movement (1993) and there are no formal positions in the organization - rather all participants are simply colleagues.

==Organisms==

The Humanist Movement has launched official organisations, internally referred to as organisms, in political, social and cultural fields, according to the legal requirements in the country where the Humanist Movement is being developed.  The strategy of the Humanist Movement is to launch the following five organisms in every country in the world where it is possible to do so.
* ''The Community for Human Development''
* ''[[Humanist Party|The International Humanist Party]]''
* ''Convergence of Cultures''
* ''The World Centre of Humanist Studies''
* ''[[World without Wars and without Violence]]''

===The Community for Human Development===
[[Image:logo-comunita.jpg|thumb|The Community logo (used by followers of Silo in the 1970s)]]
The Community for Human Development, launched in 1981, is a social and cultural organisation that works for ''nonviolence'' through [[simultaneous]] social and personal transformation i.e. through the transformation of the structures of society and the way that individuals act in the [[world]].

The Community has the following objectives:
* To create the conditions for human beings to be [[Free will|free]], nonviolent and to live in [[solidarity (sociology)|solidarity]] with others, to give direction and meaning to their lives; for individuals to work for their own destiny and for the social struggle for conditions in [[education]], [[health]] and [[quality of life]] that allow every person to evolve without obstacles.
* To build a new moral force that serves as a social and personal reference.

The Community works in society in the areas of education, health, [[culture]], and quality of life.  In each of these areas it denounces all that which hinders the development of the human being and develops actions that favour it.

The key characteristics of the work of The Community are:
* [[Voluntarism (action)|Voluntarism]] - disinterested giving allows the truly human dimension to appear.
* Direct [[communication]] - allows [[solitude|isolation]] to be overcome and a daily personal engagement in the name of ones values and aspirations.
* Active nonviolence, as a [[methodology]] and as an internal and external attitude that favours [[life]]

The official documents of the Community can be found in the Book of the Community.

===The International Humanist Party===
[[Image:Humanist party moebius logo - white on orange.png|thumb|Humanist Party logo]]
The idea of the Humanist Party as a political party was launched on March 8, 1984, as a recommendation from the Department of Social Affairs of The Community for Human Development.  Around the world many Humanist Parties started to emerge and on January 4, 1989, in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], the first congress of the [[Humanist International]] was held.

In this event, the foundational documents were adopted, including the Declaration of Principles, The Thesis, Foundations for political action and the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

In December 1990, in [[Chile]], [[Laura Rodríguez]] became the first elected representative of any Humanist Party in the world after winning a seat as part of the ''[[Coalition of Parties for Democracy|Concertación]]'' coalition, after [[Augusto Pinochet]] handed over power.

In October 1993, the second congress of the [[Humanist International]] was held in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]], whereupon the Document of the Humanist Movement was also incorporated as a foundational document.  This document had previously been circulating as chapter six of the Book Letters to my friends.

In 1999, regional coordination bodies of Humanist Parties were formed in [[South America]] and [[Europe]].  The regional bodies of [[Africa]] and [[Asia]] are expected to be formed in 2006.

In addition to the Humanist Party, the Community for Human Development later recommended also the formation of a party based on a New Humanist approach to [[Ecology]].  The subsequent formation of a party called The Greens, caused much confusion in Europe where both [[Green party|The Greens and Green Party]] were sometimes fighting elections against one another.  This led to a great deal of bad feeling from the Green Party (see the section below on conflict with other organisations).  Eventually, the Environmental policies of the Greens were incorporated within the Humanist Party which resulted in their merger.

The official documents of the Humanist Party can be found in the Book of the Humanist International.

In 2009, the word "International" was appended to the beginning of the Party's name.

===Convergence of Cultures===
The Centre of Cultures was started in 1995 from [[Milan]], [[Barcelona]] and [[Marseille]] as a response to the increasingly difficult situation faced by newly arrived immigrants to Europe.

The objectives of the Centre of Cultures are:
* To rescue the humanist ideas, beliefs and attitudes in every culture.
* To promote dialogue so that cultures may recognize their own value and through this can recognize the value of the others.
* To promote the deepening in comprehension of people’s own cultures for a better understanding of their roots and an intentional strengthening of their best aspects.
* To promote the questioning of [[abuses of power]] as well as the values upon which the present system sustains itself.  Helping to appropriately address cultural conflicts.
* To disseminate the ideas of universal humanism as the basis for the construction of a new universal human culture.
* To deepen the concept of active nonviolence as a methodology of action

By the year 2000 this organisation was recognised as the third official organism of the Humanist Movement and had opened new centres in [[New York City]], [[Madrid]], [[Bombay]], [[Zurich]], [[Paris]], [[Brussels]], [[Berlin]], [[São Paulo]], [[Buenos Aires]] and [[Santiago de Chile]].

The work of the Centre of Cultures brought the Humanist Movement into contact with people from countries in Africa and Asia where it had previously had little presence and this led to a massive explosion in its membership in those areas starting in the late 90s.

In 2009 the organisation underwent a rebranding exercise and changed its name to Convergence of Cultures.

==Missions of the Message==
Individual Humanist Movement groups carry out missionary work, as they call it, in various locations around the world.
* In February 2014 a Humanist Movement group started a mission based out of an apartment in [[Oakland]], California for the purpose of proselytizing in the Bay Area.&lt;ref&gt;https://themessageusa.wordpress.com/2014/02/24/moving-college-of-alameda-lake-merritt/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* There is also a mission in [[Sydney]], Australia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/SilosMessageInSydney&lt;/ref&gt;

==Action fronts==
Action fronts of many themes are developed by humanists around the world.  They do not necessarily fall under the umbrella of any of the specific organisms.  For more information consult the list of websites referred to at the bottom of this page.
* ''Humanists for Health''
* ''International Federation of Human Support (FIAH)''

==Books==

===Humanise the earth (''Humanizar la tierra'') by Silo===
A three-part work comprising The inner look, The internal landscape and The external landscape.  Each part deals with a different aspect of human existence.

The first part details the authors search and subsequent discovery of meaning in life.  It describes meditation exercises called the experience of peace and the experience of force and describes a strategy in life for avoiding pain and suffering called the Principles of Valid Action.

The second part deals more with [[psychology|psychological]] issues and the interpersonal issues that an individual faces during their life.  Themes such as; [[faith]], provisional meanings, giving and receiving, contradiction and unity are dealt with.  In addition the theme of the Internal Guide, an inspirational image that an individual can configure and use, is introduced.

The final part deals more with the external conditions in society, covering such aspects as; [[law]], [[State (polity)|the state]], [[religion]], education etc.

===Self-liberation (''Auto-liberación'') by Luís Ammann===
Self-liberation is a book that can best be categorised as "[[Personal development]]".  It contains a number of different techniques that can be done in groups and in pairs.  The different sections deal with; Relaxation and working with [[mental images]], the scheme of the different centres of response (the intellectual, emotional, motor, vegetative and sexual centres) and exercises for the first three centres called "psycho-physical gymnastics" and two further sections called "Catharsis" and "Transference" which are together known as "operative".

The work of Catharsis and Transference takes the participants deep into an area of what can be referred to as Siloist Psychology and a concept known as the "Space of Representation", what has been referred to by others as the "[[mind's eye]]", or what one is able to intentionally imagine when one closes one's eyes, when one [[daydream]]s or when one [[dream]]s during [[sleep]].

The exercises are designed to help the participants: [[wiktionary:reconciliation|reconcile]] with their past experiences, find strength in their current situation and develop a positive and joyful image of the future.  According to the explanations one carries one's bad experiences around in the consciousness and from there they act in the present and affect the future.  By seeking out the bad experiences and painful memories and working on them using the techniques of catharsis and transference, mental energy can be released and one can live one's life more intentionally and less restricted by one's past experiences.  The whole body of the work is meant to be done in such a way that there are no roles of "[[psychotherapy|therapist]]" or "patient", all parties take all the roles to establish an equitable relationship that can engender [[Trust (sociology)|trust]] and a deep entering into the themes.

===Letters to my friends (''Cartas a mis amigos'') by Silo===

Letters to my Friends: On Social and Personal Crisis in Today's World is a book that outlines the scope of the crisis in which societies and individuals are immersed according to the point of view of the author.  It is put together as a series of ten letters that were written between 1990 and 1994.  The sixth letter, which is better known as either the Statement or Document of the Humanist Movement and has been taken as one of the Foundational documents of the Humanist International, contains a general point of view about; Global [[Capital (economics)|Capital]], real vs formal [[Democracy]], the emergence of a Humanist [[sensibility]] in the world, anti-humanist characteristics and Humanist Action Fronts.

Some of the other chapters deal with such themes as; personal coherence and solidarity; the [[nature]] of human beings; social revolution; the [[armed forces]] and [[Human Rights]].

===Silo Speaks (''Habla Silo'') by Silo===
Silo Speaks is an anthology of opinions, commentaries and speeches given by Silo between 1969 and 1995.

The book starts with the first public explanation of New Humanism in a speech called The Healing of Suffering.  It continues with a section that contains many explanations about themes such as: meaning in life, perception, voluntarism, the nature of human existence and religiosity.

The second part is a series of book presentations given during the publication of some of his previous works.

The third part is a series of talks given on such themes as: Humanism and the New World, Humanism and the Crisis of Civilization, What do we understand by Universal Humanism and the Theme of God.

==Founder==
[[Mario Rodríguez Cobos]], also known as Silo, was born in 1938 and lived in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[Argentina]]. As the author of many books, he received an honorary doctorate from the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] of [[Russia]] in October 1993.

In 2001, in the Annual Ordinary Meeting of the Assembly of General Coordinators, the highest level of interchange for those involved in the organisational structure, in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], Silo announced his [[retirement]] from the affairs of the Humanist Movement, leaving all further development in the hands of this collegiate body that he himself had created.

Since that time, Silo has started a new project, known as [http://silo.net Silo's Message]. This project is a spiritual development based on some of the earliest forms of meditation exercises developed by Silo in the 1960s called the work with the force.

==Conflict with other organisations==
{{Refimprove|date=March 2015}}
The history of the Humanist Movement has not been without its conflict with other organisations and individuals.

During the 1960s in Argentina, as the initial groups were forming with the name "Young Power", there was conflict with the [[Catholic Church]].  Humanist organisations, clearly opposed to the military regime in Argentina, came under attack from the government. People were arrested and jailed, two were killed and an attempt was made to shoot Silo.

A research by Professor Barr-Melej from Ohio University [http://www.active-nonviolence.org/HAHR_11_2006_Patrick.pdf] contains some information about the early conflicts.

Later on, with the advent of the Humanist variant of the Green party, humanists were exposed to a lot of opposition in Italy, Spain, the USA, the UK and Germany.  Some people in the [[Green movement]] interpreted the Humanist Movement as being opposed to [[environmentalism]], considering that humanity, not nature, should be the focus of attention.  The response from the Humanist Movement was that environmental exploitation happens because society is following values (such as money, economic growth, etc.) that are contrary to the human being.  The argument continued by pointing out that if we were to truly act on human values, there would be no need for a conflict with any living things.

The Humanist Movement is totally distinct from the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]], the worldwide federation of organisations promoting [[secular humanism]] that is recognised at the United Nations and includes organisations such as [[Humanists UK]] and the [[American Humanist Association]].

Some disaffected former members have also complained that the Humanist Movement is a [[cult]], though some ex-members object [http://www.corliss-lamont.org/hsmny/siloists.htm] to this label, considering this merely an attempt to discredit the organization.

'''Jean-Baptiste Boisot''' (July 1638 – 4 December 1694) was a French [[abbot]], [[Bibliophilia|bibliophile]], and scholar notable for leaving his collection of manuscripts (including the papers of cardinal [[Antoine Perrenot de Granvelle]]) to the [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] monks of Saint-Vincent. He is also known for leaving his library to his birthplace of Besançon and for his correspondence with [[Madeleine de Scudéry]].&lt;ref&gt;''Universal Biography, Ancient and Modern'', Jean Baptiste Boisot, pg. 585&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==

Jean-Baptiste Boisot is the third son of Claude Boisot, governor of the imperial city of Besançon from 1652 to 1658 and merchant-banker, father of twelve children. Very quickly, at the end of the century, the family was Boisot [[Anomie]], then protected by the minister of [[Louis XIV of France]], [[François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois]]. The Boisot family became very present in the body of the senior church dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;General JT of MESMAY, ''Historical Dictionary, biographical and genealogical old families of Franche-Comté'', Sl, 1958-1863.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A studious youth ===

Little is known about the youth of Jean-Baptiste Boisot, except that he was an excellent student, curious, interested, and that he got excellent results in his studies.

Very early, Jean Baptiste Boisot was interested in [[philosophy]], as well the [[Latin]], which he completed with success in his hometown at the age of thirteen years. He continued his studies at the [[University of Dole]] in the [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] and the [[canon law]] and received his law degree at the age of sixteen. His father then decides to send him to [[University of Paris]], where he spent two years at the university. This was an opportunity for him to improve his knowledge of the Latin and Greek languages, with the goal of reading to the Fathers of the Church. He also wanted to see the manuscripts translated directly from the original source and make available this work.

===The Sorbonne and the literary relationship===
In his first years at the [[Sorbonne]], Jean Baptiste Boisot binds a lasting friendship with many emblematic figures of the time. For example [[Paul Pellisson]] historiographer of Louis XIV and State counselor, as well as Madeleine de Scudery, who was part of a movement in the late Renaissance in England and France where women used classical rhetorical theory for their own.&lt;ref&gt;Donawerth, Jane (Spring 1992). "Conversation and the Boundaries of Public Discourse in Rhetorical Theory by Renaissance Women". ''Rhetorica'' 16 (2): 181–199. {{doi|10.1525/rh.1998.16.2.181}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among other figures were [[Jacob Spon]], founder of the archeology, Andre of Saint Nicolas, philosopher, and theologian and Claude Nicaise. It is also in Paris that he perfected his handling of the French language and developed qualities of which Madeleine de Scudery and Bosquillon will pay tribute.&lt;ref&gt;Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Letters in 1695, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these qualities include politeness, taste, and modesty.

Some of these letters were recovered thanks to the [[Journal des Savants]]. Having completed his studies in 1660, Jean Baptiste came back in Besançon ready to spend the next ten years of his life traveling for pleasure as well as for business.

===Travels===
Boisot begins his travels by staying three consecutive years in Italy, where he buys books, medals, and busts, which become part of his future library.

With this deputation of the Pope, he bought the library of Cardinal [[Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle]], who was in the hands of the Count of Saint-Amour. Throughout his life, he enriches the library, which was the foundation of the Public Library of Besançon. It is now known as the [[Bibliothèque municipale de Besançon]].

Throughout this journey, he learned Italian, he "heard" as Hebrew, knew Greek, Latin, Spanish. We know he went to Rome and visited the library Vaticaneet where he met various booksellers. He also obtained the protection of Italian Cardinal [[Decio Azzolino]], which represented the Queen [[Christina of Sweden]].

Boisot was offered the post of Secretary, but refused, being an enemy of tumult and subjugation courses.&lt;ref name="Moreri 326"&gt;{{harvsp|Louis Moréri|1711|p. 326}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is through these relationships that he obtained from the Pope several [[Priory|priories]] located in [[Franche-Comté]].

[[File:Tizian-Nicolas Granvelle.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Granvelle, Portrait by [[Titian]]]]

Boisot was then sent on a mission to [[Milan]], to the Marquis of Mortar, governor of Milan, to negotiate with him sending reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Claude François Daunou, Pierre Antoine Lebrun, Charles Giraud, Barthélemy Hauréau 1709, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle is signed, and the king restores the Franche-Comté hoping resume, what happens four years later. It is for this reason that Boisot decided to exile himself and leave [[Savoy]] in 1673 and Italy in 1674. Until 1678, he remains in Spain, a country he does not crosses much, preferring to stay in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;An Universal Biographical and Historical Dictionary: Volume 2 on Google books [archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

This was opportunity for Boisot to improve his knowledge of the Spanish language, which will be useful in the classification and decryption papers Granvelle. This is also an opportunity for him to visit the library of the Escurial, where he stayed two months and meets Hernan Nunez, Ambassador of the King of Spain, seeking his presence at the Embassy. However, Jean Baptiste Boisot, having already refused such favors according to his principles, was obliged to refuse.

Peace of [[Nijmegen]] being established in 1678, Jean Baptiste Boisot is finally released from its obligations to Spain and can return to his home province. The results of ten years of travel is positive by learning two new languages, the acquisition of books and works of art that will be linked to its library and living in the capitals of Rome and Madrid.

==The commendatory of the Abbey of Saint-Vincent==
[[File:Façade église Notre-Dame - Besançon.JPG|thumb|alt=alternative to the image|Abbaye Saint-Vincent de Besançon]]

===A difficult appointment===
Louis XIV entrusted him on his return the Benedictine Abbey of Saint-Vincent Besançon. which is the time the third benefit of the province.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Fr. Michaud 1810, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; However, he meets some difficulties because the pope agrees after many negotiations as Jean-Baptiste Boisot does not belong to the order of St. Benedict, which put the abbey in order. During his appointment as abbot of Saint-Vincent, it's not a trip to Paris to meet with the king presented to him by Pellisson.

===Exemplary church life===
The life of Father Boisot is exemplary as it is linked to the piety and generosity. In times of plague, he will give up all his property and rescues the poor. Boisot filled his letters epistles, of odes, compliments and translations he sends his friend Pellisson example for his Treatise on the Eucharist, among other passages containing books Saint Jerome, of Lactantius and of Tertullian Corona. Sometimes he joined the Spanish and Italian letters are in the collection of Granvelle.

===A historian of service to others===
Throughout his life, Jean-Baptiste Boisot has applied to put his knowledge to help others, his many notes and papers rank of Cardinal Granvelle make him a historian applied.&lt;ref&gt;''Historical Dictionary of Louis Moréri'', page 327. [archive]&lt;/ref&gt; The work on the papers of Cardinal Granvelle represents nearly 80 folio volumes that can currently still find library Besançon. He even had the idea of writing the life of Cardinal, as reported in a letter to his friend Pellisson:

:"I picked up almost all of the great shipwreck debris. Two persons of quality (the Comte de Saint-love and Baron Thoraise) gave me what remained for them. I bought what was still scattered here and there; and counselor of my friends (Mr. Chifflet advisor Parliament Besançon), brother of the abbot I mentioned, seeing that he was no longer a conservoit fragment price that I avois already gathered, kindly suffer him to pass my hands. I added several original pieces from both ancient and modern, dug in various places, and to prevent a new disaster, I took care of them connect."&lt;ref&gt;BMB, Ms 1244, Letter of Boisot to Pellisson on a draft biography of cardinal Granvelle.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Mabillon]] admired in addition to the library, antique cabinet and tables of Boisot. All these elements can be concluded that Jean-Baptiste Boisot was an important figure in the community Bisontine, figure sponsorship and provincial scholarship of the seventeenth century, his name is known beyond the French borders.

He died 4 December 1694, at the age of fifty-six, in his abbey and bequeath to his hometown of Besançon its most valuable asset: its library. The magistrates of Besançon made him magnificent funeral orations, which they attended en masse. On 9 December, the city of Besançon decided to celebrate an office for the repose of his soul to the [[Cordeliers]]. Several exchanges are then carried out between the mayor and the Benedictines to establish an inventory of his collection, he begins a few days after his death, 5 January 1695.

==The will of the Father Boisot==
Extract the solemn testament made by Reverend Lord Sir Jean-Baptiste Boisot, Kirton, Abbot of Saint-Vincent de Besançon, Prior of Grandecour and Loye, passed by notary Jean Colin, royal notary audit Besançon 27 November 1694, published in Parliament Ladit city and to Sir Charles Bouvot, advisor to Commissioner MP 7 December of that year, in which he will set for his heir, Sir Claude Boisot, his brother, said Parliament Speaker.

[[File:Entree de la salle de lecture de la Bibliotheque Mazarine Paris.jpg|thumb|Entry of the Mazarine library]]

:"Item, I give and bequeath to the Benedictine fathers Rds Besançon any and all my books, bound and unbound manuscripts that belong with my bronze and silver, ancient and modern, and Coin and cabinets in which they are enclosed in charge and if they will all in a room which is open twice a week for all those who wish to enter; which will be able to read and study as much time as they wish during the two days, yet without it they be allowed to divert any book; and so lesdit books and medals Aussy well as busts and paintings which will be spoken after cy, should keep forever for the benefit of learned men; I want to hear and that an inventory of all it stands before a notary and tesmoins in the presence of my heir cy named after that double that inventory be made, one of which will be placed in the hands of my said heir, and other gentlemen will be brought to the Magistrate of the city, so they are solicitous conservation desdit books and other things specified as above set estans the monuments that I dedicate to posterity."

:"Also I give and bequeath auxdit Rds Benedictine fathers the sum of 6000 francs to be used in purchasing annuities whose income will be taken: first, the costs of said inentaire for the ornament of which will be this dirty public library, and then used to purchase books as Superior and He who said library who will be entrusted deem expedient; provided however that they will buy books fathers, and other book Belles Lettres for the use of any kind of defendant expressly people use all kinds of people defendant expressly buying some sermonaires, Which books will adjoutés four in four years aforesaid inventory Easting my intention that the income of the said sum of 6000 francs to be used punctually increase of said library without power Estre Diverty for any other purpose as Aussy quue lesdit books and medals remain in perpetuity said sale for public use, without power Estre moved elsewhere are distracted for e whole or in part in any cause or reason whatsoever ..."&lt;ref&gt;Municipal Library of Besançon, Manuscrit 1270.&lt;/ref&gt;

So after this act was born the municipal library of Besançon, under the control of the Benedictines of St. Vincent. The question of the influence that the Mazarine library had in the legacy of Jean Baptiste Boisot is legitimate, since it has visited.

Jean Baptiste Boisot is a passionate knowledge of the study, a bibliophile, as evidenced by his correspondence miss Scuderi and Paul Pellisson.Il would be possible to have more information about the legacy of Father Boisot, however the letters that could provide more information are those sent to the abbot of St. Vincent which remain lost.

Three letters to Paul Pellison learn about his legacy, like that of 17 December 1690 where he states:

:"I will send it back as soon as our fathers Abbey have had time to see and copy. It is necessary that you remain original and if you do want to point it would be better to give a public library as an individual like me and has no result."&lt;ref name="a"&gt;Bibliothèque municipale de Besançon, Manuscrit 602&lt;/ref&gt;

Letter of 12 January Pellison shows the evolution of his thinking:

:"I praise with all my heart, sir, the plan that you have to leave a public library, this is one thing in the world I would have loved to do better if I had found myself in the situation that needs to it. I see with great pleasure your project when you please let me know, not to believe that I think add anything, but to enjoy myself."&lt;ref name="a"/&gt;
 
The turning point comes with the transfer of the University of Dole to Besançon, and in the opinion of the Abbe de Saint-Vincent, who suggested he leave his library. As a letter from Paul Pelisson which dated 16 June 1691 in response to a letter from the Abbe Boisot, now lost watch:

:"I praise with all my heart the purpose you move your library one day in the building being prepared for your university. That's all we can do better, not that the course of time often make all our precautions useless, but if there is something lasting and useful in general, are the institutions this nature, permitte denis cetera, we can not do anything there."

===Personal library===
The first inventory of the library of the Abbot Boisot was established in 1607. It contains, in addition to books Granvelle, some of those who belonged to his father, the Chancellor of Nicolas Perrenot, and the Earl of Cantecroix. It consists of nearly 1,500 volumes in nearly 1500 volumes. This library is considered one of the largest library of the sixteenth century.

Maurice Piquard wrote an article "The library of a statesman in the sixteenth century",&lt;ref&gt;Mixtures of history of the book and libraries offered to Mr. Frantz Calot, ... [Printed text] . - OF Argences, 1960. Library elzevirienne of the IRHT. Studies and Documents&lt;/ref&gt; which encountered some difficulty with the poverty of the inventory of 1607 contained no dates or place of printing or author's name. It is for these reasons that the uncertainty still hangs on certain subjects. Maurice Piquard has several Greek works including 9 works of Plutarch, 6 Aristotle, Homer 5, 4 Polybius, Herodotus, Dion Cassius, 3 Thucydides, Xenophon, one of Aeschylus, Aristophanes. Absent the works of Sophocles and Euripides.

With regard to Latin literature, the collection includes nine books [[Cicero]], [[Virgil]], [[Livy]], [[Terence]], 'of Ovid, and [[Lucretius]], Plautus, Pliny the Elder, Caesar, Seneca, Horace, and Tacitus. Piquard also highlights the presence of many of the Italian renaissance writers such as [[Dante]], Petrarch, Boccaccio in rare and copies of authors Vitruvius . Machiavelli and Baldassare Castiglione are widely represented, with 5 copies of the Prince and 5 of the Courtier. Educated man, he has sixty law books, 172 history, 70 of Medicine (Ambroise Pare, Vesalius ...) as well as works of astrology, astronomy and many aspects of science and issues of the time, such as " De revolutionibus orbium Celestium "of Nicolas Copernicus, however it also lacks the works of Ptolemy, reputedly at the time.

The absence of some authors of the church such as [[St. Augustine]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] and some novels such as Romance of the Rose is not trivial so we will not pay attention, and lack certain works of piety of the time is strange for a clergyman. The assumption of theft or loss is however not excluded.

Its library includes manuscripts and enriched quality as the Chronicles of Froissart, from the collection of Granvelle and many bindings from quality relationships that the cardinal had linked with printers from all over Europe.

The inventory that was used was that of 1607, a more comprehensive was made until 1695 under the auspices of witnesses advisors Tinseau, Monnier, Noironte Lord and Pierre-Ignace Gillebert to attend the notary Jean Colin; It lasted nearly ten months (5 January 1695 - October 1695). The inventory ''dénombrera'' 1847 numbers for books, equivalent to 2,247 volumes and 239 manuscripts. They will later be joined to form 80 large folio of State Cardinal Granvelle papers. It is then in 1732 the first catalog will be established by subject matter, so sometimes messy and imprecise.

'''John Franklin Candy''' (October 31, 1950 – March 4, 1994)&lt;ref name="googlebooks"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uKs4fKOotUC&amp;pg=PA29 |title=Guide to the Cinema(s) of Canada |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |last=Rist |first=Peter |year=2001 |page=29 |isbn=978-0-313-29931-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a Canadian comedian and actor known mainly for his work in [[Hollywood]] films. Candy rose to fame as a member of the [[Toronto]] branch of [[the Second City]] and its related ''[[Second City Television]]'' series, and through his appearances in such comedy films as ''[[Stripes (film)|Stripes]]'', ''[[Splash (film)|Splash]]'', ''[[Cool Runnings]]'', ''[[Summer Rental]]'', ''[[Home Alone]]'', ''[[The Great Outdoors (film)|The Great Outdoors]]'', ''[[Spaceballs]]'', and ''[[Uncle Buck]]'', as well as more dramatic roles in ''[[Only the Lonely (film)|Only the Lonely]]'' and ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''. One of his most renowned onscreen performances was as Del Griffith, the loquacious shower-curtain ring salesman in the [[John Hughes (filmmaker)|John Hughes]] comedy ''[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]''.

While filming the Western [[parody]] ''[[Wagons East!]]'', Candy died of a [[heart attack]] in [[Durango, Durango|Durango, Mexico]], on March 4, 1994, aged 43. His final two films, ''Wagons East!'' and ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'', are dedicated to his memory.

==Biography==
===Early life and career (1950–1980)===
Candy was born in 1950 in [[Newmarket, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="googlebooks"/&gt; The son of Sidney James Candy and Evangeline (née Aker) Candy, he was brought up in a working-class [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Karen S.|last=Schneider|url=http://people.com/archive/cover-story-exit-laughing-vol-41-no-10/|title=Exit Laughing|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date=March 21, 1994|accessdate=September 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candy's father was of [[English Canadians|English]] and [[Scottish Canadians|Scottish]] descent,{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} while his mother was of [[Polish Canadians|Polish]] and [[Ukrainian Canadians|Ukrainian]] descent.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Candy studied at [[Neil McNeil Catholic High School]], later enrolled in the [[Centennial College|Centennial Community College]] to study journalism, and went to [[McMaster University]] for higher education. His first film role was a small, uncredited appearance in the 1973 film ''[[Class of '44]]''. He appeared in several other low-budget films during the 1970s, including the bank-robbery thriller ''[[The Silent Partner (1978 film)|The Silent Partner]]'' with [[Christopher Plummer]] and [[Elliott Gould]]. In 1975, he played Richie, an accused killer, in episode "Web of Guilt", on the [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] TV show ''[[Dr. Simon Locke|Police Surgeon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvarchive.ca/database/18160/police_surgeon/episode_guide/ Episode Guide – Police Surgeon (Series) (1971–1975)]&lt;br /&gt;January 23, 1975 – "Web of Guilt" Dr Locke intervenes when a woman judge (Nancy Olson) endangers herself by becoming too protective of her brother who is accused of murder. Richie: John Candy. Bonnie: Helen Shaver. Scharfman: Don McGill.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976, Candy played a supporting role (with [[Rick Moranis]]) on [[Peter Gzowski]]'s short-lived, late-night television talk show, ''[[90 Minutes Live]]''. That same year, as a member of Toronto's branch of the Second City,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secondcity.com/?id=history/alumni/toronto Second City Toronto Alumni] at [http://www.secondcity.com/ Second City] (accessed April 7, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; he gained wide North American popularity, which grew when he became a cast member on the influential Toronto-based comedy-variety show ''Second City Television'' (''SCTV''). [[NBC]] picked the show up in 1981 and it quickly became a fan favourite. It had won [[Emmy Award]]s for the show's writing in 1981 and 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/john-candy-9542625|title=John Candy Biography|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=January 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s career===
Among Candy's ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]'' characters were unscrupulous street-beat TV personality Johnny LaRue, 3-D horror [[auteur]] Doctor Tongue, [[sycophant]]ic and easily amused talk-show sidekick William B. Williams, and Melonville's corrupt Mayor Tommy Shanks. Other characters included the cheerful Leutonian clarinetist Yosh Shmenge, who was half of the [[The Shmenge Brothers|Happy Wanderers]] and the subject of the [[mockumentary]] ''[[The Last Polka]]'', folksy fishin' musician Gil Fisher, handsome if accent-challenged TV actor Steve Roman, Pippy Long Socks, hapless children's entertainer Mr. Messenger, corrupt soap-opera doctor William Wainwright, [[Smut (comics)|smut]] merchant Harry, "the Guy With the Snake on His Face", and Giorgy, "everyone's favourite Cossack".{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Mimicry was one of Candy's talents, which he used often at ''SCTV''. Celebrities impersonated by Candy include [[Jerry Mathers]], [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], [[Orson Welles]], [[Julia Child]], [[Richard Burton]], Silvio Gigante, [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Jimmy the Greek]], [[Andrew Sarris]], [[Tip O'Neill]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Curly Howard]], [[Merlin Olsen]], [[Jackie Gleason]], [[Tom Selleck]], [[Gordon Pinsent]], [[Darryl Sittler]], [[Ed Asner]], [[Gertrude Stein]], Morgy Kneele, [[Doug McGrath]], and [[Hervé Villechaize]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 1979, Candy took a short [[hiatus (television)|hiatus]] from ''SCTV'' and began a more active film career, appearing in a minor role as a US Army soldier in [[Steven Spielberg]]'s big-budget comedy ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]'' and had a supporting role as parole officer Burton Mercer in ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. A year later, Candy played the lovable, mild-mannered Army recruit Dewey Oxberger in 1981's ''Stripes'', one of the most successful films of the year. In 1983, Candy had a cameo appearance in [[Harold Ramis]]'s ''[[National Lampoon's Vacation]]'' and appeared on ''Saturday Night Live'' twice (hosting in 1983) while still appearing on ''SCTV''. According to writer-comedian [[Bob Odenkirk]], Candy was reputedly the "most-burned potential host" of ''SNL'', in that he was asked to host many times, only for plans to be changed by the ''SNL'' staff at the last minute.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shales &amp; James Andrew Miller, ''Live From New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live'' (Little Brown &amp; Co., 2002), p. 345&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Candy headlined in the film ''[[Going Berserk]]'', and was also approached to play the character of accountant Louis Tully in ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' (completed and released in 1984), but ultimately did not get the role because of his conflicting ideas of how to play the character; the part went instead to Rick Moranis. Candy was one of the many celebrities who appeared chanting "Ghostbusters" in [[Ray Parker, Jr.]]'s hit "[[Ghostbusters (song)|single]]" for the movie. In 1984, Candy played [[Tom Hanks]]'s womanizing brother in the hit romantic comedy '' [[Splash (film)|Splash]]'', generally considered his break-out role.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Throughout the latter half of the 1980s, Candy often took roles in substandard films (performing the voice of a talking horse in the [[Bobcat Goldthwait]] comedy ''[[Hot to Trot]]''). While continuing to play supporting roles in films such as ''[[Spaceballs]]'', Candy headlined or co-starred in such comedy movies as ''[[Volunteers (film)|Volunteers]]'', ''[[Planes, Trains and Automobiles]]'', ''[[Brewster's Millions (1985 film)|Brewster's Millions]]'', ''[[The Great Outdoors (film)|The Great Outdoors]]'', ''[[Armed and Dangerous (1986 film)|Armed and Dangerous]]'', ''[[Who's Harry Crumb?]]'', ''[[Summer Rental]]'', and ''[[Uncle Buck]]''.
He also continued to play bit parts, including a disc jockey in the comic musical film ''[[Little Shop of Horrors (film)|Little Shop of Horrors]]'' and a policeman in the ''[[Sesame Street]]'' film ''[[Sesame Street Presents Follow That Bird|Follow That Bird]]''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Candy also produced and starred in a Saturday-morning animated series on NBC titled ''[[Camp Candy]]'' in 1989. The show was set in a fictional summer camp run by Candy, featured his two children in supporting roles, and also spawned a brief comic book series published by [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Star Comics]] imprint.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Later years and death (1990–1994)===
In the early 1990s, Candy's career went into a slight decline after he appeared in a string of critical and commercial failures, including ''[[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing but Trouble]]'' (for which he was nominated for a [[Razzie]] as "worst supporting actress", playing a woman), ''[[Delirious (1991 film)|Delirious]]'', and ''[[Once Upon a Crime]]'', although he did appear in major successes such as ''[[Rookie of the Year (film)|Rookie of the Year]]'' (uncredited), ''[[The Rescuers Down Under]]'', ''[[Home Alone]]'', and ''[[Cool Runnings]]''. Candy attempted to reinvigorate his acting career by broadening his range and playing more dramatic roles. In 1991, Candy appeared in a light romantic drama, ''[[Only the Lonely (film)|Only the Lonely]]'', which had him as a Chicago cop torn between his overbearing mother ([[Maureen O'Hara]]) and his new girlfriend ([[Ally Sheedy]]). The same year and in rare form, Candy played a dramatic role as [[Dean Andrews Jr.]], a shady Southern lawyer in [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]''. He made his directorial debut in the 1994 comedy ''[[Hostage for a Day]]'', in which he also made a cameo appearance.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 1991, [[Bruce McNall]], [[Wayne Gretzky]], and Candy became owners of the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Toronto Argonauts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Schwarz|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/football/tsn-special-remembers-john-candys-impact-on-the-argos/article4184225/|title=TSN special remembers John Candy's impact on the Argos|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|agency=Reuters|date=November 24, 2011|accessdate=December 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebrity ownership group attracted attention in Canada and the team spent a significant amount of money, even signing some highly touted [[National Football League]] prospects such as  wide receiver [[Raghib Ismail]]. The Argonauts took home the [[1991 Grey Cup]], beating Calgary, 36–21, in the final.&lt;ref name="never stopped caring"/&gt;
[[File:John Candy's grave.JPG|thumb|right|Candy's grave at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City]], California]]
In 1994, while on vacation from film production (''[[Wagons East!]]'') in Durango City, Mexico, Candy called his friends, including Canadian Football League commissioner [[Larry Smith (Canadian politician)|Larry Smith]], and told them that he had just let go of his team and was putting it up for sale. He then called his assistant, who invited Candy to play golf with him in the spring when he returned to Toronto. After cooking a late lasagna dinner for his assistants, Candy called his co-stars from his hotel, then went to sleep. Some time after midnight, on March 4, 1994, Candy was found dead from a presumed [[myocardial infarction]] even though this was unproven, as no autopsy was performed. He was 43 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=No drugs were involved in Candy's death|author=Reuters|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=March 6, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Glenn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/20/obituaries/john-candy-comedic-film-star-is-dead-of-a-heart-attack-at-44.html|title=John Candy, Comedic Film Star, Is Dead of a heart attack at 44|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1994|accessdate=January 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavyset Candy had struggled for some years with weight-related health issues.&lt;ref name="New York Times"/&gt;

Candy and his wife, Rosemary Hobor, had two children, Christopher Michael and Jennifer Anne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/john-candy-remembered-his-children-939218|title=John Candy Remembered: His Children Share New Stories About Their Late Father On the Eve of His Birthday|first=Ryan|last=Parker|date=October 24, 2016|access-date=August 24, 2018|magazine=[[Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unfinished projects===
Candy was in talks to portray Ignatius J. Reilly in a now-shelved film adaptation of [[John Kennedy Toole]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel ''[[A Confederacy of Dunces]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fretts|first=Bruce|title=''A Confederacy of Dunces'' celebrates its 20th anniversary|magazine=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2000/05/19/confederacy-dunces-celebrates-its-20th-anniversary|date=May 19, 2000|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hyman|first=Peter|title=A Conspiracy of Dunces: Will John Kennedy Toole's comic masterpiece ever reach the big screen?|date=December 14, 2006|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/hollywood/2006/12/a_conspiracy_of_dunces.html|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=10 Actors Who Came Close to Starring in 'A Confederacy of Dunces'|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2013/03/8-actors-who-came-close-to-starring-in-a-confederacy-of-dunces/|date=March 28, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had also expressed interest in portraying [[Atuk]] in a film adaptation of [[Mordecai Richler]]'s ''[[The Incomparable Atuk]]'' and [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]] in a biopic based on the [[silent film]] comedian's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Raouf|first=Neda|title=The 'Atuk' Curse|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/21/magazine/tm-10276|date=February 21, 1999|accessdate=August 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bovsun|first=Mara|title=Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle, acquitted for murder of Virginia Rappe in 1922, never recovered from all the bad press|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/justice-story/roscoe-fatty-arbuckle-acquitted-murder-virginia-rappe-1922-recovered-bad-press-article-1.1149824|date=September 1, 2012|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three shelved projects have been referred to as "cursed" because Candy, [[John Belushi]], [[Sam Kinison]] and [[Chris Farley]] were each attached to all three roles, and they all died before they could make any of these films.&lt;ref name=split /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of John Belushi|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/03/the-lost-roles-of-john-belushi/|date=March 3, 2011|accessdate=August 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candy was originally considered to play [[Alec Guinness]]'s role in the [[Last Holiday (2006 film)|remake]] of the 1950 film, ''[[Last Holiday (1950 film)|Last Holiday]]'', with [[Carl Reiner]] directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Siskel|first=Gene|title=Sour Movies Keep Candy Just Short Of Sweet Success|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-30/entertainment/8601230533_1_sctv-film-summer-rental/3|date=March 30, 1986|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the role was played by [[Queen Latifah]] in a [[Last Holiday (2006 film)|loose remake]] released in 2006.&lt;ref name=split&gt;{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Bradford|title=The Lost Roles of John Candy|publisher=[[Splitsider]]|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/06/the-lost-roles-of-john-candy/|date=June 2, 2011|accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Candy had the comic relief role of the turkey Red Feather in the animated Disney film ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' written for him. The role was subsequently cut from the film after his death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vulture.com/2011/06/the-lost-roles-of-john-candy.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Candy's funeral was held at [[St. Martin of Tours Catholic Church]] in Los Angeles. Candy was entombed in the mausoleum at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in Culver City, California. His crypt lies just above fellow actor [[Fred MacMurray]]. On March 18, 1994, a special memorial service for Candy, produced by his former improvization troupe, the Second City, was broadcast across Canada.&lt;ref name="chtv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/chtv/hamilton/info/history.html|title=CH Hamilton|publisher=CanWest MediaWorks Publications Inc.|accessdate=January 29, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060129104620/http://www.canada.com/chtv/hamilton/info/history.html|archivedate=January 29, 2006|df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John Candy Star on Canada's Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|left|Candy's star on Canada's Walk of Fame|193x193px]]
''Wagons East!'' was completed using a stunt double and special effects and released five months after Candy's death. His final completed film was ''Canadian Bacon'', a satirical comedy by [[Michael Moore]] that was released a year after Candy's death. Candy played American sheriff Bud Boomer, who led an "invasion" of Canada. Candy recorded a voice for the TV film ''[[The Magic 7]]'' in the early 1990s. The film remained in production for years due to animation difficulties and production delays, and it was shelved. Candy was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]]. In May 2006, Candy became one of the first four entertainers ever honoured by [[Canada Post]] by being featured on a postage stamp. ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' is dedicated to three people, including Candy, who played a supporting role in the original ''Blues Brothers''. A tribute to Candy was hosted by [[Dan Aykroyd]] at the [[2007 Grey Cup]] festivities in Toronto in November 2007.&lt;ref name="never stopped caring"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20071121.wsptbrunt21/BNStory/STEPHEN+BRUNT/|title=Candy never stopped caring|last=Brunt|first=Stephen|date=November 21, 2007|newspaper=Globe and Mail|accessdate=October 5, 2009|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ween]]'s ''[[Chocolate and Cheese]]'' album, released in 1994, is "dedicated in loving memory to John Candy (1950–1994)". At the time Gene Ween remarked, "there was so much going on about Kurt Cobain, and nobody mentioned John Candy at all. I have a special little spot in my heart for him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/ween-19950406|title=Q&amp;A: Ween|publisher=rollingstone.com|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The John Candy Visual Arts Studio at [[Neil McNeil Catholic High School]], in Toronto, was dedicated in his honour after his death. Candy, one of the school's most famous alumni, said during one of his annual visits to the school, "My success is simply rooted in the values and discipline and respect for others that I was taught at Neil McNeil." Candy's daughter, Jennifer Candy, is an actress and television producer, having production credits for the television series ''[[Prom Queen]]'' and ''[[Sam Has 7 Friends]]''.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Support has been growing for giving the [[Canadian Screen Awards]] the official nickname "The Candys," both in honour of the actor and because the name suggests Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howell|first=Peter|title=Chair of Canadian film/TV academy is sweet on calling awards 'the Candys'|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/movies/2016/03/14/chair-of-canadian-filmtv-academy-is-sweet-on-calling-awards-the-candys.html|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=March 15, 2016|accessdate=March 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|Keen (disambiguation)}}

'''Keening''' is a traditional form of vocal [[lament]] for the dead.

==Etymology==
"Keen" as a noun or verb comes from the [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] term ''caoineadh'' ("to cry, to weep") and references to it from the seventh, eighth and twelfth centuries are extensive.

==History==
Written sources that refer to the practice in [[Ireland]] and Gaelic [[Scotland]] appear from the sixteenth century on. 

The Irish tradition of keening over the body during the funeral procession and at the burial site is distinct from the [[wake (ceremony) |wake]] — the practice of watching over the corpse – which takes place the night before the burial, and may last for more than one night. 

The "keen" itself is thought to have been constituted of stock poetic elements (the listing of the genealogy of the deceased, praise for the deceased, emphasis on the woeful condition of those left behind etc.) set to vocal lament. While generally carried out by one or several women, a chorus may have been intoned by all present. Physical movements involving rocking, kneeling or clapping accompanied the keening woman (''bean chaointe'') who was often paid for her services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Breandán Ó Madagáin, Caointe agus Seancheolta Eile |trans-title=Keening and other Old Irish Musics | language = ga | publisher = Cló Iar-Chonnachta | place = [[Ireland |IE]] | year = 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Millington Synge]]'s one-act play ''[[Riders to the Sea]]'' features a chorus of women from the [[Aran Islands]] mourning the death of their loved ones at sea.

According to T. R. Georgevitch (Đorđević), writing in 1918 about the eastern highlands of Serbia, in the region of [[Zaječar District|Zaječar]], the killing was carried out with an axe or stick, and the entire village was invited to attend. In some places corn mush was put on the head of the victim to make it seem as if the corn, not the family, was the killer.&lt;ref name="folk-lore"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Georgevitch|first=T. R.|date=3 September 1918|title=The Killing of the Khazar Kings|journal=Folk-Lore|publisher=Folk-Lore Society|location=London|volume=29|issue=3|pages=238–247|jstor=1255454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgevitch suggests that this legend may have originated in tales surrounding the [[Moesia Superior|Roman occupation]] of local forts.&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Romans ... were very bellicose people. Their leader ordered all the holders of the fort up to forty years of age to be active fighters, from forty to fifty to be guards of the fort, and after fifty to be killed, because they have no military value. Since that period the old men were killed.&lt;ref name="folk-lore"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Anthropologist [[Senka Kovač]], in a study on aging, mentions that the name "lapot" is given to this custom of killing the elderly in eastern Serbia.&lt;ref name=kovac/&gt;

In a study published in 1999, Bojan Jovanović argues that earlier anthropologists such as Trojanović, Georgevitch, and Čajkanović had confused myth with reality and that the well-known story of a grandson who had hidden his grandfather to protect him from lapot after a bad harvest, bringing him back to the village when the old man's wisdom had shown a way to survive, was the basis for establishing that the old should be respected for their knowledge and wise counsel.&lt;ref&gt;

The tradition was the topic of the 1972 TV [[docudrama]] ''Legenda o Lapotu'' (''The Legend of Lapot'') by [[Goran Paskaljevic]], in which after a bad harvest, an elderly man who can no longer work is ritually slain.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Life Expectancy at Birth by Region 1950-2050.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Human life expectancy at birth, measured by region, between 1950 and 2050]]

'''Life expectancy''' is a statistical measure of the average time an organism is expected to live, based on the year of its birth, its current age and other [[demographic]] factors including gender. The most commonly used measure of life expectancy is at birth (LEB), which can be defined in two ways. ''Cohort'' LEB is the mean length of life of an actual birth [[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]] (all individuals born a given year) and can be computed only for cohorts born many decades ago, so that all their members have died. ''Period'' LEB is the mean length of life of a [[hypothesis|hypothetical]] cohort assumed to be exposed, from birth through death,  to the [[mortality rate]]s observed at a given year.&lt;ref&gt;S. Shryok, J. S. Siegel et al. The Methods and Materials of Demography. Washington, DC, US Bureau of the Census, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

National LEB figures reported by statistical national agencies and international organizations are indeed estimates of ''period'' LEB. In the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]], LEB was 26 years; the 2010 world LEB was 67.2 years. For recent years, in [[Swaziland]] LEB is about 49, and in [[Japan]], it is about 83. The combination of high [[infant mortality]] and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of 70 would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 may have few people dying at precisely 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate of death in the first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, LEB can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low LEB will necessarily have a small proportion of older people.&lt;ref name="Laden2011"&gt;{{cite news|author=Laden, Greg|url=http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/05/01/falsehood-if-this-was-the-ston/|title=Falsehood: "If this was the Stone Age, I’d be dead by now"|work=ScienceBlogs|date=2011-05-01|accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five but everybody else dies at exactly 70 years old, LEB will be about 36, but about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood; in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at 5 would be another 65. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used along individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.

Mathematically, life expectancy is the mean number of years of life remaining at a given age, assuming age-specific mortality rates remain at their most recently measured levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur O'Sullivan|authorlink=Arthur O'Sullivan (economist)|author2=Steven M. Sheffrin|title=Economics: Principles in Action|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|year=2003|page=473|isbn=0-13-063085-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is denoted by &lt;math&gt;e_x&lt;/math&gt;,{{ref|exsymbol|[a]}} which means the mean number of subsequent years of life for someone now aged &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, according to a particular [[wikt:mortality|mortality]] experience.  [[Longevity claims|Longevity]], maximum lifespan, and life expectancy are not synonyms. Life expectancy is defined statistically as the mean number of years remaining for an individual or a group of people at a given age. Longevity refers to the characteristics of the relatively long life span of some members of a population. Maximum lifespan is the age at death for the longest-lived individual of a species. Moreover, because life expectancy is an average, a particular person may die many years before or many years after the "expected" survival. The term "[[maximum life span]]" has a quite different meaning and is more related to longevity.

Life expectancy is also used in plant or animal [[ecology]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Life Histories of Mammals: An Analysis of Life Tables|author1=John S. Millar|author2=Richard M. Zammuto|journal=Ecology|volume=64|issue=4|year=1983|pages=631–635|doi=10.2307/1937181|publisher=Ecological Society of America|jstor=1937181}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[life table]]s (also known as [[actuary|actuarial tables]]). The term life expectancy may also be used in the context of manufactured objects,&lt;ref name=machine/&gt; but the related term [[shelf life]] is used for consumer products, and the terms "mean time to breakdown" (MTTB) and "[[mean time between failures]]" (MTBF) are used in engineering.

The oldest confirmed recorded age for any human is 122 years, reached by [[Jeanne Calment]] who lived between 1875–1997.

===Variation over time===
{{further information|Longevity}}
The following information is derived from the 1961 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and other sources, some with questionable accuracy. Unless otherwise stated, it represents estimates of the life expectancies of the [[world population]] as a whole. In many instances, life expectancy varied considerably according to class and gender.

Life expectancy at birth takes account of [[infant mortality]] but not prenatal mortality.

&lt;/center&gt;
Life expectancy increases with age as the individual survives the higher mortality rates associated with childhood. For instance, the table above listed the life expectancy at birth among 13th-century English nobles at 30. Having survived until the age of 21, a male member of the English aristocracy in this period could expect to live:&lt;ref name="Expectations of Life"/&gt;
*1200–1300: to age 64
*1300–1400: to age 45 (because of the [[bubonic plague]])
*1400–1500: to age 69
*1500–1550: to age 71

In a similar way, the life expectancy of scholars in the [[Islamic Golden Age|Medieval Islamic world]] was 59&amp;ndash;84.3 years.&lt;ref name="Jaques"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ahmad246"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bulliet111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shatzmiller"/&gt;

17th-century English life expectancy was only about 35 years, largely because infant and child mortality remained high. Life expectancy was under 25 years in the early [[Colony of Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.stratfordhall.org/educational-resources/teacher-resources/medicine-health/]", Stratfordhall.org.&lt;/ref&gt; and in seventeenth-century New England, about 40 per cent died before reaching adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/usdeath.cfm Death in Early America] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230203658/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/historyonline/usdeath.cfm |date=December 30, 2010}}". Digital History.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Industrial Revolution]], the life expectancy of children increased dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/387301/modernization/12022/Population-change Modernization - Population Change]".

Published: May 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Public health]] measures are credited with much of the recent increase in life expectancy.

===Regional variations===

There are great variations in life expectancy between different parts of the world, mostly caused by differences in [[public health]], medical care, and diet. The impact of [[AIDS]] on life expectancy is particularly notable in many African countries. According to projections made by the United Nations (UN) in 2002, the life expectancy at birth for 2010–2015 (if [[HIV/AIDS]] did not exist) would have been:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/wpp2002/WPP2002-HIGHLIGHTSrev1.PDFUN|title="World Population Prospects—The 2002 Revision", 2003, page 24|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*69.9 years instead of 41.5 years {{Flag|South Africa}}
*70.5 years instead of 31.8 years {{Flag|Zimbabwe}}

Actual life expectancy in Botswana declined from 65 in 1990 to 49 in 2000 before increasing to 66 in 2011. In South Africa, life expectancy was 63 in 1990, 57 in 2000, and 58 in 2011. And in Zimbabwe, life expectancy was 60 in 1990, 43 in 2000, and 54 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688?lang=en|title=GHO—By category—Life expectancy—Data by country|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last 200 years, African countries have generally not had the same improvements in mortality rates that have been enjoyed by countries in Asia, Latin America, and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wealth &amp; Health of Nations|url=http://www.gapminder.org/world/#$majorMode=chart$is;shi=t;ly=2003;lb=f;il=t;fs=11;al=30;stl=t;st=t;nsl=t;se=t$wst;tts=C$ts;sp=5.59290322580644;ti=2013$zpv;v=0$inc_x;mmid=XCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj1jiMAkmq1iMg;by=ind$inc_y;mmid=YCOORDS;iid=phAwcNAVuyj2tPLxKvvnNPA;by=ind$inc_s;uniValue=8.21;iid=phAwcNAVuyj0XOoBL_n5tAQ;by=ind$inc_c;uniValue=255;gid=CATID0;by=grp$map_x;scale=log;dataMin=194;dataMax=96846$map_y;scale=lin;dataMin=23;dataMax=86$map_s;sma=49;smi=2.65$cd;bd=0$inds=;example=75|publisher=Gapminder|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Life Expectancy &amp;#124; Visual Data|url=http://www.bestliferates.org/blog/life-expectancy/|publisher=BestLifeRates.org|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, African-American people have shorter life expectancies than their European-American counterparts. For example, white Americans born in 2010 are expected to live until age 78.9, but black Americans only until age 75.1. This 3.8-year gap, however, is the lowest it has been since 1975 at the latest. The greatest difference was 7.1 years in 1993.&lt;ref name="Final 2010 data"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr61/nvsr61_04.pdf "Deaths: Final Data for 2010", ''National Vital Statistics Reports'', authored by Sherry L. Murphy, Jiaquan Xu, and Kenneth D. Kochanek, volume 61, number 4, page 12, 8 May 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Asian-American women live the longest of all ethnic groups in the United States, with a life expectancy of 85.8 years.&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Minority Health—[http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=2&amp;lvlID=53 Asian American/Pacific Islander Profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204024943/http://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/templates/browse.aspx?lvl=2&amp;lvlid=53|date=February 4, 2012}}. Retrieved October 1, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The life expectancy of Hispanic Americans is 81.2 years.&lt;ref name="Final 2010 data"/&gt; According to the new government reports in the USA, life expectancy in the country dropped again because of the rise in suicide and drug overdose rates. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) found nearly 70,000 more Americans died in 2017 than 2016, with rising rates of death among 25- to 44-year-olds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46389147|title=Drug and suicide deaths rise as US life expectancy drops|date=November 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cities also experience a wide range of life expectancy based on neighborhood breakdowns. This is largely due to economic clustering and poverty conditions that tend to associate based on geographic location. Multi-generational poverty found in struggling neighborhoods also contributes. In United States cities such as [[Cincinnati]], the life expectancy gap between low income and high income neighborhoods touches 20 years.&lt;ref name=waterfields&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterfieldsllc.com/about-waterfields/social-mission/root-causes-poverty/|title=The Root Causes of Poverty|publisher=Waterfields|accessdate=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic circumstances===
Economic circumstances also affect life expectancy. For example, in the United Kingdom, life expectancy in the wealthiest and richest areas is several years higher than in the poorest areas. This may reflect factors such as diet and lifestyle, as well as access to medical care. It may also reflect a selective effect: people with chronic life-threatening illnesses are less likely to become wealthy or to reside in affluent areas.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Health—[http://www.dh.gov.uk/PublicationsAndStatistics/Publications/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidance/PublicationsPolicyAndGuidanceArticle/fs/en?CONTENT_ID=4117696&amp;chk=OXFbWI Tackling health inequalities]: Status report on the Programme for Action&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Glasgow]], the disparity is [[Glasgow effect|amongst the highest in the world]]: life expectancy for males in the heavily deprived [[Calton, Glasgow|Calton]] area stands at 54, which is 28 years less than in the affluent area of [[Lenzie]], which is only 8&amp;nbsp;km away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/7584056.stm#Life%20expectancy|title=Social factors key to ill health|date=August 28, 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=August 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/7584450.stm|title=GP explains life expectancy gap|date=August 28, 2008|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=August 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study found a pronounced relationship between [[economic inequality]] and life expectancy.&lt;ref name=WaPoLifespan&gt;{{cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Michael A.|title=Research ties economic inequality to gap in life expectancy|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/research-ties-economic-inequality-to-gap-in-life-expectancy/2013/03/10/c7a323c4-7094-11e2-8b8d-e0b59a1b8e2a_story.html|accessdate=March 23, 2013|newspaper=Washington Post|date=March 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study by José A. Tapia Granados and Ana Diez Roux at the [[University of Michigan]] found that life expectancy actually increased during the [[Great Depression]], and during recessions and depressions in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/09/090928172530.htm|title=Did The Great Depression Have A Silver Lining? Life Expectancy Increased By 6.2 Years|date=September 29, 2009|accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors suggest that when people are working extra hard during good economic times, they undergo more [[stress (biology)|stress]], exposure to [[pollution]], and likelihood of injury among other longevity-limiting factors.

Life expectancy is also likely to be affected by exposure to high levels of [[roadway air dispersion model|highway air pollution]] or industrial [[air pollution]]. This is one way that occupation can have a major effect on life expectancy. Coal miners (and in prior generations, asbestos cutters) often have lower life expediencies than average life expediencies. Other factors affecting an individual's life expectancy are genetic disorders, drug use, [[tobacco smoking]], excessive alcohol consumption, obesity, access to health care, diet and exercise.

In the [[uterus]], male fetuses have a higher mortality rate (babies are conceived in a ratio estimated to be from 107 to 170 males to 100 females, but the ratio at birth in the United States is only 105 males to 100 females).&lt;ref&gt;Kalben, Barbara Blatt.

In the past, [[maternal death|mortality rates for females in child-bearing age groups]] were higher than for males at the same age. This is no longer the case, and female human life expectancy is considerably higher than that of males. The reasons for this are not entirely certain. Traditional arguments tend to favor sociology-environmental factors: historically, men have generally consumed more [[tobacco]], [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] and [[drug]]s than women in most societies, and are more likely to die from many associated diseases such as [[lung cancer]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[Cirrhosis|cirrhosis of the liver]].&lt;ref name=worldhealth/&gt; Men are also more likely to die from injuries, whether unintentional (such as [[Occupational safety and health|occupational]], [[war]] or [[car accidents]]) or intentional ([[suicide]]).&lt;ref name=worldhealth&gt;{{cite web|author=World Health Organization|year=2004|work=The world health report 2004 - changing history|title=Annex Table 2: Deaths by cause, sex and mortality stratum in WHO regions, estimates for 2002|url=http://www.who.int/entity/whr/2004/annex/topic/en/annex_2_en.pdf|accessdate=November 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men are also more likely to die from most of the leading causes of death (some already stated above) than women. Some of these in the United States include: cancer of the respiratory system, motor vehicle accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver, emphysema, prostate cancer, and coronary heart disease.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt; These far outweigh the female mortality rate from breast cancer and cervical cancer.

Some argue that shorter male life expectancy is merely another manifestation of the general rule, seen in all mammal species, that larger (size) individuals (within a species) tend, on average, to have shorter lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jerrymondo.tripod.com/lgev/id1.html|title=Telemores, sexual size dimorphism and gender gap in life expectancy |publisher=Jerrymondo.tripod.com|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Samaras Thomas T., Heigh Gregory H.|title=How human size affects longevity and mortality from degenerative diseases|journal=Townsend Letter for Doctors &amp; Patients|volume=159|issue=78–85|pages=133–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; This biological difference occurs because women have more resistance to infections and degenerative diseases.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

In her extensive review of the existing literature, Kalben concluded that the fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, today males in all parts of the world experience greater mortality than females. Kalben's study, however, was restricted to data in Western Europe alone, where demographic transition occurred relatively early. In countries such as Hungary, Bulgaria, India and China, males continued to outlive females into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Living Standards in the Past: New Perspectives on Well-Being in Asia and Europe
edited by Robert C. Allen, Tommy Bengtsson, Martin Dribe&lt;/ref&gt;  Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. With the exception of birds, for almost all of the animal species studied, males have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in people is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.&lt;ref&gt;Kalben, Barbara Blatt.

There is a recent suggestion that [[mitochondria]]l mutations that shorten lifespan continue to be expressed in males (but less so in females) because mitochondria are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, [[natural selection]] weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival; therefore such mitochondria are less likely to be passed on to the next generation. This thus suggests that females tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-19093442|title=Fruit flies offer DNA clue to why women live longer|date=August 2, 2012|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]], [[PZ Myers]] [http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2013/02/06/mothers-curse/ Mother's Curse]&lt;/ref&gt;

In developed countries, starting around 1880, death rates decreased faster among women, leading to differences in mortality rates between males and females. Before 1880 death rates were the same. In people born after 1900, the death rate of 50- to 70-year-old men was double that of women of the same age. Cardiovascular disease was the main cause of the higher death rates among men. Men may be more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease than women, but this susceptibility was evident only after deaths from other causes, such as infections, started to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=When Did Women Start to Outlive Men?|url=http://www.livescience.com/51455-women-outlive-men.html|accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centenarians===
{{Main|Centenarian}}
In developed countries, the number of [[centenarian]]s is increasing at approximately 5.5% per year, which means doubling the centenarian population every 13 years, pushing it from some 455,000 in 2009 to 4.1 million in 2050.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations [https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/WPA2009/WPA2009-report.pdf "World Population Ageing 2009"]; ST/ESA/SER.A/295, Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations, New York, Oct. 2010, liv + 73 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan is the country with the highest ratio of centenarians (347 for every 1 million inhabitants in September 2010).

==Evolution and aging rate==
{{Main|Life history theory}}

Various species of plants and animals, including humans, have different lifespans. Evolutionary theory states that organisms that, by virtue of their defenses or lifestyle, live for long periods and avoid accidents, disease, predation, etc. are likely to have genes that code for slow aging, which often translates to good cellular repair. One theory is that if predation or accidental deaths prevent most individuals from living to an old age, there will be less natural selection to increase the intrinsic life span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Williams G|title=Pleiotropy, natural selection, and the evolution of senescence|journal=Evolution|volume=11|pages=398–411|year=1957|doi=10.2307/2406060|issue=4|publisher=Society for the Study of Evolution|jstor=2406060}}&lt;/ref&gt; That finding was supported in a classic study of opossums by Austad;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Austad SN|title=Retarded senescence in an insular population of Virginia opossums|journal=J.

==Calculation==
{{further|Life table#The mathematics}}
[[File:Survivaltree.png|thumb|A survival tree to explain the calculations of life-expectancy. Red numbers indicate chance of survival at a specific age, and blue ones indicate age-specific death rates.]]

The starting point for calculating life expectancy is the [[age-specific death rate]]s of the population members. If a large number of data is available, a [[statistical population]] can be created that allow the age-specific death rates to be simply taken as the mortality rates actually experienced at each age (the number of deaths divided by the number of years "exposed to risk" in each data cell). However, it is customary to apply smoothing to iron out, as much as possible, the random statistical fluctuations from one year of age to the next. In the past, a very simple model used for this purpose was the [[Gompertz function]], but more sophisticated methods are now used.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Robert N. (1999) Method for constructing complete annual U.S. life tables. Vital and health statistics. Series 2, Data evaluation and methods research; no. 129 (DHHS publication no. (PHS) 99-1329) [https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_02/sr02_129.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

These are the most common methods now used for that purpose:
*to fit a mathematical formula, such as an extension of the Gompertz function, to the data,
*for relatively small amounts of data, to look at an established [[mortality table]] that was previously derived for a larger population and make a simple adjustment to it (as multiply by a constant factor) to fit the data.
*with a large number of data, one looks at the mortality rates actually experienced at each age, and applies smoothing (as by [[cubic splines]]).

While the data required are easily identified in the case of humans, the computation of life expectancy of industrial products and wild animals involves more indirect techniques. The life expectancy and demography of wild animals are often estimated by capturing, marking, and recapturing them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Linda J. Young|Linda J Young]]; Jerry H Young (1998) Statistical ecology: a population perspective. Kluwer Academic Publishers, p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; The life of a product, more often termed [[shelf life]], is also computed using similar methods. In the case of long-lived components, such as those used in critical applications: in aircraft, methods like [[accelerated aging]] are used to model the life expectancy of a component.&lt;ref name=machine&gt;Eliahu Zahavi, Vladimir Torbilo &amp; Solomon Press (1996) Fatigue Design: Life Expectancy of Machine Parts. CRC Press. {{ISBN|0-8493-8970-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The age-specific death rates are calculated separately for separate groups of data that are believed to have different mortality rates (such as males and females, and perhaps smokers and non-smokers if data are available separately for those groups) and are then used to calculate a [[life table]] from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. In [[actuarial notation]], the probability of surviving from age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to age &lt;math&gt;x+n&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;\,_np_x\!&lt;/math&gt; and the probability of dying during age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (between ages &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt;) is denoted &lt;math&gt;q_x\!&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if 10% of a group of people alive at their 90th birthday die before their 91st birthday, the age-specific death probability at 90 would be 10%. That is a probability, not a mortality rate.

The expected future lifetime of a life age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in whole years (the ''curtate expected lifetime'' of ''(x)'') is denoted by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\,e_x\!&lt;/math&gt;.{{ref|exsymbol2|[a]}} It is the conditional expected future lifetime (in whole years), assuming survival to age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;K(x)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the curtate future lifetime at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;e_x = E[K(x)] = \sum_{k=0}^\infty k\, Pr(K(x)=k) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}k\, \,_kp_x \,\, q_{x+k}.&lt;/math&gt; 
Substituting &lt;math&gt;{}_kp_x \, q_{x+k} = {}_k p_x - {}_{k+1}p_x&lt;/math&gt; in the sum and simplifying gives the equivalent formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Models for Quantifying Risk|edition=Third|author1=R. Cunningham|author2=T. Herzog|author3=R. London|publisher=Actex|year=2008|isbn=978-1-56698-676-2}} page 92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;math&gt;e_x = \sum_{k=1}^\infty {} \, _k p_x.&lt;/math&gt; If the assumption is made that on average, people live a half year in the year of death, the complete expectation of future lifetime at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt; e_x + 1/2&lt;/math&gt;.{{clarify|date=October 2014}}

Life expectancy is by definition an [[arithmetic mean]]. It can also be calculated by integrating the survival curve from 0 to positive infinity (or equivalently to the maximum lifespan, sometimes called 'omega'). For an extinct or completed [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]] (all people born in year 1850, for example), it can of course simply be calculated by averaging the ages at death. For cohorts with some survivors, it is estimated by using mortality experience in recent years. The estimates are called period cohort life expectancies.

It is important to note that the statistic is usually based on past mortality experience and assumes that the same age-specific mortality rates will continue into the future. Thus, such life expectancy figures need to be adjusted for temporal trends before calculating how long a currently living individual of a particular age is expected to live. Period life expectancy remains a commonly used statistic to summarize the current health status of a population.

However, for some purposes, such as pensions calculations, it is usual to adjust the life table used by assuming that age-specific death rates will continue to decrease over the years, as they have usually done in the past. That is often done by simply extrapolating past trends; but some models exist to account for the evolution of mortality like the [[Lee–Carter model]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. Lee and Lawrence Carter. 1992. "Modeling and Forecasting the Time Series of U.S. Mortality," ''Journal of the American Statistical Association'' 87 (September): 659-671.&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed above, on an individual basis, a number of factors correlate with a longer life. Factors that are associated with variations in life expectancy include family history, marital status, economic status, physique, exercise, diet, drug use including smoking and alcohol consumption, disposition, education, environment, sleep, climate, and health care.&lt;ref name="Santrock"/&gt;

==Healthy life expectancy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
In order to assess the quality of these additional years of life, 'healthy life expectancy' has been calculated for the last 30 years. Since 2001, the World Health Organization has published statistics called Healthy life expectancy (HALE), defined as the average number of years that a person can expect to live in "full health" excluding the years lived in less than full health due to disease and/or injury&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/indhale/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Health Status Statistics: Mortality|website=www.who.int|accessdate=2018-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Since 2004, [[Eurostat]] publishes annual statistics called [[Healthy Life Years]] (HLY) based on reported activity limitations. The [[United States]] uses similar indicators in the framework of the national health promotion and disease prevention plan "[[Healthy People 2010]]". More and more countries are using health expectancy indicators to monitor the health of their population.

==Forecasting==
Forecasting life expectancy and mortality forms an important subdivision of [[demography]]. Future trends in life expectancy have huge implications for old-age support programs like [[U.S. Social Security]] and [[pension]] since the cash flow in these systems depends on the number of recipients who are still living (along with the rate of return on the investments or the tax rate in [[pay-as-you-go tax|pay-as-you-go]] systems). With longer life expectancies, the systems see increased cash outflow; if the systems underestimate increases in life-expectancies, they will be unprepared for the large payments that will occur, as humans live longer and longer.

Life expectancy forecasting is usually based on two different approaches:
*Forecasting the life expectancy directly, generally using [[ARIMA]] or other time series extrapolation procedures: that has the advantage of simplicity, but it cannot account for changes in mortality at specific ages, and the forecast number cannot be used to derive other [[life table]] results. Analyses and forecasts using this approach can be done with any common statistical/mathematical software package, like [[EViews]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[SAS (software)|SAS]], [[Stata]], [[Matlab]], or [[SPSS]].
*Forecasting age specific [[death rates]] and computing the life expectancy from the results with life table methods: that is usually more complex than simply forecasting life expectancy because the analyst must deal with correlated age-specific mortality rates, but it seems to be more robust than simple one-dimensional time series approaches. It also yields a set of age specific-rates that may be used to derive other measures, such as survival curves or life expectancies at different ages. The most important approach within this group is the [[Lee-Carter Model|Lee-Carter model]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soa.org/library/journals/north-american-actuarial-journal/2000/january/naaj0001_5.pdf|title=The Lee-Carter Method for Forecasting Mortality, with Various Extensions and Applications - SOA|publisher=SOA|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which uses the [[singular value decomposition]] on a set of transformed age-specific mortality rates to reduce their dimensionality to a single time series, forecasts that time series and then recovers a full set of age-specific mortality rates from that forecasted value. Software includes Professor [[Rob J. Hyndman]]'s [https://web.archive.org/web/20100822170736/http://robjhyndman.com/software/demography/ R package called `demography`] and [http://lcfit.demog.berkeley.edu/ UC Berkeley's LCFIT system].

==Policy uses==
Life expectancy is one of the factors in measuring the [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) of each nation along with adult literacy, education, and standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdrstats.undp.org/indicators/6.html|title=International Human Development Indicators—UNDP |publisher=Hdrstats.undp.org|accessdate=November 4, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420030845/http://hdrstats.undp.org/indicators/6.html|archivedate=April 20, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life expectancy is also used in describing the [[physical quality-of-life index|physical quality of life]] of an area or, for an individual when the value of a life settlement is determined a life insurance policy sold for a cash asset.

Disparities in life expectancy are often cited as demonstrating the need for better medical care or increased social support. A strongly associated indirect measure is [[income inequality]]. For the top 21 industrialized countries, if each person is counted equally, life expectancy is lower in more unequal countries (r = −0.907).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://jech.bmj.com/content/59/2/158/F2.expansion Has the relation between income inequality and life expectancy disappeared? Evidence from Italy and top industrialised countries] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109080429/http://jech.bmj.com/content/59/2/158/F2.expansion|date=January 9, 2015}}'' J Epidemiol Community Health 2005;59:158–162.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a similar relationship among states in the US (r = −0.620).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bmj.com/content/312/7037/999 Inequality in income and mortality in the United States: analysis of mortality and potential pathways]'' BMJ 1996, 312:999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life expectancy vs. life span==
Life expectancy differs from [[maximum life span]]. Life expectancy is an average&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wanjek, Christopher|title=Bad Medicine: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Distance Healing to Vitamin O|publisher=Wiley|year=2002|pages=70–71|isbn=0-471-43499-X|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; for all people in the population — including those who die shortly after birth, those who die in early adulthood (e.g. childbirth, war), and those who live unimpeded until old age. Lifespan is an individual-specific concept — maximum lifespan is therefore an upper bound rather than an average.

However, these two terms are often confused with each other to the point that when people hear "life expectancy was 35 years" they often interpret this as meaning that people of that time or place had short maximum life spans.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Wanjek, Christopher|title=Bad Medicine: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Distance Healing to Vitamin O|publisher=Wiley|year=2002|pages=70–71|isbn=047143499X|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such example can be seen in the ''In Search of...'' episode "The Man Who Would Not Die" (About [[Count of St. Germain]]) where it is stated  "Evidence recently discovered in the British Museum indicates that St. Germain may have well been the long lost third son of Rákóczi born in Transylvania in 1694.  If he died in Germany in 1784, he lived 90 years.  The average life expectancy in the 18th century was 35 years. Fifty was a ripe old age.  ''Ninety''... was forever."

In reality, there are other examples of people living significantly longer than the life expectancy of their time period, such as Socrates, Saint Anthony, Michelangelo, and Benjamin Franklin.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Wanjek, Christopher|title=Bad Medicine: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Distance Healing to Vitamin O|publisher=Wiley|year=2002|pages=70–72|isbn=047143499X|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be argued that it is better to compare life expectancy of the period after childhood to get a better handle on life span.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wanjek, Christopher|title=Bad Medicine: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed, from Distance Healing to Vitamin O|publisher=Wiley|year=2002|page=71|isbn=0-471-43499-X|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life expectancy can change dramatically after childhood, even in preindustrial times as is demonstrated by the Roman Life Expectancy table, which estimates life expectancy to be 25 years ''at birth'', but 53 years upon reaching age 25.&lt;ref&gt;Frier, "Demography", 789.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies like Plymouth Plantation; "Dead at Forty" and Life Expectancy by Age, 1850–2004 similarly show a dramatic increase in life expectancy once adulthood was reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713083310/http://www.plimoth.org/discover/myth/dead-at-40.php|title=Common Myths - "Dead at Forty"|date=July 13, 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005140.html|title=Life Expectancy by Age, 1850–2011|website=InfoPlease}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Magnetoencephalography''' ('''MEG''') is a [[functional neuroimaging]] technique for mapping brain activity by recording [[magnetic field]]s produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the [[human brain|brain]], using very sensitive [[magnetometer]]s. Arrays of [[SQUID]]s (superconducting quantum interference devices) are currently the most common magnetometer, while the [[SERF]] (spin exchange relaxation-free) magnetometer is being investigated for future machines.&lt;ref name="HämäläinenHari1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hämäläinen | first1 = Matti | last2 = Hari | first2 = Riitta | last3 = Ilmoniemi | first3 = Risto J. | last4 = Knuutila | first4 = Jukka | last5 = Lounasmaa | first5 = Olli V. | name-list-format = vanc | title = Magnetoencephalography—theory, instrumentation, and applications to noninvasive studies of the working human brain | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | year = 1993 | pages = 413–497 | issn = 0034-6861 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.65.413|url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/bitstream/123456789/18757/1/A1_h%c3%a4m%c3%a4l%c3%a4inen_matti_1993.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boto|first=Elena|last2=Holmes|first2=Niall|last3=Leggett|first3=James|last4=Roberts|first4=Gillian|last5=Shah|first5=Vishal|last6=Meyer|first6=Sofie S.|last7=Muñoz|first7=Leonardo Duque|last8=Mullinger|first8=Karen J.|last9=Tierney|first9=Tim M.|date=March 2018|title=Moving magnetoencephalography towards real-world applications with a wearable system|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature26147|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=555|issue=7698|pages=657–661|doi=10.1038/nature26147|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applications of MEG include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain processes, localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal, determining the function of various parts of the brain, and [[neurofeedback]].

== History ==
[[Image:MIT EarlyYEARS-261 croped.tif|thumbnail|250px|left|Dr. Cohen's shielded room at MIT, in which first MEG was measured with a SQUID]]
[[Image:MIT EarlyYears-233a.jpg|thumbnail|500px|left|First MEG measured with SQUID, in Dr. Cohen's room at MIT]]
MEG signals were first measured by University of Illinois physicist [[David Cohen (physicist)|David Cohen]] in 1968,&lt;ref name="cohen1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen D | title = Magnetoencephalography: evidence of magnetic fields produced by alpha-rhythm currents | journal = Science | volume = 161 | issue = 3843 | pages = 784–6 | date = August 1968 | pmid = 5663803 | doi = 10.1126/science.161.3843.784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; before the availability of the [[SQUID]], using a copper induction coil as the detector. To reduce the magnetic background noise, the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room. The coil detector was barely sensitive enough, resulting in poor, noisy MEG measurements that were difficult to use. Later, Cohen built a much better shielded room at MIT, and used one of the first SQUID detectors, just developed by [[James Edward Zimmerman|James E. Zimmerman]], a researcher at Ford Motor Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimmerman JE, Theine P, Harding JT |title=Design and operation of stable rf-biased superconducting point-contact quantum devices, etc|journal=Journal of Applied Physics|year= 1970|volume=41|issue=4|pages=1572–1580|doi=10.1063/1.1659074}}&lt;/ref&gt; to again measure MEG signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen D | title = Magnetoencephalography: detection of the brain's electrical activity with a superconducting magnetometer | journal = Science | volume = 175 | issue = 4022 | pages = 664–6 | date = February 1972 | pmid = 5009769 | doi = 10.1126/science.175.4022.664 | url = http://davidcohen.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/1972ScienceV175(SquidMEG).pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; This time the signals were almost as clear as those of [[Electroencephalography|EEG]]. This stimulated the interest of physicists who had been looking for uses of SQUIDs. Subsequent to this, various types of spontaneous and evoked MEGs began to be measured.


At first, a single SQUID detector was used to successively measure the magnetic field at a number of points around the subject's head. This was cumbersome, and, in the 1980s, MEG manufacturers began to arrange multiple sensors into arrays to cover a larger area of the head. Present-day MEG arrays are set in a helmet-shaped [[vacuum flask]] that typically contain 300 sensors, covering most of the head.  In this way, MEGs of a subject or patient can now be accumulated rapidly and efficiently.

Recent developments attempt to increase portability of MEG scanners by using [[SERF|spin exchange relaxation-free]] (SERF) magnetometers. SERF magnetometers are relatively small, as they do not require bulky cooling systems to operate. At the same time, they feature sensitivity equivalent to that of SQUIDs. In 2012, it was demonstrated that MEG could work with a chip-scale atomic magnetometer (CSAM, type of SERF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sander TH, Preusser J, Mhaskar R, Kitching J, Trahms L, Knappe S | title = Magnetoencephalography with a chip-scale atomic magnetometer | journal = Biomedical Optics Express | volume = 3 | issue = 5 | pages = 981–90 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22567591 | doi = 10.1364/BOE.3.000981 | url = http://www.opticsinfobase.org/boe/abstract.cfm?uri=boe-3-5-981 | publisher = OSA Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in 2017, researchers built a working prototype that uses SERF magnetometers installed into portable individually 3D-printed helmets &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

== The basis of the MEG signal ==
[[Neural synchronization|Synchronized neuronal currents]] induce weak magnetic fields. The brain's magnetic field, measuring at 10 [[femto]][[tesla (unit)|tesla]] (fT) for [[cerebral cortex|cortical]] activity and 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; fT for the human [[alpha rhythm]], is considerably smaller than the ambient magnetic noise in an urban environment, which is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; fT or 0.1 µT. The essential problem of biomagnetism is, thus, the weakness of the signal relative to the sensitivity of the detectors, and to the competing environmental noise.

[[Image:Magnetoencephalography.png|thumbnail|250px|right|Origin of the brain's magnetic field. The electric current also produces the EEG signal.]]The MEG (and EEG) signals derive from the net effect of ionic currents flowing in the [[dendrite]]s of neurons during [[synapse|synaptic]] transmission. In accordance with [[Maxwell's equations]], any electrical current will produce a magnetic field, and it is this field that is measured. The net currents can be thought of as [[dipole|current dipoles]]{{CN|date=March 2018}}, i.e. currents with a position, orientation, and magnitude, but no spatial extent{{dubious|reason=No such thing, currents are at least one-dimensional and run in a loop (Kirchoff's current law) or end at a charge sink (capacitor) which doesn't apply here.|date=March 2018}}.  According to the [[right-hand rule]], a current dipole gives rise to a magnetic field that points around the axis of its vector component.

To generate a signal that is detectable, approximately 50,000 active neurons are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Okada Y | year =  1983 | chapter = Neurogenesis of evoked magnetic fields | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7x3aBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA399 | veditors = Williamson SH, Romani GL, Kaufman L, Modena I | title = Biomagnetism: an Interdisciplinary Approach | location = New York | publisher = Plenum Press | pages = 399-408 | isbn = 978-1-4757-1785-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since current dipoles must have similar orientations to generate magnetic fields that reinforce each other, it is often the layer of [[pyramidal cell]]s, which are situated perpendicular to the cortical surface, that gives rise to measurable magnetic fields. Bundles of these neurons that are orientated tangentially to the scalp surface project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head, and these bundles are typically located in the [[sulcus (neuroanatomy)|sulci]]. Researchers are experimenting with various [[signal processing]] methods in the search for methods that detect deep brain (i.e., non-cortical) signal, but no clinically useful method is currently available.

It is worth noting that [[action potentials]] do not usually produce an observable field, mainly because the currents associated with action potentials flow in opposite directions and the magnetic fields cancel out. However, action fields have been measured from peripheral nerves.

== Magnetic shielding ==
Since the magnetic signals emitted by the brain are on the order of a few femtoteslas, shielding from external magnetic signals, including the [[Earth's magnetic field]], is necessary. Appropriate [[magnetic shielding]] can be obtained by constructing rooms made of [[aluminium]] and [[mu-metal]] for reducing high-frequency and low-frequency [[signal noise|noise]], respectively.
[[Image:MSR layered door.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|Entrance to MSR, showing the separate shielding layers]]

=== Magnetically shielded room (MSR) ===
A magnetically shielded room (MSR) model consists of three nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer plus a high-permeability [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] layer, similar in composition to molybdenum [[permalloy]]. The ferromagnetic layer is supplied as 1&amp;nbsp;mm sheets, while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact, and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each. Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips. Insulating washers are used in the screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated. This helps eliminate [[radio frequency]] radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure [[alternating current|AC]] [[eddy current]] shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1&amp;nbsp;Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Cohen D, Schläpfer U, Ahlfors S, Hämäläinen M, Halgren E | title = New Six-Layer Magnetically-Shielded Room for MEG | publisher = Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging, Massachusetts General Hospital | location = Charlestown, Massachusetts }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Active shielding system ===
Active systems are designed for three-dimensional noise cancellation. To implement an active system, low-noise fluxgate [[magnetometer]]s are mounted at the center of each surface and oriented orthogonally to it. This negatively feeds a [[direct current|DC]] amplifier through a low-pass network with a slow falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation. Built into the system are shaking and degaussing wires. Shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability, while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces.&lt;ref name="cohen1" /&gt; Moreover, noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise. Modern systems have a [[noise floor]] of around 2–3&amp;nbsp;fT/Hz&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; above 1&amp;nbsp;Hz.

== Source localization ==

=== The inverse problem ===
{{main|Inverse problem}}

The challenge posed by MEG is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head. Problems such as this, where model parameters (the location of the activity) have to be estimated from measured data (the SQUID signals) are referred to as ''inverse problems'' (in contrast to ''forward problems''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis | url = http://lib.tkk.fi/Diss/2006/isbn9512280914/ | vauthors = Tanzer IO | year = 2006 | title = Numerical Modeling in Electro- and Magnetoencephalography | degree = Ph.D. | publisher = Helsinki University of Technology | location = Finland }}&lt;/ref&gt; where the model parameters (e.g. source location) are known and the data (e.g. the field at a given distance) is to be estimated.) The primary difficulty is that the inverse problem does not have a unique solution (i.e., there are infinite possible "correct" answers), and the problem of defining the "best" solution is itself the subject of intensive research&lt;!--

--&gt;.&lt;ref name="HaukWakemanHenson"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hauk O, Wakeman DG, Henson R | title = Comparison of noise-normalized minimum norm estimates for MEG analysis using multiple resolution metrics | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 54 | issue = 3 | pages = 1966–74 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20884360 | pmc = 3018574 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.09.053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible solutions can be derived using models involving prior knowledge of brain activity.

The source models can be either over-determined or under-determined. An over-determined model may consist of a few point-like sources ("equivalent dipoles"), whose locations are then estimated from the data. Under-determined models may be used in cases where many different distributed areas are activated ("distributed source solutions"): there are infinitely many possible current distributions explaining the measurement results, but the most likely is selected. Localization algorithms make use of given source and head models to find a likely location for an underlying focal field generator.

One type of localization algorithm for overdetermined models operates by [[Expectation-maximization algorithm|expectation-maximization]]: the system is initialized with a first guess.  A loop is started, in which a forward model is used to simulate the magnetic field that would result from the current guess. The guess is adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the simulated field and the measured field.  This process is iterated until convergence.

Another common technique is [[beamforming]], wherein a theoretical model of the magnetic field produced by a given current dipole is used as a prior, along with second-order statistics of the data in the form of a [[covariance matrix]], to calculate a linear weighting of the sensor array (the beamformer) via the [[Backus–Gilbert method|Backus-Gilbert inverse]]. This is also known as a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer. When the beamformer is applied to the data, it produces an estimate of the power in a "virtual channel" at the source location.

The extent to which the constraint-free MEG inverse problem is ill-posed cannot be overemphasized. If one's goal is to estimate the current density within the human brain with say a 5mm resolution then it is well established that the vast majority of the information needed to perform a unique inversion must come not from the magnetic field measurement but rather from the constraints applied to the problem. Furthermore, even when a unique inversion is possible in the presence of such constraints said inversion can be unstable. These conclusions are easily deduced from published works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheltraw D, Coutsias E| journal=Journal of Applied Physics |volume=94|number=8|year=2003 | url = http://www.math.unm.edu/~vageli/papers/JApplPhys_94_5307.pdf  | doi = 10.1063/1.1611262 | title=Invertibility of current density from near-field electromagnetic data|pages=5307–5315}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magnetic source imaging ===
The source locations can be combined with [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) images to create magnetic source images (MSI).  The two sets of data are combined by measuring the location of a common set of [[Fiduciary marker|fiducial points]] marked during MRI with lipid markers and marked during MEG with electrified coils of wire that give off magnetic fields.  The locations of the fiducial points in each data set are then used to define a common coordinate system so that superimposing the functional MEG data onto the structural MRI data ("[[coregistration]]") is possible.

A criticism of the use of this technique in clinical practice is that it produces colored areas with definite boundaries superimposed upon an MRI scan: the untrained viewer may not realize that the colors do not represent a physiological certainty, because of the relatively low spatial resolution of MEG, but rather a probability cloud derived from statistical processes.  However, when the magnetic source image corroborates other data, it can be of clinical utility.

=== Dipole model source localization ===
A widely accepted source-modeling technique for MEG involves calculating a set of equivalent current dipoles (ECDs), which assumes the underlying neuronal sources to be focal. This dipole fitting procedure is non-linear and over-determined, since the number of unknown dipole parameters is smaller than the number of MEG measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huang MX, Dale AM, Song T, Halgren E, Harrington DL, Podgorny I, Canive JM, Lewis S, Lee RR | title = Vector-based spatial-temporal minimum L1-norm solution for MEG | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 31 | issue = 3 | pages = 1025–37 | date = July 2006 | pmid = 16542857 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2006.01.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Automated multiple dipole model algorithms such as [[multiple signal classification]] (MUSIC) and [[MSST Multiple Dipole|MSST]] (MultiStart Spatial and Temporal) modeling are applied to the analysis of MEG responses. The limitations of dipole models for characterizing neuronal responses are (1) difficulties in localizing extended sources with ECDs, (2) problems with accurately estimating the total number of dipoles in advance, and (3) dependency on dipole location, especially depth in the brain.

=== Distributed source models ===
Unlike multiple-dipole modeling, distributed source models divide the source space into a grid containing a large number of dipoles. The inverse problem is to obtain the dipole moments for the grid nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hämäläinen MS, Ilmoniemi RJ | title = Interpreting magnetic fields of the brain: minimum norm estimates | journal = Medical &amp; Biological Engineering &amp; Computing | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–42 | date = January 1994 | pmid = 8182960 | doi = 10.1007/BF02512476 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the number of unknown dipole moments is much greater than the number of MEG sensors, the inverse solution is highly underdetermined, so additional constraints are needed to reduce ambiguity of the solution. The primary advantage of this approach is that no prior specification of the source model is necessary. However, the resulting distributions may be difficult to interpret, because they only reflect a "blurred" (or even distorted) image of the true neuronal source distribution. The matter is complicated by the fact that spatial resolution depends strongly on several parameters such as brain area, depth, orientation, number of sensors etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Molins A, Stufflebeam SM, Brown EN, Hämäläinen MS | title = Quantification of the benefit from integrating MEG and EEG data in minimum l2-norm estimation | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 1069–77 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18602485 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.05.064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independent component analysis (ICA) ===
[[Independent component analysis]] (ICA) is another signal processing solution that separates different signals that are statistically independent in time. It is primarily used to remove artifacts such as blinking, eye muscle movement, facial muscle artifacts, cardiac artifacts, etc. from MEG and EEG signals that may be contaminated with outside noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jung TP, Makeig S, Westerfield M, Townsend J, Courchesne E, Sejnowski TJ | title = Removal of eye activity artifacts from visual event-related potentials in normal and clinical subjects | journal = Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 111 | issue = 10 | pages = 1745–58 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11018488 | doi = 10.1016/S1388-2457(00)00386-2 | url = ftp://ftp.cnl.salk.edu/pub/jung/CLINPH00.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ICA has poor resolution of highly correlated brain sources.

== Use in the field ==
In research, MEG's primary use is the measurement of time courses of activity. MEG can resolve events with a precision of 10 milliseconds or faster, while [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|functional MRI]] (fMRI), which depends on changes in blood flow, can at best resolve events with a precision of several hundred milliseconds.  MEG also accurately pinpoints sources in primary auditory, somatosensory, and motor areas. For creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks, MEG is most often combined with fMRI, as the methods complement each other. Neuronal (MEG) and [[hemodynamics|hemodynamic]] (fMRI) data do not necessarily agree, in spite of the tight relationship between local field potentials (LFP) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. MEG and BOLD signals may originate from the same source (though the BOLD signals are filtered through the hemodynamic response).

MEG is also being used to better localize responses in the brain. The openness of the MEG setup allows external auditory and visual stimuli to be easily introduced. Some movement by the subject is also possible as long as it does not jar the subject's head. The responses in the brain before, during, and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with EEG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cui R, Cunnington R, Beisteiner R, Deecke L | title = Effects of force-load on cortical activity preceding voluntary finger movement|journal=Neurology, Psychiatry and Brain Research|volume=18|issue=3|year=2012|pages=97–104|doi=10.1016/j.npbr.2012.03.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists are also taking advantage of MEG neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior. For example, a number of studies have been done comparing the MEG responses of patients with psychological troubles to control patients. There has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia, such as auditory gating deficits to human voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hirano Y, Hirano S, Maekawa T, Obayashi C, Oribe N, Monji A, Kasai K, Kanba S, Onitsuka T | title = Auditory gating deficit to human voices in schizophrenia: a MEG study | journal = Schizophrenia Research | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–7 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 19783406 | doi = 10.1016/j.schres.2009.09.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MEG is also being used to correlate standard psychological responses, such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ihara A, Wei Q, Matani A, Fujimaki N, Yagura H, Nogai T, Umehara H, Murata T | title = Language comprehension dependent on emotional context: a magnetoencephalography study | journal = Neuroscience Research | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 50–8 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22001763 | doi = 10.1016/j.neures.2011.09.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have reported successful classification of patients with [[multiple sclerosis]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[schizophrenia]], [[Sjögren's syndrome]], [[chronic alcoholism]], and [[facial pain]]. MEG can be used to distinguish these patients from healthy control subjects, suggesting a future role of MEG in diagnostics.&lt;!----&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18057502"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Georgopoulos AP, Karageorgiou E, Leuthold AC, Lewis SM, Lynch JK, Alonso AA, Aslam Z, Carpenter AF, Georgopoulos A, Hemmy LS, Koutlas IG, Langheim FJ, McCarten JR, McPherson SE, Pardo JV, Pardo PJ, Parry GJ, Rottunda SJ, Segal BM, Sponheim SR, Stanwyck JJ, Stephane M, Westermeyer JJ | title = Synchronous neural interactions assessed by magnetoencephalography: a functional biomarker for brain disorders | journal = Journal of Neural Engineering | volume = 4 | issue = 4 | pages = 349–55 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18057502 | doi = 10.1088/1741-2560/4/4/001 | url = http://stacks.iop.org/1741-2560/4/349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Montez2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montez T, Poil SS, Jones BF, Manshanden I, Verbunt JP, van Dijk BW, Brussaard AB, van Ooyen A, Stam CJ, Scheltens P, Linkenkaer-Hansen K | title = Altered temporal correlations in parietal alpha and prefrontal theta oscillations in early-stage Alzheimer disease | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 5 | pages = 1614–9 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19164579 | pmc = 2635782 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0811699106 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/106/5/1614.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Focal epilepsy ===
The clinical uses of MEG are in detecting and localizing pathological activity in patients with [[epilepsy]], and in localizing [[eloquent cortex]] for surgical planning in patients with [[brain tumor]]s or intractable epilepsy. The goal of epilepsy surgery is to remove the epileptogenic tissue while sparing healthy brain areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Luders HO| title = Epilepsy Surgery|publisher=New York Raven Press|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing the exact position of essential brain regions (such as the [[primary motor cortex]] and [[primary sensory cortex]], [[visual cortex]], and areas involved in speech production and comprehension) helps to avoid surgically induced neurological deficits. Direct cortical stimulation and somatosensory evoked potentials recorded on [[ECoG]] are considered the gold standard for localizing essential brain regions. These procedures can be performed either intraoperatively or from chronically indwelling subdural grid electrodes. Both are invasive.

Noninvasive MEG localizations of the central sulcus obtained from somatosensory evoked magnetic fields show strong agreement with these invasive recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sutherling WW, Crandall PH, Darcey TM, Becker DP, Levesque MF, Barth DS | title = The magnetic and electric fields agree with intracranial localizations of somatosensory cortex | journal = Neurology | volume = 38 | issue = 11 | pages = 1705–14 | date = November 1988 | pmid = 3185905 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.38.11.1705 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rowley HA, Roberts TP | title = Functional localization by magnetoencephalography | journal = Neuroimaging Clinics of North America | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 695–710 | date = November 1995 | pmid = 8564291 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallen CC, Hirschkoff EC, Buchanan DS | title = Magnetoencephalography and magnetic source imaging. Capabilities and limitations | journal = Neuroimaging Clinics of North America | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 227–49 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7640886 }}&lt;/ref&gt; MEG studies assist in clarification of the functional organization of primary somatosensory cortex and to delineate the spatial extent of hand somatosensory cortex by stimulation of the individual digits. This agreement between invasive localization of cortical tissue and MEG recordings shows the effectiveness of MEG analysis and indicates that MEG may substitute invasive procedures in the future.

=== Fetal ===
MEG has been used to study cognitive processes such as [[visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|audition]], and [[language processing]] in fetuses and newborns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheridan CJ, Matuz T, Draganova R, Eswaran H, Preissl H | title = Fetal Magnetoencephalography - Achievements and Challenges in the Study of Prenatal and Early Postnatal Brain Responses: A Review | journal = Infant and Child Development | volume = 19 | issue = 1 | pages = 80–93 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20209112 | pmc = 2830651 | doi = 10.1002/icd.657 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with related techniques==
MEG has been in development since the 1960s but has been greatly aided by recent advances in computing algorithms and hardware, and promises improved [[spatial resolution]] coupled with extremely high [[temporal resolution]] (better than 1 [[millisecond|ms]]). Since the MEG signal is a direct measure of neuronal activity, its temporal resolution is comparable with that of intracranial electrodes.

MEG complements other brain activity measurement techniques such as [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), [[positron emission tomography]] (PET), and [[fMRI]].  Its strengths consist in independence of head geometry compared to EEG (unless [[ferromagnetic]] [[implant (medicine)|implants]] are present), non-invasiveness, use of no ionizing radiation, as opposed to PET and high temporal resolution as opposed to fMRI.

=== Vs. EEG ===
Although EEG and MEG signals originate from the same neurophysiological processes, there are important differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cohen D, Cuffin BN | title = Demonstration of useful differences between magnetoencephalogram and electroencephalogram | journal = Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 38–51 | date = July 1983 | pmid = 6190632 | doi = 10.1016/0013-4694(83)90005-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Magnetic fields are less distorted than electric fields by the skull and scalp, which results in a better spatial resolution of the MEG. Whereas scalp EEG is sensitive to both tangential and radial components of a current source in a spherical volume conductor, MEG detects only its tangential components. Scalp EEG can, therefore, detect activity both in the sulci and at the top of the cortical gyri, whereas MEG is most sensitive to activity originating in sulci. EEG is, therefore, sensitive to activity in more brain areas, but activity that is visible in MEG can also be localized with more accuracy.

Scalp EEG is sensitive to extracellular volume currents produced by postsynaptic potentials. MEG detects intracellular currents associated primarily with these synaptic potentials because the field components generated by volume currents tend to cancel out in a spherical volume conductor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barth DS, Sutherling W, Beatty J | title = Intracellular currents of interictal penicillin spikes: evidence from neuromagnetic mapping | journal = Brain Research | volume = 368 | issue = 1 | pages = 36–48 | date = March 1986 | pmid = 3955364 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(86)91040-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decay of magnetic fields as a function of distance is more pronounced than for electric fields. Therefore, MEG is more sensitive to superficial cortical activity, which makes it useful for the study of neocortical epilepsy. Finally, MEG is reference-free, while scalp EEG relies on a reference that, when active, makes interpretation of the data difficult.

'''Marie-Josephte Corriveau''' (1733 at [[Saint-Vallier, Quebec]] – {{death date|1763|04|18|mf=y}} at [[Quebec City]]), better known as "'''la Corriveau'''", is a well-known figure in [[Quebec|Québécois]] folklore. She lived in [[New France]], and was sentenced to death by a British [[court martial]] for the murder of her second husband, was hanged for it and her body hanged in chains. Her story has become a legend in Quebec, and she is the subject of many books and plays.

== Early life ==
[[File:Gibbet of La Corriveau (NYPL) (cropped-2).jpg|thumb|upright|The [[gibbet]] in which Corriveau was exhibited after her execution, the "cage" of Corriveau|alt=gibbet]]

La Corriveau was born in 1733, most probably in January or February,&lt;ref group="Note" name="baptism"&gt;The record of the act of baptism, of May 14, 1733, indicates that she was about three months old.&lt;/ref&gt; and baptised on May 14, 1733, in the rural parish of [[Saint-Vallier, Quebec|Saint-Vallier]] in [[New France]] as "Marie-Josephte Corriveau". She was the only surviving offspring of Joseph Corriveau, a farmer, and Françoise Bolduc. Her ten brothers and sisters all died in childhood.&lt;ref name="Bonneau p44"&gt;{{harvnb|Bonneau|1988|p=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriages and deaths of spouses==
Corriveau married at the age of 16, on November 17, 1749, to Charles Bouchard, aged 23, also a farmer. Three children were born in this marriage: two daughters, Marie-Françoise (1752) and Marie-Angélique (1754), followed by a son, Charles (1757). Rumors (that only started after the death of her second husband) say that she murdered him, as there is no concrete record of his death. Charles Bouchard was buried on April 27, 1760, and she remarried fifteen months later, on July 20, 1761, to another farmer from Saint-Vallier, Louis Étienne Dodier. On the morning of January 27, 1763, he was found dead in his barn, with multiple head wounds. Despite an official recording of the cause of death being from kicks of horses' hooves, and a speedy burial, rumours and gossip of murder spread rapidly through the neighbourhood. Dodier was on bad terms with his father-in-law and with his wife.

==Arrest and trial==
At the time, New France had been conquered by the British in 1760 as part of the [[Seven Years' War]] and was under the administration of the British Army. On hearing the rumours, the local British military authorities (charged with keeping order) set up an inquiry into Dodier's death. The inquiry opened in [[Quebec City]] on March 29, 1763, at the [[Ursulines of Quebec]], charging Joseph Corriveau and his daughter Marie-Josephte, before a military tribunal made up of 12 English officers and presided over by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Roger Morris (British Army officer)|Roger Morris]]. The case ended, on 9 April, with Joseph Corriveau being sentenced to death, for culpable homicide of his son-in-law. Marie-Josephte was found to be an accomplice to murder, and sentenced to sixty [[whip|lashes]] and [[human branding|branded]] with the letter M on her hand. One of Joseph Corriveau's nieces, Isabelle Sylvain (who he employed as a servant), had testified but changed her story several times during the hearing; she was found guilty of [[perjury]] and given thirty lashes and branded with the letter P.

Condemned to hang, Joseph Corriveau then told his [[confessor]], that he was no more than an accomplice to his daughter, after she had killed Dodier. At a second trial, on 15 April, Marie-Josephte testified to having killed her husband with two blows of a hatchet during his sleep, because of his ill-treatment of her.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lacourcière|1968|pp=230–231}} {{cite web |url=http://www.ourroots.ca/f/page.aspx?id=3649018 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614161400/http://www.ourroots.ca/f/page.aspx?id=3649018 |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribunal found her guilty and sentenced her to hang, her body after to be "hanged in chains" (that is, put up for public display on a [[gibbet]]).

==Execution==
The place of execution was Quebec, on the Buttes-à-Nepveu, near the [[Plains of Abraham]], probably on 18 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lacourcière|1968|p=234}} {{cite web |url=http://www.ourroots.ca/f/page.aspx?id=3649022 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614162331/http://www.ourroots.ca/f/page.aspx?id=3649022 |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her body was then taken, as directed by the sentence, to be put in chains at [[Lévis|Pointe-Lévy]], at the crossroads of Lauzon and Bienville&lt;ref name="Lacourcière-1968-p239"&gt;{{harvnb|Lacourcière|1968|p=239}} {{cite web |url=http://www.ourroots.ca/f/page.aspx?id=3649027 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614163125/http://www.ourroots.ca/f/page.aspx?id=3649027 |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (today the Rue St-Joseph and the Boulevard de l'Entente).&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;These were all near an ancient religious site between the Saint-Joseph and Vaudreuil roads. There was a religious monument called the {{lang|fr|Monument de la Tempérance}} which remained in the middle of the nineteenth century, until 1885.&lt;/ref&gt; The body, in its iron gibbet, was exposed to the public view until May 25 at the earliest. Following the requests of those living nearby, an order from the military commander of the district of Quebec, [[James Murray (Quebec governor)|James Murray]], addressed to the captain of the militia of Pointe-Lévy, permitted its being taken down and buried.&lt;ref name="Lacourcière-1968-p239"/&gt;

In 1849, the "cage" was dug up from the cemetery of the church of St-Joseph-de-la-Pointe-Lévy when a pit was dug.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Some renown attached to the bones recovered in this dig. The writer [[Louis Fréchette]] wrote about this discovery at the age of ten.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, the cage was stolen from the church cellar, and acquired by the American impresario [[P. T. Barnum]] and put on display as a "macabre object".&lt;ref name="Frechette"&gt;{{citation|first=Louis|last=Fréchette|url=http://www.cssh.qc.ca/coll/genealogie-sylvestre/Corriveau.htm|chapter=Une Relique – La Corriveau|title=Almanach du Peuple|year=1913|pages=302–307|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that, it was put on display at [[The Boston Museum]]. The museum slip indicated its provenance with two words: "From Quebec".&lt;ref name="Frechette" /&gt;

Through the efforts of the La Société d'histoire de Lévis, the cage was acquired from the Boston Museum and is now, part of a permanent display at Musée de la civilisation, 85 Dalhousie Street Québec, G1K 8R2.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mcq.org/fr/communique-presse?id=321700&lt;/ref&gt;

== In legend ==
[[File:Cage de la Corriveau.jpg|thumb|right|La Corriveau, in her cage, attacking Father José (''José's Nightmare''), illustration by [[Henri Julien]] for an edition of ''Anciens Canadiens'' by [[Philippe-Joseph Aubert de Gaspé|Philippe Aubert de Gaspé]])|alt=Book illustration]]
The post-mortem exhibition of Corriveau's remains at a busy crossroads (a practice also in use under the French regime, and reserved in England for those found guilty of the most serious crimes);&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Peine de mort en France#Ancien R.C3.A9gime]]{{Better source|date=November 2015|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;See [[Gibbet]].&lt;/ref&gt; the repercussions in the trial; the rumour that her father would be convicted of murdering Dodier at his daughter's instigation; and the gossip which grew up around the circumstances of the death of her first husband all stirred up the popular imagination and became legends still told today in the [[oral tradition]] — increasing the number of murdered husbands to as many as seven and likening la Corriveau to a [[witch]].

The 1849 discovery of the iron cage buried in the cemetery of St-Joseph parish (now the Lauzon district) served to reawaken the legends and the fantastic stories, which were amplified and used by 19th-century writers. The first, in 1863, [[Philippe-Joseph Aubert de Gaspé|Philippe Aubert de Gaspé]] in ''Les Anciens Canadiens'', has a supernatural Corriveau hanging in the Pointe-Levy cage, terrorising one night a passer-by conducting a [[witches' Sabbath]] and [[Will-o'-the-wisp]] at the [[Île d'Orléans]].{{sfn|Aubert de Gaspé|1863|loc=Chapter 4}} [[James MacPherson Le Moine]] (''Maple Leaves'', 1863){{sfn|MacPherson Le Moine|1863}} and [[William Kirby (author)|William Kirby]], following in his footsteps (''[[The Golden Dog]]'', 1877{{sfn|Kirby|1877}}), made her a professional poisoner, a direct descendant of [[La Voisin]], famous for her purported role in The [[Affair of the Poisons]]. Writers and historians such as [[Louis Fréchette]] and [[Pierre-Georges Roy]] have tried to give Corriveau's history, but without completely separating the facts from the anachronistic fantasies added in legend and novels.&lt;ref name="DBC"&gt;{{harvnb|Lacourcière|1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The figure of Corriveau still inspires novels, songs and plays and is the subject of argument (was she guilty or not?). Oral tradition also perpetuated and has not stopped, and remains alive, as is evidenced by the numerous stories collected in the lands of many regions of Quebec.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Notably the 52 stories collected between 1952 and 1973 under the direction of Luc Lacourcière ({{harvnb|Lacourcière|1973|pp=252–253}} {{cite web |url=http://www.ourroots.ca/f/page.aspx?id=3650205 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614160933/http://www.ourroots.ca/f/page.aspx?id=3650205 |archivedate=2011-06-14 |df= }} and the 122 put together between 1975 and 1990 by the students of Nicole Guilbault ({{harvnb|Guilbault|1995|p=14}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Descartes believed inputs are passed on by the sensory organs to the [[Pineal gland|epiphysis]] in the brain and from there to the immaterial spirit.&lt;ref name="Descartes1641"&gt;Descartes, R. (1641) ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', in ''The Philosophical Writings of René Descartes'', trans. by J. Cottingham, R. Stoothoff and D.

The '''mind''' is a set of [[cognition|cognitive]] faculties including [[consciousness]], [[perception]], [[thought|thinking]], [[judgement]], [[language]] and [[memory]]. It is usually defined as the faculty of an entity's thoughts and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mind|title=mind – definition of mind in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds the power of imagination, recognition, and appreciation, and is responsible for processing feelings and emotions, resulting in attitudes and actions.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

There is a lengthy tradition in [[philosophy of mind|philosophy]], [[religion]], [[psychology]], and [[cognitive science]] about what constitutes a mind and what are its distinguishing properties.

One open question regarding the nature of the mind is the [[mind–body problem]], which investigates the relation of the mind to the physical [[brain]] and nervous system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Older viewpoints included [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and [[idealism]], which considered the mind somehow non-physical.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mindware|last=Clark|first=Andy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-982815-9|location=198 Madison Avenue, New York, 10016|pages=14, 254–256|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern views often center around [[physicalism]] and [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]], which hold that the mind is roughly identical with the brain or [[Reductionism|reducible]] to physical phenomena such as [[neuron|neuronal activity]]&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.J.C., "The Mind/Brain Identity Theory", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/mind-identity/]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=December 2016}}, though dualism and idealism continue to have many supporters. Another question concerns which types of [[being]]s are capable of having minds (New Scientist 8 September 2018 p10).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} For example, whether mind is exclusive to humans, possessed also by some or all [[animals]], by all [[life|living things]], whether it is a strictly definable characteristic at all, or whether mind can also be a property of some types of [[artificial intelligence|human-made machines]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Whatever its nature, it is generally agreed that mind is that which enables a being to have [[subjectivity|subjective]] [[awareness]] and [[intentionality]] towards their environment, to [[perceive]] and respond to [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] with some kind of [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]], and to have consciousness, including thinking and [[feeling]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The concept of mind is understood in many different ways by many different cultural and religious traditions. Some see mind as a property exclusive to humans whereas others ascribe properties of mind to non-living entities (e.g. [[panpsychism]] and [[animism]]), to animals and to [[deity|deities]]. Some of the earliest recorded speculations linked mind (sometimes described as identical with [[soul]] or [[spirit]]) to theories concerning both [[life after death]], and [[cosmology|cosmological]] and [[Nature (philosophy)|natural]] order, for example in the doctrines of [[Zoroaster]], [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], Plato, [[Aristotle]], and other ancient [[Greek philosophy|Greek]], [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] and, later, [[Islamic psychological thought|Islamic]] and medieval European philosophers.

Important philosophers of mind include [[Plato]], [[Patanjali]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Kant]], [[Hegel]], [[Schopenhauer]], [[John Searle|Searle]], [[Daniel Dennett|Dennett]], [[Jerry Fodor|Fodor]], [[Thomas Nagel|Nagel]], and [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2016/01/20-most-important-philosophers-of-mind-since-wwii.html | title=20 "Most Important" Philosophers of Mind since WWII}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists such as [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and [[William James|James]], and [[computer science|computer scientists]] such as [[Alan Turing|Turing]] and [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] developed influential theories about the nature of the mind. The possibility of nonbiological minds is explored in the field of [[artificial intelligence]], which works closely in relation with [[cybernetics]] and [[information theory]] to understand the ways in which information processing by nonbiological machines is comparable or different to mental phenomena in the human mind.{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The mind is also portrayed as the [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing&lt;ref name=Karunamuni2017&gt;{{cite journal |author= Karunamuni N, Weerasekera R. |title= Theoretical Foundations to Guide Mindfulness Meditation: A Path to Wisdom |journal= Current Psychology |date=Jun 2017 | doi= 10.1007/s12144-017-9631-7|url= http://mindrxiv.org/mfs63/ |type= Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal|author= Karunamuni N.D.|title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind|journal=SAGE Open|volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=215824401558386|date=May 2015 | url= http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf | doi=10.1177/2158244015583860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The original meaning of [[Old English]] ''[[:wikt:gemynd|gemynd]]'' was the faculty of [[memory]], not of thought in general.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Hence ''call to mind'', ''come to mind'', ''keep in mind'', ''to have mind of'', etc. The word retains this sense in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/mind|title=mind – definition of mind in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Old English]] had other words to express "mind", such as ''[[:wikt:hyge|hyge]]'' "mind, spirit".{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The meaning of "memory" is shared with [[Old Norse]], which has ''[[Muninn|munr]]''. The word is originally from a [[PIE]] verbal root ''{{PIE|*men-}}'', meaning "to think, remember", whence also Latin'' [[:wikt:mens#Latin|mens]]'' "mind", Sanskrit ''[[:wikt:मनस्|{{IAST|manas}}]]'' "mind" and Greek [[:wikt:μένος|μένος]] "mind, courage, anger".

The generalization of ''mind'' to include all mental faculties, thought, [[Volition (psychology)|volition]], feeling and memory, gradually develops over the 14th and 15th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mind|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The attributes that make up the mind are debated. Some psychologists argue that only the "higher" intellectual functions constitute mind, particularly reason and [[memory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Başar|first1=Erol|title=Brain body mind oscillations in scope of uncertainty principle|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1441961365|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NAbMHo-ux58C&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=Some+psychologists+argue+that+only+the+%22higher%22+intellectual+functions+constitute+mind,+particularly+reason+and+memory#v=onepage&amp;q=Some%20psychologists%20argue%20that%20only%20the%20%22higher%22%20intellectual%20functions%20constitute%20mind%2C%20particularly%20reason%20and%20memory&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this view the emotions — [[love]], [[hate]], [[fear]], and [[joy]] — are more ''primitive ''or subjective in nature and should be seen as different from the mind as such. Others argue that various rational and emotional states cannot be so separated, that they are of the same nature and origin, and should therefore be considered all part of it as mind.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In popular usage, ''mind ''is frequently synonymous with ''thought'': the private conversation with ourselves that we carry on "inside our heads."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Israel|first1=Richard|last2=North|first2=Vanda|title=Mind Chi Re-wire Your Brain in 8 Minutes a Day ; Strategies for Success in Business and Life|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester|isbn=978-1907321375|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VCP63CWtVqIC&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=mind+is+frequently+synonymous+with+thought:#v=onepage&amp;q=mind%20is%20frequently%20synonymous%20with%20thought%3A&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus we "make up our minds," "change our minds" or are "of two minds" about something. One of the key attributes of the mind in this sense is that it is a private sphere to which no one but the owner has access. No one else can "know our mind." They can only interpret what we consciously or unconsciously communicate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masters|first1=Frances|title=Harness your Amazingly Creative Mind|url=http://www.thefusionmodel.com/harness-amazingly-creative-mind/|website=www.thefusionmodel.com|accessdate=18 April 2015|date=2014-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental faculties==
{{See also|Nous|Reason|Modularity of mind|Mental process}}

Broadly speaking, mental faculties are the various functions of the mind, or things the mind can "do".

[[Thought]] is a mental act that allows humans to make sense of things in the world, and to represent and interpret them in ways that are significant, or which accord with their needs, attachments, goals, commitments, plans, ends, desires, etc. Thinking involves the [[symbol]]ic or [[semiotic]] mediation of [[idea]]s or data, as when we form [[concept]]s, engage in [[problem solving]], reasoning, and making [[choice|decisions]]. Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include [[deliberation]], [[cognition]], [[idea]]tion, [[discourse]] and [[imagination]].

Thinking is sometimes described as a "higher" [[cognitive]] function and the analysis of thinking processes is a part of [[cognitive psychology]]. It is also deeply connected with our capacity to make and use [[tools]]; to understand [[causality|cause and effect]]; to recognize patterns of significance; to comprehend and [[world disclosure|disclose]] unique contexts of experience or activity; and to respond to the world in a meaningful way.

[[Memory]] is the ability to preserve, retain, and subsequently recall, knowledge, information or experience. Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in [[philosophy]], the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of [[cognitive psychology]]. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called [[cognitive neuroscience]], a marriage between cognitive psychology and [[neuroscience]].

[[Imagination]] is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations, [[image]]s, ideas or other [[qualia]] in the mind. It is a characteristically [[Subjectivity|subjective]] ''activity'', rather than a direct or passive experience. The term is technically used in [[psychology]] for the process of reviving in the mind [[perception|percepts]] of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [[language]], some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as "[[wikt:Imaging|imaging]]" or "[[wikt:Imagery|imagery]]" or to speak of it as "reproductive" as opposed to "productive" or "constructive" imagination. Things imagined are said to be seen in the "[[mind's eye]]". Among the many practical functions of imagination are the ability to project possible futures (or histories), to "see" things from another's perspective, and to change the way something is perceived, including to make decisions to respond to, or enact, what is imagined.

[[Consciousness]] in mammals (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide consciousness into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.&lt;ref name="Bl"&gt;Ned Block: "On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness" in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.

==Mental content==
Mental contents are those items that are thought of as being "in" the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties. Examples include [[thought]]s, [[concept]]s, [[memories]], [[emotion]]s, [[percept]]s and [[intention]]s. Philosophical theories of mental content include [[internalism]], [[externalism]], [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]] and [[intentionality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-narrow/ | title=Narrow Mental Content | publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memetics===
[[Memetics]] is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]], which was originated by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in the 1980s. It is an [[evolutionary model]] of cultural [[information transfer]]. A [[meme]], analogous to a [[gene]], is an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour (etc.) "hosted" in one or more individual minds, and can reproduce itself from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief, is seen memetically as a meme reproducing itself.

==Relation to the brain==
{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience}}

In animals, the [[brain]], or ''encephalon'' ([[Greek (language)|Greek]] for "in the head"), is the control center of the [[central nervous system]], responsible for [[thought]]. In most animals, the brain is located in the head, protected by the [[skull]] and close to the primary sensory apparatus of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[equilibrioception]], [[taste]] and [[olfaction]]. While all [[vertebrate]]s have a brain, most [[invertebrate]]s have either a centralized brain or collections of individual [[ganglion|ganglia]]. Primitive animals such as [[sponge]]s do not have a brain at all. Brains can be extremely complex. For example, the [[human brain]] contains around 86 billion [[neuron]]s, each linked to as many as 10,000 others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Whishaw|first=Bryan Kolb, Ian Q.|title=An Introduction to Brain and Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7167-7691-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIBEEP2b1MIC|edition=3rd |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sherwood|first=Lauralee|title=Fundamentals of Human Physiology|year=2011|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-8400-6225-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jl4rLDuewo4C|edition=4th |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Understanding the relationship between the brain and the mind&amp;nbsp;– [[mind–body problem]] is one of the central issues in the history of [[philosophy]]&amp;nbsp;– is a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Smith Churchland, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hAeFMFW3rDUC ''Neurophilosophy: toward a unified science of the mind-brain''], MIT Press, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the answer: dualism, materialism, and idealism. [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] holds that the mind exists independently of the brain;&lt;ref&gt;Hart, W.D. (1997): [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFtVBGAn5-YC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;dq=dualism+%22The+mind-body+problem+is+the+question+how+the+mind+is+attached+to+the+body%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VKuFTtvlNYSN4gTVrf20Dw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dualism%20%22The%20mind-body%20problem%20is%20the%20question%20how%20the%20mind%20is%20attached%20to%20the%20body%22&amp;f=false ‘Dualism’, pp. 265–267] in S. Guttenplan (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id=GFtVBGAn5-YC ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind''], Blackwell&lt;/ref&gt; [[materialism]] holds that mental phenomena are identical to neuronal phenomena;&lt;ref name="DicPhil"&gt;A.R. Lacey, ''A Dictionary of Philosophy'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; and [[idealism (philosophy)|idealism]] holds that only mental phenomena exist.&lt;ref name="DicPhil"/&gt;

Through most of history many philosophers found it inconceivable that cognition could be implemented by a physical substance such as brain tissue (that is neurons and synapses).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Descartes]], who thought extensively about mind-brain relationships, found it possible to explain reflexes and other simple behaviors in [[The Description of the Human Body|mechanistic terms]], although he did not believe that complex thought, and language in particular, could be explained by reference to the physical brain alone.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDescartes|Descartes, ''Description of the human body'']]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most straightforward scientific evidence of a strong relationship between the physical brain [[matter]] and the mind is the impact physical alterations to the brain have on the mind, such as with [[traumatic brain injury]] and [[psychoactive drug]] use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBoake|Boake and Diller, 2005]]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Patricia Churchland]] notes that this drug-mind interaction indicates an intimate connection between the brain and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChurchland|''Neurophilosophy'']], Ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the philosophical questions, the relationship between mind and brain involves a number of scientific questions, including understanding the relationship between mental activity and brain activity, the exact mechanisms by which drugs influence [[cognition]], and the [[neural correlates of consciousness]].

Theoretical approaches to explain how mind emerges from the brain include [[connectionism]], [[computationalism]] and [[Bayesian brain]].

The [[evolution of human intelligence]] refers to several theories that aim to describe how human [[intelligence]] has [[evolution|evolved]] in relation to the evolution of the [[human brain]] and the [[origin of language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harnad, S.R., Steklis, H.D., &amp; Lancaster, J.E.|title=Origins and evolution of language and speech|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume=280|issue=1|pages=1–2|date=1976|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb25462.x|bibcode=1976NYASA.280....1H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The timeline of [[human evolution]] spans some 7 million years, from the separation of the genus ''[[Chimpanzee|Pan]]'' until the emergence of [[behavioral modernity]] by 50,000 years ago. Of this timeline, the first 3 million years concern ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis|Sahelanthropus]]'', the following 2 million concern ''[[Australopithecus]]'', while the final 2 million span the history of actual ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'' species (the [[Paleolithic]]).

Many traits of human intelligence, such as [[empathy]], [[theory of mind]], [[mourning]], [[ritual]], and the use of [[Great ape language|symbols]] and [[tool]]s, are already apparent in [[great ape]]s although in lesser sophistication than in humans.

There is a debate between supporters of the idea of a sudden emergence of intelligence, or "[[Behavioural modernity#Great leap forward|Great leap forward]]" and those of a gradual or [[Behavioural modernity#Continuum hypothesis|continuum hypothesis]].

Theories of the evolution of intelligence include:
* [[Robin Dunbar]]'s social brain hypothesis&lt;ref name="The Social Brain Hypothesis"&gt;[http://www.liv.ac.uk/evolpsyc/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdfThe Social Brain Hypothesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713121559/http://www.liv.ac.uk/evolpsyc/Evol_Anthrop_6.pdfThe |date=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Geoffrey Miller]]'s [[sexual selection]] hypothesis concerning [[Sexual selection in human evolution]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|authorlink=Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|title=The Mating Mind|isbn=978-0-8058-5749-8|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ecological dominance-social competition (EDSC)&lt;ref name=flinn&gt;{{cite web| url=http://web.missouri.edu/~gearyd/Flinnetal2005.pdf|title=Flinn, M.V., Geary, D.C., &amp; Ward, C.V. (2005).

Geary and Carol V. Ward based mainly on work by [[Richard D. Alexander]].
* The idea of intelligence as a signal of good health and resistance to disease.
* The [[Group selection]] theory contends that organism characteristics that provide benefits to a group (clan, tribe, or larger population) can evolve despite individual disadvantages such as those cited above.
* The idea that intelligence is connected with nutrition, and thereby with status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306987704000416 |title= Enhanced nutrition of offspring as a crucial factor for the evolution of intelligence on land |website= |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A higher IQ could be a signal that an individual comes from and lives in a physical and social environment where nutrition levels are high, and vice versa.

==Philosophy of mind==
{{Main|Philosophy of mind}}

Philosophy of mind is the branch of [[philosophy]] that studies the nature of the mind, [[mental event]]s, [[mental function]]s, [[mental property|mental properties]], [[consciousness]] and their relationship to the physical body. The ''[[mind–body problem]]'', i.e. the relationship of the mind to the body, is commonly seen as the central issue in philosophy of mind, although there are other issues concerning the nature of the mind that do not involve its relation to the physical body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kim | first = J. | editor = Honderich, Ted | title = Problems in the Philosophy of Mind.

''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.) Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1998.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado]] writes, "In present popular usage, soul and mind are not clearly differentiated and some people, more or less consciously, still feel that the soul, and perhaps the mind, may enter or leave the body as independent entities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=James M.R. Delgado | title= Physical control of the mind; towards a psycho civilized society | page=25 | year=1969 | publisher=Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside Limited | location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]]'' and ''[[monism]]'' are the two major schools of thought that attempt to resolve the mind–body problem. Dualism is the position that mind and body are in some way separate from each other. It can be traced back to [[Plato]],&lt;ref name="Plato"&gt;{{cite book  | author = Plato |editor1=E.A.

(1996) "Dualism", in Samuel Guttenplan (org) ''A Companion to the Philosophy of Mind'', Blackwell, Oxford, 265–267.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century philosopher Martin Heidegger suggested that subjective experience and activity (i.e. the "mind") cannot be made sense of in terms of [[Descartes|Cartesian]] "substances" that bear "properties" at all (whether the mind itself is thought of as a distinct, separate kind of substance or not). This is because the nature of subjective, ''qualitative'' experience is incoherent in terms of&amp;nbsp;– or semantically [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurable]] with the concept of&amp;nbsp;– substances that bear properties. This is a fundamentally [[ontology|ontological]] argument.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Dreyfus, "Critique of Descartes I" (recorded lecture), University of California at Berkeley, September 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher of [[cognitive science]] [[Daniel Dennett]], for example, argues there is no such thing as a narrative center called the "mind", but that instead there is simply a collection of sensory inputs and outputs: different kinds of "software" running in parallel.&lt;ref name=Dennett1991&gt;{{cite book |author=Dennett, Daniel |title=Consciousness Explained |year=1991 |publisher=Little Brown |location=Boston, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-316-18065-8|title-link=Consciousness Explained }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--find page # or page range for this citation--&gt; Psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]] argued that the mind is an explanatory fiction that diverts attention from environmental causes of behavior;&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. About Behaviorism 1974, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt; he considered the mind a "black box" and thought that mental processes may be better conceived of as forms of covert verbal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. ''About Behaviorism'', Chapter 7: Thinking&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A thesis against which [[Noam Chomsky#Contributions to psychology|Noam Chomsky]] advanced a considerable polemic.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[David Chalmers]] has argued that the third person approach to uncovering mind and consciousness is not effective, such as looking into other's brains or observing human conduct, but that a first person approach is necessary.   Such a first person perspective indicates that the mind must be conceptualized as something distinct from the brain.

The mind has also been described as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream, where sense impressions and mental phenomena are constantly changing.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

===Mind/body perspectives===
''Monism'' is the position that mind and body are not [[physiology|physiologically]] and ontologically distinct kinds of entities. This view was first advocated in [[Western Philosophy]] by [[Parmenides]] in the 5th Century BC and was later espoused by the 17th Century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref name="Spin"&gt;Spinoza, Baruch (1670) ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'' (A Theologico-Political Treatise).&lt;/ref&gt; According to Spinoza's [[dual-aspect theory]], mind and body are two aspects of an underlying reality which he variously described as "Nature" or "God".
* ''[[Physicalism|Physicalists]]'' argue that only the entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that the mind will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve.
* ''[[idealism (philosophy)|Idealists]]'' maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind.
* ''[[neutral monism|Neutral monists]]'' adhere to the position that perceived things in the world can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.

The most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].&lt;ref name="Kim"&gt;Kim, J., "Mind-Body Problem", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''. Ted Honderich (ed.). Oxford:Oxford University Press. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern philosophers of mind adopt either a ''reductive'' or ''non-reductive physicalist'' position, maintaining in their different ways that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim" /&gt; These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, e.g. in the fields of [[sociobiology]], [[computer science]], [[evolutionary psychology]] and the various [[neuroscience]]s.&lt;ref name="PsyBio"&gt;Pinel, J. ''Psychobiology'', (1990) Prentice Hall, Inc. {{ISBN|88-15-07174-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeDoux"&gt;LeDoux, J.

''The Selfish Gene'' (1976) Oxford:Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!----Well, you get f** idea. There are billions of refs for this---&gt; Other philosophers, however, adopt a non-physicalist position which challenges the notion that the mind is a purely physical construct.&lt;!--eg, Chalmers ref and whatever else you like----&gt;
* ''Reductive physicalists'' assert that all mental states and properties will eventually be explained by scientific accounts of physiological processes and states.&lt;ref name="Pat"&gt;{{cite book | author=Churchland, Patricia | title=Neurophilosophy: Toward a Unified Science of the Mind-Brain | publisher=MIT Press | year=1986 | isbn=978-0-262-03116-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Churchland, Paul | title=Eliminative Materialism and the Propositional Attitudes | journal=[[Journal of Philosophy]] | year=1981 | pages=67–90 | volume = 78 | doi = 10.2307/2025900 | issue=2 | jstor=2025900}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smart"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Smart, J.J.C. | title=Sensations and Brain Processes | journal=Philosophical Review | year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Non-reductive physicalists'' argue that although the brain is all there ''is'' to the mind, the predicates and vocabulary used in mental descriptions and explanations are indispensable, and cannot be reduced to the language and lower-level explanations of physical science.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite book | author=Donald Davidson | title=Essays on Actions and Events | publisher=Oxford University Press | year=1980 | isbn=978-0-19-924627-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pu"&gt;Putnam, Hilary (1967). "Psychological Predicates", in W.H. Capitan and D.D. Merrill, eds., ''Art, Mind and Religion'' Pittsburgh: [[University of Pittsburgh Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued progress in [[neuroscience]] has helped to clarify many of these issues, and its findings have been taken by many to support [[Physicalism|physicalists]]' assertions.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farah|first=Martha J.|author2=Murphy, Nancey|title=Neuroscience and the Soul|journal=Science|date=February 2009|volume=323|issue=5918|page=1168|doi=10.1126/science.323.5918.1168a|pmid=19251609|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/323/5918/1168.1.full|accessdate=20 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koch"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=Christof|title=Do Not Underestimate Science|journal=Science|date=July 2009|volume=325|issue=5939|page=392|doi=10.1126/science.325_392b|pmid=19628839|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/325/5939/392.2.full|accessdate=14 November 2012|bibcode=2009Sci...325..392K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, our knowledge is incomplete, and modern philosophers of mind continue to discuss how subjective [[qualia]] and the [[intentional stance|intentional]] mental states can be [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturally]] explained.&lt;ref name="Int"&gt;{{cite book | author=Dennett, Daniel | title=The intentional stance | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Mass. |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-262-54053-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Searleint"&gt;{{cite book | author=Searle, John | title=Intentionality.

===Neuroscience===
{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience|Thought identification}}

[[Neuroscience]] studies the [[nervous system]], the physical basis of the mind. At the systems level, neuroscientists investigate how [[biological neural networks]] form and physiologically interact to produce mental functions and content such as [[reflex]]es, [[multisensory integration]], [[motor coordination]], [[circadian rhythm]]s, [[emotion|emotional responses]], [[learning]], and [[memory]]. At a larger scale, efforts in [[computational neuroscience]] have developed large-scale models that simulate simple, functioning brains.&lt;ref name="Spaun"/&gt; As of 2012, such models include the [[thalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[prefrontal cortex]], [[motor cortex]], and [[occipital cortex]], and consequentially simulated brains can learn, respond to visual stimuli, coordinate motor responses, form short-term memories, and learn to respond to patterns. Currently, researchers aim to program the [[hippocampus]] and [[limbic system]], hypothetically imbuing the simulated mind with [[long-term memory]] and crude [[emotion]]s.&lt;ref name="CNRG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Computational Neuroscience Research Group|url=http://ctnsrv.uwaterloo.ca/cnrglab/|publisher=Waterloo Centre for Theoretical Neuroscience|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, [[affective neuroscience]] studies the neural mechanisms of [[personality psychology|personality]], [[emotion]], and [[mood (psychology)|mood]] primarily through experimental tasks.

===Cognitive Science===
{{See also|Cognitive Science}}
{{expand section|date=May 2013}}

[[Cognitive science]] examines the mental functions that give rise to [[information processing]], termed [[cognition]]. These include [[perception]], [[attention]], [[working memory]], [[long-term memory]], producing and understanding [[language]], [[learning]], [[reason]]ing, [[problem solving]], and [[decision making]]. Cognitive science seeks to understand thinking "in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures".&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;Thagard, Paul, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychology===
{{See also|Neuropsychology|Psyche (psychology)|label 2=Psyche|Unconscious mind}}

[[Psychology]] is the scientific study of human behavior, mental functioning, and experience. As both an [[academic]] and [[applied science|applied]] discipline, Psychology involves the [[science|scientific study]] of [[mental process]]es such as [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[emotion]], [[Personality psychology|personality]], as well as environmental influences, such as social and cultural influences, and [[interpersonal relationships]], in order to devise theories of human behavior. Psychological patterns can be understood as low cost ways of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychology also refers to the application of such [[knowledge]] to various spheres of [[Human behavior|human activity]], including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental health]] problems.

Psychology differs from the other [[social sciences]] (e.g. [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]]) due to its focus on [[experimentation]] at the scale of the individual, or individuals in small groups as opposed to [[group (sociology)|large groups]], [[institutions]] or [[societies]]. Historically, psychology differed from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain. Modern psychological science incorporates [[Psychophysiology|physiological]] and [[neuropsychology|neurological]] processes into its conceptions of [[perception]], [[cognition]], behaviour, and [[mental disorders]].

==Mental health==
{{Main|Mental health}}

By analogy with the health of the body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or [[mental health]]. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines mental health as "A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life." According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), there is no one "official" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how "mental health" is defined. In general, most experts agree that "mental health" and "[[mental disorder]]" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an independent life; and being able to "bounce back," or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.

[[Psychotherapy]] is an [[interpersonal]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid [[wikt:Client|clients]] in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual sense of [[well-being]] and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, [[dialogue]], [[communication]] and [[behavior]] change and that are designed to improve the [[mental health]] of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a [[family]]). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken [[conversation]], though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, [[art]], [[drama]], [[narrative]] story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained [[therapist]] and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with [[psychoanalysis]]; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.

==Non-human minds==

===Animal intelligence===
[[Animal cognition]], or cognitive ethology, is the title given to a modern approach to the mental capacities of animals. It has developed out of [[comparative psychology]], but has also been strongly influenced by the approach of [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Much of what used to be considered under the title of "animal intelligence" is now thought of under this heading. [[Animal language acquisition]], attempting to discern or understand the degree to which animal cognition can be revealed by [[linguistics]]-related study, has been controversial among [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists]].

===Artificial intelligence===
{{refimprove section|date=September 2007}}
{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence}}

[[File:Forest of synthetic pyramidal dendrites grown using Cajal's laws of neuronal branching.png|thumb|[[Computer simulation]] of the branching architecture of the [[dendrite]]s of [[pyramidal neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/image.pcbi.v06.i08 | title = PLoS Computational Biology Issue Image &amp;#124; Vol. 6(8) August 2010 | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = ev06.ei08 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;]] In 1950 [[Alan M. Turing]] published "Computing machinery and intelligence" in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', in which he proposed that machines could be tested for intelligence using questions and answers. This process is now named the [[Turing Test]]. The term [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) was first used by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] who considered it to mean "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".&lt;ref&gt;What is Artificial Intelligence? by John McCarthy [http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html Stanford University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118212402/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html |date=2015-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also refer to [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] as exhibited by an artificial (''man-made'', ''non-natural'', ''manufactured'') entity. AI is studied in overlapping fields of [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[engineering]], dealing with intelligent [[behavior]], [[learn]]ing and [[adaptation]] and usually developed using customized [[machine]]s or [[computer]]s.

Research in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include [[control system|control]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning and scheduling]], the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]], [[natural language]], [[speech recognition|speech]] and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]]. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, [[knowledge mining]], [[software]] applications, [[strategy games]] like [[computer chess]] and other [[video game]]s. One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension. Consequentially [[natural language understanding]] and [[connectionism]] (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.

The debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of [[artificial intelligence]]. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.

==In religion==
Many religions associate spiritual qualities to the human mind. These are often tightly connected to their [[mythology]] and ideas of [[afterlife]].

The [[India]]n [[philosopher]]-sage [[Sri Aurobindo]] attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his [[integral psychology (Sri Aurobindo)|integral psychology]], as have many philosophers and [[New religious movement]]s. [[Judaism]] teaches that "moach shalit al halev", the mind rules the heart. Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. [[Christianity]] has tended to see the mind as distinct from the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''[[nous]]'') and sometimes further distinguished from the [[spirit]]. [[Esotericism|Western esoteric traditions]] sometimes refer to a [[mental body]] that exists on a plane other than the physical. [[Hinduism]]'s various philosophical schools have debated whether the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Sanskrit ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') is distinct from, or identical to, ''[[Brahman]]'', the [[divinity|divine]] [[reality]]. [[Taoism]] sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the [[Human body|body]]. [[Confucianism]] sees the mind, like the body, as inherently perfectible.

===Buddhism===
{{See also|Buddhism and psychology|Vijñāna|Śūnyatā|Shentong|Rangtong|Yogacara}}

Buddhist teachings explain the moment-to-moment manifestation of the mind-stream.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt; The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.

According to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosopher [[Dharmakirti]], the mind has two fundamental qualities: "clarity and cognizes". If something is not those two qualities, it cannot validly be called mind. "Clarity" refers to the fact that mind has no color, shape, size, location, weight, or any other physical characteristic, and "cognizes" that it functions to know or perceive objects.&lt;ref&gt;Gyatso, [[Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]], ''Understanding the Mind'': The Nature and Power of the Mind, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-78-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Knowing" refers to the fact that mind is aware of the contents of experience, and that, in order to exist, mind must be cognizing an object. You cannot have a mind – whose function is to cognize an object – existing without cognizing an object.

Mind, in Buddhism, is also described as being "space-like" and "illusion-like". Mind is space-like in the sense that it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, mind is illusion-like in the sense that it is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the mind is itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being "space and illusion" and being "space-like" and "illusion-like". Mind is not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. Mind is not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.

Buddhism posits that there is no inherent, unchanging identity (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra. Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is – by itself or themselves – the person. Similarly, within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves "the person". A human being merely consists of five aggregates, or ''[[skandha]]s'' and nothing else.

In the same way, "mind" is what can be validly conceptually labelled onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing. There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is "Awareness", in Buddhism. "Mind" is that part of experience the sixth sense door, which can be validly referred to as mind by the concept-term "mind". There is also not "objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between". There is a third thing called "awareness" which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be a third thing called "awareness" and a third thing called "experiencer who is aware of the experience". This awareness is deeply related to "no-self" because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.

Clearly, the experience arises and is known by mind, but there is a third thing calls [[Sati (Buddhism)|Sati]] what is the "real experiencer of the experience" that sits apart from the experience and which can be aware of the experience in 4 levels. (Maha Sathipatthana Sutta.)
# Body
# Sensations (Changes of the body mind.)
# Mind,
# Contents of the mind. (Changes of the body mind.)

To be aware of these four levels one needs to cultivate equanimity toward Craving and Aversion. This is Called Vipassana which is different from the way of reacting with  Craving and Aversion. This is the state of being aware and equanimous to the complete experience of here and now. This is the way of Buddhism, with regards to mind and the ultimate nature of minds (and persons).

===Mortality of the mind===
{{Main|Consciousness after death}}
Due to the [[mind–body problem]], a lot of interest and debate surrounds the question of what happens to one's conscious mind as one's body dies. During [[brain death]] all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases, according to the current neuroscientific view which sees these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena, the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist. This permanent loss of consciousness after death is often called "[[eternal oblivion]]". The belief that some [[spirit]]ual or [[incorporeal]] component ([[soul]]) exists and that it is preserved after death is described by the term "[[afterlife]]".

==In pseudoscience==
===Parapsychology===
[[Parapsychology]] is a study of certain types of [[paranormal phenomena]], or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal but it does not have any scientific basis &lt;ref&gt;[http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824232035/http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html |date=2010-08-24 }}, Retrieved February 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; for instance [[precognition]], [[telekinesis]] and [[telepathy]].

The term is based on the Greek [[:wikt:para-|para]] (beside/beyond), [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] (soul/mind), and [[logos]] (account/explanation) and was coined by psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in or before 1889.&lt;ref name = "EncyOccult"/&gt; [[J.B.

'''Misael Tamayo Hernández''' (2 March 1952 – 10 November 2006) was a Mexican journalist, editorial director, and founder of ''El Despertar de la Costa'', a family-run newspaper from the state of [[Guerrero]].

As a journalist, he was a harsh critic of local corruption, drug trafficking, and the Mexican drug cartels. On 10 November 2006, Tamayo Hernández was abducted and found dead inside a motel room in Guerrero, presumably killed by a [[lethal injection]]; the crime is yet to be solved, but there are signs that his death was work-related.

==Early life and career==
Tamayo Hernández was born in the [[Tierra Caliente (Mexico)|Tierra Caliente]] region in [[Tlalchapa]], [[Guerrero]] on 2 March 1952.&lt;ref name=michoacan/&gt;&lt;ref name=familia&gt;{{cite news |title=La despedida de Fox: Ejecutan a director de diario en Guerrero |url=http://www.enlineadirecta.info/nota.php?art_ID=10007&amp;titulo=La_despedida_de_Fox__Ejecutan_a_director_de_diario_en_Guerrero.html |accessdate=13 January 2013 |newspaper=EnLineaDirecta |date=11 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DdHUGHti?url=http://www.enlineadirecta.info/nota.php?art_ID=10007&amp;titulo=La_despedida_de_Fox__Ejecutan_a_director_de_diario_en_Guerrero.html |archivedate=13 January 2013 |deadurl=no |language=Spanish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before going into journalism, he worked at a credit bank for the government at his locality and as a rancher. He had some experience in politics by joining the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI), but he gave it up and followed his dream to pursue a career in journalism and create his own newspaper in 2001.&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt;

Tamayo Hernández was the editorial director and owner of ''El Despertar de la Costa'' ("The Awakening of the Coast"), a newspaper that circulates around the [[Costa Grande of Guerrero|Costa Grande region]] in the state of Guerrero and is based in the city of [[Zihuatanejo]], right on the coast of the Pacific Ocean. His newspaper was also run by his two sisters, Ruth and Rebecca Tamayo Hernández, who, along with Misael, took a critical stance of the local corruption and organized crime.&lt;ref name=costagrande&gt;{{cite news|title=Recomendación de CNDH al estado por el asesinato del periodista Misael Tamayo|url=http://www.lajornadaguerrero.com.mx/2007/12/31/index.php?section=sociedad&amp;article=007n1soc|accessdate=11 January 2013|newspaper=[[La Jornada]]|date=31 December 2007|agency=Editorial EVE, S.A. de C.V.|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331054646/http://www.lajornadaguerrero.com.mx/2007/12/31/index.php?section=sociedad&amp;article=007n1soc|archivedate=31 March 2012|deadurl=no|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editor of a provincial paper found dead |url=http://cpj.org/2006/11/editor-of-a-provincial-paper-found-dead.php |publisher=[[Committee to Protect Journalists]] |accessdate=12 January 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DbTHOBrI?url=http://cpj.org/2006/11/editor-of-a-provincial-paper-found-dead.php |archivedate=12 January 2013 |deadurl=no |location=New York City |date=13 November 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SIP condena la muerte del periodista Misael Tamayo |url=http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=271217 |accessdate=26 December 2016 |newspaper=[[La Crónica de Hoy]] |date=14 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112003642/http://www.cronica.com.mx/nota.php?id_nota=271217 |archivedate=12 January 2013 |deadurl=no |language=Spanish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote extensively on the drug cartel turf wars in Zihuatanejo and [[Acapulco]], areas known for their lucrative smuggling routes for narcotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tobar |first=Hector |title=Toll mounts in Mexico's drug war |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/14/world/fg-mexdrug14 |accessdate=12 January 2013 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=14 November 2006 |agency=Times Staff Writers |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DbfjtNt7?url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/14/world/fg-mexdrug14 |archivedate=12 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beaubein |first=Jason |title=Violence Continues As Drug Wars Rage In Mexico |url=https://www.npr.org/2009/03/23/102188685/violence-continues-as-drug-wars-rage-in-mexico |accessdate=12 January 2013 |newspaper=[[NPR]] |date=23 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dbfunaqe?url=http://www.npr.org/2009/03/23/102188685/violence-continues-as-drug-wars-rage-in-mexico |archivedate=12 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lynne Walker |first=S. |title=Acapulco's loss of innocence |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060215/news_1n15acapulco.html |accessdate=12 January 2013 |newspaper=[[U-T San Diego]] |date=15 February 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dbg2bn1A?url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060215/news_1n15acapulco.html |archivedate=12 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamayo Hernández (aged 53) was eventually found dead at 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 10 November 2006 by a security guard inside a motel room in the outskirts of [[Zihuatanejo, Guerrero]]. Both of his hands were tied behind his back with a belt, and three small perforations on both of his arms indicated that he was killed with a [[lethal injection]].

He reportedly received several death threats while being alive, but never took them seriously.

===Background===
Tamayo Hernández was the seventh journalist killed or disappeared in the country in 2006, placing Mexico at the top of the list for journalists assassinated in the Western Hemisphere. In the state of Guerrero, where Tamayo Hernández was killed, several other journalists received death threats that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=El Director General condena el asesinato del periodista mexicano Misael Tamayo Hernández |url=http://portal.unesco.org/es/ev.php-URL_ID=35710&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=12 January 2013 |newspaper=Comunicado de prensa N°2006-139 of [[UNESCO]] |date=11 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Dbh8qvkS?url=http://portal.unesco.org/es/ev.php-URL_ID%3D35710%26URL_DO%3DDO_TOPIC%26URL_SECTION%3D201.html |archivedate=12 January 2013 |deadurl=no |language=Spanish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guerrero: Fue ejecutado el director del diario El Despertar de la Costa |url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=222911 |accessdate=11 January 2013 |newspaper=[[Proceso (magazine)|Proceso]] |date=11 November 2006 |agency=Comunicación e Información, S.A. de C.V |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DbhXgzG3?url=http://www.proceso.com.mx/?p=222911 |archivedate=12 January 2013 |deadurl=no |language=Spanish |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Back in 1998, Pedro Valle Hernández and another journalist were assassinated in Guerrero, apparently as a reprisal for their journalistic coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reporter Slain, Possibly Because Of Critical Stories |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-11-01/news/9811010287_1_pedro-valle-hernandez-zihuatanejo-second-reporter |accessdate=11 January 2013 |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=1 November 1998 |agency=Tribune News Services |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DbQnFAsq?url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-11-01/news/9811010287_1_pedro-valle-hernandez-zihuatanejo-second-reporter |archivedate=11 January 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
The most prominent journalists in the state of Guerrero are given an annual award called the "State journalism award Misael Tamayo," in honor of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dan a conocer a ganadores del premio estatal de periodismo Misael Tamayo|url=http://www.lajornadaguerrero.com.mx/2010/06/03/index.php?section=cultura&amp;article=011n3cul|accessdate=12 January 2013|newspaper=[[La Jornada]]|date=3 June 2010|location=Ciudad Altamirano|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Tamayo Hernández had five children, one of them named Misael Tamayo Núñez, the current editorial director of ''El Despertar del Sur'' ("The Awakening of the South"), another family-owned newspaper in [[Arcelia (municipality)|Arcelia, Guerrero]], with Concepción Núñez, his wife.&lt;ref name=familia/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neural gas is a simple algorithm for finding optimal data representations based on [[feature vector]]s. The algorithm was coined "neural gas" because of the dynamics of the feature vectors during the adaptation process, which distribute themselves like a gas within the data space. It is applied where [[data compression]] or [[vector quantization]] is an issue, for example [[speech recognition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

==Algorithm==
Given a [[probability distribution]] &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; of data vectors &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a finite number of [[feature vector]]s &lt;math&gt;w_i,
 i = 1,\cdots,N&lt;/math&gt;.

With each time step &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, a data vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; randomly chosen from &lt;math&gt;P(x)&lt;/math&gt; is presented. Subsequently, the distance order of the feature vectors to the given data vector &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is determined. Let &lt;math&gt;i_0&lt;/math&gt; denote the index of the closest feature vector, &lt;math&gt;i_1&lt;/math&gt; the index of the second closest feature vector, and &lt;math&gt;i_{N-1}&lt;/math&gt; the index of the feature vector most distant to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Then each feature vector is adapted according to

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt; w_{i_k}^{t+1} = w_{i_k}^{t} + \varepsilon\cdot  e^{-k/\lambda}\cdot (x-w_{i_k}^{t}), k = 0, \cdots, N-1 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; as the adaptation step size and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; as the so-called neighborhood range. &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; are reduced with increasing &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. After sufficiently many adaptation steps the feature vectors cover the data space with minimum representation error.&lt;ref&gt;http://wwwold.ini.rub.de/VDM/research/gsn/JavaPaper/img187.gif{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The adaptation step of the neural gas can be interpreted as [[gradient descent]] on a [[Loss function|cost function]]. By adapting not only the closest feature vector but all of them with a step size decreasing with increasing distance order, compared to (online) [[k-means clustering]] a much more robust convergence of the algorithm can be achieved. The neural gas model does not delete a node and also does not create new nodes.

==Variants==
A number of variants of the neural gas algorithm exists in the literature so as to mitigate some of its shortcomings. More notable is perhaps Bernd Fritzke's growing neural gas,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fritzke|first1=Bernd|title=A Growing Neural Gas Network Learns Topologies|journal=Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems|date=1995|volume=7|pages=625-632|url=https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~meeden/DevelopmentalRobotics/fritzke95.ps|accessdate=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also one should mention further elaborations such as the Growing When Required network&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marsland|first1=Stephen|last2=Shapiro|first2=Jonathan|last3=Nehmzow|first3=Ulrich|title=A self-organising network that grows when required|journal=Neural Networks|date=2002|volume=15|issue=8|pages=1041–1058|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608002000783|accessdate=2016-04-26|doi=10.1016/s0893-6080(02)00078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the incremental growing neural gas.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prudent|first1=Yann|last2=Ennaji|first2=Abdellatif|title=An incremental growing neural gas learns topologies|journal=Neural Networks, 2005. IJCNN'05.

=== Growing neural gas ===
Fritzke describes the growing neural gas (GNG) as an incremental network model that learns topological relations by using a "[[Hebbian learning|Hebb]]-like learning rule",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; only, unlike the neural gas, it has no parameters that change over time and it is capable of continuous learning.

=== Growing when required ===
Having a network with a growing set of nodes, like the one implemented by the GNG algorithm was seen as a great advantage, however some limitation on the learning was seen by the introduction of the parameter λ, in which the network would only be able to grow when iterations were a multiple of this parameter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The proposal to mitigate this problem was a new algorithm, the Growing When Required network (GWR), which would have the network grow more quickly, by adding nodes as quickly as possible whenever the network identified that the existing nodes would not describe the input well enough. 

=== Incremental growing neural gas ===
Another neural gas variant inspired in the GNG algorithm is the incremental growing neural gas (IGNG). The authors propose the main advantage of this algorithm to be "learning new data (plasticity) without degrading the previously trained network and forgetting the old input data (stability)."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Non Violent Resistance''' (NVR) is a psychological approach for overcoming destructive, aggressive, controlling and risk-taking behaviour. It was originally developed to address serious behaviour problems in young people, although it is now also being utilised in many different areas, such as adult entitled dependence, anxiety-related problems, problems linked to paediatric illness, internet dependency and misuse, and domestic violence perpetrated by adults.

Empirical research is on-going and relatively new. However, the outcome studies carried out so far has shown it to be effective for reducing childhood violence and aggression, improved relationships within the family, as well as increasing parents’ confidence levels and improving parental mental health.

NVR's principles are based on the socio-political practice of [[nonviolent resistance]] (or [[nonviolent action]]), which refers to achieving goals through nonviolent methods, such as [[symbolic protests]], [[civil disobedience]], and economic or political noncooperation.  The modern leading father of nonviolent resistance as a form of political struggle is [[Mahatma Gandhi]], the Indian leader who used peaceful protests to seek independence from the British. NVR draws upon the approaches used by Gandhi &lt;ref&gt;Gandhi, A. (2004). Nonviolence as a comprehensive philosophy. Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology, 10: 87-90.&lt;/ref&gt; to develop interventions aimed at the violent or self-destructive behaviour of young people who act in controlling ways. More recently, the practice of NVR has spawned the concept of the “anchoring function of attachment”, a contribution to attachment theory which emphasises the child's need to become secure in the relationship with a ‘strong and wise adult’,&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, J. (1982). Attachment and loss: retrospect and prospect. [[American Journal of Orthopsychiatry]], 52, 664–678.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the conceptualisation of the “New Authority”, which is based on principles such as transparency, inter-personal closeness, accountability of the adult within the community, rather than the principles of positional power, hierarchy and distance which marked more traditional forms of authority.

==Description==

As a therapeutic or coaching process, NVR involves the individual's family, and generally extends to include family friends, professionals, schools and members of the community in its network. The approach believes parents, carers or teachers overcome their isolation by adopting such a large support network, and drawing on interpersonal support. A course of NVR lasts for about 3 months, or longer in more serious cases.  Parents or carers of the aggressive young person typically attend one session with an NVR practitioner weekly, and may receive additional support such as telephone calls 1-2 times a week initially, gradually reducing as the intervention progresses. The violent child does not have to participate; NVR has been designed specifically to help families in which a young person does not cooperate in the therapeutic process. It is thought that the parents’ perseverance in the face of the child's non-cooperation sends a message of resistance.

The purposes of NVR is to help adults develop a positive form of authority, develop effective, non-punitive strategies of addressing the young person's [[controlling behaviour]] without escalation, restore a sense of balance in the family, and improve family relationships. NVR is a stable alternative to violent conflict and unproductive attempts at verbal persuasion.

The intervention is used for a variety of aggressive people, including children, adolescents and adults. It is currently used with children in care, children with mental health issues, and people with [[Autistic Spectrum Disorder]] (ASD). The methods are concrete, specific, and are not overly reliant on the spoken word, which is why the approach is offered to families of people with ASD. The techniques can also be easily adapted into story boards and other methods, which may help the child understand what changes are being made to resist their behaviour.

===The Principles and Aims of NVR===

The intervention is based on a number of principles and assumptions. Most young people who act in defiant, aggressive or violent ways do this to control others around them.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, C., and Seligman, M.E. (1983). Learned Helplessness and Victimization. Journal of Social Issues, 39, 103-116.&lt;/ref&gt; A key element of NVR is an understanding of the concept of ‘parental (or adult) presence.’ This refers to an awareness of the person of the parent and their authority at home, in school, and when the child is with their peers. It also includes parents not being pushed aside, and regaining their parental space in the family unit. Practitioners find that parents of violent children often feel helpless and isolated, and claim this is largely due to a lowered parental presence. NVR aims to increase the parents’ presence in their child's mind, and to reduce the parent's helplessness. One necessary measure in achieving this is the development of an adult support network. This is an essential element in this therapeutic process, where supporters in the network play vital roles, such as mentor, mediator, witness and protector. Some of the other methods for raising parental presence are briefly mentioned in the next section.

Another important principle in NVR is that of a delayed reaction: this refers to ‘striking when the iron is cold,’ or not reacting immediately to a situation, which avoids [[Conflict escalation|escalation]]. Instead, the issue is dealt with later at the resistor's choosing. This gives back power to the parent, and helps them regain parental authority and presence.
Finally, the therapy works on the premise of using action, not words. This is particularly useful when NVR is applied to people with ASD, who struggle with social communication.

The approach endeavours to help parents gain authority. This is achieved through supporting parents to become active in four main areas:

====De-escalation====
De-escalation refers to refusing to be drawn into a battle with the other (escalation). Escalation can be symmetrical &lt;ref&gt;Watzlawick, P., Beavin, J.H., and Jackson, D.D. (1967). Pragmatics of human communication:  a study of interactional patterns, pathologies and paradoxes. W.W.Norton.&lt;/ref&gt; where parent and child each attempt to gain control over the other and raise levels of aggression in an upward spiral, or complementary,&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, G.R., Dishion, T.J., and Bank, L. (1984). Family interaction: a process model of deviancy training. Aggressive Behavior, 10: 253-267.&lt;/ref&gt; where parents give in to child demands or the threat of violence or other controlling responses and acquiesce to the child. In each case, the parents are believed to lose more of their authority, and family members are weakened and left more vulnerable. By developing strategies to manage risk with an NVR practitioner, the aim is that parents can build up their authority without getting involved in fruitless power struggles.

====Breaking taboos====

The parents seen in NVR therapy often attempt to “keep the peace” by following rules explicitly or implicitly set in place by their child. It is important to break the rules, in order to resist the violence. Parents therefore learn to break the rules that their child has set up; this ‘parental disobedience,’ is a key principle of the approach.

====Taking non-violent action====

NVR does not rely mainly on punishments or consequences for reducing unacceptable behaviours, but instead on increasing the parents ability to become present and resist aggressive or self-risk behaviours.

====Reconciliation gestures====

Reconciliation gestures play an important role in the therapy process. The purpose of the gestures is to show the young person that their families care for and love them. The gestures are also thought to help the individual and their parents relate to one another beyond the aggression, and reestablish a loving connection.

====Child focus====

It is believed within the NVR field that when young people have experienced physical or sexual child abuse or neglect, their aggressive or dismissive behaviour can mask vulnerability, such as anxiety or fear, and/or an unmet need. Some areas of unmet needs are said to be:

*	The need to feel safe and protected
*	The need to feel a sense of belonging
*	The need to have a coherent and benign self- and family narrative
*	The need for support in one's development.

The child's behavioural problems divert the attention of adult and child away from any unmet need and vulnerability. NVR claims that by raising their own sense of agency and strength in resisting the destructive behaviour, and then using their efforts at reconciliation to address the child's unmet needs, the adults can re-sensitise themselves for the child's distress and re-instate themselves in a caring position.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob, P. (2011). Re-connecting Parents and Young People with Serious Behaviour Problems – Child-Focused Practice and Reconciliation Work in Non Violent Resistance Therapy, found at: [http://www.newauthority.net/data/cntfiles/146_.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Techniques NVR uses===

NVR uses a variety of methods, many of which are outlined in the NVR parents’ manual.&lt;ref&gt;Omer, H. (2004/1). Nonviolent resistance. A new approach to violent and self-destructive children. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The resistance process is developed step by step with the NVR practitioner, in order to increase the parents’, carers’ or teachers’ confidence. Initially, the intervention begins with a written announcement; the therapist or NVR coach/practitioner supports and guides the parents and/or other adults in writing and planning how to carry out the announcement without escalation or engaging in unproductive communication.

A support network is developed by the parents with the aid of a NVR practitioner throughout the process. The aim of this is to help them to remove the secrecy and expose the violence, and help them to feel supported in their actions. The support network also plays a role in carrying out action, such as participating in ‘sit ins,’ where parents and supporters sit in with the child after an aggressive incident and express their expectation that the child will develop a solution to the violence. Parents are encouraged to document acts of violence or self-destructive acts, as well as their own behaviour and responses around these, and to pass this information on to their supporters, in order to enable public accountability for their own and the young person's behaviour.

The supporters also play a role in a ‘campaign of concern’ or ‘message campaign,’ by contacting the young person and expressing their concern for them and others affected by their aggression. This is done to reinforce the parents’ or carers’ message of resistance.

After any demonstration of resistance to the child's aggression, adults use reconciliation gestures to communicate their unconditional care, respect and love for the young person.

Further techniques are the telephone round and tailing, which are used as methods for raising adult presence where young people withdraw from their families into dangerous environments. Parents and other adults use these and other methods, draw upon their inter-personal resources, to effectively resist their child's violence and self-destructive behaviour by raising parental (adult) presence.

==Applications==

NVR can be utilised with a range of difficulties such as anxiety and aggression in young people on the autistic spectrum, [[Obsessive Compulsive Disorder]] (OCD) and other severe anxiety-related problems, when the child does not collaborate in treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Lebowitz, E., &amp; Omer, H. (2013).Treating Childhood and Adolescent Anxiety: A Guide for Caregivers&lt;/ref&gt; NVR is now being used for self-isolation,&lt;ref&gt;Omer, H. (2004/2). Children who take control of the house. In: Nonviolent resistance. A new approach to violent and self-destructive children. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; adult entitled dependency,&lt;ref&gt;Lebowitz, E., Dolberger, D., Nortov, E., &amp; Omer, H. (2012). Parent Training in Nonviolent Resistance for Adult Entitled Dependence. Family Process, 51 (1), 90-106.&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of other problem areas.

Recently NVR has been developed as an intervention in a variety of different settings, such as residential care &lt;ref&gt;Körner, B., and Uschold-Meier, E. (2007). Carer presence in children’s homes. Non Violent Resistance in residential care contexts? (German) in A. von Schlippe and M. Grabbe (Eds.) Werkstattbuch Elterncoaching, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht.&lt;/ref&gt; and foster care (Jakob and van Holen, in process). It is also being developed for other problematic areas, such as [[childhood obesity]] &lt;ref&gt;Eberding, A. and Lemme, M. (2007). Child obesity – parental presence. Coaching in the context of obesity training for children and adolescents. (German) in A. von Schlippe and M. Grabbe (Eds.) Werkstattbuch Elterncoaching, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht.&lt;/ref&gt; and chronic paediatric illness.&lt;ref name="Ollefs"&gt;Ollefs, B., Von Schlippe, A., Omer, H., and Kriz, J. (2009). Adolescents showing externalising problem behaviour. Effects of parent coaching (German). Familiendynamik, 3: 256-265.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

NVR is a relatively new intervention amongst other psychological interventions. It was developed by Haim Omer and colleagues at the University of Tel Aviv,&lt;ref&gt;Omer, H. (2001). Helping parents deal with children’s acute disciplinary problems without escalation: the principle of non-violent resistance.  Family Process, 40: 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; to support parents/carers in developing effective resistance against violence.

NVR is widely used in Israel, Germany and a number of other European countries. In the English – speaking world, it has been mainly introduced to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Jakob, P. (2006). Bringing non-violent resistance to Britain. Context, 84, 36-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family therapy roots===

Reviews indicate that systemic and multi-modal approaches are effective in decreasing destructive behaviour in adolescents with behavioural problems.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, A. (2009). The effectiveness of family therapy and systemic interventions for child-focused problems. Journal of Family Therapy, 31: 3-45.&lt;/ref&gt; The NVR approach applies traditions of Systemic (Family) Therapy, involving family members and institutions surrounding the individual in the therapy process, and change is brought about through the interactions between them.

===Other roots===

NVR has its roots in the philosophy and methods of socio-political nonviolent resistance, such as those used by Mahatma Gandhi and [[Martin Luther King]]. Gandhi practised and advocated non-violence when leading protests against those seeking to oppress him and his fellow men and women.  He famously spoke out about non-violently fighting the British without arms, through being peaceful and non-retaliatory. The principle of non-violently resisting a child's controlling behaviour derives from the same ideas and beliefs. Gandhi also promoted solidarity, which is one of the aims the supporters’ network strives to evoke in the parents.

Finally, the stance of de-escalation and refusal to be drawn into conflict can be summed up by a famous quote from Gandhi: “An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind”.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, M E. (2009). Encyclopedia of the Literature of Empire, p. 316. New York: Facts on File.&lt;/ref&gt; It is these non-violent beliefs that provided the foundation for NVR.

==Evaluation of Effectiveness==

NVR has an emerging evidence base. A recent study showed that NVR was highly effective at improving the problematic behaviour of a large percentage of young people, with no differences between children and adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Weinblatt, U. and Omer, H. (2008). Non-violent resistance: a treatment for parents of children with acute behavior problems.  Journal of Marital and Family Therapy, 34: 75-92.&lt;/ref&gt; It was further found that NVR reduced parents’ feelings of helplessness, increased their confidence, and it also improved parental mental health. Parental escalation also decreased within the first four months of the intervention. There was also a very low drop-out rate: over 90% of all families completed the programme.

A study conducted in Germany compared NVR against TEEN Triple-P (a parenting programme for parents of teenagers) and a waiting list group.&lt;ref name="Ollefs" /&gt; It was found that the TEEN triple-P and NVR groups showed significant improvements in parenting behaviour, parental presence, reduced parental depression and helplessness. NVR was superior to TEEN Triple-P in showing significant improvements in the 11- to 18-year-old children's [[externalising behaviour problems]], assessed by Achenbach's.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbach, T. M. (1991). Manual for the Child Behavior Checklist 4‐18 and 1991 profile. Burlington: University of Vermont, Department of Psychiatry.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Child Behaviour Checklist]] (CBCL).

Finally, research has shown an improvement in reduced parental submission, fewer power struggles and improvements in children's behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Lavi-Levavi, I., (2010). Improvement in systemic intra- familial variables by "Non- Violent Resistance" treatment for parents of children and adolescents with behavioral problems, PhD dissertation, Tel- Aviv University, Tel Aviv.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, there is a [[Randomized controlled trial]] (RCT) of NVR for looked after children being conducted in Belgium (Opvang).

The '''Nude in the Nettles''' is the name given by the media to the body of an unknown female decedent found concealed under a nettle bush near [[Sutton Bank]] in [[North Yorkshire]], [[England]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The police were notified of the body’s location by an anonymous caller who claimed that they could not give their name for reasons of ‘national security’. Neither the identity of the woman nor the caller has ever been established despite an extensive investigation.

On Friday 28 August 1981, at around 8:00&amp;nbsp;am, C John Jeffries of [[Ripon]] Police received a telephone call at the Police Station from a man who was described as well-spoken with a slight trace of a local accent.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=hoz0CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=scawton+moor+house&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=a9BuEAqMXz&amp;sig=x8JRXMbiDUNPdpPHL4mYG4Z5kEA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpj8W49dXYAhWFB8AKHSFEAi44ChDoAQgmMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=scawton%20moor%20house&amp;f=false|title=Murders &amp; Mysteries of the North York Moors|last=Walker|first=Peter|publisher=Summersdale Publishers LTD - ROW|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=265-281}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The caller stated: “''Near Scawton Moor House, you will find a decomposed body among the willow herbs.”''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The caller then gave instructions on how to find the body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The called lasted for less than a minute and when the caller was asked for his name and address he stated that he could not give this information for “''reasons of national security''” and he abruptly terminated the call.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazetteherald.co.uk/news/9588893.DNA_breakthrough_in_Sutton_Bank_body_case/|title=DNA breakthrough in Sutton Bank body case|website=Gazette &amp; Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The local village constable attended the location identified but could not initially find the body, however, after careful searching, he uncovered human bones underneath a large bed of [[Rosebay willow-herb|Rosebay Willow]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The [[Criminal Investigation Department (India)|CID]] were called to the scene and cleared a large area of undergrowth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The body was discovered near to Sutton Bank Top&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; on an [[U roads in Great Britain|unclassified road]] between [[Sutton Bank]] and [[Scawton]] and [[Rievaulx]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; near the junction with the [[A170 road|A170]] [[Thirsk]] to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] Road.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

It is thought that the body had lain undisturbed for up to two years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A clue was a discarded lid from a tin of meat paste, which was found to have been sold on 6 October 1979, which was found beneath the body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Police believe the woman was murdered but have never revealed how she died.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The body was so well concealed that it was highly improbable that it could have been discovered by accident despite the fact that the location was near to the entrance to Scawton Moor House Farm which was a popular family picnic area.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The anonymous caller was later a suspect in the murder but their identity was never established.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Description of the victim ==
In life, the woman was {{convert|5|ft|4|in}}&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; tall. She had dark brown hair with a length of around 4-6 inches&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which was untreated and cut in a [[Pageboy|page-boy]] style.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The victim’s toenails were painted with [[Max Factor]] Maxi, pale-pink&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and she wore a size four shoe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The woman had given birth to two or three children during her life and although no wedding ring was found it is believed that she had been married.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; No jewellery or clothing of any kind was found with the body implying that someone had tried to conceal the victims identity.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Analysis of the skeleton revealed that the victim had a neck [[Vertebra|vertebrae]] abnormality which would have caused a bad back in life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The victim also had a displaced [[septum]] and an old ankle fracture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Bone analysis revealed that until the age of seven, the woman lived in an area with high levels of natural [[fluoride]] in the drinking water, two local areas that had such water were [[Hartlepool]] and [[Grimsby]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

All the victims upper teeth, and all but six of her lower teeth, were missing and an upper [[dental plate]] had been fitted.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The woman had heavy staining on her remaining teeth which indicated that she smoked and drank heavily and did not pay much attention to herself in life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Subsequent events ==
Following the investigation of the site of the discovery the wider investigation discovered some female clothing, a black evening gown and some underwear, hanging from a tree about a mile away from the location of the body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The items could not be proved to relate to the discovery of the woman but no one has come forward to claim them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Police investigated the possibility that the woman was an escaped inmate from [[HM Prison Askham Grange|Askham Grange]] open prison.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/04/sutton-bank-body-cold-cases|title='Sutton Bank body' exhumed as part of cold cases review|last=Laville|first=Sandra|date=2013-01-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the prisoner unexpectedly responded to a request to prove that she was still alive by sending investigating officers two thumb prints and a signature on a blank sheet of paper.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In November 1981 medical students constructed a waxwork of the woman in one of the first examples of using this technique to identify an unknown decedent.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2011/08/24/police-plea-over-unsolved-murder-of-nude-in-the-nettles-115875-23366745/|title=Police plea over unsolved murder of Nude in the Nettles|date=24 August 2011|publisher=The Daily Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/9210177.Fresh_appeal_in_30_year_old_murder/|title=Fresh appeal in murder of woman found near Sutton Bank in 1981|date=23 August 2011|publisher=The Press (York)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Later, his image was adopted as the eagle appearing on a globe in [[Case Corporation]]'s logo and as the screaming eagle on the insignia of the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[101st Airborne Division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wisvetsmuseum.com/exhibitions/online/old_abe/?ID=462|title=Old Abe the War Eagle: Controversy|publisher=Wisconsin Veterans Museum|access-date=2016-07-27|quote=The Wisconsin Veterans Museum and the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center's Molecular Archaeology Group tested four Old Abe feathers from the museum's collection and found conclusively that Old Abe was a male eagle.|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20160921083338/http://www.wisvetsmuseum.com/exhibitions/online/old_abe/?ID=462|archive-date=September 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capture and sale==
[[File:Ahgamahwegezhig (Chief Sky).jpeg|thumb|220px|Ahgamahwegezhig (Chief Sky)&lt;br/&gt;Indian captor of "Old Abe"&lt;ref name='GALLERY'/&gt;]]Old Abe was captured by Ahgamahwegezhig or "Chief Sky".  He was the son of Ah-mous (translated either as "The Little Bee" or "Thunder of Bees"), who was an influential leader of the [[Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa|Lac du Flambeau Ojibwe]].

In spring of 1861, Chief Sky set up a hunting and fishing camp near the [[Flambeau River|South Fork of the Flambeau River]], within the present day [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest|Chequamegon National Forest]], east of [[Park Falls, Wisconsin]].  Here, he noticed a treetop nest, with two fledgling eagles, and to capture them, cut down the tree.  One eaglet died from the fall, and the other became the young Indian's pet.&lt;ref name='BARRETT'/&gt;  That summer, Chief Sky and his father canoed down the [[Chippewa River (Wisconsin)|Chippewa River]] on a trading expedition.  At  [[Jim Falls, Wisconsin]],&lt;ref name='JIMFALLS'/&gt; they encountered [[McCann brothers#Daniel McCann|Daniel McCann]], who lived nearby in [[Eagle Point, Wisconsin|Eagle Point]]. The Indians sold the eagle to McCann in exchange for a bushel of corn.&lt;ref name='SKYSTORY'/&gt;

In August 1861, John C. Perkins,&lt;ref name='BARTLETT'/&gt; assisted by Seth Pierce, Frank McGuire,&lt;ref name='MCGUIRE'/&gt; Thomas G. Butler and Victor Wolf,&lt;ref name='WOLF'/&gt; recruited a company of volunteers from [[Eau Claire County, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]] and [[Chippewa County, Wisconsin|Chippewa]] Counties.  This company was called the "Eau Claire Badgers".  Soon after its formation, McCann offered to sell the eagle to the Badgers, for $2.50.  In his "History of Old Abe", published in 1865, Joseph O. Barrett, who helped McCann bring the eagle to Eau Claire, gave a description of the transaction, which can be paraphrased as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Will you buy my eagle," said McCann, "only two dollars and a half?"&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"Here, boys, let's put in twenty five cents apiece," answered Frank McGuire, who began to
collect quarters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He also solicited a contribution from a civilian, S. M. Jeffers, but was rebuffed.  When the soldiers heard of this, they accosted Jeffers, and gave him three lusty groans.  When he understood that they were protesting against his reluctance to help buy the eagle, Jeffers laughed, paid for the bird with a [[Quarter Eagle]] and presented him to the Company.  After that, he had cheers instead of groans.  The quarters were returned to the donors.&lt;ref name='BARRETT'/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Captain Perkins named the eagle after President [[Abraham Lincoln]],&lt;ref name='NAME'/&gt; his quartermaster, Francis L. Billings, made a special perch on which to carry the bird into battle,&lt;ref name='BARRETT'/&gt; and a young soldier, James McGinnis, volunteered to take care of him.&lt;ref name='MCLAIN'/&gt;

==Civil War==
[[File:Camp Randall arch (2).jpg|thumb|220px|A sculpture of Old Abe is at the top&lt;br/&gt;of the [[Camp Randall]] Arch&lt;ref name='ARCH'/&gt;]]On September 3, 1861, the Badgers embarked, aboard the steamer "Stella Whipple", on a trip down the Chippewa to the Mississippi and up the [[Wisconsin River]] to [[Madison, Wisconsin]].  They arrived on the 6th and were immediately mustered into service as Company C of the [[8th Wisconsin Volunteer Infantry Regiment]].  They became the regimental color company and were given the name "Eagle Company".  The regiment also became the "Eagle Regiment".  After a few weeks of training at [[Camp Randall]], it began to play an important role in the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War]].&lt;ref name='MCLAIN'/&gt;

===Island Number Ten===
On October, 12, the regiment left for [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where the eagle got loose and flew out of sight.  Fortunately, a policeman soon returned him.&lt;ref name='MCLAIN'/&gt;  On the following day, the regiment left by rail to [[Fredericktown, Missouri]], and  on October 20, 1861, took part in the [[battle of Fredericktown]]. Subsequently, they were assigned guard duty until March 4, 1862, when they relocated to Point Pleasant, near [[New Madrid, Missouri]], where they became part of General [[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]'s [[Army of the Mississippi]].  From this base, during March and April, they participated in the [[Battle of Island Number Ten]], which ended with a major victory that opened the Mississippi to Union forces down to [[Fort Pillow State Park|Fort Pillow]], just above [[Memphis, Tennessee#19th century|Memphis]]. Thousands of Confederate prisoners were taken, along with valuable supplies.&lt;ref name='HISTORY8TH'/&gt;

===Corinth===
In May 1862, the 8th participated in General [[Henry Halleck]]'s [[Siege of Corinth]], whose objective was to secure a critical rail junction of the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad|Mobile &amp; Ohio]] and [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad|Memphis &amp; Charleston]] railroads.  On May 9, 1862, during the approach to [[Corinth, Mississippi|Corinth]], the Eagle Company experienced its first serious combat at the [[Battle of Farmington, Mississippi]], during which Old Abe Spread his wings and screamed.  Here, Captain Perkins died and was replaced by the newly promoted Captain Victor Wolf.&lt;ref name='FARMINGTON'/&gt; On May 29, after a skirmish at defensive works before Corinth, the Confederates withdrew during the night.  The next day, the regiment marched into the city.  That day, James McGinnis became sick with a fatal illness and was replaced as eagle bearer by Thomas J. Hill, who served until David McLain took over on August 18.&lt;ref name='MCLAIN'/&gt;

On August 22, after being bivouacked in summer quarters, the regiment arrived in [[Tuscumbia, Alabama]], which is in the northwest corner of the state a few miles from the Mississippi border.  By this time, General [[Ulysses S. Grant]] had taken over Halleck's responsibilities in [[Western Theater of the American Civil War#Kentucky.2C Tennessee.2C and northern Mississippi .28June 1862 .E2.80.93 January 1863.29|northern Mississippi]].  The 8th Wisconsin was still part of the [[Army of the Mississippi]], but General [[William Rosecrans]] had replaced Pope as commander.  The regiment was in the second brigade of General [[David S. Stanley]]'s second division, which was led by Colonel [[Joseph A. Mower]]. Pope's army was assigned to hold 20 miles of rail from Corinth east to [[Iuka, Mississippi|Iuka]], where the 8th Wisconsin was stationed.  On September 13, 1862, the Confederate [[Army of the West (1862)|Army of the West]] under General [[Sterling Price]] appeared at Iuka and forced the regiment back to Farmington.

Shortly thereafter, forces under Rosecrans and General [[Edward Ord]] attempted to capture Price's army, which awaited, at Iuka, the arrival of massive reinforcements from General [[Earl Van Dorn]]'s [[Confederate Army of West Tennessee|Army of West Tennessee]].  On September 19, during the [[Battle of Iuka]], a fresh north wind caused an [[acoustic shadow]] that prevented Ord from hearing the battle.  Consequently, he was unaware of it, and his troops stood idle while fighting raged a few miles away.&lt;ref name='HISTORY8TH'/&gt;  Nevertheless, the Army of the Cumberland forced Price to withdraw during the night.  He soon linked up with Van Dorn in [[Ripley, Mississippi|Ripley]].

On October 3 and 4, the combined Confederate armies launched a full-scale assault on Corinth, which was repulsed by troops under Rosecrans.  During heavy fighting in this [[Second Battle of Corinth]], 21 soldiers of the 8th Wisconsin died, and 60 were wounded.  Colonel Mower was wounded in the neck and briefly captured.

Newspaper accounts of this battle claimed that Old Abe soared over the front lines.  According to David McLain, these stories are exaggerated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;… a bullet cut the cord that held the eagle to his perch.  About the same time that the cord was cut, Old Abe was shot through one wing, cutting out three quill feathers, but not drawing blood, and the bearer (McLain) was shot through the left shoulder of his blouse and right leg of his pants.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
… (The eagle) flew about 50 feet down the line, must have been what caused the newspapers to come out the next week with great headlines telling about the eagle of the 8th Wisconsin getting away after a rebel bullet cut his cord and soaring, over the lines of both armies, and back to his perch, which is not so.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
He was quite excited always in battle and he'd spread his wings and scream but never flew over the lines of either army.&lt;ref name='MCLAIN'/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Vicksburg===
[[File:Vicksburg Wisconsin Memorial.jpg|thumb|220px|upright |Old Abe on the Wisconsin Memorial, [[Vicksburg National Military Park]]&lt;ref name='MONUMENT'/&gt;]]

On November 2, 1862, the regiment moved to [[Grand Junction, Tennessee]], where it joined forces being assembled for General Grant's [[Vicksburg Campaign#Battles in the Operations against Vicksburg.2C December 1862 .E2.80.93 January 1863|first attempt to take the strategic river city of Vicksburg]].  From this base, Grant [[Mississippi Central Railroad (present)#Civil War .281861-1865.29|moved down the Mississippi Central Railroad]] in conjunction with [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General William Tecumseh Sherman]], who launched a simultaneous advance north of the city.  Confederates attempted to defend the railroad's [[Tallahatchie River]] bridge near [[Abbeville, Mississippi|Abbeville]], but retreated when they learned of a flanking maneuver by Grant. Skirmishes were fought along the railroad to [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]], and the Confederates were pushed south past [[Water Valley, Mississippi|Water Valley]], but after the battle of [[Coffeeville, Mississippi|Coffeeville]], managed to stall the Federal advance at [[Oakland, Mississippi|Oakland]].

During this push, the 8th Wisconsin, with Old Abe, was in the thick of the fighting.&lt;ref name='HISTORY8TH'/&gt;  In Oxford, the regiment was accosted by a southern girl who scornfully exclaimed:  "Oh!  See that ''Yankee Buzzard''.", enraging the men, drawing a verbal response from the 8th's ranks that caused her to retreat hastily to her house.&lt;ref name='DRIGGS'/&gt;  This was a name by which southern civilians and soldiers referred to Old Abe.  Under orders from their officers, Confederate troops made numerous attempts to kill or capture the eagle, but they never succeeded.&lt;ref name='ZEITLIN'/&gt;

On December 20, while Grant was stalled, [[Earl Van Dorn|General Van Dorn]] led a successful cavalry raid on the Union supply base at [[Holly Springs, Mississippi|Holly Springs]].  After destroying the supplies, Van Dorn and General [[Nathan Bedford Forest]] moved north into Tennessee tearing up railroad and telegraph lines. With his infrastructure disrupted, and with Sherman's advance turned back at [[Battle of Chickasaw Bayou|Chickasaw Bayou]], Grant was forced to end the campaign and retire to [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].

At the time of Van Dorn's raid, the Wisconsin regiment was stationed in Holly Springs on guard duty.  Its troops were surprised, overwhelmed, captured, and immediately [[Parole#Prisoners of war|paroled]].  Consequently, their commander, Colonel Murphy, was dismissed.  He was replaced by [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Robbins, who was promoted to [[Colonel]].&lt;ref name='HISTORY8TH'/&gt;  On December 28, when the regiment had moved to [[La Grange, Tennessee]], David McLain turned over his job as eagle bearer to Ed Homeston.&lt;ref name='MCLAIN'/&gt;

In March 1863, the regiment went to [[Helena, Arkansas]], where it became part of [[Vicksburg Campaign#Battles in Grant.27s Operations against Vicksburg.2C April .E2.80.93 July 1863|Grant's plan to cross the Mississippi south of Vicksburg]].  His objectives were to separate Vicksburg from Confederate units under General [[Joseph E. Johnston]] and to prevent supplies from reaching the city on the [[Columbus and Greenville Railway|Southern Railroad]].

From Helena, the regiment went to [[Battle of Young's Point|Young's Point, Louisiana]], where they joined the second brigade of the third division of Sherman's [[XV Corps (Union Army)|XV Corps]], under the command of [[Joseph A. Mower|Brigadier General Mower]], who had been promoted on November 29, 1862.  Here, on April 13, 1863, a promotion to Lieutenant Colonel went to Major [[John Wayles Jefferson]].&lt;ref name='HISTORY8TH'/&gt;  He had been with the regiment since it was formed, and as the grandson of [[Sally Hemings]], is believed to have been also a grandson of [[Thomas Jefferson]].&lt;ref name='DNA'/&gt;

On May 2, Sherman's corps crossed the river at [[Battle of Grand Gulf|Grand Gulf]] and proceeded toward [[Raymond, Mississippi]], which the [[XVII Corps (Union Army)|XVII Corps]] under General [[James B. McPherson]] [[Battle of Raymond|occupied on May 12]].  Sherman bypassed Raymond and advanced on [[Battle of Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]], which he and McPherson took on May 14, and from which Johnston had withdrawn.  After Sherman appointed Mower as military governor of Jackson, Union troops burned part of the town, destroyed numerous factories, and cut the railroad connections with Vicksburg.  Grant's objectives were further consolidated when his army prevailed at the [[Battle of Champion Hill]] on May 16 and at the [[Battle of Big Black River Bridge]] on May 17.  On May 22, the regiment participated in Grant's all-out assault on [[Siege of Vicksburg#Assaults|Vicksburg]]. 
When this operation failed, Grant reluctantly settled into a [[Siege of Vicksburg#Siege|siege]].&lt;ref name='CARTER'/&gt;

[[File:WIS-8th@Viclsburg.jpg|thumb|220px|Old Abe and the color guard at Vicksburg, July 1863:&lt;ref name='GALLERY'/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed Homaston (far left holding perch), Sgt Ambrose Armitage (third from left)&lt;ref name='CARTER'/&gt;]]

During the siege, the 8th Wisconsin left Vicksburg to participate in an expedition to Mechanicsburg, Mississippi, where [[Benjamin Hilliker]] was severely wounded on June 4, 1863.  They then returned to Young's Point where they blocked Confederates from escaping westward from Vicksburg.  From this encampment, Sherman despatched them as part of a force assigned to drive [[John George Walker|General John G. Walker's]] Confederates from [[Richmond, Louisiana]].  This objective was accomplished by the [[battle of Richmond, Louisiana|Battle of Richmond]], on June 15, after which the 8th returned to Young's Point.&lt;ref name='HISTORY8TH'/&gt;

On July 12, 1863, the regiment returned to Vicksburg, shortly after its surrender on July 4. Subsequently, the regiment camped in various places near Vicksburg, from which they joined several mop-up operations.  During this period, in September, Ed Homeston resigned his position as eagle bearer, John Burkhardt took charge of Old Abe, and Colonel Robbins was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Jefferson.  Under his command, the regiment joined McPherson's expedition to [[Canton, Mississippi|Canton]], from October 14 to 20, and participated in expeditions toward [[Pocahontas, Arkansas]] against General [[Nathan Bedford Forest]].  From February 3, 1864, until March 5, they took part in Sherman's [[Battle of Meridian#Destruction of Meridian|Meridian expedition]] against an important railroad center and arsenal in eastern Mississippi.&lt;ref name='HISTORY8TH'/&gt;

In the following letter to Governor [[Edward Salomon]], General [[William Tecumseh Sherman|William T. Sherman]] summarized the activities of the Eighth Wisconsin during the Vicksburg campaign:&lt;ref name='DRIGGS'/&gt;

''To His Excellency, the Governor of Wisconsin:''&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{pad|2em}}Sir&amp;nbsp;Lt. Col. Jefferson, of the Eighth Wisconsin, is about to start for his home on a short leave of absence, during the period of rest allowed us by the lull of military events in this quarter.  I avail myself of the opportunity to express to you my personal and  official approbation of the entire regiment since I have had the honor to count it as one of my command.  The  Eighth Wisconsin has ever done its whole duty, in the camp, on the march and in battle. It has shared with us all the honors and success of our conquest of Mississippi and has displayed peculiar courage and gallantry at Jackson, May 14th, and throughout the siege of Vicksburg.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
{{pad|2em}}It also, under the leadership of Gen. Mower, cleared the west bank of the river, driving the enemy out of Richmond, La., and bore patiently and manfully the deadly sickness of Young's Point, till the fall of Vicksburg admitted of its recall to join us on this higher and more healthy ground. I am glad to report that the men are fast recovering from the sickness caused by that exposure, and I hope it will share with us our future labors and honors.  If within your power, I hope you will fill its thinned ranks, and then I will promise all I can to ensure its return to your State, bearing a full share of honor and fame in the establishment of our General Government on a basis so firm, that no internal or external power can shake it during this generation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With great respect, etc.,&lt;br&gt;

P. Blair]].]]

Sherman was not the only general who had a high regard for the 8th Wisconsin and Old Abe.  In the words of David McLain:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have frequently seen Generals Grant, Sherman, McPherson, Rosecrans, [[Francis Preston Blair, Jr.|Blair]], [[John A. Logan|Logan]], and others, when they were passing our regiment, raise their hats as they passed Old Abe, which always brought a cheer from the regiment and then the eagle would spread his wings …&lt;ref name='MCLAIN'/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Red River Campaign===
In early 1864, many soldiers in the 8th Wisconsin became eligible for veteran furlough.  However, General Sherman made a special request that they join General [[Andrew Jackson Smith|A. J. Smith]]'s forces who had been assigned to the [[Red River Campaign]], along with troops from the [[Army of the Gulf]], under General [[Nathaniel P. Banks]], and Admiral [[David Dixon Porter]]'s [[Mississippi River Squadron]].  After  agreeing to Sherman's request,  the regiment joined the [[XVI Corps (Union Army)#Right Wing|Right Wing of the XVI Corps]], under the command of General Mower.  On March 10, 1864, the contingent began a voyage from Vicksburg down the Mississippi and up the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] to [[Simmesport, Louisiana]], where they disembarked on March 12.  Two days later, Mower's [[Battle of Fort DeRussy|command surprised and captured Fort DeRussy]], which opened the river up to [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]].&lt;ref name='REDOVERVIEW'/&gt;

After arriving there on March 16, the troops from Vicksburg settled down to wait for Banks to arrive and to assess opposing forces under General [[Richard Taylor (general)|Richard Taylor]], who was the son of [[Zachary Taylor|President Zachary Taylor]].  While waiting, General Mower assembled a task force, with which he proceeded twenty five miles to Henderson's hill on Bayou Rapides.  Here, he encountered Confederate defenses.  After leaving a blocking force to engage the defenders at the front, he made a detour of 15 miles to get to their rear, where he arrived around midnight on the cold and rainy night of March 21.  On the way, a courier from General Taylor was  captured and provided the [[countersign (military)|countersign]].  This enabled Mower's forces, including the 8th Wisconsin, to overcome the defenses without a shot being fired.  In addition to 262 prisoners, 4 guns and 400 horses were taken.&lt;ref name='HENDERSON'/&gt;

This success made it possible for Smith's army to move quickly upriver to [[Grand Ecore, Louisiana|Grand Ecore]], where it prepared to support forces of General Banks, which were advancing on [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]].  On April 8, Banks was routed by Taylor at the [[Battle of Mansfield]].  This was a decisive victory, for it stopped the Union advance and turned the campaign into a general retreat.

That evening, retreating units under Banks reached Pleasant Hill nearly simultaneously with Smith's [[XVII Corps (Union Army)|XVII]] and [[XVI Corps (Union Army)|XVI Corps]], which included the 8th Wisconsin.  These reinforcements enabled the Union to win the next day's [[Battle of Pleasant Hill]], but Banks immediately ordered a retreat to Grand Ecore, and from there, to Alexandria.  During this retreat, the regiment fought rear guard actions at [[Natchitoches, Louisiana|Natchitoches]], [[Battle of Monett's Ferry|Monett's Ferry]], and [[Cloutierville, Louisiana|Cloutierville]].

[[File:Bailey's Dam on the Red River.jpg|thumb|Bailey's Dam on the Red River.&lt;br&gt;Illustration from Cassell's History of the United States by Edward Ollier (c. 1900).]]

After Smith's forces arrived in Alexandria on April 26, they were temporarily deployed to prevent attacks during [[Joseph Bailey (general)|Joseph Bailey]]'s attempts to get Porter's squadron over the rapids there, with the aid of [[Bailey's Dam]] and two small wing dams upstream.  After this task was completed, Banks resumed his retreat on May 13, leaving Alexandria in flames.

On May 16, Union forces reached [[Mansura, Louisiana|Mansura]] where Taylor's army [[Battle of Mansura|attempted to prevent them from reaching river transportation]].  After heavy fighting, the Confederates fell back, and the Union troops marched toward Simmesport, where Bailey was building a bridge over the [[Atchafalaya River]] that would allow them to reach transport ships.  On the 18th, Banks learned that Taylor's force was deployed near Yellow Bayou and arranged for Mower to stop the Confederates.  After [[Battle of Yellow Bayou|several hours of see-saw action]], the ground cover caught fire and forced both sides to retire.  The next day, Smith's army embarked and reached Vicksburg on the 24th.

In early June 1864, General Smith ordered Mower to launch a forceful demonstration to deter interference with Mississippi river traffic near [[Lake Village, Arkansas]].  This town is named for its location on [[Lake Chicot]], an oxbow lake formed from the Mississippi.  On the evening of June 5, Mower disembarked and camped near Sunnyside Landing.  The next morning, as he marched along the south side of the lake, Confederates, led by General [[Colton Greene]], fought a [[Battle of Old River Lake|delaying action at Ditch Bayou]] and then withdrew.  The Union troops advanced to Lake Village, camped there overnight, and the next day, boarded transports that took them to Memphis.  At Ditch Bayou, the regiment lost 3 killed and 16 wounded.

===Return to Wisconsin===
On June 19, 1864, 240 reenlisted veterans left Memphis on furlough, with their eagle.  They arrived at Chicago on the 21st.  The next day, flags were displayed along the streets of Madison, the bells of the city were rung, and a national salute was fired.   At the [[Wisconsin Capitol Building#Third capitol|Capitol]], crowds of citizens assembled to greet the veterans and Old Abe.  Here, they were addressed by several dignitaries, including General [[Lucius Fairchild]], Colonel Jefferson and [[List of mayors of Madison, Wisconsin|Chauncey Abbott]], who was a former mayor of Madison.&lt;ref name='BARRETT'/&gt;

A few days later, on June 26, 56 veterans of Company C arrived at Eau Claire, with the eagle, and were greeted with booming cannons, martial music, patriotic songs, and an abundant feast.  Citizens of Chippewa Falls constructed a huge [[wigwam]].  Here, according to Reverend Joseph O. Barrett, who spoke at the celebration, a great feast was served to Old Abe and the soldiers on July 4, 1864.  Afterwards, a procession circled through the streets, headed by a band, the eagle and the veterans.&lt;ref name='BARRETT'/&gt;

In August 1864, the veterans and Old Abe returned from furlough to Memphis.  During their absence, the regiment had been active in northern Mississippi.  Following [[Nathan Bedford Forrest|Forrest's]] victory over a large Union force at [[Battle of Brice's Crossroads|Brice's Crossroads]], on June 10, 1864, Sherman vowed to track him down with forces under "two officers at Memphis who will fight all the time, A. J. Smith and J. A. Mower." A month later, Mower's four brigades overtook Forrest near [[Battle of Tupelo|Tupelo, Mississippi]], repulsed a series of attacks, and inflicted hundreds of casualties, including the slight wounding of Forrest himself.  On August 13, 1864, the day after Mower had been promoted to Major General, the regiment, including the returned troops, participated in another defeat of Forrest's command at Hurricane Creek, Mississippi&lt;ref name='HURRICANE'/&gt;  This was Old Abe's last battle.

[[File:OLD ABE AND GEORGE GILLES.jpg|thumb|Old Abe and George Gillies,&lt;br&gt;who was the last eagle caretaker.]]

September 16, 1864, marked the end of the three years for which original members of the 8th Wisconsin had enlisted.  Consequently, the veterans headed north with the eagle, whom the regiment had agreed to give to the state of Wisconsin.  On September 21, they reached Chicago, where John Burkhardt resigned as eagle bearer and turned Old Abe over to John H. Hill, who had been disabled by a wound at Corinth.  He was the brother of Thomas J. Hill who had also served as eagle bearer.  The next day, Hill bore the eagle into Madison at the head of 70 veterans, of which 26 were from Company C.&lt;ref name='BARRETT'/&gt;  Here, on the 26th, Captain Victor Wolf presented Old Abe to Governor [[James T. Lewis]],&lt;ref name='WOLF'/&gt; who handed the eagle, with its perch, to [[Quartermaster General]] N. F. Lund.&lt;ref name='LUND'/&gt;

==Postbellum==
After Wisconsin took possession of Old Abe, state officials classified him as a "War Relic" and created an "Eagle Department" in the Capitol building, which included a two-room "apartment," a custom bathtub for the eagle, and a caretaker.  Later John Hill served in this capacity.&lt;ref name='POSTWAR'/&gt;

Old Abe became a nationally known celebrity, whose presence at events was requested by individuals and organizations from the state and the country.  Old Abe appeared at the 1876 [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] and the 1880 [[Grand Army of the Republic]] National Convention. Other events were fundraisers for charities, which included: the 1865 Northwest Sanitary Fair in Illinois, Soldiers' Home Fair, Soldier's Orphan's Home, Harvey Hospital, and Ladies Aid Society of Chippewa Falls.&lt;ref name='BARRETT'/&gt;

In February 1881, a small fire broke out in the basement of the Capitol.  After Old Abe raised an alarm, the fire was quickly put out. However, the eagle inhaled a large amount of thick black smoke, and about a month later, lost strength and began to decline.  On March 26, 1881, in spite of the efforts of numerous doctors, Old Abe died in the arms of caretaker George Gilles.&lt;ref name='POSTWAR'/&gt;

[[File:Old abe capitol.jpg|thumb|220px|A replica of Old Abe in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] Chamber]]On September 17, 1881, Old Abe's stuffed remains were placed in a glass  display case located in the rotunda of the [[Wisconsin State Capitol|Capitol]].  Four years later, Old Abe was moved, within the Capitol, from the rotunda to the G.A.R. Memorial Hall. In 1900, his remains were transferred to the new building of the [[Wisconsin Historical Society|State Historical Society of Wisconsin]]. However, pressure from veterans convinced Governor [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.|Robert M. La Follette]] to return Old Abe to the Capitol building in 1903.  That year, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] viewed the remains and expressed his pleasure at being able to see the eagle he had studied in school as a child. However, in 1904, Old Abe's remains and the glass case were destroyed in a [[Wisconsin Capitol Building#1904 fire|fire that razed the Capitol building]].&lt;ref name='POSTWAR'/&gt;

Since 1915, a replica of Old Abe has presided over the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] Chamber in the Capitol, and another is on display at the [[Wisconsin Veterans Museum]] in Madison.&lt;ref name='REPLICA'/&gt;   A stone sculpture of the eagle is at the top of the [[Camp Randall|Camp Randall Arch]].&lt;ref name='ARCH'/&gt;

==In memoriam==
In 1865, [[Jerome Case]] incorporated Old Abe into the trademark of the [[Case Corporation|J. I. Case]] agricultural equipment manufacturing company of [[Racine, Wisconsin]]. This trademark was retired in 1969.&lt;ref name='CASE'/&gt;

The insignia of the [[U.S. Army]]'s [[101st Airborne Division]] is a depiction of Old Abe. Wisconsin was the territory of the original 101st Division after [[World War I]], and the insignia's design is based on Civil War traditions of the state. The black shield derives from black hats worn by members of the [[Iron Brigade]].  This was a famous Civil War unit composed of western regiments, which included three from Wisconsin, but not the 8th regiment.&lt;ref name ='AIRBORNE'/&gt;

Old Abe is the mascot of [[Memorial High School (Eau Claire, Wisconsin)|Eau Claire Memorial High School]], whose athletic teams are known as "Old Abes", and of [[Jerome I. Case High School|Racine Case High School]], whose teams are "Eagles".

'''Pannalal Bhattacharya''' (পান্নালাল ভট্টাচার্যয্) was a famous Bengali singer. Most of the songs he sang were written by [[Ramprasad Sen]] and [[Kamalakanta Bhattacharya (West Bengal)|Kamalakanta Bhattacharya]], both of whom were [[Shakta]] poets of [[Bengal]]. He was eight years younger than his elder brother [[Dhananjay Bhattacharya]]. He developed a special style of singing, [[Shyama Sangeet]], that continues to be used. He committed suicide at the age of 36.

==His Childhood==
Very little is known about his background. Even the Bengali 'Cąritavidan' does not provide adequate information about his early life or  childhood.  He was born in Bally, Barendrapara, Howrah and spent most of his life there.

==First Appearance==
Pannalal started singing in 1947, at the age of 17, with another renowned musician, Sanat Sinha. His elder brother Prafulla took them both to a program, where none of them were allowed to sing because of the immaturity in their voices. They encountered the same problem at [[HMV]]. They got their first break in Megaphone. At first Pannalal sang modern Bengali songs, until Bishwanath Kumar, a friend of Sanat Sinha signed him for his first hit Shyama sangeet, "Aamar sadh na mitilo aasha na purilo, sokoli phuraye jay ma..." (None of my desires were fulfilled, nor my hopes have come true, O mother...). This rendition is now acclaimed as a classic in Bengal. However, "Aamar Sadhna mitilo" wasn't Pannalal's first Shyama sangeet record. His earlier and popular songs include "Aamar Mayer Paye Jaba Hoye", "Tui naki Ma Dayamayee", Tui je Kemon Dayamayee", "Sakali Tomari Ichha", "Amay De Ma Pagal Kore", "Muchiye De Ma Aamar a Duti Nayan", "Moneri basona shyama" among others.

==Personal life==
Pannalal was married and cared well for his family until his death in 1966. After his death his elder brother Dhananjay bore the responsibility of Pannalal's family, along with his own.

==At the peak of popularity==
Pannalal developed a special style of singing, that with devotion. His distinct voice and a spirit filled with devotion have touched the hearts of countless devotees of Mother Kali across Bengal. He became a great devotee of [[Kali]] and always remained engrossed in her thoughts. Pannalal and his elder brother Dhananjay  Bhattacharya, another eminent singer of [[Shyama Sangeet]], wanted to please Kali by offering her their songs. One doesn't need to necessarily know Bengali to empathize with his unparalleled tune dripping with devotion regardless of belief. One will feel his climbing, devoted prayer to Mother Kali mounting in his own heart.

==The last years==
In the last years, Pannalal looked morose for some unknown reason. It is claimed by some that Dhananjay, received the divine grace of Mother [[Kali]], the Exalted, but Pannalal didn't, and so he committed suicide on 27 March 1966, in his house on Kakulia Road. He died only at a very young age of 36, but he has claimed a paramount position in the hearts of thousands of Kali devotees since his first [[Shyama Sangeet]] performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21797">'''Pelvic girdle pain''' (abbreviated '''PGP''') is a [[Symptoms and discomforts of pregnancy|pregnancy discomfort]] that causes [[Chronic pain|pain]], instability and limitation of mobility and functioning in any of the three pelvic joints. PGP has a long history of recognition, mentioned by [[Hippocrates]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Owens Kelly, Pearson Anne, Mason Gerald | year = 2002 | title = Pubic Symphysis Separation | url = | journal = Fetal and Maternal Medicine Review | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 141–155 | doi=10.2017/s0965539502000244}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later described in medical literature by Snelling.&lt;ref name=childbearing&gt;Pain In Childbearing, Key Issues In Management, Margaret Yerby, Lesley Page.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Prior to the 20th century, specialists of pregnancy-related PGP used varying terminologies. It is now referred to as Pregnancy Related Pelvic Girdle Pain that may incorporate the following conditions:

* [[Diastasis symphysis pubis|Diastasis of the Symphysis Pubis]](DSP)
* [[Symphysis pubis dysfunction]](SPD)
* Pelvic Joint Syndrome
* Physiological Pelvic Girdle Relaxation
* Symptom Giving Pelvic Girdle Relaxation
* Posterior Pelvic Pain
* Pelvic Arthropathy
* Inferior Pubic Shear/ Superior Pubic Shear /Symphyseal Shear
* Symphysiolysis
* [[Osteitis pubis]] (usually postpartum)
* [[Sacroiliac joint|Sacroiliitis]]
* One-sided Sacroiliac Syndrome /Double Sided Sacroiliac Syndrome
* [[Hypermobility (joints)|Hypermobility]]

''"The classification between hormonal and mechanical pelvic girdle instability is no longer used. For treatment and/or prognosis it makes no difference whether the complaints started during pregnancy or after childbirth." Mens (2005)''&lt;ref name="multiple"&gt;About Pelvic Girdle Instability. Definition and Concept. Jan M.A. Mens.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
A combination of postural changes,baby, unstable pelvic joints under the influence of pregnancy hormones, and changes in the centre of gravity can all add to the varying degrees of pain or discomfort. In some cases it can come on suddenly or following a fall, sudden abduction of the thighs (opening too wide too quickly) or an action that has strained the joint.

PGP can begin as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Pain is usually felt low down over the [[Symphysis|symphyseal joint]], and this area may be extremely tender to the touch. Pain may also be felt in the [[hips]], [[groin]] and [[abdomen|lower abdomen]] and can radiate down the inner thighs. Women suffering from PGP may begin to waddle or shuffle, and may be aware of an audible clicking sound coming from the pelvis. PGP can develop slowly during pregnancy, gradually gaining in severity as the pregnancy progresses.

During pregnancy and [[postpartum]], the symphyseal gap can be felt moving or straining when walking, climbing stairs or turning over in bed; these activities can be difficult or even impossible. The pain may remain static, e.g., in one place such as the front of the pelvis, producing the feeling of having been kicked; in other cases it may start in one area and move to other areas. It is also possible that a woman may experience a combination of symptoms.

Any weight bearing activity has the potential of aggravating an already unstable pelvis, producing symptoms that may limit the ability of the woman to carry out many daily activities. She may experience pain involving movements such as dressing, getting in and out of the bath, rolling in bed, climbing the stairs or sexual activity. Pain may also be present when lifting, carrying, pushing or pulling.

The symptoms (and their severity) experienced by women with PGP vary, but include:

* Present swelling and/or inflammation over joint.
* Difficulty lifting leg.
* Pain pulling legs apart.
* Inability to stand on one leg.
* Inability to transfer weight through pelvis and legs.
* Pain in hips and/or restriction of hip movement.
* Transferred nerve pain down leg.
* Can be associated with bladder and/or bowel dysfunction.
* A feeling of the symphysis pubis giving way.
* Stooped back when standing.
* Malalignment of pelvic and/or back joints.
* Struggle to sit or stand.
* Pain may also radiate down the inner thighs.
* Waddling or shuffling gait.
* Audible ‘clicking’ sound coming from the pelvis.

===Severity===
The severity and instability of the pelvis can be measured on a three level scale.

'''Pelvic type 1:'''The pelvic ligaments support the pelvis sufficiently. Even when the
muscles are used incorrectly, no complaints will occur when performing everyday activities. This is the most common situation in persons who have never been pregnant, who have never been in an accident, and who are not hypermobile.''

'''Pelvic type 2:'''The ligaments alone do not support the joint sufficiently. A
coordinated use of muscles around the joint will compensate for ligament weakness. In case the muscles around the joint do not function, the patient will experience pain and weakness when performing everyday activities. This type often occurs after giving birth to a child weighing 3000&amp;nbsp;grams or more, in cases of hypermobility, and sometimes after an accident involving the pelvis. Type 2 is the most common form of pelvic instability. Treatment is based on learning how to use the muscles around the pelvis more efficiently.

'''Pelvic type 3:'''The ligaments do not support the joint sufficiently. This is a serious
situation whereby the muscles around the joint are unable to compensate for ligament weakness. This type of pelvic instability usually only occurs after an accident, or occasionally after a (small) accident in combination with giving birth. Sometimes a small accident occurring long before giving birth is forgotten so that the pelvic instability is attributed only to the childbirth. Although the difference between Type 2 and 3 is often difficult to establish, in case of doubt an exercise program may help the patient. However, if Pelvic Type 3 has been diagnosed then invasive treatment is the only option: in this case parts of the pelvis are screwed together. (Mens 2005)&lt;ref name="multiple"/&gt;

===Psychosocial impact===
PGP in pregnancy seriously interferes with participation in society and activities of daily life; the average sick leave due to posterior pelvic pain during pregnancy is 7 to 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Noren Lotta RPT |author2=Ostgaard Solveig |author3=Nielsen Thorkild F |author4=Ostgaard Hans C | year = 1997 | title = Reduction of Sick Leave for Lumbar Back and Posterior Pelvic Pain in Pregnancy | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 22 | issue = 18| pages = 2157–2160 | doi=10.1097/00007632-199709150-00013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases women with PGP may also experience emotional problems such as anxiety over the cause of pain, resentment, anger, lack of self-esteem, frustration and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]; she is three times more likely to suffer [[Postpartum depression|postpartum depressive symptoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gutke A, Josefsson A, Oberg B | date = Jun 2007 | title = Pelvic girdle pain and lumbar pain in relation to postpartum depressive symptoms | url = | journal = Spine | volume = 32 | issue = 13| pages = 1430–6 | doi=10.1097/brs.0b013e318060a673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other psychosocial risk factors associated with woman experiencing PGP include higher level of stress, low job satisfaction and poorer relationship with spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Albert HB, Godskesen M, Korsholm L, Westergaard JG | year = 2006 | title = Risk factors in developing pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 85 | issue = 5| pages = 539–44 | doi=10.1080/00016340600578415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
Sometimes there is no obvious explanation for the cause of PGP but usually there is a combination of factors such as:

# The pelvic joints moving unevenly.
# A change in the activity of the muscles in the pelvis, [[Hip (anatomy)|hip]], abdomen, back and [[pelvic floor]].
# A history of pelvic trauma.
# The position of the baby altering the loading stresses on the pelvic ligaments and joints.
# Strenuous work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Juhl Mette |author2=Kragh Andersen Per |author3=Olsen Jørn |author4=Nybo Andersen Anne-Marie | year = 2005 | title = Psychosocial and Physical Work Environment and Risk of Pelvic Pain in Pregnancy.

==Mechanism==
Pregnancy related Pelvic Girdle Pain (PGP) can be either specific (trauma or injury to pelvic joints or genetical i.e. [[connective tissue disease]]) and non-specific.

[[Pregnancy]] begins the [[Physiology|physiological changes]] through a pattern of hormonal secretion and [[signal transduction]] thus initiating the remodelling of soft tissues, cartilage and ligaments. Over time, the ligaments could be stretched either by injury or excess strain and in turn may cause PGP.

=== Anatomy===
The [[pelvis]] is the largest bony part of the [[skeleton]] and contains three joints: the [[pubic symphysis]], and [[sacroiliac joint|two sacroiliac joints]]. A highly durable network of [[ligament]]s surrounds these joints giving them tremendous strength.

The pubic symphysis has a [[Fibrocartilage| fibrocartilage joint]] which may contain a fluid filled cavity and is [[avascular]]; it is supported by the [[Superior pubic ligament|superior]] and [[Inferior pubic ligament|arcuate ligaments]]. The sacroiliac joints are [[Synovial fluid|synovial]], but their movement is restricted throughout life and they are progressively obliterated by [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]]. The nature of the bony pelvic ring with its three joints determines that no one joint can move independently of the other two.&lt;ref&gt;SPD: The Clinical Presentation, Prevalence, Aetiology, Risk Factors and Morbidity.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Relaxin hormone===
[[Relaxin]] is a [[hormone]] produced mainly by the [[corpus luteum]] of the ovary and breast, in both pregnant and non-pregnant females. During pregnancy it is also produced by the [[placenta]], [[chorion]], and [[decidua]]. The body produces relaxin during menstruation that rises to a peak within approximately 14 days of ovulation and then declines. In pregnant cycles, rather than subsiding, relaxin secretion continues to rise during the first trimester and then again in the final weeks. During pregnancy relaxin has a diverse range of effects, including the production and remodelling of [[collagen]] thus increasing the elasticity of muscles, [[tendon]]s, ligaments and tissues of the birth canal in view of delivery.

Although relaxin's main cellular action in pregnancy is to remodel collagen by [[biosynthesis]] (thus facilitating the changes of connective tissue) it does not seem to generate musculoskeletal problems. European Research has determined that relaxin levels are not a predictor of PGP during pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petersen LK, Hvidman L, Uldbjerg N | year = 1994 | title = Normal Serum Relaxin in Women with Disabling Pelvic Pain During Pregnancy | url = | journal = Gynecol Obstet Invest | volume = 38 | issue = 1| pages = 21–3 | doi=10.1159/000292438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Björklund K, Bergström S, Nordström ML, Ulmsten U | date = Apr 2000 | title = Symphyseal Distention in Relation to Serum Relaxin Levels and Pelvic Pain in Pregnancy | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 79 | issue = 4| pages = 269–75 | doi=10.1034/j.1600-0412.2000.079004269.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hansen A, Jensen DV, Larsen E, Wilken-Jensen C, Petersen LK | date = Mar 1996 | title = Relaxin is not related to symptom-giving pelvic girdle relaxation in pregnant women | url = | journal = Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand | volume = 75 | issue = 3| pages = 245–9 | doi=10.3109/00016349609047095}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Albert H, Godskesen M, Westergaard JG, Chard T, Gunn L | date = Jul 1997 | title = Circulating levels of relaxin are normal in pregnant women with pelvic pain | url = | journal = Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. | volume = 74 | issue = 1| pages = 19–22 | doi=10.1016/s0301-2115(97)00076-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gait changes===
The pregnant woman has a different pattern of "[[Gait analysis|gait]]". The step lengthens as the pregnancy progresses due to weight gain and changes in posture. Both the length and height of the footstep shortens with PGP. Sometimes the foot can turn inwards due to the rotation of the hips when the pelvic joints are unstable. On average, a woman's foot can grow by a half size or more during pregnancy. Pregnancy hormones that are released to adapt the bodily changes also remodel the ligaments in the foot. In addition, the increased body weight of pregnancy, fluid retention and weight gain lowers the arches, further adding to the foot's length and width. There is an increase of load on the lateral side of the foot and the hind foot. These changes may also be responsible for the musculoskeletal complaints of lower limb pain in pregnant women.

During the motion of walking, an upward movement of the pelvis, one side then the other, is required to let the leg follow through. The faster or longer each step the pelvis adjusts accordingly. The flexibility within the knees, ankles and hips are stabilized by the pelvis. Normal gait tends to minimize displacement of centre of gravity whereas abnormal gait through pelvic instability tends to amplify displacement. During pregnancy there may be an increased demand placed on hip abductor, hip extensor, and [[Ankle|ankle plantar flexor muscles]] during walking. To avoid pain on weight bearing structures a very short stance phase and limp occurs on the injured side(s), this is called [[Gait abnormality|Antalgic Gait]].

==Treatment==
A number of treatments have some evidence for benefits include an exercise program.&lt;ref name=Ver2013/&gt; [[Paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) has not been found effective but is safe.&lt;ref name=Ver2013/&gt; [[NSAID]]s are sometimes effective but should not be used after 30 weeks of pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Ver2013/&gt; There is tentative evidence for [[acupuncture]].&lt;ref name=Ver2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Verstraete|first1=EH|last2=Vanderstraeten|first2=G|last3=Parewijck|first3=W|title=Pelvic Girdle Pain during or after Pregnancy: a review of recent evidence and a clinical care path proposal.|journal=Facts, views &amp; vision in ObGyn|date=2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=33–43|pmid=24753927|pmc=3987347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pelvic joint trauma will not respond to conservative type treatments and [[orthopedic surgery]] might become the only option to stabilize the joints.

==Prognosis and epidemiology==
For most women, PGP resolves in weeks after delivery but for some it can last for years resulting in a reduced tolerance for [[weight bearing]] activities. PGP can take from 11 weeks, 6 months or even up to 2 years postpartum to subside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Larsen EC, Wilken-Jensen C, Hansen A, Jensen DV, Johansen S, Minck H, Wormslev M, Davidsen M, Hansen TM | date = Feb 1999 | title = Symptom-Giving Pelvic Girdle Relaxation in Pregnancy.

Overall, about 45% of all pregnant women and 25% of all women postpartum suffer from PGP.&lt;ref&gt;W. H. Wu, O. G. Meijer, K. Uegaki, J. M. A. Mens, J. H. van Dieën, P. I. J. M. Wuisman, H. C.

A '''schema''' is a template in [[computer science]] used in the field of [[genetic algorithm]]s that identifies a [[subset]] of strings with similarities at certain string positions. Schemata are a special case of [[cylinder set]]s; and so form a [[topological space]].&lt;ref name="Holland1"&gt;{{cite book |title=Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems|year=1992|edition=reprint|publisher=The MIT Press|author=Holland, John Henry |isbn=9780472084609 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_sys.html?id=JE5RAAAAMAAJ |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
For example, consider binary strings of length 6. The schema 1**0*1 describes the set of all words of length 6 with 1's at the first and sixth positions and a 0 at the fourth position. The * is a [[Wildcard character|wildcard]] symbol, which means that positions 2, 3 and 5 can have a value of either 1 or 0. The ''order of a schema'' is defined as the number of fixed positions in the template, while the ''[[defining length]]'' &lt;math&gt; \delta(H) &lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the first and last specific positions. The order of 1**0*1 is 3 and its defining length is 5. The ''fitness of a schema'' is the average fitness of all strings matching the schema. The fitness of a string is a measure of the value of the encoded problem solution, as computed by a problem-specific evaluation function.

===Length===
The length of a schema &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, called &lt;math&gt;N(H)&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as the total number of nodes in the schema. &lt;math&gt;N(H)&lt;/math&gt; is also equal to the number of nodes in the programs matching &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="UCL1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundations of Genetic Programming|url=http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/W.Langdon/FOGP/|publisher=UCL UK|accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disruption===
If the child of an individual that matches schema H does not ''itself'' match H, the schema is said to have been ''disrupted''.&lt;ref name="UCL1" /&gt;

==Propagation of schema==
In [[evolutionary computing]] such as [[genetic algorithms]] and [[genetic programming]], '''propagation''' refers to the inheritance of characteristics of one generation by the next. For example, a schema is propagated if individuals in the current generation match it and so do those in the next generation. Those in the next generation may be (but don't have to be) children of parents who matched it.

== The Expansion and Compression Operators ==
Recently schema have been studied using [[order theory]].&lt;ref name = "Fletcher"&gt;
{{cite arxiv |author=Jack McKay Fletcher and Thomas Wennkers |year=2017 |title=A natural approach to studying schema processing |eprint=1705.04536|class=cs.NE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two basic operators are defined for schema: expansion and compression. The expansion maps a schema onto a set of words which it represents, while the compression maps a set of words on to a schema.

In the following definitions &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; denotes an alphabet, &lt;math&gt; \Sigma^l &lt;/math&gt; denotes all words of length &lt;math&gt; l &lt;/math&gt; over the alphabet &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \Sigma_* &lt;/math&gt; denotes the alphabet &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; with the extra symbol &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_*^l&lt;/math&gt; denotes all schema of length &lt;math&gt; l &lt;/math&gt; over the alphabet &lt;math&gt; \Sigma_* &lt;/math&gt; as well as the empty schema &lt;math&gt; \epsilon_* &lt;/math&gt;.
 
For any schema &lt;math&gt;s \in \Sigma^l_*&lt;/math&gt;  the following operator &lt;math&gt;{\uparrow}s&lt;/math&gt;, called the &lt;math&gt;expansion&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, which maps &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; to a subset of words in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^l &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math display="block"&gt;{\uparrow}s := \{b \in \Sigma^l | b_i = s_i \mbox{ or } s_i = * \mbox{ for each }  i \in \{1,...,l\}\} &lt;/math&gt;

Where subscript &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; denotes the character at position &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in a word or schema.  When &lt;math&gt; s= \epsilon_*&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;{\uparrow}s  = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;.  More simply put, &lt;math&gt;{\uparrow}s&lt;/math&gt; is the set of all words in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^l&lt;/math&gt; that can be made by exchanging the &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; symbols in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; with symbols from &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if &lt;math&gt;\Sigma=\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;l=3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;s=10*&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;{\uparrow}s=\{100,101\} &lt;/math&gt;.

Conversely, for any &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \Sigma^l&lt;/math&gt; we define &lt;math&gt;{\downarrow}{A}&lt;/math&gt;, called the &lt;math&gt;compression&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,  which maps &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; on to a schema &lt;math&gt;s\in \Sigma_*^l&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math display="block"&gt;{\downarrow}A:= s&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a schema of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; such that the symbol at position &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is determined in the following way: if &lt;math&gt;x_i = y_i&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x,y \in A&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;s_i = x_i&lt;/math&gt; otherwise &lt;math&gt;s_i = *&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;A = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;{\downarrow}A = \epsilon_*&lt;/math&gt;. One can think of this operator as stacking up all the items in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and if all elements in a column are equivalent, the symbol at that position in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; takes this value, otherwise there is a wild card symbol. For example, let &lt;math&gt;A = \{100,000,010\}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;{\downarrow}A = **0&lt;/math&gt;.

Schemata can be [[partially ordered]]. For any &lt;math&gt;a,b \in \Sigma^l_*&lt;/math&gt; we say &lt;math&gt;a \leq b&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;{\uparrow}a \subseteq {\uparrow}b&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; is a [[partial ordering]] on a set of schemata from the [[reflexive operator algebra|reflexivity]], [[antisymmetry]] and [[transitive relation|transitivity]] of the [[subset]] relation. For example, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_* \leq 11 \leq 1* \leq **&lt;/math&gt;.
This is because &lt;math&gt;{\uparrow}\epsilon_* \subseteq {\uparrow}11 \subseteq {\uparrow}1* \subseteq {\uparrow}** = \emptyset \subseteq \{11\} \subseteq \{11,10\} \subseteq \{11,10,01,00\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The compression and expansion operators form a [[Galois connection]], where &lt;math&gt;\downarrow&lt;/math&gt; is the lower adjoint and &lt;math&gt;\uparrow&lt;/math&gt; the upper adjoint.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"/&gt;

== The Schematic Completion and The Schematic Lattice ==
For a set &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \Sigma^l&lt;/math&gt;, we call the process of calculating the compression on each subset of A, that is &lt;math&gt;\{{\downarrow}X | X \subseteq A\}&lt;/math&gt;, the schematic completion of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(A)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"/&gt;

For example, let &lt;math&gt;A = \{110, 100, 001, 000\}&lt;/math&gt;. The schematic completion of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;,  results in the following set: 
&lt;math display="block"&gt;\mathcal{S}(A) =

\{001, 100, 000, 110, 00*, *00, 1*0, **0, *0*, ***, \epsilon_*\}&lt;/math&gt;

The [[poset]] &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{S}(A),\leq)&lt;/math&gt; always forms a [[complete lattice]] called the schematic lattice. 
[[File:Schematic Lattice.png|thumb|The Schematic lattice formed from the schematic completion on the set &lt;math&gt;A=\{111, 011, 001\}&lt;/math&gt;. Here the schematic lattice &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{S}(A),\leq)&lt;/math&gt; is shown as a [[Hasse diagram]]. 
]]

The schematic lattice is similar to the concept lattice found in [[Formal concept analysis]].

'''Sinbad'''  (c. 1937 &amp;ndash; 30 December 1951) was a mixed-breed dog that was one of two animals to be classified as non-commissioned officers by an arm of the United States military, rather than property, prior to the enactment of regulations to prohibit such (the other being [[Sergeant Stubby]] USA, WWI) after being enlisted by the creative crew of {{USCGC|Campbell|WPG-32|6}}. Prior to and after an official retirement, Sinbad was assigned the rank of K9C or "Chief Dog" - equivalent to Chief Petty Officer. At the time of the biography written by George Foley, no other member of the [[United States Coast Guard]] had yet been the subject of a published biography. Sinbad spent 11 years at sea on the ''Campbell'' including combat in [[World War II]] that became widely publicized as part of the homefront campaign.

== Coming aboard ==
Sinbad's birth is not recorded, but he was obtained by [[Chief Petty Officer|Chief Boatswain's Mate]] A. A. "Blackie" Rother of the USCGC ''George W. Campbell'', who intended the dog as a gift for a girlfriend. She did not take him in due to a restriction against pets in her apartment building, leaving Rother with him as he returned from liberty in 1937.&lt;ref name=CGCVA100&gt;CGCVA, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Foley5&gt;Foley, p 5&lt;/ref&gt; No crewman would take the dog, leaving him a stray without an owner, but most wanted him to remain on board.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, P.20&lt;/ref&gt; To justify enlistment, thereby eliminating the need for a master, the crew said that Sinbad displayed the attributes of a sailor by drinking coffee,&lt;ref name=Foley21&gt;Foley, p 21&lt;/ref&gt; whiskey with beer chasers at port bars,&lt;ref name=USCG01&gt;Dumas, Joe; "SINBAD, USCG (Ret.), K9C (Chief Petty Officer, Dog)",Frequently Asked Questions, U.S. Coast Guard Historian's Office&lt;/ref&gt; having regular and [[general quarters]] [[duty station]]s, and generally demonstrating seamanship.&lt;ref name=Foley(2)32&gt;Foley(2), p.32&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Coast Guard and several published articles, he was enlisted into the service with his pawprint on enlistment papers.&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt; As Foley notes, Sinbad was assigned his own service and [[Red Cross]] identification numbers,&lt;ref name=Foley86&gt;Foley p 86&lt;/ref&gt; service record, and bunk. He was also recorded as a member of the Society of Polar Explorers.&lt;ref name=Foley(2)8&gt;Foley(2), p 8&lt;/ref&gt; Being prone to the indiscretions of both a canine and a sailor, Sinbad was subject to [[Captains Mast]] on two occasions,&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt; and was promoted and demoted in rank on several occasions.&lt;ref name=Foley118&gt;Foley, p 118&lt;/ref&gt; Sinbad ended his time at sea with the rank K9C Chief Dog and commensurate pay rate.&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foley cover notes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barnegat Light Museum display on Sinbad&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karch, Mary, Sinbad at Barnegat, http://www.mikewalling.com/books/barnegat.shtml and also several references in Foley to Sinbad's pay&lt;/ref&gt;

== Presence in combat ==
Sinbad was aboard ''Campbell'' throughout World War II while the cutter was assigned to convoy escort duty in the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; Although publicity photos depicted Sinbad standing helmeted on the barrel of a large gun, he actually stayed below decks  with a general quarters duty post "assigned to damage control", keeping him away from the sound of gunfire.&lt;ref name=Foley79&gt;Foley, p 79&lt;/ref&gt;

''Campbell''{{'}}s most significant action involved combat with, and sinking by ramming of, the [[German submarine]] ''U-606''.&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt; &lt;ref Name=Foley101-105&gt;Foley pp 101-105&lt;/ref&gt; After the cutter suffered severe damage, becoming disabled and without power due to flooding,&lt;ref name=Foley105&gt;Foley, p 105&lt;/ref&gt; "essential crew"  were left aboard the otherwise evacuated ship to keep it afloat as it was towed to [[Canada]] for repair, and Sinbad travelled with them. Crew members later stated to the media that Captain James Hirschfield believed that nothing could befall the ship if Sinbad remained aboard.&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Foley106&gt;Foley, p 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Foley(2)34&gt;Foley(2), p 34&lt;/ref&gt;  A statue of Sinbad is on the mess deck of current "Famous-class" medium endurance cutter {{USCGC|Campbell|WMEC-909|}},&lt;ref name="CGCVA100" /&gt; successor to the preceding ''Campbell''.

Sinbad was aboard during other anti-submarine warfare and strafing attacks by enemy aircraft.&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt;

While less decorated than the ship on which he was present during the war, Sinbad was awarded the following service ribbons: [[American Defense Service Medal]], [[American Campaign Medal]], [[European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal|European-African-MiddleEastern Campaign Medal]], [[Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal]], [[World War II Victory Medal]] and [[Navy Occupation Service Medal]],&lt;ref name="CGCVA100" /&gt; which were attached to Sinbad's collar.&lt;ref&gt;USCG Publicity photo, USCG Archives, apx. 1946&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Painting of Sinbad with ribboned collar, Barnegat Light Museum, viewable online at http://www.bl-hs.org/images/Sinbad.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

==Public relations==
[[File:Sinbad on Campbell.jpg|thumb|left|Sinbad and crewmates, 1943]]
Sinbad became a public figure through media attention first accumulated through his presence in bars in ports of call. He also frequented Red Cross facilities such as his alleged favorite in [[Londonderry Port|Londonderry]], where he was also the guest of honor at a dinner in [[Guildhall, Derry|Guild Hall]].

[[File:Sinbad Statue on 909.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Statue on the mess deck of the [[USCGC Campbell (WMEC-909)|USCGC ‘’Campbell’’ (WMEC-909)]]]]
[[File:Signed copy of Sinbad.jpg|thumb|right|Autographed copy of George Foley's ''Sinbad of the Coast Guard'' from the book signing tour]]

New York papers featured the story of the clash with ''U-606'', though without photographs as Sinbad was sequestered below after a night on the town.&lt;ref&gt;Foley, p.108&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]''{{'}}s Martin Sheridan described him in a December 1943 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine story as "liberty-rum-chow-hound, with a bit of bulldog, doberman pinscher, and what-not. Mostly what-not", which appealed to blue collar and farm town America.

Photo sessions and network news interviews when the ''Campbell'' was in port served the home-front morale effort and gave Sinbad nationwide recognition. His celebrity further increased following the end of the war and the publication of George F. Foley's ''Sinbad of the Coast Guard'', whose book-signing tour Sinbad accompanied.&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt;

As both a dog and sailor, Sinbad was not immune to causing trouble in port towns where the crew went on liberty, and was not always cooperative at public relations events. He was the subject of formal complaints called "diplomatic incidents" in [[Casablanca]] and [[Greenland]].&lt;ref name="CGCVA100" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt;

==Retirement==
After spending 11 years with the ''Campbell''{{'}}s crew, mostly at sea, Sinbad was taken ashore at the [[Barnegat Lighthouse|Barnegat Light]] station in New Jersey,&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt; and listed as honorably discharged from the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] on 21 September 1948,&lt;ref name="CGCVA100" /&gt; and on "inactive duty". Once described by ''Life'' magazine as "an old sea dog [who] has favorite bars and plenty of girls in every port",&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt; Sinbad lived another three years quietly ashore, frequenting Kubel's bar on Seventh (the only bar) in [[Barnegat Light, New Jersey|Barnegat Light]]&lt;ref&gt;Karch, Mary, Under the Lighthouse - Memories of Barnegat City, Down the shore publishing, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;photos of Sinbad on the steps and at the bar, Barnegat Light Museum collection&lt;/ref&gt; and looking out to sea from the station.&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt;

Sinbad was also long known for playing with a metal [[washer (hardware)|washer]] that he balanced on his nose,&lt;ref&gt;Foley, multiple pages&lt;/ref&gt; tossed in the air, and caught.  A statue of Sinbad is on the mess deck of current "Famous-class" medium endurance cutter {{USCGC|Campbell|WMEC-909|}},&lt;ref name="CGCVA100" /&gt; successor to the preceding ''Campbell''. Lacking any oversized washers, or a large engine room crew Foley dubbed "the black gang" in reference to the soot and oil of their jobs to provide one, the statue instead balances a rawhide bone. The public affairs officer for ''Campbell'', Ensign John Jeffares, wrote in 2011 in reference to their statue deemed in part to protect the ship vis-à-vis the belief attributed to Captain Hirschfield that "here on board we have our own special tradition. Sinbad's statue as well as his bone (as seen pictured on his nose) is considered off limits. Any personnel other than chief petty officers (Sinbad's rank while he was a crewmember onboard) who touch the statue and his bone are said to be stricken with bad luck... you just don't touch it."

Sinbad died on 30 December 1951 and was buried beneath a granite monument at the base of the light station's flagpole.&lt;ref name="CGCVA100" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USCG01" /&gt; The decommissioned station has since become the emergency operations center for the Borough of [[Barnegat Light, New Jersey]].

'''Solipsism''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-ncalif-solipsism.ogg|ˈ|s|ɒ|l|ᵻ|p|s|ɪ|z|əm}}; {{ety|la|solus|alone||ipse|self}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=solipsism|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[philosophy|philosophical]] idea that only one's own [[mind]] is sure to exist. As an [[epistemology|epistemological]] position, solipsism holds that [[knowledge]] of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the [[Philosophical skepticism|external world]] and [[problem of other minds|other minds]] cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind. As a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] position, solipsism goes further to the conclusion that the world and other minds do not exist.

==Varieties==
There are varying degrees of solipsism that parallel the varying degrees of [[skepticism]]:

===Metaphysical solipsism===
{{Main article|Metaphysical solipsism}}

[[Metaphysical]] solipsism is a variety of solipsism. Based on a philosophy of [[subjective idealism]], metaphysical solipsists maintain that the [[self]] is the only existing reality and that all other realities, including the external [[World (philosophy)|world]] and other persons, are representations of that self, and have no independent existence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} There are several versions of metaphysical solipsism, such as Caspar Hare's [[egocentric presentism]] (or [[perspectival realism]]), in which other people are conscious, but their experiences are simply not ''present''.{{citation needed|date=June 2017|reason=can we refer to his work?}}

===Epistemological solipsism===
{{Further information|Epistemological solipsism}}
Epistemological solipsism is the variety of [[idealism]] according to which only the directly accessible mental contents of the solipsistic philosopher can be known. The existence of an external world is regarded as an unresolvable question rather than actually false.&lt;ref name="maar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maartens.home.xs4all.nl/philosophy/Dictionary/S/Solipsism.htm|title=Philosophical Dictionary:Solipsism|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170103023018/https://maartens.home.xs4all.nl/philosophy/Dictionary/S/Solipsism.htm|archivedate=3 January 2017|accessdate=8 April 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, one cannot also be certain as to what extent the external world exists independently of one's mind. For instance, it may be that a God-like being controls the sensations received by one's brain, making it appear as if there is an external world when most of it (excluding the God-like being and oneself) is false. However, the point remains that epistemological solipsists consider this an "unresolvable" question.&lt;ref name="maar"/&gt;

===Methodological solipsism===
{{Main article|Methodological solipsism}}

Methodological solipsism is an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] variant of solipsism.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} It exists in opposition to the strict [[Epistemology|epistemological]] requirements for "[[knowledge]]" (''e.g.'' the requirement that knowledge must be certain). It still entertains the points that [[Problem of induction|any induction is fallible]]. Methodological solipsism sometimes goes even further to say that even what we perceive as the brain is actually part of the external world, for it is only through our senses that we can see or feel the mind. Only the existence of [[thoughts]] is known for certain.

Importantly, methodological solipsists do not intend to conclude that the stronger forms of solipsism are actually true. They simply emphasize that justifications of an external world must be founded on indisputable facts about their own consciousness. The methodological solipsist believes that subjective impressions ([[empiricism]]) or innate knowledge ([[rationalism]]) are the sole possible or proper starting point for philosophical construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|last=Wood
|first=Ledger
|title=Dictionary of Philosophy
|year=1962
|publisher=Totowa, NJ: Littlefield, Adams, and Company
|pages=295
}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Often methodological solipsism is not held as a belief system, but rather used as a [[thought experiment]] to assist [[skepticism]] (''e.g.'' Descartes' [[cartesian skepticism]]).{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Main points==
Denial of material existence, in itself, does not constitute solipsism.

A feature of the metaphysical solipsistic [[worldview]] is [[Problem of other minds|the denial of the existence of other minds]]. Since [[qualia|personal experiences]] are private and [[Ineffability|ineffable]], another being's experience can be known only by [[analogy]].

Philosophers try to build knowledge on more than an inference or analogy. The failure of [[Descartes]]' epistemological enterprise brought to popularity the idea that all [[Certainty|certain]] knowledge may go no further than ''[[cogito ergo sum|"I think; therefore I exist"]]''&lt;ref name="IEP"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/s/solipsis.htm#H1 | work = [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | title = Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds | first = Stephen P. | last = Thornton | date = 24 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; without providing any real details about the nature of the "I" that has been proven to exist.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The theory of solipsism also merits close examination because it relates to three widely held philosophical presuppositions, each itself fundamental and wide-ranging in importance:&lt;ref name="IEP" /&gt;

# My most certain knowledge is the content of my own mind—''my'' [[thoughts]], experiences, affects, etc.
# There is no conceptual or logically necessary link between mental and physical—between, say, the occurrence of certain conscious experience or mental states and the 'possession' and behavioral dispositions of a 'body' of a particular kind.
# The experience of a given person is ''necessarily'' private to that person.

To expand on point 2 a little further, the conceptual problem here is that the previous assumes [[mind]] or [[consciousness]] (which are attributes) can exist independent of some entity having this capability, i.e., that an attribute of an existent can exist apart from the existent itself. If one admits to the existence of an independent entity (e.g., your brain) having that attribute, the door is open.{{cn|date=November 2018}} (See the [[Brain in a vat]].)

Some people hold that, while it cannot be proven that anything independent of one's mind exists, the point that solipsism makes is irrelevant. This is because, whether the world as we perceive it exists independently or not, we cannot escape this perception (except via death), hence it is best to act assuming that the world is independent of our minds.&lt;ref name="guardian1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-24820,00.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605061325/http://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-24820,00.html|archivedate=5 June 2016|title=Is there a convincing philosophical rebuttal to solipsism - See comment by Seth, Edinburgh Scotland|accessdate=8 April 2017|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if one committed a crime, one is likely to be punished, causing potential distress to oneself even if the world was not independent of one's mind; therefore, it is in one's best interests and is most convenient to assume the world exists independently of one's mind.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

There is also the issue of plausibility to consider. If one is the only mind in existence, then one is maintaining that one's mind alone created all of which one is apparently aware. This includes the symphonies of [[Beethoven]], the works of [[Shakespeare]], all of mathematics and science (which one can access via one's phantom libraries), etc. Critics of solipsism find this somewhat implausible. However, since, for example, people are able to construct entire worlds inside their minds while having dreams when asleep, and people have had dreams which included things such as music of Beethoven or the works of Shakespeare or math or science in them, solipsists do have counter-arguments to justify their views being plausible.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

Solipsism was first recorded by the Greek [[presocratic]] [[sophist]], [[Gorgias]] (c. 483–375 BC) who is quoted by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[sceptic]] [[Sextus Empiricus]] as having stated:&lt;ref name="Craig(Firm)1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Edward Craig|author2=Routledge (Firm)|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Genealogy to Iqbal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5m5z_ca-qDkC&amp;pg=PA146|accessdate=16 October 2010|year=1998|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis US|isbn=978-0-415-18709-1|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Nothing exists.
# Even if something exists, nothing can be known about it.
# Even if something could be known about it, knowledge about it can't be communicated to others.

Much of the point of the Sophists was to show that "objective" knowledge was a literal impossibility. (See also comments credited to [[Protagoras|Protagoras of Abdera]]).

===Descartes===
The foundations of solipsism are in turn the foundations of the view that the individual's understanding of any and all psychological concepts ([[thinking]], [[volition (psychology)|willing]], [[perceiving]], etc.) is accomplished by making an [[analogy]] with his or her own mental states; ''i.e.'', by [[abstraction]] from ''inner experience''. And this view, or some variant of it, has been influential in philosophy since [[René Descartes|Descartes]] elevated the search for incontrovertible certainty to the status of the ''primary goal'' of [[epistemology]], whilst also elevating epistemology to "first philosophy".{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

===Berkeley===
[[File:John Smibert - Bishop George Berkeley - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[George Berkeley]] by [[John Smybert]], 1727]]
[[George Berkeley]]'s arguments against [[materialism]] in favour of [[idealism]] provide the solipsist with a number of arguments not found in Descartes. While Descartes defends ontological [[mind-body dualism|dualism]], thus accepting the existence of a material world ([[res extensa]]) as well as immaterial minds ([[res cogitans]]) and God, Berkeley denies the existence of matter but not minds, of which God is one.&lt;ref name="Jones2009"&gt;{{cite book |first=N. |last=Jones |first2=G. |last2=Berkeley |year=2009 |title=Starting with Berkeley |series=Starting with |publisher=Continuum |isbn=978-1-84706-186-7 |lccn=2008053026 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G6ukEYxbW5UC&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;pg=PA105 |page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other ideas==

===Idealism and materialism===
One of the most fundamental debates in philosophy concerns the "true" nature of the world—whether it is some ethereal plane of ideas or a reality of atomic particles and energy. [[Materialism]]&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Materialism}}&lt;/ref&gt; posits a real 'world out there,' as well as in and through us, that can be sensed—seen, heard, tasted, touched and felt, sometimes with prosthetic technologies corresponding to human sensing organs. (Materialists do not claim that human senses or even their prosthetics can, even when collected, sense the totality of the 'universe'; simply that what they collectively cannot sense cannot in any way be known to us.)

Materialists do not find this a useful way of thinking about the [[ontology]] and [[ontogeny]] of ideas, but we might say that from a materialist perspective pushed to a logical extreme communicable to an idealist (an "Away Team" perspective), ideas are ultimately reducible to a physically communicated, organically, socially and environmentally embedded 'brain state'. While reflexive existence is not considered by materialists to be experienced on the atomic level, the individual's physical and mental experiences are ultimately reducible to the unique tripartite combination of environmentally determined, genetically determined, and randomly determined interactions of firing [[neurons]] and atomic collisions.

As a correlative, the only thing that [[dreams]] and [[hallucinations]] prove are that some neurons can reorganize and 'clean house' 'on break' (often reforming according to emergent, prominent, or uncanny cultural themes), misfire, and malfunction. But for materialists, ideas have no primary reality as essences separate from our physical existence. From a materialist "Home Team" perspective, ideas are also social (rather than purely biological), and formed and transmitted and modified through the interactions between social organisms and their social and physical environments. This materialist perspective informs scientific methodology, insofar as that [[methodology]] assumes that humans have no access to [[omniscience]] and that therefore human knowledge is an ongoing, collective enterprise that is best produced via [[scientific]] and [[logical]] conventions adjusted specifically for material human capacities and limitations.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Modern [[Idealism|Idealists]], on the other hand, believe that the mind and its thoughts are the only true things that exist. This is the reverse of what is sometimes called [[classical idealism]] or, somewhat confusingly, [[Platonic idealism]] due to the influence of Plato's [[Theory of Forms]] (εἶδος ''eidos'' or ἰδέα ''idea'') which were not products of our thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Idealism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material world is [[ephemeral]], but a perfect triangle or "beauty" is eternal. Religious thinking tends to be some form of idealism, as God usually becomes the highest ideal (such as [[Neoplatonism]]).&lt;ref name="Catholic Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sullivan-county.com/id3/neoplatonism.htm | title = Notes on Neoplatonism and the relation to Christianity and Gnosticism | first = Lewis | last = Loflin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/g/germidea.htm | work = [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | title = German Idealism | date = 16 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this scale, solipsism can be classed as [[idealism]]. Thoughts and concepts are all that exist, and furthermore, only the solipsist's own thoughts and consciousness exist. The so-called "reality" is nothing more than an idea that the solipsist has (perhaps unconsciously) created.

===Cartesian dualism===
There is another option: the belief that both ideals and "reality" exist. [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualists]] commonly argue that the distinction between the [[mind]] (or '[[idea]]s') and matter can be proven by employing [[Leibniz|Leibniz']] principle of the ''[[identity of indiscernibles]]'' which states that if two things share exactly the same qualities, then they must be identical, as in indistinguishable from each other and therefore one and the same thing. Dualists then attempt to identify attributes of mind that are lacked by matter (such as privacy or intentionality) or vice versa (such as having a certain temperature or electrical charge).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.newdualism.org/papers/J.DePoe/dualism.htm | title = A Defense of Dualism | first = John M | last = DePoe | work = New Dualism Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Dualism}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable application of the [[identity of indiscernibles]] was by [[René Descartes]] in his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''. Descartes concluded that he could not doubt the existence of ''himself'' (the famous ''[[cogito ergo sum]]'' argument), but that he ''could'' doubt the (separate) existence of ''his'' body. From this, he inferred that the ''person Descartes'' must not be identical to ''the Descartes body'' since one possessed a characteristic that the other did not: namely, it could be known to exist. Solipsism agrees with Descartes in this aspect, and goes further: only things that can be known to exist for sure should be considered to exist. ''The Descartes body'' could only exist as an idea in the mind of the ''person Descartes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/d/dualism.htm | work = [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | title = Dualism and Mind | first = Scott | last = Calef | date = 9 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iep.utm.edu/s/solipsis.htm | work = [[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] | title = Solipsism and the Problem of Other Minds | first = Stephen P. | last = Thornton | date = 24 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Descartes and dualism aim to prove the actual existence of reality as opposed to a phantom existence (as well as the existence of God in Descartes' case), using the realm of ideas merely as a starting point, but solipsism usually finds those further arguments unconvincing. The solipsist instead proposes that his/her own unconscious is the author of all seemingly "external" events from "reality".

===Philosophy of Schopenhauer===
''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' is the central work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation, the Kantian [[thing-in-itself]]. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by [[analogy]] as the relationship between human will and human body.

===Idealism===
The idealist philosopher [[George Berkeley]] argued that physical objects do not exist independently of the mind that perceives them. An item truly exists only as long as it is observed; otherwise, it is not only meaningless but simply nonexistent. The observer and the observed are one. Berkeley does attempt to show things can and do exist apart from the human mind and our perception, but only because there is an all-encompassing Mind in which all "ideas" are perceived&amp;nbsp;– in other words, God, who observes all. Solipsism agrees that nothing exists outside of perception, but would argue that Berkeley falls prey to the [[egocentric predicament]]&amp;nbsp;– he can only make his own observations, and thus cannot be truly sure that this God or other people exist to observe "reality". The solipsist would say it is better to disregard the unreliable observations of alleged other people and rely upon the immediate certainty of one's own perceptions.&lt;ref name="Berkeley"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Subjectivism and Solipsism | first = D.R. | last = Khashaba | journal = [[Philosophy Pathways]] | issue = 37 | date = 28 July 2002 | url = http://www.philosophypathways.com/newsletter/issue37.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationalism===
[[Rationalism]] is the philosophical position that [[truth]] is best discovered by the use of reasoning and [[logic]] rather than by the use of the senses (see Plato's [[theory of Forms]]). Solipsism is also skeptical of [[sense-data]].

===Philosophical zombie===
The theory of solipsism crosses over with the theory of the [[philosophical zombie]] in that all other seemingly conscious beings actually lack true [[consciousness]], instead they only display traits of consciousness to the observer, who is the only conscious being there is.

===Falsifiability and testability===
Solipsism is not a [[falsifiable]] hypothesis as described by [[Karl Popper]] or [[Imre Lakatos]]: there does not seem to be an imaginable disproof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Popper|first1=Karl|title=Knowledge and the body-mind problem: in defence of interaction|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-13556-7|page=106|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One critical test is nevertheless to consider the induction from experience that the externally observable world does not seem, at first approach, to be directly manipulable purely by mental energies alone. One can indirectly manipulate the world through the medium of the physical body, but it seems impossible to do so through pure thought (''e.g.'' via [[psychokinesis]]). It might be argued that if the external world were merely a construct of a single consciousness, ''i.e.'' the self, it could then follow that the external world should be somehow directly manipulable by that consciousness, and if it is not, then solipsism is false. An argument against this states the notion that such manipulation may be possible but barred from the conscious self via the subconscious self, a 'locked' portion of the mind that is still nevertheless the same mind. [[Lucid dreaming]] might be considered an example of when these locked portions of the subconscious become accessible. An argument against this might be brought up in asking why the subconscious mind would be locked. Also, the access to the autonomous ('locked') portions of the mind during the lucid dreaming is obviously much different (for instance: is relatively more '''transient''') than the access to autonomous regions of the perceived nature.

The method of the typical scientist is materialist: they first assume that the external world exists and can be known. But the scientific method, in the sense of a predict-observe-modify loop, does not require the assumption of an external world. A solipsist may perform a psychological test on themselves, to discern the nature of the reality in their mind - however [[David Deutsch]] uses this fact to counter-argue: "outer parts" of solipsist, behave independently so they are independent for "narrowly" defined ('''conscious''') self.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, David. (1997) ''[[The Fabric of Reality|Fabric of Reality]]''&lt;/ref&gt; A solipsist's investigations may not be proper science, however, since it would not include the co-operative and communitarian aspects of scientific inquiry that normally serve to diminish bias.

===Minimalism===
Solipsism is a form of [[logical]] [[minimalism]]. Many people are intuitively unconvinced of the nonexistence of the external world from the basic arguments of solipsism, but a solid proof of its existence is not available at present. The central assertion of solipsism rests on the nonexistence of such a proof, and strong solipsism (as opposed to weak solipsism) asserts that no such proof can be made. In this sense, solipsism is logically related to [[agnosticism]] in religion: the distinction between believing you do not know, and believing you could not have known.

However, minimality (or parsimony) is not the only logical virtue. A common misapprehension of [[Occam's Razor]] has it that the simpler theory is always the best. In fact, the principle is that the simpler of two theories of ''equal [[explanatory power]]'' is to be preferred. In other words: additional "entities" can pay their way with enhanced explanatory power. So the realist can claim that, while his [[world view]] is more complex, it is more satisfying as an explanation.

===Solipsism in infants===
{{main|Infant cognitive development}}
Some [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologists]] believe that [[infant]]s are solipsistic, and that eventually children [[inference|infer]] that others have experiences much like theirs and reject solipsism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
The earliest reference to Solipsism in [[Hindu philosophy]] is found in the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], dated to early 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Early Advaita Vedānta and Buddhism: the Mahāyāna context of the Gauḍapādīya-kārikā|isbn=978-0-7914-2513-8|first1=Richard|last1=King|first2=Gauḍapāda|last2=Ācārya|page=52|year=1995|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Upanishad]] holds the mind to be the only god and all actions in the universe are thought to be a result of the mind assuming infinite forms.&lt;ref&gt;Krishnananda, (Swami). [http://www.swami-krishnananda.org/brdup/brhad_III-01a.html The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]. Divine Life Society, Rishikesh. P. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; After the development of distinct schools of [[Indian philosophy]], [[Advaita Vedanta]] and Samkhya schools are thought to have originated concepts similar to solipsism.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

====Advaita Vedanta====
[[Advaita]] is one of the six most known Hindu philosophical systems and literally means "[[Nondualism|non-duality]]". Its first great consolidator was [[Adi Shankaracharya]], who continued the work of some of the [[Upanishads|Upanishadic]] teachers, and that of his teacher's teacher [[Gaudapada]]. By using various arguments, such as the analysis of the three states of experience—wakefulness, dream, and deep sleep, he established the singular reality of [[Brahman]], in which Brahman, the universe and the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or the Self, were one and the same.
{{quote|One who sees everything as nothing but the Self, and the Self in everything one sees, such a seer withdraws from nothing.
''For the enlightened, all that exists is nothing but the Self,'' so how could any suffering or delusion continue for those who know this oneness?| ''[[Ishopanishad]]'': sloka 6, 7}}

The concept of the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Self]] in the philosophy of Advaita could be interpreted as solipsism. However, the [[transhuman]], theological implications of the Self in Advaita protect it from true solipsism as found in the west. Similarly, the [[Vedantic]] text [[Yogavasistha]], escapes charge of solipsism because the real "I" is thought to be nothing but the [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute whole]] looked at through a particular unique point of interest.&lt;ref&gt;O'Flaherty, Wendy Doniger. [https://books.google.com/books?id=vhNNrX3bmo4C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=solipsism+hinduism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pv_4T6KxLIX4rQfIn_jVBg&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=solipsism%20hinduism&amp;f=false Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities]. Universoty of Chicago, 1984. pp. 120–1. {{ISBN|0-226-61855-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita is also thought to strongly diverge from solipsism in that, the former is a system of exploration of one's mind in order to finally understand the nature of the self and attain complete knowledge. The unity of existence is said to be directly experienced and understood at the end as a part of complete knowledge. On the other hand, solipsism posits the non-existence of the external void right at the beginning, and says that no further inquiry is possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

====Samkhya and Yoga====
[[Samkhya]] philosophy, which is sometimes seen as the basis of [[Yogic]] thought,&lt;ref&gt;Radhankrishnan, Indian Philosophy, London, George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., 1971 edition, Volume II, p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; adopts a view that matter exists independently of individual minds. Representation of an object in an individual mind is held to be a mental approximation of the object in the external world.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac, J. R.; Dangwal, Ritu; Chakraborty, C. [https://books.google.com/books?id=V9Z0dFN3DN0C&amp;pg=PA339&amp;dq=Consciousness+matter+dualism+sankhya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=kmLnT_2sLtDMrQeN-_D3CA&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=Consciousness%20matter%20dualism%20sankhya&amp;f=false Proceedings. International conference on cognitive systems (1997)]. Allied Publishers Ltd. pp. 341–2. {{ISBN|81-7023-746-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Samkhya chooses representational [[Philosophical realism|realism]] over epistemological solipsism. Having established this distinction between the external world and the mind, Samkhya posits the existence of two metaphysical realities [[Prakriti]] (matter) and [[Purusha]] (consciousness).

===Buddhism===
Some misinterpretations of Buddhism assert that external reality is an [[illusion]], and sometimes this position is [mis]understood as metaphysical solipsism. [[Buddhist philosophy]], though, generally holds that the mind and external phenomena are both equally transient, and that they arise from each other. The mind cannot exist without external phenomena, nor can external phenomena exist without the mind. This relation is known as [[pratītyasamutpāda|"dependent arising"]] (''pratityasamutpada'').

The Buddha stated, "Within this fathom long body is the world, the origin of the world, the cessation of the world and the path leading to the cessation of the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html|title=Rohitassa Sutta: To Rohitassa|author=|date=|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst not rejecting the occurrence of external phenomena, the Buddha focused on the illusion created within the mind of the perceiver by the process of ascribing permanence to impermanent phenomena, satisfaction to unsatisfying experiences, and a sense of reality to things that were effectively insubstantial.

[[Mahayana]] Buddhism also challenges as illusion the idea that one can experience an 'objective' reality independent of individual perceiving minds.

From the standpoint of [[Prasangika]] (a branch of [[Madhyamaka]] thought), external objects do exist, but are devoid of any type of inherent identity: "Just as objects of mind do not exist [inherently], mind also does not exist [inherently]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Chandrakirti]], ''Guide to the Middle Way'' 6:71cd, translation in ''Ocean of Nectar: Wisdom and Compassion in Mahayana Buddhism'', London: Tharpa Publications, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, even though a chair may physically exist, individuals can only experience it through the medium of their own mind, each with their own literal point of view. Therefore, an independent, purely 'objective' reality could never be experienced.

The [[Yogacara]] (sometimes translated as "Mind only") school of Buddhist philosophy contends that all human experience is constructed by mind. Some later representatives of one Yogacara subschool (Prajnakaragupta, [[Ratnakīrti]]) propounded a form of idealism that has been interpreted as solipsism. A view of this sort is contained in the 11th-century treatise of Ratnakirti,  ''"Refutation of the existence of other minds"'' (''Santanantara dusana''), which provides a philosophical refutation of external [[Mind Stream|mind-streams]] from the Buddhist standpoint of [[Paramārtha-satya|ultimate truth]] (as distinct from the perspective of everyday reality).&lt;ref name="McDermott-2013"&gt;{{cite book| title=An Eleventh-Century Buddhist Logic of 'Exists': Ratnakīrti’s Kṣaṇabhaṅgasiddhiḥ Vyatirekātmikā| series=Foundations of language|volume=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VC74CAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1| author=A. C. Senape McDermott|year=2013| publisher=Springer-Science Business Media| isbn=978-94-017-6322-6|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, the [[Bardo Thodol]], Tibet's famous book of the dead, repeatedly states that all of reality is a figment of one's perception, although this occurs within the "Bardo" realm (post-mortem). For instance, within the sixth part of the section titled "The Root Verses of the Six Bardos", there appears the following line: "May I recognize whatever appeareth as being mine own thought-forms";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://holybooks.lichtenbergpress.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Tibetan-Book-of-the-Dead.pdf?810c00|title=The Tibetan Book of the Dead Or the After-Death Experiences on the Bardo Plane|translator=Lāma Kazi Dawa-Samdup|publisher=holybooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are many lines in similar ideal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1196">'''Stochastic neural networks''' are a type of [[artificial neural networks]] built by introducing random variations into the network, either by giving the network's [[Artificial neuron|neurons]] [[Stochastic process|stochastic]] transfer functions, or by giving them stochastic weights.  This makes them useful tools for [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] problems, since the random fluctuations help it escape from [[Maxima and minima|local minima]].

An example of a neural network using stochastic transfer functions is a [[Boltzmann machine]]. Each neuron is binary valued, and the chance of it firing depends on the other neurons in the network.

Stochastic neural networks have found applications in risk management, oncology, bioinformatics, and other similar fields.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7054">'''Techniques of neutralization''' are a theoretical series of methods by which those who commit illegitimate acts temporarily neutralize certain values within themselves which would normally prohibit them from carrying out such acts, such as morality, obligation to abide by the law, and so on. In simpler terms, it is a psychological method for people to turn off "inner protests" when they do, or are about to do something they themselves perceive as wrong.

==The theory==

The idea of such techniques was first postulated by [[David Matza]] (born May 1, 1930) and [[Gresham Sykes]] (born 1922) during their work on [[Edwin Sutherland]]'s [[Differential association|Differential Association]] in the 1950s. While Matza and Sykes were at the time working on [[juvenile delinquency]], they theorized that the same techniques could be found throughout society and published their ideas in ''Delinquency and Drift'' 1964.&lt;ref&gt;http://home.comcast.net/~ddemelo/crime/sykes_matza.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Matza and Sykes' theory states that people are always aware of their [[moral obligation]] to abide by the law, and that they have the same moral obligation within themselves to avoid illegitimate acts. Thus, they reasoned, when a person did commit illegitimate acts, they must employ some sort of mechanism to silence the urge to follow these moral obligations.

This theory rejects other theories which suggested that groups containing delinquents have set up their own permanent moral code which completely replaces moral obligations. Thus, Matza and Sykes were able to explain how offenders 'drift' from illegitimate to legitimate lifestyles repeatedly, as they retain the moral code rather than wipe it clean to be replaced by a more illegitimate one as previous theories suggested.

==The techniques==

The theory was built up upon four observations:

* Delinquents express guilt over their illegal acts.
* Delinquents frequently respect and admire honest, law-abiding individuals.
* A line is drawn between those whom they can victimize and those they cannot.
* Delinquents are not immune to the demands of conformity.

These theories were brought from positivistic criminology which looked at epistemological perspectives of delinquency.

From these, Matza and Sykes created the following methods by which, they believed, delinquents justified their illegitimate actions:

* '''Denial of responsibility'''. The offender will propose that they were victims of circumstance or were forced into situations beyond their control.&lt;ref name="siegal"&gt;{{cite book |author=Siegal, Larry J.|year=2005 |title=Criminology: The Core Second Edition |publisher=Thompson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Denial of injury'''. The offender insists that their actions did not cause any harm or damage.&lt;ref name="siegal" /&gt;
* '''Denial of the victim'''. The offender believes that the victim deserved whatever action the offender committed.&lt;ref name="siegal" /&gt;
* '''Condemnation of the condemners'''. The offenders maintain that those who condemn their offense are doing so purely out of spite, or are shifting the blame off of themselves unfairly.&lt;ref name="siegal" /&gt;
* '''Appeal to higher loyalties.''' The offender suggests that his or her offense was for the greater good, with long term consequences that would justify their actions, such as protection of a friend.&lt;ref name="siegal" /&gt;

There are five methods of neutralization generally manifest themselves in the form of arguments, such as:

* "It wasn't my fault"
* "It wasn't a big deal. They could afford the loss"
* "They had it coming"
* "You were just as bad in your day"
* "My friends needed me. What was I going to do?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d.umn.edu/~jhamlin1/matza.html Techniques Of Neutralization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922111959/http://www.d.umn.edu/~jhamlin1/matza.html |date=2008-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Bryant et al. analysed statements made by 27 individuals accused of participation in the Rwanda genocide and found two neutralization techniques that had not been identified before:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=et al.|date=2017|title=Techniques of Neutralization and Identity Work Among   Accused Genocide Perpetrators|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c6f9/6396e11d17951df4b1d1b11a5444e948c46e.pdf|journal=Social Problems|volume=0|pages=1–19|doi=10.1093/socpro/spx026}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Appeal to good character.''' The offender will "assert their good deeds or admirable character attributes that they contend render them incapable of committing (genocidal) crimes".
* '''Victimisation.''' The offender will argue how she, he, people close to him or his ethnic group were under threat or have suffered loss by a third party (in case of the Rwanda genocide the Tutsi).

==Acceptance==

Further research in the theory has produced inconclusive results. Offenders have been found both with a solid belief in their moral obligations, and without. [[Travis Hirschi]], a [[Social Bonding Theory|social bond theorist]], also raised the question as to whether the offender develops these techniques to neutralise their qualms regarding offending ''before'' or ''after'' they actually commit the offence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/crime/sykes_ma.htm Sykes and Matza's Techniques of Neutralization (Drift Theory)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607141511/http://www.hewett.norfolk.sch.uk/CURRIC/soc/crime/sykes_ma.htm |date=June 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutralization Theory was introduced by Sykes and Matza in 1957, facing the then prevailing criminological wisdom that offenders engage in crime because they adhere to an oppositional subcultural rule set that values law breaking and violence, they rejected this perspective.  Subsequent research revealed that the original formulation of the Sykes and Matza's theory explains only the behavior of "conventionally attached individuals" not those  of "nonconventionally oriented individuals" such as "criminally embedded street offenders". Professor Volkan Topalli, at [[Georgia State University]], in his article ''The Seductive Nature of Autotelic Crime: How Neutralization Theory Serves as a Boundary Condition for Understanding Hardcore Street Offending'', explains that for those groups "guilt is not an issue at all because their crimes are not only considered acceptable, but attractive and desirable".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118587001/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 TOPALLI, Volkan, Prof. ''The Seductive Nature of Autotelic Crime: How Neutralization Theory Serves as a Boundary Condition for Understanding Hardcore Street Offending'', Digital Object Identifier  10.1111/j.1475-682X.2006.00167.x]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology assessment''' ('''TA''', German: {{lang|de|Technikfolgenabschätzung}}, French: {{lang|fr|évaluation des choix scientifiques et technologiques}}) is a scientific, interactive, and communicative process that aims to contribute to the formation of public and political opinion on societal aspects of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the commonly used definition given in the report of the EU-funded project TAMI (Technology Assessment – Methods and Impacts) in 2004: [http://www.ta-swiss.ch/?uid=45 ta-swiss.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;

== General description ==

TA is the study and evaluation of new technologies. It is based on the conviction that new developments within, and discoveries by, the scientific community are relevant for the world at large rather than just for the scientific experts themselves, and that technological progress can never be free of ethical implications. Also, technology assessment recognizes the fact that scientists normally are not trained [[ethicist]]s themselves and accordingly ought to be very careful when passing ethical judgement on their own, or their colleagues, new findings, projects, or work in progress.

Technology assessment assumes a global perspective and is future-oriented, not anti-technological. TA considers its task as an interdisciplinary approach to solving already existing problems and preventing potential damage caused by the uncritical application and the commercialization of new technologies.

Therefore, any results of technology assessment studies must be published, and particular consideration must be given to communication with political decision-makers.

An important problem concerning technology assessment is the so-called [[Collingridge dilemma]]: on the one hand, impacts of new technologies cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used; on the other hand, control or change of a technology is difficult as soon as it is widely used.

Technology assessments, which are a form of [[cost–benefit analysis]], are difficult if not impossible to carry out in an objective manner since subjective decisions and value judgments have to be made regarding a number of complex issues such as (a) the boundaries of the analysis (i.e., what costs are internalized and externalized), (b) the selection of appropriate indicators of potential positive and negative consequences of the new technology, (c) the monetization of non-market values, and (d) a wide range of ethical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 8, "The Positive Biases of Technology Assessments and Cost Benefit Analyses", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, most technology assessments are neither objective nor value-neutral exercises but instead are greatly influenced and biased by the values of the most powerful stakeholders, which are in many cases the developers and proponents (i.e., corporations and governments) of new technologies under consideration. In the most extreme view, as expressed by Ian Barbour in  '’Technology, Environment, and Human Values'’, technology assessment is "a one-sided apology for contemporary technology by people with a stake in its continuation."&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, I.A. (1980). ''Technology, environment, and human values'', Praeger, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the major fields of TA are: information technology, [[hydrogen technologies]], [[nuclear technology]], [[molecular nanotechnology]], [[pharmacology]], [[organ donation|organ transplant]]s, [[biotechnology|gene technology]], [[artificial intelligence]], the Internet and many more. [[Health technology assessment]] is related, but profoundly different, despite the similarity in the name.

===Forms and concepts of technology assessment===
The following types of concepts of TA are those that are most visible and practiced. There are, however, a number of further TA forms that are only proposed as concepts in the literature or are the label used by a particular TA institution.&lt;ref&gt;Among those concepts one finds, for instance, '''Interactive TA''' [http://www.itas.fzk.de/deu/tadn/tadn298/rath298a.htm ITAS.fzk.de], '''Rational TA''' [http://www.ea-aw.com/the-europaeische-akademie/aimstasks.html EA-AW.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918235522/http://www.ea-aw.com/the-europaeische-akademie/aimstasks.html |date=September 18, 2010 }}, '''Real-time TA''' (cp. Guston/Sarewitz (2002) Real-time technology assessment, in: Technology in Society 24, 93–109), Innovation-oriented TA [http://www.innovationsanalysen.de Innovationsanalysen].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Parliamentary TA (PTA)''': TA activities of various kinds whose addressee is a parliament. PTA may be performed directly by members of those parliaments (e.g. in France and Finland) or on their behalf of related TA institutions (such as in the UK, in Germany and Denmark) or by organisations not directly linked to a Parliament (such as in the Netherlands and Switzerland).&lt;ref&gt;Those TA institutions that perform PTA are organised in the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network; see [http://eptanetwork.org EPTAnetwork.org].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Expert TA''' (often also referred to as the '''classical TA''' or '''traditional TA''' concept): TA activities carried out by (a team of) TA and technical experts. Input from stakeholders and other actors is included only via written statements, documents and interviews, but not as in participatory TA.
* '''Participatory TA (pTA)''': TA activities which actively, systematically and methodologically involve various kinds of social actors as assessors and discussants, such as different kinds of civil society organisations, representatives of the state systems, but characteristically also individual stakeholders and citizens (lay persons), technical scientists and technical experts. Standard pTA methods include consensus conferences, focus groups, scenario workshops etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cp. the 2000 EUROpTA (European Participatory Technology Assessment – Participatory Methods in Technology Assessment and Technology Decision-Making) project report [http://www.tekno.dk/pdf/projekter/europta_Report.pdf TEKNO.dk].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes pTA is further divided into '''expert-stakeholder pTA''' and '''public pTA''' (including lay persons).&lt;ref&gt;Van Eijndhoven (1997) Technology assessment: Product or process? in: Technological Forecasting and Social Change 54 (1997) 269–286.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Constructive TA (CTA)''': This concept of TA, developed in the Netherlands, but also applied&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://run.unl.pt/handle/10362/31566|title=Battery storage systems as balancing option in intermittent renewable energy systems - A transdisciplinary approach under the frame of Constructive Technology Assessment. PhD Thesis|last=Baumann|first=Manuel Johann|last2=|publisher=Universidade Nova de Lisboa|year=2017|isbn=|location=Lisbon|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;Schot/Rip (1997), The Past and Future of Constructive Technology Assessment in: Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change 54, 251–268.&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to broaden the design of new technology through feedback of TA activities into the actual construction of technology. Contrary to other forms of TA, CTA is not directed toward influencing regulatory practices by assessing the impacts of technology. Instead, CTA wants to address social issues around technology by influencing design practices.
* '''Discursive TA''' or '''Argumentative TA''': This type of TA wants to deepen the political and normative debate about science, technology and society. It is inspired by ethics, policy discourse analysis and the sociology of expectations in science and technology. This mode of TA aims to clarify and bring under public and political scrutiny the normative assumptions and visions that drive the actors who are socially shaping science and technology. Accordingly, argumentative TA not only addresses the side effects of technological change, but deals with both broader impacts of science and technology and the fundamental normative question of why developing a certain technology is legitimate and desirable.&lt;ref&gt;van Est/Brom (2010) Technology assessment as an analytic and democratic practice, in: Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Health TA (HTA)''': A specialised type of expert TA informing policy makers about efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness issues of pharmaceuticals and medical treatments, see [[health technology assessment]].

'''''The Phoenix Project''''' is a 2015 American science fiction film written and directed by Tyler Graham Pavey.  Corey Rieger, Andrew Simpson, David Pesta, and Orson Ossman star as scientists who attempt to reanimate the dead.

== Plot ==
Perry Frank assembles a team of four young scientists to take part in an experiment to reanimate the dead.  The group consists of himself, his friend and protege Carter Watts, biologist Devin Fischer, and engineer Ampersand "Amps" Garner.  Although Devin and Amps are privately dubious about Carter's usefulness, the team members express their optimism and excitement for the project in taped interviews that Perry arranges.  Perry explains that their funding only allows for five subjects, so they must proceed slowly and carefully.  As they set up the equipment, Amps and Carter bond.  Devin confides to Perry that his father, a scientist, experienced his greatest regret in having his work finished by later teams, and Devin says he wants to push this experiment all the way.

Their first subject is an insect.  When the experiment fails, Devin suggests that since the experiment was designed around mammals, they should abandon tests on insects.  Perry reluctantly agrees, and Amps recalibrates the equipment for a mouse.  Carter, initially supportive of the idea, becomes reluctant when it comes time to kill the mouse, which the others refused to let him name.  The experiment is once again a failure.  Carter and Devin give up for the day, but Amps convinces Perry to set up a second test on the same subject.  Amps becomes demoralized when this also results in failure.  When Carter walks through the lab that night, he notices the mouse's body has moved.  He excitedly wakes the others, and they celebrate.  Carter later approaches Perry privately and cautiously suggests that one of the team members may have moved the mouse to raise morale.  Perry reassures him that he has the situation under control.

Further tests prove failures.  Frustrated, Devin requests Carter contact the grant organization and request money for more tests.  Carter is incensed when he finds that Perry has lied to them; there is no grant, and Perry is bankrolling the experiment privately.  Carter quits the project, citing legal and moral implications, though Devin elects to stay.  Perry and Devin do not explain the situation to Amps.  Devin pushes for a larger mammal, which he says will be easier to test, and Perry allows the use of a rabbit, though he cautions Devin that to maintain public acceptance they must avoid animal testing on anything larger.  Devin and Perry become further estranged when Perry learns Devin has joined to project for personal reasons – his sister is near death, and Devin intends to reanimate her.  Perry angrily reminds Devin that human experimentation is not possible.

After promising results, Amps' updated calculations reveal that the second subject, the mouse, could not have moved.  Perry admits that he moved the mouse himself, and Amps says that he needs time away from the project.  Devin pushes Perry to perform another test without Amps, and they experience their first unqualified success.  Although initially angry they would operate his machine without permission, Amps also becomes excited.  Perry contacts Carter, apologizes for lying about the grant, and requests that he rejoin them.  Carter returns once he hears about their success.  Meanwhile, Devin convinces Amps to secretly test on a human subject.  When Perry finds out, he threatens to call the police.  Seeing no alternative, Devin commits suicide to force them to test the machine on him.  The result is initially a success, but the others are quickly horrified to learn that Devin's memory and personality have been wiped; he does not even understand how to speak.  Perry orders them to destroy the equipment, and they leave the lab with Devin in tow.  As they put him in a car, Devin stares wide-eyed at the world around him.

'''Tom Knight''' is an [[United States|American]] [[synthetic biology|synthetic biologist]] and [[computer engineering|computer engineer]], who was formerly a senior research scientist at the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], a part of the [[MIT School of Engineering]].&lt;ref name="Carlson2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Robert H.|title=Biology Is Technology: The Promise, Peril, and New Business of Engineering Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4VGsMOfvJEC&amp;pg=PA84|accessdate=11 June 2012|date=2010-02-25|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674035447|pages=84–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He now works at the synthetic biology company [[Ginkgo Bioworks]], which he cofounded in 2008.

== Work in electrical engineering and computer science ==

Tom Knight arrived at MIT when he was fourteen. Even though he only started his undergraduate studies at the regular age of 18, he took classes in [[computer programming]] and [[organic chemistry]] during [[high school]] because he lived close to that university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fastcompany.com/3000760/tom-knight-godfather-synthetic-biology-how-learn-something-new ''"Adam Bluestein (2012) Tom Knight, Godfather Of Synthetic Biology, On How To Learn Something New"''], fastcompany.com&lt;/ref&gt; He built early hardware such as [[ARPANET]] interfaces for host #6 on the network, some of the first [[bitmapped display]]s, the [[Incompatible Timesharing System|ITS]] time sharing system, [[Lisp machines]] (he was also instrumental in releasing a version of the operating system for the Lisp machine under a [[BSD license]]), the [[Connection Machine]], and parallel symbolic processing computer systems.

In 1967 Knight wrote the original kernel for the ITS operating system, as well as the combination of command processor and debugger that was used as its top-level user interface.  ITS was the dominant operating system for first [[Project MAC]] and later the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] and [[MIT Laboratory for Computer Science]].  ITS ran on PDP-6 and, later, PDP-10 computers.

In 1968, Knight designed and supervised the construction of the first PDP-10 [[ARPANET]] interfaces with [[Bob Metcalfe]].

In 1972, Knight designed one of the first semiconductor memory-based bitmap displays.  This was later commercialized and led directly to the development of the Bedford Computer Systems newspaper layout system and influenced many of the bitmapped display devices available today.  That same year, along with Jeff Rubin, Knight designed and implemented a network file system that provided the first transparent remote file access over the ARPANET.

In 1974, Knight designed and implemented the prototype version of the MIT [[Lisp Machine]] processor, with the production version following in 1976.  The Lisp Machine was a microprogrammed machine, tuned for high-performance emulation of other instruction sets.  The design of the Lisp Machine was directly implemented by both [[Symbolics]] and [[Lisp Machines, Inc.|LMI]] and was the basis of all of their computers.  Texas Instruments implemented [[surface mount]] and single-chip versions of the architecture in 1983 and 1987, respectively.

Knight collaborated with Jack Holloway in designing and implementing the [[Chaosnet]], a re-engineered version of the Xerox 3 Mbit/s [[Ethernet]].  In 1975 this network became the first local area network on MIT's campus.  Chaosnet's innovation of a preamble bit string for packets was eventually incorporated into the 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standard.

In 1980, Knight participated in the development of the [[Connection Machine]] architecture and its original implementation.  Other notable and diverse accomplishments during the 1980s included the creation of the first silicon retina in 1981, the creation of a single-chip optical mouse, the design of the Cross-Omega interconnection network architecture, and the design of the Transit multiprocessor interconnection architecture.

During the early 1990s, Knight was involved in the formation of [[Permabit]] and of [[Exa Corporation]] and the architecture of the latter's initial version of its FX/1 lattice gas parallel fluid flow computer.  Advances included using over-relaxation techniques to make 10x algorithmic improvements in lattice gas computations, landmark CFD accuracies, and correction of misconceptions about the origin of fluid turbulence in simple two-dimensional flow situations.  Within the Laboratory for Computer Science, he led the Abacus SIMD project, worked on [[VLSI]] microdisplays, and made advances in the field of [[Reversible computing|adiabatic (reversible) computing]].

== Work in [[synthetic biology]] ==

It was also during this period that Knight's interests in biological systems began. Inspired in part by the work of [[Harold J. Morowitz]], a Yale physicist and biologist, Knight studied biochemistry, genetics, and cellular biology, and set up a biology lab within the [[MIT AI Laboratory]].  In this lab he created the concept of the [[BioBrick]] plasmid DNA part&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/21168|title = Tom Knight (2003). Idempotent Vector Design for Standard Assembly of Biobricks|date = |accessdate = 2014-09-26|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and began creating a library of BioBricks that could be used to simplify the [[genetic engineering]] of [[Escherichia coli]] cells.  Today, BioBricks form the basis of the enormous annual [[International Genetically Engineered Machine|iGEM]] (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition and Knight is sometimes referred to as the godfather of synthetic biology. Knight co-founded Ginkgo Bioworks, a synthetic biology company.

'''Wayne Woodrow "Woody" Hayes''' (February 14, 1913 – March 12, 1987) was an [[American football]] player and coach. He served as the head coach at [[Denison University]] (1946–1948), [[Miami University]] in [[Oxford, Ohio]] (1949–1950), and [[Ohio State University]] (1951–1978), compiling a career [[college football]] record of 238 wins, 72 losses, and 10 ties.

During his 28 seasons as the head coach of the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football]] program, Hayes' teams won five [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championships]] (1954, 1957, 1961, 1968, 1970),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/schools/osu/graphics/pdf/m-footbl/1314_p227to277.pdf|title=Ohio State Results by Year|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; captured 13 [[Big Ten Conference]] titles, and amassed a record of 205–61–10. Over the last decade of his coaching tenure at Ohio State, Hayes's Buckeye squads faced off in a fierce rivalry against the [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan Wolverines]] coached by [[Bo Schembechler]], a former player under and assistant coach to Hayes. During that stretch in the [[Michigan–Ohio State football rivalry]], dubbed "[[The Ten Year War]]", Hayes and Schembechler's teams won or shared the Big Ten Conference crown every season and usually each placed in the national rankings.

Despite his great achievements at Ohio State, Hayes's coaching career ended ignominiously when he was dismissed from his position as head coach after punching Clemson nose guard Charlie Bauman for intercepting an Ohio State pass with two minutes left on the clock in the [[1978 Gator Bowl]].  He was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] as a coach in 1983.

==Early years==
A native of [[Clifton, Ohio]], Hayes was the youngest of three children born to Wayne B. and Effie (née Hupp) Hayes.  He played [[Center (American football)|center]] at [[Newcomerstown High School]] in [[Newcomerstown, Ohio]]. At [[Denison University]], he played [[offensive tackle|tackle]] under coach Tom Rogers, and was a member of [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. After graduating from Denison in 1935, Hayes went on to serve as an assistant at two [[Ohio]] high schools: [[Mingo Junction]] in 1935–1936 and [[New Philadelphia, Ohio|New Philadelphia]] in 1937. When New Philadelphia head coach John Brickels left to accept another position, Hayes was elevated to the head coaching position, where he put together a 17–2–1 record in his first two seasons before enduring a 1–9 record in 1940.

Hayes enlisted in the [[United States Navy]] in July 1941, eventually rising to the rank of [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] during [[World War II]]. He commanded ''PC 1251'' in the [[Palau Islands]] invasion and the destroyer-escort [[USS Rinehart|USS ''Rinehart'']] in both the Atlantic and Pacific operations.

As World War II was near its end, and Hayes' alma mater, Denison University, was pursuing plans to reinstate its football program (which had been suspended during the war), it contacted former head coach Rogers (also in the Navy) about rejoining the program as head coach. Rogers declined, but recommended that his former team captain, Hayes, should be named the next head coach. Denison was able to locate and give Hayes an offer, which he accepted, minutes before his Navy ship was to begin the voyage through the [[Panama Canal]] &amp;mdash; meaning Hayes would have been [[Solitary confinement|incommunicado]] for an extended period of time.

==Coaching at Denison and Miami University==
Upon returning to Denison in 1946, Hayes had a hard first year, winning only 2 games, over Capital and the season finale against Wittenberg. However, that victory sparked a 19-game winning streak, a surge that propelled him into the head coaching position at Miami University. Miami is recognized as the "[[Cradle of Coaches]]" because of its history of outstanding coaches starting their careers there, such as [[Paul Brown]], [[Ara Parseghian]], [[Weeb Ewbank]], [[Bill Mallory]], [[Sid Gillman]], [[Randy Walker (American football coach)|Randy Walker]], and [[Bo Schembechler]]. Gillman was Hayes' immediate predecessor at Miami before Gillman moved down the road to coach at the [[University of Cincinnati]], which was then Miami's chief rival. Hayes and Gillman maintained a sparkling feud between themselves, combining mutual distaste for the other's coaching style, and because they were in recruiting competition in the same general area.&lt;ref&gt;

In his second year with the [[Miami Redhawks football|Miami Redskins]], Hayes led the 1950 team to an appearance in the [[Salad Bowl (American College Football)|Salad Bowl]], where they defeated [[Arizona State University|Arizona State]]. That success led him to accept the Ohio State head coaching position on February 18, 1951, in a controversial decision after the university rejected the applications of other more well-known coaches, including former Buckeyes' head coach [[Paul Brown]], incumbent Buckeye assistant Harry Strobel, and Missouri head coach [[Don Faurot]].&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. pp.84-85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ohio State==
[[File:Woody Hayes, Dick Doyle and Ernie Godfrey (1952).jpg|left|165px|thumb|Hayes with fullback Dick Doyle and assistant coach Ernie Godfrey, 1952]]
As head coach of the [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State Buckeyes]], Hayes led his teams to a 205–61–10 record (.761), including three consensus national championships (1954,1957 and 1968), two other non-consensus national titles (1961 and 1970), 13 [[Big Ten Conference football champions|Big Ten conference championships]], and eight [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] appearances. Hayes was a three-time winner of The College Football Coach of the Year Award, now known as the [[Paul "Bear" Bryant Award]], and was "the subject of more varied and colorful anecdotal material than any other coach past or present, including fabled [[Knute Rockne]]", according to biographer Jerry Brondfield.

Hayes' basic coaching philosophy was that "nobody could win football games unless they regarded the game positively and would agree to pay the price that success demands of a team." His conservative style of football (especially on offense) was often described as "three yards and a cloud of dust"—in other words, a "crunching, frontal assault of muscle against muscle, bone upon bone, will against will." The basic, bread-and-butter play in Hayes' playbook was a fullback off-guard run or a tailback off tackle play. Hayes was often quoted as saying "only three things can happen when you pass (a completion, an incompletion, and an interception) and two of them are bad."

In spite of this apparent willingness to avoid change, Hayes became one of the first major college head coaches to recruit [[African-American]] players, including [[Jim Parker (American football)|Jim Parker]], who played both offensive and defensive tackle on Hayes' first national championship team in 1954. While Hayes was not the first to recruit African-Americans to Ohio State, he was the first to recruit and start African-Americans in large numbers there and to hire African-American assistant coaches.

Another Hayes' recruit, [[Archie Griffin]], was the only two-time [[Heisman Trophy]] winner in seven decades of selections. Altogether, Hayes had 58 players earn [[All-America]] honors under his tutelage. Many notable football coaches, such as [[Lou Holtz]], [[Bill Arnsparger]], [[Bill Mallory]], [[Dick Crum (football coach)|Dick Crum]], [[Bo Schembechler]], [[Ara Parseghian]] and Woody's successor, [[Earle Bruce]], served as his assistants at various times.

Hayes would often use illustrations from historical events to make a point in his coaching and teaching. When Hayes was first hired to be the head coach at Ohio State, he was also made a "full professor of physical education", having earned an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in educational administration from Ohio State in 1948. The classes that he taught on campus were usually full, and he was called "Professor Hayes" by students. Hayes also taught mandatory English and [[vocabulary]] classes to his freshman football players. One of his students was a basketball player named [[Bobby Knight]], who was to become a legendary basketball coach.

During his time at Ohio State, Hayes' relationships with students faculty members were particularly good. Even those members of the faculty who believed that the role of [[intercollegiate athletics]] was growing out of control respected Hayes personally for his commitment to academics, the standards of integrity with which he ran his program, and the genuine enthusiasm he brought to his hobby as an amateur historian. Hayes often ate lunch or dinner at the university's faculty club, interacting with faculty and administrators.

As a coach and an educator, Hayes was one of the first to use the [[motion picture]] as a teaching and learning tool.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} He was also memorable in that he could be seen walking across campus, taking the time to visit with students.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} When talking to young people, Hayes treated all with respect, without regard to race or socio-economic class.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} This behavior by Hayes was helpful to Ohio State to quell the violence and damage from anti-war demonstrations that other college campuses suffered in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He would actually take the time to communicate with student leaders. Then-team quarterback [[Rex Kern]] said, "Woody was out there on the Oval with the protesters, and he'd grab a bullhorn and tell the students to express their beliefs but not be destructive. He believed in [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]], and he believed in [[the Establishment]], but he wasn't afraid to talk to the students. He wanted to stay close to the action."&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. pp.195-197&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes was considered one of the few authority figures that students then had respect for. His enthusiasm for coaching and winning was such that many across the nation consider the following maxim to be true: "What [[Vince Lombardi]] was to professional football, Woody Hayes was to college football."{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

During his tenure at Ohio State, Hayes would joke that he considered himself to be [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]]'s best recruiter because if he could not convince a recruit to come to Ohio State instead of Michigan he would try to steer the recruit to Notre Dame, whom Ohio State did not play. While Hayes' public stance was that he refused to play Notre Dame because he was afraid of polarizing the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] population in Ohio, Notre Dame's long-time athletic director [[Moose Krause|Edward "Moose" Krause]] said that Hayes had told him that Hayes liked having Michigan as the only tough game on the Ohio State schedule and that having the Buckeyes play Notre Dame would detract from that.&lt;ref&gt;

After losses or ties, Hayes would conduct locker room interviews while naked. A journalist from his tenure noted, "He was an ugly guy so it would clear the locker room out pretty fast."&lt;ref name=CPD021209&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/osu/index.ssf/2009/02/leonard_downie_jr_regrettably.html Leonard Downie Jr. regrettably recalls Woody Hayes holding interviews while naked], ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'', February 12, 2009, Accessed February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TL021209&gt;Richard Oviatt, [http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2009/02/12/Campus/Washington.Post.Editor.Leonard.Downie.Jr.Talks.Past.Future-3625084.shtml Washington Post editor Leonard Downie Jr. talks past, future] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090215165400/http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2009/02/12/Campus/Washington.Post.Editor.Leonard.Downie.Jr.Talks.Past.Future-3625084.shtml |date=2009-02-15 }}, ''The Lantern'', February 12, 2009, Accessed February 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
In 1959, following a 17−0 loss to [[USC Trojans football|USC]], Hayes threw a punch at ''[[Los Angeles Examiner]]'' sportswriter Al Bine, but missed, and punched the brother of ''Pasadena Independent'' sports editor Bob Shafer in the back instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Didn't Punch Scribe, Woody Hayes Insists |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W-EyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dQAGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4708,328808 |newspaper=Sunday Herald |date=October 4, 1959 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a May 1965 meeting of Big Ten Conference athletic directors and coaches, Hayes nearly started a fight with [[Iowa Hawkeyes|Iowa's]] athletic director, [[Forest Evashevski]], before being restrained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hayes, Evashevski Nearly Come To Blows At Meeting |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=saZfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=VzIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6124,3370355 |newspaper=[[Lewiston Morning Tribune]] |date=May 21, 1965 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Hayes team won a game against rival [[1968 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], 50–14.  Late in that game, Ohio State held a commanding 44–14 advantage and scored one final touchdown. Rather than taking the more common [[extra point]] kick, Hayes instead opted for a [[two-point conversion]], but was unsuccessful, leading many football fans to believe that Hayes was [[running up the score]]. When asked later why he went for two points, Hayes said, "Because they wouldn’t let me go for three.”

Prior to the [[1973 Rose Bowl]], Hayes shoved a camera into the face of a news photographer. As a result, Hayes was suspended for three games, fined $2,000, and left California with a [[subpoena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Strode, George |title=Despite Many Outbursts Woody Hayes Has Humanitarian Side Seldom Publicized |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=keFIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ioIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2432,2505387 |newspaper=[[Youngstown Vindicator]] |date=January 7, 1973 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, a late fumble at Michigan caused him to charge at [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] cameraman Mike Freedman, who recorded his frustration; Hayes was [[ejection (sports)|ejected]], put on [[probation]] by the Big Ten Conference, and fined $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Mooshil, Joe |title=Duke Puts Woody on Probation |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3nIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YawFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2690,3281794 |newspaper=[[The Argus-Press]] |date=December 3, 1977 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1962 Rose Bowl vote===
In the 1961 season, Ohio State won the Big Ten championship, qualifying automatically for the Rose Bowl. At the time, the Big Ten Conference rules stated that the school's Faculty Council must officially approve of the trip. In this unusual development, the Ohio State Faculty Council voted 28 to 25 against the [[1962 Rose Bowl]] trip, prompted by the head of a university alumni group, on the grounds that the school's academic reputation was suffering because of over-emphasis on the football team. Other reports stated that the bid was declined because Ohio State had already beaten their would-be Rose Bowl opponent, [[University of California at Los Angeles|UCLA]], during the regular season. The decision sparked minor rioting on the Ohio State Campus and in the Columbus area. The ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'' published the names, addresses, and phone numbers of those Faculty Council Members who voted against the trip as well as the amount of university money that they spent on the trips. While Hayes was diplomatic with some faculty members who voted against the trip and urged the students to cease complaining, he did not spare his criticism of the alumni club president who led the charge against accepting the bowl bid.&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. pp.142-145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments on the My Lai Massacre===

Speaking at a football [[banquet]] in 1969, Hayes spoke about the recently revealed [[My Lai Massacre]].  He stated that the Vietnamese men in My Lai deserved to die, "and I wouldn't be so sure those women were innocent.  The children are obviously innocent – if they are less than five."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woody Waves His Flag |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19691212&amp;id=Es4bAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fVAEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7306,5888738 |newspaper=[[The Pittsburgh Press]] |date=December 12, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confrontation with Jerry Markbreit===
Late in the 1971 rivalry game against [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], furious over what he thought was a missed defensive [[pass interference]] foul committed by [[Thom Darden]] of Michigan, Hayes stormed onto the field, launched a profanity-laced tirade at referee [[Jerry Markbreit]], and tore up the sideline markers, receiving a 15-yard [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalty. Hayes then threw the penalty flag into the crowd, began destroying the yard markers, and threw the first-down marker into the ground like a [[javelin]] before being restrained by Buckeyes team officials; Hayes was then assessed an additional 15-yard penalty and ejected. Hayes was suspended for one game and fined $1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woody Hayes Still Fuming Grid's 'Worst Called Play' |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=n6hIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FQENAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3884,3100903 |newspaper=[[The Morning Record]] |date=November 23, 1971 |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;



===1978 Gator Bowl incident and dismissal===
On December 29, 1978, the Buckeyes played in the [[1978 Gator Bowl|Gator Bowl]] against [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]. Late in the fourth quarter, Clemson was leading Ohio State 17–15. Freshman quarterback [[Art Schlichter]] managed to get Ohio State into field goal range. On third and 5 at the Clemson 24-yard line with 2:30 left and the clock running, Hayes called a pass rather than a run, because Schlichter was having a great game up to that point. Schlichter's next pass was intercepted by Clemson [[nose guard]] Charlie Bauman, who returned it toward the Ohio State sideline, where he was run out of bounds. After Bauman got back up, Hayes punched him in the throat, triggering a [[bench-clearing brawl]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEVJyf0ft3I&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes stormed onto the field and was abusive towards the referee. When one of Hayes' own players, offensive lineman, [[Ken Fritz]], tried to intervene, Hayes turned on him and had to be restrained by defensive coordinator George Hill. The Buckeyes were assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for Hayes' attack on Bauman and his abuse towards the referee. Bauman was not injured by Hayes' punch and shrugged the incident off. Even though the game was being telecast by ABC, announcers [[Keith Jackson]] and [[Ara Parseghian]] did not comment about the punch. (At the time, all non-press box cameras were operated remotely from another site, and Jackson allegedly did not actually witness the punch, his view of the sidelines being blocked by the upper tier of the stadium).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

After the game, Ohio State Athletic Director Hugh Hindman, who had played for Hayes at Miami of Ohio, and had been an assistant under him for seven years, privately confronted Hayes in the Buckeye locker room. He said that he intended to tell school president [[Harold Leroy Enarson|Harold Enarson]] about what happened, and strongly implied that Hayes had coached his last game at Ohio State. After a heated exchange, Hindman said that he then offered Hayes a chance to resign, but Hayes refused, saying, "That would make it too easy for you. You had better go ahead and fire me." Hindman then met with Enarson at a [[country club]] near [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], and the two agreed that Hayes had to go.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1094478/index.htm Scorecard]. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 1979-01-08.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Woody Hayes's last stand: Ohio State, Clemson and the punch that ruined Hayes |url=https://www.si.com/college-football/2016/12/23/woody-hayes-punch-clemson-ohio-state |publisher=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=December 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, Hindman told Hayes that he had been fired. A press conference was held at the hotel where the team had been staying. The team returned to Columbus around noon, and Hayes left the airport in a police car. Regarding Hayes' dismissal, Enarson said that "there isn't a university or athletic conference in this country that would permit a coach to physically assault a college athlete."&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 12-31-1978, pg.S1&lt;/ref&gt; After the incident, Hayes reflected on his career by saying, "Nobody despises to lose more than I do. That's got me into trouble over the years, but it also made a man of mediocre ability into a pretty good coach." About two months after the incident, Hayes called Bauman in his dorm room, but did not apologize for his previous attack on him. [[Earle Bruce]] succeeded Hayes as Ohio State's head coach.

Many years later, [[Leonard Downie, Jr.]], former executive editor of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and student journalist at Ohio State, said he regretted not reporting an incident in the 1960s where Hayes instructed a player to take off his helmet and then hit him in the head.&lt;ref name="TL021209"/&gt;

According to the 1994 [[Home Box Office|HBO]] documentary ''American Coaches: Men of Vision and Victory'', Hindman had placed Hayes on notice at the beginning of the 1978 season, not just for the swing at the ABC cameraman during the 1977 Michigan game, but also for hitting a player during a practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=American Coaches: Men of Vision and Victory |author=HBO Sports |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his 1989 autobiography, Michigan's [[Bo Schembechler]] wrote that he believed Hayes, who was [[diabetes|diabetic]] and may have had a high [[blood sugar]] level, didn’t believe he struck Bauman. Schembechler also pointed out that Hayes had maintained that all he was trying to do was grab the ball away.&lt;ref&gt;Schembechler &amp; Albom.  p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and after the dismissal incident, Hayes was a professor of Military History at Ohio State. His office was in the ROTC building, Converse Hall, across the street from Ohio Stadium. For the remainder of his years at OSU, he continued to teach and mentor students.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Final days and death==
On March 11, 1987, Hayes was clearly in failing health when he had someone drive him in his pickup truck to [[Dayton]] to introduce [[Bo Schembechler]], who was speaking at a banquet. Organizers had tried to discourage Hayes from attending, but Hayes insisted. He gave a lengthy introduction to Schembechler and then stayed to hear him speak before being driven back home.&lt;ref&gt;Schembechler &amp; Albom.  p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The next morning, March 12, Hayes's wife Anne found him unconscious in his bed at the couple's home.&lt;ref name=Folkart&gt;Burt A. Folkart, [http://articles.latimes.com/1987-03-12/news/mn-9439_1_woody-hayes Woody Hayes, Buckeye Coach 28 Years, Dies], [[Los Angeles Times]] (March 12, 1987).

Retrieved on July 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He is interred at Union Cemetery in [[Columbus, Ohio]].

==Legacy==
Hayes's lifetime record of 238–72–10 placed him ninth in all-time [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I FBS coaching victories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2007/2007_d1_football_records_book.pdf|title=page 383|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201142013/http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2007/2007_d1_football_records_book.pdf|archivedate=2007-12-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in 1983.

At Hayes's [[funeral]] at First Community Church in Grandview, Ohio on March 17, 1987, [[President of the United States|former president]] [[Richard Nixon]] delivered the eulogy before a crowd of 1,400, acknowledging the friendship that had begun between the two during his second term as [[U.S. Vice President|vice president]]. Having met Hayes at a reception following a Buckeye win over Iowa in 1957, Nixon recalled, "I wanted to talk about [[American football|football]]. Woody wanted to talk about [[foreign policy]]. And you know Woody—we talked about foreign policy."&lt;ref&gt;Nixon, Richard M. [http://www.dispatch.com/content/blogs/a-look-back/2012/03/remembering-woody-hayes.html "A Tribute to Woody Hayes"], March 17, 1987, quoted in ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'', March 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, more than 15,000 people took part in a [[funeral|memorial service]] at [[Ohio Stadium]].

Hayes's commitment to academics at Ohio State was evidenced by his request that donations from his family, friends, and supporters be made to the academic side of the university. Following his death and in keeping with his wishes, the Wayne Woodrow Hayes Chair in National Security Studies was established at Ohio State's [[Mershon Center for International Security Studies]]. Professor [[John Mueller]] currently holds the chair. In November 1987, the university dedicated the new [[Woody Hayes Athletic Center]] in his memory.

==Personal life==
Hayes married the former Anne Gross in 1942. Anne Hayes was a formidable and popular woman in her own right, who used to jokingly say at numerous sports banquets, "Divorce Woody? Never! But there were plenty of times I wanted to murder him!"&lt;ref&gt;Lombardo, ''op.cit''. p.40&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple had one son, Steven, who went on to become a lawyer and judge. Coincidentally, the younger Hayes would be assigned to the 2003 trial of former Ohio State standout [[Maurice Clarett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=1618719|title=Clarett case judge is Woody Hayes' son|date=18 September 2003|website=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II movie host===
Because of his knowledge of military history and ongoing popularity, Hayes in the early 1980s hosted the broadcast of six World War II films for [[WBNS-TV]] in Columbus, which has served as the official outlet of Ohio State sports media programming for years, including the football coach's shows. Among the movies broadcast were ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'', ''[[Midway (1976 film)|Midway]]'', ''[[The Wackiest Ship in the Army (film)|The Wackiest Ship in the Army]]'', ''[[The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel]]'', and ''[[Tora! Tora! Tora!]]''

Hayes would also give salty historical perspectives related to each movie. Hayes' segments, depending upon the movie, were taped in such locations as [[Fort Knox]], [[United States Military Academy|West Point]], the {{USS|Yorktown|CV-10|6}}, and [[Stuttgart]], Germany, where he interviewed [[Manfred Rommel]], Lord Mayor of Stuttgart and the son of [[Erwin Rommel]].

{{Hinduism}}
'''Ātman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|t|m|ən}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] word that means inner [[self]] or [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;'''[a]''' [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/atman Atman], Oxford Dictionaries, Oxford University Press (2012), '''Quote''': "1. real self of the individual; 2. a person's soul";&lt;br&gt;'''[b]''' John Bowker (2000), The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0192800947}}, See entry for Atman;&lt;br&gt;'''[c]''' WJ Johnson (2009), A Dictionary of Hinduism, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0198610250}}, See entry for Atman (self).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenatman&gt;David Lorenzen (2004), The Hindu World (Editors: Sushil Mittal and Gene Thursby), Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415215277}}, pages 208-209, '''Quote''': "Advaita and nirguni movements, on the other hand, stress an interior mysticism in which the devotee seeks to discover the identity of individual soul (atman) with the universal ground of being (brahman) or to find god within himself".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, page 63; '''Quote''': "Even though Buddhism explicitly rejected the Hindu ideas of Atman (“soul”) and Brahman, Hinduism treats Sakyamuni Buddha as one of the ten avatars of Vishnu."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Hindu philosophy]], especially in the [[Vedanta]] school of [[Hinduism]], Ātman is the [[first principle]],&lt;ref&gt;Deussen, Paul and Geden, A. S. The Philosophy of the Upanishads. Cosimo Classics (June 1, 2010). P. 86. {{ISBN|1616402407}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''true'' self of an individual beyond identification with phenomena, the essence of an individual. In order to attain [[Moksha|liberation (moksha)]], a human being must acquire self-knowledge (atma [[jnana]]), which is to realize that one's true self (Ātman) is identical with the transcendent self [[Brahman]].&lt;ref name=davidlorenzenatman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard King (1995), Early Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791425138}}, page 64, '''Quote:''' "Atman as the innermost essence or soul of man, and Brahman as the innermost essence and support of the universe. (...) Thus we can see in the Upanishads, a tendency towards a convergence of microcosm and macrocosm, culminating in the equating of atman with Brahman".&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hindu philosophy|six orthodox schools of Hinduism]] believe that there is Ātman (soul, self) in every being.  This is a major point of difference with the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] doctrine of [[Anatta]] which holds that there is no unchanging soul or self.&lt;ref name=johnplott3/&gt;&lt;ref name=4sources&gt;KN Jayatilleke (2010), Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, {{ISBN|978-8120806191}}, pages 246-249, from note 385 onwards; Steven Collins (1994), Religion and Practical Reason (Editors: Frank Reynolds, David Tracy), State Univ of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791422175}}, page 64; "Central to Buddhist soteriology is the doctrine of not-self (Pali: anattā, Sanskrit: anātman, the opposed doctrine of ātman is central to Brahmanical thought). Put very briefly, this is the [Buddhist] doctrine that human beings have no soul, no self, no unchanging essence."; Edward Roer (Translator), {{Google books|3uwDAAAAMAAJ|Shankara's Introduction|page=2}} to ''Brihad Aranyaka Upanishad'', pages 2-4; Katie Javanaud (2013), [https://philosophynow.org/issues/97/Is_The_Buddhist_No-Self_Doctrine_Compatible_With_Pursuing_Nirvana Is The Buddhist ‘No-Self’ Doctrine Compatible With Pursuing Nirvana?], Philosophy Now&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Wynne (2011), ''The ātman and its negation'', Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, Volume 33, Number 1–2, pp. 103–105, '''Quote''': "The denial that a human being possesses a "self" or "soul" is probably the most famous Buddhist teaching. It is certainly its most distinct, as has been pointed out by G. P. Malalasekera: "In its denial of any real permanent Soul or Self, Buddhism stands alone." A similar modern Sinhalese perspective has been expressed by Walpola Rahula: "Buddhism stands unique in the history of human thought in denying the existence of such a Soul, Self or Ātman." The "no Self" or "no soul" doctrine (Sanskrit: anātman; Pāli: anattan) is particularly notable for its widespread acceptance and historical endurance. It was a standard belief of virtually all the ancient schools of Indian Buddhism (the notable exception being the Pudgalavādins), and has persisted without change into the modern era. [...] both views are mirrored by the modern Theravādin perspective of Mahasi Sayadaw that "there is no person or soul" and the modern Mahāyāna view of the fourteenth Dalai Lama that "[t]he Buddha taught that … our belief in an independent self is the root cause of all suffering"."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and meaning==
"Ātman" (Atma, आत्मा, आत्मन्) is a Sanskrit word which means "essence, breath, soul."&lt;ref name=dougharper/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R Dalal (2011), The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths, Penguin, {{ISBN|978-0143415176}}, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] *etmen (a root meaning "breath"; cognates:  Dutch ''adem'', Old High German ''atum'' "breath," Modern German ''atmen'' "to breathe" and ''Atem'' "respiration, breath", Old English ''eþian'').&lt;ref name=dougharper&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=atman Atman] Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper (2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the concept==

===Vedas===
The earliest use of word "Ātman" in [[Indian literature|Indian texts]] is found in the [[Rig Veda]] (RV X.97.11).&lt;ref&gt;[http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_१०.९७ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं १०.९७], Wikisource; Quote: "यदिमा वाजयन्नहमोषधीर्हस्त आदधे । '''आत्मा''' यक्ष्मस्य नश्यति पुरा जीवगृभो यथा ॥११॥&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yāska]], the ancient Indian grammarian, commenting on this Rigvedic verse, accepts the following meanings of Ātman: the pervading principle, the organism in which other elements are united and the ultimate sentient principle.&lt;ref&gt;Baumer, Bettina and Vatsyayan, Kapila. Kalatattvakosa Vol. 1: Pervasive Terms Vyapti (Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts). Motilal Banarsidass; Revised edition (March 1, 2001).

Ātman is a central idea in all of the [[Upanishads]], and "know your Ātman" is their thematic focus.&lt;ref name=ptraju&gt;PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, pages 35-36&lt;/ref&gt; These texts state that the core of every person's self is not the body, nor the mind, nor the ego, but "Ātman", which means "soul" or "self".&lt;ref&gt;"Soul" is synonymous with "self" in translations of ancient texts of Hindu philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; Atman is the spiritual essence in all creatures, their real innermost essential being.&lt;ref name=alicebailey&gt;Alice Bailey (1973), The Soul and Its Mechanism, {{ISBN|978-0853301158}}, pages 82-83&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eknath Easwaran (2007), The Upanishads, Nilgiri Press, {{ISBN|978-1586380212}}, pages 38-39, 318-320&lt;/ref&gt; It is eternal, it is the essence, it is ageless. Atman is that which one is at the deepest level of one's existence.

====''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad''====
The ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'' describes Atman as that in which everything exists, which is of the highest value, which permeates everything, which is the essence of all, bliss and beyond description.&lt;ref&gt;Raju, Poolla Tirupati. Structural Depths of Indian Thought. SUNY Series in Philosophy. P. 26. {{ISBN|0-88706-139-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In hymn 4.4.5, Brihadaranyaka Upanishad describes Atman as Brahman (universal absolute; supreme soul), and associates it with everything one is, everything one can be, one's free will, one's desire, what one does, what one doesn't do, the good in oneself, the bad in oneself.
{{quote|That ''Atman'' (self, soul) is indeed Brahman. It [Ātman] is also identified with the intellect, the Manas (mind), and the vital breath, with the eyes and ears, with earth, water, air, and ākāśa (sky), with fire and with what is other than fire, with desire and the absence of desire, with anger and the absence of anger, with righteousness and unrighteousness, with everything — it is identified, as is well known, with this (what is perceived) and with that (what is inferred).

As it [Ātman, self, soul] does and acts, so it becomes: by doing good it becomes good, and by doing evil it becomes evil. It becomes virtuous through good acts, and vicious through evil acts. Others, however, say, "The self is identified with desire alone.

This theme of Ātman, that is soul and self of oneself, every person, every being is the same as Brahman, is extensively repeated in Brihadāranyaka Upanishad. The Upanishad asserts that this knowledge of "I am Brahman", and that there is no difference between "I" and "you", or "I" and "him" is a source of liberation, and not even gods can prevail over such a liberated man. For example, in hymn 1.4.10,&lt;ref name=bu1410/&gt;

{{quote|
Brahman was this before; therefore it knew even the Ātma (soul, himself). I am Brahman, therefore it became all. And whoever among the gods had this enlightenment, also became That. It is the same with the sages, the same with men. Whoever knows the self as “I am Brahman,” becomes all this universe. Even the gods cannot prevail against him, for he becomes their Ātma. Now, if a man worships another god, thinking: “He is one and I am another,” he does not know. He is like an animal to the gods. As many animals serve a man, so does each man serve the gods. Even if one animal is taken away, it causes anguish; how much more so when many are taken away? Therefore it is not pleasing to the gods that men should know this.

====''Katha Upanishad''====
Along with the ''Brihadāranyaka'', all the earliest and middle Upanishads discuss Ātman as they build their theories to answer how man can achieve liberation, freedom and bliss. The ''[[Katha Upanishad]]'', for example, explains Atman as immanent and transcendent innermost essence of each human being and living creature, that this is one, even though the external forms of living creatures manifest in different forms, for example, in hymns 2.2.9 and others, its states

{{quote|As the one fire, after it has entered the world, though one, takes different forms according to whatever it burns,&lt;br /&gt;
so does the internal Ātman of all living beings, though one, takes a form according to whatever He enters and is outside all forms.

Katha Upanishad, in Book 1, hymns 3.3 to 3.4, describes the widely cited analogy of chariot for the relation of "Soul, Self" to body, mind and senses.&lt;ref name=kathaup2&gt;Sanskrit Original: आत्मानँ रथितं विद्धि शरीरँ रथमेव तु । बुद्धिं तु सारथिं विद्धि मनः प्रग्रहमेव च ॥ ३ ॥ इन्द्रियाणि हयानाहुर्विषयाँ स्तेषु गोचरान् । आत्मेन्द्रियमनोयुक्तं भोक्तेत्याहुर्मनीषिणः ॥ ४ ॥, [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/कठोपनिषद् Katha Upanishad] Wikisource;&lt;br /&gt;English Translation: Max Müller, [https://archive.org/stream/SacredBooksEastVariousOrientalScholarsWithIndex.50VolsMaxMuller/15.SacredBooksEast.VarOrSch.v15.Muller.Hindu.Mull.Upanishads.p2.KathMundTait..Mait.Oxf.1884.#page/n71/mode/2up Katha Upanishad] Third Valli, Verse 3 &amp; 4 and through 15, pages 12-14&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Kaplan&lt;ref name=stevekaplan&gt;Stephen Kaplan (2011), The Routledge Companion to Religion and Science, (Editors: James W.

Know the intellect as the charioteer, and the mind as the reins. The senses, they say are the horses, and sense objects are the paths around them". The Katha Upanishad then declares that "when the Self [Ātman] understands this and is unified, integrated with body, senses and mind, is virtuous, mindful and pure, he reaches bliss, freedom and liberation".&lt;ref name=kathaup2/&gt;

====''Chandogya Upanishad''====
The ''[[Chandogya Upanishad]]'' explains Ātman as that which appears to be separate between two living beings but isn't, that essence and innermost, true, radiant self of all individuals which connects and unifies all. In hymn 4.10.1 through 4.10.3, for example, it explains it with example of rivers, some of which flow to the east and some to the west, but ultimately all merge into the ocean and become one. In the same way, the individual souls are pure being, states the ''Chandogya Upanishad''; an individual soul is pure truth, and an individual soul is a manifestation of the ocean of one universal soul.&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Müller]], Upanishads, Wordsworth, {{ISBN|978-1840221022}}, pages XXIII-XXIV&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other Upanishads====
Ātman is a key topic of the Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some teach that Brahman (highest reality; universal principle; being-consciousness-bliss) is identical with Ātman, while others teach that Ātman is part of Brahman but not identical to it.&lt;ref name=johnkoller/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], {{Google books|B0QzAQAAMAAJ|The Philosophy of the Upanishads}}, Dover Publications, pages 86-111, 182-212&lt;/ref&gt; This ancient debate flowered into various dual and non-dual theories in Hinduism. The [[Brahmasutra]] by Badarayana (~100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects, particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and in the state of self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different (advaita).&lt;ref name=johnkoller/&gt; This synthesis overcame the dualistic tradition of Samkhya-Yoga schools and realism-driven traditions of Nyaya-Vaiseshika schools, enabling it to become the foundation of Vedanta as Hinduism's enduring spiritual tradition.&lt;ref name=johnkoller&gt;John Koller (2012), Shankara, in Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Religion, (Editors: Chad Meister, Paul Copan), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415782944}}, pages 99-102&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools of thought==
{{Hindu philosophy}}
All major orthodox schools of Hinduism –Nyaya, Vaisesika, Samkhya, Yoga, Mimamsa, and Vedanta– accept the foundational premise of the Vedas and Upanishads that "Ātman exists". [[Ātman (Jainism)|Jainism]] too accepts this premise, though it has its own idea of what that means. In contrast, both Buddhism and the [[Charvaka]]s deny that there is anything called "Ātman/soul/self".&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt;

Knowing Ātman, also referred to as self-knowledge, is one of the defining themes of all major orthodox schools of Hinduism, but they diverge on how. In Hinduism, self-knowledge is the knowledge and understanding of Atman, what it is, and what it is not. Hinduism considers Atman as distinct from the ever-evolving individual personality characterized with ''Ahamkara'' (ego, non-spiritual psychological I-ness Me-ness), habits, prejudices, desires, impulses, delusions, fads, behaviors, pleasures, sufferings and fears. Human personality and ''Ahamkara'' shift, evolve or change with time, state the schools of Hinduism; while, Atman doesn't.&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt; Atman, state these schools, is the unchanging, eternal, innermost radiant self that is unaffected by personality, unaffected by ego of oneself, unaffected by ego of others; Atman is that which is ever-free, never-bound, one that seeks, realizes and is the realized purpose, meaning, liberation in life.&lt;ref&gt;James Hart (2009), Who One Is: Book 2: Existenz and Transcendental Phenomenology, Springer, {{ISBN|978-1402091773}}, pages 2-3, 46-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard White (2012), The Heart of Wisdom: A Philosophy of Spiritual Life, Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1442221161}}, pages 125-131&lt;/ref&gt; Puchalski states, "the ultimate goal of Hindu religious life is to transcend individually, to realize one's own true nature", the inner essence of oneself, which is divine and pure.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Puchalski (2006), A Time for Listening and Caring, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195146820}}, page 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vedanta school===
Philosophical schools such as [[Advaita]] (non-dualism) see the "spirit/soul/self" within each living entity as being fully identical with [[Brahman]]– the universal soul.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro/&gt; The Advaita school believes that there is one soul that connects and exists in all living beings, regardless of their shapes or forms, and there is no distinction, no superior, no inferior, no separate devotee soul (Atman), no separate god soul (Brahman).&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro&gt;Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Vedānta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86&lt;/ref&gt; The oneness unifies all beings, there is divine in every being, and that all existence is a single reality, state the Advaita Vedanta Hindus. In contrast, devotional sub-schools of Vedanta such as [[Dvaita]] (dualism) differentiate between the individual Atma in living beings, and the supreme Atma ([[Paramatma]]) as being separate.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bhagavata Purana]] [http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en 3.28.41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217121958/http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en |date=2012-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://srimadbhagavatam.com/7/7/19-20/en1 Bhagavata Purana 7.7.19–20] ""Atma" also refers to the Supreme Lord or the living entities. Both of them are spiritual."&lt;/ref&gt;

Advaita Vedanta philosophy considers Atman as self-existent awareness, limitless and non-dual.&lt;ref name=aramb&gt;A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791468524}}, pages 47, 99-103&lt;/ref&gt; To Advaitins, the Atman is the Brahman, the Brahman is the Atman, each self is non-different from the infinite.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karl Potter (2008), Encyclopedia of Indian Philosophies: Advaita Vedānta, Volume 3, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120803107}}, pages 510-512&lt;/ref&gt; Atman is the universal principle, one eternal undifferentiated self-luminous consciousness, the truth asserts Advaita Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;S Timalsina (2014), Consciousness in Indian Philosophy: The Advaita Doctrine of ‘Awareness Only’, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415762236}}, pages 3-23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eliot Deutsch (1980), Advaita Vedanta: A Philosophical Reconstruction, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824802714}}, pages 48-53&lt;/ref&gt; Human beings, in a state of unawareness of this universal self, see their "I-ness" as different than the being in others, then act out of impulse, fears, cravings, malice, division, confusion, anxiety, passions, and a sense of distinctiveness.&lt;ref&gt;A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791468524}}, pages 114-122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adi Sankara, A Bouquet of Nondual Texts: Advaita Prakarana Manjari, Translators: Ramamoorthy &amp; Nome, {{ISBN|978-0970366726}}, pages 173-214&lt;/ref&gt; To Advaitins, Atman-knowledge is the state of full awareness, liberation, and freedom that overcomes dualities at all levels, realizing the divine within oneself, the divine in others, and in all living beings; the non-dual oneness, that God is in everything, and everything is God.&lt;ref name=arvindsharmaintro/&gt;&lt;ref name=aramb/&gt; This identification of individual living beings/souls, or jiva-atmas, with the 'one Atman' is the non-dualistic [[Advaita Vedanta]] position.

The [[monism|monist]], non-dual conception of existence in Advaita Vedanta is not accepted by the dualistic/theistic [[Dvaita Vedanta]]. Dvaita Vedanta calls the Atman of a supreme being as ''"[[Paramatman]]"'', and holds it to be different from individual Atman. Dvaita scholars assert that God is the ultimate, complete, perfect, but distinct soul, one that is separate from incomplete, imperfect ''jivas'' (individual souls).&lt;ref&gt;R Prasad (2009), A Historical-developmental Study of Classical Indian Philosophy of Morals, Concept Publishing, {{ISBN|978-8180695957}}, pages 345-347&lt;/ref&gt; The Advaita sub-school believes that self-knowledge leads to liberation in this life, while the Dvaita sub-school believes that liberation is only possible in after-life as communion with God, and only through the grace of God (if not, then one's Atman is reborn).&lt;ref&gt;James Lewis and William Travis (1999), Religious Traditions of the World, {{ISBN|978-1579102302}}, pages 279-280&lt;/ref&gt; God created individual souls, state Dvaita Vedantins, but the individual soul never was and never will become one with God; the best it can do is to experience bliss by getting infinitely close to God.&lt;ref name=tompad&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, pages 155-157&lt;/ref&gt; The Dvaita school, therefore, in contrast to monistic position of Advaita, advocates a version of monotheism wherein [[Brahman]] is made synonymous with [[Vishnu]] (or Narayana), distinct from numerous individual Atmans. Dvaita school, states Graham Oppy, is not strict monotheism, as it does not deny existence of other gods and their respective Atman.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Oppy (2014), Describing Gods, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107087040}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vedanta sub-schools of [[Vishishtadvaita Vedanta]] and [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]] combine ideas about Ātman from dual and non-dual schools.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Mimamsa school===
Ātman, in the ritualism-based [[Mīmāṃsā]] school of Hinduism, is an eternal, omnipresent, inherently active essence that is identified as I-consciousness.&lt;ref name=ptraju2&gt;PT Raju (2008), The Philosophical Traditions of India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415461214}}, pages 79-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chrisbartley&gt;Chris Bartley (2013), Purva Mimamsa, in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy (Editor: Oliver Leaman), Routledge, 978-0415862530, page 443-445&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike all other schools of Hinduism, Mimamsaka scholars considered ego and Atman as the same. Within Mimamsa school, there was divergence of beliefs. Kumārila, for example, believed that Atman is the object of I-consciousness, whereas Prabhakara believed that Atman is the subject of I-consciousness.&lt;ref name=ptraju2/&gt; Mimamsaka Hindus believed that what matters is virtuous actions and rituals completed with perfection, and it is this that creates merit and imprints knowledge on Atman, whether one is aware or not aware of Atman. Their foremost emphasis was formulation and understanding of laws/duties/virtuous life ([[dharma]]) and consequent perfect execution of ''kriyas'' (actions). The Upanishadic discussion of Atman, to them, was of secondary importance.&lt;ref name=chrisbartley/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (2006), Shruti, in Encyclopaedia of Asian Philosophy, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415862530}}, page 503&lt;/ref&gt; While other schools disagreed and discarded the Atma theory of Mimamsa, they incorporated Mimamsa theories on ethics, self-discipline, action, and dharma as necessary in one's journey toward knowing one's Atman.&lt;ref&gt;PT Raju (2008), The Philosophical Traditions of India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415461214}}, pages 82-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PT Raju (1985), Structural Depths of Indian Thought, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887061394}}, pages 54-63; Michael C.

===Vaiśeṣika school===
The [[Vaisheshika]] school of Hinduism, using its non-theistic theories of atomistic [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]], posits that Ātman is one of the four eternal non-physical&lt;ref&gt;The school posits that there are five physical substances: earth, water, air, water and ''akasa'' (ether/sky/space beyond air)&lt;/ref&gt; substances without attributes, the other three being ''kala'' (time), ''dik'' (space) and ''manas'' (mind).&lt;ref name=sarachmo&gt;Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Charles A. Moore (Eds., 1973), A Sourcebook in Indian Philosophy, Princeton University Press, Reprinted in 1973, {{ISBN|978-0691019581}}, pages 386-423&lt;/ref&gt; Time and space, stated Vaiśeṣika scholars, are ''eka'' (one), ''nitya'' (eternal) and ''vibhu'' (all pervading). Time and space are indivisible reality, but human mind prefers to divide them to comprehend past, present, future, relative place of other substances and beings, direction and its own coordinates in the universe. In contrast to these characteristics of time and space, Vaiśeṣika scholars considered Ātman to be many, eternal, independent and spiritual substances that cannot be reduced or inferred from other three non-physical and five physical ''dravya'' (substances).&lt;ref name=sarachmo/&gt; Mind and sensory organs are instruments, while consciousness is the domain of "atman, soul, self".&lt;ref name=sarachmo/&gt;

The knowledge of Ātman, to Vaiśeṣika Hindus, is another knowledge without any "bliss" or "consciousness" moksha state that Vedanta and Yoga school describe.&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt;

===Nyaya school===
Early atheistic [[Nyaya]] scholars, and later theistic Nyaya scholars, both made substantial contributions to the systematic study of Ātman.&lt;ref name=johnplott2/&gt; They posited that even though "self/soul" is intimately related to the knower, it can still be the subject of knowledge. John Plott&lt;ref name=johnplott2&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, page 62&lt;/ref&gt; states that the Nyaya scholars developed a theory of negation that far exceeds [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]'s theory of [[negation]], while their epistemological theories refined to "know the knower" at least equals Aristotle's sophistication. Nyaya methodology influenced all major schools of Hinduism.

The Nyaya scholars defined Ātman as an imperceptible substance that is the substrate of human consciousness, manifesting itself with or without qualities such as desires, feelings, perception, knowledge, understanding, errors, insights, sufferings, bliss, and others.&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;KK Chakrabarti (1999), Classical Indian Philosophy of Mind: The Nyaya Dualist Tradition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791441718}}, pages 2, 187-188, 220&lt;/ref&gt; Nyaya school not only developed its theory of Atman, it contributed to Hindu philosophy in a number of ways. To the Hindu theory of Ātman, the contributions of Nyaya scholars were twofold. One, they went beyond holding it as "self evident" and offered rational proofs, consistent with their epistemology, in their debates with Buddhists, that "Atman exists".&lt;ref name=nyayaexamples/&gt; Second, they developed theories on what "Atman is and is not".&lt;ref name=royperrett&gt;Roy W. Perrett (Editor, 2000), Indian Philosophy: Metaphysics, Volume 3, Taylor &amp; Francis, {{ISBN|978-0815336082}}, page xvii; also see Chakrabarti pages 279-292&lt;/ref&gt; As proofs for the proposition "self/soul exists", for example, Nyaya scholars argued that personal recollections and memories of the form "I did this so many years ago" implicitly presume that there is a self that is substantial, continuing, unchanged, and existent.&lt;ref name=nyayaexamples&gt;See example discussed in this section; For additional examples of Nyaya reasoning to prove that "soul exists", using propositions and its theories of negation, see: [https://archive.org/stream/TheNyayaSutrasOfGotama/Vidyabhusana_Nyaya-Sutras_1913#page/n39/mode/2up Nyayasutra] verses 1.2.1 on pages 14-15, 1.2.59 on page 20, 3.1.1-3.1.27 on pages 63-69, and later chapters&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=royperrett/&gt;

[[Nyāya Sūtras|Nyayasutra]], a 2nd-century CE foundational text of Nyaya school of Hinduism, states that the soul is a proper object of human knowledge. It also states that soul is a real substance that can be inferred from certain signs, objectively perceivable attributes. For example, in book 1, chapter 1, verses 9 and 10, Nyayasutra states&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt;

{{Quote|
''Ātman'', body, senses, objects of senses, intellect, mind, activity, error, ''pretyabhava'' (after life), fruit, suffering and bliss are the objects of right knowledge.&lt;br&gt;
Desire, aversion, effort, happiness, suffering and cognition are the ''Linga'' (लिङ्ग, mark, sign) of the ''Ātman''.

In book 2, chapter 1, verses 1 to 23, Nyayasutras text posits that the sensory act of looking is different than perception and cognition, that perception and knowledge arise from the seekings and actions of Ātman (soul).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/TheNyayaSutrasOfGotama/Vidyabhusana_Nyaya-Sutras_1913#page/n47/mode/2up Nyayasutra] see pages 22-29&lt;/ref&gt; Naiyayikas emphasize that Ātman has qualities, but is different than its qualities. For example, desire is one of many quality of Ātman in Nyaya school, but they state that Ātman need not always have desire, and in the state of liberation, for instance, Atman is without desire.&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt; Atman is the object, and the conventional "I, me" is one of its subjects, to Nyaya school.&lt;ref name=elisa/&gt;

===Samkhya school===
The concept of Ātman in [[Samkhya]], the oldest school of Hinduism, is quite similar to one in Advaita Vedanta school. Both Samkhya and Advaita consider the ego (asmita, [[ahamkara]]) rather than the Ātman to be the cause of pleasure and pain.&lt;ref&gt;Paranjpe, A. C. Self and Identity in Modern Psychology and Indian Thought. Springer; 1 edition (September 30, 1998). P. 263-264. {{ISBN|978-0-306-45844-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They both consider Ātman as self, soul that is innermost essence of any individual being. Further, they both consider self-knowledge as the means of liberation, freedom and bliss. The difference between Samkhya and Advaita is that Samkhya holds there are as many ''Atmans'' as there are beings, each distinct reality unto itself, and self-knowledge a state of Ipseity. In contrast, the monism theme of Advaita holds that there is one soul, and that the self of all beings are connected and unified with Brahman.&lt;ref name=johnplott/&gt; The essence and spirit of everything is related to each self, asserts Advaita Vedanta, and each Atman is related to the essence and spirit of everything; all is one; self is Brahman and Brahman is self. Samkhya asserts that each being's Atman is unique and different.&lt;ref name=johnplott&gt;John C. Plott et al (2000), Global History of Philosophy: The Axial Age, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120801585}}, pages 60-62&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoga school===
The Yogasutra of Patanjali, the foundational text of [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] school of Hinduism, mentions ''Atma'' in multiple verses, and particularly in its last book, where Samadhi is described as the path to self-knowledge and [[moksha|kaivalya]]. Some earlier mentions of Atman in Yogasutra include verse 2.5, where evidence of ignorance includes "confusing what is not Atman as Atman".

Avidya (अविद्या, ignorance) is regarding the transient as eternal, the impure as pure, the pain-giving as joy-giving, and the non-Atman as Atman.
|Yogasutra 2.5&lt;ref name=pyogas3t&gt;

In verses 2.19-2.20, Yogasutra declares that pure ideas are the domain of the soul, the perceivable universe exists to enlighten the soul, but while the soul is pure, it may be deceived by complexities of perception or its intellect. These verses also set the purpose of all experience as a means to self-knowledge.

{{quote|
द्रष्टा दृशिमात्रः शुद्धोऽपि प्रत्ययानुपश्यः&lt;br&gt;
तदर्थ एव दृश्यस्यात्मा

The seer (soul) is the absolute knower. Though pure, modifications are witnessed by him by coloring of intellect.&lt;br&gt;
The spectacle exists only to serve the purpose of the Atman.
|Yogasutra 2.19 - 2.20&lt;ref name=pyogas3t/&gt;}}

In Book 4, Yogasutra states spiritual liberation as the stage where the yogin achieves distinguishing self-knowledge, he no longer confuses his mind as his soul, the mind is no longer affected by afflictions or worries of any kind, ignorance vanishes, and "pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature".&lt;ref name=pyogas3t/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verses 4.24-4.34, Patanjali's Yogasutras; Quote: "विशेषदर्शिन '''आत्म'''भावभावनाविनिवृत्तिः"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Yoga school is similar to the Samkhya school in its conceptual foundations of Ātman. It is the self that is discovered and realized in the Kaivalya state, in both schools. Like Samkhya, this is not a single universal Ātman. It is one of the many individual selves where each "pure consciousness settles in its own pure nature", as a unique distinct soul/self.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Phillips, ''Classical Indian Metaphysics: Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of "new Logic".'' Open Court Publishing, 1995, pages 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Yoga school's methodology was widely influential on other schools of Hindu philosophy. Vedanta monism, for example, adopted Yoga as a means to reach ''Jivanmukti'' – self-realization in this life – as conceptualized in Advaita Vedanta.

==Influence of Atman theory on Hindu Ethics==
[[File:Non violence sculpture by carl fredrik reutersward malmo sweden.jpg|220px|thumb|[[Ahimsa]], non-violence, is considered the highest ethical value and virtue in Hinduism.&lt;ref name=evpc&gt;Stephen H. Phillips &amp; other authors (2008), in Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, &amp; Conflict (Second Edition), {{ISBN|978-0123739858}}, Elsevier Science, Pages 1347–1356, 701-849, 1867&lt;/ref&gt; The virtue of Ahimsa follows from the Atman theories of Hindu traditions.&lt;ref name=ludwig/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NF Gier (1995), Ahimsa, the Self, and Postmodernism, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 35, Issue 1, pages 71-86, {{doi|10.5840/ipq199535160}};&lt;br&gt;Jean Varenne (1977), Yoga and the Hindu Tradition, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226851167}}, page 200-202&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The Atman theory in Upanishads had a profound impact on ancient ethical theories and dharma traditions now known as Hinduism.&lt;ref name=ludwig&gt;Ludwig Alsdorf (2010), The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415548243}}, pages 111-114&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest [[Dharmaśāstra#The meaning and sources of Dharma|Dharmasutras]] of Hindus recite Atman theory from the Vedic texts and Upanishads,&lt;ref&gt;These ancient texts of India refer to Upanishads and Vedic era texts some of which have been traced to preserved documents, but some are lost or yet to be found.&lt;/ref&gt; and on its foundation build precepts of dharma, laws and ethics. Atman theory, particularly the Advaita Vedanta and Yoga versions, influenced the emergence of the theory of [[Ahimsa]] (non-violence against all creatures), culture of vegetarianism, and other theories of ethical, dharmic life.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen H. Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|978-0231144858}}, pages 122-125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knut Jacobsen (1994), The institutionalization of the ethics of “non-injury” toward all “beings” in Ancient India, Environmental Ethics, Volume 16, Issue 3, pages 287-301, {{doi|10.5840/enviroethics199416318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dharma-sutras===
The Dharmasutras and Dharmasastras integrate the teachings of Atman theory. Apastamba Dharmasutra, the oldest known Indian text on dharma, for example, titles Chapters 1.8.22 and 1.8.23 as "Knowledge of the Atman" and then recites,&lt;ref name=apastamba1&gt;Sanskrit Original: [http://www.hinduonline.co/vedicreserve/kalpa/dharma/apastamba_dharma_sutra.pdf Apastamba Dharma Sutra] page 14;&lt;br&gt;'''English Translation 1''': [https://archive.org/stream/sacredlawsofarya00buhliala#page/n139/mode/2up Knowledge of the Atman] Apastamba Dharmasutra, The Sacred Laws of the Aryas, [[Georg Bühler]] (Translator), pages 75-79;&lt;br&gt;'''English Translation 2''': Ludwig Alsdorf (2010), The History of Vegetarianism and Cow-Veneration in India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415548243}}, pages 111-112;&lt;br&gt;'''English Translation 3''': [[Patrick Olivelle]] (1999), Dharmasutras, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0192838827}}, page 34&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ahimsa===
The ethical prohibition against harming any human beings or other living creatures (Ahimsa, अहिंसा), in Hindu traditions, can be traced to the Atman theory.&lt;ref name=ludwig/&gt; This precept against injuring any living being appears together with Atman theory in hymn 8.15.1 of Chandogya Upanishad (ca. 8th century BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit original: तधैतद्ब्रह्मा प्रजापतये उवाच प्रजापतिर्मनवे मनुः प्रजाभ्यः आचार्यकुलाद्वेदमधीत्य यथाविधानं गुरोः कर्मातिशेषेणाभिसमावृत्य कुटुम्बे शुचौ देशे स्वाध्यायमधीयानो धर्मिकान्विदधदात्मनि सर्वैन्द्रियाणि संप्रतिष्ठा'''प्याहिँस'''न्सर्व भूतान्यन्यत्र तीर्थेभ्यः स खल्वेवं वर्तयन्यावदायुषं ब्रह्मलोकमभिसंपद्यते न च पुनरावर्तते न च पुनरावर्तते ॥१॥; [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/छान्दोग्योपनिषद्_४ छान्दोग्योपनिषद् ४] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English Translation: Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, page 205&lt;/ref&gt; then becomes central in the texts of Hindu philosophy, entering the dharma codes of ancient ''Dharmasutras'' and later era ''Manu-Smriti''. Ahimsa theory is a natural corollary and consequence of "Atman is universal oneness, present in all living beings. Atman connects and prevades in everyone. Hurting or injuring another being is hurting the Atman, and thus one's self that exists in another body". This conceptual connection between one's Atman, the universal, and Ahimsa starts in [[Isha Upanishad]],&lt;ref name=ludwig/&gt; develops in the theories of the ancient scholar Yajnavalkya, and one which inspired [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]] as he led non-violent movement against colonialism in early 20th century.&lt;ref name=maxmullerisha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deen K.

==Atman – the difference between Hinduism and Buddhism==
{{See also|Anatta|Buddha-nature| Shentong |Sunyata|Precanonical Buddhism}}

All orthodox schools of Hinduism hold the premise, "Atman exists, as self evident truth". Buddhism, in contrast, holds the premise, "Atman does not exist (or, An-atman) as self evident".&lt;ref&gt;Dae-Sook Suh (1994), Korean Studies: New Pacific Currents, University of Hawaii Press, {{ISBN|978-0824815981}}, page 171&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=johnplott3&gt;John C.

As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism".&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhists do not believe that at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is any "eternal, essential and absolute something called a soul, self or atman".&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt; Buddhists reject the concept and all doctrines associated with atman, call atman as illusion (''maya''), asserting instead the theory of "no-self" and "no-soul".&lt;ref name=johnplott3/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen J Baroni (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Zen Buddhism, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823922406}}, page 14&lt;/ref&gt; Buddhism, from its earliest days, has denied the existence of the "self, soul" in its core philosophical and ontological texts. In its soteriological themes, Buddhism has defined [[nirvana]] as that blissful state when a person realizes that he or she has "no self, no soul".&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, Volume 23, Issue 1, pages 65-74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Collins |title=Selfless Persons: Imagery and Thought in Theravada Buddhism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8sLMkNn26-gC |year=1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-39726-1 |page=82}}; '''Quote:''' "It is at this point that the differences [between Upanishads and Abhidharma] start to become marked. There is no central self which animates the impersonal elements. The concept of nirvana (Pali ''nibbana''), although similarly the criterion according to which ethical judgements are made and religious life assessed, is not the liberated state of a self. Like all other things and concepts (''dhamma'') it is ''anatta'', not-self [in Buddhism].";&lt;br&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman C.

Literally meaning no (an-) self or soul (-atman), this Buddhist term applies to the denial of a metaphysically changeless, eternal and autonomous soul or self. (...) The early canonical Buddhist view of nirvana sometimes suggests a kind of extinction-like (kataleptic) state that automatically encourages a metaphysical no-soul (self)."&lt;/ref&gt;

Hindus believe in Atman. They hold that at the core of all human beings and living creatures, there is "eternal, innermost essential and absolute something called a soul, self that is atman."&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt; Within the diverse [[Hindu philosophy|schools of Hinduism]], there are differences of opinion on whether souls are distinct, whether a supreme soul or god exists, whether the nature of Atman is dual or non-dual, how to reach [[moksha]]– the knowledge of self that liberates one to blissful content state of existence, and whether moksha is achievable in this life (Advaita Vedanta, Yoga) or is achievable only in after-life (Dvaita Vedanta, Nyaya). However, despite these diversity of ideas and paths in different schools of Hinduism, unlike Buddhism, the foundation premise of Hinduism is that "soul/self exists", and there is bliss in seeking self, knowing self, and self-realization.&lt;ref name=4sources/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sengaku Mayeda (2000), Sankara and Buddhism, in New Perspectives on Advaita Vedānta (Editors: Richard V.

{{Quote|
While the ''[[Upanishad]]s'' recognized many things as being not-Self, they felt that a real, true Self could be found. They held that when it was found, and known to be identical to Brahman, the basis of everything, this would bring liberation. In the Buddhist ''[[Buddhist texts|Suttas]]'', though, literally everything is seen is non-Self, even [[Nirvana]]. When this is known, then liberation – ''Nirvana'' – is attained by total non-attachment. Thus both the ''Upanishads'' and the Buddhist ''Suttas'' see many things as not-Self, but the Suttas apply it, indeed non-Self, to ''everything''.

In Theravada tradition, the [[Dhammakaya Movement]] in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of ''anatta'' (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the "true self" or ''[[Dharmakaya|dhammakaya]]''.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=100–5, 110}} Similar interpretations have been put forth by the then [[Sangharaja of Thailand|Thai Sangharaja]] in 1939. According to Williams, the Sangharaja's interpretation echoes the ''[[tathagatagarbha|tathāgatagarbha]]'' sutras.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=126}} The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is [[Atman (Buddhism)|atta (atman)]] in 1999, has been criticized as heretical in Buddhism by [[Prayudh Payutto|Ven.

According to Johannes Bronkhorst, a professor of Indology specializing in early Buddhism and Hinduism, while there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AZbZDP8MRJoC|year=1993|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1114-0 |pages=99 with footnote 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
There is not what could be called a philosophical system in these Upanishads. They are, in the true sense of the word, guesses at truth, frequently contradicting each other, yet all tending in one direction. The key-note of the old Upanishads is "know thyself," but with a much deeper meaning than that of the ''γνῶθι σεαυτόν'' of the [[Know thyself|Delphic Oracle]]. The "know thyself" of the Upanishads means, know thy true self, that which underlines thine Ego, and find it and know it in the highest, the eternal Self, the One without a second, which underlies the whole world.
