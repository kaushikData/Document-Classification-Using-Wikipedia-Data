{{tone|date=October 2015}}
An '''absurdity''' is a thing that is extremely [[reason|unreasonable]], so as to be [[Foolishness|foolish]] or not taken [[Seriousness|seriously]], or the state of being so. "Absurd" is an adjective used to describe an absurdity, e.g., "Tyler and the boys laughed at the absurdity of the situation." "this encyclopedia article is absurd".&lt;ref name=WD&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/absurd?show=0&amp;t=1296966875 Webster's Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It derives from the Latin ''absurdum'' meaning "[[out of tune]]", hence irrational.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordreference.com/definition/absurdities Wordreference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin ''surdus'' means "[[deaf]]", implying [[stupidity]].&lt;ref name=WD/&gt;
Absurdity is contrasted with [[seriousness]] in reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.com/browse/laughable Thesaurus.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In general usage, absurdity may be synonymous with [[ridiculous]]ness and [[nonsense]]. In specialized usage, absurdity is related to extremes in bad reasoning or pointlessness in reasoning; ridiculousness is related to extremes of incongruous juxtaposition, laughter, and ridicule; and nonsense is related to a lack of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaningfulness]]. [[Absurdism]] is a concept in philosophy related to the notion of absurdity.

== History ==
Absurdity has been used throughout western history regarding foolishness and extremely poor reasoning to form belief.&lt;ref name=AWTD&gt;Absurdities – Webster’s Timeline Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Ancient Greece ===
In [[Aristophanes]]' 5th century BC comedy ''[[The Wasps]]'', his protagonist [[Philocleon]] learned the "absurdities" of [[Aesop's Fables]], considered to be unreasonable fantasy, and not true.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wasps'', Parmenides&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] often used "absurdity" to describe very poor reasoning, or the conclusion from adopting a position that is false and reasoning to a false conclusion, called an "absurdity" (argument by reductio ad absurdum). Plato describes himself as not using absurd argumentation against himself in [[Parmenides]].&lt;ref&gt;''Parmenides'', Plato&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Gorgias]], Plato refers to an "inevitable absurdity" as the outcome of reasoning from a false assumption.&lt;ref&gt;''Gorgias'', Plato&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] rectified an irrational absurdity in reasoning with empiricism using [[likelihood]], "once the irrational has been introduced and an air of likelihood imparted to it, we must accept it in spite of the absurdity.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Aristotle in Poetics, S.H. Butcher&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that absurdity in reasoning being veiled by charming language in poetry, "As it is, the absurdity is veiled by the poetic charm with which the poet invests it… But in the Epic poem the absurdity passes unnoticed."&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

=== Renaissance and early modern periods ===
[[Michel de Montaigne]], father of the [[essay]] and modern [[skepticism]], argued that the process of abridgement is foolish and produces absurdity, "Every abridgement of a good book is a foolish abridgement… absurdity &lt;nowiki&gt;[is]&lt;/nowiki&gt; not to be cured… satisfied with itself than any reason, can reasonably be."&lt;ref&gt;''The Essays of Michel De Montaigne'', Michel de Montaigne name&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Bacon]], an early promoter of [[empiricism]] and the scientific method, argued that absurdity should not always be laughed at, since it is a necessary component of scientific progress, where bold new ways of thinking and bold hypotheses often led to absurdity, "For if absurdity be the subject of laughter, doubt you but great [[WP:Bold|boldness]] is seldom without some absurdity."&lt;ref&gt;Essays, Francis Bacon&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hobbes' ''Table of Absurdity'' ====
[[Thomas Hobbes]] distinguished absurdity from errors, including basic linguistic errors as when a word is simply used to refer to something which does not have that name. According to [[Aloysius Martinich]]: "What Hobbes is worried about is absurdity. Only human beings can embrace an absurdity, because only human beings have language, and philosophers are more susceptible to it than others".&lt;ref name=HD&gt;{{Citation|last=Martinich|first=Aloysius|year=1995|title=Hobbes Dictionary|publisher=Blackwell}} page 27, citing ''[[Leviathan]]'' 5.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hobbes wrote that "words whereby we conceive nothing but the sound, are those we call absurd, insignificant, and nonsense. And therefore if a man should talk to me of a round quadrangle; or, accidents of bread in cheese; or, immaterial substances; or of a free subject; a free will; or any free, but free from being hindered by opposition, I should not say he were in an error, but that his words were without meaning, that is to say, absurd".&lt;ref name=L&gt;''[[Leviathan]]'', [http://oll.libertyfund.org/index.php?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=585&amp;layout=html#chapter_89826 Chapter V].&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished seven types of absurdity. Below is the summary of Martinich, based on what he describes as Hobbes' "mature account" found in ''"De Corpore"'' 5., which all use examples that could be found in Aristotelian or scholastic philosophy, and all reflect "Hobbes' commitment to the new science of [[Galileo]] and [[William Harvey|Harvey]]". This is known as "Hobbes' Table of Absurdity".
#"Combining the name of a body with the name of an accident." For example, "existence is a being" or, "a being is existence". These absurdities are typical of [[scholastic philosophy]] according to Hobbes.
#"Combining the name of a body with the name of a phantasm." For example, "a ghost is a body".
#"Combining the name of a body with the name of a name." For example, "a universal is a thing".
#"Combining the name of an accident with the name of a phantasm." For example, "colour appears to a perceiver".
#"Combining the name of an accident with the name of a name." For example, "a definition is the [[essence]] of a thing".
#"Combining the name of a phantasm with the name of a name." For example, "the idea of a man is a universal".
#"Combining the name of a thing with the name of a speech act." For example, "some entities are beings ''per se''".

According to Martinich, [[Gilbert Ryle]] discussed the types of problem Hobbes refers to as absurdities under the term "[[category error]]".

Although common usage now considers "absurdity" to be synonymous with "[[ridiculous]]ness", Hobbes discussed the two concepts as different, in that absurdity is viewed as having to do with invalid reasoning,&lt;ref name=HD/&gt;&lt;ref name=L/&gt; while ridiculousness has to do with [[laughter]], [[superior (hierarchy)|superiority]], and [[deformity]].&lt;ref&gt;The Perception of Humor, Willibald Ruch, Emotions, qualia, and consciousness, Biocybernetics, VOl. 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How Many Feminists Does It Take To Make A Joke?

== Demarcation with sound reasoning ==
Medical commentators have criticized  methods and reasoning in [[alternative and complementary medicine]] and [[integrative medicine]] as being either absurdities, or being between [[evidence]] and absurdity, often misleading the public with euphemistic terminology such as the expressions "alternative medicine" and "complementary medicine", and calling for a clear demarcation between valid scientific evidence and [[scientific method]]ology and absurdity.&lt;ref&gt;"Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Between Evidence and Absurdity", ''Perspectives in Biology and Medicine'', Volume 52, Number 2, Spring 2009, pp. 289–303, Edzard Ernst&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Propagation of the Absurd: demarcation of the Absurd revisited", Wallace Sampson, Kimball Atwood IV, ''The Medical Journal of Australia'', 183 (11/12)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Humor ==
{{Further|Theory of humor|Absurdist humor}}
{{quote|"I can see nothing" – Alice in Wonderland
::"My, you must have good eyes" – Cheshire Cat}}
Absurdity is used in [[theory of humor|humor]] to make people laugh or to make a sophisticated point, for example in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s "[[Jabberwocky]]", a poem of nonsense verse, originally featured as a part of his absurdist novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]'' (1872); Carroll was a logician and parodied [[logic]] using illogic and inverting logical methods.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4334590 ''Wonderland Revisited'', Harry Levin]&lt;/ref&gt;
Argentine novelist [[Jorge Luis Borges]] used absurdities in his short stories to make points.&lt;ref&gt;''"to justify this 'absurdity' is the primordial object of this note"'', Labyrinths, Jorge Luis Borges, p. 39, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wtPxGztYx-UC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=Borges+Absurdity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yyqv5MUbM8&amp;sig=6wj59dP1zrXuD1kparLFIOpFkDY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=975VTbTSC4WosQOH2rH4BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' is considered absurdist by some.&lt;ref&gt;"On the Absurdity of Kafka's Works from Transformer", G Yan-li, ''Journal of Yunyang Teachers College'', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
[[Psychology|Psychologists]] study how humans adapt to constant absurdities in life.&lt;ref&gt;''The psychology of adaptation to absurdity: tactics of make-believe'', by Seymour Fisher, Rhoda Lee Fisher, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kejcgoDXJDwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=absurdity&amp;ots=eKERP2kuuX&amp;sig=ZpvYE8ZEzNwRGsxY_lT1nuopN9Q#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advertising ===
In [[advertising]], the presence or absence of an absurd image was found to moderate negative attitudes toward products and increase product recognition.&lt;ref&gt;"Effects of Absurdity in Advertising: The Moderating Role of Product Category Attitude and the Mediating Role of Cognitive Responses", ''Journal of Advertising'', 2000, Leopold Arias-Bolzmann, Goutam Chakraborty, John C. Mowen, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4189133]&lt;/ref&gt;
==Rhetoric==
Absurdity arises when one’s own speech deviates from common sense, is too poetic, or when one is unable to defend themselves with speech and reason. In Aristotle’s book [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]], Aristotle discusses the situations in which absurdity is employed and how it affects one’s use of persuasion. The idea of a man being unable to persuade someone by his words is absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Honeycutt|first=Lee|title=Aristotle's Rhetoric|url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-1.html|publisher=Alpine Lakes Design|accessdate=October 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008201141/http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet1-1.html|archive-date=2014-10-08|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, a speech should not be too poetic because it imports absurdity and tastelessness to a speech. Any unnecessary information to the case is unreasonable and makes the speech unclear. If the speech becomes too unclear; the justification for their case becomes unpersuasive, making the argument absurd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Honeycutt|first=Lee|title=Aritotle's Rhetoric|url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet3-3.html|publisher=Alpine Lakes Design|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Legal ==&lt;!--'Doctrine of absurdity' redirects here--&gt;
The absurdity doctrine is a legal theory in American courts.&lt;ref name=Scalia2012&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scalia |first1=Antonin  |last2=Garne |first2=Bryan A.  |date=2012 |title=Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts|trans-title= |url= |format= |language= |location= |publisher= |isbn=9780314275554 |via= |subscription= |quote=A provision may be either disregarded or judicially corrected as an error (when the correrection is textually simple) if failing to do so would result in a disposition that no reasonable person could approve.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|234-239}} One type of absurdity, known as the "[[Clerical error|scrivener's error]]", occurs when simple textual correction is needed to amend an obvious clerical error, such as a misspelled word.&lt;ref name=Scalia2012/&gt;{{rp|234-235}} Another type of absurdity, called "evaluative absurdity", arises when a legal provision, despite appropriate spelling and grammar, "makes no substantive sense". An example would be a statute that mistakenly provided for a ''winning'' rather than ''losing'' party to pay the other side's reasonable attorney's fees.&lt;ref name=Scalia2012/&gt;{{rp|235-237}} In order to stay within the remit of [[textualism]] and not reach further into [[purposivism]], the doctrine is restricted by two limiting principles: "...the absurdity and the injustice of applying the provision to the case would be so monstrous, that all mankind would, without hesitation, unite in rejecting the application"&lt;ref&gt;Story, Joseph.

== Philosophy ==
{{Further|Absurdism}}
It is illogical to seek purpose or meaning in an uncaring world without purpose or meaning, or to accumulate excessive wealth in the face of certain death. Absurdity is used in existentialist and related philosophy to describe absurdly pointless efforts to try to find such meaning or purpose in an objective and uncaring world, a philosophy known as [[absurdism]].{{cn|date=October 2016}}

In his paper, ''The Absurd'', [[Thomas Nagel]] analyzed the perpetual absurdity of human life. Absurdity in life becomes apparent when we realize the fact that we take our lives seriously, while simultaneously perceiving that there is a certain arbitrarity in everything we do.  He suggests never to stop searching for the absurd.  Furthermore, he suggests searching for irony amongst the absurdity.{{cn|date=October 2016}} 
=== Philosophy of language ===
{{Further|Moore's paradox}}
[[G. E. Moore]], an English [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]], cited as a paradox of language such superficially absurd statements as, "I went to the pictures last Tuesday but I don't believe it", which can be true and logically consistent, and which are not contradictory on further consideration of the user's linguistic intent. [[Wittgenstein]] observes that in some unusual circumstances absurdity itself disappears in such statements, as there are cases where "It is raining but I don't believe it" can make sense, i.e., what appears to be an absurdity is not nonsense.&lt;ref&gt;Wittgensteinian Accounts of Moorean Absurdity,  Philosophical Studies, Volume 92, Number 3, John N. Williams, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/t77l87484l2860mu/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theater of the Absurd ===
The [[Theater of the Absurd]] was a [[surrealist]] movement demonstrating [[motif (narrative)|motif]]s of absurdism.

== Logic and computer science ==
=== ''Reductio ad absurdum'' ===
[[Reductio ad absurdum]], reducing to an absurdity, is a method of proof in polemics, logic and [[mathematics]], whereby assuming that a proposition is true leads to absurdity; a proposition is assumed to be true and this is used to deduce a proposition known to be false, therefore the original proposition must have been false. It is also an argumentation style in [[polemics]], whereby a position is demonstrated to be false, or "absurd", by assuming it and reasoning to reach something known to be believed to be false or to violate common sense; e.g., as used by Plato to argue against other philosophical positions.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Reduction to Absurdity, Yao-yong, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
An [[absurdity constraint]] is used in the logic of [[model transformation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A Constructive Approach to Testing Model Transformations, Theory and Practice of Model Transformations, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2010, Volume 6142/2010, 77-92, {{doi|10.1007/978-3-642-13688-7_6}}, Camillo Fiorentini, Alberto Momigliano, Mario Ornaghi, Iman Poernomo, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n572730744340m56/]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Constant in logic ===
The "absurdity constant" is used in formal logic.&lt;ref&gt;''Classical harmony'', Notre Dame Journal of Formal Logic, Volume 27, Number 4 (1986), 459-482, Alan Weir&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rule in logic ===
The absurdity rule is a rule in logic, as used by [[Patrick Suppes]] in ''Logic, methodology and philosophy of science: Proceedings''.&lt;ref&gt;''Logic, methodology and philosophy of science: Proceedings'', Patrick Suppes [https://books.google.com/books?id=QUgmsMm5LcAC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;lpg=PA243&amp;dq=Absurdity+constant+Suppes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xkoEeQ8WGF&amp;sig=9S55s11JoR22Pov8IGBHV7qKhXA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Eh9kTa_ZDo-ssAPoksygCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwAA#]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology ==
{{Quote|"I believe because it is absurd"|Tertullian}}
Absurdity is cited as a basis for some theological reasoning about formation of belief and faith, such as in [[fideism]], an [[epistemological]] theory that reason and faith may be hostile to each other. The statement ''"[[Credo quia absurdum]]"'' ("I believe because it is absurd") is attributed to [[Tertullian]] from ''[[De Carne Christi]]'', as translated by philosopher [[Voltaire]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Philosophical Dictionary: From the French'', Voltaire&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[New Advent Church]], what Tertullian actually says in DCC 5 is "... the Son of God died; it is by all means to be believed, because it is absurd."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0315.htm On the Flesh of Christ, Fathers of the Church, New Advent]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 15th century, the Spanish theologian [[Tostatus]] used what he thought was a reduction to absurdity arguing against a spherical earth using dogma, arguing that a spherical earth would imply the existence of [[antipodes]], which would be impossible since this would require either that Christ has appeared twice, or that the inhabitants of the antipodes would be forever damned, which he claimed was an absurdity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Absurdity can refer to any strict religious dogma that pushes something to the point of violating common sense. For example, inflexible religious dictates are sometimes termed [[pharisaism]], referring to unreasonable emphasis on observing exact words or rules, rather than the intent or spirit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic "Pharisaic", Your Diciontionary.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718143857/http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It was Pharisaic in its ritualism and… asceticism… proclaiming a doctrine of absurdity to the enlightened pagan", ''The Churches of the New Testament'', George W. McDaniel, 1921&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic Your Dictionary.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718143857/http://www.yourdictionary.com/pharisaic |date=July 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Willet]] grouped absurdities with "flat contradictions to scripture" and "heresies".&lt;ref&gt;The doctrines and practices of the Church of Rome truly represented, John Gother, 1593&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], '''acting white''' is a [[pejorative]] term, usually applied to [[black people]], which refers to a person's perceived betrayal of their culture by assuming the social expectations of [[white people|white society]].&lt;ref name=next/&gt;&lt;ref name=weigh/&gt; [[Educational attainment in the United States|Success in education]] in particular (depending on one's cultural background) can be seen as a form of "[[selling out]]" by being disloyal to one's culture.&lt;ref name=weigh/&gt;

The term is controversial, and its precise meaning is hard to define.&lt;ref name=next/&gt; Some minority students are discouraged from achieving in school by the negative prejudices of ethnic peers; such a view has been expressed in articles in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[Time Magazine|Time]]'' magazine, and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''—and by public figures and academics across the political spectrum.&lt;ref name=weigh/&gt;

==History of usage==
[[File:BillCosby.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Comedian and media figure [[Bill Cosby]] brought the term to wider knowledge in a 2004 speech.]]
The question of whether or not "acting white" attitudes are prevalent has been debated in academic literature.&lt;ref name=weigh/&gt; The black comedian and media figure, [[Bill Cosby]], used the term in what became a noted [[Pound Cake speech|May 2004 speech]] when he challenged the black community against the idea that gaining education was "acting white".&lt;ref name=paul/&gt; Black people accused of "acting white" are sometimes referred to as '''Black Anglo-Saxons''', a term coined by comedian [[Paul Mooney (comedian)|Paul Mooney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afropunk.ning.com/forum/topics/hollywood-a-harvester-of-coons|title=Hollywood|date=August 1, 2009|accessdate=August 10, 2009|publisher=[[Afropunk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case studies and research==

Not all scholars define ''acting white'' in the same way. Most definitions include a reference to situations where some minority adolescents ridicule their peers for engaging in behaviors perceived to be characteristic of whites. In this scenario, they equate "white behavior" with high grades in school, a result researchers can quantify, but the term is not limited to this.&lt;ref name=nber/&gt;

In 1986, Signithia Fordham co-authored with Nigerian sociologist [[John Ogbu]] a study that concluded that high-performing African-American students in a [[Washington, D.C.]], high school borrowed from [[Cultural hegemony|hegemonic]] white culture as part of a strategy for achievement, while struggling to maintain a black identity. Ogbu made a related claim in his 2003 book, ''Black American Students in an Affluent Suburb: A Study of Academic Disengagement,'' concluding that black students' own cultural attitudes sometimes hindered academic achievement and that these attitudes are too often neglected. Ogbu had earlier written in his seminal work ''Minority Education and Caste'' (1978), that school disengagement among caste-like minorities occurs because white society limits the job-success of their parents and others in their communities by a glass ceiling. In his new book, he said that non-whites "failed to observe the link between educational achievement and access to jobs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Carter|first= Prudence |title= Keepin' It Real: School Success Beyond Black and White |series=Transgressing Boundaries: Studies in Black Politics and Black Communities |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]], USA |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-19-516862-3|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 the scholars [[Philip J. Cook]] and Jens Ludwig published a report finding that blacks do not face any stronger social pressures than whites to succeed in school, nor do they have greater feelings of alienation towards education in general. They noted anecdotal and ethnographic research confirming that minority students hold these views, but they concluded that these are not inherently generalizable and do not substantially affect student behavior in the classroom. They labeled the issue "something of a distraction" from what they saw as more important educational reforms.&lt;ref name=weigh&gt;[[Philip J. Cook]] and [[Jens Ludwig]]. "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3325737 Weighing the "Burden of 'Acting White'": Are There Race Differences in Attitudes toward Education?]". ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management''. Vol. 16, No. 2 (Spring, 1997), pp. 256–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Ogbu's 1978 study's conclusion was widely discussed, a 2003 work also challenged its validity. In 2003, Karolyn Tyson, a sociologist, and [[William Darity, Jr.]], an economist, of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], conducted an 18-month study at 11 North Carolina schools. The study concluded that white and black students have essentially the same attitudes about scholastic achievement; students in both groups want to succeed in school and show higher levels of self-esteem when they do better in school. They compared attitudes identified as ''acting white'' to the normal [[adolescence|adolescent pains]] experienced in [[John Hughes (filmmaker)#Filmography|John Hughes' movies]].&lt;ref name=paul&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/12/magazine/12ACTING.html?ex=1260594000&amp;en=37bb3e44882a21bc&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland |publisher=''[[The New York Times Magazine]]''|title="Acting White" Myth, The|date=December 12, 2004|first=Paul|last=Tough|accessdate=August 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study [[Roland G. Fryer Jr|Roland G. Fryer, Jr.]] and Paul Torelli suggested that the phenomenon probably had little to no effect on students achieving at average levels, but might explain a significant role in the [[racial achievement gap in the United States|disparities between black and white students]] at high achievement levels.&lt;ref name=nber&gt;{{cite journal |first=Roland G., Jr. |last=Fryer |first2=Paul |last2=Torelli |title=An Empirical Analysis of 'Acting White' |journal=[[Journal of Public Economics]] |volume=94 |issue=5–6 |year=2010 |pages=380–396 |doi=10.1016/j.jpubeco.2009.10.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fryer has also written that, in contrast to Fordham and Ogbu's theory, "acting white" prejudices are actually more common the more [[racial integration|integrated]] the school, with [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black schools]] free of any effects. He found that groups such as [[Italian-Americans|Italian immigrants]] in [[West End, Boston|Boston’s West End]] and the [[Māori people|Maori]] of [[New Zealand]] display similar behaviors. He concluded that there is necessarily a trade-off between doing well and rejection by your peers when you come from a traditionally low-achieving group, especially when that group comes into contact with more outsiders.&lt;ref name=next/&gt;

A fundamental drawback of much of the research so far is that the people studied have been asked to rate their own [[popularity]] in the eyes of others, which naturally brings those scores into question.&lt;ref name=next/&gt;&lt;ref name=nerd/&gt; Roland G. Fryer, Jr. has remarked, "Asking teenagers whether they’re popular is like asking them if they’re having sex."&lt;ref name=nerd/&gt;

Stuart Buck, a lawyer, also explored this issue in ''Acting White: The Ironic Legacy of Desegregation'' (2010). He said that [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] black schools had featured teachers, counselors, and others of the same race as the student population, and the adults often acted as mentors to the students. Integration of many public schools since the mid- to late-20th century may have resulted in schools in which black students perceived they were controlled or dominated by whites. A black student trying to achieve high educational success may then be considered as trying to leave the minority group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Acting White': Stuart Buck interview|url=http://blog.beliefnet.com/roddreher/2010/05/acting-white-stuart-buck-interview.html#ixzz0sCDbjbjR|date=May 18, 2010|accessdate=June 28, 2010|author=[[Rod Dreher]]|publisher=[[Beliefnet.com]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100720194609/http://blog.beliefnet.com/roddreher/2010/05/acting-white-stuart-buck-interview.html| archivedate= 20 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margaret Beale Spencer]] and Vinay Harpalani (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Beale Spencer &amp; Vinay Harpalani, What Does “Acting White” Actually Mean?: Racial Identity, Adolescent Development, and Academic Achievement among Black Youth, in Minority Status, Oppositional Culture, and Schooling 222 (John U. Ogbu ed., 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; argue that usage of the term "acting white" by black teenagers does not reflect their cultural values; rather, it is a manifestation of their racial identity development, experienced in conjunction with normal adolescent hassles and peer pressure.  Spencer and Harpalani employ William E. Cross's (1991) Nigrescence framework and contend that black teenagers' use of "acting white" in relation to academic achievement is similar to white teenagers' use of the term "nerd": the only difference is that black teenagers express it in racialized terms, as in addition to normal teenage peer pressure, they are grappling with racial identity and what it means to be "black".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cross |first=W. E. |year=1991 |title=Shades of Black: Diversity in African American identity |location=Philadelphia |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=0-87722-759-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Expressions such as "acting white" may or may not reflect black teenagers' cultural values, and their usage is sometimes counterintuitive: for example, Ogbu (2003) himself documented one instance where a black teenage girl with natural hair was accused of "acting white" by her black peers because "like white people, she did not have to process her hair." These kind of examples show that accusations of "acting white" are not fundamentally about black cultural attributes (although such accusations may reflect these attributes).  Rather, "acting white" is just a manifestation of racial identity development for black children and teenagers, who are learning and defining for themselves what it means to be "black"—in conjunction with normal adolescent peer pressure and hassles. That is also why such accusations are less common among black adults, who have come to greater resolution regarding racial identity issues.

==Commentary==
Political observer [[John McWhorter]] has commented, "[t]eenagers have a variety of identities open to them for trying on anti-Establishment postures. White kids can be stoners or goths. Black kids can be 'nonwhite'." He interpreted those kids as black "[[nerd]]s". He stated that the ''acting white'' attitude developed as the creation of an "[[Other (philosophy)|Other]]" among newly [[racial integration|integrated]] African-American kids.&lt;ref name=nerd/&gt;

In their 2003 study, Tyson and Darity said that school staff and faculty who hold racist attitudes about the ability of black students use the ''acting white'' disparagement as a cover for disparities in student performance.&lt;ref name=paul/&gt; [[Shelby Steele]] wrote in ''[[Shelby Steele#Books|The Content of Our Character]]'' that what he identified as [[Middle class in the United States|middle-class]] black [[Value system|values]] are falsely viewed by the majority of blacks as "white," while they are [[Color blindness (race)|colorblind]]. He argued that this attitude is distinct from other issues of young blacks in [[Poverty in the United States|poverty]].&lt;ref name=weigh/&gt;

[[Kenji Yoshino]], a [[New York University School of Law]] professor, in his ''[[Covering: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights]]'' (2006), criticizes social pressures to conform to mainstream white culture. He said this violated African Americans' civil rights, and they can uphold their own social distinctions. He said they should be able to freely choose to identify with white culture if they wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Kenji Yoshino]]|title=[[Covering: The Hidden Assault on Our Civil Rights]]|year=2006|ISBN=978-0-375-50820-2|publisher=[[Random House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Arnett Ferguson, a professor at [[Smith College]], wrote in 2001 that white culture "ruthlessly excludes African American cultural modes as relevant and meaningful". She highlighted the insistence in schools of [[standard English]] over [[Black Vernacular English]] as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bad boys: public schools in the making of black masculinity|first=Ann Arnett|last=Ferguson|pages=204–205|ISBN=978-0-472-08849-2|year=2001|publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clarence Page]] made the comparison to [[crab mentality]] on ''[[The News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]'' in 2004:
{{quote|In African American folklore, the sea crab ranks among the dumbest of creatures who also offers a valuable lesson. When you catch a bucket or a basketful, you never have to put a lid on because when one of the creatures tries to get out, the others will just pull it back in. Some of our fellow human beings aren't much smarter than that. When they see you working hard to achieve your dreams, they'll make fun of you just for trying.&lt;ref name=page&gt;{{cite news|date=September 27, 2004 |title=Essay: Acting White |accessdate=August 10, 2009 |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/july-dec04/page_9-27.html |publisher=''[[News Hour with Jim Lehrer]]'' |author=[[Clarence Page]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522174354/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/essays/july-dec04/page_9-27.html |archivedate=May 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

==Accusations of "acting white"==

===Barack Obama===
Before Obama's election, [[Ralph Nader]], a longtime activist, in 2008 characterized the senator as "talking white".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jun/25/nader-critical-of-obama-for-trying-to-talk-white/ |title=Nader: Obama trying to "talk white" |publisher=''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' |accessdate=August 10, 2009 |first=M.E |last=Sprengelmeyer |date=June 25, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626145214/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/jun/25/nader-critical-of-obama-for-trying-to-talk-white/ |archivedate=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, one must note that Obama is also a [[mixed-race American]], with a [[White American]] mother and [[Kenyan]] father; he also has [[Cherokee]] descent.

Also, note that "talking white" is a form of a dialect. Who President Obama is speaking with may determine [[Code switching|the dialect he chooses to use]].

[[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Obama's presidential victory in the 2008 election]] and [[Public image of Barack Obama|public image]] prompted a public discussion about whether he would shift the ground of critics of 'acting white'. Commentators [[John McWhorter]] and [[Stephen J. Dubner]] have said that it might.&lt;ref name=freak&gt;{{cite news|url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/07/will-there-be-an-acting-obama-effect/|title=Will There Be an "Acting Obama" Effect?|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=August 10, 2009|date=November 7, 2008|author=[[Stephen J.

Obama strongly criticized the idea that achievement was limited to "acting white" in his [[2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address|keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention]]. He said that "children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white".&lt;ref name=next&gt;[http://educationnext.org/actingwhite/ "Acting White"].

===Russell Wilson===
[[Seattle Seahawks]] football player [[Russell Wilson]] came under fire in 2014 when anonymous sources alleged that the feeling in the Seahawks locker room was that Wilson lacked "blackness". CBS Sports cited this conflict as a possible reason for the trading of star player{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} [[Percy Harvin]] from the Seahawks to the [[New York Jets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Ryan |url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/24765777/reports-some-teammates-say-russell-wilson-isnt-black-enough |title=Reports: Some teammates think QB Russell Wilson isn't black enough |publisher=CBSSports.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8978">The '''anti-Azerbaijani sentiment in Armenia''' has been mainly rooted in the unresolved territorial conflict over [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. According to a 2012 opinion poll, 63% of Armenians perceive Azerbaijan as "the biggest enemy of Armenia" while 94% of Azerbaijanis consider Armenia to be "the biggest enemy of Azerbaijan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The South Caucasus Between The EU And The Eurasian Union|url=http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/CAD-51-52.pdf|work=Caucasus Analytical Digest #51-52|publisher=Forschungsstelle Osteuropa, Bremen and Center for Security Studies, Zürich|accessdate=3 July 2013|page=21|date=17 June 2013|ISSN=1867-9323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early period ==
{{further|Armenian–Azerbaijani War}}
In the early 20th century the [[Transcaucasia]]n Armenians began to equate the Azerbaijani people with the perpetrators of anti-Armenian policies such as the [[Armenian Genocide]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="Croissant"&gt;{{cite book | last = Croissant| first = Michael| title =The Armenia-Azerbaijan Conflict: Causes and Implications| publisher = Greenwood Publishing Group| year = 1998| page = 8| isbn =0275962415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterwards a [[List of anti-Azerbaijani massacres|wave of anti-Azerbaijani massacres]] in both Azerbaijan and Armenia started in 1918 and continued until 1920. First in March 1918, a massacre of the Azerbaijanis in Baku took place. An estimated of 3,000 to 10,000 Azerbaijanis were killed by nationalist [[Dashnak]] Armenians, orchestrated by the Bolshevist [[Stepan Shahumyan]]. The massacre was later called the [[March Days]].

== During the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict ==
{{further|Nagorno-Karabakh War}}
After the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] anti-Azerbaijani sentiment grew in Armenia, leading to harassment of Azerbaijanis there.&lt;ref name="Cornell"&gt;{{cite book | last = Cornell| first =Svante| title =Azerbaijan Since Independence| publisher = M.E. Sharpe| year = 2010| page = 48| isbn =0765630036}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of 1988 the first refugee waves from Armenia reached [[Baku]]. In 1988, Azerbaijanis and [[Kurds]] (around 167,000 people) were expelled from the [[Armenian SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;Barrington, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Karabakh movement]], initial violence erupted in the form of the murder of both Armenians and Azerbaijanis and border skirmishes.&lt;ref name="Barrington"&gt;{{cite book | last = Barrington| first = Lowell| title =After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial &amp; Postcommunist States| publisher = University of Michigan Press| year = 2006| page = 231| isbn =0472068989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 1988 Azerbaijanis were evicted from the town of [[Masis, Armenia|Masis]] near the Armenian–Turkish border, and on June 20 five Azerbaijani villages were cleansed in the [[Ararat Province]].&lt;ref name="svante"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silkroadstudies.org/new/inside/publications/1999_NK_Book.pdf |title=The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict |publisher=Silkroadstudies |author=Svante E.

The year 1993 was marked by the highest wave of the [[Refugees and internally displaced persons in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani internally displaced persons]], when the Karabakh Armenian forces occupied territories beyond the [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Geukjian| first =Ohannes| title =Ethnicity, Nationalism and Conflict in the South Caucasus: Nagorno-Karabakh and the Legacy of Soviet Nationalities Policy| publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.| year = 2012| page = 199| isbn =1409436306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Karabakhi Armenians ultimately succeeded in removing Azerbaijanis from Nagorno-Karabakh.

== After Nagorno-Karabakh War ==
On January 16, 2003 Robert Kocharian said that Azerbaijanis and Armenians were "ethnically incompatible"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1065626.html Rferl.org: Nagorno-Karabakh: Timeline Of The Long Road To Peace]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was impossible for the Armenian population of Karabakh to live within an Azerbaijani state.&lt;ref name=rferl2&gt;{{cite news|title=Newsline|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1142847.html|accessdate=31 January 2013|newspaper=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]|date=February 3, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on 30 January in [[Strasbourg]], Council of Europe Secretary-General [[Walter Schwimmer]] said Kocharian's comment was tantamount to warmongering. Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe President [[Peter Schieder]] said he hopes Kocharian's remark was incorrectly translated, adding that "since its creation, the Council of Europe has never heard the phrase "ethnic incompatibility"".&lt;ref name=rferl2/&gt;

In 2010 an initiative to hold a festival of Azerbaijani films in [[Yerevan]] was blocked due to popular opposition. Similarly, in 2012 a festival of Azerbaijani short films, organized by the Armenia-based Caucasus Center for Peace-Making Initiatives and supported by the U.S. and British embassies, which was scheduled to open on April 12, was canceled in [[Gyumri]] after protesters blocked the festival venue.&lt;ref name="rferl"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.rferl.org/content/azerbaijan_armenia_film_festival_canceled_protests/24547207.html| title =Azerbaijani Film Festival Canceled In Armenia After Protests|publisher =[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]| date=April 13, 2012|accessdate = 28 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Soghoyan|first=Yeranuhi|title=Gyumri Mayor Permits Anti-Azerbaijani Film Protest; Bans Local Environmentalists|url=http://hetq.am/eng/news/12948/gyumri-mayor-permits-anti-azerbaijani-film-protest;-bans-local-environmentalists.html|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Hetq online|date=April 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the opinion of Thomas de Waal, the destruction of a mosque in Armenia was facilitated by a linguistic sleight of hand, as the name “Azeri” or “Azerbaijani” was not in common usage before the twentieth century, and these people were referred to as “Tartars”, “Turks” or simply “Muslims”. Azerbaijanis are being written out of the history of Armenia, and Armenians refer to Muslim monuments as "Persian", even though the worshippers in a mosque built in 1760 would have been Turkic-speaking Shiite subjects of Safavid dynasty, i.e. the ancestors of Azerbaijanis.&lt;ref name=dewaal&gt;{{cite book|last=de Waal|first=Thomas|title=Black garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan through peace and war|year=2003|publisher=New York University Press|page=80|quote=That the Armenians could erase an Azerbaijani mosque inside their capital city was made easier by a linguistic sleight of hand: the Azerbaijanis of Armenia can be more easily written out of history because the name “Azeri” or “Azerbaijani” was not in common usage before the twentieth century. In the premodern era these people were generally referred to as “Tartars”, “Turks” or simply “Muslims”. Yet they were neither Persians nor Turks; they were Turkic-speaking Shiite subjects of Safavid dynasty of the Iranian Empire – in other words, the ancestors of people, whom we would now call “Azerbaijanis”. So when the Armenians refer to the “Persian mosque” in Yerevan, the name obscures the fact that most of the worshippers there, when it was built in the 1760s, would have been, in effect, Azerbaijanis.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Baby Songs''' is one of the first, and longest-running, American, independent children's home video series. Since 1985, more than 4 million copies of ''Baby Songs'' have been sold.

==History==
In 1985, Amy Weintraub and Brooks McEwan founded the company Backyard Productions, now Backyard Enterprises, Inc., to release ''Baby Songs''. Inspired by the music videos on [[MTV]], Weintraub and McEwan created the first collection of music videos for babies and toddlers. 

They partnered with American [[children's music|children's musician]] [[Hap Palmer]], a recording artist since 1969, to create ''Baby Songs''. The videos often feature Palmer performing either his original songs or adaptations of folk, nursery rhymes and popular songs to live children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.happalmermusic.com/files/about.html |title=Hap Palmer website |access-date=2009-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125093816/http://happalmermusic.com/files/about.html |archive-date=2009-01-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The songs are separated by short animated video segments. Baby Songs also released videos without Palmer, often starring other singers (such as ''[[John Lithgow]]'s Kid Size Concert'').

The company has released 13 titles on VHS and DVD, and four audio compilations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.babysongs.com/about.cfm |title=Baby Songs website |access-date=2009-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509122638/http://www.babysongs.com/about.cfm |archive-date=2008-05-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The videos aired as a segment on the tv program "Lunch Box" on [[The Disney Channel]]

'''''Baci''''' ({{lang-lo|ບາສີ}}; {{lang-th|บายศรี}}, {{RTGS|''bai si''}}) and '''''su kwan''''' (Lao: {{lang|lo|ສູ່ຂວັນ}}; Thai: {{lang|th|สู่ขวัญ}}, RTGS: ''su khwan''; meaning  "calling of the soul") is an important ceremony practised in [[Culture of Laos|Lao culture]],&lt;ref name="Mansfield"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mansfield|first1=Stephen |last2=Koh|first2=Magdalene|title=Laos.

Baci is a [[Satsana Phi|''phi'' ritual]] used to celebrate important events and occasions, like births and marriages and also entering the monkhood, departing, returning, beginning a new year, and welcoming or bidding etc.&lt;ref name="Mansfield"/&gt; The ritual of the baci involves tying strings around a person’s wrist to preserve good luck, and has become a national custom.&lt;ref name=Eco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1416412/baci|title=Customs of Laos|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The observance of Baci as a spiritual ceremonial event was prevalent in Laos even before [[Buddhism]] made inroads into the country. It is also a common heritage in [[Southeast Asia]]n countries, particularly in [[Thailand]] and Laos. This practice is linked to the ancient belief that Baci is invoked religiously to synchronise the effects of 32 organs of the human body considered as ''kwan (KWA-ang)''  or  spirits or the “components of the soul.” Its observance to establish as social and family bond to maintain “balance and harmony to the individual and community, is done in its original format in Laos, as a substantiation of human existence.”&lt;ref name="Mansfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baci/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eco/&gt;

==Ceremony==
[[File:Baci ceremony2.jpg|left|thumb|Baci ceremony in [[Luang Prabang]], [[Laos]]]]
The ceremony of Baci is held on any day throughout the year as it is meant to commemorate specific events in an individual's life. It is usually held before noon. The events could be anything related to the human soul – such as a marriage, a success in any endeavour, an annual festival, birth of a child, recovery from sickness, seeking cure for any type of ill health and even to honour visitors and guests of importance.&lt;ref name="Mansfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baci/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eco/&gt;

The crux of the ceremony is to invoke the ''kwan'', which in specific terms is explained as: &lt;blockquote&gt;
An ancient belief in Laos that the human being is a union of 32 organs and that the kwan watch over and protect each one of them. It is of the utmost consequence that as many kwan as possible are kept together in the body at any one time. Since all kwan is often the attributed cause of an illness, the baci ceremony calls the kwan or souls from wherever they may be roaming, back to the body, secures them in place, and thus re-establishes equilibrium.
&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;ref name=Baci/&gt;

The ceremony is performed by a senior person of the community who has been a Buddhist monk at some stage, and special arrangements are made for the occasion. The practice involves preparing the ''pah kwan'' or the flower trays and placing at a central location for people to gather around it in reverential prayers. The ''pa kwan'' is normally prepared by the elderly ladies of the household or the community. The ''paw kwan'' is  elaborately prepared on a  silver tray on which a cone or horn made of banana leaves is placed at the centre and is decked with flowers and white cotton and silk threads tied to a bamboo stalk as flags. The decoration with flowers is of different flower types with specific connotation of ''dok huck'' (symbol of love), ''dok sampi'' (longevity), ''dok daohuang'' (cheerfulness/brilliance) and so forth.&lt;ref name="Mansfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baci/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eco/&gt;
[[File:Traditional dance during Baci ceremeony in Lao.jpg|right|thumb| Traditional dance during Baci ceremony in [[Laos]]]]
The younger generation of people assembled for the occasion first pay obeisance to the elders present in the ceremony. Thereafter, every one in the assembly touches the trays of ''pah kwan'' reverentially as a mark of respect, amidst recitation of Buddhist [[mantras]] or chants, in a mix of  [[Laotian language|Laotian]] and [[Pali language]]s by the ''mor phon'' (the person conducting the ceremony, usually a senior person who has been a Buddhist monk). Buddhist deities, animist deities and spirits are invoked amidst the chants for the return of ''kwans'' (souls) from wherever they are back to the body to ensure equilibrium. It is said to be a fusion of the traditions of [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] religious practices.&lt;ref name="Mansfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baci/&gt;&lt;ref name=Eco/&gt;

At the conclusion of the ceremony, a feast of food is offered to all guests, with bowls of rice wine. This is followed by revelry of [[Lao people|Laotian]] dance and music.&lt;ref name="Mansfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baci/&gt;

==Symbolic thread==
During the Baci ceremony, a white (symbolizes purity) thread of silk or cotton is tied on the right hand wrist of the individual who is being wished for his well being and good luck and also around the wrists of all guests who assemble to wish a person. The thread is first knotted before tying on the wrist of the person to be blessed and other guests. Before the thread is tied, the hand is held chest high as a mark of respect. The white thread is symbolic of “peace, harmony, good fortune, good health and human warmth and community.” The thread is worn by an individual normally for a minimum of three days and is untied thereafter (thread is not to be cut). Recommended practice is to allow the thread to fall off on its own.  In recent times, the thread in yellow, red and black colors are also used representing particular occasion; red symbolizing bravery, yellow representing faith and black sharing a person’s loss or grief.&lt;ref name="Mansfield"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Baci/&gt;

There is also a legend that links the cotton thread's significance to a successful and happy married life. In Laos, where a traditional way of life is of trust on beliefs and superstitions, a marriage ceremony has a special link to an ancient legend and to the thread tying ceremony of the Baci celebration. According to their legend, marriages are predetermined in heaven by what is termed as ''nene'' or "Love [[Karma]]" (destiny). In the heavenly garden, each individual has a tree with branches cuddling to the soul of his or her life partner. Eventually such pre-destined intertwined trees move to earth as human beings with their wrists tied together by a cotton thread. In the process of their coming to the earth, the cotton thread binding them is severed by “wind of scissors” and they are born on earth as separate individuals. Once born on the earth, they search for their soul mates and when they find them they marry, and by performing the Baci ceremony they are rejoined by tying the symbolic cotton thread. If the cotton thread so tied remains intact for three days then the marriage is considered fortunate and lucky for the couple.&lt;ref name=legend&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.muangla.com/en/activities/ceremonie-et-mariage/marriage-and-baci-ceremony.htm|title= Marriage and the Baci Ceremony|accessdate=2010-09-15|publisher=Muangla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bat Creek Exam 5-28-10.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The Bat Creek inscription.]]

The '''Bat Creek inscription''' (also called the '''Bat Creek stone''' or '''Bat Creek tablet''') is an inscribed stone collected as part of a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[burial mound]] excavation in [[Loudon County, Tennessee]], in 1889 by the [[Bureau of American Ethnology|Smithsonian Bureau of Ethnology]]'s Mound Survey, directed by [[entomology|entomologist]] [[Cyrus Thomas]]. The inscriptions were initially described as Cherokee, but in 2004, similarities to an inscription that was circulating in a Freemason book were discovered. Hoax expert [[Kenneth Feder]] says the peer reviewed work of Mary L. Kwas and Robert Mainfort  has "demolished" any claims of the stone's authenticity.&lt;ref name="Feder2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Feder|first=Kenneth L.|title=Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum: From Atlantis to the Walam Olum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RlRz2symkAsC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=5 March 2013|date=2010-10-11|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780313379192|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mainfort and Kwas themselves state "The Bat Creek stone is a fraud."&lt;ref name="FinalStatement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ramtops.co.uk/bat2.html|title=The Bat Creek Fraud: A Final Statement|first=Robert C. |last= Mainfort, Jr. |first2= Mary L. |last2= Kwas|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas inaccurately&lt;ref name="Feder2010"/&gt; identified the characters on the stone as "beyond question letters of the [[Cherokee syllabary|Cherokee alphabet]]," a writing system for the [[Cherokee language]] invented by [[Sequoyah]] in the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1894: 393).&lt;/ref&gt;  The stone became the subject of contention in 1970 when Semitist [[Cyrus H. Gordon]] proposed that the letters of inscription are  [[Paleo-Hebrew]] of the 1st or 2nd century AD rather than Cherokee, and therefore evidence of [[pre-Columbian transatlantic contact]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (1971, Appendix).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Gordon, five of the eight letters could be read as "for Judea."  Archaeologist Marshall McKusick countered that "Despite some difficulties, Cherokee script is a closer match to that on the tablet than the late-[[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] proposed by Gordon,"&lt;ref name="McKusick 1979: 139"&gt;McKusick (1979: 139).&lt;/ref&gt; but gave no details.

In a 1988 article in ''Tennessee Anthropologist'', economist J. Huston McCulloch compared the letters of the inscription to both Paleo-Hebrew and Cherokee and concluded that the fit as Paleo-Hebrew was substantially better than Cherokee.  He also reported a [[radiocarbon date]] on associated wood fragments consistent with Gordon's dating of the script.  In a 1991 reply, archaeologists Robert Mainfort and Mary Kwas, relying on a communication from Semitist [[Frank Moore Cross]], concluded that the inscription is not genuine paleo-Hebrew but rather a 19th-century forgery, with John W. Emmert, the Smithsonian agent who performed the excavation, the most likely responsible party.  In a 1993 article in ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'', Semitist [[P. Kyle McCarter, Jr.]] stated that although the inscription "is not an authentic paleo-Hebrew inscription," it "clearly imitates one in certain features," and does contain "an intelligible sequence of five letters -- too much for coincidence."  McCarter concluded, "It seems probable that we are dealing here not with a coincidental similarity but with a fraud."&lt;ref&gt;McCarter (1993:55).&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainfort and Kwas published a further article in ''[[American Antiquity]]'' in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Mainfort, Robert C., and Mary L. Kwas, "The Bat Creek Stone Revisited: A Fraud Exposed," ''American Antiquity'' 64 (Oct. 2004): 761-769&lt;/ref&gt; reporting their discovery of an illustration in an 1870 Masonic reference book giving an artist's impression of how the Biblical phrase "holy to Yahweh" would have appeared in Paleo-Hebrew, which bears striking similarities to the Bat Creek inscription.   The General History correctly translates the inscription "Holiness to the Lord," though "Holy to Yahweh" would be more precise. They conclude that Emmert most likely copied the inscription from the Masonic illustration, in order to please Thomas with an artifact that he would mistake for Cherokee.

==Geographic and historical context==
[[File:Bat-creek-tennessee1.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Bat Creek, now an inlet of [[Tellico Reservoir|Tellico Lake]]]]

The Little Tennessee River enters Tennessee from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the south and flows northward for just over {{convert|50|mi|km}} before emptying into the [[Tennessee River]] near [[Lenoir City, Tennessee|Lenoir City]].  The completion of [[Tellico Dam]] at the mouth of the Little Tennessee in 1979 created a reservoir that spans the lower {{convert|33|mi|km}} of the river.  Bat Creek empties into the southwest bank of the Little Tennessee {{convert|12|mi|km}} upstream from the mouth of the river.  While much of the original confluence of Bat Creek and the Little Tennessee was submerged by the lake, the mound in which the Bat Creek Stone was found was located above the reservoir's operating levels.

In the 1880s, the Smithsonian Institution team led by John W. Emmert conducted several excavations in the lower Little Tennessee valley, uncovering artifacts and burials related to the valley's 18th-century [[Overhill Cherokee]] inhabitants and prehistoric inhabitants.  The Tellico Archaeological Project, conducted by the University of Tennessee Department of Anthropology in the late 1960s and 1970s in anticipation of the reservoir's construction, investigated over two dozen sites and uncovered evidence of substantial habitation in the valley during the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] (8000–1000 BC), [[Woodland period|Woodland]] (1000 BC – 1000 AD), [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] (900-1600 AD), and [[Cherokee]] (c. 1600-1838) periods.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;  The expedition of [[Hernando de Soto]] likely visited a village on [[Bussell Island]] at the mouth of the river in 1540 and the expedition of [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] probably visited two villages further upstream (near modern [[Chilhowee Dam]]) in 1567.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson (2005: 106-107)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bat Creek site, [[Smithsonian trinomial]] designation 40LD24, is a multiphase site with evidence of occupation as early as the Archaic period.&lt;ref name="MainfortKwas"&gt;Mainfort and Kwas (1991: 3).&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Emmert, the site consisted of one large mound (Mound&amp;nbsp;1) on the east bank of the creek and two smaller mounds (Mound&amp;nbsp;2 and Mound&amp;nbsp;3) on the west bank.  Mound 1&amp;mdash;which had a diameter of {{convert|108|ft|m}} and a height of {{convert|8|ft|m}}&amp;mdash;was located on the first terrace above the river, and is thus now submerged by the reservoir.  Mound&amp;nbsp;2&amp;mdash;which had a diameter of {{convert|44|ft|m}} and height of {{convert|10|ft|m}}&amp;mdash;and Mound&amp;nbsp;3&amp;mdash;which had a diameter of {{convert|28|ft|m}} and height of {{convert|5|ft|m}}&amp;mdash;were both located higher up, on the second terrace.  According to Emmert's notes, the Bat Creek Stone was found in Mound&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;ref&gt;Except for the identification of the characters as Cherokee, Thomas (1894: 391-3) is based almost verbatim on Emmert's field report.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone consists of "ferruginous siltstone", and measures {{convert|11.4|cm|in}} long and {{convert|5.1|cm|in}} wide.&lt;ref name="MainfortKwas" /&gt;  The inscription consists of at least eight characters, seven of which are in a single row, and one located below the main inscription, when held with the straighter edge down.  A portion of a ninth letter that has broken off remains at the left edge in this orientation.  Two vertical strokes in the upper left corner in this orientation were added by an unknown party while the stone was stored in the [[National Museum of Natural History]], sometime between 1894 and 1970, and were not part of the original inscription.&lt;ref&gt;McCulloch (1988: 96). These strokes were not present in either the lithograph of Thomas (1890) or the photograph of Thomas (1894:394), but do appear in a 1970 Smithsonian photograph published by Gordon (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological excavations==

In 1881, the annual appropriation by Congress for the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[Bureau of American Ethnology|Bureau of Ethnology]]&lt;ref&gt;The name was later changed to the Bureau of American Ethnology&lt;/ref&gt; specifically designated that some of the funds be "for archaeological investigations relating to mound-builders and prehistoric mounds."&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Institution Archives (1881).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Cyrus Thomas]], an [[Entomology|entomologist]] by background, was appointed Director of the Mound Survey.  According to archaeologist [[Kenneth Feder|Kenneth L. Feder]], "With this funding, Thomas initiated the most extensive and intensive study yet conducted on the [[Mound builder (people)|Moundbuilder]] question.  The result was more than seven hundred pages submitted as an annual report of the Bureau in 1894 (Thomas 1894). ... He collected over 40,000 artifacts, which became part of the Smithsonian Institution's collection. ... Thomas's work was a watershed, both in terms of answering the specific question of who had built the mounds, and in terms of the development of American archaeology."&lt;ref&gt;Feder (1999: 144).&lt;/ref&gt;

In particular, Thomas addressed the question of whether there were pre-Columbian alphabetically inscribed tablets in the mounds, and emphatically concluded, in part on the basis of the body of evidence his study had collected, that there were not.&lt;ref&gt;Feder(1999: 145–8).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas also "carefully assessed the claim that some of the mound artifacts exhibited a sophistication in metallurgy attained only by Old World cultures.  Not relying on rumors, Thomas actually examined many of the artifacts in question.  His conclusion:  all such artifacts were made of so-called ''[[native copper]]''..."&lt;ref&gt;Feder (1999:150).&lt;/ref&gt;  Feder concludes, "With the publication of Thomas's ''Report on the Mound Explorations of the Bureau of American Ethnology'', Moundbuilder archaeology had come of age.  Its content was so detailed, its conclusions so reasonable that, though not accepted by all, the myth of a vanished race had been dealt a fatal blow."&lt;ref&gt;Feder (1999: 151).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas did not excavate the mounds himself, but delegated most of the field work to assistants, including John Emmert, who excavated all three Bat Creek mounds in 1889.  He concluded that Mound 1 was little more than a shell deposit.  Emmert recorded eight burials in Mound 2&amp;mdash;one of which included metal "buckles" and a metal button.  His excavation of Mound 3 revealed nine skeletons, seven of which were laid out in a row with their heads facing north, and two more skeletons laid out nearby, one with its head facing north and the other with its head facing south.  He reported that the Bat Creek Stone was  found under the skull of the south-facing skeleton.  Along with the stone were two bracelets identified by both Emmert and Thomas as "copper", as well as fragments of "polished wood" (possibly [[earspool]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1894: 391–3).&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1970 Smithsonian analysis found that the bracelets were in fact heavily leaded yellow [[brass]].&lt;ref&gt;McCulloch (1988: 104-7).&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1988, [[radiocarbon dating]] of the wood spools returned a date of 32–769 AD (i.e., the middle to late [[Woodland period]]).&lt;ref&gt;McCulloch (1988: 107–10), Beta Analytic-24483/ETH-3677.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] announced plans to build Tellico Dam at the mouth of the Little Tennessee River, and asked the University of Tennessee Department of Anthropology to conduct salvage excavations in the Little Tennessee Valley.  Litigation and environmental concerns stalled the dam's completion until 1979, allowing extensive excavations at multiple sites throughout the valley.  Mound 1 of the Bat Creek Site was excavated in 1975.  Investigators concluded that the mound was a "platform" mound typical of the Mississippian period.  Pre-Mississippian artifacts dating to the Archaic and Woodland periods were also found.  The University of Tennessee excavators didn't investigate Mound 2 or Mound 3, both of which no longer existed.&lt;ref&gt;Schroedl (1975: 103)&lt;/ref&gt;  Neither the University of Tennessee's excavation of the Bat Creek Site nor any other excavations in the Little Tennessee Valley uncovered any evidence that would indicate Pre-Columbian contact with Old World civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman (1985: 97–103).&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1894 final report, Thomas published a photograph of the Bat Creek stone, with the straighter edge at the top,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas(1894: 394)&lt;/ref&gt; along with Emmert's field report on the find, almost verbatim.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas(1894: 391–3)&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas himself added the opinion that the letters on it were "beyond question letters of the [[Cherokee syllabary|Cherokee alphabet]] said to have been invented by George Guess (or [[Sequoyah]]), ... about 1821."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1894:393).&lt;/ref&gt;  He in fact had published a more legible lithograph of the stone, in the same orientation, in his earlier book ''The Cherokees in Pre-Columbian Times'', in which he used it as evidence for his short-lived theory that the Cherokee had built the mounds now classified as [[Woodland Period|Middle Woodland]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas (1890: 35-7).&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of vegetation covering the mound, Thomas concluded that "the evidence seems positive that the mound was at least a hundred years old, and that it was known that it had not been disturbed in sixty years."&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;Thomas (1894: 714).&lt;/ref&gt;  This would make the mound too old to have contained a Cherokee inscription in 1889.  Thomas admitted that as Cherokee, the inscription therefore constituted "a puzzle difficult to solve."&lt;ref name="Thomas" /&gt;  He did not provide either a transliteration or a translation of the inscription as Cherokee in either work.

The Bat Creek Stone received scant attention (even in Thomas' later publications) until the 1960s when ethnologist Joseph Mahan, puzzled by Thomas' conclusion that the inscription was Cherokee, sent a photograph of the inscription to Cyrus H. Gordon&amp;mdash; a professor of Mediterranean Studies at [[Brandeis University]] and a well-known proponent of Pre-Columbian transatlantic contact theories.  Gordon published a series of articles in the early 1970s arguing that when the stone is turned so that the straighter edge is at the bottom, the letters are actually a version of [[Paleo-Hebrew]] text used in the 1st century BC through the 2nd century AD.  According to Gordon, the five letters to the left of the comma-shaped word divider read (right to left) LYHWD, which he interpreted as "for Judea," or, including the broken letter at the far left, LYHWD[M], "for the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Gordon (1971: 175–87).  Chicago lawyer and author [[Henriette Mertz]] (1964) had already suggested the stone as it appeared in Thomas' report was upside down and that the inscription was Semitic, but believed it to be [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Gordon provided only tentative Paleo-Hebrew readings of the other three letters.&lt;ref&gt;See discussion of these letters in McCulloch (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  His findings were published in ''Newsweek'' and in newspapers across the nation, sparking a renewed interest in the inscription.&lt;ref&gt;"A Canaanite Columbus?" ''Newsweek'' '''76''' (17):65, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1979, University of Iowa archaeologist Marshall McKusick argued that "Despite some difficulties, Cherokee script is a closer match to that on the tablet than the late-[[Canaanite languages|Canaanite]] proposed by Gordon."&lt;ref name="McKusick 1979: 139"/&gt;  According to McKusick, the inscription actually bore the closest similarities to an early version of Sequoyah's alphabet that was occasionally used before the standard, printed version of the script was developed by [[Samuel Worcester]] in 1827.&lt;ref&gt;McKusick (1994).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, McKusick gave no details and made no attempt to interpret the inscription as Cherokee.

The debate was revived in 1988 by J. Huston McCulloch, an economics professor at Ohio State University.  In an article in the ''Tennessee Anthropologist'', he compared the letters in the inscription to both Paleo-Hebrew and Cherokee, including the pre-Worcester version favored by McKusick, and concluded that despite admitted difficulties, the fit as Paleo-Hebrew in Gordon's orientation is substantially better than as Cherokee, in either orientation.  In this article, McCulloch, also asserts that the "comma" found in the bat creek inscription is a Paleo-Hebrew symbol for word division not known until the discovery of Qumran Leviticus fragments found after World War II.  He further reported the radiocarbon date of 32 AD – 769 AD on the wooden earspool fragments, and also that although brass similar to that of the bracelets is a common modern alloy, it also was found in the Roman empire, in particular during the period 45 BC – 200 AD.&lt;ref&gt;McCulloch (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, author [[Jason Colavito]] suggested that the mark described as a comma was unnecessary as a word divider as a space between the words already existed. If in fact it was a word divider, Colavito states that the illustration of the [[Mesha Stele]] (then known as the "Moabite Stone" in the 1870 Masonic book "demonstrates that the style and shape of the letters, along with word divider marks, were well-known in the 1870s and 1880s and was thus not a twentieth-century discovery." He points out that the "divider on the Bat Creek inscription is correctly placed in the bottom right corner of the word, as it is on the Moabite Stone" and that although the dividers on the actual stone are small circles, the drawing in the book makes some of them appear more like the comma on the Bat Creek stone. He concludes that this does not prove the stone is a hoax, but that there was in fact a source for the word divider early enough to have been used by a hoaxer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Colavito |first1=Jason |title=The Mesha Stele: A Source for the Bat Creek Stone's "Word Divider"? |url=http://www.jasoncolavito.com/blog/the-mesha-stele-a-source-for-the-bat-creek-stones-word-divider |website=Jason Colavito |accessdate=14 August 2018 |language=en |date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists Robert Mainfort and Mary Kwas (1991) replied to McCulloch's article with a number of objections:   
Relying on an unpublished assessment by Hebrew paleography expert [[Frank Moore Cross]] of Harvard University, they concluded the inscription is not legitimate Paleo-Hebrew.  Although they conceded that the composition of the brass bracelets is "equivocal with respect to age," they argued that the bracelets are in all likelihood relatively modern European trade items. They interpreted an 1898 statement by Thomas, that "one of the best recent works on ancient America is flawed to some extent" by the depiction of mounds and ancient works "which do not and never did exist" and by the representation of articles which are "modern productions," to be a veiled repudiation by Thomas of his own 1894 ''Mound Explorations'' report, and in particular of its Bat Creek inscription.
Mainfort and Kwas concluded that the inscription is a forgery, for which Emmert was responsible.  They proposed that "Emmert's motive for producing (or causing to have made) the Bat Creek inscription was that he felt the best way to insure permanent employment with the Mound Survey was to find an outstanding artifact, and how better to impress Cyrus Thomas than to 'find' an object that would prove Thomas' hypothesis that the Cherokee built most of the mounds in eastern Tennessee?"&lt;ref&gt;Mainfort and Kwas (1991: 12).&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Tennessee Anthropologist'' discussion continued with McCulloch (1993a) and Mainfort and Kwas (1993).

In an invited article in ''Biblical Archaeological Review'', McCulloch (1993b) reviewed and extended the argument for Paleo-Hebrew.  In a reply in the same issue, P. Kyle McCarter, Jr., a professor of Near Eastern Studies at Johns Hopkins University and an expert on the [[Qumran]] [[Copper Scroll]], stated that although the inscription "is not an authentic paleo-Hebrew inscription," it "clearly imitates one in certain features," and does contain "an intelligible sequence of five letters – too much for coincidence.  It seems probable that we are dealing here not with a coincidental similarity but with a fraud."  McCarter remarked that if Emmert forged the inscription in an attempt to ingratiate himself with Thomas by presenting him with a Cherokee inscription, his choice of a paleo-Hebrew model "was ironically inept." &lt;ref&gt;McCarter (1993: 55).  See also several letters to the editor by Robert Stieglitz, McCarter, Mainfort and Kwas, McKusick, McCulloch and others in the Nov./Dec. 1993 and Jan./Feb. 1994 issues of ''Biblical Archaeology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Mainfort and Kwas published a further article in ''American Antiquity'', reporting their discovery of an illustration in an 1870 Masonic reference book that bears striking similarities to the Bat Creek inscription.&lt;ref&gt;Mainfort and Kwas (2004), Macoy (1868: 134).  The same illustration appears on p. 169 of the 1870 edition cited by Mainfort and Kwas, as well as the 1989 reprint edition, but not in the 1867 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Masonic illustration was an artist's impression of how the Biblical phrase "Holy to Yahweh" (qdš.lyhwh) would have appeared in Paleo-Hebrew.  Mainfort and Kwas conclude, "There can be little doubt that this was the source of the inscription and that the inscription was copied, albeit not particularly well, by the individual who forged the Bat Creek stone."&lt;ref&gt;Mainfort and Kwas (2004: 765).&lt;/ref&gt;  They repeat their 1991 contention that Emmert produced it in order to please Thomas with a Cherokee-like artifact, but add that since it is unlikely that Emmert could write Cherokee, he must have copied this Masonic illustration instead, and that the accidental resemblances to Cherokee "were enough to fool Thomas."&lt;ref&gt;Mainfort and Kwas (2004: 766).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the Smithsonian Department of Anthropology issued the following statement concerning the stone: 
:While recognizing that a diversity of opinion continues to circulate around the authenticity of the Bat Creek Stone, the curators in the Department of Anthropology at the National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, believe that the inscriptions on the artifact are forgeries and that the artifact is a fake.  This opinion is widely shared by other professional archaeologists as represented in the article by Robert Mainfort and Mary Kwas ‘The Bat Creek Stone Revisited: A Fraud Exposed’, ''American Antiquity'' 2004. Along with other known fraudulent artifacts, we retain it in our collections as part of the cultural history of archaeological frauds, which were known to be quite popular in the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;E-mail dated Feb. 7, 2014 from Jake Homiak, Director, Anthropology Collections &amp; Archives Program, Smithsonian Museum Support Center, Suitland MD, to Barbara Duncan, Education Director, Museum of the Cherokee Indian, Cherokee NC.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Berlin''''' is a musical written by [[Erik Orton]] while he was a student at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) and debuted at the [[Franklin S. Harris Fine Arts Center]] in 1999.  Orton also composed the music for ''Berlin''.

It later played at Theatre 315 in [[New York City]].  In that production the lead female role was played by [[Nicole Riding]].

In 2008 BYU made Berlin into a movie and showed in on [[BYU-TV]].  In 2009 it was shown at the [[LDS Film Festival]] in [[Orem, Utah]].

[[Image:Bayon Angkor Relief1.jpg|Stone bas-relief at [[Bayon]] temple depicting the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] army at war with the [[Cham (Asia)|Cham]], carved c. 1200 CE|thumb]]
The history of '''Cambodian art''' stretches back centuries to ancient times, but the most famous period is undoubtedly the '''Khmer art''' of the [[Khmer Empire]] (802–1431), especially in the area around [[Angkor]] and the mainly 12th-century temple-complex of [[Angkor Wat]], initially [[Hindu]] and subsequently [[Buddhist]]. After the collapse of the empire these and other sites were abandoned and overgrown, allowing much of the era's stone carving and architecture to survive to the present day.  Traditional Cambodian arts and crafts include [[textiles]], non-textile [[weaving]], [[silversmithing]], [[stone carving]], [[lacquerware]], [[Ceramic art|ceramics]], [[wat]] [[murals]], and [[kite]]-making.  

Beginning in the mid-20th century, a tradition of modern art began in Cambodia, though in the later 20th century both traditional and modern arts declined for several reasons, including the killing of artists by the [[Khmer Rouge]].  The country has experienced a recent artistic revival due to increased support from governments, NGOs, and foreign tourists.

In pre-colonial Cambodia, art and crafts were generally produced either by rural non-specialists for practical use or by skilled artists producing works for the Royal Palace.  In modern Cambodia, many artistic traditions entered a period of decline or even ceased to be practiced, but the country has experienced a recent artistic revival as the tourist market has increased and governments and NGOs have contributed to the preservation of Cambodian culture.

==Stone carving==
{{Main|Khmer sculpture}}
[[Image:Fronton Cambodge Musée Guimet 9972.jpg|Stone carving at [[Banteay Srei]], an [[Angkor]]ian temple consecrated in 967 CE.|thumb]]
Cambodia's best-known stone carving adorns the temples of [[Angkor]], which are "renowned for the scale, richness and detail of their sculpture". In modern times, however, the art of stone carving became rare, largely because older sculptures survived undamaged for centuries (eliminating the need for replacements) and because of the use of cement molds for modern temple architecture.  By the 1970s and 1980s, the craft of stone carving was nearly lost.&lt;ref name=carving&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1828.html "Stone carving"].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 20th century, however, efforts to restore Angkor resulted in a new demand for skilled stone carvers to replace missing or damaged pieces, and a new tradition of stone carving is arising to meet this need. Most modern carving is traditional-style, but some carvers are experimenting with contemporary designs.  Interest is also renewing for using stone carving in modern wats.  Modern carvings are typically made from [[Banteay Meanchey]] [[sandstone]], though stone from [[Pursat]] and [[Kampong Thom City|Kompong Thom]] is also used.&lt;ref name=carving/&gt;

In the 1960s, art historians Guy and Jacqueline Nafilyan photographed 19th-century murals, providing a record of this lost cultural heritage. The best known surviving murals are at the [[Silver Pagoda]] in [[Phnom Penh]], [[Wat Rajabo]] in [[Siem Reap province]], and [[Wat Kompong Tralach Leu]] in [[Kompong Chhnang Province]]. In the last decade, wat murals have seen a resurgence, but Cambodia's surviving older murals are generally more refined and detailed.

==Textiles==

[[Image:Cambodia weaving.jpg|Cambodian woman weaving silk near [[Siem Reap]], 2007|thumb]]
[[Silk]] [[weaving]] in Cambodia has a long history. The practice dates to as early as the 1st century, and textiles were used in trade during [[Angkor]]ian times. Even modern textile production evidences these historic antecedents: motifs found on silk today often echo clothing details on ancient stone sculptures.&lt;ref name=silk&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1821.html "Silk weaving"].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main types of Cambodian weaving.  The [[ikat]] technique (Khmer: ''chong kiet''), which produces patterned fabric, is quite complex.  To create patterns, weavers tie-dye portions of [[weft]] yarn before weaving begins.  Patterns are diverse and vary by region; common motifs include lattice, stars, and spots.  The second weaving technique, unique to Cambodia, is called "uneven [[twill]]". It yields single or two-color fabrics, which are produced by weaving three threads so that the "color of one thread dominates on one side of the fabric, while the two others determine the colour on the reverse side."&lt;ref name=silk/&gt; Traditionally, Cambodian textiles have employed natural dyes.  Red dye comes from [[lac]] insect nests, blue dye from [[indigo]], yellow and green dye from [[prohut]] bark, and black dye from [[ebony]] bark.&lt;ref name=silk/&gt;

Cambodia's modern silk-weaving centers are [[Takeo]], [[Battambang]], [[Beanteay Meanchey]], [[Siem Reap]] and [[Kampot Province|Kampot]] provinces.    Silk-weaving has seen a major revival recently, with production doubling over the past ten years. This has provided employment for many rural women. Cambodian silk is generally sold domestically, where it is used in ''[[sampot]]'' (wrap skirts), furnishings, and ''[[pidan (textile)|pidan]]'' (pictoral tapestries), but interest in international trade is increasing.&lt;ref name=silk/&gt;

[[Cotton]] textiles have also played a significant role in Cambodian culture. Though today Cambodia imports most of its cotton, traditionally woven cotton remains popular. Rural women often weave homemade cotton fabric, which is used in garments and for household purposes. [[Krama]], the traditional check scarves worn almost universally by Cambodians, are made of cotton.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1827.html "Cotton weaving (tbanh ambas)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-textile weaving==
Many Cambodian farmers [[basket weaving|weave baskets]] (Khmer: tbanh kantrak) for household use or as a supplemental source of income.  Most baskets are made of thinly cut bamboo.  Regions known for basketry include [[Siem Reap]] and [[Kampong Cham Province|Kampong Cham]].&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1824.html "Basket weaving (tbanh kantrak)"].&lt;/ref&gt; Mat weaving (tbanh kantuel) is a common seasonal occupation. They are most commonly made from reeds, either left a natural tan color or dyed in deep jewel tones. The region of Cambodia best known for mat weaving is the Mekong floodplain, especially around [[Lvea Em]] district. Mats are commonly laid out for guests and are important building materials for homes.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1825.html "Mat weaving (tbanh kantuel)"].&lt;/ref&gt; Wicker and rattan crafts (tbanh kanchoeu) made from [[dryandra]] trees are also significant.  Common wicker and rattan products include walls, mats, furniture, and other household items.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1826.html "Wicker and rattan (tbanh kanchoeu)"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lacquerware==
[[Image:Cambodia lacquerware.jpg|A Cambodian woman works on a lacquered vase|thumb]]
The height of Cambodian traditional [[lacquerware]] was between the 12th and 16th centuries; some examples of work from this era, including gilded Buddha images and [[betel]] boxes, have survived to the present day.  Lacquerware was traditionally colored black using burnt wood, representing the underworld; red using mercury, representing the earth; and yellow using arsenic, representing the heavens.  Lacquer on Angkorian stone dates to the 15th or 16th century.&lt;ref name=lacquer&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1829.html "Lacquerware"].&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern Cambodia, the art of lacquerwork nearly faded into oblivion: few lacquer trees survived, and lacquer was unavailable in local markets.  Today's revival is still in its infancy, but 100 lacquer artists have been trained by a French expert under the guidance of Artisans d'Angkor, a company that produces traditional crafts in village workshops.  Some artists are "beginning to experiment with different techniques and styles...to produce modern and striking effects."&lt;ref name=lacquer/&gt;

==Silversmithing==
[[Image:Bowl cambodia.jpg|Lotus-shaped Cambodian bowl (gold and silver alloy), made c. 1222 CE|thumb]]
Silversmithing in Cambodia dates back centuries.  The Royal Palace traditionally patronized silversmiths' workshops, and silversmiths remain concentrated at [[Kompong Luong]], near the former royal capital [[Oudong]].  Silver was made into a variety of items, including weaponry, coins, ceremonial objects used in funerary and religious rituals, and betel boxes.  During Cambodia's colonial period, artisans at the School of Fine Art produced celebrated silverwork, and by the late 1930s there were more than 600 silversmiths. Today, silverwork is popular for boxes, jewellery, and souvenir items; these are often adorned with fruit, fire, and Angkor-inspired motifs.  Men produce most of the forms for such work, but women often complete the intricate filigree.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1822.html "Silversmithing"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ceramics==
Cambodian pottery traditions date to 5000 BCE.  Ceramics were mostly used for domestic purposes such as holding food and water. There is no evidence that Khmer ceramics were ever exported, though ceramics were imported from elsewhere in Asia beginning in the 10th century. Ceramics in the shape of birds, elephants, rabbits, and other animals were popular between the 11th and 13th centuries.&lt;ref name=ceramics&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1823.html "Ceramics"].&lt;/ref&gt;

Potting traditionally was done either on a [[pottery wheel]] or using shaping tools such as paddles and anvils. Firing was done in clay kilns, which could reach temperatures of 1,000–1,200 °C, or in the open air, at temperatures of around 700 °C. Primarily green and brown glazes were used.  In rural Cambodia, traditional pottery methods remained.  Many pieces are hand-turned and fired on an open fire without glaze.  The country's major center for pottery is [[Kompong Chhnang Province]].&lt;ref name=ceramics/&gt;

In modern Cambodia, the art of glazed ceramics faded into oblivion: the technique of stoneware stop to be used around 14th century, at the end of Angkor era. Today this technique begin a slow revival through a Belgian ceramist who founded the [[Khmer Ceramics &amp; Fine Arts Centre|Khmer Ceramics &amp; Fine Arts Center]], in Siem Reap, the organization lead vocational training and researches about this lost skill.

==Kites==
Cambodia's kite-making and kite-flying tradition, which dates back many centuries, was revived in the early 1990s and is now extremely popular throughout the country. Kites (Khmer: khleng ek) are generally flown at night during the northeast monsoon season. A bow attached to the kites resonates in the wind, producing a musical sound.&lt;ref&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1866.html "Kite Making"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern and contemporary visual arts==

Cambodia's tradition of modern (representational) drawing, painting, and sculpture was established in the late 1940s at the School of Cambodian Arts (later called the University of Fine Arts), where it occupied much of the school's curriculum a decade later.  These developments were supported by the government, which encouraged new areas of specialization (e.g. design and modern painting) at the school and purchased modern art for the Prime Minister's residences and for government buildings.  Galleries opened in Phnom Penh during the 1960s, and cultural centers hosted exhibitions of modern paintings and provided art libraries.  One important painter of the 1960s was [[Nhek Dim]]; he has become the painter of reference for modern painters.&lt;ref&gt;Vachon, Michelle. "Painting by famed Nhek Dim returns home", ''The Cambodia Daily'', Phnom Penh, 20 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the subsequent Khmer Rouge era, many artists were killed and art production nearly ceased.&lt;ref name=modern&gt;Visiting Arts (2005), [http://www.culturalprofiles.net/cambodia/Directories/Cambodia_Cultural_Profile/-1792.html "Modern and contemporary visual arts"].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Khmer Rouge, artists and professors returned the University of Fine Arts to rebuild arts training.  Socialist Bloc governments sponsored the education of young art students in Poland, Bulgaria, the former Soviet Union, and Hungary during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Other local efforts aimed to re-establish workshops, collect documents, and preserve traditional knowledge.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

Though several galleries present changing exhibitions in Phnom Penh, the vast majority of artists cannot support themselves through exhibitions and sales of modern work.  Artists generally earn income from Angkor-inspired art for tourists or from painting commercial signs and large reproductions that in the West would be mechanically produced.&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

Several broad schools of art exist among modern Cambodian artists.  Some artists, including [[Som Samai]] (a silversmith), [[An Sok]] (a mask-maker), and [[Chet Chan]] (a painter) follow colonial traditions to produce traditional Khmer art.  [[Chhim Sothy]]'s work is also derived from these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fine Art|first=Angkor|title=Chhim Sothy - Artist|url=http://www.angkorfineart.com/2012/03/09/58/}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many young artists who studied abroad in the 1980s, including [[Phy Chan Than]], [[Soeung Vannara]], [[Long Sophea]], and [[Prom Sam An]], have presented a modern Khmer art forms combining subjects from Khmer art with Western modernism. Other notable Cambodian artists include Leang Seckon, Pich Sopheap, Svay Ken, Asasax, [http://www.artistdina.com Chhan Dina], Patrick Samnang Mey, Lam Soeung, and Chhorn Bun Son. During the 1990s, Cambodia saw the return of many members of the Khmer diaspora, including several internationally recognized artists.  Among these are [[Marine Ky]] and [[Chath Piersath]].&lt;ref name=modern/&gt;

'''Devil's Night''' is a name associated with October 30, the night before [[Halloween]]. It is related to the "[[Mischief Night|Mischief Night]]" practiced in parts of the [[United States]] such as [[Philadelphia]], but is chiefly associated with the serious [[Defacement (vandalism)|vandalism]] and [[arson]] seen in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], from the 1970s to the 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Jack Santino, ''The Hallowed Eve'', University Press of Kentucky (1998), Pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; finally prompting the "[[#Angels' Night|Angels' Night]]" community response.

==Description==
Devil's Night dates from as early as the 1940s. Traditionally, city youths engaged in a night of mischievous or petty criminal behavior, usually consisting of minor pranks or acts of mild [[vandalism]] (such as [[egging]], soaping or waxing windows and doors, leaving rotten vegetables or flaming bags of canine feces on front porch stoops, or [[toilet papering]] trees and shrubs) which caused little or no property damage.

However, in the early 1970s, the vandalism escalated to more destructive acts such as [[arson]]. This primarily took place in the [[inner city]], but surrounding suburbs were often affected as well.

The crimes became more destructive in Detroit's inner-city neighborhoods, and included hundreds of acts of arson and vandalism every year. The destruction reached a peak in the mid- to late-1980s, with more than 800 fires set in 1984, and 500 to 800 fires in the three days and nights before Halloween in a typical year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/offbeat/2007/10/the_mischievous_history_of_dev_2.html |title=The Mischievous History of Devil's Night |last= Roig-Franzia |first= Manuel |page= 3 |date=2007-10-30 |publisher=The Washington Post }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of Devil's Night arson==
By the early 1990s, Detroit saw little decline in Devil's Night arson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published: November 03, 1991 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DC173DF930A35752C1A967958260 |title=Devil's Night Fires Decline By More Than Half in Detroit, The New York Times, November 3, 1991 |publisher=New York Times |date=1991-11-03 |accessdate=2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a brutal Devil's Night in 1994, then-mayor [[Dennis Archer]] promised city residents arson would not be tolerated.  In 1995, Detroit city officials organized and created [[#Angels' Night|Angels' Night]] on and around October 29–31.  Each year as many as 50,000 volunteers gather to patrol neighborhoods in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.detroit.mi.us/angelsnight/default.htm |title=City of Detroit Angel's Night Homepage, Accessed July 4, 2007 |publisher=Ci.detroit.mi.us |date= |accessdate=2013-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191414/http://www.ci.detroit.mi.us/angelsnight/default.htm |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://dailytribune.com/articles/2009/11/03/news/doc4aef43ca44335834433376.txt |title=Detroit fires drop over 3-day Halloween period |work=Daily Tribune |date=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306075036/http://dailytribune.com/articles/2009/11/03/news/doc4aef43ca44335834433376.txt |archivedate=March 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the efforts, fires plunged to near-ordinary levels in the first decade of the 21st century. In 2010, the number of reported fires climbed to 169, a 42 percent increase compared to the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/299676|title=Significant rise in Detroit fires over Halloween weekend 2010|publisher=Digital Journal|date=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent years saw the totals again decline to the low 90s for the three-day period.

In the 2010s, the decline of Devil's Night fires has coincided with a rise in similar arson on the nights surrounding the July 4 [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motorcitymuckraker.com/2016/07/05/devil-returns-detroit-fourth-july-weekends-140-fires/|title=Devil returns on Fourth of July weekend: 140 fires break out in Detroit|last=Neavling|first=Steve|publisher=Motor City Muckraker|date=2016-07-05|accessdate=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angels' Night==
'''Angels' Night''' is an event that is designed to mitigate criminal acts associated with Devil's Night in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].
After a brutal Devil's Night in 1994, then-new mayor [[Dennis Archer]] promised city residents arson would not be tolerated.  In 1995, Detroit city officials organized and created Angels' Night on and around October 29–31.

Currently as many as 40,000 Detroiters volunteer to keep the city safe on these nights.  Many volunteers keep a high profile patrolling neighborhoods with magnetic-mount flashing [[amber]] beacons, on their personal vehicles, along with communicating with command centers via [[Citizens band radio|CB radio]]s or by [[mobile phone|cellular phone]]s to report any suspicious activity. In recent years, [[arson]] and other crimes have fallen, a success largely attributed to the Angels' Night volunteers. The drop in reported fires for the year 2008 has been credited to the Angels' Night program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelsnight.org/|title=Angels Night Information - Volunteer - How Do I  - City of Detroit MI|work=angelsnight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, 35,000 signed up to volunteer in the city, according to Daniel Cherrin, spokesperson for Detroit Mayor Ken Cockrel, Jr. [https://www.cbsnews.com/news/devils-night-fires-doused-in-detroit/][https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/111835]

==In popular culture==
* In 1989, ska band The Mighty Mighty Bosstones released their album “Devil’s Night Out”.
* In 1993, underground Detroit rapper [[Esham]] released his song "Devil's Night", about arson and mayhem in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hellterskkkelter-mw0000042860|title=Hellterskkkelter|work=AllMusic}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Devil's Night is an integral part of the 1994 film ''[[The Crow (1994 film)|The Crow]]''. At a meeting of criminal underworld figures, the main villain Top Dollar ([[Michael Wincott]]) is portrayed as having started the first fires himself, which were later emulated by others. 
* Detroit hip-hop group [[D12]]'s 2001 debut album is titled ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'' which also features a song with the same title.

'''Ethel Stefana Drower''' {{nee}} Stevens (1 December 1879 – 27 January 1972) was a [[British people|British]] [[cultural anthropologist]] who studied the [[Middle East]] and its cultures.  She was considered the primary specialist on the [[Mandaeism|Mandaeans]], and the chief collector of Mandaean manuscripts.

She was a daughter of a clergyman. In 1906 she was working for [[Curtis Brown (literary agents)|Curtis Brown]], a London literary agency when she signed [[Arthur Ransome]] to write ''[[Bohemia in London]]''.

In 1911, she married Edwin Drower and after his knighthood became '''Lady Drower'''. As '''E. S. Stevens''', she wrote a series of romantic novels for [[Mills and Boon]] and other publishers. In 1921, she accompanied her husband to Iraq where Sir Edwin Drower was adviser to the Justice Minister from 1921 to 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society: 34-35 Royal Central Asian Society, Central Asian Society, London - 1947 "Both as Miss ES Stevens and since her marriage in 1910 to Sir Edwin Drower, KBE, from 1922 to 1946, the Adviser to the Ministry of Justice in 'Iraq, Lady Drower has written a number of books, some on travel, some novels, and especially  .."&lt;/ref&gt;
Her works include ''The Canonical Prayerbook of the Mandaeans'' (a translation of the [[Qolusta]]); ''The Secret Adam'' (Mandaeans); and ''The Peacock Angel'' (about the [[Yezidi]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University n35  University of London. School of Oriental and African Studies - 1972 "Already under her maiden name of Ethel Stefana Stevens, Lady Drower had been fired by the romance of the Orient; between 1909 and 1927 she published 13 novels, and she was the author of two delectable books of travel."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early Netherlandish painting''' is the work of artists, sometimes known as the '''Flemish Primitives''', active in the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Burgundian]] and [[Habsburg Netherlands]] during the 15th- and 16th-century [[Northern Renaissance]], especially in the flourishing cities of [[Bruges]], [[Ghent]], [[Mechelen]], [[Louvain, Belgium|Louvain]], [[Tournai]] and [[Brussels]], all in present-day [[Belgium]]. The period begins approximately with [[Robert Campin]] and [[Jan van Eyck]] in the 1420s and lasts at least until the death of [[Gerard David]] in 1523,&lt;ref name = "Spronk7"&gt;Spronk (1996), 7&lt;/ref&gt; although many scholars extend it to the start of the [[Dutch Revolt]] in 1566 or 1568 ([[Max J. Friedländer]]'s acclaimed surveys run through [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]). Early Netherlandish painting coincides with the Early and [[High Renaissance|High]] [[Italian Renaissance]] but the early period (until about 1500) is seen as an independent artistic evolution, separate from the [[Renaissance humanism]] that characterised developments in Italy, although beginning in the 1490s as increasing numbers of Netherlandish and other Northern painters traveled to Italy, [[Renaissance]] ideals and painting styles were incorporated into Netherlandish and other Northern painting. As a result, Early Netherlandish painters are often categorised as belonging to both the [[Northern Renaissance]] and the Late or [[International Gothic]].

The major Netherlandish painters include Campin, van Eyck, [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Dieric Bouts]], [[Petrus Christus]], [[Hans Memling]], [[Hugo van der Goes]] and [[Hieronymus Bosch]]. These artists made significant advances in natural representation and [[illusionism (art)|illusionism]], and their work typically features complex [[iconography]].  Their subjects are usually religious scenes or small portraits, with narrative painting or mythological subjects being relatively rare. Landscape is often richly described but relegated as a background detail before the early 16th century. The painted works are generally oil on panel, either as single works or more complex portable or fixed altarpieces in the form of [[diptych]]s, [[triptych]]s or [[polyptych]]s. The period is also noted for its sculpture, [[tapestry|tapestries]], [[illuminated manuscripts]], [[stained glass]] and carved [[retable]]s.

The first generations of artists were active during the height of Burgundian influence in Europe, when the [[Low Countries]] became the political and economic centre of Northern Europe, noted for its crafts and luxury goods. Assisted by the workshop system, panels and a variety of crafts were sold to foreign princes or merchants through private engagement or market stalls. A majority of the works were destroyed during waves of [[iconoclasm]] in the 16th and 17th centuries; today only a few thousand examples survive. Early northern art in general was not well regarded from the early 17th to the mid-19th century, and the painters and their works were not well documented until the mid-19th century. Art historians spent almost another century determining attributions, studying iconography, and establishing bare outlines of even the major artists' lives. Attribution of some of the most significant works is still debated.

Scholarship of Early Netherlandish painting was one of the main activities of 19th- and 20th-century art history, and a major focus of two of the most important art historians of the 20th century: [[Max J. Friedländer]] (''From Van Eyck to Breugel'' and ''[[Early Netherlandish Painting (Friedländer)|Early Netherlandish Painting]]'') and [[Erwin Panofsky]] (''[[Early Netherlandish Painting (Panofsky)|Early Netherlandish Painting]]'').

==Terminology and scope==
The term "Early Netherlandish art" applies broadly to painters active during the 15th and 16th centuries&lt;ref name = "Spronk7"/&gt; in the northern European areas controlled by the [[Burgundian Netherlands|Dukes of Burgundy]] and later the [[Seventeen Provinces|Habsburg dynasty]]. These artists became an early driving force behind the Northern Renaissance and the move away from the Gothic style. In this political and art-historical context, the north follows the Burgundian lands which straddled areas that encompass parts of modern France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name ="Pächt30"&gt;Pächt (1999), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lamgods open.jpg|thumb|left|460px|The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', completed in 1432 by Jan van Eyck. This polyptych and the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] are generally seen as the first major works of the Early Netherlandish period.]]

The Netherlandish artists have been known by a variety of terms. "Late Gothic" is an early designation which emphasises continuity with the [[medieval art|art of the Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="janson"&gt;Janson, H.W. (2006), 493–501&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the artists were variously referred to in English as the "[[Ghent-Bruges school]]" or the "Old Netherlandish school". "Flemish Primitives" is a traditional art-historical term borrowed from the French ''primitifs flamands''&lt;ref name="C7"/&gt; that became popular after the [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|famous exhibition in Bruges in 1902]]&lt;ref&gt;Deam (1998), 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Flemish and Netherlandish art were only distinguished from each other from the early 17th century. See Spronk (1997), 7}} and remains in use today, especially in Dutch and German.&lt;ref name="janson" /&gt; In this context, "primitive" does not refer to a perceived lack of sophistication, but rather identifies the artists as originators of a new tradition in painting. [[Erwin Panofsky]] preferred the term ''[[ars nova]]'' ("new art"), which linked the movement with innovative composers of music such as [[Guillaume Dufay]] and [[Gilles Binchois]], who were favoured by the Burgundian court over artists attached to the lavish French court.&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1969), 165&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Burgundian dukes]] established centres of power in the Netherlands, they brought with them a more cosmopolitan outlook.&lt;ref name ="Pächt11"/&gt; According to [[Otto Pächt]] a simultaneous shift in art began sometime between 1406 and 1420 when a "revolution took place in painting"; a "new beauty" in art emerged, one that depicted the visible rather than the metaphysical world.&lt;ref name ="Pächt12"&gt;Pächt (1999), 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century the Early Netherlandish artists were classified by nationality, with [[Jan van Eyck]] identified as German and van der Weyden (born Roger de la Pasture) as French.&lt;ref name="Deam"&gt;Deam (1998), 15&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars were at times preoccupied as to whether the school's genesis was in France or Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 271&lt;/ref&gt; These arguments and distinctions dissipated after World War I, and following the leads of [[Max Jakob Friedländer|Friedländer]], Panofsky, and Pächt, English-language scholars now almost universally describe the period as "Early Netherlandish painting", although many art historians view the Flemish term as more correct.&lt;ref name="Deam" /&gt;

In the 14th century, as [[Gothic art]] gave way to the [[International Gothic]] era, a number of schools developed in northern Europe. Early Netherlandish art originated in French courtly art, and is especially tied to the tradition and conventions of [[illuminated manuscript]]s. Modern art historians see the era as beginning with 14th-century manuscript illuminators. They were followed by panel painters such as [[Melchior Broederlam]] and [[Robert Campin]], the latter generally considered the first Early Netherlandish master, under whom van der Weyden served his apprenticeship.&lt;ref name ="Pächt11"&gt;Pächt (1999), 11&lt;/ref&gt; Illumination reached a peak in the region in the decades after 1400, mainly due to the patronage of Burgundian and [[House of Valois-Anjou]] dukes such as [[Philip the Bold]], [[Louis I, Duke of Anjou|Louis I of Anjou]] and [[Jean, Duke of Berry]]. This patronage continued in the low countries with the Burgundian dukes, [[Philip the Good]] and his son [[Charles the Bold]].&lt;ref&gt;Kren (2010), 11–12&lt;/ref&gt; The demand for illuminated manuscripts declined towards the end of the century, perhaps because of the costly production process in comparison to panel painting. Yet illumination remained popular at the luxury end of the market, and [[old master print|prints]], both [[engraving]]s and [[woodcut]]s, found a new mass market, especially those by artists such as [[Martin Schongauer]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]].&lt;ref name="n3"&gt;Nash (2008), 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|480px|[[Hieronymus Bosch]], ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1490–1510. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid. Art historians are divided as to whether the central panel was intended as a moral warning or as a panorama of paradise lost]]
Following van Eyck's innovations, the first generation of Netherlandish painters emphasised light and shadow, elements usually absent from 14th-century illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name ="Pächt12ff"&gt;Pächt (1999), 12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Biblical scenes were depicted with more naturalism, which made their content more accessible to viewers, while individual portraits became more evocative and alive.&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 19"&gt;Chapuis (1998), 19&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johan Huizinga]] said that art of the era was meant to be fully integrated with daily routine, to "fill with beauty" the devotional life in a world closely tied to the liturgy and sacraments.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga (2009 ed.), 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; After about 1500 a number of factors turned against the pervasive Northern style, not least the rise of Italian art, whose commercial appeal began to rival Netherlandish art by 1510, and overtook it some ten years later. Two events symbolically and historically reflect this shift: the transporting of a marble ''[[Madonna of Bruges|Madonna and Child]]'' by [[Michelangelo]] to Bruges in 1506,&lt;ref name="n3" /&gt; and the arrival of [[Raphael]]'s [[Raphael Cartoons|tapestry cartoons]] to Brussels in 1517, which were widely seen while in the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 321&lt;/ref&gt; Although the influence of Italian art was soon widespread across the north, it in turn had drawn on the 15th-century northern painters, with Michelangelo's ''Madonna'' based on a type developed by [[Hans Memling]].&lt;ref name="n3" /&gt;

Netherlandish painting ends in the narrowest sense with the death of [[Gerard David]] in 1523. A number of mid- and late-16th-century artists maintained many of the conventions, and they are frequently but not always associated with the school. The style of these painters is often dramatically at odds with that of the first generation of artists.&lt;ref name="C7"&gt;Campbell (1998), 7&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 16th century, artists began to explore illusionistic depictions of three dimensions.&lt;ref name="h6061"&gt;Harbison (1995), 60–61&lt;/ref&gt; The painting of the early 16th century can be seen as leading directly from the artistic innovations and iconography of the previous century, with some painters, following the traditional and established formats and symbolism of the previous century, continuing to produce copies of previously painted works. Others came under the influence of [[Renaissance humanism]], turning towards secular narrative cycles, as biblical imagery was blended with mythological themes.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 319–322&lt;/ref&gt; A full break from the mid-15th-century style and subject matter was not seen until the development of [[Northern Mannerism]] around 1590. There was considerable overlap, and the early- to mid-16th-century innovations can be tied to the Mannerist style, including naturalistic secular portraiture, the depiction of ordinary (as opposed to courtly) life, and the development of elaborate landscapes and cityscapes that were more than background views.&lt;ref name="h60"&gt;Harbison (1995), 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of the Early Netherlandish school lie in the miniature paintings of the late Gothic period.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 26–7&lt;/ref&gt;  This was first seen in manuscript illumination, which after 1380 conveyed new levels of realism, perspective and skill in rendering colour,&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 25&lt;/ref&gt; peaking with the [[Limbourg brothers]] and the Netherlandish artist known as Hand G, to whom the most significant leaves of the [[Turin-Milan Hours]] are usually attributed.&lt;ref name="Harbison29" /&gt; Although his identity has not been definitively established, Hand G, who contributed c. 1420, is thought to have been either Jan van Eyck or his brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]]. According to [[Georges Hulin de Loo]], Hand G's contributions to the Turin-Milan Hours "constitute the most marvelous group of paintings that have ever decorated any book, and, for their period, the most astounding work known to the history of art".&lt;ref name ="Pächt179"&gt;Pächt (1999), 179&lt;/ref&gt;

Jan van Eyck's use of oil as a medium was a significant development, allowing artists far greater manipulation of paint. The 16th-century art historian [[Giorgio Vasari]] claimed van Eyck invented the use of oil paint; a claim that, while exaggerated,&lt;ref name="Pächt11"/&gt; indicates the extent to which van Eyck helped disseminate the technique. Van Eyck employed a new level of virtuosity, mainly from taking advantage of the fact that oil dries so slowly; this gave him more time and more scope for blending and mixing layers of different pigments,&lt;ref name="Toman 2011 322"&gt;Toman (2011), 322&lt;/ref&gt; and his technique was quickly adopted and refined by both Robert Campin and [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. These three artists are considered the first rank and most influential of the early generation of Early Netherlandish painters. Their influence was felt across northern Europe, from [[Bohemia]] and Poland in the east to Austria and [[Swabia]] in the south.&lt;ref name ="K55"/&gt;

A number of artists traditionally associated with the movement had origins that were neither Dutch nor Flemish in the modern sense. Van der Weyden was born Roger de la Pasture in [[Tournai]].&lt;ref name ="Pächt16"&gt;Pächt (1999), 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vlieghe"&gt;Vlieghe (1998), 187–200. Highlights recent instances where institutions in the [[Wallonia|French-speaking parts of Belgium]] have refused to loan painters to exhibitions labelled "Flemish".&lt;/ref&gt; The German Hans Memling and the Estonian [[Michael Sittow]] both worked in the Netherlands in a fully Netherlandish style. [[Simon Marmion]] is often regarded as an Early Netherlandish painter because he came from [[Amiens]], an area intermittently ruled by the Burgundian court between 1435 and 1471.&lt;ref name="C7" /&gt; The Burgundian duchy was at its peak influence, and the innovations made by the Netherlandish painters were soon recognised across the continent.&lt;ref name="b35"&gt;Borchert (2011), 35–36&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of van Eyck's death, his paintings were sought by wealthy patrons across Europe. Copies of his works were widely circulated, a fact that greatly contributed to the spread of the Netherlandish style to central and southern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Central European art was then under the dual influence of innovations from Italy and from the north. Often the exchange of ideas between the Low Countries and Italy led to patronage from nobility such as [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]], who commissioned manuscripts from both traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation were literate, well educated and mostly from middle-class backgrounds. Van Eyck and van der Weyden were both highly placed in the Burgundian court, with van Eyck in particular assuming roles for which an ability to read Latin was necessary; inscriptions found on his panels indicate that he had a good knowledge of both Latin and Greek.&lt;ref name="C20" /&gt;{{efn-ua|Van Eyck used elements of the [[Greek alphabet]] in his signature, and a number of [[Ghent]] painters taught members of their workshops to read and write.}} A number of artists were financially successful and much sought-after in the Low Countries and by patrons across Europe.&lt;ref name="a24"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 24–25&lt;/ref&gt; Many artists, including David and Bouts, could afford to donate large works to the churches, monasteries and convents of their choosing. Van Eyck was a [[valet de chambre]] at the Burgundian court and had easy access to Philip the Good.&lt;ref name="a24" /&gt; Van der Weyden was a prudent investor in stocks and property; Bouts was commercially minded and married the heiress Catherine "Mettengelde" ("with the money").&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Châtelet (1980), 27–28&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vrancke van der Stockt]] invested in land.&lt;ref name="C20"/&gt;

[[National Gallery of Art]], Washington. Van der Weyden moved portraiture away from idealisation and towards more naturalistic representation.&lt;ref name="V76"&gt;Van Der Elst (1944), 76&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The Early Netherlandish masters' influence reached artists such as [[Stefan Lochner]] and the painter known as the [[Master of the Life of the Virgin]], both of whom, working in mid-15th-century [[Cologne]], drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts.&lt;ref name="TB247"&gt;Borchert (2011), 247&lt;/ref&gt; New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; [[Ulm]], [[Nuremberg]], [[Vienna]] and [[Munich]] were the most important artistic centres in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] at the start of the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for [[printmaking]] (using woodcuts or copperplate [[engraving]]) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy.&lt;ref name ="K55"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 55&lt;/ref&gt; Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive artists such as [[Jan Gossaert]] made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's ''[[Madonna in the Church]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 319&lt;/ref&gt; Gerard David linked the styles of [[Bruges]] and [[Antwerp]], often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local [[Guild of Saint Luke|painters' guild]], and the two became friends.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Elst (1944), 96&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 16th century the iconographic innovations and painterly techniques developed by van Eyck had become standard throughout northern Europe. Albrecht Dürer emulated van Eyck's precision.&lt;ref name="TB101"&gt;Borchert (2011), 101&lt;/ref&gt; Painters enjoyed a new level of respect and status; patrons no longer simply commissioned works but courted the artists, sponsoring their travel and exposing them to new and wide-ranging influences. [[Hieronymus Bosch]], active in the late 15th and early 16th centuries, remains one of the most important and popular of the Netherlandish painters.&lt;ref name="t335"&gt;Toman (2011), 335&lt;/ref&gt; He was anomalous in that he largely forewent realistic depictions of nature, human existence and perspective, while his work is almost entirely free of Italian influences. His better-known works are instead characterised by fantastical elements that tend towards the hallucinatory, drawing to some extent from the vision of hell in van Eyck's ''[[Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych]]''. Bosch followed his own muse, tending instead towards moralism and pessimism. His paintings, especially the [[triptych]]s, are among the most significant and accomplished of the late Netherlandish period&lt;ref name="t335" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Hand et al. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pieter Bruegel the Elder - Hunters in the Snow (Winter) - Google Art Project.jpg|left|thumb|350px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'', 1565. [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]], Vienna. The most famous of Bruegel's several winter landscapes, the panel is indicative of how painting in the mid-16th century tended towards the secular and everyday life.]]

The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] brought changes in outlook and artistic expression as secular and landscape imagery overtook biblical scenes. Sacred imagery was shown in a didactic and moralistic manner, with religious figures becoming marginalized and relegated to the background.&lt;ref name = "A326"&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 326–327&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]], one of the few who followed Bosch's style, is an important bridge between the Early Netherlandish artists and their successors. His work retains many 15th-century conventions, but his perspective and subjects are distinctly modern. Sweeping landscapes came to the fore in paintings that were provisionally religious or mythological, and his [[genre art|genre scenes]] were complex, with overtones of religious skepticism and even hints of nationalism.&lt;ref name = "A326"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Orenstein (1998), 381–84&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique and material==
Campin, van Eyck and van der Weyden established [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]] as the dominant style in 15th-century northern European painting. These artists sought to show the world as it actually was,&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 378&lt;/ref&gt; and to depict people in a way that made them look more human, with a greater complexity of emotions than had been previously seen. This first generation of Early Netherlandish artists were interested in the accurate reproduction of objects (according to Panofsky they painted "gold that looked like gold"),&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1969), 163&lt;/ref&gt; paying close attention to natural phenomena such as light, shadow and [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]]. They moved beyond the flat [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and outlined figuration of earlier painting in favour of three-dimensional pictorial spaces. The position of viewers and how they might relate to the scene became important for the first time; in the ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', Van Eyck arranges the scene as if the viewer has just entered the room containing the two figures.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; Advancements in technique allowed far richer, more luminous and closely detailed representations of people, landscapes, interiors and objects.&lt;ref name="j9"&gt;Jones (2011), 9&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dieric Bouts - The Entombment - WGA02961.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Dieric Bouts]]'s ''[[The Entombment (Bouts)|The Entombment]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1440–55 ([[National Gallery]], London), is an austere but affecting portrayal of sorrow and grief, and one of the few surviving 15th-century glue-size paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 39–41&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Although, the use of oil as a [[Binder (material)|binding agent]] can be traced to the 12th century, innovations in its handling and manipulation define the era. [[Tempera|Egg tempera]] was the dominant medium until the 1430s, and while it produces both bright and light colours, it dries quickly and is a difficult medium in which to achieve naturalistic textures or deep shadows. Oil allows smooth, translucent surfaces and can be applied in a range of thicknesses, from fine lines to thick broad strokes. It dries slowly and is easily manipulated while still wet. These characteristics allowed more time to add subtle detail&lt;ref name="s61"&gt;Smith (2004), 61&lt;/ref&gt; and enable [[wet-on-wet]] techniques. Smooth transitions of colour are possible because portions of the intermediary layers of paint can be wiped or removed as the paint dries. Oil enables differentiation among degrees of reflective light, from shadow to bright beams,&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2011), 10–11&lt;/ref&gt; and minute depictions of light effects through the use of transparent glazes.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 22&lt;/ref&gt; This new freedom in controlling light effects gave rise to more precise and realistic depictions of surface textures; van Eyck and van der Weyden typically show light falling on surfaces such as jewellery, wooden floors, textiles and household objects.&lt;ref name="Toman 2011 322"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings were most often made on wood, but sometimes on the less expensive canvas.{{efn-ua|From contemporary records, it is estimated that about a third were painted on canvas, but as these were far less durable, most extant works are on wooden panels. See Ridderbos (2005), 297}} The wood was usually oak, often imported from the Baltic region, with the preference for radially cut boards which are less likely to warp. Typically the sap was removed and the board well-seasoned before use.&lt;ref name="C29"&gt;Campbell (1998), 29&lt;/ref&gt; Wood supports allow for [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological]] dating, and the particular use of Baltic oak gives clues as to the artist's location.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos (2005), 296–297&lt;/ref&gt; The panels generally show very high degrees of craftsmanship. [[Lorne Campbell (art historian)|Lorne Campbell]] notes that most are "beautifully made and finished objects. It can be extremely difficult to find the joins".&lt;ref name="C31"&gt;Campbell (1998), 31&lt;/ref&gt; Many paintings' frames were altered, repainted or gilded in the 18th and early 19th centuries when it was common practice to break apart hinged Netherlandish pieces so they could be sold as genre pieces. Many surviving panels are painted on both sides or with the reverse bearing family emblems, crests or ancillary outline sketches. In the case of single panels, the markings on the reverse are often wholly unrelated to the obverse and may be later additions, or as Campbell speculates, "done for the artist's amusement".&lt;ref name="C29"/&gt; Painting each side of a panel was practical since it prevented the wood from warping.&lt;ref&gt;Spronk (1997), 8&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the frames of hinged works were constructed before the individual panels were worked on.&lt;ref name="C31" /&gt;

[[Glue-size|Glue]] binder was often used as an inexpensive alternative to oil. Many works using this medium were produced but few survive today because of the delicateness of the linen cloth and the solubility of the hide glue from which the binder was derived.&lt;ref name="C29" /&gt; Well known and relatively well preserved – though substantially damaged – examples include Matsys' ''[[Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1415–25)&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/quinten-massys-the-virgin-and-child-with-saints-barbara-and-catherine The Virgin and Child with Saints Barbara and Catherine]" {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511144111/http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/quinten-massys-the-virgin-and-child-with-saints-barbara-and-catherine |date=2012-05-11 }}.

''National Gallery'', London. Retrieved 7 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The paint was generally applied with brushes or sometimes with thin sticks or brush handles. The artists often softened the contours of shadows with their fingers, at times to blot or reduce the [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]].&lt;ref name="C31"/&gt;

==Guilds and workshops==
The most usual way in the 15th century for a patron to commission a piece was to visit a master's workshop. Only a certain number of masters could operate within any city's bounds; they were regulated by artisan [[guild]]s to whom they had to be affiliated to be allowed to operate and receive commissions. Guilds protected and regulated painting, overseeing production, export trade and raw material supply; and they maintained discrete sets of rules for panel painters, cloth painters and book illuminators.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1976), 190–192&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the rules set higher citizenship requirements for miniaturists and prohibited them from using oils. Overall, panel painters enjoyed the highest level of protection, with cloth painters ranking below.&lt;ref name="A34"/&gt;

Membership of a guild was highly restricted and access was difficult for newcomers. A master was expected to serve an apprenticeship in his region, and show proof of citizenship, which could be obtained through birth in the city or by purchase.&lt;ref name="A34"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 34&lt;/ref&gt; Apprenticeship lasted four to five years, ending with the production of a "[[masterpiece]]" that proved his ability as a craftsman, and the payment of a substantial entrance fee. The system was protectionist at a local level through the nuances of the fee system. Although it sought to ensure a high quality of membership, it was a self-governing body that tended to favour wealthy applicants.&lt;ref name="h95"&gt;Harbison (1995), 64&lt;/ref&gt; Guild connections sometimes appear in paintings, most famously in van der Weyden's ''[[The Descent from the Cross (van der Weyden)|Descent from the Cross]]'', in which Christ's body is given the t-shape of a [[crossbow]] to reflect its commission for a chapel for the [[Leuven]] guild of archers.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 9–14&lt;/ref&gt;

Workshops typically consisted of a family home for the master and lodging for apprentices.&lt;ref name="J28"&gt;Jones (2011), 28&lt;/ref&gt; The masters usually built up inventories of pre-painted panels as well as patterns or outline designs for ready sale.&lt;ref name="A32"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 32&lt;/ref&gt; With the former, the master was responsible for the overall design of the painting, and typically painted the focal portions, such as the faces, hands and the embroidered parts of the figure's clothing. The more prosaic elements would be left to assistants; in many works it is possible to discern abrupt shifts in style, with the relatively weak [[Deesis]] passage in van Eyck's ''Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych'' being a better-known example.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2008), 86&lt;/ref&gt; Often a master's workshop was occupied with both the reproduction of copies of proven commercially successful works, and the design of new compositions arising from commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Jones (2011), 29&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the master would usually produce the [[underdrawing]] or overall composition to be painted by assistants.  As a result, many surviving works that evidence first-rank compositions but uninspired execution are attributed to workshop members or followers.&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 13"&gt;Chapuis (1998), 13&lt;/ref&gt;

==Patronage==

Mary is overly large, symbolizing her heavenly status.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1991), 169–187&lt;/ref&gt;]]

By the 15th century the reach and influence of the Burgundian princes meant that the Low Countries' merchant and banker classes were in the ascendancy. The early to mid-century saw great rises in international trade and domestic wealth, leading to an enormous increase in the demand for art. Artists from the area attracted patronage from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast, the north German and Polish regions, the [[Iberian Peninsula]], Italy and the powerful families of England and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; At first, masters had acted as their own dealers, attending fairs where they could also buy frames, panels and pigments.&lt;ref name="J28"/&gt; The mid-century saw the development of [[art dealer]]ship as a profession; the activity became purely commercially driven, dominated by the mercantile class.&lt;ref name="J25"/&gt;

[[File:Jacques de Guise, Chroniques de Hainaut, frontispiece, KBR 9242.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Rogier van der Weyden, ''[[Jean Wauquelin presenting his 'Chroniques de Hainaut' to Philip the Good]]'', presentation miniature, 1447–1448. [[Royal Library of Belgium]], Brussels]]
Smaller works were not usually produced on commission. More often the masters anticipated the formats and images that would be most sought after and their designs were then developed by workshop members. Ready made paintings were sold at regularly held fairs,&lt;ref name="A37"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 37&lt;/ref&gt; or the buyers could visit workshops, which tended to be clustered in certain areas of the major cities. The masters were allowed to display in their front windows. This was the typical mode for the thousands of panels produced for the middle class – city officials, clergy, guild members, doctors and merchants.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"/&gt;

Less expensive cloth paintings (''[[Glue-size|tüchlein]]'') were more common in middle-class households, and records show a strong interest in domestically owned religious panel paintings.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"/&gt; Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter. Alterations varied from having individualised panels added to a prefabricated pattern, to the inclusion of a donor portrait. The addition of coats-of-arms were often the only change – an addition seen in van der Weyden's ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'', which exists in several variations.&lt;ref name="A31"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the Burgundian dukes could afford to be extravagant in their taste.&lt;ref name="J25"/&gt; Philip the Good followed the example set earlier in France by his great-uncles including [[John, Duke of Berry]] by becoming a strong patron of the arts and commissioning a large number of artworks.&lt;ref name="patronage"&gt;Chapuis, Julien. "[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/valo_1/hd_valo_1.htm Patronage at the Early Valois Court]". ''[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]''. Retrieved 28 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The Burgundian court was seen as the arbiter of taste and their appreciation in turn drove demand for highly luxurious and expensive illuminated manuscripts, gold-edged tapestries and jewel-bordered cups. Their appetite for finery trickled down through their court and nobles to the people who for the most part commissioned local artists in Bruges and Ghent in the 1440s and 1450s. While Netherlandish panel paintings did not have intrinsic value as did for example objects in precious metals, they were perceived as precious objects and in the first rank of European art. A 1425 document written by Philip the Good explains that he hired a painter for the "excellent work that he does in his craft".&lt;ref name="J25"&gt;Jones (2011), 25&lt;/ref&gt; Jan van Eyck painted the ''[[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|Annunciation]]'' while in Philip's employ, and Rogier van der Weyden became the duke's portrait painter in the 1440s.&lt;ref name="patronage"/&gt;

[[File:Jan van Eyck The Virgin of Chancellor Rolin.jpg|left|thumb|Jan van Eyck, ''[[Madonna of Chancellor Rolin]]'', c. 1435]]
Burgundian rule created a large class of courtiers and functionaries. Some gained enormous power and commissioned paintings to display their wealth and influence.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 24, 28&lt;/ref&gt; Civic leaders also commissioned works from major artists, such as Bouts' ''[[:commons:File:Dirk Bouts - Justice of Emperor Otto III- Beheading of the Innocent Count and Ordeal by Fire - Google Art Project.jpg|Justice for Emperor Otto III]]'', van der Weyden's ''[[The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald]]'' and David's ''[[:commons:File:David Diptych The Judgment of Cambyses.jpg|Justice of Cambyses]]''.&lt;ref name ="A30"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 30&lt;/ref&gt; Civic commissions were less common and were not as lucrative, but they brought notice to and increased a painter's reputation, as with Memling, whose ''[[St John Altarpiece (Memling)|St John Altarpiece]]'' for Bruges' [[Old St. John's Hospital|Sint-Janshospitaal]] brought him additional civic commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 30, 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Wealthy foreign patronage and the development of international trade afforded the established masters the chance to build up workshops with assistants.&lt;ref name="J28" /&gt;  Although first-rank painters such as [[Petrus Christus]] and Hans Memling found patrons among the local nobility, they catered specifically to the large foreign population in Bruges.&lt;ref name="A34"/&gt; Painters not only exported goods but also themselves; foreign princes and nobility, striving to emulate the opulence of the Burgundian court, hired painters away from Bruges.&lt;ref name="A25"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua| The [[Federico da Montefeltro|Duke of Urbino]] hired [[Justus van Gent|Joos van Gent]] in c.&amp;nbsp;1473, and [[Isabella I of Castile]] – who owned a collection of 300 paintings – hired [[Michael Sittow]] and [[Juan de Flandes]] ("John of Flanders") into her service. See Ainsworth (1998a), 25–26}}

==Iconography==
[[File:The Magdalen Reading - Rogier van der Weyden.jpg|upright=1.2|thumb|Rogier van der Weyden, ''[[The Magdalen Reading]]'', before 1438. [[National Gallery]], London. This fragment is unusually rich in iconographical detail, including the Magdalen's averted eyes, her attribute of ointment, and the concept of Christ as the word represented by the book in her hands.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 392–405&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The paintings of the first generation of Netherlandish artists are often characterised by the use of symbolism and biblical references.&lt;ref name="w11"&gt;Ward (1994), 11&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck pioneered, and his innovations were taken up and developed by van der Weyden, Memling and Christus. Each employed rich and complex iconographical elements to create a heightened sense of contemporary beliefs and spiritual ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1984), 601&lt;/ref&gt; Morally the works express a fearful outlook, combined with a respect for restraint and stoicism. The paintings above all emphasise the spiritual over the earthly. Because the cult of Mary was at an apex at the time, iconographic elements related to the ''[[Life of the Virgin|Life of Mary]]'' vastly predominate.&lt;ref&gt;Powell (2006), 708&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig Harbison describes the blending of realism and symbolism as perhaps "the most important aspect of early Flemish art".&lt;ref name ="Harbison601"&gt;Harbison (1984), 601&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation of Netherlandish painters were preoccupied with making religious symbols more realistic.&lt;ref name="Harbison601"/&gt; Van Eyck incorporated a wide variety of iconographic elements, often conveying what he saw as a co-existence of the spiritual and material worlds. The iconography was embedded in the work unobtrusively; typically the references comprised small but key background details.&lt;ref name="w11" /&gt; The embedded symbols were meant to meld into the scenes and "was a deliberate strategy to create an experience of spiritual revelation".&lt;ref name = "Ward9"&gt;Ward (1994), 9&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck's religious paintings in particular "always present the spectator with a transfigured view of visible reality".&lt;ref name="Harbison589"/&gt;  To him the day-to-day is harmoniously steeped in symbolism, such that, according to Harbison, "descriptive data were rearranged&amp;nbsp;... so that they illustrated not earthly existence but what he considered supernatural truth."&lt;ref name="Harbison589"&gt;Harbison (1984), 589&lt;/ref&gt;  This blend of the earthly and heavenly evidences van Eyck's belief that the "essential truth of Christian doctrine" can be found in "the marriage of secular and sacred worlds, of reality and symbol".&lt;ref name = "H590"&gt;Harbison (1984), 590&lt;/ref&gt; He depicts overly large Madonnas, whose unrealistic size shows the separation between the heavenly from earthly, but placed them in everyday settings such as churches, domestic chambers or seated with court officials.&lt;ref name = "H590"/&gt;

Yet the earthly churches are heavily decorated with heavenly symbols. A heavenly throne is clearly represented in some domestic chambers (for example in the ''[[Lucca Madonna]]''). More difficult to discern are the settings for paintings such as ''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'', where the location is a fusion of the earthly and celestial.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1984), 590–592&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Eyck's iconography is often so densely and intricately layered that a work has to be viewed multiple times before even the most obvious meaning of an element is apparent. The symbols were often subtly woven into the paintings so that they only became apparent after close and repeated viewing,&lt;ref name="w11" /&gt; while much of the iconography reflects the idea that, according to John Ward, there is a "promised passage from sin and death to salvation and rebirth".&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1994), 26&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists employed symbolism in a more prosaic manner, despite van Eyck's great influence on both his contemporaries and later artists. Campin showed a clear separation between spiritual and earthly realms; unlike van Eyck, he did not employ a programme of concealed symbolism. Campin's symbols do not alter the sense of the real; in his paintings a domestic scene is no more complicated than a one showing religious iconography, but one the viewer would recognise and understand.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1984), 591–593&lt;/ref&gt; Van der Weyden's symbolism was far more nuanced than Campin's but not as dense as van Eyck's. According to Harbison, van der Weyden incorporated his symbols so carefully, and in such an exquisite manner, that "Neither the mystical union that results in his work, nor his reality itself for that matter, seems capable of being rationally analyzed, explained or reconstructed."&lt;ref name="h596"&gt;Harbison (1984), 596&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment of architectural details, [[Niche (architecture)|niches]], colour and space is presented in such an inexplicable manner that "the particular objects or people we see before us have suddenly, jarringly, become symbols with religious truth".&lt;ref name="h596" /&gt;

Paintings and other precious objects served an important aid in the religious life of those who could afford them. Prayer and meditative contemplation were means to attain salvation, while the very wealthy could also build churches (or extend existing ones), or commission artworks or other devotional pieces as a means to guarantee salvation in the afterlife.&lt;ref name="j14"&gt;Jones (2011), 14&lt;/ref&gt; Vast numbers of Virgin and Child paintings were produced, and original designs were widely copied and exported. Many of the paintings were based on [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] prototypes of the 12th and 13th century, of which the ''[[Cambrai Madonna]]'' is probably the best known.&lt;ref name="h159"&gt;Harbison (1991), 159–160&lt;/ref&gt; In this way the traditions of the earlier centuries were absorbed and re-developed as a distinctly rich and complex iconographical tradition.&lt;ref name="j14" /&gt;

Marian devotion grew from the 13th century, mostly forming around the concepts of the [[Immaculate Conception]] and her [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption into heaven]]. In a culture that venerated the possession of [[relic]]s as a means to bring the earthly closer to the divine, Mary left no bodily relics, thus assuming a special position between heaven and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch (2005), 18&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 15th century, Mary had grown in importance within the Christian doctrine to the extent that she was commonly seen as the most accessible intercessor with God. It was thought that the length each person would need to suffer in [[limbo]] was proportional to their display of devotion while on earth.&lt;ref&gt;MacCulloch (2005), 11–13&lt;/ref&gt; The veneration of Mary reached a peak in the early 15th century, an era that saw an unending demand for works depicting her likeness. From the mid-15th century, Netherlandish portrayals of the life of Christ tended to be centred on the iconography of the [[Man of Sorrows]].&lt;ref name="j14" /&gt;

Those who could afford to commissioned [[donor portrait]]s. Such a commission was usually executed as part of a triptych, or later as a more affordable diptych. Van der Weyden popularised the existing northern tradition of half-length [[Madonna (art)|Marian portraits]]. These echoed the "miracle-working" Byzantine icons then popular in Italy. The format became extremely popular across the north, and his innovations are an important contributing factor to the emergence of the Marian diptych.&lt;ref name="thb206"&gt;Borchert (2011), 206&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formats==
Although the Netherlandish artists are primarily known for their panel paintings, their output includes a variety of formats, including illuminated manuscripts, sculpture, tapestries, carved [[retable]]s, [[stained glass]], brass objects and carved [[tomb]]s.&lt;ref name="sn87"&gt;Nash (2008), 87&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian [[Susie Nash]], by the early 16th century, the region led the field in almost every aspect of portable visual culture, "with specialist expertise and techniques of production at such a high level that no one else could compete with them".&lt;ref name="sn87" /&gt; The Burgundian court favoured tapestry and [[metalwork]], which are well recorded in surviving documentation, while demand for panel paintings is less evident&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"&gt;Campbell (1976) 188–189&lt;/ref&gt; – they may have been less suited to itinerant courts. Wall hangings and books functioned as political propaganda and as a means to showcase wealth and power, whereas portraits were less favoured. According to Maryan Ainsworth, those that were commissioned functioned to highlight lines of succession, such as van der Weyden's [[commons:File:Rogier van der Weyden - Portrait of Charles the Bold - WGA25709.jpg|portrait]] of Charles the Bold; or for betrothals as in the case of van Eyck's lost ''[[Portrait of Isabella of Portugal (van Eyck)|Portrait of Isabella of Portugal]]''.&lt;ref name ="Ainsworth24"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 24&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious paintings were commissioned for royal and ducal palaces, for churches, hospitals, and convents, and for wealthy clerics and private donors. The richer cities and towns commissioned works for their civic buildings.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1976 188–189"/&gt; Artists often worked in more than one medium; van Eyck and Petrus Christus are both thought to have contributed to manuscripts. Van der Weyden designed tapestries, though few survive.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo (1993), 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cleland (2002), i–ix&lt;/ref&gt; The Netherlandish painters were responsible for many innovations, including the advancement of the diptych format, the conventions of [[donor portrait]]s, new conventions for Marian portraits, and, through works such as van Eyck's ''Madonna of Chancellor Rolin'' and van der Weyden's ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'' in the 1430s, laying the foundation for the development of [[landscape art|landscape painting]] as a separate genre.&lt;ref name="Jones 2011 30"&gt;Jones (2011), 30&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illuminated manuscript===

Before the mid-15th century, illuminated books were considered a higher form of art than panel painting, and their ornate and luxurious qualities better reflected the wealth, status and taste of their owners.&lt;ref name="h47"&gt;Harbison (1995), 47&lt;/ref&gt; Manuscripts were ideally suited as [[diplomatic gift]]s or offerings to commemorate dynastic marriages or other major courtly occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 27&lt;/ref&gt; From the 12th century, specialist monastery-based workshops (in French ''libraires'') produced [[books of hours]] (collections of prayers to be said at [[canonical hours]]), [[psalter]]s, prayer books and histories, as well as romance and poetry books. At the start of the 15th century, Gothic manuscripts from Paris dominated the northern European market. Their popularity was in part due to the production of more affordable, single leaf miniatures which could be inserted into unillustrated books of hours. These were at times offered in a serial manner designed to encourage patrons to "include as many pictures as they could afford", which clearly presented them as an item of fashion but also as form of [[indulgence]]. The single leaves had other uses rather than inserts; they could be attached to walls as aids to private meditation and prayer,&lt;ref name="w233"&gt;Wieck (1996), 233&lt;/ref&gt; as seen in Christus' 1450–60 panel ''Portrait of a Young Man'', now in the [[National Gallery]], which shows a small leaf with text to the ''[[Veil of Veronica|Vera icon]]'' illustrated with the head of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/petrus-christus-portrait-of-a-young-man Portrait of a Young Man]". ''[[National Gallery]]'', London. Retrieved 4 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The French artists were overtaken in importance from the mid-15th century by masters in Ghent, Bruges and [[Utrecht]]. English production, once of the highest quality, had greatly declined and relatively few Italian manuscripts went north of the Alps. The French masters did not give up their position easily however, and even in 1463 were urging their guilds to impose sanctions on the Netherlandish artists.&lt;ref name="w233" /&gt;

The [[Limbourg brothers]]'s ornate ''[[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]'' perhaps marks both the beginning and a highpoint of Netherlandish illumination. Later the [[Master of the Legend of Saint Lucy]] explored the same mix of illusionism and realism.&lt;ref name="Harbison29"/&gt; The Limbourgs' career ended just as van Eyck's began – by 1416 all the brothers (none of whom had reached 30) and their patron Jean, Duke of Berry were dead, most likely from [[Black death|plague]].&lt;ref name="Harbison29" /&gt; Van Eyck is thought to have contributed several of the more acclaimed [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] of the Turin-Milan Hours as the anonymous artist known as Hand G.&lt;ref&gt;Kren (2010), 83&lt;/ref&gt; A number of illustrations from the period show a strong stylistic resemblance to Gerard David, though it is unclear whether they are from his hands or those of followers.&lt;ref&gt;Hand et al. (2006), 63&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Livre du cœur d'amour épris - vindobo2597 - f25v.jpg|thumb|left|320px|[[Barthélemy d'Eyck]]'s chivalrous and romantic leaf from his "Livre du cœur d'Amour épris", c.&amp;nbsp;1458–60]]
A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of [[Liturgical book|liturgical texts]].&lt;ref name="w233"&gt;Wieck (1996), 233&lt;/ref&gt; There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death.&lt;ref name="Metmanuscripts"&gt;Jones, Susan. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/manu/hd_manu.htm "Manuscript Illumination in Northern Europe"]. ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art''. Retrieved 11 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas Kren, Philip's "library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety".&lt;ref name="k8"/&gt; Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and [[Margaret of York]]; his granddaughter [[Mary of Burgundy]] and her husband [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]]; and to his son-in-law, [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]], who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the [[Royal Library of Belgium]] and the [[Royal manuscripts, British Library|English Royal Library]].&lt;ref&gt;Kren (2010), 20–24&lt;/ref&gt;

Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, [[James IV of Scotland]] and [[Eleanor of Viseu]].&lt;ref name="sn93"&gt;Nash (2008), 93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Folio 153r - The Death of Christ.jpg|thumb|140|Limbourg brothers, ''The Death of Christ'', folio 153r, [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]].]]
There was considerable overlap between panel painting and illumination; van Eyck, van der Weyden, Christus and other painters designed manuscript miniatures. In addition, miniaturists would borrow motifs and ideas from panel paintings; Campin's work was often used as a source in this way, for example in the "Hours of Raoul d'Ailly".&lt;ref name="nash428"&gt;Nash (1995), 428&lt;/ref&gt; Commissions were often shared between several masters, with junior painters or specialists assisting, especially with details such as the border decorations, these last often done by women.&lt;ref name="w233" /&gt; The masters rarely signed their work, making attribution difficult; the identities of some of the more significant illuminators are lost.&lt;ref name="k8"&gt;Kren (2010), 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="n22" /&gt;

Netherlandish artists found increasingly inventive ways to highlight and differentiate their work from manuscripts from surrounding countries; such techniques included designing elaborate page borders and devising ways to relate scale and space. They explored the interplay between the three essential components of a manuscript: border, miniature and text.&lt;ref name="sn923"&gt;Nash (2008), 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the [[Hours of Mary of Burgundy|Nassau book of hours]] (c.&amp;nbsp;1467–80) by the [[Vienna Master of Mary of Burgundy]], in which the borders are decorated with large illusionistic flowers and insects. These elements achieved their effect by being broadly painted, as if scattered across the gilded surface of the miniatures. This technique was continued by, among others, the Flemish [[Master of James IV of Scotland]] (possibly [[Gerard Horenbout]]),&lt;ref name="sn94"&gt;Nash (2008), 94&lt;/ref&gt; known for his innovative page layout. Using various illusionistic elements, he often blurred the line between the miniature and its border, frequently using both in his efforts to advance the narrative of his scenes.&lt;ref name="Harbison29"&gt;Harbison (1995), 29&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 19th century, the collection of 15th- and 16th-century Netherlandish cut-out, as miniatures or parts for albums, became fashionable amongst connoisseurs such as [[William Young Ottley]], leading to the destruction of many manuscripts. Originals were highly sought after, a revival that helped the rediscovery of Netherlandish art in the later part of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Wieck (1996), 234–237&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tapestry===
[[File:The Mystic Capture of the Unicorn, fragment (2).jpg|thumb|left|200px|"The Mystic Capture of the Unicorn", fragment from ''[[The Hunt of the Unicorn]]'', 1495–1505. [[The Cloisters]], New York]]

During the mid-15th century, [[tapestry]] was one of the most expensive and prized artistic products in Europe. Commercial production proliferated across the Netherlands and northern France from the early 15th century, especially in the cities of [[Arras]], Bruges and [[Tournai]]. The perceived technical ability of these artisans was such that, in 1517, [[Pope Julius II]] sent [[Raphael]]'s [[Raphael Cartoons|cartoons]] to Brussels to be woven into hangings.&lt;ref name="n88"&gt;Nash (2008), 88&lt;/ref&gt; Such woven wall hangings played a central political role as diplomatic gifts, especially in their larger format; Philip the Good gifted several to participants at the [[Congress of Arras]] in 1435,&lt;ref name="sn87" /&gt; where the halls were draped from top to bottom and all around (''tout autour'') with tapestries showing scenes of the "Battle and Overthrow of People of Liege".&lt;ref name = "Freeman1"/&gt; At Charles the Bold and Margaret of York's wedding the room "was hung above with draperies of wool, blue and white, and on the sides was tapestried with a rich tapestry woven with the history of Jason and the Golden Fleece". Rooms typically were hung from ceiling to floor with tapestries and some rooms named for a set of tapestries, such as a chamber Philip the Bold named for a set of white tapestries with scenes from ''[[Roman de la Rose|The Romance of the Rose]]''.&lt;ref name = "Freeman1"&gt;Freeman (1973), 1&lt;/ref&gt; For about two centuries during the Burgundian period, master weavers produced "innumerable series of hangings heavy with gold and silver thread, the like of which the world had never seen".&lt;ref&gt;Phillip (1947), 123&lt;/ref&gt;

The practical use of textiles results from their portability; tapestries provided easily assembled interior decorations suited to religious or civic ceremonies.&lt;ref name="n264"&gt;Nash (2008), 264&lt;/ref&gt; Their value is reflected in their positioning in contemporary inventories, in which they are typically found at the top of the record, then ranked in accordance with their material or colouring. White and gold were considered of the highest quality. [[Charles V of France]] had 57 tapestries, of which 16 were white. [[John, Duke of Berry|Jean de Berry]] owned 19, while [[Mary of Burgundy]], [[Isabella of Valois]], [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] and Philip the Good all held substantial collections.&lt;ref name="n266"&gt;Nash (2008), 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Tapestry production began with design.&lt;ref name="Cavallo 1973, 21"&gt;Cavallo (1973), 21&lt;/ref&gt; The designs, or [[Cartoon#Fine art|cartoons]] were typically executed on paper or parchment, put together by qualified painters, then sent to weavers, often across a great distance. Because cartoons could be re-used, craftsmen often worked on source material that was decades old. As both paper and parchment are highly perishable, few of the original cartoons survive.&lt;ref name="n209"&gt;Nash (2008), 209&lt;/ref&gt; Once a design was agreed upon its production might be farmed out among many weavers. Looms were active in all the major Flemish cities, in most of the towns and in many of the villages.&lt;ref name="Cavallo 1973, 21"/&gt;

[[File:Tapestry with Scenes from the Passion of Christ.jpg|thumb|513px|Unknown Flemish weaver, ''Tapestry with Scenes from the Passion of Christ'', c.&amp;nbsp;1470–90. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam]]
Looms were not controlled by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo (1973), 12&lt;/ref&gt; The entrepreneur was in direct contact with the patron, and they would often go through the nuances of the design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by [[Colart de Laon]]&lt;ref name="Cavallo 1973, 21"/&gt; having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.&lt;ref name="n209" /&gt;

Because tapestries were designed largely by painters, their formal conventions are closely aligned with the conventions of panel painting. This is especially true with the later generations of 16th-century painters who produced panoramas of heaven and hell. Harbison describes how the intricate, dense and overlaid detail of Bosch's ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights|Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' resembles, "in its precise symbolism&amp;nbsp;... a medieval tapestry".&lt;ref&gt;Harbison (1995), 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Triptychs and altarpieces===
Northern [[triptych]]s{{efn-ua|The word ''triptych'' did not exist during the era; the works were known as "paintings with doors". See Jacobs (2011), 8}} and [[polyptych]]s were popular across Europe from the late 14th century, with the peak of demand lasting until the early 16th century. During the 15th century, they were the most widely produced format of northern panel painting. Preoccupied with religious subject matter, they come in two broad types: smaller, portable private devotional works, or larger altarpieces for [[liturgy|liturgical]] settings.&lt;ref name="j1009"&gt;Jacobs (2000), 1009&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest northern examples are compound works incorporating engraving and painting, usually with two painted wings that could be folded over a carved central corpus.{{efn-ua|In 14th-century altarpieces the "nature of the subject" was most important; generally the more sacred the subject the more decorative and elaborate its treatment. See Huizinga (2009), 22}}&lt;ref name="b35" /&gt;

[[File:The Braque Triptych interior.jpg|thumb|560px|left|Rogier van der Weyden, ''[[Braque Triptych]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1452. Oil on oak panels. [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris. This triptych is noted for the floating "speech" inscriptions, and for the landscape uniting the panels.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 89&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Polyptychs were produced by the more accomplished masters. They provide greater scope for variation, and a greater number of possible combinations of interior and exterior panels that could be viewed at one time. That hinged works could be opened and closed served a practical purpose; on religious holidays the more prosaic and everyday outer panels were replaced by the lush interior panels.&lt;ref name="t319"&gt;Toman (2011), 319&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', completed in 1432, had different configurations for weekdays, Sundays and church holidays.{{efn-ua|The work comprises 12 exterior and 14 interior painted panels, and the different possible combinations of panels produced different intended meanings. See Toman (2011), 319}}&lt;ref name="t319" /&gt;

The first generation of Netherlandish masters borrowed many customs from 13th- and 14th-century Italian altarpieces.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs (2011), 26–28&lt;/ref&gt; The conventions for Italian triptychs before 1400 were quite rigid. In central panels the mid-ground was populated by members of the [[Holy Family]]; early works, especially from the [[Siena|Sienese]] or Florentine traditions, were overwhelmingly characterised by images of the enthroned Virgin set against a gilded background. The wings usually contain a variety of angels, donors and saints, but there is never direct eye contact, and only rarely a narrative connection, with the central panel's figures.&lt;ref name="b116"&gt;Blum (1972), 116&lt;/ref&gt; Netherlandish painters adapted many of these conventions, but subverted them almost from the start. Van der Weyden was especially innovative, as apparent in his 1442–45 ''[[Miraflores Altarpiece]]'' and c.&amp;nbsp;1452 ''[[Braque Triptych]]''. In these paintings members of the Holy Family appear on the wings instead of just the central panels, while the latter is notable for the continuous landscape connecting the three inner panels.&lt;ref&gt;Acres (2000), 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1490s Hieronymus Bosch painted at least 16 triptychs,{{efn-ua|Of which three are documented but lost, eight survive fully intact, and five exist in fragments. See Jacobs (2000), 1010}} the best of which subverted existing conventions. Bosch's work continued the move towards secularism and emphasised landscape. Bosch also unified the scenes of the inner panels.&lt;ref name="j1009" /&gt;

[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - Hermit Saints Triptych.jpg|thumb|480px|[[Hieronymus Bosch]], ''[[The Hermit Saints]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1493. [[Doge's Palace, Venice]]]]

Triptychs were commissioned by German patrons from the 1380s, with large-scale export beginning around 1400.&lt;ref name="b35" /&gt; Few of these very early examples survive,&lt;ref name="Borchert 2011, 35"&gt;Borchert (2011), 35&lt;/ref&gt; but the demand for Netherlandish altarpieces throughout Europe is evident from the many surviving examples still extant in churches across the continent. [[Till-Holger Borchert]] describes how they bestowed a "prestige which, in the first half of the 15th century, only the workshops of the Burgundian Netherlands were capable of achieving".&lt;ref name="B52"&gt;Borchert (2011), 52&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1390s, Netherlandish altarpieces were produced mostly in Brussels and Bruges. The popularity of Brussels' altarpieces lasted until about 1530, when the output of the Antwerp workshops grew in favour. This was in part because they produced at a lower cost by allocating different portions of the panels among specialised workshop members, a practice Borchert describes as an early form of [[division of labour]].&lt;ref name="B52"/&gt;

Multi-panel Netherlandish paintings fell out of favour and were considered old-fashioned as Antwerp Mannerism came to the fore in the mid-16th century. Later the [[iconoclasm]] of the Reformation deemed them offensive,&lt;ref name="c405"/&gt; and many works in the Low Countries were destroyed. Extant examples are found mostly in German churches and monasteries.&lt;ref name="b35"/&gt; As secular works grew in demand, triptychs were often broken up and sold as individual works, especially if a panel or section contained an image that could pass as a secular portrait. A panel would sometimes be cut down to only the figure, with the background over-painted so that "it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch 17th-century paintings".&lt;ref name="c405"&gt;Campbell (1998), 405&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diptychs===
[[Diptych]]s were widely popular in northern Europe from the mid-15th to the early 16th century. They consisted of two equally sized panels joined by hinges (or, less often, a fixed frame);&lt;ref name="p100"&gt;Pearson (2000), 100&lt;/ref&gt; the panels were usually linked thematically. Hinged panels could be opened and closed like a book, allowing both an interior and exterior view, while the ability to close the wings allowed protection of the inner images.&lt;ref name="p99" /&gt; Originating from conventions in [[Book of Hours|Books of Hours]], diptychs typically functioned as less expensive and more portable altarpieces.&lt;ref name="s144"&gt;Smith (2004), 144&lt;/ref&gt; Diptychs are distinct from pendants in that they are physically connected wings and not merely two paintings hung side by side.&lt;ref name="Smith 2004, 134"&gt;Smith (2004), 134&lt;/ref&gt; They were usually near-miniature in scale, and some emulated medieval "treasury art" -small pieces made of gold or ivory. The [[tracery]] seen in works such as van der Weyden's ''[[Virgin and Child Enthroned (van der Weyden)|Virgin and Child]]'' reflects ivory carving of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2006), 175&lt;/ref&gt; The format was adapted by van Eyck and van der Weyden on commission from members of the [[House of Valois-Burgundy]],&lt;ref name="p99"&gt;Pearson (2000), 99&lt;/ref&gt; and refined by [[Hugo van der Goes]], Hans Memling and later [[Jan van Scorel]].&lt;ref name="Smith 2004, 134"/&gt;

[[File:Seguace di dirck bouts, dittico con mater dolorosa e cristo coronato di spine, 1450-1500 ca. 01.JPG|thumb|300px|[[Dieric Bouts]], ''[[Mater Dolorosa]]/[[Ecce Homo]]'', after 1450, a rare surviving diptych with intact frame and hinges]]
Netherlandish diptychs tend to illustrate only a small range of religious scenes. There are numerous depictions of the Virgin and Child,&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 178&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the Virgin's contemporary popularity as a subject of devotion.&lt;ref name="H3"/&gt; The inner panels consisted mainly of donor portraits – often of husbands and their wives&lt;ref name="Smith 2004, 134"/&gt; – alongside saints or the Virgin and Child.&lt;ref name="p99" /&gt; The donor was nearly always shown kneeling in full or half length, with hands clasped in prayer.&lt;ref name="p99" /&gt; The Virgin and Child are always positioned on the right, reflecting the Christian reverence for the right hand side as the "place of honour" alongside the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Hulin de Loo (1923), 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Their development and commercial worth has been linked to a change in religious attitude during the 14th century, when a more meditative and solitary devotion – exemplified by the [[Devotio Moderna]] movement – grew in popularity. Private reflection and prayer was encouraged and the small-scale diptych fitted this purpose. It became popular among the newly emerging middle class and the more affluent monasteries across the Low Countries and northern Germany.&lt;ref name="H3"/&gt; Ainsworth says that regardless of size, whether a large altarpiece or a small diptych, Netherlandish painting is a "matter of small scale and meticulous detail". The small size was meant to entice the viewer into a meditative state for personal devotion and perhaps the "experience of miraculous visions".&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998c), 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 20th-century technical examination has shown significant differences in technique and style between the panels of individual diptychs. The technical inconsistencies may be the result of the workshop system, in which the more prosaic passages were often completed by assistants. A change in style between panels can be seen, according to historian John Hand, because the divine panel was usually based on general designs sold on the open market, with the donor panel added after a patron was found.&lt;ref name="H16"&gt;Hand et al. (2006), 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Few intact diptychs survive. As with altarpieces, the majority were later separated and sold as single "genre" pictures.&lt;ref name="c405"/&gt; In the workshop system some were interchangeable, and the religious works may have been paired with newly commissioned donor panels. Later many diptychs were broken apart, thus creating two saleable works from one. During the Reformation, religious scenes were often removed.&lt;ref name="Borchert182ff"&gt;Borchert (2006), 182–185&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portraiture===
[[File:Hugo van der Goes 007.jpg|thumb|240px|left|[[Hugo van der Goes]], ''Portrait of a Man'', c.&amp;nbsp;1480. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York]]

Secular portraiture was a rarity in European art before 1430. The format did not exist as a separate genre and was only found infrequently at the highest end of the market in betrothal portraits or royal family commissions.&lt;ref&gt;Huizinga (2009 ed.), 225&lt;/ref&gt; While such undertakings may have been profitable, they were considered a lower art form and the majority of surviving pre-16th-century examples are unattributed.&lt;ref name ="Ainsworth24"/&gt; Large numbers of single devotional panels showing saints and biblical figures were being produced, but depictions of historical, known individuals did not begin until the early 1430s. Van Eyck was the pioneer;&lt;ref&gt;Bauman (1986), 4&lt;/ref&gt; his seminal 1432 ''[[Léal Souvenir]]'' is one of the earliest surviving examples, emblematic of the new style in its realism and acute observation of the small details of the sitter's appearance.&lt;ref name = "Kemperdick19"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 19&lt;/ref&gt; His ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' is filled with symbolism,&lt;ref name ="Dhanens198"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 198&lt;/ref&gt; as is the ''Madonna of Chancelor Rolin'', commissioned as testament to Rolin's power, influence, and piety.&lt;ref name ="Dhanens269"&gt;Dhanens (1980), 269–270&lt;/ref&gt;

Van der Weyden developed the conventions of northern portraiture and was hugely influential on the following generations of painters. Rather than merely follow van Eyck's meticulous attention to detail, van der Weyden created more abstract and sensual representations. He was highly sought after as a portraitist, yet there are noticeable similarities in his portraits, likely because he used and reused the same underdrawings, which met common ideals of rank and piety. These were then adapted to show the facial characteristics and expressions of the particular sitter.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 21–23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Petrus Christus - Portrait of a Young Woman - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Petrus Christus]], ''[[Portrait of a Young Girl (Christus)|Portrait of a Young Girl]]'', after 1460, [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]. One of the first portraits to present its sitter in a three-dimensional room. Many sources mention her enigmatic and complex expression, and petulant, reserved gaze.&lt;ref name="VDE69"&gt;Van der Elst (1944), 69&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Petrus Christus placed his sitter in a naturalistic setting rather than a flat and featureless background. This approach was in part a reaction against van der Weyden, who, in his emphasis on sculptural figures, utilised very shallow pictorial spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 104–107&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1462 ''[[:commons:File:Bouts Portrait of a Man 1462.jpg|Portrait of a Man]]'', Dieric Bouts went further by situating the man in a room complete with a window that looks out at a landscape,&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 23&lt;/ref&gt; while in the 16th century, the full-length portrait became popular in the north. The latter format was practically unseen in earlier northern art, although it had a tradition in Italy going back centuries, most usually in [[fresco]] and illuminated manuscripts.&lt;ref name="k26"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 26&lt;/ref&gt; Full-length portraits were reserved for depictions of the highest echelon of society, and were associated with princely displays of power.&lt;ref name="k28" /&gt; Of the second generation of northern painters, Hans Memling became the leading portraitist, taking commissions from as far as Italy. He was highly influential on later painters and is credited with inspiring [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]]'s positioning of the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' in front of a landscape view.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 24&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck and van der Weyden similarly influenced the French artist [[Jean Fouquet]] and the Germans [[Hans Pleydenwurff]]&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 25&lt;/ref&gt; and Martin Schongauer among others.&lt;ref&gt;Borchert (2011), 277–283&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlandish artists moved away from the profile view – popularised during the Italian [[Quattrocento]] – towards the less formal but more engaging three-quarter view. At this angle, more than one side of the face is visible as the sitter's body is rotated towards the viewer. This pose gives a better view of the shape and features of the head and allows the sitter to look out towards the viewer.&lt;ref name ="Smith96"/&gt; The gaze of the sitter rarely engages the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 21&lt;/ref&gt; Van Eyck's 1433 ''[[Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)|Portrait of a Man]]'' is an early example, which shows the artist himself looking at the viewer.&lt;ref name ="Smith96"&gt;Smith (2004), 96&lt;/ref&gt;  Although there is often direct eye contact between subject and viewer, the look is normally detached, aloof and uncommunicative, perhaps to reflect the subject's high social position. There are exceptions, typically in bridal portraits or in the case of potential [[betrothal]]s, when the object of the work is to make the sitter as attractive as possible. In these cases the sitter was often shown smiling, with an engaging and radiant expression designed to appeal to her intended.&lt;ref&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 21, 92&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 1508, Albrecht Dürer described the function of portraiture as "preserving a person's appearance after his death".&lt;ref&gt;''Awch behelt daz gemell dy gestalt der menschen nach jrem sterben'' See Rupprich, Hans (ed). "Dürer". ''Schriftlicher Nachlass'', Volume 3. Berlin, 1966. 9&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Dürer's father, a goldsmith, spent time as a journeyman in the Netherlands and met with, according to his son, "the great artists". Dürer himself travelled there between 1520 and 1521 and visited Bruges, Ghent and Brussels among other places. See Borchert (2011), 83}} Portraits were objects of status, and served to ensure that the individual's personal success was recorded and would endure beyond his lifetime. Most portraits tended to show royalty, the upper nobility or princes of the church. The new affluence in the Burgundian Netherlands brought a wider variety of clientele, as members of the upper middle class could now afford to commission a portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 95&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, more is known about the appearance and dress of the region's people than at any time since the late Roman period. Portraits did not generally require lengthy sittings; typically a series of preparatory drawings were used to flesh out the final panel. Very few of these drawings survive, a notable exception being [[:commons:File:Jan van Eyck - Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati - Google Art Project.jpg|van Eyck's study]] for his ''[[Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati]]''.&lt;ref name="k28"&gt;Kemperdick (2006), 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Landscape===

Christ and thief before a view of Jerusalem, c.&amp;nbsp;1430. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York. The Crucifixion panel in this diptych is framed within an azure sky against a distant view of [[Jerusalem]].]]
Landscape was a secondary concern to Netherlandish painters before the mid 1460s. Geographical settings were rare and when they did appear usually consisted of glimpses through open windows or [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]]. They were rarely based on actual locations;{{efn-ua|[[Konrad Witz]]'s ''[[The Miraculous Draft of Fishes (Witz)|Miraculous Draft of Fishes]]'' of 1444 is credited as the earliest extant faithful portrayal in European art history of a landscape based on observation of real topographical features. See Borchert (2011), 58}} the settings tended to be largely imagined, designed to suit the thematic thrust of the panel. Because most of the works were donor portraits, very often the landscapes were tame, controlled and served merely to provide a harmonious setting for the idealised interior space. In this, the northern artists lagged behind their Italian counterparts who were already placing their sitters within geographically identifiable and closely described landscapes.&lt;ref name="h134"&gt;Harbison (1995), 134&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the northern landscapes are highly detailed and notable in their own right, including van Eyck's unsentimental c.&amp;nbsp;1430 ''[[Crucifixion and Last Judgement diptych]]'' and van der Weyden's widely copied 1435–40 ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]''.&lt;ref name="Jones 2011 30"/&gt;

Van Eyck was almost certainly influenced by the [[Labours of the Months]] landscapes the Limbourg brothers painted for the ''Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry''. The influence can be seen in the illuminations painted in the [[Turin-Milan Hours]], which show rich landscapes in the tiny ''bas de page'' scenes.&lt;ref name ="Pächt29"&gt;Pächt (1999), 29&lt;/ref&gt; These, according to Pächt, should be defined as early examples of Netherlandish landscape painting.&lt;ref name ="Pächt187"&gt;Pächt (1999), 187&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape tradition in illuminated manuscripts would continue for at least the next century. [[Simon Bening]] "explored new territory in the genre of landscape", seen in several of the leaves he painted for the c. 1520 ''[[Grimani|Grimani Breviary]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth (1998b), 392&lt;/ref&gt;

From the late 15th century, a number of painters emphasised landscape in their works, a development led in part by the shift in preference from religious iconography to secular subjects.&lt;ref name="h60" /&gt; Second-generation Netherlandish painters applied the mid-14th-century dictum of natural representation. This was born of the rising affluence of the region's middle class, many of whom had now travelled south and seen countryside noticeably different from their flat homeland. At the same time, the later part of the century saw the emergence of specialisation and a number of masters focused on detailing landscape, most notably [[Konrad Witz]] in the mid-15th century, and later [[Joachim Patinir]].&lt;ref name="h61"&gt;Harbison (1995), 61&lt;/ref&gt; Most innovations in this format came from artists living in the Dutch regions of the Burgundian lands, most notably from [[Haarlem]], [[Leiden]] and [['s-Hertogenbosch]]. The significant artists from these areas did not slavishly reproduce the scenery before them, but in subtle ways adapted and modified their landscapes to reinforce the emphasis and meaning of the panel they were working on.&lt;ref name="h134" /&gt;

Patinir developed what is now called the [[world landscape]] genre, which is typified by biblical or historical figures within an imagined panoramic landscape, usually mountains and lowlands, water and buildings. Paintings of this type are characterised by an elevated viewpoint, with the figures dwarfed by their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Wood (1993), 42–47&lt;/ref&gt; The format was taken up by, among others, Gerard David and Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and became popular in Germany, especially with painters from the [[Danube school]]. Patinir's works are relatively small and use a horizontal format; this was to become so standard for landscapes in art that it is now called "landscape" format in ordinary contexts, but at the time it was a considerable novelty, as the vast majority of panel paintings before 1520 were vertical in format.&lt;ref&gt;Wood (1993), 47&lt;/ref&gt; World landscape paintings retain many of the elements developed from the mid-15th century, but are composed, in modern cinematic terms, as a [[long shot|long]] rather than a [[medium shot]]. The human presence remained central rather than serving as mere [[staffage]]. Hieronymus Bosch adapted elements of the world landscape style, with the influence especially notable in his single-panel paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1986), 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The most popular subjects of this type include the [[Flight into Egypt]] and the plight of hermits such as Saints [[Jerome]] and [[Anthony the Great|Anthony]]. As well as connecting the style to the later [[Age of Discovery]], the role of Antwerp as a booming centre both of world trade and [[cartography]], and the wealthy town-dweller's view of the countryside, art historians have explored the paintings as religious metaphors for the pilgrimage of life.&lt;ref&gt;Silver (1986), 26–36; Wood, 274–275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to the Italian Renaissance==
[[File:Hugo van der Goes - Triptyque Portinari, détail 4.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Hugo van der Goes]], detail from the ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1475. [[Uffizi]], Florence]]
The progressions in northern art developed almost simultaneously with the early [[Italian Renaissance]]. The philosophical and artistic traditions of the Mediterranean were not however part of the northern heritage, to the extent that many elements of Latin culture were actively disparaged in the north.&lt;ref name="Toman, 317"&gt;Toman (2011), 317&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Renaissance humanism in art, for example, was less pronounced in the Low Countries than in Italy. Local religious trends had a strong influence on early northern art, as can be seen in the subject matter, composition and form of many late 13th- and early 14th-century artworks.&lt;ref name="H3"&gt;Hand et al. (2006), 3&lt;/ref&gt; The northern painters' doctrine was also built on elements of recent Gothic tradition,&lt;ref name="Toman, 317"/&gt; and less on the classical tradition prevalent in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 40&lt;/ref&gt;

While devotional paintings – especially altarpieces – remained dominant in Early Netherlandish art,&lt;ref name="Toman, 317" /&gt; secular portraiture became increasingly common in both northern and southern Europe as artists freed themselves from the prevailing idea that portraiture should be restricted to saints and other religious figures. In Italy this development was tied to the ideals of [[humanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Toman (2011), 198&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian influences on Netherlandish art are first apparent in the late 15th century, when some of the painters began to travel south. This also explains why a number of later Netherlandish artists became associated with, in the words of art historian Rolf Toman, "picturesque gables, bloated, barrel-shaped columns, droll cartouches, 'twisted' figures, and stunningly unrealistic colours – actually employ[ing] the visual language of Mannerism".&lt;ref name="Toman, 317"/&gt; Wealthy northern merchants could afford to buy paintings from the top tier of artists. As a result, painters became increasingly aware of their status in society: they signed their works more often, painted portraits of themselves, and became well-known figures because of their artistic activities.&lt;ref name="C20"&gt;Campbell (1998), 20&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Memling 061.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Hans Memling, ''Virgin and Child with Two Angels'', c. 1480. [[Uffizi]], Florence]]
The northern masters were greatly admired in Italy. According to Friedländer they exercised a strong influence over 15th-century Italian artists, a view Panofsky agrees with.&lt;ref&gt;Deam (1998), 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; However, Italian painters began to move beyond Netherlandish influences by the 1460s, as they concentrated on composition with a greater emphasis on harmony of parts belonging together – "that elegant harmony and grace&amp;nbsp;... which is called beauty", evident, for example, in [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[:File:Andrea Mantegna - The Dead Christ.jpg|Entombment]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 53&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 16th century, the reputation of the northern masters was such that there was an established north-south trade in their works, although many of the paintings or objects sent south were by lesser artists and of lower quality.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 35&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations introduced in the north and adopted in Italy included the setting of figures in domestic interiors and the viewing of interiors from multiple vantage points, through openings such as doors or windows.{{efn-ua|Described by Panofsky as "the interior viewed through a triple arcade".  See Panofsky (1969), 142}}&lt;ref&gt;Panofsky (1969), 142–3&lt;/ref&gt; Hugo van der Goes' ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'', in Florence's [[Uffizi]], played an important role in introducing Florentine painters to trends from the north, and artists like [[Giovanni Bellini]] came under the influence of northern painters working in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Memling successfully merged the two styles, exemplified in his ''Virgin and Child with Two Angels''. By the mid-16th-century, however, Netherlandish art was seen as crude; [[Michelangelo]] claimed it was appealing only to "monks and friars".&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 58&lt;/ref&gt; At this point northern art began to fall almost completely out of favour in Italy. By the 17th century, when Bruges had lost its prestige and position as the pre-eminent European trading city (the rivers silted and ports were forced to close), the Italians dominated European art.&lt;ref&gt;Christiansen (1998), 53–59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Destruction and dispersal==

===Iconoclasm===
[[File:Frans Hogenberg Bildersturm 1566.jpg|thumb|330px|Print of the destruction in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Church of Our Lady in Antwerp]], the "signature event" of the [[Beeldenstorm]], August 20, 1566, by [[Frans Hogenberg]]&lt;ref&gt;analysed in Arnade, 146 (quoted); see also [http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/155/index.html Art through time]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Religious images came under close scrutiny as actually or potentially [[idolatrous]] from the start of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the 1520s. [[Martin Luther]] accepted some imagery, but few Early Netherlandish paintings met his criteria. [[Andreas Karlstadt]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]] and [[John Calvin]] were wholly opposed to public religious images, above all in churches, and [[Calvinism]] soon became the dominant force in Netherlandish Protestantism. From 1520, outbursts of reformist [[iconoclasm]] broke out across much of Northern Europe.&lt;ref name="sn15"&gt;Nash (2008), 15&lt;/ref&gt; These might be official and peaceable, as in England under the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudors]] and the [[English Commonwealth]], or unofficial and often violent, as in the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]'' or "Iconoclastic Fury" in 1566 in the Netherlands.  On 19 August 1566, this wave of mob destruction reached Ghent, where [[Marcus van Vaernewijck]]  chronicled the events. He wrote of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'' being "taken to pieces and lifted, panel by panel, into the tower to preserve it from the rioters".&lt;ref&gt;Van Vaernewijck (1905–6), 132&lt;/ref&gt;  Antwerp saw very thorough destruction in its churches in 1566,&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, 133–148&lt;/ref&gt; followed by more losses in the Spanish [[Sack of Antwerp]] in 1576, and a further period of official iconoclasm in 1581, which now included city and guild buildings, when Calvinists controlled the city council.&lt;ref&gt;Freedberg, 133&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thousands of religious objects and artefacts were destroyed, including paintings, sculptures, altarpieces, stained glass, and crucifixes,&lt;ref name="sn14"&gt;Nash (2008), 14&lt;/ref&gt; and the survival rate of works by the major artists is low – even Jan van Eyck has only some 24 extant works confidently attributed to him. The number grows with later artists, but there are still anomalies; Petrus Christus is considered a major artist, but is given a smaller number of works than van Eyck. In general the later 15th-century works exported to southern Europe have a much higher survival rate.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the period's artworks were commissioned by clergy for their churches,&lt;ref name="Borchert 2011, 35"/&gt; with specifications for a physical format and pictorial content that would complement existing architectural and design schemes. An idea of how such church interiors might have looked can be seen from both van Eyck's ''Madonna in the Church'' and van der Weyden's ''[[commons:File:Rogier van der Weyden and workshop - Exhumation of St Hubert NG 783.jpg|Exhumation of St Hubert]]''.  According to Nash, van der Weyden's panel is an insightful look at the appearance of pre-Reformation churches, and the manner in which images were placed so that they resonated with other paintings or objects. Nash goes on to say that, "any one would necessarily be seen in relation to other images, repeating, enlarging, or diversifying the chosen themes". Because iconoclasts targeted churches and cathedrals, important information about the display of individual works has been lost, and with it, insights about the meaning of these artworks in their own time.&lt;ref name="sn14" /&gt; Many other works were lost to fires or in wars; the break-up of the Valois Burgundian state made the Low Countries the cockpit of European conflict until 1945. Van der Weyden's ''[[The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald]]'' polyptych is perhaps the most significant loss; from records it appears to have been comparable in scale and ambition to the ''Ghent Altarpiece''. It was destroyed by French artillery during the [[bombardment of Brussels]] in 1695, and is today known only from a tapestry copy.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 16–17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation===
There have been significant challenges for art historians in establishing the names of Netherlandish masters and attributing specific works. The historical record is very poor, such that some major artists' biographies are still bare outlines, while attribution is an ongoing and often contentious debate. Even the most widely accepted attributions are typically only as a result of decades of scientific and historical research originating from after the start of the 20th century.&lt;ref name = "n21"&gt;Nash (2008), 21&lt;/ref&gt; Some painters, such as [[Adriaen Isenbrandt]] and [[Ambrosius Benson]] of Bruges, who were mass-producing panels to be sold at fair stalls, have had as many as 500 painting attributed to them.&lt;ref name="A36"&gt;Ainsworth (1998a), 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The avenues for research have been limited by many historical factors. Many archives were destroyed in bombing campaigns in the two world wars, and a great number of works for which records do exist are themselves lost or destroyed.&lt;ref name = "n21"/&gt; The record-keeping in the region was inconsistent, and often the export of works by major artists was, owing to the pressures of commercial demand, not adequately recorded.&lt;ref name="n22"&gt;Nash (2008), 22&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of signing and dating works was rare until the 1420s,&lt;ref name="n123"&gt;Nash (2008), 123&lt;/ref&gt; and while the inventories of collectors may have elaborately described the works, they attached little importance to recording the artist or workshop that produced them.&lt;ref name="n44"&gt;Nash (2008), 44&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving documentation tends to come from inventories, wills, payment accounts, employment contracts and guild records and regulations.&lt;ref name="n39"&gt;Nash (2008), 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Jan van Eyck's life is well documented in comparison to his contemporary painters, and because he was so clearly the period's innovator, a great number of works were attributed to him after art historians began to research the period. Today Jan is credited with about 26–28 extant works. This reduced number in part follows from the identification of other mid-15th-century painters such as van der Weyden, Christus and Memling,&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis (1998), 8&lt;/ref&gt; while Hubert, so highly regarded by late-19th-century critics, is now relegated as a secondary figure with no works definitively attributed to him. Many early Netherlandish masters have not been identified, and are today known by "names of convenience", usually of the "Master of&amp;nbsp;..." format. The practice lacks an established descriptor in English, but the "notname" term is often used, a derivative of a German term.{{efn-ua|Typically pseudonyms are applied after common elements are established among a group of works. Art historians consider similarities of theme, style, iconography, biblical source and physical location before attributing work to an individual or workshop, then assign a generic name.}} Collecting a group of works under one notname is often contentious; a set of works assigned one notname could have been produced by various artists whose artistic similarities can be explained by shared geography, training, and response to market-demand influences.&lt;ref name="n22" /&gt; Some major artists who were known by pseudonyms are now identified, sometimes controversially, as in the case of Campin, who is usually, but not always, associated with the Master of Flémalle.&lt;ref name="Pächt9716"&gt;Pächt (1997), 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Many unidentified late-14th- and early-15th-century northern artists were of the first rank, but have suffered academic neglect because they have not been attached to any historical person; as Nash puts it, "much of what cannot be firmly attributed remains less studied".&lt;ref name="n22" /&gt; Some art historians believe that this situation has fostered a lack of caution in connecting works with historical persons, and that such connections often rest on tenuous circumstantial evidence. The identities of a number of well-known artists have been founded on the basis of a single signed, documented or otherwise attributed work, from which follow further attributions based on technical evidence and geographical proximity. The so-called [[Master of the Legend of the Magdalen]], who may have been [[Pieter van Coninxloo]], is one of the more notable examples;&lt;ref name="Campbell114"/&gt; others include Hugo van der Goes, Campin, Stefan Lochner and Simon Marmion.&lt;ref&gt;Nash (2008), 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

The lack of surviving theoretical writing on art and recorded opinion from any of the pre-16th-century major artists presents still more difficulties in attribution. Dürer, in 1512, was the first artist of the era to properly set down in writing his theories of art, followed by [[Lucas de Heere]] in 1565 and [[Karel van Mander]] in 1604. Nash believes a more probable explanation for the absence of theoretical writing on art outside Italy is that the northern artists did not yet have the language to describe their aesthetic values, or saw no point in explaining in writing what they had achieved in painting. Surviving 15th-century appreciations of contemporary Netherlandish art are exclusively written by Italians, the best known of which include [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli|Cyriacus Ancona]] in 1449, [[Bartolomeo Facio]] in 1456, and [[Giovanni Santi]] in 1482.&lt;ref name="sn24"&gt;Nash (2008), 24&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rediscovery==
The dominance of Northern [[Mannerism]] in the mid-16th century was built on a subversion of the conventions of Early Netherlandish art, which in turn fell out of public favour. Yet it remained popular in some royal art collections; [[Mary of Hungary (governor of the Netherlands)|Mary of Hungary]] and [[Philip II of Spain]] both sought out Netherlandish painters, sharing a preference for van der Weyden and Bosch. By the early 17th century, no collection of repute was complete without 15th- and 16th-century northern European works; the emphasis however tended to be on the Northern Renaissance as a whole, more towards the German Albrecht Dürer, by far the most collectable northern artist of the era. [[Giorgio Vasari]] in 1550 and Karel van Mander (c.&amp;nbsp;1604) placed the art works of era at the heart of Northern Renaissance art. Both writers were instrumental in forming later opinion about the region's painters, with emphasis on van Eyck as the innovator.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 411–12&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlandish painters were largely forgotten in the 18th century. When [[The Louvre|Musée du Louvre]] was converted to an art gallery during the [[French Revolution]], Gerard David's ''Marriage at Cana'' – then attributed to van Eyck – was the only piece of Netherlandish art on display there. More large panels were added to the collection after the French [[Campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars|conquered the Low Countries]].{{efn-ua|The central panels of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'', van Eyck's ''[[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele]]'', and Memling's ''Morel Triptych''}} These works had a profound effect on German literary critic and philosopher [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Karl Schlegel]], who after a visit in 1803 wrote an analysis of Netherlandish art, sending it to [[Ludwig Tieck]], who had the piece published in 1805.&lt;ref name="chapuis 4ff"&gt;Chapuis (1998), 4–7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The marriage at cana1 wga.jpg|thumb|320px|left|Gerard David, ''Marriage at Cana'', c.&amp;nbsp;1500. [[Musée du Louvre]], Paris. This work was first publicly displayed in 1802, attributed to van Eyck. Art historians in the 19th century were preoccupied with the difficulties of attribution.]]

In 1821 [[Johanna Schopenhauer]] became interested in the work of Jan van Eyck and his followers, having seen early Netherlandish and Flemish paintings in the collection of the brothers [[Sulpiz Boisserée|Sulpiz]] and [[Melchior Boisserée]] in Heidelberg.{{efn-ua|The Boisserée collection was acquired in 1827, on the advice of [[Johann Georg von Dillis]], to form part of the nucleus of the [[Alte Pinakothek]], Munich. See Ridderbos (2005), 86}} Schopenhauer did primary archival research because there was very little historical record of the masters, apart from official legal documents.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), viii&lt;/ref&gt; She published ''Johann van Eyck und seine Nachfolger'' in 1822, the same year [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen]] published the first modern scholarly work on early Netherlandish painting, ''Ueber Hubert van Eyck und Johann van Eyck'';&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 219–224&lt;/ref&gt; Waagen's work drew on Schlegel and Schopenhauer's earlier analyses. Waagen went on to become director of the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin|Gemäldegalerie]] in Berlin, amassing a collection of Netherlandish art, including most of the ''Ghent'' panels, a number of van der Weyden triptychs, and a Bouts altarpiece. Subjecting the works to meticulous analysis and examination in the course of acquisition, based on distinguishing characteristics of individual artists, he established an early scholarly system of classification.&lt;ref name="chapuis 4ff"/&gt;

In 1830 the [[Belgian Revolution]] split Belgium from the Netherlands of today; as the newly created state sought to establish a cultural identity, Memling's reputation came to equal that of van Eyck in the 19th century. Memling was seen as the older master's match technically, and as possessing a deeper emotional resonance.&lt;ref&gt;Smith (2004), 413–416&lt;/ref&gt;  When in 1848 the collection of Prince Ludwig of [[House of Oettingen-Wallerstein|Oettingen-Wallerstein]] at Schloss Wallerstein was forced onto the market, his cousin [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]] arranged a viewing at [[Kensington Palace]]; though a catalogue of works attributed to the School of Cologne, Jan van Eyck and van der Weyden was compiled by Waagen, there were no other buyers so Albert purchased them himself.&lt;ref&gt;Steegman, John (1950). ''Consort of Taste'', excerpted in Frank Herrmann, ''The English as Collectors'', 240; Queen Victoria donated the best of them to the National Gallery after the Prince Consort's death.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/collectors/prince-albert-and-the-gallery Prince Albert and the Gallery]". ''National Gallery'', London. Retrieved 12 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; At a period when London's [[National Gallery]] sought to increase its prestige,&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 203&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles Eastlake]] purchased Rogier van der Weyden's ''[[The Magdalen Reading]]'' panel in 1860 from Edmond Beaucousin's "small but choice" collection of early Netherlandish paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 13–14, 394&lt;/ref&gt;

Netherlandish art became popular with museum-goers in the late 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, van Eyck and Memling were the most highly regarded, with van der Weyden and Christus little more than footnotes. Later many of the works then attributed to Memling were found to be from van der Weyden or his workshop. In 1902, Bruges hosted the first [[Exposition des primitifs flamands à Bruges|exhibition of Netherlandish art]] with 35,000 visitors, an event that was a "turning point in the appreciation of early Netherlandish art".&lt;ref name="Ridderbos et al. (2005), 275"&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 5&lt;/ref&gt;  For a number of reasons, the chief of which was the difficulty of securing paintings for the exhibition, only a few of van Eyck's and van der Weyden's panels were displayed, while almost 40 of Memling's pieces were shown. Nevertheless, van Eyck and van der Weyden, to an extent, were then considered the first rank of Netherlandish artists.&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis (1998), 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bruges exhibition renewed interest in the period and initiated scholarship that was to flourish in the 20th century. [[Johan Huizinga]] was the first historian to place Netherlandish art squarely in the Burgundian period – outside of nationalistic borders – suggesting in his book ''[[The Waning of the Middle Ages]]'', published in 1919, that the flowering of the school in the early 15th century resulted wholly from the tastes set by the Burgundian court.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 284&lt;/ref&gt; Another exhibition visitor, Georges Hulin de Loo, published an independent critical catalogue highlighting the large number of mistakes in the official catalogue, which had used attributions and descriptions from the owners. He and Max Friedländer, who visited and wrote a review of the Bruges exhibition, went on to become leading scholars in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Ridderbos et al. (2005), 275&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarship and conservation==
[[File:Ghent altarpiece at Altaussee.jpg|thumb|left|The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' during recovery from the [[Altaussee]] salt mine at the end of World War II. The pioneering [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] work on these panels in the 1950s led to advances in methodology and technical application&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 13" /&gt;]]
The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian [[Max Jakob Friedländer]]'s pioneering ''Meisterwerke der Niederländischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts''. Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early [[Italian Renaissance painting|Italian renaissance]].&lt;ref name="s518"&gt;Silver (1986), 518&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gent-CatedralStBavon-Poliptic-vanEyck-1765sh.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.5|The ''Ghent Altarpiece'' during technical analysis in [[Saint Bavo's Cathedral]]]]
Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon [[Formalism (art)|formalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Holly (1985), 9&lt;/ref&gt; He built on Friedländer's attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography.&lt;ref name="r248" /&gt; Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.&lt;ref name="k177"&gt;Kren (2010), 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Otto Pächt and [[Friedrich Winkler]] continued and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience.&lt;ref name="k177" /&gt; The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system. It was not until the late 1950s, after the research of Friedländer, Panofsky and [[Meyer Schapiro]], that the attributions generally accepted today were established.&lt;ref name="Campbell114"&gt;Campbell (1998), 114&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|In the 1960s and 1970s [[Lotte Brand Philip]] and [[Elisabeth Dhanens]] built on Panofsky's work, and resolved many of the issues that Panofsky had struggled with, especially in relation to identifying the sources of iconography, and attributing works of the early to mid-15th century.}}

[[File:Hôtel-Dieu de Beaune 111.JPG|thumb|left|Van der Weyden's ''[[Beaune Altarpiece]]'' held under low light and with the panels split so that both sides can be displayed simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (2004), 74&lt;/ref&gt;]]
More recent research from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography to develop an understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters.&lt;ref name="Umass"/&gt; The conservation of the ''Ghent Altarpiece'' in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at the relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.&lt;ref name="Chapuis 1998, 13"/&gt;

Scholarship since the 1970s has tended to move away from a pure study of iconography, instead emphasizing the paintings' and artists' relation to the social history of their time.&lt;ref name="Umass"&gt;"[http://www.umass.edu/arthist/harbison.htm Craig Harbison] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605061635/http://www.umass.edu/arthist/harbison.htm |date=2013-06-05 }}". [[University of Massachusetts]]. Retrieved 15 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Craig Harbison]], "Social history was becoming increasingly important. Panofsky had never really talked about what kind of people these were."&lt;ref name="BuchholZ"&gt;Buchholz, Sarah R. "[http://www.umass.edu/chronicle/archives/00/04-14/harbison28.html A Picture Worth Many Thousand Words]". ''Chronicle'', University of Massachusetts, 14 April 2000. Retrieved 15 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Harbison sees the works as objects of devotion with a "prayer book mentality" available to middle-class burghers who had the means and the inclination to commission devotional objects. Most recent scholarship is moving away from the focus on religious iconography; instead, it investigates how a viewer is meant to experience a piece, as with donor paintings that were meant to elicit the feeling of a religious vision. James Marrow thinks the painters wanted to evoke specific responses, which are often hinted at by the figures' emotions in the paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Chapuis (1998), 12&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Egg decorating''' is the art or craft of decorating [[egg (food)|egg]]s. It is quite a popular art/craft form because of the attractive, smooth, oval shape of the egg. Any [[bird egg]] can be facilitated in this process, but most often the larger and stronger the eggshell is, the more favoured it will be by decorators.

== Varieties ==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2018}}
[[Goose]], [[duck]] and [[Chicken|hen]]s' eggs are usually "blown" – a hole is made in each end and the contents are blown out. The egg is then either carved, dyed, painted, appliqued or otherwise decorated (using a number of different techniques).  Egg decoration is particularly popular in Eastern European countries.

Some eggs, like [[emu]] or [[ostrich]] eggs, are so large and strong that the shells may be carved without breaking. Decorations on emu eggs take advantage of the contrast in colours between the dark green mottled outside of the shell and the shell-underlay. The oldest eggshells, decorated with engraved hatched patterns, are dated for 60 000 years ago and were found at [[Diepkloof Rock Shelter]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Texier"&gt;Texier PJ, Porraz G, Parkington J, Rigaud JP, Poggenpoel C, Miller C, Tribolo C, Cartwright C, Coudenneau A, Klein R, Steele T, Verna C. (2010). "A Howiesons Poort tradition of engraving ostrich eggshell containers dated to 60,000 years ago at Diepkloof Rock Shelter, South Africa". ''Proceedings of the National Acadademy of Science'' U S A. {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0913047107}}  {{PMID|20194764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern European cultures, and particularly Slavic ones, also have a strong tradition of [[Egg decorating in Slavic culture|decorating eggs]]. Chicken, duck and goose eggs are deocrated variously with batik dyeing, applique, scratch-work, wax encaustic and carving. The renowned [[Russia]]n court artist and jeweller [[Peter Carl Fabergé]] made exquisitely decorated [[precious metal]] and [[gemstone]] eggs for the Romanovs. These [[Fabergé egg]]s resembled standard decorated eggs, but they were made from [[gold]] and precious stones.

[[File:Punic ostrich egg from Villaricos (M.A.N. 1935-4-VILL-T.609-7) 01.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Carthage (state)|Punic]] decorated egg from [[Iron Age]] II]]

The [[Persian empire|Persian]] culture also has a tradition of egg decorating, which takes place during the spring [[equinox]].  This time marks the Persian New Year, and is referred to as [[Nowruz]].  Family members decorate eggs together and place them in a bowl. It is said that it is from this cultural tradition that the Christian practice originates.

In [[Egypt]], it is a tradition to decorate boiled eggs during [[Sham el-Nessim]], a spring-ushering national holiday celebrated by Egyptians regardless of religion, which falls every year after the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] [[Easter]].

Although some Orthodox Christian societies sometimes richly decorate their eggs at Easter, like the Ukrainian ones as shown, it is more normal to dye eggs red all over, using onion skins.

Many modern egg artists decorate their "art eggs" by etching or carving, while others paint or cover their eggs with different materials, from paper and fabric to [[polymer clay]] and are often painted in bright, spring colours. Using eggs as a canvas has become so popular that special terms have developed with the art form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.diyncrafts.com/4984/homemade/80-creative-fun-easter-egg-decorating-craft-ideas | title=80 Creative and Fun Easter Egg Decorating and Craft Ideas | publisher=DIY &amp; Crafts | accessdate=17 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egg artists also have their own guild, the International Egg Art Guild, which promotes the craft of egg artistry.

In the United States there are shows in many states where artists show their eggs and vendors of "egging" supplies can be found. Each year, the [[White House]] chooses a decorated egg from each state to display at [[easter]].

Another type of egg decoration is [[egg shoeing]], which requires goose eggs and miniature horse-shoes, made of iron or lead. The current world record of egg shoeing is 1119 shoes on a single ostrich egg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tojaspatkolo.hu/bem_e.html Home page of the world recorder, József Koszpek]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia, emu eggs are carved and the art created by them is known as [[kalti paarti carving]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/kalti-paarti-introduction|title=Kalti Paarti: Carved emu eggs|last=South|first=Barrina|date=11 March 2015|website=Australian Museum|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emotional labor''' is the process of managing feelings and expressions to fulfill the emotional requirements of a job.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book"&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell Hochschild |first=Arlie |author-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |title-link=The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling |title=The managed heart: commercialization of human feeling |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=1983 |isbn=978-0-520-05454-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grandey |first1= Alicia A. |year=2000 |title=Emotion regulation in the workplace: A new way to conceptualize emotional labor |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/1076-8998.5.1.95 |journal=Journal of Occupational Health Psychology |volume=5 |issue=1 |doi=10.1037/1076-8998.5.1.95 |pages=59–100 |pmid=10658889}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, workers are expected to regulate their emotions during interactions with customers, co-workers and superiors. This includes analysis and decision making in terms of the expression of emotion, whether actually felt or not, as well as its opposite: the suppression of emotions that are felt but not expressed.

Roles that have been identified as requiring emotional labor include but are not limited to Mother/Wife, those involved in [[public administration]] (especially the palace intrigues of a ruling body, these being an eternal literary theme), guarded professions of secrecy (such as espionage, national security, military intelligence, psychiatry, clerisy, and law), [[flight attendant]], [[Day care|daycare worker]], [[Nursing home care|nursing home worker]], [[Nursing|nurse]], [[Physician|doctor]], [[Cashier|store clerk]], [[Call centre|call center worker]], [[teacher]], [[librarian]], [[social worker]]; most roles in a [[hotel]], [[motel]], [[tavern]], [[bar]], [[pub]], and [[restaurant]]; and jobs in the media, such as television and radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Russell Hochschild |first=Arlie |author-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |contribution=Preface to the 2012 edition |editor-last=Russell Hochschild |editor-first=Arlie |editor-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |title-link=The Managed Heart: the Commercialization of Human Feeling |title=The managed heart: commercialization of human feeling |page=x |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-520-27294-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; As particular economies move from a [[manufacturing]]- to a [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service-based economy]], more workers in a variety of occupational fields are expected to manage their emotions according to employer demands when compared to sixty years ago.

==Definition: emotional labor versus emotion work==
[[File:Waitress2k7.jpg|thumb|A [[waitress]] at a restaurant is expected to do emotional labor, such as smiling and expressing positive emotion towards customers]]

The [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Arlie Russell Hochschild|Arlie Hochschild]] provides the first definition of emotional labor, which is a form of emotion regulation that creates a publicly visible facial and bodily display within the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt; The related term [[emotion work]] (also called "emotion management") refers to "these same acts done in a private context", such as within the private sphere of one's home or interactions with [[family]] and [[friendship|friends]]. Hochschild identified three emotion regulation strategies: [[cognitive]], bodily, and expressive.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Russell Hochschild |first=Arlie |author-link=Arlie Russell Hochschild |title=Emotion work, feeling rules, and social structure |journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]] |volume=85 |issue=3 |pages=551–575 |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |jstor=2778583 |date=November 1979 |ref=harv |doi=10.1086/227049}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/II.%20Emotions/1979%20Hochschild%20-%20Emotion%20Work.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Within cognitive emotion work, one attempts to change images, ideas, or thoughts in hopes of changing the feelings associated with them.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may associate a family picture with feeling happy and think about said picture whenever attempting to feel happy. Within bodily emotion work, one attempts to change physical symptoms in order to create a desired [[emotion]].&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may attempt deep breathing in order to reduce anger. Within expressive emotion work, one attempts to change expressive gestures to change inner feelings.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt; For example, one may attempt to smile when trying to feel happy. One becomes aware of emotion work most often when one's feelings do not fit the situation. For instance, when one does not feel sad at a funeral, one becomes acutely aware of the feelings appropriate for that situation.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Article" /&gt;

While emotion work happens within the private sphere, emotional labor is emotion management within the workplace according to employer expectations. According to Hochschild (1983), the emotion management by employers creates a situation in which this emotion management can be exchanged in the marketplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt; According to Hochschild (1983), [[Job (role)|jobs]] involving emotional labor are defined as those that:

# require face-to-face or voice-to-voice contact with the public.
# require the worker to produce an emotional state in another person.
# allow the employer, through training and supervision, to exercise a degree of control over the emotional activities of employees.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt;

Hochschild (1983) argues that within this [[commodification]] process, service workers are estranged from their own feelings in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Hochschild Book" /&gt;

==Determinants==
# Societal, occupational, and organizational [[Norm (sociology)|norms]]. For example, [[empirical]] evidence indicates that in typically "busy" stores there is more legitimacy to express negative emotions, than there is in typically "slow" stores, in which employees are expected to behave accordingly to the display rules;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rafaeli |first1=A. |last2=Sutton |first2=R.

# Supervisory regulation of display rules; That is, supervisors are likely to be important definers of display rules at the job level, given their direct influence on worker's beliefs about high-performance expectations. Moreover, supervisors' impressions of the need to suppress negative emotions on the job influence the employees' impressions of that display rule.&lt;ref name="Diefendorff"/&gt;

== Surface and deep acting ==
Original description of this emotion management process, researchers have focused on surface acting and deep acting as the primary strategies that employees use to regulate their emotions. Surface acting involves a "faking" process through which outward expressions are altered, yet internal feelings are left intact (2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= |title=The managed heart: The commercialization of feeling |last=Hochschild |first=A.R. |date=1983 |journal=University of California Press |doi= |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, deep acting is an effortful process through which employees change their internal feelings to align with organizational expectations, producing more natural and genuine emotional displays (Grandey et al., 2013)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional labor in the 21st century: Diverse Perspectives on Emotion Regulation at Work |last=Grandy |first=A. |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn= |location= |pages=3–17 |last2=Diefendorff |first2=J.M. |last3=Rupp |first3=D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (3). Although the underlying regulatory processes involved in each approach differ, the objective of both, is typically to show positive emotions, which are presumed to impact the feelings of customers and bottom-line outcomes (e.g., sales, positive recommendations, and repeat business; Pugh, 2001; Tsai, 2001).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pugh, S.

==Careers==
[[File:Altenpflegerin D1824.jpg|thumb|A [[nurse]] working in a hospital, is expected to express positive emotions towards patients, such as warmth and compassion.]]

In the past, emotional labor demands and display rules were viewed as a characteristic of particular [[wikt:occupation|occupations]], such as [[waiting staff|restaurant workers]], [[cashier]]s, [[hospital]] workers, bill collectors, [[Licensed Professional Counselor|counselors]], [[secretary|secretaries]], and nurses. However, display rules have been conceptualized not only as [[role]] requirements of particular occupational groups, but also as [[interpersonal]] job demands, which are shared by many kinds of occupations.&lt;ref name="Diefendorff"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Diefendorff |first1=J. M. |last2=Richard |first2=E. M. |year=2003 |title=Antecedents and consequences of emotional display rule perceptions |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.284 |journal=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=284–294 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.284 |pmid=12731712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bill collectors ===
In 1991, Sutton did an in-depth [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] study into bill collectors at a [[collection agency]].&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert I. |last=Sutton |year=1991 |title=Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors |journal=[[Administrative Science Quarterly]] |issue=2 |volume=36 |pages=245–268 |jstor=2393355 |doi=10.2307/2393355 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2393355}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that unlike the other jobs described here where employees need to act cheerful and concerned, bill collectors are selected and [[socialized]] to show irritation to most [[debtor]]s.  Specifically, the collection agency hired agents who seemed to be easily aroused. The newly hired agents were then trained on when and how to show varying emotions to different types of debtors.  As they worked at the collection agency, they were closely monitored by their supervisors to make sure that they frequently conveyed urgency to debtors.

Bill collectors' emotional labor consists of not letting angry and hostile debtors make them angry and to not feel guilty about pressuring friendly debtors for money.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt; They coped with angry debtors by publicly showing their anger or making jokes when they got off the phone.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt; They minimized the guilt they felt by staying emotionally detached from the debtors.&lt;ref name="sutton" /&gt;

=== Food-industry workers ===

====Wait staff====
[[File:Waitress taking an order.jpg|thumb|A waitress taking an order in an American restaurant]]

In her 1991 study of [[waitresses]] in [[Philadelphia]], Paules examines how these workers assert control and protect their [[self identity]] during interactions with [[customers]]. In [[restaurant]] work, Paules argues, workers' subordination to customers is reinforced through "[[cultural]] symbols that originate from deeply rooted assumptions about [[service sector|service work]]." Because the waitresses were not strictly regulated by their [[employers]], waitresses' interactions with customers were controlled by the waitresses themselves. Although they are stigmatized by the [[stereotypes]] and assumptions of servitude surrounding restaurant work, the waitresses studied were not negatively affected by their interactions with customers. To the contrary, they viewed their ability to manage their emotions as a valuable skill that could be used to gain control over customers. Thus, the Philadelphia waitresses took advantage of the lack of employer-regulated emotional labor in order to avoid the potentially negative consequences of emotional labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paules|first=G.F.|title=Dishing it out: power and resistance among waitresses in a New Jersey restaurant|year=1991|publisher=Temple University|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9780877228875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Paules highlights the positive consequences of emotional labor for a specific population of waitresses, other scholars have also found negative consequences of emotional labor within the waitressing industry. Through eighteen months of [[participant observation]] research, Bayard De Volo (2003) found that [[casino]] waitresses are highly monitored and monetarily bribed to perform emotional labor in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Casino Waitress"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bayard De Volo |first=L |title=Service and surveillance: infrapolitics at work among casino cocktail waitresses |journal=[[Social Politics|Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State &amp; Society]] |year=2003 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=346–376 |doi=10.1093/sp/jxg019 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/sp/jxg019 }} [https://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/social_politics/v010/10.3de_volo.html Article at Project MUSE.]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Bayard De Volo (2003) argues that through a sexualized environment and a generous [[Tip (gratuity)|tipping system]], both casino owners and customers control waitresses' [[behavior]] and [[Human physical appearance|appearance]] for their own benefit and pleasure. Even though the waitresses have their own forms of individual and collective resistance mechanisms, intense and consistent monitoring of their actions by casino management makes it difficult to change the power dynamics of the casino workplace.&lt;ref name="Casino Waitress" /&gt;

====Fast-food employees====
By using participant observation and [[interview]]s, Leidner (1993) examines how employers in fast food restaurants regulate workers' interactions with customers.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leidner|first=Robin|title=Fast food, fast talk: service work and the routinization of everyday life|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520085008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Leidner (1993), employers attempt to regulate workers' interactions with customers only under certain conditions. Specifically, when employers attempt to regulate worker-customer interactions, employers believe that "the quality of the interaction is important to the success of the enterprise", that workers are "unable or unwilling to conduct the interactions appropriately on their own", and that the "tasks themselves are not too complex or context-dependent."&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt; According to Leidner (1993), regulating employee interactions with customers involves standardizing workers' personal interactions with customers. At the [[McDonald's]] fast food restaurants in Leidner's (1993) study, these interactions are strictly scripted, and workers' compliance with the scripts and regulations are closely monitored.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt;

Along with examining employers' attempts to regulate employee-customer interactions, Leidner (1993) examines how fast-food workers' respond to these regulations.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt; According to Leidner (1993), meeting employers' expectations requires workers to engage in some form of emotional labor. For example, McDonald's workers are expected to greet customers with a [[smile]] and friendly attitude independent of their own [[mood (psychology)|mood]] or [[temperament]] at the time. Leidner (1993) suggests that rigid compliance with these expectations is at least potentially damaging to workers' sense of self and [[Identity (social science)|identity]]. However, Leidner (1993) did not see the negative consequences of emotional labor in the workers she studied. Instead, McDonald's workers attempted to individualize their responses to customers in small ways. Specifically, they used [[humor]] or [[exaggeration]] to demonstrate their rebellion against the strict regulation of their employee-customer interactions.&lt;ref name="Fast Food Book" /&gt;

===Physicians===
According to Larson and Yao (2005), [[empathy]] should characterize physicians' interactions with their patients because, despite advancement in medical [[technology]], the interpersonal relationship between [[physicians]] and [[patients]] remains essential to quality [[healthcare]].&lt;ref name=Physicians&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Larson |first1=E.B. |last2=Yao |first2=X. |title=Clinical empathy as emotional labor in the patient-physician relationship |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|The Journal of the American Medical Association]] |year=2005 |volume=293 |issue=9 |pages=1100–1106 |pmid=15741532 |doi=10.1001/jama.293.9.1100 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.293.9.1100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians consider empathy a form of emotional labor. Specifically, according to Larson and Yao (2005), physicians engage in emotional labor through deep acting by feeling sincere empathy before, during, and after interactions with patients. On the other hand, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians engage in surface acting when they fake empathic behaviors toward the patient. Although Larson and Yao (2005) argue that deep acting is preferred, physicians may rely on surface acting when sincere empathy for patients is impossible. Overall, Larson and Yao (2005) argue that physicians are more effective and enjoy more professional [[contentment|satisfaction]] when they engage in empathy through deep acting due to emotional labor.&lt;ref name=Physicians /&gt;

===Police work===
According to Martin (1999), [[police]] work involves substantial amounts of emotional labor by officers, who must control their own facial and bodily displays of emotion in the presence of other [[officers]] and [[citizens]].&lt;ref name="Police Officers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Martin |first=S.E. |title=Police force or police service? Gender and emotional labor |journal=[[American Academy of Political and Social Science#The Annals|The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science]] |year=1999 |volume=561 |issue=1 |jstor=1049285 |doi=10.1177/000271629956100108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although policing is often viewed as stereotypically [[masculine]] work that focuses on fighting [[crime]], policing also requires officers to maintain order and provide a variety of interpersonal services. For example, police must have a commanding presence that allows them to act decisively and maintain control in unpredictable situations while having the ability to actively listen and talk to citizens. According to Martin (1999), a police officer who displays too much [[anger]], [[sympathy]], or other emotion while dealing with danger on the job will be viewed by other officers as someone unable to withstand the pressures of police work, due to the [[sexist]] views of many police officers.&lt;ref name="Police Officers" /&gt; While being able to balance this self-management of emotions in front of other officers, police must also assertively restore order and use effective interpersonal skills to gain citizen [[trust (social sciences)|trust]] and [[Compliance (psychology)|compliance]]. Ultimately, the ability of police officers to effectively engage in emotional labor affects how other officers and citizens view them.&lt;ref name="Police Officers" /&gt;

===Public administration ===
Many scholars argue that the amount of emotional work required between all levels of government is greatest on the local level. It is at the level of cities and counties that the responsibility lies for day to day emergency preparedness, firefighters, law enforcement, public education, public health, and family and children's services. Citizens in a community expect the same level of satisfaction from their government, as they receive in a [[customer service]]-oriented job. This takes a considerate amount of work for both employees and employers in the field of public administration. There are two comparisons that represent emotional labor within public administration, "Rational Work versus Emotion Work", and "Emotional Labor versus Emotional Intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional Labor- Putting the Service in Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=6–7 |last2=Newman |first2=Meredith |last3=Mastracci |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performance====

When public administrators perform emotional labor, many scholars argue administrators are dealing with significantly more sensitive situations than employees in the service industry. The reason for this is because they are on the front lines of the government, and are expected to by citizens to serve them quickly and efficiently. When confronted by a citizen or a co-worker public administrators use emotional sensing to size up the emotional state of the citizen in need. Workers then take stock of their own emotional state in order to make sure that the emotion they are expressing is appropriate to their roles. Simultaneously, they have to determine how to act in order to elicit the desired response from the citizen as well as from co-workers. Public Administrators perform emotional labor through five different strategies: Psychological First Aid, Compartments and Closets, Crazy Calm, Humor, and Common Sense.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emotional Labor and Crisis Response, Working on a Razor's Edge|last=Mastracci|first=Sharron H.|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|year=2012|isbn=|location=Armonk, New York|pages=20–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition: rational work vs. emotion work ====
According to Mary Guy, Public administration does not only focus on the business side of administration but also on the personal side as well. It is not just about collecting the water bill or land ordinances to construct a new property, it is also about the quality of life and sense of community that is allotted to individuals by their city officials. Rational work is the ability to think cognitively and analytically, while emotional work means to think more practically and with more reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emotional Labor- Putting the Service in Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-7656-2117-7 |location=New York |pages=63 |last2=Newman |last3=Mastracci |first2=Meredith |first3=Sharon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Definition: vs. emotional intelligence ====
Knowing how to suppress and manage one's own feelings is known as [[emotional intelligence]], the ability to control one's emotions and to be able to do this at a high level guarantees one's own ability to serve those in need. Emotional intelligence is performed while performing emotional labor, and without one the other can not be there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Public Service |last=Guy |first=Mary |publisher=M.E.

Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) use the term "emotional proletariat" to describe [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service jobs]] in which "workers exercise emotional labor wherein they are required to display friendliness and [[deference]] to customers."&lt;ref name="Gender Book"&gt;{{citation |last1=Macdonald |first1=Cameron L. |last2=Sirianni |first2=Carmen |contribution=The service society and the changing experience of work |editor1-last=Macdonald |editor1-first=Cameron L. |editor2-last=Sirianni |editor2-first=Carmen |title=In working in the service society |year=1996 |pages=1–28 |publisher=Temple University Press |isbn=978-1-56639-480-2 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of deference, these occupations tend to be stereotyped as female jobs, independent of the actual number of women working the job. According to Macdonald and Sirianni (1996), because deference is a characteristic demanded of all those in [[disadvantaged]] structural positions, especially women, when deference is made a job requirement, women are likely to be overrepresented in these jobs. Macdonald and Sirianni (1996) claim that "[i]n no other area of wage labor are the personal characteristics of the workers so strongly associated with the nature of the work."&lt;ref name="Gender Book" /&gt; Thus, according to Macdonald and Sirianna (1996), although all workers employed within the service economy may have a difficult time maintaining their [[dignity]] and self-identity due to the demands of emotional labor, such an issue may be especially problematic for women workers.&lt;ref name="Gender Book" /&gt;

Emotional labor also affects women by perpetuating [[occupational segregation]] and the [[gender wage gap]].&lt;ref name="Gender Article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guy|first1=Mary Ellen|last2=Newman|first2=Meredith A.|date=|year=2004|title=Women's jobs, men's jobs: sex segregation and emotional labor|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00373.x|journal=[[Public Administration Review]]|volume=64|issue=3|pages=289–298|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2004.00373.x|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Job segregation, which is the systematic tendency for men and women to work in different occupations, is often cited as the reason why women lack equal pay when compared to men. According to Guy and Newman (2004), occupational segregation and ultimately the gender wage gap can at least be partially attributed to emotional labor. Specifically, work-related tasks that require emotional work thought to be natural for women, such as caring and [[empathy|empathizing]] are requirements of many female-dominated occupations. However, according to Guy and Newman (2004), these feminized work tasks are not a part of formal job descriptions and performance evaluations: "Excluded from job descriptions and performance evaluations, the work is invisible and uncompensated. Public service relies heavily on such skills, yet civil service systems, which are designed on the assumptions of a bygone era, fail to acknowledge and compensate emotional labor." According to Guy and Newman (2004), women working in positions that require emotion labour in addition to regular work are not compensated for this additional labour because of the sexist notion that the additional labour is to be expected of them by the fact of being a woman. This suggests that Guy and Newman believe a man conducting emotional labour would be compensated more than a woman would, however, if women are inproportionately hired for positions requiring emotional work, that does not immediately explain a wage gap comparable to men.

==Implications==

Positive affective display in service interactions, such as [[smiling]] and conveying friendliness, are positively associated with customer positive feelings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pugh |first1=S.D. |year=2001 |title=Service with a smile: emotional contagion in the service encounter |jstor=3069445 |journal=[[Academy of Management Journal]] |volume=44 |issue=5 |pages=1018–1027 |doi=10.2307/3069445}}&lt;/ref&gt; and important outcomes, such as intention to return, intention to recommend a store to others, and perception of overall service quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parasuraman |first1=A. |last2=Zeithaml |first2=V.A. |last3=Berry |first3=L.L. |date=Spring 1988 |title=SERVQUAL: a multiple-item scale for measuring customer perceptions of service quality |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00224359/70 |journal=Journal of Retailing |volume=64 |issue=1 |pages=12–40 }} [http://areas.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Marketing/FacultyStaff/zeithaml/Selected%20Publications/SERVQUAL-%20A%20Multiple-Item%20Scale%20for%20Measuring%20Consumer%20Perceptions%20of%20Service%20Quality.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304063550/http://areas.kenan-flagler.unc.edu/Marketing/FacultyStaff/zeithaml/Selected%20Publications/SERVQUAL-%20A%20Multiple-Item%20Scale%20for%20Measuring%20Consumer%20Perceptions%20of%20Service%20Quality.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that emotional labor may lead to employees' [[emotional exhaustion]] and [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]] over time, and may also reduce employees' [[job satisfaction]]. That is, higher degree of using emotion regulation on the job is related to higher levels of employees' emotional exhaustion,&lt;ref name="grandey_2005"/&gt; and lower levels of employees' job satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brotheridge |first1=C. M. |last2=Grandey |first2=A. A. |year=2002 |title=Emotional labor and burnout: Comparing two perspectives of people work |work=Journal of Vocational Behavior |volume=60|publisher=Aop.psy.unibe.ch |url=http://www.aop.psy.unibe.ch/lehre/proseminar_burnout/9_23.05.07%20Brotheridge%20Grandey%202002.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1006/jvbe.2001.1815 |pages=17–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is empirical evidence that higher levels of emotional labor demands are not uniformly rewarded with higher wages. Rather, the reward is dependent on the level of general cognitive demands required by the job. That is, occupations with high cognitive demands evidence wage returns with increasing emotional labor demands; whereas occupations low in cognitive demands evidence a wage "penalty" with increasing emotional labor demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Glomb |first1=T.M. |last2=Kammeyer-Mueller |first2=J. |last3=Rotundo |first3=M. |year=2004 |title=Emotional labor demands and compensating wage differentials |work=[[Journal of Applied Psychology]] |volume=89 |pages=700–714 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.89.4.700 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0021-9010.89.4.700 |pmid=15327355 }} [http://faculty.washington.edu/mdj3/MGMT580/Readings/Week%206/Glomb.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220022147/http://faculty.washington.edu/mdj3/MGMT580/Readings/Week%206/Glomb.pdf |date=2009-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping skills===
[[Coping (psychology)|Coping]] occurs in response to psychological stress—usually triggered by changes—in an effort to maintain mental health and emotional well-being. Life stressors are often described as negative events (loss of a job). However, positive changes in life (a new job) can also constitute life stressors, thus requiring the use of coping skills to adapt. Coping strategies are the behaviors, thoughts, and emotions that you use to adjust to the changes that occur in your life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semel.ucla.edu/dual-diagnosis-program/News_and_Resources/How_Do_You_Cope |title=How Do You Cope |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2015 |website=ucla.edu |publisher=UCLA |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of coping skills will help a person better themselves in the work place and perform to the best of their ability to achieve success. There are many ways to cope and adapt to changes. Some ways include: sharing emotions with peers, having a healthy social life outside of work, being humorous, and adjusting expectations of self and work. These coping skills will help turn negative emotion to positive and allow for more focus on the public in contrast to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diefendorff|first=J|last2=Gosserand|first2=R|date=2003|title=Understanding the emotional labor process: A control theory perspective|url=|journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior|volume=24|pages=945–959|doi=10.1002/job.230|pmid=}}&lt;!--|access-date=November 20, 2015 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Binge drinking]] is more common in men than it is in women.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} Among students in the USA, approximately 50 percent of men and 39 percent of women binge drink.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Racial differences exist among binge drinking with Hispanics followed by white people having the highest level of binge drinking. Individuals of African descent have a lower level of binge drinking followed by those of Asian descent. In the case of Asians their low level of binge drinking may be due to the presence of the [[aldehyde dehydrogenase]] gene (''[[ALDH2]]'', located on chromosome 12) in many (but by no means the vast majority) that results in poor metabolism of alcohol which leads to severe adverse effects such as facial flushing.&lt;ref name="Courtney-2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Courtney | first1 = KE. | last2 = Polich | first2 = J. | title = Binge drinking in young adults: Data, definitions, and determinants. | journal = Psychol Bull | volume = 135 | issue = 1 | pages = 142–56 |date=Jan 2009 | doi = 10.1037/a0014414 | pmid = 19210057 | pmc = 2748736 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men are more likely to binge drink (up to 81 percent of alcohol binges are done by men) than women and men are also more likely to develop [[alcohol dependence]] than women. People who are homozygous for the ''ALDH2'' gene are less likely to binge drink due to severe adverse effects which occur even with moderate amounts of alcohol consumption.

===Singapore===
According to the [http://www.moh.gov.sg/mohcorp/uploadedfiles/Publications/Reports/2005/NHS_2004(Part5).pdf National Health Survey 2004] conducted by the [http://www.hpb.gov.sg Health Promotion Board Singapore], binge drinking is defined as consumption of five or more alcoholic drinks over a short period of time.

The survey results showed that the frequency of binge drinking was 15.6% in males, 11.9% higher than that for females (3.7%). The largest proportion of males and females who binge drink fall within the 18 – 29 age group.

In 2007, [[Asia Pacific Breweries]] Singapore (APBS) spearheaded [[Get Your Sexy Back]] (GYSB), Singapore’s first youth-for-youth initiative to promote responsible and moderate drinking among young adults. The programme seeks to widen awareness and educate individuals about responsible drinking behaviour by raising the [[social currency]] of moderation. The programme engages youths in events and activities that are close to their lifestyles, focusing on four major platforms – Music, Fashion, Sports and Friends to spread the message of responsible drinking.

==Europe==
The drinking age in most countries is either 16 or 18, though in many countries national or regional regulations ban the consumption and/or the sale of alcoholic drinks stronger than beer or wine to those less than 18 years of age. Licensees may sometimes choose to provide beverages such as diluted [[wine]] or beer mixed with lemonade (''shandy'' or'' Lager Top'') with a meal to encourage responsible consumption of alcohol. It is generally perceived that binge drinking is most prevalent in the [[Vodka Belt]] (most of Northern and some of Eastern Europe) and least common in the southern part of the continent, in [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Portugal]] and the Mediterranean (the [[Alcohol belts of Europe#Wine belt|Wine Belt]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alcohol Alert Digest |date=1997 |publisher=Institute of Alcohol Studies UK |url=http://www.ias.org.uk/resources/publications/alcoholalert/alert199701/al199701_p20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a "5-drink, 30-days" (5 standard drinks in a row during the last 30 days) definition, [[Denmark]] leads European binge drinking, with 60% of 15–16-year-olds reporting participating in this behavior (and 61% reporting intoxication).&lt;ref name=CompareDrinkRate&gt;http://www.udetc.org/documents/CompareDrinkRate.pdf Youth Drinking Rates and Problems: A Comparison of European Countries and the United States (Sources: 2003 ESPAD Survey and 2003 United States Monitoring the Future Survey)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there currently appears to be at least some convergence of drinking patterns and styles between the northern and southern countries, with the south beginning to drink more like the north more so than the other way around.

===Malta===
A notable exception to the lower rates of binge drinking in [[Southern Europe]] is the Mediterranean island of [[Malta]], which has adopted the British culture of binge drinking, and where teenagers, often still in their early teens, are able to buy alcohol and drink it in the streets of the main [[nightclub|club]] district, [[Paceville]], due to a lack of police enforcement of the legal drinking age of 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=They’re closing the tap |newspaper=Malta Today |date=15 January 2006 |issue=323 |url=http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2006/01/15/t10.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116155708/http://www.maltatoday.com.mt/2006/01/15/t10.html |archivedate=2010-01-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics show that alcohol consumption in Malta exceeds that in the UK (but binge drinking is slightly lower and intoxication is significantly lower),&lt;ref name=CompareDrinkRate/&gt; and report that Malta ranks 5th in the world in common binge drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Piscopo, R.V. |author2=D’Emanuele, A.O. |title=Don’t Risk it — sedqa’s new binge-drinking campaign |newspaper=malta INDEPENDENT |date=22 June 2005 |url=http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2005-06-22/news/dont-risk-it-sedqas-new-binge-drinking-campaign-77082/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maltese 15–16-year-olds report binge drinking at a rate of 50%, using a 5-drink, 30-day definition, but only 20% report intoxication in the past 30 days.&lt;ref name=CompareDrinkRate/&gt;

===Spain===
Since the mid-1990s the [[botellón]] has been growing in popularity among young people. Botellón, which literally means "big bottle" in Spanish, is a drinking party or gathering that involves consuming alcohol, usually spirits (often mixed with soft drinks), in a public or semi-public place (beaches, parks, streets, etc.).  This can be considered a case of binge drinking since most people that attend it consume three to five drinks in less than five hours.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Among 15–16-year-olds, 23% report being intoxicated in the past 30 days.&lt;ref name=CompareDrinkRate/&gt;

===Russia===
{{Further|Alcoholism in Russia}}
&lt;!-- [[zapoy]] redirects here--&gt;
Binge drinking in Russia ("''Zapoy''" ("''Запой''") in [[Russian language|Russian]]), often takes the form of two or more days of continuous drunkenness. Sometimes it can even last up to a week.  One study found that among men ages 25–54, about 10% had at least one episode of ''zapoy'' in the past year, which can be taken as a sign that one has a drinking problem.&lt;ref name=Tomkins07&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Tomkins S, Saburova L, Kiryanov N, etal |title=Prevalence and socio-economic distribution of hazardous patterns of alcohol drinking: study of alcohol consumption in men aged 25–54 years in Izhevsk, Russia |journal=Addiction |volume=102 |issue=4 |pages=544–53 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17362291 |pmc=1890567 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01693.x |url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01693.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, parallels have been drawn between binge drinking and the [[Gin Crisis]] of 18th century England.&lt;ref name="historyandpolicy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-62.html|title=Binge drinking and moral panics: historical parallels??|last=Borsay|first=Peter|date=September 2007|work=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=[[United Kingdom]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some areas of the media are spending a great deal of time reporting on what they see as a social ill that is becoming more prevalent as time passes. In 2003, the cost of binge drinking was estimated as £20 billion a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Binge drinking costing billions |date=19 September 2003 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3121440.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[Her Majesty's Government|government]] has introduced measures to deter disorderly behavior and sales of alcohol to people under 18, with special provisions in place during the holiday season. In January 2005, it was reported that one million admissions to UK [[emergency department]] units each year are alcohol-related; in many cities, Friday and Saturday nights are by far the busiest periods for [[ambulance]] services.

The culture of drinking in the UK is markedly different from that of some other European nations. In mainland Europe, alcohol tends to be consumed more slowly over the course of an evening, often accompanied by a restaurant meal. In Scandinavia, occasional bouts of heavy drinking are the norm. In the UK (as well as [[Ireland]]), by contrast, alcohol is commonly consumed in rapid binges, leading to more regular instances of severe intoxication. In this way the British combine Northern European volumes of consumption with frequency resembling that of Southern Europe. This "drinking urgency" may have been inspired by traditional pre-midnight [[public house|pub]] [[Last call (bar term)|closing hours]] in the UK, whereas bars in continental Europe would typically remain open for the entire night. This may have stemmed from the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]], emergency legislation dating back to the [[World War I|first world war]] regulating pub opening times with the intention of getting workers out of the pub and into the [[munitions]] factories. Consequently, it was criticised for being draconian and denying the working classes their pleasures. This is one of the reasons for introducing the [[Licensing Act 2003]] which came into effect in [[England and Wales]] in 2005, and which allows 24 hour licensing (although not all bars have taken advantage of the change). Some observers, however, believed it would exacerbate the problem.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1535010/24-hour-laws-haven't-cured-binge-drinking.html 24-hour laws haven't cured binge drinking] telegraph.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

While being drunk (outside of a [[student]] context) in mainland Europe is widely viewed as being socially unacceptable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/15868581 | work=The Economist | title=Rolling away the barrel | date=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the UK the reverse is true in many social circles. Particularly amongst young adults, there is often a certain degree of [[peer pressure]] to get drunk during a night out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/responsibledrinking/teenagers | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=What teenagers think about binge drinking | first=Poppy | last=Robertson | date=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This culture is increasingly becoming viewed by politicians and the media as a serious problem that ought to be tackled, partly due to health reasons, but mostly due to its association with [[violence]] and [[anti-social behaviour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mack|first=Jon|year=2009|title=The Last Chance Saloon: The Drinking Banning Order|journal=[[Justice of the Peace Magazine|Criminal Law &amp; Justice Weekly]]|volume=173|issue=51/52|pages=805–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a 5-drink, 30-days definition, British 15–16-year-olds binge drink at a rate of 54%, the fourth highest in Europe, and 46% report intoxication in the past 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=232713|title=Youth Drinking Rates and Problems: A Comparison of European Countries and the United States|last=|first=|date=2005|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921013713/http://www.udetc.org/documents/YouthDrinkingRatesandProblems.pdf|archive-date=2015-09-21|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British [[Television|TV]] channel [[Granada (production company)|Granada]] produces a program called [[Booze Britain]], which documents the binge drinking culture by following groups of young adults.

As a reaction to the binge drinking epidemic in Britain, several charities have been created to raise awareness of the dangers of binge drinking and promote responsible drinking. These charities notably include [[Alcohol Concern]] and Drinkaware.

===Canada===
Canadian binge drinking rates are comparable to the United States, and resemble most the geographically similar states that border on it. For example, 29% of 15- to 19-year-olds (35% male, 22% female) and 37% of 20- to 24-year-olds (47% male, 17.9% female) report having 5 or more drinks on one occasion, 12 or more times a year in 2000–01.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faslink.org/Frequency_of_drinking.htm |title=Frequency of Drinking |publisher=Faslink.org |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101029103356/http://faslink.org/Frequency_of_drinking.htm |archivedate=2010-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In university, binge drinking is especially common during the first week of orientation, commonly known as "frosh week." The first ever known study comparing the drinking patterns of Canadian and American college students under age 25 (in 1998 and 1999, respectively) found that although Canadian students were more likely to drink, American students drank more heavily overall.&lt;ref name="First National Comparison"&gt;http://alcoholism.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?site=http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cas/Documents/Canadian1%2DpressRelease/ First National Comparison&lt;/ref&gt;

"Heavy alcohol use" was defined as ''usually'' having 5/4 drinks or more on the days that the person drinks in the past 30 days (American) or 2–3 months (Canadian).  Among past year drinkers, 41% and 35% of American and Canadian students, respectively, reported participated in this behavior.  Among the total sample, it was 33% and 30%, respectively. Differences included the lack of a gender gap in Canada compared with America, as well some as age-related differences. Canadians exceeded Americans in reported heavy alcohol use until age 19 (especially among the 1% percentage of students under 18), at which point Americans overtook and then began to exceed Canadians, especially among 21- and 22-year-olds. After age 23, there was no longer much of a difference.&lt;ref name="First National Comparison" /&gt; In Canada, the legal drinking age is 18 or 19, depending on the province.

A relatively popular drinking game among the Canadian skateboarders and heavy metal culture is "wizard sticks", in which drinkers tape a stack of their empty beer cans to the can from which they are currently drinking.  The name comes from the fact that when the stack gets tall enough, it resembles a wizard's staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jointogether.org/news/headlines/inthenews/2008/wizard-stick-parties-a.html |title='Wizard Stick' Parties a Binge Drinking concern |publisher=Jointogether.org |accessdate=2010-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225232333/http://www.jointogether.org/news/headlines/inthenews/2008/wizard-stick-parties-a.html |archivedate=2008-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having a [[legal drinking age]] of 21, binge drinking in the United States remains very prevalent among high school and college students. Using the popular 5/4 definition of "binge drinking", one study found that, in 1999, 44% of American college students (51% male, 40% female) engaged in this practice at least once in the past two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |vauthors=Wechsler H, etal |title=College Binge Drinking in the 1990s: A Continuing Problem.

One can also look at the prevalence of "extreme drinking" as well.  A more recent study of US first-semester college freshmen in 2003 found that, while 41% of males and 34% of females "binged" (using the 5/4 threshold) at least once in the past two weeks, 20% of males and 8% of females drank 10/8 or more drinks (double the 5/4 threshold) at least once in the same period, and 8% of males and 2% of females drank at least 15/12 drinks (triple the threshold).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=White AM, Kraus CL, Swartzwelder H |title=Many college freshmen drink at levels far beyond the binge threshold |journal=Alcohol.

A main concern of binge drinking on college campuses is how the negative consequences of binge drinking affect the students. A study done by the Harvard School of Public Health reported that students who engage in binge drinking experience numerous problems such as: missing class, engaging in unplanned or unsafe sexual activity, being victims of sexual assault, unintentional injuries, and physical ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tewksbury R, Higgins GE, Mustaine EE |title=Binge Drinking Among College Athletes and Non-Athletes |journal=Deviant Behavior |volume=29 |issue=4 |pages=275–293 |year=2008 |doi=10.1080/01639620701588040 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01639620701588040}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the U.S Surgeon General estimated that around 5,000 Americans aged under 21 die each year from alcohol-related injuries involving underage drinking.&lt;ref&gt;Tomorrow's World - July/August 2008 - "Armageddon And Beyond" - Page 27&lt;/ref&gt; Rates of binge drinking in women have been increased; high risk drinking puts these women at  increased risk of the negative [[long-term effects of alcohol]].&lt;ref name="Kelly-Weeder-2008"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kelly-Weeder | first1 = S. | title = Binge drinking in college-aged women: framing a gender-specific prevention strategy. | journal = J Am Acad Nurse Pract | volume = 20 | issue = 12 | pages = 577–84 |date=December 2008 | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-7599.2008.00357.x | pmid = 19120588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of people who binge drink mainly comprises young adults aged 18–29, although it is by no means rare among older adults.  For example, in 2007 (using a 5-drinks definition per occasion for both genders), 42% of 18- to 25-year-olds "binged" at least once a month, while 20% of 16–17-year-olds and 19% of those over age 35 did so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kennet, Joel |chapter=3.

The annual Monitoring the Future survey found that, in 2007, 10% of 8th graders, 22% of 10th graders, and 26% of 12th graders report having had five or more drinks at least once in the past two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitoringthefuture.org/pubs/monographs/overview2007.pdf |title=Overview of Key Findings 2007 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same survey also found that alcohol was considered somewhat ''easier'' to obtain than cigarettes for 8th and 10th graders, even though the minimum age to purchase alcohol is 21 in all 50 states, while for cigarettes it is 18.

===American Indians and First Nations===
{{Further|American Indian alcoholism}}

Binge drinking is a common pattern among [[American Indian alcoholism|Native Americans]] in both Canada and the United States. Anastasia M. Shkilnyk who conducted an observational study of the [[Asubpeeschoseewagong First Nation]] of Northwestern Ontario in the late 1970s when they were demoralized by [[Ontario Minamata disease]] has observed that heavy Native American drinkers may not be physiologically dependent on alcohol, but abuse it by engaging in binge drinking, a practice associated with child neglect, violence, and impoverishment. After binges during which entire families and their friends drink until they are unconscious and their funds are exhausted, they go about their business without drinking.&lt;ref name=PSL&gt;{{cite book|title=A Poison Stronger than Love: The Destruction of an Ojibwa Community|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300033257|author=Anestasia M.

===Australia===
In 2004–2005, statistics from the National Health Survey&lt;ref name=ABS2004&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/allprimarymainfeatures/9C513A3DB275E740CA257A0100135A89?opendocument |title=Alcohol Consumption'&amp;#39; in Australia: A Snapshot, 2004–05 |publisher=Australian Bureau of Statistics |date=25 August 2006 |id=4832.0.55.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that among the general population over 18; 88% of males and 60% of females engaged in binge drinking at least once in the past year, with 12% and 4%, respectively, doing so at least once a week. Among 18- to 24-year-olds, 49% of males and 21% of females did so at least once a week. At the time, the definition for "binge drinking" corresponded to 7 or more standard Australian drinks per occasion for males and 5 or more for females, roughly equivalent to (but slightly less than) the 5/4 (standard American) drinks definition.&lt;ref name=ABS2004/&gt;

In March 2008, the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] earmarked [[Australian dollar|A$]]53 million towards a campaign against binge drinking, citing two studies done in the past eight years which showed that binge drinking in Australia was at what [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[Kevin Rudd]] called "epidemic levels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rudd sets aside $53-million to tackle binge drinking |date=10 March 2008 |work=PM |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2008/s2185516.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 15, the [[Australian Medical Association]] released new guidelines defining binge drinking as four standard Australian drinks a night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Binge drinking on people's minds: AMA |date=15 June 2008 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/06/15/2275181.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last survey of drinking habits by the Australian Bureau of Statistics found there was an increase in drinking outside the home. In 1999, 34 percent of spending on alcoholic drinks took place on licensed premises. By 2004 this figure had risen to 38 percent. This figure is expected to fall in 2008 in Australia because of stricter licensing laws, smoking bans in pubs and the extra premium people have to pay for buying alcohol in a bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Lee J |title=Back to the bottle shop as drinkers stay at home |date=24 April 2008 |newspaper=[[The Age]] |url=http://business.theage.com.au/back-to-the-bottle-shop-as-drinkers-stay-at-home/20080423-285p.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
Concerns over binge drinking by teenagers has led to a review of liquor advertising being announced by the New Zealand government in January 2006. The review considered regulation of sport sponsorship by liquor companies, which at present is commonplace. Previously the drinking age in New Zealand was 20, then dropped to 18 in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Minimum Drinking and Purchasing Age Laws |date=February 2007 |publisher=International Center for Alcohol Policies |url=http://www.icap.org/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=DZtSxPV1Vxw%3D&amp;tabid=206 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In direct conjunction with the age-lowering, the Police were found to strictly enforce the on-license (bar, restaurant) code for underage-drinking, less so for the off-licences (liquor stores, supermarkets).  As a result, young people ages 15–17 found it significantly ''harder'' to get into (or be served at) bars and restaurants than it was before with a poorly enforced (though higher) drinking age of 20. This asymmetric enforcement led to a period of many of New Zealand's youth getting strangers to purchase high alcohol content beverages for them (e.g. cheap vodka or rum) at liquor stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Palmer A |title=Binge drinking: Does Britain need to look to Italy to solve booze problem?? |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=18 August 2009 |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/08/18/binge-drinking-does-britain-need-to-look-to-italy-to-solve-booze-problem-115875-21604245/ |accessdate=2009-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A propensity to consume an entire bottle of spirits developed and led to an instant increase in the amount of youths under 18 being admitted to [[Emergency department|A&amp;E]] hospitals.

An example of this binge drinking mentality, often seen amongst university students, is the popularity of [[drinking games]] such as Edward Wineyhands and Scrumpy Hands, similar to the American drinking game [[Edward Fortyhands]].

'''Gadaw''' ({{lang-my|ကန်တော့}}, {{IPA-my|ɡədɔ̰|IPA}}; also spelt '''kadaw''') is a [[Burmese language|Burmese verb]] referring to a [[Burma|Burmese]] tradition in which a person, always of lower social standing, pays respect or [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] to a person of higher standing (including Buddhist monks, elders, teachers and Buddha), by kneeling before them and paying obeisance with joined hands, and [[bowing]]. This is usually done by students to their [[teacher]]s or children or grandchildren to their elders (parents, aunts, uncles and grandparents), in order to show gratitude and reverence and an opportunity to ask for forgiveness, often involving gift-giving.

It is traditionally done on New Year's Day of [[Thingyan]] and during the month of [[Traditional Burmese calendar|Thadingyut]] (roughly October), which marks the end of [[Vassa]], the Buddhist lent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no288/MyanmarTimes15-288/t004.htm |title=Paper lanterns and coloured lights: Thadingyut celebrations are again upon us |last=Moe Moe Oo |author2=Moh Moh Thaw |date=17 October 2005 |work=Myanmar Times |accessdate=31 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708234820/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/myanmartimes/no288/MyanmarTimes15-288/t004.htm |archivedate=July 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp1997/11-97/eld11-97.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition is widely believed to have Buddhist roots, as teachers and parents ({{my|မိဘ၊ ဆရာသမား}}) are honored as part of the Five Infinite Venerables ({{my|အနန္တငါးပါး}}), along with the [[Three Jewels]], namely the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/no492/n019.htm |title=Thadingyut, a time to honour teachers |last=Cherry Thein |date=12 October 2009 |work=Myanmar Times |accessdate=31 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326033029/http://www.mmtimes.com/no492/n019.htm |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Mangala Sutta]], the source of the 38 Buddhist Beatitudes, describes the importance of "honoring those worthy of honor" ({{my|ပူဇာ စ ပူဇနေယျနာနံ၊}}, {{IAST|pujā ca pujāneyyanānam}}) and lists respect, humbleness, gratitude and as among the highest blessings. Obeisance ceremonies are also held for neighborhood elders, and professional mentors, such as writers and actors.&lt;ref name="thanegi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymagicalmyanmar.com/MMM%201-2.pdf|title=Customs, Ceremonies and Festivals|last=Ma Thanegi|date=February 2014|work=My Magical Myanmar|accessdate=19 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115417/http://www.mymagicalmyanmar.com/MMM%201-2.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective ''gadaw'' of teachers is called a ''hsaya gadaw pwe'' ({{my|ဆရာကန်တော့ပွဲ}}) or more formally ''acariya puja pwe'' or ''asariya puzaw pwe'' ({{my|အာစရိယပူဇော်ပွဲ}}), usually done formally during the month of Thadingyut (or [[World Teachers' Day]] on 5 October) by students or alumni at schools and universities throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Article/Article2004/Oct04/Oct05.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time of the Burmese monarchy, a ritualized ''gadaw'' ceremony called the ''gadaw pwedaw'' ({{my|ကန်တော့ပွဲတော်}}) was practised at least three times a year at the royal palace, by tributary chieftains and rulers as well as subjects to the king, as a symbolic form of [[allegiance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of oriental history |editor=Cyril Henry Philips |year=1951 |publisher=University of London School of Oriental and African Studies |location= |volume=6 |pages=121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gadaw nay'' ({{my|ကန်တော့နေ့}}) was one such time, occurring at the end of the Buddhist lent, and when tributes and gifts are formally offered to the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Burman, His Life and Notions |last=Scott |first=James George |authorlink=James George Scott |year=1882 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-1-115-23195-4 |pages=102 |url=http://www.burmalibrary.org/docs09/burmanhislife&amp;notions-scott-2.pdf |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Burmese request of the Three Jewels (Triple Gem), a formulaic prayer (termed [[Okāsa]] or the "Buddhist common prayer" by [[Pe Maung Tin]]) that precedes most Buddhist ceremonies, explicitly references the ''gadaw'' of the Five Infinite Venerables (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, parents and teachers):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Buddhism and society: a great tradition and its Burmese vicissitudes |last=Spiro |first=Melford |year=1982 |publisher=University of California Press |page=210 |isbn=0-520-04672-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15419">Since the early years of [[genetic research]], the [[Sami people]] have caught the interests of scientists.  The [[Sami languages]] belong to the [[Uralic languages]] family of Eurasia.  Some earlier anthropologists have suggested they might be of Asian  and/or Siberian origin. The frequency of blood group and protein polymorphisms in Sami differs significantly from the general Northern European population.&lt;ref name="Beckman2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=L.E. Beckman |author2=K. Sjoberg |author3=S. Eriksson |author4=L. Beckman |year=2001 |title=Haemochromatosis gene mutations in Finns, Swedes and Swedish Saamis |journal=Human Heredity |volume=52 |pages= 110–112 |pmid=11474212 |issue=2 |doi=10.1159/000053362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more recent years the use of [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|mitochondrial DNA]] (mtDNA) and Y-DNA chromosomal markers has offered the opportunity for clarification of the origin of the Sami. While their mtDNA haplogroup distribution overwhelmingly represents a subset of the European gene-pool, the most common Y-DNA haplogroup among the Sami is widely believed to be of Eurasian origin and very common among all peoples in northeastern Europe, which is [[Haplogroup N-M231]] and its subclades. Some research shows that the second most common haplogroup is [[Haplogroup I-M170]], which is found almost exclusively among those of European ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.cell.com/ajhg/abstract/S0002-9297(07)61892-8 | doi=10.1086/383203| pmid=15024688| pmc=1181943| title=The Western and Eastern Roots of the Saami—the Story of Genetic "Outliers" Told by Mitochondrial DNA and y Chromosomes| journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics| volume=74| issue=4| pages=661–682| year=2004| last1=Tambets| first1=Kristiina| last2=Rootsi| first2=Siiri| last3=Kivisild| first3=Toomas| last4=Help| first4=Hela| last5=Serk| first5=Piia| last6=Loogväli| first6=Eva-Liis| last7=Tolk| first7=Helle-Viivi| last8=Reidla| first8=Maere| last9=Metspalu| first9=Ene| last10=Pliss| first10=Liana| last11=Balanovsky| first11=Oleg| last12=Pshenichnov| first12=Andrey| last13=Balanovska| first13=Elena| last14=Gubina| first14=Marina| last15=Zhadanov| first15=Sergey| last16=Osipova| first16=Ludmila| last17=Damba| first17=Larisa| last18=Voevoda| first18=Mikhail| last19=Kutuev| first19=Ildus| last20=Bermisheva| first20=Marina| last21=Khusnutdinova| first21=Elza| last22=Gusar| first22=Vladislava| last23=Grechanina| first23=Elena| last24=Parik| first24=Jüri| last25=Pennarun| first25=Erwan| last26=Richard| first26=Christelle| last27=Chaventre| first27=Andre| last28=Moisan| first28=Jean-Paul| last29=Barać| first29=Lovorka| last30=Peričić| first30=Marijana| displayauthors=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haplogroup I in Sami, at least 38 Sami in Sweden, is dated to the 14th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201651|pmid = 16724001| title=Y-chromosome diversity in Sweden – A long-time perspective| journal=European Journal of Human Genetics| volume=14| issue=8| pages=963–970| year=2006| last1=Karlsson| first1=Andreas O.| last2=Wallerström| first2=Thomas| last3=Götherström| first3=Anders| last4=Holmlund| first4=Gunilla}}&lt;/ref&gt; so quite late in Sami (genetic) history. In the study were only those 38 Sami tested. The problem with that study is that it does not reveal all the different haplogroups in each of the individuals. Instead it seems that if a person tested for haplogroup I as dominant, that person has been labelled as solely belonging to that haplogroup, not accounting for any other haplogroup in that individual.

Nevertheless, the Sami appear to have a complex population history, suggesting a mixture of peoples arriving in Fenno-Scandia at different times, from different directions. Strangely, this small admixture of peoples has also remained homogeneous within the Saami for several millenniums thereafter. This in-turn suggests that Sami has not intermarried or mixed much with other surrounding ethnic groups.

Other research on Sami shows that most of them have no belonging to the (somewhat) mysterious [[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)|mtDNA Haplogroup I]].&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ingman |first1=Max |last2=Gyllensten |first2=Ulf |title=A recent genetic link between Sami and the Volga-Ural region of Russia |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |date=20 September 2006 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=115–120 |doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201712 |pmid=16985502 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/5201712 |language=En |issn=1018-4813}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Not to be confused for the aforementioned paternal Haplogroup I-M170.) This is uncanny; because it is unlike the [[Finns]] and Sami's other companions that share [[Uralic peoples|Uralic heredity]]. This could suggest that Haplogroup I (along with [[Haplogroup W (mtDNA)|Haplogroup W]]) are perhaps mitochondrial fraternals; and may have only spread conservatively through Northern Europe and the Uralic peoples via contact with Indo-Europeans; during the late Neolithic. If Sami had carried Haplogroup I in relatively ancient Sami populations; this would imply that any acquired Indo-European maternal admixture within the Sami were relatively small. And their Indo-European lineages; unlike Haplogroup W, could have easily become rarer or extinct over time. (Both Haplogroup I and Haplogroup W are descendants of the Eurasian [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|Macrogroup N]], and are usually found and observed in Europe at trace frequencies in similar spots almost like counterparts - perhaps in areas where Indo-Europeans had settled.) Even the non-Indo-European [[Basques]] carry haplogroup I and W in small frequencies, hand-in-hand—But not in the Sami. Even stranger, is that the few Sami who have intermixed with other [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian peoples]] (Norwegians, Finns or Swedes, for instance) still seem to lack a significant proportion of mitochondrial I.

==mtDNA Haplogroups==
Classification of the Sami mtDNA lineages revealed that the majority are clustered in a subset of the European mtDNA pool. The two haplogroups  V and U5b dominate, between them accounting for about 89% of the total. This gives the Sami regions the highest level of Haplogroups V and U5b thus far found. Both haplogroups V and U5b are spread at moderate frequencies across Europe, from Iberia to the Ural Mountains. Haplogroups H, D5 and Z represent most of the remaining averaged total. Overall 98% of the Sami mtDNA pool is encompassed within haplogroups V, U5b, H, Z, and D5. Local frequencies among the Sami vary.&lt;ref name="Tambets2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kristiina Tambets |author2=Siiri Rootsi |author3=Toomas Kivisild |author4=Hela Help |author5=Piia Serk |year=2004|title=The Western and Eastern Roots of the Saami—the Story of Genetic "Outliers" Told by Mitochondrial DNA and Y Chromosomes |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=74 |pages= 661–682 |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v74n4/40783/40783.web.pdf|pmc=1181943|doi=10.1086/383203 |pmid=15024688|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The divergence time for the Sami haplogroup V sequences was estimated by Max Ingman and Ulf Gyllensten at 7600 YBP (years before present), and for U5b1b1 as 5500 YBP amongst Sami and 6600 YBP amongst Sami and Finns. This suggests to them an arrival in the
region soon after the retreat of the glacial ice.&lt;ref name="Ingman2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Max Ingman |author2=Ulf Gyllensten |year=2007|title= A recent genetic link between Sami and the Volga-Ural region of Russia |journal=European Journal of Human Genetics |volume=15 |pages= 115–120 |url=http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v15/n1/pdf/5201712a.pdf |issue=1|doi=10.1038/sj.ejhg.5201712 |pmid=16985502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U5b===
Although a small proportion of the [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)]] among the Sami falls into U4, the great majority is U5b.  The percentage of total Sami mtDNA samples tested by K. Tambets and her colleagues (published in 2004) which were U5b ranged from 56.8% in Norwegian Sami to 26.5% in Swedish Sami.&lt;ref name="Tambets2004"/&gt; In research made by M. Ingman and U. Gyllensten in 2006 shows a slightly different setting: Norwegian Sami belongs to U5b as well as U5b1b1 to 56.8%, Finnish Sami with 40.6%, Northern Sami in Sweden to 35.5% and Southern Sami in Sweden within reindeer herding to 23.9% while Southern Sami in Sweden outside of reindeer herding/other occupation belong to U5b to 16.3% and to U5b1b1 to 12%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/ejhg/journal/v15/n1/fig_tab/5201712t1.html#figure-title&lt;/ref&gt; Sami U5b falls into [[subclade]] U5b1b1. The Sami U5b1b1 &lt;ref name="Tambets2004"/&gt; sub-clade is present in many different populations, e.g. 3% or higher frequencies in Karelia, Finland, and Northern-Russia.&lt;ref name="Tambets2004"/&gt; The Sami U5b1 motif is additionally found in very low frequencies for instance in the Caucasus region, however this is explained as recent migration from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Martin Richards|year=2000|title= Tracing European Founder Lineages in the Near Eastern mtDNA Pool |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=67 |pages= 1251–1276 |url=http://www.stats.gla.ac.uk/~vincent/papers/richards_2000.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0002-9297(07)62954-1 |pmid=11032788 |pmc=1288566|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; However 38% of the Sami U5b1b1 mtDNAs have haplotype so far exclusive to the Sami, containing a transition at np 16148.&lt;ref name="Tambets2004"/&gt;

Alessandro Achilli and colleagues noted that the Sami and the Berbers share U5b1b, which they estimated at 9,000 years old, and argued that this provides evidence for a radiation of the haplogroup from the Franco-Cantabrian refuge area of southwestern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Achilli, Saami and Berbers |year=2005|title=An Unexpected Mitochondrial DNA Link |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=76 |pages= 883–886 |pmc=1199377 |pmid=15791543 |doi=10.1086/430073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===V===
The divergence time for the Sami haplogroup V sequences is estimated by Max Ingman and Ulf Gyllensten at 7.600 years ago. But there is a difference within the Sami group in Sweden according to their study. North Sami (Sami in the North of Swedish Lapland) belong to haplogroup V with 58.6% and South Sami (Sami in the South of Swedish Lapland) within reindeer herding to 37.0% and South Sami outside reindeer herding/other occupation to 8.7%. That can be compared with Sami in Norway that has a 33.1% belonging to haplogroup V and Sami in Finland to 37.7%. Sami in Finland and South Sami in Sweden has the same percentage belonging to haplogroup V.&lt;ref name="Ingman2007"/&gt; But according to K. Tambets' et al. study is haplogroup V the most frequent haplogroup in the Swedish Sami and is present at significantly lower frequencies in Norwegian and Finnish subpopulations.&lt;ref name="Tambets2004"/&gt; But as just mentioned, goes those findings against those concluded by Ingman and Gyllensten. What speaks in benefit for Ingman's and Gyllensten's study is that they have deconstructed the Sami investigated in Sweden. That has not been done in the study by K. Tambets et al. A deconstruction of the Sami groups in genetic studies can reveal more closely when that specific group faced immigrants in their areas of habitation.

Torroni and colleagues have suggested that the spread of haplogroup V in Scandinavia and in eastern Europe is due to its late Pleistocene/early Holocene expansion from a Franco-Cantabrian glacial refugium.&lt;ref name="Torroni2001"&gt;{{cite journal| author=A. Torroni|title=A signal, from human mtDNA, of postglacial recolonization in Europe| journal=American Journal of Human Genetics|volume=69|year=2001|pages= 884–885|pmid=11517423|doi=10.1086/323485|pmc=1226069|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However subsequent studies found that haplogroup V is also significantly present in eastern Europeans. Furthermore, haplogroup V lineages with HVS-I transitions 16153 and 16298 that are frequent in the Sami population are much more widespread in eastern than in western Europe. So haplogroup V might have reached Fennoscandia via central/eastern Europe. Such a scenario is indirectly supported by the absence, among the Sami, of the pre-V mtDNAs that are characteristic of southwestern Europeans and northwestern
Africans.&lt;ref name="Tambets2004"/&gt;

===Z===
[[Haplogroup Z]] is found at low frequency in the Sami and Northern Asian populations but is virtually absent in Europe. Several conserved substitutions group the Sami Z lineages with those from Finland and the Volga-Ural region of Russia. The estimated dating of the lineage at 2700 years suggests a small, relatively recent contribution of people from the Volga-Ural region to the Sami population.&lt;ref name="Ingman2007"/&gt;

Three Y chromosome haplogroups dominate the distribution among the Sami: [[haplogroup N (Y-DNA)|N1c]] (formerly N3a), [[haplogroup I1 (Y-DNA)|I1]] and [[haplogroup R1a (Y-DNA)|R1a]] at least in the study carried out by K. Tambets et al. in 2004. The most common haplogroup among the Sami is N1c, with I1 as a close second according to that study. Haplogroup R1a in Sami is mostly seen in the Swedish Sami and Kola Sami populations, with a low level among the Finnish Sami. Tambets and colleagues suggested that N1c and R1a probably reached Fennoscandia from eastern Europe, where these haplogroups can be found in high frequencies.&lt;ref name="Tambets2004"/&gt;

However the two haplogroups have a distinctly different linguistic distribution. R1a1a is common among Eastern Europeans speaking Indo-European languages, while N1c correlates closely with the distribution  of the Finno Ugrian languages. For example, N1c is common among the Finns, while haplogroup R1a is common among all the neighbours of the Sami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tuuli Lappalainen |author2=Satu Koivumäki |author3=Elina Salmela |author4=Kirsi Huoponen |author5=Pertti Sistonen |author6=Marja-Liisa Savontaus |author7=Päivi Lahermo |title= Regional differences among the Finns: A Y-chromosomal perspective|journal=Gene|volume=376|issue= 2| year=2006 |pages= 207–215|doi=10.1016/j.gene.2006.03.004|pmid=16644145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haplogroup I1 is the most common haplogroup in Sweden, and the Jokkmokk Sami in Sweden have similar structure to Swedes and Finns for haplogroup I1 and N1c.

'''''Il Borghese''''' is a weekly cultural and political magazine with a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] stance published in Rome, Italy.

==History and profile==
''Il Borghese'' was established by [[Leo Longanesi]] in 1950.&lt;ref name="gapa"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gaetana Marrone|author2=Paolo Puppa|title=Encyclopedia of Italian Literary Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d9NcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA980|accessdate=2 May 2015|date=26 December 2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-45530-9|page=980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ser/&gt; He founded other magazines such as ''[[L'italiano]]'' and ''[[Omnibus (magazine)|Omnibus]]''.&lt;ref name=gapa/&gt; The magazine was named after the conservative [[Borghese family]].&lt;ref name=shal&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Heller |title=A Clever Magazine of the Right |url=http://www.printmag.com/daily-heller/borghese-a-clever-magazine-of-the-right/ |work=Great Infographics |accessdate=2 May 2015 |date=10 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730141408/http://www.printmag.com/daily-heller/borghese-a-clever-magazine-of-the-right/ |archivedate=30 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is published weekly and has a right-wing and conservative stance.&lt;ref name="ser"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sergio Luzzatto|title=The Body of Il Duce: Mussolini's Corpse and the Fortunes of Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h4x-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT133|accessdate=2 May 2015|date=21 October 2014|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-4668-8360-4|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=shal/&gt;

Leopoldo Longanesi and [[Indro Montanelli]] were the early co-editors of ''Il Borghese''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Francis Lane|title=Obituary: Indro Montanelli|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jul/24/guardianobituaries1|accessdate=2 May 2015|work=The Guardian|date=24 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former held the post until his death in 1957.&lt;ref name=mjo&gt;{{cite web|title=Leo Longanesi, four male characters|url=http://www.mattiajona.com/schede/longanesi2.html|work=Mattia Jona|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s the magazine was close to [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy Party]].&lt;ref name=bela&gt;{{cite news|author=Belardelli Giovanni|title=«Il Borghese» nella destra che non c' era|url=http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2002/ottobre/09/Borghese_nella_destra_che_non_co_0_0210092627.shtml|accessdate=2 May 2015|work=Corriere della Sera|date=9 October 2002|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its support ended when Longanesi argued that the party was too weak to counter the "communist threat".&lt;ref name=bela /&gt;

''Il Borghese'' was closed down in 2001.&lt;ref name=cci&gt;{{cite web|author1=Claudio Ciani|title=Il ritorno de Il Borghese rivista mensile di contro informazione|url=http://www.riscossacristiana.it/il-ritorno-de-il-borghese-rivista-mensile-di-contro-informazione-anticipazioni-dal-prossimo-numero-in-edicola-dal-1d-dicembre-di-claudio-ciani/|work=Riscossa Cristiana|accessdate=2 May 2015|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was relaunched in Rome in December 2012.&lt;ref name=cci/&gt;

The '''Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990''' (P.L. 101-644) is a  truth-in-advertising law which prohibits [[misrepresentation]] in marketing of [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] or [[Alaskan Natives|Alaska Native]] arts and crafts products within the United States. It is illegal to offer or display for sale, or sell any art or craft product in a manner that falsely suggests it is Indian produced, an Indian product, or the product of a particular Indian or Indian Tribe or [[Native American art|Indian arts]] and crafts organization, resident within the United States. For a first time violation of the Act, an individual can face civil or criminal penalties up to a $250,000 fine or a five-year prison term, or both. If business violates the Act, it can face civil penalties or can be prosecuted and fined up to $1,000,000.

The law covers all Indian and Indian-style traditional and contemporary arts and crafts produced after 1935. The Act broadly applies to the marketing of arts and crafts by any person in the United States. Some traditional items frequently copied by non-Indians include Indian-style jewelry, pottery, baskets, [[Zuni fetish|carved stone fetishes]], woven rugs, [[kachina]] figures, and clothing.

The [[Indian Arts and Crafts Board]], an agency established in 1934, has responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the Act.

==Definitions==
The [[US Department of the Interior]] explicitly states on its informational website about the Act that, "Under the Act, an Indian is defined as a member of any federally or State recognized Indian Tribe, or an individual certified as an Indian artisan by an Indian Tribe."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html "The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925020543/http://www.doi.gov/iacb/act.html |date=2006-09-25 }} ''US Department of the Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board.'' Retrieved 24 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Section 309.2, the Act defines an "Indian tribe" as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;(1) Any Indian tribe, band, nation, Alaska Native village, or any organized group or community which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; or (2) Any Indian group that has been formally recognized as an Indian tribe by a State legislature or by a State commission or similar organization legislatively vested with State tribal recognition authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2001/aprqtr/pdf/25cfr308.4.pdf p. 785 of the Act.] US Department of the Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board. Retrieved 23 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

All products must be marketed truthfully regarding the Indian heritage and tribal affiliation of the producers, so as not to mislead the consumer. It is illegal to market an art or craft item using the name of a tribe if a member, or certified Indian artisan, of that tribe did not actually create the art or craft item.

Section 309.4 of the act also allows for individuals with tribal ancestry who are not eligible for enrollment to be designated as "an Indian artisan by a particular tribe". The certification must be documented in writing by the tribal government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnatam.com/law.html "Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 Public Law 101-644."] ''Native American Artists.'' 21 Oct 1996. Accessed 18 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act does not apply to [[Service (economics)|services]] as was revealed by the judgement in a case against [[James Arthur Ray]].

==Controversy==
Cultural anthropologist and attorney Gail Sheffield and others claim that this law has had "the unintended consequence of sanctioning discrimination against Native Americans whose tribal affiliation was not officially recognized."&lt;ref&gt;Gail Sheffield, ''The Arbitrary Indian: The Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990''. University of Oklahoma Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who claim to be Native artists but are not enrolled in a tribe run the risk of fines or imprisonment if they continue to sell their art while claiming Native heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Perezo, "Indigenous Art." In ''A Companion to American Indian History'', ed. by Philip Deloria and Neal Salisbury (Blackwell, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James J. Kilpatrick, "[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1992-12-13/news/9203060467_1_indian-tribe-indian-arts-indian-blood A Cozy Little Restraint Of Trade Rules Indian Arts And Crafts]". Broward &amp; Palm Beach ''Sun-Sentinel'', December 13, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sam Blackwell, "[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1893&amp;dat=20001006&amp;id=QMdKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-ccMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1871,5684721 Playing Politics with Native American Art]."

==Etymology==
Jericho's name in [[Modern Hebrew language|Hebrew]], {{transl|he|''Yeriẖo''}}, is generally thought to derive from the [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] word ''reaẖ'' ("fragrant"), but other theories hold that it originates in the Canaanite word for "[[moon]]" (''Yareaẖ'') or the name of the lunar [[deity]] [[Yarikh]] for whom the city was an early centre of worship.&lt;ref name=Schreiberp141&gt;Schreiber, 2003, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jericho's Arabic name, {{transl|ar|DIN|''ʼArīḥā''}}, means "fragrant" and also has its roots in Canaanite ''Reaẖ''.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bromileyp1136&gt;Bromiley, 1995, p. 1136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://faculty.gordon.edu/hu/bi/Ted_Hildebrandt/OTeSources/01-Genesis/Text/Articles-Books/Waltke_CreationIV_BSac.pdf|title=The Creation Account in Genesis 1:1-3|work=Bibliotheca Sacra 132|year=1975|pages=327–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of excavations===
The first excavations of the site were made by [[Charles Warren]] in 1868. [[Ernst Sellin]] and [[Carl Watzinger]] excavated Tell es-Sultan and Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq between 1907 and 1909, and in 1911, and [[John Garstang]] excavated between 1930 and 1936. Extensive investigations using more modern techniques were made by [[Kathleen Kenyon]] between 1952 and 1958. [[Lorenzo Nigro]] and [[Nicolò Marchetti]] conducted excavations in 1997–2000. Since 2009 the Italian-Palestinian archaeological project of excavation and restoration was resumed by Rome "La Sapienza" University and Palestinian MOTA-DACH under the direction of Lorenzo Nigro and Hamdan Taha, and Jehad Yasine since 2015.&lt;ref name="lasapienzatojericho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasapienzatojericho.it|website=lasapienzatojericho.it|title=Tell es-Sultan/Jericho|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian-Palestinian Expedition carried out 13 seasons in 20 years (1997–2017), with some major discoveries, like Tower A1 in the Middle Bronze Age southern Lower Town and Palace G on the eastern flanks of the Spring Hill overlooking the Spring of 'Ain es-Sultan dating from Early Bronze III.

===Stone Age: Tell es-Sultan and its spring===
{{See also|Tell es-Sultan}}
The earliest settlement was located at the present-day Tell es-Sultan (or Sultan's Hill), a couple of kilometers from the current city. In both [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and Hebrew, ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]'' means "mound" – consecutive layers of habitation built up a mound over time, as is common for ancient settlements in the Middle East and [[Anatolia]]. Jericho is the [[type site]] for the [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A]] (PPNA) and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B]] (PPNB) periods.

====Natufian hunter-gatherers, {{circa}} 10,000 BC====
[[Epipaleolithic]] construction at the site appears to predate the invention of [[agriculture]], with the construction of [[Natufian culture]] structures beginning earlier than 9000&amp;nbsp;BC, the beginning of the [[Holocene]] epoch in geologic history.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp689/&gt;

Jericho has evidence of settlement dating back to 10,000&amp;nbsp;BC. During the [[Younger Dryas]] period of cold and drought, permanent habitation of any one location was impossible. However, the [[Ein as-Sultan|Ein es-Sultan]] spring at what would become Jericho was a popular camping ground for [[Natufian]] hunter-gatherer groups, who left a scattering of crescent-shaped microlith tools behind them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mithen |first=Steven |title=After the ice: a global human history, 20,000–5000 BC |year=2006 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=0-674-01999-7 |page=57 |edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 9600&amp;nbsp;BC, the droughts and cold of the Younger Dryas [[stadial]] had come to an end, making it possible for Natufian groups to extend the duration of their stay, eventually leading to year-round habitation and permanent settlement.

Its cultures lacked  pottery, but featured the following:
* small circular dwellings
* burial of the dead under the floor of buildings
* reliance on hunting of wild game
* cultivation of wild or domestic cereals

At Jericho, circular dwellings were built of [[Adobe|clay and straw]] bricks left to dry in the sun, which were plastered together with a mud mortar. Each house measured about {{convert|5|m}} across, and was roofed with mud-smeared brush. Hearths were located within and outside the homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mithen|first=Steven|title=After the Ice: A Global Human History, 20,000–5000 BC|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-01999-7|page=54|edition=1st Harvard University Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By about 9400&amp;nbsp;BC, the town had grown to more than 70 modest dwellings.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

=====Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB, a period of about 1.4 millenia)=====
The following are Pre-Pottery Neolithic B cultural features, for the period from 7220 to 5850&amp;nbsp;BC (though [[carbon-14]]-dates are few and early):
* Expanded range of domesticated plants
* Possible [[Domestic sheep|domestication of sheep]]
* Apparent [[cult (religion)|cult]] involving the preservation of human skulls, with facial features reconstructed using [[plaster]], and eyes set with shells in some cases

After a few centuries, the first settlement was abandoned. After the PPNA settlement phase, there was a settlement hiatus of several centuries, then the PPNB settlement was founded on the eroded surface of the [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]. This second settlement, established in 6800&amp;nbsp;BC, perhaps represents the work of an invading people who absorbed the original inhabitants into their dominant culture. Artifacts dating from this period include ten [[plastered human skulls]], painted so as to reconstitute the individuals' features.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt; These represent either [[teraphim]] or the first example of [[portrait]]ure in [[art history]],{{dubious|reason=see [[Tell Awad]] and discussion on Jericho's talk page|date=August 2013}} and it is thought that they were kept in people's homes while the bodies were buried.&lt;ref name=Freedmanp689/&gt;&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;Janson and Janson, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture consisted of rectilinear buildings made of mudbricks on stone foundations. The mudbricks were loaf-shaped with deep thumb prints to facilitate bonding. No building has been excavated in its entirety. Normally, several rooms cluster around a central courtyard. There is one big room ({{convert|6.5|x|4|m|1|abbr=on|lk=out}}{{dubious|reason=conversion via template displays unwarranted  (false) precision|date=February 2018}} and {{convert|7|x|3|m|1|abbr=on|lk=out}}){{dubious|reason=conversion via template displays unwarranted  (false) precision|date=February 2018}} with internal divisions; the rest are small, presumably used for storage. The rooms have red or pinkish [[terrazzo]]-floors made of lime. Some impressions of mats made of reeds or rushes have been preserved. The courtyards have clay floors.

[[Kathleen Kenyon]] interpreted one building as a [[shrine]]. It contained a niche in the wall. A chipped pillar of volcanic stone that was found nearby might have fitted into this niche.

The dead were buried under the floors or in the rubble fill of abandoned buildings. There are several collective burials. Not all the skeletons are completely articulated, which may point to a time of exposure before burial. A [[human skull|skull]] cache contained seven skulls. The jaws were removed and the faces covered with plaster; [[cowry|cowries]] were used as eyes. A total of ten skulls were found. Modelled skulls were found in [[Tell Ramad]] and [[Beisamoun]] as well.

Other finds included flints, such as arrowheads (tanged or side-notched), finely denticulated sickle-blades, [[Burin (lithic flake)|burin]]s, scrapers, a few [[tranchet axe]]s, [[obsidian]], and green obsidian from an unknown source. There were also [[Quern-stone|querns]], hammerstones, and a few ground-stone axes made of greenstone. Other items discovered included dishes and bowls carved from soft limestone, spindle whorls made of stone and possible loom weights, spatulae and drills, stylised anthropomorphic plaster figures, almost life-size, [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] and [[Therianthropy|theriomorphic]] clay figurines, as well as shell and malachite beads.

In the late 4th millennium BC, Jericho was occupied during Neolithic 2{{dubious|Neol. 2 seems to be equivalent with PPNB, which ends long before M4 BC. Unless pottery appeared at Jericho later than M4, this is a mistake AND THIS BELONGS EITHER UNDER CHALCOLITHIC OR BRONZE AGE.|date=February 2016}} and the general character of the remains on the site link it culturally with Neolithic 2 (or PPNB) sites in the West Syrian and Middle Euphrates groups. This link is established by the presence of rectilinear mud-brick buildings and plaster floors that are characteristic of the age.

===Bronze Age===
A succession of settlements followed from 4500&amp;nbsp;BC onward.

====Early Bronze Age====
In the Early Bronze IIIA (c. 2700 – 2500/2450&amp;nbsp;BC; Sultan IIIC1), the settlement reached its largest extent around 2600&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

During Early Bronze IIIB (c. 2500/2450–2350&amp;nbsp;BC; Sultan IIIC2) there was a Palace G on Spring Hill and city walls.

====Middle Bronze Age====
{{for|the Biblical battle|Battle of Jericho}}
Jericho was continually occupied into the Middle [[Bronze Age#Near East|Bronze Age]]; it was destroyed in the Late Bronze Age, after which it no longer served as an urban centre. The city was surrounded by extensive defensive walls strengthened with rectangular towers, and possessed an extensive cemetery with vertical shaft-tombs and underground burial chambers; the elaborate funeral offerings in some of these may reflect the emergence of local kings.{{sfn|Kuijt|2012|p=167}}

During the Middle Bronze Age, Jericho was a small prominent city of the [[Canaan]] region, reaching its greatest Bronze Age extent in the period from 1700 to 1550&amp;nbsp;BC. It seems to have reflected the greater urbanization in the area at that time, and has been linked to the rise of the [[Maryannu]], a class of chariot-using aristocrats linked to the rise of the [[Mitanni]]te state to the north. [[Kathleen Kenyon]] reported "the Middle Bronze Age is perhaps the most prosperous in the whole history of Kna'an. ... The defenses ... belong to a fairly advanced date in that period" and there was "a massive stone [[revetment]] ... part of a complex system" of defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kenyon|first1=Kathleen Mary|authorlink1=Kathleen Kenyon|title=Digging Up Jericho|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/DIGGING_UP_JERICHO.html?id=_z33N1QsSHEC|publisher=[[Ernest Benn Limited]]|date=1957|location=[[London, England]]|isbn=978-0510033118|pages=213–218|accessdate=26 February 2018|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bronze Age Jericho fell in the 16th century at the end of the Middle Bronze Age, the calibrated carbon remains from its City-IV destruction layer dating to 1617–1530&amp;nbsp;BC. Notably this carbon dating {{circa}} 1573&amp;nbsp;BC confirmed the accuracy of the stratigraphical dating {{circa}} 1550 by Kenyon.

====Late Bronze Age====
There was evidence of a small settlement in the Late Bronze Age ({{circa}} 1400s BC) on the site, but erosion and destruction from previous excavations have erased significant parts of this layer.&lt;ref name="Davis 2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miriam C Davis|title=Dame Kathleen Kenyon: Digging Up the Holy Land|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq0YDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT121|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1315430673|page=121,126, 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jr.2009"/&gt;

===Persian and Early Hellenistic periods===
After the destruction of the Judahite city by the Babylonians in the late 6th century,{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}} whatever was rebuilt in the Persian period as part of the [[Return to Zion#The return to Zion|Restoration]] after the [[Babylonian captivity]], left only very few remains.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt; The tell was abandoned as a place of settlement not long after this period.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt; During the Persian through Hellenistic periods, there is little in terms of occupation attested throughout the region.{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}}

Jericho went from being an administrative centre of [[Yehud Medinata]] ("the Province of Judah") under [[Achaemenid Phoenicia|Persian rule]] to serving as the private estate of [[Alexander the Great]] between 336 and 323&amp;nbsp;BC after his conquest of the region.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In the middle of the 2nd century BC Jericho was under [[Hellenistic]] rule of the [[Seleucid Empire]], when the [[Syrian]] General [[Bacchides (general)|Bacchides]] built a number of forts to strengthen the defences of the area around Jericho against the revolt by the [[Macabees]].&lt;ref&gt;1 Maccabees 9:50&lt;/ref&gt; One of these forts, built at the entrance to [[Wadi Qelt]], was later refortified by [[Herod the Great]], who named it ''Kypros'' after his mother.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289&gt;Murphy-O'Connor, 1998, pp. 289–291.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasmonean and Herodian periods===
{{Further|Jericho royal winter palaces}}
After the abandonment of the Tell es-Sultan location, the new Jericho of the Late Hellenistic or [[Hasmoneans|Hasmonean]] and Early Roman or Herodian periods, was established as a garden city in the vicinity of the royal estate at '''Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq''' and expanded greatly thanks to the intensive exploitation of the springs of the area.&lt;ref name="NegevGibson"/&gt; The new site consists of a group of low mounds on both banks of [[Wadi Qelt]].{{sfn|Jacobs|2000|p=691}} The Hasmoneans were a dynasty descending from a priestly group ([[Kohen|kohanim]]) from the [[tribe of Levi]], who ruled over Judea following the success of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] until Roman influence over the region brought Herod to claim the Hasmonean throne.&lt;ref&gt;Magnusson, Magnus (1977). ''Archaeology of the Bible''. New York: Simon and Schuster. p. 219. {{ISBN|9780671240103}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rock-cut tombs of a Herodian- and Hasmonean-era cemetery lie in the lowest part of the cliffs between Nuseib al-Aweishireh and [[Mount of Temptation|Jabal Quruntul]] in Jericho and were used between 100&amp;nbsp;BCE and 68&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt;

====Herodian period====
[[File:Jerycho50.jpg|thumb|right|Remains from [[Herod the Great|Herod's]] palace]]
Herod had to lease back the royal estate at Jericho from [[Cleopatra]], after [[Mark Antony]] had given it to her as a gift. After their joint suicide in 30&amp;nbsp;BC, [[Octavian]] assumed control of the Roman Empire and granted Herod absolute rule over Jericho, as part of the new [[Herodian dynasty|Herodian]] domain. Herod's rule oversaw the construction of a [[hippodrome]]-theatre (''Tell es-Samrat'') to entertain his guests and new [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]]s to irrigate the area below the cliffs and reach his winter palaces built at the site of ''Tulul Abu el-Alaiq'' (also written '''Alayiq'').&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt; In 2008 the [[Israel Exploration Society]] published an illustrated volume of Herod's third Jericho palace.&lt;ref&gt;Silvia Rozenberg; Ehud Netzer (2008).

The dramatic murder of [[Aristobulus III]] in a swimming pool at the winter palaces near Jericho, as described by the Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus]], took place during a banquet organized by Herod's Hasmonean mother-in-law. After the construction of the palaces, the city had functioned not only as an agricultural center and as a crossroad, but also as a winter resort for [[Jerusalem]]'s aristocracy.&lt;ref name="STF"&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/012discuss.html Jericho - (Ariha)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307205816/http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/mad/discussion/012discuss.html |date=7 March 2016 }} Studium Biblicum Franciscum - Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt;

Herod was succeeded in [[Tetrarchy (Judea)|Judea]] by his son, [[Herod Archelaus]], who built a village in his name not far to the north, [[Archelaïs]] (modern Khirbet al-Beiyudat), to house workers for his date plantation.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

First-century Jericho is described in [[Strabo]]'s ''Geography'' as follows:
{{quote|Jericho is a plain surrounded by a kind of mountainous country, which in a way, slopes toward it like a theatre. Here is the Phoenicon, which is mixed also with all kinds of cultivated and fruitful trees, though it consists mostly of palm trees. It is 100 [[stadia (length)|stadia]] in length and is everywhere watered with streams. Here also are the Palace and the Balsam Park.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt;}}

====In the New Testament====
[[File:El Greco - Christ Healing the Blind - WGA10420.jpg|thumb|250px|''Christ Healing the Blind in Jericho'', El Greco]]
The Christian [[Gospels]] state that [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]] passed through Jericho where he healed blind beggars ({{Bibleref2|Matthew 20:29}}), and inspired a local chief tax-collector named [[Zacchaeus]] to [[repent]] of his dishonest practices ({{Bibleref2|Luke 19:1–10}}). The road between Jerusalem and Jericho is the setting for the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+10&amp;version=NIV |title=The Parable of the Good Samaritan Luke 10:25 |publisher=Biblegateway.com |date= |accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Wesley]], in his New Testament Notes on this section of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke's Gospel]], claimed that "about twelve thousand priests and Levites dwelt there, who all attended the service of the temple".&lt;ref&gt;Wesley, J., [http://wesley.nnu.edu/john-wesley/john-wesleys-notes-on-the-bible/notes-on-the-gospel-according-to-st-luke/#Chapter+X ''Notes on The Gospel According to St Luke'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Smith (lexicographer)|Smith]]'s ''Bible Names Dictionary'' suggests that on the arrival of Jesus and his entourage, "Jericho was once more 'a city of palms' when our Lord visited it. Here he restored sight to the blind (Matthew 20:30; Mark 10:46; Luke 18:35). Here the descendant of [[Rahab]] did not disdain the hospitality of Zaccaeus the publican. Finally, between Jerusalem and Jericho was laid the scene of his story of the good Samaritan."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/resources/smiths-bible-names-dictionary/Jericho Smith's Bible Names Dictionary: Jericho], accessed 6 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman province===
After the fall of Jerusalem to Vespasian's armies in the Great Revolt of Judea in 70&amp;nbsp;AD, Jericho declined rapidly, and by 100&amp;nbsp;AD it was but a small Roman garrison town.&lt;ref name=Loschp117/&gt; A fort was built there in 130 and played a role in putting down the [[Bar Kochba revolt]] in 133.

===Byzantine period===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 15003 Jericho synagogue mosaic.JPG|thumb|250px|Copy of Mosaic of the Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue, 6th–7th century AD]]
[[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Accounts]] of Jericho by a Christian [[pilgrim]] are given in 333. Shortly thereafter the built-up area of the town was abandoned and a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Jericho, ''Ericha'', was built 1600 metres (1&amp;nbsp;mi) to the east, on which the modern town is centered.&lt;ref name=Loschp117&gt;Losch, 2005, p. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] took hold in the city during the Byzantine era and the area was heavily populated. A number of monasteries and churches were built, including [[St. George's Monastery, Wadi Qelt|St George of Koziba]] in 340&amp;nbsp;AD and a domed church dedicated to [[Elisha|Saint Eliseus]].&lt;ref name="STF"/&gt; At least two [[synagogue]]s were also built in the 6th century AD.&lt;ref name=Murphyp289/&gt; The monasteries were abandoned after the [[Sasanian Empire|Persian]] [[Sasanian conquest of Jerusalem|invasion of 614]].&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

The [[Jericho Synagogue]] in the Royal Maccabean winter palace at Jericho dates from 70–50&amp;nbsp;BC.

A synagogue dating to the late 6th or early 7th century AD was discovered in Jericho in 1936, and was named [[Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue]], or "peace unto Israel", after the central [[Hebrew]] motto in its mosaic floor. It was controlled by Israel after the Six Day War, but after the handover to Palestinian Authority control per the Oslo Accords, it has been a source of conflict. On the night of 12 October 2000, the synagogue was vandalized by Palestinians who burned holy books and relics and damaged the mosaic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=377&amp;PID=1852&amp;IID=1923 |title=The Palestinian Authority and the Jewish Holy Sites |publisher=JCPA |date = |accessdate=21 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jewishjericho&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishjericho.org.il/english/places/shalomalyisrael.html |title=Jewish life in Jericho |publisher=Jewishjericho.org.il |date= |accessdate=5 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Naaran|Na'aran]] synagogue, another Byzantine era construction, was discovered on the northern outskirts of Jericho in 1918. While less is known of it than Shalom Al Yisrael, it has a larger mosaic and is in similar condition.&lt;ref name=jewishjericho/&gt;

===Early Muslim period===
{{Further|Hisham's Palace}}
[[File:Arabischer Mosaizist um 735 001.jpg|right|thumb|[[Arab]]ic [[Umayyad]] [[mosaic]] from [[Hisham's Palace]] in Jericho]]

Jericho, by then named "Ariha" in Arabic variation, became part of [[Jund Filastin]] ("Military District of Palestine"), part of the larger province of [[Bilad al-Sham]]. The Arab Muslim historian Musa b. 'Uqba (died 758) recorded that [[caliph]] [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] exiled the Jews and Christians of [[Khaybar]] to Jericho (and Tayma).&lt;ref&gt;Several hadith collections: e.g. Bukhari, ''Sahih'' as translated Muḥammad Muḥsin Khân, ''The Translation of the Meanings of Sahih al-Bukhari'' (India: Kitab Bhavan, 1987) 3.39.531 and 4.53.380, and Muslim ''Sahih'' trans. Abdul Hamid Siddiqui (Lahore: Kazi Publications, 1976) 10.3763.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 659, that district had come under the control of [[Mu'awiya]], founder of the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad dynasty]]. That year, an earthquake destroyed Jericho.&lt;ref&gt;''The Maronite Chronicle'', written during Mu'awiya's caliphate. Note that for propaganda reasons it dates the earthquake to the wrong year: Andrew Palmer, ''The Seventh Century in the West-Syrian Chronicles'' (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1993), 30, 31, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, the pilgrim [[Arculf]] visited Jericho and found it in ruins, all its "miserable Canaanite" inhabitants now dispersed in shanty towns around the Dead Sea shore.&lt;ref&gt;"The Pilgrimage of Arculf in the Holy Land", De Locis Sanctis as translated by Rev. James Rose MacPherson (W. London: BD. 24, Hanover Square, 1895), ch. I.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

A palatial complex long attributed to the tenth Umayyad caliph, [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik]] (r. 724–743) and thus known as [[Hisham's Palace]], is located at Khirbet al-Mafjar, about 1.5 kilometres (1&amp;nbsp;mi) north of Tell es-Sultan. This [[Desert castle|"desert castle" or ''qasr'']] was more likely built by Caliph [[Al-Walid II|Walid ibn Yazid]] (r. 743–744), who was assassinated before he could complete the construction.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Murphy-O’Connor, ''The Holy Land: An Oxford Archaeological Guide from Earliest Times to 1700'', Oxford University Press 2008, pp. 342–344.&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of two mosques, a courtyard, mosaics, and other items can still be seen ''in situ'' today. The unfinished structure was largely destroyed in an earthquake in 747.

Umayyad rule ended in 750 and was followed by the [[Arab]] caliphates of the [[Abbasid]] and [[Fatimid]] dynasties. Irrigated agriculture was developed under Islamic rule, reaffirming Jericho's reputation as a fertile "City of the Palms".&lt;ref name=Shahinp285&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Muqaddasi|Al-Maqdisi]], the Arab geographer, wrote in 985 that "the water of Jericho is held to be the highest and best in all [[Islam]]. [[Banana]]s are plentiful, also [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] and flowers of fragrant odor".&lt;ref name=Shahinp283&gt;Shahin, 2005, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; Jericho is also referred to by him as one of the principal cities of Jund Filastin.&lt;ref&gt;al-Muqaddasi quoted in Le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/39/mode/1up 39]&lt;/ref&gt;

The city flourished until 1071 with the invasion of the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk Turks]], followed by the upheavals of the [[Crusades]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Crusader period===
In 1179, the Crusaders rebuilt the Monastery of St. George of Koziba, at its original site 10 kilometres (6&amp;nbsp;mi) from the center of town. They also built another two churches and a monastery dedicated to [[John the Baptist]], and are credited with introducing [[sugarcane]] production to the city.&lt;ref name=Hull&gt;Hull, 1855.&lt;/ref&gt; The site of Tawahin es-Sukkar (lit. "sugar mills") holds remains of a Crusader sugar production facility. In 1187, the Crusaders were evicted by the [[Ayyubid]] forces of [[Saladin]] after their victory in the [[Battle of Hattin]], and the town slowly went into decline.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

===Ayyubid and Mamluk periods===
[[File:Map of Jericho in 14c Farhi Bible by Elisha ben Avraham Crescas.jpg|thumb|14th century map of Jericho in Farchi Bible]]
In 1226, Arab geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] said of Jericho, "it has many palm trees, also sugarcane in quantities, and bananas. The best of all the sugar in the ''[[Ghaur]]'' land is made here." In the 14th century, [[Abu al-Fida]] writes there are [[sulfur]] mines in Jericho, "the only ones in Palestine".&lt;ref&gt;al-Hamawi and Abu-l Fida quoted in Le Strange, 1890, p. [https://archive.org/stream/palestineundermo00lestuoft#page/397/mode/1up 397]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman period===
[[File:Jerico1.jpg|thumb|right|Postcard image depicting Jericho in the late 19th or early 20th century]]
Jericho  was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517 with all of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and in 1545 a revenue of 19,000 [[Akçe]] was recorded, destined for the new [[Waqf]]  for the [[Haseki Sultan Imaret]] of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Singerp52&gt;Singer, 2002, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA50  50], [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA52  52]&lt;/ref&gt; The villagers processed [[indigo]] as one source of revenue, using a cauldron specifically for this purpose that was loaned to them by the Ottoman authorities in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=Singerp120&gt;Singer, 2002, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA120  120]&lt;/ref&gt; Later that century, the Jericho revenues no longer went to the Haseki Sultan Imaret.&lt;ref name=Singerp126&gt;Singer, 2002, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zHBHBTNwBQoC&amp;pg=PA126  126]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1596 Jericho  appeared in the  [[daftar|tax registers]]  under the name of ''Riha'', being in the ''[[nahiya]]'' of Al-Quds in the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|liwa]]'' of [[Al-Quds]]. It had a population of 51 household, all [[Muslim]]s. They paid a fixed  tax-rate of 33,3% on agricultural products, including wheat, barley, summer crops, vineyards and fruit trees, goats and beehives, water buffaloes, in addition to occasional revenues; a total of 40,000 [[Akçe]]. All of the revenue still  went to a [[Waqf]].&lt;ref name=HA114&gt;Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

The French traveler [[Laurent d'Arvieux]] described the city in 1659 as "now desolate, and consists only of about fifty poor houses, in bad condition ... The plain around is extremely fertile; the soil is middling fat; but it is watered by several rivulets, which flow into the Jordan. Notwithstanding these advantages only the gardens adjacent to the town are cultivated."&lt;ref&gt;Graham, 1836, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_0ZYCAAAAQAAJ#page/n136/mode/1up 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, European scholars, archaeologists and missionaries visited often.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt; At the time it was an oasis in a poor state, similar to other regions in the plains and deserts.&lt;ref name=benarieh&gt;Ben-Arieh, Yehoshua.

[https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearc00smitgoog#page/n302/mode/1up   280]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titus Tobler]] (1854) reported some 30 poor huts, whose residents paid a total of 3611 [[Kuruş]] in tax.&lt;ref&gt;[[Titus Tobler]], ''Topographie von Jerusalem und seinen Umgebungen'', Berlin, 1853–1854, p. 642&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Samuel Hershberg]] also reported some 30 poor huts and 300 residents.&lt;ref&gt;A.s. Hershberg, ''In the Land of the East'', Vilna 1899, p. 469&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Jericho was the residence of the region's Turkish governor. The main water sources for the village were a spring called ''Ein al-Sultan'' in Arabic and ''Elisha Spring'' in Hebrew, and springs in [[Wadi Qelt]].&lt;ref name=benarieh/&gt;

An [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]  village list from around 1870 showed that  ''Riha'', Jericho, had 36 houses and a population of 105, though the population count included men, only.&lt;ref&gt;Socin, 1879, p. [https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftdesde01deut#page/159/mode/1up 159]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_BZobAQAAIAAJ#page/n932/mode/1up  124], noted  34 houses&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]] at Tell es-Sultan was carried out in 1867, and the monasteries of St. George of Koziba and John the Baptist were refounded and completed in 1901 and 1904, respectively.&lt;ref name=Ringp367/&gt;

===British Mandate period===
During [[World War II]] The British built fortresses in Jericho with the help of the Jewish company [[Solel Boneh]], and bridges were rigged with explosives in preparation for a possible invasion by German allied forces.&lt;ref name=Frilingp65&gt;Friling and Cummings, 2005, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of [[World War I]], Jericho came under the rule of the [[Mandatory Palestine]].

According to the [[1922 census of Palestine]], Jericho had 1,029 inhabitants, consisting of 931 Muslims, 6 Jews and 92 Christians;&lt;ref name=Census1922a&gt;Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Jericho, p. [https://archive.org/stream/PalestineCensus1922/Palestine%20Census%20%281922%29#page/n21/mode/1up  19]&lt;/ref&gt; where the Christians were 45 Orthodox, 12 Roman Catholics, 13 Greek Catholics ([[Melchites]]), 6 Syrian Catholic, 11 Armenians, 4 Copts and 1 Church of England.&lt;ref name=Census1922b&gt;Barron, 1923, Table XIV, p.

In 1927, an [[1927 Jericho earthquake|earthquake struck]] and affected Jericho and other cities. Around 300 people died,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yalibnan.com/2013/10/22/israel-hit-by-fifth-minor-quake-in-a-week/ |title=Israel hit by fifth minor quake in a week |publisher=[[Ya Libnan]] |date=22 October 2013 |accessdate=27 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but by the  [[1931 census of Palestine|1931 census]] the population had increased to 1,693 inhabitants, in 347 houses.&lt;ref name="Census1931"&gt;Mills, 1932, p.[https://archive.org/details/CensusOfPalestine1931.PopulationOfVillagesTownsAndAdministrativeAreas   45]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordanian period===
Jericho came under [[Jordan]]ian control after the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. The [[Jericho Conference]], organized by King Abdullah and attended by over 2,000 Palestinian delegates in 1948 proclaimed "His Majesty Abdullah as King of all Palestine" and called for "the unification of Palestine and Transjordan as a step toward full [[Arab]] unity". In mid-1950, Jordan formally annexed the West Bank and Jericho residents, like other residents of West Bank localities became Jordanian citizens.&lt;ref name=Benvenistip27&gt;Benvenisti, 1998, pp. 27-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, the population of Jericho was  10,166,&lt;ref&gt;Government of Jordan, 1964, p.

===1967, aftermath===
Jericho has been [[military occupation|occupied]] by [[Israel]] since the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 along with the rest of the West Bank. It was the first city handed over to [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Authority]] control in accordance with the [[Oslo Accords]].&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/0914/p01s04-wome.html|title=At 10th anniversary, a far poorer Palestinian Authority|first=Ilene R.|last=Prusher|date=14 September 2004|publisher=|via=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited Palestinian self-rule of Jericho was agreed on in the [[Gaza–Jericho Agreement]] of 4 May 1994.

In response to the 2001 [[Second Intifada]] and [[suicide bombings]], Jericho was re-occupied by Israeli troops.&lt;ref name="csmonitor.com"/&gt; A {{convert|2|m|adj=on}} deep trench was built around a large part of the city to control Palestinian traffic to and from Jericho.&lt;ref name=ARIJ&gt;ARIJ &amp; LRC, 20 March 2001, [http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/view.php?recordID=138 ''The Tightening of the Siege on Jericho: Israel Employs a New Policy of Trench Digging''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613235138/http://www.poica.org/editor/case_studies/view.php?recordID=138 |date=13 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 March 2006, the [[Israel Defense Forces]] launched [[Operation Bringing Home the Goods]], raiding a Jericho prison to capture the PFLP general secretary, [[Ahmad Sa'adat]], and five other prisoners, all of whom had been charged with assassinating the Israeli tourist minister [[Rehavam Zeevi]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4806714.stm Israel holds militant after siege] 14 March 2006 ''[[BBC News]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1536 Jericho municipality עיריית יריחו.jpg|thumb|Municipality of Jericho, 1967]]
In the first census carried out by the [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS), in 1997, Jericho's population was 14,674. [[Palestinian refugee]]s constituted a significant 43.6% of the residents or 6,393 people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t6.aspx Palestinian Population by Locality and Refugee Status] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118181551/https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t6.aspx |date=18 November 2008 }} [[Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics]] (PCBS).&lt;/ref&gt; The gender make-up of the city was 51% male and 49% female. Jericho has a young population, with nearly half (49.2%) of the inhabitants being under the age of 20. People between the ages of 20 and 44 made up 36.2% of the population, 10.7% between the ages of 45 and 64, and 3.6% were over the age of 64.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t1.aspx Palestinian Population by Locality, Sex and Age Groups in Years] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614231532/http://www.pcbs.gov.ps/Portals/_pcbs/phc_97/jer_t1.aspx |date=14 June 2008 }} (PCBS).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2007 census by the PCBS, Jericho had a population of 18,346.&lt;ref name="PCBS"/&gt;

Demographics have varied widely depending on the dominant ethnic group and rule in the region over the past three thousand years. In a 1945 land and population survey by [[Sami Hadawi]], 3,010 inhabitants is the figure given for Jericho, of which 94% (2840) were Arab and 6% (170) were Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Hadawi, 1970, [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20I/Jerusalem/Page-057.jpg p.57]&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, the overwhelming majority of the population is [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{Citation|first=Dan|last=Fisher|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-02-02/news/mn-142_1_beit-jala/2|title=World's Oldest City Retains Lure : Biblical Jericho: Winter Oasis for the West Bank|work=Los Angeles Times|date=2 February 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Palestinian Christians|Christian]] community makes up around 1% of the population.&lt;ref name="ilsussidiario.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilsussidiario.net/News/English-Spoken-Here/From-the-World/2012/5/24/HOLY-LAND-Jericho-A-small-Christian-community-and-their-school/283382/|title=HOLY LAND/ Jericho: A small Christian community and their school|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large community of black Palestinians is present in Jericho.&lt;ref name="LATimes"/&gt;

==Economy==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 1539 The market of Jericho השוק ביריחו.jpg|thumb|250px|Jericho marketplace, 1967]]
In 1994, Israel and the Palestinians signed an economic accord that enabled Palestinians in Jericho to open banks, collect taxes and engage in export and import in preparation for self-rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/30/world/gaza-jericho-economic-accord-signed-by-israel-and-palestinians.html|title=Gaza-Jericho Economic Accord Signed by Israel and Palestinians|first=Marlise|last=Simons|date=30 April 1994|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tourism===
In 2010, Jericho, with its proximity to the Dead Sea, was declared the most popular destination among Palestinian tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/expat/expatnews/7214355/Palestinians-aim-to-push-tourism-beyond-Bethlehem.html|title=Palestinians aim to push tourism beyond Bethlehem|first=By Gavin Rabinowitz, in Bethlehem for|last=AFP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a $150&amp;nbsp;million casino-hotel was built in Jericho with the backing of Yasser Arafat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1998-07-26/news/1998207031_1_casinos-austria-play-in-casinos-jericho|title=Walls going up in Jericho -- construction of casino-hotel Palestinians, Israelis have role in project|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The casino is now closed, though the hotel on the premises is open for guests.

====Biblical and Christian tourism====
Christian tourism is one of Jericho's primary sources of income. There are several major Christian pilgrimage sites in and around Jericho.
* [[Mount of Temptation]], topped by a Greek Orthodox monastery with panoramic views of the region. A cable car runs up to the monastery.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;
* the Spring of Elisha, as the [[Ein as-Sultan|Ein es-Sultan]] spring is known to Jews and Christians
* the Sycamore tree of [[Zacchaeus]] (two such trees are venerated at different locations as being related to the original tree mentioned in the Gospels)
* the nearby traditional site of the [[baptism of Jesus]] at [[Qasr el Yahud|Qasr el-Yahud]]/[[Al-Maghtas]] on the Jordan River
* the Monastery of [[Gerasimus of the Jordan|Saint Gerasimos]] known as [[Deir Hajla]]; in the Jordan Valley near Jericho
* the [[St. George's Monastery, Wadi Qelt|Saint George Monastery]] in [[Wadi Qelt]] above Jericho.

====Archaeological tourism====
The archaeological sites in and near Jericho have a high potential for attracting tourists. These are dealt with in detail in the [[Jericho#History and archaeology|History and archaeology]] paragraph:
* the Stone, Bronze and Iron Age cities at '''Tell es-Sultan'''
* the [[Hasmonean royal winter palaces|Hasmonean and Herodian winter palaces]] at '''Tulul Abu el-'Alayiq'''
* the Byzantine-period synagogues at Jericho ([[Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue]]) and [[Naaran|Na'aran]]
* the Umayyad palace at Khirbet al-Mafjar known as [[Hisham's Palace]]
* the Crusader sugar production facility at '''Tawahin es-Sukkar''' (lit. "sugar mills")
* [[Nabi Musa]], the [[Mamluk]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] shrine dedicated to Moses ("Prophet Musa" to the Muslims)

===Agriculture===
Agriculture is another source of income, with banana groves ringing the city.&lt;ref name="jpost.com"/&gt;

The Jericho Agro-Industrial Park is a public-private enterprise being developed in the Jericho area. Agricultural processing companies are being offered financial concessions to lease plots of land in the park in a bid to boost Jericho's economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2012/jun/18/jericho-business-park-palestine-sustainability|title=Jericho business park aims to inch Palestine towards sustainability|first=Liz|last=Ford|date=18 June 2012|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools and religious institutions==
In 1925, Christian friars opened a school for 100 pupils that became the Terra Santa School. The city has 22 state schools and a number of private schools.&lt;ref name="ilsussidiario.net"/&gt;

==Health care==
In April 2010, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) held a groundbreaking ceremony for the renovation of the Jericho Governmental Hospital. USAID is providing $2.5&amp;nbsp;million in funding for this project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/pr_April_14_2010.html|title=USAID to Renovate the Jericho Governmental Hospital|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318001142/http://www.usaid.gov/wbg/pr_April_14_2010.html|archivedate=18 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
The sports team [[Hilal Areeha]] plays [[association football]] in the West Bank First Division. They play home games in the 15,000 spectator [[Jericho International Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/middle_east/countries/palestine.shtml|title=World Stadiums - Stadiums in Palestine|website=www.worldstadiums.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actress '''[[Judy Garland]]''' (1922–1969) is widely considered a [[gay icon]]. ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' has called Garland "The Elvis of homosexuals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cWMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA87#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=An icon for the ages | publisher=The Advocate | author=Walters, Barry | date=October 13, 1998 | pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons frequently given for her standing as an icon among [[gay]] men are admiration of her ability as a performer, the way her personal struggles seemed to mirror those of gay men in America during the height of her fame, and her value as a [[Camp (style)|camp]] figure.&lt;ref&gt;Dyer, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; Garland's role as [[Dorothy Gale]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' is particularly noted for contributing to this status.

==Garland as tragic figure==
The aspects of gay identification with Garland were being discussed in the mainstream as early as 1967. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, in reviewing Garland's 1967 [[Palace Theatre (New York City)|Palace Theatre]] engagement, disparagingly noted that a "disproportionate part of her nightly claque seems to be homosexual". It goes on to say that "[t]he boys in the tight trousers"&lt;ref name="Palace"&gt;{{cite news | title=Seance at the Palace |work=Time |date=1967-08-18 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,840977,00.html |accessdate=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a phrase ''Time'' repeatedly used to describe gay men, as when it described "ecstatic young men in tight trousers pranc[ing] down the aisles to toss bouquets of roses" to another gay icon, [[Marlene Dietrich]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Old Gal in Town |work=Time |date=1967-10-20 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,902142,00.html |accessdate=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; would "roll their eyes, tear at their hair and practically levitate from their seats" during Garland's performances. ''Time'' then attempted to explain Garland's appeal to the homosexual, consulting psychiatrists who opined that "the attraction [to Garland] might be made considerably stronger by the fact that she has survived so many problems; homosexuals identify with that kind of hysteria" and that "Judy was beaten up by life, embattled, and ultimately had to become more masculine. She has the power that homosexuals would like to have, and they attempt to attain it by idolizing her."&lt;ref name="Palace" /&gt;

Writer [[William Goldman]], in a piece for ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine about the same Palace engagement, again disparages the gay men in attendance, dismissing them as "[[Faggot (slang)|fags]]" who "flit by" chattering inanely. He goes on, however, to advance the tragic figure theory as well. After first suggesting that "if [homosexuals] have an enemy, it is age. And Garland is youth, perennially, over the rainbow",&lt;ref name="goldman" /&gt; he wrote:

{{quote|Homosexuals tend to identify with suffering. They are a persecuted group and they understand suffering. And so does Garland. She's been through the fire and lived&amp;nbsp;– all the drinking and divorcing, all the pills and all the men, all the poundage come and gone&amp;nbsp;– brothers and sisters, ''she knows.''&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldman |first=William |title=Judy Floats |work=Esquire |date=January 1969 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Openly gay comedian [[Bob Smith (comedian)|Bob Smith]] offers a comic take on the tragic figure theory, imagining an "Elvis king" and a "Judy queen", debating the idols:

{{poemquote|
Elvis had a drinking problem.
Judy could drink Elvis under the table.
Elvis gained more weight.
Judy lost more weight.
Elvis was addicted to painkillers.
No pill could stop Judy's pain!&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Garland as camp==
{{See also|Camp (style)}}
In discussing Judy Garland's camp appeal, gay film scholar [[Richard Dyer]] has defined camp as "a characteristically gay way of handling the values, images and products of the dominant culture through irony, exaggeration, trivialisation, theatricalisation and an ambivalent making fun of and out of the serious and respectable".&lt;ref name = dyer176&gt;Dyer, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; Garland is camp, he asserts, because she is "imitable, her appearance and gestures copiable in drag acts".&lt;ref name = dyer176 /&gt; He calls her "ordinariness" in her early [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] films camp in their "failed seriousness" and her later style "wonderfully over-the-top".&lt;ref name ="  dyer176" /&gt;

==Friend of Dorothy==
{{Main|Friend of Dorothy}}
[[File:Judy Garland in The Wizard of Oz trailer.jpg|thumb|left|[[Judy Garland]] from the trailer for the 1939 film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'']]
Other connections between Garland and [[LGBT]] people include the slang term "[[Friend of Dorothy]]", which likely derives from Garland's portrayal of [[Dorothy Gale]] in ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and became a code phrase gay people used to identify each other. Dorothy's journey from Kansas to Oz "mirrored many gay men's desires to escape the black-and-white limitations of small town life&amp;nbsp;... for big, colorful cities filled with quirky, gender-bending characters who would welcome them."&lt;ref name="Steven"&gt;{{cite news|last=Frank |first=Steven |title=What does it take to be a gay icon today? |publisher=AfterElton.com |date=2007-09-25 |url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2007/9/gayicons?page=0%2C0 |accessdate=2007-12-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210064859/http://www.afterelton.com/people/2007/9/gayicons?page=0%2C0 |archivedate=2007-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, Dorothy immediately accepts those who are different, including the Cowardly Lion (in a very camp performance by [[Bert Lahr]]).  The Lion identifies himself through song as a "sissy" and exhibits stereotypically "gay" (or at least effeminate) mannerisms. The Lion is seen as a coded example of Garland meeting and accepting a gay man without question.&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben; ''The New York Times'': Jun 28, 1994. pg. C.15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paglia, Camille. ''Judy Garland As a Force Of Nature'';  [[The New York Times]]: Jun 14, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2001 documentary ''Memories of Oz'', openly gay [[cult film]] director and social satirist [[John Waters]] spoke about seeing ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' as a child:

{{quote|[I was] the only child in the audience that always wondered why Dorothy ever wanted to go back to Kansas.  Why would she want to go back to Kansas, in this dreary black and white farm with an aunt who dressed badly and seemed mean to me, when she could live with magic shoes, winged monkeys and gay lions?  I never understood it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B000ADS64E/${0} ''Memories of Oz''] - ''The Wizard of Oz'' (3-Disc Collector's Edition DVD) 2005&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Stonewall riots==
{{Main|Stonewall riots}}
Some have suggested a connection between the date of Garland's death and funeral on June 27, 1969 and the [[Stonewall riots]], the flashpoint of the modern [[gay liberation]] movement,{{sfnm|Bianco|1999|1p=194|Duberman|1993|2p=ix}} which started in the early hours of June 28.{{sfn|Bianco|1999|p=194}}  In a 2009 interview, gay historian David Carter stated that this connection is untrue, and based on a mocking reference to the riot by an anti-gay writer in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' the next day. Some observers of the riots contend that most of those involved "were not the type to moon over Judy Garland records or attend her concerts at Carnegie Hall. They were more preoccupied with where they were going to sleep and where their next meal would come from."&lt;ref&gt;Loughery, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same historical documentary states that there were several patrons at the Stonewall bar that night, Garland fans who, according to bar patron [[Sylvia Rivera]] had come from the very emotional Garland funeral earlier in the day to drink and mourn. Rivera said that indeed there was a feeling in the air that something would happen that night: "I guess Judy Garland's death just really helped us really hit the fan."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2009/6/26/stonewall_riots_40th_anniversary_a_look "Stonewall Riots 40th Anniversary: A Look Back at the Uprising that Launched the Modern Gay Rights Movement,"] democracynow.org, June 26, 2009. Accessed November 29, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There was certainly an awareness and appreciation of Garland among [[Stonewall Inn]] patrons. Because the bar had no liquor license, it was passed off as a bottle club and patrons were required to sign in. Many used [[pseudonym]]s and "Judy Garland" was among the most popular.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the truth of the matter, the Garland/Stonewall connection has persisted and has been fictionalized in ''[[Stonewall (1995 film)|Stonewall]]'', [[Nigel Finch]]'s feature film about the events leading up to the riots. Lead character Bostonia is shown watching Garland's funeral on television and mourning, and later refusing to silence a [[jukebox]] playing a Garland song during a police raid, declaring "Judy stays."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Finch, Nigel |title=Stonewall |date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Time'' magazine would summarize decades later: 

{{quote|The uprising was inspirited by a potent cocktail of pent-up rage (raids of gay bars were brutal and routine), overwrought emotions (hours earlier, thousands had wept at the funeral of Judy Garland) and drugs. As a 17-year-old cross-dresser was being led into the paddy wagon and got a shove from a cop, she fought back. [She] hit the cop and was so stoned, she didn't know what she was doing—or didn't care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cloud |first=John |title=June 28, 1969 |work=Time |date=2003-03-31 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1004529,00.html?promoid=googlep |accessdate=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Garland's daughter [[Lorna Luft]] points to the connection with pride, saying that her mother was a "huge, huge advocate of human rights" and that Garland would have found the rioting appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harrity |first=Christopher |title=Judy's stamp of approval |work=The Advocate |date=2006-06-09 |url=http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail.asp?id=32127 |accessdate=2007-12-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921202821/http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail.asp?id=32127 |archivedate=2008-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rainbow flag==
{{Main|Rainbow flag (LGBT movement)}}
[[File:PrideFlags.JPG|thumb|Six-color rainbow gay pride flags in a parade on the anniversary of Stonewall]]
Another connection is the [[rainbow flag (LGBT movement)|rainbow flag]], symbol of the [[LGBT]] communities which may have been inspired, in part, by Garland's song "[[Over the Rainbow]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Gay Almanac'', p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Garland's performance of this song has been described as "the sound of the closet", speaking to gay men whose image "they presented in their own public lives was often at odds with a truer sense of self that mainstream society would not condone".&lt;ref name="Steven" /&gt;

==Family and friends==
Judy Garland's father and other significant people in her life were also gay.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Clarke, ''Get Happy: The Life of Judy Garland'' (Random House, 2000; {{ISBN|0-375-50378-1}}), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Gumm would apparently seduce or at least keep company with very young men or older teens, then move on when told to leave or before his activities could be discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Garland's second husband [[Vincente Minnelli]] was rumored to be a closeted bisexual,&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emanuel Levy, ''Vincente Minelli: Hollywood's Dark Dreamer''. St. Martin's Press, 2009, p. 26. {{ISBN|0-312-32925-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and her fourth husband [[Mark Herron]] had a long-lasting relationship with fellow actor [[Henry Brandon (actor)|Henry Brandon]], which was only briefly interrupted by his marriage to Garland.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn Kear, James King, ''Evelyn Brent: The Life and Films of Hollywood's Lady Crook'', McFarland, 2009, p.224&lt;/ref&gt; From the beginning of her Hollywood career, Garland liked to visit [[gay bar]]s with openly gay friends [[Roger Edens]], [[Charles Walters]] and [[George Cukor]], to the chagrin of her handlers at MGM.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, p. 130-131.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karl Wilhelm Diefenbach''' (February 21, 1851,  – December 15, 1913) was a [[List of German painters|German painter]] and [[social reformer]].

==Life==

Diefenbach was born at [[Hadamar]], then part of the [[Duchy of Nassau]].

He was a pioneer of the [[naturism|naturist]] and the [[peace movement]]s. His country [[commune]], Himmelhof, in Ober Sankt Veit near [[Vienna]] (1897–1899) was one of the models for the reform settlement ''[[Monte Verità]]'' in [[Ascona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www.gusto-graeser.info/Diefenbach/ | title=Himmelhof.

As a painter, Diefenbach was an independent representative of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]]. There has been a museum of his works in [[Certosa di San Giacomo]] on Capri since 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incampania.com/en/beniculturali.cfm?s=5&amp;Menu_ID=211&amp;Sub_ID=213&amp;Info_ID=4424 in Campania: Certosa di San Giacomo – Museo Diefenbach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713022955/http://www.incampania.com/en/beniculturali.cfm?s=5&amp;Menu_ID=211&amp;Sub_ID=213&amp;Info_ID=4424 |date=13 July 2011 }}.

Kinemastik sees itself as an art collective, founded and based in [[Malta]]. 

Over1 years of its existence, Kinemastik has hosted many filmmakers, musicians, artists and film festival organisers.

Kinemastik has hosted a number of film based workshops, guided by various professionals from all over the world.  
Some of the musicians that played at Kinemastik events were [[Patti Smith]], [[Bonnie Prince Billy]], [[Owen Pallett]], Dark Horses etc.

Kinemastik Film Club holds screenings every Wednesday in [[Valletta]]. It was designed as a source for non-mainstream and off-beat movies, a step away from the pervasive and easily available [[Hollywood]] [[mainstream]] movies.  Kinemastik invites various individuals from all sorts of backgrounds to program a month of films for the Kinemastik Film Club.

Kinemastik collaborates with many film festivals such as [[Milano Film Festival]], [[Next Film Festival]], [[Cosmic Zoom]], [[Clermond Ferrand Film Fest]], [[London Short Film Festival]] and many others.

[[Steph Von Reiswitz]] and [[Chris Bianchi]] from the London-based [[Le Gun]] collective oversee Kinemastik's artwork

'''Koobi Fora''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|uː|b|i|_|ˈ|f|ɔː|r|ə}} refers primarily to a region around '''Koobi Fora Ridge''', located on the eastern shore of [[Lake Turkana]] in the territory of the nomadic [[Gabbra people]]. According to the [[National Museums of Kenya]], the name comes from the [[Borana language|Gabbra language]]:
{{bquote|In the language of the Gabbra people who live near the site, the term Koobi Fora means a place of the [[commiphora]] and the source of [[myrrh]]...&lt;ref name=HistoricalBackground&gt;{{citation|title=Koobi Fora: Historical Background|url=http://www.museums.or.ke/content/view/24/9/|publisher=National Museums of Kenya|accessdate=30 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720025116/http://www.museums.or.ke/content/view/24/9/|archivedate=20 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ridge itself is an outcrop of mainly Pliocene/Pleistocene sediments. It is composed of claystones, siltstones, and sandstones that preserve numerous fossils of terrestrial mammals, including early [[hominin]] species. Presently, the ridge is being eroded into a [[badlands]] terrain by a series of ephemeral rivers that drain into the northeast portion of modern Lake Turkana. In 1968 [[Richard Leakey]] established the '''Koobi Fora Base Camp''' on a large sandspit projecting into the lake near the ridge, which he called the '''Koobi Fora Spit'''.

A subsequent survey and numerous excavations at multiple sites established the region as a source of [[hominin]] fossils shedding light on the evolution of man over the previous 4.2 million years. Far exceeding the number of hominin fossils are the non-hominin fossils which give a detailed view of the [[fauna]] and [[flora]] as far back as the [[Miocene]].

Consequently, the government of [[Kenya]] in 1973 reserved the region as [[Sibiloi National Park]], establishing a headquarters for the [[National Museums of Kenya]] on Koobi Fora Spit. The reserve is well-maintained and is well-guarded by friendly but armed park police. Protection of sites and especially of wildlife are of prime concern. Exploration and excavation continue under the auspices of the '''Koobi Fora Research Project''' (KFRP), which collaborates with a number of interested universities and individuals across the world.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, refer to the [http://www.kfrp.com/ KFRP Journal] site currently being maintained by [[Louise Leakey]]. One notable collaboration is the [http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~kffs/HTML/KoobiForaFS14_2_06.pdf Koobi Fora Field School] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328032121/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~kffs/HTML/KoobiForaFS14_2_06.pdf |date=28 March 2007 }} conducted yearly by Rutgers University, which combines education and research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly the term Koobi Fora has been used to mean one or two initial sites, or the sand spit. Today it can mean any or all points in Sibiloi National Park. The term '''East Turkana''' also has come into use with the larger meaning.&lt;ref&gt;A nice [http://jwest.web.wesleyan.edu/research/kfmap.html map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829080554/http://jwest.web.wesleyan.edu/research/kfmap.html |date=29 August 2006 }} can be found at the Wesleyan site.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological sites and artifacts==

===Archaeological sites===
The simple hierarchy of scientific places for Koobi Fora is the following:  Koobi Fora is the region; the region is divided into fossil collecting areas (e.g., Area 102, 103, 140, etc.); within fossil collection areas there are archaeological sites (e.g., FxJj 1, FxJj 10, etc.) and hominin palaeontological localities, which are usually named after the National Museum of Kenya accession number assigned to the important bones found.  For example, in Area 131 hominin skull KNM-ER 1470 was found. The fossils found here, including all the non-human ones, are assigned to the 1470 locality.

Locating and referencing the hundreds of sites in the Koobi Fora region has been an ongoing process. The entire reservation was divided into somewhat over 100 numbered areas. When there were only a relatively few sites it sufficed to locate them with pinpricks on aerial photos and reference them by stating the area. The archaeologists, such as [[Glynn Isaac]], developed a co-ordinate system. A site acquired a tag consisting of a 4-letter co-ordinate identifier, such as FxJj, which refers to a small section at the intersection of x and j within a larger section at the intersection of F and J, followed by the number of the site: FxJj 82 refers to the 82nd site within FxJj.&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.nmnh.si.edu/naa/fa/isaac1.htm#series papers of Glynn Isaacs]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070119080902/http://www.nmnh.si.edu/naa/fa/isaac1.htm |date=19 January 2007 }} show his extensive reliance on this system, which is still in use today.&lt;/ref&gt; In the year 2000 the KFRP went over to a [[GPS]] system and has been trying to correlate the pinpricks to its data.&lt;ref name=Jablonski2004&gt;{{citation|author=Jablonski, Nina|year=2004|title=Putting Technology to Work at Koobi Fora (Special report)|work=KFRP Field Season Dispatches: Special report|publisher=Koobi Fora Research Project|url=http://www.kfrp.com/dispatches_2004/gis_jablonski/gis_jablonski.htm|accessdate=30 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516134308/http://www.kfrp.com/dispatches_2004/gis_jablonski/gis_jablonski.htm|archivedate=16 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Koobi Fora Museum.jpg|thumb|National Museums of Kenya's Koobi Fora Museum, Sibiloi National Park.]]
Fossils are labelled with a KNM (Kenya National Museums) accession number, assigned on no other basis than the order in which it was assigned. The number may be preceded in scholarly literature by KNM, KNM ET or KNM ER, where ET and ER stand for East Turkana and East Rudolf, respectively, or just plain ER. Some notable areas are as follows.

*Area 105 
The first archaeological site, i.e., FxJj 1, was found in Area 105. It is nicknamed the KBS site for Kay Behrensmeyer Site, after [[Kay Behrensmeyer]], the researcher who first found stone tools there. This site is also the place where the first tuff was found, i.e., the KBS Tuff.

*Area 131
Known as the location of Skull 1470, which was discovered by [[Bernard Ngeneo]] in 1972, reconstructed by [[Meave Leakey]], and later reconstructed and named ''[[Homo habilis]]'' by [[Richard Leakey]] as possibly the first of the genus ''Homo''. Then ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'' was found by Richard Leakey below the 1.89 million year old KBS tuff; thus, it is older than that date, but is conventionally dated to it.&lt;ref&gt;Establishing the date and the species was difficult. Accordingly, Leakey and Lewin (''People of the Lake'', Chapter 2) refer to Skull 1470 as "... the famous—some say infamous—skull ...."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hominin fossils===
Searching for and finding fossils in such a large area is another difficult problem. One solution has been to organise all persons present into a group to sweep a designated area. Richard Leakey devised a method that produced better results: he organised and trained a search team of Kenyans, which became known as "the ''hominid'' gang", under the leadership of [[Kamoya Kimeu]]—"hominid" was then the term use for the present-day meaning of "hominin". They found the majority of the 200-plus hominin fossils discovered to date.

Koobi Fora is perhaps best known for its specimens of the [[genus]] ''[[Homo (genus)|Homo]]'', but those of the genus ''[[Australopithecus]]'' also have been found. The following [[species]] are represented:&lt;ref&gt;Much of the literature on the subject since 1991 refers to some pseudo-taxa created by Wood: Homo sp. indet. is "Homo, species indeterminate"; Homo gen. et spec. indet. is "Homo, genus and species indeterminate"; Homo aff. H. erectus is "Homo with affinities to Homo erectus"; H. erectus sensu stricto is "Homo erectus in the strict sense." The subject has moved on since Wood; for example, "Hominids" are now "Hominins." For a review of the book in some detail, see the ''[http://www.anthro.ucdavis.edu/faculty/mchenry/AJPA89.pdf Book Reviews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624164603/http://www.anthro.ucdavis.edu/faculty/mchenry/AJPA89.pdf |date=24 June 2006 }}'' section of the ''American Journal of Physical Anthropology'' S9:499–504 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
|}

''Australopithecus'' and ''Homo'' seem to have coexisted in African regions for several hundred thousand years. One possible explanation is different food sources.&lt;ref&gt;''People of the Lake'' Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the Australopithecus genus evolved in eastern Africa around 4 million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct somewhat after 2 million years ago.

===Stone tools===
Large quantities of stone tools have been found at Koobi Fora both on the surface and in caches, which have dates of their own, but are seldom in association with hominins. No other candidates for their manufacture have been found, however. The tools are [[Olduwan]] and [[Acheulean]]. The Koobi Fora community has devised the following teminology&lt;ref&gt;The tools and classifications are well described in a number of pages at [http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/origins/koobi/koobi5.html KOOBI FORA ARCHAEOLOGY], which is being maintained at the Maricopa Community Colleges site.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe three local industries:

The initial archaeology, experimental archaeology, and scientific analysis of the tools were performed by J. W. K. Harris, Nicholas Toth and Glynn Isaac. Harris and Braun report their line of investigation:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.raco.cat/index.php/TreballsArqueologia/article/viewFile/29347/29186 Technological Developments in the Oldowan of Koobi Fora: Innovative Techniques of Artifact Analysis]'', David R. Braun, Jack W.K. Harris, in ''TREBALLS D'ARQUEOLOGIA'', 9, Centre d'Estudis del Patrimoni Arqueològic
de la Prehistòria, Autonomous University of Barcelona. The summary below is based on it and the quoted phrases come from it.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{bquote|''Hominid'' technology represents a conduit between the ''hominid'' and access to resources such as meat and marrow.}}

According to the analysis, the conduit became more efficient between KBS and Karari Olduwan; that is, hominins obtained more of a return for a given output of energy and could do more. The chief technological development was the edge. The KBS utilised ".977 cm of edge per gram of mass", but the Karari utilised "2.4&amp;nbsp;cm of edge", etc., an advantage obtained through a "core reduction strategy"; that is, more and thinner flakes per mass of cores. This "flake production model" made possible a better "flake utility model." More and better flakes meant better utilisation of carcasses and therefore a need for fewer carcasses, less hunting, etc. Moreover, the increased number of flakes available made ranging farther from the source of the stone possible and endowed more staying power to the hunt.

==Stratigraphy==
Koobi Fora encompasses a small [[depocenter]], underlain by [[Pliocene]] [[basalt]]s and filled with nearly 600 meters of Pliocene-[[Pleistocene]] [[sediment]]s, dating from about four-million to one-million years ago. These sediments are attributed to the Koobi Fora Formation, which consists of eight members that are delimited by water-lain [[tuff]]s (volcanic ash).&lt;ref&gt;The system is as follows. One "member" is all the layers between two tuffs, or layers of volcanic ash. The member is named from the bottom tuff, considered to begin it. The tuffs are dated. Obviously, a fossil or artifact is dated by the member in which it was found. A complete presentation of the members and their names with dates and a diagram can be found at [http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/dept/d10/asb/origins/koobi/koobi3.html STRATIGRAPHY OF KOOBI FORA] and therefore that information is not repeated here.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early human fossils and archaeological remains derive from the upper portion of the Burgi Member, the KBS Member, and the Okote Member. The members reflect changing environments in the Turkana Basin, from lake and delta ones during Burgi Member times to rivers and floodplains in Okote Member times.

The stratigraphy of the Koobi Fora Formation is one of the best studied and calibrated in East Africa, with publication of some extensive listings at various times.&lt;ref name=Feibeletal1989&gt;{{citation|last=Feibel|first=Craig S|last2=Brown|first2=Francis H|last3=McDougall|first3=Ian|year=1989|title=Stratigraphic Context of Fossil Hominids from the Omo Group deposits: Northern Turkana Basin, Kenya and Ethiopia|journal=[[American Journal of Physical Anthropology]]|volume=78|issue=4|pages=595–622 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/110516737/abstract|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330780412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDougall|first=I.|last2=Brown|first2=F.

In addition, the unique fusion between [[geochronology]] and [[mammal]] [[evolution]]ary studies has made the Koobi Fora Formation a standard for interpreting biochronology, environmental change, and ecology for all of Pliocene-Pleistocene Africa.

'''Kubuli''' is a golden [[lager]] brewed in [[Dominica]], where it is the unofficial national [[beer]].

"'''Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!'''", also known as "'''Let It Snow'''", is a song written by lyricist [[Sammy Cahn]] and composer [[Jule Styne]] in July 1945. It was written in [[Hollywood, California]] during a heat wave as Cahn and Styne imagined cooler conditions.&lt;ref name=pc3a&gt;{{Pop Chronicles 40s|3|A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the song's lyrics make no mention of Christmas, it is played on radio stations during the Christmas season and is often covered by various artists on Christmas-themed albums. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], however, it can be played during winter (June, July, August) and in New Zealand, some play it at [[Matariki]].

==Recording history==
{{prose|date=December 2013}}
First recorded for [[RCA Victor]] in 1945 by [[Vaughn Monroe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Collins |first=Ace |authorlink= |title=Stories Behind the Greatest Hits of Christmas |url=https://books.google.com/?id=4a6oMgT8UsEC&amp;pg=PT54 |accessdate=July 9, 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=Zondervan |location= |isbn=0310327954 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it became a popular hit, reaching No. 1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] Best Sellers music chart in late January and through February 1946.  [[Woody Herman]]'s competing recording, featuring himself on vocals and a notable trumpet solo by [[Sonny Berman]], peaked at No. 7 on the ''Billboard'' chart, while [[Connee Boswell]] reached No. 9 with her rendition.

Other notable recordings:

*2012 – [[Rod Stewart]], on his album ''[[Merry Christmas, Baby (album)|Merry Christmas, Baby]]''.

Internacionalni teatarski festival MESS|publisher=klix.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The festival was founded in 1960 under the name ''Festival malih i eksperimentalnih scena Jugoslavije'' (Festival of small and experimental scenes of Yugoslavia). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mess.ba/2016/arhiva/historijat|title=History|publisher=Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded on the initiative of Yugoslavian theatre director, Jurislav Korenić. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwcmostar.ba/living/what-to-do/region/|title=What to do in the region|publisher=uwcmostar.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally conceived as an annual gathering of the country's professional theatre companies with the goal of presenting the best experimental theatre pieces of the previous year. The specificity of the concept quickly garnered a wider audience and secured visits from international experimental theatre companies, such as [[Living Theater]] from New York City, that named the festival one of its four major annual show-piece platforms. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkans.aljazeera.net/vijesti/mess-simptom-ceznje-za-slobodom|title=MESS - simptom čežnje za slobodom|publisher=Al Jazeera Balkans}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With the start of the [[Bosnian war]] in 1992 the festival's run was halted, only for it to be renamed and rebranded by a directorate of Bosnian artists and intellectuals, headed by theatre director [[Haris Pašović]], with the desire to artistically resist the [[Siege of Sarajevo]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oslobodjenje.ba/o2/kultura/pozoriste/57-mess-istina-je-univerzalna-inace-gubi-vrijednost|title=57. MESS: Istina je univerzalna inače gubi vrijednost|publisher=Oslobođenje}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the festival organized the first edition of the [[Sarajevo Film Festival]] in 1993 under the working title ''Poslije kraja svijeta'' (After the end of the world). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historija.ba/d/44-odrzan-prvi-sarajevo-film-festival/|title=Održan prvi "Sarajevo Film Festival"|publisher=historija.ba}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During this period in time the festival produced numerous pieces by theatre directors such as [[Susan Sontag]] and [[Peter Schumann]], who entered the besieged city to take part in the artistic resistance against the war. With the signing of the [[Dayton Peace Accords]] the festival was taken over by a team of young theatre professionals headed by newly-named manager [[Dino Mustafić]]. The first post-war edition of the festival hosted directors such as [[Giorgio Strehler]], [[Frank Castorf]] and Peter Schumann. 

In 2008 the festival changed its original format by introducing a handful of new programs. The ''Mittel Europe MESS'' program is designed to showcase the most interesting theatre pieces from the Former Yugoslavia and the wider South-Eastern European region. The ''World MESS'' program hosts pieces from Africa, Asia and Latin America, while the ''Future MESS'' program cultivates the original concept of the festival by showcasing the most experimental and subversive productions from across the globe. Furthermore, a children's program has also been established under the name ''Children MESS''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mess.ba/2016/arhiva/historijat|title=Festival program|publisher=Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Theatre directors that have taken part in the festival include: [[Peter Brook]], [[Giorgio Strehler]], [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]], [[Peter Schumann]], [[Eugenio Barba]], [[Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker]], [[Eimuntas Nekrošius]], [[Alvis Hermanis]], [[Olivier Py]], Mark Tompkins, [[Wlodzimierz Staniewski]], [[Simon McBurney]], [[Christoph Marthaler]], [[Frank Castorf]], [[Thomas Ostermeier]], [[Andriy Zholdak]], [[Rimas Tuminas]], [[Emma Dante]], [[Rodrigo García (director)|Rodrigo Garcia]], [[Heiner Goebbels]] [[Romeo Castellucci]], [[Wim Vandekeybus]], [[Forced Entertainment]], [[Laert Vasili]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mess.ba/2016/arhiva/historijat|title=Visiting companies and directors|publisher=Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memory Modul==
The Memory Modul is a cultural project initiated by the festival in 1995 with the goal of preserving the memory of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkans.aljazeera.net/blog/izlozbom-rona-haviva-pocinje-modul-memorije-2018|title=Izložbom Rona Haviva počinje Modul Memorije 2018.|publisher=Al Jazeera Balkans}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project has worked to keep hundreds of documents, photographs and videos from being forgotten and has offered audiences new and creative works which are related to the Bosnian war as well as other armed conflicts across the world. Furthermore, the Memory Modul has produced a handful of documentary films, including ''Greta'' by Haris Pašović, which documented the life of [[Greta Ferušić]], a retired professor of architecture at the [[University of Sarajevo]] and survivor of [[Auschwitz]] and the Siege of Sarajevo. &lt;ref name="2sfjff"&gt;[http://sfjff36.jfi.org/films/detail/greta-ferusic/ Greta Ferusic].

A '''miracle of the roses''' is a [[miracle]] in which [[rose]]s manifest an activity of [[God in Christianity|God]] or of a [[saint]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafaye|first=Jacques|year=1987|title=Quetzalcoatl and Guadaloupe: The Formation of Mexican National Consciousness, 1531-1813|pages=55|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]|isbn=0-521-42018-0|accessdate=11 December 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWJJua4aoGcC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a miracle is presented in various [[hagiography|hagiographies]] and [[legend]]s in different forms,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klaniczay|first=Gábor|year=2002|title=Holy Rulers and Blessed Princesses: Dynastic Cults in Medieval Central Europe|page=422|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0-521-42018-0|accessdate=11 December 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tz12J0Eb9eUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA422&amp;dq=%22Miracle+of+the+roses%22+%22hagiography%22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it occurs in connection with diverse individuals such as Saints [[Elizabeth of Hungary]] (1207–1231), [[Elizabeth of Portugal]] (1271–1336), St. Dorothy, a 4th-century virgin martyr at Caesarea in Cappadocia (died ca. 311), and [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] (appeared in 1531).

==Symbolism of the rose==
[[File:Niccolo Betti San Diego de Alcalá Descalzas Reales - Adobe Reader.jpg|thumb|Niccolo Betti San Diego de Alcalá Descalzas Reales]]
In the Latin West the symbolism of the rose is of Greco-Roman heritage but influenced by and finally transformed through Latin biblical and liturgical texts. In Greco-Roman culture the rose's symbolic qualities represented beauty, the season of spring, and love.  It also spoke of the fleetness of life, and therefore of death.  In Rome the feast called "[[Rosalia (festival)|Rosalia]]" was a feast of the dead: thus the flower referred to the next world.&lt;ref name=koehler&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/rosarymarkings36.html Koehler, S.M., Rev. Theodore A., "The Christian Symbolism of the Rose"], ''Roses and the Arts: A Cultural and Horticultural Engagement'', Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio, May 8, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

This symbolism attained a deeper complexity when contrasted with the rose's thorns.  This contrast inspired the Christian Latin poet [[Coelius Sedulius]], who wrote (between 430-450) a very elaborate comparison between [[Eve]], our first mother, and [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus]] our Savior. He illustrated the parallelism already made by [[Justin Martyr]] (around 150) and developed it in a deep poetic and doctrinal liturgical teaching in his Easter song, ''Carmen paschal''.&lt;ref name=koehler/&gt;
[[File:Elisabeth roses.jpg|thumb|140px|left|&lt;center&gt;''St. Elisabeth of Thuringia, Miracle of the roses''&lt;/center&gt;]]
The rose was a privileged symbol for Mary, Queen of heaven and earth.  We see this development later during the Middle Ages, when the rose became an attribute of many other holy women, including [[Elizabeth of Hungary]], [[Elizabeth of Portugal]], [[Casilda of Toledo]], and for the [[martyr]]s in general.  The rose is even a symbol for Christ himself, as seen in the German Christmas song, "es ist ein 'Rose' entsprungen."&lt;ref name=koehler/&gt;

During the Middle Ages the rose was cultivated in monastery gardens and used for medicinal purposes. It became a symbol in religious writing and iconography in different images and settings, to invoke a variety of intellectual and emotional responses.&lt;ref name=carleton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carleton|first=Sarah|title=A rose is a rose is a rose:The Rose as Symbol in the Ars antiqua Motet|journal=Discourses in Music|date=Spring 2004|volume=5|issue=1|url=http://www.discourses.ca/v5n1a1.html|accessdate=15 December 2012|publisher=Univ. of Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mystic rose appears in Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', where it represents God's love. By the twelfth century, the red rose had come to represent [[Passion (Christianity)|Christ's passion]], and the blood of the martyrs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | last = Wilson  | first = Jean C.  | title = Excavating the Medieval Image: Manuscripts, Artists, Audiences; Essays in Honor of Sandra Hindman  | chapter = 'Richement et pompeusement parée': the ''collier'' of Margaret of York and the politics of love in late medieval Burgundy  | publisher = Ashgate  | year = 2004  | pages = 109–134  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=dez8trnjfbUC  | isbn = 978-0-7546-3143-9}} 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common association of the rose is with the Virgin Mary. The third-century [[Saint Ambrose]] believed that there were roses in the Garden of Eden, initially without thorns, but which became thorny after the fall, and came to symbolize [[Original Sin]] itself. Thus the Blessed Virgin is often referred to as the 'rose without thorns', since she was immaculately conceived. Saint [[Bernard of Clairvaux ]] compared her virginity to a white rose and her charity to a red rose. With the rise of Marian devotion and the [[Gothic cathedral]] in the twelfth century, the image of the rose became even more prominent in religious life. Cathedrals built around this time usually include a [[rose window]], dedicated to the Virgin, at the end of a transept or above the entrance. The thirteenth century [[Saint Dominic]] is credited with the institution of the [[Rosary]], a series of prayers to the Virgin, symbolized by garlands of roses worn in Heaven.&lt;ref name=carleton/&gt;

==Saint Elizabeth of Hungary==
[[File:Pietro Nelli - Elizabeth van Hongarije.JPG|thumb|upright|Elisabeth of Hungary with roses]]
In Western Europe, the best-known version of a miracle of the roses concerns Saint Elizabeth of Hungary (also called Elisabeth of Thuringia), the daughter of King [[Andrew II of Hungary]], who spent most of her life living with her in-laws in Germany (a ruling family of [[List of rulers of Thuringia|Thuringia]]), who kept court at [[Wartburg Castle]].&lt;ref name="reber"/&gt;

===Origins===
It has been suggested that the legend originated in a sermon given by [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] in which he reflects on the occasion of the [[Translation (relics)|translation]] of the remains of Saint Elizabeth, in 1236. Caesarius speaks of a sweet aroma that emanates from the grave as soon as it is opened (a common theme in [[hagiography]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maresch|first=Maria|title=Elisabeth von Thüringen: Schutzfrau des deutschen Volkes|place=Bonn|publisher=Verlag der Buchgemeinde|year=1931|page=220|isbn=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This metaphorical or actual aroma could have been translated into a physical event, the miracle of the roses.&lt;ref name="reber"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reber|first=Ortrud|title=Die heilige Elisabeth: Leben und Legende|place=St. Ottilien|year=1982|ref=Reber1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first report of a miracle resembling that of the roses is by [[Franciscan]]s in the mid-13th century. Their account is of spring flowers, and the event takes place in [[Hungary]], at Elizabeth's home when she was five years old.&lt;ref name="Hohberg72"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hohberg|first=Rainer|last2=Weigelt|first2=Sylvia|title=Brot und Rosen: Das Leben der heiligen Elisabeth in Sagen und Legenden|place=Wartburg|publisher=Wartburg Verlag|year=2006|ref=Hohberg2006|isbn=978-3-86160-183-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The miracle as we know it, with roses and in Germany, is first reported in 1332, in a Franciscan book of prayers,&lt;ref name="reber"/&gt; though it has also been proposed that the miracle was "translated" from Elizabeth of Portugal to Elisabeth of Hungary in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pörnbacher|first=Hans|year=2003|title=Die hl.

===The legend===
In its most characteristic form the legend goes as follows. One day the young but pious Elizabeth, in the company of one or more serving women, descends from [[Wartburg Castle]] down to the village of [[Eisenach]], below the castle. She is carrying meat, eggs, and bread under her mantle. Supposedly she has taken items from the family dining table to distribute to the poor in the village, against the wishes of her family, who frown upon such behavior. Halfway down, she unexpectedly meets her husband [[Ludwig IV of Thuringia]], who asks, upon seeing her bulk, what she is carrying. Embarrassed and speechless as she is, she does not know what to say. Ludwig opens her mantle, and to his surprise (in some versions this takes place in the dead of winter) finds her carrying a bouquet of roses.&lt;ref name="Hohberg72"/&gt;

====Saint Elizabeth of Portugal====
Very much the same story is told of [[Elizabeth of Portugal]], also known as Elizabeth of Aragon (1271–4 July 1336), who was the great-niece of Elizabeth of Hungary. Married to the profligate King [[Denis of Portugal]], she, like her great-aunt, showed great devotion at an early age, and likewise was charitable toward the poor, against the wishes of her husband. Caught one day by her husband, while carrying bread in her apron, the food was turned into roses. Since this occurred in January, King Denis reportedly had no response and let his wife continue. The story is somewhat apocryphal; while it shows up in popular versions of the saint's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The story of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] is of an entirely different character, although here again the miraculous presence of the roses in the middle of winter is a sign of the presence of the divinity.

&lt;/ref&gt; It concerns a native inhabitant of [[Mexico]] named [[Juan Diego]], whom the Virgin chooses to convey a message to an unwilling bishop, that "Here I will hear their weeping, their sorrow and will remedy and alleviate all their multiple sufferings, necessities and misfortunes." The bishop however, does not believe Diego's story. He returns to his field, where again the Virgin appears to him, with the same message. Diego again goes to the bishop, with the same result, and the remark that he has to bring a token if he is to be believed. The fourth time the Virgin appears, she directs Diego toward "varied Castilian flowers" which he picks; she then places the flowers in his mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Saint Rita of Cascia ==
[[File:Rapallo-chiesa san Francesco-dipinto4.jpg|thumb|140px|left|&lt;center&gt;St. Rita of Cascia&lt;/center&gt;]]
A miracle involving roses occurred to Saint [[Rita of Cascia]]. The winter before the end of her life, a cousin visited her and asked her if she desired anything from her old home at Roccaporena. Saint Rita responded by asking for a rose and a fig from the garden. It was January and her cousin did not expect to find anything due to the snowy weather. However, when her relative went to the house, a single blooming rose was found in the garden, as well as a fully ripened and edible fig. Her cousin brought the rose and fig back to Saint Rita at the convent, who thanked her and gave the rose to her sisters.

The rose is thought to represent God's love for Rita and Rita's ability to intercede on behalf of lost causes or impossible cases. Rita is often depicted holding roses or with roses nearby, and on her feast day, churches and shrines of Saint Rita provide roses to the congregation that are blessed by priests during [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].

=== Statement of Pope John Paul II ===
On the occasion of the centenary of the canonization of Saint Rita of Cascia, Pope John Paul II stated that the worldwide devotion to Saint Rita is symbolized by the rose, and said: "It is to be hoped that the life of everyone devoted to her will be like the rose picked in the garden of Roccaporena the winter before the saint's death. That is, let it be a life sustained by passionate love for the Lord Jesus; a life capable of responding to suffering and to thorns with forgiveness and the total gift of self, in order to spread everywhere the good odour of Christ (cf. {{bibleverse|2|Cor|2:15|ESV}}) through a consistently lived proclamation of the Gospel."  He added that Saint Rita spiritually offers her rose to each of those he addressed as an exhortation to "live as witnesses to a hope that never disappoints and as missionaries of a life that conquers death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2000/apr-jun/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20000520_santa-rita_en.html |title= Address of Holy Father John Paul II on the centenary of St. Rita's canonization. |date= 20 May 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Muzo people''' were a [[Cariban languages|Cariban]]-speaking&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.absolut-colombia.com/culturas-prehispanicas-de-colombia/ Culturas prehispánicas de Colombia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tequia_p25/&gt;&lt;ref name=Indios/&gt; indigenous group who inhabited the western slopes of the eastern [[Colombia]]n [[Andes]]. They were a highly war-like tribe who frequently clashed with their neighbouring indigenous groups, especially the [[Muisca people|Muisca]]. It is said they performed [[cannibalism]] on their conquered neighbours.

The Muzo inhabited the right banks of the [[Magdalena River]] in the lower altitudes of western [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] and [[Cundinamarca Department|Cundinamarca]] and were known as the Emerald People, thanks to their exploitation of the gemstone in Muzo. During the time of [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|conquest]], they resisted heavily against the Spanish invaders taking twenty years to submit the Muzo.

Knowledge about the Muzo people has been provided by [[List of Muisca scholars|chroniclers]] [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]], [[Pedro Simón]], [[Juan de Castellanos]], [[Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita]] and others.

== Description ==
[[File:Topaipí A. Lugo (91).jpg|right|thumb|330px|The Muzo settled close to springs and waterfalls, here in '''Topaipí''']]
The Muzo were a people of healthy warriors with relatively short lifespans. Their health is attributed to the fact they were vegetarian, although other sources state they performed cannibalism.&lt;ref name=BoyacaCultural/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henao_p126/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tequia_p28&gt;Tequia Porras, 2008, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; The living spaces were always constructed in the vicinity of waterfalls or springs. The hotter climate of the lower terrain made them sweat and they bathed often. Many Muzo children were born covered with bristle hair which made the superstitious mothers kill their babies.&lt;ref name=Sinic/&gt; The Muzo people lived naked and gave their children names of trees, animals and plants.&lt;ref name=Henao_p126/&gt;

The Muzo people performed [[Muisca agriculture|agriculture]], wood-working and produced [[ceramic]]s. The elaboration of cloths using [[cotton]] or [[pita]] was done by the prostitutes of the Muzo.&lt;ref name=Sinic/&gt; They were most known for their exploitation of [[emerald]]s; until modern times Muzo is the world capital of the green gemstone.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The Muzo society was divided in warriors, higher castes and ''chingamanas'' or ''chingamas''; slaves, commonly captured from other indigenous tribes. The oldest and bravest members of the community were considered the most important but were not ''[[cacique]]s'' of their tribe.&lt;ref name=Henao_p126&gt;Henao &amp; Arrubla, 1820, p.126&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tequia_p26&gt;Tequia Porras, 2008, p.26&lt;/ref&gt; A system of laws has not been noted.&lt;ref name=Sinic/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henao_p126/&gt; Warfare and hunting was executed using [[poisoned arrow]]s, as was a common practice with indigenous tribes in South America. The [[curare]] was obtained from poisonous plants and [[List of poisonous animals#Frogs and toads|frogs]].&lt;ref name=Indios&gt;{{es}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20130425081104/http://pwp.supercabletv.net.co/garcru/colombia/Colombia/indios.html Indios de Colombia]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religion ===
The religion of the Muzo consisted of few gods. Their creator god was called ''Are'' (he had a [[Muisca religion|Muiscan]] counterpart called [[Chiminigagua]]). ''Maquipa'' was the deity who cured illnesses and the Muzo adored the Sun and the Moon.&lt;ref name=Sinic/&gt; The Muzo people did not construct temples.&lt;ref name=Henao_p126/&gt;

==== Furatena ====
[[File:FURAYTENA.JPG|right|thumb|330px|The sacred mountain peaks ''Fura'' and ''Tena'']]
[[File:Pedro de Ursua.jpg|right|thumb|330px|Conquistador '''Pedro de Ursúa''', noted for his failure in suppressing the Muzo in 1552]]
The two mountain peaks ''Fura'' and ''Tena'', bordering the Carare River, were considered sacred by the Muzo people and believed they were the parents of humanity, creation of ''Are''.&lt;ref name=Genesis&gt;{{es}} [http://debreves.blogspot.com.co/2010/06/el-genesis-entre-los-muzos.html El génesis entre los muzos]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fura'' and ''Tena'' taught the Muzo agricultural techniques, the craft work and tactics of war. The myth of Furatena tells about a man with blue eyes and blonde beard, ''Zarbi'', who entered the Muzo territories looking for the [[fountain of youth]]. On this journey, he met the beautiful ''Fura'' and they got together. The husband of ''Fura'', ''Tena,'' was outraged, killed ''Zarbi'' and hang his body on the Fura mountain. After this cruel act he killed ''Fura'' and committed suicide, giving birth to the two pointing hills. According to the Muzo legends, the tears of ''Fura'' turned into emeralds and [[butterfly|butterflies]].&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p95&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, p.95&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muisca performed secret pilgrimages to ''Fura'' and ''Tena'', avoiding the Muzo warriors to discover them. In his work ''Compendio historial de la conquista del Nuevo Reino de Granada'', [[Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita]] tells about the existence of a ''[[cacique|cacica]]'' named ''Furatena''. ''Furatena'' was the owner of the finest emeralds of the Muzo territories and in the early years of the Spanish conquest, ''zipa'' [[Sagipa]] wanted to see ''Furatena''.&lt;ref name=Ocampo_p98&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The emerald people ===
The first time the presence of emeralds in present-day Colombia was known to the Spanish was in 1514 in [[Santa Marta]]. During the campaign of [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] the earliest contact with emeralds from the [[Cordillera Oriental (Colombia)|Eastern Ranges]] was made in 1537 in [[Chivor]] by [[Pedro Hernández de Valenzuela (conquistador)|Pedro Hernández de Valenzuela]] and [[Antonio Díaz de Cardoso]]. During the years of the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca]], the explorers heard about the emeralds from Muzo.&lt;ref name=Puche_p99&gt;Puche Riart, 1996, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; In 1544 Diego Martínez discovered the mines of Muzo.&lt;ref&gt;Uribe, 1960, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the accounts on the exploitation of minerals [[silver]], [[copper]], [[iron]] and [[gold]] vary, the chroniclers agree on the emeralds. To extract the emeralds from the surrounding rock, the Muzo used pointed wooden poles, called ''coa''. The veins containing the minerals were cleaned with water. After extraction, the Muzo people elaborated the minerals.&lt;ref name=Sinic/&gt;

In the years before the arrival of the Spanish, the Muzo were in conflict with the Muisca. They hid their emeralds from their eastern neighbours and ''[[zipa]]'' [[Tisquesusa]] entered the Muzo terrain, killed a leader and cut his daughters to pieces to get information as to where the emerald deposits were located.&lt;ref name=Semana&gt;{{es}} [http://www.semana.com/nacion/articulo/la-reinsercion-de-los-esmeralderos/17376-3 La reinsercíon de los esmeralderos] - [[Semana (Colombia)|Semana]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Panorámica de Muzo, Boyacá.JPG|thumb|right|330px|'''Muzo''']]
[[File:Maripi Santa Rosa.JPG|thumb|right|330px|'''Maripí''']]
It is estimated that the Muzo people pushed the Muisca who originally inhabited the lower altitude terrains eastwards into the mountains of the Eastern Ranges by 1000 AD. The religious centres of the Muisca were occupied by the Muzo.&lt;ref name=Tequia_p25&gt;Tequia Porras, 2008, p.25&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conquest ===
The Spanish colonisers had problems subjugating the Muzo in the 16th century. The Muzo resisted the Spanish forces, and the terrain full of creeks and ravines was inhospitable to the Spanish horses and the Muzo hid in the many natural forts the geography provided them.&lt;ref name=Tequia_p35&gt;Tequia Porras, 2008, p.35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Orlando/&gt; When conquistador [[Pedro de Ursúa]] founded the city of Tudela close to the Muzo territories in 1552, the Muzo people attacked and razed the newly founded settlement, driving the Spanish back.&lt;ref name=Orlando&gt;{{es}} [http://orlandomagno.blogcindario.com/2009/07/00062-tribus-indigenas-en-colombia.html Tribus Indigenas En Colombia]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[conquistador]] who subjugated the Muzo to the new rule of the [[New Kingdom of Granada]] was [[Luis Lanchero]], captain in the army of conquistador [[Nicolaus Federmann|Nicolás de Federman]].&lt;ref name=Puche_p99/&gt; His first expedition with 40 men in 1539 failed, but he succeeded in subjugating the Muzo twenty years later in 1559 or 1560,&lt;ref name=Puche_p100&gt;Puche Riart, 1996, p.100&lt;/ref&gt; when he founded ''Santísima Trinidad de los Muzos'', present-day Muzo on the remains of earlier Tudela.&lt;ref name=Puche_p100/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{es}} [http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-351164 Muzo, capital de la esmeralda y emporio agrícola y ganadero] - [[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]&lt;/ref&gt; During his second campaign, Lanchero almost lost his life after being hit by a poisoned arrow of the Muzo.&lt;ref name=Tequia_p37&gt;Tequia Porras, 2008, p.37&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''narrative environment''' is a space, whether physical or [[Virtuality|virtual]], in which stories can unfold.  A virtual [[narrative]] environment might be the narrative framework in which game play can proceed. A physical narrative environment might be an exhibition area within a museum, or a foyer of a retail space, or the public spaces around a building - anywhere in short where stories can be told in space. It is also a term coined by the [[Central Saint Martin's College of Art and Design]] program in Narrative Whitby{{what?|date=January 2014}}, where the first Narrative Environment course was introduced in 2003. It is a full-time, 2 year Masters level course leading to an MA degree in Creative Practice for Narrative Environments.

The '''Nilotic languages''' are a group of [[Eastern Sudanic languages]] spoken across a wide area between [[South Sudan]] and [[Tanzania]] by the [[Nilotic peoples]], who traditionally practice [[Pastoralism|cattle-herding]].

== Etymology ==
The word Nilotic means of or relating to the [[Nile river|Nile River]] or to the Nile region of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/nilotic|title=the definition of Nilotic|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
There are approximately 7 million current speakers of Nilotic languages. [[Nilotic peoples]], who are the native speakers of the languages, originally migrated from the upper Nile area. Nilotic language speakers live in parts of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[South Sudan]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pages.uoregon.edu/dlpayne/Nilotic/NiloticFamily.htm|title=Nilotic Family|last=Payne|first=Doris|website=pages.uoregon.edu|access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subdivisions ==
According to linguist [[Joseph Greenberg]], the language family is divided up into three subgroups:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ReZAlcV7TckC&amp;pg=PA10|title=Encyclopedia of Social and Cultural Anthropology|last=Barnard|first=Alan|last2=Spencer|first2=Jonathan|date=1996|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=|isbn=9780415099967|location=|pages=10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Eastern Nilotic languages]] such as [[Turkana language|Turkana]] and [[Maasai language|Maasai]]
*[[Southern Nilotic languages]] such as [[Kalenjin languages|Kalenjin]] and [[Datooga language|Datooga]]
*[[Western Nilotic languages]] such as [[Luo languages|Luo]] and [[Dinka language|Dinka]]

Before [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg]]'s reclassification, Nilotic was used to refer to Western Nilotic alone, with the other two being grouped as related "[[Nilo-Hamitic languages|Nilo-Hamitic]]" languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TaegVuj0bNUC&amp;pg=PA306&amp;dq=eastern+western+southern+nilotic+nilo-hamitic#v=onepage&amp;q=nilo-hamitic&amp;f=false|title=Methodology and African Prehistory|last=Ki-Zerbo|first=Joseph|date=1981|publisher=UNESCO|year=|isbn=9789231017070|location=|pages=306|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2012) treats the [[Burun languages]] as a fourth subgroup of Nilotic.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Blench (2012) [http://rogerblench.info/Language/Nilo-Saharan/General/NS%20language%20list.pdf Nilo-Saharan language list]&lt;/ref&gt; In previous classifications, the languages were included within the [[Luo languages]]. [[George Starostin|Starostin]] (2015) treats the Mabaan-Burun languages as "West Nilotic" but outside the Luo level.&lt;ref&gt;George Starostin (2015) [https://www.academia.edu/10615385/The_Eastern_Sudanic_hypothesis_tested_through_lexicostatistics_current_state_of_affairs The Eastern Sudanic hypothesis tested through lexicostatistics: current state of affairs] (Draft 1.0)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3092">'''NiTiNOL 60''', or 60 NiTiNOL, is a [[Nickel Titanium]] alloy (nominally Ni-40wt% Ti) discovered in the late 1950s by the U. S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory (hence the "NOL" portion of the name NiTiNOL).&lt;ref name="Navy"&gt;{{cite report|title=''60 NITINOL Alloys'' |publisher=U.S. Naval Ordnance Laboratory|location = White Oak, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depending upon the heat treat history, 60 NiTiNOL has the ability to exhibit either superelastic properties in the hardened state or shape memory characteristics in the softened state.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference|number=6,422,010|y=2002|m=July|d=23|inventor=Gerald J. Julien|title=Manufacturing of Nitinol parts and forms}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producing the material in any meaningful quantities, however, proved quite difficult by conventional methods and the material was largely forgotten.

The composition and processing parameters have recently been revived by [[Summit Materials]], LLC under the trademarked name SM-100.  SM-100 maintains 60 NiTiNOL's combination of superb corrosion resistance [NASA terms it "Corrosion Proof"&lt;ref name="DellaCorte 2010"&gt;DellaCorte, 2010, "Nickel-Titanium Alloys: Corrosion Proof Alloys for Space Bearing, Components and Mechanism Applications", NASA-2010-216334&lt;/ref&gt;] and equally impressive wear and erosion properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = http://www.summitmaterials.com/sm-100/bearing-components/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In bearing lifing tests conducted by NASA, SM-100 has been shown to have over twice the life of 440C stainless steel and over ten times the life of conventional titanium alloys with a significantly lower coefficient of friction.&lt;ref&gt;DellaCorte, 2009, "Intermetallic Nickel-Titanium Alloys for Oil-Lubricated Bearing Applications", NASA-2009-215646&lt;/ref&gt;  The superelastic nature of the material gives it the ability to withstand compression loading of well over {{convert|350|ksi|abbr=on}} with no permanent yielding.

==Applications==

Common applications for Nitinol 60 include:

{{Culture of Bangladesh}}
 
'''Performing arts in Bangladesh''' has a rich tradition. From ancient times, [[Jatra (Bengal)|Jatra]], [[Baul]]song, [[Gombhira]] etc. presented through singing, dancing and play-acting. Jari dance, sari dance, lathi (stick) dance, khemta dance and ghatu dance are part of jari songs, sari songs, stick plays, khemta songs and ghatu songs respectively. ''Meyeli git'', Saheli git and Hudma git reflect the hopes and desires of women. Holi git, Gazi git, Magan git, wedding songs are presented on appropriate occasions with the necessary rituals. Some songs are presented by professional singers known as gayen, bayati and gidal while others are sung by farm labourers and other workers at home and outside for relaxation and pleasure.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11589">'''Pre-assessment ''' is a test [[students]] can take before a new unit to find out what the students need more instruction on and what they may already know. Pre-assessment is a way to save teachers time within the [[classroom]] while teaching new material. It is a great way to find out more about the students, what they are interested in and how they learn best.

There are many types of best [[teaching]] [[best practice|practice]]s. One of them is pre-assessment, which helps teachers better understand their students when preparing lessons, and activities to better fit the students in the class. Pre-assessment is a test that can be administered at the beginning of the school year and before new units. The same test may also be used for the post-assessment. Pre-assessment also helps the teacher learn student's interests and individual learning styles of each student. There are many ways to differentiate instruction for students that will help students take in information in multiple ways. All this information can be organized in a way to help the students and teachers have an easier school year. It can take place at the beginning of the [[school]] year and also before each unit.

==Differentiated instruction==
{{main article|Differentiated instruction}}
Some teachers assume best practices in their classroom, include such things as students sitting on the floor, listening to music, drawing, being loud or being quiet but doing so as a class. Because these students are doing these things as a class it is not differentiated Instruction. Amy Benjamin writes differentiated instruction is a "variety of classroom practices that allow for differences in students' [[learning styles]], [[interest]]s, prior knowledge, socialization needs and comfort zones".&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Amy. 2003. Differentiated instruction: A guide for Elementary School Teachers. Larchmont, NY: Eye on Education.&lt;/ref&gt; To learn students individual needs we as teachers need to assess those students and pre-assessment can to be done at the beginning of the school year and to identify students learning modalities, interests and readiness for content.

===Modalities===
There are two types of modality theories; one is learning styles theory, the other is [[multiple intelligence]]. Learning style theory suggests that learning styles differ from student to student. A few examples of learning styles are active learners, verbal learners, and reflective learners. [[Learning styles#Criticism|Learning styles theory]] is highly criticized and lacks empirical evidence to support it. Another type of modality is multiple intelligence, which was created by [[Howard Gardner]]. He takes a physiological approach to multiple intelligence by breaking it into eight categories. These categories help teachers understand the different types of diverse learning abilities. First is logical/mathematical which means the student learns better with logic, reasoning and numbers. Verbal/ Linguistic is another way that the students' strengths are with words and language. Another type is visual/spatial in which a student would rather use graphs, charts and drawings. Students who enjoy sound, rhymes, and music are musical/rhythmical learners. Bodily/kinesthetic learners are better with their hands and have better control over their bodily motions. Another type is Naturalist/Environmental, these students are sensitive, nurturing and like to use all five sense. The seventh is interpersonal, a type of student who communicates well and can be an extrovert. Last, students who can self-reflect and are introverts they are intrapersonal learners. Multiple intelligence is a great way to separate students out and learn their best learning modality.

===Interests===
During pre-assessment, teachers have to learn about students' interests and readiness for the content in order to help motivate the students. However, students have to be the ones who motivate themselves. We as teachers have to grab their attention by utilizing what we know about their interests. Once we know the students interests we can integrate it into the lesson plans. Lynda Rice uses the example that if a student has trouble writing complete sentences use his interests to help him become motivated. A way to do that is by incorporating the students favorite things, which in this case was a superhero. The student was told to write conversation bubbles between other [[superheroes]] or even the [[villain]]s. This helped him become motivated to write complete sentences.

===Readiness for content===
The purpose of pre-assessment of readiness is to find out what the students know and don't know to help plan your lessons to your specific students each year. Every year teacher's students are different. You may not be able to teach the same units the same way because of the classes readiness. At the beginning of the year and before new units it would be best to do a pre-assessment of the students to see what they know. The teachers should also give parents an evaluation in the beginning of the year because they know their child best. Planning and preparing for a class day is difficult, having these pre-assessments done will help you spend more time teaching students what they don't know and just refreshing them on what they do already do know. For example, if you are going to be starting a new unit in math, how to add and subtract.  Just by asking the students "What does addition mean?", "What does subtraction mean" and, "Do they relate to each other?", the teacher would be able to know that the students had a good basic knowledge of the information and could start on application-based activities.
Doing pre-assessment before each unit could help teachers using their time teaching students new information and save time by not teaching them what they may already know with remediation. There are many examples of ways to determine the classes understanding of different subjects. They can be used with formative and summative assessments not just pre-assessment. Once the teacher has decided on the next unit of study they can have the students trace their hands on a piece of paper. On one hand they can write 5 things they already know about the subjects and on the other hand they can write what they wish to know about the subject. This can be done with partners or individually. Teachers can use this to plan the unit and could also use it as another activity by having the students research and answer their own questions. Teachers can also create a worksheet or use note cards to have the students do as homework to get into the classroom the next day. Just asking them "What do you know about the topic?", "Is this topic interesting to you?". Another way is to give the class a test and go over the answers with them, allowing them to correct their own test and find prior knowledge. Using end-of-unit tests can be a great thing for the students; it helps them recognize the important parts of the upcoming unit. There are many ways to find out what students know about subjects that will help you better prepare and spend time wisely within the classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Rice, L. (2013). Pre-Assessment. In Common sense assessment in the classroom (pp. 25-46). Huntington Beach, CA: Shell Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluating==
Pre-assessment should always be evaluated but never with grades (Rice, 2013). Teachers should use checkmarks, symbols and highlighter to help find where the students need the most instruction. These assessments should be used to create teachers lesson plans and help the teacher find the best approach for the new unit. The best way to assess is to use graphic organizers, which will be described greater detail below. Evaluation is an ongoing process throughout the school year. As the students learn and grow so will their knowledge and abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, T. (2002). Differentiated instruction. Wakefield, MA: National Center on.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a study done about India curriculum and that evaluated the effectiveness of pre- and post- assessment. Overall the findings showed that pre- and post assessment had a positive effect on the students learning. The student had increased their average score 11% from the pre-assessment to post. In pre-assessment they were given a subjective method of asking what they already know or do not know about the subject. They also were given an assessment that was an objective method that asked yes/no questions. For example, was the information was easy to understand, useful, and well organized.&lt;ref&gt;Jin, Byoungho, &amp; Bennur, Shubhapriya. (2012). Curriculum Internationalization Focusing on India: Pre- And Post-Assessment of Student Learning. Journal of Teaching in International Business, 23(1), 31-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizing data==
Graphic organizers may be the best way to organize the data from pre-assessment. Making a prescription for differentiation sheet is a great way to do that. It incorporates all the data into four categories, such as learning styles, multiple intelligences, interests and readiness for content. Each student would have here own sheet filled out and can be used for planning lessons throughout the year. These are great for students who are bored, or unmotivated. These sheets can also be used for creating groups for the class and finding students that may work well together. Teachers must also organize their classroom management and delivery strategies to effectively operate a classroom with differentiated instruction.

==Learning cycle==
To summarize pre-assessment is a great way to start off the school year, whether it is a test or a worksheet is up to the teacher. For starting a new unit having it be a pre-test would be in the best interest of the students and the teacher. This way the teachers can you the same test for the pre- and post-assessment. This will allow students to know what will be on the test and also allow teachers to know what they need to spend more time on. One option you may decide to add onto the pre-assessment of a new unit would be a choice of "I do not know". Showing the student that it is all right to not know the correct answer. After the pre-assessment is complete teachers need to [[evaluate]] and organize that data, and create or adjust their lesson plan. Teachers may use the pre-assessment from the beginning of the year to create groups for projects or create a new activity based on the students interests. Once the students are taught and are ready to be assessed again the teacher may make a new test or use the pre-assessment again. Pre-assessment can be used in many ways and can be effective in any classroom if used properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2798">'''Public reason''' refers to a common mode of deliberation that individuals may use for issues of public concern.  The concept implicitly excludes certain assumptions or motivations that are considered improper as a basis for public decision making, even as a person may apply them in personal decisions that do not have a significant impact on the public.  

==Immanuel Kant==
The phrase "public use of one's reason" (''Vernunft in allen Stükken öffentlichen Gebrauch'') was used by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his 1784 editorial piece responding to the question "[[What is Enlightenment?]]," where he distinguished it from private usage of reason, by which he meant reasoning offered from a specific civic office or post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kant's "What Is Enlightenment"|last=Kant|first=Immanuel|url=http://www.english.upenn.edu/~mgamer/Etexts/kant.html|work=An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?|accessdate=9 December 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125160840/http://www.english.upenn.edu/~mgamer/Etexts/kant.html|archivedate=25 November 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was developed by American philosopher [[John Rawls]] to refer to the common reason of all citizens in a [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralist]] [[society]]. Public reason giving, in the Rawlsian sense, involves justifying a particular position by way of reasons that people of different moral or political backgrounds could accept. Although in his later writings he added what is known as the proviso, meaning that non-public reasons could be given assuming that public reasons would be provided in due course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rawls|first=John|title=The Idea of Public Reason Revisited|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|year=1997|volume=64|pages=765–807|doi=10.2307/1600311}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to accomplish this, however, one must overcome what he refers to as the burdens of judgment, which can produce disagreement among reasonable citizens. These burdens include conflicting evidence, giving differing weights to considerations, conceptual indeterminacy, differing experiences and value conflicts. Private reason, by contrast, is the exercise of an individual's reason to the constrained norms and interests of some sub-set of the public as a whole (such as a business, a political party, the military or the family).

{{other uses|Quimbaya (disambiguation)}}
[[Image:Cacique Quimbaya de oro (M. América, Madrid) 01.jpg|thumb|240px| Statuette of a Quimbaya [[cacique]]]]
The '''Quimbaya civilization ''' /kɪmbaɪa/ was a [[South America]]n [[civilization]], noted for spectacular [[gold work]] characterized by technical accuracy and detailed designs.  The majority of the gold work is made in [[tumbaga]] alloy, with 30% copper, which imparts beautiful color tonalities to the pieces.

==History==
[[File:Carchi-Narino culture map.jpg|thumb|Pre-Columbian cultures of Southwestern Colombia. The Quimbaya culture is marked with number 1.]]
The Quimbaya inhabited the areas corresponding to the modern departments of [[Quindío]], [[Caldas, Antioquia|Caldas]] and [[Risaralda Department|Risaralda]] in [[Colombia]], around the valley of the [[Cauca River]]. There is no clear data about when they were initially established; the current best guess is around the 1st century BCE.

The Quimbaya people reached their zenith during the 4th to 7th century CE period known as The Quimbaya Classic.  The culture's the most emblematic piece of this culture comes from this period, a form of [[poporo]] known as the [[Poporo#Poporo Quimbaya|Poporo Quimbaya]], on exhibit at the [[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Bogotá Gold Museum]]. The most frequent designs in the art pieces are [[anthropomorphic]], depicting men and women sitting with closed eyes and placid expression, as well as many fruits and forms of [[poporo]]s.

Most of the retrieved items are part of funeral offerings, found in the inside of [[sarcophagi]] made of hollow trunks.  The gold represented a sacred metal and the passport for the [[afterlife]]. Around the 10th century the Quimbaya culture disappeared entirely due to unknown circumstances;  studies of the archeological items point to an advanced cultural development and the political structure of a [[cacique|cacicazgo]] with separated groups dedicated to pottery, religion, trade, gold work and war.

==Economy==

Living in the temperate tropical climate of the coffee belt, they were able to cultivate a wide variety of products: corn and cassava, as a food base, avocados, guava. They were also nourished by fishing and hunting, and they were excellent farmers, with what the land gave them.

They were also intense hunters. The hunt provided them with rabbit and deer meat in abundance, but also, as far as is known, they hunted opossums, tapirs, armadillos, foxes and peccaries, among other animals whose remains have been found.

Mining was mainly gold. They developed advanced metallurgy techniques to process gold in a way that is full of aesthetics and fine finishes. The name "quimbaya" has become a traditional generic term to refer to many of the productions and objects found in this geographical area, even if they do not come rigorously from the same ethnic group and come from different epochs in time.

Quimbaya technical skill extended beyond the production of goldsmith's pieces, including in the manufacture of oil for lighting, and in textiles, although given the poor geological conditions necessary for their preservation, few examples of textiles have survived. The manufacture of cotton blankets was, in fact, their main industry.

As merchants, they exchanged their pieces of metalwork, blankets, textiles and gold, with towns in neighboring regions and beyond. They also produced and traded salt, extracted from the rivers though a technique involving boiling river water using fire and lava.

==Culture and customs==
It is discussed if the quimbayas practiced ritual cannibalism with their war enemies, in festivities or very special celebrations. This cannibalism would have symbolic meanings related to the defeat and revenge of its enemies or to the appropriation of the spirit of the person. However, in the case of the quimbayas, the chronicles referred to in cannibalism are based on a single testimony about two alleged cases.2 They displayed human heads as trophies hanging from reeds in the plaza. During the conquest they intensified this practice to instill fear in the conquerors.

They paid much attention to their funeral practices, and the constructions of quimbayas tombs bear witness to this affirmation since, in truth, they elaborated an enormous variety of different tombs according to the specific of each funeral, in which the offerings that would accompany were always included. The deceased carried these on his way to the next life, including food and weapons to make it easier. In the tombs they also buried most of the pre-Columbian gold objects, personal elements of the dead and some other sacred elements. They believed that all bodies would be resurrected.

One of the most famous activities he has done to the quimbayas is his luxurious goldsmith shop, which enjoys an incredible beauty as well as a perfect technique. They developed metallurgy systems to combine copper with gold that was not abundant in their region (unlike other areas of the country). This combination of gold and copper, called "tumbaga", would not detract from the attractiveness, brightness and durability of its magnificent pieces, of a spectacular vivacity. One of them very popular is the famous «poporos». His goldsmithing is one of the most important in America given the exquisite beauty of the pieces expressed by very well developed metallurgical methods.

Its culture the way to melt the gold to obtain the exact grade of gold and copper to maintain a high purity, it is still unknown how such quality was achieved since they would need kilns that would reach a thousand degrees [[Celsius]] to melt these pieces.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

Another of the mysteries of the Quimbaya Culture are the quimbaya artifacts, formerly called "Pájaros del Otún", since the former was found near the banks of the Otún River in the province of Risaralda.

Another interesting site where we can find engravings and petroglyphs of the Quimbayas is in the Natural Park of Las Piedras Marcadas, also known as La Marcada. It is located in the path Alto del Toro in the municipality of Dosquebradas Risaralda (Colombia). The stones are a real mystery since no one knows exactly their antiquity or its true meaning. They are granitic stones of great hardness and in their surface they are great amount of engravings like spirals, stars, constellations, planets and other strange symbols; it may be some message from the gods that was left for posterity on the hard rock. The Park of the Marked Stones is one of the most unknown and despised parks by the scholars of the Colombian tribes, more interested in the goldsmith and clay works than in the lithic art. Others have related the marks with constellations and even they are related to the Quimbaya artifacts, and their mysterious origin; It is not really known why some were found on the banks of the Otún River when others have been found on the banks of the Cauca or the Magdalena.

A '''shell purse''' is a type of [[coin purse]] that is made from whole or trimmed [[mollusk shell]]s, especially from [[Bivalve shell|bivalve mollusc shells]]. These purses are of mainly [[novelty]] use and purchased as souvenirs of visits, etc. In the past, some were engraved or painted with floral or other decorations, sentimental messages, personal or place names. In many cases there was extra working of the shell, either grinding down and polishing to expose the [[mother of pearl]] or filing to form patterns such as criss-cross designs.

==Origins==
[[File:Margaritifera margaritifera-buiten.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Freshwater Pearl Mussel shell, with its natural [[periostracum]] intact]]
The use of shells as purses mainly dates from the end of the 19th century, when the Victorians love of the natural world and passion for collecting [[seashell]]s coincided with the [[middle class]]es being able to take holidays and make journeys to the seaside on the newly constructed railways. Visitors to [[seaside resort]]s often wished to take back [[souvenir]]s of their excursions, and shell purses were one of many items produced by entrepreneurial shopkeepers. They have been made in various parts of the world such as the United Kingdom, USA, Germany, etc.

==Uses==
Most shell purses were designed to be carried in a pocket or handbag, however some were designed as necklaces or small [[handbags]]. Being small they could at most be used to hold a few coins such [[Sovereign (British coin)|gold sovereigns]] in Victorian times, pills, keys, or special items such as [[arrowhead]]s, children's [[Deciduous teeth|milk teeth]], etc. Some were kept as ornaments or keepsakes, as witnessed by the number that have survived in good condition, indicating that they were not in regular use.

==Decoration==
By carving through the layers of the shell, intricate designs can be created, such as floral decorations, personal names, etc. As stated, some were painted with floral designs, personal names, etc.

==Shell types and designs==
[[File:Shell Purse - Mussel - Shark skin interior.JPG|left|thumb|200px|Shark skin accordion lining of a shell purse.]]

[[Freshwater mussel]] shells were often used. Because they are relatively large [[bivalve]]s the purse could accommodate an interior mechanism such as an accordion to separate coins into different denominations, etc. Shark skin was often used as a liner, dyed appropriately in red, blue, green, etc.&lt;ref name=ss&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/jl19RBiHSYKwFejzLiKJdQ BBC A History of the World] Retrieved : 2012-12-30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abalone]], various kinds of clams, [[mussel]]s, [[limpet]]s and other species of seashells have been used to make shell purses. Identifying the exact species used for any individual purse is often very difficult, especially as the surface layer of the shell was often removed in order to expose the mother of pearl layer (where such a layer was present), or was ground and polished in order to show brighter colors.

Shell purses were sometimes attached to a necklace, or had short chains attached that effectively made them into miniature handbags. Various clasps were used, secure by necessity, such as the 'kissing' type.
[[File:Shell Purse - Small - Closed.JPG|thumb|200px|Small shell purse]]
Modern examples are sometimes sold as 'Mermaid's Purses'.

==Similar artifacts==
Some hinged containers made out of shells were sold as sewing kits, but they are very similar in appearance to shell purses. [[Snuff box]]es were also sometimes made from bivalve shells.

'''Snowflake''' as a [[slang]] term involves the [[pejorative|derogatory]] usage of the word ''[[snowflake]]'' to refer to a person. Its meaning may include a person perceived by others to have an inflated sense of [[uniqueness]] or an unwarranted sense of [[entitlement]], or to be over-emotional, easily offended, and unable to deal with opposing opinions. Common usages include the terms ''special snowflake'', ''[[Generation Snowflake]]'', and ''snowflake'' as a politicized insult.

==Background and usage==
It is popularly believed but not proven that each snowflake has a unique structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allman|first1=William|title=No snowflakes alike? Prove it!|publisher=[[The San Diego Union]]|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jordan|first1=Gill|title=Your kids aren't unique and neither are snowflakes|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/unique-snowflakes-not-1.3889465|accessdate=4 April 2017|publisher=CBC News|date=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most usages of "snowflake" make reference to the physical qualities of [[snowflake]]s, such as their unique structure or fragility, while a minority of usages make reference to the white color of snow.&lt;ref name=USA&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stone|first1=Brianna|title=Been called a 'snowflake'? The 'it' new insult|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2017/02/01/the-origin-of-the-term-snowflake-may-surprise-you/|accessdate=4 April 2017|work=USA Today|date=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite news|title=No, 'Snowflake' as a Slang Term Did Not Begin with 'Fight Club'|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/the-less-lovely-side-of-snowflake|accessdate=4 April 2017|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]|date=January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Unique or special snowflake===
In 1996, [[Chuck Palahniuk]]'s novel ''[[Fight Club (novel)|Fight Club]]'' was published containing the quote: "you are not special, you are not a beautiful and unique snowflake". [[Fight Club|The 1999 film adaptation]] of the novel also contains this line. Following ''Fight Club'', the terminology "special snowflake" and "[[wikt:special snowflake syndrome|special snowflake syndrome]]" was applied to individuals who behaved as if they were very special. Such terminology refers to a person who believes their status as a unique individual means that they are destined for great success or deserve a special career with abundant praise and admiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Albrecht|first1=Emily|title=Special Snowflake Syndrome|work=[[The Dartmouth]]|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Merriam-Webster]], in the 2000s, snowflake referred "mostly to [[millennials]] who were allegedly too convinced of their own status as special and unique people to be able (or bothered) to handle the normal trials and travails of regular adult life".&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt;

Palahniuk has often been credited with coining the metaphorical use of snowflake.&lt;ref name=USA/&gt; According to Merriam-Webster, however, "Palahniuk was hardly the first person to use the metaphor. It's the stuff of [[self-help]] books and inspirational posters and elementary school assurances. The imagery before negation is lovely; we are each unique snowflakes, each worth treasuring because each is uniquely beautiful. Palahniuk's denial of the individual's snowflake status struck a chord."&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt; The unique as a snowflake metaphor has been used with elementary school students to celebrate their individuality and teamwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Grubbs|first1=Jenni|title=Green Acres students celebrating being unique|url=http://www.fortmorgantimes.com/fort-morgan-schools/ci_30756387/green-acres-students-celebrating-being-unique|accessdate=4 April 2017|work=Fort Morgan Times|date=27 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generation Snowflake===
{{Main|Generation Snowflake}}
The term "Generation Snowflake" was popularized following a 2015 student/faculty confrontation at [[Yale University]] which was later discussed in [[Claire Fox]]'s 2016 book, ''I Find That Offensive!''. The confrontation arose between university students and faculty Head of College, [[Nicholas Christakis]].  The confrontation, which was recorded and uploaded to YouTube, shows university students arguing with Christakis over a disagreement regarding Halloween costumes and the degree to which Yale university should intervene regarding student costumes which may be perceived as [[cultural appropriation]]. Fox described the video as showing a:  "screaming, almost hysterical mob of students" and that the backlash to the viral video led to the disparaging moniker "generation snowflake" for the students.&lt;ref name="CFox"&gt;{{cite book|title='I Find That Offensive!'|last=Fox|first=Claire|publisher=Biteback Publishing|year=2016|isbn=978-1-849-54981-3|location=London|authorlink=Claire Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 article by Helen Rumbelow published in ''[[The Australian]]'':  "The term 'generation snowflake' started in the United States. Parents cherished their offspring as 'precious little snowflakes', each alike but unique, or 'everyone is special'."&lt;ref name="Rumbelow"&gt;{{cite news |last = Rumbelow |first = Helen |title = Generation snowflake: Why millenials are mocked for being too delicate |url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/the-times/generation-snowflake-why-millenials-are-mocked-for-being-too-delicate/news-story/2f885d016af1a881bff92b69282fd88e |accessdate = 4 April 2017 |work = [[The Australian]] |location = Surry Hills |date = 9 November 2016 |subscription = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Claire Fox argues recent parenting philosophy led to parenting methods which "denied resilience-building freedoms that past generations enjoyed".&lt;ref name=Fox2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/06/generation-snowflake-how-we-train-our-kids-to-be-censorious-cry-babies/|title=Generation Snowflake: how we train our kids to be censorious cry-babies|last=Fox|first=Claire|date=4 June 2016|work=[[The Spectator]]|location=London|authorlink=Claire Fox|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "snowflake generation" was one of [[Collins Dictionary]]'s 2016 words of the year. Collins defines the term as "the young adults of the 2010s, viewed as being less resilient and more prone to taking offence than previous generations".&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.collinsdictionary.com/word-lovers-blog/new/top-10-collins-words-of-the-year-2016,323,HCB.html |title = Top 10 Collins Words of the Year 2016 |date = 3 November 2016 |work = Collins English Dictionary |accessdate = 4 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terms "generation snowflake" and "snowflake generation" are frequently used in reference to use of [[trigger warnings]] and [[safe space]]s, or to describe young adults as "anti-[[free speech]]", specifically in reference to a practice referred to as "[[no-platforming]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Stop calling us snowflakes', say millennials|url=http://theday.co.uk/politics/stop-calling-us-snowflakes-say-millennials|accessdate=4 April 2017|publisher=The Day|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryony"&gt;{{cite news |authorlink = Bryony Gordon |last = Gordon |first = Bryony |title = I feel sorry for the poor ickle millennials |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2016/04/08/bryony-gordon-why-i-feel-sorry-for-the-snowflake-generation/ |accessdate = 4 April 2017 |work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |location = London |date = 8 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Brooks |first1 = Richard |title = In defence of generation snowflake- everyone's favourite punching bag |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2016/11/14/in-defence-of-generation-snowflake--everyones-favourite-punching/ |accessdate = 4 April 2017 |work = The Daily Telegraph |location = London |date = 14 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used to refer to a reported increase in [[mental health]] issues among young adults.&lt;ref name="Pope"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Keaveney|first1 = Stephanie |title = The 'Snowflake' Generation: Real or Imagined? |url = http://www.popecenter.org/2016/12/snowflake-generation-real-imagined/ |accessdate = 4 April 2017 |publisher = The John William Pope Center |date = 19 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox2/&gt;

===Politicized insult===
Following [[Brexit]] in the UK and the election of [[Donald Trump]] as 45th President of the U.S., generation snowflake was often shortened to simply snowflake and became a politicized insult. A November 2016 article from  ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented: "Until very recently, to call someone a snowflake would have involved the word 'generation'."&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; 

Snowflake as a politicized insult is typically used by those on the [[right-wing politics|political right]] to insult those on the [[left-wing politics|political left]].&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Nicholson |first1 = Rebecca |title = 'Poor little snowflake': the defining insult of 2016 |url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/nov/28/snowflake-insult-disdain-young-people |accessdate = 4 April 2016 |work = The Guardian |location = London |date = 28 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Jessica Roy says the [[alt-right]] in the United States pejoratively describes most liberals and those protesting against [[Donald Trump]] as "snowflakes", short for "special snowflake".&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news |first = Jessica |last = Roy |url = http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-pol-alt-right-terminology-20161115-story.html |title = 'Cuck,' 'snowflake,' 'masculinist': A guide to the language of the 'alt-right' |work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date = 16 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 article from ''[[Think Progress]]'' commented: "The insult expanded to encompass not just the young, but liberals of all ages; it became the epithet of choice for right-wingers to fling at anyone who could be accused of being too easily offended, too in need of "safe spaces, too fragile".&lt;ref name=Progress&gt;{{cite news|last1=Goldstein|first1=Jessica|title=The surprising history of 'snowflake' as a political insult|url=https://thinkprogress.org/all-the-special-snowflakes-aaf1a922f37b|accessdate=4 April 2017|publisher=Think Progress|date=19 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathon Green, editor of "Green's Dictionary of Slang" points out snowflake is an unusual insult in that it calls someone weak and fragile without using misogynistic or homophobic references.&lt;ref name=boston&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peters|first1=Mark|title=Some 'snowflakes' can take the heat|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2017/02/23/some-snowakes-can-take-heat/VbOYgFNkB08cXeXAj4u4lJ/story.html|accessdate=4 April 2017|work=Boston Globe|date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Actor [[George Takei]] extended the metaphor to emphasize the power of snowflakes saying: "The thing about 'snowflakes' is this: They are beautiful and unique, but in large numbers become an unstoppable avalanche that will bury you."&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; Others have returned the insult back at those with right-wing politics, arguing "oversensitive whiners can be found all over the political spectrum" including President Trump. Comedian [[Neal Brennan]] referred to Donald Trump as "the biggest snowflake in America,"&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; while a January 2017 opinion piece from ''The Guardian'' refers to President Trump as "Snowflake-in-Chief"&lt;ref name=Guardian2&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brammer|first1=John Paul|title=America: behold, your Snowflake-in-Chief|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/16/snowflake-in-chief-donald-trump|accessdate=4 April 2017|work=The Guardian|date=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CNN commentator [[Van Jones]] called Trump "President Snowflake" based on his response to the [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections|FBI's Russia probe in May 2017]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Van Jones: Trump is 'President Snowflake' - CNN Video|url=http://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2017/05/19/van-jones-president-snowflake-tweet-sot-ac360.cnn|accessdate=2017-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
In the 1860s "snowflake" was used by abolitionists in [[Missouri]] to refer to those who opposed the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]]. The term referred to the color of snow, referring to valuing white people over black people. This usage was not believed to have extended beyond the state of Missouri in the 1800s.&lt;ref name=Webster/&gt;&lt;ref name=USA/&gt; 

In the 1970s, according to ''Green's Dictionary of Slang'', snowflake has been used to describe "a white person or a black person who was perceived as acting too much like a white person".&lt;ref name=Progress/&gt;&lt;ref name=USA/&gt;

==In popular culture==
In December 2016, the term snowflake was referenced in the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Last Man Standing (U.S. TV series)|Last Man Standing]]'', in an episode titled ''Precious Snowflake'' about [[microaggressions]] and [[politically correct]] speech restrictions on a university campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=S6 E09 Precious Snowflakes|url=http://abc.go.com/shows/last-man-standing/episode-guide/season-6/09-precious-snowflakes|accessdate=7 December 2016|publisher=ABC|date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Season 6, Episode 9 Precious Snowflakes|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/last-man-standing/episode-9-season-6/precious-snowflakes/319544/|accessdate=7 December 2016|work=TV Guide|date=2 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Townsend|first1=Karen|title='Last Man Standing' Hilariously Lampoons PC Special Snowflakes on College Campuses|url=https://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/culture/karen-townsend/2016/12/03/last-man-standing-hilariously-lampoons-pc-special-snowflakes|accessdate=7 December 2016|publisher=MRC NewsBusters|date=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The American live sketch comedy show, ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', in March 2017 aired a skit about a Trump loving dog, who through the aid of technology, was able to berate the anti-Trump humans in the room as "liberal snowflakes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tornoe|first1=Rob|title='Saturday Night Live' goes after liberal snowflakes with Trump-loving dog|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/real-time/Saturday-Night-Live-goes-after-liberal-snowflakes-with-Trump-loving-dog.html|accessdate=4 April 2017|work=Philadelphia Daily News|date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hashmi|first1=Siraj|title=Hilarious SNL skit targets 'liberal snowflakes' through a talking dog [VIDEO] |url=http://redalertpolitics.com/2017/03/13/hilarious-snl-skit-targets-liberal-snowflakes-talking-dog-video/|accessdate=4 April 2017|publisher=Red Alert Politics|date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox short story|author=[[Guy de Maupassant]]|title_orig=Le Horla|country=France|language=French|genre=Horror|pub_date=1887}}
"'''The Horla'''" (French: ''Le Horla'') is an 1887 short [[horror fiction|horror]] story written in the style of a journal by the French writer [[Guy de Maupassant]], after an initial, much shorter version published in the newspaper ''[[Gil Blas (periodical)|Gil Blas]]'', October 26, 1886.

American horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]], in his survey "[[Supernatural Horror in Literature]]" (1927), provides his own interpretation of the story:

{{quote|Relating the advent in France of an [[invisibility|invisible]] being who lives on water and milk, [[mind control|sways the minds of others]], and seems to be the vanguard of a horde of [[extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extra-terrestrial organisms]] arrived on earth to subjugate and overwhelm mankind, this tense narrative is perhaps without peer in its particular department.}}

The story has been cited as an inspiration for Lovecraft's own "[[The Call of Cthulhu]]", which also features an [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial being]] who influences minds and who is destined to conquer humanity.&lt;ref&gt;S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, "Call of Cthulhu, The," ''An H. P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia,'' p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''horla'' itself is not French, and is a [[neologism]]. [[Charlotte Mandell]], who has translated "The Horla" for publisher Melville House, suggests in an afterword that the word "horla" is a portmanteau of the French words ''hors'' ("outside"), and ''là'' ("there") and that "le horla" sounds like "the Outsider, the outer, the one Out There," and can be transliterally interpreted as "the 'what's out there'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = de Maupassant | first = Guy | authorlink = | author2 = | title = The Horla | publisher = Melville House | series = The Art of the Novella | volume = | edition = | date = 2005 | location = | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-9761407-4-0 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

In the form of a journal, the narrator, an upper-class, unmarried, bourgeois man, conveys his troubled thoughts and feelings of anguish. This anguish occurs for four days after he sees a "superb three-mast" Brazilian boat and impulsively waves to it, unconsciously inviting the supernatural being aboard the boat to haunt his home.
[[File:Horla-Apparition.png|thumb|200px]]

All around him, he senses the presence of a being that he calls the "Horla". The torment that the Horla causes is first manifested physically: The narrator complains that he suffers from "an atrocious fever", and that he has trouble sleeping. He wakes up from nightmares with the chilling feeling that someone is watching him and "kneeling on [his] chest."

Throughout the short story, the main character's sanity, or rather, his feelings of alienation, are put into question as the Horla progressively dominates his thoughts. Initially, the narrator himself questions his sanity, exclaiming "Am I going mad?" after having found his glass of water empty, despite not having drunk from it. He later decides that he is not, in fact, going mad, since he is fully "conscious" of his "state" and that he could indeed "analyze it with the most complete lucidity." The presence of the Horla becomes more and more intolerable to the protagonist, as it is "watching…looking at…[and] dominating" him.

After reading about a large number of Brazilians who fled their homes, bemoaning the fact that "they are pursued, possessed, governed like human cattle by…a species of vampire, which feeds on their life while they are asleep…[and] drinks water,"   the narrator soon realizes the Horla was aboard the Brazilian three-mast boat that he had previously greeted. He feels so "lost" and "possessed" to the point that he is ready to kill either the Horla, or himself.

==Influences==

===Literature===
*"The Horla" is used as an extension of the plot in the short story "The Theater Upstairs" by [[Manly Wade Wellman]]. In Wellman's novel ''[[Sherlock Holmes' War of the Worlds]]'' (1975), [[Sherlock Holmes]] suggests to [[Professor Challenger]] that the events of "The Horla" might actually be true.
* The ''[[Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'' (2003–2010) features horlas as powerful spirits, who appear as shadowy apparitions that cause madness in humans similar to the titular Horla of the short story.
* "The Horla" is the inspiration for [[Robert Sheckley]]'s short story "The New Horla" (2000) in his collection ''[[Uncanny Tales (Sheckley)|Uncanny Tales]]''.
* Kingsley Amis's first novel ''[[Lucky Jim]]'' (1954, chapter 6) describes Jim Dixon, a guest lecturer at a university, waking in a guestroom owned by the senior colleague whose good will he is depending on to continue in his job the next academic year, discovering he has fallen asleep drunk, and burned holes through blankets and sheets and on a bedside table. "Had he done this all to himself? Or had a wayfarer, a burglar, camped out in his room? Or was he the victim of some Horla fond of tobacco?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10390">'''''The Land of Fire''''' ({{lang-az|Odlar Yurdu}}) is a phrase in the [[Azerbaijani language]] and an ancient [[Culture of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani cultural]] concept that denoted either the entire [[Azerbaijan]]'s geographical land or the metaphysical realm of mortals, and later became associated with political sovereignty and cultural symbolism.

The larger concept of ''Odlar Yurdu'' is closely associated with [[civilization]] and order in classical Azerbaijani philosophy, and has formed the basis for the [[world view]] of the Azerbaijani people and nations influenced by them since at least the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azərbaycana niyə Odlar Yurdu deyilir?|url=http://musavat.com/mobile/maraql%C4%B1/Az%C9%99rbaycana-niy%C9%99-Odlar-Yurdu-deyilir_194642.html?welcome=1|website=musavat.com|accessdate=3 July 2014|language=Azerbaijani|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714134542/http://musavat.com/mobile/maraql%C4%B1/Az%C9%99rbaycana-niy%C9%99-Odlar-Yurdu-deyilir_194642.html?welcome=1#|archive-date=2014-07-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical and political development==
The etymology of the phrase is thought to be related to [[Atropates]], who ruled over the region of [[Atropatene]] (present [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]). The name "Atropates" itself is the Greek transliteration of an Old Iranian, probably Median, compounded name with the meaning "Protected by the (Holy) Fire" or "The Land of the (Holy) Fire".&lt;ref name="Library of Congres"&gt;{{cite web| title =Azerbaijan: Early History: Persian and Greek Influences | publisher = U.S. Library of Congress| url =  http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+az0014)| accessdate = June 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek name is mentioned by [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Strabo]]. Over the span of millennia the name evolved to ''Āturpātākān'' then to ''Ādharbādhagān'', ''Ādharbāyagān'', ''Āzarbāydjān'' and present-day ''Azerbaijan''.

Some critics have argued that the phrase is a reference either to the natural burning of surface oil deposits or to the oil-fueled fires in temples of the once-dominant [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tyrrell|first1=Maliheh S.|title=Aesopian Literary Dimensions of Azerbaijani Literature of the Soviet Period, 1920-1990|date=2000|publisher=Lexington Books|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_azerbaijanearly.htm|website=www.about.com|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbolism of the term widely been used in most fields such as in heraldry, the shield in [[national emblem of Azerbaijan]] contains the image of a fire in the center of an eight-point star against a background of the colors of the [[flag of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijani flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE NATIONAL SYMBOLS OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN|url=http://www.azerbaijan.az/_GeneralInfo/_StateSymbols/_stateSymbols_e.html|website=www.azerbaijan.az|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Azerbaijan]]'s independence from [[Soviet Union]], the phrase was used as a touristic campaign to promote the country as a tourist destination and as a location for industry.

The motto "Light your fire!", used to promote the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]], which was held in Baku, was based on the "Land of Fire" concept.&lt;ref name=landoffire&gt;{{cite web|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|title=Baku 2012: Light your fire!|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=43383&amp;_t=baku_2012_light_your_fire|publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]]|accessdate=25 January 2012|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==European calques==
The "Land of Flames" expression became the origin for the literary expressions denoting [[Azerbaijan]] in a number of European languages, such as in [[Russian language]] ''Strana Ogney'' (Страна Огней, i.e. "Country of the Fires").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ru:Страна огней: Азербайджан|url=http://www.nat-geo.ru/article/850-strana-ogney-azerbaydzhan/|website=www.nat-geo.ru|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|accessdate=3 July 2014|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Azerbaijan: Land of Fire and Flood Ancient Mariners and a Deluged Landscape|url=http://www.grahamhancock.com/forum/GallagherR1.php|website=www.grahamhancock.com|accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Last Horror Movie''''' is a 2003 British [[Found footage (pseudo-documentary)|found footage]] horror film directed by [[Julian Richards (director)|Julian Richards]]. On 24 August 2003 it premiered at the [[London FrightFest Film Festival]] and stars [[Kevin Howarth]] and [[Mark Stevenson]]. ''The Last Horror Movie'' was released onto DVD through [[Fangoria (magazine)|Fangoria's]] ''Gore Zone'' label on 7 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Review: THE LAST HORROR MOVIE (2004)|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/reviews/the-last-horror-movie|publisher=JoBlo.com|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Plot==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
The film follows Max Parry ([[Kevin Howarth]]), a disturbed wedding video cameraman, and his unnamed assistant ([[Mark Stevenson]]) as they perform several murders that they have videotaped. The two have used a video store [[VHS|tape]] in order to record the proceedings, breaking the fourth wall and insinuating that the copy of the film being watched is the only existing version of the tape. Throughout the film Max uses meta-references in order to show off his gruesome activities as a serial killer. The film raises questions surrounding visceral pleasure, this can be seen in one scene in particular during which the audience cannot see the victims (two at once) being murdered, Max Parry then asks the audience "I bet you wanted to see that, and if you didn't, why are you still watching?" 

At the end of the film the audience is left to believe that since they are watching the only copy of the film, that they will potentially become one of Max's victims.

==Development==
Richards stated that he was inspired to create ''The Last Horror Movie'' after reading [[Stephen King|Stephen King's]] ''[[Danse Macabre (book)|Danse Macabre]]''.&lt;ref name="JBI"&gt;{{cite web|title=INT: JULIAN RICHARDS|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/interview-julian-richards|publisher=JoBlo.com|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards was also inspired by "the idea of using horror fiction to help people explore their anxieties about difficult issues", as he has the main character of Max Parry using it as a way to "justify his crimes to the world".&lt;ref name="JBI" /&gt; The movie was filmed with a small crew on a limited budget, with most of the film's issues stemming from the prosthetic make-up effects, as they "had to work real time whilst remaining hidden from the camera".&lt;ref name="JBI" /&gt;
==Release==
''Hart Sharp Video'' released the DVD [[Director's Cut]] and normal cut versions of the film on 7 December 2004. ''Arts Alliance America'' also released the film on DVD that same day.

The film was last released on DVD by Jinga Films on 26 August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Last Horror Movie (2003) - Julian Richards|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/the-last-horror-movie-v302719/releases|website=AllMovie.com|publisher=AllMovie|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=October 2014}}
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 56% based on {{nowrap|9 reviews}}, with a [[weighted average]] rating of 5.9/10.&lt;ref name="rottomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Last Horror Movie (2004) - Rotten Tomatoes |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_last_horror_movie/ |website=Rotten Tomatoes.com |publisher=Flixer |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''ReelFilm'' criticized the movie as being "repetitive" and that the film would have worked better as a short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MiniReviews: The Last Horror Movie (October 8/05)|url=http://www.reelfilm.com/mini50.htm#last|publisher=ReelFilm|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Bradshaw]] from ''[[The Guardian Weekly|The Guardian]]'' awarded the film 1/5 stars, calling it "smug and drearily nasty".&lt;ref name="bradshaw03"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bradshaw |first1=Peter |title=The Last Horror Movie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/97837/last.horror.movie |website=The Guardian.com |publisher=Peter Bradshaw |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, ''[[Dread Central]]'' gave a more positive review and stated that "It's a movie that makes you think, and that's far too rare nowadays."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Butane|first=Johnny|title=Review: Last Horror Movie|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/last-horror-movie-the-2003|publisher=Dread Central|accessdate=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marc Savlov from ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, writing, " Despite the film’s horrific verisimilitude... and a genuinely smart screenplay by Richards and James Handel that simultaneously rubs our noses in the horror while allowing us to savor the flavor – and thereby become complicit in Max’s onscreen theatrics"&lt;ref name="savlov"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Savlov |first1=Marc |title=The Last Horror Movie - Film Calendar - The Austin Chronicle |url=https://www.austinchronicle.com/events/film/2004-06-18/216479/ |website=Austin Chronicle.com |publisher=Marc Savlov |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Soul of the Rhino''''' is a book about a Nepali adventure with kings and elephant drivers, billionaires and [[bureaucrat]]s, [[Shamanism|shamans]] and scientists, and the [[Indian Rhinoceros]].

==Overview==
In early 2006, [[National Public Radio]] reported that "A promising conservation effort to save one of Nepal's signature endangered species is now in serious trouble, due primarily to poachers taking advantage of fighting between government forces and Maoist insurgents."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5459509 John Nielsen: "Fighting in Nepal Threatens Rhino Population", NPR's Morning Edition, June 13, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; This was devastating news indeed to author and scientist Hemanta Mishra, who has spent the better part of his adult life struggling to save the [[Indian Rhinoceros|Indian Rhino]] from extinction in his native [[Nepal]].

The Soul of the Rhino is the spirited yet humble account of Mishra's unique personal journey. Fresh out of university in the 1970s, Mishra embarks on his conservation work with the help of an ornery but steadfast elephant driver, the [[Shah dynasty|Nepalese royal family]], and handfuls of  like-minded scientists whose aim is to protect the animal in the foothills of the [[Himalayas]]. Yet, in spite of decades spent creating nature reserves and moving rhinos to protected areas, arm-wrestling politicians, and raising awareness for the cause, Mishra is still fearful about the future of the Indian Rhino. To this day, Nepal is overrun by armed [[Insurgency|insurgents]], political violence, and poachers who could kill off this magnificent creature for good.

Filled with candor and bittersweet humor, Mishra re-creates his journey on behalf of the rhino, an ugly yet enchanting, terrifying yet delicate creature. The first book of its kind to delve into the multilayered political labyrinths of South Asian wildlife conservation, and one man's endurance in the face of it all, The Soul of the Rhino is sure to win over your heart and soul.

An '''umbrella term''' is a word or phrase that covers a wide range of concepts belonging to a common [[Categorization|category]]. For example, ''[[cryptology]]'' is an umbrella term that encompasses [[cryptography]] and [[cryptanalysis]], among other fields. Similarly, an [[umbrella organization]] is a central and coordinating body representing a number of smaller, separate bodies.

A '''blanket term''' is a closely related [[morpheme|word]] or [[phrase]] that is used to describe multiple groups of related things. The degree of relation may vary or have a minimal relationship, but blanket terms often trade specificity for ease of use. In other words, a blanket term, by itself, gives little detail about the things that it describes or the relationships between them, but it is easy to say and remember. Blanket terms may originate as [[slang]] but eventually become integrated into the general vocabulary.

A '''university museum''' is a repository of [[collection (museum)|collection]]s run by a [[university]], typically founded to aid teaching and research within the institution of higher learning. The [[Ashmolean Museum]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]] is an early example, originally housed in the building that is now the [[Museum of the History of Science]]. A more recent example is the [[Holburne Museum of Art]] in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], originally constructed as a hotel in 1796 it is now the official museum of the [[University of Bath]].

==Mission==
Historically, the focus of university museums and galleries included curatorial research into, as well as the display of, commemorative, ceremonial, decorative and didactic collections.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, J. (1995). [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09647779509515429?journalCode=rmmc20#.VjWTqFLhGHs The role of the university curator in the 1990s]. Museum Management and Curatorship, 14(1), 73-79.&lt;/ref&gt; For academics, these collections served as a valuable research resource. For students, museums performed both a leisure and learning function, developing their visual literacy, critical thinking, and creative skills. Aside from campus, museums served their perspective city and town's communities, spreading museological literacy among the different target audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Sandell, R., &amp; Nightingale, E. (2012). [https://books.google.com/books?id=XfmneyJB1VwC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=university+museums&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAjgKahUKEwjG3fvAk-7IAhWFth4KHTt6Dwk#v=onepage&amp;q=university%20museums&amp;f=false Museums, equality, and social justice.] Abingdon, Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

With decades, the role of the university museums changed as they started to become more open and receptive to the cultural needs of the public.&lt;ref&gt;Guthe, A. K. (1966). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2151-6952.1966.tb01612.x/abstract The Role of a University Museum]. [[Curator: The Museum Journal]], 9: 103–105.&lt;/ref&gt; Public educational outreach is considered now by many university museums as an integral part of their  mission, some even adopt a market approach.&lt;ref&gt;[[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]]. (2001).

(2006). [http://www.cimu.unam.mx/pdf/papers/Kate%20Arnold-Forster.pdf Museums for the Future: Recognising new relevance for University Museums.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typology==
Organizationally, university museums are represented by a variety of historical, traditional and novel entities, such as anatomical theaters and archeology museums, natural science and art museums, history museums, planetariums, arboretums and aquariums, archives and house-museums, science and arts centers, ecomuseums, hospital museums, and contemporary art galleries, as well as discipline-specific collections hosted by academic departments and institutes; some special collections are hosted by the university libraries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publicus.culture.hu-berlin.de/collections/ UMAC Worldwide Database of University Museums &amp; Collections]&lt;/ref&gt; In general, university museums and collections are classified based on disciplinary criteria or the nature of the artifacts.&lt;ref name= "Lourenço"&gt;Lourenço, M. C. (2005). Between two worlds: The distinct nature and contemporary significance of university museums and collections in Europe (Doctoral dissertation).&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe the number of the university museums and collections is estimated as 12,914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webpages.fc.ul.pt/~mclourenco/chapters/MCL2005_Appendix1.pdf Number of university museums and collections in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==History==
The first university museums can be traced to the medieval universities and their teaching collections to support medical education — the physic, or botanical, garden (hortus medicus) and the anatomical theatre (theatrum anatomicum). The first ''hortus medicus'' was established in Italy in either Padua or Pisa in the 1540s and the first ''theatrum anatomicum'' in Padua in 1594 for the purpose of educating both the apothecaries and doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Olmi, G. (2001). Science-Honour-Metaphor: Italian cabinets of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In: O. Impey &amp; A. MacGregor (eds.), The origins of museums: the cabinet of curiosities in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Europe, second edition, pp. 1-17. House of Stratus, London.&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of the 17th century, anatomical theaters were established at the universities of Bologna, Ferrara, Leiden and Montpellier.&lt;ref name= "Lourenço"/&gt; There are records that document the use of Pisa’s ''hortus medicus'' opened in the 1590s as a teaching museum.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, E.P., 1979. Museums in motion. American Association for State and Local History, Nashville.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, the teaching museum model was adopted by painters, sculptors, and architects. The cabinets of physics and chemistry followed the suit.&lt;ref name= "Lourenço"/&gt; At the University of Oxford, the picture gallery of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church College]] was founded in 1546. In 1671, the [[University of Basel]] granted public access to the Basilius Amerbach’s cabinet, which was donated by the city of [[Basel]]. However, the [[Ashmolean Museum|Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology]], that was opened in 1683 is generally perceived as the first university museum on record.&lt;ref name= "Lourenço"/&gt; In the following centuries the diversity and complexity of the university museums and collections dramatically increased.

In Q4 2015, the company announced plans to acquire Pizzeria Vetri, an eatery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4079">'''''Urreligion''''' is a notion of an "original" or "oldest" form of [[religious tradition]] ({{wikt-lang|de|ur-}} being a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] [[prefix]] for "original, primitive, elder, primeval, or ''{{wt|en|proto-}}''"). The term contrasts with [[organized religion]], such as the [[theocracy|theocracies]] of the early [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|urban]] cultures of the [[Ancient Near East]] or [[major religions|current world religions]].
The term originates in [[German Romanticism]].

==History==
[[Friedrich Creuzer]] put forward the notion of a monotheistic primeval religion  in 1810 - an idea taken up by other authors of the [[Romantic period]], such as [[J. J. Bachofen]],&lt;ref&gt;
In his ''Mutterrecht und Urreligion '', Bachofen connects primeval religion and [[matriarchy]].
&lt;/ref&gt; but decidedly opposed by [[Johann Heinrich Voss]].&lt;ref&gt;
''Symbolik und Mythologie der alten Völker, besonders der Griechen. In Vorträgen und Entwürfen.'' Leipzig and Darmstadt, Heyer und Leske, 1810-12.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Goethe]] in a conversation with [[Eckermann]] on 11 March 1832 discussed the human ''Urreligion'', which he characterized as "pure nature and [pure] reason, of divine origin".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Goethe,+Johann+Wolfgang/Gespr%C3%A4che/%5BZu+den+Gespr%C3%A4chen%5D/1832 Gespräche]&lt;/ref&gt;
The final scene of his ''[[Faust Part Two]]'' (1832) has been taken as evoking "the 'Urreligion' of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;
Biblical Borrowings in Goethe's "Faust": A Historical Survey of Their Interpretation, by O. Durrani The Modern Language Review 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

Often used in the sense of [[natural religion]] or [[indigenous religion]], the religious behaviour of pre-modern [[tribal societies]] such as [[shamanism]], [[animism]] and [[ancestor worship]] (e.g. [[Australian aboriginal mythology]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg15220540.600-flood-gave-birth-to-worlds-oldest-religion.html newscientist.com]
&lt;/ref&gt;), the term ''Urreligion'' has also been used by adherents of various religions to back up the claim that their own religion is somehow "primeval" or "older" than competing traditions. In the context of a given religious faith, literal belief in a [[creation myth|creation]] may be the base of primality. (e.g. [[Biblical literalism]], or literal belief in the [[Hindu]] [[Puranas]]).

In particular, [[Urmonotheismus]] comprises the historical claim that primeval religion was [[monotheistic]]. Some have rejected this hypothesis,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and certain [[Christian apologetics]] circles defend it.&lt;ref&gt;
Pajak, Sylwester, ''Urreligion und Uroffenbarung bei P. W. Schmidt'', St. Augustin 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteenth-century [[Germanic mysticism]] sometimes claimed that the [[Germanic runes]] bore testimony of a primeval religion.&lt;ref&gt;

Some more recent [[new religious movements]] that claim to restore primeval religion include [[Godianism]]&lt;ref&gt;

A '''water tank''' is a container for storing water. 
Water tanks are used to provide [[storage of water]] for use in many applications, [[drinking water]], [[irrigation]] agriculture, [[fire]] suppression, [[agricultural]] farming, both for plants and livestock, [[chemical]] manufacturing, [[food preparation]] as well as many other uses. [[Water]] tank parameters include the general design of the tank, and choice of construction materials, linings. Various materials are used for making a water tank: [[plastics]] ([[polyethylene]], [[polypropylene]]), [[fiberglass]], [[concrete]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], [[steel]] (welded or bolted, carbon, or stainless). Earthen pots also function as water storages. Water tanks are an efficient way to help developing countries to store clean water.

== History ==
[[Image:Bastei - Felsenburg Neurathen - Burghof und Zisterne.jpg|thumb|right|Stone water tank in a castle courtyard, [[Saxony]], Germany]]

Throughout history, [[wood]], [[ceramic]] and [[rock (geology)|stone]] tanks have been used as water tanks.  These containers were all naturally occurring and some man made and a few of these tanks are still in service. The [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (3000–1500 BC) made use of [[granary|granaries]] and water tanks. [[The Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[castle]]s needed water tanks for the defenders to withstand a siege. A wooden water tank found at the [[Año Nuevo State Reserve]] ([[California]]) was restored to functionality after being found completely overgrown with [[ivy]].  It had been built in 1884.

== Types ==
'''Chemical contact tank''' of FDA and NSF polyethylene construction, allows for retention time for chemical treatment chemicals to "contact" (chemically treat) with product water.

'''Ground water tank''', made of lined carbon steel, may receive water from a water well or from surface water, allowing a large volume of water to be placed in inventory and used during peak demand cycles.

'''Elevated water tank''', also known as a [[water tower]], will create a pressure at the ground-level outlet of 1 kPa per 10.2&amp;nbsp;cm or 1 psi per 2.31 feet of elevation. Thus a tank elevated to 20 metres creates about 200 kPa and a tank elevated to 70 feet creates about 30 psi of discharge pressure, sufficient for most domestic and industrial requirements.

Vertical cylindrical dome top tanks may hold from 200 litres or fifty gallons to several million gallons. Horizontal cylindrical tanks are typically used for transport because their low-profile creates a low center of gravity helping to maintain equilibrium for the transport vehicle, trailer or truck.

A Hydro-pneumatic tank is typically a horizontal pressurized storage tank. Pressurizing this reservoir of water creates a surge free delivery of stored water into the distribution system.

==Design==

By design a water tank or container should do no harm to the water. Water is susceptible to a number of ambient negative influences, including [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], [[algae]], changes in [[pH]], and accumulation of [[minerals]], accumulated [[gas]]. The contamination can come from a variety of origins including piping, tank construction materials, animal and bird feces, mineral and gas intrusion. A correctly designed water tank works to address and mitigate these negative effects. It is imperative that water tanks be cleaned annually to preclude delivery of algae, bacteria and viruses to people or animals.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

A safety based news article linked copper poisoning as originating from a plastic tank. The article indicated that rainwater was collected and stored in a plastic tank and that the tank did nothing to mitigate the low pH. The water was then brought into homes with copper piping, the copper was released by the high acid rainwater and caused poisoning in humans.{{cn|date=November 2018}} Since the plastic tank is an inert container, it has no effect on the incoming water. Good practice would be to analyze any water source periodically and treat accordingly, in this case the collected acid rain should be analyzed, and pH adjusted before being brought into a domestic water supply system.

The release of copper due to acidic water may be monitored by a variety of technology, beginning with pH strips and going to more sophisticated pH monitors, indicate pH which when acidic or caustic, some with output communication capabilities.  There is no "linkage" between the plastic tank and copper poisoning, a solution to the problem is easy, monitor 'stored rainwater' with 'swimming pool strips' cheap and available at, swimming pool supply outlets. If the water is too acidic, contact state/county/local health officials to obtain advice and precise solutions and pH limits and guidelines as to what should be used to treat rainwater to be used as domestic [[drinking water]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}
