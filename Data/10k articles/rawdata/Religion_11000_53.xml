'''Alexander Craighead''' (1705–1766) was a [[Scots-Irish American]] preacher.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Alexander Craighead was born in [[Donegal]], [[Ulster]], [[Ireland]] on March 18, 1705. He emigrated to North America with his father, the [[Reverend]] Thomas Craighead.

Rev. Alexander Craighead was born in Freetown, Massachusetts in 1715, died March 1766 in Rocky Creek, [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina]].  He was the youngest son of Rev. Thomas Craighead and Margaret Holmes. He was the brother to my ancestor, John Craighead. Their mother was Margaret Holmes who was born in Scotland. She came with her husband and four of their five children from County Londonderry to America settling first in Massachusetts. Her brother, William Holmes' son Robert Holmes married Mary Franklin whose brother was Benjamin Franklin, Patriot, Statesmen, Scientist, and Signer of the American Declaration of Independence. [Source, "Craighead Family", by Rev. James Geddes Craighead]. Also, "Simpson and Allied Families", by Dennis William Simpson 1985.

===Career===
He preached at the Middle Octorara Church, along the [[Susquehanna River]] in [[Pennsylvania]], during the 1730s, but continued to move south and west to the frontiers of colonial civilization. After a stay in [[Augusta County, Virginia]], at [[Windy Cove]], he moved to [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina]].

"Another group of pioneers ([[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]]) settled nearer the present site of [[Charlotte]] and organized the Sugaw Creek Presbyterian Church in 1755, with Rev. Craighead serving as pastor of both the Rocky River church and the Sugaw Creek Presbyterian Church from the time each was organized until [his death in] 1766. Details of his long, eventful, and sometimes turbulent life are recorded in numerous places, notably The [[Presbyterian Church]] at Rocky River, by Thomas Hugh Spence Jr. (1954) and A History of Sugaw Creek Presbyterian Church, by Neill Roderick McCeachy (1954)."

A prolific writer and leader in his faith, he published numerous works, including ''Renewal of the Covenants, National and Solemn League; A Confession of Sins; An Engagement to Duties; and a Testimony; as they were Carried on at Middle Octorara in Pennsylvania, November 11'', and ''The reasons of Mr. Alexander Craighead's receding from the present judicatories of this church..., 1743'', both published by [[Benjamin Franklin]].

Considered a promoter of the "[[Revivalism|Revival]]" and a participant in the "[[First Great Awakening|Great Awakening]]", he was a vocal critic of [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] and the [[Church of England]]. He often preached to his flock to resist threats to their independence, and he held the rights of the common man as sacred as that of kings. He is counted as the spiritual father of the [[Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence]], which was allegedly written nine years after his death.

===Death===
He died in 1766, and was buried in the oldest burial ground of Sugaw Creek Presbyterian Church, on Craighead Road off North [[Tryon Street]] in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].

[[File:Alexander Schmemann.jpg|thumb|right|Father Alexander Schmemann holding a chalice during Divine Liturgy]]
'''Alexander Dmitrievich Schmemann''' ({{lang-ru|Александр Дмитриевич Шмеман}}; 13 September 1921 in [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] – 13 December 1983 in [[Crestwood, New York]])&lt;ref name="NYT Obit"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/14/obituaries/rev-alexander-schmemann-dean-of-orthodox-seminary.html | title=REV. ALEXANDER SCHMEMANN, DEAN OF ORTHODOX SEMINARY | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=14 December 1983 | accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an influential [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox Christian]] priest, [[theology|teacher]], and writer. From 1946 to 1951 he taught in Paris, and afterwards in New York. In his teachings and writings he sought to establish the close links between Christian theology and Christian liturgy. At the time of his death, he was the dean of the [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary]].

==Early life and studies==
Alexander Schmemann was born in 1921 in Tallinn, [[Estonia]], into a family of Russian émigrés.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt; His grandfather had been a senator and a member of the State Council and his father an officer of the Imperial Life-Guards. When he was a child his family moved to France, where he was educated in Russian schools and at a French lycee before becoming a student at the University of Paris (1940–1945), where he wrote a thesis on theocracy and the Eastern Roman Empire. In 1943 he married Juliana Osorguine (1923–2017), before completing his theological studies in 1945 at the [[St. Sergius Orthodox Theological Institute]] in [[Paris, France|Paris]] (where he studied with the noted Russian theologian, Father [[Sergei Bulgakov]], amongst others).

==Career==
In 22 October 1946 Schmemann was ordained to the presbyterate of the Orthodox Church by [[Vladimir (Tikhonicky)]]. From 1946–51 he taught [[church history]] at St. Sergius Institute.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt;

He was invited to join the faculty of [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary]], then in New York City, where he taught from 1951 onwards.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt; When the seminary moved to its present campus in Crestwood, New York in 1962, Father Alexander assumed the post of dean, which he would hold until his death. He also served as adjunct professor at [[Columbia University]], [[New York University]], [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] and [[General Theological Seminary]] in New York. Much of his focus at St Vladimir's was on liturgical theology, which emphasizes the liturgical tradition of the Church as a major sign and expression of the Christian faith.

Fr Schmemann was accorded the title of [[Archpriest#Byzantine Christianity|''protopresbyter'']], the highest honor that can be bestowed on a married Orthodox priest.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt; He held honorary degrees from [[Butler University]], General Theological Seminary, [[Lafayette College]], [[Iona College (New York)|Iona College]], and [[Holy Cross Greek Orthodox School of Theology]].

He was an Orthodox observer for the [[Second Vatican Council]] of the [[Catholic Church]] from 1962 to 1965.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt;

He was active in the establishment of the [[Orthodox Church in America]] and in its being granted [[autocephalous|autocephaly]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1970.

His Russian-language sermons were broadcast into the Soviet Union on ''[[Radio Liberty]]'' for 30 years.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt; He gained a broad following of listeners across the [[Soviet Union]], including [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], who became his friend after emigrating to the West.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt;

At the time of his death, he was the dean of the [[Saint Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary]], a position he had held since 1962.&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt; Schmemann died of cancer in 1983 in [[Crestwood, New York]].&lt;ref name="NYT Obit" /&gt;

==Works==
Fr Schmemann published many books and articles. ''For the Life of the World'', a popular volume on Christian faith as reflected in liturgy, has been translated into eleven languages. Originally prepared as study guide for the National Student Christian Federation in 1963, it even had an anonymous version published by the underground [[samizdat]] in the Soviet Union. ''The Eucharist'' was finished just before his death. This and several collections of his writings were published posthumously.

* ''Introduction to Liturgical Theology'' (1961)
* ''The Historical Road of Eastern Orthodoxy'' (1963)
* ''Great Lent: Journey to Pascha'' (1969;  revised ed. 1974)

It should be noted that Schmemann's work, including entire courses, are taught at theology schools. In 2018 the [[Metropolitan Andrey Sheptytsky Institute of Eastern Christian Studies]] at [[St. Michael's College, Toronto|St. Michael's College]] offered a course ''[https://www.sheptytskyinstitute.ca/summer-2018-courses/ The Liturgical theology of Alexander Schmemann (1921-1983)]''.

'''Anat Hoffman''' ({{lang-he|ענת הופמן}}; born 1954) is an Israeli activist and serves as Executive Director of the [[Israel Religious Action Center]], also known as IRAC. She is the director and founding member of Nashot HaKotel, also known as [[Women of the Wall]]. Hoffman is a former member of the [[Jerusalem]] City Council. In 2013, the Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' named her "Person of the Year", noting the award reflected "the prominence that she has achieved across the Jewish world over the past 12 months".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/features/1.545219|title=Women of the Wall’s Anat Hoffman Is Haaretz’s Person of the Year|work=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' listed her fifth, among its list of 50 Most Influential Jews, for forcefully and successfully bringing the issue of women's rights at the Kotel to the "forefront of the consciousness of world Jewry". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Lapid-tops-Jerusalem-Posts-50-most-influential-Jews-list-313123|title=Yair Lapid tops Post's 50 most influential Jews list - Jewish World - Jerusalem Post|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Hoffman is a [[Sabra (person)|Sabra]] born on a [[kibbutz]] near [[Jerusalem]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/10/world/the-arab-uprising-after-two-years-voices-from-both-sides.html The Arab Uprising After Two Years: Voices From Both Sides ''The New York Times'', 10 December 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1954. Her mother, Varda Blechman, was the first child born at Kibbutz [[Ramat Rachel]] (Hebrew: רָמַת רָחֵל, lit. Rachel's Heights). Her American-born father, Charles Weiss, served as a [[Voice of America]] correspondent in Israel. She attended the [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design]]. She also excelled as a competitive athlete, becoming a champion swimmer. She competed in the [[Maccabiah Games]], winning titles in nine events.
 
In 1974, after she completed her service in the [[Israel Defense Forces]], she and her husband at the time, Michael, left for the United States to study. She graduated from [[UCLA]] in 1980 with a B.A. in [[Psychology]]. While at UCLA, she was connected to [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life]] and started the Israeli Student Organization. She was exposed to [[Reform Judaism]] and realized for the first time that Judaism was not limited to [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jerusalem-Report/Israel/A-modern-day-Deborah|title=A modern-day Deborah|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She later pursued graduate study at [[Bar Ilan University]].

Returning to Israel, she became an activist for religious pluralism, becoming involved in the founding of Kol Haneshema, a Reform or progressive synagogue in Jerusalem. She served on the Jerusalem City Council from 1988 to 2002, representing the Civil Rights and Peace Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfjff.org/film/biography?id=3870&amp;last=Hoffman&amp;first=+Anat&amp;role=Panelist|title=Home - Jewish Film Institute|work=Jewish Film Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s she led a campaign for consumer rights with regard to [[Bezeq]], the Israeli telecommunications company that had a monopoly, and refused to offer customer itemized bills. Hoffman complained, on behalf of consumers, that they were paying for items they had not used. In the end, she prevailed and Bezeq issued itemized bills to customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/news/israel-news/back-wall-still-fighting|title=The Jewish Week - Connecting the World to Jewish News, Culture, and Opinion|work=The Jewish Week - Connecting The World To Jewish News, Culture &amp; Opinion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anat Hoffman is chair of the Domari Society of Gypsies in Jerusalem. Additionally, prior to the 1993 Oslo Accords, Hoffman was the chairwoman of [[Women in Black]], an international women's anti-war movement with an estimated 10,000 activists around the world. The first group was formed by Israeli women in Jerusalem in 1988, following the outbreak of the First intifada.&lt;ref name=Feminism&gt;{{cite book|last1=Melanie S.

'''Babs Reingold''' (born in [[Caracas, Venezuela]]) is an American contemporary interdisciplinary artist working with sculpture, [[Installation art|installation]], video, painting and drawing. She currently lives and works in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] and maintains a studio in [[New York City]].

==Art==
Reingold is best known as a visual and [[conceptual artist]] for creating alternate ambiguities with her wall art and installations as they relate to the environment, poverty and beauty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.florida-arts.org/programs/fellowship/displayfellow.cfm?id=420 Babs Reingold, 2010 Fellow in Visual Art, Pinellas County, Florida Division of Cultural Affairs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017025132/http://www.florida-arts.org/programs/fellowship/displayfellow.cfm?id=420 |date=October 17, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She draws on her early experiences of hardship to create elaborate installations using domestic objects and natural materials like clotheslines, threads, human hair, animal skins, [[organza]] fabric structures, rust and tea staining, and [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://brendanscottcarroll.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/babs-reingold/ Brendan Carroll’s interview with Babs Reingold]&lt;/ref&gt; The dynamics of the environment, power, technology, and the manipulation and destruction of nature are recurring themes in her art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drawingcenter.org/viewingprogram/share_portfolio.cfm?pf=1013 Babs Reingold’s Drawing Center entry]&lt;/ref&gt; Her installation ''The Last Tree'' portrays the world's 193 countries with fabricated silk organza tree stumps stuffed with human hair in pails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iseny.org/usr_helio1/index.php Babs Reingold: The Last Tree curated by Midori Yoshimoto, Ph.D at the ISE Cultural Center, NY]&lt;/ref&gt; This elaborate installation, curated by Midori Yoshimoto at the ISE Cultural Foundation in New York, illuminates [[Jared Diamond]]'s question ''What was the Easter Islander thinking when he chopped down the last tree?'' resulting in a culture that demolished the entire wealth of its natural resources. A second show of the traveling exhibit was at the [[Burchfield Penney Art Center]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] in 2016-2017. Recent museum showings were at the [[Museum of Fine Arts (St. Petersburg, Florida)]] in 2015-2016.

==Personal life==
After spending her childhood in Caracas, and youth in [[Dallas, Texas]], Reingold endured grinding poverty as an adolescent in Woodhill, a public housing complex in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] with her mother and four siblings after her photographer father became ill with [[multiple sclerosis]] and her mother was unable to cope,.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brendanscottcarroll.wordpress.com/2011/03/19/babs-reingold/ Brendan Carroll’s interview with Babs Reingold]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cltampa.com/tampa/babs-reingolds-unsettling-vision-of-lives-traumatized-by-poverty/Content?oid=2035505#.UUS5eaWj4Rw Babs Reingold's unsettling vision of lives traumatized by poverty by Megan Voeller]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://local-artists.org/user/4883/cv Babs Reingold and the illusion of reality]&lt;/ref&gt; Reingold later escaped the cycle of poverty to become a successful artist. She graduated with a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] (BFA) degree from the [[Cleveland Institute of Art]], and obtained a [[Master of Fine Arts]] (MFA) degree from the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York]].

==Museum collections==
Reingold's works of art can be found in numerous public and private collections around the world, and are included in the permanent collections of the [[Newark Museum of Art]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]]; the [[Museum of Fine Arts (St. Petersburg, Florida)]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]]; and the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]], among others.

The '''Bahá'í Faith in Denmark''' began in 1925, but it was more than 20 years before the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] community in [[Denmark]] began to grow after the arrival of American [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|Bahá'í pioneers]] in 1946. Following that period of growth, the community established its Bahá'í [[National Spiritual Assembly]] in 1962. In 2002, Bahá'í sources indicate about 300 Bahá'ís were recorded, including both Iranian Bahá'í refugees and Danish converts.&lt;ref name="West"&gt;{{cite book | last = Warburg | first = Margit | authorlink= Margit Warburg | editor = Peter Smith | title = Bahá'ís in the West | publisher = Kalimat Press | year = 2004 | pages = 228–63 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=x7wyJdyE60oC&amp;pg=PA228 | isbn = 1-890688-11-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying mostly on the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 1200 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | accessdate = 2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early history==

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916–1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]].  The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several countries in [[Europe]] including beyond where `Abdu'l-Bahá had visited in 1911–12. Written on April 11, 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 — after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. World traveling Bahá'í journalist [[Martha Root]] subsequently visited King [[Haakon VII of Norway]] among her many trips.&lt;ref name="gpb"&gt;{{cite book  |first=Shoghi |last=Effendi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/ | pages = 388}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seventh tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |author2=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab |author3=trans. and comments  | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands."&lt;ref name="tablets"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-6.html | pages = 43 |origyear = 1916–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the release of these tablets a few Bahá'ís began moving to [[Scandinavia]]n countries:

*Johanne Sørensen, a [[Danish people|Dane]], became a Bahá'í while in the [[Territory of Hawaii]] in 1925. Returning to Denmark in the same year, she was the country's first Bahá'í, though there would be no others for more than 20 years perhaps in part due to her [[introvert]]ed personality.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; During those years she was involved with translating, or seeing to translations being done, and corresponded in over 100 letters with [[Shoghi Effendi]], then the head of the religion, about the translation work. In 1926 Sørensen published a translation credited as a work of [[John Esslemont]]'s &lt;!-- "Hvad ei Baha'i Berageken?" (What is the Baha'i Movement?), but there is some controversy over this name and cannot find primary source yet--&gt; the year after his death.&lt;ref name="MacEoin"&gt;{{cite web | last = MacEoin | first = Denis | authorlink= Denis MacEoin |author2=William Collins | title = Principles | work = The Babi and Baha'i Religions: An Annotated Bibliography | publisher = Greenwood Press's ongoing series of Bibliographies and Indexes in Religious Studies | url = http://bahai-library.com/books/biblio/general.introductory.html | accessdate = 2008-04-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515221056/http://bahai-library.com/books/biblio/general.introductory.html| archivedate= 15 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then translated [[John Esslemont|John Esslemont's]] [[Bahá'í literature#Esslemont, J.E.|Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era]] which drew approving academic review. But there were no other converts to the religion during this early period. Sørensen remained active in her translation work until the community elected a [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] which then held the authority for the community's translating endeavours.

===Period of Pioneers===
[[File:Baha'is at the Danish Embassy.jpg|left|thumb|Baha'i pioneers (circa 1956)]]
Starting in 1946, following [[World War II]], Shoghi Effendi drew up plans for the American (US and Canada) Bahá'í community to send [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] to Europe including Denmark; the pioneers set up a European Teaching Committee chaired by [[Edna True]]. Prominent members of the committee included the women Dagmar Dole and Elenoir Holliboaugh who arrived in Denmark in 1947 and who helped establish Denmark's first Bahá'í community&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; wirh the first converts in Denmark – May Vestby and Palle Bischoff.&lt;ref name="basic"&gt;{{cite book

Many of the early converts were supporters of the [[Det Radikale Venstre]] political party as part of a modern liberal outlook. From 1948 to 1952 thirty eight individuals converted to the Bahá'í Faith and none withdrew. In 1949 the first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] in the country was elected in [[Copenhagen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/light/time-line-bahai.htm |title=Baha'i timeline |accessdate=2008-04-27 |author=Dr. Ahmadi |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517111900/http://bci.org/bahaistudies/courses/light/time-line-bahai.htm |archivedate=17 May 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1950 the Danish community hosted a number of continent-wide European Bahá'í events though still having about 50 Bahá'ís in the community.

==Establishment==
[[File:Berdek71.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Protester strains under weight of Vietnamese flag carried in anti-war march in [[West Berlin]], 1969.]]
In 1960, shortly after the death of Shoghi Effendi and the culminating period of the [[Ten Year Crusade]], which was an international Bahá'í teaching plan, Denmark became the home of some [[Iran]]ian Bahá'ís, increasing the community's population to over 60,&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; and the Danish National Spiritual Assembly was formed in 1962.&lt;ref name="euro"/&gt; In the wake of the 1968-9 cultural changes across Europe including [[youth movements]], [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|war]] and [[environmental issues]] protests.&lt;ref&gt;Rootes, Christopher.

By 1979 the community's progressing organization of assemblies and petitioning, lead to government recognition of the Bahá'í Faith as a legal institution with privileges, including the authority to grant marriages.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt; In 1979 with the [[Iranian Revolution]] and its severe [[persecution of Bahá'ís]], which continues past 2007,&lt;ref name="galindo"&gt;UN Doc.

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482.
Though a small proportion in a nation of over 5 million, yet in 1995 when Denmark hosted the [[United Nations]] [[Commission for Social Development|World Summit for Social Development]] the Bahá'ís participated in an [[NGO]] contribution to the Summit as well as to the [[NGO-Forum]] held alongside.&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Boyles | first = Ann | editors = Bahá'í International Community  | title = The Bahá'í World; Bahá'ís and the Arts: Language of the Heart | date = 1994–1995| pages = 243–272  | url = http://www.bahai.org/library/other-literature/periodicals-supplementary-materials/bahai-world/  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally the Bahá'is of Denmark are an object of academic study by [[University of Copenhagen]] Professor [[Margit Warburg]] and her students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Will C.  | last =  van den Hoonaard  | title = A bibliography of sociological or anthropological studies on the contemporary Baha'i Community | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | pages = see entries 17, 18, 41, 55, 56 | url = http://bahai-library.com/resources/sociology.biblio.html  | accessdate = 2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===

As of 2002 there are local estimates there are some 300 Bahá'ís in Denmark, and the community has also spread beyond Copenhagen into the countryside and rural provinces.

{{Ahmadiyya|Beliefs and practices}}
'''Bai'at''' or '''[[Bay'ah]]''' ({{lang-ar|بَيْعَة}}; pledge, initiation; literally a "sale" or a "transaction")  is an [[Islam]]ic practice of  declaring on oath, one's  allegiance to a particular leader. In an Islamic religious context, this oath is the standard procedure of pledging allegiance to a religious leader. It is known to have been practiced by the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and his [[Rashidun Caliphate|successors]] (caliphs) after him with those wishing to join the Islamic community. Within the [[Sufi]] tradition the term is used to refer to the process of initiation into a Sufi order with the idea of commending oneself to a spiritual master in exchange of the spiritual and moral guidance imparted by him.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://naqshbandi.org/teachings/topics/taking-initiation-bayah/|title=Taking Initiation (Bay`ah)|publisher=Naqshbandi Sufi Way}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bay'ah is a practice that also forms a notable feature within [[Ahmadiyya Islam]]. Following the death of a [[Ahmadiyya Caliphate|Caliph]], the leader of the Community, a pledge of allegiance is taken by the newly chosen Caliph from members of the Community based upon this prophetic model and the bay'ah is the standard procedure for formally joining the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. 

Since 1993, a large Bay'ah is held on an international scale every year during the [[Jalsa Salana|annual gathering]] of the Community. The Bay'ah is taken by the caliph at whose hand new converts pledge their allegiance and old members of the Community can reaffirm their pledges. The Bay'ah comprises the ''[[shahadah]]'', prayers of repentance and a promise to abide by the [[Ten Conditions of Bai'at|Ten Conditions]] stipulated by [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] for joining the Community.

== Bay'ah (Ahmadiyya) ==
[[Image:K5IntlBaiat.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mirza Masroor Ahmad|Khalifatul Masih V]] at the International Bay'ah Ceremony 2007 wearing the green coat of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]].]]
The concept of ''bay'ah'' is considered very important to [[Ahmadi]] Muslims. [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], after claiming to be divinely appointed as the [[Mujaddid|renewer]] of Islam, took the first ''bay'ah'' in 1889 at [[Ludhiana]]. After this, many individuals travelled long distances to [[Qadian]] to be initiated in the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. The practice was continued by his successors.

The tradition was originally started by the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] and continued by the [[Rightly Guided Caliph|4 Caliphs]] after him.

=== International Bay'at ===
In 1993 [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]], the fourth Ahmadiyya [[Caliph]], internationalised the ''Bay'ah'' through [[Muslim Television Ahmadiyya International]] (MTA) by which people from all over the world were now able to partake in this pledge which would be simultaneously translated into 12 different languages. Since then, The international oath of allegiance has taken place every year at the annual gatherings.  Ahmad often claimed that this was the historical fulfillment of the [[Pentecost]] that was destined to occur at the time of the [[Second Coming]].&lt;ref&gt;First International Baiat, Jalsa Salana 1 August 1993 {{YouTube|f2GFAjUUNfU|First International Baiat, Jalsa Salana 1 August 1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Distinctive features ====
Since the first International Bay'ah, some acts have become part of the tradition during the ceremony. Foremost, the caliph wears a green coat of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad at the ceremony. This coat was lent to the fourth caliph for this ceremony by his sister. However, the coat was given to the caliphate at the request of the fifth caliph, [[Mirza Masroor Ahmad]]. 

The members of the community form five or seven lines in front of the caliph at the ceremony to represent the five/seven continents of the world. Officials of the community organisation and other people who have worked for the community or are otherwise selected for this ceremony are present in these lines. The lines proceed to some extent in an orderly manner after which other members are present. Members of the community all over the world join the ceremony live through TV coverage by the community's own satellite channel MTA. The members and those who want to become members place their hands on the back of the person in their front, as is known from the tradition of the early [[Muslim]]s at the time of [[Muhammad]], and so form chains of physical contact with the caliph. This physical contact is seen necessary only for those present at the ceremony. 

The oath of allegiance or Bay'ah is taken by the caliph in the following way: first he reads a sentence or a part of a sentence from the oath in [[Arabic]] and then in [[Urdu]] or [[English language|English]], which the members of the community repeat after him. The wording contains the ''[[shahadah]]'', prayers of repentance and involves a promise to abide by the [[Ten Conditions of Bai'at]] as stipulated by Ghulam Ahmad. Then the same sentence or part of the sentence is repeated by translators in many languages of the world simultaneously and repeated by the members of the community. 

After having gone through the whole text of the oath of allegiance in this manner, the caliph leads the members in silent prayers. At the end, all members of the congregation, which includes those participating around the world, [[Sujud#Sajdah of thankfulness|prostrate]] themselves as an expression of gratitude towards God. This prostration is not directed in any particular direction and is performed in whichever direction one finds suitable but it is led by the caliph,. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZB-ispKLSLo Khilafat Centenary Jalsa UK - International Ba'it 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number of converts ===
The year by year count of converts worldwide, in accordance with the reports announced by the Caliph at the occasion of the International Bai'at and printed officially by the community are as follows:

'''Bodo Brahma Dharma''' was a [[new religious movement]] agitated by ''Gurudev'' [[Kalicharan Brahma]] in the early 20th century in [[Dhubri]] District of [[Assam]] among the [[Bodo people]] after initiation in the [[Brahmo]] faith and the teachings of the Adi Brahmo ''Parambrahma'' in 1906 at [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] and assisted by [[Rupnath Brahma]].  The religion tried to reform some of the traditional customs of Bodo society and reform the [[Bathouism]] (an animist doctrine)  and opposed Christianity and missionaries amongst the marginalised communities of lower plains of holy Brahmaputra river. The Adi Dharma of [[Brahmo Samaj]] successfully kept many indigenous marginalised communities out of Christianity during Colonial rule.

==Social conditions of Bodo before Brahma Dharma==
The Bodo indigenous people were followers of the [[Bathouism]] which was based on the worship of Bathow.  The Bodos ate pork, chicken and brewed and drank the rice beer ''zou'' .

==Brahma dharma teachings==
[[Kalicharan Brahma]] (then Kalicharan Mech) agitated the [[Brahmo religion]] to unify and reform Bodo society to meet these challenges.  He was initiated into the religious significance of Adi Brahmo ''Parambrahma'' in 1906 and began his program of social and religious reform of Bodo society.  Based on the Adi Brahmo [[Trust deed of Brahmo Sabha]], he did away with worship of various deities and animal sacrifices and in its place instituted the burning of ''ahuti'', which was similar to the Hindu ''[[homa (ritual)|homa]]''.  He preached against rearing of pigs, fowl birds and brewing of the rice beer.  To carry forward his teachings, he established the Bodo Mahasabha.

Many Bodos who followed [[Brahmo Dharma]] started using [[Assamese language|Assamese]] of [[Gunabhiram Barua]] in favor of the [[Bodo language]].  In 1911, the title ''Brahma'' was formally accepted as the last name of the follower of this religion.

==At present==
The Brahma Dharma did not become the predominant religion of the Bodos, but it has remained as an important Bodo institution. Under the Brahma Dharma, the Bodos found their first national awakening and consolidation. Some of the followers of Brahma Dharma (Joynarayan Basumatari, [[Satish Chandra Basumatary]]), incorporated Bathou back into the religion without the associated traditional forms of worship.

Due to Brahma Dharma's insistence on education, most of the intellectual leaders of the Bodo society belong to the class created by the Brahma Dharma.

'''Celtic Wicca''' is a modern tradition of [[Wicca]] that incorporates some elements of [[Celtic mythology]].&lt;ref name=McColman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Raeburn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hutton /&gt; It employs the same basic theology, rituals and beliefs as most other forms of Wicca.&lt;ref name=McColman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Raeburn /&gt; Celtic Wiccans use the names of Celtic [[List of Celtic deities|deities]], [[Celtic mythology|mythological figures]], and [[Wheel of the Year|seasonal festivals]] within a Wiccan ritual structure and belief system,&lt;ref name=McColman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Grimassi /&gt; rather than a traditional or historically [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic one]].&lt;ref name=Hutton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Greer /&gt;

== Origins ==
[[Wicca]], as established by Englishman [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref name=Hutton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Greer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt; was not Celtic in nature but contained some Celtic influences and borrowings from Celtic sources.&lt;ref name=McColman /&gt; "Celtic" Wicca can be seen as emphasizing and elaborating on the facets of [[Gardnerian Wicca]] that practitioners believe to be Celtic, while de-emphasizing some of the more obviously non-Celtic facets (such as the worship of deities from other cultures).&lt;ref name=McColman /&gt;&lt;ref name=Raeburn /&gt;  Author Jane Raeburn believes that while there is "a firm distinction between historical Celtic inspiration and modern Wiccan practice", that the two can be blended to form "a living path of ethical and spiritual growth".&lt;ref name=Raeburn /&gt; As Carl McColman has observed, many people find beauty and meaning in this spirituality that blends "religious witchcraft with Celtic wisdom".&lt;ref name=McColman /&gt;

Several different variations of the tradition have existed.  For instance, Lady Sheba (Jessie Bell) called her tradition "American Celtic Wicca".&lt;ref name=Arnold /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sheba1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Sheba2 /&gt;  [[Gavin Frost]] and [[Yvonne Frost]] of the [[Church and School of Wicca]] called their tradition "Celtic Wicca" and followers of this tradition identify as Celtic Wiccans.&lt;ref name=pagans.org /&gt;&lt;ref name=Frost /&gt;   Additionally, numerous [[Eclectic Wicca]]n groups and individuals incorporate what they believe to be Celtic features and self-identify as Celtic Wiccans or [[Celtic Neopaganism|Celtic Neopagans]].&lt;ref name=Raeburn /&gt;&lt;ref name=Conway /&gt;

==Comparisons to other traditions==
Celtic Wicca can be seen as both a form of Wicca and a branch of [[Celtic Neopaganism]].&lt;ref name=McColman /&gt; On the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] continuum from eclectic to [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructionist]], Celtic Wicca is at the eclectic end: as non-historical as most forms of [[Neo-druidism]],&lt;ref name=Hutton2 /&gt; and contrasting firmly with [[Celtic Reconstructionism]], which emphasizes cultural focus and historical accuracy.&lt;ref name=Gallagher /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Celtic Wicca is criticized for a number of reasons.  Critics point to the very recent development of the "tradition", its modernly syncretic nature, its [[Cultural appropriation|misappropriation]] or misrepresentation of authentic Celtic traditions and history, and its difference from all historically attested Celtic beliefs and practices.&lt;ref name=Hutton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Greer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hutton2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hautin-Mayer&gt;{{cite web | first=Joanna | last=Hautin-Mayer | title=When is a Celt not a Celt? | url=http://www.cyberwitch.com/wychwood/Library/whenIsACeltNotACelt.htm | accessdate=2006-11-18 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006005343/http://www.cyberwitch.com/wychwood/Library/whenIsACeltNotACelt.htm | archivedate=2006-10-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Authors including [[Ronald Hutton]], [[Aidan Kelly]], John Michael Greer and Gordon Cooper have noted that Celtic Wicca draws on mythology by way of the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[Celtic Revival]] rather than historical fact.&lt;ref name=Hutton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Greer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hutton2 /&gt; Further, these authors have documented that Gardnerian Wicca was synthesized from elements of many cultures and traditions including [[Hinduism]], [[English folklore]], romanticized misinterpretations of what Gardner believed to be [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] beliefs and ceremonies,&lt;ref name=Greer /&gt; and the ritual structures and terminology used by the [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]].&lt;ref name=Hutton /&gt;&lt;ref name=Greer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kelly /&gt; Greer and Cooper specifically point to Gardner's involvement in the English [[Woodcraft Indians|Woodcraft]] and [[Kibbo Kift]] groups as a strong influence.&lt;ref name=Greer /&gt;

'''''Condemned 2: Bloodshot''''' (titled '''''Condemned 2''''' in Australia, Europe and Asia) is a [[psychological horror|psychological]] [[survival horror]] video game, developed by [[Monolith Productions]] and published by [[Sega]] and [[Warner Bros. Games]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] video game consoles. It is the sequel to the 2005 game ''[[Condemned: Criminal Origins]]''. Due to its violent content, the game was indexed in [[Germany]] by the [[Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons|BPjM]] in April 2008 and subsequently banned in October 2008.

[[Greg Grunberg]] does not reprise his role as Ethan Thomas in ''Condemned 2''. Instead, Ethan is voiced by [[André Sogliuzzo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dunham |first=Jeremy |date=June 4, 2007 |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/06/05/condemned-2-qa |title=Condemned 2 Q&amp;A |website=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |accessdate=June 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==

===Single-player===
''Condemned 2: Bloodshot'' is a psychological horror video game from a first-person perspective focused on melee-oriented combat. The game features bare-fisted hand-to-hand combat, combat with melee weapons, and [[First person shooter|first person shooting]]. The game also has [[adventure game]] elements in the forensic investigation of crime scenes.

Unlike the first game, ''Condemned 2'' allows for hand-to-hand combat with the player's bare fists, with the left and right triggers controlling the player character's left and right fist respectively.&lt;ref name=EuroG&gt;{{cite web |last=Reed |first=Kristan |date=March 20, 2008 |url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/condemned-2-bloodshot-review |title=Condemned 2: Bloodshot (Xbox 360) |website=[[Eurogamer]] |publisher=Gamer Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the player is now able to chain together attack combos, as well as perform various finishing moves executed via [[quick time event]]s. The game also features [[Context sensitive user interface|context-sensitive]] "environmental kills" (such as shoving an enemy's head into a TV or a spiked wall).

Like the original game, the sequel also features melee weapons and firearms. However, melee weapons now break after several strikes or blocks, forcing the player to be adept at resorting to the new hand-to-hand combat system. As in the original game, firearms are limited to the bullets in the current magazine, as the player is unable to carry additional ammo (although they can reload their current magazine by picking up spare ammo lying on the ground). An additional twist to the firearms combat is Ethan's alcoholism, which causes his aim to become blurry and unsteady unless he regularly drinks alcohol. Firearms combat is more prevalent in ''Condemned 2'' than in the original game, with a few levels focused on firefights with [[assault rifle]]-wielding enemies.

The game also features more in-depth forensic investigation gameplay.&lt;ref name=EuroG /&gt; Players are able to investigate and catalog different elements of a crime scene, and make statements about the nature of the crime. Correctly guessing the nature of the crime earns the player a better ranking, which can lead to upgrades such as brass knuckles or body armor. Also featured are several "Bloodshot Fight Club" maps, which are action-based levels independent of the game's plot.

''Condemned 2'' contains new powers for Ethan to use. His "instinct" powers are all but completely scrapped in this episode, however some useful combat abilities come into play. By building up a combo meter, Ethan can perform powerful "Chain Combos" that begin a short sequence requiring well-timed or rapidly placed button presses in order to deal massive damage. Later in the game, Ethan gains the power of the "Voice". This power allows him to produce a powerful shockwave from his mouth that can blast open doors, explode enemy heads, and destroy Oro "headpieces".

===Multiplayer===
''Condemned 2'' features [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] gameplay. There are nine maps in total depending on the game mode being played. The game supports 8 players online and features four multiplayer modes:

* Deathmatch &amp;ndash; the player to reach the kill limit or the player with the most kills at the end of the time limit wins.
* Team Deathmatch &amp;ndash; two teams of multiple players compete for the most kills.
* Bum Rush &amp;ndash; a time-based game of SCU Agents versus Influenced bums. The SCU cannot respawn but get to use guns, have a lot more health and kill with one shot or melee, and must last as long as possible against the bums.
* Crime Scenes &amp;ndash; another game type putting the SCU agents against the Influenced. The Influenced must hide two cases of evidence, while the SCU agents must use their equipment to find and scan the evidence before time runs out.

==Plot==
''Condemned 2: Bloodshot'' takes place 11 months after the events of the first ''[[Condemned: Criminal Origins|Condemned]]''. The mysterious phenomenon causing insane violence and [[Folie à deux|mass psychosis]] amongst Metro City's homeless population has only gotten worse, with massive riots breaking out across the city. Protagonist Ethan Thomas, having resigned from the [[FBI]]'s Serial Crime Unit after the events of the [[Serial Killer X]] investigation, has been caught in a downward spiral and now finds himself homeless, violent, and an alcoholic. He still suffers from paranormal visions, and his alcoholism even manifests as an antagonistic alter-ego that taunts him during his hallucinations.

Under the orders of Director Farrell, Ethan is recruited back into the SCU to investigate the murder of his one-time mentor Malcolm Vanhorn. He is aided by his old partner Rosa and commanded by the hostile and antagonistic Agent Dorland, SCU's tactical commander. Over the course of Ethan's investigation, he discovers that his nemesis Serial Killer X is still alive, having been nursed back to health by his uncle Malcolm Vanhorn after being shot in the head at the end of the original ''Condemned''. Serial Killer X killed Malcolm Vanhorn, as well as Metro City's Mayor Rachel Mars, and eventually kidnaps Director Farrell.

Ethan and Rosa also discover the source of all the city's troubles is a secret organization known as "the Oro", the cult hinted at in the first ''Condemned'', whose members use painful metal implants to develop sonic powers that allow them to influence and control the rest of humanity. Rosa theorizes that they are the source of all humanity's crimes, wars, and hatred.

Serial Killer X, having learned about the Oro, now wants to harness their sonic ability, and is currently killing and dissecting Oro members to obtain this ability. The Oro are much more powerful than previously thought; their members include many high-ranking members of society, including Mayor Mars, Director Farrell, and Agent Dorland. The Oro also control the SCU, and Dorland and his tactical teams attempt to kill Ethan when he discovers their secret. Ethan fights back with the help of Rosa and SCU Agent Pierce LeRue, and even Serial Killer X, who saves Ethan from the SCU, calling it "a future investment".

Malcolm Vanhorn, who has spent his life battling the Oro, leaves Ethan a videotaped message revealing the final truth; Ethan's parents were Oro members who defected from the organization and were killed for it. Ethan himself is "the Remedy", a long-prophesied being possessing "perfectly evolved" vocal cords capable of generating the Oro's sonic power without the metal implants the Oro use. Ethan's ability is more powerful than the Oros, capable of destroying flesh and bone. The Remedy is destined to be "the voice opposing that of the Oro". As a result, Agent Dorland and the Oro want Ethan dead. Director Farrell, part of a splinter faction of Oro that wants to recruit rather than destroy Ethan, sacrifices his life to unlock Ethan's sonic powers after the two of them are cornered by Agent Dorland.

Ethan proceeds to the Peninsula, an artificial landmass where the Oro have a secret base from where they monitor and control the entire city. Using his newfound sonic powers, Ethan defeats the Oro members, destroys the Oro machinery allowing them to control the city, then battles Dorland in a sonic duel within the collapsing Peninsula. Defeated, Dorland informs Ethan that the Oro's motives are "To create hostility, the unwavering desire to fight. To unknowingly become... our protectors." Ethan asks what they are protecting against, receiving no reply. Ethan then concludes that Dorland doesn't know it himself, that he is nothing more than a puppet, and the former commander is flung to his death. Ethan escapes in a helicopter along with Rosa and LeRue, declining LeRue's offer of a drink and falling asleep. Meanwhile, the [[President of the United States]] suffers an apparent heart attack after receiving the message "The Remedy is among us!", suggesting that the President was a member of the Oro.
Finally, Serial Killer X is shown receiving Oro metal implants in his mouth, similar in appearance to the Oro Dark Primary, the "[[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]]" Oro member Ethan fought and killed at the end of the first ''Condemned''.

''Condemned 2: Bloodshot'' received "favorable" reviews on both platforms according to the [[Review aggregator|review aggregation]] website [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name=MCPS3 /&gt;&lt;ref name=MCX360 /&gt; ''[[Official Xbox Magazine]]'' praised the areas of atmosphere, graphics and sound for the game, and found it to be improved in almost all aspects over the original. The review did, however, find the ending to be weak and one of its major downsides.&lt;ref name=OXM /&gt; The three reviewers in ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' praised the Xbox 360 version's atmosphere and improved combat system, but were not satisfied with the "laggy, unnecessary feel" of the game's multiplayer component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=EGM staff |title=Condemned 2: Bloodshot |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |publisher=Ziff Davis |issue=227 |date=April 2008 |page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' said that the same console version had lost the first game's tight storyline in favor of a deranged psychotic bloodbath, in which guns and gore "occur anywhere and everywhere to ever-decreasing effect" and had taken precedence over the tension and fear factors which the magazine had enjoyed in the previous title. In a caption the review expressed surprise that "you can [...] make enemy heads explode by shouting at them" and noted that they did not expect that "the [[ABC Warriors]] would appear in the game's final act, and that you'd take them down with a sonic crossbow and giant magnet."&lt;ref name=Edge /&gt;

411Mania gave the Xbox 360 version an 8.7 out of 10 and said it was "a game that encourages you to think outside the box and use some strategy and smarts while challenging you to stay alive in hopes of bringing your city back to sanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Aranda |first=Ramon |date=April 4, 2008 |url=http://www.411mania.com/games/reviews/72433 |title=Condemned 2: Bloodshot (Xbox 360) Review |website=411Mania |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406130519/http://www.411mania.com/games/reviews/72433 |archivedate=April 6, 2008 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' gave the game a score of eight stars out of ten and said that it "has plenty of creepy moments, but it favors action over atmosphere. To that end it performs very well, and even throws in some juicy plot twists and a cliffhanger ending. But I miss the tension of the original, just the same."&lt;ref name=Wired /&gt; ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' gave the Xbox 360 version a B− and called it "A series of amazing shocks that are never quite worthy of suspension of disbelief."&lt;ref name=AVClub /&gt;

==Future==
Rumors about a sequel have circulated since ''Condemned 2''{{'}}s release; however, it had been doubtful that a ''Condemned 3'' would ever occur. One of the Condemned series' previous developers stated in an interview with video game website [[NeoGAF]], "Sadly it will never happen. ''Condemned 2'' just didn't sell enough copies. It is sad that ''Condemned 2'' got caught up in the 'everything needs multiplayer'. We could have really used the staff on multiplayer to make the single player campaign amazing. There was some good ideas of where to take the game. I've always wanted to do a reboot and just play ''Condemned 2'' off as a bad hangover and have Thomas closer to what he was in [''Condemned: Criminal Origins'']."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.neogaf.com/threads/lttp-condemned-criminal-origins-spoilers.454223/#post-36410544 |title=LTTP: Condemned: Criminal Origins (spoilers) |website=[[NeoGAF]] |date=March 27, 2012 |accessdate=June 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monolith co-founder and former CEO [[Jace Hall]] currently holds the rights to the ''Condemned'' series and on January 31, 2015, he expressed his interest on [[Facebook]] to find the right indie development team to "take over the franchise and move it forward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hall |first=Jace |date=January 31, 2015 |url=https://www.facebook.com/JaceHallShow/posts/10152999663109303 |title=Deep thought..and question... |website=[[Facebook]] |accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3164">'''Claud Dennis McKinsey''' (March 5, 1940 &amp;ndash; June 23, 2009 in [[Ohio]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/dispatch/obituary.aspx?n=claud-dennis-mckinsey&amp;pid=128922877 Obituary - Claud Dennis McKinsey]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] [[atheist]] and author of works on the subject of [[Biblical inerrancy]] from a critical perspective.

==Biography==
McKinsey obtained a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[philosophy]] in 1962 and a [[master's degree]] in the [[social sciences]] in 1964 from the [[University of Indiana]]. He taught social studies full-time at the secondary level for ten years. He was a community college instructor in sociology and a secondary guidance counselor for the [[London City School District]].  For brief periods he was a civil rights investigator, a truant officer, and a government researcher.

McKinsey was highly skeptical of claims from the [[Bible]] which he believed contained many errors, contradictions, and fallacies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/229598/the-encyclopedia-of-biblical-errancy-by-c-dennis-mckinsey/9780879759261/ "The Encyclopedia of Biblical Errancy"]. Retrieved 22 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He authored ''The Encyclopedia of Biblical Errancy'' (1995) and ''Biblical Errancy: A Reference Guide'' (2000). He also wrote and published a monthly periodical known as ''Biblical Errancy'' from 1982 to 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freethoughtassociation.org/eNews/200611/meeting-biblefallacies.html "Don’t Miss “Errors, Contradictions and Fallacies in the Bible”"]. Freethought Association of West Michigan. Retrieved 22 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was an advocate of the [[Christ myth theory]]. McKinsey wrote that "Jesus is a mythical figure in the tradition of pagan mythology and almost nothing in all of ancient literature would lead one to believe otherwise. Anyone wanting to believe Jesus lived and walked as a real live human being must do so despite the evidence, not because of it."&lt;ref&gt;McKinsey, Dennis. (1995). ''The Encyclopedia of Biblical Errancy''. Prometheus Books. p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==

McKinsey identified as a [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]]. He authored the book ''The Relevance of Marxism'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.ca/books/about/The_Relevance_of_Marxism.html?id=xQKjGwAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a Buryat sky-god who rules over the western [[horizon]]. His son is [[Solobung Yubin]], a spiritual morning [[star]] which, if offered sacrifices, will reward the [[Mongol]] people with greater harvest yields and prosperity.

As chief of the sky-spirits, Esege Malaan calls meetings of them "in the [[Pleiadeans|Pleiades]] and on the moon".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newdawnbooks.info/Reviews/CHOSEN_BY_THE_SPIRITS.html Sarangerel (Julie Ann Stewart), Chosen by the Spirits : Following Your Shamanic Calling.]&lt;/ref&gt; Esege is a bald god.&lt;ref&gt;Türk Söylence Sözlüğü (Turkish Mythological Dictionary), Deniz Karakurt, [[:tr:Türk Söylence Sözlüğü|(OTRS: CC BY-SA 3.0)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation of Earth==

In the beginning of Universe there were only Esege Malan, the highest god. Everywhere was dark and silent. There was nothing to be seen. Esege took up a handful of earth and made the sun and moon. Then he made all plants. Esege divided the earth into East and West. Gave it to the highest order of gods.

==Esege and Mother Earth==

After all things Mother Earth, went to visit him. They spent several days. When she was ready to go, she asked to give her the sun and the moon. But he soon found that it was very difficult to get them for her. Then Esege Malan sent for the hedgehog ''Esh''. It went up to the Tenger (sky) to the dwelling of Esege Malan.

'''Farley Green''' is a small hamlet of [[Albury, Surrey|Albury]]  in the [[Greensand Ridge]] where it forms the south of the [[Surrey Hills AONB]], to the south east of [[Guildford]].

==History==
On the outskirts of Farley Green, lies Farley Heath where one of Surrey's few Roman remains, a temple, can be found. The open heathland was the site of the largest [[Romano-British]] settlement in [[Surrey]].

The site was excavated by [[Martin Tupper]], an antiquarian and poet, who lived in nearby [[Albury, Surrey|Albury]]. Some of his finds are now housed in the [[British Museum]]. A [[Romano-Celtic Temple]] was in use some time before the end of the 1st century AD and was believed to be destroyed by fire around 450 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=393929 |title=PastScape Entry for Farley Roman Temple |publisher=English Heritage |year=2007 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outline of the temple can still be seen and is marked out by stones set in concrete.

==Topography==
The village houses spread mostly along Shophouse Lane which then becomes steep and narrow towards [[Winterfold Forest]] which ascends to more than 200 metres [[Above Ordnance Datum]].  The forest which climbs right to the summit of the Greensand Ridge is part of the [[Peaslake#Hurtwood|Hurtwood]] and is where some of the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbery]] proceeds were discovered, buried.   The whole undulating area covering the south of Albury parish had been the haunt of smugglers in the distant past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegoodmoveguide.com/Locations/Surrey/Boroughs/Guildford/Guides/villages/farleygreen.htm The Good Move guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929221659/http://www.thegoodmoveguide.com/Locations/Surrey/Boroughs/Guildford/Guides/villages/farleygreen.htm |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hamlet has its own [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] chapel, dedicated to [[St Michael]], which is in a 19th-century barn built by the Albury Estate. It was later sold and the widow gave the barn to Albury parish.&lt;ref name="VillageChurches"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guildford.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=6261&amp;p=0 |title=Village Churches |format=PDF |year=2014 |publisher=Guildford Borough Council |accessdate=23 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6O4qy51NN?url=http://www.guildford.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=6261&amp;p=0 |archivedate=14 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edgeley Caravan Park is located off the main road in landscaped grounds.

A '''gnome''' {{IPAc-en|n|oʊ|m}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|Gnome}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a diminutive spirit in [[Renaissance magic]] and [[alchemy]], first introduced by [[Paracelsus]] in the 16th century and later adopted by more recent authors including those of modern fantasy literature. Its characteristics have been reinterpreted to suit the needs of various story tellers, but it is typically said to be a small [[humanoid]] that lives underground.&lt;ref name="ebo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037122/gnome |title=Gnome |work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |accessdate=12 March 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417103944/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9037122/gnome |archivedate=17 April 2008 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
The word comes from [[Renaissance Latin]] ''gnomus'', which first appears in the ''Ex Libro de Nymphis, Sylvanis, Pygmaeis, Salamandris et Gigantibus, etc'' by [[Paracelsus]], published posthumously in [[Nysa, Poland|Nysa]] in 1566 (and again in the Johannes Huser edition of 1589&amp;ndash;1591 from an autograph by Paracelsus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ex Libro de Nymphis, Sylvanis, Pygmaeis, Salamandris et Gigantibus, etc |author=[[Paracelsus]] |publisher=Ioannes Cruciger |location=[[Nysa, Poland|Nissae Silesiorum]] |date=1566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term  may  be an original invention of Paracelsus, possibly deriving the term from Latin ''gēnomos'' (itself representing a Greek {{lang|grc|γη-νομος}}, literally "earth-dweller"). In this case, the omission of the ''ē'' is, as the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED) calls it, a blunder. Paracelsus uses ''Gnomi'' as a synonym of ''[[Pygmæi]]'' and classifies them as earth [[elemental]]s. He describes them as two [[span (unit)|spans]] high, very reluctant to interact with humans, and able to move through solid earth as easily as humans move through air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Discarded Image - An Introduction to Medieval and Renaissance Literature |publisher=Cambridge University Press |first=C. S. |last=Lewis |authorlink=C. S. Lewis |page=135 |year=1964 |isbn=0-521-47735-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[chthonic]], or earth-dwelling, spirit has precedents in numerous ancient and medieval mythologies, often guarding mines and precious underground treasures, notably in the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]] and the Greek [[Chalybes]], [[Telchines]] or [[Dactyl (mythology)|Dactyls]].&lt;ref name="ebo" /&gt;

===In Romanticism and modern fairy tales===
[[File:CarlSpitzwegGnomEisenbahnbetrachtend.jpg|thumb|upright|''Gnome watching railway train'', [[Carl Spitzweg]], 1848]]

The English word is attested from the early 18th century. Gnomes are used in [[Alexander Pope]]'s "[[The Rape of the Lock]]". The creatures from this mock-epic are small, celestial creatures which were prudish women in their past-lives, and now spend all of eternity looking out for prudish women (in parallel to the guardian angels in Catholic belief). Other uses of the term ''gnome'' remain obscure until the early 19th century, when it is taken up by authors of [[Romanticist]] collections of [[fairy tale]]s and becomes mostly synonymous with the older word ''[[goblin]]''.

Pope's stated source, the French satire ''[[Comte de Gabalis]]'' (1670), used the term ''gnomide'' to refer to female gnomes (often "gnomid" in English translations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://sacred-texts.com/eso/cdg/index.htm |title=Comte de Gabalis |publisher=The Brothers, Old Bourne Press |location=London |first=N.-P.-H. |last=de Montfaucon de Villars |date=1913 |origyear=1670 |oclc=6624965 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150513012258/http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/cdg/index.htm |archivedate=13 May 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of this work, [[Nicolas-Pierre-Henri de Montfaucon de Villars]], the abbot of Villars, describes gnomes as such:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Earth is filled almost to the Center with ''Gnomes'' or ''Pharyes'', a People of small Stature, the Guardians of Treasures, of Mines, and of Precious Stones. They are Ingenious, Friends of Men, and easie to be commandded. They furnish the Children of the ''Sages'' with as much Money, as they have need of; and never ask any other Reward of their Services, than the Glory of being Commanded. The ''Gnomides'' or Wives of these ''Gnomes'' or ''Pharyes'', are Little, but very Handson; and their Habit marvellously Curious."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;res_id=xri:eebo&amp;rft_id=xri:eebo:image:199577 |title=The Count of Gabalis: Or, The Extravagant Mysteries of the Cabalists, Exposed in Five Pleasant Discourses on the Secret Sciences |publisher=B.

A. |translator-last=Gent |pages=29-30 |date=1680 |oclc=992499594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 19th century fiction, the [[chthonic]] gnome became a sort of antithesis to the more airy or luminous [[fairy]]. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] in ''[[Twice-Told Tales]]'' (1837) contrasts the two in "Small enough to be king of the fairies, and ugly enough to be king of the gnomes" (cited after [[OED]]). Similarly, gnomes are contrasted to [[elf|elves]], as in [[William Cullen Bryant]]'s ''Little People of the Snow'' (1877), which has "let us have a tale of elves that ride by night, with jingling reins, or gnomes of the mine" (cited after [[OED]]).

One of the first movements in [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky's]] 1874 work ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', named "Gnomus" ([[Latin]] for "The Gnome"), is written to sound as if a gnome is moving about, his movements constantly changing in speed.{{listen|type=music|filename=Modest Mussorgsky - pictures at an exhibition - i. gnomus - vivo.ogg|title=Gnomus|description=|format=[[ogg]]|help=no}}
[[Franz Hartmann]] in 1895 satirized [[materialism]] in an allegorical tale entitled ''Unter den Gnomen im Untersberg''. The English translation appeared in 1896 as ''Among the Gnomes: An Occult Tale of Adventure in the Untersberg''. In this story, the ''Gnomes'' are still clearly subterranean creatures, guarding treasures of gold within the [[Untersberg]] mountain.

As a figure of 19th century [[fairy tale]]s, the term gnome became largely synonymous with other terms for "[[little people (mythology)|little people]]" by the 20th century, such as ''[[goblin]]'', ''[[brownie (folklore)|brownie]]'', ''[[kobold]]'', ''[[leprechaun]]'', ''[[Heinzelmännchen]]'' and other instances of the "[[domestic spirit]]" type, losing its strict association with earth or the underground world.

==Cultural references==
===Modern fantasy literature===
* Creatures called ''gnomes'' have been used in the [[fantasy]] genre of fiction and later gaming since the mid-nineteenth century, typically in a cunning role, e.g. as an inventor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]] |chapter=Elemental |publisher=St. Martin's Griffin |location=New York |first1=John |last1=Clute |first2=John |last2=Grant |pages=313–314 |date=1999 |isbn=0-312-19869-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[L. Frank Baum]]'s [[List of Oz books|Oz]] series (created 1900 to 1914), the Nomes (so spelled), especially [[Nome King|their king]], are the chief adversaries of the Oz people. They are ugly, hot-tempered, immortal, round-bodied with spindly legs and arms, have long beards and wild hair, live underground, and are the militant protectors/hoarders of jewels and precious metals. Baum does not depict any female gnomes. [[Ruth Plumly Thompson]], who continued the series (1972 to 1976) after Baum's death, reverted to the traditional spelling.
** L. Frank Baum also featured the classical gnomes in his book ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]''. They are in charge of watching over the rocks and their king is part of the Council of Immortals. In addition, they also created the sleigh bells for [[Santa Claus]]' [[Santa Claus's reindeer|reindeer]].
* [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], in the [[Tolkien's legendarium|legendarium]] (created 1914 to 1973) surrounding his [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elves]], uses "Gnomes" as the initial and later dropped name of the [[Noldor]], the most gifted and technologically minded of his elvish races, in conscious exploitation of the similarity with the word ''[[:wikt:gnomic|gnomic]]''. ''Gnome'' is thus Tolkien's English loan-translation of the [[Quenya]] word ''Noldo'' (plural ''Noldor''), "those with knowledge". Tolkien's "Gnomes" are generally tall, beautiful, dark-haired, light-skinned, immortal, and typically wise but suffer from pride, tend towards violence, and have an overweening love of the works of their own hands, particularly gemstones. Many of them live in cities below ground ([[Nargothrond]]) or in secluded mountain fortresses ([[Gondolin]]). He uses "Gnomes" to refer to both males and females. In ''[[The Father Christmas Letters]]'' (between 1920 and 1942), which Tolkien wrote for his children, Red Gnomes are presented as helpful creatures who come from Norway to the North Pole to assist Father Christmas and his Elves in fighting the wicked Goblins.
* [[Denys Watkins-Pitchford|BB's]] ''[[The Little Grey Men]]'' (1942) is a story of the last gnomes in England, little wild men who live by hunting and fishing.
* In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Narnia]]'' (created 1950 to 1956), the gnomes are sometimes called "Earthmen". live in the [[Underland (Narnia)|Underland]], a series of subterranean caverns. Unlike the traditional, more human-like gnomes, they can have a wide variety of physical features and skin colours. They are used as slaves by the [[Lady of the Green Kirtle]].
* The Dutch books ''[[Gnomes (book)|Gnomes]]'' (1976) and ''[[The Secret Book of Gnomes]]'' (1984), written by [[Wil Huygen]], deal with gnomes living together in harmony. These same books are the basis for [[Gnomes (film)|a made-for-TV animated film]] and the Spanish-animated series ''[[The World of David the Gnome]]'' (as well as the spin-off ''[[Wisdom of the Gnomes]]''). The word "gnome", in this case, is used in place of the Dutch [[kabouter]].
* In the ''[[Warcraft]]'' franchise (1994 to present), particularly as featured in the [[MMORPG]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', [[Races and factions of Warcraft#Gnomes|gnomes]] are a race of beings separate from but [[Races and factions of Warcraft#The Alliance|allied]] to dwarves and humans, with whom they share the lands of the Eastern Kingdoms. Crafty, intelligent, and smaller than their dwarven brethren, gnomes are one of two races in Azeroth regarded as technologically savvy. It is suggested in lore that the gnomes originally were mechanical creations that at some point became organic lifeforms. In ''World of Warcraft'', gnomes are an exile race, having irradiated their home city of Gnomeregan in an unsuccessful last-ditch effort to drive out marauding foes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/23/know-your-lore-gnomes-the-inheritors-of-the-future/ |title=Know Your Lore: Gnomes, the inheritors of the future |work=Engadget |last=Rossi |first=Matthew |date=23 April 2014 |accessdate=4 July 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731185111/https://www.engadget.com/2014/04/23/know-your-lore-gnomes-the-inheritors-of-the-future/ |archivedate=31 July 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series (created 1997 to 2007), gnomes are pests that inhabit the gardens of witches and wizards. They are small creatures with heads that look like potatoes on small stubby bodies. Gnomes are generally considered harmless but mischievous and may bite with sharp teeth. In the books, it is stated that the Weasleys are lenient to gnomes, and tolerate their presence, preferring to throw them out of the garden rather than more extreme measures.
* In [[Terry Brooks]]' ''[[Shannara]]'' series (created 1977 to 2017), gnomes are an offshoot race created after the Great Wars. There are several distinctive classes of gnomes. Gnomes are the smallest race. In ''[[The Sword of Shannara]]'' they are considered to be tribal and warlike, the one race that can be the most easily subverted to an evil cause. This is evidenced by their allegiance to the Warlock Lord in ''The Sword of Shannara'' and to the Mord Wraiths in ''[[The Wishsong of Shannara]]''.

===Music===
*"[[The Laughing Gnome]]" is a song by English musician [[David Bowie]], released as a single in 1967. It became a hit when reissued in 1973, in the wake of Bowie's commercial success.
*The 1970 album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' by English musician [[George Harrison]] has a cover image of the musician sitting among a group of garden gnomes.
*"[[The Gnome]]" is a song by [[Pink Floyd]] on their 1967 album ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]''. It is about a gnome named Grimble Gromble.

{{Main|Garden gnome}}
After [[World War II]] (with early references, in ironic use, from the late 1930s) the diminutive figurines introduced as lawn ornaments during the 19th century came to be known as garden gnomes. The image of the gnome changed further during the 1960s to 1970s, when the first plastic garden gnomes were manufactured. These gnomes followed the style of the 1937 depiction of the seven dwarves in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'' by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]. This "[[Disneyfication|Disneyfied]]" image of the gnome was built upon by the illustrated children's book classic ''[[The Secret Book of Gnomes]]'' (1976), in the original Dutch ''Leven en werken van de [[Kabouter]]''. Garden gnomes share a resemblance to the Scandinavian [[nisse (folklore)|tomte and nisse]], and the Swedish term "tomte" can be translated as "gnome" in English.

===Gnome-themed parks===
[[File:Wieliczka-color.jpg|thumb|Gnome garden at the [[Wieliczka Salt Mine]], Poland|alt=]]
Several gnome themed entertainment parks exist. Notable ones are:
* The Gnome Reserve, at [[West Putford]] near [[Bradworthy]] in [[North Devon]], United Kingdom
* Gnomeland, at [[Watermouth Castle]] in [[Berrynarbor]], North Devon, United Kingdom
* Gnome Magic Garden, at Colchester, United Kingdom
* The Gnome Village, at [[Efteling]] theme park in [[Kaatsheuvel]], Netherlands
* Zwergen-Park Trusetal, in [[Trusetal]], Germany

===Garden Gnome Liberationists===
[[Garden gnome liberationists]] such as the Gnome Liberation Front were introduced in France in 1997. They claim that Garden Gnomes deserve the same freedom that any other living creature would have. They are noted to have stolen hundreds of gnomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27539096/gnome-liberation-movement-strikes-boulder |title=Gnome liberation movement strikes Boulder |website=Dailycamera.com |accessdate=8 December 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210182856/http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_27539096/gnome-liberation-movement-strikes-boulder |archivedate=10 December 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/07/12/gnomes.return/ |title=Gnome freedom group strikes again |work=CNN |date=12 July 2001 |accessdate=8 December 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023011221/http://www.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/07/12/gnomes.return/ |archivedate=23 October 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gravel''''' is the name given to a series of [[Limited series (comics)|limited]] and [[ongoing series]] by [[Warren Ellis]], illustrated by [[Mike Wolfer]] and published by [[Avatar Press]].

A number of different [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] have been published under the ''Strange Killings'' banner, all of which centred on British 'combat magician' William Gravel. Most recently these series were republished under the Gravel name, followed by the launch of a new series, ''Gravel''.

'''Gregory the Commander''' was a [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] military leader from the [[House of Mihran]], who denounced [[Zoroastrianism]] and converted to [[Christianity]], but was later as a result executed between 555-562.

== Biography ==
A native of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]], Gregory converted to Christianity in 518 during a feast before many other Sasanian soldiers. However, this didn't bother king [[Khosrau I]] (r. 531-579), who in 534 appointed Gregory as the commander of the Sasanian army in the [[Caucasus]]. However, Khosrau I was eventually forced to dismiss and imprison Gregory after pressure from the court, who stated that "It is a great dishonor for the religion of the [[Magi]]ans that such a great man from the lineage of the house of Mihran, who have always been servants of [[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]], now becomes a servant of [[Christ]]."

However, the Mihranids considered Khosrau's choice insufficient, and wanted Gregory executed; Mihran, the son of Gregory's paternal uncle, asked Khosrau to punish Gregory for "bringing dishonor to our lineage." Mihran had just returned from a successful expedition against the [[Hephthalite Empire|Hephthalites]], and was thus in a great position to request such a favor; Gregory was eventually executed.

[[File:Remus Cernea.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Remus Cernea]], the only avowed atheist [[Parliament of Romania|MEP]]]]
According to a study conducted by researchers from the [[Open Society Foundations|Soros Foundation]], Romanian atheists are a very young group and with a significantly higher level of education that the national average: 53% of atheists are under 30 years, and 33% of them have completed higher education.&lt;ref name="soros"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ziare.com/social/romani/ateii-din-romania-sunt-tineri-educati-si-intoleranti-1127951 |title=Ateii din Romania sunt tineri, educati si intoleranti |work=Ziare.com |date=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group of [[atheism|atheists]]/[[agnosticism|agnostics]]/[[irreligion|persons without religion]] lives in a proportion of 59% in urban areas – in the capital and other major cities – and are easier to find in [[Wallachia]] and harder in [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref name="soros" /&gt;

Atheists are more intolerant than most Romanians with regard to almost all social groups on which were questioned: [[Roma people|Roma]], [[sectarian]]s, [[Hungarians]], [[Muslim]]s, [[Jew]]s, [[poverty|poor]].&lt;ref name="fundatia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundatia.ro/sites/default/files/Ateu%20in%20Romania-analiza%20studiului.pdf |title=Atei în România: puțini, tineri, educați, de dreapta și intoleranți |work=Fundația Soros |author=Ovidiu Voicu |date=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only exception to this string of intolerance is represented by [[gay|homosexuals]], towards them atheists showing more tolerance than the national average.&lt;ref name="fundatia" /&gt; As ideological positioning, atheists declare themselves, equally, both right-wing and left-wing, most of them (56%) placing at the center of the ideological line.

Jediism is inspired by certain elements of ''Star Wars'', namely the fictional religion of the Jedi. Early websites dedicated to bringing up a belief system from the ''Star Wars'' films were "The Jedi Religion and regulations" and "Jediism". These websites cited the Jedi code, consisting of 21 maxims, as the starting point for a "real Jedi" belief system.&lt;ref name=findingforce&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PB57P_dOF7EC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title=Finding the Force in the Star Wars Franchise: Fans, Merchandise, and Critics | publisher=Peter Lang | author=Matthew Wilhelm Kapell|author2= John Shelton Lawrence | year=2006 | isbn=0-8204-6333-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The real-world Jediism movement has no founder or central structure.&lt;ref name="D.Grant2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nancy K.

== Census phenomenon ==
{{Main article|Jedi census phenomenon}}

Jediism received press coverage following a worldwide email campaign in 2001 urging people to write "Jedi" as their answer to the religion classification question in their country's census, resulting in the [[Jedi census phenomenon]]. The majority of such respondents are assumed to have claimed the faith as a joke.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/9737886/Jedi-religion-most-popular-alternative-faith.html|title='Jedi' religion most popular alternative faith|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Henry|last=Taylor|date=2012-12-11|accessdate=2012-12-14|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cusack2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carole M.

== Legal recognition ==

=== United States ===
In 2007, the Temple of the Jedi Order was registered in Texas. However [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] tax exemption wasn't granted until 2015.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.templeofthejediorder.org/library/TotJOMaterials/TotJOIRSExemptionLetterOct15.pdf|title=IRS Determination Letter|first=|date=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
During the drafting of the UK [[Racial and Religious Hatred Act 2006|Racial and Religious Hatred Act]], an amendment was proposed that excluded Jedi Knights from any protection, along with [[Satanist]]s and believers in [[animal sacrifice]]. The amendment was subsequently withdrawn, the proposer explaining that it was "a bit of a joke" to illustrate a point that defining religious belief in legislation is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmstand/e/st050629/pm/50629s01.htm|accessdate=2010-02-22|title=Racial and Religious Hatred Bill|date=2005-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wells|first1=Jonathan|title=Inside the Church of Jediism: what it's like to follow The Force|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/inside-the-church-of-jediism-what-its-like-to-follow-the-force/|accessdate=7 January 2017|publisher=Telegraph|date=2015-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 23-year-old Daniel Jones founded The Church of Jediism with his brother Barney, believing that the 2001 UK census recognised Jediism as a religion, and that there were "more Jedi than Scientologists in Britain".&lt;ref name="Cusack2010" /&gt; In 2009, Jones was removed from a [[Tesco]] supermarket in [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], North Wales, for refusing to remove his hood on a religious basis. The owner justified Jones's ejection by saying, "He hasn't been banned. Jedis are very welcome to shop in our stores although we would ask them to remove their hoods. [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]], [[Yoda]] and [[Luke Skywalker]] all appeared hoodless without ever going over to the [[Dark side (Star Wars)|Dark Side]] and we are only aware of [[Palpatine|the Emperor]] as one who never removed his hood."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/18/jedi-religion-tesco-hood-jones|publisher=The Guardian|title=Jedi religion founder accuses Tesco of discrimination over rules on hoods|accessdate=2011-02-22|first=Helen|last=Carter|location=London|date=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a man who described himself as a "Star Wars follower" and "Jedi Knight" was thrown out of a [[Jobcentre Plus|Jobcentre]] in [[Southend]], [[Essex]], for refusing to remove his hood, and later received an apology. The man said that "The main reason is I want to wear my hood up, and I have got a religion which allows me to do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1258365/Jedi-believer-wins-apology-Jobcentre-kicked-wearing-hood.html|publisher=The Daily Mail|title=Political correctness strikes back: Jedi believer wins apology after being kicked out of Jobcentre for wearing a hood|first=Andrew|last=Levy|date=2010-03-17|accessdate=2011-02-22|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[Free Church of Scotland (post-1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] expressed concern that a proposed [[Marriage and Civil Partnership (Scotland) Bill|Marriage and Civil Partnership bill]] would "lead to Star Wars Jedi marrying couples". Patrick Day-Childs of The Church of Jediism, and Rev Michael Kitchen of Temple of the Jedi Order, both defended the right of Jedi to perform marriage ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, Steven [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-21844467 "Star chores: Do Jedi want to marry people?"], ''[[BBC News]]'', London, 20 March 2013.

Retrieved on 14 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2016, the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]] rejected an application to grant [[Charitable organization#England and Wales|charitable organization]] status to [https://www.templeofthejediorder.org/ The Temple of the Jedi Order], ruling that the group did not "promote moral or ethical improvement" for charity law purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-38368526|title=Jediism not a religion, Charity Commission rules|work=[[BBC News]]|date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===

In April 2015, the students of [[Dokuz Eylül University]] in [[Turkey]] started a petition on [[Change.org]] demanding a Jedi temple be built on the campus. The petition was in response to a previous petition which had demanded a mosque on the campus of [[Istanbul Technical University]] (İTÜ). The petition demanding the mosque reached 180,000 signatures falling short of its 200,000 target and invoked a response from [[Mehmet Karaca]], the [[rector (academia)|rector]] of Istanbul Technical University (İTÜ), promising "a landmark mosque". Soon after, students from other universities started petitions demanding Jedi and Buddhist temples on their campuses.&lt;ref name=CampusJedi&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands of Turkish students sign petition to build Jedi Temple on university campus|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/thousands-of-turkish-students-sign-petition-to-build-jedi-temple-on-university-campus-10161225.html|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=8 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JediTurkey&gt;{{cite news|title=Turkish University students demand Jedi, Buddhist temples amid mosque frenzy|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkish-university-students-demand-jedi-buddhist-temples-amid-mosque-frenzy.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=80634&amp;NewsCatID=341|accessdate=8 April 2015|work=Hurriyet Daily News|date=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth [[aeon]] was called '''Kretha Yukam''', according to [[Ayyavazhi mythology]].The third fragment of [[Kroni]] was, again, made into two siblings called [[Suraparppan]] and [[Sinkamuka Suran]], and they were given responsibility to rule the earth. The wicked rulers began to crush the [[Thevarkal]], who again reported it to Mayon. The Mayon took the form of  [[Arumukan]], the Tamil god, and advised the rulers to desist from their wickedness. But, when they spurned the advice arrogantly, Arumukan eliminated them too. During the same Yukam, Suraparppan was created again as [[Iraniyan]]. Mayon, incarnated as the son of Iraniyan, and  challenged his authority, and finally taking on the [[therianthropic]] form of man and lion by piercing his stomach.  In the death-bed Mayon asked him to repent. But he replied, arrogantly, that you cannot kill me only by placing ten mountains as ten nails you killed me and otherwise you can't.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14274">The [[Catholic Church]] in China comprises
* 21 Latin Catholic ecclesiastical provinces (including one for Taiwan), consisting of 21 Metropolitan archdioceses and 87 suffragan dioceses 
* 30 exempt (i.e. immediately subject to the Holy See) jurisdictions : many (pre-diocesan) apostolic prefectures and the diocese of Macau)

Furthermore, the [[Eastern Catholic]] ([[Byzantine rite]]) [[Russian Greek Catholic Church]] has an exempt Apostolic exarchate for China in Harbin.

There is an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] as papal diplomatic representation (embassy-level) to China, in Taipei, national capital of Taiwan, also charged with PRC, Hongkong and Macau.

The Catholic Church recognizes the Republic of China as the sole government for all of China; nevertheless, it does not recognize all of its territorial claims. The term “China” has to be understood as including Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan in its 1949 provincial boundaries and Mainland China as effectively controlled by the People's Republic of China. Due to the non-recognition of the People's Republic of China, however, the authority of the Taipei-based [[Chinese Regional Bishops' Conference]] is effectively limited to the islands of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. The dioceses of Hong Kong (suffragan of Kanton) and Macao (exempt) do not belong to that conference. The dioceses of Mainland China take part in the Beijing-based Chinese Bishops Conference, which is not recognized by the Holy See.

|Author
|British (English) novelist and journalist, known for her feminist, magical realism and science fiction works.
|"All the mythic versions of women, from the myth of the redeeming purity of the virgin to that of the healing, reconciling mother, are consolatory nonsenses; and consolatory nonsense seems to me a fair definition of myth, anyway. Mother goddesses are just as silly a notion as father gods. If a revival of the myths of these cults gives women emotional satisfaction, it does so at the price of obscuring the real conditions of life. This is why they were invented in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;Angela Carter, ''The Sadeian Woman and the Ideology of Pornography'' (1978) p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Holden Caulfield, as shown below, was used in an unpublished short story written in 1942 and first appeared in print in 1945.

|[[Master Sibrand|Sibrand]]
|''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]''
| In his last words to [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] after the latter dealt with the Teutonic knight with his Hidden Blade and said that he would be safe in the arms of [[God]] soon enough, Sibrand replied that there was nothing waiting for him in the end, not even God or the afterlife, that they did not even exist and that it was the one thing what he feared most.

|[[Rodrigo Borgia]]
|''[[Assassin's Creed II]]''
| During his duel with [[Ezio Auditore da Firenze]] at the Vatican Vault, after failing to activate the Vault door because he did not have any First Civilization DNA in him, Rodrigo told to Ezio in the middle of the duel that he looked for God in the vault, shocking Ezio, which led to the latter to ask whether God was really in the Vault. Rodrigo replied that God being in the Vatican vault was a more logical answer and far more interesting than God being in the sky with angels singing cherubim all around. Ezio then asked what God would do once Rodrigo entered the vault. Rodrigo replied he was only after power, which Ezio asked whether God would give it up easily. Rodrigo then told that whatever lay beyond the Vault wall would not be able to resist the [[Staff of Moses|Staff]] and [[Apple of Eden|Apple]] and that they were made for felling gods. Ezio, being already a believer, replied that God was omniscient and omnipotent, and that mere artifacts could not harm Him, to which Rodrigo falsely accused Ezio that he took up the image of God from other men. Ezio was shocked to learn of Rodrigo's atheism and rejection of the Bible, despite his papacy. Rodrigo then scoffed that Ezio was still too naive. Rodrigo then replied: "I became Pope because it gave me ACCESS. It gave me POWER. Do you think I believe a single god-damned word of that ridiculous book? It's all lies and superstition. Just like every OTHER religious tract written over the past ten thousand years."

|[[Al Mualim]]
|[[Assassin's Creed|Assassin's Creed (2007 video game)]]
|During his final fight with [[Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad]] in Masyaf and brief talks about the Apple of Eden while the latter was bound by the Apple's powers, Al Mualim confirmed that Altaïr was immune to the effects of the Pieces of Eden, to which Altaïr asked what illusion it was. Al Mualim said: "That's all it's ever done, this Templar treasure, this Piece of Eden, this word of God. Do you understand now? The Red Sea was never parted, water never turned to wine. It was not the machinations of Eris that spawned the Trojan War, but this! Illusions, all of them!" Altaïr argued that what Al Mualim had planned was no less than an illusion, to force men to work for him against their will. Al Mualim then denies the existence of any God whatsoever, by saying: "Is it any less real than the phantoms the Saracens and Crusaders follow now? Those craven Gods, who retreat from this world that men might slaughter one another in their names? They live amongst an illusion already. I'm simply giving them another, one that demands less blood." Altaïr then said that they were safer choosing these "phantoms", confirming that it was better to believe in some higher entity than believing in nothing at all. Al Mualim was disappointed, claiming that logic had left Altaïr's mind and was replaced with emotion. Still unconvinced, Altaïr was released from being bound to the Apple's power, after which he swiftly defeated Al Mualim in combat with some difficulty, finally ending his Mentor's life by plunging his Hidden Blade into his throat. During Al Mualim's final moments, he tells Altaïr to take the Apple, to which Altaïr replied to his Mentor that he held fire in his hand, which should have been destroyed. Al Mualim was not convinced even then, believing that the Apple could end the Crusades and create true peace and that he would never destroy it. Altaïr then promised him that he would destroy it, with the latter dying after challenging his student to truly destroy it.

|This main character often muses that he does not care whether or not God exists, saying that any faith he had died after the numerous atrocities that he witnessed and took part in during the [[Yugoslav Wars|war]], however, in reality, he does not agree to this point and constantly shouts out to God to bless Liberty City. He states that because of his firsthand experience of seeing what human beings are capable of, he does not believe humans have souls.

|Holo
|''[[Spice and Wolf]]''
|Holo initially scoffs at the notion that one god created the entire world and everything in it; later on in the series, she states that there cannot possibly be a god given how much pain and sorrow there is in the world. However, she should be considered an agnostic as she herself is a wolf deity; she knows that gods like herself exist but expresses disbelief in a monotheistic God.

|[[Brian Griffin]]
|''[[Family Guy]]''
| Originally he was a closeted atheist in earlier seasons and it is revealed in "Love, Blactually" that he is an open atheist like [[Seth MacFarlane]] himself, who claims that this character represents him most. This was revealed where he is seen at the library and he is looking for ''[[The God Delusion]]'' by atheist [[Richard Dawkins]]. His atheism comes under attack in "[[Not All Dogs Go To Heaven]]" when he comes out to the Griffins about his atheism, and [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], in a drastic effort to [[Forced conversion|convert]] Brian to [[Christianity]], makes his atheism public knowledge, quickly making him a social outcast until near climax of the episode. At one point in the episode "Not all Dogs Go To Heaven", Brian says, "You’re barking up the wrong tree. I am an atheist." However, in the episode [[April in Quahog]] Brian is seen praying as a response to the news report about a [[black hole]] that was discovered near the [[solar system]] and was about to suck the [[Earth]] inside (the black hole turned out to be an April Fool's joke plotted by Channel News 5). Stewie then teases Brian for it.

"'''Loving the Alien'''" is a song written and recorded by [[David Bowie]]. It was the opening track to his sixteenth studio album ''[[Tonight (David Bowie album)|Tonight]]''. One of two tracks on the album written solely by Bowie, an edited version of the song was released as a single in May 1985, nine months after the release of lead single "[[Blue Jean]]" and eight months after the release of the album. "Loving the Alien" peaked at No. 19 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The song explored Bowie's "intense dislike" of [[organized religion]].&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1027216/Loving-Alien-Never-seen-pictures-David-Bowie.html | title= Loving the Alien: Never before seen pictures of David Bowie | work=Daily Mail | first=Dylan | last=Jones | date=1 August 2008 | accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Loving the Alien" inspired the title of [[Christopher Sandford (author)|Christopher Sandford]]'s 1997 biography of Bowie and the 2018 Bowie box set release, ''[[Loving The Alien (1983-1988)]]''.

==Background==
One of two tracks on the album written solely by Bowie, as a [[Demo (music)|demo]] the song was simply called "1". The singer said the track "...came about because of my feeling that so much history is wrong - as is being rediscovered all the time - and that we base so much on the wrong knowledge that we've gleaned."&lt;ref name=RSMag84&gt;{{citation |last=Murray |first=Charles Shaar |title=Let's Talk, A Conversation with David Bowie |journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] |issue=433 |date=25 October 1984 |pages=14, 18, 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded a demo of the song in [[Montreux]], Switzerland prior to recording the song for the album.&lt;ref name=MM74&gt;{{citation |last=Fricke |first=David |title=David Bowie Interview |journal=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician magazine]] |issue=74 |date=December 1984 |pages=46–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowie later said that the production on the song undid the power of the lyric, saying he preferred the demo version,&lt;ref name=Smart90/&gt; and in a separate interview lamented "You should hear 'Loving the Alien' on demo. It's wonderful on demo. I promise you! (laughs). But on the album, it's ... not as wonderful."&lt;ref name=BKP89&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.davidbowie.se/bassman/articles/89/qm.html |title=Boys Keep Swinging |journal=[[Q magazine]] |date=June 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion==
A music video was co-directed by Bowie with [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]]. The original video included a short shot of Bowie with a nosebleed; this original version was only released on the 1987 video single "[[Day-In Day-Out]]".&lt;ref name="tcdbeu"&gt;{{cite book | title="The Complete David Bowie New Edition: Expanded and Updated" | last=Pegg | first=Nicholas | date=October 2016 | publisher=Titan Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; All subsequent releases of the video have the nosebleed scene edited out. An edited version of the song was released as a single in May 1985, nine months after the release of lead single "[[Blue Jean]]" and eight months after the release of the album.
 
==Critical reception==
Bowie's biographer David Buckley called it "the only track on the album with the gravitas of much of his earlier work".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=David|title=David Bowie: The Music and The Changes|date=2015|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1780389882|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lboSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT78&amp;lpg=PT78&amp;dq=loving+the+alien+gravitas+earlier&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=85CZHHDrub&amp;sig=6FIRkRI7rHDKHz3-EgwAQP5JjBs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiyor64runOAhXDCcAKHR7ACPIQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=loving%20the%20alien%20gravitas%20earlier&amp;f=false|accessdate=30 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Dylan Jones]] described it as "definitely the best song from the ''Tonight'' album".&lt;ref name="jones"/&gt; [[Yo Zushi]] of the ''[[New Statesman]]'' described the song as a "seven-minute masterpiece".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2016/01/defence-bad-bowie-why-his-least-acclaimed-album-my-favourite | title= In defence of "bad" Bowie: why his least acclaimed album is my favourite | work=New Statesman | first=Yo | last=Zushi | date=18 January 2016 | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While critical of much of Bowie's 1980s output in his appraisal of ''[[Best of Bowie]]'' in 2002, [[BBC]] reviewer Chris Jones stated: "Loving the Alien does have a strange distant beauty to it. Like watching a ballet through a telescope."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/j354/ | title= David Bowie Best Of Review | work=BBC | first=Chris | last=Jones | accessdate=16 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowie performed the song on his 1987 [[Glass Spider Tour]]&lt;ref name=Smart90&gt;{{Citation| last=Bromberg| first=Craig| title=David Bowie (Interview)| journal=Smart|date=June 1990| pages=50–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; (released on ''[[Glass Spider]]'' (1988)). On the [[A Reality Tour|Reality Tour]] in 2003 and 2004, he again performed this song, but this time a stripped-down version with only Bowie on vocals and [[Gerry Leonard]] on guitar.  Bowie said that the latter arrangement was perhaps "the way it should have always been done."&lt;ref&gt;As recorded in both the official [[A Reality Tour (film)|film]] and [[A Reality Tour (album)|album]] from that tour.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morality in Islam''' is a comprehensive term that serves to include the [[concept]] of [[righteousness]], good [[Moral character|character]], and the body of moral qualities and [[virtue]]s prescribed in [[Islamic holy books|Islamic religious texts]]. The underlying idea of Islamic [[morality]] is that of [[love]]: love for [[God in Islam|God]] and love for God's creatures. The idea is that mankind will acquire and follow the body of moral qualities in order to seek God's pleasure and to [[Philanthropy|treat the fellow human beings in the best possible manner]].&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (2006), p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moral&gt;[http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/1174/moral-system-of-islam-part-1/ Moral System of Islam: The Standard of Morality.] (2006). ''IslamReligion.com'' Retrieved 19 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Teaching on [[morality]] and moral conduct constitute a basic principle of [[Islam]], and the moral themes form a large part of it. The [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]] – the central religious texts of Islam – serve as the primary source for it.&lt;ref name=Clark-283&gt;Clark (2011), p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; Both the Quran and the hadith often speak in emphatic manners to instruct the Muslims to adopt a morally good [[Moral character|character]]. Showing [[kindness]] to people, and [[Charity (practice)|charity]] to the poor and the helpless are the most highlighted and most insisted virtues in the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (2006), p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, helping people especially in their needs, [[Forgiveness|forgiving others' offenses]], respecting [[parent]]s and elders, fulfilling promises, being kind to people and to animals, being patient in adversaries, maintaining [[justice]], [[Honesty|being honest]] in nature, controlling [[anger]] come as major virtues in Islamic concept of morality.

==Sources==
The Quran, which Muslims believe to be the verbatim word of God, serves as the primary source of moral teachings in Islam.&lt;ref name= Clark-283/&gt; The [[Sunnah]], which is the teachings, deeds and sayings, silent permissions (or disapprovals) of the [[Prophets of Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]], as well as various reports about Muhammad's companions, also serves as an important source for Islamic moral teachings.&lt;ref name= Clark-283/&gt; Besides these, the works of Islamic scholars and philosophers, and the moral examples set by important Islamic personalities (such as the four rightly guided caliphs) are other sources for Islamic ethical and moral guidance.&lt;ref name= Clark-283/&gt;

==General principle==
Islamic primary sources and later Islamic scholarly works have made detailed discussions and laid down detailed instructions on moral issues. However, some general principles can be found in case of following morality. One typical Islamic teaching on morality is that imposing a penalty on an offender in proportion to their offense is permissible and just; but forgiving the offender is better. To go one step further by offering a favor to the offender is regarded the highest excellence.&lt;ref name="Nigosian 2004, p.116"&gt;Nigosian (2004), p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Another principle is that whatever is good and beneficial for mankind is morally good, and vice versa.&lt;ref name=Moral/&gt; According to Islamic [[sharia]], a Muslim is expected to act only in good manners&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (2006), p.252&lt;/ref&gt; as bad manners earn vices. Muhammad is reported as saying "It is not possible that you indulge in rebuking and reviling and remain righteous at the same time".&lt;ref name="Al-Ghazali, chp. 14"&gt;Al-Ghazali, chp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Much emphasis has been attached in Islamic tradition on developing strong moral [[Value (ethics)|values]]. [[Iman (concept)|Faith]] is considered incomplete without having sense of morality.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ghazali, chp. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic sharia, a worshiper devoid of morality is seen as someone who has failed to realize the true significance of worshiping. In other words, the [[Salat|prayers]] which can not keep a person away from wrongdoings are seen worthless.&lt;ref&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 29, verse 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad is reported as saying that a real poor person is he who will appear on the [[Day of Judgment]] with a lot of rewards earned by his [[Salah|prayers]], [[Sawm|fasting]], [[zakat]]; but in his life he had also abused someone, had falsely accused someone, had illegally taken another's property, had murdered somebody; so all his virtues will be distributed to the victims, and he will be thrown to hell ({{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6251}}). Islamic tradition holds that moral qualities and good actions elevate the status of a man.&lt;ref name="Nigosian 2004, p.116"/&gt; Since the pursuance of moral qualities are more of a voluntary nature, their observance falls into the category of supererogatory worshipping, and is seen as the key to attaining the nearness of God.&lt;ref name=Leaman-139&gt;Leaman (2006), p. 139-143&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] said, "The best among you are those who have the best manners and character" ({{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|56}}).

==Emphasis on good character==
[[Moral character|Character]] primarily refers to the assemblage of qualities that distinguish one individual from another. Character can be good or bad. A good character is the one that has good moral qualities. There was a debate among the early Islamic [[Moral philosopher|moralists]] as to whether character could be changed. They recognized the dual aspect of character – innate and acquired – and thus noted that with conscious practice it could be changed to a certain degree.&lt;ref name=Leaman-139/&gt;

As a [[religion]], Islam promotes the idea of good character as is evident from its canonical texts. The Quran describes Muhammad as being 'on exalted quality of character' ({{cite quran|68|4|s=ns|b=n}}) and refers to him as 'an excellent example' ({{cite quran|33|21|s=ns|b=n}}) which ultimately means that the religious and moral examples, set by Muhammad, are to be followed and cultivated by the Muslims in order to construct a morally good character.&lt;ref name=Leaman-139/&gt; Muslim moralists have discussed the [https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/ethico-religious ethico-religious] importance of having a good character as well as the ways of acquiring it. [[Imam Birgivi]], a 16th century Muslim scholar and moralist, says that 'To cure yourself of a bad feature of character is an obligation'.&lt;ref&gt;Birgivi (2005), p.110&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous practice of moral virtues and a conscious effort to internalize those qualities can lead to the formation of a morally good character.&lt;ref name=Leaman-139/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birgivi (2005), p.108&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Raghib al-Isfahani|Al-Isfahani]] says that purification of soul means the control, not the elimination, of desires. According to Birgivi, changing of character depends on such things as 'a person's wish' and 'the strength of one's understanding', and the preservation of a good character requires the avoidance of the company of evil-charactered people who indulge into indecent activities, drunkenness, and meaningless gossip.&lt;ref name= Birgivi-111&gt;Birgivi (2005), p.111&lt;/ref&gt;
There are numerous sayings of Muhammad that highlight the importance of good character. Some of them are:
* Anas ibn Malik reported that the Prophet said: The one with good morals and character already owns the best of this world and the Hereafter (Tabarani and [[Sunan Abi Dawood|Abu Dawud]]).&lt;ref name= Birgivi-111/&gt;
* Abu Hurayrah reported that the Prophet said: I have been sent for the perfection of character ([[Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal|Imam Ahmad]] and Bayhaqi).&lt;ref name= Birgivi-111/&gt;
* Anas ibn Malik reported that the Messenger of Allah said: A person reaches the best and most honored levels in the Hereafter as a result of good character…. And bad character condemns a person to the lowest depths of Hell (Tabarani).&lt;ref name= Birgivi-111/&gt;
* One can repent for any sin but bad character – because with bad character, before a person can attempt to ask forgiveness for one sin, he commits a worse (Tabarani, Isfahani).&lt;ref name= Birgivi-111/&gt;

==Major virtues==

===Charity and philanthropy ===
{{Rquote|right|O Aisha, Never turn away any needy man from your door empty-handed. Love the poor; bring them near to you and God will bring you near to Him on the Day of Resurrection.|[[Muhammad]]|''Rahman, Encyclopedia of Seerah, VOL. VIII, p. 151''}}

Numerous verses of the Quran and the sayings of Muhammad tell the [[Muslim]]s to be [[Generosity|generous]] with their wealth and to [[Philanthropy|respond to the calls of the mankind's needs]]. Muslims believe that spending wealth for others, especially for the needy, and helping people are a fundamental duty for them,&lt;ref&gt;Stefon  (2010), p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and these things earn [[God]]'s mercy and reward in the [[afterlife]]. Similarly, caring for one's kinsmen and [[Neighbourhood|neighbors]] has also been emphasized. The Quran says that the righteous are those people who fulfill their promises, and feed the needy, [[Orphan|the orphans]] and the captive for the love of God ({{cite quran|76|5-8|s=ns|b=n}}). At another place, it says "Those who (in charity) spend their goods by night and by day, in secret and in public have their reward with their Lord; on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve" ({{cite quran|2|274|s=ns|b=n}}). In a long hadith collected in [[Sahih Muslim]], Jarir narrates that once they were with Muhammad when some poor people came. They were ill-clad with torn dresses and were starving. When Muhammad saw them, the color of his face changed. He asked [[Bilal ibn Ribah|Bilal]] to assemble the people and then delivered a speech, and said "Everyone should give in charity dinar, dirham, cloth, dates, wheat, etc." He went on till he urged: "Give, even if it is a stone of a date." After this, a man from [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]] brought a bag so full of materials that it was slipping from his hand. Other people also brought things to be given in charity till there were two big heaps of eatable goods and clothes. At that, the face of Muhammad glowed with joy.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-15&gt;Al-Ghazali, chp. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Miser|Miserliness]] is discouraged in Islam,&lt;ref&gt;Nigosian (2004), p.117&lt;/ref&gt; and the hoarding of wealth which is not used to redress the miseries of the needy and the poor is seen to be a cause of punishment in the afterlife.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-15/&gt; Helping people in time of their needs is seen more important than praying in the mosque.&lt;ref&gt;Hashmi (2009), p. 68-9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forgiveness===
{{See also|Repentance in Islam}}
As a virtue, [[forgiveness]] is much celebrated in Islam, and is regarded as an important Muslim practice, inspired by both the Quran and the Sunnah. The issue of forgiveness can take on two different forms: God's forgiveness for human beings for their [[sin]]s, and forgiveness among fellow human beings for each other. In the first instance, human beings have been asked to seek God's forgiveness for their sins, and they have been promised God's mercy and forgiveness. In the second instance, human beings have been encouraged to practice the act of forgiveness among themselves.&lt;ref name=Leaman-213&gt;Leaman (2006), p. 213-16&lt;/ref&gt; To forgive a person who has done moral offense, and not to be cruel to him is seen as a noble virtue.&lt;ref name=MQ-7-199&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 7, verse 199.&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic theology, the act of forgiveness is not meant to deny or underplay the moral injury suffered by the victim; rather it involves a positive change in mentality toward the offender.&lt;ref name=Leaman-213/&gt; Thus, an act of forgiveness means rising above one's self-interest or narrow-mindedness, and achieving nobler quality of heart.
Those who practice the act of forgiveness have been promised reward by [[God in Islam|God]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Hassan Khalil. (2012). ''Islam and the Fate of Others: The Salvation Question.'' Oxford University Press. pp 65-94. {{ISBN|978-0199796663}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a frequently quoted hadith, Muhammad is reported as saying: 'the best deeds before God are to pardon a person who has wronged you, to show affection for relatives who have broken ties with you, and to act generously towards a person who has deprived you.'&lt;ref name=Leaman-213/&gt;&lt;ref name=MQ-7-199/&gt;

===Tolerance===
In Islamic context, to be tolerant of one another comes both as a teaching and an injunction which is to be cultivated at personal, social, and religious levels. After its introduction in 610 CE, Islam sought to moderate the violent attitudes, prevalent among the people of [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], with the practice of tolerance and other virtues.&lt;ref name="Al-Ghazali, chp. 14"&gt;Al-Ghazali, chp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (2006), p.414-5&lt;/ref&gt; Islam expects people to practice tolerance in their family and social life. It is the teaching of Islam that when faced with ill-treatment by any unwise person, a sensible person should be less reactive and more tolerant. The misbehavior of others should not provoke him to do the same.&lt;ref name="Al-Ghazali, chp. 14"/&gt; During the initial years of Islam, Muslims faced persecutions by the Meccan pagans.&lt;ref name=EI-Muhammad&gt;Buhl, F.; Welch, A. T. (1993). "Muḥammad". [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] '''7'''. pp. 360–376.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, Muhammad was once asked by his companions to invoke God's wrath on the persecutors. Muhammad became displeased with such a request and advised them to be more tolerant.&lt;ref&gt;Khan (1980), p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; Once a [[Bedouin]] became discontented and expressed his dissatisfaction even after receiving gifts from Muhammad. Muhammad understood his nature, showed tolerance to him, and satisfied him with more gifts, thus paving the way for the Bedouin to take lesson from this.&lt;ref name="Al-Ghazali, chp. 14"/&gt; In the [[History of Islam]], [[Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy|Abdullah ibn Ubayy]] was known as the "leader of the [[Munafiq| hypocrites]]".&lt;ref&gt;William Montgomery Watt, "Abdullah b. Ubayy", ''[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of the hypocrites were condemned by several verses in the Quran. After Ubayy's death, at his son's request, Muhammad offered his own shirt as Ubayy's shroud.&lt;ref name="Al-Ghazali, chp. 14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=MQ-4-438&gt;Maariful Quran. Vol 4, p. 438. (Sura 9, verse 84.)&lt;/ref&gt; At his son's second request, Muhammad even led his funeral prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Haykal |first=Muhammad Husayn |authorlink=Muhammad Husayn Haykal |title=The Life of Muhammad |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOyO-TSo5nEC&amp;pg=PA486  |year=2008 |publisher=Islamic Book Trust |location=[[Selangor]] |isbn=978-983-9154-17-7 |page=486}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Ghazali, chp. 14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=MQ-4-438/&gt; When [[Umar]] objected about this, Muhammad said: "If I knew that Allah will pardon Ubayy if I pray for his forgiveness more than seventy times, I would even do that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abdur Raheem |first=M. R. M. |title=Muhammad the Prophet |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_nImTioI7ygC&amp;pg=PA712|year=1988 |publisher=Pustaka Nasional Pte Ltd |location= |isbn=9789971772239 |page=712}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maariful Quran. Vol 4, p. 441. (Sura 9, verse 84.)&lt;/ref&gt;

On social and state levels, the importance of tolerance comes from the fact that it is related to such greater issues as [[peace]] and justice which are said to be the desired goal of Islam.&lt;ref name=Leaman-655&gt;Leaman (2006), p. 655-57&lt;/ref&gt; Given that diversity is a natural phenomenon in this world, the Quran puts much emphasis on the observance of tolerance in order to maintain peace and security. In {{cite quran|49|13|s=ns|b=n}}, the Quran recognizes the diversity among people: 'O mankind! We created you from a single (pair) of a male and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may know each other (not that ye may despise each other). Verily the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most righteous of you.' By mentioning the common origin of mankind, the Quran reminds them of their relating to each other, and urges them to 'rise above' the racial and national divisions.&lt;ref name=Leaman-655/&gt; In a nutshell, it is the teaching of Islam that the diversity or difference in social, cultural, political, or religious spheres are to be accepted by members of communities to secure a peaceful co-existence.&lt;ref name=Leaman-655/&gt; About religious tolerance, the Quran says: 'Let there be no compulsion in religion' ({{cite quran|2|256|s=ns|b=n}}).{{primary source inline|date=December 2017}} No forceful conversion is recognized in Islam. According to Islamic jurists, [[forced conversion]] is not possible in Islam because [[Iman (concept)|faith]] basically relates to heart, and not so much to external affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 2, verse 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honesty===
In Islam, [[honesty]] implies maintaining [[sincerity]] and truthfulness in all actions, interactions, and transactions, and the issue of honesty touches almost all aspects of human life. Here, honesty serves as a umbrella term having some basic components like speaking truth; fulfilling commitments, whether written or verbal; remaining truthful to one's word; rendering the assigned duty sincerely and as meticulously as possible; imparting everyone's due rights without the person's asking for it; being objective in evaluating any case and giving judgments; avoiding falsehood, deception, and favoritism.&lt;ref name=Alkhuli-12&gt;Alkhuli  (2006), p. 12-3&lt;/ref&gt; Selection and promotion of personnel in an organization based on merit and not on favoritism is also a part of honesty. As Islam is a God-centered religion, honesty demands that it be maintained not only in public but also in private, not only when supervised but also when not supervised.&lt;ref name=Alkhuli-12/&gt; Honesty has particularly been emphasized in [[Financial transaction|business transactions]], not only in selling and buying but in issues like [[Price controls|pricing]] and [[advertising]] policies. Correct measurement is to be maintained. Again, Muhammad has instructed that the sellers should put the commodities of poorer quality in clear display so that the customers are not deceived.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (2011), p.297&lt;/ref&gt; [[Price gouging|Hiking the price]] to gain more profit or lowering the price to put the competitors at trouble are considered unethical.&lt;ref&gt;Ali (2015), p. 169&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, exaggerated claims and suppression of unfavorable information in advertising are discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Ali (2015), p. 169-170&lt;/ref&gt; Honesty is regarded by Muslim scholars as one of the five essential qualities for any Muslim accountants.&lt;ref&gt;Ali (2015), p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kindness and leniency===
The Quran and the hadith describe God as being kind and merciful to His creatures, and tell people to be kind likewise. Among the [[99 Names of God]] in Islam, the most common and famous are "the Compassionate" (al-raḥmān) and "the Merciful" (al-raḥīm).&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, David (1999). ''The 99 Beautiful Names for God for All the People of the Book.'' William Carey Library. {{ISBN|0-87808-299-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran says, "Verily, Allah is kind and merciful to the people" ({{cite quran|2|143|s=ns|b=n}}). Numerous sayings of Muhammad tell the Muslims to be kind and merciful to the creatures of God. In Sahih Bukhari, it is said "He who is not merciful to others, will not be treated mercifully (by God)" ({{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|42}}). Narrated in Sahih Muslim, Muhammad said, "Verily, Allah is mild and is fond of mildness, and He gives to the mild what He does not give to the harsh"&lt;ref name="D'Silva-129"/&gt; ({{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6273}}). He also said, "He who is deprived of kindness is in fact deprived of goodness ({{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|32|6272}}).

Muhammad has been described as being kind and compassionate to people and animals. [[Prophetic biography|Biographies of Muhammad]] record incidences showing his [[kindness]] and leniency to others. Once, a man came to him and said that he had committed a certain sin. As reparation for his sin, Muhammad asked the man if he could [[Islamic views on slavery|free a slave]] upon which the man expressed his inability.  Muhammad asked him if he could [[Sawm|fast]] for two months upon which the man replied in the negative. Muhammad asked him again if he could feed sixty poor men upon which the man replied that he was even unable to do that. In the meantime, a bag of dates was brought there as gift for Muhammad. Muhammad gave the bag of dates to the man and told him to distribute the dates among the poor as reparation. The man passionately said "who is poorer than me in [[Medina]]?" Hearing this, Muhammad smiled and told the man to distribute the dates among his own family members.&lt;ref name=Shibli-2&gt;Shibli Nomani, vol 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kind treatment to animals===
Islam has prescribed kind treatment not only to humans but also to animals.&lt;ref name="D'Silva-129"&gt;D'Silva (2012), p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;   Prophet Muhammad was probably the first in history to talk about the [[Animal rights|rights and proper treatment of animals]].&lt;ref name="D'Silva-129"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Animal-1&gt;Imam Kamil Mufti  (2006). [http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/185/humane-treatment-of-animals/ Humane Treatment of Animals.] ''IslamReligion.com'' Retrieved 19 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Disputed inline|date=September 2018}} Kind and humane treatment earn virtue, and can even be a means of salvation. Similarly, cruelty towards animals can lead to punishment by God.&lt;ref name="D'Silva-130"&gt;D'Silva (2012), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic tradition narrates the story of a man who got salvation for showing mercy to a thirsty dog.&lt;ref name="D'Silva-130"&gt;D'Silva (2012), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion, the man saw a [[dog]] which was about to die because of extreme thirst. He realized its plight, went down into a well, brought some water for the dog, and saved its life. God became pleased with him and pardoned all his previous sins ({{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|38}}). It also narrates the story of a woman who locked up a cat. She neither fed the cat nor set it free to feed for itself. For her cruelty, she was punished by God.&lt;ref name="D'Silva-130"/&gt; The early rulers in Islamic world used to instruct people in behaving properly to the animals.&lt;ref name="D'Silva-132"&gt;D'Silva (2012), p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

For proper treatment of animals, Islam has specified some guidelines:
* All pet and farm animals have the rights of proper food and shelter. The owner has the obligation to arrange for food and shelter for his animals.&lt;ref name=Animal-1&gt;Imam Kamil Mufti  (2006). [http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/185/humane-treatment-of-animals/ Humane Treatment of Animals.] ''IslamReligion.com'' Retrieved 19 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Silva-130"/&gt;
* Animals which are used to carry goods should not be over-loaded.&lt;ref name="D'Silva-131"&gt;D'Silva (2012), p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;
* Animals must not be tortured, beaten, or hurt unnecessarily. They are not to be killed for recreation. Also, the body parts of any live animal must not be mutilated.&lt;ref name=Animal-1/&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Silva-131"/&gt;
* Islam has prohibited the old custom of setting live animals or birds as targets for shooting practices.&lt;ref name=Animal-1/&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Silva-131"/&gt;
* Prophet Muhammad has forbidden separating the birds from their off-springs.&lt;ref name="D'Silva-131"/&gt;
* Animal slaughtering process should be such which is the least painful to the animal. Slaughtering of one animal in front of another is prohibited in Islam.&lt;ref name=Animal-1/&gt;&lt;ref name="D'Silva-132"/&gt;

===Justice===
{{Rquote|right|
To render justice ranks as the most noble of acts of devotion next to belief in God.  It is the greatest of all the duties entrusted to the prophets…and it is the strongest justification for man’s stewardship of earth.|[[Sarakhsi|Shams al-Din Sarkhasi]]|''Al-Mabsut, vol. 14, p. 59-60''}}

The Quran uses the words ''adl'', ''qist'', ''qast'', ''wasat'', and ''mizan'' in referring to [[justice]], with the word ''adl'' being mostly used and literally meaning to straighten, to balance, to depart from wrong, or to be equal.&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri (1984), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Its meaning is thus "a combination of moral and social values denoting fairness, balance, temperance and straightforwardness."&lt;ref&gt;Khadduri (1984), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, justice is not only a moral virtue but also an obligation to be fulfilled under all circumstances. The Quran at its two hundred places warns people against injustice, and at its one hundred places directs people to establishing justice.&lt;ref name= Khadduri-10&gt;Khadduri (1984), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran served for the early Muslims, as it serves for the present Muslims, as the primary source for the notion of justice. As his capacity as a prophet, the Quranic notion of justice was explained and translated into practice by Muhammad in dealing with various social issues, thus setting moral and legal examples and standards of justice in society and paving ways for the later Muslim theologians and scholars to "formulate theories of justice".&lt;ref name= Khadduri-10/&gt; The obligation to establish justice comes as a fundamental principle in the Quran, second in importance only to the [[Tawhid|oneness of God]].&lt;ref name= Khadduri-10/&gt; The Quranic injunction of fairness and fair dealing is equally applicable to all people, irrespective of caste, creed, and color.&lt;ref name=Justice-1&gt;[http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/376/justice-in-islam/ Justice in Islam.] 2006. ''IslamReligion.com'' Retrieved 19 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scholars of the Quran, rendering justice to people is a trust from God entrusted on mankind, and this should be fulfilled with a sense of responsibility, not just as a formality.&lt;ref name=Justice-1/&gt;

===Fulfillment of promise===
In Islamic sharia, fulfilling a contract is regarded as compulsory,&lt;ref&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 17, verse 34.&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the three qualities necessary for becoming a true Muslim,&lt;ref name=MQ-2-177&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 2, verse 177.&lt;/ref&gt; as the famous hadith says "Three are the signs of a hypocrite, even if he observed fast and prayed and asserted that he was a Muslim: when he spoke he told a lie, when he made promise he acted treacherously, and when he was trusted he betrayed" ({{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|1|113}}). Both the Quran and the hadith have attached importance to respect a contract once it has been made, and whether the other party is a Muslim or non-Muslim.&lt;ref name=Ghazali-9&gt;Al-Ghazali, chp. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the ordinary verbal promises, fulfillment of business contracts and repayment of loans come as a special instruction for the Muslims. Business contracts and words are not to be breached in pursuance of more profits. Similarly, admonition has been issued against the non-payment of loans as it is said to ruin the afterlife of a believer.&lt;ref name=Ghazali-9/&gt;

In Islamic tradition, fulfillment of promises has some other dimensions. Islamic belief holds that before creating humans in this world, God assembled their souls and asked them if He was not their Lord upon which they replied in the affirmative. Thus, accepting [[Allah]] as true God and following His commands in all sphere of life is regarded as the greatest fulfillment of that covenant.&lt;ref&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 7, verse 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Again, in case of [[Marriage in Islam|Muslim marriage]], full payment of [[Mahr]] – the amount of money which a bridegroom needs to pay to the bride at the time of their marriage – has been emphasized. Non-payment, partial payment, or manipulation of mahr (jointure) is seen as the disruption of marriage contract.&lt;ref name=Ghazali-9/&gt; A hadith in Tibrani says "If a man has married a woman and in his heart he has the intention of not paying that mahr, then he has deceived her. If he dies and he has not paid her right, then on the [[Last Judgment|Day of Judgment]] he will be presented before Allah as a rapist. And a man who has borrowed money from another man while he did not have the intention of re-paying the debt, then he has deceived him, and consequently he defrauded him. If he dies in this condition, without paying back his debt, then he will meet Allah as a thief."

===Modesty and humility===
"Every religion has its characteristic, and the characteristic of Islam is modesty." This saying of Muhammad, collected in [[Muwatta Imam Malik|al-Muwatta]], shows the unique position [[modesty]] holds in Islam. Islam has strongly emphasized the concept of decency and modesty. Here, modesty is seen no less important in speech and behavior than in dressing. Again, modesty has a dual aspect in Islam: modesty is to be maintained in public which is generally related to people, as well as in private which is related to God.&lt;ref name=modesty-1&gt;Imam Kamil Mufti (2006). [http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/21/modesty-part-1/ Modesty: An Overview.] ''IslamReligion.com'' Retrieved 19 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Islam expects that a Muslim who believes in [[God in Islam|God]] will feel shy in front of God, and this shyness will prevent him from disobeying God, from committing any sinful or immodest act, whether in public or private, because he has awareness of God.&lt;ref name=modesty-1/&gt; Muhammad has said, "Modesty is part of faith" ({{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|139}}). Thus Islam has linked modesty with faith. Islam also expects that a Muslim will be polite in his behavior with others. Display of anger, indecent behavior, or indecent exposure of body parts are highly discouraged. Modesty is seen as a human trait that distinguishes human beings from other animals.&lt;ref name=modesty-1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Bryan S. (2008). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9gznc28-sg8C&amp;pg=PA5 The Body and Society: Explorations in Social Theory.]'' p. 5. SAGE. {{ISBN|9781412929875}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad has been described as being more bashful than a maiden.&lt;ref name=Shibli-2/&gt;

Modesty in dressing has particularly been emphasized. According to [[Sharia|Islamic Law]], known as sharia, Muslims are required to cover their body parts with proper dressing.&lt;ref name=Long-93&gt;Long (2011), p.93&lt;/ref&gt; Sharia has also laid down specific guidelines for men and women regarding their dressing. Covering everything from 'navel to knee' is mandatory for men.&lt;ref name=Long-93/&gt; In some Muslim societies, women wear the [[niqab]], a veil that covers the whole face except the eyes, or the full [[burqa]], a full-body covering garment that occasionally does cover the eyes. Following is the most frequently cited verse of the Quran regarding modesty: "Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest.  That is purer for them.  God is Aware of what they do.  And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over their chests, and not to reveal their adornment" ({{cite quran|24|30-1|s=ns|b=n}}).

[[Humility]] is defined as being modest and respectful. The prophetic narrations and Muhammad's own examples of simplicity and humbleness inspire the Muslims to practice humility in their life. According to tradition, Muhammad was rare to engage in argument with others. He was rare to laugh in a loud voice; rather, he preferred soft smiling.&lt;ref name=Shibli-2/&gt; During the conquest of Mecca, when Muhammad was entering into the city riding on a camel, his head lowered, in gratitude to God, to the extent that it almost touched the back of the camel.&lt;ref name=Shibli-2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan (1980), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decent speech===
Islam has instructed its followers to maintain decency in speech, and misuse of tongue has been admonished. Excessive or absurd talking, or useless gossiping are generally discouraged.&lt;ref name=Ghazali-11&gt;Al-Ghazali, chp. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The person who talks too much is seen as having greater chances of making mistakes. Speech that hurts others' feelings or insults people are prohibited. Similarly, calling someone by any name that harms the honor of the person is prohibited. Decent and gentle speech has been encouraged as it is seen both as a virtue and as a means of cultivating goodness among people.&lt;ref name=Ghazali-11/&gt; Muhammad has preferred maintaining silence than engaging in meaningless talks. [[Polemic]]s in speech or heated arguments with ignorant people are disapproved of in Islam. In The Quran and the hadith, there are many instructions regarding the decent use of tongue. Some of them are:

* "The faith of a man cannot be straight unless his heart is straight, and his heart cannot be straight unless his tongue becomes straight."  ([[Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal|Musnad Ahmad]])
* "The faltering of the feet cause much less harm than the faltering of the tongue."  (Baihaqui)
* Muhammad once advised Abu Zar in this way: "Adopt silence. This is a way of causing Satan to run away, it is a support to you in the matter of your religion." ([[Musnad Ahmad Ibn Hanbal|Musnad Ahmad]])
* "Before Allah the most hated are the quarrelsome person" ({{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|3|43|637}}).
* “Successful indeed are the believers who are humble in their prayers, and who shun vain conversation, and who are active in deeds of charity." (Quran {{cite quran|23|1-4|s=ns|b=n}})
* "Say to my servants that they should say those things that are best. Verily, Satan sows discord among them. Verily, the Satan is for man an open enemy." (Quran {{cite quran|17|53|s=ns|b=n}})
* “A kind word with forgiveness is better than charity followed by injury. Allah is Free of All Wants and Most Forbearing." (Quran {{cite quran|2|263|s=ns|b=n}})

===Trustworthiness===
[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/trustworthiness Trustworthiness], which is connected to fulfilling assigned responsibilities properly, has a wide field of application in Islam and conveys a wide range of meaning.&lt;ref name=MQ-4-58&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 4, verse 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Islam has made every person responsible for returning the trust to their due recipients; and this command applies to both the common people and the ruling men.&lt;ref name=MQ-4-58/&gt; Misappropriation or breach of trust has been condemned severely. [[Anas ibn Malik]] narrates that there was hardly any occasion where Muhammad had delivered a speech but he had not said this "The person who lacks trustworthiness also lacks [[Iman (concept)|faith]]. And the person who does not keep promises has no religion."&lt;ref name=MQ-4-58/&gt; Muhammad has said, "Every one of you is a guardian and everyone will be asked about his subjects. Imam is a guardian. He will be asked about his subjects. A man is the guardian of the persons in his household. He is answerable about them. A woman is the guardian of her husband's house. She will be asked about her responsibility. The servant is the guardian of the articles of his master. He is answerable about this responsibility of his" ({{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|20|4496}}).

Performing one's duty sincerely and honestly is a trust. It means that a person will have the intention to properly carry out the duties entrusted to him, and will do it in the best possible manner without indulging in corruption.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-8&gt;Al-Ghazali, chp. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Receiving undue advantages from office is seen as corruption. The [[Head of state|rulers of the state]] or the [[Official|government officials]] who do not care for the [[Welfare state|welfare of their citizens]] and thus cause sufferings to them are seen as the worst deceiver and have been warned with the direst consequences in [[Akhirah|afterlife]].&lt;ref name= Ghazali-8/&gt; Adi bin Umaira narrates that he has heard the Prophet as saying: "Whomsoever we have given some post and he has concealed a needle or a thing smaller than that, then it will be a misappropriated thing with which he will have to appear on the Day of Judgment" ({{Hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|20|4514}}). Similarly, trust demands that posts be offered to able and deserving persons: persons who will be able to keep the [[Trust (emotion)|trust]] of organizations. To deny the public posts to those whose deserve them most, or to make appointments at public posts through [[nepotism]] is seen as misappropriation against God, His messenger, and the people. Those who make such unfair appointments have been warned that their prayers would not be accepted, and hell would be their destination.&lt;ref name=MQ-4-58/&gt;&lt;ref name= Ghazali-8/&gt; Sahih Bukhari narrates that a man asked Muhammad when the Doomsday would occur. Muhammad replied "When deposits in trust would start being lost, then wait for the Doomsday." He was asked again, "What is the meaning of loss of trusts?" He replied: "When responsibilities are entrusted to unfit persons, then wait for the Doomsday" ({{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|76|503}}).

According to Islamic theology, the wealth and abilities given to a man is a trust from God which means that they should be used in [[dīn|ways recommended by God]], and these should not be abused for illegal activities.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-8/&gt;

Protecting the confidential information of the meetings and the secret information of others is also a trust provided that these are not related to [[haram|illegal activities]].&lt;ref name= Ghazali-8/&gt; Disclosing family secrets, especially that of the [[wife]], is seen as the worst type of misappropriation. It is narrated in [[Sahih Muslim]] that "On the Day of Judgment before Allah, the greatest act of misappropriation will be that a man may love his wife and the wife may also be inclined towards her husband and then he may disclose his wife's secrets to others."

After Muhammad started his preaching in 610 CE, his relationship with his own tribesmen, [[Quraysh (tribe)|the Quraysh people]], deteriorated gradually.&lt;ref name=EI-Muhammad/&gt; Despite this, the Quraysh people of [[Mecca]] used to deposit their valuable things at Muhammad because of his honesty and trustworthiness.&lt;ref name=Shibli-1&gt;Shibli Nomani, vol 1&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Hegira|Muhammad was compelled to leave Mecca]] because of  Quraysh opposition, he directed his cousin [[Ali]] to return those deposits at their due recipients after his leave.&lt;ref name=Shibli-1/&gt;

===Patience===
{{See also|Sabr}}
The issue of [[patience]] is of special interest in Islam. Islamic tradition holds that God has made this world a testing ground for mankind, especially for the believers, and that the sincerity and strength of their faith will be judged through various trials.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ghazali, chp. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Patience is one of the moral qualities which Islamic sharia considers necessary for a Muslim in order to keep away from evildoings, and in a broader sense, to protect his [[Iman (concept)|faith]].&lt;ref name=MQ-2-177/&gt; This is because Islamic holy scriptures say that believers will be tested with various adversaries in their life, and only those who can prove their faith and can remain grateful to God despite those adversaries will earn His blessings.&lt;ref&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 2, verse 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 29, verse 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leaman-554&gt;Leaman (2006), p. 554&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic theology, the solution to any crisis in a Muslim's life lies in two things: prayer and patience ([[Quran]] {{cite quran|2|153|s=ns|b=n}}), and Muslims have been asked to seek God's help through these two things.&lt;ref name=Leaman-554/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 2, verse 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Truthfulness===
[[Honesty|Truthfulness]] has been much emphasized in Islam, not only as a virtue, but also as a [[Ahkam|religious obligation]]; and falsehood has been admonished severely. Islam demands that its followers lead their life on the basis of truthfulness and fair dealing. Falsehood and dishonesty must be avoided because they mark [[Fasiq|departure from religion]].&lt;ref name=Ghazali-7&gt;Al-Ghazali, chp. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Telling lie is one of the major sins in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Imam Birgivi, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad was asked whether a Muslim could be a coward. He answered: 'Yes.' He was asked whether a Muslim could be a miser. He answered: 'Yes.' He was again asked: 'Can a Muslim be a liar?' He replied: 'No.' Falsehood is seen as something which is against the general characteristics of human nature: it corrupts the [[Ruh|human soul]] and paves the way for many other evil activities.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-7/&gt; According to the Quran, truthfulness was a characteristic virtue of the [[prophets in Islam|prophets]] ([[Quran]] {{cite quran|12|46|s=ns|b=n}}; {{cite quran|19|41|s=ns|b=n}}; {{cite quran|19|54|s=ns|b=n}}; {{cite quran|19|56|s=ns|b=n}}; {{cite quran|5|75|s=ns|b=n}}).

Islam has some other considerations regarding truthfulness:
* The virtue of truthfulness is to be maintained even in matters which are not serious in nature. Telling lies in jokes, or inventing false stories to amuse people are highly discouraged.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-7/&gt;
* Telling lies to even children is prohibited. Prophetic tradition narrates that "Anybody who called a child saying that he would give him a certain thing, and did not give it, then it is a lie" (Ahmed). Children should be accustomed to truthfulness from their childhood so that they can grow up with this virtue.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-7/&gt;
* Inventing falsehood and false story about God and His messengers, or inventing any [[bid'ah|false element in religion]] is seen as a grave sin.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-7/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imam Birgivi, p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;
* Exaggeration in praising someone is prohibited. Exaggerated praising of any powerful of rich person in order to get illegal advantage falls into this category. Praise should be made to the extent a person knows about someone.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-7/&gt; [[Abu Hurairah]] narrates that "the Prophet has commanded us that we should throw dust in the face of those who indulge in exaggeration in their praises" ([[Sunan al-Tirmidhi|Tirmizi]]).
* Giving false evidence against someone is seen as the worst type of falsehood, and is considered a major sin in Islam. A person is required to maintain truth in giving evidence even if that goes against their own interest.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-7/&gt;
* Bringing [[False accusation|false charge]] of [[Zina|adultery]] against any woman is a punishable act in [[Sharia|Islamic law]] which orders to flog the accuser eighty lashes.&lt;ref&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 24, verse 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anger management===
[[Anger management]] comes as an important issue in Islamic tradition as anger is seen to destroy human [[conscience]] and to become the cause of many evil and violent activities.&lt;ref name="Al-Ghazali, chp. 14"/&gt; Anger is considered one of the characteristic features of pre-Islamic period – a period known as [[Jahiliyyah|age of ignorance]]. A hadith in [[Sunan al-Tirmidhi|Tirmizi]] says, "Adam's sons have been created of different types. … the best people among these are those who get angry late and immediately repent." In a famous hadith Narrated Abu Huraira, Muhammad said "The strong is not the one who overcomes the people by his strength, but the strong is the one who controls himself while in anger" ({{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|135}}). Controlling anger is seen as a virtue and a sign of righteous person.&lt;ref&gt;Aisha Stacey (2012). [http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/5236/anger-management-in-islam-part-1/ Anger management in Islam: Controlling anger is a sign of righteousness.] ''IslamReligion.com'' Retrieved 19 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad is reported as suggesting several methods to assuage anger for a man when he gets angry: to sit down if he is standing, and/or to lie down if he is sitting; to perform [[Ablution in Islam|ablution]]  (Islamic way of washing hands and face); to seek refuge from God against the influence of Satan.&lt;ref&gt;Aisha Stacey (2012). [http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/5240/anger-management-in-islam-part-2/ Anger management in Islam: Islam offers several methods to overcome anger and rage.] ''IslamReligion.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sincerity===
In Islam, [[sincerity]] of [[Niyyah|intention]] determines the significance of any act, that is to say, the value of any act depends on the motivation behind the act, not on the act itself.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-10&gt;Al-Ghazali, chp. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; Good intention is said to earn reward and God’s pleasure while bad intention God's displeasure. In Islamic theology, this applies not only to general act but also to prayers and worshiping. Thus, any act of worshiping which is done to attain worldly fame, or any act of charity which is given to impress people, is considered invalid and is regarded as a sinful act by [[Sharia|Islamic jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name= Ghazali-10/&gt; Only those acts of prayer or charity which are done to seek God's pleasure or to benefit people are granted by God.&lt;ref&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 22, verse 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In Islam, sincerity of intention has some other significances: a) if a person sincerely intends to do any good deed and then becomes unable to materialize it into action due to any reason, he is still said to get reward for it; b) an act of worshiping done to gain worldly fame and not to seek God's pleasure is regarded as lesser [[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]; c) the reward for a righteous act increases from ten to thousand times depending on the  sincerity of the doer's intention.&lt;ref name= Ghazali-10/&gt;

===Respecting the elders===
The family and the social tradition in Islamic world has long fostered the idea of respecting the elders of family and society.&lt;ref&gt;Rassool  (2014), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haddad-94&gt;Haddad, Yvonne Yazbeck. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lv4RDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94 Muslim Women in America: The Challenge of Islamic Identity Today]&lt;/ref&gt; Elders are generally honored by the young members as part of both [[Islamic culture]] and religious duty. It is one of the important [[Adab (Islam)|Islamic good manners]] found in Islamic world. Examples of respecting elders include, among others, not walking ahead of the elders, allowing them to talk first in meetings, avoiding argument with them, and not raising voice before them.&lt;ref name=Rasool-65&gt;Rassool  (2014), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Prophetic tradition narrates that 'he who does not love the younger and does not respect the elders is not one of us'&lt;ref name=Rasool-65/&gt; ([[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]]). Anas inb Malik narrates that Muhammad said, 'If a young man honors an elderly on account of his age, Allah appoints someone to honor him in his old age'&lt;ref name=Rasool-65/&gt; ([[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]]).

Islamic traditions generally do not separate the older into [[Retirement home|old homes]], rather accommodate them into their own houses.&lt;ref name=Haddad-94/&gt; They are also respected as the guardian of the house. Among the elderly members of a family, the parents occupy a special position in case of receiving veneration by their children. With regard to the [[Islam_and_humanity#Rights_of_various_groups_in_Islam|rights of parents]], the Quranic injunction is to behave well with then, to take care of them especially in their old age, not to be rude to them, and to show highest respect to them.&lt;ref&gt;Maariful Quran. Chapter 17, verse 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leaman (2006), p.489&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Bible sidebar |expanded=interpretation}}

Arguments that prophecies of Muhammad in the Bible presaged his birth, teachings, and death have formed part of [[Islam|Muslim tradition]] from the early history of [[Muhammad]]'s ''[[Ummah]]'' ({{lang-ar|أُمَّـة}}, Community), although Christians like [[John of Damascus]], [[Martin Luther]] and [[John Calvin]] have interpreted Muhammad as being the [[Antichrist]]. However, many other Christian figures have taken alternate approaches.

Muslim writers have expanded on these viewpoints and have argued that they can specifically identify references to [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] in the text of the [[Bible]], both in the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Tanakh]] and in the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]]. Several verses in the [[Quran]], as well as several [[Hadith]]s, state that Muhammad is described in the Bible. On the other hand, scholars have generally interpreted these verses as referring to the community of [[Israel]] or [[Yahweh]]'s personal soteriological actions regarding the Israelite's or members of the faithful community. The apocryphal [[Gospel of Barnabas]], which explicitly mentions Muhammad, has also been identified as an ancient prediction about the Prophet, but this book is widely recognized by scholars as a fabrication from the [[Early Modern Age]].

== Biblical verses claimed to be prophecies of Muhammad ==

=== Deuteronomy 18:18 ===
{{quote|I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like you, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. It shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My name, I Myself will require it of him. 20 But the prophet who speaks a word presumptuously in My name which I have not commanded him to speak, or which he speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die.'|Deuteronomy 18:18-20 ([[New American Standard Bible]])|source=}}

Deuteronomy 18:18 has often been considered a prophecy of Muhammad by Muslim scholars.&lt;ref name=Dammen&gt;McAuliffe, Jane Dammen. "Connecting Moses and Muhammad". In Andrew Rippin and Roberto Tottoli, eds. ''Books and Written Culture of the Islamic World: Studies Presented to Claude Gilliot on the Occasion of his 75th Birthday'' (Brill 2014): 335.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Samawal al-Maghribi]], a medieval Jewish mathematician who converted to Islam, pointed to Deuteronomy 18:18 in his book ''Confutation of the Jews'' as a prophecy fulfilled by Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;al-Maghribi, Al-Samawal; ''Confutation of the Jews'' (in Arabic). Syria: Dar Al Qalam, 1989, 75&lt;/ref&gt; Samawal argued in his book that since the children of Esau are described in Deuteronomy 2:4-6 and Numbers 20:14 as the brethren of the children of Israel, the children of Ishmael can also be described the same way.&lt;ref&gt;al-Maghribi, Al-Samawal; ''Confutation of the Jews'' (in Arabic). Syria: Dar Al Qalam, 1989, 77&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim writers, like [[Muhammad Ali (writer)|Muhammad Ali]] and [[Fethullah Gülen]], have interpreted several verses in the Quran as implying that Muhammad was alluded to in Deuteronomy 18:18, including Quran 46:10 and 73:15.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Ali and Zahid Aziz, [https://archive.org/details/EnglishTranslationOfTheHolyQuran English Translation of the Holy Quran: With Explanatory Notes], Revised 2010 edition, 627, 732&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gülen, Fethullah. The messenger of God Muhammad: An analysis of the Prophet's life. Tughra Books, 2000, 11. [https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/30583495/The-Messenger-of-God-Muhammad-An-Analysis-of-the-Prophets-Life.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1542003237&amp;Signature=7FnvB4YWltdtwNZTRpfEnxLiPCg%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DMessenger_of_God_An_Analyses_of_the_life.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians interpret Deuteronomy 18:18 as referring to a future member of the community of Israel who reenacts the function of Moses, serving as act as a mediator for the covenant between [[YHWH]] and the Israelites. [[Walter Brueggemann]] writes that "The primary requirement for the prophet, like
the king in 17:15, is that he or she must be a member of Israel, thoroughly situated in the traditions and claims of the Yahwistic covenant."&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann, Walter. ''Deuteronomy''. Abingdon Press, 2001, 192-197&lt;/ref&gt; The Gospels of Matthew and John both make Jesus out to be the prophet like Moses from Deuteronomy 18.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, John, and John Muddiman, eds. The Oxford Bible Commentary. Oxford University Press, 2007, 866, 963.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deuteronomy 33:2 ===
[[File:Mt. Sinai (Georgian MSS).jpg|thumb|left|Mount Sinai depicted on late medieval Georgian manuscript.]]

{{quote| He said, "The Lord came from Sinai, And dawned on them from Seir; He shone forth from Mount Paran, And He came from the midst of ten thousand holy ones; At His right hand there was flashing lightning for them.|Deuteronomy 33:2|source=}}

[[Al-Samawal al-Maghribi]] referred to this verse also in his book as a prophecy of Muhammad. He said that [[Mount Sinai]] refers to Moses, [[Mount Seir]] "the Mount of Esau" refers to Jesus, and [[Desert of Paran|Mount Paran]] "the Mount of Ishmael" refers to Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;al-Maghribi, Al-Samawal; ''Confutation of the Jews'' (in Arabic). Syria: Dar Al Qalam, 1989, 67&lt;/ref&gt; Since, many Muslim scholars have looked to Deuteronomy 33 as containing a prophetic prediction of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Ali and Zahid Aziz, English Translation of the Holy Quran: With Explanatory Notes, Revised 2010 edition, 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dammen/&gt;

Deuteronomy 33:2 is part of the poem known as the [[Blessing of Moses]] spanning Deuteronomy 33:1-29. Scholars consider that the poem serves as Yahwistic declaration for the blessing of the future of Israel as a socially unified whole that will benefit and prosper through YHWH's beneficence. The poem relates YHWH's movement from the south from Mount Sinai, the mountain where He resides, to His enterance on the scene as a "formidable invading force."&lt;ref&gt;Brueggemann, Walter. ''Deuteronomy''. Abingdon Press, 2001, 284-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isaiah 29:11-12 ===
{{quote|The entire vision will be to you like the words of a sealed book, which when they give it to the one who is literate, saying, “Please read this,” he will say, “I cannot, for it is sealed.” 12 Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate, saying, "Please read this." And he will say, "I cannot read."|Isaiah 29:11-12|source=}}

Muslims interpret this verse as a prophecy of Muhammad, as tradition says that when the Archangel Gabriel commanded Muhammad to read something, he replied "I am not learned."&lt;ref&gt;Singh, David Emmanuel. "Muhammad," The Prophet like Moses"?." Journal of Ecumenical Studies 43.4 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=Source is needed showing this interpretation in Muslim circles - I'd prefer if a second source was available since the first one is rather hard to access|date=November 2018}} [[Old Testament]] scholars believe that this passage refers to members of the Judahite community intentionally ignoring God's warnings of judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, John, and John Muddiman, eds. The Oxford Bible Commentary. Oxford University Press, 2007, 458-459&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Isaiah 42 ===
{{Main|Isaiah 42}}
{{quote|"Behold, My Servant, whom I uphold; My chosen one in whom My soul delights. I have put My Spirit upon Him; He will bring forth justice to the nations. 2 "He will not cry out or raise His voice, Nor make His voice heard in the street. 3 "A bruised reed He will not break And a dimly burning wick He will not extinguish; He will faithfully bring forth justice. 4 "He will not be disheartened or crushed Until He has established justice in the earth; And the coastlands will wait expectantly for His law."|Isaiah 42:1-4}}

Muslim tradition holds that Isaiah 42 predicted the coming of a servant associated with [[Qedar]], the second son of Ishmael and who went on to live his life in Arabia, and so interpret this passage as a prophecy of Muhammad.&lt;ref name=zepp&gt;Zepp, Ira G. A Muslim Primer: Beginner's Guide to Islam. Vol. 1. University of Arkansas Press, 2000, 50-51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Uri. The eye of the beholder: the life of Muḥammad as viewed by the early Muslims: a textual analysis. Vol. 5. Darwin Pr, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Hadiths]], Muslims like [['Abd Allah ibn 'Amr ibn al-'As]] have believed that Muhammad was the servant of Isaiah 42 during his very lifetime.&lt;ref name="sunnah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/adab/12/9|title=Hadith - Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, Isaiah 42:1-4 was first identified by [[Bernhard Duhm]] as one of the [[Servant songs]] in the [[Book of Isaiah]],&lt;ref&gt;Bernhard Duhm, Das Buch Jesaia (Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1892),&lt;/ref&gt; along with Is. 49:1-6; Is. 50:4-7; and Is. 52:13-53:12. The [[Old Testament]] identifies the servant of the Servant songs as the Israelite's in Is. 41:8-9; Is. 44:1; Is. 44:21; Is. 45:4; Is. 48:20 and Is. 49:3.&lt;ref name=servant&gt;Barton, John, and John Muddiman, eds.

InterVarsity Press, 2014, 61-74.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] and [[John Muddiman]] write that "The idea of a 'servant' played a small part in the earlier chapters, being used as a designation of the unworthy Eliakim in 22:20 and of the figure of David in 37:35, but it now comes to the fore as a description of major significance, the noun being used more than 20 times in chs. 40-55. Its first usage is obviously important in establishing the sense in which we are to understand it, and here it is clear that the community of Israel/Jacob is so described."&lt;ref name=servant/&gt;

=== Haggai 2:7 ===

{{quote|I will shake all the nations; and they will come with the wealth of all nations, and I will fill this house with glory,’ says the Lord of hosts.|Haggai 2:7}}

According to some Muslim interpreters, [[Book of Haggai|Haggai's]] promise for the coming of wealth in the future to be a reference to Muhammad's advent. The wealth, ''himada'' in Hebrew, is closely rooted to the Arabic ''hemed'', which is personalized in the Arabic name Ahmad, an abbreviation of Muhammad. Muslims believe this is further indicated by Haggai's saying that the ''himada'' will go on to bring ''shalom'', something Muslims believe was accomplished by Muhammad.&lt;ref name=zepp/&gt;

According to scholars, Haggai 2:1-9 is discussing YHWH's eschatological return in the future in order to restore and rebuild the [[Third Temple|Temple]]. In verse 6, the passage says that God's return is in "a little while once more" (Haggai 2:6), the language being used to accentuate its imminence, while the Hebrew phrase for "once more" refers to earlier events, specifically in the context of Haggai 2, alluding to God's initial appearance on Mount Sinai. YHWH's return causes all of creation ("the heavens and the earth") and the nations (v. 7) to shake, and the nations respond in submission by bringing all their wealth to YHWH's house, the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Boda, Mark J.

Many Muslim scholars have argued that the Greek words ''paraklytos'' (comforter) and ''periklutos'' (famous/illustrious) were used interchangeably, and therefore, these verses constitute Jesus prophesying the coming of Muhammad.&lt;ref name=zepp/&gt; However, there is not one Greek manuscript in existence with this reading, all Greek manuscripts read παράκλητος ''parakletos''.&lt;ref&gt; Reuben J. Swanson, ed., ''New Testament Greek Manuscripts: John''. William Carey International University Press, 1998. Variant Readings Arranged in Horizontal Lines Against Codex Vaticanus -- see John 14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7. Also see ''Nestle-Aland, eds., Novum Testamentum Graece, 28th ed.'' Stuttgart: Deutsche Biblegesellschaft, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical scholarship recognizes that the Paraclete, or Advocate, is mentioned five times throughout John's Gospel (John 14:16-17; 14:26; 15:26-27; 16:7-11; 16:13-17). The Advocate, called the "Spirit of Truth" is considered the Holy Spirit; a replacement for Jesus into the world after Jesus leaves, still dependent on Christ (14:6) and sent by the Father at Jesus' demand (14:16, 24). The Spirit is said to permanently remain with the disciples (14:18-21). John's Gospel says that the world cannot receive the Spirit though the Spirit can abide within the disciples (14:17). The Spirit will accuse the world of sin (16:9) and glorify Jesus (16:14), and though it is 'the spirit that gives life', the spirit does not add new revelations to those of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, John, and John Muddiman, eds. The Oxford Bible Commentary. Oxford University Press, 2007, 987-990&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gospel of Barnabas ==
Some Muslims including [[Muhammad Abu Zahra]] claim that changes were made to the present-day canon of the Christian Bible, by excluding material that represented the authentic message of Jesus, claiming that the authentic tradition is represented in the [[Gospel of Barnabas]], which contains predictions of Muhammad.&lt;ref name = "hm"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/003933802760115417|title=History as a Literary Weapon: The Gospel of Barnabas in Muslim-Christian Polemics|year=2002|last1=Leirvik|first1=Oddbjørn|journal=[[Studia Theologica]]|volume=56|page=4|url=http://folk.uio.no/leirvik/tekster/Barnabas.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later Muslim writer, Ata ur-Rahîm, claimed that "The Gospel Barnabas was accepted as a Canonical Gospel in the churches of Alexandria up until 325".&lt;ref name = "hm"/&gt; The Gospel of Barnabas is generally seen to be a fabrication made during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cirillo |first=Luigi |author2=Fremaux, Michel |title=Évangile de Barnabé |year=1977 |publisher=Beauchesne |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ragg |first=L &amp; L |title=The Gospel of Barnabas |year=1907 |publisher=Oxford |pages=xi|isbn=1-881316-15-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1093/jts/flq010|last=Joosten |first=Jan |date=April 2010 |title=The date and provenance of the Gospel of Barnabas |journal=[[Journal of Theological Studies]]|volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=200–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-Islamic view ==
[[File:EulogioCordovamart.JPG|thumb|Martyrdom of [[Eulogius of Córdoba|Eulogius of Cordova]], 17th century]]
{{see also|Medieval Christian views on Muhammad|Criticism of Muhammad#Christian criticism}}
Early Christian writers claimed that Muhammad was predicted in the Bible, as a forthcoming [[Antichrist]], [[false prophet]], or [[false Messiah]]. According to [[Albert Hourani]], initial interactions between Christian and Muslim peoples were characterized by hostility on the part of the Europeans because they interpreted Muhammad in a biblical context as being the Antichrist.&lt;ref name="Hourani1967"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00263206708700074|title=Islam and the philosophers of history|year=1967|last1=Hourani|first1=Albert|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|volume=3|issue=3|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known exponent of this view was [[John of Damascus]] in the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Esposito, John L., ''The Oxford History of Islam'': Oxford University Press, 1999, p.322.&lt;/ref&gt; In c. 850 CE [[Martyrs of Cordoba|about 50 Christians were killed]] in Muslim-ruled [[Córdoba, Andalusia]] after a Christian priest named [[Perfectus]] said that Muhammad was one of the "false Christs" prophesied in Matthew 24:16.42. The monk [[Eulogius of Córdoba]] (c. 800-859 AD) justified the views of Perfectus and the other [[Martyrs of Córdoba]], saying that they witnessed "against the angel of Satan and forerunner of Antichrist...Muhammed, the heresiarch."&lt;ref name = "ber"&gt;McGinn, Bernard, ''Antichrist: Two Thousand Years of the Human Fascination with Evil'', Columbia University Press. 2000, p.86; 212.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Calvin]] argued that "The name Antichrist does not designate a single individual, but a single kingdom which extends throughout many generations", saying that both Muhammad and the Catholic popes were "antichrists".&lt;ref name = "ber"/&gt;

The prophecy of the "[[Four kingdoms of Daniel]]" in [[Daniel 7|Chapter 7]] of the Book of Daniel has also been interpreted by Christians as a prediction of Muhammad. Eulogius argued that Muhammad was the Fourth Beast in the prophesy.&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Frederick, ''The Sum of All Heresies: The Image of Islam in Western Thought'', Oxford University Press, 2008, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Another medieval monk, Alvarus, argued that Muhammad was the "eleventh king" that emerged from the Fourth Beast. According to historian [[John V. Tolan|John Tolan]],

&lt;blockquote&gt;In Daniel's description of this beast, Alvarus sees the career of the Antichrist Muhammad and his disciples. This eleventh king who arises after the others, "diverse from the first," who subdues three kings, is it not Muhammad, who vanquished the Greeks, the Romans, and the Goths? "And he shall speak great words against the most High": did he not deny the divinity of Christ, thus, according to Saint John, showing himself to be an Antichrist? He "shall wear out the saints of the most High": is this not a prediction of the persecutions inflicted by the Muslims, in particular of the martyrdoms of Córdoba? He will "think to change times and laws": did he not introduce the Muslim calendar and the Koran? "&lt;ref&gt;[[John V. Tolan|John Tolan]], ''Saracens: Islam in the Medieval European Imagination'', Columbia University Press. New York: 2002, p.81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the seventh century, the Prophet of Islam's name has been the focus of several stereotypes. Greek and Latin sources presented exaggerated and sometimes wrong stereotypes in literature, and the orthographic forms, which varied among them, were shared by two Western cultures: Spain and France. These variants and forms of the Prophet of Islam's name formulated stereotypes that molded the opinion and feelings of the West toward the leader of the new religion. Their references played a principal role in introducing Muhammad and his religion to the West as a false prophet who wrote the Koran, a Saracen prince or deity, the biblical beast, a schismatic from Christianity, a satanic creature, and the Antichrist.&lt;ref&gt;See Sbaihat, Ahlam (2015), [http://journals.yu.edu.jo/jjmll/Issues/vol7no12015/Nom2.pdf "Stereotypes associated with real prototypes of the prophet of Islam's name till the 19th century"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[1910 Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' holds that "contradictory opinions have been expressed by scholars in the last three centuries" about Muhammad’s "moral character and sincerity" since "Many of these opinions are biased either by an extreme hatred of Islam and its founder or by an extreme admiration, coupled with a hatred of Christianity."&lt;ref&gt;Oussani, Gabriel (1911).

[[Image:Vishnu.jpg|frame|right|Vishnu holding Panchajanya in his upper left hand]]
'''Panchajanya''' ([[IAST]]: pāñcajanya) is the [[Shankha]] or [[conch]] of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god [[Vishnu]]. According to the [[Ramayana]], Purushottama (Vishnu) killed a [[Danava (Hinduism)|Danava]] (demon) named Panchajana on a mountain named Chakravan&lt;ref&gt;or "in another universe" ''When Lord Buddha achieved enlightenment, he saw millions and millions of “chakravan” or cosmoses, all repeatedly coming into existence, lasting for a while, and then disintegrating.'' {{Cite book|last=Thepyanmongkol |first=Phra |year=2007 |title=Sunday Dhamma Talks, volume 1 |location=[[Ratchaburi Province]], Thailand |publisher=Wat Luang Phor Sodh Buddhist Meditation Institute |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_SDwAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA29 29]}}&lt;/ref&gt; constructed by [[Vishwakarma]] and took away the conch shell in which Panchajanya had lived.  The conch was named after the Danava.

As per the [[Harivamsa]], Krishna, the avatar of Vishnu, is described as possessing a conch shell called Panchajanya, one of his four attributes together with the mace [[Kaumodaki]], the disc-like weapon [[Sudarshana Chakra]] and a [[Padma (attribute)|lotus flower]]. The conch was used during the [[Kurukshetra War]]. Panchajanya or Shankhasur was an evil sea demon who lived in a colossal conch shell in the deepest depths of the Prabhasa ocean or was a demon in the form of a conch shell. He kidnapped the son of Sandipani, the guru of Shri [[Krishna]], [[Balarama]], [[Sudama]],and Uddhava and imprisoned him in the conch shell. Upon completion of their studies, Krishna, Balarama, and Uddhava  persuaded the teacher to ask for the preceptor’s dakshina (fees) of his liking. Sandipani asked for, as his dakshina, the restoration of his child. Krishna became enraged when he heard about the kidnap and plunged into the sea to rescue the son of Sandipani. Krishna successfully slew Shankhasur and took the conch shell for himself. He then went to his guru Sandipani who named that conch as Panchjanya .Whenever Krishna blows from the shell it foreshadows the death of his next opponent. The [[Kurukshetra War|great war]] of the ''Mahabharata'' began after blowing Panchjanya by Lord Krishna.

Vishnu is said to be quad-armed and he is depicted holding in one of his hands the panchajanya conch, which, like other shastras, has been transferred to lord Krishna on earth from the so-called heaven- Vaikuntha dhama. Lord Krishna found him in a deep sea. A demon used to sleep in this conch and thus was destined to be killed by holy god, at the time of receiving the conch.

In the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the '''President of the Church''' is generally considered to be the highest office of the church. It was the office held by [[Joseph Smith]], founder of the movement, and the office assumed by many of Smith's claimed successors, such as [[Brigham Young]], [[Joseph Smith III]], [[Sidney Rigdon]], and [[James Strang]]. Several other titles have been associated with this office, including '''First Elder''' of the church,&lt;ref name = firstelder/&gt; '''Presiding High Priest''',&lt;ref name = PHP&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenents|dc|107|65-66}} (LDS Church edition).&lt;/ref&gt; '''President of the High Priesthood''',&lt;ref name = PHP/&gt; '''Trustee-in-Trust''' for the church,&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''4''':517.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Prophet''',&lt;ref name = PSRT&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenents|dc|107|91-92}} (LDS Church edition).&lt;/ref&gt; '''Seer''',&lt;ref name = PSRT/&gt; '''Revelator''',&lt;ref name = PSRT/&gt; and '''Translator'''.&lt;ref name = PSRT/&gt; Joseph Smith was known by all of these titles in his lifetime (although not necessarily with consistency).

[[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|Smith died]] in 1844 without having indisputably established who was to be his successor. Therefore, his death was followed by a [[succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] in which various groups followed leaders with succession claims. Years later, the office of President was reorganized in many of the resulting [[:Category:Latter Day Saint denominations|Latter Day Saint denominations]], the largest of which are [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the [[Community of Christ]] (formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints), and [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]]. Some smaller denominations, such as the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]], reject the office as an unscriptural creation.&lt;ref name = templelot&gt;William A. Sheldon, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070423084901/http://www.churchofchrist-tl.org/latter.html "A Synopsis of Church of Christ Beliefs as compared to other Latter Day Saint churches"] (Church of Christ, n.d.).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joseph Smith: the first president==
[[Image:Ovalportrait-josephsmith-Carter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter-day Saint movement]]]]
The concept that the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Christ]] would have a single presiding officer arose in late 1831. Initially, after the church's formation on April 6, 1830, Joseph Smith referred to himself as merely "an apostle of Jesus Christ, and elder of the church."&lt;ref&gt;''[http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/articles-and-covenants-circa-april-1830-dc-20?p=1 Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ]'', June 9, 1830; see also: {{lds|Doctrine and Covenents|dc|20|2}} (LDS Church edition).&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was one other [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]]—[[Oliver Cowdery]]—and several other [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]] of the church, making the formal hierarchy of the church unclear.

In September 1830, after [[Hiram Page]] claimed to have received [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelations]] for the church, a revelation to Smith stated that "no one shall be appointed to receive commandments and revelations in this church excepting my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., for he receiveth them even as Moses."&lt;ref name=DC28:2,6-7&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|28|2|,6-7|||x}} (LDS Church edition)&lt;/ref&gt; This established Smith's exclusive right to lead the church.

In early June&lt;ref&gt;Different accounts of this meeting give the date as June 3, 4, or 6. [[Richard Bushman|Bushman]] considers June 3 to be the "best guess" for the date.&lt;/ref&gt; 1831, Smith was ordained to the "high priesthood",&lt;ref name="Minute Book 2, 3 June 1831"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note that in the Minute Book 2 entry, Smith first ordains [[Lyman Wight]] and four other men "to the high priesthood", and Wight in turn ordains eighteen other men, including Smith, "to the high priesthood".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare this with the [[Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)#Restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood|Restoration of the Aaronic Priesthood]], where Smith first baptizes Oliver Cowdery, and is then in turn baptized by Cowdery.&lt;/ref&gt; along with twenty-two other men, including prominent figures in the Latter Day Saint movement such as [[Hyrum Smith]], [[Parley P. Pratt]], and [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]].&lt;ref name="Minute Book 2, 3 June 1831"&gt;{{cite book |contribution-url= http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/minute-book-2?locale=eng&amp;p=5 |contribution= 3 June 1831 |title= [http://josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/minute-book-2 Minute Book 2] |pages= 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bushman&gt;{{cite book |last= Bushman |first= Richard Lyman |authorlink= Richard Bushman |title= [[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]] |publisher= Vintage Books |year= 2007 |location= New York |pages= 156–157, 202, and 595 |isbn= 978-1-4000-7753-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As "[[High Priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priests]]", these men were higher in the priesthood hierarchy than the [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elders]] of the church. However, it was still unclear whether Smith and Cowdery's calling as [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostles]] gave them superior authority than that of other high priests.

On November 11, 1831, a revelation to Smith stated that "it must needs be that one be appointed of the high priesthood to preside over the Priesthood and he shall be called President of the high priesthood of the Church ... and again the duty of the President of the high priesthood is to preside over the whole church."&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|107|64|-65,91-92|||x}} (LDS Church edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was ordained to this position and sustained by the church on January 25, 1832, at a conference in [[Amherst, Ohio|Amherst]], [[Ohio]].&lt;ref name=Bushman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.josephsmith.net/article/prophet-seer-and-revelator|title=Prophet Seer, and Revelator: Like Unto Moses|accessdate=2007-05-25|year=2007|work=Joseph Smith: Life of the Prophet|publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, the ''Articles and Covenants of the Church of Christ'' were revised,{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} changing the phrase "an ... elder of the church" to "the first elder of this Church."&lt;ref name = firstelder&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|20|2}} (LDS Church edition)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, subsequent to 1835, Smith was sometimes referred to as the ''First Elder'' of the church. The 1835 revision also added a verse referring to the office of "president of the high priesthood (or presiding elder)",&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|20|67}} (LDS Church edition)&lt;/ref&gt; which had since been added to the church hierarchy.

==Removal==
{{see also|Common_Council_of_the_Church#Trial_of_Joseph_Smith.2C_Jr.|l1=Common Council of the Church}}
Though there has never been a popular movement in the church to have a president removed or punished, he could theoretically be removed from his position or otherwise disciplined by the [[Common Council of the Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|107|82|84}} (LDS Church edition)&lt;/ref&gt; The only president of the church brought before the Common Council was [[Joseph Smith]], who was tried for charges made against him by [[Sylvester Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Sylvester Smith]] after the return of [[Zion's Camp]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Fielding Smith]] (1953). ''Church History and Modern Revelation'' (Salt Lake City: Council of the Twelve Apostles) '''2''':21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Council determined that Joseph Smith had "acted in every respect in an honorable and proper manner with all monies and properties entrusted to his charge."&lt;ref&gt;''[[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of the Church]]'' '''2''':143.&lt;/ref&gt;

==President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==

{{main|President of the Church (LDS Church)}}
{{see also|List of presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
The President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the church's leader and the head of the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the church's highest governing body. [[Latter-day Saint]]s consider the president of the church to be a ''[[prophet, seer, and revelator]]'', and refer to him as ''the Prophet'', a title originally given to [[Joseph Smith]]. When the name of the president is used by adherents, it is usually prefaced by the title [[President (LDS Church honorific)|"President"]]. Latter-day Saints consider the president of the church to be God's spokesman to the entire world and the highest [[Priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] authority on earth, with the exclusive right to receive revelations from God on behalf of the entire church or the entire world.  The President of the Church serves as the head of the [[Council on the Disposition of the Tithes]] and the head of the [[Council of the Church]]. The President of the Church also serves as the [[ex officio]] chairman of the [[Church Educational System|Church Boards of Trustees/Education]].

==Prophet-Presidents of the Community of Christ ==
{{see also|List of Prophet-Presidents of the Community of Christ}}
In the [[Community of Christ]], formerly the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS), the president of the church's formal title is the ''Prophet-President''.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} The Prophet-President is the highest [[priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|priesthood]] leader of the church. The position is composed of several roles: (1) ''President of the Church'', (2) ''President of the High Priesthood'' and (3) ''[[Prophet, Seer, and Revelator]]'' to the church.

As ''President of the Church'', the Prophet-President is the church's chief executive and is the leader of the [[First Presidency (Community of Christ)|First Presidency]], the church's chief executive council. As ''President of the High Priesthood'', the Prophet-President is the church's leading priesthood official. (Since the initiation of the ordination of women in 1985, it is now possible for this position to be filled by a woman, though all Prophet-Presidents to date have been men.) As ''[[Prophet, Seer, and Revelator]]'', the Prophet-President is the Community of Christ's spiritual leader and can present revelations to the church to be added to the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]—an open canon of scripture, which stands with the [[Bible]] and the [[Book of Mormon]] as sacred text. In the church, only the Prophet-President is considered to be a prophet, seer, and revelator, and so far, each person to hold this position has presented additional revelations or spiritual writings to the church, which have been added to the Doctrine and Covenants.

===Succession to the Presidency===
Generally, the Prophet-President will name or ordain a successor prior to his death or retirement. The office was traditionally referred to as President of the High Priesthood. Prior to 1995, these successors had been chosen consistent with [[Lineal Succession (Latter Day Saints)|lineal succession]], even though it was not a church rule. Accordingly, the first six Prophet-Presidents following movement founder [[Joseph Smith]] were his direct descendants.

In 1995, [[Wallace B. Smith]] broke with the precedent of lineal succession by naming [[W. Grant McMurray]] as his successor.  In November 2004, McMurray resigned from the office of Prophet-President without naming a successor, citing medical and personal issues. The First Presidency, composed of McMurray's two counselors, continued to function as the church's chief executive council. A [[Joint Council (Community of Christ)|Joint Council]] of church leaders led by the [[Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)|Council of Twelve Apostles]] announced in March 2005 that [[Stephen M. Veazey]] would be Prophet-President designate. Veazey had been serving as [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve|president of the Council of Twelve]]. Delegates elected to a special [[World Conference (Community of Christ)|World Conference]] of the church approved Veazey and he was ordained as the Prophet–President on June 3, 2005.

==Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints==
The [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] continues to believe in the lineal succession through the [[inheritance|Jewish Laws of Inheritance]].  As such, the president of the Remnant Church, [[Frederick Niels Larsen]], is a direct descendant (maternal 2nd great-grandson) of Joseph Smith, Jr.

==President of The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)==
[[File:Paul Palmieri.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Paul Palmieri (The Church of Jesus Christ)|Paul Palmieri]], President of [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]]]]
{{see also|List of presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)}}
Similar to other denominations in the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], in [[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]], the ''President of the General Church'' is also a member of the [[Quorum of Twelve Apostles (Bickertonite)|Quorum of Twelve Apostles]].

==President of the Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)==
The tiny [[Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite)]], headquartered in [[Independence, Missouri]], has a First Presidency with a President and two Counselors.  Succession generally goes to the First Counselor at the time of the previous President's death or resignation (no Cutlerite president has ever resigned), subject to approval of the church membership.

==President of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints==
In the earliest years of its existence, the [[Mormon fundamentalism|Mormon fundamentalist]] [[Short Creek Community]] regarded [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) as "the only true and living church," viewing itself merely as a "body of Priesthood" set apart to perpetuate [[plural marriage]] and other "crowning ordinances" of the Gospel, such as the [[United Order]]. Hence, they tended to express a degree of admiration for contemporary LDS Church Presidents, while simultaneously insisting that they had compromised on serious matters and did not truly hold the "keys of the Presidency of the Church," which had allegedly been returned to the spirit world at the death of [[Joseph F. Smith]] in 1918. Thus, they generally valued Church direction less than direct pronouncements from their own [[Council of Friends (Woolley)|Priesthood Council]]. This "Council of Friends" consisted of seven "[[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|High Priest Apostles]]" or "Presiding High Priests," the seniormost of whom was considered "President of the Priesthood" or Prophet.

Following LDS Church President [[Spencer W. Kimball]]'s [[1978 Revelation on Priesthood]], extending the right of ordination to black African males in perceived contradiction to the teachings of [[Brigham Young]] and other early LDS leaders, the fundamentalists in [[Colorado City, Arizona]], and [[Hildale, Utah]], began to regard their parent organization as a "complete Gentile sectarian church." In 1991, [[Rulon Jeffs]], by that time sole surviving member of the Priesthood Council and thus Prophet of the group, incorporated his followers into "the Corporation of the President of the [[Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]]" or FLDS Church, with himself as President. Upon his death in 2002, Jeffs was succeeded by his First Counselor and son, [[Warren Jeffs]]. Despite the younger Jeffs' resignation from the Presidency in 2011 following his imprisonment for child sexual assault, and a brief tenure by [[Wendell Loy Nielsen]] as President of the Church's corporate assets, most FLDS members continue to regard Jeffs as a prophet.

==Latter Day Saint sects without a President of the Church==
Some sects in the Latter Day Saint movement do not accept the office of President of the Church as a valid office in the priesthood; these groups often maintain that because Jesus' original church was led by twelve apostles, not by a president or a three-man presidency, the latter-day church should be similarly organized.&lt;ref name = templelot/&gt; For instance, the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]] is governed by a [[Quorum of the Twelve]]; the members of the quorum are generally regarded as co-equal holders of the highest office in the church.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">{{italic title}}'''''Relaxado en persona''''' is a Spanish phrase, literally meaning "relaxed in person", but a euphemism for "[[Death by burning|burnt at the stake]]" in the records of the [[Spanish Inquisition]]. The majority of those "relaxed in person" from 1484 onwards were ''relapsos'' (relapsed Jews) or ''herejes'' (heretics, but also often Jews). Use of the term in source material continues until 1659 or later.

Examples:
* ''Alvaro de Segovia.. hereje judio relaxado en persona á 13 Setiembre 1485''.&lt;ref&gt;[[José Amador de los Ríos]] ''Historia social, política y religiosa de los judíos de España y Portugal'' (3 vols., Madrid, 1875-76) Volume 3 1876 p616&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Violante de Calatayud, muger de Francisco Clemente, heretico Judio, relaxado en persona en 18. de Março 1486''.&lt;ref&gt;Günter Böhm. ''Judíos en Chile colonial''. Editorial Universitaria  Santiago, Chile   1963 p111&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''herege Judaizante Relapso Relaxado en Persona año de 1659.''&lt;ref&gt;Luis González Obregón ''Época colonial: México viejo, noticias históricas, tradiciones, leyendas y costumbres del periodo de 1521 á 1821''. Oficina de la Secretaría de fomento, México. 1896 p710&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun form is ''Relajación en persona'' (literally "relaxation in person"), but the noun form is primarily used by historians rather than contemporaries.&lt;ref&gt;For example in María del Camino Fernández Giménez, ''La sentencia inquisitorial''. Editorial Complutense, Colegio Universitario Domingo de Soto de Segovia, Madrid, 2001 p120&lt;/ref&gt; Historians may also use the term anachronistically, for example as in the case of the last burning in Peru, that of Mariana de Castro, Lima, 1732.&lt;ref&gt;René Millar Carvacho ''La Inquisición de Lima: signos de su decadencia, 1726-1750'', Santiago, [[LOM Ediciones]] 2004 p78&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Riva Helfond''' (March 8, 1910 - May 13, 2002) was an American artist and printmaker best known for her [[Social realism|social realist]] studies of working people's lives.

==Early life and education==
Riva Helfond was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family. She spent some of her childhood in Russia and returned to New York at the age of eleven, living in New York or New Jersey for most of the rest of her life. Between 1928 and 1940, she studied at the School of Industrial Art and the Art Students League; her teachers included [[William von Schlegell]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], and [[Morris Kantor]] for painting and [[Harry Sternberg]] for printmaking. Among her fellow students were [[Alexander Brook]] and her future husband, the sculptor William (Bill) Barrett (d. 1967).

==Teaching==
Helfond began teaching in the College Art Association Program (1933–36) and then taught printmaking at the Harlem Arts Community Center (1936–38). Initially she taught lithography alongside [[Jacob Lawrence]], [[Romare Bearden]], and others before moving to the graphic arts division, where she worked with Louis Lozowick and Jacob Kainen, and the silkscreen division, which was supervised by [[Anthony Velonis]] and which had [[Harry Gottlieb]] and [[Elizabeth Olds]] as founding members. Among her students at the Center was [[Robert Blackburn (artist)|Robert Blackburn]], who would go on to found New York's Printmaking Workshop in the 1940s. Later on, Helfond taught printmaking at New York University (1964), and she was on the faculty of Union College in Cranford, New Jersey, from 1980 onwards.

==Artwork==
From 1936 to 1941, Helfond was an artist in the New York [[Works Progress Administration]] program's graphics division, creating work in a variety of media, including lithographs, woodcuts, etchings, aquatints, collograph, and silkscreens. Some of her work shows the impact that color had as it entered American printmaking during this period, and she was adventurous in exploring the possibilities opened up by screen printing.&lt;ref&gt;Viso, Olga M. [http://tfaoi.org/aa/9aa/9aa175.htm  "The Golden Age of American Printmaking 1900-1950."] In ''Artists of the American Scene: A Selection from the Dr. Robert B. and Mrs. Dorothy M. Gronlund Collection of Twentieth-Century American Prints'', Norton Gallery of Art exhibition catalog, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; She printed all of her own work, which ranged from austere, often monochromatic social realist portraits of working people and cityscapes in the 1920s and 1930s to colorful, abstract, lyrical landscapes in later years. Some of her color abstractions originated as watercolors from nature during travels in Greece and France and were then turned into oil paintings.

Helfond was politically progressive, and along with contemporaries like Elizabeth Olds, [[Beatrice Mandelman]], and [[Minna Citron]], she is especially well known for works that "pointedly condemned the state of labor, and the relationship between big business and big government, in the 1930s." &lt;ref&gt;Doss, Erika. "Toward an Iconography of American Labor: Work, Workers, and the Work Ethic in American Art, 1930-1945." ''Design Issues'', 1997, pp. 53-66.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these include ''Custom Made'' (1940), a lithograph showing a woman slumped over her work in a WPA sewing room, and ''Snow Clearing'' (1933), showing men at work shoveling a street.

There are also a number of prints about the grim lives of coal miners, such as ''Miner and Wife'' (1937), an ''American Gothic''&amp;ndash;style portrait of a couple, with the husband showing a closed fist; ''Out of the Pit'' (1935), a double portrait of miners with blackened faces; and ''Coal Picker'' (1938), showing elderly women scavenging in a coal mine.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, Elizabeth M. "Viewing Work Historically Through Art: Incorporating the Visual Arts into Organizational Studies." ''Journal of Management History'', vol. 12, no. 2, 2006, pp. 137-153.&lt;/ref&gt; After Helfond married Bill Barrett, whose Welsh relatives worked in the mines, she used these new connections to bring other artists interested in social justice together with the miners. Helfond ran into several obstacles while working in the coal districts of Pennsylvania. For one thing, she was irked that the gatherings of miners and her male artist friends in the local bars tended to exclude her and other women, making it harder for her to develop the relationships necessary to her work.&lt;ref&gt;Langa, Helen. ''Radical Art: Printmaking and the Left in 1930s New York''. University  of California Press, 2004, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Another obstacle sprang from cultural differences: Helfond recounted how in the mining town of Lansford, the local women became less friendly when she revealed that she was Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Marion A., and Deborah Dash Moore, eds. ''Gender and Jewish History''. Indiana University Press, 2011, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these challenges, Helfond's prints of coal miners are considered an important addition to the body of work documenting the lives of the working poor during the New Deal.&lt;ref&gt;Francey, Mary. [http://www.tfaoi.com/aa/9aa/9aa156.htm "American Women at Work: Women Printmakers and the Federal Art Project". 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Helfond's work has been exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. (1960), the Newark Museum of Fine Arts (1964, 1967), and elsewhere. It is represented in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art (New York), the Brooklyn Museum, the Boston Museum of Fine Art, the Springfield Museum of Fine Art, the Newark Museum of Fine Art, and the Library of Congress, among other institutions. In 2009, her work was featured in the exhibition "Industrial Strength: Precisionism and New Jersey" at the Jersey City Museum.

Helfond counted as friends a wide circle of Abstract Expressionist artists and critics, including [[Willem DeKooning]], [[Arshile Gorky]], [[Franz Kline]], and [[Harold Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Greengard, Stephen. "Ten Crucial Years: A Panel Discussion by Six WPA Artists." ''Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts'', vol. 1, no. 1, Spring 1986, pp. 46-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life she lived in Plainfield, New Jersey, where she owned and managed the Barrett Art Gallery on East Front Street, which she had started with her husband in the 1960s. In the early 1950s, she designed a rose window for the First Unitarian Society of Plainfield's All Souls Church.

'''Shlomo Carlebach''' ({{lang-he-n|שלמה קרליבך}}), known as '''Reb Shlomo''' to his followers, was a singer, rabbi, and spiritual leader.

Known as “Rabbi Shlomo” to his followers, Carlebach (14 January 1925 – 20 October 1994), was a [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[rabbi]], religious teacher, composer, and singer who was known as "The Singing Rabbi" during his lifetime.

Although his roots lay in traditional [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[yeshiva|yeshivot]], he branched out to create his own style combining [[Hasidic Judaism]], warmth and personal interaction, public concerts, and song-filled [[synagogue]] services. At various times he lived in [[Manhattan]], [[San Francisco]], [[Toronto]] and a [[Moshav]] he founded, [[Mevo Modi'im]], Israel. Carlebach is the subject of [[Soul Doctor]], a musical that debuted on Broadway in 2013.

Carlebach is considered by many to be the foremost Jewish religious songwriter of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judaism.com/bio.asp?author=Shlomo%20Carlebach "Shlomo Carlebach", Judaism.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107023632/http://www.judaism.com/bio.asp?author=Shlomo%20Carlebach |date=November 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyork.com/broadway-show-tickets/soul-doctor/ "About Soul Doctor" NewYork.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105132431/http://www.newyork.com/broadway-show-tickets/soul-doctor/ |date=2013-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a career that spanned 40 years, he composed thousands of melodies and recorded more than 25 albums that continue to have widespread popularity and appeal. His influence also continues to this day in  "[[Carlebach minyan]]im" and Jewish religious gatherings in many cities and remote pristine areas around the globe.

Carlebach was also considered a pioneer of the [[Baal teshuva movement]] ("returnees to Judaism"), encouraging disenchanted Jewish youth to re-embrace their heritage, using his special style of enlightened teaching, and his melodies, songs, and highly inspiring story telling.

==Biography==
Shlomo Carlebach was descended from old rabbinical dynasties in pre-[[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] Germany. The [[Carlebach]] family is a notable [[History of the Jews in Germany|Jewish family originally from Germany]] that now lives all over the world. He was born in 1925 in Berlin, where his father, Rabbi [[Hartwig Naftali Carlebach]] (1889–1967), was an Orthodox rabbi.&lt;ref name=NYT-19941022&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/22/nyregion/no-headline-604178.html | first=Ari | last=Goldman | title=Obituary | newspaper=New York Times | date=October 22, 1994 | accessdate=September 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a twin brother, Rabbi [[Eli Chaim Carlebach]]. His family left Germany in 1931 and lived in [[Baden bei Wien]], Austria and by 1933 in Switzerland.

Carlebach emigrated to Lithuania in 1938 where he studied at a [[yeshiva]]. In 1938 his father became the rabbi of Congregation Kehilath Jacob, a small synagogue on West 79th Street in New York City's [[Upper West Side]].&lt;ref name=NYT-19941022/&gt; Carlebach came to New York in 1939 via Great Britain. He and his twin brother Rabbi [[Eli Chaim Carlebach]] took over the rabbinate of the synagogue after their father's death in 1967.&lt;ref name=NYT-19941022/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carlebachshul.org/About%20Us/History.htm "About Us", Congregation Kehilath Jacob, "The Carlebach Shul"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlebach studied at [[Yeshiva Torah Vodaas]] and [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and [[Beth Medrash Gevoha]] in [[Lakewood, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="ottowa"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ojk0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=afUIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5165,4037061&amp;dq=lakewood+yeshiva&amp;hl=en|title=Rabbi in recital of own competitions|date=25 Oct 1975|publisher=Ottawa Citizen|pages=75|accessdate=11 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His aptitude for Torah study was recognized by great Torah scholars and teachers, among them Rabbi [[Shlomo Heiman]], and the Rosh Yeshiva of [[Bais Medrash Gevoha]], Rabbi [[Aharon Kotler]]. He was considered one of the top students of Rabbi Kotler.&lt;ref name="Rakeffet"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Yitzchok Hutner]], who gave Carlebach [[Semikha]], considered it a loss to the Torah world that he chose a career in musical Jewish outreach over one as a scholar and teacher. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} During his yeshiva studies he was often asked to lead the [[Jewish services|services]] as a [[hazzan]].

In 1950, Carlebach set up a small Torah learning group which he called T.S.G.G. (pronounced TASGIG), an acronym for "Taste And See God Is Good".&lt;ref name="jpress"/&gt;

That year, Carlebach attended a Hebrew language [[ulpan]] at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]] (JTS), where he used to play hasiddic melodies on the piano. One of those impressed with his playing was Sara Schafler-Kelman, who invited Carlebach to sing chasidic tunes at the [[Hillel: The Foundation for Jewish Campus Life|Hillel Center]] on Convent Avenue, an offer which he reluctantly accepted. Schafler prepared a poster for the event, entitled "The Place of Music in the Hassidic Tradition". This was Carlebach's first invited performance. Years later, Carlebach said to Schafler-Kelman, "You gave me a title for my life's work."&lt;ref name="jpress"&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/uncategorized/reb-shlomo-carlebachs-early-years-in-new-york/2013/11/21/0/ Reb Shlomo Carlebach’s Early Years in New York]. The Jewish Press. Nov 21, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Carlebach began learning English in a special program at Columbia University, having previously conversed mainly in Yiddish. Becoming fluent in English only at the age of 26, he developed an unusual grammar, mixing Yiddish and English, that became his hallmark, and later influenced the language of his followers, as well as many other members of the neo-hassidic movement.&lt;ref name="jpress"/&gt;

Carlebach became a disciple of Rabbi [[Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn]], the sixth [[Rebbe#Hasidic Rebbe|Rebbe]] of the [[Chabad|Chabad-Lubavitch]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steinhardt|first=Joanna|title=Neo-Hasids in the Land of Israel|journal=Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions|date=May 2010|volume=13|issue=4|page=22|jstor=10.1525/nr.2010.13.4.22|doi=10.1525/nr.2010.13.4.22}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1951-1954, he worked as one of the first emissaries ([[Shaliach (Chabad)|''shluchim'']]) of Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe who urged him to use his special skills and go to college campuses to reconnect Jews to Judaism.&lt;ref name="Rakeffet" /&gt;

In 1972, he married Elaine Neila Glick, a teacher. They had two daughters, Nedara (Dari) and Neshama. [[Neshama Carlebach]] is a songwriter and singer in her own right, basing herself on her father's style and name.

==Music career==
Carlebach began writing songs at the end of the 1950s, primarily based on verses from the [[Tanakh]] or the [[Siddur]] set to his own music. Although he composed thousands of songs, he could not read musical notes. Many of his soulful renderings of Torah verses became standards in the wider Jewish community, including ''Am Yisrael Chai'' ("[The] Nation [of] Israel Lives"—composed on behalf of the plight of [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jewry]] in the mid-1960s), ''Pitchu Li'' ("Open [for] Me [the Gates of Righteousness]") and ''Borchi Nafshi'' ("[May] My Soul Bless [God]").

The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported in its obituary of Carlebach that his singing career began in [[Greenwich Village]], where he met [[Bob Dylan]], [[Pete Seeger]] and other folk singers who encouraged his career, and helped him get a spot at the Berkeley Folk Festival in 1966.&lt;ref name=NYT-19941022/&gt; But Carlebach was actually recording well before this and was invited to the festival by one of its organizers after she heard a recording of Carlebach.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|X_9w7eWC-0s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his appearance at the Berkeley Folk Festival he decided to remain in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to reach out to what he called "lost Jewish souls"—runaways and drug-addicted youth. His local followers opened a center called the House of Love and Prayer in the [[Richmond District, San Francisco|Inner Richmond district]] of [[San Francisco]], to reach out to disaffected youth with song and dance and communal gatherings.  He became known as "The Singing Rabbi". Through his infectious music and his innate caring many Jews feel that he inspired and reconnected thousands of Jewish youngsters and adults, otherwise lost to Judaism.

Some Carlebach melodies were entered in Israel's annual Hasidic Song Festival.&lt;ref name="reinvent"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1969, his song ''Ve'haer Eneinu'', sung by the Shlosharim won first prize. The Hasidic festivals were a yearly event that helped to popularize his music. He also produced albums with a more [[Jewish prayer services|liturgical]] sound. Some of the musicians he worked with during this period added a psychedelic tinge and a wider range of backup instrumentation. Carlebach now spent much of his time in Israel, living in [[Moshav]] [[Me'or Modi'im]].

Carlebach's songs were characterized by relatively short melodies and traditional lyrics. His catchy new tunes were easy to learn and became part of the prayer services in many synagogues around the world.&lt;ref name="reinvent" /&gt;

Returning to New York City, Carlebach also became known for his stories and Hasidic teachings. As part of his performances he spoke of inspirational subjects, rooted in [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidism]] and [[Kabbalah]]. Some of his teachings have been published by his students and appear alongside his recorded songs. Carlebach spread the teachings of [[Chabad]], [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslov]], and popularized the writings of, among others, the [[Izhbitza – Radzin (Hasidic dynasty)|Rebbe of Ishbitz]], [[Mordechai Yosef Leiner]], and Rebbe [[Kalonymus Kalman Shapira]] of Piasetzno.

Carlebach became the Rabbi of the [[Carlebach Shul]] on West 79th Street. He continued to perform regularly at concerts, and to record various albums of his original melodies.

==Death==
[[File:Grave of Shlomo Carlebach.jpg|thumb|right|Carlebach's grave.]]

Carlebach died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on a flight to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/culture/article/shlomo_carlebachs_life_comes_to_the_stage_in_soul_doctor_20120814 "Shlomo Carlebach’s life comes to the stage in ‘Soul Doctor{{'"}} (Aug 14, 2012) ''Jewish Journal'']&lt;/ref&gt; His body was flown to Israel for burial at [[Har HaMenuchot]]. During the funeral the mourners sang Carlebach's songs, including ''Chasdei Hashem Ki Lo Samnu.'' Israel's [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel#Ashkenazi|Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi]] [[Yisrael Meir Lau]] gave a [[eulogy]]. An annual memorial service is held on the 16th of [[Cheshvan]] at Carlebach's grave site. Additional memorial events take place throughout Israel and around the world.

==Legacy and influence==
According to Rabbi [[Jonathan Rosenblatt]], Carlebach "changed the expectations of the prayer experience from decorous and sombre to uplifting and ecstatic as he captivated generations with elemental melodies and stories of miraculous human saintliness, modesty and unselfishness."&lt;ref&gt;A New Dialogue with the Divine, May 26, 2009, Jewish Week, [[Jonathan Rosenblatt]]  {{cite web |url=http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c39_a15840/News/International.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528092126/http://www.thejewishweek.com/viewArticle/c39_a15840/News/International.html |archivedate=2009-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his lifetime, Carlebach was often relegated to pariah status, marginalized by many of his peers. Because in his [[yeshiva]] years he had excelled in [[Talmud]] studies, many had hoped that he would later become a [[Rosh Yeshiva]] or a similar figure; many harbored ill will toward his chosen path in music and outreach. In addition, his activities in public were
often not considered proper according to traditional orthodox teachings. This included encouraging and listening to women singing (not relatives) and touching women affectionately (violating Orthodox standards of shomer negiah).

In the years since his death, Carlebach's music has been embraced by many faiths as spiritual music. His music can be heard today in synagogues, [[Carlebach minyan]]im, churches, gospel choirs and temples worldwide. Many musical groups state that they draw inspiration from Carlebach and his music including [[Matisyahu]], [[Chaim-Dovid Saracik]], [[Sam Glaser]], [[Moshav Band]],  [[Benyamin Steinberg]], [[Reva l'sheva]], [[Naftali Abramson]],  [[Gili Houpt]], [[Yehuda Green]], [[Aharon Razel]] and others. Various community leaders and rabbis were also influenced by him.

A musical written about his life, ''[[Soul Doctor]]'', by [[Daniel Wise (playwright)|Daniel Wise]] was presented as a limited engagement off-Broadway in 2008 and in [[New Orleans]] in 2010, and was received with critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://broadwayworld.com/article/SOUL_DOCTOR_THE_SHLOMO_MUSICAL_Returns_To_New_Orleans_For_PreBway_Run_20101101|title=SOUL DOCTOR: THE SHLOMO MUSICAL Returns To New Orleans For Pre-Bway Run|publisher=broadwayworld.com|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The musical had a brief off-Broadway run as a guest attraction at [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in the Summer of 2012,&lt;ref name=SoulDoctor /&gt; and earned [[Eric Anderson (actor)|Eric Anderson]] a [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical]] nomination for his portrayal of Shlomo Carlebach. ''Soul Doctor'' opened on Broadway August 15, 2013.

A documentary film about Carlebach directed by [[Boaz Shahak]], ''You Never Know'', was released at the [[Jerusalem Film Festival]], also in 2008.

==Controversy==
Carlebach's approach towards ''[[kiruv]]'' (the popular Hebrew term for Orthodox Judaism outreach) was often tinged with controversy.&lt;ref name=SoulDoctor&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/08/14/3103976/shlomo-carlebachs-life-comes-to-the-big-stage-in-soul-doctor Klug, Lisa Alcalay, ''Shlomo Carlebach’s life comes to the stage in ‘Soul Doctor’'', [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]], 14 August 2012.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104113346/http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/08/14/3103976/shlomo-carlebachs-life-comes-to-the-big-stage-in-soul-doctor |date=4 November 2012 }} Retrieved 30 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Put most favorably, "He operated outside traditional Jewish structures in style and substance, and spoke about God and His love in a way that could make other rabbis uncomfortable."&lt;ref name=mixed&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, ''[[Lilith (magazine)|Lilith]]'' magazine, a Jewish feminist publication, catalogued allegations of sexual impropriety against him. Specifically, named accusers are quoted in this article, as well as unnamed sources and Jewish communal leaders with knowledge of the allegations.&lt;ref name=mixed /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = Rabbi Shlomo Carlebach's Shadow Side
|author = Sarah Blustain

|url = http://lilith.org/articles/rabbi-shlomo-carlebachs-shadow-side/
|accessdate = 2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--However, even in his lifetime, Carlebach was approached about these matters. Lilith reports that people present when he was confronted say he acknowledged impropriety, expressed regret, and agreed that, to some degree, his behavior needed to change. The article indicates that most in Carlebach's circles were uncomfortable voicing their accusations at the time, leading to a widespread policy of "silence" which had, in part, enabled his continued offenses. Since his death, many others have come forward with allegations that Carlebach solicited them, touched them during dancing, or on private walks. Some of the alleged offenses were toward young women, teenagers in camps or youth-group retreats. Some of his older accusers point out that they were approached by him at a time in their lives when they were particularly vulnerable, as many of them were transitioning into Jewish life and practice, and as such undergoing large changes in their lives. As their sole spiritual leader at the time, Carlebach held a lot of potential power over them. Most of his offenses were unexpected and undesired touching, or telephone calls "in the middle of the night", which his accusers describe as disturbing, but also as odd. The Lilith article opines that for many, his legacy is mixed. Even many of his victims state that he still had great positive impact on their lives, despite the irreparable hurt he caused. The article suggests that Carlebach may have had a sexual addiction, and had his problem been more public, and more help been available to him, it is possible he would have willingly sought it.--&gt; His followers reject these accusations and claim that it is unfair to accuse him at a time when he could not respond to his accusers.&lt;ref name=mixed /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/music/115376/carlebach-broken-mirror/2 Magid, Shaul, "Carlebach’s Broken Mirror"] (1 November 2012) ''[[Tablet Magazine]]'', Retrieved 30 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, accusations had already been made as early as the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/my-sisters-i-hear-you/|title=My sisters, I hear you|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in light of the [[#metoo]] movement some have begun to question whether Jewish communities should still use his music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forward.com/opinion/389082/its-time-to-stop-singing-shlomo-carlebachs-songs/?attribution=articles-article-related-1-headline|title=Opinion {{!}} It's Time To Stop Singing Shlomo Carlebach's Songs|work=The Forward|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://forward.com/opinion/389110/should-we-still-be-singing-shlomo-carlebachs-songs-in-the-metoo-era/|title=Opinion {{!}} Should We Still Be Singing Carlebach?|work=The Forward|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018 his daughter Neshama wrote an open letter to the women who were harmed by Carlebach. She wrote "I accept the fullness of who my father was, flaws and all. I am angry with him. And I refuse to see his faults as the totality of who he was."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/my-sisters-i-hear-you/|title=My sisters, I hear you|work=The Times of Israel|access-date=2018-06-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Sirens''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] singular: {{lang|grc|Σειρήν}} ''Seirēn''; Greek plural: {{lang|grc|Σειρῆνες}} ''Seirēnes'') were dangerous creatures, who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and singing voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. Roman poets placed them on some small islands called [[Sirenum scopuli]]. In some later, rationalized traditions, the literal geography of the "flowery" island of [[Anthemoessa]], or Anthemusa,&lt;ref&gt;"We must steer clear of the Sirens, their enchanting song, their meadow starred with flowers" is [[Robert Fagles]]' rendering of ''Odyssey'' 12.158–9.&lt;/ref&gt; is fixed: sometimes on [[Cape Pelorum]] and at others in the islands known as the [[Sirenuse]], near [[Paestum]], or in [[Capri|Capreae]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Strabo]] i. 22; [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]]'s Homeric commentaries §1709; Servius I.e.&lt;/ref&gt; All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.

==Etymology==
[[File:Greek - Vase in the Form of a Siren - Walters 482020.jpg|thumb|left|Archaic perfume vase in the shape of Siren, c. 540 BC]]
The etymology of the name is at present contested. [[Robert S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. P. Beekes, ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 1316 f.&lt;/ref&gt; Others connect the name to σειρά (''seirá'' "rope, cord") and εἴρω (''eírō'' "to tie, join, fasten"), resulting in the meaning "binder, entangler",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the [[wikt:siren|entry in the Wiktionary]] and the [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=Siren entry] in the ''Online Etymology Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; i.&amp;nbsp;e. one who binds or entangles through magic song. This could be connected to the famous scene of [[Odysseus]] being bound to the [[Mast (sailing)|mast]] of his ship, in order to resist their song.&lt;ref&gt;Homer, ''Odyssey'', book 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sirens were believed to combine women and birds in various ways. In early Greek art, Sirens were represented as birds with large women's heads, bird feathers and scaly feet. Later, they were represented as female figures with the legs of birds, with or without wings, playing a variety of musical instruments, especially harps. The tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia ''[[Suda]]'' says that from their chests up, Sirens had the form of sparrows, and below they were women or, alternatively, that they were little birds with women's faces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin//search.pl?search_method=QUERY&amp;login=&amp;enlogin=&amp;searchstr=sigma,280&amp;field=adlerhw_gr&amp;db=REAL Suda on-line]&lt;/ref&gt; Birds were chosen because of their beautiful voices. Later Sirens were sometimes depicted as beautiful women, whose bodies, not only their voices, are seductive.

Originally, Sirens were shown to be male or female, but the male Siren disappeared from art around fifth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.colorado.edu/classics/exhibits/GreekVases/essays/200637tsirens.htm|title=CU Classics – Greek Vase Exhibit – Essays – Sirens|website=www.colorado.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-century Roman historian [[Pliny the Elder]] discounted Sirens as pure fable, "although Dinon, the father of Clearchus, a celebrated writer, asserts that they exist in [[India]], and that they charm men by their song, and, having first lulled them to sleep, tear them to pieces."&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' X, 70.&lt;/ref&gt; In his notebooks, [[Leonardo da Vinci]] wrote of the Siren, "The siren sings so sweetly that she lulls the mariners to sleep; then she climbs upon the ships and kills the sleeping mariners."

In 1917, [[Franz Kafka]] wrote in ''The Silence of the Sirens'', "Now the Sirens have a still more fatal weapon than their song, namely their silence. And though admittedly such a thing never happened, it is still conceivable that someone might possibly have escaped from their singing; but from their silence certainly never."

''[[Dionysiaca]] 13.309 &amp;'' [[John Tzetzes|John Tzetzes.]] ''[http://www.theoi.com/Text/TzetzesChiliades1.html#14 Chiliades, 1.14 line 338]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Melpomene]]&lt;ref&gt;John Tzetzes.

''Commentary on the Aeneid of Vergil,'' ''Book 5.864''&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Sterope]]. In [[Euripides]]' play, ''[[Helen (play)|Helen]]'' (167), Helen in her anguish calls upon "Winged maidens, daughters of the Earth ([[Chthonic|Chthon]])." Although they lured mariners, the Greeks portrayed the Sirens in their "meadow starred with flowers" and not as sea deities. Roman writers linked the Sirens more closely to the sea, as daughters of Phorcys.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]]. V. 846&lt;/ref&gt; Sirens are found in many Greek stories, notably in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]''.

Their number is variously reported as from two to five. In the ''[[Odyssey]]'', [[Homer]] says nothing of their origin or names, but gives the number of the Sirens as two.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 12.52&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers mention both their names and number: some state that there were three, Peisinoe, Aglaope and Thelxiepeia&lt;ref&gt;Tzetzes, ''ad Lycophron'' 7l2; Pseudo-Apollodorus, Bibliotheca E7. 18&lt;/ref&gt; or Parthenope, Ligeia, and Leucosia&lt;ref&gt;Eustathius, loc. cit.; Strabo v. §246, 252 commentary on Virgil's ''Georgics'' iv. 562&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Apollonius of Rhodes|Apollonius]] followed [[Hesiod]] gives their names as Thelxinoe, Molpe, and Aglaophonos&lt;ref&gt;Scholiast on Homer's Odyssey 12. 168, trans. Evelyn-White&lt;/ref&gt;; [[Suda|Suidas]] gives their names as Thelxiepeia, Peisinoe, and Ligeia&lt;ref&gt;Suidas s.v.

Their individual names are variously rendered in the later sources as Thelxiepeia/Thelxiope/Thelxinoe, Molpe, Himerope, Aglaophonos/Aglaope/Aglaopheme, Pisinoe/Peisinoë/Peisithoe, [[Parthenope (Siren)|Parthenope]], Ligeia, Leucosia, Raidne, and Teles.&lt;ref&gt;Linda Phyllis Austern, Inna Naroditskaya, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5IBSGG9YegwC&amp;pg=PT27&amp;dq=three+sirens+mythology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=I2X-ToWyJ_DN4QSlkNGNCA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=three%20sirens%20mythology&amp;f=false ''Music of the Sirens''], Indiana University Press, 2006, p.18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Hansen, William F.

==Mythology==

=== Demeter ===
[[File:Ulysses And The Sirens by Léon Belly.jpg|thumb|upright|''Odysseus And The Sirens'', painting by [[Léon Belly]], 1867]]

According to [[Ovid]] (43 BC–17 AD), the Sirens were the companions of young [[Persephone]].&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' V, 551.&lt;/ref&gt; They were given wings by [[Demeter]] to search for Persephone when she was abducted. However, the ''Fabulae'' of [[Hyginus]] (64 BC–17 AD) has Demeter cursing the Sirens for failing to intervene in the abduction of Persephone. According to [[Hyginus]], sirens were fated to live only until the mortals who heard their songs were able to pass by them.&lt;ref&gt;Pseudo-Hyginus, ''Fabulae'' 141 (trans. Grant).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muses ===
It is also said that [[Hera]], queen of the gods, persuaded the Sirens to enter a singing contest with the [[Muse]]s. The Muses won the competition and then plucked out all of the Sirens' feathers and made crowns out of them.&lt;ref name="Lempriere"&gt;Lemprière 768.&lt;/ref&gt; Out of their anguish from losing the competition, writes [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera, Greece|Aptera]] ("featherless"), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called ''Leukai'' ("the white ones", modern [[Souda (island)|Souda]]).&lt;ref&gt;Caroline M. Galt, "A marble fragment at Mount Holyoke College from the Cretan city of Aptera", ''Art and Archaeology'' '''6''' (1920:150).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Argonautica ===
[[File:WATERHOUSE - Ulises y las Sirenas (National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, 1891. Óleo sobre lienzo, 100.6 x 202 cm).jpg|thumb|left|''[[Odysseus]] and the Sirens'', an 1891 painting by [[John William Waterhouse]]]]

In the ''[[Argonautica]]'' (third century BC), [[Jason]] had been warned by [[Chiron]] that [[Orpheus]] would be necessary in his journey.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius Rhodius, ''Argonautica'' IV, 891–919.&lt;/ref&gt; When Orpheus heard their voices, he drew out his [[lyre]] and played his music more beautifully than they, drowning out their voices. One of the crew, however, the sharp-eared hero [[Butes]], heard the song and leapt into the sea, but he was caught up and carried safely away by the goddess [[Aphrodite]].
{{clear}}

=== Odyssey ===
[[Odysseus]] was curious as to what the Sirens sang to him, and so, on the advice of [[Circe]], he had all of his sailors plug their ears with [[beeswax]] and tie him to the mast. He ordered his men to leave him tied tightly to the mast, no matter how much he would beg. When he heard their beautiful [[song]], he ordered the sailors to untie him but they bound him tighter. When they had passed out of earshot, Odysseus demonstrated with his frowns to be released.&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' XII, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Some post-Homeric authors state that the Sirens were fated to die if someone heard their singing and escaped them, and that after Odysseus passed by they therefore flung themselves into the water and perished.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'' 141; [[Lycophron]], ''Alexandra'' 712 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sirens and death==

She appeared to have some [[psychopomp]] characteristics, guiding the dead on the after-life journey. The cast [[terracotta]] figure bears traces of its original white pigment. The woman bears the feet, wings and tail of a bird. The sculpture is conserved in the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain]], in Madrid.

The Sirens were called the Muses of the lower world, classical scholar [[Walter Copland Perry]] (1814–1911) observed: "Their song, though irresistibly sweet, was no less sad than sweet, and lapped both body and soul in a fatal lethargy, the forerunner of death and corruption."&lt;ref&gt;Perry, "The sirens in ancient literature and art", in ''The Nineteenth Century'', reprinted in ''Choice Literature: a monthly magazine'' (New York) '''2''' (September–December 1883:163).&lt;/ref&gt; Their song is continually calling on Persephone. The term "[[wikt:siren song|siren song]]" refers to an appeal that is hard to resist but that, if heeded, will lead to a bad conclusion. Later writers have implied that the Sirens were [[Cannibalism|cannibals]], based on [[Circe]]'s description of them "lolling there in their meadow, round them heaps of corpses rotting away, rags of skin shriveling on their bones."&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 12.45–6, Fagles' translation.&lt;/ref&gt; As linguist [[Jane Ellen Harrison]] (1850–1928) notes of "[[Keres (mythology)|The Ker]] as siren": "It is strange and beautiful that Homer should make the Sirens appeal to the spirit, not to the flesh."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison 198&lt;/ref&gt; The siren song is a promise to Odysseus of mantic truths; with a false promise that he will live to tell them, they sing,&lt;blockquote&gt;Once he hears to his heart's content, sails on, a wiser man.&lt;br&gt;We know all the pains that the Greeks and Trojans once endured&lt;br&gt;on the spreading plain of Troy when the gods willed it so—&lt;br&gt;all that comes to pass on the fertile earth, we know it all!&lt;ref&gt;''Odyssey'' 12.188–91, Fagles' translation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

"They are mantic creatures like the [[Sphinx]] with whom they have much in common, knowing both the past and the future", Harrison observed. "Their song takes effect at midday, in a windless calm. The end of that song is [[death]]."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, 199.&lt;/ref&gt; That the sailors' flesh is rotting away, suggests it has not been eaten. It has been suggested that, with their feathers stolen, their divine nature kept them alive, but unable to provide food for their visitors, who starved to death by refusing to leave.&lt;ref&gt;Liner notes to ''[[Fresh Aire VI]]'' by Jim Shey, Classics Department, University of Wisconsin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Christian belief and modern reception==
[[File:The Siren.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Siren (Waterhouse painting)|The Siren]]'', by [[John William Waterhouse]], c.&amp;nbsp;1900, depicted as a fish-chimera]]

By the fourth century, when [[paganism|pagan]] beliefs were overtaken by [[Christianity]], the belief in literal sirens was discouraged. Although [[Saint Jerome]], who produced the Latin [[Vulgate]] version of the bible, used the word ''sirens'' to translate Hebrew ''tannīm'' ("jackals") in Isaiah 13:22, and also to translate a word for "owls" in Jeremiah 50:39, this was explained by [[Ambrose]] to be a mere symbol or allegory for worldly temptations, and not an endorsement of the Greek myth.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, ''Exposition of the Christian Faith'', Book 3, chap. 1, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armitage Siren.JPG|thumb|left|''The Siren'', [[Edward Armitage]], 1888]]The Early Christian [[euhemerist]] interpretation of mythologized human beings received a long-lasting boost from [[Isidore of Seville|Isidore's]] ''[[Etymologiae]]'':

{{quote|They [the Greeks] imagine that "there were three Sirens, part virgins, part birds," with wings and claws. "One of them sang, another played the flute, the third the lyre. They drew sailors, decoyed by song, to shipwreck. According to the truth, however, they were prostitutes who led travelers down to poverty and were said to impose shipwreck on them." They had wings and claws because Love flies and wounds. They are said to have stayed in the waves because a wave created [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Robert McQueen (1999). ''Early Christians and Animals.'' London: Routledge, 120. Translation of Isidore, ''Etymologiae'' (c. 600–636 AD), Book 11, chap. 3 ("Portents"), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Sirens continued to be used as a symbol for the dangerous temptation embodied by women regularly throughout Christian art of the medieval era; however, in the 17th century, some [[Jesuit]] writers began to assert their actual existence, including [[Cornelius a Lapide]], who said of woman, "her glance is that of the fabled [[basilisk]], her voice a siren's voice—with her voice she enchants, with her beauty she deprives of reason—voice and sight alike deal destruction and death."&lt;ref&gt;Longworth, T. Clifton, and Paul Tice (2003). ''A Survey of Sex &amp; Celibracy in Religion.'' San Diego: The Book Tree, 61. Originally published as ''The Devil a Monk Would Be: A Survey of Sex &amp; Celibacy in Religion'' (1945).&lt;/ref&gt; [[:es:Antonio de Lorea|Antonio de Lorea]] also argued for their existence, and [[Athanasius Kircher]] argued that compartments must have been built for them aboard [[Noah's Ark]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Patricia Ann (ed.) (1986). ''Literature and Lore of the Sea.'' Amsterdam: Editions Rodopi, 270.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ulysses and the Sirens by H.J. Draper.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ulysses and the Sirens]]'', by [[Herbert James Draper]], c.&amp;nbsp;1909]]

[[Charles Burney]] expounded c. 1789, in ''A General History of Music'': "The name, according to [[Samuel Bochart|Bochart]], who derives it from the Phoenician, implies a ''songstress.'' Hence it is probable, that in ancient times there may have been excellent singers, but of corrupt morals, on the coast of Sicily, who by seducing voyagers, gave rise to this fable."&lt;ref&gt;Austern, Linda Phyllis, and Inna Naroditskaya (eds.) (2006). ''Music of the Sirens.'' Bloomington, IN: University of Indiana Press, 72.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Lemprière]] in his ''Classical Dictionary'' (1827) wrote, "Some suppose that the Sirens were a number of lascivious women in Sicily, who prostituted themselves to strangers, and made them forget their pursuits while drowned in unlawful pleasures. The etymology of [[Samuel Bochart|Bochart]], who deduces the name from a [[Phoenician language|Phoenician term]] denoting a ''songstress,''&lt;!--italics in original--&gt; favors the explanation given of the fable by [[Christian Tobias Damm|Damm]].&lt;ref&gt;Damm, perhaps ''Mythologie der Griechen und Römer'' (ed. Leveiow). Berlin, 1820.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinguished critic makes the Sirens to have been excellent singers, and divesting the fables respecting them of all their terrific features, he supposes that by the charms of music and song they detained travellers,&lt;!--travellers in the original--&gt; and made them altogether forgetful of their native land."&lt;ref&gt;Lemprière 768. Brackets in the original.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme of perilous mythical female creatures seeking to seduce men with their beautiful singing is paralleled in the Danish medieval ballad known as "[[Elvehøj]]", in which the singers are [[Elf|elves]]. The ballad is also conserved in a Swedish version. A modern literary appropriation of the myth is to be seen in [[Clemens Brentano]]'s ''Lore Lay'' ballad, published in his novel ''Godwi oder Das steinerne Bild der Mutter'' (1801).

'''''State of Grace''''' is an American [[comedy-drama]] series that ran for two seasons on the [[Freeform (TV channel)|Fox Family]] channel during 2001 and 2002.

==Plot==
The show is centered on two 12-year-old girls from very different backgrounds, Hannah and Grace, who are best friends. Hannah is from a middle class [[Jewish]] family and lives with her parents, her grandmother, and her uncle. Her parents are the owners of a furniture factory in the fictitious town of Ashmore, [[North Carolina]], where they have recently moved to from [[Chicago]]. Grace is from a wealthy Catholic family and lives with her mother, a socialite. Typically, they are depicted as more intelligent, thoughtful, funny, and rebellious than other children of their age. Set in 1965, the show was compared by some to another look-back-through-the-years show, ''[[The Wonder Years]]''.  [[Fred Savage]], the star of that hit ABC series, even appeared in the series' final episode.

The theme song is the original version of "[[Do You Believe In Magic (song)|Do You Believe in Magic]]" by [[The Lovin' Spoonful]]. The show was taped at [[Ren-Mar Studios]] stage 4.

"'''The Last Resort'''" is a song written by [[Don Henley]] and [[Glenn Frey]], which tells of how man inevitably destroys the places he finds beautiful.  It was originally released on the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles']] album ''[[Hotel California (Eagles album)|Hotel California]]'' on December 8, 1976.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|title=Hotel California|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/hotel-california-r6479|author=Ruhlmann, W.|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was subsequently released as the B-side of "[[Life in the Fast Lane]]" single on May 3, 1977.

In a 1978 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Henley said: "'The Last Resort', on ''Hotel California'', is still one of my favorite songs... That's because I care more about the environment than about writing songs about drugs or love affairs or excesses of any kind. The gist of the song was that when we find something good, we destroy it by our presence&amp;nbsp;— by the very fact that man is the only animal on earth that is capable of destroying his environment. The environment is the reason I got into politics: to try to do something about what I saw as the complete destruction of most of the resources that we have left. We have mortgaged our future for gain and greed." &lt;ref&gt; Andy Greene. "Readers Poll: The Ten Best Eagles Songs." ''Rolling Stone'', July 29, 2015. [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/readers-poll-the-10-best-eagles-songs-20150729/the-last-resort-20150729] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
On an episode of ''[[In the Studio with Redbeard]]'' (which devoted an entire episode to the making of ''Hotel California''), Frey stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;I have to give all the credit for 'The Last Resort' to (Don) Henley. It was the first time that Don, on his own, took it upon himself to write an epic story. We were very much at that time, concerned about the environment and doing anti-nuclear benefit (concerts). It seemed the perfect way to wrap up all of the different topics we had explored on the ''Hotel California'' album. Don found himself as a lyricist with that song, kind of outdid himself...We're constantly screwing up paradise and that was the point of the song and that at some point there is going to be no more new frontiers. I mean we're putting junk, er, garbage into space now. There's enough crap floating around the planet that we can't even use so it just seems to be our way. It's unfortunate but that is sort of what happens.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Frey referred to the song as "Henley's opus."&lt;ref name=rs&gt;{{cite book|title=Eagles: The Ultimate Guide|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|page=93|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Henley recalled that he had been reading about "the [[American Indian Wars|raping and pillaging of the West]] by mining, timber, oil and cattle interests" at the time he wrote the song.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;  He said that he wanted to expand the song's scope even further, and so he "tried to go '[[James A. Michener|Michener]]' with it," but was never totally satisfied with how it came out.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

==Recording==
The band recorded "The Last Resort" at the [[Criteria Studios]] in [[Miami|Miami, Florida]]. However, [[Black Sabbath]] were also recording ''[[Technical Ecstasy]]'' in an adjacent studio and played very loudly. The Eagles had to re-record the song a number of times due to the noise coming through the wall from the next studio.&lt;ref name="rollingstone"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-eagles-hotel-california-10-things-you-didnt-know-w454250 |title=The Eagles' 'Hotel California': 10 Things You Didn't Know |first=Jordan |last=Runtagh|date=December 8, 2016 |work=Rolling Stone }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
Music critic [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]] considers it an update of [[Joni Mitchell]]'s "[[Big Yellow Taxi]]" but says that it is "even more weary and despairing."&lt;ref name=thompson&gt;{{cite book|title=1000 Songs That Rock Your World|author=[[Dave Thompson (author)|Thompson, D.]]|page=163|year=2011|publisher=Krause|isbn=9781440214226}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thompson regards the line "Some rich men came and raped the land. Nobody caught ‘em" to be a critique of a [[free market economy]].&lt;ref name=thompson/&gt;  Critic William Ruhlmann said of it that it "sketches a broad, pessimistic history of America that borders on nihilism."&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt;  Author James Perone says that it ties "all the previous songs [from ''Hotel California''] together in this final reflection of the dark side of California Life."&lt;ref name=perone/&gt;   He notes, for example, how the song lyrics contrast the beauty of the California desert with ugly suburban houses and ultimately progresses to criticize the concept of [[manifest destiny]], on which American expansion to California was partially based.&lt;ref name=perone/&gt;  He regards the key lyric to be the line "They called it paradise; I don't know why," noting the emphasis given to it by the resignation of Henley's voice and by the falling [[melody]].&lt;ref name=perone/&gt;  Perone does criticize the use of synthesizer on the song instead of actual [[string instrument]]s, which he feels sounds artificial.&lt;ref name=perone&gt;{{cite book|title=The Album: A Guide to Pop Music's Most Provocative, Influential, and Important Creations, Volume 2|author=Perone, J.|page=92|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn= 9780313379062}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To Eagles' biographer Marc Eliot, "The Last Resort" tells "the story of a nation's self-destruction and physical decay told as [[metaphor]] for personal creative burnout."&lt;ref name=eliot&gt;{{cite book|title=To the Limit: The Untold Story of the Eagles|author=Eliot, M.|page=150|year=2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn= 9780306813986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2016, the editors of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' rated "The Last Resort" as the Eagles #27 greatest song.&lt;ref name=rs/&gt;

'''''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''''' ({{lang-de|Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus}}) is a book written by [[Max Weber]], a German [[sociologist]], economist, and politician. Begun as a series of essays, the original German text was composed in 1904 and 1905, and was translated into English for the first time by American sociologist [[Talcott Parsons]] in 1930.&lt;ref name="WeberBaehr2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Max Weber|author2=Peter R. Baehr|author3=Gordon C. Wells|title=The Protestant ethic and the "spirit" of capitalism and other writings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4MmligHndssC|accessdate=21 August 2011|year=2002|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-043921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered a founding text in [[economic sociology]] and [[sociology]] in general.

In the book, Weber wrote that capitalism in [[Northern Europe]] evolved when the [[Protestant]] (particularly [[Calvinism|Calvinist]]) ethic influenced large numbers of people to engage in work in the secular world, developing their own [[Organization|enterprise]]s and engaging in trade and the accumulation of wealth for investment. In other words, the [[Protestant work ethic]] was an important force behind the unplanned and uncoordinated emergence of modern [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKinnon | first1 = AM | year = 2010 | title = Elective affinities of the Protestant ethic: Weber and the chemistry of capitalism | url = http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/3035/1/McKinnon_Elective_Affinities_final_non_format.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Sociological Theory | volume = 28 | issue = 1| pages = 108–126 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-9558.2009.01367.x| hdl = 2164/3035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, apart from Calvinists, Weber also discusses [[Lutherans]] (especially [[Pietists]], but also notes differences between traditional Lutherans and Calvinists), [[Methodists]], [[Baptists]], [[Quakers]], and [[Moravians]] (specifically referring to the [[Herrnhut]]-based community under [[Count von Zinzendorf]]'s spiritual lead).

In 1998, the [[International Sociological Association]] listed this work as the fourth most important sociological book of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="isa-sociology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/books-of-the-xx-century/|title=ISA - International Sociological Association: Books of the Century|publisher=International Sociological Association|year=1998 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the 8th most cited book in the social sciences published before 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green|first1=Elliott|title=What are the most-cited publications in the social sciences (according to Google Scholar)?|url=http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/05/12/what-are-the-most-cited-publications-in-the-social-sciences-according-to-google-scholar/|website=LSE Imact Blog|publisher=[[London School of Economics]]|date=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

===Basic concepts===
Although not a detailed study of Protestantism but rather an introduction to Weber's later studies of interaction between various religious ideas and economics (''[[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism]],'' ''[[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism]],'' and ''[[Ancient Judaism (book)|Ancient Judaism]]),'' ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism'' argues that [[Puritan]] [[ethic]]s and [[idea]]s influenced the development of capitalism. The 'spirit of capitalism' does not refer to the spirit in the metaphysical sense but rather a set of values, the spirit of hard work and progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |author=Michael Shea |url=http://discoversociety.org/2015/10/06/the-protestant-ethic-and-the-language-of-austerity/ |title=The Protestant Ethic and the Language of Austerity |date=6 October 2015 |publisher=[[Discover Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious devotion, Weber argues, is usually accompanied by a rejection of worldly affairs, including the pursuit of wealth and possessions. To illustrate his theory, Weber quotes the ethical writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]]:

{{quote|sign=|source=|Remember, that ''time is money''.  He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or sits idle, one half of that day, though he spends but sixpence during his diversion or idleness, ought not to reckon ''that'' the only expense; he has really spent, or rather thrown away, five shillings besides. [...] Remember, that money is the ''prolific, generating nature''. Money can beget money, and its offspring can beget more, and so on. Five shillings turned is six, turned again is seven and threepence, and so on, till it becomes a hundred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces every turning, so that the profits rise quicker and quicker. He that kills a breeding feline taint, destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation. He that murders a crown, destroys all that it might have produced, even scores of pounds.}}

Weber notes that this is not a philosophy of mere greed, but a statement laden with moral language. Indeed, Franklin claims that God revealed the usefulness of virtue to him.&lt;ref name="protestant"&gt;Weber, Max "The Protestant Ethic and The Spirit of Capitalism" (Penguin Books, 2002) translated by Peter Baehr and Gordon C. Wells&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9–12}}

The Reformation profoundly affected the view of work, dignifying even the most mundane professions as adding to the common good and thus blessed by God, as much as any "sacred" calling (German: ''Ruf''). A common illustration is that of a cobbler, hunched over his work, who devotes his entire effort to the praise of God.

To emphasize the [[work ethic]] in Protestantism relative to Catholics, he notes a common problem that industrialists face when employing precapitalist laborers: Agricultural entrepreneurs will try to encourage time spent harvesting by offering a higher wage, with the expectation that laborers will see time spent working as more valuable and so engage it longer. However, in precapitalist societies this often results in laborers spending ''less'' time harvesting. Laborers judge that they can earn the same, while spending less time working and having more leisure. He also notes that societies having more Protestants are those that have a more developed capitalist economy.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|15–16}}

It is particularly advantageous in technical occupations for workers to be extremely devoted to their craft.  To view the craft as an end in itself, or as a "calling" would serve this need well. This attitude is well-noted in certain classes which have endured religious education, especially of a [[Pietist]] background.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|17}}

He defines spirit of capitalism as the ideas and ''esprit'' that favour the [[Rationalization (sociology)|rational]] pursuit of [[Wealth|economic gain]]: "We shall nevertheless provisionally use the expression 'spirit of capitalism' for that attitude which, ''in the pursuit of a calling [berufsmäßig]'', strives systematically for profit for its own sake in the manner exemplified by Benjamin Franklin."&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

Weber points out that such a [[spirit]] is not limited to [[Western culture]] if one considers it as the attitude of [[Person|individual]]s, but that such individuals – heroic entrepreneurs, as he calls them – could not by themselves establish a new economic order (capitalism).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"&gt;Reinhard Bendix, ''Max Weber: an intellectual portrait'',  University of California Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54–55}} He further noted that the spirit of capitalism could be divorced from religion, and that those passionate capitalists of his era were either passionate against the Church or at least indifferent to it.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|23}} Desire for profit with minimum effort and seeing work as a burden to be avoided, and doing no more than what was enough for modest life, were common attitudes.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|55}} As he wrote in his essays:

:{{quote|In order that a manner of life well adapted to the peculiarities of the capitalism… could come to dominate others, it had to originate somewhere, and not in isolated individuals alone, but as a way of life common to the whole groups of man.}}

After defining the "spirit of capitalism," Weber argues that there are many reasons to find its origins in the religious ideas of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. Many others like [[William Petty]], [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[John Keats]] have noted the [[Affinity (sociology)|affinity]] between Protestantism and the development of [[commercialism]].&lt;ref name="Bendix54"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bendix |title=Max Weber |url=|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber shows that certain branches of Protestantism had supported worldly activities dedicated to economic gain, seeing them as endowed with moral and spiritual significance. This recognition was not a goal in itself; rather they were a byproduct of other doctrines of faith that encouraged planning, hard work and self-denial in the pursuit of worldly riches.&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|57}}

===Origins of the Protestant work ethic===

Weber traced the origins of the Protestant ethic to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], though he acknowledged some respect for secular everyday labor as early as the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|28}} The Roman Catholic Church assured salvation to individuals who accepted the church's sacraments and submitted to the clerical authority. However, the Reformation had effectively removed such assurances. From a [[psychological]] viewpoint, the average person had difficulty adjusting to this new worldview, and only the most devout believers or "religious geniuses" within Protestantism, such as [[Martin Luther]], were able to make this adjustment, according to Weber.

In the absence of such assurances from religious authority, Weber argued that Protestants began to look for other "signs" that they were saved. Calvin and his followers taught a doctrine of [[Predestination|double predestination]], in which from the beginning God chose some people for salvation and others for damnation. The inability to influence one's own salvation presented a very difficult problem for Calvin's followers. It became an absolute duty to believe that one was chosen for salvation, and to dispel any doubt about that: lack of self-confidence was evidence of insufficient faith and a sign of damnation. So, self-confidence took the place of priestly assurance of God's grace.

Worldly success became one measure of that self-confidence. Luther made an early endorsement of Europe's emerging divisions. Weber identifies the applicability of Luther's conclusions, noting that a "vocation" from God was no longer limited to the clergy or church, but applied to any occupation or trade. Weber had always detested Lutheranism for the servility it inspired toward the bureaucratic state. When he discussed it in the ''Protestant Ethic'', he used Lutheranism as the chief example of the ''[[unio mystica]]'' that contrasted sharply with the ascetic posture. Later he would associate "Luther, the symbolic exponent of [[bureaucratic despotism]], with the ascetic hostility to [[Eros]] — an example of Weber's sporadic tendency to link together bureaucratic and ascetic modes of life and to oppose both from mystical and aristocratic perspectives."&lt;ref name="Mitzman1970"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arthur Mitzman|title=The Iron Cage: An Historical Interpretation of Max Weber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mayilngcerQC&amp;pg=PA218|accessdate=15 September 2013|year=1970|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-3745-3|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Weber saw the fulfillment of the Protestant ethic not in [[Lutheranism]], which was too concerned with the reception of divine spirit in the soul, but in [[Calvinism|Calvinistic]] forms of Christianity.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|32–33}} The trend was carried further still in Pietism.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|90}} The [[Baptists]] diluted the concept of the calling relative to Calvinists, but other aspects made its congregants fertile soil for the development of capitalism—namely, a lack of paralyzing ascetism, the refusal to accept state office and thereby develop ''un''politically, and the doctrine of control by conscience which caused rigorous honesty.&lt;ref name="protestant" /&gt;{{rp|102–104}}

What Weber argued, in simple terms:
* According to the new Protestant religions, an individual was religiously compelled to follow a secular vocation (German: ''Beruf'') with as much zeal as possible. A person living according to this world view was more likely to accumulate money.
* The new religions (in particular, Calvinism and other more austere Protestant sects) effectively forbade wastefully ''using'' hard earned money and identified the purchase of luxuries as a [[sin]]. Donations to an individual's church or congregation were limited due to the rejection by certain Protestant sects of [[icon]]s. Finally, donation of money to the poor or to [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] was generally frowned on as it was seen as furthering beggary. This social condition was perceived as laziness, burdening their fellow man, and an affront to God; by not working, one failed to glorify God.

The manner in which this paradox was resolved, Weber argued, was the investment of this money, which gave an extreme boost to [[Primitive accumulation|nascent capitalism]].

===The Protestant work ethic in Weber's time===

By the time Weber wrote his essay, he believed that the religious underpinnings of the Protestant ethic had largely gone from society. He cited the writings of [[Benjamin Franklin]], which emphasized frugality, hard work and thrift, but were mostly free of spiritual content. Weber also attributed the success of mass production partly to the Protestant ethic. Only after expensive luxuries were disdained could individuals accept the uniform products, such as clothes and furniture, that industrialization offered.

In his remarkably prescient conclusion to the book, Weber lamented that the loss of religious underpinning to capitalism's spirit has led to a kind of involuntary servitude to mechanized industry.

{{quote|The Puritan wanted to work in calling; we are forced to do so.  For when asceticism was carried out of monastic cells into everyday life, and began to dominate worldly morality, it did its part in building the tremendous cosmos of the modern economic order.  This order is now bound to the technical and economic conditions of machine production which today determine the lives of all the individuals who are born into this mechanism, not only those directly concerned with economic acquisition, with irresistible force.  Perhaps it will so determine them until the last ton of fossilized coal is burnt. In Baxter’s view the care for external goods should only lie on the shoulders of the 'saint like a light cloak, which can be thrown aside at any moment.' But fate decreed that the cloak should become an iron cage. (Page 181, 1953 Scribner's edition.)}}

Weber maintained that while Puritan religious ideas had significantly impacted the development of economic system in Europe and United States, there were other factors in play, as well. They included a closer relationship between mathematics and [[observation]], the enhanced value of scholarship, rational systematization of government administration, and an increase in entrepreneurship ventures. In the end, the study of Protestant ethic, according to Weber, investigated a part of the detachment from [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], that ''disenchantment of the world'' that could be seen as a unique characteristic of [[Western culture]].&lt;ref name="Bendix77" /&gt;{{rp|60}}

===Conclusions===

In the final endnotes Weber states that he abandoned research into Protestantism because his colleague [[Ernst Troeltsch]], a professional [[theology|theologian]], had begun work on ''The Social Teachings of the Christian Churches and Sects''. Another reason for Weber's decision was that Troeltsch's work already achieved what he desired in that area, which is laying groundwork for comparative analysis of religion and society. Weber moved beyond Protestantism with his research but would continue research into [[sociology of religion]] within his later works (the study of [[Ancient Judaism (book)|Judaism]] and the religions of [[The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism|China]] and [[The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Budhism|India]]).&lt;ref name="Bendix77"/&gt;{{rp|49}}

This book is also Weber's first brush with the concept of [[rationalization (sociology)|rationalization]]. His idea of modern capitalism as growing out of the religious pursuit of wealth meant a change to a rational means of existence, wealth. That is to say, at some point the Calvinist rationale informing the "spirit" of capitalism became unreliant on the underlying religious movement behind it, leaving only rational capitalism. In essence then, Weber's "Spirit of Capitalism" is effectively and more broadly a Spirit of Rationalization.

==Reception==
The essay can also be interpreted as one of Weber's criticisms of [[Karl Marx]] and his theories. While Marx's [[historical materialism]] held that all human institutions – including religion – were based on economic foundations, many have seen ''The Protestant Ethic'' as turning this theory on its head by implying that a religious movement fostered capitalism, not the other way around.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

Other scholars have taken a more nuanced view of Weber's argument. Weber states in the closing of this essay, "it is, of course, not my aim to substitute for a one-sided materialistic an equally one-sided spiritualistic causal interpretation of culture and history. Each is equally possible, but each if it does not serve as the preparation, but as the conclusion of an investigation, accomplishes equally little in the interest of historical truth." Weber's argument can be understood as an attempt to deepen the understanding of the cultural origins of capitalism, which does not exclude the historical materialist origins described by Marx: modern capitalism emerged from an elective affinity of 'material; and 'ideal' factors.&lt;ref name="aura.abdn.ac.uk"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Economic criticism===
The economist and historian [[Henryk Grossman]] criticises Weber's analysis on two fronts, firstly with reference to [[Karl Marx|Marx]]'s extensive work which showed that the stringent legal measures taken against poverty and vagabondage was a reaction to the massive population shifts caused by the [[enclosure]] of the [[commons]] in England.  And, secondly, in Grossman's own work showing how this "bloody legislation" against those who had been put off their land was effected across Europe and especially in France.  For Grossman this legislation, the outlawing of [[idleness]] and the [[poorhouses]] they instituted physically forced people from [[serfdom]] into [[wage-labor]].  For him, this general fact was not related to Protestantism and so capitalism came largely by force and not by any vocational training regarding an inner-worldliness of Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman, Henryk (2006) ‘The Beginnings of Capitalism and the New Mass Morality’ Journal of Classical Sociology 6 (2): July&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is possible that the Protestant "work ethic" reinforced or legitimized these legal measures within a larger cultural context.

In a paper published on 10 November 2009, Harvard economist Davide Cantoni tested Weber's Protestant hypothesis using population and economic growth in second-millennium Germany as the data set, with negative results. Cantoni writes:

{{quote|Using population figures in a dataset comprising 276 cities in the years 1300–1900, I find no effects of Protestantism on economic growth. The finding is robust to the inclusion of a variety of controls, and does not appear to depend on data selection or small sample size. In addition, Protestantism has no effect when interacted with other likely determinants of economic development. I also analyze the endogeneity of religious choice; instrumental variables estimates of the effects of Protestantism are similar to the OLS results.&lt;ref&gt;David Cantoni, "The Economic Effects of the Protestant Reformation: Testing the Weber Hypothesis in the German Lands," November 2009, {{cite web |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205143318/http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~cantoni/papers.html |archivedate=5 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, Cantoni uses city size, and not relative real wage growth, which was the Weber thesis, as his "main dependent variable" (Cantoni, 2).

Other recent scholarship continues to find valid Protestant Ethic effects both in historical and contemporary development patterns.

Dudley and Blum write:
{{quote|Evidence of falling wages in Catholic cities and rising wages in Protestant cities between 1500 and 1750, during the spread of literacy in the vernacular, is inconsistent with most theoretical models of economic growth. In The Protestant Ethic, Weber suggested an alternative explanation based on culture. Here, a theoretical model confirms that a small change in the subjective cost of cooperating with strangers can generate a profound transformation in trading networks. In explaining urban growth in early-modern Europe, specifications compatible with human-capital versions of the neoclassical model and endogenous-growth theory are rejected in favor of a "small-world" formulation based on the Weber thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030807123042/http://www.sceco.umontreal.ca/publications/etext/2001-05.pdf |archivedate=2003-08-07  |title=Religion and Economic Growth: Was Weber Right? |first1=Ulrich |last1=Blum |first2=Leonard |last2=Dudley |date=February 2001 |journal=Journal of Evolutionary Economics |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=207–230}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Revisionist criticism===
H. M. Robertson, in his book ''Aspects of Economic Individualism'', argued against the historical and religious claims of Weber. Robertson points out that capitalism began to flourish not in Britain, but in 14th century Italy, a decidedly different epoch. Since this is true, then the rise of capitalism cannot be attributed to [[Adam Smith]], the Protestant Reformation, etc. In fact, Robertson goes further, and states that what happened in Britain was rather a retrogression from what was achieved in Italy centuries earlier.

Looking at the history of the development of economic thought, Robertson shows that Adam Smith and [[David Ricardo]] did not found economic science ''de novo''. In fact, liberal economic theory was developed by French and Italian Catholics, who were influenced by the [[Scholastics]]. The British economic thought was rather a step backwards since it espoused the [[Labor Theory of Value]], which had already been proved incorrect by the [[School of Salamanca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313191910/http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard56.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-13 |title=Catholicism, Protestantism, and Capitalism |first=Murray N. |last=Rothbard |author-link=Murray Rothbard |publisher=Ludwig von Mises Institute |date=February 1957 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticism===
It has recently been suggested that Protestantism has indeed influenced positively the capitalist development of respective social systems not so much through the "Protestant ethics" but rather through the promotion of literacy.&lt;ref name="urss.ru"&gt;[[Korotayev]] A., Malkov A., Khaltourina D. (2006), ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics'', Moscow: URSS, {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}} [http://urss.ru/cgi-bin/db.pl?cp=&amp;lang=en&amp;blang=en&amp;list=14&amp;page=Book&amp;id=34250] ([http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=187&amp;Itemid=70 Chapter 6: Reconsidering Weber: Literacy and "the Spirit of Capitalism"]). P.87-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Becker and Wossmann at the University of Munich,&lt;ref name="epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de"&gt;Becker, Sascha O. and Wossmann, Ludger. "Was Weber Wrong? A Human Capital Theory of Protestant Economics History." Munich Discussion Paper No. 2007-7, 22 January 2007. http://epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de/1366/1/weberLMU.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Andrey Korotayev]] and [[Daria Khaltourina]] at the Russian Academy of Sciences,&lt;ref name="urss.ru"/&gt; showed that literacy levels differing in religious areas can sufficiently explain the economic gaps cited by Weber. The results were supported even under a concentric diffusion model of Protestantism using distance from Wittenberg as a model.&lt;ref name="epub.ub.uni-muenchen.de"/&gt;

==Support==

In 1958, American sociologist [[Gerhard Lenski]] conducted an empirical inquiry into "religion's impact on politics, economics, and family life" in the [[Detroit]], Mich., area. It revealed, among other insights, that there were significant differences between Catholics on the one hand and (white) Protestants and Jews on the other hand with respect to economics and the sciences. Lenski's data supported basic hypotheses of Weber's work ''The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism''. According to Lenski, "the contribution of Protestantism to material progress have been largely unintended by-products of certain distinctive Protestant traits. This was a central point in Weber's theory." Lenski noted that more than a hundred years prior to Weber, [[John Wesley]], one of the founders of the [[Methodism|Methodist]] church, had observed that "diligence and frugality" made Methodists wealthy. "In an early era, Protestant asceticism and dedication to work, as noted both by Wesley and Weber, seem to have been important patterns of action contributing to economic progress. Both facilitated the accumulation of capital, so critically important to the economic growth and development of nations."&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Lenski (1963), ''The Religious Factor: A Sociological Study of Religion's Impact on Politics, Economics. and Family Life'', Revised Edition, Garden City, N.Y., pp. 350-352&lt;/ref&gt;

German theologian Friedrich Wilhelm Graf notes: "Sociologists of religion like [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[David Martin (sociologist)|David Martin]] have interpreted the Protestant revolution in [[Latin America]] as implicit support of basic elements of Weber's thesis. [...] At any rate, many pious persons there interpret their transition from the Roman Catholic church to Protestant [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] congregations in terms of a moral idea that promises long-term economic gains through strong innerworldly asceticism. The strict ascetic self-discipline that has been successfully institutionalized in the Pentecostal congregations, the readiness to work more and with greater effort and to take less leisurely attitudes lead many Pentecostal Christians to believe that their new faith in God is supported by their economic successes."&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich Wilhelm Graf (2010), ''Der Protestantismus. Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Second, Revised Edition, Munich (Germany), pp. 116-117&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tree of Peace Society''' was founded in 1984 and incorporated in [[New York State]] on October 17, 1994, as a "foreign" not-for-profit corporation ("foreign" a legal formality owing to [[Tribal sovereignty in the United States|tribal sovereignty]] considerations).&lt;ref&gt;[http://appext9.dos.state.ny.us/corp_public/CORPSEARCH.ENTITY_INFORMATION?p_nameid=1920724&amp;p_corpid=1860110&amp;p_entity_name=tree%20of%20peace%20society&amp;p_name_type=A&amp;p_search_type=BEGINS&amp;p_srch_results_page=0 New York Department of State data: "Current Entity Name: TREE OF PEACE SOCIETY, INC. - Initial DOS Filing Date: OCTOBER 17, 1994 - County: FRANKLIN - Jurisdiction:DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA - Entity Type:FOREIGN NOT-FOR-PROFIT CORPORATION...]&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are located on the [[Akwesasne]] [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk]] reservation in [[Hogansburg, New York]], which borders the provinces of [[Quebec]] and [[Ontario, Canada]] along the [[St. Lawrence River]].

Since 1984, society members, headed by founder "Chief Jake Swamp" have ceremoniously planted trees in significant public places, such as near [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Constitution Hall]] in 1986&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kahonwes.com/iroquois/document1.html ''The Great Law of Peace: New World Roots of American Democracy'', by David Yarrow, September, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; and on April 10, 1986, at Shasta Hall, [[California State University]], [[Sacramento, California]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://peace.maripo.com/y_1986.htm "TREE OF PEACE.

'''Youngsan University of Seonstudies''' is a private religious university located in [[Yeonggwang County]], [[South Jeolla]] province, [[South Korea]].  It offers graduate and undergraduate training in [[Won Buddhism]] and related matters.

==History==
The predecessor of the university was founded on April 1, 1927, as Youngsan [[Hagwon]] (영산학원/靈山學院), a private academy for training [[Won Buddhism|Won Buddhist]] clergy.  It closed down for three years at the end of [[World War II]], from 1944 to 1947, and again during the [[Korean War]] from 1950 to 1952.  It closed down once again in 1957, to be reopened as a religious school recognized by the government in 1964.  1964 is thus recognized by some as the date of the school's actual founding.   The school became a college in 1986, and a university in 1997.
