'''''5 Men and a Limo''''' is a 1997 American short film produced by Aspect Ratio as an introduction sketch for the 26th Annual ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' [[Key Art Awards]].  In the film voiceover actor [[Don LaFontaine]] picks up four other voiceover actors in his limo to travel to the awards.  The actors talk about themselves and the awards, making humorous references to common phrases and techniques they use when voicing movie trailers.  Besides LaFontaine, the other actors appearing in the film are John Leader, [[Nick Tate]], [[Mark Elliot (voice-over artist)|Mark Elliot]], and Al Chalk. [[Hal Douglas]] provides his voice for a telephone call, but does not appear.

The limousine in the film is LaFontaine's. The driver is [[Clinton Hendricks]], LaFontaine's personal sound engineer and driver.&lt;ref name="GoldenVoice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fadeinmag.com/kaye/feature.htm |title="The Man With The Golden Voice" |accessdate=2007-07-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030202022609/http://www.fadeinmag.com/kaye/feature.htm |archivedate=2003-02-02 |df= }}, ''Fade In'' magazine; published February 2003; retrieved July 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film's original purpose was to serve as an introductory sketch for the 1997 ''The Hollywood Reporter'' Key Art Awards broadcast. According to John Leader, the sketch played to a packed house at the awards ceremony and was so well received that the next day, bootlegged copies began circulating around the Internet;&lt;ref name="LeaderBio"&gt;[http://www.johnleader.com/biography.html Biography of John Leader] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928095915/http://www.johnleader.com/biography.html |date=2007-09-28 }}; retrieved July 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; to date, one copy of the film has nearly one million views on YouTube alone.&lt;ref name="5 Men and a Limo on YouTube"&gt;{{YouTube|JQRtuxdfQHw|"5 Guys in a Limo"}}; retrieved April 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the five voiceover artists, many of whom had few on-camera credits to their names prior to ''5 Men and a Limo'', had become instantly recognizable; LaFontaine went on to do on-screen appearances in commercials for [[GEICO]] as "that announcer guy from the movies", while Leader has done on-screen commercials for [[Burger King]] and Kudos granola bars.&lt;ref name="LeaderCommercials"&gt;[http://www.johnleader.com/resources/Commercials.mp3 Excerpts from John Leader's commercial voiceovers] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928095921/http://www.johnleader.com/resources/Commercials.mp3 |date=2007-09-28 }}; retrieved July 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The short film opens with the "[[James Bond Theme]]," before transitioning into the theme from ''[[Back to the Future]]'' after the show's opening graphics.  When Hal Douglas is heard phoning LaFontaine, the familiar intro to the "[[Theme from New York, New York]]" is heard on the music track as a subtle indication of Douglas' East Coast management. This is abruptly interrupted by a sample from the 1985 electronica song "[[Oh Yeah (Yello song)|Oh Yeah]]" by Swiss band [[Yello (band)|Yello]], once LaFontaine ignores Douglas and introduces Al Chalk. An excerpt from the score of ''[[Groundhog Day (film)|Groundhog Day]]'' is heard when Mark Elliot enters the film. Otherwise the score from ''[[Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story]]'' is heard in the background during many of the voiceovers provided by the limousine's passengers.

[[Image:BBC2 logo 1979.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The electronic 2 ident]]
The '''Computer Generated 2''' was an ident used by [[BBC Two]] between June 1979&lt;ref&gt;A recording exists of this ident in use on 23 June 1979, and of its predecessor in use on 9 June 1979.  No recordings between the two dates have so far appeared.&lt;/ref&gt; and 30 March 1986. It was the first computer generated television station identification in the world.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Launch==
The ident package was launched in June 1979. The ident was aired through a solid-state computer device, not unlike the one used later for [[BBC One|BBC1]]'s [[Computer Originated World]], built by BBC engineers, and designed by Oliver Elmes. The concept of the double striped '2' had been around for a long time: following the two television channels dropping corporate branding, a similar look was adopted by both channels featuring double striped numbers and BBC letters. The doubled striped '2' had been in use on programme promotions since 1977 and on holding slides since 1978.

==Components of the look==
The ident itself featured a cream, double striped numeral 2, with two orange lines either side going off screen. The whole ident had the illusion of three dimensions, with orange shadows, all on a black background. The ident would either remain static, scroll in from the left hand side or scroll out to the right. The form up ident was accompanied by an electronic fanfare, which was dropped in 1983. A subtitled programme would be accompanied by the additional caption below the numeral stating '[[Ceefax]] 270' and later following a change of page 'Ceefax 888'.

The clock which accompanied this new look was located in the BBC Two [[Noddy_(camera)|Noddy]] room and comprised an orange clock face with counters of ever increasing thickness and with a 'polo' mint centre upon a black background. A plain orange and white 2D striped '2' logo was placed below the clock. The use of this old clock was due to the fact that the technology did not exist for an electronic timepiece, and would not until 1980, when an electronic timepiece was finally obtained for BBC2. This new electronic clock had no second hand judder and had a changed design, featuring two dashes at the quarter hours and single dashes elsewhere. The polo mint centre was abandoned in favour of a simple centre dot, and the 3D striped '2' logo adorned the bottom of the screen, although it was unanimated.

Promotional style wasn't uniform, but generally featured the striped '2' in the promotion in one form or another, whether at the beginning or appearing on the end slide. Programme slides featured a large white 2 with programme title overlaid the bottom of the image.

A variation of the look was used during the [[BBC Schools#Daytime on 2|Daytime on 2]] strand showing schools programmes, which featured the ident with an orange gradient background. Regional variations of BBC2 featured the region name below the 2.

The variation in 2010 is this look recreated using 3D software.

==Special Idents==
Some special versions were produced for public celebrations such as [[Christmas]]:

*'''Christmas 1979''' - A revolving perspex snowflake rotates over a white version of the logo at the bottom of the screen.
*'''Christmas 1980''' - Similar to the previous year, a more colourful perspex snowflake rotating above a Christmas BBC2 caption
*'''Christmas 1981''' - Three red translucent candles spinning around with the caption Christmas 2
*'''Christmas 1982''' - Three green perspex Christmas trees with a hand-drawn, angular BBC2 caption.
*'''Christmas 1983''' - Another similar theme to the previous year. Three metallic Christmas trees spinning against the Christmas 2 caption.
*'''Christmas 1984''' - A pink bauble with the '2' on it remains stationary while a stylised ribbon spelling 'Christmas' rotating around it.
*'''Christmas 1985''' - A blue tinted Christmas scene rotates around the '2'.

==Special uses==
The ident was re-used in early 2005 for the opening continuity announcement in the second series of the period comedy ''[[Look Around You]]''.

It was recreated in May 2010, with a new soundtrack, as part of BBC Two's "80's Season", to celebrate events and features from the decade.

It was then brought back twice in October 2012, with no soundtrack. The first occasion was only shown in Northern Ireland on 10 October at 12:20am, to mark the start of their digital switchover, hence bringing BBC Two NI's time on analogue television to a close. The second was shown nationally on 22 October at 4:35am to lead into the final edition of ''[[Ceefax|Pages From Ceefax]]''. And on 7 October 2013, this (and its Christmas '79, '84 &amp; '85 ident in NI), along with others was brought back for BBC Two's "Afternoon Classics" block.

== Characters ==
{{in-universe|section|date=July 2015}}
'''Jay Marsh''' plays '''Theo Barrett''', a marketer for a multimedia company. He is what many would call the epitome of what a Brother With No Game is. Bubbly, animated and a self-confessed geek, he is seen as the proverbial good gentleman of the group, and as a result can’t seem to find a woman that he is compatible with. Theo has a confusing relationship with school friend Simone, with fans vocally unsure whether there is more to them than just friends. Humble, likeable yet with a hint of naivety he provides a necessary balance to the four main friends.

'''Zephryn Taitte''' portrays '''Dorian Kerr''' an accountant who works with Theo at the same multimedia company. Intelligent and well-read he assumes the role of life analyst and often uses his interest in psychology and conspiracy theories to theorise on just about everything. His love for Arsenal rivals his hate for work, especially his boss Michael who he shares awkward competitive scenes with. Dorian dates a number of women despite being picky, yet his heart lies with childhood friend Lisa, who he subsequently fails to make his girlfriend for most of the series.

'''[[David Avery]]''' plays '''Marcus Graham''', a men’s fashion magazine intern turned content editor. Charismatic, Confident and Cocky with self-proclaimed good looks, he is the charmer of the friends. He likes his women to compliment his attempted lifestyle and often goes for the fashionable, high maintenance and trophy types. His necessity to lie about who he is to get women almost always backfires on him in the long run with his conquests in the series ranging from crazy to young.

'''Isaac Sosanya''' plays '''Junior Casey Owusu''', a freelance IT Consultant. He is funny, social but collected, making him both the quietest and joker of the group. Junior’s confidence is dealt a blow at the start of the series, as we find him still reeling off the break-up of his childhood sweetheart Vanessa. He subsequently dates Remy and builds a relationship with her until Vanessa comes back into his life. Junior spends the series contending with his choices and the effects they have on his life and those around him life.

'''Natalie Duvall''' plays '''Lisa Bowman''', a teacher and part-times events organiser. She is often referred to as the mother hen, as she loves to bring all her friends together to cook for them. She is a hopeless romantic, always trying to hook up the guys and longs for a relationship of her own. During the series Lisa drops clues for Dorian that she wants to be with him, but it has yet to materialise. She subsequently goes on to date Leon in the series.

'''Dani Moseley''' plays '''Simone Charles''', a heralded youth worker in her community. Alongside Lisa she is a childhood friends of the guys. Feisty and not one to mince her words she is often seen as aggressive and snobbish of men, however as the series progresses we see she is merely guarding herself from being hurt again after breaking up with another old school friend, Darren.

'''Ashley Bannerman''' plays '''Remy Ademola''', a relationship blogger and author. Remy is introduced to the series as a feisty speed-date, heavily critical and analytical on the guys she comes across. She wins a date with Junior and a relationship blossoms. She is focused, witty and personable and brings a whole new dimension to Junior.

'''Nemide May''' plays '''Vanessa Leanne''', writer and actress. She joins the series at the Season 1 finale, coming back into Junior’s life after an untimely break-up. She is meticulous, intelligent and very sweet but has a menacing side when she doesn’t get what she wants. She spends the series trying to win Junior back, after realising he may not be as over as her as he claims.

'''Solomon Israel''' plays '''Darren Dickson''', an old school friend of the guys. He is confident, a jokester and spontaneous, often wanting to go out on wild nights and trips. He is introduced to the series as Simone’s ex-boyfriend and we soon learn about his uncommitted dynamic with women. He represents the guy Marcus wants to be.  The source of Darren’s regular income is unknown and despite his womanising ways, he takes great pride in having fun and making people happy.

== Season Synopsis ==

=== Season 1 ===
The first season introduces the four main characters and three supporting characters. Theo is finding it hard to find the right woman, with his workmate Nicole taking advantage of his good nature and Simone making fun of his masculinity. He finds solace in Charlotte, a singer who he meets at a cashpoint and a relationship blossoms. Marcus begins dating Nia off of the back of a lie about his job role yet refuses to confess his commitment to her to his friends. A strange turn of events reveal that he’s not the only one lying in their rendezvous. Dorian is struggling with work, women and his feelings towards Lisa. He attempts and fails throughout the season to tell Lisa how he really feels until there is a threat to her singledom, when a man enters the fray. Junior spends most of the season unable to get over his ex-girlfriend Vanessa until he meets Remy at a speed dating event. A relationship blossoms between them but his ex-girlfriend shows up and gives him an ultimatum.

=== Season 2 ===
The second season begins with Junior making a decision between Remy and Vanessa. After telling Vanessa he chooses Remy, Vanessa presents him with an offer he can’t refuse. We spend the season wondering what happened between them until the finale when Vanessa confesses to Remy exactly what that something was. Marcus breaks up with Nia and finally gets a full-time role for his company. He befriends Michelle, a co-worker he eventually has feelings for but is thwarted by the return of Darren, who visits him and gets the attention of Michelle. Marcus goes to a club with Dorian and Darren and meets Sinitta, a sexy and voluptuous teacher who is potentially more of a threat to Marcus than a conquest. Theo flies to Jamaica for a family wedding after being given the boot by Charlotte, he delays his return to London after finding himself a suitable girlfriend finally. He returns to London for the season finale with his girlfriend Monique, but she may be having second thoughts on whether she wants to come back home for good. Dorian and Lisa reluctantly agree to be friends and he begins dating Shirene but it comes to an abrupt halt when they have an impromptu double date with Lisa and her new boyfriend Leon. Dorian befriends a new girl at Marcus’ surprise birthday party and they begin dating, but when Leon proposes to Lisa unexpectedly in the series finale, Dorian’s feelings come to the forefront.

=== Season 3 ===
According to the production company BWNG Ltd website, Season 3 picks up where Season 2 left off, with Junior, Dorian and Theo having to answer tough questions about their current life situations…and fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://brotherswithnogame.com/bwng-season-3/|title=BWNG Season 3|date=2017-05-01|website=Brothers With No Game|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joined by good old friend Darren, the season explores the challenges of being “actual adults” – since the past decade, has been filled with mediocrity and lack of commitment. The show is scheduled to be broadcast on [[Trace Urban|TRACE Play]], in the summer of 2017.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

== Impact ==

=== Critical reception ===
Elizabeth Pears of [[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice Newspaper]] celebrated the positive imagery of young males by describing the show as "a voice that reflected a generation of young black men in their 20s – who weren’t locked in a cycle of gang rivalries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'More than gangsters'|url = http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/more-gangsters|website = www.voice-online.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the show was featured on US cable show 'The Attack Show' by [[Baratunde Thurston]], with positive feedback from the panel consisting of Senior Writer of [[Entertainment Weekly]] Anthony Breznican and Editor In Chief of Birth.Movies.Death Devin Faraci. Devin Faraci commented that the show was 'actually good (I'd say it's the only ''good'' thing recommended in the segment).'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Semen And Race Jokes On Live TV: Devin Does ATTACK OF THE SHOW|url = http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2012/08/02/semen-and-race-jokes-on-live-tv-devin-does-attack-of-the-show|website = Birth.Movies.Death.|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Breznican goes on to respond ‘I think its great, but also it is very British. It’s not just about black culture, but it's also about being a young British guy…”

As the series progressed, Brothers With No Game received National press coverage in [[The Guardian newspaper|The Guardian]], with the writer asking the question of why the show was not on UK television, despite its success online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why black British drama is going online, not on TV|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/02/black-british-tv-drama-online|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-05-30|first = Bim|last = Adewunmi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the main cast of Brothers With No Game were featured on [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|BBC Radio 1xtra]] with [[Nick Bright]], where each actor speed dated with guest host Sian Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Brothers With No Game speed date Sian Anderson, ‘Brothers With No Game’ join Nick Bright for Breakfast Club, Nick Bright - BBC Radio 1Xtra|url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01z2f0v|website = BBC|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, an academic research on screen comedy audiences featured a chapter on the shows and its audiencen in the context of 'the marginalisation of blackness on British television'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/news/2620/traditional_sitcom_research/|title=Research suggests viewers want more traditional sitcoms|last=|first=|date=2017-05-31|website=British Comedy Guide|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Screen Comedy and Online Audiences'', by Dr Inger-Lise Kalviknes Bore, also looks at how online distribution is providing alternative spaces for the development of black-centred narratives.

=== Awards ===
The Brothers With No Game received positive feedback from the industry whilst on YouTube, going on to win 6 awards at the LA Web Festival in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hit UK web series wins six awards at LA Web Festival|url = http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/hit-uk-web-series-wins-six-awards-la-web-festival|website = www.voice-online.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show went on to win more accolades, most notably winning Best Ensemble and Best Actor award for Zephryn Taitte, at the 2014 Screen Nation Digital-iS media award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Zephryn Taitte, star of ‘Brothers With No Game’|url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/5415303a-da35-11e3-920f-00144feabdc0.html|newspaper = Financial Times|date = May 16, 2014&lt;!-- 1:28 pm--&gt;|access-date = 2015-05-30|issn = 0307-1766|first = Isabel|last = Berwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acclaimed [[film director]]s included: [[Emir Kusturica]], [[Dušan Makavejev]], [[Goran Marković (film director)|Goran Marković]], [[Lordan Zafranović]], [[Goran Paskaljević]], [[Živojin Pavlović]] and [[Hajrudin Krvavac]]. Many Yugoslav films featured eminent foreign actors such as [[Orson Welles]] and [[Yul Brynner]] in the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Academy Award]] nominated ''[[Battle of Neretva (film)|The Battle of Neretva]]'', and [[Richard Burton]] in ''[[The Battle of Sutjeska (film)|Sutjeska]]''.

[[Partisan film]] is a subgenre of [[war film]]s, made in Yugoslavia during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. In the broadest sense, main characteristics of partisan films are that they are set in Yugoslavia during [[World War II]] and have [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisans]] as main protagonists, while antagonists are [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces and their collaborators. Outside Yugoslavia, Partisan films were especially popular in China.

The [[Yugoslav Film Archive]] was a founding member of the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] and was the national film library of the [[former Yugoslavia]], founded in 1949 in Belgrade.

[[File:Bharatanatyam 111.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Bharatanatyam]]

'''Classical Indian musical theatre''' is a sacred art of the [[Hindu]] temple culture. It is performed in different styles.

==Overview==
Classical Indian musical theatre theory can be traced back to the [[Natya Shastra]] of [[Bharata Muni]] (400 BC).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The [[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] currently confers classical status on eight styles:

#[[Bharatanatyam]]
#[[Odissi]]
#[[Kuchipudi]]
#[[Kathak]]
#[[Mohiniaattam]]
#[[Kathakali]]
#[[Manipuri dance|Manipuri]]
#[[Sattriya dance|Sattriya]]

Classical Indian musical theatre at its best is [[Bharata Natyam|Natya Yoga]], has the most powerful means to lead its worshipers, the artist, to the Divine.  It is a sincere depiction of the Divine.  It is a sincere depiction of the realities in life, an embodiment of the imagination and gracefulness, the very soul which thereby creates as it were the “Idol of the Beautiful”.

While [[Bharatanatyam]], [[Odissi]] and [[Kuchipudi]] are the orthodox styles that claim to preserve the knowledge of the [[Natya Shastra]] most faithfully, [[Kathak]] is different from other styles as it is a mixture of the [[Persian dance]] and the Indian folk dance movements. It derives its name from the community of Kathaks, who are custodians of the art.  It is from this house (ghar) or family that this form has taken its origin.  The words Kathak and Kathakali are derived from katha meaning storytelling and kali meaning play. The Kathak dance style was founded by the master Maharaj Binda Din.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Kathak dancing performed by a dancer who stands and moves about and lasya (the aspect) in which the dancer kneels or remains immobile the whole  time  except for the (gat) a descriptive passage, performed in a gentle rhythm and tells stories with his expressive powers only, with his face and hands.

On the physical side the dancer must have perfect control of his body and limbs, which is achieved at least 12 years of study.  Special massage is given to the feet.  The Kathakali technique of using the face expression is a pure marvel of accomplishment.  Some ancient masters of this dance have such control of their facial muscles that they can laugh with one side and cry with the other.  Every Kathakali must be master of both tandava (vigorous masculine style at changing from one style to another).  Lasya is divided into two categories; one suitable for men (for presenting love scenes, displays of sympathy and sentimed and so on) and the other for women who take female roles.  Therefore, women may study Kathakali but do not take part in the pure dance drama which is too vigorous and difficult for them.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Indian dancing is not just physical movements of hands and legs, it is a form of physical art with body and mind for both men and women alike as well as a form of worship to the Almighty Divine Gods.

An important feature of Indian classical dances is the use of Mudras or hand gestures. Mudras are used by the artists to express their feeling or even the whole story.

==Later Indian musical theatre==
Ancient [[Sanskrit drama]] had a highly stylized nature with an emphasis on spectacle, where [[Classical Indian music|music]], [[Classical Indian dance|dance]] and gesture combined "to create a vibrant artistic unit with dance and mime being central to the dramatic experience." Sanskrit dramas were known as ''[[Natya Shastra|natya]]'', derived from the root word ''nrit'' (dance), characterizing them as spectacular dance-dramas.

Traditional folk theatre became popular from around the 10th century with the decline of Sanskrit theatre. These regional traditions include the ''[[Yatra]]'' of [[Bengal]], the ''[[Ramlila]]'' of [[Uttar Pradesh]], and the ''[[Terukkuttu]]'' of [[Tamil Nadu]]. In particular, [[Parsi theatre]] "blended [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[fantasy]], music and dance, narrative and spectacle, earthy dialogue and ingenuity of stage presentation, integrating them into a dramatic discourse of [[melodrama]]. The Parsi plays contained crude humour, melodious songs and music, sensationalism and dazzling stagecraft." These traditions in musical theatre have continued in modern [[Cinema of India|Indian cinema]], particularly in [[musical film]]s produced by [[Bollywood]].&lt;ref name="Gokulsing" /&gt;

In modern days, Kathakali is also learned and performed by women.

==Influence on Indian musical films==

'''Comedy''' has a long and rich tradition in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and its people have long been associated with humor in various forms. The humor is usually directed towards the different ethnic groups in the former [[Yugoslavia]], and there are many racial slurs, but they are usually taken lightly.

==Examples==
During the 1980s and 1990s there was a series of popular comedy shows, most notably ''Audicija'', and ''[[Top Lista Nadrealista]]''. The shows, translated as ''Auditions'' and ''Top List of Surrealists'' featured early performances by many well known Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian actors and musicians. Both shows were re-incarnated to various degrees during the 1990s and onwards, with new casts and material.

Most "settings" would have a representative (if the sketch was racially orientated) from Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia, and Hercegovina. This combination would cause calamity and comedy would begin creating itself.

The popular protagonists of many jokes in Bosnia are Mujo, Suljo and Fata (sometimes Mujo, Haso and Fata). Mujo and Haso have recently been brought to life, in a series of sketches based on some of the more popular jokes, widely available online and in video and DVD formats.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22944">{{Main|Theatre of France}}
The '''French theatre of the late 18th century''' functioned as a forum for political expression and debate; during this period, society and art became highly politicised. The French took great national pride in their theatres. A report commissioned by the [[Commune of Paris]] in 1789 declared Paris to be a centre for the "foremost theatres of Europe"  that served as an "exemplar for foreigners."&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 18).&lt;/ref&gt; An audience's response to the play was important to its success—if a play was received poorly (''claques''), rather than favourably (''cabales''), the play would not receive royalty payments.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1996, 37).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre of the ''Ancien Régime''==
Before the creation of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in 1789, the monarchy supported only three theatres in Paris: the Académie Royale de Musique ([[Paris Opera]]), the [[Opéra-Comique|Comédie-Italienne]], and the [[Comédie-Française]].&lt;ref&gt;McClellan (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Royal patronage resulted in a monopoly over the theatre and safeguarded the monarch from mockery and criticism. It was not until the late 1780s that this system was criticised for preventing the success and freedom enjoyed by theatres elsewhere.

The government of the ''[[Ancien Régime in France|Ancien Régime]]'' attempted to silence a growing political unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to rid society of the disruption caused by "''honnêtes hommes''," the lieutenant-general of police, [[Marc-Pierre de Voyer de Paulmy d'Argenson]], tried to control the behaviour of spectators in theatres.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999, 135).&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a temporary lull in politicised drama. Nearly all of the top fifty plays of the decade had nothing to do with the Revolution and were uncritical and silent about the revolutionary ideals of liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1996, 87).&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Chapelier Law of 1791 ==
With the introduction of the [[Chapelier Law]] in 1791, the National Assembly instituted the freedom of theatres, which could now function without governmental interference or censorship.&lt;ref&gt;McClellan (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; A dramatic increase in the number of theatres followed, from fourteen in Paris in 1791 to thirty-five in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1996, 45).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the law, the censor now expressed not the absolute will of the monarch but the more negotiable, democratic preferences of the nation.

==The ''parterre''==
The physical space of a theatre in France during the Enlightenment allowed a large number of people to attend. With capacities of up to two thousand audience members, the theatre was an important arena for the French community. During this time, nearly fifty new theatres opened, over one thousand plays were written, and approximately twenty-four plays were performed on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 15).&lt;/ref&gt; Giving the working class access to the theatre meant opening it to their demands. Ravel calls the pit the "parterre", where the working class could participate in the performance by voicing their reactions in an unmediated, sometimes aggressive way, thus anticipating in some form the coming Revolution. This group embodied the revolutionary spirit for direct democracy and subsequently became an important political actor, confounding the hierarchies of royal authority.&lt;ref&gt;Ravel (1999, 90-100).&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Pieces de circonstances''==
[[File:PaiselloVigeeLeBrun.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Paisello Vigee Le Brun]]
A Parisian citizen during the Enlightenment may have attended the theatre principally for two reasons: firstly, its aesthetic value as an awe-inspiring spectacle and secondly, because of its political suggestiveness. When drama lacked this latter aspect, it was criticised for distracting audiences from the pressing public political issues of the time. For example, a petition was sent to the National Assembly regarding [[Paisiello]]'s flashy opera ''[[Nina (opera)|Nina, osia la pazza d’amore]]'', because it lacked political and educational meaning.&lt;ref&gt;McClellan (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the opera's closure in 1792 and the National Assembly banned theatre that did not incorporate the events of the Revolution.

French theatre became full of "''pieces de circonstance''," or "works of social circumstances," particularly where the events of the military were concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 16).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in December 1793, a member of the [[Committee for Public Safety]], [[Bertrand Barère]], demanded that playwrights create work about the French capture of [[Toulon]]. Seven new plays were subsequently written about the battle, including ''La prise de Toulon'', which made direct references to political leaders and philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;McClellan (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aubin-Louis Millin de Grandmaison]] claimed that "[[tragedy]] should teach great political truths and public virtues. If they want to express a powerful idea, tragic authors are therefore obliged to torment their genius, to cloak their idea with a veil of allegory" &lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 20).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Allan Ramsay 003.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Jean Jacques Rousseau]]
While French theatre was praised for its ability to engage in the political debates of its time, it was also criticised by members of the aristocracy for corrupting the public sphere. A notable proponent of this notion was [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]], who, in his ''[[Letter to M. D'Alembert on Spectacles]]'', argued that theatre could not improve the morality of the audience and instead could only re-inforce their existing beliefs. He was enraged by [[Molière]]'s ''[[Le Misanthrope]]'' for the way it praised the hypocritical character [[Philinte]] at the expense of [[Alcest]], the honest character in the play.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and the theatre==
The worlds of politics and drama converged, since some leading playwrights of this period were also politicians. For example, tragedian [[Marie-Joseph Chenier]] belonged to the Paris [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] and was elected to the [[National Convention]]; [[Collot d'Herbois]] wrote both comedies and tragedies, while being an active member of the Committee for Public Safety; and interior minister [[François de Neufchâteau]] was also a popular playwright of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 15).&lt;/ref&gt;

Theatrics also played a large role in politics, in terms of the way political speeches and campaigns were carried out. Politicians of the time, such as the Marquis de Mirabeau, used the public's ability to be captivated by the theatre to arouse support for their regimes. In fact, in a production called ''Assemblée fédérative'', citizens were allowed to pay to role-play as great speakers of the Enlightenment, re-enacting debates and speeches of propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Friedland (2002, 184).&lt;/ref&gt; Inevitably, this situation resulted in a mockery of politics, and performances where actors played the parts of politicians were often controversial.

Along with the theatricality of politics, the role of drama in French society is reflected in the theatrical portrayal of the visions and beliefs of the National Convention regarding [[surveillance]]. The content of Revolutionary plays also reflected the beliefs of Jean Jacques Rousseau and the [[Age of Enlightenment]].  As described by Rousseau, surveillance provides the means through which the authenticity and goodness of the person can be constituted, recognized and affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 125).&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas regarding surveillance resonated with Revolutionary culture, as there was a general push for complete visibility.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 127).&lt;/ref&gt; The power of surveillance was thought to be shared by all citizens and was considered by many to be the single most important means to protect the Revolution from [[counter-revolutionary]] citizens and would-be usurpers.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 129).&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with ''L’Époux républicain'', plays such as ''Plus de bâtards en France'', and ''La Veuve du républicain, ou, Le Calomniateur'' all reflected the Convention’s belief that surveillance in the private sphere was extremely important to the transparency of the Revolution. The Convention believed that citizens needed to police themselves and their peers, and then had a duty to report counterrevolutionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 423).&lt;/ref&gt; This was all encouraged in order to continue the safety and well-being of the Republic.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 423).&lt;/ref&gt;  Robespierre was particularly consumed with both the elimination of theatricality from the government and the elimination of the distance between the representatives and the people that they represented.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 132).&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the aforementioned plays were encouraged and accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 429).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
''L'Époux républicain'' was one play in particular that was enormously popular and very effective at portraying the importance of the acceptance of surveillance. The main character’s wife, Mélisse, has an affair and is also revealed to be counter-revolutionary, showing the link between immoral activity and [[treason]].&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 427).&lt;/ref&gt; There were also characters within these plays that questioned whether or not surveillance was ethical or warranted.  However, the characters that endorsed this surveillance were the ones that the plays portrayed as the moral, just, and ultimately correct citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 249).&lt;/ref&gt; Revolutionary drama depicted domestic life as inherently connected to political life, which in turn linked the practice of surveillance to the protection of the Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 184).&lt;/ref&gt; Theater was considered a machine for [[propaganda]] to further the beliefs and ideals of the Revolution and its leaders.&lt;ref&gt;McCready (2001, 26).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, there were plays that provided a critique of surveillance, such as ''La Chaste Suzanne'', a play which actually caused riots because of supposed counter-revolutionary messages.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 421).&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Chaste Suzanne'' cast an unfavorable light on two elected officials engaged in the surveillance of the main character, Suzanne, during a private moment in a bath. The officials attempt to extort sexual favors from Suzanne and when she refuses, they denounce her and allege that she was having an affair with a young man. Suzanne is brought to trial for adultery and is almost stoned to death before a sympathetic lawyer comes to her rescue and reveals the nefarious plot. This play represented a rejection of the ideas of surveillance encouraged by the government and society (embodied by the spying officials invading Suzanne’s privacy), and was thus seen as counter-revolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 432).&lt;/ref&gt; The play was staged in a very momentous time in Revolutionary history - King Louis XVI had recently been tried and executed and the lines separating the Jacobin and [[Girondin]] values began to widen and cause animosity.

Due to the atmosphere of the [[Reign of Terror|Terror]], and the subject matter of the play, riots began to break out condemning the performance.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 188-189).&lt;/ref&gt; Even one of the actors in the play wrote a letter detailing citizens’ disgruntled reactions in the crowd upon hearing certain lines of the play they believed associated the play’s heroine, Suzanne, with [[Marie Antoinette]].&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1966, 149).&lt;/ref&gt; Patriots showed their discontent with the counter-revolutionary ideas in the play by storming the stage with drawn swords and threatening to turn the theatre into a hospital if they play continued.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1966, 149).&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention voted to ban ''La Chaste Suzanne'' after complaints that it disrupted the public order and was morally corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1966, 149).&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after it was banned, on September 27, 1793, [[Pierre-Yves Barré]], one of those responsible for the staging the performance and several actors and writers including the Radet and [[Desfontaines-Lavallée]], were arrested for staging plays filled with "perfidious allusions".&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1966, 150).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israel (2014, 518).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addressing the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] in early 1791, the aforementioned Mirabeau declared that "when the time comes for us to concern ourselves with the education of the masses, in which the theatre must play its part, it will be seen that drama can be transformed into a very active, very rigorous morality." &lt;ref&gt;Marquis de Mirabeau as cited in: Hemmings, (1994, 92).&lt;/ref&gt;

As Mirabeau’s declaration suggests, the revolutionary governments used theatre to promote republican ideology and morality. According to F.W.J. Hemmings, in the plays produced in Paris between 1793 and 1794, over two-thirds conveyed a political message.&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings (1994, 97).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the question of what constituted a drama that espoused proper political messages and appropriate republican morals ultimately fell to the government. Consequently, in its efforts to utilize the theatre for political ends, the government became repressive, much in the same way that the monarchy had been.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1966, 145).&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the theatre was viewed as a tool of political advancement, plays that did not purify public morals or politically align with the central government became censored in some way. Plays were either outright banned, or altered to remove any references to the defunct institutions of the ''[[Ancien Régime in France|Ancien Régime]]'' and to better promote republican morals, as was often the case with familiar classics such as [[Molière]]’s ''Tartuffe''.&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings (1994, 95).&lt;/ref&gt;   Prior to August 1793, the central government enforced such censorship through repressive means. Because of the Chapelier Law of 1791, passed under the National Assembly, abolishing the censorship of theatre, the government had to justify its censorship through claims that a particular dramatic performance caused a public disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings (1994, 92-97).&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the case with the play ''L’Ami des Lois''. As the controversial trial of the King was taking place in early 1793, [[Jean-Louis Laya]] created the play ''L’Ami des Lois'' as an attack on the growing [[Jacobin]] extremism of the time and as an expression of his desire for renewed moderation and liberty with order. This challenged the authority of the revolutionary power structures that were becoming increasingly dominated by Jacobin radicals. In the play, these radical Jacobins are depicted as self-interested and calculating villains, while the former aristocrats are portrayed as patriotic.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1966, 143-144).&lt;/ref&gt; Complaints arose, and under the pretext that the play was causing public disturbance, the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]], predominantly controlled by Jacobins, banned it. This occurred on January 10, 1793, only eight days after its first production.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1966, 145).&lt;/ref&gt;  Playwright Laya protested what he considered an arbitrary censorship to his play. He criticized the new censorship undertaken by the revolutionary French government as more despotic than that of the institutions of the Ancien Régime.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1966, 144-146).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although a supporter of the early stages of the Revolution, Laya’s ''L’Ami des Lois'', and subsequent criticisms of the government, resulted in his official denunciation by [[Jean-Marie Collot d'Herbois]], a member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]]. To avoid punishment, Laya went into hiding and did not reappear until after the radical Reign of Terror had come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson (1966, 143;150).&lt;/ref&gt;

Censorship of the theatre only increased in the following months, paralleling the radicalization of the Revolution during the Reign of Terror. On August 2, 1793, the recently formed Committee of Public Safety passed a decree introducing penalties to theatres producing plays contrary to republican ideology by proclaiming that "every theatre in which plays are performed that tend to lower public morale and to revive the shameful superstition of monarchy shall be closed, and the directors arrested and punished in accordance with the full rigor of the law."&lt;ref&gt;Decree passed by the Committee of Public Safety as cited in: Hemmings (1994, 94).&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the following month, the Committee of Public Safety granted the Commune the task of preemptively previewing plays to ensure that they followed republican ideology and did not include any critiques of the current administration. This marked a shift from repressive censorship to that of preventive censorship, carried out in the name of the Republic. Even while undertaking preventive censorship measures, the [[National Convention]] continued to promote plays that aligned with its political and moral creed.&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings (1994, 92-100).&lt;/ref&gt;

The play ''Guillaume Tell'' by [[Antoine-Marin Lemierre]], which displayed popular themes of the struggle against tyranny, revolt, sacrifice and liberty, is an example of a play promoted by both the Convention and the Committee of Public Safety. Productions of ''Guillaume Tell'' were actually subsidized by the state, as it was one of several plays deemed by the government to best propagate revolutionary ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (1989, 282-285).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the precedent set by the earlier revolutionary governments, even the more moderate government that came to power during the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] continued to censor and support plays of its choosing.&lt;ref&gt;Hemmings (1994, 98-100).&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Fourth Wall in theatre and politics==
Paul Friedland suggests that actors in the time of the ''[[Ancien Régime in France|Ancien Régime]]'' were expected to experience the emotions that they were portrayed on-stage. In 1750, however, critics such as [[Denis Diderot]] and [[François Riccoboni]] argued that the emotions presented on-stage should be illusionary.&lt;ref&gt;Freidland (2002, 21).&lt;/ref&gt; Friedland argues that by the time of the creation of the National Assembly there was a metaphorical "[[fourth wall]]" that divided an awed audience from the actors who created illusions of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Freidland (2002, 28).&lt;/ref&gt; Friedland interprets this change as resulting from the emergence of revolutionary politics. He calls pre-revolutionary France a "''corpus mysticum,''" or a "mystical body," that was subject only to the will of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]], and [[clergy]].&lt;ref&gt;Freidland (2002, 30).&lt;/ref&gt; During the Revolution, he continues, power shifted to the ''parlementaires'', who began to operate behind a political "fourth wall", still removed from the actual interests of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Freidland (2002, 159).&lt;/ref&gt; Just as audiences in a theatre would suspend their disbelief for the spectacle of the show, so too did citizens begin to have blind faith in the National Assembly's representation of national will.

Friedland uses [[Marie-Joseph Chénier]]'s play ''Charles IX'', which expresses an anti-monarchical attitude, as an example of the controversy that the "fourth wall" created. When actors refused to participate in the play, the National Assembly and other political organizations intervened, defying the Chapelier law that outlawed government intervention in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Freidland (2002, 263).&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the theatre argued that the divide between spectators and performers not only reflected, but encouraged the separation between citizens and government. The remodelling of the [[Théâtre Feydeau]] in 1789, for example, removed audience boxes on-stage so that the audience was more confined to an area separate from the stage. This change, they argued, signified the lack of transparency of the ''[[Ancien Régime in France|Ancien Régime]]''. [[Maximilien Robespierre]] was an advocate for public vigilante surveillance over the government and so was against this counter-revolutionary form of theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, ix).&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Maslan, utilising the theories of [[Michel Foucault]], argues that the shift from the ''Ancien Régime'' to the post-revolutionary system signified a "shift from a regime of spectacle to a regime of [[surveillance]].".&lt;ref&gt;Maslan (2005, 126).&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gaffer''' in the [[motion picture industry]] and on a [[television crew]] is the head [[electrician]], responsible for the execution (and sometimes the design) of the [[lighting]] plan for a production. The term gaffer originally related to the moving of overhead equipment to control lighting levels using a [[wiktionary:gaff|gaff]].   The gaffer's assistant is the [[best boy]].&lt;ref name="Taub153"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gaffers, Grips, and Best Boys |last=Taub |first=Eric |year=1994 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-312-11276-9 |page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the gaffer is credited as [[Lighting technician|Chief Lighting Technician]] (CLT).

The term has been used for the chief electrician in films since the 1930s.  The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has a citation from 1936;&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] accessed 15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; a 1929 book on motion picture production also uses the term.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Eunice McCarthy, The Hands of Hollywood, 1929: 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gaffer is responsible for managing lighting, including associated resources such as labour, lighting instruments and electrical equipment under the direction of the [[Director of Photography]] (the DP or DOP) or, in television, the Lighting Director (LD).

The DP/LD is responsible for the overall lighting design, but delegates the implementation of the design to the gaffer and the [[key grip]]. The key grip is the head [[Grip (job)|grip]], in charge of the labour and non-electrical equipment used to support and modify the lighting. Grip equipment includes stands, [[Flag (lighting)|flags]] and [[Gobo (lighting)|gobos]]. The gaffer will usually have an assistant called a [[best boy]] and, depending on the size of the job, crew members who are called "set lighting technicians" or "[[lighting technician|electricians]]", although not all of them are trained as [[electrician]]s in the usual sense of the term.

Although  [[gaffer tape]] is used within the film/TV Industry as a strong cloth-backed adhesive tape, many other types of tape are also used, such as paper tape, [[pressure-sensitive tape]] (A.K.A. snot tape), [[electrical tape]], J-LAR, and cloth tape. Gaffer tape is typically utilized by set lighting technicians under the supervision of, and not directly by, a gaffer.

'''Icaro''' ({{lang-qu|'''ikaro'''}}) is a [[South America]]n [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[colloquialism]] for [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] or [[alchemy]], or any [[Esotericism|esoteric]] [[modalities (sociology)|modality]] by which a practitioner attempts to channel their [[energy]] to manifest their [[will (philosophy)|will]].&lt;ref name="Nicole"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42683849|title=Witch doctor's apprentice : hunting for medicinal plants in the Amazon|last=Nicole.|first=Maxwell,|date=1990-01-01|publisher=MJF Books|isbn=1567313035|oclc=42683849}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, this term is commonly used to describe the medicine songs performed in ''[[Vegetalismo|vegetal]]'' [[Ceremony|ceremonies]], especially by [[Shamanism|shamans]] in [[ayahuasca]] ceremonies to induce a profound state of [[healing]], [[awareness]] or [[amazement]].&lt;ref name="Ency2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HltJMMq1_60C&amp;pg=PA220&amp;lpg=PA220&amp;dq|title=Ency of Shamanism|last=Pratt|first=Christina|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group|year=2007|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vegetalismo (Stockholm Studies in Comparative Religion)|last=Luna|first=Luis Eduardo|publisher=Almqvist &amp; Wiksell Internat|year=1986|isbn=91-22-00819-5|authorlink=Luis Eduardo Luna}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jung2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VkYLhAKQMR8C&amp;pg=PA47&amp;lpg=PA47&amp;dq|title=Jung in the 21st Century: Synchronicity and science|last=Haule|first=John Ryan|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2011|pages=47–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also commonly used to describe a traditional [[artisan]]al [[pattern]] of the [[Shipibo-Conibo people|Shipibo]] tribe based on the [[vision (spirituality)|vision]]s induced by [[ayahuasca]].

== Etymology ==

The word ''icaro'' is believed to derive from the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] verb ''ikaray'', which means "to blow smoke in order to heal".&lt;ref name="Jung2" /&gt;

== In healing ceremonies ==

=== Medicine songs ===

[[File:Pwanchir Pitu, Shaman et chef spirituel du peuple Achuar.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pwanchir%20Pitu,%20Shaman%20et%20chef%20spirituel%20du%20peuple%20Achuar.jpg|alt=Shamans usually use icaros to heal with the power of music.|thumb|192x192px|Amazonian shaman.]]
Icaro is most commonly used to describe the [[medicine]] [[song]]s used by [[Shamanism|shamans]] in [[healing]] [[Ceremony|ceremonies]], such as with the [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] brew [[ayahuasca]]. Traditionally, these songs can be performed by [[whistling]], [[singing]] with the [[Human voice|voice]] or [[vocable]]s, or playing an [[Musical instrument|instrument]] such as the [[didgeridoo]] or [[flute]], and usually involve a mastery of advanced techniques to evoke the healing effects. 

Traditionally, icaros may come to a shaman during a ceremony, be passed down from previous lineages of healers, or come to a shaman during a 'dieta' where plant spirits are believed to teach icaros to the shaman directly. The singing or whistling of icaros is sometimes accompanied by a [[chakapa]], a rattle of bundled leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | isbn = 978-0-8263-4729-9
 | quote = some songs, such as calling in the spirit of ayahuasca at the start of a ceremony, are performed without rhythmic accompaniment, while healings are all performed with the shacapa. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the complexity of certain performance techniques, it may take many years to learn certain icaros, and experienced shamans may be able to recite hundreds of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencenotes.ucsc.edu/2011/pages/ayahuasca/ayahuasca.html|title=Meet Mother Ayahuasca|last=Rozendal|first=Keith|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other healing practices ===

The word ''icaro'' may be used for other ritual actions taken by a healer during a ceremony for the sake of affecting consciousness.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In ayahuasca ceremonies of [[Iquitos]], Peru, you may find any of the following are considered an icaro:
* Shaking a [[chakapa]] at a consistent tempo
* Shaking a [[chakapa]] in different corners of the room
* Blowing [[mapacho]] smoke
* Mouth-made sound effects of wind or fast-moving air
* Purging sounds and mannerisms
* Invitations of spirits or forces
* [[Hypnosis|Hypnotic]] speaking

'''''In Touch Weekly''''' is an American celebrity [[gossip magazine]].  The magazine is focused on [[celebrities|celebrity]] news, fashion, beauty, relationships and lifestyle, and is geared towards a younger readership, billing itself as "fast and fun", along with making claims about their lower cover price on their front cover to encourage buyers to purchase their magazine rather than the other titles on a supermarket checkout rack.It usually targets younger woman and teenage girls.

==History and profile==
The magazine was launched in 2002 by [[Bauer Media Group|Bauer Publishing]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Carr|title=A Down-Market Publisher Dresses Up|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/25/business/media/25mag.html?_r=0|accessdate=25 July 2015|work=The New York Times|date=25 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Spencer was editor from its launch until 2010. [[American Media, Inc.]] acquired Bauer's US celebrity magazines in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Bauer Media sells most of US portfolio – 17 titles down to just four| work = Mediaweek| accessdate = 2018-07-29| date = 2018-06-18| url = https://mediaweek.com.au/bauer-media-sells-us-portfolio-ami-2018/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine shares a publisher with its sister magazine ''[[Life &amp; Style Weekly]]'', a similar weekly gossip magazine. Whereas ''In Touch'' is focused more on celebrity gossip, ''Life &amp; Style'' bills itself on giving readers lifestyle tips on how to incorporate celebrity beauty and fashion into their lives.

On September 18, 2006, after the death of [[Daniel Wayne Smith]], son of [[Anna Nicole Smith]], [[Getty Images]] sold the last photos taken of Daniel alive at his mother's bedside to ''In Touch Weekly'' and ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' for a reported $650,000.

On May 21, 2015, the magazine controversially released a police investigation of [[Josh Duggar]] from the ''[[19 Kids and Counting]]'' reality TV show, from an investigation carried out in 2006, when Josh was 18 years of age, about events occurring in 2002, when Josh was 14 and still a minor, when he was accused of molesting his sisters and several other girls.  No charges were ever filed.  Although the magazine was criticized for releasing the report, the [[Springdale, Arkansas]] city attorney and several legal experts said that since Josh was 18 at the time of the investigation and all minors' names were redacted, the release was permitted under Arkansas' Freedom of Information Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-josh-duggar-record-destroyed-20150522-story.html|title=Judge orders Josh Duggar's record destroyed|work=Chicago Tribune|date=May 22, 2015|accessdate=June 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Release of Josh Duggar's Police Report Raises New Legal Questions|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2015/06/02/josh-duggars-police-report-release-raises-questions|accessdate=June 4, 2015|work=Fox News|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Henry|first1=Larry|title=Senator: Springdale Police Chief Should Be Fired Over Child Sex-Crime Report|url=http://5newsonline.com/2015/05/23/senator-springdale-police-chief-should-be-fired-over-child-sex-crime-report/|accessdate=June 4, 2015|publisher=5 News|date=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chasner|first1=Jessica|title=Bart Hester, Arkansas lawmaker, wants police chief fired over release of Josh Duggar report|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/may/26/bart-hester-arkansas-lawmaker-wants-police-chief-f/|accessdate=4 June 2015|publisher=The Washington Times|date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=City Of Springdale Responds To Josh Duggar Sexual Molestation Accusations|url=http://5newsonline.com/2015/06/04/city-of-springdale-responds-to-josh-duggar-sexual-molestation-accusations/|accessdate=June 5, 2015|work=5 News|date=June 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Helsel|first1=Phil|title=Josh Duggar Molestation Scandal: City Defends Release of Record|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/josh-duggar-scandal-city-defends-release-record-n370171|accessdate=5 June 2015|publisher=NBC News|date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/06/05/heres-why-releasing-josh-duggars-records-was-probably-not-illegal|title=Here’s why releasing Josh Duggar’s records was probably not illegal|last=Brittain|first=Amy|work=The Washington Post|date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the website, as of 2010, ''In Touch Weekly'' sells for $2.99 on newsstands, 50 cents less than competitors ''US Weekly'' and ''Star Magazine''.

'''''Insidious: Chapter 2''''' is a 2013 American [[supernatural horror film]] directed by [[James Wan]]. It is a [[sequel]] to ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]],'' the second installment in the [[Insidious (film series)|''Insidious'' franchise]], and the fourth in terms of the series' in-story chronology. The film stars [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]] and [[Rose Byrne]] reprising their roles as Josh and Renai Lambert, a husband and wife who seek to uncover the secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world.

The film was released September 13, 2013. A [[prequel]] film, ''[[Insidious: Chapter 3]]'', was released on June 5, 2015.

== Plot ==
In 1986, Lorraine Lambert summons [[demonology|demonologist]] Elise Rainier to help her son Josh, who is being followed by the spirit of an old woman.  After investigating the house and encountering [[paranormal|paranormal phenomena]], Elise tells Lorraine that they must suppress Josh's [[astral projection]] abilities for his own safety.

Twenty-five years later, Renai Lambert is under questioning about the [[Insidious (film)|death of Elise]].  She is warned that if her husband Josh's fingerprints are found at the crime scene, he will be prosecuted for Elise's murder.  The Lambert family relocate to Lorraine's house as the investigation continues.  Renai and the others begin to experience strange, seemingly paranormal activity in the house.

Specs and Tucker visit Elise's house and discover a videotape of the 1986 investigation.  Upon reviewing it, they find someone standing behind Josh in the video.  The next morning, Dalton tells Renai that he has been having bad dreams involving a woman in a white dress; as well as hearing Josh talk to an unseen figure in the hallway.  Renai receives a call from the police stating that the fingerprints do not match Josh.  The woman in the white dress appears and attacks Renai.  Josh hears a voice urging him to kill his family.

Lorraine visits Specs and Tucker and they show her the tape, enhanced to show an adult Josh as the figure standing behind the young Josh.  They contact Elise's former colleague Carl, who attempts to contact Elise's spirit.  They are told to find answers at an abandoned hospital where Lorraine used to work as a doctor.  Upon arriving, Lorraine recounts the story of a patient named Parker Crane who was admitted for trying to castrate himself.  Two days later, Lorraine saw Parker in an elevator.  When Lorraine asked a nurse why Parker was out of his bed, the nurse explained that he had [[suicide|jumped to his death from the roof]] the day before.

Lorraine and the group go to the Crane family home where they find a secret room.  Inside they discover numerous corpses, a black wedding gown and newspaper clippings revealing Parker to be a killer referred to as "The Bride in Black" - who kidnapped and murdered young women while dressed as a woman himself.  Josh's body begins to slowly deteriorate and Renai realizes he is possessed.  Lorraine insists that they all get away from Josh.  Carl arrives to drug him, accompanied by Specs and Tucker, but Josh manages to subdue all three. Carl awakes in the spirit realm of "The Further", where he meets the spirit of the real Josh. Josh travels to his daughter Cali's room in "The Further", where an evil spirit is approaching her.  He struggles with the spirit but is overpowered.  Elise's spirit arrives and banishes the spirit from the house.  It is revealed that these actions are what triggered some of the mysterious events in the first film, as time moves [[Chronology|non-chronologically]] in the Further.

In the real world, Josh, who is possessed by Parker,  ambushes Lorraine and Renai, locking Lorraine in a closet.  Renai and the children escape to the basement.  Dalton voluntarily enters The Further to help his father.  In The Further, Josh, Carl, and Elise try to track Parker down by revisiting Josh in 1986, with the young Josh showing the adult Josh where to find him.  In Parker's house, the three witness Parker's mother, Michelle – the woman in the white dress – abusing him for acting like a male; and forcing him to dress and act like a girl.  Parker had killed his female victims at the behest of his mother's spirit.  Upon finding Michelle, she and Josh fight. Elise saves Josh and appears to destroy Michelle's spirit, which stops the possessed Josh from murdering his family in the real world.  Parker's ghost disappears.  Carl and Josh escape, only to find Dalton, who leads them back to the living world, allowing Josh to finally regain control of his body.  The Lambert family is finally reunited, with Josh and Dalton allowing themselves to once again have their memories suppressed by Carl.

Some time later, Specs and Tucker arrive at the house of a family whose daughter, Allison, is in an unexplained coma.  Unbeknownst to them, Elise's spirit enters.  She hears a crackling sound and gasps as she sees something standing in the shadows.

{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|quote=It's a direct continuation from the end of the first film, so it's the same characters, same actors coming back. But where the first movie plays like a classic haunted house film, the second one plays more like a domestic thriller with supernatural elements to it.|source=—Wan, on the shift in genre&lt;ref name="LA" /&gt;}}

After the financial success of ''[[Insidious (film)|Insidious]]'' In April 2011, discussions for a sequel soon followed. With producer [[Jason Blum]] insisting on the return of director [[James Wan]] and screenwriter [[Leigh Whannell]], a treatment script did not arrive until nearly a year later. "As long as there was a chance that James and Leigh were gonna write the second movie and direct the second movie, I didn't want to do it with someone else," said Blum. "They kept saying they might do it, they might not do it, which was why there's quite a bit of time between the two movies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nemiroff|first=Perri|title='Insidious Chapter 2' Producer Talks Micro-Budget Horror &amp; 'Amityville: Lost Tapes'|url=http://screenrant.com/insidious-2-interview-jason-blum-amityville-lost-tapes/|publisher=Screen Rant|accessdate=September 11, 2013|date=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 2, 2012, it was announced that director [[James Wan]] and screenwriter [[Leigh Whannell]] were in talks to return for the sequel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Horror Hit 'Insidious' to Get Sequel|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/insidious-sequel-rose-byrne-james-wan-leigh-whannell-286790|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While promoting ''[[The Conjuring]]'' (2013) at [[New York Comic Con]] in October 2012, Wan described how he and Whannell were working closely on developing the story and the script for the follow up to ''Insidious'', explaining to [[ShockTilYouDrop.com]], "I think the sequel to ''Insidious'' is kind of my reaction to ''[[Saw (2004 film)|Saw]]'' where for my own reason I wasn't as involved in the sequels, and so I felt with ''Insidious'', think it would be good to shepherd it and keep it more in track to the version I had when I made the first film so that it doesn't detour too far."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Edward|title=NYCC Exclusive: James Wan &amp; Patrick Wilson on Insidious 2|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/170453-nycc-exclusive-james-wan-a-patrick-wilson-on-insidious-2|work=[[Crave Online]]|publisher=[[ShockTilYouDrop.com]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was titled ''Insidious: Chapter 2'' because it is a direct continuation of the first installment.&lt;ref name="SetVisit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Foutch|first=Haleigh|title=25 Things to Know about INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2 from Our Set Visit|url=http://collider.com/insidious-chapter-2-set-visit-recap/|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the tone of the film was to be more grounded than in the first film, with Wan citing his work on ''The Conjuring'' as an influence to how he and Whannell approached ''Insidious: Chapter 2''.&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Day|first=Patrick Kevin|title='Insidious: Chapter 2′ director James Wan on weird, surreal horror|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/insidious-chapter-2-director-james-wan-on-weird-surreal-horror/|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I pulled things from ''Insidious'' that I applied to ''The Conjuring'', and what I learned from ''The Conjuring'' I applied to ''Insidious 2''," said Wan. "So for me, I feel like it's a cumulative filmmaking experience that I've gathered over the years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foutch|first=Haleigh|title=James Wan Talks INSIDIOUS: CHAPTER 2, Why He Wanted to Make a Sequel, Taking a Break from Horror, FAST &amp; FURIOUS 7, &amp; the Genre He Wants to Try Next|url=http://collider.com/james-wan-insidious-chapter-2-fast-furious-7-interview/|publisher=Collider.com|accessdate=September 11, 2013|date=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Casting ===
On November 19, 2012, it was officially announced that [[Patrick Wilson (American actor)|Patrick Wilson]], [[Rose Byrne]], [[Lin Shaye]], and [[Ty Simpkins]] would reprise their roles from the first film.&lt;ref name="HR"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne Coming Back for 'Insidious' Sequel|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/insidious-sequel-patrick-wilson-rose-393161|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following month, it was announced that [[Barbara Hershey]] would also be returning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Patten|first=Dominic|title=Barbara Hershey Back For 'Insidious Chapter 2′|url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/12/barbara-hershey-back-for-insidious-chapter-2/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=December 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, [[Jocelin Donahue]] and Lindsay Seim rounded out the cast as younger versions of Hershey and Shaye's characters, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title=Donahue to 'Insidious' role|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/donahue-to-insidious-role-1118065596/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=February 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kroll|first=Justin|title=Lindsay Seim Enters 'Insidious 2′ Role|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/lindsay-seim-enters-insidious-2-role-821164/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=February 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also confirmed that the film's screenwriter [[Leigh Whannell]] and actor [[Angus Sampson]] would reprise their roles as Specs and Tucker, respectively. When asked about the return of the two characters, Whannell explained, "There was this hatred that spewed out from fans saying 'I hated those guys! They sucked! They ruined the movie!' so there will probably be a lot of people out there who will be disappointed to hear that the Specs and Tucker characters will be coming back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Writer/Actor Leigh Whannell Confirms Specs and Tucker Characters to Return for Insidious 2|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/52898/exclusive-writeractor-leigh-whannell-confirms-specs-and-tucker-characters-return-insidiou|publisher=Dead Central|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filming ===
[[Principal photography]] for ''Insidious: Chapter 2'' began on January 15, 2013, in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="HR" /&gt; Having a slightly higher production budget than its predecessor, the film was captured over the course of 25 shooting days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insidious Chapter 2 - Q&amp;A with Jason Blum, Leigh Whannell, Patrick Wilson, Lin Shaye, Barbara Hershey and James Wan|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/67172/insidious-chapter-2-qa-jason-blum-leigh-whannell-patrick-wilson-lin-shaye-barbara-hershey|publisher=Dead Central|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bulk of the film was shot at a house in [[Highland Park, Los Angeles]],&lt;ref name="SetVisit" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insidious: Chapter 2 Filming in Highland Park|url=http://highlandparkgringos.wordpress.com/2013/02/15/insidious-chapter-2-filming-in-highland-park/|work=The Gringos of Highland Park|accessdate=September 16, 2013|date=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as the location of Lorraine Lambert's house. Another location used for filming was the former [[Linda Vista Community Hospital]], which was redressed as a hospital setting and used for the construction of interior sets (including recreations of sets from the first film).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Further Hauntings|journal=[[Film Journal International]]|date=September 2013|volume=116|issue=9|page=12|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BD"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickson|first=Evan|title=[Special Report] Getting Answers And Escaping Ghosts On The Set Of 'Insidious Chapter 2′!!|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3235010/special-report-getting-answers-and-escaping-ghosts-on-the-set-of-insidious-chapter-2/|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=June 5, 2013|date=May 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I've never shot in Linda Vista," said Wan about the location. "It's kind of funny because Leigh and I have always heard so much about it. For research on the first one [Leigh] came here to do a bit of ghost-hunting. And I think a lot of that inspired us when we needed a hospital set."&lt;ref name="BD" /&gt;

=== Music ===
The [[Film score|musical score]] to ''Insidious: Chapter 2'' is composed by [[Joseph Bishara]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkan|first=Jonathan|title=James Wan Confirms Joseph Bishara Back As Composer For 'Insidious Chapter 2'|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3204160/james-wan-confirms-joseph-bishara-back-as-composer-for-insidious-chapter-2/|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=November 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; who previously collaborated with director [[James Wan]] on the first installment as well as ''The Conjuring''. "Finding the right range and tone for the feeling is an important part," described Bishara on generating tension through sound. "James is very particular with sting placement along with Kirk, our editor on both ''Insidious'' films and ''Conjuring''. Silence can create a listening space, where rather than give you something else to listen to it enables you to hear things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schweiger|first=Daniel|title=Interview with Joseph Bishara|url=http://www.filmmusicmag.com/?p=11755|publisher=Film Music Magazine|accessdate=September 11, 2013|date=September 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A soundtrack album for the film was released digitally on September 15 and in physical forms on October 8, 2013 by Void Recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Insidious: Chapter 2′ Soundtrack Details|url=http://filmmusicreporter.com/2013/09/04/insidious-chapter-2-soundtrack-details/|publisher=Film Music Reporter|accessdate=September 5, 2013|date=September 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional songs featured in the film include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013) – Song Credits|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/movie/insidious-chapter-2/|publisher=[[Soundtrack.net]]|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Critical response ===
Review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] sampled 111 reviews and judged 39% of the reviews to be positive. The site's consensus reads: "''Insidious: Chapter 2'' is decidedly short on the tension and surprises that made its predecessor so chilling."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insidious: Chapter 2 (2013)|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/insidious_chapter_2/|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 40 out of 100 based on 30 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Insidious: Chapter 2|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/insidious-chapter-2|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robbie Collin]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' gave the film a positive review, stating that "the scares are mostly very scary indeed, and that means the film does its job."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Collin|first=Robbie|title=Insidious: Chapter 2, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/filmreviews/10304051/Insidious-Chapter-2-review.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=September 12, 2013|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott Foundas of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' praised the "artfully eerie" cinematography work of [[John R. Leonetti]] and the "pervasively unsettling atmosphere" constructed by sound designer and editor Joe Dzuban. Foundas further wrote that "where so many sequels seem like mere remakes of their predecessors, with bigger budgets and less imagination, ''Insidious: Chapter 2'' feels like a genuine continuation of characters we enjoyed getting to know the first time around, and wouldn't at all mind returning to again."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott Foundas |url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/film-review-insidious-chapter-2-1200607706/ |title='Insidious: Chapter 2′ Review: James Wan's Pleasurable Sequel |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2013-09-12 |accessdate=2015-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Robert Abele of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' commented, "After the pleasurable free fall into old-fashioned nightmare artistry that was last summer's ''The Conjuring'', this busy-yet-dull sequel feels like Wan robotically flexing his manipulation of fright-film signposts, an exercise more silly than sinister."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Abele|first=Robert|title=Review: 'Insidious: Chapter 2' adds nothing to the story|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-insidious-2-review,0,4147571.story?|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=September 12, 2013|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Lowe of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' wrote, "Setting aside the movie's tediously lame dialogue, self-conscious performances and frequently predictable scares, the narrative's compulsively shifting chronology intermittently manages to engage, although it does little to obscure the distracting shortcomings of both plot and character development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowe|first=Justin|title=Insidious: Chapter 2: Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/insidious-chapter-2/review/628279|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=September 12, 2013|date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Irina Nikolajewna Bugrimova was born in [[Kharkiv]], [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Ukraine]]) on March 13, 1910.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The daughter of a [[veterinarian]] and a [[ballet dancer]], she excelled in athletics as a child, including as a champion [[speed skater]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; She eventually parlayed her talent into a career as a [[motorcyclist]] and gymnast at circuses, among other things.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

She died in [[Moscow]].

==Animal training==
In 1929, Bugrimova transferred to the [[Moscow State Circus]], and it was there she met the animal trainers Nikolaj Gladilstchikow and Boris Eder, who taught her the practice.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; She made her debut ten years later in 1939, and designed many of her own tricks, such as lions [[tightrope walking]], acts involving motorcycles, and a giant swing which she would leap from with a cat. In one stunt, a lion would run in front of her motorcycle as if in fear, while another would jump onto the back of her seat to ride along. She flirted with danger by swinging on a giant swing with a lion. At the end of the routine the two jumped off the swing together and she fed the animal a piece of meat with her teeth. Her act ended with the lions laying down as she cavorted on a carpet of cats. Later she worked with the Circus Humberto in [[Czechoslovakia]] and the [[East German]] Circus.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; 

Bugrimova performed in circuses well into her 60s,&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"/&gt; and was decorated several times by the Soviet state.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Today there is also an avenue named in her honor in her hometown of Kharkiv, in front of the city's circus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://maps.google.com/maps/place?q=Kharkiv,+Kharkivs'ka,+Ukraine+circus&amp;hl=en&amp;cid=12706666251370739799 |title=ХАРЬКОВСКИЙ ГОСУДАРСТВЕННЫЙ ЦИРК |work=[[Google Maps]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Kavita "Vita" Rao''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[geneticist]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Dr. Kavita Rao first appeared and featured prominently in the first story arc of the monthly series ''[[Astonishing X-Men]]'' Vol. 3 #1 in 2004 and was created by [[Joss Whedon]] and [[John Cassaday]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Hope===
Dr. Kavita Rao is a world-renowned geneticist from [[India]] who developed a serum (later called "Hope") which could "cure" [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]], turning them into normal humans. She explains that she regards the mutant gene as a 'corruption' of healthy tissue, and justifies her research by looking at mutants who committed suicide or hurt others because of their powers, such as a female mutant with a butterfly-like appearance or [[Tildie Soames]] (a child whose nightmares can manifest into monsters).{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Hundreds of mutants immediately signed up for the procedure at Benetech (the corporate backer of her research). The X-Men debated the merits of the cure and the significance of labelling the mutant condition a disease.  The chance at shedding his "beastly" appearance and avoiding any further secondary mutations held significant appeal for Hank McCoy (aka [[Beast (comics)|Beast]]) and he considered taking the serum for a time, although [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] objected by saying that an X-Man taking the serum would be the equivalent of admitting that there was something to 'cure' in the first place.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

It was later revealed that Rao had been working for the alien [[Ord (comics)|Ord]] of the Breakworld, who also had in his custody [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]] (who was, at that time, thought to be dead, but had been resurrected by Ord's technology). The X-Men defeated Ord and Benetech, and Ord was delivered into the hands of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Dr. Rao's work was destroyed by Wolverine, leaving Hank with the last sample of "Hope", although he remains uncertain whether or not he will use it at some point.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

=== Endangered Species ===
Kavita Rao was pictured alongside several super-villains to whom Beast offers to 'sell his soul' for a means to un-do the effects of [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]]. With her old research into 'curing' the mutant gene now irrelevant after so many mutants lost their powers, she agrees to aid Beast in his quest and is now looking for more info that might help him.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

===X-Club===
After Beast has finished gathering his science squad, they head back to base where he introduces them to their final member, Kavita Rao. Together they hold a meeting where he explains everything about how the Decimation occurred.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #508&lt;/ref&gt; When Beast proposes they go back in time to obtain the DNA sample of the parents of a mutant, Kavita questions why they must all go when Beast says it's one of the perks of the job. She travels back with the rest of the X-Club and [[Psylocke]] to the year 1906. There she helps look over Catherine Bradley after injuring herself during the Hellfire Club's assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #512&lt;/ref&gt; During the events of Utopia, she helps raise [[Asteroid M]] from the bottom of the ocean&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; and attends the funeral of Dr. Yuriko Takiguchi when he passes away.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #515&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of Utopia, [[Karma (comics)|Karma]] and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] are requested to see Kavita Rao to inform her of their foray into Legion's mind. When Kavita mistakes Marci, a young girl who was absorbed into Legion's mind, for one of his personalities, Karma corrects her and reveals that Marci was a real person but that Legion revealed Marci doesn't have a body to return to and explains how his powers work.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' Vol. 3 #5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Coming===
When [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] return to the present, [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] begins to set his plan in motion in exterminating the mutant race. Thanks to the [[New Mutants]], they discover he has erected towers in certain points around San Francisco. [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] sends the X-Club to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #524&lt;/ref&gt; Upon arriving on one of his oil platforms where one of these towers is located, they come across a timer which goes off.&lt;ref&gt;''New Mutants'' Vol. 3 #13&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kavita's life flashes before her eyes and when the timer hits zero they end up transported to a dystopian future where they meet a now human Hank McCoy, who warns them to keep Kavita safe at all costs. Hank reveals that Hope Summers powers grew out of control and he needs Kavita to recreate her Hope serum to stop her from creating the future they see before them.

'''''Kingdom''''' is a kingdom-building [[simulation game]] developed by Thomas van den Berg and Marco Bancale with support from publisher [[Raw Fury]]. The title was released on 21 October 2015 for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] systems. A port for [[Xbox One]] was released on 8 August 2016, the ports for [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] were released on 31 January 2017, and the ports for the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]] were released on 14 September 2017 and 16 January 2018 simultaneously. A reworked version of the game, titled ''Kingdom: New Lands'', was released in August 2016, and a sequel, ''Kingdom: Two Crowns'', is set to release in 2018.

The game is played out on a [[pixel art]]-based 2 dimensional landscape; the player controls a king or queen that rides back and forth, collecting coins and using those coins to spend on various resources, such as hiring soldiers and weaponsmiths, building defenses against creatures that can attack and steal the king or queen's crown which will end the game, and otherwise expanding their kingdom. The player has otherwise little direct control of the game, and thus must use the coins they collect in judicious ways.

''Kingdom'' received generally positive reviews appreciating the game's art and music, and its approach that required the players to figure out what to do based on these elements, but felt that the tedious nature of some tasks in the game affected its end-game and replayability.

==Gameplay==
''Kingdom'' is presented to the player in a [[pixel art]], two-dimensional screen, with the goal to build up and create a kingdom while surviving various foes that will attempt to capture the player-character's crown, effectively ending their rule. The player starts the game with a randomly generated king or queen on horseback. The player can move the character on horse to the left or right, including at a gallop, but has no other direct action. As the character passes landmarks, these will produce a few coins, from which the player can pick up by riding over them, and spend on various resources, which will be marked with open coin slots when the character passes near them; to purchase an upgrade, the player must be able to provide all the required coins at that time.

Initially, such resources will include hiring wandering travelers to become part of the kingdom and creating smiths to craft weapons and tools. As the player gathers more resources, new options to spend coins will open up. For example, once the player has a citizen of the kingdom with a tool, they can build defensive walls. Many such resources include upgrades that can be purchased with coins. To get more coins, the player roams their kingdom; additional landmarks will grant more coins, while servants in the kingdom can also generate coins.

While exploration of the kingdom can lead to finding more coins and potential resources, the areas away from the main kingdom center can become more dangerous for both the player-character and any followers; further, the game has a day-and-night cycle in which more harmful creatures can roam the kingdom at night, with subsequent nights becoming more and more dangerous. Other nights may have blood moons, which will cause much larger hordes of creatures to appear. These creatures will work to destroy existing resources that the player has created, steal gold from the player-character, and if the player-character has no gold, steal their crown, which represents failure in the game from which the player will need to restart the game. The player is encouraged to manage the construction of defenses and guards to manage those defenses against the need to expand and improve the kingdom. There is an ultimate goal to achieve victory, though the player must come to determine that for themselves.

==Development==
''Kingdom'' was developed by the two-man team of Thomas van den Berg and Marco Bancale, who go by the aliases noio and Licorice, respectively. The game is an expanded, standalone version of a [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] game by noio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-02-please-games-let-me-get-stuck |title=Please games, let me be stumped |work=[[Eurogamer]] |date=3 October 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015 |first=Robert |last=Purchase}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the game was supported by [[Raw Fury]], a Sweden-based publisher launched by former members of [[Paradox Interactive]] and [[EA DICE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-battlefield-producer-launches-new-game-company-/1100-6426834/ |title=Ex-Battlefield Producer Launches New Game Company, the First "UnPublisher" |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=23 April 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015 |work=[[GameSpot]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2016, [[Raw Fury]] announced ''Kingdom: New Lands'', an expansion to the original game. New content will be added to the game that will address some of the repetitive aspects critics found on the game's original release, such as adding new lands to be explored and a seasonal climate system that affects gameplay. The expansion released on 9 August 2016, with owners of the original game able to update for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shacknews.com/article/96178/heres-over-30-minutes-of-exclusive-kingdom-new-lands-gameplay |title=Here's over 30 minutes of exclusive Kingdom: New Lands gameplay |first=Daniel |last=Perez |date=5 August 2016 |accessdate=5 August 2016 |work=[[Shacknews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within one day of its Windows, OS X, and Linux release, [[Raw Fury]] announced that it had sold enough copies to pay for the game's development. As a result, they affirmed that they will be releasing the title for the [[Xbox One]], and that all future improvements and expansions to the game will remain free to players on the forementioned platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-27-the-deceptively-harmless-kingdom-coming-to-xbox-one |title=The deceptively harmless Kingdom coming to Xbox One |first=Robert |last=Purchase |date=27 October 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015 |work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also later announced planned for a port to the [[Nintendo Switch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nintendoeverything.com/gonner-kingdom-and-more-coming-to-switch-from-raw-fury/ |title=GoNNER, Kingdom, and more coming to Switch from Raw Fury |date=15 January 2017 |publisher=Nintendo Everything |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile versions of the game, including the "New Lands" additions, for [[iOS]] and [[NVIDIA Shield]] devices were released circa March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-01-20-recommended-strategy-game-kingdom-coming-soon-to-ios-android |title=Recommended strategy game Kingdom coming soon to iOS/Android |first=Robert |last=Purchase |date=20 January 2017 |accessdate=20 January 2017 |work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kingdom'' has received generally favorable reviews.  Dan Stapleton of ''[[IGN]]'' gave the title a 7.7 out of 10, and felt the lack of instruction combined with the tension of the various random attacks created a great experience for the game.&lt;ref name="ign review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/kingdom-review |title=Kingdom Review |first=Dan |last=Stapleton |date=21 October 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015 |work=[[IGN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Purchase of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' gave the game a "Recommended" rating, believing the game achieved the right balance between being fair to the player while the player learns the mechanics of the game.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-21-kingdom-review |title=Kingdom Review |date=21 October 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015 |first=Robert |last=Purchase |work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; James Davenport of ''[[PC Gamer]]'', giving the game a 70 out of 100, was more critical of the lack of instruction, noting that a half-hour's worth of gameplay investment could be wiped away due to the player not being aware of how certain mechanics work, and that the game would be one to test a player's patience.&lt;ref name="pcgamer review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/kingdom-review/ |title=Kingdom Review |first=James |last=Davenport |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=29 October 2015 |accessdate=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviewers praised the game's retro pixel art look and its [[chiptune]] soundtrack, which created the appropriate atmosphere for the title and provided appropriate visual and audible clues as events in the game for the player to pick up on.&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcgamer review"/&gt;

Reviewers commented that once the player understood the mechanics, the end-game and subsequent replays could become tedious. Stapleton found that the lack of information or means to manage the kingdom at the end-game made the end game more frustrating than difficult, and that once he had found a strategy to deal with the attacks, the game became too easy to play.&lt;ref name="ign review"/&gt; Davenport commented that while the late game can be exciting on subsequent playthroughs, the early game of setting up the initial kingdom can become monotonous.&lt;ref name="pcgamer review"/&gt;

''Kingdom'' was nominated for the Excellence in Design award for the 2016 [[Independent Games Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg247.com/2016/01/06/her-story-2016-igf-awards/ |title=Her Story, Undertale, Darkest Dungeon receive multiple 2016 IGF Award nominations |work=[[VG247]] |date=6 January 2016 |accessdate=6 January 2016 |first=Stephany |last=Nunneley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lamar Hunt''' (August 2, 1932 – December 13, 2006) was an American businessman notable for his promotion of [[American football]], [[soccer]], [[basketball]], [[tennis]] and [[ice hockey]] in the United States and for his efforts in conjunction with his brothers, [[William Herbert Hunt]] and [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]], to corner the silver market in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 

He was the principal founder of the [[American Football League]] (AFL) and [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS), as well as MLS's predecessor, the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]] (NASL), and co-founder of [[World Championship Tennis]]. He was also the founder and owner of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the [[Kansas City Wizards]] of MLS, and at the time of his death owned two other MLS teams, [[Columbus Crew]] and [[FC Dallas]].  In [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], Hunt also helped establish the [[Worlds of Fun]] and [[Oceans of Fun]] theme parks.

The oldest ongoing national soccer tournament in the United States, the [[Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup|U.S. Open Cup]] (founded 1914), now bears his name in honor of his pioneering role in that sport stateside. He was inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1972; into the [[National Soccer Hall of Fame]] in 1982; and into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1993. The National Soccer Hall of Fame bestowed upon Hunt their Medal of Honor in 1999, an award given to only three recipients in history thus far. He was married for 42 years to his second wife Norma, and had four children, Sharron, [[Lamar Hunt Jr.|Lamar Jr.]], Daniel, and [[Clark Hunt]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Hunt was born in [[El Dorado, Arkansas]], the son of oil [[tycoon]] [[H. L. Hunt]] and younger brother of tycoons [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]] and William Herbert Hunt. Lamar was raised in [[Dallas, Texas]]. He attended [[Culver Military Academy]] and graduated from [[The Hill School]] in [[Pennsylvania]] in 1951 and [[Southern Methodist University]] in Dallas in 1956, with a B.S. degree in [[geology]]. Hunt was a [[college football]] player who rode the bench but was still an avid sports enthusiast during his time in college and throughout his entire childhood. While attending SMU in 1952, Hunt joined the [[Kappa Sigma]] fraternity. In 1972, he was selected as Kappa Sigma's Man of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Kappa Sigma Mourns Loss of Brother Lamar Hunt, Sports Industry Legend|journal=The Caduceus of Kappa Sigma|date=November 2006|issue=Winter 2006–2007|page=22|url=http://www.kappasigma.org/pdf/Caduceus_Winter_2006-2007.pdf|accessdate=2013-06-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007033103/http://www.kappasigma.org/pdf/Caduceus_Winter_2006-2007.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Founding of the American Football League===
On the strength of his great inherited oil wealth, Hunt applied for a [[National Football League]] expansion franchise but was turned down. In 1959, professional football was a distant second to [[Major League Baseball]] in popularity, and the thinking among NFL executives was that the league must be careful not to "oversaturate" the market by expanding too quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|publisher=Dallas Morning News
|title=Hunt remembered for energy, integrity
|accessdate=2006-12-14
|first=Brad|last= Townsend}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hunt also attempted to purchase the NFL's [[Chicago Cardinals]] franchise in 1959 with the intent to move them to Dallas, but was again turned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John A. |last=Drobnicki|title=Hunt, Lamar|work=The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives| volume= VIII: 2006–2008|publisher=Scribner's|year= 2010|page= 228}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Hunt approached several other businessmen who had also unsuccessfully sought NFL franchises, including fellow [[Texas|Texan]] and oil man [[Bud Adams|K. S. "Bud" Adams]] of [[Houston]], about forming a new football league, and the [[American Football League]] was established in August 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Drobnicki, pp. 228-229&lt;/ref&gt;  The group of the eight founders of the AFL teams was referred to as the "Foolish Club."  Hunt's goal was to bring professional football to Texas and to acquire an NFL team for the Hunt family. Hunt became owner of the [[Dallas Texans (AFL)|Dallas Texans]] and hired future hall-of-famer [[Hank Stram]] as the team's first head coach.

===Ownership and NFL merger===
{{Peacock|date=January 2009}}
As a response to the newly formed league and the presence of an AFL franchise in Dallas, the NFL quickly placed a new franchise of their own in Dallas, the Dallas Cowboys. As a result, the Dallas Texans, despite being one of the more successful AFL teams in the league's early days, failed to draw fans in large numbers, as the Texans had to compete with the [[Dallas Cowboys]] for fans. In one popular, though probably apocryphal, story, a reporter informed Hunt's father that the Texans had lost $1 million in their first season. In response, H.L. Hunt supposedly said, "At that rate, he can only last another 100 years." Lamar himself later said that the numbers mentioned in the story were "overly flattering." In 1963 Hunt began to consider moving the team. [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] became one of the contending cities for the franchise. In order to convince Hunt to move the team to Kansas City, mayor [[H. Roe Bartle]] promised Hunt home attendance of 25,000 people per game.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Hunt finally agreed to move the team to Kansas City, and in 1963 the Dallas Texans became the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].

In the Chiefs' first two seasons attendance did not match the levels Mayor Bartle had promised, but in 1966 average home attendance at Chiefs games increased and reached 37,000. By 1969 Chiefs' average home attendance had reached 51,000. In 1966 the Chiefs won their first AFL Championship (after having previously won it as the Dallas Texans) and reached the first ever [[Super Bowl I|Super Bowl]], which the Chiefs lost to the [[Green Bay Packers]]. The Chiefs remained successful through the 1960s, and in 1970 the Chiefs won the AFL Championship and [[Super Bowl IV]] (the last Super Bowl played when the AFL was a separate league prior to it being absorbed into the NFL as the [[American Football Conference]]) over the heavily favored [[Minnesota Vikings]].

Hunt insisted that he be listed in the team media guide as the ''founder'' of the Chiefs rather than the ''owner''. He publicly listed his telephone number in the phone book until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Drobnicki, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coinage of the term "Super Bowl"===

In 1966, the NFL and AFL agreed to merge, with a championship game between the two leagues to be played after that season. In a July 25, 1966, letter to NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]], Hunt wrote, "I have kiddingly called it the 'Super Bowl,' which obviously can be improved upon." Hunt would later say the name was likely in his head because his children had been playing with a [[Super Ball]] toy. Although the leagues' owners decided on the name "AFL-NFL Championship Game", the media immediately picked up on Hunt's "Super Bowl" name, which would become official beginning with the [[Super Bowl III|third annual game]], which was won by the AFL's [[New York Jets]] over the NFL's [[Baltimore Colts]].&lt;ref&gt;MacCambridge, Michael. ''America's Game''. New York: Random House, 2004, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The NASL: ownership and battles with the NFL===
In 1967 Hunt helped promote professional soccer in the United States. Hunt's interest in soccer began in 1962 when he accompanied his future wife, Norma, to a [[Shamrock Rovers]] game in [[Dublin]], Ireland.&lt;ref name="go"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=394199&amp;root=us&amp;cc=5739 |title=Hunt a quiet pioneer of U.S. soccer – ESPN FC|publisher=soccernet.espn.go.com|accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, he viewed the [[FIFA World Cup]] in England, and then attended nine of the next 11 World Cup tournaments.

In 1967, Hunt founded the [[Dallas Tornado]] as members of the [[United Soccer Association]]. In 1968 the league merged with the [[National Professional Soccer League (1967)|National Professional Soccer League]] to form the [[North American Soccer League (1968–84)|North American Soccer League]]. Hunt was an active advocate for the sport and the league and the [[Dallas Tornado]] won the NASL championship in 1971 and were runners-up 1973.

The NFL owners were not happy with Hunt's ownership in and promotion of pro soccer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}  The NFL attempted to force legal requirements that would disallow team ownership in more than one sport for owners of NFL franchises. This strategy backfired on the NFL, and the NASL won an anti-trust case against the NFL. A primary benefactor of this outcome was Lamar Hunt.&lt;ref name='dellapa_soccernet'&gt;{{cite news

In 1981, after 15 seasons and losses in the millions, Hunt and his Dallas Tornado partner Bill McNutt decided to merge their team with the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975–93)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] franchise, while retaining a minority stake in the Florida club. Two years later, along with Rowdies principal [[George W. Strawbridge, Jr.|George Strawbrige]], they sold the Rowdies to local investors. The move effectively ended Hunt's ties to the NASL a year before the league itself finally collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=MacCambridge | first=Michael | date=2012 | title=Lamar Hunt: A Life in Sports | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jI5GTaAjZMC&amp;dq=rowdies+tornado+merge&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|location= | publisher=[[Andrews McMeel Publishing]] | page=262 | isbn=9781449423391 | accessdate=2014-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19830914&amp;id=YqpNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=o_sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6683,4875862 | title=Rowdies sold to Bay area investors | first=Randy | last=Miranda | date=September 14, 1983 | work=[[The Ledger]] | location=[[Lakeland, Florida]] | via=Google News Archive Search | publisher=news.google.com | accessdate=2014-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major League Soccer===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Major League Soccer]] --&gt;
Hunt returned to soccer as one of the original founding investors of Major League Soccer, which debuted in 1996. He originally owned two teams: the [[Columbus Crew SC|Columbus Crew]] and the Kansas City Wizards (now [[Sporting Kansas City]]). In 1999, Hunt financed the construction of the venue now known as [[Mapfre Stadium]], the second, and first since 1913, of several large [[soccer-specific stadium]]s in the USA. In 2003, Hunt purchased a third team, the Dallas Burn (now [[FC Dallas]]), after announcing that he would partially finance the construction of their own [[Toyota Stadium (Texas)|soccer-specific stadium]]. On 31 August 2006, Hunt sold the Wizards to a six-man ownership group led by [[Cerner Corporation]] co-founders Neal Patterson and Cliff Illig.

===Other sports===

====Basketball====
Hunt was one of the founding investors of the [[Chicago Bulls]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]. He remained a minority owner until his death.

====Tennis====
In 1968, Hunt co-founded the [[World Championship Tennis]] circuit, which gave birth to the Open Era of tennis. He was inducted into the [[International Tennis Hall of Fame]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hunt to Enter Another Hall|url=http://www.itftennis.com/procircuit/tournaments/men's-tournament/info.aspx?tournamentid=1010002317|accessdate=2012-09-20|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 10, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hockey====
Hunt and [[John H. McConnell]] formed Columbus Hockey Limited, L.L.C. (CHL) in an effort to obtain a [[National Hockey League]] franchise for [[Columbus, Ohio]]. Following disagreements over the financing for an arena, McConnell accepted an offer to lease a new arena from Nationwide Insurance Enterprise. McConnell froze out CHL and Hunt and was awarded the NHL [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] franchise. See ''McConnell v. Hunt Sports Enterprises'', 132 Ohio App.3d 657, 725 N.E.2d 1193 (1999), a lawsuit that Lamar Hunt lost and thus granted McConnel sole ownership of the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]].

==Business ventures outside sports==

===Amusement parks and caves===
Hunt was the founder of two theme parks in Kansas City: [[Worlds of Fun]] and [[Oceans of Fun]], which opened in 1973 and 1982 respectively. The two parks were an outgrowth and adjoined a vast industrial park he developed in the bluffs above the [[Missouri River]] in [[Clay County, Missouri]].

Immediately south of the Hunt-founded parks is the Hunt-developed [[SubTropolis]], a 55,000,000 square foot (5,060,000&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), {{convert|1100|acre|km2|sing=on}} manmade [[limestone]] cave which is claimed to be the ''World's Largest Underground Business Complex (TM).''  Hunt's extensive business dealings in Clay County were to contribute to the Chiefs having their [[NFL Training Camp]] at [[William Jewell College]] in [[Liberty, Missouri]] until 1991.

===Silver speculation===
During the 1970s and early 1980s, Hunt and his brothers [[Nelson Bunker Hunt]] and [[William Herbert Hunt]] attempted to corner the silver market. They began buying silver in the early 1970s. By the end of 1979 their ownership of one-third of the silver market{{which?|reason=United States or world?|date=November 2018}} caused the price to rise from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to $50 an ounce in January 1980. In the last nine months of 1979, the brothers profited by an estimated $2 billion to $4 billion. However, on March 27, 1980, subsequently referred to within the precious-metals industry as [[Silver Thursday]], the price collapsed. In September 1988, the Hunt brothers filed for bankruptcy under United States Bankruptcy Code Chapter 11.

==Personal life==
Lamar Hunt had two brothers, Nelson Bunker and William Herbert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson Bunker Hunt|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Bunker_Hunt}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married twice. His first marriage to Rosemary Carr, ended in a divorce. He had two children from his first marriage. He remarried later to Norma Lynn Knobel, who he was married to until his death. He had three sons, [[Clark Hunt|Clark]], [[Lamar Hunt Jr.|Lamar Jr.]], and Daniel, as well as one daughter, Sharron Hunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lamar Hunt, a Force in Football, Dies at 74|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/15/sports/football/15hunt.html|website=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and succession==
Lamar Hunt died December 13, 2006, at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas of complications related to [[prostate cancer]]. Upon his death, Cowboys owner [[Jerry Jones]] called Hunt "a founder of the NFL as we know it today," adding "He's been an inspiration for me."&lt;ref name="wfaa_simnacher"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/121406dnmethuntobit.90f04cf.html | date=2006-12-13 | accessdate=2006-12-14 | first1=Joe|last1= Simnacher |first2=Brad |last2= Townsend | title=Sports innovator Lamar Hunt dies | publisher=WFAA |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061229024845/http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/localnews/stories/121406dnmethuntobit.90f04cf.html |archivedate = 2006-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said [[Dan Rooney]], chairman of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]: "Lamar Hunt was one of the most influential owners in professional football over the past 40-plus years, He was instrumental in the formation of the American Football League and in the AFL-NFL merger, which helped the [[National Football League]] grow into America's passion." The Mayor of [[Kansas City, Missouri]], [[Kay Waldo Barnes]], requested that all city flags fly at half-staff the following Thursday and Friday after Hunt's death.

Upon Hunt's death, his son [[Clark Hunt|Clark]] was named chairman of the Kansas City Chiefs and FC Dallas, having been elected by Hunt's other children, Lamar Hunt Jr., Sharron Munson, and Daniel Hunt. Though Hunt's wife and children share legal ownership of the Chiefs, Clark represents the team at all league owner meetings and handles the day-to-day responsibilities of the team.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

'''''Larry King Now''''' is a [[talk show]] hosted by [[Larry King]] created by Shawn Southwick King, and available on [[Ora TV]], [[Hulu]] and [[RT America]]. Launched on July 17, 2012, the series features interviews with newsmakers, celebrities, world leaders, and Internet stars. The show is similar to his previous [[CNN]] program, ''[[Larry King Live]]''.

The show is the first venture by Ora TV, an on-demand TV network founded in March 2012 by King, Shawn Southwick King, and [[Carlos Slim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url  =http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-201207170101reedbusivarietynvr1118056646-20120717,0,312185.story|title = Larry King's 'Now' to stream on Hulu: Internet vid giant pacts with Carlos Slim Helu's Ora TV venture|first=Andrew |last=Wallenstein|work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date =July 17, 2012|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2013, [[RT America]] announced that ''Larry King Now'' would be broadcast on their network as well, along with the Ora TV show ''[[Politicking with Larry King]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Dylan|last=Byers|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/media/2013/05/larry-king-joins-russian-channel-rt-164941.html|title=Larry King joins Russian channel RT|work=[[Politico]]|date=May 29, 2013|accessdate=September 27, 2015|publisher=[[Capitol News Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press|url=http://rt.com/news/larry-king-joins-rt-873/|title=RT America to broadcast Larry King's new political show|work=[[RT (TV network)|RT News]]|date=May 29, 2013|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kenneth|last=Rapoza|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2013/06/06/larry-king-comes-out-of-retirement-joins-russian-tv/|title=Larry King Comes Out Of Retirement, Joins Russian TV|work=[[Forbes]]|publisher=Forbes, Inc.|date=June 6, 2013|accessdate=September 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts of both shows are also published on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/LarryKingNow |title=Larry King |author=Larry King |authorlink=Larry King |work=[[YouTube]] channel |year=2012 |accessdate=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- ******* NOTE *******Please do not add any films to this list if they are not cited properly. A proper citation would meet [[WP:Reliability]] and would state clearly that the film in question was a box office bomb. If you cannot cite the film, do not add it or it will be reverted immediately --&gt;
In the film and media industry, if a [[film]] released in [[Movie theater|theatres]] fails to [[Break-even (economics)|break even]] by a large amount, it is considered a '''[[box office bomb]]''' or '''box office flop''', thus losing money for the [[Film distributor|distributor]], [[Film studio|studio]], and/or [[production company]] that invested in it. Due to the secrecy surrounding costs and profit margins in the film industry, figures of losses are usually rough estimates at best, and there are often conflicting estimates over how much a film has lost. To accommodate this uncertainty the losses are presented as ranges where this is the case and the list is ordered alphabetically in the absence of a definitive order. Because the films on the list have been released over a large span of time currency [[inflation]] is also a factor that must be considered, so the losses are [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|adjusted for inflation]] using the [[United States Consumer Price Index]] to enable a fair comparison.

Some films on this list grossed more than their production budgets yet are still regarded as flops.  This can be due to [[Hollywood accounting]] practices that typically manipulate profits or keep costs secret to avoid profit-sharing agreements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=April 14, 2015 |first=Gary |last=Susman |title=The 19 Biggest Box Office Bombs in Movie History |url=http://news.moviefone.com/2015/04/14/biggest-box-office-bombs-movie-history/ |work=[[Moviefone]] |accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is also possible for films to lose money legitimately even when the theatrical gross exceeds the budget. This is because a distributor does not collect the full gross, and the full cost of a film can substantially exceed its production budget once distribution and marketing is taken into account. For example, tax filings in 2010 for [[Cinemark Theatres]] show that only 54.5 percent of ticket revenues went to the distributor, with the exhibitor retaining the rest. While the distributor's cut will vary from film to film, a Hollywood studio will typically collect half the gross in the United States and less in other parts of the world. Marketing often represents a substantial share of the overall cost of the picture too: for a film with an average sized budget the promotion and advertising costs are typically half that of the production budget, and in the case of smaller films it is not unusual for the cost of the marketing to be higher than the production budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=January 31, 2011 | authorlink= Charlie Jane Anders |first=Charlie Jane |last= Anders |title=How much money does a movie need to make to be profitable? |url=http://io9.com/5747305/how-much-money-does-a-movie-need-to-make-to-be-profitable |work=[[io9]] |accessdate=July 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, a company can make profits from a box office bomb when ancillary revenues are taken into account, such as [[Home video|home media]] sales and rentals, [[television broadcast]] rights, and licensing fees, so a film that loses money at the box office can still eventually break even.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=June 26, 2012 |first=Adam |last=Davidson |title=How Does the Film Industry Actually Make Money |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/magazine/how-does-the-film-industry-actually-make-money.html?_r=0 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Low''''' is an ongoing American [[Post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] [[science fiction]] comics series written by [[Rick Remender]] and drawn by Greg Tocchini. Coloring duties were taken over from Tocchini by [[Dave McCaig]] as of issue 8. Low has been published since July 2014 by [[Image Comics]].

The series is set billions of years in the future of the Earth after the start of [[Sun#After core hydrogen exhaustion|the sun's expansion into a red giant]] has made the surface uninhabitable. It follows the lives of the two million survivors in the underwater city of Salus; its helmsmen, the Caine family; and its pirate enemies. The protagonists of the first issues are Stel Caine, who searches for life-supporting planets with robotic probes, her husband Johl, and their children. Remender summarized the story as being about "one woman's optimism in the face of inevitable and true doom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yehl|first1=Joshua|title=RICK REMENDER TALKS NEW IMAGE SERIES LOW|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/18/rick-remender-talks-new-image-series-low|accessdate=29 August 2014|work=[[IGN]]|date=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first issues of the series received critical praise. In [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'' magazine]], Robert Tutton wrote of the "primal, silent awe" inspired by Tocchini's "surreal" and "dazzling" art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Paste|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2014/08/low-1-by-rick-remender-and-greg-tocchini-review.html|last1=Tutton|first1=Robert|title=Low #1 by Rick Remender and Greg Tocchini Review|accessdate=29 August 2014|date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[IGN]], Tres Dean noted the creators' "complex and intriguing worldbuilding and precise, emotional character work", as well as Tocchini's "impeccable and breathtaking" art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dean|first1=Tres|title=Low #1 Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/31/low-1-review|accessdate=29 August 2014|work=IGN|date=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hemlock Marreau''' is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Francophone]] [[detective]] created by Robert Farrow. To date he has featured in eleven "detective comedy" plays. Marreau speaks with a French accent but seems unsure of his true country of birth. His arch rival ''Professor Maurice Hearty'' accuses him of in fact being English – and of being his half brother.
Marreau is regularly assisted by his able assistant ''Gwendolyn Smith (née Bayne)'' and hindered by his affable, wealthy but rather dim friend ''Simon Simpson''.
The eleven plays are listed below along with the years of their first performance.
# ''Marreau and the Chocolate Policeman'' (1991)
# ''Marreau and the African Moon'' (1992)
# ''Marreau and the Curse of Cardiff'' (1993)
# ''Marreau and the Bloody Carpet'' (1994)
# ''Marreau and the Sword of Carthage'' (1995)
# ''Marreau and the Clouds of Death'' (1996)
# ''Requiem for Marreau'' (2001)
# ''Marreau and the Tregalleon Inheritance'' (2002)
# ''Marreau and the Terror of Tring'' (2004)
# ''Marreau and the Grey Dagger'' (2010)
# ''Marreau and the Killer Rabbit'' (original title: ''Marreau and the Trilobite of Rheims'') (2014)

All the plays have premièred in the [[Tring]] area, being produced by Frayed Knot Theatre Company. The first three plays were performed originally in village halls in the area, while all subsequent ones have been staged at The Court Theatre, Pendley, Tring. The latest play in the sequence, ''Marreau and the Killer Rabbit'', was performed there in April/May 2014.

[[File:IJonesKnightmasque.jpg|thumb|upright|Costume for a Knight, by [[Inigo Jones]]: the plumed helmet, the [[Muscle cuirass|"heroic torso"]] in armour and other conventions were still employed for [[opera seria]] in the 18th century.]]

The '''masque''' was a form of festive  [[Noble court|courtly]] [[entertainment]] that flourished in 16th- and early 17th-century Europe, though it was developed earlier in [[Italy]], in forms including the [[intermedio]] (a public version of the masque was the [[medieval pageant|pageant]]). A masque involved music and dancing, singing and acting, within an elaborate [[stage design]], in which the architectural framing and costumes might be designed by a renowned architect, to present a deferential allegory flattering to the patron. Professional actors and musicians were hired for the speaking and singing parts.  Often the masquers, who did not speak or sing, were courtiers: the English queen [[Anne of Denmark]] frequently danced with her ladies in masques between 1603 and 1611, and [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and [[Charles I of England]] performed in the masques at their courts. In the tradition of masque, [[Louis XIV of France]] danced in [[ballet]]s at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] with music by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mith.umd.edu/comus/cegenre.htm  'History of the Masque Genre']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The masque tradition developed from the elaborate pageants and courtly shows of [[Duchy of Burgundy|ducal Burgundy]] in the late [[Middle Ages]]. Masques were typically a complimentary offering to the prince among his guests and might combine pastoral settings, mythological fable, and the dramatic elements of ethical debate. There would invariably be some political and social application of the allegory. Such pageants often celebrated a birth, marriage, change of ruler or a [[Royal Entry]] and invariably ended with a tableau of bliss and concord. Masque imagery tended to be drawn from Classical rather than Christian sources, and the artifice was part of the Grand dance. Masque thus lent itself to [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] treatment in the hands of master designers like [[Giulio Romano]] or [[Inigo Jones]]. The [[New Criticism|New Historians]], in works like the essays of Bevington and Holbrook's ''The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque'' (1998),&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bevington]] and Peter Holbrook, editors, ''The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque'' 1998 {{ISBN|0-521-59436-7}}).&lt;/ref&gt; have pointed out the political subtext of masques. At times, the political subtext was not far to seek: ''[[The Triumph of Peace]]'', put on with a large amount of parliament-raised money by [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], caused great offence to the [[Puritan]]s. [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals]], often even more overtly political, were among the most spectacular entertainments of her day, although the "[[intermedio|intermezzi]]" of the [[Medici]] court in [[Florence]] could rival them.

===Dumbshow===
In English theatre tradition, a [[dumbshow]] is a masque-like interlude of silent [[mime artist|mime]] usually with [[allegory|allegorical content]] that refers to the occasion of a play or its theme, the most famous being the dumbshow played out in ''[[Hamlet]]'' (III.ii). Dumbshows might be a moving spectacle, like a procession, as in [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' (1580s), or they might form a pictorial tableau, as one in the Shakespeare collaboration, ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]''  (III.i)—a tableau that is immediately explicated at some length by the poet-narrator, [[John Gower|Gower]]. Dumbshows were a Medieval element that continued to be popular in early [[Elizabethan drama]], but by the time ''Pericles'' (c. 1607–08) or  ''Hamlet''  (c. 1600–02) were staged, they were perhaps quaintly old-fashioned: “What means this, my lord?” is Ophelia's reaction. In English masques, purely musical interludes might be accompanied by a dumbshow.

==Origins==
The masque has its origins in a folk tradition where masked players would unexpectedly call on a nobleman in his hall, dancing and bringing gifts on certain nights of the year, or celebrating dynastic occasions. The rustic presentation of "Pyramus and Thisbe" as a wedding entertainment in Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' offers a familiar example. Spectators were invited to join in the dancing. At the end, the players would take off their masks to reveal their identities.

===England===
In England, [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor court]] masques developed from earlier ''[[guising]]s'', where a masked allegorical figure would appear and address the assembled company—providing a theme for the occasion—with musical accompaniment; masques at [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]]'s court emphasized the concord and unity between Queen and Kingdom. A descriptive narrative of a processional masque is the masque of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]] in [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' (Book i, Canto IV).  A particularly elaborate masque, performed over the course of two weeks for Queen Elizabeth, is described in the 1821 novel ''[[Kenilworth (novel)|Kenilworth]]'', by [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]].  Later, in the court of James I, narrative elements of the masque became more significant. Plots were often on classical or allegorical themes, glorifying the royal or noble sponsor. At the end, the audience would join with the actors in a final dance. [[Ben Jonson]] wrote a number of masques with stage design by [[Inigo Jones]]. Their works are usually thought of as the most significant in the form. Sir [[Philip Sidney]] also wrote masques.

[[William Shakespeare]] wrote a masque-like interlude in ''[[The Tempest (play)|The Tempest]],'' understood by modern scholars to have been heavily influenced by the masque texts of Ben Jonson and the stagecraft of Inigo Jones. There is also a masque sequence in his ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]''. [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' (with music by [[Henry Lawes]]) is described as a masque, though it is generally reckoned a [[Pastoral|pastoral play]].

Reconstructions of [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] masques have been few and far between. Part of the problem is that only texts survive complete; there is no complete music, only fragments, so no authoritative performance can be made without interpretive invention. 

There is a detailed, humorous and malicious account by Sir [[John Harington (writer)|John  Harington]]  of a 1606 masque of [[Solomon]]  and Sheba:  however he was not so much  concerned with the masque itself as   with the notoriously heavy drinking at the Court of King  [[ James I of England|James I]]; " the entertainment went forward,  and most of the presenters  went backward, or fell down, wine did so occupy their upper chambers".  As far as we can ascertain the details of the masque,  the [[Queen of Sheba]]  was to bring gifts to the King, representing Solomon, and was to be followed by the spirits of Faith, Hope, Charity, Victory and Peace. Unfortunately, as Harington gleefully reported, the actress playing the Queen tripped over the steps of the throne, sending her gifts flying;  Hope and Faith were too drunk to speak a word, while Peace, annoyed at finding her way to the throne blocked, made good use of her symbolic olive branches to slap anyone who was in her way.

By the time of the [[English Restoration]] (1660), the masque was passé, but the English [[semi-opera]] which developed in the latter part of the 17th century, a form in which [[John Dryden]] and [[Henry Purcell]] collaborated, borrows some elements from the masque and further elements from the contemporary courtly [[Opera|French opera]] of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]].

in the 18th-century, masques were even less frequently staged. "[[Rule, Britannia!]]" started out as part of ''[[Alfred (opera)|Alfred]]'', a masque about [[Alfred the Great]] co-written by [[James Thomson (poet)|James Thomson]] and [[David Mallet (dramatist and poet)|David Mallet]] with music by Thomas Arne which was first performed at [[Cliveden]], country house of [[Frederick, Prince of Wales]]. Performed to celebrate the third birthday of Frederick's daughter [[Princess Augusta of Great Britain|Augusta]], it remains among the best-known British patriotic songs up to the present, while the masque of which it was originally part is only remembered by specialist historians.

==Legacy==
The most outstanding [[Humanism|humanists]], poets and artists of the day, in the full intensity of their creative powers, devoted themselves to producing masques; and until the Puritans closed the English theatres in 1642, the masque was the highest artform in England. But because of its ephemeral nature, not a lot of documentation related to masques remains, and much of what is said about the production and enjoyment of masques is still part speculation.

==Later masques==
While the masque was no longer as popular as it was at its height in the 17th Century, there are many later examples of the masque. During the late 17th century, English semi-operas by composers such as [[Henry Purcell]] had masque scenes inset between the acts of the play proper. In the 18th century, [[William Boyce (composer)|William Boyce]] and [[Thomas Arne]], among other composers, continued to utilize the masque genre mostly as an occasional piece, and the genre became increasingly associated with patriotic topics. There are isolated examples throughout the first half of the 19th century.

With the renaissance of English musical composition during the late 19th and early 20th century (the so-called [[English Musical Renaissance]]), English composers turned to the masque as a way of connecting to a genuinely English musical-dramatic form in their attempts to build a historically-informed national musical style for England. Examples include those by [[Arthur Sullivan]], [[George Macfarren]], and even [[Edward Elgar]], whose imperialistic ''[[Crown of India]]'' was the central feature at the London Coliseum in 1912. Masques also became common as scenes in operettas and musical theatre works set during the Elizabethan period.

In the 20th century, [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]] wrote several masques, including his masterpiece in the genre, ''[[Job, a masque for dancing]]'' which premiered in 1930, although the work is closer to a [[ballet]] than a masque as it was originally understood. His designating it a masque was to indicate that the modern [[choreography]] typical when he wrote the piece would not be suitable.

[[Constant Lambert]] also wrote a piece he called a masque, ''Summer's Last Will and Testament'', for orchestra, chorus and baritone. His title he took from [[Thomas Nash]], whose masque&lt;ref&gt;It was a "comedy" when it was printed, in 1600 as ''A Pleasant Comedie, call'd Summers Last will and Testament''&lt;!--correct as entered--&gt;, but, as a character announces, "nay, 'tis no Play neither, but a show." With Nash's stage direction ''"Enter Summer, leaning on Autumn's and Winter's shoulders, and attended on with a train of Satyrs and wood-Nymphs, singing: [[Vertumnus]] also following him"'' we are recognizably in the world of Masque.&lt;/ref&gt; was probably first presented before the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], perhaps at his London seat, [[Lambeth Palace]], in 1592.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25333">Claims of '''media bias in South Asia''' attract constant attention. The question of bias in [[South Asian]] media is also of great interest to people living outside of South Asia. Some accusations of media bias are motivated by a disinterested desire for truth, some are politically motivated. Media bias occurs in television, newspapers, school books and other media.

==India==

In British India, bias in the  media coverage of the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] has been highlighted by historians. Calcutta's two leading English-language newspapers were ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'' (at that time a British-owned newspaper){{sfnm|A. Sen|1977|p=52, ''fourth footnote''|Ó Gráda |2015|2p=42}} and ''[[Amrita Bazar Patrika]]''. In the early months of the [[famine]], the government applied pressure on newspapers to "calm public fears about the food supply"{{sfn|Ó Gráda |2015|p=4}} and follow the official stance that there was no rice shortage. This effort had some success; ''The Statesman'' published editorials asserting that the famine was due solely to speculation and hoarding, while "berating local traders and producers, and praising ministerial efforts."{{sfn|Ó Gráda |2015|p=4}} News of the famine was also subject to strict war-time censorship&amp;nbsp;– even use of the word "famine" was prohibited{{sfn|J. Mukherjee|2015|p=125}}&amp;nbsp;– leading ''The Statesman'' later to remark that the UK government "seems virtually to have withheld from the British public knowledge that there was famine in Bengal at all".{{sfn|Ó Gráda |2015|loc=&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;57, citing "Consequences of Untruth," ''Statesman'', 12 October 1943}}

[[Arun Shourie]] and others have criticized "biased Marxist influences" in the media, as well as alleged corruption of Marxist historians, particularly during the time when they controlled the ICHR. These claims include the allegation that the history of the [[Islamic invasion of India|Islamic invasion]] has been whitewashed and censored in Indian school-books and in other media.&lt;ref&gt; Bryant, E. E. (2014). Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture: The Indo-Aryan Migration Debate. Cary, USA: Oxford University Press, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Shourie, A. (2014). Eminent historians: Their technology, their line, their fraud. HarperCollins&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporters Without Borders said that India is at 133rd of 180 countries in the 2016 World Press Freedom Index, due to the number of journalists killed and the impunity for crimes of violence committed against journalists.&lt;ref&gt;https://rsf.org/ranking&lt;/ref&gt; Many media stations in India provided vast coverage of the [[2002 Gujarat violence|Gujarat Riots]] in 2002 in which a large number of Muslims were murdered but have often failed to report on the [[persecution of Hindus]] in Muslim-dominated [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]]. There are also denials of the fact that Indians in general and Hindus in particular are being ethnically cleansed in Kashmir. With regard to the [[2002 Gujarat violence]], some commentators have pointed out a disregard for factual reporting on the part of what they term "left-liberal" newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailypioneer.com/359125/Left-liberal-media-subverts-truth.html Left-liberal media subverts truth] Daily Pioneer - August 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Radia tapes controversy]] there was an attempted blackout orchestrated by many prominent Indian TV channels and newspapers, however, the news gained prominence following sustained pressure on social networking sites Twitter&lt;ref name="dnatwitter"&gt;{{cite news|title=#barkhagate: Protests in 140 characters leave no space for gray areas|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report_barkhagate-protests-in-140-characters-leave-no-space-for-gray-areas_1471128|newspaper=[[Daily News and Analysis|DNA]]|date=24 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mynews1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter world abuzz over Radia-Barkha tapes|url=http://www.mynews.in/News/twitter_world_abuzz_over_radia_barkha_tapes_N111382.html|work=[[rediff.com]]|publisher=Mynews.in|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Facebook&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Barkhagate|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Barkhagate/133196416734121|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dnaSampathblog /&gt;&lt;ref name="hinduglasshouse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Those living in glass houses... |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2010/11/23/stories/2010112350760800.htm|work=[[The Hindu]] Business Line|accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ciol1netizen"&gt;{{cite web|title=2G scam: Netizens bark at Barkha, Vir Sanghvi |url=http://www.ciol.com/News/News/News-Reports/2G-scam-Netizens-bark-at-Barkha-Vir-Sanghvi/143737/0/|work=CIOL|accessdate=23 November 2010|date=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', "Twitter has played an important role in launching what has become an international conversation on the issue, with the Indian diaspora weighing in".&lt;ref name="wpost1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Indian journalists accused of secretly helping politicians, businesses|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/22/AR2010112203831.html|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=23 November 2010|author=Emily Wax|date=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, only a handful of the mainstream newspapers in India, like The ''[[Deccan Herald]]'',&lt;ref name="deccanherald"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anchored in mire : ''Journalists are only expected to be witnesses.''|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/114750/anchored-mire.html|accessdate=23 November 2010|newspaper=[[The Deccan Herald]]|date=23 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indian Express]]&lt;ref name="expressbuzzstir"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://expressbuzz.com/nation/radia-tapes-featuring-senior-scribes-create-stir/224516.html | title=Radia tapes featuring senior scribes create stir | publisher=Express Buzz | work=[[The Indian Express]] | date=20 November 2010 | accessdate=23 November 2010 | author=Gautam Datt}}&lt;/ref&gt; had openly written about the tapes.

According to critics, Dutt and Sanghvi knew about the link between the government and the media industry but delayed reporting the corruption.&lt;ref name="whatexactly"/&gt;

"Paid news" is a phenomenon which has recently come to light, involving politicians paying newspapers to print favorable articles. Some groups have criticized paid news including Bloomberg, who claimed that "''paid news'' was rotting India's democracy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-10-25/-paid-news-is-rotting-India-s-democracy-choudhury.html 'Paid News' Is Rotting India's Democracy] Bloomberg, 25 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Analytic Monthly Review'' has also criticized India's media problems to well known problems in the political economy after the adoption of neo-liberal policies.&lt;ref name="AMR"&gt;[http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2013/amr160813.html "The Reality of Media in India "] Analytical Monthly Review, Aug 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, a two person panel of the [[Press Council of India]] investigated the phenomenon of paid news in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report on paid news (30 July 2010) |url=http://www.presscouncil.nic.in/OldWebsite/CouncilReport.pdf |website=www.presscouncil.nic.in |publisher=Press council of India |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in a detailed 72 page report citing names and instances where information that had been paid for had been passed off as genuine news.&lt;ref name="rpt"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thakurta |first1=P.J. |last2=Sreenivas Reddy |first2=K |title='Paid News': The Buried Report |url=https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/paid-news-the-buried-report/266542 |accessdate=3 July 2018 |publisher=Outlook |date=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Press council rejected their findings and published a shorter watered down version of the report.&lt;ref&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/06/18/india-media-buries-paid-news-report/ India Media Buries Paid News Report] India Real Time - WSJ, 18 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pakistan==

There are serious demographic issues regarding the minority non-[[Islam]] population in Pakistan. The [[Christian]], [[Hindu]], and [[Sikh]] populations have gone from 23% to 2% in the period 1947-1997. International rights groups, like the Center for Indian Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, call this [[ethnic cleansing]] and accuse the media of not informing the public about these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umassd.edu/indic/press/dc_press_release.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060718233641/http://www.umassd.edu:80/indic/press/dc_press_release.cfm |archivedate=2006-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also allegations by [[Amnesty International]] that the local media some times glosses over reports of persecution against the non-Islamic population in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA330082001?open&amp;of=ENG-PAK&lt;/ref&gt;

Using oppressive laws the government has also banned or officially silenced popular television channels. The [[Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority]] (PEMRA) has been used to silence the broadcast media by either suspending licenses or by simply threatening to do so. In many cases these channels were shifted to obscure numbers in channel line-up. In addition, media is also exposed to propaganda from state agencies, pressured by powerful political elements and non-state actors involved in the current conflict.&lt;ref name="i-m-s.dk"&gt;[http://www.i-m-s.dk/files/publications/1491%20Pakistan.final.web.pdf "Media in Pakistan: Between radicalisation and democratisation in an unfolding conflict"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229205633/http://www.i-m-s.dk/files/publications/1491%20Pakistan.final.web.pdf |date=29 December 2009 }}, International Media Support, July 2009, 56 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of channels have been shut down in the past with the latest such incident involving [[Geo TV]] and other channels in the [[Geo TV#Geo Television Network|Geo TV network]] after a [[Fatwa]] was issued against it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tribune.com.pk/story/709514/cable-operators-urge-pemra-to-shut-down-geo "Cable operators urge PEMRA to shut down Geo"], ''The Express Tribune'', 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The shutdown came after the network attempted to air allegations on the involvement of [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] in the attempted assassination of its leading anchor [[Hamid Mir]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/22/pakistan-geo-news-blasphemy-pakistan-sufi-song-wedding "Pakistan's Geo News becomes latest target in blasphemy accusation trend"], Jon Boone, ''The Guardian'', 22 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/world/asia/attack-on-journalist-spurs-new-dispute-in-pakistan.html "Pakistan Is Asked to Shut Down News Channel"], Declan Walsh and Salman Masoodapril, ''New York Times'', 22 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-30465-Pakistans-most-popu.ar-Geo-channels-shut-down "Pakistan’s most popular Geo channels shut down"], Ahmad Noorani, ''The News International'', 22 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The press is also restricted in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] (FATA), where independent radio is allowed only with permission from the government.&lt;ref name=FH-FOTP-2010&gt;[http://freedomhouse.org/template.cfm?page=251&amp;year=2010 "Country report: Pakistan (2010)"], ''Freedom of the Press 2010'', Freedom House, 27 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prevalent culture of self- and state-censorship in the media’s coverage of sensitive issues has also been criticized, particularly in matters related to religion, blasphemy laws, and the Pakistan Army.&lt;ref&gt;Yusuf, Huma. "Mapping digital media: Pakistan." Open Society Foundations (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

The urban bias in Pakistani media has been criticized by Amir Rana, director of the Institute for Peace Studies: “There is little space [in our media] not only for alternative ideas or narratives but also for issues of a common citizen ... The narratives that we have seen in the mainstream media in Pakistan are basically controlled by three media centers in Pakistan: Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore. There is little space in the mainstream media for views, perspectives, and information from other parts of Pakistan.” &lt;ref&gt;Yusuf, Huma. "Mapping digital media: Pakistan." Open Society Foundations (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sri Lanka==

The government of [[Sri Lanka]] has been accused of controlling the media. Measures like the Public Security Ordinance and the Sixth Amendment to the Sri Lankan Constitution have been accused of limiting a reporters freedom.

The Sixth Amendment to Sri Lanka's constitution, inserted as Article 157A, has been accused of threatening civic disability and seizing of property by banning promotion of separatism. The Public Security Ordinance (PSO) law is often applied liberally when the government applies emergency regulations. This is quite often as Sri Lanka has been ruled under Emergency for a cumulative total of over 20 years since it gained independence from the British. The Saturday Review, the English paper published in [[Jaffna]] and the Aththa, the Communist Sinhala language daily were banned in the early eighties under the PSO. When the Aththa was banned its press was also sealed. In the seventies, the government sealed the printing press of the Independent Newspapers Ltd. (Davasa Group) by using the emergency regulations.

Under the Emergency Regulations (E.R), all material relating to a subject specified in a gazetted presidential proclamation, has to be submitted for censoring by a 'competent authority.' The 'competent authority' is usually politically favoured civil servant. Recently, the regime made history by appointing a military officer as the government censor. Material censored under such provisions has included comment on the high cost of living, on the dismissal of an employee of a state corporation, allegedly for an article he wrote for his trade union journal, on the marketing problems of passion fruit growers, criticism of a minister's statement in Parliament about a public corporation, and a reference to an alleged assault on two civilians.

'''''Musique mesurée à l'antique''''' ({{IPA-fr|myzik məzyʁe a lɑ̃tik|lang}}) was a style of vocal musical composition in [[France]] in the late 16th century.  In ''musique mesurée'', longer syllables in the [[French language]] were set to longer note values, and shorter syllables to shorter, in a [[homophonic]] texture but in a situation of [[meter (music)|metric]] fluidity, in an attempt to imitate contemporary understanding of Ancient Greek music&lt;!--Ancient Greek music/poetry was one in the same, so I'm not sure which word is more appropriate here--&gt;. Although this compositional method did not attain popularity at first, it attracted some of the most famous composers of the time. Its basis in a desire to re-create the artistic [[ethos]] of [[Ancient Greece]], especially in respect to text declamation, had a strong similarity to contemporary movements in Italy, such as the work of the [[Florentine Camerata]] which engendered the first [[opera]]s, and brought about the beginning of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] era in music.

==History==

Pieces written as ''musique mesurée'' were settings of the poetical form known as ''vers mesurés''.  Beginning in the late 1560s in [[Paris]], under the direction of [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]], a group of poets known as the [[Pléiade]] attempted to recreate the metrical effect of ancient Greek and Latin poetry in French, using the quantitative principles of those languages.  The attempt was more than an academic one:  Baïf and his associates, horrified by the barbarity of the age, including the bloody religious wars which raged throughout the last decades of the century, sought to improve mankind by bringing back the ancient diction, which was believed to have had a positive ethical effect on its hearers.  For this attempt they had the approval of the current king of France, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], and they met in secret to plan their musical revolution.  Baïf, with the royal patent, founded the ''[[Académie de Poésie et de Musique]]'' in 1570, along with his intimate musical associate [[Joachim Thibault de Courville]].  Poet [[Pierre de Ronsard]] was also involved in the group.

As originally planned, the members of the ''Académie'' would be in a hierarchy of two grades:  first, the composers and singers, known as the ''professionnels'', and after that, the gentleman listeners, known as the ''auditeurs'', who were also to provide financial backing for the enterprise.  Aside from this small group of aristocrats, no one else was invited.  The concerts took place at Baïf's house in Paris:  Charles IX himself, who provided much of the patronage, was often present.

Some of the house rules have been recorded.  There was to be no talking, or disturbances of any kind, during the singing, and anyone who came in late had to wait until the end of a piece to be seated – rather like modern concert-hall etiquette.  Musicians were to rehearse every day, and no music was to be copied or taken away from the area of performance.  The music was so closely guarded, at least during the early years of the ''Académie'', that no music of the originating composer – Courville – is known to have survived.

The ''Académie'' was short-lived, and probably did not survive after 1573, the year of the death of Charles IX.  Another similar group, the ''Académie du Palais'', which met at the [[Louvre]] after 1573 with the backing of the new king, [[Henri III of France|Henri III]], seemed to carry on some of the work of the previous group, but its aim seems to have been more to debate philosophical issues than to reform humanity through reviving Ancient Greek and Latin poetry and music.  The activities, if any, of the original Académie after this time are poorly-documented:  while the musicians continued to meet, it is not known if they met in a formal setting, as they had prior to the death of Charles IX.  This was during a period of increasing religious turmoil, ending in the fighting in Paris in 1589, and the assassination of the king; associations of humanists such as the ''Académie'', which included both Catholics and Protestants, became increasingly difficult (Baïf, a [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]], even wrote a sonnet in 1572 praising the [[St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre]]; [[Claude Le Jeune]], a Protestant, was nearly murdered during the siege of Paris in 1589).

Even though the original ''Académie'' had faded away within a few years of its founding, several prominent composers found the concept of ''musique mesurée'' to be so attractive as to make it their primary compositional method.  The most famous of these was [[Claude Le Jeune]], followed by [[Jacques Mauduit]], [[Eustache Du Caurroy]], [[Nicolas de la Grotte]], and [[Guillaume Costeley]].

==Musical style==

When ''musique mesurée'' first appeared, it was used mainly in French secular songs known as [[chanson]]s.  Most of the [[chanson]]s written in the style were for five voices, unaccompanied, although instruments began to be used as accompaniment before long.  Typically they consisted of a [[strophe]] and a [[refrain]]; the refrain would have the same music each time it recurred.  As composers realized the adaptability of the musical style to other forms, they began to employ it elsewhere, for example in sacred music, such as psalm settings.

The texture of the music was almost uniformly [[homophony|homophonic]], with all the voices singing essentially the same rhythm.  The repeating pattern of longs and shorts, following the poetry, was irregular, leading to the perception to a modern ear of irregular meters.  Occasional short melismas – decorative passages to ease the monotonous rhythm – appeared in many of the parts, especially in the work of Claude Le Jeune.

Long and short syllables were invariably set in a 2:1 relation, for example quarter-notes on the longs and eighth-notes on the shorts.  This was in order to mirror long and short syllables used in classical poetry, which in contemporary poetry would be stress accents.  In modern notation, the meters would be irregular; often music in the ''musique mesurée'' is left unbarred in modern transcription, or given bar lines only at the end of phrases.

In addition to their use of ancient metres, composers of ''musique mesurée'' also used later interpretations of classical [[musical mode]]s in order to move the emotions of their listeners, as it was described in ancient Greek sources.&lt;ref&gt;''Music in the Western World: A history in documents''. Edited by Piero Weiss and Richard Taruskin. United States, Schirmer, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

While ''musique mesurée'' was created and sung by a small group of people for a limited audience, and for the most part in secret, it was to have a profound effect on French music for the next hundred years.  The ''[[air de cour]]'', the secular style of song which dominated the musical scene in France beginning in the 1580s, used the principles of ''musique mesurée'' with the difference that it usually used rhyming verse.  In addition, even in the late 17th century, the influence of ''musique mesurée'' can be seen in the style of French [[recitative]], both in [[opera]] and in sacred music.

Composers that continued using the methods of ''musique mesurée'' into the 17th century included Jacques Mauduit, who used it for creating large works for mixed vocal and instrumental forces, roughly in the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian]] style, and Eustache Du Caurroy, who used the method for psalm settings.  [[Marin Mersenne]], in his ''[[Harmonie universelle]]'' of 1636-7, praised Du Caurroy as the finest practitioner of the style.

The '''Musée Français de la Carte à Jouer''' is a museum of [[playing card]]s located at  16, rue Auguste Gervais, [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]], a suburb of [[Paris]], [[France]]. It is open Wednesdays through Sundays. An admission fee is charged.

The museum was established in 1986 based on the collections of Louis Chardonneret (1849–1935) and Robert Thissen, and since 1997 has occupied its current location in the former '''[[Château d'Issy]]''' of the [[Princes of Conti]]. 

It contains about 9000 objects, including nearly 6500 playing cards, 980 etchings, drawings, and posters, and more than other 1000 objects related to card games. It also presents temporary exhibitions. Other galleries tell the story of Issy-les-Moulineaux and the chateau of the Princes of Conti, the beginnings of [[aviation]], and noted artists associated with Issy ([[Auguste Rodin]], [[Henri Matisse]], and [[Jean Dubuffet]]).

The museum won the 1999 [[European Museum of the Year Award]].

'''Non-redemption''' is the term used by [[family fun center]]s and [[Amusement arcade|arcades]] to indicate that a particular game or attraction does not give out tickets for prizes, as opposed to a [[redemption game]].

Redemption games are typically [[arcade games]] of skill that reward players proportionally to their score in the game. The reward most often comes in the form of tickets, with more tickets being awarded for higher scores. These tickets can then be redeemed (hence the name) at a central location for prizes. The most inexpensive prizes (candy, small plastic or rubber toys) may only require a small number of tickets to acquire, while the most expensive ones ([[skateboards]], low end electronics) may require several thousand. In general, the amount of money spent to win enough tickets for a given prize will exceed the value of the prize itself.

Some redemption games, particularly electronic ones such as [[Flamin' Finger]], involve elements of chance, which can be set by the operator.

A variation on the ticket-based redemption game is the merchandiser, which directly displays and dispenses merchandise, rather than dispensing tickets which are then redeemed for prizes.
Redemption games can be seen as the modern successor to carnival games, as the same general principles apply.

'''''Orator''''' was written by [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] in the latter part of the year 46 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Tempest, Kathryn. "Prologue." In Cicero: politics and persuasion in ancient Rome. London: Continuum, 2011. 1-7.&lt;/ref&gt; It is his last work on [[rhetoric]], three years before his death.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson"&gt;Cicero, Marcus Tullius, and George L. Hendrickson. Brutus Orator / Cicero. With an English transl. by H.M. Hubbell.. Rev. and repr. ed. London: Heinemann [u.a.], 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing rhetoric, Cicero addresses previous comments on the five canons of rhetoric: [[Inventio]], [[Dispositio]], [[Elocutio]], [[Memoria]], and [[Pronuntiatio]]. In this text, Cicero attempts to describe the perfect orator, in response to [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]]’ request. ''Orator'' is the continuation of a debate between [[Brutus]] and [[Cicero]], which originated in his text ''[[Brutus (Cicero)|Brutus]]'', written earlier in the same year. 

The oldest partial text of ''Orator'' was recovered in the monastery of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] and now is located in the library at [[Avranches]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendrickson, G. L. . "Cicero's Correspondence with Brutus and Calvus on Oratorical 	Style ." ''The American Journal of Philology'' 47, no. 3 (1926): 237-238.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty-seven existing manuscripts have been discovered from this text. Another complete text was discovered in 1421, near [[Milan]] in the town of [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]]. These two texts vary considerably between the two manuscripts and modern translators rely on both. 

In 46. B.C, when Cicero wrote ''Orator'', many young Roman men revolted against the stylistic paradigms put forward by Cicero, and from most Roman traditions in general.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt; Cicero writes in a defensive posture to this hostile audience.

==Context and summary==
In ''Orator'', Cicero depicts several models for speakers. Cicero states to the Romans the importance of searching and discovering their own sense of [[rhetoric]]. “I am sure, the magnificence of [[Plato]] did not deter [[Aristotle]] from writing, nor did [[Aristotle]] with all his marvelous breadth of knowledge put an end to the studies of others” &lt;ref name= "Cicero"&gt;Cicero, Marcus Tullius, and B White. Cicero's Brutus, or history of famous orators: 	also, his Orator, or accomplished speaker. Now first translated into English, by E. Jones. London: Printed for B. White, 1776.&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero encouraged the [[plebeians]] through his writing, “Moreover, not only were outstanding men not deterred from undertaking [[Liberal arts education|liberal]] pursuits, but even craftsmen did not give up their arts because they were unable to equal the beauty of the picture of Ialysus . . . .”&lt;ref name= "Cicero" /&gt; Cicero proposes that rhetoric cannot be confined to one specific group but rather outlines a guide that will lead to the creation of successful orators across Roman society.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt;

In ''Orator'', Cicero also addressed the accusation lodged by his fellow senators, including [[Brutus]], that he was an “[[Atticism|Atticist]].” Cicero addresses this claim by saying that he is too independent and bold to be associated with [[Atticism]], producing his own unique style. Cicero claims the perfect orator creates his own “[[elocutio]],” or diction and style, rather than following this movement.&lt;ref name="Hendrickson" /&gt;
	Cicero states that all five canons are equally important. Throughout the text, Cicero advises his Roman audience on how to form proper oratory by formal guidelines but also how to specialize in individually in their own sense of oratory. ''Orator'' is written with ideas ranging from the construction of arguments to rhetorical performance. In relation to other Ciceronian works on rhetoric, Orator receives less treatment with scarce research compared to other rhetorical works.

==Goals of the Orator==
The three aims of the orator, according to Cicero, are "''docere, delectare, et movere''."  That is: to prove your thesis to the audience, to delight the audience, and to emotionally move the audience.&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Donald|title=Rhetoric and Poetry in the Renaissance|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/10140/10140-h/10140-h.htm|publisher=Distributed Proofreaders|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emotional vividness of poetic language becomes part of the rhetorical tools in service of persuading the audience to your point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cicero|first=Marcus Tullius|title=Orator|url=http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/cicero/orator.shtml#69|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Partisan film''' ({{lang-sh-Latn|Partizanski film}}) is the name for a subgenre of [[war film]]s, made in [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR/SFR Yugoslavia]] during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. In the broadest sense, main characteristics of partisan films are that they are set in Yugoslavia during [[World War II]] and have [[Yugoslav Partisans]] as main protagonists, while antagonists are [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces and their collaborators.

==Definition and scope==
There are disagreements, even among the film critics, about the exact definition of the genre.&lt;ref name="Jutarnji 2009"/&gt; Partisan films are often equated solely with the populist, entertainment-oriented branch of the genre, characterized by epic scope, [[ensemble cast]]s, expensive production, and emotionally intense scenes, all introduced into Yugoslav war films by [[Veljko Bulajić]]'s ''[[Kozara (film)|Kozara]]'' (1962).&lt;ref name="Filmski programi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SFF"/&gt; The other branch{{spaced ndash}}much less interesting to the Communist establishment{{spaced ndash}}was represented by [[modernist]] films, ranging from the poetic naturalism of the [[Yugoslav Black Wave]] to experimental [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] films.&lt;ref name="SFF"/&gt;

By the 1980s, economic hardship in the country, as well as change in the ideological landscape, particularly with the younger Yugoslav generation, caused a waning of interest in the genre, and the critical and commercial failure of Bulajić's ''[[Great Transport]]'' (1983) is usually seen as a symbolic end of the partisan film era.&lt;ref&gt;''Titoism, Self-Determination, Nationalism, Cultural Memory: Volume Two, Tito's Yugoslavia, Stories Untold'', p. 61-62&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of [[Fadil Hadžić]]'s ''The Raid on Drvar'' (1963), Croatian film critic [[Jurica Pavičić]] identifies seven key characteristics of what he calls "super-Partisan films":&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pavičić|2003|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Focus on crucial, well-known, "textbook" examples of Partisan struggle, such as major battles and operations, which are then given an officially sanctioned interpretation.
* Absence of authentic, high-profile figures of Partisan struggle, with the exception of [[Josip Broz Tito]]. In Pavičić's view, the rationale for this was to avoid threatening Tito's [[cult of personality]].
* Mosaic structure in which sometimes dozens of characters take part, and their fate is followed throughout the film. These characters represent different classes or walks of life (intellectuals, peasants), or different ethnicities.
* Mixing of the comic with the tragic.
* The presence of foreign (non-Yugoslav) characters as arbiters. Their role is to witness and verify the martyrdom and heroism of Yugoslav peoples as Partisan films depict them, sending a symbolical message ("There it is, the world acknowledges us as we are").
* The characteristic treatment of the Germans: although they are portrayed as villains, and are demonized in various ways, they are also shown to be superior in power and discipline, and are depicted as an efficient, sophisticated, even glamorous adversary.
* ''[[Deus ex machina]]'' endings, in which the Partisans break out of seemingly hopeless situations.
Pavičić's analysis was criticized for not being universally applicable to Partisan films, and a number of notable exceptions to the above formula were provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jovanović|2011|pp=51–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''S-Town''''' is an investigative journalism [[podcast]] hosted by Brian Reed and created by the producers of ''[[Serial (podcast)|Serial]]'' and ''[[This American Life]]''.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web|last1=Locke|first1=Charley|title=The Creators of ‘Serial’ Are Back With ‘S-Town,’ a Binge-Ready New Podcast|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/03/s-town-podcast/|website=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; All seven chapters were released on March 28, 2017. The podcast was downloaded a record-breaking 10 million times in four days,&lt;ref&gt;Moran, Rob, [http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/new-podcast-from-serial-makers-stown-breaks-download-records-20170402-gvc4l2.html "New podcast from Serial makers, S-Town, breaks download records"], ''The Sydney Morning Herald'', April 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and it had been downloaded over 40 million times by May of 2017.

==Synopsis==
In 2012, antiquarian [[Horology|horologist]] John B. McLemore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Drew|title=Woodstock man at the center of "S-Town" podcast|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20170328/woodstock-man-at-center-of-s-town-podcast|website=tuscaloosanews.com|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; sent an email to the staff of the show ''This American Life'' asking them to investigate an alleged murder in his hometown of [[Woodstock, Alabama]], a place McLemore claimed to despise. After a year of exchanging emails, and several months of conversation with McLemore, producer Brian Reed traveled to Woodstock to investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dibdin|first1=Emma|title=How The Serial Team's New Podcast S-Town Evolved From True Crime Into Human Tragedy|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a54090/shittown-podcast-interview-julie-snyder/|website=Esquire|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reed investigated the crime, and eventually found that no such murder took place, though he struck up a friendship with the depressed but colorful character of McLemore. He recorded conversations with McLemore and other people in Woodstock, which are played on the podcast.

McLemore killed himself by drinking [[potassium cyanide]] on June 22, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John B.

In the narrative of the podcast, this occurs at the end of the second episode; subsequent episodes deal with the fallout from McLemore's death while exploring more of McLemore's life and character.

==Title==
Though the podcast was promoted under the name ''S-Town'', Reed reveals in the first episode that this is a euphemism for "Shittown," John B. McLemore's derogatory term for his hometown of [[Woodstock, Alabama]].&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; Reed generally refers to the podcast by the non-euphemized name in the episodes themselves.

McLemore’s small hometown Woodstock, Alabama after John’s request that he investigate the murder and cover up of a young man named Dylan Nichols. John informs Brian that Kabrahm Burt bragged to an acquaintance named Jake Goodson that he had killed Dylan. After many failed attempts to speak to Jake Goodson, Brian begins to suspect that John is hiding something. Brian also meets Jake's brother Tyler, who does work for John and is very good friends with him. After days of searching for evidence with no results, Jake’s wife Skylar drops by John’s on a whim and finally confirms that she was there when Kabrahm admitted to killing Dylan.&lt;ref&gt;https://stownpodcast.org/chapter/1&lt;/ref&gt; |LineColor=A62821

Finally, Brian seeks out Kabrahm to hear from the suspected murderer firsthand, however, he discovers that the murder was completely fabricated. John explains his discontent with the indifference of the people in S-town.

Brian returns to Alabama to attend John's funeral and meets Tyler, who informs Brian that he and John had a falling out the day before his suicide. John's mother Mary Grace is taken in by John's cousin Reta and her husband, which Tyler believes is an attempt to get to her and John's assets. Further complicating things is the fact that John intended to leave his assets to Tyler, including a rumored stash of gold, but John didn't leave a will, meaning Tyler has no legal right to claim them. Tyler claims he will take the cousins to court and if that doesn't work, he'll take matters into his own hands.

''S-Town'' was culturally popular and received mixed{{Disputed inline|Reviews only mixed?|date=February 2018}} critical reviews. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''{{'s}} [[Ty Burr]] thought the show was complex and voyeuristic. He asked the question "is ''S-Town'' a freak show for the NPR crowd?" and described the series as "seven chapters of provocative [[red herring]]s that almost but never quite add up to a place, a people, or a man".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Burr |first=Ty |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2017/04/17/town-art-exploitation-complicated/7kW0hf0v2XA0chPRsNufPI/story.html |title=Is ‘S-Town’ art or exploitation?

The podcast's critics claimed that the studio took advantage of John's death in order to gain publicity. ''Crixeo'', an online arts monthly, argues that Reed did not have the right to publicly out John as [[queer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.crixeo.com/s-town-ethics/|title=‘S-Town’ and the Ethics of Storytelling&amp;nbsp;– Crixeo|date=2017-05-29|work=Crixeo|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, other views contend that ''S-Town'' was a way for them to take the story of John's death and shed light on mental health in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.health.com/depression/s-town-john-mclemore|title=7 Ways 'S-Town' Showed How Devastating Mental Illness Can Be|work=Health.com|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Atlantic]]'''s Spencer Kornhaber praised the series for its journalism, and humanism, as the series "hints at the possibility of cultural reconciliation" within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/03/s-town-podcast-review-empathy-cultural-divides/521325/|title='S-Town' Is a Monument to Human Empathy|last=Kornhaber|first=Spencer|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rebecca Nicholson from ''[[The Guardian]]'' called the series "a noble attempt at understanding life", as the series showed "the great hope that resides within", by showing a person trying to survive within their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/apr/03/s-town-review-its-hard-to-recall-a-more-touching-devastating-podcast-serial-john-b-mclemore-brian-reed|title=S-Town review – it’s hard to recall a more touching, devastating podcast|last=Nicholson|first=Rebecca|date=2017-04-03|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian'' gave ''S-Town'' a critical review. The opinion piece called S-town “a good story, but an indefensible one.” The article states that the podcast is supposed to leave you feeling positive, however instead it feels forced. The author feels that the podcast doesn’t fully addressed the main quandary at the center of S-town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/22/s-town-never-justifies-its-voyeurism-and-that-makes-it-morally-indefensible |first=Gay |last=Alcorn |title=S-Town never justifies its voyeurism, and that makes it morally indefensible |work=The Guardian |date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Seokjeon''''' ("stone battle") {{korean|hangul=석전|hanja=石戰}} was an ancient Korean ritual game or pastime. Originating as a form of martial training, ''seokjeon'' involved two teams of combatants throwing stones at one another. Over time, it developed into a formalised game.&lt;ref name="Yi2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=I-Hwa Yi|title=Korea's Pastimes and Customs: A Social History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcsMRc6pbQoC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=21 March 2013|year=2006|publisher=Homa &amp; Sekey Books|isbn=978-1-931907-38-5|pages=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although similar pastimes to ''seokjeon'' probably date back to the Iron Age, the first known record of the stone battle game (in the ''[[Book_of_Sui|Sui Shu]]'') describes it being played by the subjects of [[Goguryeo]] in the sixth century C.E. The king of Goguryeo was present at these contests, in which participants throw stones and shouted in an attempt to drive the opposing team into the Daedong River.&lt;ref name="Yi2006"/&gt;

By the time of the [[Joseon|Joseon period]], the stone battle game had become more formulaic, and had spread to the general population. Players would gather into two lines and strike one another with light clubs or tiles. The activity was still popular with royalty; [[U of Goryeo|King U of Goryeo]] is recorded as being an aficionado of the game.&lt;ref name="Yi2006"/&gt;

Despite this development, the stone battle game retained strong ties to the military. [[Sejong the Great]] sponsored stone battles between military units, and volunteers for these events were granted numerous perks and privileges - it was even possible for commoners who signed up for such games to gain government posts as a result.&lt;ref name="Yi2006"/&gt; Whilst still somewhat formalised, these fights were nevertheless a form of military training, as evidenced by the fact that Sejong deployed his stone battle teams against barbarian incursions in the north of Goryeo.&lt;ref name="Yi2006"/&gt;

As a result of royal patronage and military appropriation, the stone battle game became increasingly popular in the capital [[Seoul]], where it was a common pastime during the festival of ''[[Dano (Korean festival)|Dano]]''. The high rate of injury caused the city's Correctional Tribunal to ban the game for a time, but it was still played in rural areas outside the city. A minor scandal was caused when three royal princes staged such an illicit stone battle in 1438, which led to numerous injuries and several deaths; as a result, King Sejong was obliged to banish them and tighten the ban on stone-fighting.&lt;ref name="Yi2006"/&gt;

The prohibition was not lifted until 1469, by which time stone battles had again become a popular civilian game rather than a military training exercise. It was often played between neighbouring villages.&lt;ref name="Yi2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kwang-gyu Yi|title=Korean Traditional Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8BJyAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=21 March 2013|year=2003|publisher=지문당|isbn=978-89-88095-49-2|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large crowds of spectators would gather for these events, which could last for hours or even days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Neff|first=Robert|title=Stone battles from the past, a Joseon New Year event|url=http://www.jejuweekly.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=2357|accessdate=21 March 2013|newspaper=The Jeju Weekly|date=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some areas the game was used as a tool for divination, with the outcome supposedly indicating how successful the year's harvest would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seokjeon|url=http://folkency.nfm.go.kr/eng/dicMain/S2_index.jsp?sub_url=dicParser.jsp%3Fref%3DS%26DIC_ID%3D223|work=Encyclopedia of Korean Folklore and Traditional Culture|accessdate=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone battles could be enormous affairs, lasting for several days and involving large gangs of players. The cities of [[Gimhae]], Seoul and [[Pyongyang]] staged particularly impressive stone battles, usually during the  ''Damo'' festivities. Such events often came close to civil unrest, with ''seokjeon'' players in Pyeong-yang targeting the ''[[yangban]]'' who owned the land, stoning their houses and holdings. However, the stone-throwers were not always on the wrong side of the rioting; there are reports that the [[Ōei Invasion#Aftermath|Japanese Riots In Three Ports]] of 1510 were quelled largely as a result of the skilled stone battle players who faced the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Yi2006"/&gt;

The [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese]] eventually suppressed the game during the early part of the twentieth century, blaming it for causing social instability. As a result, it has largely died out in modern Korea.&lt;ref name="Yi2006"/&gt;

The '''Stop Online Piracy Act''' ('''SOPA''') was a controversial United States [[Bill (law)|bill]] introduced by [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Lamar S. Smith]] (R-TX) to expand the ability of U.S. law enforcement to combat online [[copyright infringement]] and online trafficking in [[Counterfeit consumer goods|counterfeit goods]]. Provisions included the requesting of court orders to bar [[online advertising|advertising]] networks and payment facilities from conducting business with infringing websites, and [[web search engine]]s from linking to the websites, and court orders requiring [[Internet service provider]]s to block access to the websites. The proposed law would have expanded existing criminal laws to include unauthorized [[streaming media|streaming]] of copyrighted content, imposing a maximum penalty of five years in prison.

Proponents of the legislation said it would protect the intellectual-property market and corresponding industry, jobs and revenue, and was necessary to bolster enforcement of [[copyright]] laws, especially against foreign-owned and operated websites. Claiming flaws in existing laws that do not cover foreign-owned and operated websites, and citing examples of active promotion of rogue websites by U.S. search engines, proponents asserted that stronger enforcement tools were needed. The bill received strong, bipartisan support in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It also received support from the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Governors Association, The National Conference of Legislatures, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Attorneys General, the Chamber of Commerce, the Better Business Bureau, the AFL–CIO and 22 trade unions, the National Consumers League, and over a hundred associations representing industries throughout the economy which claim that they are being harmed by online [[Piracy (media)|piracy]].&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcleland/2011/12/14/sopa-fixes-isolate-opponents-especially-google/ |title=SOPA Fixes Isolate Opponents, especially Google |author=Scott Cleland |work=Forbes |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents argued that the proposed legislation threatened free speech and innovation, and enabled law enforcement to block access to entire [[Internet domain]]s due to infringing content posted on a single [[blog]] or webpage. They also stated that SOPA would bypass the "safe harbor" protections from liability presently afforded to websites by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. Some library associations also claimed that the legislation's emphasis on stronger copyright enforcement would expose libraries to prosecution. Other opponents claimed that requiring search engines to delete domain names violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and could begin a worldwide [[arms race]] of unprecedented [[Internet censorship]].

On January 18, 2012, the [[English Wikipedia]], [[Google]], and an estimated 7,000 other smaller websites coordinated a service blackout,&lt;ref name="DailyMail1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Waugh |first=Rob |title=U.S Senators withdraw support for anti-piracy bills as 4.5 million people sign Google's anti-censorship petition |publisher=Daily Mail |location=United Kingdom |date=2012-01-20 |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2088860/Flood-online-protest-downs-U-S-senate-websites-4-5-million-people-sign-Googles-anti-censorship-petition.html |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in protest against the bill.

In response to the protest actions, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) stated, "It's a dangerous and troubling development when the platforms that serve as gateways to information intentionally skew the facts to incite their users and arm them with misinformation",&lt;ref name="Farrell"/&gt; and "it's very difficult to counter the misinformation when the disseminators also own the platform."&lt;ref name="Wortham"/&gt; Access to websites of several pro-SOPA organizations and companies such as RIAA, CBS.com, and others was impeded or blocked with [[denial-of-service attack]]s which started on January 19, 2012. Self-proclaimed members of the "[[hacktivist]]" group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] claimed responsibility and stated the attacks were a protest of both SOPA and the [[United States Department of Justice|United States Department of Justice's]] shutdown of [[Megaupload]] on that same day.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Some opponents of the bill support the [[Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act]] (OPEN) as an alternative.&lt;ref name=Gruenwald&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/critics-of-online-piracy-bills-release-their-own-draft-legislation-20111208|title=Critics of Online-Piracy Bills Release Their Own Draft Legislation|author=Juliana Gruenwald|date=2011-12-08|publisher=NationalJournal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keepthewebopen.com/|title=OPEN: Online Protection &amp; Enforcement of Digital Trade Act|publisher=keepthewebopen.com| accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 2012, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Smith postponed plans to draft the bill: "The committee remains committed to finding a solution to the problem of online piracy that protects American intellectual property and innovation ... The House Judiciary Committee will postpone consideration of the legislation until there is wider agreement on a solution."&lt;ref name="NYT-20120120"/&gt;

==History==
{{See also|List of legislators who support or oppose SOPA/PIPA}}
[[File:Lamar Smith, Official Portrait, c112th Congress.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Lamar S. Smith|Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX)]] introduced the SOPA bill.]]
Bill 3261 or {{USBill|112|H.R.|3261}}, was a [[bill (proposed law)|proposed law]] that was introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives]] on October 26, 2011, by [[House Judiciary Committee]] Chair [[U.S. representative|Representative]] [[Lamar S. Smith]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[List of United States Representatives from Texas|TX]]) and a bipartisan group of 12 initial co-sponsors.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost" /&gt; Presented to the [[House Judiciary Committee]], it builds on the similar [[PRO-IP Act]] of 2008 and the corresponding Senate bill, the [[PROTECT IP Act]] (PIPA).&lt;ref name="house1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Innovation/2012/0119/PIPA-and-SOPA-What-you-need-to-know|title=PIPA and SOPA: What you need to know|author=Jim Abrams|date=19 January 2012|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The originally proposed bill would allow the [[United States Department of Justice]], as well as copyright holders, to seek [[court order]]s against websites outside U.S. jurisdiction accused of enabling or facilitating [[copyright infringement]]{{Clarify|date= January 2012}}. A court order requested by the DOJ could include barring [[online advertising]] networks and payment facilitators from conducting business with websites found to infringe on federal criminal intellectual-property laws, barring [[search engine]]s from linking to such sites, and requiring [[Internet service provider]]s to block access to such sites.&lt;ref name="pcworld" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CRS Summary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR03261:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; |title=Bill Summary by Congressional Research Service |publisher=Thomas&amp;nbsp;– Library of Congress |date=October 26, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/643NehNoc?url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR03261:@@@D&amp;summ2=m&amp; |archivedate=December 19, 2011 |accessdate=November 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bill establishes a two-step process for intellectual property-rights holders to seek relief if they have been harmed by a site dedicated to infringement. The rights holder must first notify, in writing, related payment facilitators and ad networks of the identity of the website, who, in turn, must then forward that notification and suspend services to that identified website, unless that site provides a counter notification explaining how it is not in violation. The rights holder can then sue for limited [[injunctive relief]] against the site operator, if such a counter notification is provided, or if the payment or advertising services fail to suspend service in the absence of a counter notification.&lt;ref name="CRS Summary" /&gt;

The second section covers penalties for streaming video and for selling counterfeit drugs, military materials, or consumer goods. The bill would increase penalties and expand copyright offenses to include unauthorized [[streaming media|streaming]] of copyrighted content and other intellectual property offenses. The bill would criminalize unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content if they knowingly misrepresent the activity of the site, with a maximum penalty of five years in prison for ten such infringements within six months.  The copyrighted content can be removed, and infringements can lead to the site being shut down.&lt;ref name="CRS Summary" /&gt; In July 2013, the Department of Commerce's Internet Policy Task Force issued a report endorsing "[a]dopting the same range of penalties for criminal streaming of copyrighted works to the public as now exists for criminal reproduction and distribution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The bill provides immunity from liability to the ad and payment networks that comply with this Act or that take voluntary action to sever ties to such sites. Any copyright holder who knowingly misrepresents that a website is involved in copyright infringement would be liable for damages.&lt;ref name="pcworld" /&gt;

Supporters include the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], pharmaceuticals makers, media businesses, and the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]]. They state it protects the intellectual-property market and corresponding industry, jobs and revenue, and is necessary to bolster enforcement of copyright laws, especially against foreign websites.&lt;ref name="SOPA (Stop Online Piracy Act) debate: Why are Google and Facebook against it?" /&gt; They cite examples such as Google's $500 million settlement with the Department of Justice for its role in a scheme to target U.S. consumers with ads to illegally import [[prescription drugs]] from Canadian pharmacies.&lt;ref name="lamar" /&gt;

Opponents state that it violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]],&lt;ref name="LHTribe"&gt;{{cite web |last=Tribe |first=Laurence H. |title=THE "STOP ONLINE PIRACY ACT" (SOPA) VIOLATES THE FIRST AMENDMENT |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/75153093/Tribe-Legis-Memo-on-SOPA-12-6-11-1 |date=December 6, 2011 |publisher=[[Scribd]] |accessdate=January 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is [[Internet censorship]],&lt;ref name="albanesius" /&gt; will cripple the Internet,&lt;ref name="Will Online Piracy Bill Combat 'Rogue' Web Sites or Cripple the Internet?" /&gt; and will threaten [[whistle-blowing]] and other [[free speech]] actions.&lt;ref name="LHTribe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Proposed Copyright Bill Threatens Whistleblowing and Human Rights" /&gt;

In October, 2011, co-sponsor Representative [[Bob Goodlatte]] (R-VA), chairman of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]]'s [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Intellectual Property, Competition, and the Internet|Intellectual Property sub-panel]], told ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' that SOPA is a rewrite of the [[PROTECT IP Act|Senate's bill]] that addresses some tech-industry concerns, noting that under the House version of the legislation copyright holders won't be able to directly sue intermediaries such as search engines to block infringing websites and would instead need a court's approval before taking action against third parties.&lt;ref name="thehill" /&gt;

On December 12, 2011 a revised version of the bill was tabled. Titled the "Manager's Amendment", it contained a number of changes in response to criticism of the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Musil | first = Steven | date = December 16, 2011 | title = SOPA revised but still reviled | work = CNET | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-1001_3-57344035-92/sopa-revised-but-still-reviled/ | accessdate = January 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the revisions, the definition of sites that might be subject to enforcement was narrowed: the amendment limited such actions to sites that are designed or operated with the intent to promote copyright infringement, and it now only applies to non-US sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gross | first = Grant | date = January 14, 2012 | title = GOP lawmakers seek to postpone PIPA vote| work = Computerworld | url = http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9223444/SOPA_author_to_remove_ISP_blocking_provision| accessdate = January 25, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Zapler | first = Mike | date = December 14, 2011 | title = Smith fires back at Google, critics|work = Politico | url = http://www.politico.com/story/2011/12/smith-fires-back-at-google-critics-070435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==

===Protecting intellectual property of content creators===
According to Rep. Goodlatte, "Intellectual property is one of America's chief job creators and competitive advantages in the global marketplace, yet American inventors, authors, and entrepreneurs have been forced to stand by and watch as their works are stolen by foreign infringers beyond the reach of current U.S. laws.  This legislation will update the laws to ensure that the economic incentives our Framers enshrined in the Constitution over 220 years ago—to encourage new writings, research, products, and services— remain effective in the 21st century's global marketplace, which will create more American jobs."&lt;ref name="HousePress" /&gt;

Rights holders see intermediaries—the companies who host, link to, and provide [[e-commerce]] around the content—as the only accessible defendants.&lt;ref name="Rights and wronged"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21540234|title=Rights and Wronged|work=The Economist|date=November 26, 2011|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sponsor Rep. [[John Conyers]] (D-MI) said, "Millions of American jobs hang in the balance, and our efforts to protect America's intellectual property are critical to our economy's long-term success."&lt;ref name="HousePress" /&gt;  Smith added, "The Stop Online Piracy Act helps stop the flow of revenue to rogue websites and ensures that the profits from American innovations go to American innovators."&lt;ref name="HousePress" /&gt;

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) representative who testified before the committee said that the motion picture and film industry supported two million jobs and 95,000 small businesses.&lt;ref name="CNET-Hollywood" /&gt;

===Protection against counterfeit drugs===
[[Pfizer]] spokesman John Clark testified that patients could not always detect cleverly-forged websites selling drugs that were either misbranded or simply counterfeit.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111119172503/http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Clark%2011162011.pdf Testimony of John P. Clark]; House Judiciary Committee Hearing; November 16, 2011; Pg. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

RxRights, a consumer-advocacy group, issued a statement saying that Clark failed "to acknowledge that there are Canadian and other international [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] that do disclose where they are located, require a valid doctor's [[Medical prescription|prescription]] and sell safe, brand-name medications produced by the same leading manufacturers as prescription medications sold in the U.S."&lt;ref name="dosodisclose" /&gt; They had earlier said that SOPA "fails to distinguish between counterfeit and genuine pharmacies" and would prevent American patients from ordering their medications from Canadian pharmacies online.&lt;ref name="nocanada" /&gt;

Bill sponsor Smith accused [[Google]] of obstructing the bill, citing its $500 million settlement with the DOJ on charges that it allowed ads from Canadian pharmacies, leading to illegal imports of prescription drugs.&lt;ref name="lamar" /&gt; Shipment of prescription drugs from foreign pharmacies to customers in the US typically violates the [[Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act]] and the [[Controlled Substances Act]].&lt;ref name="because" /&gt;

==Impact on online freedom of speech==
{{See also|Freedom of speech|Freedom of information}}

Mentioned on the Texas Insider, President Obama  "will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression", said interviewer Jay Carney.&lt;ref name="txinsider-jan2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.texasinsider.org/?p=57474 | title=Texas Insider | publisher=Texas Insider | accessdate=January 19, 2012 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'''s ''Techland blog'', Jerry Brito wrote, "Imagine if the U.K. created a blacklist of American newspapers that its courts found violated celebrities' privacy? Or what if France blocked American sites it believed contained hate speech?"&lt;ref name="techland"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://techland.time.com/2011/11/07/congresss-piracy-blacklist-plan-a-cure-worse-than-the-disease/#ixzz1eG1bPxLM |title=Congress's Piracy Blacklist Plan: A Cure Worse than the Disease? |author=Jerry Brito |work=Time |date=November 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Center for Democracy and Technology warned, "If SOPA and PIPA are enacted, the US government must be prepared for other governments to follow suit, in service to whatever social policies they believe are important—whether restricting hate speech, insults to public officials, or political dissent."&lt;ref name="US Piracy Law Could Threaten Human Rights" /&gt;

[[Laurence H. Tribe]], a [[Harvard University]] professor of [[constitutional law]], released an [[open letter]] on the web stating that SOPA would "undermine the openness and free exchange of information at the heart of the Internet. And it would violate the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]".&lt;ref name="LHTribe" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20120101"&gt;{{cite news |last=Carr |first=David |title=The Danger of an Attack on Piracy Online

The [[AFL–CIO]]'s Paul Almeida, arguing in favor of SOPA, has stated that free speech was not a relevant consideration, because "Freedom of speech is not the same as lawlessness on the Internet. There is no inconsistency between protecting an open Internet and safeguarding intellectual property. Protecting intellectual property is not the same as censorship; the First Amendment does not protect stealing goods off trucks."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111119175444/http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/Almeida%2011162011.pdf Statement of Paul E. Almeida, President, DEPARTMENT FOR PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES, AFL–CIO]; Before the Committee on the Judiciary, November 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autocratic countries===
According to the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Proxy server#Bypassing filters and censorship|proxy servers]], such as those used during the [[Arab Spring]], can also be used to [[Proxy server#Accessing services anonymously|thwart]] copyright enforcement and therefore may be regulated by the act.&lt;ref name="eff" /&gt;

[[John Palfrey]], co-director of the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]], expressed disagreement with the use of his research findings to support SOPA. He wrote that "SOPA would make many [[DNS]] circumvention tools illegal," which could put "dissident communities" in autocratic countries "at much greater risk than they already are." He added, "The single biggest funder of circumvention tools has been and remains the U.S. government, precisely because of the role the tools play in online activism.  It would be highly counter-productive for the U.S. government to both fund and outlaw the same set of tools."&lt;ref name="palfrey"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/palfrey/2011/12/22/sopa-and-our-2010-circumvention-study |title=John Palfrey » Blog Archive » SOPA and our 2010 Circumvention Study |publisher=Blogs.law.harvard.edu |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marvin Ammori]] has stated the bill might make [[The Tor Project]] illegal. Initially sponsored by the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|U.S. Naval Research Laboratory]],&lt;ref&gt;Dingledine, Roger; Mathewson, Nick; Syverson, Paul (13 August 2004). "Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router." Proc. 13th USENIX Security Symposium. San Diego, California&lt;/ref&gt; the Tor Project creates [[encryption]] technology used by dissidents in repressive regimes (that consequently outlaw it). Ammori says that the U.S. Supreme Court case of ''[[Lamont v. Postmaster General]]'' 381 U.S. 301 (1965) makes it clear that Americans have the First Amendment right to read and listen to such foreign dissident free speech, even if those foreigners themselves lack an equivalent free speech right (for example, under their constitution or through Optional Protocols under the United Nations [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ammori |first=Marvin |url=http://ammori.org/2011/12/14/first-amendment-stop-online-piracy-acts-managers-amendment-some-thoughts/ |title=First Amendment &amp; Stop Online Piracy Act's Manager's Amendment: Some Thoughts « Marvin Ammori |publisher=Ammori.org |date=December 14, 2011 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on websites==

===Websites that host user content===
Opponents have warned that SOPA could have a negative impact on online communities. Journalist [[Rebecca MacKinnon]] argued in an [[op-ed]] that making companies liable for users' actions could have a [[chilling effect (law)|chilling effect]] on user-generated sites such as YouTube. "The intention is not the same as [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|China's Great Firewall]], a nationwide system of Web censorship, but the practical effect could be similar," Mackinnon stated.&lt;ref name="Stop the Great Firewall of America" /&gt; The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) warned that websites [[Etsy]], [[Flickr]] and [[Vimeo]] all seemed likely to shut down if the bill becomes law.&lt;ref name="What's On the Blacklist?"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/11/whats-blacklist-three-sites-sopa-could-put-risk |title=What's On the Blacklist? Three Sites That SOPA Could Put at Risk |author=Parker Higgins |work=Deeplinks blog |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |date=November 15, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy analysts for [[New America Foundation]] say this legislation would enable law enforcement to take down an entire domain due to something posted on a single blog, arguing, "an entire largely innocent online community could be punished for the actions of a tiny minority".&lt;ref name="The Internet's Intolerable Acts"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technocracy/2011/12/stop_online_piracy_act_and_protect_ip_act_a_pair_of_bills_that_threaten_internet_freedom_.html |title=The Internet's Intolerable Acts |author1=James Losey  |author2=Sascha Meinrath  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Slate Magazine |date=December 8, 2011 |accessdate=December 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional concerns include the possible impact on common Internet functions such as [[hyperlink|links]] from one site to another or accessing data from the cloud. EFF claimed the bill would ban linking to sites deemed offending, even in search results&lt;ref name="eff1" /&gt; and on services such as Twitter.&lt;ref name="cdt" /&gt; Christian Dawson, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Virginia-based hosting company [[ServInt]], predicted that the legislation would lead to many [[cloud computing]] and Web hosting services moving out of the US to avoid lawsuits.&lt;ref name="Lawmakers seek alternative to Stop Online Piracy Act" /&gt; Even without SOPA, the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] agency (ICE) has already launched extradition proceedings against [[Richard O'Dwyer]] in the UK. O'Dwyer hosted the [[TVShack.net]] website which had links to material elsewhere and did not host any files. ICE has stated that it intends to pursue websites even if their only connection to the USA is a .com or .net web domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Piracy' student loses US extradition battle over copyright infringement|url= https://www.theguardian.com/law/2012/jan/13/piracy-student-loses-us-extradition?INTCMP=SRCH |accessdate=January 19, 2012 | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Peter|last=Walker|date=January 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] has stated that the requirement that any site must self-police user generated content would impose significant liability costs and explains "why venture capitalists have said en masse they won't invest in online startups if PIPA and SOPA pass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Timm |first=Trevor |title=How PIPA &amp; SOPA Violate White House Provisions Supporting Free Speech and Innovation |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |date=January 16, 2012 |url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/01/how-pipa-and-sopa-violate-white-house-principles-supporting-free-speech |accessdate=January 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wassom|first=Brian|title=Would SOPA &amp; PIPA Violate the First Amendment?|url=http://www.wassom.com/would-sopa-pipa-violate-the-first-amendment.html|publisher=Brian Wassom|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the bill countered these claims, arguing that filtering is already common. Michael O'Leary of the MPAA testified on November 16 that the act's effect on business would be more minimal, noting that at least 16 countries already block websites and that the Internet still functions in those countries.&lt;ref name="hearingnotes" /&gt; MPAA Chairman [[Chris Dodd]] noted that Google figured out how to block sites when China requested it.&lt;ref name="Dodd slams Google over legislation"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118047080 |title=Dodd slams Google over legislation |author=Ted Johnson |publisher=Variety Magazine |date=December 8, 2011 |accessdate=December 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107210631/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118047080 |archivedate=January 7, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ISPs in Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Italy blocked [[The Pirate Bay]] after courts ruled in favor of music and film industry litigation, and a coalition of film and record companies has threatened to sue [[British Telecom]] if it does not follow suit.&lt;ref name="British ISP" /&gt; [[Maria Pallante]] of the [[United States Copyright Office]] said that Congress had updated the [[Copyright Act of 1976|Copyright Act]] before and should again, or "the U.S. copyright system will ultimately fail." Asked for clarification, she said that the US currently lacks jurisdiction over websites in other countries.&lt;ref name="hearingnotes" /&gt;

===Weakening of "safe harbor" protections===
The 1998 [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA) includes the [[Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act]], that provides a "safe harbor" for websites that host content. Under that provision, copyright owners who felt that a site was hosting infringing content are required to request the site to remove the infringing material within a certain amount of time.&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite news |author=Matthew Lasar |title=Google triumphant, beats back billion dollar Viacom lawsuit |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/06/google-beats-viacom-in-billion-dollar-lawsuit.ars |accessdate=November 7, 2011 |newspaper=Ars Technica |date=June 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dcma" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tech Industry Open Letter"&gt;{{cite web |title=Tech Industry Open Letter |url=http://politechbot.com/docs/sopa.google.facebook.twitter.letter.111511.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117210705/http://politechbot.com/docs/sopa.google.facebook.twitter.letter.111511.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=November 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; SOPA would bypass this "safe harbor" provision by placing the responsibility for detecting and policing infringement onto the site itself, and allowing judges to block access to websites "dedicated to theft of U.S. property".&lt;ref name="sf chronicle editorial"&gt;{{cite news |title=Stop Online Piracy Act would stop online innovation |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-11-02/business/30353433_1_sopa-craigslist-internet-service-providers |accessdate=November 7, 2011 |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |date=November 2, 2011 |author=James Temple }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to critics of the bill such as the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], the bill's wording is vague enough that a single complaint about a site could be enough to block it, with the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] resting on the site. A provision in the bill states that any site would be blocked that "is taking, or has taken deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of the use of the U.S.-directed site to carry out acts that constitute a violation." Critics have read this to mean that a site must actively monitor its content and identify violations to avoid blocking, rather than relying on others to notify it of such violations.&lt;ref name="What's On the Blacklist?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dangerously broad"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cdt.org/blogs/david-sohn/2710house-copyright-bill-casts-dangerously-broad-net |title=House Copyright Bill Casts Dangerously Broad Net |author=David Sohn |publisher=Center for Democracy and Technology |date=October 27, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Law professor Jason Mazzone wrote, "Damages are also not available to the site owner unless a claimant 'knowingly materially' misrepresented that the law covers the targeted site, a difficult legal test to meet. The owner of the site can issue a counter-notice to restore payment processing and advertising, but services need not comply with the counter-notice."&lt;ref name="mazzone"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/the-privatization-of-copyright-lawmaking-111112/ |title=The Privatization of Copyright Lawmaking |author=Jason Mazzone |date=November 12, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodlatte stated, "We're open to working with them on language to narrow [the bill's provisions], but I think it is unrealistic to think we're going to continue to rely on the DMCA notice-and-takedown provision. Anybody who is involved in providing services on the Internet would be expected to do some things. But we are very open to tweaking the language to ensure we don't impose extraordinary burdens on legitimate companies as long as they aren't the primary purveyors [of pirated content]."&lt;ref name="hill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Downes" /&gt;

O'Leary submitted written testimony in favor of the bill that expressed guarded support of current DMCA provisions. "Where these sites are legitimate and make good faith efforts to respond to our requests, this model works with varying degrees of effectiveness," O'Leary wrote. "It does not, however, always work quickly, and it is not perfect, but it works."&lt;ref name="CNET-Hollywood" /&gt;

===Web-related businesses===
An analysis in the information technology magazine ''[[eWeek]]'' stated, "The language of SOPA is so broad, the rules so unconnected to the reality of Internet technology and the penalties so disconnected from the alleged crimes that this bill could effectively kill e-commerce or even normal Internet use. The bill also has grave implications for existing U.S., foreign and international laws and is sure to spend decades in court challenges."&lt;ref name="EWeek" /&gt;

Art Bordsky of advocacy group [[Public Knowledge]] similarly stated, "The definitions written in the bill are so broad that any US consumer who uses a website overseas immediately gives the US jurisdiction the power to take action against it potentially."&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;

On October 28, 2011, the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] called the bill a "massive piece of job-killing Internet regulation," and said, "This bill cannot be fixed; it must be killed."&lt;ref name="SOPA: Hollywood Finally Gets A Chance to Break the Internet" /&gt;

Gary Shapiro, CEO of the [[Consumer Electronics Association]], spoke out strongly against the bill, stating, "The bill attempts a radical restructuring of the laws governing the Internet", and that "It would undo the legal, safe harbors that have allowed a world-leading Internet industry to flourish over the last decade. It would expose legitimate American businesses and innovators to broad and open-ended liability. The result will be more lawsuits, decreased venture capital investment, and fewer new jobs."&lt;ref name="At Web censorship hearing, Congress guns for 'pro-pirate' Google" /&gt;

[[Lukas Biewald]], founder of [[CrowdFlower]], stated, "It'll have a stifling effect on venture capital... No one would invest because of the legal liability."&lt;ref name="Why Start-ups Are Scared of SOPA" /&gt;

[[Booz &amp; Company]] on November 16 published a Google-funded study finding that almost all of the 200 [[venture capital]]ists and [[angel investor]]s interviewed would stop funding [[digital media]] intermediaries if the bill became law. More than 80 percent said they would rather invest in a risky, weak economy with the current laws than a strong economy with the proposed law in effect. If legal ambiguities were removed and good faith provisions in place, investing would increase by nearly 115 percent.&lt;ref name="booz" /&gt;

As reported by [[David Carr (journalist)|David Carr]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' in an article critical of SOPA and PIPA, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other companies sent a joint letter to Congress, stating "We support the bills' stated goals&amp;nbsp;– providing additional enforcement tools to combat foreign 'rogue' Web sites that are dedicated to copyright infringement or counterfeiting. However, the bills as drafted would expose law-abiding U.S. Internet and technology companies to new uncertain liabilities, private rights of action and technology mandates that would require monitoring of Web sites. We are concerned that these measures pose a serious risk to our industry's continued track record of innovation and job creation, as well as to our nation's cybersecurity."&lt;ref name="NYT-20120101" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20111116"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[AOL]], [[eBay]], Facebook, [[Google]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Mozilla]], Twitter, [[Yahoo]], [[Zynga]] |title=We stand together to protect innovation |url=http://boingboing.net/2011/11/16/internet-giants-place-full-pag.html |date=November 16, 2011 |publisher=[[NY Times]] and [[BoingBoing]] |accessdate=January 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith responded, saying, the article "unfairly criticizes the Stop Online Piracy Act", and, "does not point to any language in the bill to back up the claims. SOPA targets only foreign Web sites that are primarily dedicated to illegal and infringing activity. Domestic Web sites, like blogs, are not covered by this legislation." Smith also said that Carr incorrectly framed the debate as between the entertainment industry and high-tech companies, noting support by more than "120 groups and associations across diverse industries, including the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]]".&lt;ref name="NYT-20120109"&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Lamar |title=Fighting Online Piracy (Letter) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/opinion/fighting-online-piracy.html |date=January 9, 2012 |work=New York Times |accessdate=January 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Users uploading illegal content===
Lateef Mtima, director of the Institute for Intellectual Property and Social Justice at [[Howard University School of Law]], expressed concern that users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable themselves, saying, "Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the bill is that the conduct it would criminalize is so poorly defined. While on its face the bill seems to attempt to distinguish between commercial and non-commercial conduct, purportedly criminalizing the former and permitting the latter, in actuality the bill not only fails to accomplish this but, because of its lack of concrete definitions, it potentially criminalizes conduct that is currently permitted under the law."&lt;ref name="internet giants"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greeleygazette.com/press/?p=11974 |title=Internet giants oppose bill that could make posting online videos a crime |author=Jack Minor |work=Greely Gazette |date=November 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An aide to Rep. Smith said, "This bill does not make it a felony for a person to post a video on YouTube of their children singing to a copyrighted song. The bill specifically targets websites dedicated to illegal or infringing activity. Sites that host user content—like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter—have nothing to be concerned about under this legislation."&lt;ref name="internet giants" /&gt;

===Internal networks===
A paper by the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]] claimed that the bill "targets an entire website even if only a small portion hosts or links to some infringing content." &lt;ref name="dcma" /&gt;

According to A. M. Reilly of ''Industry Leaders Magazine'', under SOPA, culpability for distributing copyright material is extended to those who aid the initial poster of the material. For companies that use [[virtual private network]]s (VPN) to create a network that appears to be internal but is spread across various offices and employees' homes, any of these offsite locations that initiate sharing of copyright material could put the entire VPN and hosting company at risk of violation.&lt;ref name="The Stop Online Piracy Act: What Industry Leaders Can Do About It" /&gt;

Answering similar criticism in a [[CNET]] editorial, [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) head, Cary Sherman wrote, "Actually, it's quite the opposite. By focusing on specific sites rather than entire domains, action can be targeted against only the illegal subdomain or Internet protocol address rather than taking action against the entire domain."&lt;ref name="RIAA chief"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-57320417-93/riaa-chief-copyright-bills-wont-kill-the-internet/ |title=RIAA chief: Copyright bills won't kill the Internet |author=Cary Sherman |date=November 8, 2011 |accessdate=November 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on web-browsing software==
The Electronic Frontier Foundation expressed concern that free and open source software ([[FLOSS]]) projects found to be aiding [[online piracy]] could experience serious problems under SOPA.&lt;ref name="waylay FLOSS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itworld.com/security/223845/piracy-bill-could-waylay-floss-projects |title=Piracy bill could waylay FLOSS projects: If enacted, the SOPA bill in the U.S. House would target software vendors |author=Brian Proffitt |publisher=IT World |date=November 14, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Of special concern was the web browser [[Firefox]],&lt;ref name="eff" /&gt; which has an optional extension, [[MAFIAAFire Redirector]], that redirects users to a new location for domains that were seized by the U.S. government.&lt;ref name="Mozilla stirs netizens against US anti-piracy law: Dancing cats take-down threat" /&gt; In May 2011, Mozilla refused a request by the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] to remove MAFIAAFire from its website, questioning whether the software had ever been declared illegal.&lt;ref name="Feds Demand Firefox Remove Add-On That Redirects Seized Domains" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Questions to Department of Homeland Security April 19, 2011" /&gt;

==Potential effectiveness==
Edward J. Black, president and CEO of the [[Computer &amp; Communications Industry Association]], wrote in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'' that "Ironically, it would do little to stop actual pirate websites, which could simply reappear hours later under a different name, if their numeric [[web address]]es aren't public even sooner. Anyone who knows or has that web address would still be able to reach the offending website."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/edward-j-black/stop-online-piracy-act-vote_b_1145949.html |title=Internet Users, Free Speech Experts, Petition Against SOPA |author=Edward J. Black |work=Huffington Post |date=December 13, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in the ''[[San Jose Mercury-News]]'' stated, "Imagine the resources required to parse through the millions of Google and Facebook offerings every day looking for pirates who, if found, can just toss up another site in no time."&lt;ref name="congress should kill"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/opinion/ci_19369009 |title=Mercury News editorial: Congress should kill online piracy bill |date=November 19, 2011 |publisher=San Jose Mercury-News |accessdate=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Palfrey of the Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society commented, "DNS filtering is by necessity either overbroad or underbroad; it either blocks too much or too little. Content on the Internet changes its place and nature rapidly, and DNS filtering is ineffective when it comes to keeping up with it."&lt;ref name="palfrey" /&gt;

SOPA has largely been declared unconstitutional by the majority of Internet users. However, there are potential positive effects that could arise from passing the bill. A great number of jobs and industries are dependent on intellectual property, and many people could benefit from better control and enforcement of their IP rights. The bill is supported by many media and film production companies, as well as renowned brand names like Nike who could see great financial benefits from having their copyrighted materials better protected. The implementation of SOPA or a similar policy could even potentially turn stock price declines of companies like Zynga and Netflix around. Producers of Internet content would benefit from SOPA in that it makes targeting copyright violators easier and less costly. SOPA also encourages ISPs and website owners to be proactive and make sure that their sites, products, and services are not engaging in or facilitating high levels of copyright infringement – i.e., that their success does not depend on violating the rights of those who hold copyrighted material. SOPA may also be beneficial for preventing abuse of safe harbors. Some provisions within the bill would allow the US Attorney General to completely prohibit US internet users and servers from conducting business with sites that infringe upon IP rights, incentivizing careful self-monitoring. It essentially aims to encourage safer transactions and fair returns to the creators and owners of valuable IP. Those who do comply to IP legislation are currently at a competitive disadvantage, but bills like SOPA can reduce this disadvantage particularly against foreign sites.{{Lopsided|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vieira|first=George|title=Why Most Investors Should Support SOPA|url=http://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/12/01/2270436/why-most-investors-should-support-sopa|date=January 18, 2012|accessdate=31 October 2012}}{{Self-published source|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical issues==

===Deep-packet inspection and privacy===
According to Markham Erickson, head of NetCoalition, which opposes SOPA, the section of the bill that would allow judges to order [[internet service provider]]s to block access to infringing websites to customers located in the United States would also allow the checking of those customers' [[IP address]], a method known as [[IP address blocking]]. Erickson has expressed concerns that such an order might require those providers to engage in "[[deep packet inspection]]," which involves analyzing all of the content being transmitted to and from the user, raising new privacy concerns.&lt;ref name="SOPA's latest threat"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57328045-281/sopas-latest-threat-ip-blocking-privacy-busting-packet-inspection/ |title=SOPA's latest threat: IP blocking, privacy-busting packet inspection |author=Declan McCullagh |date=November 18, 2011 |work=Privacy Inc |publisher=CNET |accessdate=November 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dangerous Bill Would Threaten Legitimate Websites"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/11/dangerous-bill-would-threaten-legitimate-websites/248619/ |title=Dangerous Bill Would Threaten Legitimate Websites |author1=David Sohn  |author2=Andrew McDiarmid  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=November 17, 2011 |work=The Atlantic |accessdate=November 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy analysts for [[New America Foundation]] say this legislation would "instigate a data obfuscation arms race" whereby by increasingly invasive practices would be required to monitor users' web traffic resulting in a "counterproductive cat-and-mouse game of censorship and circumvention [that] would drive savvy scofflaws to darknets while increasing surveillance of less technically proficient Internet users".&lt;ref name="The Internet's Intolerable Acts"/&gt;

===Domain Name System===
The [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) servers, sometimes likened to a [[telephone directory]], translate browser requests for domain names into the [[IP address]] assigned to that computer or network. The original bill requires these servers to stop referring requests for infringing domains to their assigned IP addresses. DNS is robust by design against failure and requires that a lack of response is met by inquiries to other DNS servers.&lt;ref name="baker-Dec14"&gt;{{cite web|title=SOPA-rope-a-dopa|url=http://www.skatingonstilts.com/skating-on-stilts/2011/12/the-sopa-rope-a-dope.html|publisher=[[Stewart Baker]]|accessdate=January 14, 2012|date=December 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Lee, CEO of [[ESET]] North America, objected that since the bill would require internet service providers to filter DNS queries for the sites, this would undermine the integrity of the Domain Name System.&lt;ref name="ESET Open Letter" /&gt;

According to [[David Ulevitch]], the San Francisco-based head of [[OpenDNS]], the passage of SOPA could cause Americans to switch to DNS providers located in other countries who offer encrypted links, and may cause U.S. providers, such as OpenDNS itself, to move to other countries, such as the [[Cayman Islands]].&lt;ref name="OpenDNS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57327341-281/opendns-sopa-will-be-extremely-disruptive-to-the-internet/ |title=OpenDNS: SOPA will be 'extremely disruptive' to the Internet |author=Declan McCullagh |work=Privacy Inc. |publisher=CNET  |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, an anonymous [[top-level domain]], [[.bit]], was launched outside of [[ICANN]] control, as a response to the perceived threat from SOPA, although its effectiveness (as well as the effectiveness of other [[alternative DNS root]]s) remains unknown.&lt;ref name="dimnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/11/anonymous-bit-dimnet-tries-to-be-a-hedge-against-dns-censorship.ars |title=Anonymous "dimnet" tries to create hedge against DNS censorship |author=Sean Gallagher |publisher=Ars Technica |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2012, House sponsor Lamar Smith announced that provisions related to DNS redirection would be pulled from the bill.&lt;ref name="ArsTechnica Jan13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Lamar |title=Smith To Remove DNS Blocking from SOPA |publisher=Congressman Lamar Smith |date=January 13, 2012 |url=http://fightonlinetheft.com/voices-of-support/labor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105162511/http://fightonlinetheft.com/voices-of-support/labor |archivedate=2012-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wired-20120112a"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kravets |first=David |title=Rep.

===Internet security===
A [[white paper]] by several internet security experts, including [[Steve Crocker]] and [[Dan Kaminsky]], wrote, "From an operational standpoint, a resolution failure from a nameserver subject to a court order and from a hacked nameserver would be indistinguishable. Users running secure applications need to distinguish between policy-based failures and failures caused, for example, by the presence of an attack or a hostile network, or else [[downgrade attack]]s would likely be prolific."&lt;ref name="Whitepaper1" /&gt;

===Domain Name System Security Extensions===
[[Stewart Baker]], former first Assistant Secretary for Policy at the Department of Homeland Security and former [[General Counsel]] of the [[National Security Agency]], stated that SOPA would do "great damage to Internet security"&lt;ref name="baker-Dec14" /&gt; by undermining  [[Domain Name System Security Extensions]] (DNSSEC), a proposed security upgrade for DNS, since a [[Web browser|browser]] must treat all redirects the same, and must continue to search until it finds a DNS server (possibly overseas) providing untampered results.&lt;ref name="baker-Dec14" /&gt; On December 14, 2011 he wrote that SOPA was "badly in need of a knockout punch"&lt;ref name="baker-Dec14" /&gt; due to its impact on security and DNS:

{{quote|from the &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Attorney General]'s point of view, the browser's efforts to find an authoritative DNS server will look like a deliberate effort to evade his blocking order. The latest version of SOPA will feed that view.  It allows the AG to sue "any entity that knowingly and willfully provides ... a product ... designed by such entity or by another in concert with such entity for the circumvention or bypassing of" the AG's blocking orders. It's hard to escape the conclusion that this provision is aimed squarely at the browser companies. Browsers implementing DNSSEC will have to circumvent and bypass criminal blocking, and in the process, they will also circumvent and bypass SOPA orders.&lt;ref name="baker-Dec14" /&gt;}}

DNSSEC is a set of protocols developed by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) for ensuring internet security. A white paper by the [[Brookings Institution]] noted, "The DNS system is based on trust", adding that DNSSEC was developed to prevent malicious redirection of DNS traffic, and that "other forms of redirection will break the assurances from this security tool".&lt;ref name="Cybersecurity in the Balance"&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.brookings.edu/papers/2011/1115_cybersecurity_friedman.aspx |title=Cybersecurity in the Balance:Weighing the Risks of the PROTECT IP Act and the Stop Online Piracy Act |author=Allan A.

On November 17, [[Sandia National Laboratories]], a research agency of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]], released a technical assessment of the DNS filtering provisions in the House and Senate bills, in response to Representative [[Zoe Lofgren|Zoe Lofgren's]] (D-CA) request. The assessment stated that the proposed DNS filtering would be unlikely to be effective, would negatively impact internet security, and would delay full implementation of DNSSEC.&lt;ref name="Lofgren Releases Letter"&gt;{{cite press release |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028002750/http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=670&amp;Itemid=130 |url=http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=670&amp;Itemid=130 |archivedate=October 28, 2013 |title=Lofgren Releases Sandia Labs Letter on SOPA |publisher=US House of Representatives |date=November 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard M.

On November 18, [[United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies|House Cybersecurity Subcommittee]] chair [[Dan Lungren]] stated that he had "very serious concerns" about SOPA's impact on DNSSEC, adding, "we don't have enough information, and if this is a serious problem as was suggested by some of the technical experts that got in touch with me, we have to address it".&lt;ref name="new flap"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-57326228-281/new-flap-over-sopa-copyright-bill-anti- |title=Lungren Wants Hearing On SOPA'S Cyber Impact |author=Tony Romm |publisher=Politico |date=November 18, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transparency in enforcement==
[[Brooklyn Law School]] professor Jason Mazzone warned, "Much of what will happen under SOPA will occur out of the public eye and without the possibility of holding anyone accountable. For when copyright law is made and enforced privately, it is hard for the public to know the shape that the law takes and harder still to complain about its operation."&lt;ref name="mazzone" /&gt;

==Supporters==

===Legislators===
{{Main |List of US Congresspersons who support or oppose SOPA/PIPA}}
The Stop Online Piracy Act was introduced by Representative [[Lamar S.

===Companies and organizations===
{{Main |List of organizations with official stances on the SOPA and PIPA}}
The legislation has broad support from organizations that rely on copyright, including the [[Motion Picture Association of America]], the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], [[Entertainment Software Association]], [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan US]], [[Viacom]], and various other companies and unions in the cable, movie, and music industries. Supporters also include trademark-dependent companies such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[L'Oréal]], and [[Acushnet Company]].&lt;ref name="politico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theglobalipcenter" /&gt;

Both the AFL–CIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support H.R. 3261, and many trade unions and industry groups large and small, have also publicly praised the legislation. In a joint statement, the [[American Federation of Musicians]] (AFM), [[American Federation of Television and Radio Artists]] (AFTRA), [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA), International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, Its Territories and Canada (IATSE), International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), and [[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG) all showed support for SOPA. Smaller trade organizations, such as A2IM, which represents independent musicians, have also backed the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Joint Statement from SAG, AFM, AFTRA, DGA, IATSE and IBT Regarding Stop Online Piracy Act (HR 3261) |publisher=[[Screen Actors Guild]] |date=2011-10-26 |url= http://www.sag.org/joint-statement-sag-afm-aftra-dga-iatse-and-ibt-regarding-stop-online-piracy-act-hr-3261 |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, former [[Bill Clinton]] press secretary [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]] and former [[George W. Bush]] advisor [[Mark McKinnon]], business partners in Public Strategies, Inc., started a campaign which echoed McCurry's earlier work in the [[network neutrality]] legislative fight. McCurry represented SOPA/PIPA in ''Politico'' as a way to combat theft online,&lt;ref&gt;Mike McCurry, [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/56984.html "Congress must combat online theft"], ''Politico'' opinion piece, June 14, 2011.

On September 22, 2011, a letter signed by over 350 businesses and organizations—including [[NBCUniversal]], [[Pfizer]], [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Revlon]], [[NBA]], and [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan US]]—was sent to Congress encouraging the passage of the legislation.&lt;ref name="politico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theglobalipcenter" /&gt; Fightonlinetheft.com, a website of The Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy (a project of the United States Chamber of Commerce [[Global Intellectual Property Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecacp.com/ |title=Global Intellectual Property Center }}&lt;/ref&gt;) cites a long list of supporters including these and the [[Fraternal Order of Police]], the [[National Governors Association]], the [[U.S. Conference of Mayors]], the [[National Association of Attorneys General]], the [[Better Business Bureau]], and the [[National Consumers League]].&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fightonlinetheft.com/voices-of-support/labor |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120105162511/http://fightonlinetheft.com/voices-of-support/labor |archivedate=2012-01-05 |title=Voices of support |work=fightonlinetheft.com |accessdate=December 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 22 the CEO of the [[Business Software Alliance]] (BSA) said, "valid and important questions have been raised about the bill." He said that definitions and remedies needed to be tightened and narrowed, but "BSA stands ready to work with Chairman Smith and his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to resolve these issues".&lt;ref name="Tech coalition backs off SOPA support" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.bsa.org/2011/11/21/sopa-needs-work-to-address-innovation-considerations/ SOPA Needs Work to Address Innovation Considerations]; Business Software Alliance; November 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, the [[Information Technology and Innovation Foundation]], a non-partisan non-profit, published an article that blasted critics of SOPA and defended the bill. The report called opponents' claims about DNS filtering "inaccurate," their warnings against censorship as "unfounded" and recommended that the legislation be revised and passed into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Castro |first=Daniel |title=PIPA/SOPA: Responding to Critics and Finding a Path Forward |publisher=The Information Technology &amp;amp; Innovation Foundation |date=2011-12-05 |url=http://www.itif.org/publications/pipasopa-responding-critics-and-finding-path-forward |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parness Biography]; Robins, Kaplan, Miller &amp; Ciresi Profiles; 19 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; has reviewed the bill, stating in a legal analysis that "There's a court involved here." In regards to "safe harbors," he stated the safe harbor provisions created by the DMCA in 1998 would still apply. "I think the proponents of the bill would say, what we're looking at today is a very different kind of Internet. The fact that the courts have said that entities like YouTube can be passive when it comes to copyright infringement, and just wait for notices rather than having to take any affirmative action, is also frustrating to them", he said. Regarding censorship concerns, he explained that none of the criminal copyright statutes in the bill were new, and therefore, "if there was a risk of abuse, that risk has always been there. And I have confidence in the structure of our court system, that the prosecutors and the courts are held to certain standards that should not allow a statute such as this to be manipulated in that way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/11/legal-analysis-of-sopa-protect.php Legal Analysis of SOPA / PROTECT-IP: No, It's Not Censorship]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}; ReadWrite; November 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyright violations have never been protected by the First Amendment and have been routinely punished wherever they occur; including the Internet.

On December 15, 2011, a second hearing was scheduled to amend and vote on SOPA. Many opponents remained firm even after Smith proposed a 71-page amendment to the bill to address concerns. NetCoalition, which works with Google, Twitter, eBay, and Facebook, appreciated that Smith was listening, but says it nonetheless could not support the amendment. Issa stated that Smith's amendment, "retains the fundamental flaws of its predecessor by blocking Americans' ability to access websites, imposing costly regulation on Web companies and giving [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[Eric Holder]]'s Department of Justice broad new powers to police the Internet".&lt;ref name="Groups Still Oppose SOPA After Proposed Amendment" /&gt;

In January 2012, novelist, screenwriter and comics writer [[Peter David]] directed his ire at the intellectual property pirates whose activities he felt provoked the creation of SOPA. While expressing opposition to SOPA because of his view that the then-current language of the bill would go too far in its restriction of free expression, and would probably be scaled down, David argued that content pirates, such as the websites that had posted his novels online in their entirety for free downloads, as well as users who supported or took advantage of these activities, could have prevented SOPA by respecting copyright laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[David, Peter]]|url=http://www.peterdavid.net/index.php/2012/01/17/where-i-stand-on-sopa/|title=Where I stand on SOPA|publisher=peterdavid.net |date=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty one artists signed an open letter to Congress urging them to exercise extreme caution, including Comedian [[Aziz Ansari]], [[The Lonely Island]] music parody band, [[MGMT]], [[OK Go]], [[Jason Mraz]] and [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The letter reads, "As creative professionals, we experience copyright infringement on a very personal level. Commercial piracy is deeply unfair and pervasive leaks of unreleased films and music regularly interfere with the integrity of our creations. We are grateful for the measures policymakers have enacted to protect our works. [...] We fear that the broad new enforcement powers provided under SOPA and PIPA could be easily abused against legitimate services like those upon which we depend. These bills would allow entire websites to be blocked without due process, causing collateral damage to the legitimate users of the same services - artists and creators like us who would be censored as a result."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SOPA: An open letter to Washington|url=http://www.stopthewall.us/artists/|publisher=Stop The Wall|accessdate=January 21, 2012|date=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] also shut down his websites during the week of protest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stars Sign Anti-Piracy Laws Petition|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news/stars-sign-anti-piracy-laws-petition_1285379|work=[[Contact Music]]|accessdate=January 21, 2012|date=19 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an [[NYT]] report (February 8, 2012), Art Brodsky of [[Public Knowledge]] said, "The movie business is fond of throwing out numbers about how many millions of dollars are at risk and how many thousands of jobs are lost ... We don't think it correlates to the state of the industry."  The report also noted that "some in the internet world, including [[Tim O'Reilly]], ... go so far as to question whether illegitimate downloading and sharing is such a bad thing. In fact, some say that it could even be a boon to artists and other creators."  Tim O'Reilly is quoted as saying, "The losses due to piracy are far outweighed by the benefits of the free flow of information, which makes the world richer, and develops new markets for legitimate content ... Most of the people who are downloading unauthorized copies of O'Reilly books would never have paid us for them anyway."&lt;ref name="NYT-20120208"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wortham |first1=Jenna |last2=Chozick |first2=Amy |title=The Piracy Problem: How Broad? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/09/technology/in-piracy-debate-deciding-if-the-sky-is-falling.html |date=February 8, 2012 |publisher=[[NY Times]] |accessdate=February 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vice-President of the European Commission]] and [[European Commissioner for Digital Agenda]] [[Neelie Kroes]] said she is "Glad [the] tide is turning on SOPA," explaining rather than having "bad legislation" there "should be safeguarding benefits of open net".

Google linked an online petition to its site, and says it collected more than 7 million signatures from the United States.&lt;ref name="g7m"&gt;{{cite news |last=Engleman |first=Eric |title=SOPA bill petition collects 7 million signatures, according to Google |agency=Bloomberg |publisher=Washington Post |date=2012-01-19 |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/google-says-7-million-signed-petition-against-anti-piracy-bills/2012/01/19/gIQAJ2MiBQ_story.html?tid=pm_business_pop |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120120082947/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/google-says-7-million-signed-petition-against-anti-piracy-bills/2012/01/19/gIQAJ2MiBQ_story.html?tid=pm_business_pop |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2012-01-20 |accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SOPA's sponsor in the House, Chairman Smith, called Wikipedia's blackout a "publicity stunt" saying: "It is ironic that a website dedicated to providing information is spreading misinformation about the Stop Online Piracy Act." Smith went on to insist that SOPA "will not harm Wikipedia, domestic blogs or social networking sites".&lt;ref&gt;Brendan Sasso (January 17, 2012), [http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/204629-gop-chairman-wikipedia-blackout-a-publicity-stunt "Sponsor of online piracy bill calls Wikipedia blackout a 'publicity stunt'"]  ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative history==
The [[House Judiciary Committee]] held hearings on November 16 and December 15, 2011. The Committee was scheduled to continue debate in January 2012,&lt;ref name="postpone" /&gt; but on January 17 Chairman Smith said that "Due to the Republican and Democratic retreats taking place over the next two weeks, [[Markup (legislation)|markup]] of the Stop Online Piracy Act is expected to resume in February."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/17/us-usa-internet-piracy-house-idUSTRE80G29K20120117 "House to take up anti-piracy bill in February"] [[Reuters]] January 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the wake of online protests held on January 18, 2012, Rep.

===November 16 House Judiciary Committee hearing===
At the House Judiciary Committee hearing, there was concern among some observers that the set of speakers who testified lacked technical expertise. Technology news site CNET reported "One by one, each witness—including a lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America—said they weren't qualified to discuss... DNSSEC."&lt;ref name="new flap" /&gt; Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at the [[Mercatus Center]], similarly said, "The techno-ignorance of Congress was on full display. Member after member admitted that they really didn't have any idea what impact SOPA's regulatory provisions would have on the DNS, online security, or much of anything else."&lt;ref name="techno-ignorance" /&gt;

Lofgren stated, "We have no technical expertise on this panel today." She also criticized the tone of the hearing, saying, "It hasn't generally been the policy of this committee to dismiss the views of those we are going to regulate. Impugning the motives of the critics instead of the substance is a mistake."&lt;ref name="House Holds One-Sided Hearing on Piracy Bill"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/house-holds-one-sided-hearing-piracy-bill-136575 |title=House Holds One-Sided Hearing on Piracy Bill |author=Katy Bachman |date=November 16, 2011 |publisher=Adweek |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lungren told Politico's ''Morning Tech'' that he had "very serious concerns" about SOPA's impact on DNSSEC, adding "we don't have enough information, and if this is a serious problem as was suggested by some of the technical experts that got in touch with me, we have to address it. I can't afford to let that go by without dealing with it."&lt;ref name="lungren wants"&gt;{{cite web |url= |title=Lungren Wants Hearing On SOPA'S Cyber Impact |author= Declan McCullagh |publisher=CNET |date=November 16, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary Shapiro, CEO of the [[Consumer Electronics Association]], stated, "The significant potential harms of this bill are reflected by the extraordinary coalition arrayed against it. Concerns about SOPA have been raised by [[Tea Party movement|Tea Partiers]], progressives, computer scientists, human rights advocates, venture capitalists, law professors, independent musicians, and many more. Unfortunately, these voices were not heard at today's hearing."&lt;ref name="At Web censorship hearing, Congress guns for 'pro-pirate' Google" /&gt;

An editorial in ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' wrote, "This is just another case of Congress doing the bidding of powerful lobbyists—in this case, Hollywood and the music industry, among others. It would be downright mundane if the legislation weren't so draconian and the rhetoric surrounding it weren't so transparently pandering."&lt;ref name="stacking the deck" /&gt;

===December 15 markup of the bill===
Since its introduction, a number of opponents to the bill have expressed concerns. The bill was presented for [[markup (legislation)|markup]] by the [[House Judiciary Committee]] on December&amp;nbsp;15.

An aide to Smith stated that "He is open to changes but only legitimate changes. Some site[s] are totally capable of filtering illegal content, but they won't and are instead profiting from the traffic of illegal content."&lt;ref name="He is open to changes" /&gt;

====Markup outcome====
After the first day of the hearing, more than 20 amendments had been rejected, including one by Darrell Issa which would have stripped provisions targeting search engines and Internet providers. ''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' reported that the 22–12 vote on the amendment could foreshadow strong support for the bill by the committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/246354/house_committee_appears_headed_toward_approving_sopa.html |title=House Committee Appears Headed Toward Approving SOPA |author=Grant Gross |publisher=PCWorld |date=December 16, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MPAA's continued efforts to enact SOPA principles==

The [[Sony Pictures Entertainment hack|2014 Sony Pictures hack]] revealed that the MPAA had continued its efforts to enact SOPA-like blocking principles since the bill died in Congress. The emails indicated that the MPAA was actively exploring new strategies to implement SOPA-like regulations, such as using the [[All Writs Act]] to "allow [the MPAA] to obtain court orders requiring site blocking without first having to sue and prove the target ISPs are liable for copyright infringement."&lt;ref name="Project-Goliath"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brandom |first=Russell|title=Project Goliath: Inside Hollywood's secret war against Google|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/12/7382287/project-goliath|date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The MPAA has also allied itself with [[National Association of Attorneys General]] president [[Jim Hood]], who supports SOPA principles and has stated that "Google's not a government… they don't owe anyone a First Amendment right… [i]f you're an illegal site, you ought to clean up your act, instead of Google making money off it."&lt;ref name ="HuffPo Attorneys General SOPA"&gt;{{cite news |last=Liebelson |first=Dana|title=How State Attorneys General May Help Hollywood Revive SOPA Anti-Piracy Efforts|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/16/attorneys-general-sopa_n_6330298.html|date=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 27, 2013, Hood sent a letter to Google outlining his grievances. It was later revealed that much of the letter was drafted by the law firm representing the MPAA.&lt;ref name="Hood Letter"&gt;{{cite news |title=Letter to Google From Mississippi's Attorney General|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/16/technology/attorney-general-letter-to-google.html?_r=0|date=December 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 2014, Hood issued a subpoena to Google for information about, among other items, its advertising partnerships and practices concerning illegal and sexual content.&lt;ref name="Hood Subpoena"&gt;{{cite news |title=Subpoena From Mississippi|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/12/17/technology/document-google-subpoena-from-mississippi.html|date=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google requested an injunction to quash the subpoena from the United States District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi, Northern Division.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17163">Television has a long history in [[Ukraine]], with regular [[television]] broadcasting started during the former [[USSR]] years in 1951. However the first ever TV broadcast took place on the 1st February 1939 in Kyiv. Since then TV broadcasting has expanded, particularly after the [[fall of Communism]] in 1989, and now there are many different channels and groups in the Ukrainian TV market.

== History ==
The first official broadcast took place in [[Kiev]] on 1 February 1939.&lt;ref name="television"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100820190441/http://1tv.com.ua/uk/about/history History of television in Ukraine]&lt;/ref&gt; It was 40 minutes long and showed the portrait of [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]].&lt;ref name="television"/&gt; After [[World War II]], on 6 November 1951, a Kyiv tele-centre made a debut with a ''live broadcasting'' of the patriotic movie "The Great Glow".&lt;ref name="television"/&gt; Next day the telecentre went on air again by broadcasting the solemn measures of celebrating the 34th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]].&lt;ref name="television"/&gt;

On 1 May 1952, a concert went on air (shot in the small and only pavilion of the telecentre known as "Studio B") of Ukrainian singers, soloists of the Kyiv [[Taras Shevchenko]] Opera Theater.&lt;ref name="television"/&gt; The anchorwoman of the concert was the Kyiv Telecentre's first announcer - [[Novela Separionova]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In 1953, the construction of the building of the Kyiv Telecentre on [[Khreshchatyk]] was completed,&lt;ref name="television"/&gt; right after the finishing of the [[Moscow]] and [[Leningrad]] Telecentres.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Regular programs started to go on air in 1956.&lt;ref name="television"/&gt; Until that year, the Telecentre went on air twice a day showing feature films or documentaries.&lt;ref name="television"/&gt; Live broadcasting was the only form of broadcasting.&lt;ref name="television"/&gt; Recording video became usual in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="television"/&gt;

The first regular national channel appeared on January 20, 1965 under the name UT-1 (Ukrainian television - 1, today - Pershyi National), while on March 6, 1972 a second channel, UT-2, was created.&lt;ref name="television"/&gt; In 1983, the new telecenter started to be built at the 42 Melnyk Street, which was opened after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="television"/&gt;

After the [[Orange Revolution]], Ukrainian television became more free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news&amp;#93;=30800 UKRAINIAN PARTIES SCRAMBLE FOR MEDIA, FOREIGN ALLIES, AHEAD OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTIONS], [[The Jamestown Foundation]] (August 17, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009 the National Council for Television and Radio Broadcasting claimed that "political pressure on mass media increased in recent times through amending laws and other normative acts to strengthen influence on mass media and regulatory bodies in this sphere".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/179018.html National TV Council Claims Harder Political Pressure On Mass Media] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120919144704/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/179018.html |date=2012-09-19 }}, [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (February 6, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2009, [[Ukrainian Prime Minister]], [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] refused to appear in Inter TV-programmes "until journalists, management and owners of the TV channel stop destroying the freedom of speech and until they remember the essence of their profession - honesty, objectiveness, and unbiased stand".&lt;ref name=owner&gt;[http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/175978.html Inter TV Channel Denies Businessman Firtash's Being Among Shareholders Of Company] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130208214921/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/175978.html |date=2013-02-08 }}, [[Ukrainian News Agency]] (January 23, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In early March 2014, [[Crimea]] removed Ukraine-based TV channels ahead of its [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian annexation]] [[Crimean referendum, 2014|referendum]].&lt;ref name=BBC140313/&gt; Later that month, the Ukrainian National Council for TV and Radio Broadcasting ordered measures against some Russian TV channels which were accused of broadcasting misleading information about Ukraine.&lt;ref name=BBC140312/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT140305/&gt; In February 2015 the law "On protection information television and radio space of Ukraine," banned the showing (on Ukrainian television) of "audiovisual works" that contain "popularization, propaganda, propaganda, any action of law enforcement agencies, armed forces, other military, military or security forces of an invader" was enacted.&lt;ref name="D5216lrgtout"/&gt; One year later Russian productions (on Ukrainian television) had decreased by 3 to 4 (times).&lt;ref name="D5216lrgtout"&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://m.day.kiev.ua/uk/news/050216-za-rik-pokaz-rosiyskogo-media-produktu-vpav-u-3-4-razy-nacrada During the year, showing Russian media product fell to 3-4 - National Council], [[Den (newspaper)|Den]] (5 February 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; 15 more Russian TV channels were banned in March 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/324105.html TV broadcasting council removes 15 more Russian TV channels from adaptation list] [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (12 February 2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine No.509 dated June 13, 2018, analogue broadcasting was disconnected on the territory of the Kirvograd region and Kyiv from July 31, 2018. The date of the switch-off of analogue broadcasting on the rest of Ukraine is August 31, 2018&lt;ref&gt;[http://zakon5.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/509-2018-%D0%BF/ed20180627/paran2#n2 Decree of CMU]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since September 1, 2018 for TV viewers of Ukraine only the following channels will be available:

* [[digital TV]]
* [[satellite TV]]
* cable television ([[Volia]], regional operators)
* online services and IPTV (the most famous ones are Divan TV, Sweet TV, [[MEGOGO]], [[Handy TV]])

== Digital television ==
In 2007 and 2008, experimental DVB-T broadcasts of few channels started in Kyiv and [[Odesa]]. Those turned out to be successful. Yet the [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] National Program is not approved by the government, thus the process is stuck. Because there are two versions of the program submitted: from the Ministry of Transport and Communications as well as from the State Committee of Television and Radio, there is no particular progress in 2008.

On 26 November 2008, the National Program of the Ministry was approved, but the final version and the public announcement of this fact is still on hold. Current version of the program does not take into notice any kind of Government financing, and the budget is to be private only, which will highly affect the TV industry and commercial broadcasters.

Besides there are 3rd parties, such as Television Industry Committee and National Association of Broadcasters which represent the communities of National and regional broadcasters respectively. Both organizations help the switchover not to affect the business of over 20 National and over 150 regional broadcasters.

The International Forum 'Digital Broadcasting in Ukraine' is the annual event that takes place in Kyiv, Ukraine. Its mission is to gather the most of international consultants and Ukrainian specialists to solve industry's problems in the DTT field. In 2008 the 2nd International Forum took place in Kyiv also. [[BBC]], [[Deloitte]] and the Ministry of Communications of Finland representatives share the vision of possible plan of DTT implementation in Ukraine, delivering the best experiences from UK, Finland, France and US. Still none was taken into notice yet. It is now confirmed&lt;ref&gt;http://mediasat.net.ua/content/news_all/5358/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://mediasat.net.ua/content/news_all/5626/&lt;/ref&gt; that Ukraine's national terrestrial TV network, which is scheduled to be launched in September 2011, will use the DVB-T2 standard for all four nationwide [[Free-to-air|FTA]] multiplexes, for both SD and HD broadcasts. Before settling for DVB-T2, Ukraine was testing both DVB-T/MPEG-2 and DVB-T/MPEG-4 options, and some experimental transmitters operating in those standards are still live.

== Other technologies ==
Commercial [[MMDS]] digital TV services work in Kyiv and some other cities.

DVB-C services delivering premium channels (in addition to standard analogue channels) launched in cable networks of [[Kiev]], [[Odesa]], [[Kremenchuk]], [[Poltava]], [[Donetsk]] and some other cities.

== Criticism ==
{{main|Boycott Russian Films#Investigation}}
Society criticise Ukrainian television, mainly a number of central channels for the presence of a big amount of Russian origin content. According to calculations of "[[Boycott Russian Films]]" activists, in September 2014 amount of Russian TV-production on the leading Ukrainian channels ("[[Ukrayina (TV channel)|Ukrayina]]", "[[ICTV (Ukraine)|ICTV]]", "NTN", "[[Novyi Kanal]]", "[[Inter (TV channel)|Inter]]", "[[STB (TV channel)|STB]]", "[[2+2 (TV channel)|2+2]]", "[[TET (TV channel)|TET]]", "K1", "[[1+1 (channel)|1+1]]") took approximately 40%. In October and December activists noticed increasing of amounts of Russian content on this channels.

Also activists criticise Ukrainian channels for their language policy. In October 2014 activists have published statistics of content's language of Ukrainian channels. According to it there are 29% of completely [[Ukrainian language]] content, 39.3% of completely [[Russian language]] content, 23.5% of Russian language content with Ukrainian subtitles and 8.2% of bilingual content (both Ukrainian and Russian).

'''"The Simpsons Guy"''' is the first episode of the [[Family Guy (season 13)|thirteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[Family Guy]]'', and the 232nd overall episode. "The Simpsons Guy" is a 44-minute-long [[fictional crossover|crossover]] with ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and was written by [[Patrick Meighan (writer)|Patrick Meighan]] and directed by [[Peter Shin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman |first=Miriam |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/videos/take-an-early-peek-at-the-simpsons-family-guy-crossover-episode-20140727 |title=Take an Early Peek at the 'Simpsons'-'Family Guy' Crossover Episode |work=Rolling Stone |date=2014-07-27 |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originally aired in the United States on September 28, 2014, on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], where both ''The Simpsons'' and ''Family Guy'' have aired since their respective debuts.

In the episode, [[Griffin family|the Griffins]] stay with [[Simpson family|the Simpsons]] after the former family's car is stolen just outside [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. After the Griffins get their car back, [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] is taken to court as a representative of the Pawtucket Patriot brewery, his employer, when it is discovered that its ale is an unauthorized copy of [[Duff Beer]].

The idea for a crossover episode was suggested by ''Family Guy'' executive producer and former ''Simpsons'' writer [[Richard Appel]], and the episode was announced by Fox in July 2013. Five of the six main members of the voice cast of ''The Simpsons''—the exception being [[Harry Shearer]]—voiced their characters in the episode. "The Simpsons Guy" was met with a mixed reception by critics, who had differing opinions on how well the two shows combined.

==Plot==
[[Peter Griffin|Peter]] creates a controversial comic panel for the Quahog newspaper called "For Pete's Sake,"  which angers local women for its sexist humor.  Peter drives the [[Griffin family]] out of Quahog to escape the townspeople's ire. When they stop at a gas station, their car is stolen, leaving them stranded outside [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. At the [[Kwik-E-Mart]], [[Homer Simpson]] introduces himself to the Griffins and takes them to the Springfield Police Department, where they are turned away by [[Chief Wiggum]].

The [[Simpson family]] puts up the [[Griffin family]] in their [[The Simpsons house|home]] until things improve. [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] shows [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] his [[slingshot]], and teaches him how to skateboard, and they become good friends. When [[Nelson Muntz]] bullies Bart, Stewie retaliates by kidnapping and torturing Nelson.  Meanwhile, [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] tries to find a talent that [[Meg Griffin|Meg]] has. When she finds that Meg is a natural at the [[saxophone]], she downplays the talent out of jealousy. [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] take the Simpsons' dog, [[Santa's Little Helper]], for a walk. Brian tries to teach Santa's Little Helper independence, but the latter runs off when freed. [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] notices Santa's Little Helper is missing, and Chris and Brian fake his presence until he eventually returns. Homer and Peter try different plans to find Peter's car, each one backfiring, until they discover it in the possession of [[Hans Moleman]] when he accidentally runs Peter over.

The men celebrate at [[Moe Szyslak|Moe's Tavern]], but relationships sour when Peter tries to introduce Homer to Pawtucket Patriot ale. The drink is revealed to be an imitation of [[Duff Beer]] with a new label. This results in Duff, represented by the [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#Blue Haired Lawyer| Blue Haired Lawyer]], filing a lawsuit against Pawtucket Brewery for [[patent infringement]], with Peter forced to defend the brewery to save [[Family Guy#Setting|Quahog]]. [[Fred Flintstone]] is the [[judge]] who presides over the case. During the trial, similar characters from both shows interact with each other including both shows' versions of [[James Woods]]. Fred rules in favor of Duff Beer, but declares that both Pawtucket Patriot Ale and Duff Beer are imitations of his own favorite beer [[Budweiser|Bud Rock]].

The Griffins prepare to return to Quahog, where Peter faces the prospect of finding a new job. Lisa gives Meg her saxophone, but Peter throws it away, claiming there is no room for any more luggage. Stewie points out that he took revenge on not just Nelson, but all of Bart's enemies: Nelson, [[Jimbo Jones]], [[Principal Skinner]], [[Sideshow Bob]], and (for the sake of making a scatological pun) Apu. Bart is sickened by Stewie's violent tendencies and ends their friendship. Homer tries to explain his actions, but Peter reacts angrily and the two fight (à la fighting between Peter and [[List of Family Guy characters#The Giant Chicken|The Giant Chicken]]) through Springfield. The pair gain superpowers when they hit the [[Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], then end up in [[Kang and Kodos]]' spaceship, where they lose their powers before landing in Springfield Gorge. Peter and Homer stop fighting and admit their respect and admiration for each other while agreeing to stay away in the future. Returning home, the Griffins find that the heat from Peter's comic has died down and the Pawtucket Brewery is safe when Lois doubts that the inhabitants of Springfield will visit Quahog to enforce the ruling. Stewie tries to pretend he is over Bart, but goes to his room crying while writing "I will not think about Bart anymore" [[The Simpsons opening sequence|several times on a chalkboard]].

==Production==

===Development===
[[File:Simpsons voice actors.jpg|thumb|Five of the six main voice actors from ''[[The Simpsons]]'' reprised their roles in this episode. From left to right: [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]], [[Dan Castellaneta]] and [[Julie Kavner]]. [[Hank Azaria]] is not pictured.]]
The idea of a crossover with ''The Simpsons'' was first suggested while the thirteenth season of ''Family Guy'' was being planned out. Executive producer [[Richard Appel]] received ''Family Guy'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s approval and input after brainstorming ideas. Appel then asked for permission from ''Simpsons'' executive producers [[Matt Groening]], [[James L. Brooks]] and [[Al Jean]] to use their characters. This was approved; Appel was previously a writer-producer on ''The Simpsons'' for four seasons, and retained his former colleagues' trust.&lt;ref name="EWSimpsonsGuy"/&gt; [[Dan Castellaneta]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Nancy Cartwright]], [[Yeardley Smith]] and [[Hank Azaria]] guest star as their ''Simpsons'' characters, but [[Harry Shearer]], the final main cast member of ''The Simpsons'', was unavailable. Asked how he felt about the crossover, Shearer replied, "Matter and anti-matter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/08/08/harry_shearer_on_revolutionizing_comedy_and_why_nixon_was_the_last_great_character_of_our_time/|title=Legendary comic Harry Shearer: Nixon was the last great tragicomic character of our time|last=Gupta|first=Prachi|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=August 8, 2014|accessdate=March 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Family Guy'' writers pitched several storylines for the crossover, including one in which the Griffins stay with [[Lenny and Carl]] and never meet the Simpsons, and another one in which their whole series is revealed to be a figment of [[Ralph Wiggum]]'s imagination.&lt;ref name="EWSimpsonsGuy"/&gt; When the final script was read to the show's staff, Appel expressed his concern about the length of the episode. MacFarlane said that Fox would be happy to make it an hour long. Supervising director [[Peter Shin]], a former layout artist on ''The Simpsons'', spent time adjusting the Griffins to the specifications of Springfield—changes included dimming the whites of their eyeballs so they would not look too bright—and animating the eight-minute fight between Peter and Homer. Appel said there are no plans to do a sequel to the episode, but stated that "by season 43 of ''The Simpsons'' and season 27 of ''Family Guy'', someone who's looking at a blank board is going to say, 'Well, the Griffins went to Springfield... what if the Simpsons went to Quahog?' And more heads will explode at Fox."&lt;ref name="EWSimpsonsGuy"/&gt;

===Announcement and promotion===
The episode was first announced by Fox in July 2013 to premiere in the fall of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2013/07/18/family-guy-simpsons-episode-crossover-springfield/|title=Scoop: Family Guy Crossover Will Introduce the Griffins to The Simpsons in Fall 2014!|work=TVLine|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, the network presented two clips from the episode at their annual [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2014/05/12/simpsons-family-guy-crossover-episode-september-fox-upfront/|title='The Simpsons' and 'Family Guy' Crossover Episode Is Nearly Here|date=12 May 2014|work=Mashable|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' about the episode, MacFarlane stated that the key to a good crossover episode is "really about the character interaction. People want to see Peter interact with Homer. They want to see Bart interact with Stewie. In a way, the story in a crossover episode, while it has to be there, is never quite as important as how the characters interact with each other."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2014/09/03/this-weeks-cover-inside-the-simpsons-family-guy-crossover/|title=This week's cover: Inside the 'Simpsons'-'Family Guy' crossover|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' creator Groening added, "In this case, it's two really vivid shows and seeing what they can do together. You want to see them having a good time and you want to see Peter and Homer duke it out".&lt;ref name="EWSimpsonsGuy"/&gt;

"The Simpsons Guy" includes [[cameo appearance]]s by [[Roger (American Dad!)|Roger]] of ''[[American Dad!]]'', [[Bob Belcher (Bob's Burgers)|Bob Belcher]] of ''[[Bob's Burgers]]'' and [[Fred Flintstone]] of ''[[The Flintstones]]''.&lt;ref name="Cameo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/simpsons-family-guy-crossover-trailer-1201269926/ |title='Simpsons'-'Family Guy' Crossover: Watch 5 Minutes From the Episode |work=Variety |date=2014-07-27 |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode also pokes fun at the different characters' skin colors; upon entering Springfield, Peter warns the family not to drink the water because all the citizens appear to have [[hepatitis]], while Homer refers to the Griffin family as "our [[Albinism|albino]] visitors".&lt;ref name="Cameo" /&gt; The Springfield Gorge scene in Homer and Peter's fight sequence is a reference to the finale of the [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] episode "[[Bart the Daredevil]]" in which Homer inadvertently ends up jumping the Gorge on Bart's skateboard.&lt;ref name=week&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meslow|first1=Scott|title=How the ''Simpsons''/''Family Guy'' crossover revealed the worst of both shows|url=http://theweek.com/articles/443412/how-simpsonsfamily-guy-crossover-revealed-worst-both-shows|accessdate=July 31, 2015|work=[[The Week]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The episode was watched by 8.45 million people. This was slightly more than the [[Resurrection (season 2)|second season]] premiere of ''[[Resurrection (U.S. TV series)|Resurrection]]'' on [[ABC Television|ABC]] but less than ''[[The Good Wife]]'' on [[CBS]], both shows in the same timeslot. "[[Clown in the Dumps]]", the earlier premiere of the [[The Simpsons (season 26)|twenty-sixth season]] of ''The Simpsons'' was watched by 8.53 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sunday Final Ratings: 'Once Upon A Time', 'Resurrection' &amp; 'Revenge' Adjusted Up; 'CSI' Adjusted Down|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/09/30/sunday-final-ratings-once-upon-a-time-resurrection-csi-adjusted-down/308631|work=TVbytheNumbers|accessdate=28 April 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141002081656/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/09/30/sunday-final-ratings-once-upon-a-time-resurrection-csi-adjusted-down/308631|archivedate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
"The Simpsons Guy" received mixed reviews. Writing in ''[[USA Today]]'', Mike Foss gave the episode a positive review, but criticized how the episode was written by ''Family Guy'' staff and thus lacked elements of ''The Simpsons''{{'}} humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foss|first1=Mike|title='The Simpsons' and 'Family Guy' came together and it was awesome and sad|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/09/the-simpsons-and-family-guy-came-together-and-it-was-awesome-and-sad|accessdate=September 29, 2014|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jason Hughes of ''[[TheWrap]]'' was also generally in praise of the episode, but felt that certain scenes—including both Peter and Homer's fight and an erotic car wash sequence—were "squeamish" and out of place for ''The Simpsons''. He however acknowledged that Bart's disgust at Stewie's behavior was "a good statement" of the difference between the two shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hughes|first1=Jason|title='Family Guy'-'Simpsons' Crossover Is Everything Fans of Both Shows Love|url=http://www.thewrap.com/family-guy-simpsons-crossover-is-everything-fans-of-both-shows-love/|accessdate=September 29, 2014|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive reviews of the crossover also came from [[IGN]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/09/26/family-guy-the-simpsons-guy-review|title=Family Guy: "The Simpsons Guy" Review|work=IGN|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[International Business Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/family-guy-simpsons-crossover-review-what-happened-when-peter-met-homer-what-deuce-vs-eat-my-1467602|title=Family Guy-Simpsons Crossover Review: What Happened When Peter Met Homer, What The Deuce Vs Eat My Shorts, Twitter Reaction|work=International Business Times UK|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[Standard-Examiner]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.standard.net/Entertainment/2014/09/29/When-the-Simpsons-and-Family-Guy-collide.html|title=REVIEW: Simpsons and Family Guy crossover episode|work=Standard-Examiner|accessdate=7 October 2014|author=Paul Barney}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[TVLine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2014/09/28/family-guy-simpsons-crossover-season-premiere-best-moments/|title=Family Guys's Simpsons Crossover – Best Moments From Season Premiere – TVLine|date=29 September 2014|work=TVLine|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics responded negatively. Scott Meslow, of ''[[The Week]]'', pointed out his disappointment that the episode parodied a scene in "Bart the Daredevil", as that episode dealt with Homer and Bart's relationship, but "The Simpsons Guy" used it as a joke in a violent sequence.&lt;ref name=week/&gt; Todd VanDerWerff wrote on [[Vox Media|VOX]] that while he expected the episode to be mediocre, it actually ended up a "blight on humanity itself". He listed nine reasons for this statement, including his dissatisfaction with the car wash and fight scenes,  and the use of sexist jokes which had lost their [[shock value]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/9/29/6863279/family-guy-simpsons-crossover-bad|title=9 ways the Family Guy/Simpsons crossover was a blight on humanity|date=29 September 2014|work=Vox|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the episode aired in the United Kingdom in July 2015, Ellen E. Jones, of ''[[The Independent]]'', criticized the episode's rape jokes and violence, and theorized that with the poor box-office performance of his latest film ''[[Ted 2]]'', audiences were growing tired of MacFarlane's humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jones|first1=Ellen E.|title=Family Guy Simpsons crossover episode highlights gulf between the cartoons – review|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/family-guy-bbc2--review-the-simpsons-crossover-highlights-gulf-between-the-cartoons-10367179.html|accessdate=August 5, 2015|work=[[The Independent]]|date=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Power of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', however, wrote that ''Family Guy''{{'}}s usual objectionable content was restrained in the episode, as if it had been "infected" by recent seasons of ''The Simpsons''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Power|first1=Ed|title=Family Guy: The Simpsons Guy, review: 'the humour was forced throughout'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/tv-and-radio-reviews/11710388/Family-Guy-The-Simpsons-Guy-review-the-humour-was-forced-throughout.html|accessdate=August 5, 2015|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=July 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The A.V. Club]]'' named the episode among "The worst TV of 2014" under "Worst crossover", writing that "for no real reason, Homer and Peter find themselves in an interminable 'sexy car wash' montage, sudsing and squirting each other in tied-off tees and denim cutoffs. ''Family Guy'' prides itself on cutaway gags, but the car-wash scene... is its most successful look-away gag".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alston|first1=Joshua|title=The worst TV of 2014|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/worst-tv-2014-212141|accessdate=February 11, 2015|work=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
"The Simpsons Guy" attracted controversy before it had aired. Tim Winter, the President of the [[Parents Television Council]], a socially conservative media monitoring organization and longtime [[Criticism of Family Guy|critic of ''Family Guy'']], wrote to Matt Groening, Seth MacFarlane and Fox about a joke seen in the trailer for the episode. In it, after Bart's [[prank call]] to Moe asking for a man with an innuendo name, Stewie makes his own call and tells Moe that his sister is being [[rape]]d. Winter felt that jokes about rape make it "less outrageous in real life", and that people who watch ''The Simpsons'' but not ''Family Guy'' would be unfamiliar with the latter show's brand of humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gajewski|first1=Ryan|title='Simpsons,' 'Family Guy' Crossover Episode Criticized for Rape Joke|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/simpsons-family-guy-crossover-episode-736244|accessdate=September 28, 2014|work=The Hollywood Reporter|date=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Fox spokeswoman declined to comment on the joke, while MacFarlane, interviewed by ''Entertainment Weekly'', said that although he would be attacked for stating it as such, the joke was "pretty funny... in context".&lt;ref name=joke/&gt; A spokeswoman from the [[Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network]] said "I think the show is making it clear that rape is not funny by how they are positioning the joke."&lt;ref name=joke&gt;{{cite news|title="Simpsons"/"Family Guy" crossover under fire for rape joke|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/simpsons-family-guy-crossover-under-fire-for-rape-joke/|accessdate=September 24, 2014|agency=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parents Television Council declared the episode worst show of the week, saying that it was significantly distasteful to involve ''The Simpsons'' because although that series is rated PG, ''Family Guy'' aims "to reach the most extreme and outlandish conclusion of any joke, no matter how harsh the punchline may be. For subjecting viewers to jokes about rape, cartoon nudity, and disturbing acts of violence, Fox's ''Family Guy'' will remain the Worst TV Show of the Week".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Worst of the Week: ''Family Guy'' on Fox|url=http://w2.parentstv.org/Main/News/Detail.aspx?docID=3168|publisher=[[Parents Television Council]]|date=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Town Crier, Provincetown, MA.jpg|thumb|upright|Town crier of [[Provincetown, Massachusetts]], in 1909]]
A '''town crier''', also called a '''bellman''',{{cn|date=June 2018}} is an officer of the court who makes public pronouncements as required by the court (cf. [[Black's Law Dictionary]]).

==Duties and functions==
The town crier can also be used to make public announcements in the streets. Criers often dress elaborately, by a tradition dating to the 18th century, in a red and gold coat, white breeches, black boots and a [[tricorne]] hat.

They carry a [[handbell]] to attract people's attention, as they shout the words "[[Oyez]], Oyez, Oyez!" before making their announcements. The word "Oyez" means "hear ye," which is a call for silence and attention. ''Oyez'' derives from the [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] word for ''listen'' (modern French, ''oyez'', infinitive, ''ouïr'', but largely replaced by the verb ''écouter''). The proclamations book in [[Chester]] from the early 19th century records this as "O Yes, O Yes!"

==History==

===Europe===
Prior to widespread literacy, town criers were the means of communication with the people of the town since many people could not read or write. Proclamations, local bylaws, market days, adverts, were all proclaimed by a bellman or crier.

In [[ancient Rome]], they typically proclaimed public business during the [[nundinae|market days]] that formed a kind of [[weekend]] every 8 days (9 days inclusively).&lt;ref name=homestruck&gt;{{harvp|Struck|2009|loc=[http://www.classics.upenn.edu/myth/php/tools/dictionary.php?method=did&amp;regexp=578 "Nundinae"]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Goslar, Germany, a crier was employed to remind the local populace not to urinate or defecate in the river the day before water was drawn for brewing beer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.windsortowncrier.com/twin-town-crier/ |first=Chris |last=Brown |title=Twin Town Crier helps keep the beer flowing |work=Windsor and Maidenhead Town Crier |date=19 April 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Criers were not always men, many town criers were women.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Bells were not the only attention-getting device—in [[Netherlands|the Netherlands]], a [[gong]] was the instrument of choice for many, and in [[France]] a drum was used, or a [[Horn (instrument)|hunting horn]].

In the observance of [[Allhallowtide]], "it was customary for criers dressed in black to parade the streets, ringing a bell of mournful sound and calling on all good Christians to remember the poor [[soul in the Bible|souls]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The World Review'', Volume 4, University of Minnesota, p.255.&lt;/ref&gt;

====England====
In order to gain the attention of the crowd, the crier would yell, "Hear ye" – "[[Oyez]]".
[[File: Town crier Peter Moore.JPG|thumb|150px|left|upright|[[Peter Moore (town crier)|Peter Moore]], the late Town crier to the Mayor of London and The Greater London Authority.]]
In [[England in the Middle Ages|Medieval]] [[England]], town criers were the chief means of news communication with the townspeople, since many were [[Illiteracy|illiterate]] in a period before the [[moveable type]] was invented. Royal [[proclamation]]s, local bylaws, market days, adverts, even selling [[sugarloaf|loaves of sugar]] were all proclaimed by a bellman or crier throughout the centuries—at Christmas 1798, the Chester Canal Co. sold some sugar damaged in their [[packet trade|packet boat]] and this was to be advertised by the bellman.

The crier also escorted the destitute to the [[workhouse]], installed minor criminals in the [[stocks]] and administered [[flogging]]s. During public [[hanging]]s he read out why the person was being hanged, and helped to cut him or her down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1994-04-09/news/1994099060_1_town-crier-alford-oyez |first=Carl |last=Schoettler |title=Town crier: a venerable calling that speaks volumes |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |date=9 April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chester records of 1540 show fees due to the bellman included "of every worshipful gentyllman that goyth onye gounes at ther buryall ...one goune [at funerals gowns would be given to mourners]. when he gythe or aneything that is lost ...jd [one penny]. for every bote lode with powder mellwylle [salted fish] ...one fyshe, for every boute lode with fresh fyshe that he goeth for ...jd [one penny]." In 1556, a record shows "To ye belman for p'claimyng ye Founder's dyryge 27 Januarij ...ijd [two pence on Henry VIII's death, the founder of the King's School]."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In 1620, there was a fight at the Chester cross between the butchers and the bakers where the "Cryer brake his Mace in peeces Amonge them". In 1607, one public notice read by George Tunnall, the bellman, forbade tipping rubbish in the river. In 1715, a local man recorded that the "Belman at the Cross ... Reads publicly a proclamation in the Mayor's name, commanding all persons in the City to be of peaceable and civil behaviour, not to walk around the Streets or Rows at unreasonable hours of night". Chester once had a crier, a day bellman and a night bellman, but in 1734, John Posnitt took over as "Day and Night Bellman."{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

A 1701 will of the vicar at Waverton stated that notice was to be given "by the Belman to the People of Chester, of the time when, and the place where my Corpse is to be buried".{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Salmon fishing season was also closed by the bellman.&lt;ref&gt;''Courant'', 17 April 1792.
:A few days ago some persons were brought before our magistrates, charged with angling and catching salmon fry in the River Dee, As the law expressly forbids the young salmon to be taken, either with nets or other engines, the bellman had orders to give notice to the inhabitants, that prosecutions would be commenced against any persons offending in the like manner.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Chronicle'', 12 December 1845.
:Illegal Fishing
:On Saturday last, four fishermen, named William Gibson, William Hand, Robert Barlow, and William Banks, appeared at Chester Police Court, to answer an information preferred against them by Buckley, the constable appointed by the River Dee Conservancy, for being out night  fishing with illegal nets (less than 2½ inches in the mesh), and also for taking unsizeable fish. The information was laid under the 1st George 1. c. 18, s.4. Immediately upon being placed before the Bench, a somewhat noisy colloquy commenced between the Supt. of Police, the court and the defendants; the latter stoutly denying that to use small nets would be to ensure the escape of all other fish. On being told that at this season of the year they could catch nothing but salmon, Barlow stated that the other night they had caught nine shillings worth of flukes, and we have good authority for saying that this statement was correct. Gibson, striking his fist on the table, solemnly swore that, "he had not killed a salmon since they were cried down" and another affirmed that it would be no use killing them as "they were not fit for pigs, much less Christians." After a long debate between the Court and the defendants, in which the latter seemed strongly disposed to try elsewhere the right of the Magistrates to prevent them fishing with nets of any size, providing they took no salmon, a reluctant  promise was wrung from them, that they would not offend in a similar way in the future and they were discharged.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Posting A Notice" comes from the act of the town crier, who having read his message to the townspeople, would attach it to the door post of the local inn. Some newspapers took the name "The Post" for this reason.

Town criers were protected by law, as they sometimes brought bad news such as tax increases. Anything done by the town crier was done in the name of the ruling monarch and harming a town crier was considered to be treason.&lt;ref name="BBCAug2010"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bradford/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8931000/8931369.stm |title=Top town crier to be crowned as Hebden Bridge hits 500 |work=[[BBC News]] |date=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "[[Shooting the messenger|don't shoot the messenger]]" was a real command.&lt;ref name="BBCAug2010"/&gt;

There are two organizations representing town criers including the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers and Loyal Company of Town Criers.

By tradition, a copy of the Royal Proclamation about the [[dissolution of the Parliament of the United Kingdom]] is delivered by hand from the [[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council Office]] to [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] in the [[City of London]]. It is then read out by the Common Crier (''aka'' Mace-bearer) of the City on the steps of the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] in the heart of the City, having been handed to him by the Common Serjeant of the City, ahead of its being also read out in the [[London borough]]s.

There have been town criers in North America ever since Europeans have been coming to the continent. There are records throughout the 16th century of town criers in Mexico, Peru, and Panama. During the 1830s and 40s Halifax, [[Nova Scotia]] had as many as four in the city. All through the American Colonies and beyond, such as Santa Fe, New Mexico; Boston, Massachusetts and Stamford, Connecticut had criers during the mid 17th century. In some places, the office of town crier persisted into the early 20th century. At least as recently as 1904, [[Los Angeles]] and several adjacent towns had official town criers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George Wharton |last=James |title=Travelers’ handbook to southern California |location=Pasadena, California |publisher=G.W. James |year=1904 |quote=The book provides lists of current office holders, including town criers, for several local jurisdictions.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===

====India====
In many parts of India, the village crier traditionally carried a rustic drum to call public attention, following up with the message. The message had a typical flow, starting with "people of (...) village, the headman would like to announce that..." followed by the message.

====Nepal====
In Nepal, the town crier is called a ''katuwal'' which derives from local Tibetic, ''kat'' 'voice' + an Indic suffix ''-wal'' 'kind of person' (see TGTM *''kat'' 'voice' in &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Martine |last=Mazaudon |title=Consonantal mutation and tonal split in the Tamang sub-family of Tibeto-Burman. Kailash 6, 157-79. |year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Similar to the European counterpart, the ''katuwal'' is responsible for news and other announcements in some rural villages (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rising |last=Nepal |title=Katuwal tradition still around in Sikles |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jana |last=Fortier |title=Beyond Jajmani: Indigenous labor relations of Nepal |location=Madison | publisher=Univ. of Wisconsin |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The town crier is paid traditionally in grain after each harvest, a portion from each family in the village. The town crier not only makes public announcements, but makes announcements in particular neighborhoods when more labor or help is needed for daily work by other families out in the fields. This ensures that labor demands are met during more intensive work activities such as harvests, weeding, and planting.

===Africa===
[[File:Native town crier, Belgian Congo.jpg|thumb|Congolese town crier]]
Town criers were prominent in the precolonial and colonial eras of [[Igboland]], a West African region in the present-day [[Nigeria]]. They served as the major means of information dissemination in their respective communities.

==Modern town criers==
[[File:Town Criers Thetford.jpg|thumb|260px|left|A Town Criers Competition in [[Thetford]] in 2015]]
When the need for a town crier disappeared, the position passed into local [[folklore]]. Informal and later formal town crier competitions were held from the early 20th century. Subsequently, some cities and towns reinstated the post purely for ceremonial purposes.

Many local councils in England and Wales reinstated the post of town crier from the mid-1990s onwards (e.g. Chester).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chestertowncriers.com/cross-proclamation-feedback/ |title=Cross Proclamation Feedback |work=Chester Town Criers |year=2016 |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are honorary appointments or employed part-time by the council. In October 2010, there were 144 towns in England and Wales with town criers registered with the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahgtc.org.uk/ |title=Home: Promoting Prestigious Public Pronouncements |work=Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers |year=2016 |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They mainly perform ceremonial duties at civic functions. Local councils with a paid town crier often make them available for charity events.

In the [[Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames]], the town crier is also appointed the [[Tipstaff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200233/your_mayor/488/about_the_office_of_mayor_and_other_civic_roles/2 |title=About the Office of Mayor and other civic roles |work=The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames |year=2016 |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an appointment which exists in no other local council.

In the 2010s in England, town criers still announce the births of royal heirs and occasionally the arrival of the royal family. [[Tony Appleton]], an octogenarian and self-proclaimed “royalist crier,” took it upon himself to announce, as loudly as he can, important news about the royal family. Appleton has served as town crier for the nearby city of [[Romford]], but he does not represent the royal family. Appleton [https://www.yahoo.com/news/town-criers-royal-birth-cameo-confuses-us-journos-135309893.html admitted as much in 2013], when news outlets were confused by his presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/town-crier-announces-royal-birth/|title=FACT CHECK: Did a Town Crier Announce the Royal Birth?|work=Snopes.com|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Royal baby: Town crier announces news of Prince William and Catherine's son |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23413905 |work=BBC News |date=22 July 2013 |accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Royal baby: Town crier announces birth of Royal Prince |url=http://www.windsorobserver.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2013/07/23/91498-video-royal-borough-town-crier-welcomes-the-royal-baby-outside-windsor-castle/?mode=print |newspaper=Slough &amp; Windsor Observer |publisher=Berkshire Media Group |accessdate=21 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130821154233/http://www.windsorobserver.co.uk/news/roundup/articles/2013/07/23/91498-video-royal-borough-town-crier-welcomes-the-royal-baby-outside-windsor-castle/?mode=print |archivedate=21 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.priory900.org/?attachment_id=3076 |title=Their Royal Highnesses the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall visit Bridlington Priory, Tuesday 23 July |work=Bridlington Priory  |date=5 August 2013 |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/news-and-diary/the-prince-of-wales-and-the-duchess-of-cornwall-visit-yorkshire |title=Visit to Yorkshire |work=princeofwales.gov.uk |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several town crier [[guild]]s in both [[Canada]] and the United States. These include the Ontario Guild of Town Criers, the Nova Scotia Guild of Town Criers and the American Guild of Town Criers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.towncrier.on.ca/ |title=The Ontario Guild of Town Criers |work=towncrier.on.ca |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nsgtc.webs.com/ |title=Home |work=Nova Scotia Guild of Town Criers |year=2016 |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americantowncriers.com/|title=American Guild of Town Criers |work=americantowncriers.com |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the town of [[Burlingame, California]] added a town crier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smdailyjournal.com/articles/lnews/2016-02-06/calling-all-history-lovers-burlingame-announces-citys-first-official-town-crier/1776425158058.html |title=Calling all history lovers: Burlingame announces city's first official town crier |date=6 February 2016 |first=Austin |last=Walsh |newspaper=San Mateo Daily Journal |accessdate=14 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], as of October 2010, the [[City of Sydney]], [[City of Hobart]], [[City of Greater Geelong]], [[City of Portland (Victoria)|City of Portland]], [[City of Ipswich]], [[City of Gosford]], [[City of Salisbury]], [[City of Gold Coast]] and 22 other local councils had an official town crier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://australiantowncrier.com/criers.htm |title=Town Criers in Australia |work=Ancient and Honourable Guild of Australian Town Criers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''TurtleStrike''''' is a free to play multiplayer strategy game with live turn-based mechanics developed by the [[Prague]]-based [[eeGon Games]]. Both players have limited time to plan their moves and then the moves of both players are processed simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;[http://world.einnews.com/pr_news/125168706/eegon-announces-turtlestrike-for-ios-and-android eeGon Announces TurtleStrike for iOS and Android]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept combines [[board game]] playing principles like ''[[Battleship (game)|Battleship]]'' with fast-paced strategy games, role-playing games and [[Turn-based tactics|tactical turn-based games]]. It is not a classical asynchronous [[Turn-based strategy]]; players have to play the whole match at once rather than check in and play their turn when it is convenient.

The game is be available on iOS and Android systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.androidshock.com/news/turtle-strike-by-eegon-announced/ Turtle Strike by eeGon Announced]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==

Both players start with 10 turtles and the first player who manages to wipe all enemy turtles is the winner. Before the game starts, a player have to place his/her turtles into 3 formations. The shapes of formations can be customized into different shapes – as long as turtles are touching side to side. Each formation can move, shoot a missile or torpedo, use a shield or a special weapon. The player can obtain achievement points to unlock items in an n-game weapon shop.

===Tournaments===
''TurtleStrike'' Organized Play has two forms: ladder play and tournaments. A player can participate in a quick ladder games with gradual progress of competitive play due to being paired with another similarly skilled opponents. The other possibility to compete are the tournaments for various prizes.

==Development and marketing==
[[File:TurtleStrike Picture2.png|frameless|right|''TurtleStrike'']]

The release date was announced by developer for 25 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.droidgamers.com/index.php/game-news/android-game-news/6359-war-mongering-reptile-filled-turn-based-multiplayer-combat-game-turtlestrike-arriving-july-25th War-mongering reptile filled turn-based multiplayer combat game TurtleStrike arriving July 25th]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the developer, the post release content will be in the sign of tons of new cosmetic items – turtle skins and environments - but also new weapons and super weapons. Developer is also planning constant future weapon balancing: "There should be no overpowered weapon combinations in our game and close attention is being paid to the balancing of weapons on different levels."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turtlestrike.com/faq Official TurtleStrike FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wanda Wisdom''' is the female impersonation persona of '''Bradley Traynor''' (born April 23, 1975 in [[California]]). She is a [[drag queen]] entertainer and a [[podcaster]] from [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].

== Career ==
Wisdom used to host semi-daily podcast show called "The Progrum" (previously known as "Lucky Bitch Radio"). Her "male alter ego," Bradley Traynor, hosted a separate daily podcast, "Big Gay News," dedicated to LGBT related news, but his role as host of Big Gay News has since been succeeded by Pierre Tardif.

Wisdom holds the title of the world's first podcasting drag queen&lt;ref name=podcastnews&gt;{{cite web |title=Twin-Cities Podcaster Wants You to Wake Up to a Drag Queen. |url=http://www.podcastingnews.com/archives/2005/05/twincities_podc.html |date=2005-05-09 |accessdate=2007-07-26 |work=PodcastingNews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wanda has interviewed many celebrities on her show including [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Lady Bunny]], [[BeBe Zahara Benet]], [[Miss Coco Peru]], and [[Adam Carmichael]].

Wisdom is also featured in Minneapolis LGBT magazine ''[[Lavender Media]]''.

She occasionally co-hosted a radio and TV spot with [[Jason Matheson]] on [[KMSP-TV|KMSP]] [[KMSP-TV|Fox 9]], [[WFTC-TV]] [[My29]] and [[KTMY]] MyTalk 107.1, which led to Bradley Traynor going full-time on the Colleen &amp; Bradley show.&lt;ref name=mytalk1071&gt;{{cite web |title=colleen-and-bradley-show|url=http://www.mytalk1071.com/shows/colleenbradley  |accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked a transition from Lavender Media who had previously hosted The Progrum, and the final Lavender Media hosted episode of "The Progrum" was podcast on 3 April 2012. Since then wandawisdom.com has been taken offline, but there have been recent hints on Wanda's Facebook timeline that the program may make a return.&lt;ref name="Facebook.com"&gt;{{cite web |title=facebook-wanda-wisdom|url=http://www.facebook.com/wandawisdom  |accessdate=2012-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in [[airshow]]s and [[barnstorming]] during the 1920s, '''wing walking''' is the act of moving on the wings of an [[airplane]] during flight.

==Early development==
The earliest known instance of a wing-walking on a powered aircraft was an experimental flight in England involving a biplane built by Colonel [[Samuel Franklin Cody]] in 1911. At Laffan's Plain Cody wished to demonstrate how his Flying Cathedral biplanes had the greatest lateral stability even with a passenger {{convert|10|ft|6|in}} away from the aircraft's center of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20180123072203/http://flyingmachines.ru/Images7/Flight/1911/106-1.jpg Colonel Cody's flight with passenger or assistant on outer panels of aircraft; flyingmachines.ru/ - Russian language web site containing some information from Jane's](Wayback Machine)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20171129095714/http://flyingmachines.ru/Site2/Crafts/Craft28465.htm Complete English language version of Russian language aviation site with Jane's information: this page dedicated to Samuel Cody's 1911 aviation experiments](Wayback Machine)&lt;/ref&gt;
The first wing walker to perform daring stunts was 26-year-old [[Ormer Locklear]].  Legend has it that he first climbed out onto the lower wings during his pilot training in the Army Air Service during World War I.  Undaunted, Ormer just climbed out of the cockpit onto the wings in flight whenever there was a mechanical issue and fixed the problem.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.silverwingswingwalking.com/resource_zone.html Wingwalking History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On {{start date and age|1918|11|8|paren=y}}, Locklear wowed the crowd at Barron Field, Texas, with the first public performance of his daredevil wing-walking stunts.  Wing walking was seen as an extreme form of [[barnstorming]], and wing walkers would constantly take up the challenge of outdoing one another. They themselves admitted (or rather proclaimed proudly) that the point of their trade was to make money on the audience's prospect of possibly watching someone die.&lt;ref name="gov"&gt;[http://www.centennialofflight.net/essay/Explorers_Record_Setters_and_Daredevils/wingwalkers/EX13.htm centennialofflight.net] - Wing Walkers&lt;/ref&gt;

After this initial demonstration, wing walkers continued to play an important part in the Army Air Corps (now the U.S. Air Force) and Navy in the advancement of aviation. They were instrumental in the first air-to-air refuelling, as well as long-distance flight records.  In 1921, Wesley May strapped a fuel tank on his back and performed a plane-to-plane transfer.  Additional tests were undertaken, and a hose with aid of a wing walker was the next exploration into aerial refuelling.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Ormer Locklear led the charge with his plane-to-plane transfer, and many followed.  His female equivalent, the first woman to switch planes in the air, was Ethal Dare.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Some of the many aerialists to become popular were Tiny Broderick, Gladys Ingles, Eddie Angel, Virginia Angel, Mayme Carson, Clyde Pangborn, [[Lillian Boyer]], Jack Shack, Al Wilson, Fronty Nichols, Spider Matlock, Gladys Roy, Ivan Unger, Jessie Woods, Bonnie Rowe, Charles Lindbergh, and Mabel Cody (niece of Buffalo Bill Cody).{{fact|date=April 2018}}

Eight wing walkers died in a relatively short period during the infancy of wing walking and even the great Ormer Locklear himself perished in 1920 while performing a stunt for a film.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
 
Variations on wing walking became common, with such stunts as doing handstands, hanging by one's teeth, and transferring from one plane to another. A 1931 article on wing-walking on inverted aircraft touted the practical aspect of performing inflight landing-gear inspection or maintenance.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ziff Davis#Popular Aviation|Popular Aviation]]'', December 1931, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually wing walkers began making transfers between a ground vehicle, such as a car, a boat, or a train, to the plane. Other variations included free-falls ending with a last-minute parachute opening.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

[[Charles Lindbergh]], whose career in flight began with wing walking, was well known for stunts involving parachutes.
The first African-American woman granted an international pilot license, [[Bessie Coleman]], also engaged in stunts using parachutes.&lt;ref name="gov"/&gt; Another successful woman in this profession was [[Lillian Boyer]], who performed hundreds of  wing-walking exhibitions, automobile-to-plane changes, and parachute jumps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehenryford.org/museum/heroes/barnstormers/lillianboyer.asp TheHenryFord.org] -  Lillian Boyer, "Empress of the Air"&lt;/ref&gt;

Then 18-year-old [[Elrey Borge Jeppesen]], best known today for later having developed air navigation manuals and charts, joined [[Tex Rankin]]'s Flying Circus around 1925; one of his jobs was wing walking.{{fact|date=April 2018}}

==Flying circuses and wing walkers==
Flying circuses formed and they featured a variety of [[stunt performer]]s. [[Promoter (entertainment)|Promoters]] would herald the way with posters hyping up the danger of air walking and the new celebrities that would perform.

Some famous early flying circuses or troops were The Gates Flying Circus, the Flying Aces Air Circus (Jimmy and Jessie Woods), The 13 Black Cats, The Five Blackbirds (an all African-American team), Mabel Cody's Flying Circus, Bugs McGowen's Flying Circus, and a troop run by Douglas Davis.

The Gates Flying Circus is perhaps the organization that made the most impression on the public.  In one day alone, they gave 980 rides.  This was done by pilot Bill Brooks at the Steubenville Air show in Ohio.  Their one dollar joy ride was a sensation.

When the [[stock market crash]] of 1929 occurred, many of the more prominent flying circuses such as The Gates Flying Circus folded. Smaller operations, such as the Flying Aces, with Jimmy and Jessie Woods, continued until the 1938 [[Air Commerce Act]] required them to wear a [[parachute]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==After World War II==

In the 1970s, stunt men and women still had some restrictions.  They had to be attached to the upper wing center section.

In the mid 1970s, [[Ron David]], a pilot and gifted narrator, became the director of the Flying Circus in Bealeton, [[Virginia]].  Under his stewardship he returned the air show back to its [[barnstorming]] roots and included a wing-walking act.  Since the Flying Circus aerodrome was a grass field, he asked the CAA to allow the wing walker out of cockpit during flight and return into the cockpit, so the wing walker could be strapped in for takeoff and landing.  His concern was taking off or landing with a wing rider on the top wing and the chance of the plane flipping over if it hit a rut in the grass field. He was granted permission.

His first wing walker was Bill FitzSimons, a jumper with the Flying Circus. Bill left to continue his act around the country with pilot Ron Shelley.  Jim Bradley, Bill's understudy, stepped in.  Jim was a member of the Saint Michael's Angels there in the Flying Circus Aerodrome in Bealeton, Virginia.  Jim tested and developed the fundamentals of their act.

When his Army duty called him, he chose Hank Henry to continue wing walking with Ron.  Hank wing walked a year and Ron advertised for a new wing walker.  Nour Jorgensen responded to the ad.  Jim Bradley, Hank Henry, and Nour Jurgenson busted the boundaries of wing walking. The stunt work they pioneered is still state of the art and continues to inspire wing walkers around the world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

On November 14, 1981, in an event organized by Martin Caidin, 19 skydivers set an unofficial wing-walking world record by standing on the left wing of a Junkers JU-52 aircraft in flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

On October 20, 2018, Canadian [[rapper]] [[Jon McMurray|Jon "Jon James" McMurray]] died while attempting to wing walk, while filming a music video. McMurray fell off the wing too close to the ground to deploy his back up parachute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-canadian-rapper-dies-after-falling-off-airplane-wing-in-failed-stunt/|title=Canadian rapper dies after falling off airplane wing in failed stunt in B.C.|accessdate=23 October 2018|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction==
A wing walker, played by [[Susan Sarandon]], falls to her death in the film ''[[The Great Waldo Pepper]]'' ([[1975 in film|1975]]).{{fact|date=April 2018}}

[[Sonic the Hedgehog]] is frequently depicted Wing Walking on his plane, the Tornado, with [[Miles Tails Prower]] as his pilot.{{fact|date=April 2018}}
