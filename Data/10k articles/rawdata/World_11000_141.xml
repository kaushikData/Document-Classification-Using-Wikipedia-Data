== Mission ==
The official mission statement for ARTDOC states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;To prepare BD Army for war and be the architect of its future.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== History ==
In the past, the Military Training (MT) Directorate at Army Headquarters (AHQ) was responsible for carrying out different types of research works related to training of the Bangladesh Army. However, due to limited resources and a manpower shortage, they couldn't do any comprehensive research and study in the field of doctrine and development.

To strengthen the research and development capability for strategic, operational, tactical and technological enhancement, and to keep up with continual changes in the complexities of the battlefield scenario, rapid technological advancement Bangladesh Army raised ARTDOC on 25 July 2007 to develop its training and operational standards with special emphasis on research and development in the related fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Training Institutions ==
ARTDOC acts as the nodal agency of all institutional training. Bangladesh Army has 20 different training to train officers and men of all arms and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Africa Finance Corporation''' ('''AFC''') is a pan-African multilateral development finance institution established in 2007 to bridge Africa’s infrastructure investment gap through the provision of debt and equity finance, project development, technical and financial advisory services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mwaniki |first=Charles |date= 4 March 2014 |title=Africa Finance Corporation secures first global rating |url=http://www.businessdailyafrica.com/Africa-Finance-Corporation-secures-first-global-rating/-/539552/2230848/-/f8os05/-/index.html |newspaper=Business Daily Africa |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Jacks |first=Mzwandile |date=3 March 2014 |title=AFC Gets Moody’s Credit Rating |url=http://venturesafrica.com/afc-gets-moodys-credit-rating/ |newspaper=Ventures Africa |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Naso |first=Chelsea |date=29 April 2015 |title= Africa Finance Nabs $750M In Debut Eurobond Offer |url= http://www.law360.com/articles/649426/africa-finance-nabs-750m-in-debut-eurobond-offer |newspaper=Law360 |location=New York |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AFC finances infrastructure projects in Africa, focusing in particular on power, transportation, telecommunications, heavy industry and natural resources (oil, gas and mining).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nelthorpe |first=Tom |date=30 April 2015 |title=Africa Finance Corporation prices debut Eurobond |url=https://ijglobal.com/articles/96187/africa-finance-corporation-prices-debut-eurobond |newspaper=IJGlobal |location=Sub-Saharan Africa |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early projects===

Africa Finance Corporation (AFC) was launched in December, 2007 by Chukwuma Soludo, then governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), with US$2 billion of authorised share capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Marks |first1=Jon |last2=Godier |first2=Kevin |date=12 January 2007 |title=SpecialSupplement:Africa-EmergingAssetClass-ADecadeAfterBigDevelopersPulledBack,Sub-Saharan AfricaIsRe-emergingAsAMarketForInfrastructure Finance,WithInnovationsInInternationalAndLocalMarkets |url=http://www.octasis.com/pdf/06112014084242EmergingAssetClassInSubSaharanAfrica.pdf |newspaper=The Banker |location= |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, 2009 AFC agreed an equity financing deal with a consortium of investors in the US$240 million Main One Cable System, a 7,000&amp;nbsp;km submarine fibre-optic cable connecting West Africa to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Ghana: AFC-financed Main One Submarine Cable Lands |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201005200668.html |newspaper= All Africa|location= |date=20 May 2010 |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Main One Cable progresses with equity financing |url=https://www.telegeography.com/products/commsupdate/articles/2009/06/08/main-one-cable-progresses-with-equity-financing/ |newspaper=TeleGeography |location= |date=8 June 2009 |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 2009, it was reported by Reuters that AFC had US$180 million invested in oil and gas, telecoms, transport and airline projects – mainly in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fabi |first=Randy |date=15 July 2009 |title=Nigeria’s AFC investments at $180 mln, eyes more |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/nigeria-bank-afc-idUKLF49952620090715 |newspaper=Reuters |location=Abuja |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the corporation partnered with the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) and Banque Internationale pour l' Afrique Occidentale - Côte d'Ivoire (BIAO-CI) in a US$320 million trade finance facility to finance the importation, processing and refining of crude oil by Societe Ivoirienne de Raffinage (SIR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Company Announcement: AFC and Afreximbank sign $320m Trade Finance Facility for Processing and Refining of Crude Oil in Cote d’ Ivoire |url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/print-version/company-announcement-afc-and-afreximbank-sign-320m-trade-finance-facility-for-processing-and-refining-of-crude-oil-in-cote-d-ivoire-2011-09-29 |newspaper=Engineering News |location= |date=19 September 2011 |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power generation===

In June 2013, AFC announced its support for privatisation of the Nigerian power sector, providing a US$215 million debt financing facility for the acquisition of the Ughelli Power plc by Transcorp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rice |first=Xan |date=25 June 2013 |title=Volatility delays investment from Nigeria sovereign wealth fund |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/ad73a00a-ddb3-11e2-892b-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk#axzz3hsPRI0m5 |newspaper=Financial Times |location=Lagos |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The previous month it had joined Lagos-based Vigeo and India’s Tata Power in a consortium which successfully bid US$129 million for Benin Distribution Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rice |first=Xan |date=7 May 2013 |title=Vigeo: Lagos-based distributor set for long game |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3e5721dc-acd6-11e2-9454-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3i7V8r4QX |newspaper=Financial Times |location= |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, AFC provided a US$170 million loan facility to Nigerian firm Mainstream Energy Solutions Limited (MESL) in its successful bid for the 1,338 MW Kainji Hydroelectric power plant in Niger State, Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Adaramola |first=Kehinde |date=5 August 2013 |title=Powering Nigeria: MESL Partners Investors to Finance Kainji Plant |url=http://venturesafrica.com/powering-nigeria-mesl-partners-investors-to-finance-kainji-plant/ |newspaper=Ventures Africa |location= |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time it was invited to become a private sector partner in the US $7 billion USAID-funded ‘Power Africa’ initiative announced by US President Obama in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller |first1=Scott |last2=Runde |first2=Daniel |date=1 January 2014 |title=A New Development Agenda: Trade, Development, and Procurement |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cS8EAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=%22power+africa%22+africa+finance+corporation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7HGuxSoklT&amp;sig=TAIGQXBCT_qGQXu91-QGxYoL6pQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAzgKahUKEwje4PLtlJDHAhXI7xQKHeEsAH4#v=onepage&amp;q=%22power%20africa%22%20africa%20finance%20corporation&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=16 |isbn=978-1-4422-2810-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; AFC has since invested US$250 million and leveraged an additional US$1billion of investments in the power sectors of Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Longman |first=Nye |date=30 March 2015 |title=Africa Finance Corporation announces record profits |url=http://www.africanbusinessreview.co.za/finance/1886/Africa-Finance-Corporation-announces-record-profits |newspaper=African Business Review |location= |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, AFC took a 23.2% stake in Mozambican power developer Ncondezi Energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=AFC to take stake in Ncondezi Energy |url=http://www.thebusinessdesk.com/yorkshire/afc-to-take-stake-in-ncondezi-energy.html |newspaper=The Business Desk |location= |date=15 December 2014 |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in December 2014, AFC became the largest investor and lead developer in the US$900 million Kpone Independent Power Project (Kpone IPP) in Ghana, which comprises a 350MW gas turbine, a substation and fuel storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=AFC initiates $900m power project in Ghana |url=http://guardian.ng/business-services/business/afc-initiates-900m-power-project-in-ghana/ |newspaper=The Guardian |location= |date=2 February 2015 |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2015, the corporation signed a joint development agreement with the Ivorian project company Ivoire Hydro Energy SA (IHE) to build a 44MW hydroelectric power plant in Singrobo, Côte d'Ivoire.&lt;ref name=AA140715/&gt;

The same month AFC became the first African development finance institution to be accredited as a partnering institution by the Green Climate Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Green Climate Fund completes accreditation of Africa Finance Corporation |url=http://www.greentechlead.com/sustainability/green-climate-fund-completes-accreditation-of-africa-finance-corporation-24764 |newspaper= Greentechlead.com |location= |date=17 July 2015 |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, AFC and institutional investor Harith General Partners merged their power sector assets to form a new entity combining renewable and non-renewable power generating assets in Africa. The new joint venture, which supplies power to over 30 million people, has more than US$3.3billion in assets – including Kpone Independent Power Project in Ghana, Azura Edo in Nigeria and Lake Turkana Wind Power in Kenya – with a combined gross operational and under-construction capacity of 1,575 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cotterill |first=Joseph |date=22 June 2016 |title= Investors combine to create pan-African energy group |access-date=16 October 2016|

==Financing==

AFC signed its first loan – a US$50 million bilateral deal with Standard Bank – in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Africa Finance Corporation signs maiden loan and plans assault on bond market |url=http://www.globalcapital.com/article/jbwtpghjh4wn/africa-finance-corporation-signs-maiden-loan-and-plans-assault-on-bond-market |newspaper=Global Capital |location= |date=28 July 2011 |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following year the African Development Bank (AfDB) approved a US$200 million line of credit to AFC with the mandate to catalyse investments and help bridge Africa’s infrastructure gap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=AfDB Approves U.S.$ 200M Line of Credit to Africa Finance Corporation for Infrastructure Support |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201203131251.html |newspaper=All Africa |location= |date=13 March 2012 |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, AFC launched its first syndicated loan – a US$250 million deal with Citibank, Rand Merchant Bank, Standard Bank, and Standard Chartered Bank – to finance trade projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=AFC in debut syndicated loan success |url=https://tradefinanceanalytics.com/Articles/3291841/AFC-in-debut-syndicated-loan-success |newspaper=Trade Finance |location= |date=20 December 2013 |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the corporation received its first international credit rating from Moody’s Investors Services, which assigned an A3 long-term foreign currency debt rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Saigal |first=Kanika |date= |title= AFC inaugural Eurobond benefirts from Nigeria’s post-election relief |url=http://www.euromoney.com/Article/3451932/Category/11/ChannelPage/8959/AFC-inaugural-Eurobond-benefits-from-Nigerias-post-election-relief.html |newspaper=Euro Money |location= |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, AFC issued a five-year debut US$750 million Eurobond, attracting US$4.7 billion in bids from institutional investors across Asia, Europe and the US. The bond issue was the first under a US$3 billion global medium-term note programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Finance: Africa Corp debut $750 million Eurobond sees heavy demand |url=http://www.theafricareport.com/West-Africa/finance-africa-finance-corp-debut-750-million-eurobond-sees-heavy-demand.html |newspaper=The Africa Report |location= |date=29 April 2015 |access-date=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, AFC borrowed US$150 million for 15 years from [[KfW]], for onward lending in the sectors of power, telecommunications, transport and heavy industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=26 June 2016|last=Press Release| url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201606231132.html|date= 22 June 2016|

The '''''al-Baraqua II''''' was a [[ferry]] which capsized on April 6, 2006, in the [[Gulf of Tadjoura]] off the coast of [[Djibouti]]'s capital of [[Djibouti City]]. The ferry was carrying passengers from the capital to a religious festival in [[Tadjoura]] when the accident occurred, shortly after departure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4884752.stm|title=Many die in Djibouti boat tragedy|accessdate=2006-04-09 | work=BBC News | date=2006-04-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060409234931/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4884752.stm| archivedate= 9 April 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 11, the death toll stood at 113 with many still missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=80872&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=37&amp;parent_id=17|title=Toll rises to 113 in Djibouti disaster|accessdate=2006-04-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060411222602/http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=80872&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=37&amp;parent_id=17| archivedate= 11 April 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Djibouti]] president [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] ordered an investigation into the sinking. Early reports suggest the ferry may have been overcrowded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/200604/s1611887.htm|title=Djibouti boat accident death toll mounts|accessdate=2006-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 200 people were believed to be on board the ferry when it capsized.

'''Beaulieu Convent School''' is a [[Roman Catholic]] [[independent school]] for girls located in [[Saint Helier|St Helier]], [[Jersey]].

The school was established in 1951 by sisters from the [[Order of the Immaculate Conception]]. In 1999 the Order of the Immaculate Conception gifted Beaulieu School, the site and its buildings to the island of Jersey on the understanding it would remain a Catholic School.

Today the school is divided into preschool, [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary]] departments, and also operates a [[sixth form]]. Courses of study offered at the school include [[GCSE]]s, [[A Level]]s and [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]]s.

'''''Biruința''''' ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] equivalent for ''Victory''), renamed  '''''Iris Star''''' and later '''''Histria Crown''''', is a Romanian crude oil tanker.

==History==
The ''Biruința'', one of the biggest ships of the Romanian commercial fleet, was sold after the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] and after 6 years of service.  The ship was then re-registered under the Maltese flag as ''M/T IRIS STAR''. Administered by Histria Ship Management, the tanker had a 150,000 T.D.W. capacity. 

On July 27, 2000, the ship lost power due to engine failure and drifted towards Kandilli point in [[Turkey]]. There was no extensive damage reported. The sister ship of the ''Iris Star'', [[M/T Independenţa|M/T ''Independența'']], suffered a more deadly accident with a Greek ship (''M/V Evriyali'') at the southern entrance to the Strait of [[Istanbul]].  After colliding, all but three members of the Romanian tanker crew lost their lives.

In 2005, ''Biruința'' was renamed the ''Histria Crown''.

The tables are turned around when he lands this beautiful young girl, Nicole, (Doreen Rwatooro) and he falls in love.  Since he doesn’t believe in true love, Martin loses out on her when it only gets clear to him that he deeply cares for her and by the time this happens, Nicole is implicated in a crime that he very well led to. Now the love of his life has to serve a life sentence as he stays in regret and grief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Damage to be premiered on 7th December|url=http://www.sunrise.ug/life-style/201611/damage-to-be-premiered-on-7th-december.html|website=The Sunrise|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DAMAGE -Official Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxiWa3gDibk|accessdate=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat''' ({{lang-la|Eparchia Adigratensis}}) is a [[Ethiopian Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[eparchy]] located in the city of [[Adigrat]], [[Ethiopia]]. It is in the [[ecclesiastical province]] of [[Ethiopian Catholic Archeparchy of Addis Abeba|Addis Ababa]].

==History==
On 25 March 1937, [[Pope Pius XI]] established the [[Apostolic prefect|Prefecture Apostolic]] of [[Tigray Region|Tigray]] from the [[Ethiopian Catholic Archeparchy of Addis Abeba|Vicariate Apostolic of Abyssinia]]. [[Pope John XXIII]] elevated it as the Eparchy of Adigrat on 20 February 1961.&lt;ref name=hierarchy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dadig.html|title=Eparchy of Adigrat (Ethiopian)|publisher=Catholic-Hierarchy|accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gcatholic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/adig0.htm|title=Ethiopic Diocese of Adigrat|publisher=GCatholic.org|accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==OVC Project==
{{main article|OVC project|Student Initiative Rahel}}
The ADCS (''Adigrat Diocese Catholic Secretary'') is responsible for the disbursement of grants to [[scholarship]] holders of the diocese within the scope of the ''[[OVC project]]'' (OVC = "Orphans and Vulnerable Children"), funded by the [[Student Initiative Rahel]] of the ''Institute for World Church and Mission'' (IWM) (German: ''Institut für Weltkirche und Mission'') which is a part of the ''[[Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology]]'' in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen]], [[Germany]] and passed by the ''[[Pontifical Mission Societies]]'' (German: ''missio''). The OVC-project has already supported ten young people with micro-scholarships for obtaining a university entrance qualification and at least one [[bachelor's degree]] in their own country. The Rahel project helps to support [[discrimination|disadvantaged]] [[youth|young people]] in the [[Tigray region]] as part of the [[Development aid|development cooperation]] through micro-scholarships and accompanies them during their studies or their training.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift"&gt;{{cite journal| author1 = Judith Breunig | author2 = Madeleine Helbig | author3 = Claudia Berg | author4 = Stefanie Matulla | author5 = Magdalena Strauch | author6 = Marita Wagner | author7 = Benedikt Winkler | title = Rahel - Ein Bildungsprojekt für Adigrat - Festschrift der Studierendeninitiative – Ein Blick durch die Zeit: 2010–2015 (=Rahel - An education project for Adigrat - Festschrift of the initiative by students - A view through the years: 2010-2015) | publisher = Rahel-Bildungsprojekt (=Student Initiative Rahel) (SIR) / Institut für Weltkirche und Mission (=Institute for World Church and [[Christian mission|Mission]]) (IWM) | language = German | date = June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Webseite"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.iwm.sankt-georgen.de/rahel-bildungsprojekt/ | title = Rahel – Ein Bildungsprojekt für Adigrat (=Rahel - An educational project for Adigrat), official website | publisher = Rahel-Bildungsprojekt (=Student Initiative Rahel) (SIR) / Institut für Weltkirche und Mission (=Institute for World Church and Christian mission) (IWM) | language = German | accessdate = 12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to personnel fluctuation among students at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology, the project has been phasing out slowly since the end of 2017.

{{Culture of Angola}}
'''Ethnic groups in Angola''' are dominated by the [[Bantu people|Bantu]], who are divided into a number of ethnolinguistic groupings.  The main ones are the
[[Ovimbundu]], constituting some 37% of the population in 2005, the [[Kimbundu]], totaling 25% of the population, and the [[Bakongo]] with 13%.

The [[mestiço]] (mixed European and Native African) make up about 2% of the population. Since the mestiços are generally better educated than the black population, they exercise influence in government disproportionate to their numbers.{{pov-inline|date=July 2012}}{{cn|date=July 2012}} Europeans, mostly of Portuguese extraction, constitute 1% of the population; other varied groups account for the remaining 22%.

'''Franziska Tesaurus''' is the richest [[Gepid]] royal tomb  found in [[Romania]]. It was found while searching the [[Potaissa (castra)|Potaissa Roman castrum]] at [[Turda]] in 1996, by [[Mihai Bărbulescu]], between the secondary sewer and the [[frigidarium]]. The inventory of the tomb was composed of: polyhedral golden rings with [[almandine]], [[hemicyclical]] gold plated brooch, gold-plated silver belt with gold garments and almandine, amber necklace, embroidery decorations, bone comb, nomadic mirror, silver shoe belts, and small fragments of clothing.

It was put on display on 3 April 2007 in [[Turda History Museum]].

[[File:Ecozone Indomalaya.svg|thumb|400px|The Indomalayan realm]]

The '''Indomalayan realm''' is one of the eight [[biogeographic realm]]s. It extends across most of [[South Asia|South]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and into the southern parts of [[East Asia]].

Also called the '''Oriental realm''' by [[biogeography|biogeographers]], Indomalaya extends from [[Afghanistan]] through the [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[Southeast Asia]] to lowland southern [[China]], and through [[Indonesia]] as far as [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Bali]], and [[Borneo]], east of which lies the [[Wallace line]], the realm boundary named after [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] which separates Indomalayan from [[Australasian realm|Australasia]]. Indomalaya also includes the [[Philippines]], lowland [[Taiwan]], and [[Japan]]'s [[Ryukyu Islands]].

Most of Indomalaya was originally covered by forest, mostly [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]], with [[tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests]] predominant in much of India and parts of Southeast Asia. The tropical moist forests of Indomalaya are mostly dominated by trees of the [[dipterocarp]] family (Dipterocarpaceae).

== Major ecological regions ==

The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) divides Indomalayan realm into three bioregions, which it defines as "geographic clusters of ecoregions that may span several habitat types, but have strong biogeographic affinities, particularly at taxonomic levels higher than the species level (genus, family)".

=== Indian Subcontinent ===
The Indian Subcontinent bioregion covers most of [[India]], [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], [[Bhutan]], and [[Sri Lanka]]. The [[Hindu Kush]], [[Karakoram]], [[Himalaya]], and [[Patkai]] ranges bound the bioregion on the northwest, north, and northeast; these ranges were formed by the collision of the northward-drifting Indian subcontinent with Asia beginning 45 million years ago. The Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalaya are a major biogeographic boundary between the subtropical and tropical flora and fauna of the Indian subcontinent and the temperate-climate [[Palearctic]] realm.

=== Indochina ===
The Indochina bioregion includes most of mainland [[Southeast Asia]], including [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Cambodia]], as well as the subtropical forests of southern [[China]].

=== Sunda shelf and the Philippines ===
{{main article|Sundaland}}
{{main article|Ecoregions of the Philippines}}

[[Malesia]] is a botanical province which straddles the boundary between Indomalaya and Australasia. It includes the [[Malay Peninsula]] and the western Indonesian islands (known as [[Sundaland]]), the Philippines, the eastern Indonesian islands, and New Guinea. While the Malesia has much in common botanically, the portions east and west of the [[Wallace Line]] differ greatly in land animal species; Sundaland shares its fauna with mainland Asia, while terrestrial fauna on the islands east of the Wallace line are derived at least in part from species of Australian origin, such as [[marsupial]] mammals and [[ratite]] birds.

== History ==
The flora of Indomalaya blends elements from the ancient supercontinents of [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]]. Gondwanian elements were first introduced by India, which detached from Gondwana approximately 90 [[mya (unit)|MYA]], carrying its Gondwana-derived flora and fauna northward, which included [[cichlid]] fish and the [[flowering plant]] [[family (biology)|families]] [[Crypteroniaceae]] and possibly Dipterocarpaceae. India collided with Asia 30-45 MYA, and exchanged species. Later, as [[Australia-New Guinea]] drifted north, the collision of the Australian and Asian plates pushed up the islands of [[Wallacea]], which were separated from one another by narrow straits, allowing a botanic exchange between Indomalaya and [[Australasia realm|Australasia]]. Asian rainforest flora, including the dipterocarps, island-hopped across Wallacea to New Guinea, and several Gondwanian plant families, including [[podocarp]]s and [[araucaria]]s, moved westward from Australia-New Guinea into western Malesia and Southeast Asia.

== Flora and fauna ==
Two orders of mammals, the [[colugo]]s (Dermoptera) and [[treeshrew]]s (Scandentia), are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the realm, as are families Craseonycteridae ([[Kitti's Hog-nosed Bat]]), [[Diatomyidae]], [[Platacanthomyidae]], Tarsiidae ([[tarsier]]s) and Hylobatidae ([[gibbon]]s). Large mammals characteristic of Indomalaya include the [[leopard]], [[tiger]]s, [[Bubalus|water buffalos]], [[Asian Elephant]], [[Indian Rhinoceros]], [[Javan Rhinoceros]], [[Malayan Tapir]], [[orangutan]]s, and [[gibbon]]s.

Indomalaya has three endemic bird families, the Irenidae ([[fairy bluebird]]s), [[Megalaimidae]] and Rhabdornithidae ([[Philippine creeper]]s). Also characteristic are [[pheasant]]s, [[Pitta (bird)|pittas]], [[Old World babbler]]s, and [[flowerpecker]]s.

'''Intelsat IV F-1''' was a [[geostationary]] [[communication]] [[satellite]] built by [[Hughes Aircraft Company|Hughes]], it was owned by [[Intelsat]]. The satellite was based on the [[Spacebus|HS-312]] platform and its estimated useful life was 7 years.

== History ==
The Intelsat IV F-1 was part of the Intelsat IV series which consisted of eight communications satellites, launched from [[Cape Canaveral]] during the early 1970s, marked the fifth generation of geostationary communications satellites developed by the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] since 1963 with the launch of Syncom II, the world's first synchronous satellite. The [[Syncom]] II was 15&amp;nbsp;cm high and 28 inches in diameter, weighing 78 pounds in orbit. In contrast, the Intelsat IVs weighed more than 1,300 [[Pound (mass)|lb]] (595&amp;nbsp;kg) into orbit and were more than 17 feet (5.31 meters) in diameter. All seven satellites exceeded their projected life expectancies and were withdrawn from active duty, the last of which, the Intelsat IV F-1 was retired in October 1987.

The satellite was equipped with 12 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] transponders. It had 6,000 two-way [[relay]] phone calls or broadcast 12 concurrent color television programs or mixed combinations of communications traffic including data and fax.

The satellite had 12 channels of broadband communication. Each channel had a bandwidth of 40&amp;nbsp;MHz and provided about 500 communication circuits.

== Release ==
The satellite was successfully launched into space on May 22, 1975, by means of an [[Atlas SLV-3D Centaur-D]] vehicle from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] in [[Florida]], [[United States]]. It had a launch mass of 3,117 lb.&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Gunter. [http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-4a.htm Intelsat-4A]. ''Gunter's Space Page''. Retrieved 21 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1675">'''Ipmil''' or '''Ipmilbalolaš''' means [[God]] in [[Northern Sami language|Northern Sámi]]. Ipmil has been used by [[Sami people|Sámi]] [[Christian]]s for God. The Creator and ruler of the universe. There are Sámi Christians who believe in [[Laestadianism]] that use Ipmil for God. Ipmil can also be used when translating God from other cultures. Names of God: [[Allah]] ([[Islam]]), [[Adonai]] ([[Judaism]]) could be translated as Ipmil in Northern Sámi. Svenska kyrkan ([[Church of Sweden]]) has a prayer in Northern Sámi with ''Ipmil''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svenskakyrkan.se/be/prayer/59753 Mon ohcan veahki birget daid  - Svenska kyrkan]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ipmil atte'' means God grant and is a reply to ''buorre beaivi'' (good day). [[Christians]] who believe in the ''[[Trinity]]'' say: ''Áhči'' ([[God the Father|Father]]) and ''Bártni'' ([[God the Son|Son]], [[Jesus Christ]]) and ''Bassi Vuoiŋŋa'' (the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]) is ''Ipmil''. The Sámi thought there were three [[deities]]: ''[[Radien-Áhči]]'' (Father), Radien-Bártni (Jesus) and [[Akka (spirit)|Mátterahkka]] (Grandmother Spirit Mátterahkka). In [[Sami mythology]], Mátterahkka is said to have created the body of the children who were placed into the wombs. Ipmil could also have been a name to include all good deities.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

'''Karadach''' or '''Kuridach''' (in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Κουριδαχος, ''Kouridachos'', {{lang-la|Curidachus}}) was an important [[chieftain]] of the [[Akatziri]] tribe of the Hunnic confederation during the reign of [[Attila]]. According to [[Priscus]] he rose to prominence when he was courted by [[Roman Empire|Roman]] diplomats in 448 as a potential ally against the [[Huns]], but used the information to help his overlord foil a revolt among lesser chiefs of the Akatziri; thus Attila left his lands untouched while the remaining were taken.

[[Image:Bol de Leblabi de Tunisie, 21 mars 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Lablabi (with the egg option) in a Tunis restaurant]]

'''Lablabi''' or Lablebi (لبلابي) is a [[Tunisia]]n dish based on [[chick pea]]s in a thin garlic and [[cumin]]-flavoured soup, served over small pieces of stale crusty [[bread]]. It is commonly eaten in inexpensive restaurants. Raw or soft-cooked [[Egg (food)|egg]] is nearly always added to the hot soup mix (thus cooking), along with [[olive oil]], [[harissa]], additional cumin, [[caper]]s, [[tuna]] and sometimes [[olive]]s, [[garlic]] and [[vinegar]] or lemon or lime juice. Further garnishes may include cilantro (coriander), parsley and scallions.  A traditional, but rarer, version, ''hergma'' is made with cows' trotters. 

In [[Assyrian cuisine]] there is also a chick-pea based dish called lablabi.  The version in [[Iraqi cuisine]] is boiled chickpeas with some lemon juice, mainly eaten during winter as it is served hot.

In Turkey, this dish is available too, named Nohut Çorbasi (lit. chickpea soup) which is made of Chickpeas, [[Biber salçası]], Cumin, Garlic, Olive Oil, Olives, Lamb Shank.

'''"Lykken er"''' ("Happiness is", the title is often rendered with an ellipsis) was the [[Norway|Norwegian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1971]], performed in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] by [[Hanne Krogh]].

The song is a moderately up-tempo number, with Krogh describing what she sees as examples of happiness - a series of small pleasures such as "an old hat/Which used to belong to your best friend" and "breakfast in bed".

During Preview Week, Krogh was shown singing her song sitting on top of a cliff, standing on roofs, walking down the pier in her hometown, and running with local children. On the night of the Contest, she sang the song in a ball gown, with elbow-length gloves and a [[parasol]], which was used as a prop of sorts at different points in the song.

The song was performed eighteenth (last) on the night, following [[Finland]]'s [[Markku Aro &amp; Koivistolaiset]] with "[[Tie uuteen päivään]]". At the close of voting, it had received 65 points, placing 17th in a field of 18. The relatively high score for such a low finish is due to the voting structure in place at the time, where each entrant was effectively guaranteed 34 points.

It was succeeded as [[Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest|Norwegian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1972|1972 contest]] by [[Grethe &amp; Benny]] with "[[Småting]]".

{{Politics of Thailand}}
The '''monarchy of Thailand''' (whose monarch is referred to as the '''King of Thailand''' or historically as the '''King of Siam'''; {{lang-th|พระมหากษัตริย์ไทย)}} refers to the [[constitutional monarchy]] and monarch of the [[Thailand|Kingdom of Thailand]] (formerly [[Siam]]). The King of Thailand is the [[head of state]] and head of the ruling Royal [[House of Chakri]].

Although the current [[Chakri Dynasty]] was created in 1782, the existence of the institution of monarchy in Thailand is traditionally considered to have its roots from the founding of the [[Sukhothai Kingdom]] in 1238, with a brief [[interregnum]] from the death of [[Ekkathat]] to the accession of [[Taksin]] in the 18th century. The institution was transformed into a [[constitutional monarchy]] in 1932 after the bloodless [[Siamese Revolution of 1932]]. The monarchy's official ceremonial residence is the [[Grand Palace]] in [[Bangkok]], while the private residence has been at the [[Dusit Palace]].

The King of Thailand's titles include [[Head of State]], [[Head of the Royal Thai Armed Forces]], Adherent of [[Buddhism in Thailand|Buddhism]] and Upholder of [[Religion in Thailand|religions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senate.go.th/th_senate/English/constitution2007.pdf|title=Constitution of the Kingdom of Thailand B.E 2550|author=[[House of Representatives (Thailand)|The Secretariate of the House of Representatives]]|publisher=[[House of Representatives (Thailand)|The Secretariat of the House of Representatives]]|date=Nov 2007|accessdate=7 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120831223113/http://www.senate.go.th/th_senate/English/constitution2007.pdf|archivedate=31 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origin===
{{Further information|Buddhist kingship|Bhāruci|Devaraja|Maha Sammata|Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|Mandate of Heaven|Monarchy in ancient India||}} 
The current concept of Thai kingship evolved through 800 years of absolute rule. The first king of a unified [[Thailand]] was the founder of the [[Kingdom of Sukhothai]], King [[Sri Indraditya]], in 1238.&lt;ref name="JSS_014_1b_Coedes"&gt;{{cite journal

|quote=The dynasty which reigned during a part of the XIIIth. and the first half of the XlVth. centuries at Sukhodaya and at Sajjanlaya, on the upper Menam Yom, is the first historical Siamese dynasty. It has a double claim to this title, both because its cradle was precisely in the country designated by foreigners as "Siam" (Khmer: Syain; Chinese : Sien, etc.), and because it is this dynasty which, by freeing the Thai principalities from the Cambodian yoke and by gradually extending its conquests as far as the Malay Peninsula, paved the way for the formation of the Kingdom of Siam properly so called.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of this early kingship is said to be based on two concepts derived from [[Hinduism]] and [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravada Buddhist]] beliefs. The first concept is based on the [[Varna (Hinduism)|Vedic-Hindu caste]] of "[[Kshatriya]]" ({{lang-th|กษัตริย์)}}, or warrior-ruler, in which the king derives his powers from military might. The second is based on the Theravada Buddhist concept of "Dhammaraja" ({{lang-th|ธรรมราชา)}}, Buddhism having been introduced to Thailand around the 6th century CE. The idea of the Dhammaraja (or kingship under Dharma), is that the king should rule his people in accordance with [[Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]] and the teachings of the Buddha.

These ideas were briefly replaced in 1279, when King [[Ram Khamhaeng the Great|Ramkhamhaeng]] came to the throne. Ramkhamhaeng departed from tradition and created instead a concept of "[[paternal rule]]" ({{lang-th|พ่อปกครองลูก)}}, in which the king governs his people as a father would govern his children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sunsite.au.ac.th/thailand/thai_monarchy/background.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926091434/http://sunsite.au.ac.th/thailand/thai_monarchy/background.html |archivedate=26 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JSS_036_2b_PrinceDhani_Old"&gt;{{cite journal |author= |last= Prince Dhani Nivat  |first=  Kromamun Bidyadabh

|quote= '''Patriarchal Sukhothai Kingship''' ...The monarch was of course the people's leader in battle; but he was also in peace-time their father whose advice was sought and expected in all matters and whose judgment was accepted by all. He was moreover accessible to his people, for we are told by an old inscription that, in front of the royal palace of Sukhothai there used to be a gong hung up for people to go and beat upon whenever they wanted personal help and redress. The custom survived with slight modifications all through the centuries down to the change of regime in 1932....}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is reinforced in the title and name of the king, as he is still known today, ''[[Pho Khun]] Ramkhamhaeng'' ({{lang-th|พ่อขุนรามคำแหง)}}&lt;ref name="JSS_071_0g"&gt;{{cite journal

This lasted briefly. By the end of the kingdom, the two old concepts returned as symbolized by the change in the style of the kings: "Pho" was changed to "Phaya" or Lord.

===Kings of Ayutthaya===
[[File:Birmanie 2. battle betwenn Burmese and Siamese ok fini +.jpg|thumb|right|King [[Naresuan]] of Ayutthaya fought several wars against the Burmese to preserve Siamese independence.]]
The Kingdom of Sukhothai was supplanted by the [[Kingdom of Ayutthaya]], which was founded in 1351 by King [[Uthong|Ramathibodhi I]]. During the Ayutthayan period, the idea of kingship changed. Due to ancient Khmer tradition in the region, the Hindu concept of kingship was applied to the status of the leader. Brahmins took charge in the [[Coronation of the Thai monarch|royal coronation]]. The king was treated as a [[reincarnation]] of [[Hindu gods]]. Ayutthaya historical documents show the official titles of the kings in great variation: [[Indra]], [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]], or [[Rama]]. Seemingly, Rama was the most popular, as in "Ramathibodhi". However, Buddhist influence was also evident, as many times the king's title and "unofficial" name "Dhammaraja", an abbreviation of the [[Dharmaraja (Buddhism)|Buddhist Dharmaraja]]. The two former concepts were re-established, with a third, older concept taking hold. This concept was called "[[Devaraja]]" ({{lang-th|เทวราชา)}} (or "divine king"), which was an idea borrowed by the [[Khmer Empire]] from the [[Java#Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms era|Hindu-Buddhist kingdoms of Java]], especially the idea of a scholar class based on Hindu [[Brahmins]]. The concept centered on the idea that the king was an incarnation ([[avatar]]) of the god [[Vishnu]] and that he was a [[Bodhisattva]] (enlightened one), therefore basing his power on his religious power, his moral power, and his purity of blood.

The king, portrayed by state interests as a semi-divine figure, then became—through a rigid cultural implementation—an object of worship and veneration to his people. From then on the monarchy was largely removed from the people and continued under a system of absolute rule. Living in palaces designed after [[Mount Meru]] ("home of the gods" in Hinduism), the kings turned themselves into a "[[Chakravartin]]", where the king became an absolute and universal lord of his realm. Kings demanded that the universe be envisioned as [[Mandala (political model)|revolving around them]], and expressed their powers through elaborate rituals and ceremonies. For four centuries these kings ruled Ayutthaya, presiding over some of the greatest period of cultural, economic, and military growth in [[History of Thailand|Thai History]].

[[File:3 Chedis of Wat Phra Sri Sanphet.JPG|thumb|left|[[Wat Phra Si Sanphet]] next to the king's palace was the most sacred temple in the kingdom of Ayutthaya.]]
The Kings of Ayutthaya created many institutions to support their rule. Whereas [[feudalism]] developed in the [[European Middle Ages]], Ayutthayan King [[Trailokanat]] instituted ''[[sakdina]]'', a system of social hierarchy which ranked the king's subjects according to the amount of land they were entitled to, according to their rank and position.&lt;ref name="JSS_057_1e"&gt;{{cite journal|author= | last1 = Griswold | first1 = A.B. | authorlink1 =  | last2 = Prasert na Nagara | first2 = | authorlink2 = |year= 1969 |title= A Law Promulgated by the King of Ayudhya in 1397 A.D.

|quote= It was customary for Southeast Asian kings, who were of course the absolute proprietors of the land, to allot the [[usufruct]] of portions of it to their subjects. The kings of Ayudhya allotted a specified number of sakti-na or 'dignity-marks' to each of their subjects according to his rank and the position he occupied, corresponding to the number of ''[[rai (unit)|rai]]'' he was actually or theoretically entitled to; and when the system was fully developed the number of marks ranged from 5 to 25 for ordinary citizens, up to 10,000 for ministers in charge of important departments, and 20,000 for princes of the highest rank.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rachasap]]'' is required by court etiquette as an [[Thai honorifics#Honorific registers|honorific register]] consisting of a special vocabulary used exclusively for addressing the king, or for talking about royalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://thai-language.com/id/590084/ |title= Royal Words|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 9 October 2013 |website= Internet resource for the Thai language |publisher= |accessdate= 4 October 2013|quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Royal authority ====
The king was chief administrator, chief legislator, and chief judge, with all laws, orders, verdict and punishments theoretically originating from his person. The king's [[sovereign]]ty was reflected in the titles "Lord of the Land" ({{lang|th|พระเจ้าแผ่นดิน}} ''Phra Chao Phaen Din'') and "Lord of Life" ({{lang|th|เจ้าชีวิต}} ''Chao Chiwit''). The king's powers and titles were seen by foreign observers as proof that the king was an [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarch]] in the European sense. However, in Siamese tradition the duty and responsibility of the king was seen as developed from the [[Monarchy in ancient India#Authority of the King|ancient Indian theories of royal authority]], which resemble [[Enlightened Absolutism]], although the emphasis is not on [[rationality]] but on [[Dhamma]].&lt;ref name="JSS_038_1c_LingatEvol"&gt;{{cite journal |author= | last = Lingat | first =  R. | authorlink = Robert Lingat

===Kingdom restored===
{{expand section|date=March 2013}}
An interlude filled by civil war was ended when [[Taksin|King Taksin]] restored the dominion under what has been called the [[Thonburi Kingdom]].

===Chakri kings===
[[File:Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Thongduang, later King [[Rama I]] of Siam, founded the Chakri dynasty in 1782.]]
In 1782,  [[Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke|King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke]] ascended the throne and moved the capital from the [[Thonburi]] side to the [[History of Bangkok|Bangkok]] side of the [[Chao Phraya River]]. There he established the [[House of Chakri]],  the current ruling dynasty of Thailand. (This first reign was later designated as that of  Rama I in the list of [[Rama (Kings of Thailand)|Rama Kings of Thailand]].) He also established the office of [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand|Supreme Patriarch]] as the head of the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], the order of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[bhikkhu|monk]]s.

During the [[Rattanakosin era|Rattanakosin Period]] the Chakri kings tried to continue the concepts of Ayutthayan kingship once again emphasizing the connection between the sovereign and his subjects. On the other hand, they continued to not relinquish any authority of the throne. Kings [[Buddha Loetla Nabhalai]] (Rama II) and [[Nangklao]] (Rama III) created a semblance of a modern administration by creating a supreme council and appointing chief officers to help with the running of the government.&lt;ref name = "Roberts"&gt;{{cite book

[[Mongkut#Monastic life and Thammayut sect|Mongkut]] (Rama IV) marked a significant break in tradition when he spent the first 27 years of his adult life as a [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]] during which time he became proficient in the English language, before ascending the throne. As king, he continued the appointment of officers to his supreme council, the most notable being [[Thai royal and noble titles#Somdet Chao Phraya|Somdet Chao Phraya]] [[Prayurawongse]] and [[Si Suriyawongse]], both of whom acted as Chief Ministers for King Mongkut (and the latter as [[regent]], from the king's death in 1868 until 1873.)

[[Chulalongkorn]] (Rama V) ascended the throne as a minor at age 15 in 1868, and as King of Siam on 16 November 1873. As a prince, he had been tutored in Western traditions by the [[governess]], [[Anna Leonowens]].{{efn|This tutelage has been the source for several fictionalised accounts in the media, most notably the films ''[[The King and I]]'' (1951) and ''[[Anna and the King]]'' (1999), both of which have been banned in Thailand as being disrespectful to the king.}} Intent on reforming the monarchy along Western lines, during his minority he traveled extensively to observe western administrative methods. He transformed the monarchy along Western lines of an "[[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened ruler]]". He abolished the practice of [[Chulalongkorn#Abolition of prostration|prostration]] in front of the monarch, and repealed many laws concerning the relationship between the monarch and his people, while continuing many of the ancient aspects and rituals of the old kingship.&lt;ref name = "Wales"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wales |first= H.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, 37 years after his coronation, Chulalongkorn ended [[slavery]] with the Slave Abolition Act. In 1867 slaves accounted for one-third of the Siamese population.

His son, [[Vajiravudh]] (Rama VI), ascended to the throne in 1910 and continued his father's zeal for reform to bring the monarchy into the 20th century. The perceived slow pace of reform resulted in the [[Palace Revolt of 1912]]. In 1914, Vajiravudh determined that the act providing for invoking [[martial law#Thailand|martial law]], first promulgated by his father in 1907, was not consistent with modern [[laws of war]], nor convenient for the preservation of the security of the state, so it was amended to a more modern form that, with minor amendments, continued in force through subsequent changes in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thailawforum.com/laws/Martial%20Law.pdf|title= Martial Law, B.E. 2457 (1914) —  unofficial translation |accessdate=  21 May 2014|author= Pakorn Nilprapunt|year= 2006|format= PDF|work= |website= thailawforum.com|publisher= Office of the Council of State|quote= Reference to Thai legislation in any jurisdiction shall be to the Thai version only.

[[Prajadhipok]] (Rama VII)  succeeded his brother in 1925. The [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] educated monarch created a council similar to a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], where the most important government officials could meet to decide state affairs. This advisory and legislative council, styled the [[Supreme Council of State of Siam]] (Thai: อภิรัฐมนตรีสภา)  was founded on 28 November 1925 and existed until 1932.

===Constitutional monarchy===
[[File:Prajadhipok's coronation records - 001.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prajadhipok|King Prajadhipok]] signing the [[Constitution of Thailand#1932 Constitution|Constitution of Siam]], 10 December 1932.]]

In June 1932, a group of foreign-educated students and military men called "[[Khana Ratsadon|the promoters]]" carried out a bloodless [[Siamese Revolution of 1932|revolution]], seized power and demanded that King Prajadhipok grant the people of Siam a constitution. The king agreed and in December 1932 the people were granted [[Constitution of Thailand|a constitution]], ending 150 years of absolute Chakri rule. From then on the role of the monarch was relegated to that of a symbolic head of state. His powers from then on were exercised by a [[Prime Minister of Thailand|prime minister]] and the [[National Assembly of Thailand|national assembly]].

In 1935 King Pradhipok (Rama VII) abdicated the throne, following disagreements with the government. He lived in exile in the United Kingdom until his death in 1941. The king was replaced by his young nephew [[Ananda Mahidol]] (Rama VIII). The new king was 10 years old and was living abroad in [[Switzerland]]. A council of regents was appointed in his place. During this period the roles and powers of the king were entirely usurped by the [[Fascism|fascist]] government of [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]], who changed the name of the kingdom from Siam to [[Thaification|Thailand]], and aligned it on the side of the [[Axis powers]] in the [[Pacific War|Pacific theatre of World War II]]. By the end of the war Phibunsongkhram was removed and the young king returned. The [[Free Thai]] movement provided resistance to foreign occupation during the war and helped rehabilitate Thailand after the war.

After Rama VIII's sudden death from a bullet wound in 1946, Prince [[Bhumibol Adulyadej]] (Rama IX), aged 19 years old, became the new monarch. In establishing his rule, the king was aided by the efforts of the US government, who used the monarchy as a bulwark against communist gains in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="Rattanasengchanh-2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rattanasengchanh|first1=Phimmasone Michael|title=Thailand's Second Triumvirate: Sarit Thanarat and the military, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and the monarchy and the United States. 1957-1963| date=2012|publisher=University of Washington|location=Seattle|url=https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/bitstream/handle/1773/21997/Rattanasengchanh_washington_0250O_10615.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=26 April 2017|format=MA Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|50}} 

King Bhumibol was the world's longest reigning monarch at the time of his death in October 2016.

Since c. 2000, the role of the Thai monarchy has been increasingly challenged by scholars, media, observers and traditionalists, and as more educated pro-democracy interests began to express their speech.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Many deemed that a series of laws and measures relating to [[lèse majesté in Thailand]] are hindrances to freedom of expression. Dozens of arrests, hundreds of criminal investigations and multiple imprisonments have been made based on these laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Running Afoul of the Thai Monarchy| url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/09/18/world/asia/thailand-king-lese-majeste.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; King Bhumibol Adulyadej's speech in his 2005 national birthday broadcast could be interpreted that he [[Lèse majesté in Thailand#King invites criticism|welcomed criticism]].&lt;ref name="wrong"&gt;{{cite web|date=5 December 2005|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/12/05/headlines/data/headlines_19334288.html|title=Royal Birthday Address: 'King Can Do Wrong'|work=The Nation|accessdate=26 November 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DAzbOJh9?url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2005/12/05/headlines/data/headlines_19334288.html|archivedate=25 December 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lèse majesté in Thailand|lèse-majesté law]] is part of Thailand’s Criminal Code and has been described as "world's harshest lèse majesté law"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-10/thai-king-requests-constitutional-changes-to-ensure-powers/8174062|title=New Thai King requests constitutional changes to 'ensure his royal powers': Prime Minister|author-first=Liam|author-last=Cochrane|date=2017-01-11|accessdate=2017-04-20|publisher=ABC|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "possibly the strictest criminal-defamation law anywhere".&lt;ref name="economist" &gt;{{cite news|title=How powerful people use criminal-defamation laws to silence their critics|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21724993-some-countries-insulting-politicians-can-lead-jail-how-powerful-people-use|accessdate=14 July 2017|work=[[The Economist]]|date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientist [[Giles Ungpakorn]] noted that "the ''lèse-majesté'' laws are not really designed to protect the institution of the monarchy. In the past, the laws have been used to protect governments and to shield military coups from lawful criticism. This whole [royal] image is created to bolster a conservative elite well beyond the walls of the palace."&lt;ref name="frenchmanjail"&gt;{{cite news |date=13 March 2007 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/03/13/wthai13.xml|title=Swiss man faces jail for lèse majesté|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=24 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The king is assisted in his work and duties by the Private Secretary to the King of Thailand and the [[Privy Council of Thailand]], in consultation with the head of the cabinet, the [[Prime Minister of Thailand|Prime Minister]]. In accordance with the constitution the king is no longer the originator of all laws in the kingdom; that prerogative is entrusted to the [[National Assembly of Thailand]]. All bills passed by the legislature, however, require his royal assent to become law. The monarchy's household and finances are managed by the [[Bureau of the Royal Household]] and the [[Crown Property Bureau]] respectively, these agencies are not considered part of the Thai government and all personnel are appointed by the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/thailand/government/thailand_government_the_king.html |title=Thailand The King – Flags, Maps, Economy, History, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System |publisher=Photius.com |date=28 December 1972 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The junta which took power in 2014 has been aggressive in jailing critics of the monarchy. In 2015, it spent US$540 million, more than the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on a promotional campaign called "Worship, protect and uphold the monarchy." The campaign includes television commercials, seminars in schools and prisons, singing contests, and competitions to write stories and films praising the king. "This is not propaganda," [[Prayut Chan-o-cha]], the leader of the junta, said. "The youth must be educated on what the king has done."&lt;ref name=NYT20150920&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fuller|first1=Thomas|title=With King in Declining Health, Future of Monarchy in Thailand Is Uncertain|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/world/with-king-in-declining-health-future-of-monarchy-in-thailand-is-uncertain.html?_r=1|accessdate=22 September 2015|work=The New York Times|date=2015-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its fiscal year 2016 budget, the ruling military government has increased its expenditure for "upholding, protecting and preserving the monarchy" to 18 billion baht (US$514 million), an increase of 28 percent for this budget line item since 2014 when it took power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=For Thailand, a portrait is crucial to preparations for succession|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/for-thailand-a-portrait-is-crucial-to-preparations-for-succession|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=Straits Times|date=2016-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal regalia==
{{main|Coronation of the Thai monarch}}
[[File:Royal Regalia of Siam.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The royal regalia of Thailand is made up of five principal items.]]
The present set of [[royal regalia of Thailand]] (Khrueang Raja Kakudhabhand, {{lang-th|เครื่องราชกกุธภัณฑ์)}} and the royal utensils was created mostly during the reign of King Rama I and Rama IV, after the previous set was lost during the sack of Ayutthaya by the Burmese in 1767. The regalia is used mainly during the [[coronation]] ceremony of the king at the beginning of every reign. The regalia is presently on display in the Museum of the [[Grand Palace]] in Bangkok.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/threeb.rm/regalia.html |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=27 October 2009 |accessdate=5 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091027073704/http://geocities.com/threeb.rm/regalia.html |archivedate=27 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="60celebrations"&gt;Thai Government Public Relations: [http://thailand.prd.go.th/60th/royal_utensil.php?PHPSESSID=bbd4c7793853bd5ce0fdc2a51109a0e6 Royal Regalia + Royal Utensils.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The TRNC declared independence in 1983, nine years after a Greek Cypriot [[coup d'état|coup]] attempting to annex the island to Greece triggered [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|an invasion]] by [[Turkey]]. It has received [[Embassy of Turkey in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus|diplomatic recognition]] only from Turkey, on which it is dependent for economic, political and military support. The rest of the international community, including the United Nations and European Union, recognises the sovereignty of the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] over the whole island.

'''Paul De Grauwe''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈpʌul də ˈɣrʌuə}}; born 18 July 1946) is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[economics|economist]] and [[John Paulson]] Professor in European Political Economy at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] as head of the European Institute. He is also [[professor emeritus]] in [[international economics]] at [[KU Leuven]] and former member of the [[Belgian Federal Parliament]].

== Education and career ==

De Grauwe studied [[economics]] at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] from 1964 until 1969. Having received a scholarship from the [[Fulbright Commission Belgium|Belgian Fulbright Commission]], De Grauwe obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD degree]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1973. He started to work as an intern at the [[European Economic Community]] in 1969 and later went on to become a research assistant, and subsequently a professor at the Center for Economic Studies of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.

In 1973 De Grauwe began to work as an economist at the [[International Monetary Fund]] and accepted positions at the [[Centre for European Policy Studies]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceps.eu/member/paul-de-grauwe Member CEPS], CEPS - The Centre for European Policy Studies, Retrieved January 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Central Bank]]. He has also been professor at the [[College of Europe]], the [[Free University of Berlin]], and the [[Norwegian School of Management]]. Furthermore, he has been a [[visiting scholar]] at the [[University of Michigan]], [[Tilburg University]], the [[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]], [[University of Kiel]], [[Bank of Japan]], [[Université libre de Bruxelles]], [[University of Saarbrücken]], [[Ghent University]], the [[Catholic University of Portugal]], the [[Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System]], [[University of Amsterdam]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], and [[Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore]]. In addition, De Grauwe has been given doctoral [[honorary degree]]s at the [[University of St Gallen]], the [[university of Valencia]], the [[Turku School of Economics|Turku School of Economics and Business Administration]] and the [[University of Genoa]].&lt;ref name="CV Paul De Grauwe"&gt;[http://www.econ.kuleuven.be/ew/academic/intecon/Degrauwe/CV-PDG-2008.pdf Curriculum Vitae: Paul De Grauwe], Faculty of Economics - KU Leuven, Retrieved 15 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul De Grauwe LSE"&gt;[http://www2.lse.ac.uk/europeanInstitute/staff/academicStaff/DeGrauwe/Home.aspx Academic staff - Paul De Grauwe], London School of Economics and Political Science, Retrieved 15 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1991-1995 and 1999-2003, Paul De Grauwe was a member of the [[Senate (Belgium)|Belgian Senate]], and from 1995 until 1999 he became a member of parliament in the [[Chamber of Representatives (Belgium)|Belgian Chamber of Representatives]].  In both houses of parliament he was part of the [[Flemish Liberals and Democrats]].&lt;ref name="CV Paul De Grauwe"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senate.be/www/?MIval=/showSenator&amp;ID=39&amp;LANG=nl Paul De Grauwe - VLD], Senate of the Belgian Kingdom, Retrieved January 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

He is editor of various economic [[academic journals]] and a former member of the Group of Economic Policy Analysis advising the [[European Commission]] President [[José Manuel Barroso]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/dgs/policy_advisers/experts_groups/gepa_en.htm Group of Economic Policy Analysis (GEPA)], Bureau of European Policy Advisers (BEPA), Retrieved January 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as director of the money, macro and international finance research network of CESifo at the [[University of Munich]].&lt;ref name="Paul De Grauwe LSE"/&gt; He has had a column in the [[Financial Times]]. Belgian media often make use of his expertise when dealing with current economic affairs, primarily with regard to European economic and monetary issues. Besides hundreds of scientific articles, he has published various books as well. Furthermore, he is co-editor and author of economic textbooks in both Dutch and English. He is the author of ''The Economics of Monetary Union'', which was translated in ten languages.&lt;ref name="Paul De Grauwe LSE"/&gt; From December 2011 until May 2012, De Grauwe served as member of the [[Jacques Delors Institute]]’s Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa group, a high-level expert group to reflect on the reform of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delorsinstitute.eu/011-3024-Tommaso-Padoa-Schioppa-Group.html Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa Group] [[Jacques Delors Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, De Grauwe reached the [[retirement age|legal age]] for [[mandatory retirement]] in Belgium, after which he was offered the [[John Paulson]] Chair in European Political Economy at the [[London School of Economics and Political Science]] and retired from his position at the University of Leuven. He has expressed his discontent with the legal retirement age: ''I felt disparaged, like an old machine in a factory. Our [Belgian] legislation says: "you have become economically worthless," but I also felt struck in my identity as a person. You have to give people the freedom of choice if they want to continue working after their 65th [birthday], end of story. I understand those who feel exhausted and quit, but I wanted to continue functioning academically and this wasn't an option here [in Belgium].''&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.vacature.com/blog/paul-de-grauwe-65-afgeschreven-in-belgi-topper-in-londen Paul De Grauwe (65): Afgeschreven in België, topper in Londen], Vacature.com, Published on 22 June 2012.

==Recognition==
In May 2013, De Grauwe was awarded the [[Arkprijs van het Vrije Woord]] (Ark Prize of Free Speech).&lt;ref name="Paul De Grauwe Arkprijs"&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.standaard.be/cnt/DMF20130327_00519771 Paul De Grauwe wint Arkprijs van het Vrije Woord], De Standaard, Retrieved May 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Market ideology ==

As a [[liberalism|liberal]] and advocate of the [[free market]] De Grauwe has long time been a strong proponent of the [[market economy]] and [[globalisation]]. In ''De onvoltooide globalisering'' (''The Uncompleted Globalisation''), written for a broader audience, he explains why he favors globalisation and discusses the statements of [[anti-globalization movement|anti-globalists]], which he finds somewhat pessimistic. He sees himself as an optimist and believes that market forces and economic growth will offer a solution to the issues related to natural resources, energy, environment and climate. However, De Grauwe has recently pointed out the necessity of government in this market economy. He said he used to uphold financial markets as bearers of the truth but now acknowledges that it is a world where rationality is intertwined with emotions. In an interview, he stated that certain entities are needed to correct market forces. Because of the [[Great Recession|global financial crisis]], the need to correct the market is greater today than before. For this reason his acknowledgement of a strong government has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.econ.kuleuven.be/eng/ew/Articles%20press/2011/PDG_De%20Morgen_221011_p42.pdf 'Was ik 25, dan stond ik nu op Wall Street mee te betogen'], Faculty of Economics - KU Leuven, Retrieved 15 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.demorgen.be/dm/nl/3324/Financiele-crisis/article/detail/1350346/2011/11/18/Paul-De-Grauwe-geeft-foute-ideeen-over-financiele-markten-toe.dhtml Paul De Grauwe geeft foute ideeën over financiële markten toe], De Morgen, Retrieved January 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Gibraltar}}
The '''Gibraltar Reform Party''' was a political party in [[Gibraltar]]. It was a [[left-wing politics|left]]-leaning party which described itself as [[green movement|green]] and for [[social justice]].

Originally formed as the '''Independent Liberal Forum''' on 21 March 2000, the name was subsequently changed to the later one. The last party leader was Lyana Armstrong-Emery.

The party's broad aim was a decentralisation of power. On the [[Disputed status of Gibraltar|constitutional status of Gibraltar]], the party supported a new status, calling for Gibraltar's establishment as a devolved autonomous territory, integrated within a decentralised [[federation|federal]] Britain. The party also called for the creation of a local [[Gibraltar Parliament|Parliament for Gibraltar]], a Member of Parliament (MP) to sit in the [[British House of Commons]] in [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], and a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP) to represent Gibraltar in the [[European Parliament]].

The Reform Party forged links with both the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] and [[Mebyon Kernow]]. Lyana Armstrong-Emery was voted by the party to take the position on the joint list agreed with the Green Party for the European Elections.

The party ceased operations in 2005 owing to a failure to garner wide public support.

'''Slovakia''' first attempted to enter the '''Eurovision Song Contest in 1993''' in [[Millstreet]], [[Ireland]], but were unsuccessful in qualifying.

Slovak broadcaster [[Slovenská televízia|Slovenská Televízia]] (STV) selected Slovak band [[Elán (band)|Elán]] to represent the country for the first time in [[Eurovision Song Contest]] history. The song that represented Slovakia in [[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet]] was "Amnestia na neveru" ("Amnesty to infidelity").

== At Kvalifikacija za Millstreet ==
{{main|Kvalifikacija za Millstreet}}
With the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] and the disintegration of Yugoslavia many newly independent countries were formed who became interested in competing in the Eurovision Song Contest. With this large influx of countries the European Broadcasting Union were forced to create a new measure to counter overcrowding in the contest. For the 1993 Contest the EBU decided to hold a one-off countest to select three countries to join the 22 countries already competing in the Eurovision Song Contest.

The independently recognised countries of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Eurovision Song Contest|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Croatia]], [[Estonia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Estonia]], [[Hungary in the Eurovision Song Contest|Hungary]], [[Romania in the Eurovision Song Contest|Romania]], [[Slovakia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Slovakia]], and [[Slovenia in the Eurovision Song Contest|Slovenia]], took part at the Kvalifikacija za Millstreet which was held at the [[Radiotelevizija Slovenija|RTV SLO]] Broadcasting Centre in [[Ljubljana]], Slovenia on 3 April 1993.  Slovakia performed 7th in the running order, following Slovenia. Elán received 50 points for their song and performance, placing 4th, thereby failing to qualify.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the show|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=235#About the show|work=Eurovision Song Contest 1993|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=18 September 2012|date=16 May 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5744">'''Stefania Follini''' (born 16 August 1961) is an Italian [[interior design]]er. She is known for being involved in a 1989 experiment on [[circadian rhythm]]s, in which she voluntarily isolated herself for four months in an underground room thirty feet down a [[cave]] in [[Carlsbad, New Mexico]], away from all outside indications of night and day.&lt;ref name="New York 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/24/us/after-130-days-of-cave-life-a-return-to-glare-of-the-sun.html |title=After 130 Days of Cave Life, A Return to Glare of the Sun |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 24, 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The experiment lasted from January 13, 1989, till May 22, 1989. In total, Follini spent some 130 days in the cave, thus breaking the women's world record for longest cave isolation.

==Career==
Hailing from [[Ancona]], Italy, Follini worked as an interior decorator. Out of 20 candidates, Follini was chosen for the experiment because she possessed an "introspective nature" and "mental discipline".&lt;ref name="Chicago 1"/&gt; At that time, she was 27 years old.&lt;ref name="Chicago 1"/&gt;

===The experiment===
The scientific experiment commenced on January 13, 1989.&lt;ref name="Chicago 1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-05-24/news/8902030743_1_maurizio-montalbini-researchers-stefania-follini |title=No Light, Voices For 131 Days, But The Mice Were Friendly |last=Weingartem |first=Paul |date=May 24, 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was organised by Pioneer Frontier Explorations&lt;ref name="Time 1"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |title=The Times of Your Life |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,151968,00.html |date=June 24, 2001 |first=Anastasia |last=Toufexis }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NASA]].&lt;ref name="AP 1"/&gt; It took place in the "Lost Cave" in New Mexico.&lt;ref name="Horrible 1"/&gt; Inside her twenty by twelve foot [[acrylic glass]] room, away from all cues to the normal 24-hour daily cycle, her biological clock drifted away from its regular rhythm to following first a 28-hour day,&lt;ref name="Horrible 1"/&gt; and later on a 48-hour one.&lt;ref name="Time 1"/&gt; She started staying awake for up to more than twenty hours and sleeping up to ten hours at a time.

With her slowed-down daily cycle, her meals were more spread out and she lost {{convert|17|lb|kg|}} in weight.&lt;ref name="Philly 1"/&gt; Follini was most of the time fed beans and rice, which partially resulted in her losing [[Vitamin D]].&lt;ref name="AP 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/After-130-Days-in-a-Cave-Italian-Woman-Says-She-d-Return/id-40a98ef59e0ead5b4f6a17a534583d22 |title=AFTER 130 DAYS IN A CAVE, ITALIAN WOMAN SAYS SHE'D RETURN |last=Allen |first=Caroline |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=June 7, 1989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She reported that at one point her [[menstrual cycle]] had stopped.

The '''Sultanate of Arababni''' (also known as '''Arbabni''' or '''Arabini''') was a small [[Gurage people|Gurage]] Islamic sultanate located in what is now the [[Arsi Zone]] of [[Ethiopia]]. Founded around the 12th century, it was the smallest and weakest of the Muslim kingdoms described by the Islamic geographers [[al-Umari]] and [[al-Makrizi]].&lt;ref&gt;Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia: Collected Essays By Ulrich Braukämper&lt;/ref&gt;

== Location ==
Fetegar (and thus, Arbabni) is the region southeast of the modern capital [[Addis Ababa]], essentially corresponding to the modern [[Arsi Zone]]. The Oromo migrations led to the region being renamed for the third time to Arsi, after the Arsi Oromo.

== Campaigns of Ahmed Gurey ==
The Fetegar region, being one of the former independent Muslim states in the region, was a primary target of the jihad of [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] (Ahmed Gurey), Imam of the [[Adal Sultanate]].

== End of Arbabni ==
During the reign of Emperor [[Amda Seyon I]], Arbabni was conquered and annexed by [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] and would become the Fetegar province. Fetegar was occupied by Arsi Oromo during the [[Oromo migrations]] and would become part of [[Arsi Province]], and what is now [[Arsi Zone]].

"'''The Howling Man'''" is episode 41 of the [[American television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|The Twilight Zone]]''. It originally aired on November 4, 1960 on [[CBS]].

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|The prostrate form of Mr. David Ellington, scholar, seeker of truth and, regrettably, finder of truth. A man who will shortly arise from his exhaustion to confront a problem that has tormented mankind since the beginning of time. A man who knocked on a door seeking sanctuary and found, instead, the outer edges of The Twilight Zone.}}

==Plot==
The story is told in a [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]] by an American named David Ellington. While on a walking trip through post–[[World War I]] [[Europe]] (circa 1925), Ellington becomes lost in a storm. He sees a building, and walks towards it. It turns out to be a castle, which is now the home of an order of Brothers  (Wolfring Castle, referred to in the episode as the "Hermitage") near the village of Schwarzwald. He knocks, the door opens, and he pleads for help. He is told by the monk who opens the door that they cannot give him shelter and that he must leave immediately. Ellington pleads for sanctuary from the storm, and, while waiting in the front hall to see if he can stay there, hears a disturbing wolf-like howl coming from somewhere in the castle. He meets Brother Jerome, who asks his purpose. After he explains, Brother Jerome regretfully announces  that they cannot help him. Ellington reluctantly turns to leave, but only gets as far as the doorway before collapsing. When he awakens, he is inside the castle. 

Upon waking inside the castle, Ellington hears the howling again and investigates. He finds a bedraggled man in a cell. The man claims to be a prisoner of an insane religious order, locked up because he kissed his sweetheart in public, and beaten by Jerome using the staff he carries.

Ellington is seen talking to the prisoner and is taken to the leader of the order, Brother Jerome. When Brother Jerome refuses to explain the man in the cell, Ellington says he will leave, but also threatens to go to the police and tell them about the man in the cell. Brother Jerome, realizing that Ellington's threat might set the prisoner free,  then reveals the truth:  that the prisoner is not a man, but rather the [[Devil]] himself, and can only be controlled by the "Staff of Truth", which Jerome has. He had come to the village shortly after World War I to corrupt it, but Jerome had recognized him for what he was and used the staff to imprison him. His actions have given the world five years of relative peace, with only the evils created by mankind itself. Now convinced that Jerome is insane, Ellington pretends to believe the incredible story. Jerome is not fooled, however, and assigns another brother to watch him.

Ellington waits until his guard falls asleep, then creeps down to the cell. Seeing that the door is held shut only by a staff that is within reach of the imprisoned man, Ellington briefly wonders why he has not simply removed it himself. At the man's urging, Ellington removes the staff. The prisoner exits the cell&amp;mdash;and pins Ellington to the floor with a wave of his hand from across the hall. As he walks toward the exit, he begins to change, taking on more and more of the appearance of the Devil with each step, before departing the castle in a plume of smoke. Jerome arrives, realizes what has happened, and sadly explains that the inability to recognize the devil has always been Man's great weakness.

The flashback ends. Ellington has been telling the story to a maid. He says that ever since then he has been hunting for the devil to atone for his mistake, through [[World War II]], the [[Korean War]], and the development of [[nuclear weapon]]s. He has finally succeeded; he has him locked in a closet barred by a similarly shaped staff, and he intends to return him to the castle and Brother Jerome's keeping. He warns the skeptical housekeeper not to remove the staff under any circumstances while he goes to make his final preparations. As soon as Ellington leaves, the maid hears a howl from behind the door and in her curiosity removes the staff, allowing the door to slowly open.

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|Ancient folk saying: "You can catch the Devil, but you can't hold him long." Ask Brother Jerome. Ask David Ellington. They know, and they'll go on knowing to the end of their days and beyond - in the Twilight Zone.}}

==Cast==
*[[H.M. Wynant]] as David Ellington
*[[John Carradine]] as Brother Jerome
*[[Robin Hughes]] as The Howling Man
*[[Frederic Ledebur]] as Brother Christophorus
*[[Ezelle Poule]] as Housekeeper

==Production==
This was the first aired episode of the second season that was not written by Rod Serling.

[[Charles Beaumont]] had originally envisioned that the monks would keep the Devil imprisoned by putting a cross in front of his cell door. Fearful of a backlash in the religious community, the producers substituted the "staff of truth" over Beaumont's objections.

'''USA-100''', also known as '''GPS IIA-15''', '''GPS II-24''' and '''GPS SVN-36''', is an [[United States|American]] [[navigation satellite]] which forms part of the [[Global Positioning System]]. It was the fifteenth of nineteen [[GPS Block IIA|Block IIA]] GPS satellites to be launched.

USA-100 was launched at 03:40:01 UTC on 10 March 1994, atop a [[Delta II]] carrier rocket, flight number D226, flying in the 7925-9.5 configuration.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/launchlog.txt|title=Launch Log|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The launch took place from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 17|Launch Complex 17A]] at the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]],&lt;ref name="lvdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/list2.html|title=Launch List|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|work=Launch Vehicle Database|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed USA-100 into a transfer orbit. The satellite raised itself into [[medium Earth orbit]] using a [[Star-37XFP]] [[apogee motor]].&lt;ref name="GSP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/navstar-2a.htm|title=GPS-2A (Navstar-2A)|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 April 1994, USA-100 was in an orbit with a [[apsis|perigee]] of {{convert|19986|km}}, an [[apsis|apogee]] of {{convert|20315|km}}, a [[orbital period|period]] of 716.69 minutes, and 54.9 degrees of [[inclination]] to the equator.&lt;ref name="satcat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planet4589.org/space/log/satcat.txt|title=Satellite Catalog|publisher=Jonathan's Space Page|first=Jonathan|last=McDowell|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It broadcasts the PRN 06 signal, and operates in slot 1 of plane C of the GPS constellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/project/navstar.htm|title=Navstar|publisher=[[Encyclopedia Astronautica]]|first=Mark|last=Wade|accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The satellite has a mass of {{convert|1816|kg}}. It had a design life of 7.5 years,&lt;ref name="GSP"/&gt; but it remained in service until February 2014, shortly after the launch of [[USA-248]].
