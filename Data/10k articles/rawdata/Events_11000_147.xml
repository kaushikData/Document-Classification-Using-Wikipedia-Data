      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2344">The '''2001 Humber Refinery explosion''' was a major incident at the then [[Conoco]]-owned [[Humber Refinery]] at [[South Killingholme]] in [[North Lincolnshire]], England. A large explosion occurred on the Saturate Gas Plant area of the site on [[Easter Monday]], 16 April 2001 at approximately 2:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. There were no fatalities, but two people were injured.&lt;ref&gt; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1281221.stm Major blast at oil refinery] -
BBC News Online&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
The incident temporarily shut down the entire refinery and caused oil prices to increase. Damage was caused to the nearby villages of [[North Killingholme|North]] and [[South Killingholme]] as well as the nearby town of Immingham - mainly doors being blown from their hinges and windows being blown in.

==HSE investigation==
[[ConocoPhillips]] (now [[Phillips 66]]) was investigated and subsequently fined £895,000 and ordered to pay £218,854 costs by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] for failing to effectively monitor the degradation of the refinery's pipework. The company pleaded guilty to these charges in court and has since implemented a [[Risk Based Inspection]] programme.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2005/e05089.htm ConocoPhillips Ltd fined] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216234256/http://www.hse.gov.uk/press/2005/e05089.htm |date=2007-02-16 }} -

The '''2005 Summer Universiade''', also known as the XXIII Summer [[Universiade]], took place in [[İzmir]], [[Turkey]].

==Emblem==
The emblem is the letter “U”, inspired by the bird’s-eye view of the Gulf of İzmir. This shape has perfectly fit the letter “U” of Universiade, symbolizing its multi-cultural feature, while the smooth outline emphasizes the harmony and uniformity of the Universiade spirit.

==Mascot==
Name: EFE

Efes are the leaders and heroes of societies that lived in Western Anatolia during the early nineties. The village dandy Efe, guards and defends all the members of his society and also deals with all kinds of their social work and events as if he is the father of all. For this reason, all the members of the society behave respectfully towards him with strong, emotional, family ties. The Efes were legends in these areas with their smart, fearless, alert dashing behaviors as brave and manly young fellows. They became the symbol of braveness, power and justice throughout the Aegean history.

Nowadays, the word “Efe” is the explanation of a virtuous, brave man who is the symbol of justice in every case. Therefore, we call successful athletes “Efe” stating their various qualifications in one brief word.

The '''2B1 Conference''' was held in 1997 at the [[MIT Media Lab]] with the purpose of circumventing technology barriers between the [[Developed country|developed]] and [[Third World|developing World]].  A core premise was that young people tend to learn computers faster than adults, thus, it is imperative the young populations of developing countries get access to computers so that as they grow up, they can interact with the rest of the World and encourage more social and economic prosperity.  Many concepts preceding the [[One Laptop Per Child]] project were discussed at the 2B1 Conference.&lt;ref&gt;Early history of the OLPC project.  http://www.olpcnews.com/people/negroponte/negropontism_a_cm1_t.html Early history&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2B1 Conference was also the birthplace of [[Nation1]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nation1''. http://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/Wired/WIRED5-12.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21045">The '''Abyssinia Crisis''' was a [[international crisis|crisis]] in [[1935]] originating in what was called the [[Welwel, Ethiopia|Walwal]] incident in the then-ongoing conflict between the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] and the [[Empire of Ethiopia]] (then commonly known as "[[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]" in Europe). The [[League of Nations]] ruled against Italy and voted for economic sanctions, but they were not fully applied. Italy ignored the sanctions, quit the League, made special deals with Britain and France and ultimately established control of Ethiopia. The crisis discredited the League and moved Fascist Italy closer to an alliance with [[Nazi Germany]].

Both Ethiopia and Italy pursued a policy of provocation against each other and Italy prepared for invasion in Ethiopia, described as follows by the League of Nations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At places where there is not a single Italian national, a consul establishes himself in an area known as consular territory with a guard of about ninety men, for whom he claims jurisdictional immunity. This is an obvious abuse of consular privileges. The abuse is all the greater that the consul's duties, apart from the supplying of information of a military character, take the form of assembling stocks of arms, which constitute a threat to the peace of the country, whether from the internal or the international point of view.&lt;ref&gt;''League of Nations Official Journal'', 1935, 1601. Quoted G.T.Garratt, ''Mussolini's Roman Empire'', Penguin Books, April 1938, pp.46–47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The Walwal incident==

The Italo–Ethiopian Treaty of 1928 stated that the border between [[Italian Somaliland]] and Ethiopia was twenty-one [[League (unit)|league]]s from and parallel to the Benadir coast (approximately {{convert|73.5|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}}). In 1930, Italy built a fort at the Walwal oasis (also Welwel, Italian: Ual-Ual) in the Ogaden, well beyond the twenty-one league limit.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}} The fort was in a boundary zone between the nations, which was not well defined; today it is about {{convert|130|km|abbr=on}} inside Ethiopia.

On 29 September 1934, Italy and Abyssinia released a joint statement renouncing any aggression against each other.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 22 November 1934, a force of 1,000 Ethiopian militia with three ''fitaurari'' (Ethiopian military-political commanders) arrived near Walwal and formally asked the [[Dubats]] garrison stationed there (comprising about 60 soldiers) to withdraw from the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Domenico Quirico| title = Lo Squadrons Bianco |isbn=88-04-50691-1 |page=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Somali NCO leading the garrison refused to withdraw and alerted Captain Cimmaruta, commander of the garrison of Uarder, {{convert|20|km}} away, to what had happened.&lt;ref&gt;Quirico. p. 271&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day, in the course of surveying the border between [[British Somaliland]] and Ethiopia, an Anglo–Ethiopian boundary commission arrived at Walwal. The commission was confronted by a newly arrived Italian force. The British members of the boundary commission protested, but withdrew to avoid an international incident. The Ethiopian members of the boundary commission, however, stayed at Walwal.&lt;ref name="Shinn, p. 392"&gt;Shinn, p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 5 and 7 December, for reasons which have never been clearly determined, there was a skirmish between the garrison of Somalis, who were in Italian service, and a force of armed Ethiopians. According to the Italians, the Ethiopians attacked the Somalis with rifle and machine-gun fire.&lt;ref&gt;Quirico. p. 272&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Ethiopians, the Italians attacked them, supported by two tanks and three aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;Barker. ''The Rape of Ethiopia 1936''. Pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, approximately 107 Ethiopians{{refn|According to Mockler, 107 Ethiopians were killed and 40 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;Mockler, p.46.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} and 50 Italians and Somalis were killed.{{refn|According to [[Time Magazine]], 110 Ethiopians were killed and 30 Italians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, ''Provocations''.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}}

Neither side did anything to avoid confrontation; the Ethiopians repeatedly menaced the Italian garrison with the threat of an armed attack, while the Italians sent two planes over the Ethiopian camp. One of them fired a short machine gun burst, which no one on the ground noticed, after the pilot saw Captain Cimmaruta in the midst of the Ethiopians and thought he had been taken prisoner by them.&lt;ref&gt;Quirico. pp. 268–271&lt;/ref&gt;

==International response and subsequent actions==

''' 'Treaties or scraps of paper?' '''

To the Editor of ''The Daily Telegraph''

Sir,

Last Saturday's leading article on “Abyssinia: Our Duty” is welcome indeed after the advice liberally offered to the Emperor of Abyssinia by some sections of the English Press, urging him to submit to Italy, not because the Italian blackmail is just, but because it would be so inconvenient for ourselves if he resisted.

We might be called on to do more than lip-service to the League; and how extravagant would that be!

Twenty-one years ago, when the consequences of honouring our obligations were far more menacing, we were indignant enough at the suggestion that treaties were, after all, only “scraps of paper.” But geography plays strange tricks with justice.
Italy is breaking at least three solemn pledges in her aggression on a fellow member of the League – the very type of aggression that the League was created to prevent: but many of us do not find it matters very much. The League has not yet called on us; but there are already plenty of voices busy finding pretexts for us to shuffle out of the whole thing.

It is not our duty to defend Abyssinia single-handed – no-one has suggested it; but it is our duty, if covenants mean anything whatsoever, to oppose this piece of brigandage at Geneva, and after. It is our duty to be concerting with whatever Powers retain some decency, particularly the United States, what measures may be needed.

Europe has at its disposal sanctions that Italy could not defy, provided we have the courage to use them. But instead of that the English Press, with a few honourable exceptions, has been taken up with nauseating discussion of our own interests. Later on, one gathers, we shall be very firm with Italy about the water of Lake Tana. Meanwhile, Ethiopian blood is a cheaper commodity.

If this is to be the way of our world, why make treaties at all? Let us at least have the courage of our cynicism. Let us have done with covenants, since they no longer serve to deceive anybody. Let us have done with the League, since “collective security” means simply the security of those strong enough to be secure. And then, if we perish in the chaos for which the world is heading, it will at least be without having canted to our last breath.

This jungle-law may have ruled between nations in the past; the time is rapidly approaching when either it ends or else the world. If the League cannot enforce one law for weak and strong, black and white, sooner or later we are finished. And if we flinch every time a test arises, we shall have deserved it.

On 6 December 1934, [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia|Emperor Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia protested Italian aggression at Walwal. On 8 December, Italy demanded an apology for Ethiopian aggression and, on 11 December, followed up this demand with another for financial and strategic compensation.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 3 January 1935, Ethiopia appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for arbitration of the dispute arising from the Walwal incident. But the league's response was inconclusive. A subsequent analysis by an arbitration committee of the League of Nations absolved both parties of any culpability for what had happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/publications/yearbooks/english/ilc_1978_v2_p1.pdf |title=Yearbook of the International Law Commission |accessdate=July 22, 2010| date=1978}} p. 184:"... these first incidents, following on that at Walwal, were accidental in character, while the others were for the most part not serious and not at all uncommon in the region in which they took place. In the circumstances, the {{sic|Comm|ision}} is of the opinion that there are no grounds for finding any international responsibility for these minor incidents."&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after Ethiopia's initial appeal, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] [[Pierre Laval]] of [[French Third Republic|France]] and [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Samuel Hoare]] of the [[United Kingdom]] met with Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] in [[Rome]].{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 7 January 1935, a meeting between Laval and Mussolini resulted in the "[[Franco–Italian Agreement]]". This treaty gave Italy parts of [[French Somaliland]] (now [[Djibouti]]), redefined the official status of Italians in French-held [[Tunisia]], and essentially gave the Italians a free hand in dealing with Ethiopia. In exchange, France hoped for Italian support against Germany.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 25 January, five Italian [[askaris]] were killed by Ethiopian forces near Walwal.&lt;ref name="Shinn, p. 392"/&gt;

On 10 February 1935, Mussolini mobilized two divisions.&lt;ref name="Shinn, p. 392"/&gt; On 23 February, Mussolini began to send large numbers of troops to [[Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somaliland]], which were the Italian colonies that bordered Ethiopia to the northeast and southeast, respectively. There was little international protest in response to this build-up.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 8 March, Ethiopia again requested arbitration and noted Italian military build-up. Three days later Italy and Ethiopia agreed on a neutral zone in the Ogaden. On 17 March, in response to continued Italian build-up, Ethiopia again appealed to the league for help. On 22 March, the Italians yielded to pressure from the League of Nations to submit to arbitration on the dispute arising from the Walwal incident, but continued to mobilize its troops in the region. On 11 May, Ethiopia again protested the ongoing Italian mobilization.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

Between 20 and 21 May, the League of Nations held a special session to discuss the crisis in Ethiopia. On 25 May, a league council resolved that it would meet if no fifth arbitrator had been selected by 25 June, or if a settlement was not reached by 25 August. On 19 June, Ethiopia requested neutral observers.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

From 23 to 24 June, the United Kingdom tried to quell the crisis, sending [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]] [[Anthony Eden]] to try to broker a peace agreement. The attempt was unsuccessful, and it became clear that Mussolini was intent on conquest. On 25 July, the United Kingdom imposed an embargo on arms sales to both Italy and Ethiopia. Many historians believe that the embargo was a response to Italy's decree that it would view arms sales to Ethiopia as an act of unfriendliness toward Italy while other observers believe that the United Kingdom was protecting her economic interests in East Africa.&lt;ref name="histireland"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McMahon|first1=Cian|journal=History Ireland|volume=10|issue=2|page=36|accessdate=16 November 2017|url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/eoin-oduffys-blueshirts-and-the-abyssinian-crisis/|title=Eoin O’Duffy’s Blueshirts and the Abyssinian crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom also cleared its warships from the [[Mediterranean]], allowing Italy further unhindered access to eastern Africa.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 25 June, Italian and Ethiopian officials met in [[the Hague]] to discuss arbitration. By 9 July, these discussions had fallen apart.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 26 July, the league confirmed that no fifth member of the arbitration panel had been selected. On 3 August, the League limited arbitration talks to matters other than the sovereignty of Walwal.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 12 August, Ethiopia pleaded for the arms embargo to be lifted. On 16 August, France and the United Kingdom offered Italy large concessions in Ethiopia to try to avert war, but Italy rejected the offers. On 22 August, Britain reaffirmed its commitment to the arms embargo.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 4 September, the league met again and exonerated both Italy and Ethiopia of any culpability in the Walwal incident,&lt;ref name="Shinn, p. 392"/&gt; on the ground that each nation had believed Walwal was within its own territorial borders. On 10 September, Pierre Laval, Anthony Eden, and even Sir Samuel Hoare agreed on limitations to sanctions against Italy.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 25 September, Ethiopia again asked for neutral observers.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 27 September, the British Parliament supported the initiative of [[Konni Zilliacus]] and unanimously authorized the imposition of sanctions against Italy should it continue its policy towards Ethiopia.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 28 September, Ethiopia began to mobilize its large but poorly equipped army.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On November 7, the Irish Free State passed the "League of Nations Bill", placing sanctions on Italy.&lt;ref name="histireland" /&gt;

==The war and occupation==
{{Main|Second Italo–Abyssinian War}}
On 3 October 1935, shortly after the league exonerated both parties in the Walwal incident, Italian [[armed forces]] from Eritrea [[De Bono's invasion of Abyssinia|invaded Ethiopia]] without a [[declaration of war]], prompting Ethiopia to declare war on Italy, thus beginning the [[Second Italo–Abyssinian War]].{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

On 7 October in what would come to be known as the [[Walter Alexander Riddell|Riddell Incident]], the League of Nations declared Italy to be the [[:wikt:aggressor|aggressor]], and started the slow process of imposing [[economic sanctions|sanctions]] on Italy. The sanctions were limited, however. They did not prohibit the provision of several vital materials, such as oil, and were not carried out by all members of the League.

The [[United States]], generally indifferent to the League of Nations' weak sanctions, increased its exports to Italy, and the United Kingdom and France did not take any serious action against Italy, such as blocking Italian access to the [[Suez Canal]].{{citation needed|date = November 2014}} Even Italy's use of chemical weapons and other actions that violated international norms did little to change the League's passive approach to the situation.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

In late December 1935, Hoare of the United Kingdom and Laval of France proposed the secret [[Hoare-Laval Plan]], which would have ended the war but allowed Italy to control large areas of Ethiopia. Mussolini agreed to the plan, but it caused an outcry in the United Kingdom and France when the plan was leaked to the media. Hoare and Laval were accused of betraying the Abyssinians, and both resigned. Their plan was dropped, but the perception spread that the United Kingdom and France were not serious about the principles of the league. The war continued, and Mussolini turned to German dictator [[Adolf Hitler]] for alliance.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}}

In March 1936, Hitler marched troops into the [[Rhineland]], which had been prohibited by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The French were now desperate to get Italian support against German aggression directly on their border, so would not take any further action with sanctions. France was prepared to give Abyssinia to Mussolini, so his troops were able to continue their war relatively unchallenged by the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Walsh ''GCSE Modern World History'' 2001, p 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Haile Selassie was forced into exile on 2 May. All the sanctions that had been put in place by the League were dropped after the Italian capture of the Ethiopian capital of [[Addis Ababa]] on the 5th of May 1936. Ethiopia was then merged with the other Italian colonies to become [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', or AOI).

Ethiopia never officially surrendered, and pleaded for help from foreign nations, such as Haile Selassie's [[s:Appeal to The League of Nations|7 June 1936 address to League of Nations]]. As a result, there were six nations which did not recognize Italy's occupation in 1937: China, New Zealand, the Soviet Union, the Republic of Spain, Mexico and the United States.{{citation needed|date = November 2014}} Italian control of Ethiopia was never total, due to continued guerrilla activity, which the British would later use to their advantage during [[World War II]]. However, by 1940 Italy was in complete control of three-quarters of the country.

==Aftermath==

The end of the AOI came quickly during World War II. In early 1941, as part of the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African Campaign]], [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] launched offensive actions against the isolated Italian colony. On 5 May 1941, five years after the [[March of the Iron Will|Italians had captured his capital]], Emperor Haile Selassie entered Addis Ababa.

There were also major impacts on the League of Nations:
* Hoare-Laval showed distrust of Britain and France themselves in the League
* Hitler began reversing the Treaty of Versailles (with the Rhineland remilitarisation)
* Britain and France looked weaker still, seen by Germany, Italy and the United States

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1476">'''Apple Chill''' is a [[festival]] in [[North Carolina]]. The event takes place in late April.  Food vendors, crafters and a kids zone attract more 10,000 people to the host city. The festival began in 1972 in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], where the name is a [[Spoonerism]].  It ran for over 30 years until 2006 when shootings forced the town to formally disband it.  The nickname "After Chill" was used to describe the drinking and cruising that continued late into the night after the festival was over.

From 2007 until 2010 the festival was held at the Roxboro Motorsports Dragway in [[Roxboro, North Carolina|Roxboro]].  Since 2011 the festival is held at the Fayetteville Motor Sports Park in [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]]. In 2015, the Apple Chill is being held at Roxboro Motorsports and the event is held the first Sunday in May each year. The Apple Chill was held in 2016 at Fayetteville Motorsports parkway on Sunday, May 8th. It was originally scheduled for the first Sunday in May but was rescheduled due to the anticipation of rain on Sunday, May 1st.

==Attractions==
The main event features drag racing as well as a parade of brightly colored motorcycles and cars. Many [[Jazz]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] acts conclude the event.

'''Blacksmith tokens''' are a form of evasion currency that was in circulation primarily in [[Lower Canada]] and [[Upper Canada]] along with neighboring areas, such as the northern parts of [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New England]] in the mid-1820 to 1830s. They were not, strictly speaking [[Counterfeit money|counterfeits]], but instead skirted around the laws of the time by being similar to officially circulating coinage, but bearing different legends, or bearing no legends or dates at all, so it could be claimed that they were truly imitating circulating coinage fully.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;3-4&lt;/ref&gt; The tokens were designed to resemble worn examples of English or Irish copper coinage, most often with a crude profile of either [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] or [[George III of Great Britain|George III]] in profile on the obverse and an image of [[Britannia#Coinage|Britannia]] or an [[Celtic harp|Irish harp]] on the reverse. They were typically underweight when compared to officially sanctioned [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpenny]] coinage, but were accepted along with many other unofficially issued tokens due to a lack of sufficient small denomination coinage in circulation at the time.

Most examples were issued in copper, with a few examples struck in brass. Due to the deliberately poor nature of the images carved into the dies for these tokens, it is rare for a Blacksmith token to be [[Sheldon coin grading scale|graded]] higher than ''Very Fine'', with most examples falling into a ''Good'' or ''Very Good'' grade. While first mentioned by noted Canadian [[Numismatics|numismatists]] Eugene Courteau and R.W. McLachlan, there were first fully described as a separate type of evasion currency by American numismatist Howland Wood with the publication of his pamphlet ''The Canadian Blacksmith Coppers'' in 1910. These coins, along with many other underweight copper tokens, were eventually driven out of circulation by the late 1830s as Canadian banks began to issue officially sanctioned copper tokens of the proper weight for their value.

It is not known how many of these coins were made, as the creators faced possible prosecution if they were discovered. Evidence from hoards suggest that some of the blacksmith tokens were relatively common, and examples of various Blacksmith coppers have been found during archaeological excavations along with other coinage contemporary to the 1830s in the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River Valley]] in [[Nova Scotia]],&lt;ref&gt;Kleeberg p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;/ref&gt; on the grounds of [[Fort York]] in [[Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;Kleeberg p.&amp;nbsp;166&lt;/ref&gt; and Place Royale in [[Quebec City]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleeberg p.&amp;nbsp;183&lt;/ref&gt;

The more common Blacksmith tokens can be had for about [[Canadian dollar|C$]]20-$30, while the rarer varieties for which only a handful or unique examples are known can command prices in the thousands of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;Evans p.&amp;nbsp;21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name Origin==
The name is derived from reference by R.W. McLachlan in an 1885 article about Canadian Numismatics, where he describes a specific coin of this series and says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Previous to 1837, when the lack of specie caused copper change to be accepted in bulk, there lived in Montreal a blacksmith of dissipated habits. He prepared a die for himself, and when he wished to have a "good time" he struck two or three dollars in these coppers, and thereby supplied himself with sufficient change with which to gratify his wishes.''&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan 1885 p.&amp;nbsp;85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While this description was intended to describe only a specific coin in the series, "blacksmith token" or "blacksmith copper" was the name that stuck, and was soon applied to all of these types of coins. While the rarer blacksmith tokens may well have been struck by a single person by hand, the large numbers of some of the more common tokens in this series suggests that some of them came from more professional minting operations. McLachlan stated that the numerous types of blacksmith tokens available and their quantity meant that they were either struck at several different establishments in quantity, or a large number came from one establishment which operated for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Grawey 2016 p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research points to the blacksmith tokens being created at various locations in Lower Canada, and possibly in Upper Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Grawey 2015 p.&amp;nbsp;16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Numismatic Study==
Individual coins in the Blacksmith token series were described by the Canadian numismatist R.W. McLachlan in articles dating back to the mid-1880s, and several examples were also included in [[Pierre-Napoléon Breton]]'s extensive catalog of Canadian colonial tokens.&lt;ref&gt;Cross p.&amp;nbsp;206&lt;/ref&gt; Numismatist Eugene Courteau was the first to notice design similarities between several of these coins, and documented them in an article published in ''The Numismatist'' in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim p.&amp;nbsp;101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wood 11 and 12 Illustration.png|thumb|Wood's illustration for the Blacksmith tokens Wood 11 and Wood 12, the former depicting a crude Britannia figure combined with a profile of George III, and the latter the regal profile combined with an Irish harp.]]
Howland Wood published the first comprehensive study of the series in an article published ''The Numismatist'' in 1910, titled ''The Canadian Blacksmith Coppers'' (published later that same year as a pamphlet of the same name). He noted one characteristic that was common to the series, that they were created specifically to look like worn British half-pence coins. Another common feature to most of the Blacksmith coppers was that their designs were the opposite to that of the original coin being imitated. If the coin was imitating the bust of George III on its obverse, it would face left in the Blacksmith version whereas in the officially issued coinage it would face right. Wood believed that the reason for this was the inexperience of the die cutter, who created the die facing the same way as the original coin being imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; The reverse of many of these coins featured an image of Britannia who faced the opposite way from the original, though Wood notes that when the reverse featured a harp, it faced the same way as it did on the Irish regal coinage it was imitating.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these regal imitations were created using copper, though he notes a few that were done in [[brass]].&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; Though Wood had no conclusive proof, he thought the regal imitation Blacksmith tokens were created in the first quarter of the 19th century, noting a particular specimen that had been struck over a George IV half-penny of 1825, so clearly not struck before that date, and was likely struck sometime soon after that date.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; This has been further corroborated in more recent times with the discovery of a Blacksmith token that had been struck over an Upper Canadian token dating to 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Faulkner p.&amp;nbsp;259&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the Blacksmith tokens that imitated English and Irish regal coinage of George II and George III, Wood also pointed out a second series of Blacksmith tokens which he considered to be "curiosities and puzzles", consisting of [[Mule (coin)|mules]] that mixed up dies from various store card tokens with other crudely made dies.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; One of these mules includes dies made for a store card token that was released within the United States in 1835, meaning that the Blacksmith version could not have been issued prior to this date. Given that the banks of Upper and Lower Canada started issuing their own officially sanctioned tokens of the correct weight for their value in 1838, Wood believed this series of tokens must have been created between those dates.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; Wood also pointed out the relative scarcity of these Blacksmith tokens when compared to those imitating regal coinage, believing that they were issued in limited numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood counted 46 distinct varieties of Blacksmith tokens.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has shown that two of Wood's Blacksmith tokens are in fact worn imitation coppers of British origin, and a third token listed by Wood a copper variant made of brass is in fact made of copper.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim p.&amp;nbsp;101&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Oppenheim cataloging the auction of a prominent Blacksmith token collection added several more Blacksmith tokens and variants that were unknown to Wood;&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim p.&amp;nbsp;101&lt;/ref&gt; the Charlton catalog of Canadian Colonial Tokens lists 56 Blacksmith tokens and varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Cross p.&amp;nbsp;207&lt;/ref&gt; Blacksmith tokens are recognized as falling into specific categories based on the design they were imitating: those containing a regal profile, imitations of the Tiffin plus "Bust and Harp" tokens, those with blank reverse, imitations of the "Ships Colonies and Commerce Tokens", the "BITIT" Series, those based on worn Daniel and Benjamin True token dies, and other miscellaneous types.&lt;ref&gt;Willey p.&amp;nbsp;306-312&lt;/ref&gt;

Research continues in this area, the most recent contribution being by John Lorenzo who has done extensive [[X-ray fluorescence]] studies of various Blacksmith tokens in order to determine their metal composition. Some of his discoveries including finding that the [[Coin orientation|die axes]] described for some varieties in existing coin catalogs should be considered approximate, identifying additional sub-varieties to Wood 29 and Wood 38, and suggests that there are at least four major "families" of Blacksmiths whose production are linked based on the dies that were used.&lt;ref&gt;Lorenzo p.&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/ref&gt;

==='BITIT' Tokens===
[[File:Wood_33_Illustration.png|thumb|Wood's illustration of Wood 33, with indistinct legends for the tops of the letters along the circumference of the obverse and reverse.]]
The "BITIT" blacksmith tokens (Wood 33) is considered to be the most common of the Blacksmiths series,&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheim p.&amp;nbsp;102&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the most controversial in numismatic literature. The obverse contains the profile of George III with what Wood described as a "large pug nose",&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt; while the reverse has a seated Britannia holding a [[shamrock]]. Unlike most Blacksmith tokens, this coin features a legend on both sides, with the tops of the letters obscured by excessive die polishing, possibly done on purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Hoover p.&amp;nbsp;3281&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been considerable interpretation as to the reading of the legend of the token, as the missing top portion of its letters supports different readings. McLachlan interpreted the inscription on the obverse as saying "GLORIUVS III VIS",&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan 1885 p.&amp;nbsp;85&lt;/ref&gt; though some numismatists contemporary to McLachlan suggested that the "VIS" should instead be read as "VTS", which is claimed to be an abbreviated, Latin version for "Vermont". McLachlan refuted this claim, saying that he had "little doubt that this piece was struck and issued in Canada as an imitation of a George III copper".&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan 1885 p.&amp;nbsp;86&lt;/ref&gt; This argument has been picked up again in more recent numismatic studies, with one article affirming that an example graded as Fine reveals the "I" should be read as "T", supporting the "VTS" reading.&lt;ref&gt;Biancarosa p.&amp;nbsp;4184&lt;/ref&gt; An off-center strike of this Blacksmith token in the collection of the Bank of Canada Museum where the top portion of the supposed "T" ought to be more visible, but is not, contradicts this reading.&lt;ref&gt;NCC p.&amp;nbsp;86&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood thought that the obverse legend read "GLORIOVS III VIS".&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent article claims that several high-grade examples of the coin reveal a weak serif and cross-bar on the "L", and that the first "O" is thinner than the second, suggesting that the initial word of the legend should be read as "GEORIUVS" instead.&lt;ref&gt;Hoover p.&amp;nbsp;3281-3282&lt;/ref&gt; The legend on the obverse has been interpreted as reading as the nonsensical "BITIT",&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt; though one study claims that the "I" and "T" are instead an "R" and "I", making the word read "BRITI" instead, a short form for "BRITISH".&lt;ref&gt;Hoover p.&amp;nbsp;3282&lt;/ref&gt;

In his comprehensive listing of Blacksmith tokens, Wood included this in his "Miscellaneous and Doubtful" series, suggesting that it might be an imitation regal coin created in England, but sharing the common Blacksmith token characteristic of the regal bust facing the opposite way.&lt;ref&gt;Wood p.&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt; While McLachlan clearly thought that this coin was issued in Canada and was relatively plentiful, it is notable that it was not included in Breton's ''Illustrated History of Coins and Tokens Relating to Canada'', possibly because he thought it was a British import.&lt;ref&gt;Hoover p.&amp;nbsp;3279&lt;/ref&gt; While American numismatist [[John Howard Hickcox Sr.|John H. Hickcox]] believed the coin to have come from Vermont, the majority consensus of other mid-19th century U.S. Colonial numismatists omit the coin in their listings&lt;ref&gt;Leonard p.&amp;nbsp;4224&lt;/ref&gt; While the provenance of this coin is still debated, examples of this coin appearing in the hoard McLachlan described and archaeological finds in locations in Upper Canada, Lower Canada and New Brunswick establish that it circulated in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard p.&amp;nbsp;4224&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Campionato Italiano''', (Italian Championship), was a domestic championship which took place in [[Italy]] for between 1958 and 1963, for [[Formula Junior]] cars.  From 1964 onwards, the championship ran [[Formula Three]] specification cars instead.

==History==
Formula Junior was the traditionally been regarded as the first major stepping stone for F1 hopefuls, before the introduction of Formula Three - it is typically the first point in a driver's career at which most drivers in the series are aiming at professional careers in racing rather than being amateurs and enthusiasts.

Most notably in the latter years of the Campionato Italiano, it was dominated by one driver, who won three successive titles. Between 1961 and 1963, [[Geki (racing driver)|”Geki”]], won three titles, before taking the first [[Italian Formula Three]] title the following season, in 1964

== History ==

Originally named iMovieFest,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/enews/2002/features/imoviefest# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324023453/https://www.apple.com/enews/2002/features/imoviefest/# |archive-date=2011-03-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the competition changed its name to Campus MovieFest in 2003 with the expansion of the program to [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] and now includes all the major [[Atlanta]]-area schools.

Campus MovieFest became a worldwide film festival with the addition of [[Scotland]] in 2003 at [[University of St Andrews|The University of St. Andrews]]. CMF expanded to [[Boston]] and [[Florida]] in spring 2005. [[San Francisco]] area was added in the fall of 2005 with a [[UC Berkeley]] partnership.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14080">'''Cruising''' is a social activity that primarily consists of [[driving]] a car. Cruising can be an expression of the freedom of possessing a [[driver's license]]. Cruising is distinguished from regular driving by the social and recreational nature of the activity, which is characterized by an impulsively random, often aimless course. A popular route (or "[[Arterial road|strip]]") is often the focus of cruising. "Cruise nights" are [[evening]]s during which cars drive slowly. Another common form is a "Booze Cruise": this is where a group of people go out 'cruising' and drinking. A cruise can be a meeting of car enthusiasts at a predetermined location, organised predominantly through the internet (in recent times) but also largely through mobile phone, word of mouth or simply by a cruise being established enough that it becomes a regular event.

== United States ==
One of the oldest cruising strips is located on [[Whittier Boulevard]] in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]]. Cruising on this strip became a popular pastime among [[lowrider|lowriders]] during the 1940s before spreading to surrounding neighborhoods in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://iowahawk.typepad.com/bolus/2008/05/bajito-y-suavec.html |title= Bajito y Suavecito: Cinco de Mayo Ranfla Especial |date= May 5, 2008 |author= Iowahawk }}{{verify credibility|date= December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Van Nuys Boulevard]] in the central [[San Fernando Valley]] has been a popular cruising strip since the 1950s; the 1979 film ''[[Van Nuys Blvd. (film)|Van Nuys Blvd.]]'' depicted the cruising culture on the strip. Perhaps the most famous cruising strip (or main drag), however, is McHenry Avenue in [[Modesto, California]].  The cruising culture of the late 1950s and early 1960s was depicted in the [[film]] ''[[American Graffiti]]''. The film was set (but not actually filmed) in [[film director|director]] [[George Lucas]]'s home town of Modesto, which also hosts an annual "Graffiti Summer" celebration in the film's honor.

Cruising in [[Detroit]] was popular from the 1950s to the 1970s in the city's northern suburbs along [[M-1 (Michigan highway)|M-1]] (Woodward Avenue), from [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] north to [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]].&lt;ref name=genat&gt;{{cite book |last= Genat |first= Robert |year= 2010 |title= Woodward Avenue: Cruising the Legendary Strip |location= North Branch, MN |publisher= CarTech Books |pages= 15, 41, 90, 124–5 |isbn= 978-1-932494-91-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruising along Woodward reached its peak in the mid-1960s, with muscle car competitions that were covered by journalists from ''[[Car and Driver]]'', ''[[Motor Trend]]'', and ''[[CBS World News Roundup]]''. The cruising culture on Woodward Avenue faded in the 1970s when new car safety standards and higher gas prices altered American automotive design. Other popular cruising strips in the Detroit area include [[U.S. Route 24 in Michigan|US&amp;nbsp;24]] (Telegraph Road) from 12 Mile Road in Southfield to [[U.S. Route 16 in Michigan|Michigan Avenue]] in Dearborn, and [[M-3 (Michigan highway)|M-3]] (Gratiot Avenue) on the East Side. The [[Woodward Dream Cruise]] occurs on the third Saturday in August along the original cruising strip in Detroit's northern suburbs. The event is a tribute to the classic Woodward cruisers and attracts approximately 1 million people&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson |first=Elisha |date=August 22, 2010 |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20100822/NEWS13/100822026/1137/Weather-blamed-for-smaller-attendance-at-Dream-Cruise |title=Weather Blamed for Smaller Attendance at Dream Cruise |work=Detroit Free Press |issn=1055-2758 |accessdate=August 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6A4iUoWzK?url=http://www.freep.com/article/20100822/NEWS13/100822026/1137/Weather-blamed-for-smaller-attendance-at-Dream-Cruise |archivedate=August 21, 2012 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 40,000&amp;nbsp;muscle cars, street rods, and custom, collector, and special interest vehicles.

Cruising in the southwestern [[Minneapolis]] suburb of [[Hopkins, Minnesota]], was so popular in the late 1970s and early 1980s that people from all over the state of [[Minnesota]] traveled there to show off their cars.  It became such a phenomenon that a local TV station went there and did a piece for a locally produced news program, ''Twin Cities Today''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfXD6bmsjL0&amp;html5=1&amp;hd=1|title=Teenage Cruising in Downtown Hopkins, MN on Weekends Back in the 1970's and 1980's.|date=9 March 2012|work=YouTube|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dragging the Gut Festival]] is held each year on the fourth weekend of August (August 23–24, 2013)&lt;ref name="website"&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Dragging the Gut Festival Website at GutFest.com|url=http://www.GutFest.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the historic downtown of [[McMinnville, Oregon]].

[[Waukegan, Illinois]], has an annual summer cruising festival called "Scoopin' Genesee".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waukeganweb.net/julyevents.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712002403/http://www.waukeganweb.net/julyevents.html |archivedate=2009-07-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, some cities (such as [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]) began to consider cruising a traffic offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Diedrich |first= John |date= June 21, 2006 |url= http://www.legis.state.wi.us/lc/comtmats/old/07files/sb0296_20080218142218.pdf |title= Cruising is getting harder to defend |work= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |format= PDF }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=439322 |title= Cruisers' cars may be seized |work= Milwaukee Journal Sentinel |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060702212302/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=439322 |archivedate= 2006-07-02 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruises such as the one on [[International Drive]] in Orlando, Florida, from the early 1990s, were broken-up by city ordinance signs that stated what hours drivers could and could not turn around throughout the strip, which kept cruisers from turning around in u-turn areas during specific times at night or cruisers would be ticketed. Cruisers had to go to a light in order to turn around. Many cruisers saw this as a hassle and stopped going.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Local businesses enforced the signs, but paid the price in the long run, because cruisers would purchase goods, food and entertainment from many of the shops, attractions and restaurants set up along the drive. Some of the businesses in and around the area have closed down since the ban, due to poor sales afterwards.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

===Description===
There are two main types of cruise: regular cruises, also known as meets, and one-off cruises.  The events that take place are similar; cars meet in [[car park]]s, park up or cruise (drive slowly) around the car park while people socialise &amp;ndash; often meeting people from cruise websites, show off their cars and admire others' cars. If there is enough space there are often drag races, [[burnout (vehicle)|burnouts]], and [[Doughnut (driving)|doughnuts]].

A meet is a regular gathering, usually weekly or monthly, where the time and place is freely publicised and well known. It is becoming more common these days for these events to be referred to incorrectly as cruises.

===One-off cruises===
A one-off cruise is an event organised by a particular group of people or club which would usually be advertised through cruise websites.  The final destination of the cruise is often kept secret; it is known only to the convoy leaders in an attempt to keep the cruise unknown to the police. until there are a large enough numbers of people at the cruise to make it difficult to disperse.

One-off cruises tend to be larger than meets, but larger meets may have magazine attendance.  This type of cruise is increasing in recent times due to increased police interest in regular, established cruises.

Some large cruises operate a "[[convoy]]-only" policy.

===Locations===
Cruises are generally held in [[retail park]]s due to the large open car parks needed to accommodate high attendance numbers (sometimes more than 500 cars). Naturally, with many cruises situated in retail parks, most cruise locations are also in close proximity to fast food restaurants such as [[McDonald's]] or [[Burger King]].

=== Cruising and the law ===

Although cruising is often not a crime in itself, there are many illegal activities associated with it and as such cruises are often monitored by the police or even closed. The most commonly cited reasons for breaking up cruises are [[breach of the peace]], caused by loud [[Exhaust system|exhausts]] and sound systems disturbing local residents and dangerous driving (such as [[street racing]], burnouts and doughnuts). Police also claim that cruises are used as cover for drug dealing and are attended by stolen or otherwise illegal cars.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} More recently, police have been using [[asbo|ASBO]] laws which enable them to seize and impound cars if anti-social behaviour is taking place or if a group refuses to disperse from an area.

As a result of increased police powers, legal cruises have been established such as [[Weston Wheels]], although these tend to resemble car shows with camping, music stages and trade stalls.  This passive, organised nature often does not satisfy the desires of cruisers, so illegal cruising continues.

Many city councils have successfully placed court [[injunction]]s to prevent [[boy racers]] parking cars in areas that have been popular with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/news/Boy-racers-banned-Festival-Park/article-1281921-detail/article.html|title=Festival Park boy racer injunction granted by High Court - Stoke-on-Trent City Council - Staffordshire Police - Stoke Sentinel|work=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/news/ve-called-police-mum/article-1281747-detail/article.html|title=Festival Park injunction: 'I've called the police more than my own mum'|work=Stoke Sentinel|accessdate=31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Magazines ===

Cruising and modifying have long been represented in the commercial magazines [[Max Power (magazine)|Max Power]], [[Fast Car (magazine)|Fast Car]] and Redline.  In mid-2006, Max Power, the magazine that brought cruises to the forefront, abandoned the scene &amp;ndash; preferring to concentrate on "dream" cars such as [[Nissan Skyline]]s. Long-time rival Fast Car assumed Max Power's position and now covers multiple cruises across the UK in each edition.

The '''Mexican Dirty War''' ({{lang-es|Guerra Sucia}}) refers to the Mexican [[Theater (warfare)|theater]] of the [[Cold War]], an internal conflict between the Mexican [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]-ruled government, [[Winston M. Scott#Mexico station chief|backed by the US]], and left-wing student and guerrilla groups in the 1960s and 1970s under the presidencies of [[Gustavo Díaz Ordaz]], [[Luis Echeverría]] and [[José López Portillo]].&lt;ref name=Reuters1&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN05211466 |title=Rights group urges Mexico to resolve "dirty war" |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Evans |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB105/index.htm |title=The Dawn of Mexico's Dirty War |website=Gwu.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, government forces carried out disappearances, estimated at 1,200,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Reuters Editorial |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSN08316698 |title=Mexico looks for 'dirty war' graves on army base |publisher=[[Reuters]] |date=2008-07-08 |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; systematic torture, and "probable [[extrajudicial executions]]".&lt;ref name=informe /&gt;

The judicial investigation into State crimes against political movements was opened only until Vicente Fox's term (2000-2006), which created the Special Prosecutor's Office for Social and Political Movements of the Past (FEMOSPP). However, despite the fact that it has advanced in the knowledge of the historical facts, the FEMOSPP has not been able to finalize concrete legal ramifications against the main instigators of the dirty war.&lt;ref&gt;http://catarina.udlap.mx/u_dl_a/tales/documentos/lri/garcia_r_d/capitulo2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
The war was characterized by a backlash against the active student movement of the late 1960s which terminated in the [[Tlatelolco massacre]] at a 1968 student rally in [[Mexico City]],&lt;ref name=informe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/all/fuentes/documentos/informes/especiales/2001_Desapariciones70y80.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308021545/http://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/all/fuentes/documentos/informes/especiales/2001_Desapariciones70y80.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which 30 to 300 (official report, non-governmental sources claim thousands) students were killed, and by the [[Corpus Christi massacre]], a massacre of student demonstrators in Mexico City on June 10, 1971.&lt;ref name=Reuters1 /&gt;

There were several barely connected groups fighting against the government during this period. Among the most important, the [[Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre|September 23 Communist League]] was at the forefront of the conflict, active in several cities throughout Mexico, drawing heavily from [[Christian Socialist]] and Marxist student organizations. They carried out confrontations with Mexican security forces, several kidnappings, and attempted to kidnap [[Margarita López Portillo]], the sister of the president. In [[Guerrero]], the [[Party of the Poor (Mexico)|Party of the Poor]], ostensibly fighting against landholder impunity and oppressive police practices in rural areas, was led by the ex-teacher [[Lucio Cabañas]]; they carried out ambushes of the army and security forces and the abduction of Guerrero's governor-elect.&lt;ref name=informe /&gt;

The legalization of left-wing political parties in 1978 along with the amnesty of imprisoned and at large guerrillas caused a number of combatants to end militant struggle against the government. However, certain groups continued fighting, and the National Human Rights Commission states the hostilities continued into 1982.&lt;ref name=informe /&gt;

In June 2002, a report prepared for [[Vicente Fox]], the first president not from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) in 70 years, detailed the government's actions from 1964 to 1982. The report states, according to [[BBC News]], that the Mexican army "kidnapped, tortured, and killed hundreds of rebel suspects" in the period and accused the Mexican state of [[genocide]]. The Mexican Special Prosecutor claimed the report was overly biased against the military, and failed to detail crimes committed by rebels, which included [[kidnapping]]s, bank robberies, and assassinations.&lt;ref name=informe /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4755682.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; Mexico 'dirty war' crimes alleged |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2006-02-27 |accessdate=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a general consensus that the government's actions was blameworthy. Instead of ensuring the security of innocent civilians, [[State terrorism|it victimized them and killed them alike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/06/22/index.php?section=politica&amp;article=014n1pol|title=Sedena extendió acciones de la guerra sucia contra campesinos inocentes - La Jornada|first=La|last=Jornada|publisher=|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/estados/2015/08/16/desaparecidos-guerra-sucia-deja-480-victimas|title=Desaparecidos.

== Guerrilla groups ==
The year 1960 marked the beginning of a decade of terror in the region of [[Guerrero]] as the state slowly began to deal with the citizens and peasants there ever-more violently.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Challenging Authoritarianism in Mexico: Revolutionary Struggles and the Dirty War, 1964-1982.|last=Calderon|first=Fernando Herrera|last2=Cedillo|first2=Adela|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88904-9|location=New York|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state enacted the acts of suppression on [[Guerrero]] to keep the numerous different political reform movements stifled, as the local people over time grew agitated with the way the government was wielding their power and meddling with their rights. As the citizens grew more determined to speak out against the government in the 1960s, the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] continued to increase their terror tactics in the region. While that was done to keep the populace under their control, the constant stream of violence pushed many guerrillas to consider raising up arms against the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The rising of guerrilla groups in the 1960s and 1970s provided the state an excuse to focus their resources on suppressing the armed activities of the guerrillas. The army would become infamous for their tactics in repressing the rebels in the rural areas of Mexico, where such practices such as the death flights were initiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Jorge M.|date=November 2016|title=Reconstructing the Collective Memory of Mexico's Dirty War.|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0094582X16669137|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=43| issue =  6|pages=129|via=Discover @ Georgia Southern}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period of state violence in the state of [[Guerrero]] helped to bring about numerous guerrilla organizations. One of the groups was the [[Party of the Poor (Mexico)|Party of the Poor]] (PDLP), which was influenced by [[Marxism]] and people like [[Che Guevara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Specters of Revolution: Peasant Guerrillas in the Cold War Mexican Countryside.|last=Avina|first=Alexander|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-993659-5|location=New York|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; That group tended to be focused more on the rural regions like [[Guerrero]], where they would be more likely to find support among the peasants there. [[Party of the Poor (Mexico)|PDLP]] actions become more violent towards the rich after events such as the 1967 [[Atoyac massacre]], where leaders like [[Lucio Cabañas|Lucio Cabanas]] tried to use the peasants anger to bring about true revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Specters of Revolution: Peasant Guerrillas in the Cold War Mexican Countryside.|last=Avina|first=Alexander|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-993659-5|location=New York|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 1960s and 1970s would go on, the PDLP would gain attention around the nation for acts like their kidnapping of Ruben Figueroa who was a prominent member of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Specters of Revolution: Peasant Guerrillas in the Cold War Mexican Countryside.|last=Avina|first=Alexander|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-993659-5|location=New York|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this act inspired those downtrodden by the government, this also marked the decline of the organization as the government began to focus more on taking out this guerrilla group. Eventually the army found and killed Cabanas on December 2, 1974 in an attempt to cause his movement to fall apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Specters of Revolution: Peasant Guerrillas in the Cold War Mexican Countryside.|last=Avina|first=Alexander|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-19-993659-5|location=New York|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another school teacher turned revolutionary, [[Genaro Vázquez Rojas|Genaro Vazquez]], founded the [[National Revolutionary Civic Association]] (ACNR) as a response to the governments actions in [[Guerrero]]. These two leaders and their movements emerged as the armed phase of this social struggle against a corrupt government, which would continue long after the deaths of the leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Challenging Authoritarianism in Mexico: Revolutionary Struggles and the Dirty War, 1964-1982.|last=Calderon|first=Fernando Herrera|last2=Cedillo|first2=Adela|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88904-9|location=New York|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Torture ==
Torture was one of the many tools used by the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]]-run state in its drive to keep the numerous guerrilla groups and political dissidents repressed. While torture is illegal in many countries during this time, the numerous authoritarian regimes that sprung up from the Cold War used it to great effect. The Mexican state used torture to get information from captured rebels and guerrillas about attacks and plans. This torturing would be down at any number of clandestine detention centers, where guerrillas would be sent to before arriving at a legal prison so as the state's activities would be kept secret from outside sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Jorge M.|date=November 2016|title=Reconstructing the Collective Memory of Mexico's Dirty War.|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0094582X16669137|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=43| issue =  6|pages=131|via=Discover @ Georgia Southern}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically both male and female guerrilla prisoners would be tortured at these areas, it was more common for women to be sexually assaulted by their guards. This, combined with other forms of physical and psychological gender-based transgressions leads some to believe that the state employed this form of gender policing to try and deter women from breaking the regimes social and political norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacManus|first=Vivianna B.|date=March 2015|title=We are not Victims, we are Protagonists of this History|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=b8c430a2-3612-49b6-8194-6e9423674a74%40sessionmgr4010|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|volume=17| issue =  1|pages=52|via=Discover @ Georgia Southern}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detaining and torturing of political prisoners became more systematic after the student uprisings in 1968, for the government decided that heavy-handed responses were necessary to deal with the unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCormick|first=Gladys|date=January 2017|title=The Last Door: Political Prisoners and the Use of Torture in Mexico's Dirty War.|url=|journal=Americas|volume=74| issue =  1|pages=60|via=Humanities Full Text, EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stage of violent and public repression  of differing ideals was similar to the regimes of the [[Southern Cone]] governments, such as [[Argentina]].

== Aftermath ==
While Mexico's Dirty War has been over for several years, not much is known of the extent of the number of victims the war claimed, due to its elusive nature throughout its length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCormick|first=Gladys|date=January 2017|title=The Last Door: Political Prisoners and the Use of Torture in Mexico's Dirty War.|url=|journal=Americas|volume=74| issue =  1|pages=61|via=Humanities Full Text, EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the reason for this problem is that since there was no large-scale truth commission to bring justice to the perpetrators and closure for the victim's families, Mexico never had its "Pinochet moment" in regards to the war.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Challenging Authoritarianism in Mexico: Revolutionary Struggles and the Dirty War, 1964-1982.|last=Calderon|first=Fernando Herrera|last2=Cedillo|first2=Adela|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=978-0-415-88904-9|location=New York|pages=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem was the lack of response in the wake of the 2006 report by Carillo Prieto, which documented some of the atrocities inflicted by the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] regime. Despite this evidence of numerous crimes that violated human rights, ex-president [[Luis Echeverría|Echeverria]] and several other [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|PRI]] officials had their cases dismissed and became free men.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The failure by the government to address these problems of the past has been a cause of tension at times in Mexico, as citizens become untrusting of a state that does not address the old regime and its reign of terror.

Gen. '''Eduardo Manahan Año''' (Ret.) is a Filipino government official who is the current Philippine secretary of the [[Department of Interior and Local Government]], serving under the Duterte Admnistration. [[Rodrigo Duterte|President Duterte]] then designated Año as Officer In Charge of the [[Department of the Interior and Local Government]] in January 2018 to ensure continuous and effective delivery of public service. Año could not be given the secretary post immediately because of Republic Act Number 6975, which bars a retired or resigned military officer from being appointed Secretary within one year from the date of their retirement or resignation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Nestor Corrales |title=Año now officially DILG secretary |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1050749/ano-now-officially-dilg-secretary |website=Inquirer.net |date=November 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he formally took oath as [[Secretary of the Interior and Local Government (Philippines)|Secretary of the Interior and Local Government]] on November 6, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/06/18/ao-is-now-officially-dilg-chief&lt;/ref&gt; As a soldier, he was the [[Commanding General of the Philippine Army]] and the [[Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines]] .

[[File:LTGEN EDUARDO AÑO, AFP.jpg|thumb|left|Lt. Gen. Eduardo Año as [[Philippine Army|Army]] Chief.]]
Eduardo Manahan Año was born in San Mateo, Rizal on October 26, 1961. At an early age, he has already manifested his exceptional academic prowess when he graduated elementary as valedictorian. Straight from high school, he entered the Philippine Military Academy and became a member of the PMA Matikas Class of 1983, where he graduated as Cum Laude. He is also a graduate of the [[1st Scout Ranger Regiment|Scout Ranger Course]].

"'''Eight Miles High'''" is a [[song]] by the American [[Rock music|rock]] [[Musical ensemble|band]] [[the Byrds]], written by [[Gene Clark]], [[Roger McGuinn|Jim McGuinn]] (a.k.a.

The song was subject to a U.S. [[Radio broadcasting|radio]] ban shortly after its release, following allegations published in the broadcasting [[trade journal]] the ''[[Gavin Report]]'' regarding perceived [[Psychoactive drug#Recreational use|drug]] connotations in its [[lyrics]].&lt;ref name="einarson"&gt;{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|pages=82–86|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeless2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=158–163|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The band strenuously denied these allegations at the time, but in later years both Clark and Crosby admitted that the song was at least partly inspired by their own drug use.&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timeless"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=152–157|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The failure of "Eight Miles High" to reach the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Top 10 is usually attributed to the broadcasting ban,&lt;ref name="hjort2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|pages=91–92|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965–1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some commentators have suggested that the song's complexity and uncommercial nature were greater factors.&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmo"&gt;{{cite web|author=Teehan, Mark|title=The Byrds, "Eight Miles High", the Gavin Report, and Media Censorship of Alleged 'Drug Songs' in 1966: An Assessment|publisher=Popular Musicology Online|url=http://www.popular-musicology-online.com/issues/04/teehan.html|accessdate=2012-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Eight Miles High" reached number 14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart and number 24 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="whitburn"&gt;{{cite book|author=Whitburn, Joel.|page=130|year=2008|title=Top Pop Singles 1955–2006|publisher=Record Research Inc|isbn=0-89820-172-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, Tony.|page=130|year=2000|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-7670-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was also included on the band's third album, ''[[Fifth Dimension (album)|Fifth Dimension]]'', which was released on July 18, 1966.&lt;ref name="unterberger"&gt;{{cite web|author=Unterberger, Richie|authorlink=Richie Unterberger|title=Fifth Dimension album review|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r3062|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Eight Miles High" became the Byrds' third and final U.S. Top 20 hit, and was also their last release before the departure of Gene Clark, the band's principal songwriter at the time.

== History ==

=== Composition ===
The song's lyrics are, for the most part, about the group's flight to London in August 1965 and their accompanying English tour, as hinted at by the opening [[couplet]]: "Eight miles high and when you touch down, you'll find that it's stranger than known."&lt;!--See talk page for discussion of this lyric--&gt;&lt;ref name="timeless2"/&gt;  Although commercial airliners fly at an [[altitude]] of six to seven miles, it was felt that "eight miles high" sounded more poetic than six and also recalled the title of [[the Beatles]]' song "[[Eight Days a Week (song)|Eight Days a Week]]".&lt;ref name="timeless2"/&gt;

According to Clark, the lyrics were primarily his creation, with a minor contribution being Crosby's line, "Rain grey town, known for its sound"—a reference to London as home to the [[British Invasion]], which was then dominating the U.S. music charts.&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timeless2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mcguinn"&gt;{{cite web|author=McGuinn, Camilla|title=Eight Miles High|publisher=[[Roger McGuinn]]'s Official Blog|url=http://rogermcguinn.blogspot.com/2009/02/roadie-report-45-eight-miles-high-by.html|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other lyrics in the song that explicitly refer to the Byrds' stay in England include the couplet: "Nowhere is there warmth to be found/Among those afraid of losing their ground", which is a reference to the hostile reaction of the UK music press and to the English group [[The Birds (band)|the Birds]] serving the band with a [[copyright infringement]] [[writ]], due to the similarities in name.&lt;ref name="mcguinn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fitzsimmons, Mick|title=Sold on Song: Eight Miles High|publisher=[[BBC]]|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio2/soldonsong/songlibrary/eightmileshigh.shtml|accessdate=2009-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=95|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, "Round the squares, huddled in storms/Some laughing, some just shapeless forms" describes fans waiting for the band outside hotels, while the line "Sidewalk scenes and black limousines" refers to the excited crowds that jostled the band as they exited their chauffeur-driven cars.&lt;ref name="mcguinn"/&gt;

Although the basic idea for the song had been discussed during the band's flight to England, it didn't actually begin to take shape until the Byrds' November 1965 tour of the U.S.&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt;  To alleviate the boredom of traveling from show to show during the tour, Crosby had brought along [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] recordings of Ravi Shankar's music and the John Coltrane albums ''[[Impressions (John Coltrane album)|Impressions]]'' and ''[[Africa/Brass]]'', which were on constant rotation on the tour bus.&lt;ref name="timeless5"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=141|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=75|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965–1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The influence of these recordings on the band would manifest itself in the music of "Eight Miles High" and its B-side "Why".&lt;ref name="timeless5"/&gt;

Clark began writing the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he scribbled down some rough ideas for later development, following a discussion with [[guitarist]] [[Brian Jones]], before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting [[the Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=72|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965–1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment into a full poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a [[melody]].&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt; Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence.&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt; Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that it was he who conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft.&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt; In his book, ''Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark'', author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story would be the same were Clark still alive.&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt;

The [[master recording]] of "Eight Miles High" was recorded on January 24 and 25, 1966, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, with [[record producer]] Allen Stanton guiding the band through the recording process.&lt;ref name = "Rogan 1998 620"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|page=620|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=978-0-9529540-1-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  John Einarson has commented that the influence of Coltrane's [[saxophone]] playing and, in particular, his song "India" from the ''Impressions'' album, can be clearly heard in "Eight Miles High"—most noticeably in McGuinn's recurring [[twelve-string guitar]] solo.&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt;  In addition to this striking guitar [[Motif (music)|motif]], the song is also highlighted by [[Chris Hillman]]'s driving and hypnotic bass line, Crosby's chunky [[rhythm guitar]] playing and the band's ethereal [[Vocal harmony|harmonies]].&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timeless"/&gt;&lt;ref name="priore"&gt;{{cite book|author=Priore, Domenic.|authorlink=Domenic Priore|page=81|year=2007|title=Riot On Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=978-1-906002-04-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eder, Bruce|title=Eight Miles High|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/eight-miles-high-mt0004752042|accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Eight Miles High" also exhibits the influence of sitarist Ravi Shankar, particularly in the droning quality of the song's vocal melody and in McGuinn's guitar playing.&lt;ref name="lavezzoli"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lavezzoli, Peter.|pages=155–157|year=2007|title=The Dawn of Indian music in the West|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=0-8264-2819-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Crosby, David.|page=99|year=1990|title=Long Time Gone: The Autobiography of David Crosby|publisher=Mandarin Paperbacks|isbn=0-7493-0283-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the song does not actually feature the sound of the [[sitar]], despite the Byrds having appeared brandishing the instrument at a contemporary [[News conference|press conference]] held to promote the single.&lt;ref name="timeless"/&gt;  In a 1966 promotional interview, which was added to the expanded [[Compact Disc|CD]] reissue of the ''Fifth Dimension'' album, Crosby said that the song's ending made him "feel like a plane landing."

An earlier version of "Eight Miles High" was recorded with [[Al Schmitt]] at [[RCA Records|RCA]] Studios in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965, but [[Columbia Records]] refused to release that recording because it had not been produced at a Columbia-owned studio.&lt;ref name="timeless"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Rogan 1998 620"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/16/how-we-made-eight-miles-high-the-byrds The Byrds: how we made Eight Miles High] The Guardian, 16 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  McGuinn has since stated that he believes this original version of the song to be more spontaneous sounding than the better known Columbia release.&lt;ref name="timeless"/&gt; That opinion was echoed by Crosby, who commented, "It was a stunner, it was better, it was stronger. It had more flow to it. It was the way we wanted it to be."&lt;ref name="timeless"/&gt; This original version of "Eight Miles High" initially saw release on the 1987 archival album ''[[Never Before (album)|Never Before]]'' and was also included as a [[bonus track]] on the 1996 [[Legacy Recordings|Columbia/Legacy]] CD reissue of ''Fifth Dimension''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Connors, Tim|title=Fifth Dimension|work=Byrdwatcher: A Field Guide to the Byrds of Los Angeles|publisher=Euclid Business Network|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/lp5d.html|accessdate=2009-11-10|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504212934/http://ebni.com/byrds/lp5d.html|archivedate=2009-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|year=1996|title=Fifth Dimension (1996 CD liner notes)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release and legacy ==

===U.S. radio ban===
"Eight Miles High" was released on March 14, 1966 in the U.S. and May 29, 1966 in the UK, reaching number 14 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and number 24 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].&lt;ref name="timeless4"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whitburn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hjort"/&gt;  Following its release, the band faced allegations of advocating the use of [[Psychoactive_drug#Recreational_use|recreational drugs]] from ''[[Gavin Report|Bill Gavin's Record Report]]'', a weekly newsletter circulated to U.S. radio stations.&lt;ref name="timeless2"/&gt;  This resulted in "Eight Miles High" being banned in a number of states within a week of the report being published, a factor which contributed to the single's failure to break into the ''Billboard'' Top 10.&lt;ref name="timeless2"/&gt; The Byrds and their [[publicist]], [[Derek Taylor]], countered by strenuously denying that the song was drug-related, with Taylor issuing an indignant press release unequivocally stating that the song was about the band's trip to England and not drug use.&lt;ref name="timeless"/&gt;  However, by the early 1980s, both Crosby and Clark were prepared to admit that the song was not entirely as innocent as they had originally declared, with the former stating "Of course it was a drug song! We were stoned when we wrote it."&lt;ref name="timeless"/&gt;  Clark was less blunt, explaining in interview that "it was about a lot of things. It was about the airplane trip to England, it was about drugs, it was about all that. A piece of poetry of that nature is not limited to having it have to be just about airplanes or having it have to be just about drugs. It was inclusive because during those days the new experimenting with all the drugs was a very vogue thing to do."&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt;

Research analyst Mark Teehan, writing for Popular Musicology Online, has challenged the widely held view among critics, music historians and the Byrds themselves that the U.S. radio ban hurt sales of "Eight Miles High".&lt;ref name="pmo"/&gt;  Having examined the local music surveys and the ''Billboard'' regional retail sales charts, as they relate to the national charting of "Eight Miles High", Teehan has uncovered evidence suggesting that the progressive and uncommercial nature of the song was a much bigger factor in its failure to reach the ''Billboard'' Top 10.&lt;ref name="pmo"/&gt;  The author's research revealed that "Eight Miles High" failed to reach the Top Five in any of his sample of 23 regional markets, and most telling, among the thirty radio stations included within this sample, it reached the Top 10 on only seven of them (23%).&lt;ref name="pmo"/&gt;  

Teehan points out that although the ''Gavin Report'' recommended that radio stations withdraw the single from airplay, many stations did not comply with this request.&lt;ref name="pmo"/&gt; In addition, Teehan notes that the radio ban was not suggested by the ''Gavin Report'' until April 29, 1966, almost seven weeks after the single had initially been released—ample time for it to have made its mark on the charts.&lt;ref name="pmo"/&gt;  Teehan has uncovered evidence showing that "Eight Miles High" was already decelerating on the national charts before the end of April 1966.&lt;ref name="pmo"/&gt; He concludes that the groundbreaking song lacked strong commercial appeal by virtue of its complexity, unique sound, and excessive length (commercial radio stations were reluctant to play songs that were over two-and-a-half minutes long during the mid-1960s), and that it suffered from uncoordinated and inefficient promotion by Columbia Records.&lt;ref name="pmo"/&gt;

===Influence and reception===
[[File:The Byrds Raga Rock.png|220px|thumb|right|The Byrds at the "Eight Miles High" press conference in March 1966, posing with a sitar in order to illustrate the Indian influences present in the song.]]
The song's use of Indian and [[Free jazz|free-form jazz]] influences, along with its impressionistic lyrics, were immediately influential on the emerging genre of psychedelic rock.&lt;ref name="hjort"/&gt;&lt;ref name="allmusic"&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychedelic/Garage Overview|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/psychedelic-garage-ma0000002800|accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, some authors and music historians, including Eric V. D. Luft, [[Domenic Priore]], and Dwight Rounds, have described "Eight Miles High" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Luft, Eric V. D.|page=155|year=2009|title=Die at the Right Time!: A Subjective Cultural History of the American Sixties|publisher=Gegenstaz Press|isbn=978-0-9655179-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Priore, Domenic|authorlink=Domenic Priore|page=38|year=200|title=SMiLE: The Story of Brian Wilson's Lost Masterpiece|publisher=Sanctuary|isbn=978-1-86074-627-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rounds, Dwight|page=59|year=2007|title=The Year the Music Died: 1964-1972: A Commentary on the Best Era of Pop|publisher=Bridgeway Books|isbn=978-1-933538-69-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book ''Riot On Sunset Strip: Rock 'n' Roll's Last Stand in Hollywood'', Priore cites "Eight Miles High" as being the record that kicked off the psychedelic craze, explaining "prior to 'Eight Miles High,' there were no pop records with incessant, hypnotic basslines juxtaposed by droning, trance-induced improvisational guitar."&lt;ref name="priore"/&gt;

The song was responsible for the naming of the musical subgenre [[raga rock]], when journalist Sally Kempton, in her review of the single for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', used the term to describe the record's experimental fusion of eastern and western music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|page=88|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965–1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, although Kempton was the first person to use the term ''raga rock'' in print, she had actually borrowed the phrase from the promotional material that the Byrds' press office had supplied to accompany the "Eight Miles High" single release.&lt;ref name="bellman"/&gt;  In a 1968 interview for the [[Pop Chronicles]] [[radio documentary]], McGuinn denied that the song was in fact an example of raga rock,&lt;ref name="pc35"/&gt; while Crosby, speaking in 1998, dismissed the term entirely, stating "they kept trying to label us; every time we turned around, they came up with a new one ... it's a bunch of bullshit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Connors, Tim|title=The Byrdwatcher Interview with David Crosby: Part Five|publisher=Euclid Business Network Incorporated|url=http://ebni.com/byrds/newsbwidc5.html|accessdate=2012-06-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730153904/http://ebni.com/byrds/newsbwidc5.html|archivedate=2013-07-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, the experimental nature of the song placed the Byrds firmly at the forefront of the burgeoning psychedelic movement, along with [[the Yardbirds]], the Beatles, [[Donovan]] and the Rolling Stones, who were all exploring similar musical territory concurrently.&lt;ref name="allmusic"/&gt;

Contemporary reviews for the single were mostly positive, with [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] magazine describing the song as a "Big beat rhythm rocker with soft lyric ballad vocal and off-beat instrumental backing."&lt;ref name="hjort"/&gt;  ''[[Record World]]'' magazine also praised the song, commenting "It's an eerie tune with lyrics bound to hypnotize. Will climb heights."&lt;ref name="hjort"/&gt;  In the UK, ''Music Echo'' described the song as "wild and oriental but still beaty".  The publication also suggested that with the release of "Eight Miles High" the Byrds had jumped ahead of the Beatles in terms of creativity, stating "[By] getting their single out now they've beaten the Beatles to the punch, for Paul [McCartney] admitted recently that the Liverpool foursome are working on a similar sound for their new album and single."&lt;ref name="hjort2"/&gt;  In recent years, [[Richie Unterberger]], writing for the [[Allmusic]] website, has described "Eight Miles High" as "one of the greatest singles of the '60s."&lt;ref name="unterberger"/&gt;

In 1999, the song was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]], an honor reserved for "recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that are at least 25 years old."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GRAMMY Hall of Fame: Past Recipients |work=GRAMMY.org |publisher=The Recording Academy |url=http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame |accessdate=2012-06-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110122042616/http://www.grammy.org/recording-academy/awards/hall-of-fame |archivedate=2011-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked "Eight Miles High" at number 151 on their list of ''[[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 500 Greatest Songs Of All Time|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner  Media|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-500-greatest-songs-of-all-time-20110407/the-byrds-eight-miles-high-19691231|accessdate=2012-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2005, [[Q magazine|''Q'' magazine]] placed the song at number 50 on their list of the ''100 Greatest Guitar Tracks''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=100 Greatest Guitar Tracks|publisher=Rockandrollreport.com|url=http://rockandrollreport.com/the-q-magazine-100-greatest-guitar-tracks-ever/|accessdate=2009-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-release ==
During the same month that "Eight Miles High" was released as a single, the Byrds' main songwriter, Gene Clark, left the band.&lt;ref name="hjort"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hjort, Christopher.|pages=84–87|year=2008|title=So You Want To Be A Rock 'n' Roll Star: The Byrds Day-By-Day (1965–1973)|publisher=Jawbone Press|isbn=1-906002-15-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His fear of flying was stated as the official reason for his departure, but other factors, including his tendency toward anxiety and paranoia, as well as his increasing isolation within the group, were also at work.&lt;ref name="hjort"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Einarson, John.|pages=87–88|year=2005|title=Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-793-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the release of "Eight Miles High" and Clark's departure, the Byrds never again managed to place a single in the ''Billboard'' Top 20.&lt;ref name="whitburn"/&gt;

The Byrds performed "Eight Miles High" on a number of [[television program]]s during the 1960s and 1970s, including ''Popside'', ''Drop In'', ''Midweek'', and ''[[Beat-Club]]''.&lt;ref name="timeless6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rogan, Johnny.|pages=591–617|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|edition=2nd|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song would go on to become a staple of the band's [[Rock concert|live concert]] repertoire, until their final disbandment in 1973.&lt;ref name="timeless6"/&gt;  A sixteen-minute live version of "Eight Miles High" was included on the Byrds' ''[[Untitled (The Byrds album)|(Untitled)]]'' album in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eder, Bruce|title=(Untitled) album review|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r738051|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another live version was released as part of the 2008 album, ''[[Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Leggett, Steve|title=Live at Royal Albert Hall 1971 album review|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1364393|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The song was performed live by a reformed lineup of the Byrds featuring [[Roger McGuinn]], David Crosby, and Chris Hillman in January 1989.&lt;ref name="timeless6"/&gt;

The song would remain a favorite of Clark's during his post-Byrds solo career and would often be performed live at his concert appearances until his death, in 1991.&lt;ref name="einarson"/&gt;  McGuinn also continues to perform an intricate acoustic guitar rendition of the song in his live concerts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Landers, Rick|title=Roger McGuinn Interview|work=Modern Guitars Magazine|publisher=Rick Landers|url=http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001633.html|accessdate=2009-11-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016015557/http://www.modernguitars.com/archives/001633.html|archivedate=2009-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crosby has revisited "Eight Miles High" infrequently during his post-Byrds career, but it was performed during [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]]'s reunion tour of 2000, with [[Neil Young]] handling McGuinn's guitar solo, while the other three members sang the song's [[Vocal harmony|three-part harmonies]].&lt;ref name="lavezzoli"/&gt;  Additionally, the Byrds' [[Bassist|bass player]], [[Chris Hillman]], recorded an acoustic version of "Eight Miles High" as part of his 2005 album, ''[[The Other Side (Chris Hillman album)|The Other Side]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Deming, Mark|title=The Other Side album review|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=Rovi Corporation|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r777964|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Galileo Galilei''''' is an [[opera]] based on excerpts from the life of [[Galileo Galilei]] which premiered in 2002 at [[Chicago]]'s [[Goodman Theatre]], as well as subsequent presentations at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's New Wave Music Festival and London's [[Barbican Theatre]]. Music by [[Philip Glass]], [[libretto]] and original direction by [[Mary Zimmerman]] and Arnold Weinstein. The piece is presented in one [[Act (theater)|act]] consisting of ten scenes without break.

''Galileo Galilei'' is Glass' 18th opera, and draws from letters of Galileo and his family, and various other documents, to retrospectively journey through Galileo's life. Opening with him as an old, blind man after the trial and Inquisition for his heresy, it explores his religiosity as well as his break with the church, and expands into the greater, oscillating relationship of science to both religion and art.  It reaches its end with Galileo — as a young boy — watching an opera composed by his father, [[Vincenzo Galilei]], who was a member of the [[Florentine Camerata]], an association of artists who are credited with creating the art form that came to be known as opera.  Ironically, his father's opera is about the motions of the celestial bodies.

The opera has been revived with new productions in 2012 by [[Madison Opera]] and [[Portland Opera]]. The Portland Opera production was recorded by Orange Mountain Music.

==Production notes==
All genius meets with extreme resistance before it is accepted as truth. In the case of Galileo, it was the mere hypothesis that the earth revolved around the sun. The notion was considered heretical and blasphemous by scholars and clergy alike. Much was done to destroy Galileo's reputation. And since they could not do so through scientific proof, they did so through slander and threats of torture. It was not until recently that the Catholic Church finally admitted that they were wrong in persecuting Galileo. It took hundreds of years for them to admit the mistake. Galileo died believing that all of the advancements he had made in science were for naught. His books were banned, and his name was disgraced. All of this, for suggesting a theory that turned out to be true.

In addition to depicting Galileo's trials before the Inquisition, the opera also allows us a glance into Galileo's more personal side. Namely, in showing us his relationship to his daughter Maria Celeste, who was a nun. Maria Celeste shared her father's love of learning and science, but also understood that he was a man of great faith. She recognized that science was the very subject that served to deepen his faith, and she encouraged him on this path. The two met rarely. They were separated not only by distance, but by Galileo's often ailing health. Sadly, they were ultimately separated by her death at the age of 33, a source of incredible sadness for Galileo. However, their connection in this opera serves to give his story a more personal rendering. The story itself is told backwards through time. It begins with an aged Galileo, blinded from having looked at the sun too often and ends with him as a child. This is related to his invention of the telescope, which works by reversing images with lenses. Much of the staging in this production is representative of Galileo's theories and follows the patterns of the discoveries, planets, and constellations that his inventions made known to the world.

==Synopsis==
;Scene 1
''Opening Song''

In the final days of his life, the now blind Galileo Galilei remembers the things in his life that he can no longer see.

;Scene 2
''Recantation''

The officials of the Catholic Church rebuke the scientist for not relenting on his theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun. The Pope hands down his sentence, and then reminds Galileo of a time when they walked in the garden as friends.

;Scene 3
''Pears''

Marie Celeste, the daughter of Galileo, sends her intense devotion love and support through letters that are accompanied by elements of her garden at the convent.

;Scene 4
''Trial''

Galileo is summoned before two Cardinals of the Catholic Church to answer questions regarding his book "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World".

;Scene 5
''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief Systems of the World]]''

As Galileo pens his book, the fictitious characters come alive to discuss the theories presented. ''Here, the Older Galileo becomes the Younger Galileo.''

;Scene 6
''Incline Plane''

The theories and experiments are put to the test in Galileo's laboratory.

;Scene 7
''A Walk in the Garden''

Galileo and his great friend Cardinal Barberini discuss Galileo's newest book in the Garden. After the Cardinal's feeble attempt at poetry, Galileo expresses his fear of his enemies. Barberini warns Galileo not to continue with his theories regarding the planets.

;Scene 8
''Lamps''

While at mass with his daughter, Galileo observes the swinging of a lamp suspended from the ceiling moving in pendulum fashion and explains his theory to Marie.

;Scene 9
''Presentation of the Telescope''

Galileo presents his invention to the Duchess and her Ladies in Waiting. The Duchess and Galileo reminisce about a time in their youth when they watched an opera together composed by Galileo's father, [[Vincenzo Galilei|Vincenzo]].

;Scene 10
''Opera within the Opera''

The Duchess and Galileo, now children, are in the audience as his father's opera is performed. The magical story of the planetary figures becomes the vehicle through which Galileo is reunited with his deceased daughter.

The '''''Garde-Meuble de la Couronne''''' was, in the organisation of the [[France|French]] royal household under the [[Ancien Régime]], the department of the ''[[Maison du Roi]]'' responsible for the order, upkeep, storage and repair of all the movable [[furniture]] and objects in the royal palaces.

It oversaw the administration of the [[Beauvais Manufactory]] and [[Gobelins Manufactory]]. 

The organisation is called since 1870 the [[Mobilier National]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1567">The '''Goroka Show''' is a well-known tribal gathering and cultural event in [[Papua New Guinea]]. It is a [[Sing-sing]] held every year close to the country's Independence Day (16 September) in the town of [[Goroka]], the capital of the [[Eastern Highlands Province]]. About 100 tribes arrive to show their music, dance and culture. The festival started in the mid-1950s as an  initiative of Australian [[Kiap]]s. In recent years it has become a major attraction for both national and international tourists and remains the largest cultural event in Papua New Guinea despite similar shows now being organised in [[Mount Hagen]] and other cities around the country.

'''''Hall v Durham Catholic School Board''''' was a 2002 court case in which Marc Hall, a [[Canadians|Canadian]] teenager, fought a successful legal battle against the [[Durham Catholic District School Board]] to bring a [[same sex couple|same-sex date]] to his high school [[prom]]. The case made Canadian and international headlines.

==Legal case==
''Hall v Durham Catholic School Board'' began when [[Oshawa]], [[Ontario]]'s [[Monsignor John Pereyma Catholic Secondary School]] asked students attending the prom to submit the names of the guests they intended to bring. Hall, who is gay, submitted the name of his 21-year-old boyfriend, Jean-Paul Dumond, and was denied on the grounds that homosexuality is incompatible with [[Roman Catholic]] teaching.&lt;ref name="dropped"&gt;[http://www.lifesite.net/ldn/2005/jun/05062905.html Gay Activist Student Marc Hall Drops Court Case, Leaving Catholic School Board Without Chance For Vindication] Lifesitenews.com June 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Supported by his family and a wide variety of community organizations, Hall thus took the school board to court in a two-day hearing that began on May 6, 2002. Hall's lawyer, [[David Corbett (lawyer)|David Corbett]], argued that the denial of his request violated the Ontario Education Act, which requires school boards in the province not to discriminate. The school board, on the other hand, argued that court interference in its decision would amount to denying its religious freedom.

Corbett argued that an organization that accepts public funding (Catholic school boards in Ontario are fully funded in the same manner as public schools) has to be accountable to the same laws (including anti-discrimination laws) as other public institutions. The school board's lawyer countered that Section 93 of the [[Canadian constitution]] protects the Catholic board's rights to conduct its affairs in accordance with Catholic teaching.

In addition, Corbett noted that while extramarital sex is also contrary to Catholic teaching, the school board had previously allowed [[pregnancy|pregnant]], unmarried students to attend the prom.

On May 10, Justice Robert McKinnon granted an [[interlocutory injunction]] ordering that Hall be allowed to attend the prom with Dumond. The justice also ordered that the school not cancel the prom. He did not decide on the larger issues raised by the case, leaving those to be heard at a later trial. Hall attended the prom with Dumond that evening.

==In popular culture==
===Television===
Director [[Larry Peloso]] created a one-hour documentary on the case entitled ''[[Prom Fight: The Marc Hall Story]]''. An unrelated television movie, ''[[Prom Queen: The Marc Hall Story]]'', aired on [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] in 2004 with [[Aaron Ashmore]] starring as Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Prom Queen: The Marc Hall Story (TV Movie 2004)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0410953/fullcredits/|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Index of Spousal Abuse''' (ISA) is a 30-item [[Self-report study|self-report]] scale developed to measure the severity of physical and non-physical aggression inflicted on a woman by her [[spouse]] or partner. The ISA has become a popular measure in medical settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Adult Aggression Measures|author=Coccaro, Emil|title=Aggression: Psychiatric Assessment and Treatment|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was created from the [[conflict tactics scale]], one of the earliest instruments used to identify [[Intimate partner violence|violence between partners]] by measuring interpersonal aggression, in which 19 items pertain to non-physical abuse and 11 pertain to [[physical abuse]]. Each item is rated on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (very frequently). Both of these scales are part of assessing the [[cycle of abuse]].

'''LifeLight Festival''' is an annual free outdoor [[Christian music festival]] held over [[Labor Day]] weekend on a farm near [[Worthing, South Dakota]], which is 12 miles south of [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]]

==History==
[[LifeLight Festival]]&lt;ref name="LLFest01"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=LifeLight Communications |date=n.d. |url=http://www.lifelight.org |title=LifeLight.org ::  |accessdate=2008-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was started by Alan and Vicki Greene in 1998 as an afternoon concert on a local church lawn, drawing about 2,000 people.  By 2001, the festival was moved to the W.H. Lyons Fairgrounds in Sioux Falls to accommodate the growing crowds.  In 2002, attendance tripled from the year before, growing to 32,000 attendees over a 3-day weekend.  Now, LifeLight has grown to over 320,000 attendees over a 3-day weekend, expanding to 6 stages, with a budget of nearly $700,000 each year. After outgrowing previous festival locations, the LifeLight festival found a new permanent home for the Festival on a family farm near [[Worthing, SD]].  The 2010 Festival was the first at the new location.&lt;ref name="keloland"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keloland.com/NewsDetail6162.cfm?Id%3D84570 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927223530/http://www.keloland.com/NewsDetail6162.cfm?Id=84570 |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a free concert but provides a great economic boost to Sioux Falls.&lt;ref name="LLFestHist01"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=LifeLight Communications |date=n.d. |url=http://www.lifelight.org/festival/festival-history |title=LifeLight Festival :: History |accessdate=2008-01-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227095816/http://www.lifelight.org/festival/festival-history &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festivals like this one said to bring up to $10 Million&lt;ref name="keloland"/&gt; 
Since 2005, LifeLight has also sponsored spring and fall tours featuring LifeLight artists. They started as local tours with primarily local artists but over the years, LifeLight Tours has partnered with several national and regional bands/speakers and now travel well beyond the Midwest for tour dates.  Past tours have featured artists [[John Reuben]], [[Brian Welch]], [[Sanctus Real]],  [[Phil Joel]], [[Disciple (band)|Disciple]], [[Project 86]], [[Children 18:3]] and many more and traveled to cities in Texas, Illinois, Nebraska, Colorado, Minnesota, Iowa, and South Dakota as well as other states. The 2013 festival in South Dakota hosted main showings of Plumb, Newsboys, Audio Adrenaline, and Skillet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifelight.org/tours LifeLight Tours]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of incidents attributed in popular culture to the '''[[Bermuda Triangle]] Or Devil's Triangle'''

== Aircraft incidents == 
* 1945: July 10, Thomas Arthur Garner, AMM3, USN, along with eleven other crew members, was lost at sea in a US Navy PBM3S patrol seaplane, Bu. No.6545, Sqd VPB2-OTU#3, in the Bermuda Triangle. They left the [[Patrick Air Force Base|Naval Air Station, Banana River, Florida]], at 7:07 p.m. on July 9, 1945, for a radar training flight to [[Great Exuma]], Bahamas. Their last radio position report was sent at 1:16 a.m., July 10, 1945, with a latitude/longitude of 25-22N 77.34W, near Providence Island, after which they were never heard from again. An extensive ten day surface and air search, including a carrier sweep, found nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Garner family records.  Further information available upon request from dgarner@PacBell.net&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1945: December 5, [[Flight 19]] (five [[Grumman TBF Avenger|TBF Avenger]]s) lost with 14 airmen, and later the same day [[Martin PBM Mariner|PBM Mariner]] BuNo 59225 lost with 13 airmen while searching for Flight 19.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq15-1.htm Flight 19] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413074152/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq15-1.htm|date=2009-04-13}} Department of the Navy, Naval Historical Center – The Loss Of Flight 19&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1881: According to Legend a sailing ship the "[[Ellen Austin]]" found a derelict vessel and placed a crew to sail the vessel to port. Two versions of what happened to the vessel are: the vessel was either lost in a storm or was found again without a crew. Lawrence David Kusche author of "The Bermuda Triangle Mystery-Solved"  found no mention in 1880 or 1881 newspapers of this alleged incident-he did trace the legend to a book by Rupert Gould "The Stargazer Talks" published in 1943. The  "Ellen Austin" did exist; a check from Lloyd's of London records proved the existence of Meta, built in 1854, and that in 1880, Meta was renamed Ellen Austin. There are no casualty listings for this vessel, or any vessel at that time, that would suggest a large number of missing men were placed on board a derelict that later disappeared although one website includes the alleged derelict vessel incident it does find that Rupert Gould talked about the legend on radio in the 1930s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2015/12/10/the-ellen-austin-encounter/|title=The Ellen Austin Encounter|last=Sometimes Interesting|date=2015-12-10|website=Sometimes Interesting|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;; likewise the website traces the derelict story to a June 1906 newspaper story-which claims the derelict ship incident took place in 1891-&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sometimes-interesting.com/2015/12/10/the-ellen-austin-encounter/|title=The Ellen Austin Encounter|last=Sometimes Interesting|date=2015-12-10|website=Sometimes Interesting|accessdate=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;however the 1906 story does not give a reference of where this story came from!
* 1918: {{USS|Cyclops|AC-4|6}}, collier, left [[Barbados]] on March 4, lost with all 306 crew and passengers en route to [[Baltimore, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c/cyclops.htm USS Cyclops] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810203810/http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c/cyclops.htm|date=2010-08-10}} Department of the Navy, Naval Historical Center – Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1921: January 31, ''[[Carroll A. Deering]]'', five-masted schooner, Captain W. B. Wormell, found aground and abandoned at Diamond Shoals, near Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9JuNcIrkjx8C|title=Ghost Ship of Diamond Shoals|last=Simpson|first=Bland|publisher=UNC Press Books|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1925: 1 December, {{SS|Cotopaxi}}, having departed [[Charleston, South Carolina]] two days earlier bound for [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], radioed a [[Distress signal|distress call]] reporting that the ship was sinking. She was officially listed as overdue on 31 December.&lt;ref name=Times311225&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Mails and Shipping |day_of_week=Thursday |date=31 December 1925 |page_number=18 |issue=44157 |column=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following month, her sister ship {{USS|Nereus|AC-10}} was lost with all 61 persons on board, having also departed St. Thomas with a cargo of bauxite, on 10 December. According to research by Rear Admiral George van Deurs, USN, who was familiar with this type of ship from their service in the USN, the acidic coal cargo would seriously erode the longitudinal support beams, making these aging and poorly constructed colliers extremely vulnerable to breaking up in heavy seas.&lt;ref name="familyheritage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://familyheritage.ca/Articles/merchant1.html|title=Naval History.ca – History of the Royal Canadian Navy – Canadian Merchant Ship Losses, 1939–1945|author=Rob Fisher|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were both sister ships of the USS Cyclops.

* 1963: {{SS|Marine Sulphur Queen}}, lost with  39 crewmen, having departed [[Beaumont, Texas]], on 2 February with a cargo of 15,260 tons of sulphur. She was last heard from on 4 February, when she was in rough, nearly following seas of 16 feet, with northerly winds of 25–46 knots, and listed as missing two days later. The Coast Guard subsequently determined that the ship was unsafe and not seaworthy, and never should have sailed. The final report suggested four causes of the disaster, all due to poor design and maintenance of the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.pacbell.net/corwind/cgreport.html|title=Marine Sulphur Queen Coast Guard Report Summary of Findings|website=pacbell.net|accessdate=15 July 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509103209/http://home.pacbell.net/corwind/cgreport.html|archivedate=9 May 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2015: In late July, 2015, two 14-year-old boys, Austin Stephanos and Perry Cohen went on a fishing trip in their 19-foot boat.

* 2015: {{SS|El Faro}} sank off of the coast of the Bahamas within the triangle on October 1, 2015. Search crews identified the vessel 15,000 feet below the surface.

:''This article is about a World War II operation. For the 1960s television program on literacy, see '''[[Operation Alphabet (TV series)]]'''.''
[[File:Norwegian troops greenock.JPG|thumb|British troops returning to the UK at [[Greenock]] in June 1940.]]
'''Operation Alphabet ''' was an evacuation, authorised on May 24, 1940, of Allied (British, French and Polish) troops from the harbour of [[Narvik]] in northern [[Norway]] marking the success of [[Operation Weserübung]] the [[Nazi Germany]] invasion of April 9 and the end of the [[Allied campaign in Norway]] during [[World War II]]. The evacuation was completed by June 8.

The evacuation was prompted by the ''[[Wehrmacht]]''{{'}}s assault on [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[France]] in the spring of 1940, which reduced the relative importance of Germany's iron ore provision and of [[Scandinavia]]. Several nights after the final military evacuation, the civilians of the town were rescued by British Sub-Lieutenant [[Patrick Dalzel-Job]]. Against orders, he organised local fishing boats to remove the population just before a German reprisal bombing. Much of the town was destroyed but only four people were killed. The Royal Navy wanted to discipline Dalzel-Job but was unable to, after King [[Haakon VII of Norway|Haakon VII]] awarded him the [[The Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav|Knights Cross of the Order of Saint Olav (First Class)]]. Later in the war, he served with [[Ian Fleming]]. Many sources cite Dalzel-Job as the inspiration for the [[James Bond]] character.

A consequence of the evacuation of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] troops from Norway was that [[Sweden]]'s and [[Finland]]'s position vis-à-vis Nazi-Germany was weakened. An agreement was reached in June leading to extensive transfers of (unarmed) Wehrmacht troops on Swedish railways – probably Sweden's chief digression from her policy of [[neutral country|neutrality]] between the parties of the war – and in August Finland concluded a secret agreement according to which Finland could acquire weapons through Germany and Germany could transfer (armed) troops by truck&lt;!-- and station personnel for their supply and security - this is factual but not really important yet in August --&gt; through northernmost Finland. Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, still united by the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], had excluded other international powers from influence in [[Northern Europe]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7174">'''Pagoda festivals''' ({{lang-my|ဘုရားပွဲ}}; '''''paya pwe''''') are regular festivals found throughout [[Burma]] (Myanmar) that commemorate major events in [[pagoda]]'s history, including the founding of a [[pagoda]] and the crowning of the pagoda's [[hti]] (umbrella).&lt;ref name=spiro&gt;{{cite book|last=Spiro|first=Melford E.|title=Buddhism and Society: A Great Tradition and Its Burmese Vicissitudes|publisher=University of California Press|year=1982|pages=229–231|isbn=9780520046726}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pagoda festivals are dictated by the [[Burmese calendar|Burmese religious calendar]] and often are held several days at a time. Major events in a pagoda festival typically do not coincide with [[Uposatha]] (Buddhist Sabbath) days, during which devout Buddhists observe the [[Eight Precepts]].&lt;ref name=spiro/&gt; The majority of pagoda festivals are held during the dry season, from the months of [[Tazaungmon]] (November) to [[Tabaung]] (March).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/timeout/559/timeout55902.html|title=U Maung Maung Circus returns to Yangon|last=May Sandy|date=24 January 2011|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=12 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014150725/http://www.mmtimes.com/2011/timeout/559/timeout55902.html|archivedate=14 October 2013|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More well-known pagoda festivals often attract pilgrims from throughout the country.

Pagoda festivals are similar in nature to [[agricultural show]]s (country fairs) or [[carnival]]s, and form a significant important part of cultural life, particularly in the countryside. During pagoda festivals, temporary [[bazaar]]s (including food stalls and merchandise stands), entertainment venues (including [[anyeint]] dramas, [[yoke the]] performances, [[lethwei]] matches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/entertainment/entertainment08.htm|title=Football, boxing top sports for local fans|last=Aung Sithu Hein|date=2 March 2009|work=Myanmar Times|accessdate=12 October 2013|archivedate=14 October 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014105905/http://www.mmtimes.com/feature/entertainment/entertainment08.htm|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arcades) are set up in the vicinity of the pagoda.&lt;ref name=spiro/&gt;

The '''Prince of Wales Theatre''' is a former theatre in central [[Cardiff]]. Built in 1878 seating 2,800, it later became a [[Adult movie theater|sex cinema]]. It is now a [[pub]].&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;&lt;ref name=WM1976/&gt;&lt;ref name=WM1988/&gt;

The building is located near [[Cardiff Central railway station]], near the corner of [[St Mary Street/High Street|St Mary Street]] and Wood Street, with entrances and façades on both streets.

==Architecture==
[[File:Prince of Wales Theatre Cardiff St Mary St facade B.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|St Mary Street façade]]
The theatre was built in 1878 to a [[Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian Gothic]] design by the architects W. D. Bleasley and T. Waring,&lt;ref name=Newman/&gt; during a period of rapid expansion of Cardiff, then a prosperous coal-exporting port. The building was a prompt replacement of Cardiff's old Theatre Royal in [[Queen Street, Cardiff|Queen Street]] (built 1827, which had burnt down in December) doubling the audience capacity to almost 2000, and was opened on 7 October 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Destruction Of The Cardiff Theatre |url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000104%2f18781001%2f024 |work=[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]] |date=16 December 1877 |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |subscription=yes |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WMailOct1878&gt;{{cite news|title=The New Theatre Royal, Cardiff |url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/bna/viewarticle?id=bl%2f0000104%2f18781001%2f024 |work=Western Mail |date=1 October 1878 |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]] |subscription=yes |page=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Brian|title=Cardiff Remembered: How music halls like the Coliseum and theatres like the Empire were the centre of city life|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/lifestyle/nostalgia/cardiff-remembered-how-music-halls-9350558|website=Wales Online|accessdate=31 March 2017|date=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main stage was 56 feet wide and 46 feet deep, framed by a 30 feet high [[Proscenium|proscenium arch]] topped with the royal coat of arms. Interior decoration was in gold and white and the building was illuminated after dark using 800 gas lamps.&lt;ref name=WMailOct1878 /&gt;

The theatre was later rebuilt in the [[Greek Revival architecture|Greek Revival]] style to a design by Willmott &amp; Smith. An additional entrance on St Mary Street was added with two large fluted [[Doric order|Doric]] columns flanking a [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|neoclassical]] statue of a young woman holding a cup. The interior of the theatre was remodelled in 1920 in the same Greek style. The [[proscenium arch]] is flanked by massive [[Ionic order|Ionic]] columns carrying a large triangular pediment with an elaborate Grecian [[bas-relief]] frieze above.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;

In 1988 the interior was divided into multiple spaces for a variety of uses, including an [[amusement arcade]] and a [[pub]]. This largely obscured the original interior. The interior was again altered in 1999, converting the entire space into a pub and partly restoring the 1920 interior.&lt;ref name=trust/&gt;

The building was designated a [[Grade II listed building]] in 1960.&lt;ref name=BLB/&gt;

{{Violence against women}}
{{Merge|Darfur genocide|date=May 2018}}
Throughout the ongoing [[Darfur genocide]] in the [[Darfur war]] there has been a systematic campaign of rape, which has been used as a [[war rape|weapon]] of war, in the [[ethnic cleansing]] of black Africans from the region.{{sfn|Ball|2011|p=107}}{{sfn|GOMA|2011}}{{sfn|Hagan|Rymond-Richmond|Parker|2005|pp=525–562}} The majority of rapes have been carried out by the Sudanese government forces and the [[Janjaweed]] ("evil men on horseback"){{sfn|Straus|2005|p=126}} paramilitary groups.{{sfn|Hirsch|2012}}{{sfn|Hashim|2009|p=226}} The actions of the Janjaweed have been described as [[genocidal rape]], with not just women, but children also being raped, as well as babies being bludgeoned to death and the sexual mutilation of victims being commonplace.{{sfn|Rothe|2009|p=53}}{{sfn|Hagan|Rymond-Richmond|Parker|2005|pp=525–562}}

The genocide, which is being carried out against the [[Fur people|Fur]], [[Masalit people|Masalit]] and the [[Zaghawa people|Zaghawa]] ethnic peoples has led to the [[List of people indicted in the International Criminal Court|International Criminal Court (ICC) indicting]] several people for [[crimes against humanity]], rape, forced transfer and torture. According to Eric Reeves more than one million children have been "killed, raped, wounded, displaced, traumatized, or endured the loss of parents and families".{{sfn|Totten|2006|p=xxxix}}

== Rape as a weapon of war ==

Due to the ongoing violence it has not been possible for researchers to conduct population based studies, and there are no estimates as yet of the number of victims.{{sfn|Gingerich|Leaning|2004|p=13}} It is believed that the rapes are widespread, and the victims are estimated to be in the tens of thousands.{{sfn|Clark Miller|2009|p=58}} One NGO documented 9,300 rapes, however observers in country have stated the number of those raped are closer to double the 9,300 documented.{{sfn|Gingerich|Leaning|2004|p=16}} There have been reports of girls under the age of ten to women over seventy being raped, and that the majority of victims had suffered from being gang raped.{{sfn|Gingerich|Leaning|2004|p=15}} Children aged five have been raped, and one third of rape victims are children. As of 2009, reports and testimonials concluded that the campaign of rape was systematic and had been ongoing for five years.{{sfn|Frey|2009|p=216}} In a statement to the UN former secretary general [[Kofi Annan]] said “In Darfur, we see whole populations displaced, and their homes destroyed, while rape is used as a deliberate strategy.”{{sfn|Gingerich|Leaning|2004|p=17}}

== International response ==

[[File:Darfur report - Page 4 Image 2.jpg|thumb|160px|Arab [[Janjaweed]] tribes have been a major player in the conflict.]]

The [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) reported that in a remote area of Darfur local leaders had stated that over four hundred women and girls had been raped, and that some of these women had been raped in full view of their husbands. USAID also reported that they had gotten reports of women being [[Human branding|branded]] by the Janjaweed following rapes.{{sfn|Natsios|2006||p=33}}

Writing in ''[[Foreign Affairs (journal)|Foreign Affairs]]'', American political scientist Scott Straus stated that a U.S. official had reported that 574 villages had been razed and another 157 damaged between the middle of 2003 and September 2004, with most of these villages having no armed rebel presence when the attacks occurred.{{sfn|Straus|2005|pp=123–133}} Depositions by survivors consistently indicate that the militias target men for execution, and that the elderly, women and children are not spared. For women rape is the primary threat. Between the middle of October 2004 and February 2005 it was estimated that up to six million Darfurians were displaced and a further 200,000 had sought asylum in Chad.{{sfn|Straus|2005|pp=123–133}}

In 2004, the [[U.S. State Department]] released a report on the atrocities which ran to eight pages. The report stated that there was "a consistent and widespread pattern of atrocities in the Darfur region of western Sudan" and that there was a clear "pattern of abuse against members of Darfur's non-Arab communities, including murder, rape, beatings, ethnic humiliation, and destruction of property and basic necessities." The report also suggested the number of rapes were more than likely underestimated, as acknowledging that a female member of the family had been raped leads to social stigma.{{sfn|Totten|2010|p=18}} In the ''[[New York Times]]'', an unnamed observer of the situation was quoted as saying: "In this society if you rape one woman, you have raped the entire tribe."{{sfn|Scheffer|2008}}

On 7 March 2005, [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] issued a report which stated that they had treated five hundred rape victims, both women and girls, and that this was but a fraction of those who have been assaulted sexually.{{sfn|Totten|2006|p=xxxv}}

In 2007 the NGO, [[Global Grassroots]] in association with Gretchen Steidle Wallace produced the documentary, [[The Devil Came on Horseback]]. Based on the book of the same title which was written by [[Brian Steidle]] after his experiences in Darfur it was nominated for an emmy award.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=330}} In 2009 the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] hosted a [[documentary film]] on the sexual violence in Darfur.{{sfn|United States Holocaust Memorial Museum}} [[Nicholas Kristof]] has traveled to Darfur five times over a period of two years. His accounts of the ongoing violence has played a major role in raising awareness of the situation in Darfur, and has helped to mobilize grassroots campaigns against the violence. In February 2005, he published photographs he had received from the [[African Union Mission in Sudan|African Union]] peacekeeping troops, One was of a male child killed by the Janjaweed, his mother laying dead alongside of him. Another was the body of an adult male who had an injured leg, and had been unable to escape. The final was a skeleton of a male or female, hands bound, the clothing had been pulled down around the knees, so the person could have been assaulted sexually before being murdered. In 2014 Kristof wrote “Noura is one of thousands of women and girls to be gang-raped in Darfur, as part of what appears to be a deliberate Sudanese government policy to break the spirit of several African tribes through mass rape.”{{sfn|Grono|2014|p=44}}

== Proceedings of the International Criminal Court ==

[[Luis Moreno-Ocampo]], prosecutor for the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), having filed charges for crimes against humanity, is also pursuing in his application the charge of genocidal rape as such actions can be tried before the ICC as stand-alone crimes.{{sfn|Scheffer|2008}}

On 27 April 2007 the chamber issued an arrest warrant for [[Ahmed Haroun]] on charges of crimes against humanity. Moreno-Ocampo, prosecutor for the ICC accused Haroun, who was Minister of State at the time of the crimes, of arming and recruiting for the Janjaweed, with the sole purpose being the suppression of rebel attacks. Moreno-Ocampo has asserted that Haroun was "present as arms were distributed to fighters, had full knowledge of atrocities including rape and murder happening on the ground, and incited militias to slaughter civilians in speeches."{{sfn|Totten|2010|pp=XX-XXI}}&lt;ref name=ICC&gt;{{cite web|title=Darfur, Sudan|url=http://www.icc-cpi.int/en_menus/icc/situations%20and%20cases/situations/situation%20icc%200205/Pages/situation%20icc-0205.aspx|publisher=International Criminal Court|accessdate=1 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 June 2007, the ICC issued a warrant for the arrest of Ali Mohamed Ali, AKA: Ali Koship, Ali Kushayb, Ali Kosheib, Ali Kouchib, Ali Kosheb, Ali Koshib) on over forty charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes. Allegations against him include, but are not limited to mass murder, forced displacements and rape.{{sfn|Totten|2010|p=XIX}}{{sfn|Dubuisson|2007}}

On 4 March 2009 Sudanese president [[Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir]] was indicted by the ICC on five counts of [[crimes against humanity]] (murder, extermination, forcible transfer, torture, rape) and two counts of war crimes (direct attacks on civilians and pillaging). He is the first sitting head of state to have been indicted for crimes against humanity. A second warrant was issued for his arrest on 12 July 2010, as the Pre-Trial Chamber I of the ICC believed there were reasonable grounds that al-Bashir was culpable on three counts of genocide which had been carried out on the Fur, Masalit and the Zaghawa ethnic peoples.{{sfn|The Hague Justice Portal|2011}}{{sfn|Simons|2009}}

'''Raymond Robinson''' (October 29, 1910 – June 11, 1985) was a severely disfigured man whose years of nighttime walks made him into a figure of [[urban legend]] in western [[Pennsylvania]]. Robinson was so badly injured in a childhood electrical accident that he could not go out in public without fear of creating a panic, so he went for long walks at night. Local tourists would drive along his road in hopes of meeting '''The Green Man''' or '''Charlie No-Face'''. They passed on tales about him to their children and grandchildren, and people raised on these tales are sometimes surprised to discover that he was a real person who was liked by his family and neighbors.&lt;ref name="AT"&gt;{{Citation | last = Bauder | first = Bob  | title = Charlie No Face: The Life and the Legend | newspaper = Beaver County Times  | date = 2007-03-10 | url =http://www.timesonline.com/charlie-no-face-the-life-and-the-legend/article_b87c3f73-9069-5d83-9a83-e8f7a02cc5db.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825060124/http://www.timesonline.com/charlie-no-face-the-life-and-the-legend/article_b87c3f73-9069-5d83-9a83-e8f7a02cc5db.html|archivedate=August 25, 2017|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injury==
Robinson was nine years old when he was injured by an electrical line as he climbed a pole and reached for a bird's nest on the Morado Bridge, outside of [[Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania|Beaver Falls]]. The bridge carried a [[Tram|trolley]] and had [[Electric power transmission|electrical lines]] of both 1,200 [[volt|V]] and 22,000 V, which had killed another boy less than a year earlier. Robinson survived, defying doctors' expectations, but he was severely disfigured: he lost his eyes, nose, and right arm.&lt;ref name="AT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NCN"&gt;{{Citation | last = Morris | first = Debbie Wachter  | title = Local Green Man legend headed for the big screen | newspaper = New Castle News  | date = 2007-10-05 | url = http://www.ncnewsonline.com/news/local_news/local-green-man-legend-headed-for-the-big-screen/article_89864620-fe32-56af-9ef1-c74482b839d6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doctors Marvel That Boy Lives|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=oX4iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O68FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6775%2C2485221|work=The Daily Times|date=Aug 4, 1919|location=Beaver Falls|pages=1, 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adult life==
Robinson lived in [[Koppel, Pennsylvania|Koppel]] and spent his days at home with relatives, making doormats, wallets, and belts to sell.&lt;ref name="NCN2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncnewsmedia.com/archive/tim_galleries/SPECIAL_PROJECTS_07/OCTOBER/Green_Man/story0.htm|title=Writer taking legend|accessdate=November 6, 2007|work=NewCastle News| year=2007| last1=Morris | first1 = Debbie Wachter}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his appearance, he rarely ventured out during the day. However, at night, he went for long walks on a quiet stretch of [[Pennsylvania Route 351|State Route 351]], feeling his way along with a walking stick. Groups of locals regularly gathered to search for him walking along the road. Robinson usually hid from his curious neighbors, but would sometimes exchange a short conversation or a photograph for beer or cigarettes. Some were friendly, others cruel, but none of his encounters deterred Robinson from his nightly walks. He was struck by cars more than once.&lt;ref name="AT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ECL"&gt;{{Citation | last = Poole | first = Eric  | title = Green Man filmmakers in town | newspaper = Ellwood City Ledger  | date = 2007-10-09 | url = http://www.ellwoodcityledger.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18900686&amp;BRD=2724&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=563781&amp;rfi=6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710183432/https://www.ellwoodcityledger.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18900686&amp;BRD=2724&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=563781&amp;rfi=6 |archivedate=10 May 2017 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PG"&gt;{{Citation | last = Batz | first = Bob  | title = Green Man's legacy continues to glow | newspaper = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette  | date = 1998-10-31 | url = http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/19981031green4.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stopped his walks during the last years of his life, and retired to the Beaver County Geriatric Center, where he died in 1985 at the age of 74.&lt;ref name="AT"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Robinson became a local myth in the [[Pennsylvania]] area, and his real story was obscured by urban legend. In the stories, he is the "Green Man", and as a boy, he wanted to see into a bird's nest so he climbed an electric pole and managed to shock himself. He fell to the ground and lost his eyes, nose, mouth, one ear, and one arm. The story states that when he grew older, he hid in an abandoned house. The famed nickname of "Green Man" came from his skin, which was purported to be green because of the electrical shock he suffered in the stories.  Through several generations, Robinson's story has been passed on so many times that his name and his real history have been overshadowed by the [[ghost story]] that grew out of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4psutbMIOo|title=8 Urban Legends That Turned Out To Be True|last=Thoughty2|date=8 June 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A film, titled "Route 351" was planned to be produced by filmmaker Tisha York in 2008, to be completed in 2009. Shooting was delayed by the [[Great Recession in the United States|Great Recession]] and is on hold {{asof|2018|lc=on}}.

==History and profile==
''RNSAW'' was founded by a group of top [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] scholars in [[Egypt]] “to help cut through Western fear of Islam and promote dialogue.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arabwestreport.info|title=Arab West Report {{!}} Media Research and Commentary from Egypt and the Middle East|website=www.arabwestreport.info|language=en|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founders included [[Abd el Mo'ti Bayoumi]], dean of the faculty of [[theology]] at the [[Azhar University]], Coptic Orthodox Bishop Thomas, [[Christiaan van Nispen]] of the Catholic Seminary in [[Cairo]], Egypt and others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The electronic magazine worked with a fixed set of selection criteria for subjects taken from a fixed set of media, thereby providing a systematic [[non-partisan]] overview of changes in media reporting over the years. Articles selected concerned the role of Islam and Christianity in Egyptian society, Arab-West relations and continuing dialogue between the [[Arab world]] and the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabwestreport.info/page_details.php?d_id=79&amp;pname=Media%20watch%20policy Media Watch Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

''RNSAW'' helped in the compilation of a unique electronic archive that is of relevance to all who want to work towards better inter-cultural understanding. The magazine is frequently referenced by academics and students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabwestreport.info/page_details.php?d_id=20&amp;pname=Recommendations Arab West Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard Martin (curator).jpg|thumbnail|Richard Martin in 1996]]
'''Richard Martin''' (1947 – 1999) was a scholar, lecturer, critic and curator, and a leading [[Art history|art]] and fashion historian. At the time of his death he was curator of the Costume Institute at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], creating many critically acclaimed exhibitions and contributing widely towards publications on the subject. After his death, an award in his name was set up to recognise creative, high quality and innovative costume exhibitions.

==Early life and education==
'''Richard Harrison Martin''' was born December 4, 1946, at [[Bryn Mawr, PA]]. He studied at [[Swarthmore College]], graduating in 1967, and gained two [[master's degrees]], both from [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; As a lecturer, he held academic positions at the [[School of Visual Arts]], [[New York University]], Columbia, the [[Juilliard School]] and [[Parsons School of Design]].&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;

==Curatorship==
Richard Martin taught art history from 1973 at [[New York University]], the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] (FIT), and the [[School of Visual Arts]]. In 1980 he became involved with fashion exhibitions at FIT where he worked with [[Harold Koda]] and Laura Sinderbrand, the director of FIT's Design Laboratory (now the Museum at FIT).&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; He served as the editor in chief of [[Arts Magazine]] before his 1991 appointment as executive director of the Shirley Goodman Resource Center, which was responsible for FIT's exhibitions and collections.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;

The exhibitions Martin and Koda put up at FIT, including ''The East Village'', ''Fashion and [[Surrealism]]'', ''Undercover Story'', and ''Three Women: [[Madeleine Vionnet]], [[Claire McCardell]], [[Rei Kawakubo]]'' attracted a great deal of attention.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt; In 1987 they were given a special award from the [[Council of Fashion Designers of America]]. Martin would later win another award from the Council in 1996 "for furthering fashion in art and culture." &lt;ref name=ny&gt;Schiro, Anne-Marie, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800EEDA123AF93AA35752C1A96F958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/D/Deaths%20(Obituaries) Obituary for Richard Martin, 52, Curator of the Costume Institute], ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 9, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Koda, who worked closely with Martin on exhibitions until they parted company in 1997, later said:

:: "We did five or six shows a year at F.I.T. and three a year at the Met, while most museums do only one. And he always had three or four years' worth of ideas. Some fashion people had difficulty with his language, because his language was the language of art, not fashion."&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;

Martin wrote over 100 scholarly papers on a wide range of subjects, such as ''Art History and the Assimilation of Images by Contemporary Artists'', and ''Redress of the Nerds: The Assertion of Nerd Style in Men's Clothing and Imagery in the 1980s.'' He also wrote a number of books on fashion and art, including ''Fashion and Surrealism'' and ''[[Charles James (designer)|Charles James]],'' and co-authored others. Martin was critical of the tendency within the art world to designate fashion into a corner of its own, and not acknowledging designers as artists, rather than merely being commercially driven. He states: &lt;blockquote&gt;I think that’s an abiding problem for artists, that because fashion is so often thought to be less serious than art, artists are afraid that they will vitiate their own work and their own importance as artists by participating in any way in fashion. Artists will often shy away from fashion and yet when it comes to incorporating fashion into their own work—such as [[David Salle]] using sort of 1950s fashion sketches in his work—that’s perfectly acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Burt, Jillian. [http://bombsite.com/issues/26/articles/1159 "Interview with Richard Martin"] ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'' Winter, 1989. Retrieved May 22, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was also editor of ''[[Dress (journal)|Dress]]'', the [[Costume Society of America]]'s scholarly journal.&lt;ref name=rma/&gt;

==Death and legacy==

Richard Martin died at home in New York, aged 52, of [[melanoma]] on November 8, 1999. He was survived by his partner, Dr. Richard Slusarczyk; and by a brother, Robert.&lt;ref name=ny/&gt;

===The Richard Martin Award===

The Richard Martin Award for Excellence in the Exhibition of Costume was created by the Costume Society of America and launched in 2002. Martin was a valued member of the Society who, in addition to editing ''Dress'', had served on the Board of Directors for six years and stood as President of the Mid-Atlantic region of the Society.&lt;ref name=rma/&gt; The award is given to up to two institutions per year in recognition of high quality and innovative exhibitions of fashion and clothing.&lt;ref name=rma/&gt;&lt;ref name=mccord&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/info/pressreleases/119n.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090222065223/http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/info/pressreleases/119n.html |archivedate=2009-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Viven5.jpg|thumb|right|Parrado (left) and Canessa with [[Chile]]an ''[[Huaso]]'' Sergio Catalan.]]
'''Roberto Jorge Canessa Urta, M.D.,''' (born 17 January 1953&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://drcanessa.com/bio.html|title=Roberto Canessa Official Webpage|last=|first=|date=|website=Dr. Canessa|publisher=|access-date=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is one of the 16 survivors of the [[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571]], which crashed in the [[Andes]] mountains on 13 October 1972, and a [[Uruguay]]an political figure. He was portrayed by [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]] in the 1993 feature film, ''[[Alive (1993 film)|Alive]]''.

==13 October 1972 air crash==
At the time of the accident, Canessa was a 19-year-old medical student. His fianceé was Laura Surraco, the daughter of a doctor. He graduated from the [[Stella Maris College (Montevideo)]] and played for their alumni [[rugby football|rugby]] team, [[Old Christians Club]].  Between 1971 and 1979, he played eight matches with the [[Uruguay national rugby union team]], and was also selected in 1980, for the [[1980 South American Jaguars rugby union tour of South Africa|South American Jaguars tour of South Africa]].

It was Canessa who suggested to his fellow survivors that in order to stay alive,&lt;ref name="Useem2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Useem|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Useem|title=The Go Point: When It's Time to Decide--Knowing What to Do and When to Do It|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sNLYSLLRGZUC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=5 June 2011|date=2009-03-24|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-1-4000-8299-5|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt; they should eat the flesh of the deceased victims of the crash. Together with [[Nando Parrado|Fernando Parrado]], he spent 10 days trekking through the Andes in search of help for the survivors.

==Post rescue==
After the rescue, Canessa recounted how his drive to escape from the mountains was fueled by the thought of his mother and his girlfriend. He later married Laura Surraco, and they had two sons and a daughter. He works as a [[cardiology|cardio thoracic surgeon]] and [[motivational speaker]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Candidate for President of Uruguay==

Canessa was a candidate in the [[Uruguayan general election, 1994|1994 Uruguayan presidential elections]] but he failed to gain public support. Canessa obtained only 0.08%&lt;ref name="1994 Presidential Election Results in Uruguay (Spanish)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corteelectoral.gub.uy/gxpfiles/elecciones/elecciones_nacionales_1994.html|publisher=Corte Electoral del Uruguay|title=Elecciones nacionales de 1994|language=Spanish|accessdate=April 10, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007210334/http://www.corteelectoral.gub.uy/gxpfiles/elecciones/elecciones_nacionales_1994.html|archivedate=October 7, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of the vote, lagging far behind former President, [[Julio María Sanguinetti]], whose party returned to power with 30.83% of the public vote.

== Book ==
On 1 March 2016, Roberto, along with Pablo Vierci, published the book "I had to Survive"&lt;small&gt;({{ISBN|978-1476765440}})&lt;/small&gt; in which he tells the story of how he overcame adversity to become a prominent Pediatric Cardiologist.

During an interview made at CNN en Español, Canessa expressed that he wanted to help the survivors of the [[LaMia Flight 2933|tragedy of Chapecoense]] on Medellín, Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/video/cnnee-cafe-entrevista-roberto-canessa-milagro-de-los-andes/|title=Sobreviviente del 'Milagro de los Andes': "La vida es como viene, no como uno quiere"|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SABOTAGE CAN OUTWEIGH PRODUCTION - NARA - 515321.tif|thumb|A [[United States]] poster from the [[World War II]]-era that was used to inform people about what they should do if they suspect sabotage]]
'''Sabotage''' is a deliberate action aimed at weakening a [[polity]], effort or organization through subversion, obstruction, disruption or destruction&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Competition, contingency, and destabilization in urban assemblages and actor-networks. Urban Geography, vol. 39 (5), pp. 655-666; https://doi.org/10.1080/02723638.2017.1382307  &lt;/ref&gt;. One who engages in sabotage is a ''saboteur''. Saboteurs typically try to conceal their identities because of the consequences of their actions.

Any unexplained adverse condition might be sabotage. Sabotage is sometimes called tampering, meddling, tinkering, malicious pranks, malicious hacking, a practical joke or the like to avoid needing to invoke legal and organizational requirements for addressing sabotage&lt;ref&gt;Ambrose, M.L., Seabright, M.A. and Schminke, M., 2002. Sabotage in the workplace: The role of organizational injustice. Organizational behavior and human decision processes, 89(1), pp.947-965.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Etymology ==
A popular but false account of the origin of the term's present meaning is the story that less wealthy workers in France, who wore not leather but wooden shoes, used to throw these ''[[Sabot (shoe)|sabots]]'' into the machines to disrupt production.&lt;ref name="etymonline"/&gt; This account is not supported by the etymology.&lt;ref name="etymonline"/&gt; Rather, the French source word literally means to "walk noisily," as was done by sabot-wearing labourers, who interrupted production by means of labor disputes, not damage.&lt;ref name="etymonline"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=sabotage |title=Sabotage  |website=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of its first appearances in French literature is in the ''Dictionnaire du Bas-Langage ou manières de parler usitées parmi le peuple'' of D'Hautel, edited in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;

The verb "saboter" is also found in 1873–1874 in the ''Dictionnaire de la langue française'' of [[Émile Littré]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Émile |last=Littré |title=Dictionnaire de la langue française |trans-title=Dictionary of the French language|publisher=Hachette |date=1873–1874 |page=1790 |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k54066991/f401}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it is at the end of the 19th century that it really began to be used with the meaning of "deliberately and maliciously destroying property" or "working slower". In 1897, [[Émile Pouget]], a famous [[syndicalist]] and [[anarchist]] wrote "action de saboter un travail" (action of sabotaging a work) in ''Le Père Peinard''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pouget |first=Émile |date=1976 |title=Le Père Peinard |url=http://www.editions-galilee.fr/f/index.php?sp=liv&amp;livre_id=3033 |page=53 |publisher=Éditions Galilée |isbn=2718600306}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1911 he also wrote a book entitled ''Le Sabotage''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pouget |first=Émile |date=1911 |title=Le Sabotage |url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Sabotage |publisher=Marcel Rivière}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As industrial action ==
[[File:Picchetto sabotaggio stencil in Turin.jpg|thumb|Unauthorized stencil urging sabotage and [[picketing]]]]
At the inception of the [[Industrial Revolution]], skilled workers such as the [[Luddite]]s (1811–1812) used sabotage as a means of negotiation in labor disputes.

[[Trade unions|Labor unions]] such as the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW) have [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Sabotage|advocated sabotage]] as a means of self-defense and [[direct action]] against unfair working conditions.

The IWW was shaped in part by the [[industrial unionism]] philosophy of [[Bill Haywood|Big Bill Haywood]], and in 1910 Haywood was exposed to sabotage while touring Europe:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The experience that had the most lasting impact on Haywood was witnessing a general strike on the French railroads. Tired of waiting for parliament to act on their demands, railroad workers walked off their jobs all across the country. The French government responded by drafting the strikers into the army and then ordering them back to work. Undaunted, the workers carried their strike to the job. Suddenly, they could not seem to do anything right. Perishables sat for weeks, sidetracked and forgotten. Freight bound for Paris was misdirected to Lyon or Marseille instead. This tactic — the French called it "sabotage" — won the strikers their demands and impressed Bill Haywood.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jimthor, Stablewars, May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For the IWW, sabotage's meaning expanded to include the original use of the term: [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics#Sabotage|any withdrawal of efficiency]], including the [[slowdown]], the [[strike action|strike]], [[working to rule]], or creative bungling of job assignments.&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages&amp;nbsp;196–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most severe examples was at the construction site of the [[Robert-Bourassa generating station|Robert-Bourassa Generating Station]] in 1974, in Québec, Canada, when workers used bulldozers to topple electric generators, damaged fuel tanks, and set buildings on fire.  The project was delayed a year, and the direct cost of the damage estimated at $2 million CAD. The causes were not clear, but three possible factors have been cited: inter-union rivalry, poor working conditions, and the perceived arrogance of American executives of the contractor, [[Bechtel]] Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;Rinehart, J.W. ''The Tyranny of Work'', Canadian Social Problems Series. Academic Press Canada (1975), pp.&amp;nbsp;78–79. {{ISBN|0-7747-3029-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== As environmental action ==
{{Main|Ecotage}}
Certain groups turn to destruction of property to stop environmental destruction or to make visible arguments against forms of modern technology they consider detrimental to the environment. The U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and other law enforcement agencies use the term [[eco-terrorist]] when applied to damage of property. Proponents argue that since property cannot feel terror, damage to property is more accurately described as sabotage. Opponents, by contrast, point out that property owners and operators can indeed feel terror. The image of the [[monkey wrench]] thrown into the moving parts of a machine to stop it from working was popularized by [[Edward Abbey]] in the novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'' and has been adopted by eco-activists to describe destruction of earth damaging machinery.

From 1992 to late 2007 a radical environmental activist movement known as ELF or [[Earth Liberation Front]] engaged in a near constant campaign of decentralized sabotage of any construction projects near wild lands and extractive industries such as logging and even the burning down of a ski resort of Vail Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;[[Earth Liberation Front]]{{unreliable source?|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ELF used sabotage tactics often in loose coordination with other environmental activist movements to physically delay or destroy threats to wild lands as the political will developed to protect the targeted wild areas that ELF engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.targetofopportunity.com/elf.htm|title=Earth Liberation Front|work=targetofopportunity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iww.org/history/library/Bari/TreeSpiking1|title=The Secret History of Tree Spiking – Part 1|work=iww.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As war tactic ==
[[File:"WARNING FROM THE FBI" - NARA - 516039.jpg|thumb|[[World War II]] poster from the United States]]

In war, the word is used to describe the activity of an individual or group not associated with the military of the parties at war, such as a foreign [[Espionage#Agents in espionage|agent]] or an indigenous supporter, in particular when actions result in the destruction or damaging of a productive or vital facility, such as equipment, factories, dams, public services, storage plants or [[logistics|logistic]] routes. Prime examples of such sabotage are the events of [[Black Tom explosion|Black Tom]] and the [[Kingsland Explosion]]. Like spies, saboteurs who conduct a military operation in civilian clothes or enemy uniforms behind enemy lines are subject to prosecution and criminal penalties instead of detention as [[prisoners of war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Social History of Crime and Punishment in America: An Encyclopedia |author=Wilbur Redington Miller |date=29 June 2012 |page=186 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |isbn=0-7618-6137-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Why We Fight: The Origins, Nature, and Management of Human Conflict |author=David Churchman |date=9 May 2013 |page=186 |publisher=[[University Press of America]] |isbn=0-7618-6137-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is common for a government in power during war or supporters of the war policy to use the term loosely against opponents of the war. Similarly, German [[nationalist]]s spoke of a [[stab in the back legend|stab in the back]] having cost them the loss of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dokumentarfilm.com/en/030303.htm Dokumentarfilm.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060226201823/http://www.dokumentarfilm.com/en/030303.htm |date=26 February 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern form of sabotage is the distribution of software intended to damage specific industrial systems. For example, the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) is alleged to have [[Siberian pipeline sabotage|sabotaged a Siberian pipeline]] during the [[Cold War]], using information from the [[Farewell Dossier]]. A more recent case may be the [[Stuxnet]] [[computer worm]], which was designed to subtly infect and damage specific types of industrial equipment. Based on the equipment targeted and the location of infected machines, security experts believe it was an attack on the [[Iran]]ian [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear program]] by the [[United States]], [[Israel]] or, according to the latest news, even [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Markoff, John, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/science/13stuxnet.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Malware%20Aimed%20At%20Iran%20Hit%20Five%20Sites,%20Report%20Says&amp;st=cse Malware Aimed at Iran Hit Five Sites, Report Says]", ''[[New York Times]]'', 13 February 2011, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabotage, done well, is inherently difficult to detect and difficult to trace to its origin. During [[World War II]], the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) investigated 19,649 cases of sabotage and concluded the enemy had not caused any of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marrin|first=Albert|title=The Secret Armies : Spies, Counterspies, and Saboteurs in World War II|year=1985|publisher=Atheneum|location=New York|isbn=0-689-31165-6|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabotage in warfare, according to the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) manual, varies from highly technical ''coup de main'' acts that require detailed planning and specially trained operatives, to innumerable simple acts that ordinary citizen-saboteurs can perform. Simple sabotage is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury, detection, and [[reprisal]]. There are two main methods of sabotage; physical destruction and the "human element". While physical destruction as a method is self-explanatory, its targets are nuanced, reflecting objects to which the saboteur has normal and inconspicuous access in everyday life. The "human element" is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions, to adopt a non-cooperative attitude, and to induce others to follow suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services Simple Sabotage Manuel|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|pages=1–2|date=17 January 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many examples of physical sabotage in wartime. However, one of the most effective uses of sabotage is against organizations. The OSS manual provides numerous techniques under the title "General Interference with Organizations and Production":

* When possible, refer all matters to committees for "further study and consideration". Attempt to make the committees as large as possible—never fewer than five
* Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.
* Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.
* In making work assignments, always sign out unimportant jobs first, assign important jobs to inefficient workers with poor machines.
* Insist on perfect work in relatively unimportant products; send back for refinishing those with the least flaw.  Approve other defective parts whose flaws are not visible to the naked eye.
* To lower morale, and with it, production, be pleasant to inefficient workers; give them undeserved promotions.  Discriminate against efficient workers; complain unjustly about their work.
* Hold meetings when there is more critical work to be done.
* Multiply procedures and clearances involved in issuing instructions, pay checks, and so on.  See that multiple people must approve everything where one would do.
* Spread disturbing rumors that sound like inside information.

From the section entitled, "General Devices for Lowering Morale and Creating Confusion" comes the following quintessential simple sabotage advice: "Act stupid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services Simple Sabotage Manuel|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|pages=28–31|date=17 January 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Value of simple sabotage in wartime ===
The United States [[Office of Strategic Services]], later renamed the CIA, noted specific value in committing simple sabotage against the enemy during wartime: "...&amp;nbsp;slashing tires, draining fuel tanks, starting fires, starting arguments, acting stupidly, short-circuiting electric systems, abrading machine parts will waste materials, manpower, and time." To underline the importance of simple sabotage on a widespread scale, they wrote, "Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police." The OSS was also focused on the battle for hearts and minds during wartime; "the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the [[United Nations]] War effort, and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of Strategic Services|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/26184/page-images/26184-images.pdf|accessdate=24 March 2012|page=2|date=17 January 1944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In World War I ===
On 30 July 1916, the [[Black Tom explosion]] occurred when German agents set fire to a complex of warehouses and ships in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] that held munitions, fuel, and explosives bound to aid the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in their fight.

On 11 January 1917, Fiodore Wozniak, using a rag saturated with phosphorus or an incendiary pencil supplied by German sabotage agents, [[Kingsland Explosion|set fire to his workbench]] at an ammunition assembly plant near [[Lyndhurst, New Jersey]], causing a four-hour fire that destroyed half a million 3-inch explosive shells and destroyed the plant for an estimated at $17 million in damages. Wozniak's involvement was not discovered until 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGeorge II|first=Harvey J.|author2=Christine C.

On 12 February 1917, [[Arab Revolt|Bedouins allied with the British]] destroyed a Turkish railroad near the port of [[Wajh]], [[Derailment|derailing]] a Turkish locomotive. The Bedouins traveled by camel and used explosives to demolish a portion of track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conduit, D.M.|title=Challenge and Response in Internal Conflict, Volume II: The Experience in Europe and the Middle East|year=1968|publisher=The American University|location=Washington|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post World War I ===
[[File:193109 mukden incident railway sabotage.jpg|thumb|[[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] experts inspect the scene of the "railway sabotage" on the [[South Manchurian Railway]] in 1931. The "railroad sabotage" was one of the events that led to the [[Mukden Incident]] and the Japanese occupation of [[Manchuria]].]]

In Ireland, the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) used sabotage against the British following the Easter 1916 uprising. The IRA compromised communication lines and lines of transportation and fuel supplies. The IRA also employed passive sabotage, refusing dock and train workers to work on ships and rail cars used by the government. In 1920, agents of the IRA committed arson against at least fifteen British warehouses in Liverpool. The following year, the IRA set fire to numerous British targets again, including the Dublin Customs House, this time sabotaging most of Liverpool's firetrucks in the firehouses before lighting the matches.&lt;ref name="Howard L.

=== In World War II ===
Sabotage training for the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] consisted of teaching would-be saboteurs key components of working machinery to destroy.
"Saboteurs learned hundreds of small tricks to cause the Germans big trouble. The cables in a telephone junction box&amp;nbsp;... could be jumbled to make the wrong connections when numbers were dialed. A few ounces of [[plastique]], properly placed, could bring down a bridge, cave in a mine shaft, or collapse the roof of a railroad tunnel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marrin|first=Albert|title=The Secret Armies : Spies, Counterspies, and Saboteurs in World War II|year=1985|publisher=Atheneum|location=New York|isbn=0-689-31165-6|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Polish Home Army [[Armia Krajowa]], who commanded the majority of resistance organizations in Poland (even the National Forces, except the [[Military Organization Lizard Union]]; The Home Army also included the [[Polish Socialist Party – Freedom, Equality, Independence]]) and coordinating and aiding the [[Jewish Military Union]] as well as more reluctantly helping the [[Jewish Combat Organization]], was responsible for the greatest number of acts of sabotage in German—occupied Europe. The Home Army's sabotage operations [[Operation Wieniec|Operation Garland]] and [[Operation Belt|Operation Ribbon]] are just two examples. In all, the Home Army damaged 6,930 locomotives, set 443 rail transports on fire, damaged over 19,000 rail cars "wagony," and blew up 38 rail bridges, not to mention the attacks against the rail roads. The Home Army was also responsible for 4,710 built-in flaws in parts for aircraft engines and 92,000 built-in flaws in artillery projectiles, among other examples of significant sabotage. In addition, over 25,000 acts of more minor sabotage were committed. It continued to fight against both the Germans and the Soviets; however, it did aid the Western Allies by collecting constant and detailed information on the German rail, wheeled, and horse transports.&lt;ref&gt;[[Home Army#Major operations]]&lt;/ref&gt; As for Stalin's proxies, their actions lead to a great number of the Polish and Jewish hostages, mostly civilians, murdered in reprisal by the Germans. The [[Gwardia Ludowa]] destroyed around 200 German trains during the war, and indiscriminately threw hand grenades into places frequented by Germans.

The [[French Resistance]] ran an extremely effective sabotage campaign against the Germans during World War II. Receiving their sabotage orders through messages over the [[BBC radio]] or by aircraft, the French used both passive and active forms of sabotage. Passive forms included losing German shipments and allowing poor quality material to pass factory inspections. Many active sabotage attempts were against critical rail lines of transportation. German records count 1,429 instances of sabotage from French Resistance forces between January 1942 and February 1943. From January through March 1944, sabotage accounted for three times the number of locomotives damaged by Allied air power.&lt;ref name="Howard L. Douthit III, Captain, USAF 1988" /&gt; See also [[Normandy Landings]] for more information about sabotage on [[D-Day]].

During World War II, the Allies committed sabotage against the Peugeot truck factory. After repeated failures in Allied bombing attempts to hit the factory, a team of French Resistance fighters and [[Special Operations Executive]] (SOE) agents distracted the German guards with a game of soccer while part of their team entered the plant and destroyed machinery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marrin|first=Albert|title=The Secret Armies : Spies, Counterspies, and Saboteurs in World War II|year=1985|publisher=Atheneum|location=New York|isbn=0-689-31165-6|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1944, the Germans ran a [[false flag]] sabotage infiltration, [[Operation Greif]], which was commanded by [[Waffen-SS]] [[commando]] [[Otto Skorzeny]] during the [[Battle of the Bulge]]. German [[commando]]s, wearing [[United States Army uniforms in World War II|US Army uniforms]], carrying [[US Army]] weapons, and using US Army vehicles, penetrated US lines to spread panic and confusion among US troops and to blow up bridges, [[ammunition dump]]s, and fuel stores and to disrupt the lines of communication. Many of the commandos were captured by the Americans. Because they were wearing US uniforms, a number of the Germans were executed as spies, either [[Summary execution|summarily]] or after [[military commissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Ardennes, 1944: Peiper and Skorzeny |author=Jean-Paul Pallud |date=28 May 1987 |page=15 |publisher=[[Osprey Publishing]] |isbn=0-85045-740-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1948 to 1960, the Malayan Communists committed numerous effective acts of sabotage against the [[Malaysian Government]], first targeting railway bridges, then hitting larger targets such as military camps. Most of their efforts were centered around crippling [[Malaysia]]'s economy and involved sabotage against trains, rubber trees, water pipes, and electric lines. The Communist's sabotage efforts were so successful that they caused backlash amongst the Malaysian population, who gradually withdrew support for the Communist movement as their livelihoods became threatened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Report prepared by the Historical Evaluation and Research Organization under contract for the Army Research Office|title=Isolating the Guerrilla: Classic and Basic Case Studies (Volume II)|year=1966|publisher=Historical Evaluation and Research Organization|location=Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mandatory Palestine]] from 1945 to 1948, Jewish groups opposed British control. Though that control was to end according to the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] in 1948, the groups used sabotage as an opposition tactic. The [[Haganah]] focused their efforts on camps used by the British to hold refugees and radar installations that could be used to detect illegal immigrant ships. The [[Stern Gang]] and the [[Irgun]] used terrorism and sabotage against the British government and against lines of communications. In November 1946, the Irgun and Stern Gang attacked a railroad twenty-one times in a three-week period, eventually causing shell-shocked Arab railway workers to strike. The [[6th Airborne Division]] was called in to provide security as a means of ending the strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conduit, D.M.|title=Challenge and Response In Internal Conflict, Volume II: The Experience in Europe and the Middle East.|year=1967|publisher=The American University|location=Washington|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Vietnam ===
The [[Viet Cong]] used swimmer saboteurs often and effectively during the [[Vietnam War]]. Between 1969 and 1970, swimmer saboteurs sunk, destroyed, or damaged 77 assets of the U.S. and its allies. Viet Cong swimmers were poorly equipped but well-trained and resourceful. The swimmers provided a low-cost/low-risk option with high payoff; possible loss to the country for failure compared to the possible gains from a successful mission led to the obvious conclusion the swimmer saboteurs were a good idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Babyak, E.E., Jr., LtJG, USN|title=Swimmer Sabotage or The Most Dangerous Mine|year=1971|publisher=Naval Mine Warfare School|location=Charleston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During the Cold War ===
On 1 January 1984, the Cuscatlan bridge over [[Lempa river]] in [[El Salvador]], critical to flow of commercial and military traffic, was destroyed by guerrilla forces using explosives after using mortar fire to "scatter" the bridge's guards, causing an estimated $3.7 million in required repairs, and considerably impacting on El Salvadoran business and security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGeorge II|first=Harvey J.|author2=Christine C.

== As crime ==
Some criminals have engaged in acts of sabotage for reasons of [[extortion]]. For example, [[Klaus-Peter Sabotta]] sabotaged German railway lines in the late 1990s in an attempt to extort [[Deutsche Mark|DM]]10 million from the German railway operator [[Deutsche Bahn]]. He is now serving a sentence of [[life imprisonment]]. In 1989, ex-[[Scotland Yard]] detective Rodney Whitchelo was sentenced to 17 years in prison for spiking Heinz baby food products in supermarkets, in an extortion attempt on the food manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/food-scare-scandals-1100385.html|title=Food Scare Scandals|publisher=The Independent|date=1999-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== As political action ==

The term political sabotage is sometimes used to define the acts of one political camp to disrupt, harass or damage the reputation of a political opponent, usually during an electoral campaign, such as during [[Watergate]]. [[Smear campaign]]s are a commonly used tactic.  The term could also describe the actions and expenditures of private entities, corporations and organizations against democratically approved or enacted laws, policies and programs.

After the Cold War ended, the [[Mitrokhin Archives]] were declassified, which included detailed [[KGB]] plans of [[active measures]] to subvert politics in opposing nations.

=== In a coup d'etat ===
Sabotage is a crucial tool of the successful [[coup d'etat]], which requires control of communications before, during, and after the coup is staged.  Simple sabotage against physical communications platforms using semi-skilled technicians, or even those trained only for this task, could effectively silence the target government of the coup, leaving the [[War of ideas|information battle space]] open to the dominance of the coup's leaders.  To underscore the effectiveness of sabotage, "A single cooperative technician will be able temporarily to put out of action a [[radio station]] which would otherwise require a full-scale [[assault]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luttwak|first=Edward|title=Coup d'Etat, a Practical Handbook|year=1968|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=London|isbn=0-674-17547-6|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Railroads, where strategically important to the regime the coup is against, are prime targets for sabotage—if a section of the track is damaged entire portions of the transportation network can be stopped until it is fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luttwak|first=Edward|title=Coup d'Etat, a Practical Handbook|year=1968|publisher=The Penguin Press|location=London|isbn=0-674-17547-6|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Derivative usages ==

=== Sabotage radio ===
A sabotage radio was a small [[two-way radio]] designed for use by [[resistance movement]]s in World War II, and after the war often used by [[exploration|expeditions]] and similar parties.

=== Cybotage ===
Arquilla and Rondfeldt, in their work entitled ''Networks and Netwars'', differentiate their definition of "[[netwar]]" from a list of "trendy synonyms," including "cybotage," a portmanteau from the words "sabotage" and "[[Internet-related prefixes|cyber]]".  They dub the practitioners of cybotage "cyboteurs" and note while all cybotage is not netwar, some netwar is cybotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Networks and Netwars|year=2001|publisher=RAND|isbn=0-8330-3030-2|editor1=John Arquilla |editor2=David Ronfeldt |pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Counter-sabotage ===
Counter-sabotage, defined by ''[[Webster's Dictionary]]'', is "counterintelligence designed to detect and counteract sabotage". The [[United States Department of Defense]] definition, found in the ''Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms'', is "action designed to detect and counteract sabotage. See also [[counterintelligence]]".

==== In World War II ====
During World War II, British subject [[Eddie Chapman]], trained by the Germans in sabotage, became a double agent for the British.  The German [[Abwehr]] entrusted Chapman to destroy the British de Havilland Company's main plant which manufactured the outstanding Mosquito light bomber, but required photographic proof from their agent to verify the mission's completion. A special unit of the Royal Engineers known as the Magic Gang covered the de Havilland plant with canvas panels and scattered papier-mâché furniture and chunks of masonry around three broken and burnt giant generators. Photos of the plant taken from the air reflected devastation for the factory and a successful sabotage mission, and Chapman, as a British sabotage double-agent, fooled the Germans for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marrin|first=Albert|title=The Secret Armies|year=1985|publisher=Atheneum|location=New York|isbn=0-689-31165-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Borrowed into Japanese ===
In Japanese, the verb [[Gairaigo#Grammatical function|saboru]] (サボる) means to skip school or loaf on the job.

The GDC/BC Salazar Student Awards was established in 1985 by The [[Society of Graphic Designers of Canada]]/British Columbia Chapter in honour of [[Enrique Salazar]].

==Background==
[[Image:Enrique-Salazar-April-77.jpg|250px|thumb|right|The late Canadian Graphic Designer Enrique Salazar.]]Enrique Salazar was a founding member of the BC chapter of the [[Society of Graphic Designers of Canada|GDC]] in the 1970s and served as BC's National Representative. He was a dedicated and talented designer who shared his passion and knowledge of design through teaching at [[Capilano University]] as well as working in the commercial field running his own creative agency Salazar Graphics in partnership with his brother [http://www.salazar.ca Santiago Salazar, A.K.A. Lisa Salazar]. Unfortunately the industry lost Enrique to cancer in June 1985 and the Salazar Awards were created by GDC and founding sponsor Met Printers to continue on his passion and commitment to design and communications education.

''The Salazar brothers were born in Colombia and in 1960 their family moved to the United States, making their home in San Jose, California. Enrique attended West Valley College and hoped to eventually become an architect. In 1968, during the height of the war in Vietnam, he accepted a job offer as a draftsman at a new startup high-tech company in Vancouver, Canada. In the mean time, Santiago graduated from high school and enrolled at San Jose State University to study graphic design. Enrique eventually shifted his focus to graphic design as well and without any formal training, began to produce marketing materials for the company he worked for. One day he saw an ad for an in-house graphic designer at Finning Tractor, the largest Caterpillar dealer in North America, where he honed his skills and learned about print production.''

''After Santiago's graduation in 1972, Enrique convinced him to move to Vancouver so they could start their own studio. Reluctant at first, Santiago eventually caved in to Enrique's persuasion, arriving in Vancouver in 1973. Salazar Graphics was founded the following year, with an office at the west end of Vancouver's Gastown district, which at the time had become the epicenter for graphic designers. In 1980, the Salazar brothers were introduced to the retiring head of the Graphic Design and Illustration program at Capilano University and were invited to develop a course, which they titled "Studio Production," and the two brothers taught the course as a tag-team, alternating each week. For the fall semester in 1984, due to family business obligations, Santiago had to leave the teaching to Enrique. It was at the end of the semester Enrique's health began to deteriorate and resigned as instructor. Santiago returned to teaching the following year.''

Since 1956 the GDC has been dedicated to improving graphic design standards and practice, in the workplace and in schools, and the importance of nurturing design professionals and attracting young talent to the industry cannot be over-emphasized. This is the primary reason for events such as Salazar Awards. The Salazar Student Design Awards encourage and support students in taking their design education to a level that will better prepare them for professional practice.

A judging committee of top design professionals review submissions and select winners and honourable mentions based on strategy and rationales provided, as well as the level of visual execution. Winning students and honourable mentions are be promoted to the design, advertising and business communities through an awards evening and exhibit of their work.

Speakers at recent Salazar awards ceremonies have included Coudal Partners founder [[Jim Coudal]] [2006], Rethink Creative Director Ian Grais [2007], legendary designer Stefan Sagmeister [2008] and Michael Osborne of MOD &amp; Joey's Corner [2009].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6174">[[Image:Toby1.jpg|thumb|right|Toby the rabbit.]]
'''Save Toby''' was a humor [[website]].  The premise of the site was that the website's anonymous webmasters would eat Toby, a pet [[rabbit]], unless they received $50,000 in donations to care for it. The website also spawned a book, fully titled: '''''Save Toby: Only YOU have the power to save Toby!'''''

== SaveToby.com ==

The website was created near the beginning of 2005.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snopes.com/critters/crusader/savetoby.asp|title=Save Toby|publisher=Urban Legends Reference Pages (snopes.com)|accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The website claimed that the owner found Toby wounded outside his home, and nursed the rabbit back to health, not believing it would survive.  However, it did, and he was unable to afford to care for him. The website then claimed that, unless he received $50,000 in [[US dollar]]s to pay for its care, he would eat the rabbit.&lt;ref name="register"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/13/rabbit_extortion/ |title=Give me $50k or the rabbit dies|publisher=The Register|accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The money could be either donated directly, or through purchasing "Save Toby" merchandise.  The website includes several pictures of Toby, as well as many [[recipe]]s that can be used to prepare and cook rabbit.&lt;ref name="clarin"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/03/21/sociedad/s-02901.htm |title=Una página de Internet pide dinero a cambio de no matar a un conejo |publisher=Clarin.com|accessdate=2008-06-12|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The webmasters have remained anonymous, claiming they have received [[death threat]]s.&lt;ref name="clarin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nbc"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Rabbit Death threat engages animal activists| url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7406483/|series=NBC Nightly News|airdate=2005-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They go by the names "James" and "Brian"; however, "James" admits his name is a [[pseudonym]].&lt;ref name="clarin"/&gt;

The original deadline for receiving the money was June 30, 2005. When the deadline passed, they extended it to November 6, 2006, claiming that problems with [[Paypal]] made it impossible for people to donate money and that it was the only fair thing to do for Toby.&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="savetoby1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savetoby.com/updates/13.php|title=Save Toby website update page|publisher=SaveToby.com|accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later changed to [[Thanksgiving Day]], 2006, because of the release of the book.  In December 2006, the site announced that humor/games website [http://www.bored.com bored.com] had purchased the website, and therefore Toby had been saved.&lt;ref name="goldmans"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.ericgoldman.org/personal/archives/2006/12/savetobycom_the.html|title=SaveToby.com -- the Final Chapter|accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is claimed that over $24,000 was collected by the website.&lt;ref name="register"/&gt;

== Save Toby: Only YOU have the power to save Toby! ==

The book was released in September 2005.  The book made a new threat: if 100,000 copies of the book were not sold, Toby would be eaten at [[Thanksgiving dinner]].&lt;ref name="savetoby2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.savetoby.com/updates/14.php|title=Save Toby book press release|accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of copies of the book sold is unknown.  The book includes pictures of Toby, and various recipes for cooking rabbit. It also has instructions on how to run a similar site.&lt;ref name="age"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/web/theres-one-born-every-minute/2007/11/07/1194329266039.html?page=fullpage|title=There's one born every minute|publisher=The Age|accessdate=2008-06-12 | location=Melbourne | date=2007-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public response &amp; legitimacy ==
[[Image:Tobybook.jpg|thumb|right|The cover of the Save Toby book.]]
The website received media attention throughout the [[United States]] and in other countries. Toby was also featured on [[NBC Nightly News]].&lt;ref name="nbc"/&gt;

The website made many [[animal rights]] activists upset, claiming that the owners were engaging in [[animal cruelty]]. They attempted to have the site removed; however, the company that hosted the site, [[Go Daddy]], claimed that there was nothing illegal about the site and that "it was perfectly legal to eat a rabbit".&lt;ref name="clarin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nbc"/&gt; PayPal accounts used for donations were often frozen due to complaints about the site.&lt;ref name="age"/&gt;

There have also been questions about whether or not the site was legitimate. The owners, when asked, claimed that the site was completely serious and they would eat the rabbit.&lt;ref name="nbc"/&gt; However, the nature of the website suggests it is a hoax or joke, a retelling of older jokes that threaten harm to an animal unless you buy a product (for example, [[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]] once ran a cover with a gun aimed at a puppy, stating "If You Don't buy This Magazine, We'll Kill This Dog").&lt;ref name="register"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clarin"/&gt; The site itself never makes it clear that it is a joke; however, "funny" and "humor" are included in the site's [[Meta element#The keywords attribute|search keywords]].

There were other similar websites in existence around the same time that threatened to eat a rabbit unless a monetary demand was met. One, ''Save Bernd!'', copied Save Toby. It demanded a 1,000,000 [[euro]] ransom. The site claims that "Bernd is gone", but not that he was eaten. Small letters at the bottom of the page make it clear that "It's a joke".&lt;ref name="snopes"/&gt;

The '''World Scrabble Championship 2014''', renamed by Mattel to '''Scrabble Champions Tournament''' in 2013, was held at the ExCeL London Exhibition and Convention Centre, [[London]] in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mindsportsevents.com/media/179431/sct-2014.pdf{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that the World 
Championship had become an open event when [[Mind Sports International|MSI]] invited all players to compete. However, due to the high entry fee and high venue cost, only 108 players entered and the prize money had to be limited.

==Results==
The winner was Craig Beevers of [[Guisborough]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[England]] who defeated Chris Lipe of [[Clinton, Clinton County, New York|Clinton]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]  three games to one in the best-of-five finals.&lt;ref&gt;http://event.poslfit.com/games/sct2014/&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second game, Chris opened with bingo BuNGLES, [[wikt:astroid|ASTROID]] and [[wikt:taenioid|TAENIOID]] while Craig had [[wikt:blokart|BLOKART]]S, OpERATIC and CHEQUERS. Craig also had a 69-point ZETA to take the game 524 - 419.

In the third game, Chris had five bingos JOLLIES, [[wikt:guenon|GUENON]]s, FELONIES, [[wikt:limbate|LIMBATE ]] and BiVALENT while Craig had SHEDDERS and tried to pull back with an 89 point UPTRAIN but it wasn't enough and Chris won 509 - 464.

In the final game, Craig had bingos [[wikt:ventrous|VENTROUS]], [[wikt:gaiety|GAIETIEs]], [[wikt:diorite|DIORItE]] while Chris had DIRECTER and a 60-point [[wikt:xenic|XENIC]] but Craig sealed the win with a 42-point [[wikt:talaq|TALAQ]] to take the game 438 - 414 and the title of World Champion.

Beevers, whose prize was £3,000, has been playing for 12 years and was the [[National Scrabble Championship (UK)|2009 UK champion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-30168522|title=BBC News - World Scrabble Championship won by Craig Beevers|work=BBC News|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third and fourth were [[Dave Wiegand]] and [[Adam Logan]] respectively.

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2401]], adopted on 28 February 2018, called for a nationwide ceasefire in Syria for 30 days, including Eastern Ghouta, but the [[Syrian Army]] continued the offensive. In March 2018, the Syrian Army split the enclave into three parts, reaching an agreement with the rebels to withdraw to the north, to [[Idlib]]. This action displaced 105,000 people from the area. Douma was the only city left by the end of that month that was not under Syrian government control.

Thousands of people were killed during this 5-year siege period. Numerous [[war crimes]] allegations were made during the siege, among others from the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], including the use of prohibited weapons, attacks on civilians, attacks against protected objects (schools, hospitals), [[starvation]] as a method of warfare and denial of [[medical evacuation]].

==Background==

{{see also|Rif Dimashq Governorate campaign|Battle of Douma}}
Prior to the [[Syrian Civil War]], the total population of Eastern [[Ghouta]], a collection of farms and cities near [[Damascus]], was around 1.5 million people.&lt;ref name="1 February 2018 U.N. Report"/&gt; During the [[Civil uprising phase of the Syrian Civil War|civil unrest]] that began in Syria in March 2011, some of the eastern Ghouta residents took part in the protests against the Syrian president [[Bashar Al-Assad]] and joined the [[Syrian rebels]] and [[Rif Dimashq offensive (November 2012–February 2013)|expelled Syrian government forces]] by November 2012.&lt;ref name="Living Under Assad’s Siege"&gt;{{cite news|title=Living Under Assad’s Siege|publisher=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/opinion/syria-bombing-assad.html| date=7 February 2018|author=Yassin Al-Haj Saleh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Syrian rebels [[Damascus offensive (2013)|captured]] parts of the ring road on the edge of Damascus and entered the [[Jobar|Jobar district]] of the capital city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/world/middleeast/syrian-war-closes-in-on-the-heart-of-damascus.html?pagewanted=1&amp;pagewanted=print | title=Damascus on Edge as War Seeps into Syrian Capital | work=New York Times | date=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backed by [[Iran]] and [[Hezbollah]], the [[Syrian Arab Army]] counterattacked and in April 2013 began a siege of Eastern Ghouta, which is just 15 km or a half hour's drive outside the capital Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Syria: Children Under Attack in Damascus Enclave: UN Security Council Should Act on Eastern Ghouta Situation | publisher=Human Rights Watch| url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/01/11/syria-children-under-attack-damascus-enclave| date=11 January 2018| accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cut off from the rest of the country, the population of Eastern Ghouta resorted to [[incineration of plastics]] to generate electricity. In early 2015, when the Syrian government cut off water supplies to [[Duma, Syria|Duma]], the population adapted yet again and dug over 600 underground wells, using manual pumps to supply water.&lt;ref name="1 February 2018 U.N.

In mid-2017, the main rebel faction in the area was [[Jaysh al-Islam]], based in [[Douma, Syria|Douma]] (with an estimated 10-15,000 fighters in the region in early 2018&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/which-rebel-groups-are-fighting-in-syrias-eastern-ghouta/a-42663501 Which rebel groups are fighting in Syria's eastern Ghouta?], Deutsche Welle, 20.02.2018&lt;/ref&gt;). The second largest was [[Faylaq al-Rahman]], an official affiliate of the [[Free Syrian Army]] (FSA), controlling much of central and western parts of Ghouta, including the [[Jobar]] and [[Ain Terma]] districts.

After a series of [[Battle of Harasta (2017–18)|offensive operations]] launched by [[Syrian rebel]]s against positions of the [[Syrian Arab Army]] in [[Harasta]], a northeastern suburb of [[Damascus]], and other locations in Ghouta, the Syrian Arab Army launched an [[Rif Dimashq offensive (February 2018)|operation]] to capture the rebel-held part of Ghouta in February 2018. The escalation of hostilities led to a [[United Nations Security Council]] meeting held on 24 February 2018, voting unanimously in favor of a 30-day cease-fire in Syria, and demanded immediate lifting of the siege of eastern Ghouta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN Security Council agrees 30-day ceasefire in Syria |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/02/1003501|date=24 February 2018|accessdate=25 February 2018|publisher=United Nations News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018 the government offensive continued, being supported by the Russia both diplomatically and militarily.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rferl.org/a/syria-russia-vows-back-assad-vs-terror-threat-ghouta-bloodshed/29067479.html Amid Outcry Over Ghouta, Russia Vows To Back Assad Against 'Terror Threat'] Radio Liberty, 28 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-ghouta/assad-vows-to-press-ghouta-assault-as-civilians-flee-government-advances-idUSKBN1GG09E Assad vows to press Ghouta assault, as civilians flee government advances] Reuters, 4 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 March, the Syrian government took control over several areas and split the enclave into three pockets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-ghouta/syrian-army-splinters-rebel-enclave-in-ghouta-onslaught-idUSKCN1GN095|publisher=Reuters|date=11 March 2018|title=Syrian army splinters rebel enclave in Ghouta onslaught| accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pockets include [[Douma, Syria|Duma]] and its northeastern outskirts, eastern [[Harasta]], and [[Zamalka]] and surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2018/11-march-syrian-arab-army-captures-madraya-town-begins-sweeping|title=Syrian Arab Army captures Madraya town, begins sweeping operations, East Ghouta is   in 2 and almost parts with progress on Harasta front   - Map of Syrian Civil War - Syria news today - syria.liveuamap.com|website=Map of Syrian Civil War - Syria news today - syria.liveuamap.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-late March after a series of negotiations, a deal was finally reached between the Syrian government and rebels that controlled parts of Eastern Ghouta. The deal involved a transfer of remaining rebel fighters from the areas of eastern [[Harasta]], [[Zamalka]] and surrounding areas to the province of Idlib. 105,000 people were displaced by this evacuation from the area.&lt;ref name="France24"/&gt; By the end of March, [[Douma, Syria|Douma]] was the last pocket controlled by the rebels, the Jaish al-Islam fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian army command says it has regained most of eastern Ghouta| publisher=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-ghouta/syrian-army-command-says-it-has-regained-most-of-eastern-ghouta-idUSKBN1H70IX| date=31 March 2018| accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For at least 10 days, there were minimal attacks on the rebel pocket of Douma as talks with the Jaish al-Islam continued. It was reported later that the Jaish al-Islam shelled residential areas in [[Damascus]], causing casualties and material damage. By 6 April, talks had "faltered" between the two sides and the [[Syrian Army|SAA]] renewed their offensive in response to the attack. The [[Jaysh al-Islam|Jaish al-Islam]] denied responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/04/syrian-forces-press-offernsive-rebel-held-douma-180407135235699.html|title=Syrian forces press ahead with offensive in rebel-held Douma|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43674329|title=Syrian warplanes strike rebel enclave|date=2018-04-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebel group had also reportedly refused to release detainees loyal to the Syrian government it was holding in [[Douma, Syria|Douma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/fresh-raids-pound-syria-s-rebel-douma-after-talks-falter-10114666|title=Fresh raids pound Syria's rebel Douma after talks falter|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shelling on 8 April 2018, which left several civilians dead, [[Douma chemical attack|drew allegations of chemical weapons use in Douma]], though the UN could not verify the claim initially.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/04/1006801 | title=Amid allegations of chemical weapons use in Douma, UN chief calls for civilian protection| date=8 April 2018| publisher=UN News| accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
In February 2018, the [[Syrian Network for Human Rights]], a UK-based non-governmental organization, founded in June 2011, published a report alleging that 12,783 civilians were killed in and around Eastern Ghouta from March 2011 to February 2018, including 1,463 children and 1,127 women.&lt;ref name="SNHR"/&gt;

According to local hospital sources, which were cited in the French newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'', approximately 18,000 people were killed in the enclave by October 2017.&lt;ref name="Le Monde"/&gt;

[[Médecins Sans Frontières]] claimed that 70 percent of the enclave's population lived underground by November 2017 to escape bombardments. It also registered that, on average, 71 people were being killed daily since the 18 February 2018 offensive. It registered 1,005 people killed and 4,829 wounded in two weeks alone, between 18 February and 3 March 2018.&lt;ref name="msf_1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msf.org/en/article/syria-outrageous-relentless-mass-casualty-disaster-east-ghouta|title=Syria: An outrageous, relentless mass casualty disaster in East Ghouta|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War crimes allegations==
=== Government and allies ===
Numerous [[war crimes]] allegations were made during the battle, including the use of prohibited weapons, attacks on civilians, attacks against protected objects (schools, hospitals), [[starvation]] as a method of warfare and denial of [[medical evacuation]].&lt;ref name="1 February 2018 U.N.

The report also alleged that Syrian forces "blocked access roads and systematically confiscated food, fuel and medicine at checkpoints". Some inhabitants had to rely on tree leaves as an alternative for vegetables to survive.&lt;ref name="Report 2014"/&gt; The rebels established a web of underground tunnels to smuggle supplies, but they were destroyed by the government forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=With tunnel lifeline cut, pressure mounts on Syrian rebel enclave|date =11 May 2017| publisher=Reuters|url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-ghouta/with-tunnel-lifeline-cut-pressure-mounts-on-syrian-rebel-enclave-idUKKBN1872QK| accessdate=25 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agents included [[chlorine gas]] and [[organophosphorous]] [[pesticide]].&lt;ref name="1 February 2018 U.N.

In one such incident reported on 16 March 2018, at 11:48am, these weapons were dropped on Kafr Batna, killing at least 61 and wounding over 200 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia Backs Syria in Unlawful Attacks on Eastern Ghouta| url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/03/18/russia-backs-syria-unlawful-attacks-eastern-ghouta| publisher=Human Rights Watch| date=18 March 2018| accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, satellite imagery analysis by [[United Nations|UN]] experts concluded that 3,853 buildings were destroyed, 5,141 severely damaged and 3,547 moderately damaged in the western parts of the enclave.

=== Rebel groups ===
The United Nations also found the four largest rebel factions that were active in eastern Ghouta, namely [[Jaysh al-Islam]], the [[Al-Rahman Legion]], [[Ahrar al-Sham]], and [[Tahrir al-Sham]], guilty of crimes against humanity. They were known to arrest and torture members of religious minority groups,&lt;ref name="both crimes"/&gt; and regularly fired [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]]s and rockets from eastern Ghouta at government-held areas. These attacks aimed at spreading terror, and killed many civilians.&lt;ref name="1 February 2018 U.N.

==Reactions==

===United Nations===
{{See also|UN investigation of chemical weapons use in Ghouta}}
2013: After the alleged [[Ghouta chemical attack|chemical weapons attack]] in the Ghouta area of Damascus, the [[United Nations|UN]] sent an inspection team to begin an investigation. The final report concluded that evidence suggests that "surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used in Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zamalka". The Russian government dismissed the initial UN report after it was released, calling it "one-sided" and "distorted".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/19/world/middleeast/syria.html|title=Russia Calls U.N.

2018: After the start of the renewed [[Syrian Army|SAA]] offensive called "[[Rif Dimashq offensive (February 2018–present)|Rif Dimashq offensive]]" during mid-February, the [[United Nations|UN]] proposed a 30-day ceasefire aimed at allowing aid deliveries to enter besieged areas, as well as medical evacuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-43183903|title=UN approves 30-day ceasefire in Syria|date=2018-02-25|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ceasefire was "ignored" as the [[Syrian Army|SAA]] continued its advances into the rebel-controlled areas. It was reported that in the following month, some 25 food trucks were allowed in. Some argued that this was simply not enough for the people living in war-torn areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/limited-food-allowed-enter-syria-besieged-eastern-ghouta-180315094808111.html|title=Limited food allowed to enter Syria's besieged Eastern Ghouta|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of the United States, [[United Kingdom]] and [[France]] accused the Syrian government of a [[2018 Douma chemical attack|chemical attack against the population of Douma]] on April 2018. As a consequence, the three states conducted a series of airstrikes targeting sites associated with Syria's chemical weapons capabilities in Damascus and Homs on 14 April 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/04/1007331| date=14 April 2018| publisher=UN News| title=Following airstrikes, UN chief warns against escalation over Syria}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Russia tried to pass a resolution condemning these US-UK-French airstrikes, but it was not adopted by the U.N.

'''Teatro Farnese''' is a [[Baroque]]-style [[Theater (structure)|theatre]] in the [[Palazzo della Pilotta]], [[Parma]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Paolo| last=Landriani| year=1830| title=''Storia e Descrizione de' Principali Teatri Antichi e Moderni''| editor = Dottore Giulio Ferrario | pages=142–150 | publisher=Tipografia del Dottor Giulio Ferrario, Contrada del Bocchetto N. 2465|id= |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/004309091| authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built in 1618 by [[Giovanni Battista Aleotti]]. The idea of creating this great theater comes from the Duke of Parma and Piacenza [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ranuccio I Farnese]]. The theatre was almost destroyed by an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[strategic bombing|air raid]] during World War II (1944). It was rebuilt and reopened in 1962.

Some claim this as the first permanent [[proscenium]] theatre (that is, a theatre in which the audience views the action through a single frame, which is known as the "proscenium arch").&lt;ref&gt;King, p. 550&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuritz, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thermal runaway''' occurs in situations where an increase in temperature changes the conditions in a way that causes a further increase in temperature, often leading to a destructive result. It is a kind of uncontrolled [[positive feedback]].

In other words, "thermal runaway" describes a process which is accelerated by increased temperature, in turn releasing energy that further increases temperature. In [[chemistry]] (and [[chemical engineering]]), it is associated with strongly [[exothermic]] reactions that are accelerated by temperature rise. In [[electrical engineering]], thermal runaway is typically associated with increased current flow and power dissipation, although exothermic chemical reactions can be of concern here too. Thermal runaway can occur in [[civil engineering]], notably when the heat released by large amounts of [[Concrete#Curing|curing]] [[concrete]] is not controlled.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}  In [[astrophysics]], runaway [[nuclear fusion]] reactions in stars can lead to [[nova]] and several types of [[supernova]] explosions, and also occur as a less dramatic event in the normal evolution of solar mass stars, the "[[helium flash]]".

There are also concerns regarding [[global warming]] that a global average increase of [[4 Degrees and Beyond International Climate Conference|3–4 degrees Celsius]] above the preindustrial baseline could lead to a [[Runaway climate change|further unchecked increase]] in surface temperatures. For example, releases of [[Atmospheric methane|methane]], a [[greenhouse gas]] more potent than [[carbon dioxide#In Earth's atmosphere|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], from [[wetland]]s, melting [[permafrost]] and continental margin seabed [[Methane clathrate|clathrate]] deposits could be subject to [[Clathrate gun hypothesis|positive feedback]].&lt;ref name="ccsp abrupt climate change"&gt;

==Chemical engineering==
Thermal runaway is also called '''thermal explosion''' in [[chemical engineering]], or '''runaway reaction''' in [[organic chemistry]]. It is a process by which an [[exothermic reaction]] goes out of control: the [[reaction rate]] increases due to an increase in temperature, causing a further increase in temperature and hence a further rapid increase in the reaction rate. This has contributed to industrial [[chemical accidents]], most notably the 1947 [[Texas City disaster]] from overheated [[ammonium nitrate]] in a ship's hold, and the 1976 explosion of [[dinitolmide|zoalene]], in a drier, at [[King's Lynn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icheme.org/communities/special-interest-groups/safety%20and%20loss%20prevention/resources/~/media/Documents/Subject%20Groups/Safety_Loss_Prevention/HSE%20Accident%20Reports/The%20Explosion%20at%20Dow%20Kings%20Lynn.pdf|title=The explosion at the Dow chemical factory, King's Lynn 27 June 1976|date=March 1977|publisher=Health &amp; Safety Executive|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank-Kamenetskii theory]] provides a simplified analytical model for thermal explosion. [[Chain reaction|Chain branching]] is an additional positive feedback mechanism which may also cause temperature to skyrocket because of rapidly increasing reaction rate.

Chemical reactions are either endothermic or exothermic, as expressed by their change in enthalpy. Many reactions are highly exothermic, so many industrial-scale and [[oil refinery]] processes have some level of risk of thermal runaway. These include [[hydrocracking#Hydrocracking|hydrocracking]], [[hydrogenation]], [[alkylation]] (S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2), [[oxidation]], [[metalation]] and [[nucleophilic aromatic substitution]]. For example, oxidation of [[cyclohexane]] into [[cyclohexanol]] and [[cyclohexanone]] and [[ortho-xylene]] into [[phthalic anhydride]] have led to catastrophic explosions when reaction control failed.

Thermal runaway may result from unwanted exothermic side reaction(s) that begin at higher temperatures, following an initial accidental overheating of the reaction mixture. This scenario was behind the [[Seveso disaster]], where thermal runaway heated a reaction to temperatures such that in addition to the intended 2,4,5-[[trichlorophenol]], poisonous [[polychlorinated dibenzodioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin]] was also produced, and was vented into the environment after the reactor's [[rupture disk]] burst.&lt;ref name = "Kletz"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kletz | first = Trevor A. | authorlink = Trevor Kletz | title = Learning from Accidents | edition = 3rd | publisher = Gulf Professional | date = 2001 | location = Oxford U.K. | pages = 103–9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zulmgUi5_aEC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=0_0#PPA73,M1 | isbn = 978-0-7506-4883-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal runaway is most often caused by failure of the [[chemical reactor|reactor]] vessel's [[Coolant|cooling]] system. Failure of the mixer can result in localized heating, which initiates thermal runaway. Similarly, in [[flow chemistry|flow reactors]], localized insufficient mixing causes hotspots to form, wherein thermal runaway conditions occur, which causes violent blowouts of reactor contents and catalysts. Incorrect equipment component installation is also a common cause. Many chemical production facilities are designed with high-volume emergency venting, a measure to limit the extent of injury and property damage when such accidents occur.

At large scale, it is unsafe to "charge all reagents and mix", as is done in laboratory scale. This is because the amount of reaction scales with the cube of the size of the vessel (V ∝ r³), but the heat transfer area scales with the square of the size (A ∝ r²), so that the heat production-to-area ratio scales with the size (V/A ∝ r). Consequently, reactions that easily cool fast enough in the laboratory can dangerously self-heat at ton scale. In 2007, this kind of erroneous procedure caused an explosion of a {{convert|2400|gal|liter}}-reactor used to [[Metalation|metalate]] [[methylcyclopentadiene]] with metallic [[sodium]], causing the loss of four lives and parts of the reactor being flung {{convert|400|ft|m}} away.&lt;ref name="Lowe2009"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Derek|authorlink1=Derek Lowe (chemist)|title=175 Times.

Some laboratory reactions must be run under extreme cooling, because they are very prone to hazardous thermal runaway. For example, in [[Swern oxidation]], the formation of  [[sulfonium]] chloride must be performed in a cooled system (–30&amp;nbsp;°C), because at [[room temperature]] the reaction undergoes explosive thermal runaway.&lt;ref name="Lowe2008" /&gt;

The [[UK Chemical Reaction Hazards Forum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crhf.org.uk UK Chemical Reaction Hazards Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; publishes analysis of previously-unreported [[chemical accidents]] to assist the education of the scientific and engineering community, with the aim of preventing similar occurrences elsewhere.  Almost 150 such reports are available to view as of January 2009.

==Microwave heating==
[[Microwave]]s are used for [[microwaving|heating]] of various materials in cooking and various industrial processes. The rate of heating of the material depends on the energy absorption, which depends on the [[dielectric constant]] of the material. The dependence of dielectric constant on temperature varies for different materials; some materials display significant increase with increasing temperature. This behavior, when the material gets exposed to microwaves, leads to selective local overheating, as the warmer areas are better able to accept further energy than the colder areas—potentially dangerous especially for thermal insulators, where the heat exchange between the hot spots and the rest of the material is slow. These materials are called ''thermal runaway materials''. This phenomenon occurs in some [[ceramic materials|ceramics]].

==Electrical engineering==
Some electronic components develop lower resistances or lower triggering voltages (for nonlinear resistances) as their internal temperature increases. If circuit conditions cause markedly increased current flow in these situations, increased power [[dissipation]] may raise the temperature further by [[Joule heating]]. A [[vicious circle]] or [[positive feedback]] effect of thermal runaway can cause failure, sometimes in a spectacular fashion (e.g. electrical explosion or fire). To prevent these hazards, well-designed electronic systems typically incorporate current limiting protection, such as thermal fuses, circuit breakers, or [[temperature coefficient|PTC]] current limiters.

To handle larger currents, circuit designers may connect multiple lower-capacity devices (e.g. transistors, diodes, or [[Metal Oxide varistor|MOVs]]) in [[parallel circuits|parallel]].  This technique can work well, but is susceptible to a phenomenon called '''current hogging''', in which the current is not shared equally across all devices.  Typically, one device may have a slightly lower resistance, and thus draws more current, heating it more than its sibling devices, causing its resistance to drop further.  The electrical load ends up funneling into a single device, which then rapidly fails.  Thus, an array of devices may end up no more robust than its weakest component.

The current-hogging effect can be reduced by carefully matching the characteristics of each paralleled device, or by using other design techniques to balance the electrical load. However, maintaining load balance under extreme conditions may not be straightforward.  Devices with an intrinsic [[positive temperature coefficient]] (PTC) of electrical resistance are less prone to current hogging, but thermal runaway can still occur because of poor heat sinking or other problems.

Many electronic circuits contain special provisions to prevent thermal runaway. This is most often seen in transistor biasing arrangements for high-power output stages. However, when equipment is used above its designed ambient temperature, thermal runaway can still occur in some cases. This occasionally causes equipment failures in hot environments, or when [[air cooling]] vents are blocked.

===Semiconductors===
[[Silicon]] shows a peculiar profile, in that its [[electrical resistance]] increases with temperature up to about 160&amp;nbsp;°C, then starts ''decreasing'', and drops further when the melting point is reached. This can lead to thermal runaway phenomena within internal regions of the [[semiconductor junction]]; the resistance decreases in the regions which become heated above this threshold, allowing more current to flow through the overheated regions, in turn causing yet more heating in comparison with the surrounding regions, which leads to further temperature increase and resistance decrease. This leads to the phenomenon of [[current crowding]] and formation of [[current filament]]s (similar to current hogging, but within a single device), and is one of the underlying causes of many [[Failure modes of electronics|semiconductor junction failures]].

===Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs)===
[[Leakage (semiconductors)|Leakage current]] increases significantly in [[bipolar transistor]]s (especially [[germanium]]-based bipolar transistors) as they increase in temperature. Depending on the design of the circuit, this increase in leakage current can increase the current flowing through a transistor and thus the [[power dissipation]], causing a further increase in collector-to-emitter leakage current. This is frequently seen in a [[push&amp;ndash;pull output|push&amp;ndash;pull]] stage of a [[electronic amplifier#Class AB amplifier|class AB amplifier]]. If the pull-up and pull-down transistors are [[bipolar transistor biasing|biased]] to have minimal [[crossover distortion]] at [[room temperature]], and the biasing is not temperature-compensated, then as the temperature rises both transistors will be increasingly biased on, causing current and power to further increase, and eventually destroying one or both devices.

One rule of thumb to avoid thermal runaway is to keep the [[Biasing|operating point]] of a BJT so that V&lt;sub&gt;ce&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 1/2V&lt;sub&gt;cc&lt;/sub&gt;

Another practice is to mount a thermal feedback sensing transistor or other device on the heat sink, to control the crossover bias voltage. As the output transistors heat up, so does the thermal feedback transistor.  This in turn causes the thermal feedback transistor  to turn on at a slightly lower voltage,  reducing the crossover bias voltage, and so reducing the heat dissipated by the output transistors.

If multiple BJT transistors are connected in parallel (which is typical in high current applications), a current hogging problem can occur.  Special measures must be taken to control this characteristic vulnerability of BJTs.

In power transistors (which effectively consist of many small transistors in parallel), current hogging can occur between different parts of the transistor itself, with one part of the transistor becoming more hot than the others. This is called [[second breakdown]], and can result in destruction of the transistor even when the average junction temperature seems to be at a safe level.

===Power MOSFETs===
Power [[MOSFET]]s typically increase their on-resistance with temperature. Under some circumstances, power dissipated in this resistance causes more heating of the junction, which further increases the [[junction temperature]], in a [[positive feedback]] loop. As a consequence, power MOSFETs have stable and unstable regions of operation.&lt;ref name="powerMOSFETstability"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrara|first1=A.|last2=Steeneken|first2=P. G.|last3=Boksteen|first3=B. K.|last4=Heringa|first4=A.|last5=Scholten|first5=A. J.|last6=Schmitz|first6= J.|last7=Hueting|first7=R. J. E.|title=Physics-based stability analysis of MOS transistors|journal=Solid-State Electronics|volume=113|date=November 2015|pages=28–34|doi=10.1016/j.sse.2015.05.010|bibcode=2015SSEle.113...28F}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the increase of on-resistance with temperature helps balance current across multiple MOSFETs connected in parallel, so current hogging does not occur. If a MOSFET transistor produces more heat than the [[heatsink]] can dissipate, then thermal runaway can still destroy the transistors. This problem can be alleviated to a degree by lowering the [[thermal resistance]] between the transistor die and the heatsink. See also [[Thermal Design Power]].

===Metal oxide varistors (MOVs)===
Metal oxide [[varistor]]s typically develop lower resistance as they heat up.  If connected directly across an AC or DC power bus (a common usage for protection against [[electrical transient]]s), a MOV which has developed a lowered trigger voltage can slide into catastrophic thermal runaway, possibly culminating in a small explosion or fire.&lt;ref name=Brown2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brown|first=Kenneth|title=Metal Oxide Varistor Degradation|journal=IAEI Magazine|date=March 2004|url=http://www.iaei.org/magazine/2004/03/metal-oxide-varistor-degradation/|accessdate=2011-03-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719023317/http://www.iaei.org/magazine/2004/03/metal-oxide-varistor-degradation/|archivedate=2011-07-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   To prevent this possibility, fault current is typically limited by a thermal fuse, circuit breaker, or other current limiting device.

===Tantalum capacitors===
[[Tantalum capacitor]]s are under some conditions prone to self-destruction by thermal runaway. The capacitor typically consists of a [[sintering|sintered]] [[tantalum]] sponge acting as the [[anode]], a [[manganese dioxide]] [[cathode]], and a [[dielectric]] layer of [[tantalum pentoxide]] created on the tantalum sponge surface by [[anodizing]].  It may happen that the tantalum oxide layer has weak spots that undergo [[dielectric breakdown]] during a [[voltage spike]]. The tantalum sponge then comes into direct contact with the manganese dioxide, and increased leakage current causes localized heating; usually, this drives an [[endothermic]] chemical reaction that produces [[manganese(III) oxide]] and regenerates ([[self-healing material|self-heals]]) the tantalum oxide dielectric layer.

However, if the energy dissipated at the failure point is high enough, a self-sustaining [[exothermic]] reaction can start, similar to the [[thermite]] reaction, with metallic tantalum as fuel and manganese dioxide as oxidizer.  This undesirable reaction will destroy the capacitor, producing [[smoke]] and possibly [[flame]].&lt;ref name= "Vasina2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Vasina|first1= P.|last2= Zednicek|first2= T.|last3= Sikula|first3= J.|last4= Pavelka|first4= J.|title= Failure modes of tantalum capacitors made by different technologies|journal= Microelectronics Reliability|volume= 42|issue= 6|year= 2002|pages= 849–854|doi= 10.1016/S0026-2714(02)00034-3|url= http://avx.com/docs/techinfo/failure.pdf|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100923075150/http://avx.com/docs/techinfo/failure.pdf|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2010-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, tantalum capacitors can be freely deployed in small-signal circuits, but application in high-power circuits must be carefully designed to avoid thermal runaway failures.

===Digital logic===
The [[Leakage (semiconductors)|leakage current]] of logic switching transistors increases with temperature. In rare instances, this may lead to thermal runaway in digital circuits. This is not a common problem, since leakage currents usually make up a small portion of overall power consumption, so the increase in power is fairly modest — for an [[Athlon 64]], the power dissipation increases by about 10% for every 30 degrees Celsius.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lostcircuits.com/cpu/amd_venice/ LostCircuits, CPU Guide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For a device with a [[Thermal Design Power|TDP]] of 100 W, for thermal runaway to occur, the heat sink would have to have a [[Thermal conductivity#Related terms|thermal resistivity]] of over 3 K/W (kelvins per watt), which is about 6 times worse than a stock Athlon 64 heat sink. (A stock Athlon 64 heat sink is rated at 0.34 K/W, although the actual thermal resistance to the environment is somewhat higher, due to the thermal boundary between processor and heatsink, rising temperatures in the case, and other thermal resistances.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}) Regardless, an inadequate heat sink with a thermal resistance of over 0.5 to 1 K/W would result in the destruction of a 100 W device even without thermal runaway effects.

===Batteries===
When handled improperly,  or if manufactured defectively, some [[rechargeable batteries]] can experience thermal runaway resulting in overheating. Sealed cells will sometimes explode violently if safety vents are overwhelmed or nonfunctional.&lt;ref name= "Finegan:2015"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ncomms7924| title = In-operando high-speed tomography of lithium-ion batteries during thermal runaway| journal = Nature Communications| volume = 6| pages = 6924| year = 2015| last1 = Finegan | first1 = D.

This action was partially inspired by a cargo bay fire on a [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] [[airplane]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/fulltext/hzb0501.htm PHMSA article on the UPS airplane fire]&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the possible solutions is in using safer and less reactive anode (lithium titanates) and cathode ([[lithium iron phosphate]]) materials — thereby avoiding the [[Cobalt#Batteries|cobalt]] electrodes in many lithium rechargeable cells — together with non-flammable electrolytes based on ionic liquids.

==Astrophysics==
Runaway thermonuclear reactions can occur in stars when [[nuclear fusion]] is ignited in conditions under which the pressure exerted by overlying layers of the star greatly exceeds [[Kinetic theory of gases|thermal pressure]], a situation that makes possible rapid increases in temperature. Such a scenario may arise in stars containing [[degenerate matter]], in which [[electron degeneracy pressure]] rather than normal thermal pressure does most of the work of supporting the star against gravity, and in stars undergoing implosion. In all cases, the imbalance arises prior to fusion ignition; otherwise, the fusion reactions would be naturally regulated to counteract temperature changes and stabilize the star. When thermal pressure is in equilibrium with overlying pressure, a star will respond to the increase in temperature and thermal pressure due to initiation of a new exothermic reaction by expanding and cooling. A runaway reaction is only possible when this response is inhibited.

===Helium flashes in red giant stars===
When stars in the 0.8–2.0 [[solar mass]] range exhaust the hydrogen in their cores and become [[red giant]]s, the helium accumulating in their cores reaches degeneracy before it ignites. When the degenerate core reaches a critical mass of about 0.45 solar masses, [[helium fusion]] is ignited and takes off in a runaway fashion, called the [[helium flash]], briefly increasing the star's energy production to a rate 100 billion times normal. About 6% of the core is quickly converted into carbon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.wcas.northwestern.edu/~infocom/The%20Website/end.html The End Of The Sun]&lt;/ref&gt; While the release is sufficient to convert the core back into normal [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] after a few seconds, it does not disrupt the star,&lt;ref&gt;[https://astro.uni-bonn.de/~nlanger/siu_web/ssescript/new/chapter9.pdf Chapter 9: Post-main sequence evolution through helium burning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DearbornLattanzio2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dearborn|first1=D.

The star then contracts, leaving the red giant phase and continuing its evolution into a [[Stellar evolution#Mid-sized stars|stable helium-burning phase]].

===Novae===
A [[nova]] results from runaway [[nuclear fusion#Astrophysical reaction chains|hydrogen fusion]] (via the [[CNO cycle#Hot CNO cycles|CNO cycle]]) in the outer layer of a carbon-oxygen [[white dwarf]] star. If a white dwarf has a companion star from which it can [[Accretion disc|accrete gas]], the material will accumulate in a surface layer made degenerate by the dwarf's intense gravity. Under the right conditions, a sufficiently thick layer of hydrogen is eventually heated to a temperature of 20 million K, igniting runaway fusion. The surface layer is blasted off the white dwarf, increasing luminosity by a factor on the order of 50,000. The white dwarf and companion remain intact, however, so the process can repeat.&lt;ref name = "Fermi_2010"&gt;{{cite web

===X-ray bursts===
Analogous to the process leading to novae, degenerate matter can also accumulate on the surface of a [[neutron star]] that is accreting gas from a close companion. If a sufficiently thick layer of hydrogen accumulates, ignition of runaway hydrogen fusion can then lead to an [[X-ray burster|X-ray burst]]. As with novae, such bursts tend to repeat and may also be triggered by helium or even carbon fusion.&lt;ref name = "Cumming"&gt;{{cite journal

===Type Ia supernovae===
A [[type Ia supernova]] results from [[Carbon detonation|runaway carbon fusion]] in the core of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf star. If a white dwarf, which is composed almost entirely of degenerate matter, can gain mass from a companion, the increasing temperature and density of material in its core will ignite [[Carbon-burning process|carbon fusion]] if the star's mass approaches the [[Chandrasekhar limit]]. This leads to an explosion that completely disrupts the star. Luminosity increases by a factor of greater than 5 billion. One way to gain the additional mass would be by [[Type Ia supernova#Single degenerate progenitors|accreting gas]] from a [[giant star]] (or even [[main sequence]]) companion.&lt;ref name="DildayHowell2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dilday|first1=B.|last2=Howell|first2=D.

===Pair-instability supernovae===
A [[pair-instability supernova]] is believed to result from runaway [[Oxygen-burning process|oxygen fusion]] in the core of a [[Hypergiant|massive]], 130–250 solar mass, low to moderate [[metallicity]] star.&lt;ref name="Gal-YamMazzali2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gal-Yam|first1=A.|last2= Mazzali|first2= P.|last3=Ofek|first3=E.

As the core heats further, the gamma rays eventually begin to pass the energy threshold needed for collision-induced decay into [[electron]]-[[positron]] pairs, a process called [[pair production]]. This causes a drop in the pressure within the core, leading it to contract and heat further, causing more pair production, a further pressure drop, and so on. The core starts to undergo [[gravitational collapse]]. At some point this ignites runaway oxygen fusion, releasing enough energy to obliterate the star. These explosions are rare, perhaps about one per 100,000 supernovae.

===Comparison to nonrunaway supernovae===
Not all supernovae are triggered by runaway nuclear fusion. [[Type Ib and Ic supernovae|Type Ib, Ic]] and [[type II supernova]]e also undergo core collapse, but because they have exhausted their supply of atomic nuclei capable of undergoing exothermic fusion reactions, they collapse all the way into [[neutron star]]s, or in the higher-mass cases, [[stellar black hole]]s, powering explosions by the release of [[gravitational potential energy]] (largely via release of [[neutrino]]s). It is the absence of runaway fusion reactions that allows such supernovae to leave behind [[Compact star|compact stellar remnants]].

The '''True Cross''' is the name for physical remnants which, by a [[Christian Church]] tradition, are said to be from the [[Christian cross|cross]] upon which [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus was crucified]].&lt;ref&gt;Sources for the legend of Helena and the invention of the True Cross are explored in detail in J. W. Drijvers, ''Helena Augusta, the Mother of Constantine the Great and the Legend of her Finding of the True Cross'' (Leiden, 1992).&lt;br&gt;See also: {{cite book |title= The Elene of [[Cynewulf]] |others= Translated into English prose by Lucius Hudson Holt |series= Yale Studies in English |volume= Volume XXI (1904)}} [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14781 In Project Gutenberg.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to post-[[First seven Ecumenical Councils|Nicene]] historians such as [[Socrates of Constantinople]], the Empress [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], mother of [[Emperor Constantine]], the first [[Constantine I and Christianity|Christian]] [[Emperor of Rome]], travelled to the [[Holy Land]] in 326–328, founding churches and establishing relief agencies for the poor. Historians [[Gelasius of Caesarea]] and [[Tyrannius Rufinus|Rufinus]] claimed that she discovered the hiding place of three crosses that were believed to have been used at the crucifixion of Jesus and of two thieves, [[Penitent thief|St. Dismas]] and [[Impenitent thief|Gestas]], executed with him; to one cross was affixed the [[Titulus Crucis|titulus]] bearing Jesus' name, but Helena was not sure until a [[miracle]] revealed that that cross was the True Cross.

Many churches possess fragmentary remains that are by tradition alleged to be those of the True Cross. Their authenticity is not accepted by all Christians, mainly Protestants; however the bulk of Roman Catholic and Orthodox believers recognize them as genuine pieces of the cross of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Drijvers 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance and belief of that part{{which?|Helena finding the crosses, or suthenticity of fragments?|date=November 2018}} of the tradition that pertains to the [[Early Christianity|early Christian Church]] is generally restricted to the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], [[Oriental Orthodox Church]], and the [[Church of the East]]. The medieval legends that developed concerning the provenance of the True Cross differ between Catholic and Orthodox tradition.

==Provenance==

[[File:Piero della Francesca 011.jpg|thumb|The [[Queen of Sheba]] venerates the wood from which the Cross will be made ([[fresco]] by [[Piero della Francesca]] in [[San Francesco, Arezzo]]).]]

===''The Golden Legend''===
In the Latin-speaking traditions of Western Europe, the story of the pre-Christian origins of the True Cross was well established by the 13th century when, in 1260, it was recorded by [[Jacopo de Voragine]], [[Bishop of Genoa]], in the ''[[Golden Legend]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The word "legend" did not imply "myth". The word, from the [[Latin language|Latin]], meant "script that is to be read". Thus the indisputably historic lives of early leaders of the Church, such as [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory]], [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] were referred to as their "legends".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tree of Mercy====
''The Golden Legend'' contains several versions of the origin of the True Cross. In ''The Life of Adam'', Voragine writes that the True Cross came from three trees which grew from three seeds from the "Tree of Mercy" which [[Seth]] collected and planted in the mouth of [[Adam]]'s corpse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/voragine/goldleg1.iii.i_2.html Voragine, ''The Golden Legend: The Life of Adam'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tree of Knowledge====
In another account contained in ''Of the invention of the Holy Cross, and first of this word invention'', Voragine writes that the True Cross came from a tree that grew from part of the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil]], or "the tree that Adam ate of", that Seth planted on Adam's grave where it "endured there unto the time of Solomon".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/voragine/goldleg3.xxxiv.html Voragine, ''The Golden Legend: Invention of the True Cross'']&lt;/ref&gt;

====Queen of Sheba====
After many centuries, the tree was cut down and the wood used to build a bridge over which the [[Queen of Sheba]] passed, on her journey to meet [[King Solomon]]. So struck was she by the [[omen|portent]] contained in the timber of the bridge that she fell on her knees and revered it. On her visit to Solomon, she told him that a piece of wood from the bridge would bring about the replacement of [[Mosaic covenant|God's covenant]] with the Jewish people by a new order. Solomon, fearing the eventual destruction of his people, had the timber buried.&lt;ref name="JV"&gt;[[Jacopo de Voragine]], ''The Golden Legend'', late 13th century.[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/voragine/goldleg3.xxxiv.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====True Cross====
After fourteen generations, the wood taken from the bridge was fashioned into the Cross used to [[Crucifixion|crucify]] Christ.&lt;ref name="JV"/&gt;

====Helena====
Voragine then goes on to describe its finding by Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine.&lt;ref name="JV"/&gt;

====Acceptance of this tradition====
In the late [[Middle Ages]] and [[Early Renaissance]], there was a wide general acceptance of the origin of the True Cross and its history preceding the crucifixion of Jesus, as recorded by Voragine. This general acceptance is confirmed by the numerous artworks that depict this subject, culminating in one of the most famous fresco cycles of the Renaissance, the ''[[Legend of the True Cross]]'' by [[Piero della Francesca]], painted on the walls of the chancel of the Church of [[San Francesco, Arezzo|San Francesco]] in Arezzo between 1452 and 1466, in which he reproduces faithfully the traditional episodes of the story as recorded in ''The Golden Legend''.

===Eastern Christianity===
''The Golden Legend'' and many of its sources developed after the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and thus is unknown in the Greek- or Syriac-speaking worlds. The above pre-crucifixion history, therefore, is not to be found in [[Eastern Christianity]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

According to the [[Sacred Tradition|sacred tradition]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] the True Cross was made from three different types of wood: [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[pine]] and [[cypress]].&lt;ref name = "Roman"&gt;Dr. Alexander Roman, "[http://www.ukrainian-orthodoxy.org/articles/2005/elevation.htm Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross]", ''Ukrainian Orthodoxy'' Accessed on 2012-10-27&lt;/ref&gt; This is an allusion to {{Bibleverse||Isaiah|60:13|HE}}: "The glory of [[Lebanon]] shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the pine tree, and the box [cypress] together to beautify the place of my sanctuary, and I will make the place of my feet glorious." The link between this verse and the Crucifixion lies in the words, "the place of my feet", which is interpreted as referring to the ''suppedāneum'' (foot rest) on which Jesus' feet were nailed (see [[Orthodox cross]]).{{cn|date=November 2018}} (Compare with the Jewish concept of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], or indeed the [[Jerusalem Temple]], as being the resting place for God's foot-stool,&lt;ref name="TDNT"&gt;Gerhard Kittel and Gerhard Friedrich (editors), Theological Dictionary of the New Testament, volume VI, p. 627. Eerdmans (1969), {{ISBN|9780802822482}}, URL https://books.google.com/books?id=eEITN4tLxtoC&amp;pg=PA627&lt;/ref&gt; and the prescribed [[Three Pilgrimage Festivals]], in Hebrew ''aliya la-regel'', lit. ''ascending to the foot'').&lt;ref&gt;{cite web |publisher= Science 2.0 |url= https://www.science20.com/news_releases/enormous_footshaped_enclosure_discovered_jordan_valley |title= Enormous 'foot-shaped' enclosure discovered  in Jordan Valley |date= 6 April 2009 |access-date= 19 November 2018}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tradition that the three trees from which the True Cross was constructed grew together in one spot. A traditional Orthodox [[icon]] depicts [[Lot (Bible)|Lot]], the nephew of [[Abraham]], watering the trees.&lt;ref name = "Roman"/&gt; According to tradition, these trees were used to construct the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] ("to beautify the place of my sanctuary"). Later, during [[Herod the Great|Herod's]] [[Temple of Herod|reconstruction of the Temple]], the wood from these trees was removed from the Temple and discarded, eventually being used to construct the cross on which Jesus was crucified ("and I will make the place of my feet glorious").{{cn|date=November 2018}}{{dubious|Wood NOT used for Temple, since it originated in sin - Lot sleeping with his daughters.|date=November 2018}}

==Finding the True Cross==

[[File:Agnolo Gaddi True Cross Detail 1380.jpg|left|thumb|''The Finding of the True Cross'', [[Agnolo Gaddi]], Florence, 1380]]
According to the 1955 Roman Catholic Marian Missal, Helena went to Jerusalem to search for the True Cross and found it September 14, 320. In the eighth century, the feast of the Finding was transferred to May 3, and September 14th became the celebration of the "[[Exaltation of the Cross]]", the commemoration of a victory over the Persians by [[Heraclius]], as a result of which the relic was returned to Jerusalem.

===According to Eusebius===
[[Eusebius of Caesarea]], in his ''Life of Constantine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-29.htm#P7646_3165242|title=NPNF2-01. Eusebius Pamphilius: Church History, Life of Constantine, Oration in Praise of Constantine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes how the site of the [[Holy Sepulchre]], once a site of veneration for the Christian church in [[Jerusalem]], had been covered with earth and a [[temple]] of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] had been built on top.  Although Eusebius does not say as much, this would probably have been done as part of [[Hadrian]]'s reconstruction of Jerusalem as [[Aelia Capitolina]] in 135, following the destruction during the [[First Jewish–Roman War|Jewish Revolt]] of 70 and [[Bar Kokhba's revolt]] of 132–135.  Following his conversion to Christianity, Emperor [[Constantine I of the Roman Empire|Constantine]] ordered in about 325–326 that the site be uncovered and instructed Saint [[Macarius of Jerusalem|Macarius]], Bishop of Jerusalem, to build a church on the site.  In his ''Life of Constantine'', [[Eusebius]] does not mention the finding of the True Cross.

===According to Socrates Scholasticus===
[[Socrates of Constantinople|Socrates Scholasticus]] (born c. 380), in his ''Ecclesiastical History,'' gives a full description of the discovery&lt;ref name="socrates"&gt;{{cite web| title=Chapter XVII—The Emperor’s Mother Helena having come to Jerusalem, searches for and finds the Cross of Christ, and builds a Church| url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf202.ii.iv.xvii.html| series=Christian Classics Ethereal Library| work=Socrates and Sozomenus Ecclesiastical Histories of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers of the Christian Church| author=Socrates and Sozomenus; Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D. and Henry Wace, D.D., ed.| publisher=Wm. B Eerdmans| location=Grand Rapids, MI| year=1984| isbn=0-8028-8116-5| accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was repeated later by [[Sozomen]] and by [[Theodoret]]. In it he describes how Saint [[Helena, mother of Constantine the Great|Helena]], Constantine's aged mother, had the pagan temple destroyed and the Sepulchre uncovered, whereupon three crosses, the [[Titulus Crucis|titulus, and the nails from Jesus's crucifixion]] were uncovered as well&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR8odNAP_f3YL4qk4q2NWOecXWIVHJJ8SOZkcW_ZnGtGpKgYhreSepSnH8cPNMiMhkg94tYDCb2Tylq/pub/&lt;/ref&gt;.  In Socrates's version of the story, Macarius had the three crosses placed in turn on a deathly ill woman.  This woman recovered at the touch of the third cross, which was taken as a sign that this was the cross of Christ, the new Christian symbol.  Socrates also reports that, having also found the [[Holy Nails]] (the nails with which Christ had been fastened to the cross), Helena sent these to [[Constantinople]], where they were incorporated into the emperor's helmet and the bridle of his horse.

===According to Sozomen===
[[Sozomen]] (died c. 450), in his [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-02/Npnf2-02-20.htm#P3156_1288060 ''Ecclesiastical History''], gives essentially the same version as Socrates.  He also adds that it was said (by whom he does not say) that the location of the Sepulchre was "disclosed by a Hebrew who dwelt in the East, and who derived his information from some documents which had come to him by paternal inheritance" (although Sozomen himself disputes this account) and that a dead person was also revived by the touch of the Cross.  Later popular versions of this story state that the Jew who assisted Helena was named Jude or Judas, but later converted to Christianity and took the name [[Judas Kyriakos|Kyriakos]].

===According to Theodoret===
[[File:Tres Riches Heures Jean de Colombe true Cross.jpg|thumb|The proving of the True Cross, Jean Colombe in the [[Très Riches Heures]]]]

[[Theodoret]] (died c. 457) in his ''Ecclesiastical History'' Chapter xvii gives what had become the standard version of the finding of the True Cross:
{{quote|When the empress beheld the place where the Saviour suffered, she immediately ordered the idolatrous temple, which had been there erected, to be destroyed, and the very earth on which it stood to be removed. When the tomb, which had been so long concealed, was discovered, three crosses were seen buried near the Lord's sepulchre. All held it as certain that one of these crosses was that of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that the other two were those of the thieves who were crucified with Him. Yet they could not discern to which of the three the Body of the Lord had been brought nigh, and which had received the outpouring of His precious Blood. But the wise and holy Macarius, the president of the city, resolved this question in the following manner. He caused a lady of rank, who had been long suffering from disease, to be touched by each of the crosses, with earnest prayer, and thus discerned the virtue residing in that of the Saviour. For the instant this cross was brought near the lady, it expelled the sore disease, and made her whole.}}

With the Cross were also found the [[Holy Nails]], which Helena took with her back to Constantinople. According to Theodoret, "She had part of the cross of our Saviour conveyed to the palace. The rest was enclosed in a covering of silver, and committed to the care of the bishop of the city, whom she exhorted to preserve it carefully, in order that it might be transmitted uninjured to posterity."

===Syriac tradition===
Another popular ancient version from the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] tradition replaced Helena with a fictitious first-century empress named Protonike.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==The relics of the Cross in Jerusalem==

===After Empress Helena===

The silver reliquary that was left at the [[Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre]] in care of the bishop of Jerusalem was exhibited periodically to the faithful. In the 380s a nun named [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]] who was travelling on [[pilgrimage]] described the veneration of the True Cross at Jerusalem in a long letter, the ''Itinerario Egeriae'' that she sent back to her community of women:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then a chair is placed for the bishop in [[Golgotha]] behind the [liturgical] Cross, which is now standing; the bishop duly takes his seat in the chair, and a table covered with a linen cloth is placed before him; the deacons stand round the table, and a silver-gilt casket is brought in which is the holy wood of the Cross.  The casket is opened and [the wood] is taken out, and both the wood of the Cross and the [[INRI|title]] are placed upon the table.  Now, when it has been put upon the table, the bishop, as he sits, holds the extremities of the sacred wood firmly in his hands, while the deacons who stand around guard it.  It is guarded thus because the custom is that the people, both faithful and catechumens, come one by one and, bowing down at the table, kiss the sacred wood and pass through.  And because, I know not when, some one is said to have bitten off and stolen a portion of the sacred wood, it is thus guarded by the deacons who stand around, lest any one approaching should venture to do so again.  And as all the people pass by one by one, all bowing themselves, they touch the Cross and the title, first with their foreheads and then with their eyes; then they kiss the Cross and pass through, but none lays his hand upon it to touch it.  When they have kissed the Cross and have passed through, a deacon stands holding the ring of Solomon and the horn from which the kings were anointed; they kiss the horn also and gaze at the ring...&lt;ref&gt;M.L. McClure and C. L. Feltoe, ed. and trans.''The Pilgrimage of Etheria'', Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, London,(1919)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Before long, but perhaps not until after the visit of Egeria, it was possible also to venerate the [[crown of thorns]], the pillar at which Christ was scourged, and the [[Holy Lance|lance]] that pierced his side.

===During Persian-Byzantine war (614-630)===

In 614 the [[Sassanid dynasty|Sassanid]] [[Shahanshah|Emperor]] [[Khosrau II]] ("Chosroes") removed the part of the cross held in Jerusalem as a trophy, after he [[Siege of Jerusalem (614)|captured the city]]. Thirteen years later, in 628, the [[Byzantine]] [[Basileus|Emperor]] [[Heraclius]] defeated Khosrau and regained the relic from [[Shahrbaraz]]. He placed the cross in Constantinople at first, and took it back to Jerusalem on 21 March 630.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In his analysis, the hoax was designed to serve the political purposes of both Heraclius and his former foe, recently turned ally and co-father-in-law, Persian general and soon-to-become king, Shahrbaraz.&lt;ref name="Zuckerman"&gt;{{cite book |title=Heraclius and the return of the Holy Cross |work=Constructing the Seventh Century |series=Travaux et mémoires (17) |author=Constantin Zuckerman |year=2013 |location=Paris |publisher=Association des amis du Centre d'histoire et civilisation de Byzance |pages=197–218 |isbn=978-2-916716-45-9 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10124428/Heraclius_and_the_return_of_the_Holy_Cross |accessdate=8 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatimids, crusaders and loss of the Cross===

Around 1009, the year in which [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid caliph]] [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] ordered the destruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], Christians in Jerusalem hid part of the cross and it remained hidden until the city was taken by the European soldiers of the [[First Crusade]]. [[Arnulf Malecorne]], the first [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], had the Greek Orthodox priests who were in possession of the Cross tortured in order to reveal its position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

It was housed in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] under the protection of the Latin Patriarch, who marched with it ahead of the army before every battle.

[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (181).JPG|thumb|right|A ''"Kreuzpartikel"'' or fragment of ''True Cross'' in the [[Schatzkammer (Vienna)]]]]
An inscription of 359, found at Tixter, in the neighbourhood of Sétif in [[Mauretania]], was said to mention, in an enumeration of relics, a fragment of the True Cross, according to an entry in ''Roman Miscellanies'', X, 441.

Fragments of the Cross were broken up, and the pieces were widely distributed; in 348, in one of his ''Catecheses'', Cyril of Jerusalem remarked that the "whole earth is full of the relics of the Cross of Christ,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-07/Npnf2-07-09.htm#P517_109153|title=NPNF2-07.

Cyril of Jerusalem, Gregory Nazianzen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egeria's account testifies to how highly these relics of the crucifixion were prized.  Saint [[John Chrysostom]] relates that fragments of the True Cross were kept in golden reliquaries, "which men reverently wear upon their persons." Even two Latin inscriptions around 350 from today's Algeria testify to the keeping and admiration of small particles of the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Duval, Yvette, Loca sanctorum Africae, Rome 1982, p.331-337 and 351-353&lt;/ref&gt; Around the year 455, [[Juvenal of Jerusalem|Juvenal]] [[Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]] sent to [[Pope Leo I]] a fragment of the "precious wood", according to the ''Letters'' of Pope Leo. A portion of the cross was taken to Rome in the seventh century by [[Pope Sergius I]], who was of Byzantine origin. "''In the small part is power of the whole cross''", so an [[inscription]] in the Felix [[Basilica]] of [[Nola]], built by bishop Paulinus at the beginning of 5th century. The cross particle was inserted in the altar.&lt;ref&gt;Ziehr, Wilhelm, Das Kreuz, Stuttgart 1997, page 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old English language|Old English]] [[poem]] ''[[Dream of the Rood]]'' mentions the finding of the cross and the beginning of the tradition of the veneration of its relics. The ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' also talks of King Alfred receiving a fragment of the cross from Pope Marinus (see: Annal Alfred the Great, year 883).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/angsax-chron1.html Medieval Sourcebook: The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle on Alfred the Great]&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is possible, the poem need not be referring to this specific relic or have this incident as the reason for its composition. However, there is a later source that speaks of a bequest made to the 'Holy Cross' at [[Shaftesbury Abbey]] in Dorset; Shaftesbury abbey was founded by King Alfred, supported with a large portion of state funds and given to the charge of his own daughter when he was alive - it is conceivable that if Alfred really received this relic, that he may have given it to the care of the nuns at Shaftesbury&lt;ref&gt;Studies in the Early History of Shaftesbury Abbey. Dorset County Council, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the very small relics of the True Cross in Europe came from [[Constantinople]]. The city was captured and sacked by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204: "After the conquest of the city Constantinople inestimable wealth was found, incomparably precious jewels and also a part of the cross of the Lord, which Helena transferred from Jerusalem and was decorated with gold and precious jewels. There it attained highest admiration. It was carved up by the present bishops and was divided with other very precious relics among the knights; later, after their return to the homeland, it was donated to churches and monasteries."&lt;ref&gt;Original: Capta igitur urbe, divitiae repperiuntur inestimabiles, lapides preciosissime et incomparabiles, pars etiam ligni dominici, quod per Helenam de Iherosolimis translatum, auro et gemmis precioses insignitum in maxima illic veneratione habebatur, ab episcopis qui presentes aderant incisum, ab aliis preciosissimis reliquis per nobilis quosque partitur, et postea eis revertentibus ad natale solum, per ecclesias et cenobia distrbuitur. - German: Nach der Eroberung der Stadt wurden unschätzbare Reichtümer gefunden, unvergleichlich kostbare Edelsteine und auch ein Teil des Kreuzes des Herrn, das, von Helena aus Jerusalem überführt und mit Gold und kostbaren Edelsteinen geschmückt, dort höchste Verehrung erfuhr. Es wurde von den anwesenden Bischöfen zerstückelt und mit anderen sehr kostbaren Reliquien unter die Ritter aufgeteilt; später, nach deren Rückkehr in die Heimat, wurde es Kirchen und Klöstern gestiftet.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chronica regia Coloniensis]] (sub annorum 1238 - 1240), page 203.

A knight [[Robert de Clari]] wrote: "Within this chapel were found many precious relics; for therein were found two pieces of the True Cross, as thick as a man's leg and a [[fathom]] in length."&lt;ref&gt;Robert of Clari's account of the Fourth Crusade, chapter 82: OF THE MARVELS OF CONSTANTINOPLE [http://www.deremilitari.org/RESOURCES/SOURCES/clari.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the Middle Ages so many [[Church (building)|churches]] claimed to possess a piece of the True Cross, that [[John Calvin]]  is famously said to have remarked that there was enough wood in them to fill a ship:

{{quote|There is no abbey so poor as not to have a specimen. In some places there are large fragments, as at the Holy Chapel in Paris, at Poitiers, and at Rome, where a good-sized crucifix is said to have been made of it. In brief, if all the pieces that could be found were collected together, they would make a big ship-load. Yet the Gospel testifies that a single man was able to carry it.|author=Calvin| source=''Traité Des Reliques''}}

Conflicting with this is the finding of [[Charles Rohault de Fleury]], who, in his ''Mémoire sur les instruments de la Passion'' of 1870 made a study of the relics in reference to the criticisms of Calvin and [[Erasmus]].  He drew up a catalogue of all known relics of the True Cross showing that, in spite of what various authors have claimed, the fragments of the Cross brought together again would not reach one-third that of a cross which has been supposed to have been {{convert|3|or|4|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} in height, with transverse branch of {{convert|2|m|ft|spell=in|abbr=off}} wide, proportions not at all abnormal. He calculated: supposing the Cross to have been of pine-wood (based on his microscopic analysis of the fragments) and giving it a weight of about seventy-five kilogrammes, we find the original volume of the cross to be {{convert|0.178|m3|3|abbr=off}}. The total known volume of known relics of the True Cross, according to his catalogue, amounts to approximately {{convert|0.004|m3|3|abbr=off}} (more specifically 3,942,000 cubic millimetres), leaving a volume of {{convert|0.174|m3|3|abbr=on}} lost, destroyed, or otherwise unaccounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04529a.htm|title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: The True Cross|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four cross particles – of ten particles with surviving documentary provenances by Byzantine emperors – from European churches, i.e. [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme|Santa Croce]] in Rome, [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], Paris, [[Duomo di Pisa|Pisa Cathedral]] and [[Santa Maria del Fiore|Florence Cathedral]], were microscopically examined. "The pieces came all together from olive."&lt;ref&gt;(William Ziehr, ''Das Kreuz'', Stuttgart 1997, p. 63) [[:de:Diskussion:Kreuzerhöhung]], in German. &lt;!--attention: copyright by Michael Hesemann--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  It is possible that many alleged pieces of the True Cross are [[forgery|forgeries]], created by travelling merchants in the Middle Ages, during which period a thriving trade in manufactured relics existed.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Gerasimos Smyrnakis&lt;ref&gt;Gerasimos Smyrnakis, Το Αγιον Ορος (''The Holy Mountain''), Athens, 1903 (reprinted 1998), p. 378-379&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the largest surviving portion, of 870,760 cubic millimetres, is preserved in the Monastery of [[Koutloumousiou]] on [[Mount Athos]], and also mentions the preserved relics in [[Rome]] (consisting of 537,587 cubic millimetres), in [[Brussels]] (516,090 cubic millimetres), in [[Venice]] (445,582 cubic millimetres), in [[Ghent]] (436,450 cubic millimetres) and in [[Paris]] (237,731 cubic millimetres). (For comparison, the collective volume of the largest of these sets of fragments would be equivalent to a cube of a little less than 4 inches per side, while the smallest of these would have an equivalent cubic dimension of about 2.5 inches per side. The volume figures given by Smyrnakis for these objects—six significant figures and to the cubic millimeter—are undoubtedly the result of multiplying slightly approximate numbers and should not be seen as implying scientific accuracy of the highest order in a book written over a century ago.)
[[File:Visoki Decani 08.JPG|thumb|Fragments of True Cross in Serbian Monastery of [[Visoki Dečani]]]]

[[Santo Toribio de Liébana]] in Spain is also said to hold the largest of these pieces and is one of the most visited Roman Catholic [[pilgrimage]] sites. Other portions of the True Cross are in the [[Monasterio de Tarlac]] at [[San Jose, Tarlac]], [[Philippines]] and at the National Shrine of Padre Pio of Pietrelcina in San Pedro, [[Santo Tomas, Batangas]], [[Philippines]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monasterio-de-tarlac.weebly.com/index.html|title=Monasterio de Tarlac|work=Monasterio de Tarlac}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Redemptorist Center in [[Pattaya]], [[Thailand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redemptorists.or.th/en/|title=Mahatai Convention Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church]] also claims to have the right wing of the true cross buried in the monastery of Gishen Mariam. The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church has an annual religious holiday, called Meskel or Demera, commemorating the discovery of the True Cross by Queen Helena. Meskel occurs on 17 Meskerem in the Ethiopian calendar (September 27, Gregorian calendar, or September 28 in leap years). "Meskel" (or "Meskal" or "Mesqel", there are various ways to transliterate from Ge'ez to Latin script) is Ge'ez for "cross".&lt;ref&gt;[[Meskel]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is known as Feast of the exaltation of the holy cross in other Orthodox, Catholic or Protestant churches. The churches that follow the Gregorian calendar celebrate the feast on September 14.

==Veneration==
Saint [[John Chrysostom]] wrote homilies on the three crosses:

{{quote|Kings removing their diadems take up the cross, the symbol of their Saviour's death; on the purple, the cross; in their prayers, the cross; on their armour, the cross; on the holy table, the cross; throughout the universe, the cross. The cross shines brighter than the sun.}}

[[File:Accademia - Procession in piazza San Marco by Gentile Bellini.jpg|thumb|450px|A relic of the True Cross being carried in procession through the Piazza San Marco, Venice. [[Gentile Bellini]] 15th century.]]

The [[Roman Catholic Church]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], the [[Anglican Communion]], and a number of [[Protestant]] denominations, celebrate the [[Feast of the Cross|Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross]] on September 14, the anniversary of the dedication of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].  In later centuries, these celebrations also included commemoration of the rescue of the True Cross from the [[Persia]]ns in 628. In the [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galician]] usage, beginning about the seventh century, the Feast of the Cross was celebrated on May 3. According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', when the Galician and Roman practices were combined, the September date, for which the Vatican adopted the official name "Triumph of the Cross" in 1963, was used to commemorate the rescue from the Persians and the May date was kept as the "Invention of the True Cross" to commemorate the finding.&lt;ref&gt;The term "Invention" is from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''invenire'', "to find" (lit. "to come across"), and should not be understood in the modern sense of creating something new.&lt;/ref&gt; The September date is often referred to in the West as [[Holy Cross Day]]; the May date (See also [[Roodmas]].) was dropped from the [[liturgical calendar]] of the Roman Catholic Church in 1970 as part of the liturgical reforms mandated by the [[Second Vatican Council]]  (1962–1965). The Orthodox still commemorate both events on September 14, one of the [[Twelve Great Feasts]] of the [[liturgical year]], and the [[Procession of the Venerable Wood of the Cross]] on 1 August, the day on which the relics of the True Cross would be carried through the streets of [[Constantinople]] to bless the city.&lt;ref name="OCA"&gt;{{cite web| title=Procession of the Honorable Wood of the Life-Giving Cross of the Lord| url=http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?SID=4&amp;ID=1&amp;FSID=102161| publisher=Orthodox Church in America| accessdate=2012-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to celebrations on fixed days, there are certain days of the [[moveable feast|variable cycle]] when the Cross is celebrated. The Roman Catholic Church has a formal Adoration of the Cross (the term is inaccurate, but sanctioned by long use) during the services for [[Good Friday]], while Eastern Orthodox churches everywhere, a replica of the cross is brought out in procession during [[Matins]] of [[Great and Holy Friday]] for the people to venerate. The Orthodox also celebrate an additional Veneration of the Cross on the third Sunday of [[Great Lent]].

'''Vladislav Anatolievich Horohorin''', ({{lang-ru|Владислав Анатольевич Хорохорин}}), alias '''BadB''', is a former [[hacker]] and international [[Carding (fraud)|credit card trafficker]] who was convicted&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-credit-card-trafficker-sentenced-88-months-prison|title=International Credit Card Trafficker Sentenced to 88 Months in Prison|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; of wire fraud and served a seven-year prison sentence. 

== Early life ==
Horohorin was born on September 29, 1982, and grew up in [[Donetsk|Donetsk, Ukraine]], emigrating in 1999 to Israel with his mother, where he served in the [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli Defence Forces]].

== Investigation ==
According to the undercover investigation led by the [[United States Secret Service]], Horohorin was one of the founders of [[CarderPlanet]], one of several websites taken down&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/02/72585?currentPage=all|title=Crime Boards Come Crashing Down|last=Wired|website=WIRED|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 as part of the Secret Service's [[Operation Firewall]] investigation. The web sites were operated by [[cyber criminal]] organizations to [[Carding (fraud)|traffic counterfeit credit cards]], and false identification information and documents.  These websites not only shared information on how to commit fraud, but also provided a forum through which to purchase fraud-related information and tools. "The network created by the founders of CarderPlanet, including Vladislav Horohorin, remains one of the most sophisticated organizations of online financial criminals in the world," said Michael Merritt, Assistant Director for Investigations. "This network has been repeatedly linked to nearly every major intrusion of financial information reported to the international law enforcement community. This arrest illustrates the significance of the Secret Service's commitment to traversing the globe in pursuit of online criminals."{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Horohorin promoted his illegal activities by creating video cartoons ridiculing American card holders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/08/badb/|title=Alleged Carder 'BadB' Busted in France — Watch His Cartoon|last=Zetter|first=Kim|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separately, in 2013, Horohorin was named co-conspirator in an indictment, but was not subsequently charged, in a criminal case in District of New Jersey 09-626(JBS), in which other Russian individuals were charged with successfully hacking Nasdaq, 7-Eleven, Carefour, JCPenney, Heartland Payment Systems, Dow Jones, Jetblue and 23 more corporations.&lt;ref&gt;http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/drinkman072513.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.justice.gov/usao-nj/pr/five-indicted-new-jersey-largest-known-data-breach-conspiracy&lt;/ref&gt; This breach was called the "Largest known data breach conspiracy ever prosecuted" by the U.S. Justice Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-admits-role-largest-known-data-breach-conspiracy-ever-prosecuted|title=Russian National Admits Role in Largest Known Data Breach Conspiracy Ever Prosecuted|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of April 2017, none of Horohorin's co-conspirators had been sentenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rferl.org/a/russian-hacker-drinkman-guilty-fraud/27250304.html|title=Russian Pleads Guilty In Hacking Case|website=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-national-admits-role-largest-known-data-breach-conspiracy-ever-prosecuted|title=Russian National Admits Role in Largest Known Data Breach Conspiracy Ever Prosecuted|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs handled Horohorin's extradition from France.

The case was prosecuted by attorneys Ethan Arenson (who later also prosecuted another notorious cyber criminal, [[Roman Seleznev]]), Carol Sipperly, and Corbin Weiss of the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section ([[CCIPS]]). The District of Columbia case was investigated by the U.S. Secret Service.  Assistance was provided by the [[French police|French Police Nationale Aux Frontiers]] and the Netherlands Police Agency's National Crime Squad High Tech Crime Unit.  The [[FBI Atlanta Field Office]] provided information helpful to the investigation.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The Northern District of Georgia case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Nick Oldham and Lawrence R. Sommerfeld of the Northern District of Georgia, and trial attorney Sipperly of [[CCIPS]].  The Atlanta case was investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Horohorin was represented by [[Arkady L. Bukh]] during proceedings in the U.S.{{cn|date=January 2018}} On October 25, 2012, Horohorin pleaded guilty to two counts of access device fraud as well as conspiracy to commit wire fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-credit-card-trafficker-sentenced-88-months-prison|title=International Credit Card Trafficker Sentenced to 88 Months in Prison|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 2013, Horohorin was sentenced to serve 88 months in prison for his role in the theft of more than $9 million from RBS Worldpay,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/rbs-worldpay-hacked-15-million-cardholders-at-risk-a-1150|title=RBS WorldPay Hacked|access-date=2017-09-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (an Atlanta-based credit card processor), and trafficking in millions of stolen credit and debit cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-credit-card-trafficker-sentenced-88-months-prison|title=International Credit Card Trafficker Sentenced to 88 Months in Prison|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.securityweek.com/notorious-carder-badb-sentenced-88-months|title=Notorious Carder 'BadB' Sentenced to 88 Months {{!}} SecurityWeek.Com|website=www.securityweek.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017, Horohorin was released and was deported from the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://pp.userapi.com/c638131/v638131888/3bed1/3zunifG6wdU.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-prison activities ==
The U.S. assigned two [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) agents to escort Horohorin, while being deported, to Israel, using U.S. airline companies only. Such measures caused Horohorin to be held for what he considered extra time in ICE custody; according to his lawyer, [[Arkady L. Bukh]], "Horohorin opposed ICE detention fiercely, refusing to stay any extra minute in US and demanding to be deported, claiming that his sentence is finished and offering to pay his own plane tickets".{{cn|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5164">'''Zabdiel Boylston''', [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] (March 9, 1679 in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] – March 1, 1766) was a [[physician]] in the [[Boston]] area. He apprenticed with his father, an English surgeon named Thomas Boylston.  He also studied under the Boston physician Dr. Cutler, never attending a formal medical school (the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine|first medical school in North America]] was not founded until 1765).&lt;ref name=AMB&gt;{{Cite AMB1920|wstitle=Boylston, Zabdiel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boylston is known for holding several "firsts" for an American-born physician: He performed the first surgical operation by an American physician, the first removal of gall bladder stones in 1710, and was the first to remove a breast tumor in 1718.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Toledo-Pereyra | first = Luis H. | title = Zabdiel Boylston.

==Inoculation==
During a [[smallpox]] outbreak in 1721 in [[Boston]], he [[inoculation|inoculated]] about 248 people&lt;ref&gt;Blake, John B, ''Public Health in the Town of Boston, 1630–1822''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1959: p. 61, 243&lt;/ref&gt; by applying [[pus]] from a smallpox [[Ulcer (dermatology)|sore]] to a small wound on the subjects, a method said to have been previously used in Africa. Initially, he used the method on two slaves and his own son, who was 13 at the time. This was the first introduction of inoculations to the [[United States]]. An African slave named [[Onesimus (disambiguation)|Onesimus]] taught the idea to [[Cotton Mather]], the influential New England Puritan minister.

His method was initially met by hostility and outright violence from other physicians, and many threats were made on his life, with some even threatening to hang him on the nearest tree. He was forced to hide in a private place of his house for 14 days, a secret known only by his wife. During this hostility, his family was also in a dangerous situation. His wife and children were sitting in their home and a lighted hand-grenade was thrown into the room, but the fuse fell off before an explosion could take place. Even after the violence had subsided, he visited his patients only at midnight and while disguised.&lt;ref&gt;Thacher, James, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_PIUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA187#v=onepage&amp;q=boylston&amp;f=false"American Medical Biography: Or, Memoirs of Eminent Physicians who Have Flourished in America. To which is Prefixed a Succinct History of Medical Science in the United States, from the First Settlement of the Country, Volume 1" : p. 187-188]&lt;/ref&gt; After his initial inoculations of his son and two slaves, he was arrested for a short period of time for it (he was later released with the promise not to inoculate without government permission). In 1724, with a letter of introduction to [[James Jurin|Dr. James Jurin]] by Cotton Mather&lt;ref&gt;Coss, Stephen.

, Boylston traveled to [[London]], where he published his results as ''Historical Account of the Small-Pox Inoculated in New England'', and became a fellow of the [[Royal Society]] two years later. Afterward, he returned to Boston.
