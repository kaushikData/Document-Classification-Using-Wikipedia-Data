'''ACube Systems Srl''' is a company that started in January 2007 from the synergy of the Italian companies [[Alternative Holding Group Srl]], [[Soft3]] and [[Virtual Works]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intuitionbase.com/static.php?section=en_sam440ep&lt;/ref&gt;

The three companies have been engaged in the areas of sale, distribution and engineering of [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] for mainstream systems and alternative platforms for years. They have joined their efforts in the realization of the [[Sam440ep]] platform. Then ongoing [[History of the AmigaOS 4 dispute|dispute over ownership of AmigaOS]] cast doubts about actual release of [[AmigaOS 4]] for this new hardware,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Proven |first=Liam |date=May 3, 2007 |title=The trials of the Amiga continue |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1035139/the-trials-amiga-continue/ |newspaper=The Inquirer|accessdate=April 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; support for Sam440ep was later introduced in AmigaOS 4.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Reimer|first=Jeremy|date=September 23, 2008 |title=It’s alive!: Ars reviews AmigaOS 4.1|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2008/09/amigaos41-ars/|newspaper=Ars Technica |accessdate=April 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since November 2007 Acube Systems distributed AmigaOS 4.0 for [[Amiga]] computers with [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerPC CPU cards]] on behalf of [[Hyperion Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Klaß |first=Christian |date=November 26, 2007 |title=AmigaOS 4.0 für klassische Amigas ist fertig|url=http://www.golem.de/0711/56169.html|newspaper=Golem.de |accessdate=April 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=November 27, 2007 |title=AmigaOS 4.0: Modernes Betriebssystem für Uralt-Rechner|url=http://www.computerwoche.de/a/amigaos-4-0-modernes-betriebssystem-fuer-uralt-rechner,1849003|newspaper=Computerwoche |accessdate=April 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fulco|first=Ivan |date=April 4, 2011 |title=Atari, Commodore, Spectrum Che mania il vintage hi-tech|url=http://www.repubblica.it/tecnologia/2011/04/08/news/ritorno_commodore_64-14683431/|newspaper=la Repubblica.it |accessdate=April 12, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''adaptive system''' is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole that together are able to respond to environmental changes or changes in the interacting parts, in a way analogous to either continuous physiological [[homeostasis]] or evolutionary [[adaptation]] in [[biology]]. [[Feedback loops]] represent a key feature of adaptive systems, such as [[ecosystems]] and individual [[organisms]]; or in the human world, [[communities]], [[organizations]], and [[families]].

Artificial adaptive systems include [[robots]] with [[control system]]s that utilize [[negative feedback]] to maintain desired states.

==The law of adaptation==

The law of adaptation can be stated informally as: 
{{quote|Every adaptive system converges to a state in which all kind of stimulation ceases.&lt;ref&gt;José Antonio Martín H., Javier de Lope and Darío Maravall: "Adaptation, Anticipation and Rationality in Natural and Artificial Systems: Computational Paradigms Mimicking Nature" Natural Computing, December, 2009. Vol. 8(4), pp. 757-775. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11047-008-9096-6 doi]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Formally, the law can be defined as follows:

Given a system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, we say that a physical event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a stimulus for the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; if and only if the probability &lt;math&gt;P(S \rightarrow S'|E)&lt;/math&gt; that the system suffers a change or be perturbed (in its elements or in its processes) when the event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; occurs is strictly greater than the prior probability that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; suffers a change independently of &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;P(S \rightarrow S'|E)&gt;P(S \rightarrow S') &lt;/math&gt;

''Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary system subject to changes in time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be an arbitrary event that is a stimulus for the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;: we say that &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is an adaptive system if and only if when t tends to infinity &lt;math&gt;(t\rightarrow \infty)&lt;/math&gt; the probability that the system &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; change its behavior &lt;math&gt;(S\rightarrow S')&lt;/math&gt; in a time step &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; given the event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the probability that the system change its behavior independently of the occurrence of the event &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. In mathematical terms:''

#- &lt;math&gt; P_{t_0}(S\rightarrow S'|E) &gt; P_{t_0}(S\rightarrow S') &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;
#- &lt;math&gt; \lim_{t\rightarrow \infty} P_t(S\rightarrow S' | E) = P_t(S\rightarrow S')&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, for each instant &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; will exist a temporal interval &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; such that:

:&lt;math&gt; P_{t+h}(S\rightarrow S' | E) - P_{t+h}(S\rightarrow S') &lt; P_t(S\rightarrow S' | E) - P_t(S\rightarrow S')&lt;/math&gt;

==Benefit of self-adjusting systems==
In an adaptive system, a parameter changes slowly and has no preferred value.  In a self-adjusting system though, the parameter value “depends on the history of the system dynamics”.  One of the most important qualities of ''self-adjusting systems'' is its “[[edge of chaos|adaptation to the edge of chaos]]” or ability to avoid [[chaos theory|chaos]].  Practically speaking, by heading to the [[edge of chaos]] without going further, a leader may act spontaneously yet without disaster.  A March/April 2009 Complexity article further explains the self-adjusting systems used and the realistic implications.&lt;ref&gt;Hübler, A. &amp; Wotherspoon, T.: "Self-Adjusting Systems Avoid Chaos". Complexity. 14(4), 8 – 11. 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Physicists have shown that [[adaptation]] to the [[edge of chaos]] occurs in almost all systems with [[feedback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wotherspoon|first1=T.|last2=Hubler|first2=A.|title=Adaptation to the edge of chaos with random-wavelet feedback|journal=J Phys Chem A|doi=10.1021/jp804420g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practopoiesis==
''Practopoiesis,'' a term due to its originator Danko Nikolić, is a reference to a kind of adaptive or self-adjusting system in which [[autopoiesis]] of an ''organism'' or a ''cell'' occurs through [[allopoiesis|allopoietic]] interactions among its ''components''.&lt;ref name=Nikolic2015&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002251931500106X|title=Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. |author=Danko Nikolić|date=2015|doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.03.003|volume=373|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|pages=40–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The components are organized into a [[poiesis|poietic]] hierarchy: one component creates another. The theory proposes that living systems exhibit a hierarchy of four such poietic operations in total:

    ''evolution'' (i) &amp;rarr; ''gene expression'' (ii) &amp;rarr; ''non gene-involving homeostatic mechanisms (anapoiesis)'' (iii) &amp;rarr; ''cell function'' (iv)

Practopoiesis challenges current neuroscience doctrine by asserting that mental operations primarily occur at the anapoietic level (iii) &amp;mdash; i.e., that minds emerge from fast homeostatic (adaptive) mechanisms. This contrasts the widespread belief that thinking is synonymous with neural activity ('cell function' at level iv). 

Each lower level contains knowledge that is more general than the higher level; for example, genes contain more general knowledge than anapoietic mechanisms, which in turn contain more general knowledge than cell functions. This hierarchy of knowledge enables the anapoietic level to directly store concepts, which are necessary for the emergence of mind.

Anti-flash white was used on the [[Royal Air Force]] [[V bombers]] force and the [[Royal Navy]] [[Blackburn Buccaneer]] when used in the nuclear strike role. Nuclear bombers were given – though not at first, until the problem was considered – salmon pink and baby blue [[Royal Air Force roundels|roundel]]s and [[fin flash]] rather than the traditional dark red, white and blue.

Anti-flash white was applied to several prototype aircraft, including the [[BAC TSR-2|British Aircraft Corporation TSR-2]]. Paint used on the [[Avro Vulcan]] was manufactured by ''Cellon'', and that on the [[Handley Page Victor]] by [[Titanine Ltd.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Many [[Strategic Air Command]] nuclear bombers carried anti-flash white without insignia on the underside of the fuselage with light silver-gray or natural metal (later light camouflage) on the upper surfaces.

The [[United States Navy]] [[North American A-5 Vigilante|A-5 Vigilante]] carried anti-flash white without insignia on the underside of the fuselage.

The [[Boeing E-6]] in [[TACAMO]] role was painted anti-flash white but its roundels were not subdued.

[[File:Potains-aspirator.png|thumb|200px|Potain's aspirator]]
A medical '''aspirator''' is a suction machine used to remove [[mucus]], [[blood]], and other bodily fluids from a patient. They can be used during surgical procedures but an operating theater is generally equipped with a central system of vacuum tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aspirator |url=http://www.who.int/medical_devices/innovation/aspirator.pdf |website=Core Medical Equipment |accessdate=19 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most aspirators are therefore portable, for use in [[ambulance]]s and [[nursing home]]s, and can run on AC/DC or battery power. They consist of a vacuum pump, a
vacuum regulator and gauge, a collection canister, and sometimes a
bacterial filter. Plastic tubing is used to continuously draw fluid into the collection canister.

In the past manually operated aspirators were used such as ''Potain's aspirator''.&lt;ref&gt;p. 97, Minor surgery, Henry R. Wharton, in [https://books.google.com/books?id=byqN9YXA9bkC ''System of surgery''], vol. II, Frederic S. Dennis and John S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12660">A '''bias tee''' is a three-port network used for setting the DC [[biasing|bias]] point of some electronic components without disturbing other components.  The bias tee is a [[diplexer]].  The low-frequency port is used to set the bias; the high-frequency port passes the radio-frequency signals but blocks the biasing levels; the combined port connects to the device, which sees both the bias and RF. It is called a ''tee'' because the 3 ports are often arranged in the shape of a '''T'''.

==Design==
[[Image:Bias t.png|right|thumb|250px|Equivalent circuit of a bias tee]]
Conceptually, the bias tee can be viewed as an ideal [[capacitor]] that allows [[alternating current|AC]] through but blocks the [[direct current|DC]] bias and an ideal [[inductor]] that blocks AC but allows DC.  Although some bias tees can be made with a simple inductor and capacitor, wideband bias tees are considerably more complicated because practical components have parasitic elements.

Bias tees are designed for transmission-line environments.  Typically, the characteristic impedance ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; will be 50&amp;nbsp;ohms or 75&amp;nbsp;ohms.  The [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the capacitor (''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'') is chosen to be much less than ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the impedance of the inductor (''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'') is chosen to be much greater than ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
X_C &amp;= \frac{1}{\omega C} = \frac{1}{2\pi f C} \ll Z_0,\\
X_L &amp;= \omega L = 2 \pi f L \gg Z_0,\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;omega;'' is the angular frequency (in radians per second) and ''f'' is the frequency (in hertz).

Bias tees are designed to operate over a range of signal frequencies.  The reactances are chosen to have minimal impact at the lowest frequency.

For wide-range bias tees, the inductor must be large at the lowest frequency.  A large inductor will have a stray capacitance (which creates its self-resonant frequency). At a high enough frequency, the stray capacitance presents a low-impedance shunt path for the signal, and the bias tee becomes ineffective.  Practical wide-band bias tees must use circuit topologies that avoid the shunt path. Instead of one inductor, there will be a series string of inductors.  In addition, there will be additional resistors and capacitors to prevent resonances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Andrews |first=James R. |title= Broadband Coaxial Bias Tees |date= November 2000 |publisher=Picosecond Pulse Labs |series=Application Note |volume=AN-01e |location=Boulder, CO |url=http://www.picosecond.com/objects/AN-01e.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206234649/http://www.picosecond.com/objects/AN-01e.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-06 |doi= |quote=One cannot use a single inductor for broadband bias tees.  Thus for broadband bias tees, the single inductor L shown in Figure 1 is, in reality, several inductors connected in series.  Each inductor is optimized to cover various frequency bands from microwave, UHF, VHF, HF, and MF down to audio frequencies.  The smallest nanohenry, microwave inductor is connected directly to the 50 Ohm coaxline center conductor.  Progressively larger inductors in &amp;micro;H to mH values are then connected in series out to the DC port.  Additional R, L and C components are also needed to ensure controlled "Q"s and smooth frequency crossovers from one inductor to the next.  Thus, a good broadband bias tee is a very complex R–L–C network.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a Picosecond Pulse Labs model 5580 bias tee works from 10&amp;nbsp;kHz to 15&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Andrews|2000|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Consequently, the simple design would need an inductance of at least 800&amp;nbsp;μH (''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' about ''j''50&amp;nbsp;ohms at 10&amp;nbsp;kHz), and that inductor must still look like an inductor at 15&amp;nbsp;GHz.  However, a commercial 820&amp;nbsp;μH inductor has a self-resonant frequency of only 1.8&amp;nbsp;MHz – four orders of magnitude too low.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.digikey.com/scripts/DkSearch/dksus.dll?Detail&amp;name=T1812-821J-ND Tamura surface mount inductor at DigiKey]&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson gives an example of a wideband microstrip bias tee covering 50&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1&amp;nbsp;GHz using four inductors (330&amp;nbsp;nH, 910&amp;nbsp;nH, 18&amp;nbsp;&amp;micro;H, and 470&amp;nbsp;&amp;micro;H) in series.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Johnson |first=Gary W. |title=Wideband Bias Tee |date=8 November 2008 |url=http://wb9jps.com/Gary_Johnson/Bias_Tee_files/Bias_Tee_Design_V2R.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His design cribbed from a commercial bias tee.  He modeled parasitic element values, simulated results, and optimized component selection.  To show the advantage of additional components, Johnson provided a simulation of a bias tee that used just inductors and capacitors without ''Q'' suppression. Johnson provides both simulated and actual performance details.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Johnson |first=Gary W. |date=2 May 2008 |title=WB9JPS Bias Tees. Tested 5-2-08 HP 8753B |url=http://wb9jps.com/Gary_Johnson/Bias_Tee_files/Bias_Tee_Performance.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girardi duplicated and improved on Johnson's design and points out some additional construction issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Claudio |last=Girardi |date=6 August 2015 |title=Wideband bias-tee |url=http://www.qsl.net/in3otd/electronics/bias_tee/bias_tee.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application ==
A bias tee is used to insert [[Direct Current|DC]] power into an [[Alternating Current|AC]] [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signal]] to power remote [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] [[amplifier]]s or other devices.  It is usually positioned at the receiving end of the coaxial cable to pass DC power from an external source to the coaxial cable running to powered device.  A bias “T” consists of a feed [[inductor]] to deliver DC to a [[electrical connector|connector]] on the device side and a blocking [[capacitor]] to keep DC from passing through to the [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]].  The [[Radio frequency|RF]] signal is connected directly from one connector to the other with only the blocking capacitor in series.  The internal blocking [[diode]] prevents damage to the bias “T” if reverse supply [[voltage]] is applied.

Bias tees are used in a variety of applications, but are generally used to provide an RF signal and (DC) power to a remote device where running two separate cables would not be advantageous.&lt;ref name="HamtvbiasT"&gt;{{Citation | title = Bias T for Antenna Mount Preamps | year = 2007 | url = http://www.hamtv.com/pdffiles/biasT.pdf | accessdate = 2008-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Biasing is often used with [[photodiodes]] (vacuum and solid state), [[Microchannel plate detector]]s, [[transistor]]s, and [[triode]]s, so that high frequencies from the signal do not leak into a common power supply rail. Conversely, noise from the power supply does not appear on the signal line. Other examples include:  [[Power over Ethernet]],&lt;ref name="Intel"&gt;{{Citation | title = Power Over Ethernet Bias T Power Module | url = http://download.intel.com/support/wireless/wlan/pro2011b/accesspoint/poe_diagram.pdf | accessdate = 2008-08-08 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080224053421/http://download.intel.com/support/wireless/wlan/pro2011b/accesspoint/poe_diagram.pdf | archivedate = 2008-02-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;PoE is a dubious bias tee. End of span power insertion is done with common mode injection between two signal pairs. Midspan insertion is done on unused pairs rather than the signal line.&lt;/ref&gt; active antennas, low-noise amplifiers, and down converters.&lt;ref name="WiNRADiO"&gt;{{Citation | title = WR-BT-650 HF/VHF Power Injector (Bias 'T') | url = http://www.winradio.co.uk/home/bt-650.htm | accessdate = 2008-08-08 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080705210313/http://www.winradio.co.uk/home/bt-650.htm| archivedate= 5 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[telephone line]] for [[plain old telephone service]] and some early microphones use a bias tee circuit—often with a [[gyrator]] replacing the inductor—this enables a thin cable with only 2 conductors to send power from the system to the device, and send audio from the device back to the system.
Modern microphones often use 3 conductors in a [[phantom power]] circuit very similar to a bias tee circuit.

== Construction ==

There are several bias tee designs.

=== A particular construction ===

The construction of the horizontal bar of the T is based on the rigid [[coaxial cable]] with air as dielectric. The radius is chosen to be as large as possible without allowing higher modes.
The design of a bias "T" is based upon power going out to the remote device, but not being seen by the base station or receiver.  It does this by using a capacitor on the RF output terminal, effectively creating an open circuit for the DC current.&lt;ref name="patent6229408"&gt;{{citation | inventor1-last = Jovanovich | inventor1-first = Alan | inventor2-last = Lam | inventor2-first = For Sander | title =  Zero loss bias "T" | issue-date = 2001 | patent-number = 6229408 | country-code = US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The incoming RF signal, or the one from the antenna, is the output for the DC power.  This front-end of a bias "T" typically consists of a [[bandpass filter]], a low noise [[amplifier]], and a mixer coupled to a local oscillator.&lt;ref name="patent6229408" /&gt;

==== Capacitor ====
At one point a small slice is cut out of the center conductor, therefore a capacitor is formed and low frequencies are blocked. This kind of capacitor has the advantage that it is nearly invisible to higher frequencies. To pass frequencies down to 1&amp;nbsp;MHz the capacitance has to be increased. A dielectric like NPO multiplies the capacitance by a factor of 65. The thickness of the capacitor has to be minimal without leading to electric breakdown in the dielectric, this means to avoid any peaks in the electric field and this means smooth electrodes with rounded edges and a dielectric protruding between the electrodes (doorknob design). A stack of capacitors can be used, but every capacitor needs access to the surface of the inner conductor, because if it's hidden behind another capacitor the high frequencies won't see it, because the electric field needs a lot of time to travel through a dielectric with a high dielectric constant

==== Coil ====
A small coil made of fine wire with an air core or MnFeZn-core connects the inner conductor of one of the sides of the capacitor with the a port in the outer conductor leading down the T.  Frequencies above 1&amp;nbsp;GHz hit the coil from the side and apply an equal electric field to the whole coil. Therefore, no higher modes are excited within the coil. Because of the inductiveness of the coil almost no current leaks from the center conductor to the port. Frequencies between 1&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1&amp;nbsp;GHz do leak into this port, so there is a second coil with a cone shaped core outside of the outer conductor, but inside of a housing to avoid interference with other components. This cone acts like a tapered transmission line transformer. It starts with a high impedance, so a lot of power will be reflected, but the rest will travel down the coil and there is some leakage into the low frequency port.

==== Oscillations ====
Any oscillations in the capacitor or the coil or the composed [[LC circuit]] are damped by the dielectric and the core. Also the small coil should have about 10 ohm resistance to further damp oscillations and avoid ripple on the transmitted spectrum.

[[Image:British Telephone connector.jpg|thumb|BS6312 431A plug; colloquially, a British Telecom plug.]]
'''British telephone sockets''' were introduced in their current plug and socket form on 19 November 1981 by [[BT Group|British Telecom]] to allow subscribers to connect their own telephones. The connectors are specified in [[British Standard]] '''BS 6312'''.&lt;ref&gt;BS 6312-1:1994. Connectors for analogue telecommunication interfaces. Specification for plugs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BS 6312-2.1:1994. Connectors for analogue telecommunication interfaces. Sockets for use with plugs specified in BS 6312:Part 1. Specification for sockets. General requirements.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BS 6312-2.2:1997. Connectors for analogue telecommunication interfaces. Sockets for use with plugs specified in BS 6312-1. Particular requirements for fixed socket-outlets used in permanent wiring installations.&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical characteristics of the telephone interface are specified by individual network operators,&lt;ref&gt;[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/telecoms/policy/network-interconnection/consumer-interface-spec/ Publication of Customer Interface Specifications], Ofcom.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. in British Telecom's SIN 351.&lt;ref name=sin351&gt;[http://www.sinet.bt.com/351v4p5.pdf BT Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN): technical characteristics of the single analogue line interface] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617003810/http://www.sinet.bt.com/351v4p5.pdf |date=June 17, 2013 }}, British Telecom, Suppliers Information Note SIN 351, Issue 4.5, May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Electrical characteristics required of British telephones used to be specified in '''BS 6305'''.&lt;ref name=bs6305&gt;BS 6305:1992.

They are similar to [[modular connector]]s (as used in [[Registered jack|RJ11]]), but feature a side-mounted hook, rather than a bottom-mounted one, and are physically incompatible.

== History ==

{{refimprove|section|date=September 2016}}
[[file:GPO-plan4-telephone-socket-and-plug.jpg|thumb|GPO Plan 4 socket and plug]]

Standard sockets were introduced, as part of the 'New Plan' wiring policy, to allow customers to easily purchase their own telephones, as required by [[Oftel]], the phone regulator. Thus any phone whose plug conformed to BS 6312 and met certain other regulatory standards, such as [[British Approvals Board for Telecommunications|BABT]], could be connected to the network, rather than British Telecom controlling the market. The 'New Plan' was only new to the UK and was based extensively on systems which had been available elsewhere for many years, especially in the US.

The new system replaced the older hard-wired system, which came in many 'flavours' (e.g., Plans 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 2, 2A, 105, 107 etc.), which could be very complicated and required the attendance at the premises of a [[General Post Office (United Kingdom)|GPO]] telephone-engineer, who needed a complete set of 'N' (wiring) Diagrams,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.samhallas.co.uk/repository/n_diagrams/index.htm|title=Post Office N-diagrams|first=Sam|last=Hallas|website=www.samhallas.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=August 2018}} which was very extensive and ran to over 15 volumes of little black ring binders. N diagrams also had their own numbering system (e.g., a Plan 1A had an N diagram of N4502), and were frequently updated.

From the early years of the 1900s, the GPO (subsequently British Telecom) had a plug and socket system available for rent.&lt;ref name="pot-1909"&gt;{{cite book |title=Connections of Telephonic Apparatus and Circuits |publisher=Post Office Telegraph |year=1909 |at=Plate 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later called a "Plan 4" (N762—first edition), and employed a heavy-duty, four-way jack plug 404 (circular in cross-section), on the end of the standard, plaited, cotton-covered instrument cord. It also had to have a separate [[ringer box|bell-set]], which was permanently in-circuit to provide ringing if there were no telephones plugged in. This system survived through various models of telephones from the "[[Candlestick telephone|candlestick]]" 200 and 300 type bakelite phones until the introduction of the [[GPO_telephones#Type_706|700 series]] in 1959, when a smaller "Plug 420" was introduced. The separate bell-set, with its on-board capacitor and coils, also provided a testing circuit for remote engineers, by providing the mandatory 1000 ohm capacitive loop-back.  Rental had to be paid on each telephone and on all the sockets, and hence the system was not that common.

A domestic single British telephone line installation will have a single master socket or line box in the premises, which is provided by BT or another service provider: this socket is the [[demarcation point]] between the customer-owned and maintained [[on-premises wiring]], and the telephone network. For installations using the NTE5 line box (NTE for [[network termination equipment]]), the demarcation point is actually ''within'' the socket: the lower half of the front plate and associated wiring is the customer's, while the permanent wiring on the non-removable section behind this, remains the responsibility of the service provider. Customers are not permitted to access the wiring in a master socket without a removable lower section. Plug-in extension kits are available for customers with this type of installation. The two wires from the exchange are denoted the ''B'' leg at −48{{nbsp}}V relative to ground when the line is not in use and the ''A'' leg which is near ground potential when the line is not in use. The ''A'' leg goes to pin 5 and the ''B'' leg to pin 2 in the master socket. (Although all equipment will work with a reversed line, so a reverse wired socket is not strictly a fault.) When current is flowing on the line, the ''B'' leg voltage collapses to nearer ground and the ''A'' leg voltage moves nearer to the ''B'' leg voltage. The exact voltage drop is a function of the distance to the exchange, and the network wiring type.

Until recently,{{when|date=August 2018}} this socket contained an enclosed spark gap, SP1, that could safely flash over internally to provide high voltage surge protection. This component is no longer used due to negative effects on [[VDSL]] speeds. The socket includes a 1.8&amp;nbsp;µF capacitor (bell circuit) to feed the AC ringing and a 470&amp;nbsp;kΩ resistor (R1, out-of-service resistor) to permit remote testing when no telephones are plugged into any sockets. Additional internal extension (secondary) sockets are wired off the master socket (connected in [[parallel circuits|parallel]] using the [[insulation-displacement connector|IDC]] system) but not containing the surge protector, bell circuit capacitor, and the out-of-service resistor.

The 'old style' fixed master socket  had only one set of terminals on the back and customers were supposed to use extension kits plugged into the front socket; however, many customers hard-wired their own extensions anyway for neatness and robustness reasons, which was a poor arrangement since it provided no way to isolate the customer's internal extension wiring from BT's wiring.

The BT NTE 5 Linebox Socket allows easy disconnection of the internal wiring by removing the two screws and sliding out the bottom half of the socket.

In recent years NTE5 sockets have been fitted in place of master sockets. These have a front plate where the lower half is removable so allowing customer's access to the terminals required for connecting internal extension sockets; it also provides access to a test jack, to determine if line faults are due to the customer's wiring or BT's. The removable panel also allows the external telephone line to be easily disconnected from the internal wiring, provided the wiring of the premises has been correctly carried out. The terminals on the back part used to be large screw terminals; however, all BT NTE5 sockets now use [[insulation-displacement connector]]s (IDCs).

Now that BT does not have a monopoly of internal wiring, they make a substantial charge if a fault reported to them turns out to be in the customer's internal/domestic wiring. It is therefore important for the customer to have the facility to check whether any problem or fault is in their internal wiring/equipment or externally in BT's cabling or systems.  Since the NTE5 socket represents the official [[demarcation point]] between the internal/domestic wiring (at the removable front of the socket which is the customer's responsibility) and the external telephone line/cabling fixed at the rear (which is BT's responsibility) the physical disconnection of the two sets of wires (made possible by the NTE5's removable front plate) is crucial in identifying faults and allocating responsibility for their rectification.

In 2009, BT Introduced a [[vdsl|vDSL]] service to the UK known as [[BT Infinity]] and at the same time introduced the BT vDSL Interstitial Faceplate, which performs two functions: [[DSL filter]] and Bell Wire noise suppression. The vDSL modem now plugs directly into the 6P6C modular socket on the faceplate. The faceplate can be easily fitted by removing the two bottom screws on a NTE5, sliding the bottom section out and fitting this in between. The result is that the entire extension circuit is filtered by the vDSL plate meaning that there is now no need for DSL filters on every Telephone Socket in the house. This product can also be fitted to [[ADSL]] lines and has been shown to improve connection speeds for vDSL and aDSL customers alike.

== Plugs ==
[[Image:BritishPhonePlug.jpg|thumb|British telephone plug with only two pins present (2 and 5), from a modem cable]]

There are two types of modern [[British Telecom]] plugs in common use for connecting telephones, the 431A and 631A.

431A is 4-way and 631A 6-way. There are also plugs with only two contacts commonly seen on modem leads. These are a recent introduction and do not seem to be easily available as separate parts. All fit any right-handed "Type 600" telephone socket.

Type 430A and 630A plugs have the latch on the opposite (left hand) side of the plug, and were used as headset plugs on some switchboards and as handset connectors on some telephones, e.g. Ambassador.

The 631A and 630A plugs are also used for connecting sensors to interfaces for computer based measurements in educational environments, the former for connecting analogue sensors and the latter for digital sensors. Companies using these plugs include Vernier, TI and Casio, for interfaces connecting to their graphical calculators, and in the Netherlands CMA.

The BS 6312 specification defines the terminal numbering of a socket-outlet in the opposite direction to the pin numbers of the socket. Thus terminal 1 is connected to pin 6, terminal 2 to pin 5 and so on. The pins of the 631A plug are numbered in ascending order from left to right with the contacts facing upwards and the latch on the right hand side.

==Connector on phone==
The connector on the phone is not standardized: the connector at the wall is standardized by regulation, to allow individuals to use their own phones ([[interconnection]]), but the wire from the phone to the wall may be hard-wired to the phone, or use various connectors.

Typically it will have a 6P4C or 6P2C [[modular connector]] at the telephone end: this latter may be wired as per the RJ11 standard (with pins 3 and 4), or it may be wired with pins 2 and 5, as a [[straight through cable]] from the BT plug (which uses pins 2 and 5 for the line, unlike RJ11, which uses pins 3 and 4). Thus cables are not in general compatible between different phones, as the phone base may have a socket with pins 2 and 5 (requiring a straight through cable), or have an RJ11 socket (requiring a [[crossover cable]]).

==Use in other countries==

The BS 6312 jack has been used in [[Telecommunications in New Zealand|New Zealand]] since the 1980s, replacing a number of other connectors and hard-wired connections, and was subsequently replaced by a "2-wire" version suited to [[Daisy chain (network topology)#Daisy chain|daisy chain]] wiring that eliminated the 3rd ringing voltage wire.  The "BT Jack" is still the most common phone jack in use, although many installations in business use [[structured cabling]] with "RJ45" [[Modular connector#8P8C|8P8C modular connector]]s for telephone as well as data services. Since 2010 the  Telecommunications Carriers Forum Premises Wiring Code of Practice&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premises Wiring Code of Practice |url=http://www.tcf.org.nz/library/e72d1374-8040-4022-ba79-428d56eb4a9b.cmr |publisher=Telecommunications Carriers Forum |accessdate=5 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602064301/http://www.tcf.org.nz/library/e72d1374-8040-4022-ba79-428d56eb4a9b.cmr |archivedate=June 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has deprecated BT jacks in favour of "RJ45" modular jacks for all new residential and SOHO phone/data networks, although not yet a mandatory standard in 2016.

It is also used in [[Bahrain]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Belize]], [[Botswana]], [[Brunei]], [[Cyprus]], [[Eritrea]], the [[Falkland Islands]], [[Ghana]], [[Gibraltar]], [[Israel]],  [[Jordan]], [[Kenya]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]], [[Malta]], [[Myanmar|Myanmar (Burma)]], [[Nigeria]], [[Oman]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]],  [[Swaziland]], [[Tanzania]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Zambia]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. The jack is still found in [[Hong Kong]], where new installations ceased in 1998, while in [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]], new installations ceased in 2001, with [[Registered jack|RJ11]] now used instead.

&lt;BR&gt;
While BS 6312 was not adopted in the [[Republic of Ireland]], Irish phone jacks have some similarity to their UK cousins due to GPO influences in the old Irish wiring systems. Ireland's P&amp;T adopted [[Bell System]] style 6P6C sockets and 6P4C "RJ11" plugs in the late 1970, several years earlier than BS 6312 was rolled out by BT in the UK. Irish phone sockets are normally wired, as per the international standard, with the line carried on the centre pair (pin 3 and 4). Although it is rarely connected, Irish phone jacks also contain a ringing capacitor circuit very similar to their UK counterparts. This is carried on pin 5. Or, if wired for two-line service (rare), a second ring wire is carried on pin 2 for line 2, with the outer pair, pins 1 and 6 carrying the second line. 
This arrangement was introduced for the same reason as the capacitor in BS 6313; to allow backwards compatibility with older GPO style type 3 wire phones that lacked an anti-tinkle circuit, which were common in the 1970s and into the 1980s. Modern Irish jacks also contain screw down lugs to connect extension phone wiring or a hardwired pre 1970s phone. The connection block has an “R” terminal for connecting the ringing wire to the capacitor. Despite the circuitry being available in the jack, UK phones should still be connected with an adapter with its own ringing capacitor, as the “R” wire typically is no longer connected in most homes, unless the wiring was originally used with rotary dial telephones.

==Making the connections==

As previously mentioned the actual connections are made using [[Insulation-displacement connector]]s (IDC). A [[punch down tool]] is required to do this and two sorts are available.  One is of plastic construction and only intended for occasional use.  The other is a professional tool used by installers, which is a spring loaded push down tool that both inserts the wire and trims it in one action : an example is shown in the photograph. It also comes with a tool for removing wires from sockets. From Q3 2016, Openreach started using a new, "toolless" version of the demarcation socket&amp;mdash;the ''NTE5C''&amp;mdash;which does not require an IDC tool to make the connections. 
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Six Wire Connected.jpg|LJ 2/1A - 6 wire cable connected to a master socket
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Cabling arrangements==
Shown below are the cabling arrangements for both 4-wire and 6-wire cable.  Initially 4-wire was used and many older installations still use it, then the 6-wire became the new standard, but the 4-wire has latterly been reissued to all Openreach technicians as part of cost savings. Modern 4-wire however is the same diameter as 6-wire to allow technicians to retain existing tacking guns and cable clips. Note that the wires in the 6-wire cable are coloured with two colours in a ratio of four to one in length, with the first colour mentioned being the predominant one, e.g. if the indicated colour of the wire is W-B then the wire will be coloured white for 12&amp;nbsp;mm, then blue for 3&amp;nbsp;mm and so on. (In other words, it looks like a white wire with blue patches on it.)

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Strictly speaking, a textbook installation will only actually use pins 2, 5 (for the voice) and 3 (for the ringer). Having said this, most modern telephones no longer require a ringing capacitor may have and 2-wire connections, which means that extension wiring can usually be run with only pins 2 and 5. Often where multi-core cable is used, the remaining cables are used for wiring extensions on additional incoming telephone lines.

==Broadband==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2012}} 
[[Image:DSL Filter.jpg|right|thumb|DSL Filter]]
[[Image:NTE5 ADSL.jpg|right|thumb|Replacement face plate for an NTE5 containing a built-in ADSL filter]]

In order to use [[Internet access|Broadband]] [[Internet]] services simultaneously with voice telephony, it is necessary to use a [[DSL filter]]. This is a low pass filter in line with the phone outlet. This prevents high frequency data noise from affecting the lower frequency voice bandwidth and it also prevents the low impedance of the connected phone from attenuating or modulating the high speed DSL data Path. Enough bandwidth is retained for voice telephony and the majority is used for high speed data. 

All phones (or other voice band devices) must be connected via a filter (either a separate filter for each phone or one filter covering multiple phones) to avoid interference between the phones and the DSL signal. If the data transmission is still audible, using two DSL filters, daisychained in series, should eliminate the problem. The RJ11 female port provided on the filter case simply connects the DSL router directly to the phone line (most DSL filters have a socket marked DSL or ADSL that just connects the DSL line pair directly through to the incoming phone line pair via the BT plug, without any filtering or processing of any kind). The ringer wire is unnecessary in unfiltered parts of the wiring and its removal can often improve performance and reliability of the broadband service. This is due to the unbalancing effect that the ringer wire (on long extensions) can have on the matched twisted pair. Thus reducing the signal to noise ratio and also the high frequency response of the subscriber line.

When ADSL was first introduced in the UK it was installed by a technician who replaced the front part of the NTE5 (if the property still had an old style master socket it would be replaced with an NTE5) with one containing a filter. Any hardwired phone extensions were disconnected from the original front part and connected to filtered terminals on the back of the filter. The DSL modem (which at the time was also BT supplied) and, if present, a phone or plug-in extension, could then be plugged into the front. If it was desired to locate the DSL modem away from the master socket a plug-in ADSL extension kit could be purchased.

BT also offered "wires-only" ADSL service and promoted the technique of using a separate plug-in filter on every socket.&lt;ref&gt;Initial provisions were usually NTE5, with a new faceplate, but previous [[Home Highway]] (ISDN-like) installations received microfilters.&lt;/ref&gt; While both technically inferior and far less tidy than the solution BT engineers had used, it was usually adequate and was simple enough for a non-technical householder to understand. The more discerning customer can purchase a variety of hardwired filtering products, including replacement front plates for the NTE5, some of which have unfiltered as well as filtered terminals on the back to avoid the need to plug in the extension wiring that leads to the DSL modem.

[[Image:NTE5 iPlate.jpg|right|thumb|NTE5 showing it being fitted with a BT IPlate. The IPlate is the part in the middle of the sandwich]]

In 2008 BT trialled and launched their 'IPlate'; the "I" is for [[wikt:interstitial|interstitial]], as it is fitted between the socket and the front panel. This plate is fitted by the consumer inside the NTE 5 and reduces interference carried by the 3rd (bell) wire. The reduced interference allows faster broadband speeds - BT claim a speed improvement of up to 1.5 Mbit/s with a theoretical 4 Mbit/s. By November 2009 BT were calling the I-plate a "BT Broadband Accelerator".

== Structured cabling ==
[[Structured cabling]] systems are general-purpose communications wires installed in offices and increasingly also homes, which can be used for several different communication technologies (analog phone, ADSL, ISDN, Ethernet, video, etc.). The most common type uses [[Category 5 cable]]s (four [[twisted pair]]s with 100 ohm impedance) between [[8P8C]] (colloquially and incorrectly called [[RJ45 (computers)|RJ45]]) room sockets and a central [[patch panel]].

The A and B wires of an analogue phone line appear in a structured cabling system usually on the centre pins of the 8P8C connector (pins 4 and 5; the blue/white [[TIA/EIA-568]] pair 1 in Cat5 cables). In most other countries, those two wires are all that is needed to connect an analogue telephone. In the UK, however, many telephones expect the 25&amp;nbsp;Hz ring signal on a third wire. But such a 3-wire interface is not the symmetric interface needed for [[balanced]] twisted-pair [[transmission line]]s, and therefore prone to electromagnetic interference and crosstalk with nearby other wiring. Therefore, the capacitor that separates the bell signal from the A/B wires should be located close to the telephone. Any bell wire provided by the master socket is therefore not connected to the structured cabling, and the telephone is plugged at the other end into the structured cabling via a ''line adapter unit'' (LAU) / ''Mod-Tap'' / [[Molex]] that contains the capacitor needed to create the separate bell signal. Different types of LAUs are on the market:

* PSTN secondary/slave: for phones that need no bell wire
* PABX master: contains ring capacitor, to provide from the 8P8C 2-wire interface the 3rd "bell wire" required by UK phones
* PSTN master: implements all the circuitry found in a BT master socket, including surge protection, ring capacitor, test resistor

There exists no well-established standard in which polarity pins 2 and 5 of the phone socket are connected to pins 4 and 5 of the 8P8C connector; both alternatives are common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.evonet.com/evonet/index.asp?Page=102 Colour chart for telephone wiring over CAT5 cables (UK / US)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422152929/http://www.evonet.com/evonet/index.asp?Page=102 |date=April 22, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This polarity is not normally important; BT does specify that the B wire is more negative than the A, though they no longer specify which of the A and B wires are connected to pins 2 and 5 of their master telephone socket,&lt;ref name=sin351/&gt; although earlier standards specified that the A wire be connected to 5 and the B wire to 2.

[[File:En-us-cathodic.ogg|thumb|Pronunciation of the word "Cathodic"]]

'''Cathodic protection''' (CP) is a technique used to control the [[corrosion]] of a metal surface by making it the [[cathode]] of an [[electrochemical cell]].&lt;ref&gt;Peabody p.6&lt;/ref&gt; A simple method of protection connects the metal to be protected to a more easily corroded "[[sacrificial metal]]" to act as the [[anode]].  The sacrificial metal then corrodes instead of the protected metal.   For structures such as long [[pipeline transport|pipelines]],  where passive galvanic cathodic protection is not adequate, an external DC electrical power source is used to provide sufficient current.

Cathodic protection systems protect a wide range of metallic structures in various environments. Common applications are: [[steel]] water or fuel pipelines and steel [[storage tank]]s such as home [[water heater]]s; steel pier [[Deep foundation|piles]]; ship and boat hulls; offshore [[oil platform]]s and onshore [[oil well]] casings; [[offshore wind farm]] foundations and metal reinforcement bars in concrete buildings and structures.  Another common application is in [[galvanization|galvanized steel]], in which a sacrificial coating of [[zinc]] on steel parts protects them from rust.

Cathodic protection can, in some cases, prevent [[stress corrosion cracking]].

==History==
Cathodic protection was first described by Sir [[Humphry Davy]] in a series of papers presented to the [[Royal Society]]&lt;ref&gt;Davy, cited in Ashworth 1994&lt;/ref&gt; in London in 1824. The first application was to {{HMS|Samarang|1822|6}} &lt;ref&gt;Ashworth, 10:3&lt;/ref&gt; in 1824. [[Sacrificial anode]]s made from [[iron]] attached to the [[Copper sheathing|copper sheath]] of the hull below the waterline dramatically reduced the corrosion rate of the [[copper]]. However, a side effect of cathodic protection was the increase in [[marine growth]]. Usually, copper when corroding releases copper ions which have an [[anti-fouling]] effect. Since excess marine growth affected the performance of the ship, the [[Royal Navy]] decided that it was better to allow the copper to corrode and have the benefit of reduced marine growth, so cathodic protection was not used further.

Davy was assisted in his experiments by his pupil [[Michael Faraday]], who continued his research after Davy's death. In 1834, Faraday discovered the quantitative connection between corrosion weight loss and electric current and thus laid the foundation for the future application of cathodic protection.&lt;ref&gt;Baeckmann, Schwenck &amp; Prinz, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Edison]] experimented with impressed current cathodic protection on ships in 1890, but was unsuccessful due to the lack of a suitable current source and anode materials. It would be 100 years after Davy's experiment before cathodic protection was used widely on oil pipelines in the United States&lt;ref&gt;Scherer, 38(27), 179 cited in Baeckman&lt;/ref&gt; {{mdash}} cathodic protection was applied to steel gas pipelines beginning in 1928&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Kuhn, Cathodic Protection of Underground Pipe Lines from Soil Corrosion, [[American Petroleum Institute|API]] Proceedings, Nov. 1933, Vol. 14, p157&lt;/ref&gt; and more widely in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Natural Resources Canada Retrieved 23 JAN 2012([http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/minerals-metals/materials-technology/picon/3149]) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106080642/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/minerals-metals/materials-technology/picon/3149 |date=January 6, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:Sacrificial anode.jpg|thumb|Galvanic [[sacrificial anode]] attached to the hull of a ship, showing corrosion.]]

===Galvanic===
In the application of ''passive'' cathodic protection, a ''[[galvanic anode]]'', a piece of a more electrochemically "active" metal, is attached to the vulnerable metal surface where it is exposed to an electrolyte.  Galvanic anodes are selected because they have a more "active" voltage (more negative [[electrode potential]]) than the metal of the target structure (typically steel). 

Concrete has a pH around 13. In this environment the steel reinforcement has a passive protective layer and remains largely stable. Galvanic systems are "constant potential" systems that aim to restore the concrete's natural protective environment by providing a high initial current to restore passivity. It then reverts to a lower sacrificial current while harmful negative Chloride ions migrate away from the steel and towards the positive anode. The anodes remain reactive through their lifetime (10-20 years typically) increasing current when the resistivity decreases due to corrosion hazards such as rainfall, temperature increases or flooding. The reactive nature of these anodes makes them an efficient choice.

Unlike ICCP systems steel constant polarization is not the goal, rather the restoration of the environment. Polarization of the target structure is caused by the electron flow from the anode to the cathode, so the two metals must have a good [[electrical conductivity|electrically conductive]] contact. The driving force for the cathodic protection current is the difference in electrode potential between the anode and the cathode.&lt;ref&gt;Roberge p.871&lt;/ref&gt; During the initial phase of high current, the potential of the steel surface is polarized (pushed) more negative protecting the steel which hydroxide ion generation at the steel surface and ionic migration restore the concrete environment. 

Over time the galvanic anode continues to corrode, consuming the anode material until eventually it must be replaced.&lt;br&gt; 

Galvanic or sacrificial anodes are made in various shapes and sizes using [[alloy]]s of [[zinc]], [[magnesium]] and [[aluminium]]. [[ASTM International]] publishes standards on the composition and manufacturing of galvanic anodes.&lt;ref&gt;ASTM B418-16 Standard Specification for Cast and Wrought Galvanic Zinc Anodes&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASTM B843-13 Standard Specification for Magnesium Alloy Anodes for Cathodic Protection&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASTM F1182-07(2013) Standard Specification for Anodes, Sacrificial Zinc Alloy&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for galvanic cathodic protection to work, the anode must possess a lower (that is, more negative) electrode potential than that of the cathode (the target structure to be protected). The table below shows a simplified [[galvanic series]] which is used to select the anode metal.&lt;ref&gt;Peabody p.304&lt;/ref&gt;  The anode must be chosen from a material that is lower on the list than the material to be protected.

==={{anchor|ICCP}}Impressed current systems===
[[File:Cathodic Protection diagram.svg|thumb|Simple impressed current cathodic protection system. A source of [[direct current|DC]] electric current is used to help drive the protective electrochemical reaction.]]

In some cases, ''impressed current cathodic protection'' (ICCP) systems are used. These consist of anodes connected to a DC power source, often a transformer-rectifier connected to AC power. In the absence of an AC supply, alternative power sources may be used, such as solar panels, wind power or gas powered thermoelectric generators.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth 10:10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roberge p.880&lt;/ref&gt;

Anodes for ICCP systems are available in a variety of shapes and sizes. Common anodes are tubular and solid rod shapes or continuous ribbons of various materials. These include high [[silicon]] [[cast iron]], [[graphite]], [[mixed metal oxide]], [[platinum]] and [[niobium]] coated wire and other materials.

For pipelines, anodes are arranged in groundbeds either distributed or in a deep vertical hole depending on several design and field condition factors including current distribution requirements.

Cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units are often custom manufactured and equipped with a variety of features, including remote monitoring and control, integral current interrupters and various type of electrical [[Enclosure (electrical)|enclosure]]s. The output DC negative terminal is connected to the structure to be protected by the cathodic protection system.&lt;ref&gt;Peabody p.158&lt;/ref&gt; The rectifier output DC positive cable is connected to the [[anode]]s. The AC power cable is connected to the rectifier input terminals.

The output of the ICCP system should be optimised to provide enough current to provide protection to the target structure.  Some cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units are designed with taps on the [[transformer]] windings and jumper terminals to select the voltage output of the ICCP system. Cathodic protection transformer-rectifier units for water tanks and used in other applications are made with [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] circuits to automatically adjust the operating voltage to maintain the optimum current output or structure-to-electrolyte [[potential]].&lt;ref&gt;Baeckmann, Schwenck &amp; Prinz, p.233&lt;/ref&gt; [[analog circuit|Analog]] or [[Digital data|digital]] meters are often installed to show the operating voltage (DC and sometime AC) and current output.  For shore structures and other large complex target structures, ICCP system are often designed with multiple independent zones of anodes with separate cathodic protection transformer-rectifier circuits.

===Hybrid Systems===
Hybrid systems have been used for over a decade and incorporate the coordination, monitoring and high restorative current flow of ICCP systems with the reactive, lower cost and easier to maintain galvanic anodes.

The system is made up of wired galvanic anodes in arrays typically 400mm apart which are then initially powered for a short period to restore the concrete and power ionic migration. The power supply is then taken away and the anodes simply attached to the steel as a galvanic system. More powered phases can be administered if needed. Like Galvanic systems corrosion rate monitoring from polarisation tests and half-cell potential mapping can be used to measure corrosion. Polarization is not the goal for the life of the system.

==Applications==

===Pipelines===
[[File:Cathodic Protection Rectifier.JPG|thumb|An air cooled cathodic protection rectifier connected to a pipeline.]]
[[File:Gas Mains cathodic protection markers, Wellington Street, Leeds (12th April 2014).JPG|thumb|right|Cathodic protection markers over a gas pipeline in [[Leeds]], [[West Yorkshire]], [[England]].]]

Hazardous product [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] are routinely protected by a coating supplemented with cathodic protection. An impressed current cathodic protection system (ICCP) for a pipeline consists of a DC power source, often an AC powered transformer rectifier and an anode, or array of anodes buried in the ground (the anode [[groundbed]]).

The DC power source would typically have a DC output of up to 50 [[ampere]]s and 50 [[volt]]s, but this depends on several factors, such as the size of the pipeline and coating quality. The positive DC output terminal would be connected via [[Electrical cable|cables]] to the anode array, while another cable would connect the negative terminal of the rectifier to the pipeline, preferably through junction boxes to allow measurements to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;Peabody p.22&lt;/ref&gt;

Anodes can be installed in a groundbed consisting of a vertical hole backfilled with conductive [[coke (fuel)|coke]] (a material that improves the performance and life of the anodes) or laid in a prepared trench, surrounded by conductive coke and backfilled. The choice of groundbed type and size depends on the application, location and soil resistivity.&lt;ref&gt;Peabody p.132&lt;/ref&gt;

The DC cathodic protection current is then adjusted to the optimum level after conducting various tests including measurements of pipe-to-soil potentials or [[electrode potential]].

It is sometimes more economically viable to protect a pipeline using galvanic (sacrificial) anodes. This is often the case on smaller diameter pipelines of limited length.&lt;ref&gt;Peabody p.32&lt;/ref&gt;  Galvanic anodes rely on the [[galvanic series]] potentials of the metals to drive cathodic protection current from the anode to the structure being protected.

Water pipelines of various pipe materials are also provided with cathodic protection where owners determine the cost is reasonable for the expected pipeline [[service life]] extension attributed to the application of cathodic protection.

===Ships and boats===
[[File:Ship-propeller.jpg|thumb|The white patches visible on the ship's hull are zinc block sacrificial anodes.]]

Cathodic protection on [[ship]]s is often implemented by galvanic anodes attached to the hull and ICCP for larger vessels. Since ships are regularly removed from the water for inspections and maintenance, it is a simple task to replace the galvanic anodes.&lt;ref&gt;BS 7361-1:1991 Sect. 6.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Galvanic anodes are generally shaped to reduced drag in the water and fitted flush to the hull to also try to minimize drag.&lt;ref&gt;BS 7361-1:1991 Sect. 6.2.1.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Smaller vessels, with non-metallic hulls, such as [[yacht]]s, are equipped with galvanic anodes to protect areas such as [[outboard motor]]s.  As with all galvanic cathodic protection, this application relies on a solid electrical connection between the anode and the item to be protected.

For ICCP on ships, the anodes are usually constructed of a relatively inert material such as platinised titanium. A DC power supply is provided within the ship and the anodes mounted on the outside of the hull. The anode cables are introduced into the ship via a [[compression seal fitting]] and routed to the DC power source. The negative cable from the power supply is simply attached to the hull to complete the circuit.  Ship ICCP anodes are flush-mounted, minimizing the effects of drag on the ship, and located a minimum 5&amp;nbsp;ft below the light [[waterline|load line]]&lt;ref&gt;CP-2 Cathodic Protection Technician-Maritime Student Manual NACE International, July 2009, pg 3-11&lt;/ref&gt; in an area to avoid mechanical damage.  The current density required for protection is a function of velocity and considered when selecting the current capacity and location of anode placement on the hull.

Some ships may require specialist treatment, for example aluminium hulls with steel fixtures will create an electrochemical cell where the aluminium hull can act as a galvanic anode and corrosion is enhanced. In cases like this, aluminium or zinc galvanic anodes can be used to offset the potential difference between the aluminium hull and the steel fixture.&lt;ref&gt;EN 12473:2000 Sect. 8.3.1&lt;/ref&gt; If the steel fixtures are large, several galvanic anodes may be required, or even a small ICCP system.

===Marine===
Marine cathodic protection covers many areas, [[jetty|jetties]], [[harbour]]s, [[offshore construction|offshore]] structures. The variety of different types of structure leads to a variety of systems to provide protection. Galvanic anodes are favored,&lt;ref&gt;Roberge p.876&lt;/ref&gt; but ICCP can also often be used.  Because of the wide variety of structure geometry, composition, and architecture, specialized firms are often required to engineer structure-specific cathodic protection systems. Sometimes marine structures require retroactive modification to be effectively protected &lt;ref&gt;Britton p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steel in concrete===
The application to [[concrete]] [[rebar|reinforcement]] is slightly different in that the anodes and reference electrodes are usually embedded in the concrete at the time of construction when the concrete is being poured.  The usual technique for concrete buildings, bridges and similar structures is to use ICCP,&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth et al 10:82&lt;/ref&gt; but there are systems available that use the principle of galvanic cathodic protection as well,&lt;ref&gt;Covino et al/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daily&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Highways Agency Sect. 4.8&lt;/ref&gt; although in the UK at least, the use of galvanic anodes for atmospherically exposed reinforced concrete structures is considered experimental.&lt;ref&gt;Highways Agency Sect. 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

For ICCP, the principle is the same as any other ICCP system. However, in a typical atmospherically exposed concrete structure such as a bridge, there will be many more anodes distributed through the structure as opposed to an array of anodes as used on a pipeline. This makes for a more complicated system and usually an automatically controlled DC power source is used, possibly with an option for remote monitoring and operation.&lt;ref&gt;Highways Agency Sect. 4.5&lt;/ref&gt; For buried or submerged structures, the treatment is similar to that of any other buried or submerged structure.

Galvanic systems offer the advantage of being easier to retrofit and do not need any control systems as ICCP does.

For pipelines constructed from [[pre-stressed concrete]] cylinder pipe (PCCP), the techniques used for cathodic protection are generally as for steel pipelines except that the applied potential must be limited to prevent damage to the prestressing wire.&lt;ref&gt;NACE RP0100-2000 Sect. 5.2.5&lt;/ref&gt;

The steel wire in a PCCP pipeline is stressed to the point that any corrosion of the wire can result in failure. An additional problem is that any excessive hydrogen ions as a result of an excessively negative potential can cause hydrogen embrittlement of the wire, also resulting in failure. The failure of too many wires will result in catastrophic failure of the PCCP.&lt;ref&gt;Gummow&lt;/ref&gt; To implement ICCP therefore requires very careful control to ensure satisfactory protection. A simpler option is to use galvanic anodes, which are self-limiting and need no control.&lt;ref&gt;NACE RP0100-2000 Sect. 5.4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internal cathodic protection===
Vessels, pipelines and tanks which are used to store or transport liquids can also be protected from corrosion on their internal surfaces by the use of cathodic protection.&lt;ref&gt;EN 12499:2003&lt;/ref&gt; ICCP and galvanic systems can be used.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth et al 10:112&lt;/ref&gt; A common application of internal cathodic protection is water storage tanks and [[Power station|power plant]] [[shell and tube heat exchanger]]s.

===Galvanized steel===
[[Galvanizing]] generally refers to [[hot-dip galvanizing]] which is a way of coating steel with a layer of metallic zinc or tin. Galvanized coatings are quite durable in most environments because they combine the barrier properties of a [[coating]] with some of the benefits of cathodic protection. If the zinc coating is scratched or otherwise locally damaged and steel is exposed, the surrounding areas of zinc coating form a galvanic cell with the exposed steel and protect it from corrosion. This is a form of localized cathodic protection - the zinc acts as a sacrificial anode.

Galvanizing, while using the electrochemical principle of cathodic protection, is not actually cathodic protection. Cathodic protection requires the anode to be separate from the metal surface to be protected, with an ionic connection through the electrolyte and an electron connection through a connecting cable, bolt or similar. This means that any area of the protected structure within the electrolyte can be protected, whereas in the case of galvanizing, only areas very close to the zinc are protected. Hence, a larger area of bare steel would only be protected around the edges.

===Automobiles===
Several companies market electronic devices claiming to mitigate corrosion for automobiles and trucks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiantire.ca/en/pdp/counteract-electronic-rust-protection-system-0477905p.html CounterAct at Canadian Tire retailer]&lt;/ref&gt; Corrosion control professionals find they do not work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nace.org/StarterApps/Wiki/Dynamic.aspx?id=367&amp;__taxonomyid=225 NACE International Article Electronic Rust Prevention]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is no peer reviewed scientific testing and validation supporting the use of the devices. In 1996 the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] ordered David McCready, a person that sold devices claiming to protect cars from corrosion, to pay restitution and banned the names "Rust Buster" and "Rust Evader."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/1996/07/rust-evader-inventor-settles-ftc-charges Federal Trade Commission Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Testing==

[[Electrode potential]] is measured with [[reference electrode]]s. [[Copper-copper(II) sulfate electrode|Copper-copper sulphate electrode]]s are used for structures in contact with [[soil]] or fresh water.  [[Silver chloride electrode|Silver/silver chloride/seawater electrodes]] or pure [[zinc]] electrodes are used for [[seawater]] applications. The methods are described in EN 13509:2003 and NACE TM0497 along with the sources of error&lt;ref&gt;NACE TM0497 Section 5.8&lt;/ref&gt; in the voltage that appears on the display of the meter. Interpretation of electrode potential measurements to determine the potential at the interface between the anode of the corrosion cell and the electrolyte requires training&lt;ref&gt;NACE TM0497 Section 1.2&lt;/ref&gt; and cannot be expected to match the accuracy of measurements done in laboratory work.

==Problems==

===Production of hydrogen===
A side effect of improperly applied cathodic protection is the production of atomic [[hydrogen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|baHwfLpWpP8C|Fundamentals of Electrochemical Corrosion|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to its absorption in the protected metal and subsequent [[hydrogen embrittlement]] of welds and materials with high hardness.  Under normal conditions, the atomic hydrogen will combine at the metal surface to create hydrogen gas, which cannot penetrate the metal.  Hydrogen atoms, however, are small enough to pass through the crystalline steel structure, and lead in some cases to hydrogen embrittlement.

===Cathodic disbonding===
This is a process of disbondment of protective coatings from the protected structure (cathode) due to the formation of hydrogen ions over the surface of the protected material (cathode).&lt;ref&gt;Roberge Sect. 11.4.1, p.886&lt;/ref&gt; Disbonding can be exacerbated by an increase in alkali ions and an increase in cathodic polarization.&lt;ref&gt;Baeckmann, Schwenck &amp; Prinz, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of disbonding is also reliant on the type of coating, with some coatings affected more than others.&lt;ref&gt;Baeckmann, Schwenck &amp; Prinz, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; Cathodic protection systems should be operated so that the structure does not become excessively polarized,&lt;ref&gt;Peabody p.37&lt;/ref&gt; since this also promotes disbonding due to excessively negative potentials. Cathodic disbonding occurs rapidly in pipelines that contain hot fluids because the process is accelerated by heat flow.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

===Cathodic shielding===
Effectiveness of cathodic protection (CP) systems on steel pipelines can be impaired by the use of solid film backed dielectric coatings such as polyethylene tapes, shrinkable pipeline sleeves, and factory applied single or multiple solid film coatings.  This phenomenon occurs because of the high electrical resistivity of these film backings.&lt;ref&gt;NACE International Paper 09043&lt;/ref&gt;  Protective electric current from the cathodic protection system is blocked or shielded from reaching the underlying metal by the highly resistive film backing.  Cathodic shielding was first defined in the 1980s as being a problem, and technical papers on the subject have been regularly published since then.

A 1999 report&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Safety Board of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; concerning a {{convert|20600|oilbbl|abbr=on}} spill from a [[Saskatchewan]] [[crude oil]] line contains an excellent definition of the cathodic shielding problem:

:"The triple situation of disbondment of the (corrosion) coating, the dielectric nature of the coating and the unique electrochemical environment established under the exterior coating, which acts as a shield to the electrical CP current, is referred to as CP shielding.  The combination of tenting and disbondment permits a corrosive environment around the outside of the pipe to enter into the void between the exterior coating and the pipe surface.  With the development of this CP shielding phenomenon, impressed current from the CP system cannot access exposed metal under the exterior coating to protect the pipe surface from the consequences of an aggressive corrosive environment.  The CP shielding phenomenon induces changes in the potential gradient of the CP system across the exterior coating, which are further pronounced in areas of insufficient or sub-standard CP current emanating from the pipeline's CP system.  This produces an area on the pipeline of insufficient CP defense against metal loss aggravated by an exterior corrosive environment."

Cathodic shielding is referenced in a number of the standards listed below.  Newly issued USDOT regulation Title 49 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2009-title49-vol3/pdf/CFR-2009-title49-vol3-sec192-112.pdf 192.112], in the section for ''Additional design requirements for steel pipe using alternative maximum allowable operating pressure'' requires that "The pipe must be protected against external corrosion by a non-shielding coating" (see coatings section on standard).  Also, the NACE SP0169:2007 standard defines shielding in section 2, cautions against the use of materials that create electrical shielding in section 4.2.3, cautions against use of external coatings that create electrical shielding in section 5.1.2.3, and instructs readers to take 'appropriate action' when the effects of electrical shielding of cathodic protection current are detected on an operating pipeline in section 10.9.

[[File:Text cursor blinking.gif|right|frame|A blinking text cursor while typing the word ''Wikipedia''.]]

In computer [[user interface]]s, a '''cursor''' is an indicator used to show the current position for [[user interaction]] on a [[computer monitor]] or other [[display device]] that will respond to input from a text input or [[pointing device]]. The mouse cursor is also called a [[Pointer (user interface)|pointer]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/267139 Mouse Pointer Behaves Erratically If Mouse Pointer Speed Is Set Above Level Five]&lt;/ref&gt; owing to its resemblance in usage to a [[Pointer (rod)|pointing stick]].

== Origin of the term ==

Cursor is Latin for 'runner.' A cursor is the name given to the transparent slide engraved with a hairline that is used for marking a point on a [[slide rule]]. The term was then transferred to computers through analogy.

== Text cursor ==
{{further|Caret navigation}}
{{see also|Text field}}
[[File:Windows Command Prompt.png|thumb|332px|The cursor for the Windows Command Prompt (appearing as an underscore at the end of the line)]]
In most [[command-line interface]]s or [[text editor]]s, the text cursor, also known as a '''[[Caret navigation|caret]]''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/834271/en-us FIX: The caret shape appears as a thick rectangle after you switch from the Korean Input Method Editor (IME) to English in Visual FoxPro 8.0]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[underscore]], a solid rectangle, or a vertical line, which may be flashing or steady, indicating where text will be placed when entered (the '''insertion point'''). In [[text mode]] displays, it was not possible to show a vertical bar between characters to show where the new text would be inserted, so an underscore or block cursor was used instead. In situations where a block was used, the block was usually created by inverting the pixels of the character using the boolean math [[exclusive or]] function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT4197590 U.S. Patent #4197590]&lt;/ref&gt; On [[text editor]]s and [[word processor]]s of modern design on [[bitmap]]ped displays, the vertical bar is typically used instead.

In a typical [[Text editor|text editing application]], the cursor can be moved by pressing various keys. These include the four [[arrow keys]], the [[Page Up and Page Down keys]], the [[Home key]], the [[End key]], and various key combinations involving a [[modifier key]] such as the [[Control key]]. The position of the cursor also may be changed by moving the mouse pointer to a different location in the document and clicking.

The blinking of the text cursor is usually temporarily suspended when it is being moved; otherwise, the cursor may change position when it is not visible, making its location difficult to follow.

Some interfaces use an underscore or thin vertical bar to indicate that the user is in [[insert mode]], a [[Mode (computer interface)|mode]] where text will be [[Insert key|inserted]] in the middle of the existing text, and a larger block to indicate that the user is in [[Insert key|overtype]] mode, where inserted text will overwrite existing text. In this way, a block cursor may be seen as a piece of selected text one character wide, since typing will replace the text "in" the cursor with the new text.

=== Bi-directional text ===

A vertical line text cursor with a small left-pointing or right-pointing appendage are for indicating the direction of text flow on systems that support [[bi-directional text]], and is thus usually known among programmers as a 'bidi cursor'.  In some cases, the cursor may split into two parts, each indicating where left-to-right and right-to-left text would be inserted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://developer.apple.com/legacy/mac/library/documentation/Carbon/Conceptual/ATSUI_Concepts/atsui.pdf ATSUI Programming Guide: Caret Handling], page 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{Anchor|pointer}}Mouse cursor ==
{{Main|Pointer (graphical user interfaces)}}

The pointer or mouse cursor echoes movements of the [[pointing device]], commonly a [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], [[touchpad]] or [[trackball]].
This kind of cursor is used to [[direct manipulation|manipulate]] elements of [[graphical user interface]]s such as menus, [[Button (computing)|button]]s, [[scrollbar]]s or any other [[Widget (GUI)|widget]]. It may be called a "mouse pointer," because the mouse is the dominant type of pointing device used with [[desktop computer]]s.

=== I-beam pointer ===
[[File:I-beam pointer.png|thumb|The I-beam pointer.]]
The I-beam pointer (also called the I-cursor) is a cursor shaped like a [[serif]]ed capital letter "I". The purpose of this cursor is to indicate that the text beneath the cursor can be highlighted, and sometimes inserted or changed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/ibeam.htm ComputerHope.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== 3D cursor ==
[[File:Blender3DCursor.png|thumb|An example of a 3D cursor in a 3D modelling environment (center).]]

The idea of a cursor being used as a marker or insertion point for new data or transformations, such as rotation, can be extended to a [[3D modeling]] environment. [[Blender (software)|Blender]], for instance, uses a 3D cursor to determine where future operations are to take place.

==Description==

In [[electrochemistry]] differential capacitance is a parameter introduced for characterizing [[electrical double layer]]s:

:&lt;math&gt; C = \frac{d \sigma}{ d \Psi}&lt;/math&gt;

where σ is [[surface charge]] and ψ is [[electric surface potential]]
----
[[Capacitance]] is usually defined as the stored charge between two conducting surfaces separated by a dielectric divided by the voltage between the surfaces.&amp;nbsp; Another definition is the rate of change of the stored charge or surface charge (σ) divided by the rate of change of the voltage between the surfaces or the electric surface potential (ψ).&amp;nbsp; The latter is called the "differential capacitance," but usually the stored charge is directly proportional to the voltage, making the capacitances given by the two definitions equal.

This type of differential capacitance may be called "parallel plate capacitance," after the usual form of the capacitor.&amp;nbsp; However, the term is meaningful when applied to any two conducting bodies such as spheres, and not necessarily ones of the same size, for example, the elevated terminals of a Tesla wireless system and the earth.&amp;nbsp; These are widely spaced insulated conducting bodies positioned over a spherically conducting ground plane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teslaradio.com/pages/patents/142352.htm ART OF TRANSMITTING ELECTRICAL ENERGY THROUGH THE NATURAL MEDIUMS, April 17, 1906, Canadian Patent No. 142,352, August 13, 1912.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The differential capacitance between the spheres is obtained by assuming opposite charges ±q on them. . . ." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.ufrj.br/~acmq/papers/papers.html "Capacitance Calculations" by Antonio Carlos M. de Queiroz, Section VIII. CAPACITANCES OF TWO SPHERES.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Another form of differential capacitance refers to single isolated conducting bodies.  It is usually discussed in books under the topic of "electrostatics."&amp;nbsp; This capacitance is best defined as the rate of change of charge stored in the body divided by the rate of change of the potential of the body.&amp;nbsp; The definition of the absolute potential of the body depends on what is selected as a reference.&amp;nbsp; This is sometimes referred to as the "self-capacitance" of a body.&amp;nbsp; If the body is a conducting sphere, the self-capacitance is proportional to its radius, and is roughly 1pF per centimetre of radius.

[[File:LED Flashlights.jpg|alt=C8 style on the left, tube style on the right|thumb|A set of LED flashlights]]
[[File:High power torch.jpg|thumb|alt=Rectangular battery box with large round reflector; carrying handle on top of box|A  spotlight with a large reflector]]

A '''flashlight''' (more often called a '''torch''' outside [[North America]]) is a portable hand-held electric light. The source of the light is usually an [[incandescent light bulb]] (lamp) or [[LED lamp|light-emitting diode]] (LED). A typical flashlight consists of the light source mounted in a reflector, a transparent cover (sometimes combined with a [[Lens (optics)|lens]]) to protect the light source and reflector, a [[battery (electricity)|battery]], and a [[switch]].  These are supported and protected by a case.

The invention of the dry cell and miniature incandescent electric lamps made the first battery-powered flashlights possible around 1899. Today, flashlights use mostly incandescent lamps or light-emitting diodes and run on [[Disposable battery|disposable]] or [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]]. Some are powered by the user turning a crank or shaking the lamp, and some have solar panels to recharge a battery.

In addition to the general-purpose hand-held flashlight, many forms have been adapted for special uses. Head or helmet-mounted flashlights designed for [[miners]] and [[camping|campers]] leave the hands free.  Some flashlights can be used underwater or in flammable atmospheres.  Flashlights are used as a light source when in a place with no power or during [[power outage]]s.

==Etymology==
Early flashlights ran on [[Zinc-carbon battery|zinc-carbon batteries]], which could not provide a steady electric current and required periodic "rest" to continue functioning.&lt;ref name="Nonrechargeable batteries"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brooke Schumm |title=Nonrechargeable Batteries |work=The Electrochemistry Encyclopedia |url=http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-b02-batt-nonr.htm |accessdate=2010-12-13 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022104620/http://electrochem.cwru.edu/encycl/art-b02-batt-nonr.htm |archivedate=2013-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these early flashlights also used energy-inefficient carbon-filament bulbs, "resting" occurred at short intervals. Consequently, they could be used only in brief flashes, hence the common North American name "flashlight".&lt;ref name="flashlightmuseum"/&gt;

== History ==
{{double image|right|Patent 617,592.png|150|1899 Eveready flashlight.jpg|187|Misell's Patent 617,592 line drawings show cross section of flashlight with three cells, reflector and lens |The 1899 flashlight was a fiber tube with brass end caps and bulls-eye glass lens at one end. }}
The first [[dry cell]] battery was invented in 1887. Unlike previous batteries, it used a paste electrolyte instead of a liquid. This was the first battery suitable for portable electrical devices, as it did not spill or break easily and worked in any orientation. The first mass-produced dry cell batteries came in 1896, and the invention of portable electric lights soon followed. Portable hand-held electric lights offered advantages in convenience and safety over (combustion) [[torch]]es, [[candle]]s and [[lantern]]s. The electric lamp was odorless, smokeless, and emitted less heat than combustion-powered lighting. It could be instantly turned on and off, and avoided fire risk.

On January 10, 1899, British inventor David Misell obtained U.S. Patent No. 617,592, [[Assignment (law)|assigned]] to [[Energizer Holdings|American Electrical Novelty and Manufacturing Company]].&lt;ref name="patent617592"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=8mArAAAAEBAJ|title=misell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This "electric device" designed by Misell was powered by [[D_battery|"D" batteries]] laid front to back in a paper tube with the light bulb and a rough brass reflector at the end.&lt;ref name="flashlightmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordcraft.net/flashlight.html|title=Flashlight Museum page one|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117012029/http://www.wordcraft.net/flashlight.html|archivedate=2017-01-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="electropedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mpoweruk.com/history.htm|title=Electropaedia History of Science and Technology, Development of Science, Technology and Inventions|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512173049/http://www.mpoweruk.com/history.htm|archivedate=2011-05-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company donated some of these devices to the [[New York City Police Department|New York City police]], who responded favorably to them.

[[File:USMC flashlights.jpg|thumb|The angle-head flashlight on the left uses an [[Incandescent light bulb|incandescent bulb]], while the adjustable angle-head flashlight on the right uses [[light-emitting diode|LEDs]] to give white, red, blue, and [[infrared]] light]]Carbon-filament bulbs and fairly crude dry cells made early flashlights an expensive novelty with low sales and low manufacturer interest.  Development of the [[Incandescent light bulb#Tungsten bulbs|tungsten-filament lamp]] in 1904, with three times the [[luminous efficacy|efficacy]] of carbon filament types,  and improved batteries, made flashlights more useful and popular. The advantage of instant control, and the absence of flame, meant that hand-held electric lights began to replace combustion-based lamps such as the [[Kerosene lamp|hurricane lantern]].&lt;ref&gt;William T. O'Dea, ''The Social  History of Lighting'', Routledge and Kegan, 1958, pages 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; By 1922 several types were available; the tubular hand-held variety, a lantern style that could be set down for extended use, pocket-size lamps for close work, and large reflector searchlight-type lamps for lighting distant objects. In 1922 there were an estimated 10 million flashlight users in the United States, with annual sales of renewal batteries and flashlights at $20 million, comparable to sales of many line-operated electrical appliances.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene H. Mathews, ''Flashlights and Flashlight Batteries'', in "Transactions of the IES" Volume 17, available on the Internet Archive at https://archive.org/details/illuminatingengi17illu,  March 1922 pages 135-146&lt;/ref&gt;  Flashlights became very popular in China; by the end of the 1930s, 60 companies made flashlights, some selling for as little as one-third the cost of equivalent imported models.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Dikötter, ''Exotic commodities: modern objects and everyday life in China'', Columbia University Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-231-14116-5}} pp. 142-144&lt;/ref&gt; Miniature lamps developed for flashlight and automotive uses became an important sector of the incandescent lamp manufacturing business.

== Incandescent ==
[[File:Lightbulbs for flashlight.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Three miniature bulbs: tubular bulb with screw base, globular bulb with screw base, and prefocus bulb with flange-mount base|Miniature incandescent bulbs for use in flashlights. The tungsten filament bulb was essential to turn the flashlight from a novelty to a useful tool.]]

Incandescent flashlights use [[incandescent light bulb]]s which consists of a glass bulb and a [[tungsten]] filament. The bulbs are under vacuum or filled with [[argon]], [[krypton]] or [[xenon]]. Some high-power incandescent flashlights use a [[halogen lamp]] where the bulb contains a [[halogen]] gas such as [[iodine]] or [[bromine]] to improve the life and efficacy of the bulb. In all but disposable or novelty flashlights, the bulb is user-replaceable; the bulb life may be only a few hours.&lt;ref name=Kreith07/&gt;

The light output of an incandescent lamp in a flashlight varies widely depending on the type of lamp. A miniature keychain lamp produces one or two lumens. A two D-cell flashlight using a common prefocus-style miniature lamp will produce on the order of 15 to 20 [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s of light&lt;ref&gt;Cliff Gomer, ''High Beams'' in ''Popular Mechanics'', November 2003 pages 81-88&lt;/ref&gt;  and a beam of about 200 [[candlepower]]. One [[Maglite|popular make]] of rechargeable focusing flashlight uses a halogen lamp and produces 218 lumens. By comparison, a 60-watt household incandescent lamp will produce about 900 lumens. The [[luminous efficacy]] or lumens produced per watt of input of flashlight bulbs varies over the approximate range of 8 to 22 lumens/watt, depending on the size of the bulb and the fill gas, with halogen-filled 12 volt lamps having the highest efficacy.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

== LED ==
[[File:Sr90 qmini.jpg|thumb|Two LED flashlight extremes: Olight SR90, 2200 lumens (left), Foursevens Mini MLR2, 180 lumens (middle), [[AA battery]] for size comparison (right)]]Powerful white-[[LED lamp|light-emitting diode]]s (LED)s are increasingly replacing incandescent bulbs in practical flashlights.  LEDs existed for decades, mainly as low-power indicator lights. In 1999, [[Philips Lumileds Lighting Company|Lumileds Corporation]] of [[San Jose, California]], introduced the Luxeon LED, a high-power white-light emitter. This made possible LED flashlights with power and running time better than incandescent lights. The first Luxeon LED flashlight was the [[Arc Flashlight|Arc LS]], designed in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} White LEDs in 5&amp;nbsp;mm diameter packages produce only a few lumens each; many units may be grouped together to provide additional light. LEDs, drawing more than 100 [[ampere|milliamperes]] each, simplify the optical design problem of producing a powerful and tightly-controlled beam.

LEDs can be significantly more efficient than incandescent lamps, with white LEDs producing on the order of 100 lumens for every watt, compared to 8-10 lumens per watt of small incandescent bulbs. An LED flashlight will have a longer battery life than an incandescent flashlight with comparable output.&lt;ref name=Kreith07&gt;[[Frank Kreith]], [[Dharendra Yogi Goswami|D.Y. Goswami]], '' Handbook of energy efficiency and renewable energy'', CRC Press 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-8493-1730-9}}, page 12-37&lt;/ref&gt; LEDs are also less fragile than glass lamps. [[LED lamp]]s have different spectra of light compared to incandescent sources, and are made in several ranges of [[color temperature]] and [[color rendering index]]. Since the LED has a long life compared to the usual life of a flashlight, very often it is permanently installed.

LEDs generally must have some kind of [[LED circuit|control]] to limit current through the diode. Flashlights using one or two disposable 1.5 volt cells require a [[boost converter]] to provide the higher voltage required by a white LED, which need around 3.4 volts to function. Flashlights using three or more dry cells may only use a resistor to limit current. Some flashlights electronically regulate the current through the LEDs to stabilize light output as the batteries discharge. LEDs maintain nearly constant [[color temperature]] regardless of input voltage or current, while the color temperature of an incandescent bulb rapidly declines as the battery discharges, becoming redder and less visible.  Regulated LED flashlights may also have user-selectable levels of output appropriate to a task, for example, low light for reading a map and high output for checking a road sign. This would be difficult to do with a single incandescent bulb since efficacy of the lamp drops rapidly at low output.

LED flashlights may consume 1 watt or much more from the battery, producing heat as well as light.  In contrast to tungsten filaments, which must be hot to produce light, both the light output and the life of an LED decrease with temperature.   [[Thermal management of high-power LEDs|Heat dissipation for the LED]] often dictates that small high-power LED flashlights have [[aluminium]] or other high heat conductivity bodies, reflectors and other parts, to dissipate heat; they can become warm during use.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Wessner (ed) '' Partnerships for solid-state lighting: report of a workshop'' National Academies Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0-309-08319-2}} page 54&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Keychain LED flashlight.jpg|thumb|left|Miniature LED flashlight on a key chain, powered by lithium primary coin batteries.]]Light output from LED flashlights varies even more widely than for incandescent lights. "Keychain" type lamps operating on [[button cell|button batteries]], or lights using a single 5&amp;nbsp;mm LED, may only produce a couple of lumens. Even a small LED flashlight operating on an AA cell but equipped with a LED can emit 100 lumens. The most powerful LED flashlights produce more than 32,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imalent.com/Item/Show.asp?m=2&amp;d=205|title=IMALENT LED flashlight|website=www.imalent.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; lumens and may use multiple LEDs.

LEDs are highly efficient at producing colored light compared with incandescent lamps and filters. An LED flashlight may contain different LEDs for white and colored light, selectable by the user for different purposes. Colored LED flashlights are used for signalling, special inspection tasks, forensic examination, or to track the blood trail of wounded game animals. A flashlight may have a red LED intended to preserve dark [[Adaptation (eye)|adaptation]] of vision.  [[Ultraviolet]] LEDs may be used for inspection lights, for example, detecting fluorescent dyes added to air conditioning systems to detect leakage, examining paper [[currency]], or checking UV-fluorescing marks on laundry or event ticket holders. Infrared LEDs can be used for illuminators for night vision systems. LED flashlights may be specified to be compatible with [[night vision device]]s.
[[File:Flashlight clear.JPG|thumb|right|Multiple 5 mm LEDs may be used in small flashlights.]]

== HID ==
A less common type of flashlight uses a [[High Intensity Discharge]] (HID) lamp as the light source. An HID gas discharge lamp uses a mixture of [[metal halide]] salts and [[argon]] as a filler. HID lamps produce more light than an incandescent flashlight using the same amount of electricity. The lamp will last longer and is more shock resistant than a regular incandescent bulb, since it lacks the relatively fragile electrical filament found in incandescent bulbs. However, they are much more expensive, due to the [[Ballast (electrical)|ballast]] circuit required to start and operate the lamp. An HID lamp requires a short warm-up time before it reaches full output.
A typical HID flashlight would have a 35 watt lamp and produce more than 3,000 lumens.

==Accessories==
Certain accessories for a flashlight allow the color of the light to be altered or allow light to be dispersed differently. Translucent colored plastic cones slipped over the lens of a flashlight increase the visibility when looking at the side of the light. Such [[marshalling wands]] are frequently used for directing automobiles or aircraft at night.  Colored lenses placed over the end of the flashlight are used for signalling, for example, in railway yards.  Colored light is occasionally useful for hunters tracking wounded game after dusk, or for forensic examination of an area. A red filter helps preserve night vision after the flashlight is turned off, and can be useful to observe animals (such as nesting [[Loggerhead sea turtle]]s) without disturbing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://tacticalflashlightguide.com/how-to-choose-a-flashlight/| title= Flashlight Guide }} Wednesday, 3 October 2018 &lt;/ref&gt; 

Detachable light guides, consisting of rigid bent plastic rods or semi-rigid or flexible tubes containing optical fibers, are available for some flashlights for inspection inside tanks, or within walls or structures; when not required the light guide can be removed and the light used for other purposes.

== Formats and specialized designs ==
[[File:Halogenlight.JPG|thumb|left|A medical [[Halogen lamp|halogen penlight]] to observe [[pupillary light reflex]]]]
[[File:LED-headlamp.jpg|thumb|An LED headlamp]]
A penlight is a small, [[pen]]-sized flashlight, often containing two [[AA battery|AA batteries]] or [[AAA battery|AAA batteries]]. In some types the incandescent light bulb has an integral [[lens (optics)|lens]] that focuses the light, so no reflector is built into the penlight. Others use incandescent bulbs mounted in reflectors.  [[LED]] penlights are becoming increasingly common. Low-cost units may be disposable with no provision to replace batteries or bulbs, and are sometimes imprinted with advertising for promotional purposes.

A [[Headlamp (outdoor)|headlamp]] is designed to be worn on the head, often having separate lamp and battery components. The battery pack may be attached at the back of the head or in a pocket to improve balance. Headlamps leave the user's hands free. A headlamp can be clipped to the brim of a hat, or built to mount on a [[hard hat]], instead of using straps; other types resemble eyeglass frames. Similar to the headlamp, an angle-head flashlight emits light perpendicular to the length of the battery tube; it can be clipped to a headband, belt, or webbing or set on a flat surface. Some types allow the user to adjust the angle of the head. The [[Fulton MX991/U Flashlight]] was an angle-head flashlight issued to US military personnel; similar style lights remain popular.

[[File:Non-sparking flashlight.JPG|thumb|Non-incendive flashlight for use when inspecting areas full of flammable gas.]]

[[Tactical light]]s are sometimes mounted to a [[handgun]] or [[rifle]]. They allow momentary illumination of a target. They are small enough to be easily [[Weaver rail mount|rail-mounted]] to a gun barrel. Tactical lights must withstand the impact of recoil, and must be easily controlled while holding the weapon.

[[File:Diving-torch.jpg|thumb|left|One style of diver's lamp.]]

Although most flashlights are designed for user replacement of the batteries and the bulb as needed, fully sealed [[disposable]] flashlights, such as inexpensive [[keyring]] lights, are made. When the batteries are depleted or the bulb fails, the entire product is discarded.

Diving lamps must be watertight under pressure and are used for [[night diving]] and [[Scuba diving#Light underwater|supplemental illumination]] where surface light cannot reach. The battery compartment of a dive lamp may have a catalyst to recombine any hydrogen gas emitted from the battery, since gas cannot be vented in use.

People working in [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous areas]] with significant concentrations of flammable gases or dusts, such as mines, engine rooms of ships, chemical plants or [[grain elevator]]s, use "non-incendive", "intrinsically safe" or "explosion proof"  flashlights constructed so that any spark in the flashlight is not likely to set off an explosion outside the light. The flashlight may require approval by an authority for the particular service and particular gases or dusts expected. The external temperature rise of the flashlight must not exceed the [[Autoignition temperature|autoignition]] point of the gas, so substitution of more powerful lamps or batteries may void the approval.

[[File:Goose neck torch.jpg|thumb|left|Inspection light with flexible gooseneck mounting for lamp.]]
[[File:Auroralighter.JPG|thumb|Flashlight in the shape of a gun (mid 20th century) from the permanent collection of the [[Museo del Objeto del Objeto]].]]

Inspection flashlights have permanently mounted light guides containing optical fibers or plastic rods. Another style has a lamp mounted at the end of a flexible cable, or a semi-rigid or articulated probe. Such lamps are used for inspection inside tanks, or inside structures such as aircraft. Where used for inspecting the interior of tanks containing flammable liquids, the inspection lights may also be rated as flame-proof (explosion-proof) so that they cannot ignite liquids or vapors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isddc.dot.gov/OLPFiles/FAA/010171.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111195440/http://isddc.dot.gov/OLPFiles/FAA/010171.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-11 |df= }} U.S. Department of Transportation ''Advisory Circular 43-204 Visual Inspection for Aircraft'', 1997,  pages 96-100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otoscope]]s and [[ophthalmoscope]]s are medical instruments that combine a hand-held light source and magnifying lenses for examination of the ear canal and eyes, respectively.

Aboard naval ships, battle lanterns may be used as emergency portable lighting. Installed in major compartments of the ship, a battle lantern can be detached from its mounting and used as portable lighting in the event primary lighting is out of service. Battle lanterns may use either incandescent or LED lamps, and may have either disposable primary or rechargeable batteries.  &lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/Military_OBGYN/Textbook/MilitaryOrganizations/BoxerTour/BattleLantern.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170326230242/http://www.brooksidepress.org/Products/Military_OBGYN/Textbook/MilitaryOrganizations/BoxerTour/BattleLantern.htm |archivedate=2017-03-26 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Many flashlights are cylindrical in design, with the lamp assembly attached to one end. However, early designs came in a variety of other shapes. Some resembled [[candlestick]]s, with a bulb mounted at the top of a battery tube fixed to a flat base, with a handle. Many resembled [[lantern]]s, consisting of a battery box with a handle and the lamp and reflector attached to the front. Electric lanterns are used for lighting the broad area immediately around the lantern, as opposed to forming a narrow beam; they can be set down on a level surface or attached to supports. Some electric lanterns use miniature [[fluorescent lamp]]s for higher efficacy than incandescent bulbs.  Portable hand-held electric spotlights can provide larger reflectors and lamps, and more powerful [[Lantern battery|batteries]] than tubular flashlights meant to fit in a pocket.

Multifunction portable devices may include a flashlight as one of their features; for example, a portable radio/flashlight combination. Many [[smartphone]]s have a button or software application available to turn up their screen backlights to full intensity, or to switch on the camera flash or video light, providing a "flashlight" function.

As well as utilitarian flashlights, novelty, toy and ornamental portable electric lights have been made in a myriad of shapes; in the 1890s, one of the earliest portable battery light applications was a type of novelty porcelain [[tie pin]] with a concealed bulb and battery.

== Power sources ==

===Batteries===
The most common power source for flashlights is the [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. [[Primary battery]] ([[disposable]])  types used in flashlights include  [[button cell]]s, [[carbon zinc battery|carbon-zinc batteries]] in both regular and heavy duty types, [[Alkaline battery|alkaline]], and [[Lithium battery|lithium]].

Secondary, rechargeable, types include [[lead-acid battery|lead acid batteries]], [[Nickel metal hydride battery|NiMH]], [[Nickel-cadmium battery|NiCd]] batteries and [[lithium ion battery|lithium ion batteries]]. The choice of batteries will play a determining role in the size, weight, run time, and shape of the flashlight. Flashlight users may prefer a common battery type to simplify replacement.

Primary cells are most economical for infrequent use. Some types of lithium primary cell can be stored for years with less risk of leakage compared with zinc-type batteries. Long storage life is useful where flashlights are required only in emergencies. Lithium primary batteries are also useful at lower temperatures than zinc batteries, all of which have water-based electrolytes. Lithium primary batteries have a lower [[internal resistance]] than zinc primary batteries and so are more efficient in high-drain flashlights.

Flashlights used for extended periods every day may be more economically operated on rechargeable (secondary) batteries. Flashlights designed for rechargeable batteries may  allow charging without removing the batteries; for example, a light kept in a vehicle may be trickle-charged and always ready when needed. Some rechargeable flashlights have indicators for the state of charge of the battery. Power-failure lights are designed to keep their batteries charged from a wall plug and to automatically turn on after an AC power failure; the power-failure light can be removed from the wall socket and used as a portable flashlight. [[Solar powered flashlight]]s use energy from a [[solar cell]] to charge an on-board battery for later use.

=== Mechanical power ===
{{Main article|Mechanically powered flashlight}}
One type of mechanically powered flashlight has a winding crank and spring connected to a small [[electrical generator]] (dynamo).  Some types use the dynamo to charge a capacitor or battery, while others only light while the dynamo is moving. Others generate electricity using [[electromagnetic induction]]. They use a strong permanent [[magnet]] that can freely slide up and down a tube, passing through a coil of wire as it does. Shaking the flashlight will charge a [[capacitor]] or a rechargeable [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] that supplies current to a light source.  Such flashlights can be useful during an emergency, when utility power and batteries may not be available. Dynamo-powered flashlights were popular during the Second World War since replacement batteries were difficult to find.

===Capacitor===
At least one manufacturer makes a rechargeable flashlight that uses a [[supercapacitor]] to store energy.&lt;ref&gt;Francois Beguin, Elzbieta Frackowiak (ed) ,"Supercapacitors: Materials, Systems and Applications'' Wiley 2013, {{ISBN|3527646698}}, p. 515&lt;/ref&gt;  The capacitor can be recharged more rapidly than a battery and can be recharged many times without loss of capacity; however, the running time is limited by the relative bulk of capacitors compared to electrochemical batteries.

==Reflectors and lenses==
[[File:Reflectors.jpg|thumb|350px|Dive flashlight with different reflectors and collimator for LED XHP70.2]]
A reflector with an approximately [[parabola|parabolic]] shape concentrates the light emitted by the bulb into a directed beam.  Some flashlights allow the user to adjust the relative position of the lamp and reflector, giving a variable-focus effect from a wide floodlight to a narrow beam.  Reflectors may be made of polished metal, or glass or plastic with an aluminized reflective finish. Some manufacturers use a pebbled or "orange peel", instead of a smooth, reflector, to improve the uniformity of the light beam emitted. Where multiple LEDs are used, each one may be put in its own parabolic reflector. Flashlights using a "[[total internal reflection]]" assembly have a transparent optical element (light pipe) to guide light from the source into a beam; no reflector surface is required. For a given size of light source, a larger reflector or lens allows a tighter beam to be produced, while capturing the same fraction of the emitted light.

The reflector may have a flat transparent cover to keep out dirt and moisture, but some designs have a plastic or glass "bulls-eye" lens to form a concentrated beam. The lens or reflector cover must resist impacts and the heat of the lamp, and must not lose too much of the transmitted light to reflection or absorption. Very small flashlights may not have a reflector or lens separate from the lamp. Some types of penlight bulbs or small LEDs  have a built-in lens.

A reflector forms a narrow beam called the "throw", while light emitted forward misses the reflector and forms a wide flood or "spill" of light.  Because LEDs emit most light in a hemisphere, lens lights with the LED facing forward or reflector lights with it facing backwards radiate less spill.  Variable focus "zoom" or "flood to throw" lights may move the reflector or lens or they may move the emitter; moving the emitter presents the designer with the problem of maintaining heat dissipation for the LED.

The original 1890s flashlights used a metal ring around the fiber body of the flashlight as one contact of a [[switch]], and the second contact was a movable metal loop that could be flipped down to touch the ring, completing the circuit. A wide variety of mechanical switch designs using slide switches, rocker switches, or side-mounted or end-mounted pushbuttons have been used in flashlights. A common combination is a slide switch that allows the light to be left on for an extended time, combined with a momentary button for intermittent use or signalling. (On earlier models, the button was a switch and the slider simply locked the button down.) Since voltages and currents are low, switch design is limited only by the available space and desired cost of production. Switches may be covered with a flexible rubber boot to exclude dirt and moisture.  Another common type of switch relies on twisting the head of the light. Weapon-mounted lights may have remote switches for convenience in operation.

Electronic controls allow the user to select variable output levels or different operating modes such as pre-programmed flashing beacon or strobe modes. Electronic controls may be operated by buttons, sliders, magnets, rotating heads, or rotating control rings.  Some models of flashlight include an acceleration sensor to allow them  to respond to shaking, or to select modes based on direction the light is held at switch on.  At least one manufacturer allows user programming of the features of the flashlight through a [[USB]] port. An electronic control may also provide an indication of remaining battery capacity, or automatic step-down of brightness as the battery nears full discharge.

==Materials==
Early flashlights used [[Vulcanized fibre|vulcanized fiber]] or hard rubber tubes with metal end caps. Many other materials including drawn steel, plated brass, copper, silver, even wood and leather have been used.  Modern flashlights are generally made of plastic or aluminum. Plastics range from low-cost [[polystyrene]] and [[polyethylene]] to more complex mixtures of [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] or glass-reinforced epoxies.  Some manufacturers have proprietary plastic formulations for their products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energizerlightingproducts.com/technology/materials/Pages/materials.aspx Energizer Flashlight, Headlight and Handheld Light Materials] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129200549/http://www.energizerlightingproducts.com/technology/materials/Pages/materials.aspx |date=2011-11-29 }}. Energizerlightingproducts.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt; A desirable plastic for manufacturing flashlights allows for ease of molding and adequate mechanical properties of the finished flashlight case.  Aluminum, either plain, painted or [[anodization|anodized]], is a popular choice.  It is electrically conductive, can be easily machined, and dissipates heat well. Several standard alloys of aluminum are used. Other metals include [[copper]], [[stainless steel]], and [[titanium]], which can be polished to provide a decorative finish. Zinc can be die-cast into intricate shapes.  Magnesium and its alloys provide strength and heat dissipation similar to aluminum with less weight, but they corrode easily.

Metals may be [[Deep drawing|drawn]] into a tubular shape, or tubular extruded stock can be machined to add threads for the head and tail cap, knurling for grip, and decorative and functional flats or holes in the body. LED flashlights may have cooling fins machined into their metal cases.  Plastics are often [[injection molding|injection molded]] into nearly final shape, requiring only a few more process steps to complete assembly.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Bralla (ed.), ''Handbook of Manufacturing Processes'', Industrial Press Inc., 2007 {{ISBN|0-831 1-3179-9}}  pg. 673&lt;/ref&gt;
Metal cases provide better heat dissipation for the LED, but plastics are not electrically conductive and may resist corrosion and wear.

==Ratings and standards==

===Safety regulations===
Industrial, marine, public safety and military organizations develop specifications for flashlights in specialized roles. Typically, light output, overall dimensions, battery compatibility and durability are required to meet minimum limits. Flashlights may be tested for impact resistance, water and chemical resistance, and for the life span of the control switch.

Flashlights intended for use in [[Electrical equipment in hazardous areas|hazardous areas]] with flammable gas or dust are tested to ensure they cannot set off an explosion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energizerlightingproducts.com/technology/safety-approvals-testing/Pages/ansistandards.aspx Energizer Lighting Products Safety Approvals and Testing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102154259/http://www.energizerlightingproducts.com/technology/safety-approvals-testing/Pages/ansistandards.aspx |date=2011-11-02 }}. Energizerlightingproducts.com (2003-07-01). Retrieved on 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt; Flashlights approved for flammable gas areas will have markings indicating the approving agency ([[Mine Safety and Health Administration|MSHA]], [[ATEX]], [[Underwriters Laboratories|UL]] etc.) and symbols for the conditions that were tested. Flashlights for hazardous areas may be designed to automatically disconnect the lamp if the bulb is broken, to prevent ignition of flammable gas.&lt;ref&gt;Underwriter's Laboratories Standard UL 783&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations for ships and aircraft will specify the number and general properties of flashlights included as part of the standard safety equipment of the vessel. Flashlights for small boats may be required to be waterproof and to float.  Uniformed services may issue particular models of flashlight, or may only provide minimum performance standards for the member to purchase his or her own flashlights.

===Performance standards===
The United States Army former standard MIL-F-3747E described the performance standard for plastic flashlights using two or three D cell dry batteries, in either straight or angle form, and in standard, explosion-proof, heat-resistant, traffic direction, and inspection types. The standard described only incandescent lamp flashlights and was withdrawn in 1996.

In the United States, [[ANSI]] in 2009 published ''FL1 Flashlight basic performance standard''. This voluntary standard defines test procedures and conditions for total light output, beam intensity, working distance, impact and water resistance, and battery running time to 10% of initial light output.  The FL1 standard gives definitions for terms used in marketing flashlights, with the intention of allowing the consumer to compare products tested to the standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nema.org/stds/complimentary-docs/upload/FL%201%202009%20final.pdf Introduction and table of contents to ANSI FL1 retrieved 2011 Oct 17] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115134858/http://www.nema.org/stds/complimentary-docs/upload/FL%201%202009%20final.pdf |date=2011-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard recommends particular graphic symbols and wording for the product package, so that the consumer can identify products tested to the standard. Testing may be carried out by the manufacturer itself or by a third-party test laboratory.

The FL1 standard requires measurements reported on the packaging to be made with the type of batteries packaged with the flashlight, or with an identified type of battery. Initial light output is measured with an [[integrating sphere]] photometer, 30 seconds after the light is switched on with fresh (or newly charged) batteries. The total light emitted is reported in [[Lumen (unit)|lumen]]s. [[Luminous intensity]] is determined by measuring the brightest spot in the beam produced by the flashlight, in [[candela]]s. Since this is a measure of all the light emitted in a [[solid angle]] (the "cone" of light in a particular direction), the beam intensity is independent of distance.

The working distance is defined as the distance at which the maximum light falling on a surface ([[illuminance]]) would fall to 0.25 [[lux]]. This is comparable to a full moon on a clear night. The distance is calculated from the square root of (the beam intensity in candelas divided by 0.25 lux); for example, a beam intensity of 1000 candelas produces a working range rating of the square root of (1000/0.25), or 63 meters. The result is reported in meters or feet. The working distance is from the point of view of the user of the flashlight. A light directly pointed at an observer may be visible against a dark background for many times this distance, especially if the observer has night-vision equipment.

Run time is measured using the supplied or specified batteries and letting the light run until the intensity of the beam has dropped to 10% of the value 30 seconds after switching on.  The standard does not evaluate the behavior of the flashlight output during run time. A regulated flashlight may run at only a slowly declining output and then abruptly cut off, but unregulated types may have steeply-declining light output after only a short time. Manufacturers of headlamps may use a different standard which rates run times until light output falls to 1 lux at 2 meters distance; this value is not comparable to the FL 1 runtime measurement.

Impact resistance is measured by dropping the flashlight in six different orientations and observing that it still functions and has no large cracks or breaks in it; the height used in the test is reported. Water resistance, if specified, is evaluated after impact testing; no water is to be visible inside the unit and it must remain functional. Ratings are given in [[IP Code]] terms, where jet spray corresponds to IP X6, brief immersion to IPX7, 30 minutes immersion at 1 meter or more is IP X8; (the depth is reported if greater than 1 meter). An IP X8 rating by FL1 does not imply that the lamp is suitable for use as a diver's light since the test protocol examines function of the light only after immersion, not during immersion.&lt;ref&gt;Switches or focus adjustments may not work properly while the flashlight is under external pressure, even if no water gets into the case.&lt;/ref&gt;

The consumer must decide how well the ANSI test conditions match their requirements, but all manufacturers testing to the FL1 standard can be compared on a uniform basis. The light measurements are more directly related to the use of flashlights than is the nominal power input to the lamp (watts), since different LED and incandescent lamp types vary widely in the [[luminous efficacy|amount of light produced per watt]]. Even the same LED or lamp in different optical systems will show different beam characteristics. The visibility of objects depends on many factors as well as the amount of light emitted by the flashlight.

ANSI standard FL1 does not specify measurements of the [[beam diameter|beam width angle]] but the candela intensity and total lumen ratings can be used by the consumer to assess the beam characteristics. Where two flashlights have similar total light (lumen) measures, the unit with the higher candela rating produces a more concentrated beam of light, suitable for lighting distant objects; it will also have a higher working distance. If two lights have similar candela ratings, the light with higher lumen value will produce a wider beam and will light a wider area overall. A beam width (containing most of the power of the beam, or "hot spot") of a few degrees corresponds to a spot light, useful for searching for distant objects; beam widths of 20 degrees or more are described as flood lights, suitable for lighting a wide nearby area. Typically even a flashlight beam with a small hot spot will have some light visible as "spill" around the spot.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2374">'''FotoFinder''' is a worldwide brand for medical imaging systems. The German company FotoFinder Systems GmbH was founded in 1991 and has developed imaging solutions for the early detection of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer as well as hair disorders diagnostics (TrichoLAB) and psoriasis assessment.

FotoFinder methods for early skin cancer diagnosis:

# Digital [[dermatoscopy|dermoscopy]] (also called digital epiluminescence microscopy) for monitoring suspicious nevi over time. Through Mole Mapping, melanoma can be detected and removed at a stage where the chances of healing are high [http://www.dermoscopy.org/faq.asp].
# Mole analysis according to [[pattern recognition]] algorithms. Therefore the “Moleanalyzer” expert system has been developed in cooperation with the Dermatology Department of the University Hospital of Tuebingen in Germany [http://www.hautklinik-tuebingen.de]. It gives doctors a [[second opinion (medicine)|second opinion]] about suspicious moles.
# Total Body Mapping for monitoring the entire skin of patients with dysplastic nevus syndrome. All parts of the body are photographed from head to toe for a complete, systematic and standardized documentation.
# Analysis of the entire skin to detect new and changed moles. Therefore the “Bodyscan pro” expert system compares two total body photos with the help of complex algorithms. The first program version was the result of cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Biomedical Engineering [http://www.ibmt.fraunhofer.de].
# With the help of fluorescence diagnostics, non-melanoma skin cancer and precancerous stages such as [[actinic keratosis|actinic keratoses]] and [[basal cell carcinoma]] can be delineated from healthy skin. Therefore a [[photosensitizer]] is applied which selectively concentrates in the tumor cells. Illuminated with ultraviolet light, the tumor is entirely visualized.

Each of the presented methods is a pillar in the early detection of skin cancer. In an overall view, the diagnostic accuracy will be improved with the use of special cameras, expert software and scientific-based analysis systems.

Recommendation '''G.9963''' is a [[home networking]] standard under development at [[ITU-T|the International Telecommunication Union standards sector, the ITU-T]].

It was begun in 2010 by [[ITU-T]] to add [[MIMO|multiple-input and multiple-output]] (known as MIMO) capabilities to the [[G.hn]] standard originally defined in Recommendation G.9960. The standard is also known as "G.hn-mimo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = G.9963 (ex G.hn-MIMO) |work= ITU-T Work Programme |url= http://www.itu.int/itu-t/workprog/wp_item.aspx?isn=7726  |accessdate= July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the family of [[G.hn]] standards, G.9963 was endorsed by the HomeGrid Forum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=  HomeGrid Forum Endorses Draft ITU-T MIMO Specification for Extending G.hn |author= Sheila Lashford  |publisher= HomeGrid Forum |url= http://www.homegridforum.org/content/pages.php?pg=news_press_releases_item&amp;rec_id=95 |date= May 3, 2011 |accessdate= July 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TOVIM14"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben-Tovim, Erez|date=February 2014|title=ITU G.hn - Broadband Home Networking|booktitle=MIMO Power Line Communications: Narrow and Broadband Standards, EMC, and Advanced Processing|publisher=CRC Press|series=Devices, Circuits, and Systems|editor1=Berger, Lars T.|editor2= Schwager, Andreas|editor3= Pagani, Pascal |editor4=Schneider, Daniel M|chapter=12|isbn=9781466557529|url=http://www.crcnetbase.com/doi/abs/10.1201/b16540-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The U.S. Air Force employed a two-phase competitive bid acquisition process for the GPS Block IIIF satellites.

=== Phase One: Production Feasibility Assessment === 

On May 5, 2016, the U.S. Air Force awarded three Phase One Production Readiness Feasibility Assessment contracts for GPS III Space Vehicles (SV's) 11+, one each to Boeing Network and Space Systems, Lockheed Martin Space Systems Company, and Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems.&lt;ref name="production_readiness_feasability_assessment" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.losangeles.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/734637/smc-releases-rfp-for-gps-iii-space-vehicles-11-phase-1-production-readiness-fea/ |title=SMC releases RFP for GPS III Space Vehicles 11+ Phase 1 Production Readiness Feasibility Assessment |author=U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center, Public Affairs |date=January 8, 2016 |access-date=December 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phase one contracts were worth up to six million dollars each.&lt;ref name="insidegnss_20170427" /&gt; During the phase one effort, both Boeing and Northrop Grumman successfully demonstrated working navigation payloads.&lt;ref name="bloomberg_20171102"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-11-02/lockheed-s-latest-delays-on-satellites-may-open-door-to-boeing |title=Air Force Plans $10 Billion GPS III Contest Amid Lockheed Delays |last=Capaccio |first=Anthony |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |website=Bloomberg |date=November 2, 2017 |access-date=December 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phase Two: Satellite Manufacturing ===

On April 19, 2017, the US Air Force Space Command announced the start of the second phase of its acquisition strategy with the publication of a special notice for an "Industry Day" for companies planning on bidding for the contract to manufacture GPS III vehicles 11+.&lt;ref name="insidegnss_20170427"&gt;{{cite web |title=Door Open to New Bidders as Air Force Moves Closer to GPS III Buy |url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/5448 |last=Divis |first=Dee Ann |date=April 27, 2017|accessdate=May 3, 2017 |website=InsideGNSS |publisher=Gibbons Media &amp; Research LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Industry Day event, the Air Force shared the tentative acquisition strategy which it will use to evaluate proposals, then solicited feedback from potential bidders.

In July 2017, the Deputy Director of the U.S. Air Force GPS Directorate stated the acquisition strategy for GPS Block IIIF would be to award the manufacturing contracts for all 22 Block IIIF satellites to the same contractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/5546 |title=GPS Official: Expect One Follow-on GPS III Contractor, Tech Insertion Points |date=July 17, 2017 |accessdate=August 15, 2017 |publisher=Gibbons Media &amp; Research LLC |website=InsideGNSS.com |last=Divis |first=Dee Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, the Deputy Director of the US Air Force's GPS Directorate announced the name of the second tranche of GPS III satellites was "GPS Block IIIF."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insidegnss.com/node/5695 |title=Next Tranche of GPS Satellites to be called GPS IIIFs |last=Divis |first=Dee Ann |date=November 22, 2017 |access-date=December 1, 2017 |website=InsideGNSS |publisher=Gibbons Media &amp; Research LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bidding ====

While the Air Force originally expected to publish the formal Request For Proposals (RFP) for GPS Block IIIF production in September 2017, it was not released until February 13, 2018.&lt;ref name="gps_iiif_rfp_release" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gps_iii_rfp_delay"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/5746 |title=Industry Awaits GPS III RFP As Delays Mount |last=Divis |first=Dee Ann |date=January 16, 2018 |access-date=January 18, 2018 |publisher=Gibbons Media &amp; Research LLC |website=InsideGNSS}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RFP was for a firm-fixed price (FFP) contract for a single company to manufacture all 22 space vehicles.&lt;ref name="gps_iiif_rfp_release" /&gt; 

All three participants from phase one (Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Northrop Grumman) were believed to be likely to submit proposals.&lt;ref name="insidegnss_20170427" /&gt;

The government held a pre-proposal conference in El Segundo, CA to be held on March 15, 2018 for potential bidders to ask the Air Force questions about the solicitation.&lt;ref name="gps_iiif_rfp_release" /&gt;

The submission deadline for proposals was 12:00pm Pacific Daylight Time on April 16, 2018.&lt;ref name="gps_iiif_rfp_release" /&gt;

The bid status of companies who participated in phase one, in alphabetical order:

* Boeing: declined to submit a proposal&lt;ref name="boeing_no_bid"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insidegnss.com/node/5841 |title=Boeing Declines to Bid on GPS III |last=Devis |first=Dee Ann |website=InsideGNSS |publisher=Gibbons Media &amp; Research LLC |date=April 18, 2018 |access-date=April 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''gas combustion retort process''' (also referred as '''gas-combustion retorting process''') was an above-ground [[retorting]] technology for [[shale oil extraction]]. It was a predecessor of the [[Paraho process|Paraho]] and [[Petrosix]] processes, and modern directly heated oil shale retorting technologies in general.&lt;ref name=assessment&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The gas combustion retort process was developed by the [[United States Bureau of Mines]] at the end of the 1940s. The first gas combustion retort, designed by [[Cameron Engineers]], went into operation in 1949 and it was located in the United States Bureau of Mines' Oil Shale Experiment Station at Anvil Point in [[Rifle, Colorado]].  The Bureau of Mines tested this process in three retorts with capacity of 6, 10, and 25&amp;nbsp;[[tonne|ton]] of [[oil shale]] per day accordingly.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;  The consortium of [[Mobil]], [[Humble Oil]], [[Continental Oil]], Pan American Oil, [[Phillips Petroleum Company]], and [[Sinclair Oil]] evaluated and improved this technology between 1964 and 1968.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;

==Technology==
The gas combustion retort process is classified as an internal combustion technology. For the oil shale pyrolysis it uses a vertical vessel retort.&lt;ref name=lee&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Crushed raw oil shale is fed into the top of the retort, and it moves downward by gravity. When moving downward, oil shale is heated by the rising recycled gases, which cause decomposition of the rock. Recycled gases enter the retort from the bottom. Gases are heated on the lower part of retort by descended [[spent shale]]. On their way up, gases move through the combustion zone, where air and dilution gases are injected causing combustion of gases and carbonaceous residue of spent shale ([[char]]). The heat from combustion brings the temperature in the retorting zone above of the burning zone to the necessary level for retorting.  The incoming raw oil shale cool oil vapors and gases, which then leave the top of the retort as a mist.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=lee/&gt;&lt;ref name=handbook&gt;

The main advantage of this process was that it does not require cooling water, which made it suitable for using  in the semi-arid regions.&lt;ref name=assessment/&gt;&lt;ref name=factsheet/&gt;

'''GeoSmart (NZ) Ltd''' is a provider of location-based services, digital mapping data and images for the Oceania area, notably [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapscape.eu/index.php?option=com_weblinks&amp;catid=9&amp;Itemid=8|title=Content Suppliers|publisher=[[Mapscape BV]]|accessdate=2008-08-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713052849/http://www.mapscape.eu/index.php?option=com_weblinks&amp;catid=9&amp;Itemid=8|archivedate=2011-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company is one of only a handful of global companies producing digital maps for use in [[GPS]] applications.  

Companies such as [[TomTom]] and [[Navman]], use mapping data from GeoSmart on their popular handheld GPS devices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10470546|title=Dutch GPS maker out to navigate NZ market|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=Peter Griffin|date=2007-10-18|accessdate=2008-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10344997|title=Our turn for new Navman|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=Peter Griffin|date=2007-10-18|accessdate=2005-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do motor manufacturers such as [[BMW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BMW points NZ in the right direction|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=3576579|date=2004-07-06|accessdate=2008-08-12|author=Paul Brislen|work=The New Zealand Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company also provides mapping data via [[web service]]s, with applications such as a website that allows users to send custom invitations that include mapping directions for guests &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=5&amp;objectid=10415265|title=Geosmart gets ready to party|date=2006-12-14|accessdate=2008-08-12|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|author=Peter Griffin}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as providing the mapping interface on [[New Zealand Automobile Association]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10355323|title=Online service allows travellers to customise maps |date=2005-11-15|accessdate=2008-08-12|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, GeoSmart launched the RAPIDcV mapping car, which is an ongoing program to redrive all of New Zealand. This is to  enhance the car navigation database used by brands including Navman, TomTom, Nav N Go, Siemens VDO and Horizon.{{Fact|date=April 2009}} The RAPIDcV (Road attributes, [[point of interest|points of interest]], imagery data capture vehicle) uses technology to capture the road centreline of all of New Zealand's roads to an accuracy of 0.15 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GeoSmart's RAPIDcV vehicle sets mapping in motion
|url=http://www.geosmart.co.nz/news/newsletters/_details/id_94/welcome_to_smartnews.html?Return=news%2Fnewsletters}}&lt;/ref&gt; It does this with a number of technologies including [[Inertial navigation system|inertial]] measurement unit (IMU) that uses [[gyroscope]]s and [[accelerometer]]s. This technology compensates for situations where the traditional [[differential GPS]] accuracy is lost when the satellite signal is poor, such as behind volcanic hill shadows, dense forest canopies and high rise urban areas.  It has a number of cameras on board capturing lane information, street signs, turn restrictions and points of interest to enhance and keep up to date GeoSmart's car navigation and web mapping products. It is also taking a 360 degree [[Panoramic photography|panoramic image]] every 50 metres. In order to support truck navigation as well as multi mode navigation it is collecting information on the incline and [[Cant (road/rail)|camber]] of each corner, a feature which is used for truck safety warnings in [[fleet management system]]s.{{Fact|date=April 2009}}

'''HASA''' (highly accelerated stress audit) is a proven test method developed to find [[manufacturing]]/[[production (economics)|production]] process induced defects in [[electronics]] and electro-mechanical assemblies before those products are released to market. HASA is a form of HASS – a powerful testing tool for improving product reliability, reducing warranty costs and increasing customer satisfaction.

Since HASS levels are more aggressive than conventional screening tools, a POS procedure is used to establish the effectiveness in revealing production induced defects. A POS is vital to determine that the HASS stresses are capable of revealing production defects, but not so extreme as to remove significant life from the test item. Instituting HASS to screen the product is an excellent tool to maintain a high level of robustness and it will reduce the test time required to screen a product resulting in long term savings. Ongoing HASS screening assures that any weak [[Electronic component|components]] or manufacturing process degradations are quickly detected and corrected. HASS is not intended to be a rigid process that has an endpoint. It is a dynamic process that may need modification or adjustment over the life of the product.

HASS aids in the detection of early life failures. HASA's primary purpose is to monitor manufacturing and prevent any defects from being introduced during the process. A carefully determined HASA sampling plan must be designed that will quickly signal when process quality has been degraded.

'''Ice drilling''' allows scientists studying [[glacier]]s and [[ice sheet]]s to gain access to what is beneath the ice, to take measurements along the interior of the ice, and to retrieve samples.  Instruments can be placed in the drilled holes to record temperature, pressure, speed, direction of movement, and for other scientific research, such as [[neutrino]] detection.

Many different methods have been used since 1840, when the first scientific ice drilling expedition attempted to drill through the [[Unteraargletscher]] in the [[Alps]].  Two early methods were percussion, in which the ice is fractured and pulverized, and rotary drilling, a method often used in mineral exploration for rock drilling.  In the 1940s, thermal drills began to be used; these drills melt the ice by heating the drill.  Drills that use jets of hot water or steam to bore through ice soon followed.  A growing interest in [[ice core]]s, used for [[Paleoclimatology|palaeoclimatological]] research, led to ice coring drills being developed in the 1950s and 1960s, and there are now many different coring drills in use.  For obtaining ice cores from deep holes, most investigators use cable-suspended electromechanical drills, which use an armoured cable to carry electrical power to a mechanical drill at the bottom of the borehole.

In 1966, a US team successfully drilled through the [[Greenland]] ice sheet at [[Camp Century]], at a depth of {{Convert|1387|m|ft}}.  Since then many other groups have succeeded in reaching bedrock through the two largest ice sheets, in Greenland and [[Antarctica]].  Recent projects have focused on finding drilling locations that will give scientists access to very old undisturbed ice at the bottom of the borehole, since an undisturbed [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] sequence is required to accurately date the information obtained from the ice.

The first scientific ice drilling expeditions, led by [[Louis Agassiz]] from 1840 to 1842, had three goals: to prove that [[glacier]]s flowed,&lt;ref name=":62"&gt;Clarke (1987), pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; to measure the internal temperature of a glacier at different depths,&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;Clarke (1987), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; and to measure the thickness of a glacier.&lt;ref&gt;Desor (1844), pp. 292–293.&lt;/ref&gt;  Proof of [[Glacial motion|glacier motion]] was achieved by placing stakes in holes drilled in a glacier and tracking their motion from the surrounding mountain.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt; Drilling through glaciers to determine their thickness, and to test theories of glacier motion and structure, continued to be of interest for some time,&lt;ref&gt;Blümcke &amp; Hess (1910), pp. 66–70.&lt;/ref&gt; but glacier thickness has been measured by [[Reflection seismology|seismographic]] techniques since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Süsstrunk (1951), p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry &amp; Gan (2011), pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although it is no longer necessary to drill through a glacier to determine its thickness, scientists still drill [[Seismic source|shot holes]] in ice for these seismic studies.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":84" /&gt;  Temperature measurements continue to this day:&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; modelling the behaviour of glaciers requires an understanding of their internal temperature,&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; and in ice sheets, the borehole temperature at different depths can provide information about [[Paleoclimatology|past climates]].&lt;ref&gt;Alley (2000), pp. 65–67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other instruments may be lowered into the borehole, such as [[piezometer]]s, to measure pressure within the ice,&lt;ref&gt;Iken et al. (1976), p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; or cameras, to allow a visual review of the stratigraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard &amp; Glasser (2005), p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory|IceCube]], a large astrophysical project, required numerous optical sensors to be placed in holes 2.5&amp;nbsp;km deep, drilled at the South Pole.&lt;ref name=":90"&gt;Benson et al. (2014), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Borehole inclination, and the change in inclination over time, can be measured in a [[Casing (borehole)|cased]] hole, a hole in which a hollow pipe has been placed as a "[[Casing string|liner]]" to keep the hole open. This allows the three-dimensional position of the borehole to be mapped periodically, revealing the movement of the glacier, not only at the surface, but throughout its thickness.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp (1953), p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;  To understand whether a glacier is shrinking or growing, its [[Glacier mass balance|mass balance]] must be measured: this is the net effect of gains from fresh snow, minus losses from melting and sublimation.  A straightforward way to determine these effects across the surface of a glacier is to plant stakes (known as ablation stakes) in holes drilled in the glacier's surface, and monitor them over time to see if more snow is accumulating, burying the stake, or if more and more of the stake is visible as the snow around it disappears.&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1999), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;  The discovery of layers of aqueous water, and of more than a hundred [[subglacial lake]]s, beneath the [[Antarctic ice sheet]], led to speculation about the existence of unique microbial environments that had been isolated from the rest of the [[biosphere]], potentially for millions of years.  These environments can be investigated by drilling.&lt;ref&gt;National Research Council of the National Academies (2007), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GISP2D1837 crop_edit.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3|Part of the [[GISP2]] [[ice core]] from 1837–1838 meters deep, in which annual layers are visible. The core was drilled in the early 1990s, and this picture covers some 38 years of accumulated ice, which dates from about 16,250 years ago.]]

[[Ice core]]s are one of the most important motivations for drilling in ice.  Since ice cores retain environmental information about the time the ice in them fell as snow, they are useful in reconstructing past climates, and ice core analysis includes studies of [[Isotope|isotopic]] composition, mechanical properties, dissolved impurities  and dust, trapped atmospheric samples, and trace [[radionuclide]]s.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  Data from ice cores can be used to determine past variations in solar activity,&lt;ref&gt;Bradley (2015), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; and is important in the construction of [[marine isotope stage]]s, one of the key palaeoclimatic dating tools.&lt;ref&gt;Hay (2015), p. 676.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ice cores can also provide information about [[Timeline of glaciation|glacier flow and accumulation rates]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Knight (1999), pp. 206–208.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[IPICS]] (International Partnership in Ice Core Sciences) maintains a list of key goals for ice core research.  Currently these are to obtain a 1.5 million year old core;  obtain a complete record of the [[Eemian|last interglacial period]]; use ice cores to assist with the understanding of [[climate change]] over long time scales; obtain a detailed spatial array of ice core climate data for the last 2,000 years; and continue the development of advanced ice core drilling technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pastglobalchanges.org/ini/end-aff/ipics/white-papers|title=IPICS White Papers|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=16 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=PAGES – Past Global Changes|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drilling design considerations ==
The constraints on ice drill designs can be divided into the following broad categories.

=== Ice removal method and project logistics ===
The ice must be cut through, broken up, or melted.  Tools can be directly pushed into snow and [[firn]] (snow that is compressed, but not yet turned to ice, which typically happens at a depth of {{Convert|60|m|ft}} to {{Convert|120|m|ft}});&lt;ref&gt;Alley (2000), pp 48–50.&lt;/ref&gt; this method is not effective in ice, but it is perfectly adequate for obtaining samples from the uppermost layers.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;  For ice, two options are percussion drilling and rotary drilling.  Percussion drilling uses a sharp tool such as a chisel, which strikes the ice to fracture and fragment it.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 53–56.&lt;/ref&gt;  More common are rotary cutting tools, which have a rotating blade or set of blades at the bottom of the borehole to cut away the ice.  For small tools the rotation can be provided by hand, using a [[T-handle]] or a [[Brace (tool)|carpenter's brace]].  Some tools can also be set up to make use of ordinary household power drills, or they may include a motor to drive the rotation.  If the torque is supplied from the surface, then the entire [[drill string]] must be rigid so that it can be rotated; but it is also possible to place a motor just above the bottom of the drill string, and have it supply power directly to the [[drill bit]].&lt;ref name=":63"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

If the ice is to be melted instead of cut, then heat must be generated.  An electrical heater built into the drill string can heat the ice directly, or it can heat the material it is embedded in, which in turn heats the ice.  Heat can also be sent down the drill string; hot water or steam pumped down from the surface can be used to heat a metal drillhead, or the water or steam can be allowed to emerge from the drillhead and melt the ice directly.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  In at least one case a drilling project experimented with heating the drillhead on the surface, and then lowering it into the hole.&lt;ref name=":152" /&gt;

Many ice drilling locations are very difficult to access, and drills must be designed so that they can be transported to the drill site.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;  The equipment should be as light and portable as possible.&lt;ref name=":52"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":75" /&gt;  It is helpful if the equipment can be broken down so that the individual components can be carried separately, thus reducing the burden for hand-carrying, if required.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 169–170.&lt;/ref&gt;  Fuel, for steam or hot water drills, or for a generator to provide power, must also be transported, and this weight has to be taken into account as well.&lt;ref name=":96" /&gt;

=== Cuttings and meltwater ===
[[File:Drilling mechanical-drill-head.jpg|thumb|Mechanical ice auger, showing cutting teeth, helical flights used to transport ice cuttings up away from the cutting region, and a central void for the core itself.]]
Mechanical drilling produces pieces of ice, either as cuttings, or as granular fragments, which must be removed from the bottom of the hole to prevent them from interfering with the cutting or percussing action of the drill.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  An [[Auger (drill)|auger]] used as the cutting tool will naturally move ice cuttings up its helical flights.&lt;ref name=":48" /&gt; If the drill's action leaves the ice chips on top of the drill, they can be removed by simply raising the drill to the surface periodically.&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;  If not, they can be brought to the surface by lowering a tool to scoop them up, or the hole can be kept full of water, in which case the cuttings will naturally float to the top of the hole.  If the chips are not removed, they must be compacted into the walls of the borehole, and into the core if a core is being retrieved.&lt;ref name=":64"&gt;Mellor &amp; Sellmann (1976), pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuttings can also be moved to the surface by circulating compressed air through the hole, either by pumping the air through the drillpipe and out at the drillhead, forcing the chips up in the space between the drill string and the borehole wall, or by reverse air circulation, in which the air flows up through the drill string.&lt;ref name=":64" /&gt;  Compressed air will be heated by the compression, and it must be cooled before being pumped downhole, or it will cause melting of the borehole walls and the core.&lt;ref name=":71"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":85" /&gt;  If the air is circulated by creating a vacuum, rather than pumping air in, ambient air carries the cuttings, so no cooling is needed.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

A fluid can be used to circulate the cuttings away from the bit, or the fluid may be able to dissolve the cuttings.  Rotary mineral drilling (through rock) typically circulates fluid through the entire hole, and separates solids from the fluid at the surface before pumping the fluid back down.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;  In deep ice drilling it is usual to circulate the fluid only at the bottom of the hole, collecting cuttings in a chamber that is part of the downhole assembly.  For a coring drill, the cuttings chamber can be emptied each time the drill is brought to the surface to retrieve a core.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

Thermal drills will produce water, so there are no cuttings to dispose of, but the drill must be capable of working while submerged in water, or else the drill must have a method of removing and storing the meltwater while drilling.&lt;ref name=":67"&gt;Zagorodnov &amp; Thompson (2014), pp. 322–325.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drill string logistics ===
The drilling mechanism must be connected to the surface, and there must be a method of raising and lowering the drill.&lt;ref name=":68"&gt;Mellor &amp; Sellmann (1976), pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the drill string consists of pipes or rods that have to be screwed together, or otherwise assembled, as the hole gets deeper and the drill string lengthens, then there must be a way to hold the drill string in place as each length of rod or pipe is added or removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/s/slips.aspx|title=Slips – Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|last=Ramsey|first=Mark|date=|website=www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com|publisher=[[Schlumberger]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;  If the hole is only a few metres deep, no mechanical assistance may be necessary, but drill strings can get very heavy for deep holes, and a winch or other hoisting system must be in place that is capable of lifting and lowering it.&lt;ref name=":68" /&gt;

A "trip" in drilling refers to the task of pulling a drill string completely out of the hole (tripping out) and then reinserting it back into the hole (tripping in).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/t/trip.aspx|title=Trip – Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|last=Ramsey|first=Mark|date=|website=www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com|publisher=[[Schlumberger]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tripping time is the time taken to trip in and out of the hole; it is important for a drill design to minimize tripping time, particularly for coring drills, since they must complete a trip for each core.&lt;ref name=":66"&gt;Sheldon et al. (2014), pp. 260–261.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Borehole stability and permeability ===
The [[overburden pressure]] in a deep hole from the weight of the ice above will cause a borehole to slowly close up, unless something is done to counteract it, so deep holes are filled with a [[drilling fluid]] that is about the same density as the surrounding ice, such as jet fuel or kerosene.&lt;ref name=":63" /&gt;  The fluid must have low [[viscosity]] to reduce [[Tripping (pipe)|tripping]] time. Since retrieval of each segment of core requires a trip, a slower speed of travel through the drilling fluid could add significant time to a project—a year or more for a deep hole. The fluid must contaminate the ice as little as possible; it must have low [[toxicity]], for safety and to minimize the effect on the environment; it must be available at a reasonable cost; and it must be relatively easy to transport.&lt;ref name=":66" /&gt;  The depth at which borehole closure prevents dry drilling is strongly dependent on the temperature of the ice; in a temperate glacier, the maximum depth might be {{convert|100|m}}, but in a very cold environment such as parts of East Antarctica, dry drilling to {{convert|1000|m}} might be possible.&lt;ref name="Bentley_09"&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

Snow and firn are permeable to air, water, and drilling fluids, so any drilling method that requires liquid or compressed air in the hole needs to prevent them from escaping into the surface layers of snow and firn.  If the fluid is only used in the lower part of the hole, permeability is not an issue.  Alternatively the hole can be cased down past the point where the firn turns to ice.  If water is used as a drilling fluid, in cold enough temperatures, it will turn to ice in the surrounding snow and firn and seal the hole.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2014), pp. 341–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power, torque, antitorque, and heat ===
Tools can be designed to be rotated by hand, via a brace or T-handle,&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt; or a hand crank gearing,&lt;ref name=":69"&gt;Blümcke &amp; Hess (1899), pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; or attached to a hand drill.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drills with powered rotation require an electrical motor at the rig site, which generally must have fuel, though in at least one case a drilling project was set up near enough to a permanent research station to run a cable to the research building for power.&lt;ref name=":69" /&gt;  The rotation can be applied at the surface, by a [[Rotary table (drilling rig)|rotary table]], using a [[Kelly drive|kelly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/r/rotary_table.aspx|title=rotary table – Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|last=Ramsey|first=Mark|date=|website=www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com|publisher=[[Schlumberger]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by a motor in the drillhead, for cable-suspended drills; in the latter case the cable must carry power to the drillhead as well as support its weight. For rotary drills, gearing is required to reduce the engine's rotation to a suitable speed for drilling.&lt;ref name=":86"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

If torque is supplied at the bottom of the hole, the motor supplying it to the drillbit beneath it will have a tendency to rotate around its own axis, rather than imparting the rotation to the drillbit.  This is because the drillbit will have a strong resistance to rotation since it is cutting ice.  To prevent this, an anti-torque mechanism of some kind must be provided, typically by giving the motor some grip against the walls of the borehole.&lt;ref name=":70"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icecores.org/icecores/drilling.shtml|title=About Ice Cores :: Drilling Ice Cores|last=Souney|first=Joe|date=|website=icecores.org|publisher=[[National Ice Core Laboratory]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A thermal drill that uses electricity to heat the drill head so that it melts the ice must bring power down the hole, just as with rotary drills.&lt;ref&gt;Bird (1976), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  If the drillhead is heated by pumping water or steam down to the bottom of the hole, then no downhole power is needed, but a pump at the surface is required for hot water.  The water or steam can be heated at the surface by a fuel-powered boiler.&lt;ref name=":96" /&gt;  [[Solar power]] can also be used.&lt;ref name=":75"&gt;Blake et al. (1998), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Directional control ===
Some drills which are designed to rest on their tip as they drill will lean to one side in the borehole, and the hole they drill will gradually drift towards the horizontal unless some method of counteracting this tendency is provided.&lt;ref&gt;Philberth (1972), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  For other drills, directional control can be useful in starting additional holes at depth, for example to retrieve additional ice cores.&lt;ref&gt;Zagorodnov et al. (1992), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Temperature ===
Many glaciers are temperate, meaning that they contain "warm ice": ice that is at melting temperature (0&amp;nbsp;°C) throughout.&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1999), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meltwater in boreholes in warm ice will not refreeze, but for colder ice, meltwater is likely to cause a problem, and may freeze the drill in place, so thermal drills that operate submerged in the meltwater they produce, and any drilling method that results in water in the borehole, are difficult to use in such conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Paterson (1981), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drilling fluids, or [[antifreeze]] additives to meltwater, must be chosen to keep the fluid liquid at the temperatures found in the borehole.&lt;ref name=":67" /&gt;  In warm ice, ice tends to form on cutters and the drillhead, and to pack into spaces at the bottom of the hole, slowing down drilling.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 266–269.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Core retrieval ===
To retrieve a core, an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] of ice must be removed from around the cylindrical core.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard &amp; Glasser (2005), pp. 44–46.&lt;/ref&gt;  The core should be unbroken, which means that vibrations and mechanical shocks must be kept to a minimum, and changes in temperature which could cause [[thermal shock]] to the core must also be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2014), p. 345.&lt;/ref&gt;  The core must be kept from melting caused by heat generated either mechanically from the drilling process,&lt;ref&gt;Cao et al. (2015), pp. 78–85.&lt;/ref&gt; from the heat of compressed air if air is used as the drilling fluid,&lt;ref name=":71" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":85" /&gt; or from a thermal drill, and must not be contaminated by the drilling fluid.&lt;ref name=":66" /&gt;  When the core is about to be retrieved, it is still connected to the ice beneath it, so some method of breaking it at the lower end must be provided, and of gripping it so it does not fall from the core barrel as it is brought to the surface, which must be done as quickly and safely as possible.&lt;ref name=":70" /&gt;

Most coring drills are designed to retrieve cores that are no longer than {{Convert|6|m|ft}}, so drilling must stop each time the hole depth is extended by that amount, so that the core can be retrieved.&lt;ref name=":70" /&gt;  A drill string that must be assembled and disassembled in segments, such as pipe sections that must be screwed together, takes a long time to trip in and out; a cable which can be continuously winched up, or a drill string that is flexible enough to be coiled, significantly reduces tripping time.&lt;ref name=":86"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":85" /&gt;  Wireline drills have a mechanism that allows the core barrel to be detached from the drill head and winched directly to the surface without having to trip out the drill string.  Once the core is removed, the core barrel is lowered to the bottom of the hole and reattached to the drill.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Brittle ice ===
Over a depth range known as the [[brittle ice]] zone, bubbles of air are trapped in the ice under great pressure.  When a core is brought to the surface, the bubbles can exert a stress that exceeds the tensile strength of the ice, resulting in cracks and [[spall]].&lt;ref name=":60"&gt;Souney et al. (2014), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  At greater depths, the ice crystal structure changes from hexagonal to cubic, and the air molecules move inside the crystals, in a structure called a [[clathrates|clathrate]].  The bubbles disappear, and the ice becomes stable again.&lt;ref name=":60"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Uchida et al. (1994), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alley (2000), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The brittle ice zone typically returns poorer quality samples than for the rest of the core.  Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem.  Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the drilling fluid.  In mineral drilling, special machinery can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this is too expensive for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites.  Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks.  Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach is to break them into 1&amp;nbsp;m lengths in the hole.  Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.&lt;ref name=":60" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 265–266.&lt;/ref&gt;  Core quality in the brittle ice zone is much improved when a drilling fluid is used, as opposed to dry hole drilling.&lt;ref&gt;Zagorodnov et al. (1998), p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Percussion drills ==
A percussion drill penetrates ice by repeatedly striking it to fracture and fragment it. The cutting tool is mounted at the bottom of the drill string (typically connected metal rods{{#tag:ref|A "drill string" is the set of equipment down the hole; if rigid pipe or rods are used to connect the drillhead to the surface, then everything between the drillhead and the surface is the drill string.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/d/drill_string.aspx|title=Drill string – Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|last=Ramsey|first=Mark|date=|website=www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com|publisher=[[Schlumberger]]|access-date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}}), and some means of giving it kinetic energy must be provided.  A tripod erected over the hole allows a pulley to be set up, and a cable can then be used to repeatedly raise and drop the tool.  This method is known as [[Drilling rig#Cable tool drilling|cable tool]] drilling.  A weight repeatedly dropped on to a rigid drill string can also be used to provide the necessary impetus.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  The pulverized ice collects at the bottom of the borehole, and must be removed. It can be collected with a tool capable of scooping it from the bottom of the hole,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; or the hole can be kept full of water, so that the ice floats to the top of the hole, though this retards the momentum of the drill striking the ice, reducing its effectiveness.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Vallot (1898), pp. 190–193.&lt;/ref&gt;  A percussion drilling tool that is not mechanically driven requires some method of raising the drill so it can be released, to fall on the ice.  To do this efficiently with manual labour, it is usual to set up a tripod or other supporting scaffold, and a pulley to allow the drill string to be raised by a rope.  This arrangement, known as a cable-tool rig, can also be used for mechanical drilling, with a motor raising the drill string and allowing it to fall.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  An alternative approach is to leave the drill string at the bottom of the borehole, and to raise and let fall a hammer weight onto the drill string.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The earliest scientific ice drilling expedition used percussion drilling; Louis Agassiz used iron rods to drill holes in the [[Unteraargletscher]], in the [[Alps]], in the summer of 1840.&lt;ref name=":62" /&gt;  Cable-tool rigs have been used for ice drilling in more recent times; Soviet expeditions in the 1960s drilled with cable-tool rigs in the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] and the [[Tien Shan]] range, and US projects have drilled on the [[Blue Glacier]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] between 1969 and 1976, and on the [[Black Rapids Glacier]] in [[Alaska]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Two other percussion methods have been tried.  [[Jackhammer|Pneumatic drills]] have been used to drill shallow holes in ice in order to set blast charges, and rotary percussion drills, a type of drilling tool once in common use in the mining industry, have also been used for drilling blasting holes, but neither approach has been used for scientific investigations of ice.  Percussion drilling is now rarely used for scientific ice drilling, having been overtaken by more effective techniques for both ice and mineral drilling.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Hand-operated mechanical drills ==

=== Spoon-borers ===

A soil sampling auger contains a pair of blades at the bottom of an enclosed cylinder; it can be driven and rotated by hand to pick up soft soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ams-samplers.com/hand-tooling/soil-samplers/soil-augers.html|title=Providing A Wide Variety Of Soil Augering Tools For Your Project|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ams-samplers.com|publisher=AMS Inc|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar design, called a spoon-borer, has been used for ice drilling, though it is not effective in hard ice.&lt;ref name="vd283_4"&gt;von Drygalski (1904), pp. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt;  A version used by [[Erich von Drygalski]] in 1902 had two half-moon cutting blades set into the base of the cylinder in such a way as to allow the ice cuttings to accumulate in the cylinder, above the blades.&lt;ref name="vd283_4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Von Drygalski referred to the device he used in 1902 as a "Löffelbohrer"; Talalay translates this as "spoon-borer".&lt;ref name="vd283_4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;|group=note}}

=== Noncoring augers ===

[[File:Ice auger cropped.jpg|thumb|260x260px|Ice auger with offset brace handle]]
Augers have long been used for drilling through ice for [[ice fishing]].  Augers can be rotated by hand, using a mechanism such as a T handle or a brace bit, or by attaching them to powered hand drills.&lt;ref name=":79"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 31–33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientific uses for non-coring augers include sensor installation and determining ice thickness.  Augers have a helical screw blade around the main drilling axis; this blade, called the "flighting", carries the ice cuttings up from the bottom of the hole.&lt;ref name=":48"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 27–28.&lt;/ref&gt;  For drilling deeper holes, extensions can be added to the auger, but as the auger gets longer it becomes more difficult to rotate.  With a platform such as a stepladder, a longer auger can be rotated from higher off the ground.&lt;ref name=":79" /&gt;

Commercially available ice augers for winter fishing, powered by petrol, propane, or battery power, are available for hole diameters from 4.5 in to 10 in.  For holes deeper than 2 m a tripod can be used to winch the auger from the hole.  A folding brace handle with an offset design is common; this allows both hands to contribute to the torque.&lt;ref name=":79" /&gt;

=== Coring augers ===

[[File:Johnson 1954 ice boring device patent.png|left|thumb|239x239px|Coring ice auger with no barrel.  Designs like this proved difficult to make sufficiently rigid.&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;]]
Augers that are capable of retrieving ice cores are similar to noncoring augers, except that the flights are set around a hollow core barrel.  Augers have been devised that consist of the helical cutting blades and a space for a core, without the central supporting cylinder, but they are difficult to make sufficiently rigid.  Coring augers typically produce cores with diameters in the range 75–100&amp;nbsp;mm, and with lengths up to 1 m.  Coring augers were originally designed to be manually rotated, but over time they have been adapted for use with handheld drills or small engines.&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;

As with noncoring augers, extensions can be added to drill deeper.  Drilling deeper than 6 m requires more than one person because of the weight of the drill string.  A clamp placed at the surface is useful for supporting the string, and a tripod and block and tackle can also be used for support and to increase the weight of string that can be handled.  As the drill string gets longer, it takes more time to complete a trip to extract a core, since each extension rod must be separated from the drill string when tripping out, and re-attached when tripping in.&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;

Drilling with a tripod or other method of handling a long drill string considerably extends the depth limit for the use of a coring auger.&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":77" /&gt;  The deepest hole drilled by hand with an auger was 55 m, in the [[Ward Hunt Ice Shelf]] on [[Ellesmere Island]], in 1960.  Usually a hole deeper than 30 m will be drilled with other methods, because of the weight of the drill string and the long trip time required.&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;

Modern coring augers have changed little in decades: an ice coring auger patented in the US in 1932 closely resembles coring augers in use eighty years later.&lt;ref name=":49" /&gt;  The US military's [[Frost Effects Laboratory]] (FEL) developed an ice mechanics testing kit that included a coring auger in the late 1940s; the [[Snow, Ice and Permafrost Research Establishment]] (SIPRE), a successor organization, refined the design in the early 1950s, and the resulting auger, known as the SIPRE auger, is still in wide use.  It was modified slightly by the [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] (CRREL), another successor organization, in the 1960s, and is sometimes known as the CRREL auger for that reason.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 37–39.&lt;/ref&gt; An auger developed in the 1970s by the [[Polar Ice Core Office]] (PICO), then based in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], is also still widely used.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  A coring auger designed at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in the 1980s was used for the first time at [[Camp Century]], and since then has been frequently used in Greenland.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, the US [[Ice Drilling Design and Operations]] group (IDDO) began work on an improved hand auger design and a version was successfully tested in the field during the 2012–2013 field season at [[WAIS Divide]].&lt;ref&gt;Goetz &amp; Shturmakov (2013), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2017 IDDO maintains both 3-inch and 4-inch diameter versions of the new auger for the use of US ice drilling research programs, and these are now the most-requested hand auger provided by IDDO.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (2017), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prairie Dog auger, designed in 2007, adds an outer barrel to the basic coring auger design.  Cuttings are captured between the auger flights and the outer barrel, which has an anti-torque section to prevent it from rotating in the hole.&lt;ref name=":77"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of the outer barrel is to increase the efficiency of chip collection, since it is common to see chips from a hand auger run fall back into the hole from the auger flights, which means the next run has to redrill through these cuttings.&lt;ref&gt;Kyne &amp; McConnell (2007), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  The outer barrel also makes the auger effective in warm ice, which could easily cause an auger with no outer barrel to jam.&lt;ref name=":77" /&gt;  The outside barrel of the Prairie Dog is the same as the diameter of the PICO auger, and since the Prairie Dog's anti-torque blades do not perform well in soft snow and firn, it is common to start a hole with the PICO auger and then continue it with the Prairie Dog once dense firn is reached.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 258–259.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Prairie Dog is relatively heavy, and can require two drillers to handle it as it is being removed from the hole.&lt;ref name=":77" /&gt;  The IDDO maintains a Prairie Dog drill for the use of US ice drilling research programs.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (30 June 2017), Ice Drilling Design and Operations: Long Range Technology Plan, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

IDDO also provides a lifting system for use with hand augers, known as the Sidewinder.  It is driven by an electric hand drill, which can be powered by a generator or by solar cells.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sidewinder winds a rope around the hand auger as it is lowered into the hole, and assists in raising the auger back out of the hole.  This extends the maximum practical depth for hand augering to about 40 m.  Sidewinders have proved popular with researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (30 June 2017), Ice Drilling Design and Operations: Long Range Technology Plan, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":78"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Piston drills ===
A piston drill consists of a flat disc at the bottom of a long rod, with three or four radial slots in the disc, each of which has a cutting edge.  The rod is rotated by hand, using a brace handle; the ice comes through the slots and piles up on top of the disc. Pulling the drill out of the borehole brings the cuttings up on the disc.  In the 1940s some patents for piston drill designs were filed in Sweden and the U.S., but these drills are now rarely used.  They are less efficient than auger drills, since the drill must be periodically removed from the hole to get rid of the cuttings.&lt;ref name=":49"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hand core drills and mini drills ===
Some hand drills have been designed to retrieve cores without using auger flights to transport the cuttings up the hole.  These drills typically have a core barrel with teeth at the lower end, and are rotated by a brace or T-handle, or by a small engine.  The barrel itself can be omitted, so that the drill consists only of a ring with a cutting slot to cut the annulus around the core, and a vertical rod to attach the ring to the surface.  A couple of small hand-held drills, or mini drills, have been designed to quickly collect core samples up to 50&amp;nbsp;cm long.  A difficulty with all these designs is that as soon as cuttings are generated, if they are not removed they will interfere with the cutting action of the drill, making these tools slow and inefficient in use.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 45–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  A very small drill, known as the Chipmunk Drill, was designed by IDDO for use by a project in West Greenland in 2003 and 2004, and was subsequently used at the [[South Pole]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (30 June 2017), Ice Drilling Design and Operations: Long Range Technology Plan, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rotary rigs using drillpipe ==
Rotary rigs used in mineral drilling use a string of drillpipe connected to a drillbit at the bottom of the hole, and to a rotary mechanism at the top of the hole,&lt;ref name=":50" /&gt; such as a top drive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/t/top_drive.aspx|title=Top drive – Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|last=Ramsey|first=Mark|date=|website=www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com|publisher=[[Schlumberger]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or rotary table and kelly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/r/rotary_table.aspx|title=Rotary table – Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|last=Ramsey|first=Mark|date=|website=www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com|publisher=[[Schlumberger]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the borehole deepens, drilling is paused periodically to add a new length of drill pipe at the top of the drill string.  These projects have usually been undertaken with commercially available rotary rigs originally designed for mineral drilling, with adaptations to suit the special needs of ice drilling.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 59–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dry drilling ===
When drilling in ice, the hole may be drilled dry, with no mechanism to dispose of the cuttings.  In snow and firn this means that the cuttings simply compact into the walls of the borehole; and in coring drills they also compact into the core.  In ice, the cuttings accumulate in the space between the drillpipe and the borehole wall, and eventually start to clog the drill bit, usually after no more than 1 m of progress.  This increases the torque needed to drill, slows down progress, and can cause the loss of the drill.  Dry core drilling generally produces a poor quality core that is broken into pieces.&lt;ref name=":50"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the French [[Expédition Polaires Françaises]] (EPF) drilled two dry holes in Greenland using a rotary rig, at [[Camp VI, Greenland|Camp VI]], on the west coast, and [[Station Centrale, Greenland|Station Centrale]], inland, reaching 126 m and 151 m.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some shallow holes were also drilled that summer on [[Baffin Island]], using a coring drill,&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the Antarctic, the [[Norwegian–British–Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] (NBSAE) drilled several holes between April 1950 and the following year, eventually reaching 100 m in one hole.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  The last expedition to try dry drilling in ice was the [[2nd Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] (SAE), which drilled three holes between July 1957 and January 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since that time dry drilling has been abandoned as other drilling methods have proved to be more effective.&lt;ref name=":50" /&gt;

=== Air circulation ===
Several holes have been drilled in ice using direct air circulation, in which compressed air is pumped down the drillpipe, to escape through holes in the drillbit, and return up the annular space between the drillbit and the borehole, carrying the cuttings with it.  The technique was first tried by the [[1st Soviet Antarctic Expedition]], in October 1956.  There were problems with poor cuttings removal, and ice forming in the borehole, but the drill succeeded in reaching a depth of 86.5 m.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  Further attempts were made to use air circulation with rotary rigs by US, Soviet and Belgian expeditions, with a maximum hole depth of 411 m reached by a US team at [[Site 2, Greenland|Site 2]] in Greenland in 1957.  The last time a project used a conventional rotary rig with air circulation was 1961.&lt;ref name=":80"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fluid circulation ===
In mineral exploration, the most common drilling method is a rotary rig with fluid circulated down the drillpipe and back up between the drillpipe and the borehole wall.  The fluid carries the cuttings to the surface, where the cuttings are removed, and the recycled fluid, known as mud, is returned to the hole.  The first ice drilling project to try this approach was an [[American Geographical Society]] expedition to the [[Taku Glacier]] in 1950.  Fresh water, drawn from the glacier, was used as the drilling fluid, and three holes were drilled, to a maximum depth of 89 m.  Cores were retrieved, but in poor condition.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;  Seawater has also been tried as a drilling fluid.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first time a fluid other than water was used with a conventional rotary rig was in late 1958, at Little America V, where diesel fuel was used for the last few metres of a 254 m hole.&lt;ref name=":80" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wireline ===
A wireline drill uses air or fluid circulation, but also has a tool that can be lowered into the drillpipe to retrieve a core without removing the drill string.  The tool, called an overshot, latches onto the core barrel and pulls it up to the surface.  When the core is removed, the core barrel is lowered back into the borehole and reattached to the drill.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  A wireline core drilling project was planned in the 1970s for the International Antarctic Glaciological Project, but was never completed,&lt;ref name=":81" /&gt; and the first wireline ice drilling project took place in 1976,{{#tag:ref|Bentley et al. assert that the drill used on Taku Glacier in 1950 by Maynard Miller was a wireline drill, but Talalay gives a detailed description of the drill and lists it as non-wireline.&lt;ref name=":33"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley_09" /&gt;|group=note}} as part of the [[Ross Ice Shelf Project]] (RISP).&lt;ref name=":80" /&gt;  A hole was started in November of that year with a wireline drill, probably using air circulation, but problems with the overshot forced the project to switch to thermal drilling when the hole was 103 m deep.&lt;ref name=":81"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt;  The RISP project reached over 170 m with another wireline drill the following season,&lt;ref name=":81" /&gt; and several 1980s Soviet expedition also used wireline drills, after starting the holes with an auger drill and casing the holes.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Agile Sub-Ice Geological (ASIG) drill, designed by IDDO to collect sub-glacial cores, is a recent wireline system; it was first used in the field in the 2016–2017 season, in West Antarctica.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous (30 June 2017), Ice Drilling Design and Operations: Long Range Technology Plan, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assessment ===
There are many disadvantages to using conventional rotary rigs for ice drilling.  When a conventional rotary rig is used for coring, the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the borehole each time the core is retrieved; each length of pipe in turn  must be unscrewed and racked.  As the hole gets deeper, this becomes very time-consuming.&lt;ref name=":50" /&gt;  Conventional rigs are very heavy, and since many ice drilling sites are not easily accessible these rigs place a large logistical burden on an ice drilling project.  For deep holes, a drilling fluid is required to maintain pressure in the borehole and prevent the hole from closing up because of the pressure the ice is under; a drilling fluid requires additional heavy equipment to circulate and store the fluid, and to separate the circulated material.  Any circulation system also requires the upper part of the hole, through the snow and firn, to be cased, since circulated air or fluid would escape through anything more permeable than ice.  Commercial rotary rigs are not designed for extremely cold temperatures, and in addition to problems with components such as the hydraulics and fluid management systems, they are designed to operate outdoors, which is impractical in extreme environments such as Antarctic drilling.&lt;ref name=":52"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial rotary rigs can be effective for large-diameter holes, and can also be used for subglacial drilling into rock.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;  They have also been used with some success for rock glaciers, which are challenging to drill because they contain a heterogeneous mixture of ice and rock.&lt;ref name=":52" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flexible drillstem rigs ==
Flexible drillstem rigs use a drill string that is continuous, so that it does not have to be assembled or disassembled, rod by rod or pipe by pipe, when tripping in or out.  The drill string is also flexible, so that when out of the borehole it can be stored on a reel.  The drill string may be a reinforced hose, or it may be steel or composite pipe, in which case it is known as a coiled-tubing drill.  Rigs designed along these lines began to appear in the 1960s and 1970s in mineral drilling, and became commercially viable in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":85" /&gt;

Only one such rig, the rapid air movement (RAM) system developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison by Ice Coring and Drilling Services (ICDS), has been used for ice drilling.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":85"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 101–103.&lt;/ref&gt;  The RAM drill was developed in the early 2000s, and was originally designed for drilling shot holes for seismic exploration.&lt;ref name=":85" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":83"&gt;Anonymous (30 June 2017), Ice Drilling Design and Operations: Long Range Technology Plan, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  The drill stem is a hose through which air is pumped; the air drives a turbine that powers a downhole rotary drill bit.  Ice cuttings are removed by the exhaust air and fountain out of the hole.  The compressor increases the temperature of the air by about 50°, and it is cooled again before being pumped downhole, with a final temperature about 10° warmer than the ambient air.  This means it cannot be used in ambient temperatures warmer than −10&amp;nbsp;°C.  To avoid ice forming in the hose, ethanol is added to the compressed air.&lt;ref name=":85" /&gt;  The system, which includes a winch to hold 100 m of hose, as well as two air compressors, is mounted on a sled.&lt;ref name=":84"&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 285.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has successfully drilling hundreds of holes in West Antarctica, and was easily able to drill to 90 m in only 25 minutes, making it the fastest ice drill.&lt;ref name=":85" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":84" /&gt;  It was also used by the Askaryan Radio Array project in 2010–2011 at the South Pole, but was unable to drill below 63 m there because of variations in the local characteristics of the ice and firn.&lt;ref name=":82"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":83" /&gt;  It cannot be used in a fluid-filled hole, which limits the maximum hole depth for this design.&lt;ref name=":84" /&gt;  The main problem with the RAM drill is a loss of air circulation in firn and snow, which might be addressed by using reverse air circulation, via a vacuum pump drawing air up through the hose.&lt;ref name=":82"/&gt;  As of 2017 IDDO is planning a revised design for the RAM drill to reduce the weight of the drill, which is currently 10.3 tonnes.&lt;ref name=":85" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":83" /&gt;

Other flexible drill stem designs have been considered, and in some cases tested, but as of 2016 none had been successfully used in the field.&lt;ref name=":82" /&gt;  One design suggested using hot water to drill via a hose, and replacing the drillhead with a mechanical drill for coring once the depth of interest is reached, using the hot water both to hydraulically power the down hole motor, and to melt the resulting ice cuttings.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another design, the RADIX drill, produces a very narrow hole (20&amp;nbsp;mm) and is intended for rapid drilling access holes; it uses a small hydraulic motor on a narrow hose.  It was tested in 2015 but found to have difficulty with cuttings transport, probably because of the very narrow space available between the hose and the borehole wall.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coiled-tubing designs have never been successfully used for ice drilling. Coring operations would be particularly difficult, since a coring drill must trip out and in for each core, which would lead to [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]; the tubing is typically rated for a lifetime of only 100 to 200 trips.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Cable-suspended electromechanical drills ==
[[File:Cable suspended ice core drilling system schematic.png|thumb|Schematic of cable-suspended ice core drilling system&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;|left|upright=1.5]]
A cable-suspended drill has a downhole system, known as a sonde, to drill the hole.&lt;ref name=":86"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":87"&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 226–227.&lt;/ref&gt;  The sonde is connected to the surface by an armoured cable, which provides power and enables the drill to be winched in and out of the hole.&lt;ref name=":86"/&gt;  Electromechanical (EM) cable-suspended drills have a cutting head, with blades that shave the ice as they rotate, like a carpenter's plane.  The depth of penetration of the cut is adjusted by a device called a shoe, which is part of the cutting head.  The ice cuttings are stored in a chamber in the sonde, either in the core barrel, above the core, or in a separate chamber, further up the drill.

The cuttings can be transported by auger flights or by fluid circulation.  Drills that rely on auger flights and which are not designed to work in a fluid-filled hole are limited to depths at which borehole closure is not a problem, so these are known as shallow drills.&lt;ref name=":87" /&gt;  Deeper holes have to be drilled with drilling fluid, but whereas circulation in a rotary drill takes the fluid all the way down and then up the borehole, cable-suspended drills only need to circulate the fluid from the drill head up to the cuttings chamber.  This is known as bottom-hole circulation.&lt;ref name=":86"/&gt;

The upper part of the sonde has an antitorque system, which most commonly consists of three or four leaf-springs that press out against the borehole walls.  Sharp edges on the leaf springs catch in the walls and provide the necessary resistance to prevent this part of the drill from rotating. At the point where the cable connects to the sonde, most drills include a [[slip ring]], to allow the drill to rotate independently of the cable.  This is to prevent torque damage to the cable if the anti-torque system fails.  Coring drills may also have a weight that can be used as a hammer to assist in breaking the core, and a chamber for any instrumentation or sensors needed.&lt;ref name=":86"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":87" /&gt;

At the bottom of the sonde is the cutting head, and above this is the core barrel, with auger flights around it on shallow drills, and typically an outer barrel around that, usually with internal vertical ribs or some other way of providing additional impetus to the upward-bound cuttings on the flights.  If there is a separate chip chamber it will be above the core barrel.  The motor, with suitable gearing, is also above the core barrel.&lt;ref name=":86"/&gt;

Shallow drills can retrieve cores up to 300–350 m deep, but core quality is much improved if drilling fluid is present, so some shallow drills have been designed to work in wet holes.  Tests reported in 2014 showed that wet drilling, with the top of the drilling fluid no deeper than 250 m, would maintain good core quality.&lt;ref name=":86"/&gt;

Drilling fluids are necessary for drilling deep holes, so the cable-suspended drills that are used for these projects use a pump to provide fluid circulation, in order to remove the cuttings from the bit.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  A few drills designed for use with drilling fluid also have auger flights on the inner barrel.&lt;ref name=":87" /&gt;  As with shallow drills, the cuttings are stored in a chamber above the core.  The circulation can be in either direction: down the inside of the drill string, and up between the core barrel and the borehole wall, or in the reverse direction, which has become the favoured approach in drill design as it gives better cuttings removal for a lower flow rate.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 252–253.&lt;/ref&gt;  Drills capable of reaching depths over 1500 m are known as deep drilling systems; they have generally similar designs to the intermediate systems that can drill from 400 m to 1500 m, but must have heavier and more robust systems such as winches, and have longer drills and larger drilling shelters.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt;  Core diameters for these drills have varied from 50&amp;nbsp;mm to 132&amp;nbsp;mm, and the core length from as short as 0.35 m up to 6 m.  A common design feature of these deep drills is that they can be tipped to the horizontal to make it easier to remove the core and the cuttings.  This reduces the required height of the mast, but requires a deep slot to be cut into the ice, to make room for the sonde to swing up.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 227–228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first cable-suspended electromechanical drill was invented by [[Armais Arutunoff]] for use in mineral drilling; it was tested in 1947 in Oklahoma, but did not perform well.&lt;ref name=":55"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":56"&gt;Shoemaker (2002), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;  CRREL acquired a reconditioned Arutunoff drill in 1963,&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":56" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":57"&gt;Hansen (1994), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; modified it for drilling in ice, and in 1966 used it to extend a hole at Camp Century in Greenland to the base of the ice cap, at 1387 m, and 4 m further into the bedrock.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":56" /&gt;

Many other drills have since been based on this basic design.&lt;ref name=":55" /&gt;  A recent variation on the basic EM drill design is the Rapid Access Isotope Drill, designed by the British Antarctic Survey to drill dry holes to 600 m.&lt;ref name=":106"&gt;Talalay (2014), p. 340.&lt;/ref&gt;  This drill does not collect a complete ice core; instead it will collect ice cuttings,&lt;ref name=":106" /&gt; using a cutting head similar to a spoonborer.&lt;ref name=":107"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.designworldonline.com/600-meters-ice/|title=600 meters below the ice|last=Motor|first=Maxon|date=|website=www.designworldonline.com|publisher=[[Design World]]|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting access hole will be used for temperature profiling,&lt;ref name=":106" /&gt; and along with the isotope results which will indicate the age of the ice, the data will be used for modeling the ice profile down to bedrock in order to determine the best place to drill to obtain the oldest possible undisturbed basal ice.&lt;ref name=":108"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/project/rapid-access-isotope-drill/|title=RAID: Rapid Access Isotope Drill – Project – British Antarctic Survey|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bas.ac.uk|publisher=[[British Antarctic Survey]]|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":107" /&gt;  The drill is expected to reach 600 m in 7 days of drilling, rather than the 2 months which would be needed to drill a core; the speed is because the cutters can be more aggressive as core quality is not an issue, and because the borehole is narrow which reduces power requirements for the winch.&lt;ref name=":108" /&gt;

== Thermal drills ==
Thermal drills work by applying heat to the ice at the bottom of the borehole to melt it.  Thermal drills in general are able to drill successfully in temperate ice, where an electromechanical drill is at risk of jamming because of ice forming in the borehole.&lt;ref name=":67" /&gt;  When used in colder ice, some form of antifreeze is likely to be introduced into the borehole to prevent the meltwater from freezing in the drill.&lt;ref name=":67" /&gt;

=== Hot water and steam drills ===
[[File:Hot water drill schematic.png|thumb|Schematic of a hot water drill&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;|upright=4|center]]
Hot water can be used to drill in ice by pumping it down a hose with a nozzle at the end; the jet of hot water will quickly produce a hole.  Letting the hose dangle freely will produce a straight hole; as the hole gets deeper the weight of the hose makes this hard to manage manually, and at a depth of about 100 m it becomes necessary to run the hose over a pulley and use counterweights.&lt;ref name=":89"&gt;Iken et al. (1976), p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the pressure in the hose is proportional to the square of the flow, hose diameter is one of the limiting factors for a hot-water drill.  To increase flow rate beyond a certain point, the hose diameter must be increased, but this will require significant capacity increases elsewhere in the drill design.&lt;ref name=":91"&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 264–265.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoses that are wrapped around a drum before being pressurized will exert constricting force on the drum, so the drums must be of robust design.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoses must wrap neatly when spooling up, to avoid damage; this can be done manually for smaller systems, but for very large drills a level-wind system has to be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt;  The hose ideally should have the tensile strength to support its weight when spooling into the hole, but for very deep holes a supporting cable may need to be used to support the hose.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt;

Steam can also be used in place of hot water, and does not need to be pumped.  A handheld steam drill is able to rapidly drill short holes, for example for ablation stakes, and both steam and hotwater drills can be made light enough to be hand carried.&lt;ref name=":96" /&gt;  A guide tube can be used to help keep the borehole straight.&lt;ref name=":94" /&gt;

In cold ice, a borehole drilled with hot water will close up as the water freezes.  To avoid this, the drill can be run back down the hole, warming the water and hence the surrounding ice.  This is a form of [[Reamer|reaming]].  Repeated reamings will raise the temperature of the surrounding ice to the point where the borehole will stay open for longer periods.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, if the goal is to measure temperature in the borehole, then it is better to apply as little additional heat as possible to the surrounding ice, which means that a higher energy drill with a high water flow rate is desirable, since this will be more efficient.&lt;ref name=":91" /&gt;  If there is a risk of the drill freezing in, a "back drill" can be included in the design.  This is a mechanism which redirects the hot water jet upwards if the drill meets with resistance on tripping out.&lt;ref name=":100"&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;  A separate hot water reamer can also be used, jetting hot water sideways onto the borehole walls as it passes.&lt;ref name=":100" /&gt;

Boreholes drilled with hot water are rather irregular, which makes them unsuitable for certain kinds of investigations, such as speed of borehole closure, or inclinometry measurements.  The warm water from the nozzle will continue to melt the borehole walls as it rises, and this will tend to make the hole cone-shaped—if the hole is being drilled at a location with no surface snow or firn, such as an ablation zone in a glacier, then this effect will persist to the top of the borehole.&lt;ref name=":96" /&gt;

The water supply for a hot water drill can come from water at the surface, if available, or melted snow.  The meltwater in the borehole can be reused, but this can only be done once the hole penetrates below the firn to the impermeable ice layer, because above this level the meltwater escapes.  The pump to bring the meltwater back to the surface must be placed below this level, and in addition, if there is a chance that the borehole will penetrate to the base of the ice, the drilling project must plan for the likelihood that this will change the water level in the hole, and ensure that the pump is below the lowest likely level.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 266–267.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heating systems are usually adapted from the heaters used in the pressure washer industry.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Steam drill schematic.png|thumb|Schematic of a steam drill&lt;ref name=":96" /&gt;|upright=2.5]]When any thermal drilling method is used in dirty ice, the debris will accumulate at the bottom of the borehole, and start to impede the drill; enough debris, in the form of sand, pebbles, or a large rock, could completely stop progress.&lt;ref name=":93"&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 267.&lt;/ref&gt;  One way to avoid this is to have a nozzle angled at 45°; using this nozzle will create a side channel into which the obstructions will go.  Vertical drilling can then start again, bypassing the debris.&lt;ref name=":89" /&gt;  Another approach is to recirculate the water at the bottom of the hole, with an electrical heater embedded in the drill head and filters in the circulation.  This can remove most of the small debris that impedes the drillhead.&lt;ref&gt;Rado et al. (1987), pp. 236–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

A different problem with impure ice comes from contaminants brought in by the project, such as clothing and wood fibres, dust, and grit.  Using snow from around the campsite to supply the drill with water is often necessary at the start of drilling, as the hole will not yet have reached the impermeable ice, so water cannot be pumped back up from the bottom of the hole; shoveling this snow into the drill's water supply will pass these contaminants through the drill mechanism, and can damage the pumps and valves.  A fine filter is required to avoid these problems.&lt;ref name=":93" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early expedition using hot water drills was in 1955, to the [[Mer de Glace]]; [[Électricité de France]] used hot water to reach the base of the glacier, and also used equipment that sprayed multiple jets simultaneously to create a tunnel under the ice.&lt;ref&gt;Reynaud &amp; Courdouan (1962), p. 813.&lt;/ref&gt; More development work was done in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=":95" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":96"&gt;Gillet (1975), pp. 171–174.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hot water drills are now capable of drilling very deep holes: for example, between 2004 and 2011, a large hot water drill at the South Pole was used to drill 86 holes to a depth of 2.5&amp;nbsp;km to set strings of sensors in the boreholes, for the [[IceCube Neutrino Observatory|IceCube]] project.&lt;ref name=":90" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benson et al. (2014), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hot water coring drills have also been developed.&lt;ref name=":95"&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early steam drill was developed by F. Howorka in the early 1960s for work in the Alps.&lt;ref name=":94"&gt;Howorka (1965), pp. 749–750.&lt;/ref&gt; Steam drills are not used for holes deeper than 30 m, as they are quite inefficient&lt;ref name=":99"&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; due to thermal losses along the hose, and pressure losses with increasing depth under water.&lt;ref&gt;Rado et al. (1987), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;  They are primarily used for quickly drilling shallow holes.&lt;ref name=":99" /&gt;

=== Hotpoints ===
Instead of using a jet of hot water or steam, thermal drills can also be constructed to provide heat to a durable drillhead, for example by pumping hot water down and back up again inside the drill string, and use that to melt the ice.&lt;ref name=":96" /&gt;  Modern thermal drills use electrical power to heat the drillhead instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icedrill.org/equipment/electrothermal.shtml|title=Thermal Drill : U.S. Ice Drilling Program|last=Souney|first=Joe|date=|website=icedrill.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to drill with a hotpoint that consists of an electrical heating element, directly exposed to the ice; this means that the element must be able to work underwater.&lt;ref&gt;Ract-Madoux &amp; Reynaud (1951), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some drills instead embed the heating element in a material such as silver or copper that will conduct the heat quickly to the hotpoint surface;&lt;ref&gt;Shreve (1962), pp. 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; these can be constructed so that the electrical connections are not exposed to water.&lt;ref&gt;Ward (1961), p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt;  Electrothermal drills require a cable to bring the power down the hole; the circuit can be completed via the drillpipe if one is present.&lt;ref name=":58"&gt;Sharp (1951), pp. 479–480.&lt;/ref&gt;  A transformer is needed in the drill assembly since the cable must carry high voltage to avoid power dissipation.&lt;ref name=":54"&gt;Hansen (1994), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is more difficult to arrange electrical power at a remote location than to generate heat via a gas boiler, so hotpoint drills are only used for boreholes up to a few hundred metres deep.&lt;ref name=":103"&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest attempt to use heat to drill in ice was in 1904, when C. Bernard drilling at the [[Tête Rousse Glacier]], tried using heated iron bars to drill with.  The ends of the bars were heated until incandescent, and lowered into the borehole.&lt;ref name=":152"&gt;Mercanton (1905), pp. 461–462.&lt;/ref&gt; The first true hotpoint was used by Mario Calciati in 1942 on the Hosand Glacier.  Calciati pumped hot water from the surface down the drillstem, and back up after it had passed through the drillhead.&lt;ref name=":412"&gt;Kasser (1960), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":202"&gt;Renaud &amp; Mercanton (1950), pp. 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other hotpoint designs have used electrical heating to heat the drillhead; this was done in 1948 by a British expedition to the Jungfraujoch,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Gerrard et al. (1952), pp. 548–551.&lt;/ref&gt; and by many other drill designs since then.  Hotpoints do not produce cores, so they are used primarily for creating access holes.&lt;ref name=":103" /&gt;

=== Electrothermal coring drills ===
[[File:Thermal drill schematics.png|thumb|Three thermal drill designs&lt;ref name=":67" /&gt;|359x359px]]
The development in the 1960s of thermal coring drills for intermediate depth holes was prompted by the problems associated with rotary coring drills, which were too costly to use for polar ice cores because of the logistical problems caused by their weight.&lt;ref&gt;Bird (1976), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Langway (1967), pp. 102–104.&lt;/ref&gt; The components of a thermal drill are generally the same as for a cable-suspended EM drill: both have a mast and winch, and an armoured cable to provide power downhole to a sonde, which includes a core barrel. No antitorque system is needed for a thermal drill, and instead of a motor that provides torque, the power is used to generate heat in the cutting head, which is ring shaped to melt an annulus of ice around the core.  Some drills may also have a centralizer, to keep the sonde in the middle of the borehole.&lt;ref name=":67" /&gt;

The sonde of an electrothermal drill designed to run submerged in meltwater may consist almost entirely of the core barrel plus the heated cutting head (diagram (a) in the figure to the right).  Alternative designs for use in colder ice (see diagram (b) at right) may have a compartment above the core barrel, and tubes that run down to just above the cutting head; a vacuum pump sucks up the meltwater.  In these drills the meltwater must be emptied at the surface at the end of each coring run.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Another approach (see (c) at right) is to use a drilling fluid that is a mixture of ethanol and water, with the exact proportions determined by the ice temperature.  In these drills there is a piston above the core barrel and at the start of a run the piston is at the bottom of the sonde, and the space above is filled with drilling fluid.  As the drills cuts downwards, the core pushes the piston up, pumping the fluid down and out around the cutting head, where it mixes with the meltwater and prevents it from freezing.  The piston is the only moving part, which simplifies the design; and the core barrel can take up much of the length of the sonde, whereas drills which suck out the meltwater in order to drill in a dry hole have to sacrifice a large section of the sonde for meltwater storage.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Zagorodnov &amp; Thompson (2014), pp. 324–325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal drills designed for temperate ice are light and straightforward to operate, which makes them suitable for use on high-altitude glaciers, though this also requires that the drill can be disassembled into components for human-powered transport to the most inaccessible locations, since helicopters may not be able to reach the highest glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;Zagorodnov &amp; Thompson (2014), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koci (2002), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrothermal drill designs date back to the 1940s.  An electrothermal drill was patented in Switzerland in May 1946 by [[Koechlin family|René Koechlin]], and was used in Switzerland,&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;Nizery (1951), pp. 66–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":97"&gt;Koechlin (1946), pp. 1–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":98"&gt;Remenieras &amp; Terrier (1951), p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1948 a British expedition to the Jungfraujoch drilled to the bed of the glacier using an electrothermal design.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  Twenty electrothermal coring drills were designed between 1964 and 2005, though many designs were abandoned because of the higher performance of EM coring drills.&lt;ref name=":67" /&gt;

== Autonomous probes ==
[[File:Cryobot design.png|left|thumb|Cryobot design for NASA Martian ice cap probe, partly built in 2001]]
If the goal is to obtain instrument readings from within the ice, and there is no need to retrieve either the ice or the drill system, then a probe containing a long spool of cable and a hotpoint can be used.  The hotpoint allows the probe to melt its way through the ice, unreeling the cable behind it.  The meltwater will refreeze, so the probe cannot be recovered, but it can continue to penetrate the ice until it reaches the limit of the cable it carries, and send instrument readings back up through the cable to the surface.&lt;ref name=":61" /&gt;  Known as Philberth probes,&lt;ref&gt;Aamot (1968a), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; these devices were designed by Karl and [[Bernhard Philberth]] in the 1960s as a way to store nuclear waste in the Antarctic, but were never used for that purpose.&lt;ref name=":61"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/01/philberth-priests-probe-icy-moons-nuclear-waste/|title=These Priests' Invention Could Help Us Drill Into Icy Alien Worlds Someday|last=Fox|first=Douglas|date=22 January 2015|work=WIRED|access-date=11 November 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, they were adapted to use for glaciological research, reaching a depth of 1005 metres and sending temperature information back to the surface when tested in 1968 as part of the [[Expédition Glaciologique Internationale au Groenland]] (EGIG).&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 286–287.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philberth (1976), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because thermal probes support their weight on the ice at the bottom of the borehole, they lean slightly out of the vertical, and this means they have a natural tendency to stray away from a vertical borehole towards the horizontal.  Various methods have been proposed to address this.  A cone-shaped tip, with a layer of mercury above the tip, will cause additional heat transfer to the lower side of a slanting borehole, increasing the speed of melting on that side, and returning the borehole to the vertical.&lt;ref&gt;Philberth (1972), p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively the probe can be constructed to be supported by ice above its centre of gravity, by providing two heating rings, one of which is towards the top of the probe, and has a greater diameter than the rest of the probe.  Giving this upper ring a slightly lower heating power will cause the probe to have more bearing pressure on the upper ring, which will give it a natural tendency to swing back to vertical if the borehole starts to deviate.  The effect is called pendulum steering, by analogy with the tendency of a pendulum always to swing back towards a vertical position.&lt;ref&gt;Aamot (1967), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s [[NASA]] combined the Philberth probe design with ideas drawn from hot-water drills, to design a [[cryobot]] probe that had hot water jets in addition to a hotpoint nose.  Once the probe was submerged in a thin layer of meltwater, the water was drawn in and reheated, emerging at the nose as a jet.  This design was intended to help move particulate matter away from the nose, as a hot-water drill tends to.  A version with no analytical tools on board was built and field tested in [[Svalbard]], Norway, in 2001.  It penetrated to 23 m, successfully passing through layers of particulates.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryobots remain in good thermal contact with the surrounding ice throughout their descent, and in very cold ice this can drain a substantial fraction of their power budget, which is finite since they must carry their power source with them.  This makes them unsuitable for investigating the [[Martian polar ice caps|Martian polar ice cap]].  Instead, NASA added a pump to the cryobot design, to raise meltwater to the surface, so that the probe, known as the SIPR (for Subsurface Ice Probe) descends in a dry hole.  The lower [[gravity of Mars|gravity on Mars]] means that the overburden pressure on the ice cap is much less, and an open borehole is expected to be stable to a depth of 3&amp;nbsp;km, the expected depth of the ice cap.  The meltwater can then be analyzed at the surface.  Pumping through a vertical tube will cause mixing, so to ensure discrete samples for analysis at the surface, a large bore and a small bore tube are used; the small bore tube is used for sampling, and then its contents are allowed to return to the probe and are pumped back up the large bore tube for use in experiments that do not depend on stratigraphy, such as searches for living organisms.  Leaving the analytical instruments on the surface reduces the necessary size of the probe, which helps make this design more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Cardell et al. (2004), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the water transport tubes, a heated wire ensures that the water stays liquid all the way to the surface, and power and telemetry is also carried from the surface.  To keep the hole vertical the probe can sense when it is deviating, and the jets of hot water are adjusted to compensate.  The drill is expected to make use of solar power in operation, meaning it must be able to function on less than 100 W when in sunlight.  A fully built version of the probe was successfully tested in Greenland in 2006, drilling to a depth of 50 m.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;  NASA has proposed a similar designed for drilling in the ice on [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], a moon of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-tests-robotic-ice-tools|title=NASA Tests Robotic Ice Tools|last=Greicius|first=Tony|date=30 March 2017|access-date=25 February 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=NASA|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any such probe would have to survive temperatures of  500&amp;nbsp;°C while being sterilized to avoid biological contamination of the target environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilcox|first=B.

== Other drill types ==

=== Snow samplers ===
Snow samples are taken to measure the depth and density of the snow pack in a given area.  Measurements of depth and density can be converted into a [[snow water equivalent]] (SWE) number, which is the depth of water that would result from converting the snow into water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/or/snow/?cid=nrcs142p2_046155|title=What is Snow Water Equivalent? {{!}} NRCS Oregon|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nrcs.usda.gov|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Snow samplers are typically hollow cylinders, with toothed ends to help them penetrate the snow pack; they are used by pushing them into the snow, and then pulling them out along with the snow in the cylinder.&lt;ref name=":43"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Weighing the cylinder full of snow and subtracting the weight of the empty cylinder gives the snow weight; samplers usually have lengthwise slots to allow the depth of the snow to be recorded as well, though a sampler made of transparent material makes this unnecessary.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The sampler must grip the snow well enough to keep the snow inside the cylinder as it is removed from the snow, which is easier to accomplish with a smaller diameter cylinder; however, larger diameters give more accurate readings.  Samples must avoid compacting the snow, so they have smooth inner surfaces (usually of [[anodized aluminium]] alloy, and sometimes waxed in addition) to prevent the snow from gripping the sides of the cylinder as it is pushed in.  A sampler may penetrate light snow under its own weight; denser snow pack, firn, or ice, may require the user to rotate the sampler gently so that the cutting teeth are engaged.  Pushing too hard without successfully cutting a dense layer may cause the sample to push the layer down; this situation can be identified because the snow level inside the sampler will be lower than the surrounding snow.  Multiple readings are usually taken at each location of interest, and the results are averaged.  Snow samplers are usually accurate to within about 5–10%.&lt;ref name=":43" /&gt;

The first snow sampler was developed by J.E. Church in the winter of 1908/1909, and the most common modern snow sampler, known as the Federal snow sampler, is based on Church's design, with some modifications by [[George Dewey Clyde|George D. Clyde]] and the [[U.S. Soil Conservation Service]] in the 1930s.  It can be used for sampling snow up to 9 m in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Penetration testers ===
Penetration testing involves inserting a probe into snow to determine the snow's mechanical properties.  Experienced snow surveyors can use an ordinary ski pole to test snow hardness by pushing it into the snow; the results are recorded based on the change in resistance felt as the pole is inserted.  A more scientific tool, invented in the 1930s but still in widespread use, is a [[Cone penetration test|ram penetrometer]].  This takes the form of a rod with a cone at the lower end.  The upper end of the rod passes through a weight that is used as a hammer; the weight is lifted and released, and hits an anvil—a ledge around the rod which it cannot pass—which drives the rod into the snow.  To take a measurement, the rod is placed on the snow and the hammer is dropped one or more times; the resulting depth of penetration is recorded.  In soft snow a lighter hammer can be used to obtain more precise results; hammer weights range from 2&amp;nbsp;kg down to 0.1&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref name=":44"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with lighter hammers, ram penetrometers have difficulty distinguishing thin layers of snow, which limits their usefulness with regard to avalanche studies, since thin and soft layers are often involved in avalanche formation.&lt;ref name=":44" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two lightweight tools are in wide use that are more sensitive than ram penetrometers.  A snow micro-penetrometer uses a motor to drive a rod into snow, measuring the force required; it is sensitive to 0.01–0.05 newtons, depending on the snow strength.  A SABRE probe consists of a rod that is inserted manually into snow; accelerometer readings are then used to determine the penetrative force needed at each depth, and stored electronically.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":88" /&gt;

For testing dense polar snow, a cone penetrometer test (CPT) is use, based on the equivalent devices used for soil testing.  CPT measurements can be used in hard snow and firn to depths of 5–10 m.&lt;ref name=":45" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":88"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rotary auger rigs ===
[[File:24 inch ice auger US Navy 1967.png|thumb|165x165px|24-inch auger used by the US Navy in testing polar construction equipment in 1967]]
Commercially available rotary rigs have been used with large augers to drill in ice, generally for construction or for holes to gain access below the ice.  Although they are unable to produce cores, they have been intermittently used by US and Soviet scientific expeditions in the Antarctic.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 64–71.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, a [[British Antarctic Survey]] expedition to drill down to [[Lake Ellsworth (Antarctica)|Lake Ellsworth]], two miles below the surface of the Antarctic ice, used an Australian earth auger driven by a truck-mounted top drive to help drill two 300 m holes as part of the project, though in the event the project was delayed.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bas.ac.uk/media-post/antarctic-lake-mission-called-off/|title=PRESS RELEASE: Lake drill mission called off – News – British Antarctic Survey|last=BAS Press Office|first=|date=|website=www.bas.ac.uk|publisher=[[British Antarctic Survey]]|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegert et al. (2014), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powered augers designed to drill large holes through ice for winter fishing may be mounted on a snow vehicle, or a tractor or sled; hole diameters can be as high as 350&amp;nbsp;mm.  These rigs have been produced commercially in both the US and the USSR, but are no longer in common use.&lt;ref name=":79" /&gt;

=== Flame-jet drills ===
A flame-jet drill, more usually used to drill through crystalline rocks, was used to drill through ice on the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], in the 1970s.  The drill burns fuel oil, and can be run under water as long as enough compressed air is available.  It drills rapidly, but produces an irregular hole contaminated by soot and fuel oil.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vibratory drills ===
A Soviet-designed drill used a motor to provide vertical vibration to the barrel of the drill at 50&amp;nbsp;Hz; the drill had an outer diameter of 0.4 m, and in tests at [[Vostok Station]] in the Antarctic drilled a 6.5 m hole, with a 1.2 m drilling run taking between 1 and 5 minutes to complete.  The drill's steel edges compacted snow into the core, which helped it stick to the inside of the barrel when the drill was winched out of the hole.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Talalay (2016), pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morev &amp; Zagorodnov (1992), pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drilling system components ==

=== Cutters ===
[[File:Ice drill cutter geometric parameters.png|thumb|Geometric parameters for cutters|upright=2]]
Mechanical drills typically have three cutters, spaced evenly around the drill head.  Two cutters leads to vibration and poorer ice core quality, and tests of drillheads with four cutters have produced unsatisfactory performance.  Geometric design varies, but the relief angle, α, varies from 5–15°, with 8–10° the most common range in cold ice, and the cutting angle, {{Delta}}, varies from 45° (the most common in cold ice) up to 90°.  The safety angle, between the underside of the cutting blade and the ice, can be as low as 0.8° in successful drill designs.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2012), pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Different shapes for the end of the blade have been tried: flat (the most common design), pointed, rounded, and scoop shaped.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Talalay (2012), pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutters have to be made of extremely strong materials,&lt;ref name=":114" /&gt; and usually have to be sharpened after every 10–20 m of drilling.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  [[Tool steel]]s containing carbon are not ideal because the carbon makes the steel brittle in temperatures below −20&amp;nbsp;°C.  Sintered [[tungsten carbide]] has been suggested for use in cutters, since it is extremely hard, but the best tool steels are more cost effective: carbide cutters are fixed to the body of the cutting tool by [[cold pressing]] or brass soldering, and cannot easily be unmounted and sharpened in the field.&lt;ref name=":114"&gt;Talalay (2012), pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cutting depth is controlled by mounting shoes on the bottom of the drill head; these ride on the ice surface and so limit how deep the cutter can penetrate in each revolution of the drill.  They are most commonly mounted just behind the cutters, but this position can lead to ice accumulating in the gap between the cutter and the shoe.  So far it has not proved possible to correct this by modifying the shoe design.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2012), pp. 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Drilling fluids ===
Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit.  Fluids used include water, [[ethanol]]/water and water/[[ethylene glycol]] mixtures, [[petroleum]] fuels, [[Aromaticity|non-aromatic]] [[hydrocarbon]]s, and [[Butyl acetate|n-butyl acetate]].
* '''Water''' is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling.  In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically.&lt;ref name=":105"&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Ethanol and water'''.  Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling.  The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure.  Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises.  This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible.&lt;ref name=":59"&gt;Ueda (2002), pp. 133–135.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zagorodnov et al. (1998), pp. 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water.&lt;ref name=":59" /&gt;  A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53&amp;nbsp;°C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems.  A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks.&lt;ref name=":105" /&gt;
* '''Ethylene glycol and water''' was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Petroleum fuels'''.  This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene. They are inexpensive and easily available, and were once in common use; disadvantages include flammability and the aromatics they contain, which are a health hazard.&lt;ref name=":105" /&gt;
* '''Non-aromatic hydrocarbons'''.  As of 2009 these had become the most commonly used drilling fluids; eliminating the aromatics resolved the health issues with these fluids.  They are significantly more expensive than untreated petroleum fuels.&lt;ref name=":105" /&gt;
* '''n-Butyl acetate'''.  A widely used fuel in the 1990s, because it is a close match for the density of ice, this is now unpopular because it dissolves many materials, which prevents their use in the drilling equipment it comes in contact with.  It is also flammable and corrosive, and protective clothing and in some cases masks may be necessary for people exposed to it.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''ESTISOL-based fluids'''.  ESTISOL is an ester, like n-butyl acetate, but it has no health concerns.&lt;ref name=":109"&gt;Talalay (2014), p. 342.&lt;/ref&gt;
Densifiers are used in drilling fluids to adjust the density of the fluid to match the surrounding ice.  [[Perchloroethylene]] and [[trichloroethylene]] were often used in early drilling programs, in combination with petroleum fuels.  These have been phased out for health reasons.  [[Freon]] was a temporary replacement, but has been banned by the [[Montreal Protocol]], as has [[HCFC-141b]], a hydrochlorfluorocarbon densifier used once Freon was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley et al. (2009), pp. 294–295.&lt;/ref&gt;  Future options for drilling fluids include low molecular weight esters, such as [[ethyl butyrate]], [[Propyl propanoate|n-propyl propionate]], [[n-butyl butyrate]], [[Pentyl butyrate|n-amyl butyrate]] and [[hexyl acetate]]; mixtures of various kinds of ESTISOL; and [[Dimethylsiloxane|dimethyl siloxane]] oils.&lt;ref name=":109" /&gt;

=== Anti-torque ===
[[File:CRREL EM drill leaf springs and hinged friction blades.png|thumb|263x263px|Leaf springs and hinged friction blades on CRREL drill used to drill at [[Byrd Station]] in Antarctica from 1966 to 1968]]
The two main requirements of an anti-torque system are that it should prevent rotation of the sonde, and it should allow easy movement of the drill up and down the borehole.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Talalay et al. (2014), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;  Attempts have been made to design drills with counter-rotating components so that overall torque is minimized, but these have had limited success.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wehrle (1985), pp. 196–198.&lt;/ref&gt;  Five kinds of anti-torque systems have been devised for use with cable-suspended EM drills, though not all are in current use, and some drills have used a combination of more than one design.  The first drill to require an anti-torque system was used at Camp Century by CRREL in 1966; the drill incorporated a set of hinged friction blades that swung out from the sonde when the drill motor was started.  These were found to have very weak friction against the borehole wall, and were ineffective; the drill had to be controlled carefully to prevent twisting the cable.  No other drills have attempted to use this approach.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;Talalay et al. (2014), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the next deployment of the drill leaf springs were installed, and this has proved to be a more durable design.  These are mounted vertically, with a curve outwards so that they are easily compressed by the borehole wall, and can slide up and down with the movement of the drill.  They pass easily through any areas of irregularity in the borehole, but the edges of the springs cut into the borehole wall and prevent rotation.  Leaf springs are very simple mechanically, with the additional benefit of being easy to adjust by changing the spacing between the end points.  They can be placed anywhere on the drill that does not rotate, so they do not add length to the sonde.&lt;ref name=":111"&gt;Talalay et al. (2014), pp. 208–209.&lt;/ref&gt;  The shape is usually a fourth-order parabola, since this has been determined to provide the most even loading against the borehole wall.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reeh (1984), pp. 69–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Leaf springs have been found to be so effective that they can prevent rotation even in heavy drills running at full power.&lt;ref name=":111" /&gt;

Skate antitorque systems have blades attached to vertical bars which are pushed against the borehole wall; the blades dig into the wall and provide the anti-torque.  Skates can be built with springs which allow them to keep the blades pressed against the wall in an irregular borehole, and to prevent problems in narrower parts of the borehole.  Although skates are a popular design for anti-torque and have been used with success, they have difficulty preventing rotation in firn and at boundaries between layers of different densities, and can cause problems when drilling with high torque.  When they fail, they act as reamers, removing chips from the wall which can fall to the drillbit and interfere with drilling.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay et al. (2014), pp. 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ice drilling anti-torque devices.png|thumb|Five different anti-torque devices&lt;ref&gt;Talalay et al. (2014), p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;|left|upright=3]]
In the 1970s, the [[Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition]] (JARE) group designed several drills using side-mill cutters.  These are toothed gears that are driven from the rotation of the main drill motor via 45° [[spiral gear]]s; their axis of rotation is horizontal, and they are placed so that the teeth cut four vertical slots in the borehole wall.  Guide fins higher on the sonde travel in these slots and provide the antitorque.  The design was effective at preventing rotation of the sonde, but it proved to be almost impossible to realign the guide fins with the existing slots when tripping in.  Misalignment increased the chance of the drill getting stuck in the borehole; and there was also a risk of ice cuttings from the mill cutters jamming in between the drill and the borehole wall, causing the drill to get stuck.  The system was used again in a drill developed in China in the 1980s and 1990s, but the problems inherent in the design are now considered insuperable and it is no longer in use.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay et al. (2014), p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2016), p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent anti-torque system design is the use of U-shaped blades, made of steel and fixed vertically to the sides of the sonde.  Initial implementations ran into problems with thin blades bending too easily, and thick blades providing too much resistance to vertical movement of the sonde, but the final design can generate strong resistance to torque in both firn and ice.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay et al. (2014), pp. 210–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drills may be designed with more than one anti-torque system in order to take advantage of the different performance of the different designs in different kinds of snow and ice.  For example, a drill may have skates to be used in hard firn or ice, but also have a leaf-spring system, which will be more effective in soft firn.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Breaking and retaining cores ===
[[File:Core dogs schematic.png|thumb|Core dog in unengaged and engaged position&lt;ref name=":116" /&gt;|upright=1.5]]
In ice core drilling, when an annulus has been drilled around the core to be retrieved, the core is still attached to the ice sheet at its lower end, and this connection has to be broken before the core can be retrieved.  One option is to use a collet, which is a tapered ring inside the cutting head.  When the drill is pulled up, the collet compresses the core and holds it, with loose ice chips wedged in it increasing the compression.  This breaks the core and holds it in the barrel once it has broken.  Collets are effective in firn but less so in ice, so core dogs, also known as core catchers, are often used for ice cores.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A typical ice drill core dog has a dog-leg shape, and will be built into the drill head with the ability to rotate, and with a spring supplying some pressure against the core.  When the drill is lifted, the sharp point of the core dog engages and rotates around, causing the core to break.  Some core dogs have a shoulder to stop them from over-rotating.&lt;ref name=":113"&gt;Talalay (2012), pp. 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most drill heads have three core dogs, though having only two core dogs is possible; the asymmetric shearing force helps break the core.&lt;ref name=":113" /&gt;  The angle, {{Delta}}, between the core dog point and the core, has been the subject of some investigation; a study in 1984 concluded that the optimum angle was 55°, and a later study concluded that the angle should be closer to 80°.&lt;ref name=":116"&gt;Talalay (2012), pp. 29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;  Core catchers are made from hardened steel, and need to be as sharp as possible.  The force required to break the core varies with temperature and depth, and in warm ice the core dogs may gouge grooves up the core before they catch and it breaks.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2012), pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some drills may also include a weight that can be used as a hammer, to provide an impact to help in breaking the core.&lt;ref name=":86"/&gt;

For snow and firn, where the core material may be at risk of falling out of the bottom of the core barrel, a basket catcher is a better choice.  These catchers consist of spring wires or thin pieces of sheet metal, placed radially around the bottom of the core barrel and pressed against the side of the barrel by the core as the drill descends around it.  When the drill is lifted, the ends of the catcher engage with the core and break it from the base, and act as a basket to hold it in place while it is brought to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Talalay (2012), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Casing ===
Casing, or lining a hole with a tube, is necessary whenever drilling operations require that the borehole be isolated from the surrounding permeable snow and firn.  Uncased holes can be drilled with fluid by using a hose lowered into the hole, but this is likely to lead to increased drilling fluid consumption and environmental contamination from leaks.  Steel casing was used in the 1970s, but rust from the casing caused damage to the drills, and the casing was not sealed, leading to fluid leaks.  There were also problems with the casing tubes not being centered, which caused damage to the drill bit as it was lowered through the casing.  [[Fiberglass|Fibreglass]] and [[HDPE]] casing has become more common, with junctions sealed with [[PTFE tape]],  but leaks are frequent.  Heat fusion welding for HDPE casing is a possible solution.  To seal the bottom of the casing, water can be pumped to the bottom of the hole once the casing is set, or a thermal head can be used to melt ice around the casing shoe, creating a seal when the water freezes again.  Another approach is to use a hotpoint drill, saturating the snow and firn with melted water, which will then freeze and seal the borehole.&lt;ref name=":110"&gt;Talalay (2014), p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-temperature [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] tubing is not suitable for permanent casing, since it cannot be sealed at the bottom, but it can be used to pass drilling fluid through the permeable zone.  Its advantage is that it requires no connections since it can be coiled on a reel for deployment.&lt;ref name=":110" /&gt;

'''Immersive design''' describes the activity of a new generation of designers who work inclusively across all story-driven media, from [[film]] and [[interactive media]] to live audience environments. Immersive designers deal simultaneously with virtual and dimensional environments and who and what they contain; and with time-based [[narrative]] and story space.

[[Alex McDowell]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://websoles.com/ Design News - Reviewing fmx/08 Which Happened In Stuttgart, Germany - TAXI Design Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313055923/http://websoles.com/ |date=March 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&amp;code=3631a5a1&amp;atype=news&amp;id=23257 &gt;&gt; VFXWorld / News &lt;&lt;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; coined the phrase 'immersive design' in 2007 in order to frame a new discussion around a design discipline that uniquely addresses story-based media within the context of digital and virtual technologies. Together McDowell and museum director [[Chris Scoates]] co-directed [http://5dconference.com/ 5D | The Future of Immersive Design] conference in Long Beach 2008, laying the groundwork for immersive design to be a distinct [[design|design philosophy]] and thus be subject to wider scrutiny, development and promotion. 5D has since become a forum and community representing a broad range of cross-media designers with its intent based in education, cross-pollination and the development of an expanding knowledge base.

Having only been actively promoted as a [[design|design philosophy]] to be discussed internationally in recent years, immersive design is very much in its infancy, but as a term it has already been appropriated for the purposes of describing design for narrative media and the process of [[Worldbuilding]].  The rapid rise and recognition of transmedia and virtual production emphasises the need for immersive design as the single most fluid cross-media discipline.

==Characteristics==
The immersive design process attempts to describe two simultaneous entwined tasks:
* To design intact worlds that are coherent, have an interior logic, contain history, geography, surface, metaphor, respond to and drive narrative, and allow an audience to be fully immersed in both environment and story. By definition an immersive designer is engaged in the embedding of story into environment, whether for passive or interactive media, in virtual or physical worlds. 
* To put in place a non-linear immersive design process that provides a fully collaborative, often digital and virtual production environment for creators and the work that they are creating.

Many in the industry believe that it is recent developments in technology that have enabled both of these aspects of immersive design to exist; technology consisting of design tools that create a virtual workspace (an intuitive three-dimensional design language and vision) that allows for non-linear workflows, broadening the opportunity of what can be created. However, others argue that both of these aspects have always existed, believing that recent developments in technology have simply allowed these aspects to fit more easily into conventional mainstream production workflow. In relation to this, [[Alex McDowell]] has commented that "It is probably true to say that the designer has always harnessed the best tools available, but that the potential of design tools based in digital technology and allowing for the interaction and manipulation of dimensional space fundamentally advances the craft." {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

One issue within the philosophical discussion of immersive design is how much immersive design should define itself by new technology, and by doing so, whether it narrows down its own possibilities as well as broadening them. [[Alex McDowell]] expanded on this by commenting "What is clear is that technology will keep changing, and that the designer must become increasingly adept and adaptative while remaining focused on the creative intent." {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

An Independent Engineer, also known as the Lender's Engineer, is a term often given to the engineering representative of the lender, or financier, of a large capital project.  The key is to be independent so that opinions on the technical aspects of the project are not biased either in favor of the lenders or the developer/owners.  In order to maintain independence, the Independent Engineer is typically selected by the lender, but paid by the developer/owner. 

The role of the Independent Engineer is to provide an independent technical assessment of a project or technical due diligence.  The qualifications of an Independent Engineer are unusual in that in addition to understanding the engineering aspects of a project, the Independent Engineer must also be well versed in the business aspects of project financing.  This includes the assessment of the technical aspects of major contracts such as [[EPC Contracts]], [[Power Purchase Agreement]], Off-take Agreements, Long Term Service Agreements, O&amp;M Agreements, etc.  Furthermore, the Independent Engineer will review the technical inputs (i.e. output, efficiency, O&amp;M expenses, availability, etc.) to the financial model used by the lender and the developer/owner to justify the financing of the project.


== Scope of Work ==

While the role of the Independent Engineer is similar to an [[Owner's engineer]], they are distinctly different.  An Independent Engineer will deal with the lenders and legal counsel on a regular basis to evaluate the financial health of the project as well as the technical aspects.  Conversely, the Owner's Engineer is more often dealing directly with the engineer of record, the constructor, and equipment suppliers with a focus on ensuring that the technical details of the project meet the specifications.

Typical scopes of work for an Independent Engineer often include:
* Fatal flaw and/or technology reviews
* Project reviews to support project financing
** Review of the engineering design
** Assessment of project participants and the project site
** Technology review
** Contract reviews (non-legal)
** Operations and Maintenance review
** Environmental review
** Review of the technical inputs to the financial model
* Construction Monitoring
** Budget tracking and draw certifications
** Monitoring of equipment and material compliance with specifications
** Schedule and Budget Analysis
** Project completion review and completion certifications
* Performance Test Monitoring
* Annual operational and maintenance review

&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==
The process was developed by the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]].  In 1984–1987, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory operated a LLNL HRS process-based pilot pant at [[Parachute, Colorado]], with capacity of one tonne of oil shale per day.  In 1989, the pilot plant was upgraded to process four tonne of oil shale per day.  The pilot plant was operated till 1993.&lt;ref name=fossilenergy&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
As a heat carrier, LLNL HRS process uses [[spent oil shale]].  Raw oil shale and spent oil shale are mixed in the [[fluidized bed]] mixer. The use of fluidized bed mixer results in better mixture, which in turn increases the mean quantity of oil yield and oil shale throughput.  From the fluidized bed mixer oil shale moves downward to the packed-bed pyrolyzer. The heat is transferred from the heated spent oil shale to the raw oil shale causing [[pyrolysis]].  As a result, oil shale decomposes to [[shale oil]] vapors, [[oil shale gas]] and spent oil shale.  Oil vapors are collected from the pyrolyzer.  The spent oil shale, still including residual carbon ([[char]]), by the air pneumatic lift pipe to the delayed-fall [[combustor]] where it is combusted to heat the process.  The delayed-fall combustor used in this process gives greater control over the combustion process as compared to a lift pipe combustor. From the delayed-fall combustor the oil shale ash and spent shale falls into a fluidized bed classifier where the finest parts of solids are removed and hot spent shale is forwarded to the fluidized bed mixer.&lt;ref name=llnl2/&gt;&lt;ref name=llnl&gt;

{{Commons|Category:Mail chutes|Mail chutes}}
A '''mail chute''' is a largely defunct letter collection device used in early multi-storey office buildings, hotels, apartment buildings and other high rise structures. Letters were dropped from the upper storeys and collected (usually at the ground level) at a central depository by the postal service. This innovation was before the time of the modern "mail room" normally associated nowadays with high rise buildings. It was for the convenience of the users of the building so they would not have to take their mail to an outside [[letter box|mail box]] or to the post office.&lt;ref name ="postal4"&gt; {{cite web|url= http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/exhibits/2b1c1_cutler.html|title= National Postal Museum, a Smithsonian Institution museum - Cutler Mail Box &amp; Chute|accessdate= 2008-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original design and usage==
[[James Goold Cutler]] received {{US patent|284951}} on September 11, 1883 for the mail chute.&lt;ref name ="postal2"&gt; {{cite news|url= http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2003/04/01/341022/index.htm|title= CNNMoney article - Gone but Not (Quite) Forgotten|accessdate= 2008-09-19 | first=Maggie | last=Overfelt | date=2003-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first one was installed in 1884 in the [[Elwood Building]] in [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt; Cutler ultimately received thirty patents for variations of his invention. The original approved patent No. 284,951 design stated that it must "be of metal, distinctly marked '''U.S. Letter Box,'''" and that the "door must open on hinges on one side, with the bottom of the door not less than 2'6" above the floor." If the building were more than two [[storey|stories]] tall, the collection box was to be outfitted with a cushion to prevent injury to the mail. The mail chutes had to be accessible along its entire length so lodged mail could be removed.&lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt;

The first experimental "Cutler mail chute" device was successful at the Elwood Building so later it was installed in two New York City office buildings. Additional ones were then installed in railroad stations and some public buildings as a test. Eventually Cutler Mail Box produced over 1,600 such devices in buildings over the next twenty years.&lt;ref name ="postal2"/&gt; Then the postal service allowed "Cutler mail chutes" to be placed in hotels taller than five storeys. They were also installed in public apartment buildings of more than fifty apartments.&lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt;

It was announced on Sunday, May 9, 1909, by ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Cutler and Other Companies Join in a $2,000,000 Corporation".&lt;ref name ="postal1"&gt; {{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1909/05/09/archives/mail-chute-men-in-merger-cutler-and-other-companies-join-in-a.html|title= MAIL CHUTE MEN IN MERGER.; Cutler and Other Companies Join in a $2,000,000 Corporation.|accessdate= 2009-02-20 | work=The New York Times | date=1909-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible for clogs to form in a mail chute. &lt;ref name ="postal1"/&gt; For two weeks in 1986, more than 40,000 letters accumulated in the mail chute of the [[1221 Avenue of the Americas|McGraw-Hill Building]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=Clog&gt;{{cite news|last=Schneider|first=Daneil B.|title=F.Y.I.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/05/09/nyregion/fyi-583979.html|accessdate=7 November 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=9 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, a spokesperson for the New York district of the Postal Service claimed that the service responded to two or three calls to clear stuck mail chutes every week.&lt;ref name=Clog /&gt;

==Current use==
In more recent decades, buildings such as Chicago's [[John Hancock Center]], the [[Chrysler Building]], and the old [[General Electric Building|RCA Building]] in New York City have shut down their chutes.&lt;ref name ="postal2"/&gt; The reason is the increase of modern mail rooms in the building lobby with associated mail boxes available for the building tenants.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} There remain, however, about 360 buildings in Chicago with mail chutes, and more than 900 active chutes exist in [[Manhattan]] and [[the Bronx]] of New York City alone, as well as elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spencer|first1=Luke|title=New York City's Mail Chutes are Lovely, Ingenious and Almost Entirely Ignored|url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/new-york-citys-mail-chutes-are-lovely-ingenious-and-almost-entirely-ignored|website=Atlas Obscura|accessdate=5 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1997, however, the [[National Fire Protection Association]] has banned mail chutes in all new building construction. Buildings currently using mail chutes in New York include the Chanin Building, Trinity Building, Empire State Building, Port Authority Bus Terminal, and in Boston the historic [[The Lenox Hotel | Lenox Hotel]] in the Back Bay.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}   [[Image:IdahoBldgMailChute02026.JPG|thumb|widthpx|A Cutler mail chute, still in service as of 2010, in the lobby of the Idaho Building in downtown [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]].]]

==Other installations==
The London Transport HQ at [[55 Broadway]] had a system installed. The chute slot for 'London &amp; Abroad' mail plate says 'Cutler Mailing-System Cutler-Mail-Chute-Co Rochester,NY,USA'.(As shown BBC 'Art Deco Icons: London Transport' TV programme aired Nov 09.)
The 14-story Richmond Trust Company Building (629 E. Main St., Richmond, VA)[a.k.a. Southern States Building or Virginia Department of Environmental Health Building], completed in 1922, has an inactive Cutler mail chute system. Hotel Saskatchewan in Regina, Manitoba, Canada still has an operational mail cutler system. [[Stelco Tower]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada, completed in 1973, also has an operational mail chute; a rare example of a mail chute in a modern skyscraper.

'''Managed Mobility Services''' (MMS) is a term used by analysts and businesses to describe the outsourcing and managing services that many businesses provide.

Mobility Managed Services includes the [[IT]] and [[process management]] service needed for a company to acquire, provision and support [[smartphones]], [[Tablet computer|tablets]] and other field force devices. These services are designed to support devices for corporations are liable and provide a level of control to companies that support them by accessing corporate resources and information.

Managed Mobility Services has existed for some time, but organizations have increasingly shifted responsibility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robbie Westacott |url=http://www.enterprisemobilityexchange.com/eme-byod/articles/the-managed-mobility-services-market-could-reach-11billion-by-2019/ |title=The Managed Mobility Services Market Could Reach $11.05 Billion by 2019 by Robbie Westacott |publisher=Enterprisemobilityexchange.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; for logistics and management as the environments have become more diverse and updates more frequent. [[Android fragmentation]] is sometimes cited as a driver of this growth as is the consumerization of IT, including the adoption of mobile devices by IT departments. This accumulation of influences has been referred to as "The 3 V's": Volume (the number of devices and users involved); Variety (policy changes in order to fit changing standards) and Volatility (high rates of change that could threaten the business).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/3Vs |title=What is 3Vs (volume, variety and velocity) ? - Definition from WhatIs.com |publisher=Whatis.techtarget.com |date=2012-07-24 |accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Included service categories==
[[Gartner]] includes the following categories of services:
* Sourcing and logistics management
* Mobile service management
* Device and system management
* Application and collaboration management
* Security and content management
* Program and financial management

==History==
Gartner first officially produced research on MMS in 2011 with Critical Capabilities for Managed Mobility Services, 22 December 2011, G00225198 Analyst(s): Eric Goodness, Phillip Redman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gartner.com/document/1882717 Gartner Critical Capabilities for Managed Mobility Services]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-935.ibm.com/services/uk/en/it-services/pdf/Gartner_Report_-_Critical_Capabilities_for_Managed_Mobility_services.pdf Gartner Critical Capabilities for Managed Mobility Services PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then Gartner, [[Forrester Research]], [[GigaOM]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/mobility-managed-services-mms |title=Mobility Managed Services (MMS) - Gartner IT Glossary |publisher=Gartner.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gigaom.com/2014/07/06/why-managed-mobility-services-are-on-the-rise-with-tech-buyers/ GigaOM Blog on MMS]&lt;/ref&gt; and other analyst organizations have published research on these services, each with slight variations on what services are included.

NASA, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the information obtained will help address future human exploration objectives, as dust sizes and shapes, daily weather report and information on the radiation and wind patterns on Mars, that are critical for proper design of [[in situ resource utilization]] systems.&lt;ref name='Tamppari 2015'/&gt;&lt;ref name='MEDA specs'/&gt; MEDA is a follow-on project from REMS, of the [[Curiosity rover|''Curiosity'' rover mission]].&lt;ref name="hou.usra.edu"&gt;[https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2014/pdf/2837.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; MEDA has an increased scope, with greater data collection on Mars dust which contributes to overall Mars program objectives and discovery goals.&lt;ref name="hou.usra.edu"/&gt;

The instrument suite is being developed and provided by the Astrobiology Center at the [[Spanish National Research Council]] in [[Madrid, Spain]]. The Principal Investigator is José Antonio Rodríguez Manfredi.

==Overview==

Dust dominates Mars' weather the way that water dominates Earth's weather. Martian weather cannot be predicted unless dust behavior is studied and understood in the weather context.&lt;ref name='MEDA specs'/&gt;&lt;ref name='J Manfredi 2016'&gt;[https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/ipm2016/pdf/4114.pdf MEDA, THE ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMICS ANALYZER FOR MARS 2020] (PDF). J. A. Rodriguez-Manfredi,
M. de la Torre, J. S. Boland, et al.  3rd International Workshop on Instrumentation for Planetary Missions (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; MEDA is a suite of environmental sensors designed to record dust optical properties and six atmospheric parameters: [[wind speed]]/[[Wind direction|direction]], [[air pressure|pressure]], relative [[humidity]], air [[temperature]], ground temperature, and [[radiation]] (UV, visible, and IR ranges of the spectrum).&lt;ref name='MEDA specs'/&gt;&lt;ref name='science MEDA'&gt;[https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/instruments/meda/for-scientists/ Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA)]. ''Mars 2020 Rover'', NASA. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology used on MEDA was inherited from the [[Rover Environmental Monitoring Station|REMS]] package operating on the [[Curiosity rover|''Curiosity'' rover]] and the TWINS package on [[InSight]] lander.&lt;ref name='Tamppari 2015'/&gt;  The sensors are located on the rover's mast and on the deck, front and interior of the rover's body.  It records data whether the rover is active or not, at both day and night.&lt;ref name='science MEDA'/&gt; The instruments will collect data for 5 minutes every 30 minutes.&lt;ref name='J Manfredi 2016'/&gt;

'''Microcosm Ltd''' is a [[UK]] company established in 1979. Its early claims to fame included [[Silicon Disk System]] in 1981 and Microcache (the world's first disk cache for microcomputers) in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cheesewright, [https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2581237 Microcomputers Come of Age]. ''The Journal of the Operational Research Society'', 32(10):932–933, October 1981. {{doi|10.2307/2581237}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Since 1989, it has concentrated on computer security, firstly with CopyControl (a software-based copy protection system), then Dinkey [[Dongle]] (small hardware copy protection keys that connect to [[parallel port|parallel]] or [[USB port]]s). In 2005, it produced CopyMinder (software-based copy protection that uses the [[Internet]] where possible to provide an 'intelligent' copy protection system). More recently, it has expanded its security products by producing SmartSign, a multi-factor authentication system that supports using mobile devices to control access to web pages.

'''Mormyshka''' (or Mormishka, or Marmooska, {{lang-ru|мормышка}}) is a sort of [[fishing lure]] or a [[Jig (fishing)|jig]]. The word is derived from Russian word Mormysh ({{lang-ru|мормыш}}) meaning Freshwater Shrimp (Gammarus).

Mormyshka was invented in the 19th century in [[Russia]]. The prototypes were big [[spoon lures]] used for ice fishing. Trying to imitate shrimps, anglers made lures smaller and changed the way of fixing them on the line. As a result, efficient lures appeared and were spread quickly among ice fishermen all around Russia and Scandinavia.

Mormyshka consists of a metallic head, often made of [[tungsten]], and a hook soldered in it. There is a small vertical hole in the middle of the head where the line passes through.
[[Image:mormyshka knot.gif|thumb|right]]

The way to knot Mormyshka to the line is unusual, but is not difficult. The line is put through the hole and tied to the hook.
When suspended, Mormyshka keeps an almost horizontal position, and the point of the hook is above its shank.

Some mormyshkas have a Bead Head on the hook.

In contrast to Jig Heads, original Russian Mormyshka jigs have no up eye;
Mormyshkas are not always globe-shaped. There are many forms that provide different presentations to fish;
Usually, high quality Mormyshka is not painted, but coated or plated with Nickel, Brass, Copper, Gold, Silver, or combination of two metals, that provides better attraction to fish.

For the past few years Mormyshka has been used in summer fishing as well with long poles and a float or a nod. It is used either with live bait or alone. Also, anglers use palmers tied on Mormyshkas.

'''Oil depletion''' is the decline in oil production of a well, [[oil field]], or geographic area.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/oiaf/servicerpt/depletion/ Accelerated depletion]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hubbert peak theory]] makes predictions of production rates based on prior discovery rates and anticipated production rates.  [[Hubbert curve]]s predict that the production curves of non-renewing resources approximate a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]]. Thus, according to this theory, when the [[peak oil|peak of production]] is passed, production rates enter an irreversible decline.&lt;ref name=mkinghubbert1956&gt;{{cite web

{{Main|Oil reserves}}

The [[World]]'s natural oil supply is fixed because petroleum is [[Formation of petroleum|naturally formed]] far too slowly to be replaced at the rate at which it is being extracted.  Over many millions of years, [[plankton]], [[bacteria]], and other plant and animal matter became buried in sediments on the ocean floor.  When conditions were right – a lack of oxygen for decomposition, and sufficient depth and temperature of burial – these organic remains were converted into petroleum compounds, while the sediment accompanying them was converted into sandstone, siltstone, and other porous sedimentary rock.  When capped by impermeable rocks such as shale, salt, or igneous intrusions, they formed the petroleum reservoirs which are exploited today.&lt;ref name="national_geographic"&gt;{{cite journal

==Production decline models==
{{Main|Hubbert peak theory}}
For the short and medium-term, oil production decline occurs in a predictable manner based on geological circumstances, governmental policies, and engineering practices. The shape of the decline curve varies depending upon whether one considers a well, a field, or a set of fields.  In the longer term, technological developments have defied some of the predictions.

===Oil well production decline===
[[File:Theoretical Oil Well Production Curve.png|thumb|150px|right|Theoretical oil production curve for a well with exponential decline]]
An individual oil well usually produces at its maximum rate at the start of its life; the production rate eventually declines to a point at which it no longer [[EROEI|produces profitable amounts]]. The shape of the decline curve depends on the oil reservoir and the reservoir drive mechanism. Wells in water-drive and gas-cap drive reservoirs often produce at a near constant rate until the encroaching water or expanding gas cap reaches the well, causing a sudden decline in oil production. Wells in gas solution drive and oil expansion drive reservoirs have exponential or hyperbolic declines: rapid declines at first, then leveling off.&lt;ref&gt;Norman J. Hyne, [https://books.google.com/books?id=qf9fRjos578C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:norman+inauthor:j+inauthor:hyne&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=epSuUfOFDIXe8ASYtoGoBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Nontechnical Guide to Petroleum Geology''] (Tulsa: PennWell, 2012) 435-437.&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape of production curve of an oil well can also be affected by a number of nongeologic factors:
:* Well may be restricted by choice by lack of [[supply and demand|market demand]] or government [[regulation]]. This decreases the rate of decline, but will not change the well's total production significantly.
:* [[Hydraulic fracturing]] (fracking) or [[hydrochloric acid#Other applications|acidizing]] may be used to cause a sharp spike in production, and may increase the recoverable reserves of a given well.
:* The field may undergo a secondary or [[enhanced oil recovery|tertiary recovery]] project, discussed in the next section.

===Oil field production decline===
Individual oil wells are typically within multi-well [[oil field]]s. As with individual wells, the production curves for oil fields vary depending on geology and how they are developed and produced. Some fields have symmetric bell-shaped production profiles, but it is more common that the period of inclining production is briefer and steeper than the subsequent decline. More than half the production usually occurs after a field has reached a peak or plateau.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Miller and others, [http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/Global+Oil+Depletion%3A+Technical+Papers ''Decline Rates and Depletion Rates''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111120046/http://www.ukerc.ac.uk/support/Global+Oil+Depletion%3A+Technical+Papers |date=2013-11-11 }}, UK Energy Research Centre, Tech Report 4, of "Review of Evidence for Global Oil depletion".&lt;/ref&gt; Production profiles of many fields show distinct peaks, but for giant oil fields, it is more common for production to reach and maintain a plateau before declining. Once a field declines, it usually follows an exponential decline.&lt;ref&gt;Mikael Hook, May 2009, [http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:338111/FULLTEXT01 ''Depletion and Decline Curve Analysis in Crude Oil Production''], Licentiate Thesis, Department for Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University, p.70.&lt;/ref&gt; As this decline levels off, production can continue at relatively low rates. A number of oil fields in the U.S. have been producing for over 100 years.&lt;ref name="McClintock No. 1 oil well"&gt;[http://www.pennenergy.com/index/petroleum/display/0991555867/articles/pennenergy/petroleum/exploration/2011/08/pennsylvania-oil_well.html] Pennenergy.com history for McClintock No. 1 oil well which began first producing oil in August 1861.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Florence Oil Field"&gt;[http://www.niobraranews.net/how-much-oil/] Florence Field, near Canon City, Colorado, was discovered in 1876.&lt;/ref&gt;

Oil field production curves can be modified by a number of factors:
:* Production may be restricted by market conditions or government regulation.
:* A secondary recovery project, such as [[water injection (oil production)|water]] or gas injection, can repressurize the field and increase the total recovery. 
:* the field may undergo an [[enhanced oil recovery]] project, such as drilling of wells for injection of [[solvent]]s, [[carbon dioxide]], or [[steam]]. This allows more oil to be coaxed out of the rock, increasing the ultimate production of the field.

===Multi-field production decline===
[[File:Theoretical Multiple Oil Field Production Curve.png|thumb|150px|right|Hubbert-theory graph of multiple oil field production]]
Most oil is found in a small number of very large oil fields. According to Hubbert peak theory, production starts off slowly, rises faster and faster, then slows down and flattens until it reaches a peak, after which production declines. In the late stage, production often enters a period of exponential decline in which the decline becomes less and less steep. Oil production may never actually reach zero, but eventually becomes very low.
Factors which can modify this curve include:
:* Inadequate demand for oil, which reduces steepness of the curve and pushes its peak into the future.
:* Sharp price increases when the production peak is reached, as production fails to meet demand. If price increases cause a sharp drop in demand, a dip in the top of the curve may occur.
:* Development of new drilling technology or marketing of [[unconventional oil]] can reduce the steepness of the decline as more oil is produced than initially anticipated.

Oil production in the [[United States]], provided one excludes Alaska, began by following the theoretical Hubbert curve for a few decades but is now deviating strongly from it. U.S. oil production reached a peak in 1970 and by the mid-2000s it had fallen to 1940s levels. In 1950, the United States produced over half the world's oil, but by 2005 that proportion had dropped to about 8%. In 2005, U.S. crude oil imports peaked at a rate twice as high as domestic production; since then, U.S. oil production has increased, and imports have fallen 41%.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&amp;s=MTTNTUS2&amp;f=A US net imports of crude oil].&lt;/ref&gt;

The production peak in 1970 was predicted by one of the two projections put forward in 1956 by Hubbert. By 1972 all import quotas and controls on U.S. domestic production had been removed. Despite this, and despite the quadrupling of prices during the [[1973 oil crisis]], the production decline was not reversed in the lower 48 states until 2009. Crude oil production has since risen sharply from 2009 through 2014, so that the rate of US oil production in October 2014 was 81% higher than the average rate in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration, [http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_crd_crpdn_adc_mbbl_a.htm US crude oil production].&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual U.S. production curve deviates from Hubbert's 1956 curve in significant ways:
:* When oil surpluses created a glut on the market and low prices began causing demand and production curves to rise, regulatory agencies such as the [[Texas Railroad Commission]] stepped in to restrain production.&lt;ref name="national_geographic" /&gt;
:* The curve peaked at a higher rate and sharper point than predicted. 
:* Production fell after 1970, but started to recover and reached a lower secondary peak in 1988. This occurred because the supergiant [[Prudhoe Bay Oil Field|Prudhoe Bay]] field in Alaska was only discovered in 1968, and the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] (TAPS) was not completed until 1977.  After 1988, Alaska production peaked and  total U.S. production began to decline again.  By 2005, Prudhoe Bay had produced over 75% of its oil.
:* Production increases in the 2010s

===World oil production===
{{Further|Peak oil}}
[[File:World Oil Production 1960 to 2005.png|thumb|left|World oil field production curve]]
The 1970 production peak in the U.S. caused many people to begin to question when the world production peak would occur.  The peak of world production is known as [[Peak oil]].

==Implications of a world peak==
{{main|Implications of peak oil}}

A [[Peak oil|peak]] in oil production could result in a worldwide oil shortage, or it could not even be noticed as demand decreases in conjunction with increased prices. While past shortages stemmed from a temporary insufficiency of supply, crossing Hubbert's Peak would mean that the production of oil would continue to decline, and that demand for these products must be reduced to meet supply. The effects of such a shortage would depend on the rate of decline and the development and adoption of effective alternatives.

===Catastrophe===
The use of fossil fuels allows humans to participate in takedown, which is the consumption of energy at a greater rate than it is being replaced. The industrial economy is currently heavily dependent on oil as a fuel and chemical feedstock.  For example, over 90% of transportation in the United States relies on oil.

Since the 1940s, [[agriculture]] has dramatically increased its productivity, due largely to the use of chemical [[pesticide]]s, fertilizers, and increased mechanisation. This process has been called the [[Green Revolution]]. The increase in food production has allowed world population to grow dramatically over the last 50 years. Pesticides rely upon oil as a critical ingredient, and fertilizers require natural gas.  Farm machinery also requires oil.

Most or all of the uses of fossil fuels in agriculture can be replaced with alternatives.  For example, by far the biggest fossil fuel input to agriculture is the use of natural gas as a hydrogen source for the [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch]] fertilizer-creation process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbohydrateeconomy.org/library/admin/uploadedfiles/How_Much_Energy_Does_it_Take_to_Make_a_Gallon_.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060624111423/http://www.carbohydrateeconomy.org/library/admin/uploadedfiles/How_Much_Energy_Does_it_Take_to_Make_a_Gallon_.html |date=June 24, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural gas is used simply because it is the cheapest currently available source of hydrogen; were that to change, other sources, such as [[electrolysis]] powered by [[solar energy]], could be used to provide the hydrogen for creating fertilizer without relying on fossil fuels.

Oil shortages may force a move to lower input "[[organic agriculture]]" methods, which may be more [[labour (economics)|labor]]-intensive and require a population shift from urban to rural areas, reversing the trend towards [[urbanisation]] which has predominated in industrial societies; however, some organic farmers using modern organic-farming methods have reported yields as high as those available from conventional farming, but without the use of fossil-fuel-intensive artificial fertilizers or pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biotech-info.net/Alex_Avery.html |title=Realities of organic farming |publisher=Biotech-info.net |date=2000-07-03 |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/researchreports/nk01ltar.pdf Comparison of Organic and Conventional Corn, Soybean, Alfalfa, Oats, and Rye Crops at the Neely-Kinyon LTAR Site-2001]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/~christos/articles/cv_organic_farming.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060127013201/http://www.cnr.berkeley.edu/~christos/articles/cv_organic_farming.html |date=January 27, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terradaily.com/news/farm-05c.html |title=Organic Farms Use Less Energy And Water |publisher=Terradaily.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible effect would derive from modern transportation and housing infrastructure. A large proportion of the developed world's population live in [[suburbs]], a type of low-density settlement designed with the [[automobile]] in mind.  A movement to deal with this problem early, called "[[New Urbanism]]," seeks to develop the suburbs into higher density neighborhoods and use high density, mixed-use forms for new building projects.

===Recession===
A more modest scenario, assuming a slower rate of depletion or a smoother transition to alternative energy sources, could still cause substantial economic hardship such as a [[recession]] or [[economic depression|depression]] due to higher energy prices.{{citation needed|date = April 2013}}  [[Inflation]] has also been linked to oil price spikes.  However, economists disagree on the strength and causes of this association. See [[Energy crisis]].

===Rising food prices===

{{Main|food vs fuel}}
Rising oil prices cause rising food prices in three ways. First, increased equipment fuel costs drive higher prices. Second, transportation costs increase retail prices. Third, higher oil prices are causing farmers to switch from producing food crops to producing [[biofuel]] crops.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article.php?a_id=119281 Food versus fuel debate escalates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=5077 How Food and Fuel Compete for Land by Lester Brown – The Globalist - Global Energy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112174512/http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=5077 |date=January 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[law of supply and demand]] predicts that if fewer farmers are producing food the price of food will rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/research/articlesBySubject/displaystory.cfm?subjectid=7216688&amp;story_id=10252015 | title= The Economist – The End Of Cheap Food | date=December 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Replacement==
An alternative considered likely by some is that oil will be replaced with [[renewable energy]] during the first half of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=a-path-to-sustainable-energy-by-2030 A Plan to Power 100 Percent of the Planet with Renewables]&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement [[fuel]] would likely be [[hydrogen]]. A [[hydrogen economy]] would then replace the current oil-based economy. Another possible replacement fuel is [[Sewage gas|biogas]], which is composed of [[methane]]. Methane has boiling point of −161&amp;nbsp;°C, rather than hydrogen's -252.87&amp;nbsp;°C, making methane a much easier fuel to condense.

Other people consider that the whole idea of "the hydrogen economy" is flawed. Compressed hydrogen has an [[energy density]] of only 5.6 megajoules per liter.  Robert Zubrin looks at the practical problems of using hydrogen as an energy storage medium in ''Energy Victory: Winning the War on Terror by Breaking Free of Oil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|1-59102-591-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers that hydrogen is a very poor form of storage, and that [[battery (electricity)|batteries]], [[methanol]] or [[dimethyl ether]] would be better.  This point is reiterated in ''Beyond Oil and Gas: The Methanol Economy''&lt;ref&gt;by George A Olah, Aiain Goeppert, G. K. Surya Prakash, {{ISBN|978-3-527-64463-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in David MacKay's book described below.

[[Geothermal electricity|Geothermal power]] is one source of sustainable energy that can produce hydrogen.  Note that David MacKay has shown in his book ''Sustainable Energy: Without the Hot Air''&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0-9544529-3-3}}, chapter 16&lt;/ref&gt; that geothermal can only provide a tiny fraction of the world's needs sustainably.  In some areas located over [[geological hotspot]]s (such as Iceland), geothermal makes more sense.

[[sun|Solar]] energy is a source of inexhaustible energy. There is more solar energy that reaches the surface of the Earth each hour than the amount of energy consumed by the world in a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarenergy-facts.org/ Solar Energy Facts]&lt;/ref&gt; The challenges of using the [[sun]]'s energy – energy which can be obtained either from [[wind power]] or from [[solar power]] – is that the energy needs to either be (1) stored in physical form of fuel for when it can be used in the future, or (2) transported directly as electricity, through transmission lines. Neither is [[Dispatchable generation|dispatchable]], as there is no control over when the sun will shine or when the wind will blow. There are, however, [[concentrated solar power]] plants using thermal storage that can store energy efficiently for up to 24 hours.

'''Omni Processor''' is a name proposed by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] for a group of physical, biological or chemical treatment processes to process [[septage|fecal sludge]] – a mixture of human [[excreta]] and water – in developing countries. One of the main treatment aims is [[pathogen]] removal to stop the spread of disease from fecal sludge. The term was created by staff of the Water, Sanitation, Hygiene Program at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Kuchenrither, R. D., Stone, L., Haug, R. T. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1640 Omni-Processor Landscaping Project]. Consultancy report by WERF (Water Environment Research Foundation), commissioned by Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA&lt;/ref&gt; It is not a trade mark for one specific product or technology. Several research teams are currently developing various types of omni processors with funding from the foundation. Examples of technologies which Omni Processors may employ include [[combustion]], [[supercritical water oxidation]] and [[pyrolysis]].

The term "omni" in its name refers to the fact that an Omni Processor machine can process a variety of waste streams or fuel sources.

== Background and aims ==
Since 2012, the  Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has been funding research into what they have named "Omni Processors". An Omni Processor (OP) is any of various types of technologies that treat fecal sludge, also known as [[septage]]. The aim of the treatment is to remove all [[pathogens]] and at the same time to generate outputs of commercial value. These beneficial products can be energy and soil nutrients and might have the potential to allow a development of local business and revenue.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The soil nutrients could be used as a form of [[reuse of excreta]] in agriculture. The Omni Processor program targets community scale solutions that may combine fecal sludge and [[solid waste]] processing. It complements the foundation's [[pit latrine]] emptying ("Omni-Ingestor") and "Reinvent the Toilet" investment programs.

== Challenges ==
The Omni Processor is targeted as a solution for [[developing countries]], although challenges around technical and financial aspects remain.&lt;ref name="WA"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wateraid.org/news/news/gates-drinks-water-made-from-faeces|title = Gates drinks water made from faeces – and so do you!|date = 9 January 2015|accessdate = 13 January 2015|website = WaterAid UK|publisher = Rémi Kaupp|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Omni Processors and Omni Ingestors are being designed to provide an alternative to [[sewerage]] system-based technologies. They are also intended to address the large number of existing [[pit latrine]]s which lack a supporting infrastructure of fecal sludge collection and processing when the pits are full. Sludge from pit latrines has to be removed from the pits for treatment and disposal either by pumping (if the fecal sludge is sufficiently liquid) or by manual emptying with shovels or other devices (in India, this practice is called [[manual scavenging]]). Despite new low-cost pumps being developed, only a small fraction of sludge is safely extracted and treated currently in many African and Asian cities.&lt;ref name="WA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsp.org/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/WSP-Fecal-Sludge-12-City-Review-Research-Brief.pdf|title=The Missing Link in Sanitation Service Delivery, A Review of Fecal Sludge Management in 12 Cities|date=April 2014|publisher=WSP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It will be necessary to adapt established technologies in ways to fit [[developing world]] communities. The success of such technologies will depend on how well the process is managed.

== Examples ==

=== Janicki Bioenergy ===
[[File:IJANICKI OMNI PROCESSOR.jpg|thumb|Omni Processor (sewage sludge treatment system using combustion) at Janicki Bioenergy’s headquarters in the U.S.]]
The U.S.-based company Janicki Bioenergy presented in 2014 a prototype using [[combustion]]. Their process is a [[sewage sludge treatment]] system that produces drinking water and electrical energy as end products from [[sewage sludge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://janickibioenergy.com/s100.html|title = Omni Processor - S100|date = |accessdate = 8 May 2015|website = |publisher = Janicki Bioenergy|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150109083138/http://janickibioenergy.com/s100.html|archivedate = 9 January 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufactured by Janicki Bioenergy, the proof of concept model was funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The S100 prototype model can produce 10,800 liters of drinking water per day and 100&amp;nbsp;kW net electricity.  A larger model under development, the S200, is designed to handle the waste from 100,000 people, produce 86,000 litres of drinking water per day and 250&amp;nbsp;kW net output electricity.  These systems are designed to provide a "self-sustaining [[bioenergy]]" process.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30709273|title=BBC news article "Bill Gates drinks water distilled from human faeces"|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.gatesnotes.com/Development/Omniprocessor-From-Poop-to-Potable|title = From poop to portable, This Ingenious Machine Turns Feces Into Drinking Water|date = 5 January 2015|accessdate = 13 January 2015|website = gatesnotes, The Blog of Bill Gates|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment process first involves boiling the [[sewage sludge]], during which water vapour is boiled off and recovered. A dry sludge is left behind which is then combusted as fuel to heat a boiler. This boiler produces steam and the heat necessary for the boiling process. The steam is then used to generate electrical energy. Some of this electrical energy is used for the final water [[reverse osmosis]] purification stages to produce safe drinking water, and to power ancillary pumps, fans and motors.

A pilot project of Janicki Bioenergy's Omniprocessor was installed in Dakar, Senegal, in 2015 and can now treat the fecal sludge of 50,000-100,000 people.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-37981485|title=The firms turning poo into profit|last=|first=|date=16 November 2016|website=|publisher=BBC News Business Section|access-date=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Climate Foundation ===
The U.S.-based [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] Climate Foundation, in collaboration with Stanford University, has built several pilot-scale reactors to treat human waste and turn it into [[biochar]], which can be used as an agricultural soil amendment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conversion of human waste into biochar using pyrolysis at a community-scale facility in Kenya - Various documents on results from research grant|url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1832|website = www.susana.org|accessdate = 2015-06-26|publisher = Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (library)|year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Duke University ===
[[File:Container 6 2015.JPG|thumb|Pilot Omni Processor for fecal sludge treatment by supercritical oxidation at Duke University, U.S.]]

(2013). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1819 Neighborhood-scale treatment of fecal sludge by supercritical oxidation] - Various documents on results from research grant. Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unilever ===
Unilever PLC in the United Kingdom is developing a [[pyrolysis]]-based fecael sludge treatment unit designed to serve over 2000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.oyaproject.com/|title = Oya project - community waste treatment|date = |accessdate = 8 May 2015|website = |publisher = Unilever, UK|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related research efforts ==
The Omni Processor initiative for processing [[Septage|fecal sludge]] is being complemented by an effort to develop new technologies for improved pit latrine emptying (called by the Gates Foundation the “Omni Ingestor”&lt;ref&gt;Frederick, R., Gurski, T. (2012). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1718 Synapse Dewatering Investigation Report - Omni-Ingestor Phase 2, Milestone 1]. Consultancy report by Synapse (USA) commissioned by Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Seattle, USA&lt;/ref&gt;) and by the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge. The latter is a long-term research and development effort to develop a hygienic, stand-alone toilet. It is focused on "reinventing the [[flush toilet]]". The aim is to create a toilet that not only removes [[pathogen]]s from human excreta, but also [[resource recovery|recovers resources]] such as energy, clean water, and nutrients (a concept also known as [[reuse of excreta]]). It should operate “off the grid” without connections to water, sewer, or electrical networks. Finally, it should cost less than 5 US-cents per user per day.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Radke, N., Spuhler, D.

The '''Open Solutions Alliance''' (OSA) is a trade association. The OSA works with  [[Independent software vendor|ISV]]s, system integrators, and the broader [[open source software]] community to improve interoperability among [[Computer software|software]] products by publishing [[best practice]]s, promoting [[technical standard]]s, and making tools and [[application programming interface]]s available.

==History==
In early November 2006, a group of [[Application software|application]] [[Software developer|developer]]s got together to form an alliance dedicated to improving interoperability and awareness of their products. Open source development had proven itself at the operating system and middleware layers but had yet to make a significant impact at the application level. Founders identified three important areas where collective action could be successful in lowering barriers to adoption of open solutions by business users:

* Define and promote guidelines and best practices for interoperability between applications.
* Foster a multivendor metacommunity of users, developers, and systems integrators.
* Drive awareness and advocacy 

All of those present agreed that none of these challenges could be readily addressed by any one vendor in isolation. Issues of awareness, interoperability and community are inherently collective in nature, such that collective action is needed to address them. This led to the decision to create a [[Industry trade group|trade association]]. The result was the OSA.

In December 2006, The Open Solutions Alliance was incorporated as a 501c6 in the State of California, and the initial founding members officially joined during January 2007.

==Members==
Notable members of OSA include [[Palamida]], [[Computer Sciences Corporation|CSC]], [[Concursive|Concursive Corporation]], [[Ingres (database)|Ingres Corporation]], [[IONA Technologies|IONA]], [[JasperReports|Jaspersoft]], [[Openbravo]], [[SourceForge|SourceForge.net]], and [[Unisys]].

'''Oxyhydrogen''' is a mixture of [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gases. This gaseous mixture is used for torches to process [[refractory]] materials and was the first&lt;ref&gt;

This mixture may also be referred to as '''''{{lang|de|Knallgas}}''''' (Scandinavian and German [[wikt:Knallgas|Knallgas]]: "bang-gas"), although some authors define knallgas to be a generic term for the mixture of fuel with the precise amount of oxygen required for complete combustion, thus 2:1 oxyhydrogen would be called "hydrogen-knallgas".&lt;ref&gt;W. Dittmar, "Exercises in quantitative chemical analysis", 1887, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ayFDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA189 p. 189] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627184941/http://books.google.com/books?id=ayFDAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA189 |date=2014-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Brown's gas''' refers to oxyhydrogen with a 2:1 [[molar concentration|molar ratio]] of [[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] gases, the same proportion as in [[Water (molecule)|water]]. It was named after its Bulgarian inventor Yull Brown (born Iliya Valkov, {{lang-bg|Илия Георгиев Вълков}}), who suggested it to be produced by the [[electrolysis]] of water to be used as a fuel for the [[internal combustion engine]].&lt;ref&gt;"Brown's Gas", ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'', January 16, 1977 ([http://www.rexresearch.com/hyfuel/ybrown/4014777.htm text online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220161815/http://www.rexresearch.com/hyfuel/ybrown/4014777.htm |date=2016-12-20 }})&lt;/ref&gt;  Later "Brown's gas" and '''HHO''' has become a [[fringe science]] term for a 2:1 mixture of oxyhydrogen obtained under certain special conditions; its proponents claim that it has special properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eagle-research.com/browngas/myth/myth.php|title=Eagle Research Institute - Brown's Gas - Myth-conceptions|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
Oxyhydrogen will [[combustion|combust]] when brought to its [[autoignition temperature]].  For the [[stoichiometric]] mixture, 2:1 hydrogen:oxygen, at normal [[atmospheric pressure]], autoignition occurs at about 570&amp;nbsp;°C (1065&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;  The minimum energy required to ignite such a mixture with a spark is about 20 [[Joule|microjoule]]s.&lt;ref name="NASA"/&gt;  At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]], oxyhydrogen can burn when it is between about 4% and 95% hydrogen by volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moyle |first1=Morton |last2=Morrison |first2=Richard |last3=Churchill |first3=Stuart |title=Detonation Characteristics of Hydrogen Oxygen Mixtures |journal=AIChE Journal |date=March 1960 |url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/37308/690060118_ftp.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="NASA"&gt;

When ignited, the gas mixture converts to [[water vapor]] and  [[heat of combustion|releases energy]], which sustains the reaction: 241.8 [[Joule|kJ]] of energy ([[lower heating value|LHV]]) for every [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of {{hydrogen|2}} burned.  The amount of heat energy released is independent of the mode of combustion, but the [[flame temperature|temperature of the flame]] varies.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Oxyhydrogen Flame |volume=20 |page=424}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The maximum temperature of about {{convert|2800|°C|°F|-2}} is achieved with an exact [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometric]] mixture, about {{convert|700|C-change|F-change|-2}} hotter than a hydrogen flame in air.&lt;ref&gt;

When either of the gases are mixed in excess of this ratio, or when mixed with an [[inert gas]] like nitrogen, the heat must spread throughout a greater quantity of matter and the temperature will be lower.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

== Production ==
A pure stoichiometric mixture may be obtained by [[Electrolysis of water|water electrolysis]], which uses an [[electric current]] to dissociate the water molecules:
: electrolysis: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
: combustion: 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
[[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]] was the first to decompose water in this manner in 1800. In theory, the input energy of a closed system will always equal the output energy, as the [[first law of thermodynamics]] states. However, in practice no systems are perfectly closed, and the energy required to generate the oxyhydrogen will always exceed the energy released by combusting it, even at maximum practical efficiency, as the [[second law of thermodynamics]] implies. (See [[Electrolysis of water#Efficiency]]).

== Applications ==
[[Image:Limelight diagram.svg|thumb|[[Limelight]]s used an oxyhydrogen flame as a high-temperature heat source]]

=== Lighting ===
Many forms of oxyhydrogen [[Gas lighting|lamp]]s have been described, such as the [[limelight]], which used an oxyhydrogen flame to heat a piece of [[Calcium oxide|lime]] to [[Black body|white hot]] [[incandescence]].&lt;ref name="WT"/&gt;  Because of the explosiveness of the oxyhydrogen, limelights have been replaced by [[electric lighting]].

[[Image:Blowpipe - circa 1827.jpg|thumb|Nineteenth-century bellows-operated oxy-hydrogen blowpipe, including two different types of [[flashback arrestor]]]] The foundations of the oxy-hydrogen [[blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]] were laid down by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] around the last quarter of the eighteenth century. The oxy-hydrogen [[blowpipe (tool)|blowpipe]] itself was developed by the [[France|Frenchman]] Bochard-de-Saron, the [[England|English]] [[Mineralogy|mineralogist]] [[Edward Daniel Clarke]] and the [[United States|American]] [[chemistry|chemist]] [[Robert Hare (chemist)|Robert Hare]] in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| publisher = Manufacturing chemists| title = Report on the Development of the Chemical Arts During the Last Ten Years| journal=Chemical News |date = 1875|last=Hofmann |first=A.

===Oxyhydrogen torch===
An ''oxyhydrogen torch'' (also known as ''hydrogen torch'') is an [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting#Hydrogen|oxy-gas torch]] that burns hydrogen (the [[fuel]]) with oxygen (the [[oxidizer]]). It is used for cutting and [[welding]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter= 24.4 Oxyhydrogen welding |title= Manufacturing technology: foundry, forming and welding |author= P. N.

Due to competition from the acetylene-fueled cutting torch and from arc welding, the oxyhydrogen torch is seldom used today, but it remains the preferred cutting tool in some niche applications—see [[oxy-fuel welding and cutting]].

Oxyhydrogen was once used in working [[platinum]] because at the time such a torch was the only device that could attain the temperature required to melt the metal {{convert|1768.3|°C|°F}}.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt; These techniques have been superseded by the [[electric arc furnace]].

Brown's gas has become associated with various exaggerated claims.&lt;ref name="Ball2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ball | first=Philip | title=Burning water and other myths | journal=news@nature | publisher=Springer Nature | date=10 September 2007 | issn=1744-7933 | doi=10.1038/news070910-13 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ball2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ball|first=Philip|year=2006|title=Nuclear waste gets star attention|journal=news@nature|issn=1744-7933|doi=10.1038/news060731-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's also called "HHO gas" after the claims of fringe physicist&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weimar|first=Carrie|title=Snubbed By Mainstream, Scientist Sues|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BYtIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=e3QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1570,2000590&amp;dq=ruggero-santilli+fringe&amp;hl=en|accessdate=3 February 2011|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruggero Santilli#HHO gas|Ruggero Santilli]], who claims that his HHO gas, produced by a special apparatus, is "a new form of water", with new properties, based on his [[fringe theory]] of "[[magnecule]]s".&lt;ref name="Ball2006"/&gt; ("MagneGas" or "MagneHydrogen") .

Many other pseudoscientific claims have been made about Brown's gas's pretended ability to neutralize radioactive waste, help plants to germinate, etc.&lt;ref name="Ball2006"/&gt;

Oxyhydrogen is often mentioned in conjunction with [[water-fuelled car|vehicles that claim to use water as a fuel]]. The most common and decisive counter-argument against producing this gas on board to use as a fuel or fuel additive is that more energy is needed to split water molecules than is recouped by burning the resulting gas.&lt;ref name="Ball2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Schadewald 2008 p.

An article in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' reported that Brown's gas does not increase the [[fuel economy in automobiles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a3499/4276846/ Water-Powered Cars: Hydrogen Electrolyzer Mod Can't Up MPGs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150320180153/http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a3499/4276846/ |date=2015-03-20 }}, Mike Allen, August 7, 2008, Popularmechanics.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Poudrerie nationale de Vonges''' (Vonges National Powder Mill) is a French [[powder mill]] established in 1691 in [[Vonges]], Côte-d'Or.
It manufactured explosives for use in quarries, mines and fireworks.
During [[World War I]] (1914–18) it manufactured munitions.
It expanded after the war, producing explosives for civil use. 
During [[World War II]] (1939–45) production was scaled back drastically, but expanded again after the war.
The powder mill was fully privatized in 2008.

==Location and facilities==

The powder mill is located in the communes of Vonges and [[Pontailler-sur-Saône]], {{convert|30|km}} east of [[Dijon]] in the department of the Côte d'Or. 
The site is bounded by the [[Bèze (river)|Bèze]] and [[Saône]] rivers.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=2}}
Etienne Berthelot de Planeuf, Commissary General of Powders and Saltpeter, leased the site beside the  Bèze river on 20 February 1691 to build two powder mills, a powder grinder, a winter dryer, a powder magazine and a small refinery. 
The five year leases were renewed until July 1753, when the site was purchased outright by Charles-Emmanuel Pioche, Inspector-General of Powder and Saltpeter. 
A decree by the King in the Council of State of 18 January 1757 confirmed that the contract was perpetual.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=3}}
The facilities were expanded with another powder mill, a moulder and a shed.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|pp=3–4}}

The General Services buildings were erected in 1810–13, and another powder magazine was built in 1825.
Further extensions began in 1839, and the facilities were completely overhauled.
There were offices, manufacturing buildings and dwellings to the east of the powder mill, and around a yard to the west there were storage buildings, carpentry and cooperage workshops.
Between 1840 and 1850 two canals were built to supply hydraulic machinery.
Earth banks and rows of trees secured the site.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=4}}

==Operations==

The main products produced by the Vonges powder mill were [[gunpowder]], [[potassium chlorate]] powders ([[Cheddite]] type powders) and nitrogenous and chlorinated explosives.
Private companies packaged the powders into cartridges for mine and quarry explosives.
The institution also conducted surveillance and inspection of industrial establishments and fireworks factories using the explosives.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=3}}
The number of products increased through the 19th and early 20th century.
The facility developed manufacture of chlorate explosives, or "mine powders", for use in iron ore mines in the [[Briey]] basin.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=4}}
In 1870 the mill was one of four military powder works, under the direction of an artillery colonel.{{sfn|Figuier|1891|pp=81–152}}
On 31 May 1873 the powder mill held an auction of {{convert|29000|kg}} of [[glycerol]], {{convert|176000|kg}} of [[sulfuric acid]] and {{convert|83000|kg}} of [[nitric acid]].{{sfn|France|1873|p=3072}}

[[File:T6- d128 - Fig. 106. — Coupe d’un pétard de dynamite.png|thumb|Dynamite cartridge with fuse for military use, made at the Poudrerie de Vonges]]
In the 1870s another {{convert|7|ha}} were added for a [[dynamite]] factory.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=4}}
The official composition of the dynamite at this and other French powder works was 75% [[nitroglycerin]], 20.8% [[Randan, Puy-de-Dôme|randanite]] silica, 3.8% [[Vierzon]] silica and 0.4% [[magnesium carbonate]].{{sfn|Figuier|1891|pp=81–152}}
There were explosions in 1881 and 1882.{{sfn|Saint-André|1890|p=264}}
Production of dynamite was stopped in 1885.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=4}}
In September 1887 the powder mill sold {{convert|16551|kg}} of dynamite to the Société générale de dynamite in Paris that was declared to be superior but was found to be inert.{{sfn|Saint-André|1890|p=15}}
The dynamite was of very low quality, with the cartridges holding about 30% nitroglycerin.{{sfn|Saint-André|1890|p=13}}

[[File:Plans poudrerie de Vonges en 1884.jpg|thumb|Map of the powder mill in 1884]]
In 1875 the powder mill covered over {{convert|18|ha}}.
In 1876 a small amount of land was acquired for more buildings.
An earth embankment was built in 1877.{{sfn|Saint-André|1890|p=211}}
Buildings continued to be added or rebuilt in the years that followed, including factories, sheds and lodgings, and trees were planted.{{sfn|Saint-André|1890|p=212}}
As of 1890 the powder mill covered {{convert|34.5|ha}} and employed 204 workers.{{sfn|Saint-André|1890|p=211}}

By 1891 the powder mill was one of ten in France, the others being at [[Esquerdes]], [[Saint-Poncy]], Le Ripault ([[Monts, Indre-et-Loire]]), [[Pont-de-Buis-lès-Quimerch|Pont de Buis]], [[Angoulême]], [[Saint-Chamas]], [[Toulouse]], [[Saint-Médard-en-Jalles|Saint-Médard]] and [[Sevran]]-[[Livry-Gargan|Livry]].{{sfn|Figuier|1891|pp=81–152}}
At the start of the 20th century the powder mill manufactured [[gunpowder]], [[picric acid]], cresylite (trinitrocresol and picric acid), [[TNT]], [[Cheddite]]s and the "prométhée" explosive.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=4}}

==World Wars (1914–45)==

At the start of the [[World War I]] (1914–18) the site covered {{convert|66|ha}}, and had an interior network of [[Decauville]] railways between the facilities.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=4}}
The daily production capacity was 4 tons of gunpowder, 7 tons of melinite, 5 tons of cheddite and 1 ton of nitronaphthalene, produced by 281 workers.
Capacity expanded steadily to produce a greater quantity and variety of explosives.
The powder mill was connected to the [[Auxonne]]-[[Gray, Haute-Saône|Gray]] railway line, and the internal railway network was expanded.
A wharf was built on the Saône for water transport.
The manufacturing and storage facilities were expanded and barracks were built to house a rapidly growing workforce.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=5}}
The mining engineer [[Jules Aubrun]] was assigned to the powder mill in 1915–16.{{sfn|Aron|1960}}

By May 1918 the facility covered {{convert|97|ha}} and employed 2,744 workers.
Of these, 384 were civilian workers, 1,170 were enlisted workers and 1,142 were Algerians and colonials. 
The others were managers, engineers and technicians.{{sfn|Mirallès |Bourbonnais|2012|p=4}}
After the war production of gunpowder for use in the mines expanded, and production of "Yonckite" and Favier explosives began.
There was an explosion on 7 July 1920, after which the manufacture of chlorate explosives was reorganized.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=6}}
Between 1920 and 1938 the number of employees and workers varied from 407 to 530.{{sfn|Mirallès |Bourbonnais|2012|p=4}}
By 1928 the site had been expanded through land purchases to {{convert|259|ha}}.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=6}}
A decree of 23 September 1934 classified the mill as being used for storage, handling and manufacture of powders, ammunition, fireworks and explosives, and defined a polygon of isolation around it.{{sfn|JORF n°0152 du 3 juillet 2013}}

Louis Jean Charles Maurel was the chief engineer at Vonges at the outbreak of World War II until June 1940. 
He later joined the [[Armée secrète]] (AS), was arrested in October 1943 and was shot in February 1944.{{sfn|Maitron}}
During [[World War II]] (1939-45) German troops entered Vonges on 15 June 1940, and the French retreated to Toulouse.
Italian aircraft bombed the facility on 16 June 1940 and destroyed the General Service buildings.
The personnel returned from Toulouse in August 1940.
Production of explosives and gunpowder resumed in October 1940 at a reduced level, since the powder mill could not supply customers in the unoccupied zone of France.
Delivery wagons were requisitioned by the German authorities, preventing deliveries, and the growth of stocks raised the risk of explosions.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=6}}

After December 1940 the Germans took control of the facility and authorized deliveries of powders and explosives to the mines.
Starting in 1943 the operation was severely affected by workers being requisitioned to work in Germany, and others leaving the powder mill to avoid being sent to Germany.
The number of workers dropped from 311 to 174, and output dropped correspondingly.
After the [[Liberation of France]] the personnel were purged before production was restarted.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=7}}

==Later developments==
[[File:La poudrerie de Vonges vue depuis les installations sportives.JPG|thumb|View from the sports facility]]
In the 1950s the French powder mills expanded their exports.
In 1957 the Vonges facility covered {{convert|300|ha}}, of which {{convert|100|ha}} were wooded.
In the late 1960s there were 500 employees producing gunpowder and nitrate and chlorate explosives.
Around this time the mill diversified into producing composite materials and industrial paint.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=7}}
A decree of 19 March 1963 extended the polygon of isolation.{{sfn|JORF n°0152 du 3 juillet 2013}}
The powder mill included a medical service, a social service and a school for apprentices.
On 28 February 1970 as part of a reform of the Powder Department the Esquerdes Powder Mill in the Pas de Calais was closed and annexed to the Vonges Powder Mill.{{sfn|Mirallès |Bourbonnais|2012|p=5}}

In 1971 the Société Nationale des Poudres et Explosifs (SNPE) took over all the manufacturing and sales of the government's powder department, including the Vonges Powder Mill, which continued to manufacture gunpowder and industrial explosives cartridges, as well as plastic parts for industrial use.{{sfn|Lacour|Muller|2012|p=7}}
The state was the majority shareholder in the SNPE.
In 1995 Nobel explosifs France was created as a subsidiary of SNPE.
In 2008 this subsidiary was merged with the private company Titanite to create Titanobel, now fully private.
As of 2012 the Vonges Power Mill  was operated by Titanobel.{{sfn|Mirallès |Bourbonnais|2012|p=6}}
Titanobel SAS manufactures and markets explosives in France and abroad for use in mines, quarries and other works.{{sfn|Company Overview of TITANOBEL SAS – Bloomberg}}
A decree of 1 July 2013 repealed the repealed the decrees of 1934 and 1963 that defined the site's use and its polygons of isolation.{{sfn|JORF n°0152 du 3 juillet 2013}}

[[File:Project Longshot configurations.png|right|thumb|{{ordered list |Initial configuration |Configuration at 33 years |Configuration at 67 years |Configuration at 100 years}}]]
'''Project Longshot''' was a conceptual [[interstellar spacecraft]] design. It would have been an [[Unmanned spacecraft|unmanned]] [[space probe|probe]], intended to fly to and enter orbit around [[Alpha Centauri|Alpha Centauri B]] powered by [[nuclear pulse propulsion]].&lt;ref name="long1"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Project Longshot |url=http://www.realclearscience.com/lists/3_canceled_nasa_projects/ |newspaper=Real Clear Science |location=United States |date 22 April 2014= |access-date=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Developed by the [[US Naval Academy]] and [[NASA]], from 1987 to 1988, Longshot was designed to be built at [[Space Station Freedom| Space Station ''Freedom'']], the precursor to the existing [[International Space Station]]. Similar to [[Project Daedalus]], Longshot was designed with existing technology in mind, although some development would have been required. For example, the Project Longshot concept assumes "a three-order-of-magnitude leap over current propulsion technology".&lt;ref name="long1"/&gt;

==Mission==
Unlike Daedalus, which used an open-cycle [[fusion power|fusion engine]], Longshot would use a long-lived [[nuclear fission]] reactor for power. Initially generating 300 kilowatts, the reactor would power a number of [[laser]]s in the engine that would be used to ignite [[inertial confinement fusion]] similar to that in Daedalus. The main design difference is that Daedalus also relied on the [[fusion reaction]] to power the ship, whereas in the Longshot design the internal reactor would provide this power.&lt;ref name="long1"/&gt;

The reactor would also be used to power a laser for communications back to Earth, with a maximum power of 250 kW. For most of the journey, this would be used at a much lower power for sending data about the [[interstellar medium]]; but during the flyby, the main engine section would be discarded and the entire power capacity dedicated to communications at about 1 kilobit per second.

Longshot would have a mass of {{convert|396|t|lb}} at the start of the mission including 264 tonnes of [[helium-3]]/[[deuterium]] pellet fuel/propellant. The active mission payload, which includes the [[fission reactor]] but not the discarded main propulsion section, would have a mass of around 30 tonnes.

A difference in the [[mission architecture]] between Longshot and the Daedalus study is that Longshot would go into orbit about the target star while the higher speed Daedalus would do a one shot [[Planetary flyby|fly-by]] lasting a comparatively short time.

The journey to [[Alpha Centauri|Alpha Centauri B]] orbit would take about 100 years, at an average velocity of approximately 13,411&amp;nbsp;km/s (about 4.5% the speed of light) and another 4.39&amp;nbsp;years would be necessary for the data to reach [[Earth]].

According to the Journal article "Alpha Centauri: Our First target for Interstellar Probes," after the completion of the New Horizons primary mission of Pluto Fly-By, we should set our sights at other star systems like Alpha Centauri. This would be a good target because of its proximity to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Alpha_Centauri_Our_First_Target_for_Interstellar_Probes_999.html|title=Alpha Centauri: Our First Target for Interstellar Probes|work=spacedaily.com|access-date=2017-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1116">In [[digital circuit]]s, a '''runt pulse''' is a narrow [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulse]] that, 
due to non-zero [[rise time|rise]] and [[fall time|fall]] times of the signal, does not reach a valid 
high or low level.  A runt pulse may occur when switching between 
[[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]] [[Clock signal|clocks]]; or as the result of a [[race condition]] in which a signal takes two separate paths through a circuit, which may have different delays, and is then recombined to form a [[glitch]]; or when the output of a [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]] becomes [[Metastability in electronics|metastable]].

== Example ==
Some [[oscilloscope]]s provide a method for triggering on runt pulses.  The oscilloscope triggers when the signal crosses one of two voltage [[Threshold voltage|thresholds]], but not both.&lt;ref name="Tektronix"&gt;{{cite web

==History==

===Formation===
[[Xerox]] aimed to exit to the computer industry in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Edith. "IBM Opposes Retelling of Whole Xerox Story in Court", ''Computerworld'', p. 42, 26 January 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; it asked [[IBM]] to migrate its business systems to [[IBM]] technology. As part of IBM's compensation for the migration, IBM was given the rights to the [[Scientific Data Systems|Scientific Data Systems (SDS)]]/SAPE software, reportedly for a contract credit of $80,000.

Five IBM engineers from the AI department&lt;ref name="funding universe"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of SAP AG |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/sap-ag-history |accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idch"&gt;International Directory of Company Histories, Vol. 16. St James Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Dietmar Hopp]], [[Klaus Tschira]], Hans-Werner Hector, [[Hasso Plattner]], and [[Claus Wellenreuther]], all from [[Mannheim]], Baden-Württemberg) were working in an enterprise-wide system based on this software, only to be told that it would no longer be necessary. Rather than abandoning the project, they decided to leave IBM Tech and start another company.&lt;ref name="saphistory"&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|title=SAP History: From Start-Up Software Vendor to Global Market Leader|url=http://www.sap.com/corporate-en/about/our-company/history/index.html|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1972, they founded the {{lang|de|Systemanalyse und Programmentwicklung}} ("System Analysis and Program Development" / "SAPD") company, as a private partnership under the German Civil Code.&lt;ref name="saphistory"/&gt;

Their first client was the German branch of [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] in [[Östringen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sap.com/uk/about/success/casestudies/ici.epx SAP UK – ICI Success Story], Sap.com (1 January 1999); retrieved 24 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; where they developed mainframe programs for payroll and accounting. Instead of storing the data on [[punch card]]s mechanically, as IBM did, they stored it locally in the Electronic System which using common Logical database for all activities of Organization.{{clarify|date=April 2017}} Therefore, they called their software a [[real-time computing|real-time]] system, since there was no need to process the punch cards overnight (for this reason their flagship product carried an '''R''' in its name until the late 1990s). This first version was also a standalone software that could be offered to other interested parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Standard Application Software for Real-time processing is developed|URL=http://www.sap.com/corporate-en/about/our-company/history/1972-1981.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enterprise Resource Planning===
In 1973, the first commercial product was launched. It was called SAP R/98,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.simplilearn.com/sap-r-98-the-first-commercial-erp-product-rar378-article|title=SAP R/98 – The First Commercial ERP Product|publisher=Simplilearn.com|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offered a common system for multiple tasks. This permitted the use of a centralized data storage, improving the maintenance of data. From a technical point of view, therefore, a [[database]] was necessary.&lt;ref name="ErfolgsfaktorenSAP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chbeck.metapress.com/content/ph64048135784551|title=Vom Programmierbüro zum globalen Softwareproduzenten: Die Erfolgsfaktoren der SAP von der Gründung bis zum R/3-Boom, 1972 bis 1996|publisher=Chbeck.metapress.com|date=14 November 2008|accessdate=27 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130128164657/http://chbeck.metapress.com/content/ph64048135784551|archivedate=28 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, SAP [[GmbH]] was founded, and moved its headquarters the following year to [[Walldorf]], Germany. Three years later, in 1979, SAP launched [[SAP R/2]], expanding the capabilities of the system to other areas, such as material management and [[production planning]]. In 1981, SAP brought a re-designed product to market. However, SAP R/2 did not improve until the period between 1985 and 1990. SAP released the new [[SAP R/3]] in 1992. SAP developed and released several versions of R/3 through 1995. By the mid-1990s, SAP followed the trend from [[Mainframe computer|mainframe]] computing to [[client-server architecture|client/server architectures]]. The development of SAP's internet strategy with mySAP.com redesigned the concept of business processes (integration via Internet).&lt;ref name="saphistory"/&gt; As a result, R/3 was replaced with the introduction of SAP ERP Central Component (ECC) 5.0 in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cipherbsc.com/sap-ecc-modules/|title=SAP ECC Modules - Cipher Business Solutions|last=Solutions|first=Cipher Business|publisher=Cipher Business Solutions|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural changes were also made to support an enterprise service architecture to transition customers to a services-oriented architecture. The latest version, SAP ERP 6.0, was released in 2006. SAP ERP 6.0 has since then been updated through SAP enhancement packs, the most recent: SAP enhancement package 8 for SAP ERP 6.0 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/latest-version-sap-erp-available-ecc-60-ehp7-what-do-you-rakesh-singh|title=The latest version of SAP ERP available is SAP ECC 6.0 EHP7, What do you understand by ECC ?|date=2016-03-04|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corporate restructuring ===
In August 1988, SAP GmbH became SAP [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]], and public trading started on 4 November 1988. Shares were listed on the [[Frankfurt Stock Exchange|Frankfurt]] and [[Börse Stuttgart|Stuttgart stock exchanges]].&lt;ref name="saphistory"/&gt; In 1995, SAP was included in the German stock index [[DAX]] and, on 22 September 2003, SAP was included in the [[STOXX Europe 50]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Stoxx|title=STOXX Limited Announces Changes to its Blue-Chip Index Series|date=1 September 2003|url=http://www.whitehallresources.co.uk/stoxx-limited-announces-changes-to-its-blue-chip-index-series/|accessdate=21 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021194441/http://www.whitehallresources.co.uk/stoxx-limited-announces-changes-to-its-blue-chip-index-series/|archive-date=21 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's official name became ''SAP [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]'' (a public limited company) after the 2005 [[annual general meeting]]. In 2014, SAP changed from an AG to a European Company ([[Societas Europaea|Societas Europaea or SE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sap.com/corporate-en/about/investors/investorservices/faq/index.html|title=Company Q &amp; A|publisher=Investor Relations, SAP |accessdate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Focus on cloud ===
Since 2012, SAP has acquired several companies that sell [[cloud computing|cloud-based products]], with several multibillion-dollar acquisitions seen by analysts as an attempt to challenge competitor [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-05-22/sap-agrees-to-buy-ariba |title=SAP to Acquire Ariba for $4.3 Billion in Push Into Cloud |first1=Kenneth |last1=Wong |first2=Dina |last2=Bass |publisher=Bloomberg News |date=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 SAP bought [[Concur Technologies]], a provider of cloud-based travel and expense management software, for $8.3 billion, SAP's most expensive purchase to that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2014/09/22/sap-to-acquire-concur-technologies-to-boost-cloud-sales |title=SAP To Acquire Concur Technologies To Boost Cloud Sales |newspaper=Forbes |date=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts' reactions to the purchase were mixed, with Thomas Becker of Commerzbank questioning whether Concur was the right choice for SAP, while Credit Suisse called the acquisition an "aggressive" move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/sap-to-acquire-concur-technologies-1411076535 |title=SAP to Acquire Concur Technologies |newspaper=The Wall Street Journal |first1=Neetha |last1=Mahadevan |first2=Stephan |last2=Doerner |date=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, IBM and SAP began a partnership to sell cloud-based services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-and-sap-score-win-over-amazon-2014-10|title=IBM and SAP Score Win Over Amazon|publisher=BusinessInsider|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in 2015, SAP also partnered with [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise|HPE]] to provide secure hybrid cloud-based services running the SAP platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www8.hp.com/us/en/hp-news/press-release.html?id=1982676#.WNdTf1XytEY|title=HP News - HP and SAP Accelerate Journey to SAP® S/4HANA on HP Helion Managed Cloud|publisher=Hewlett-Packard |language=en|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both HPE and IBM provide infrastructure services to SAP, and SAP runs its SAP HANA cloud solution on top. SAP has announced additional partnerships with Microsoft in order to give customers tools for data visualization, as well as improved mobile applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/19/microsoft-sap-strengthen-ties-with-mobile-data-cloud-partnership|title=Microsoft and SAP Strengthen Ties with Mobile, Data, Cloud Partnership|publisher=TechCrunch|date=19 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SAP exceeded its revenue projections due to the expansion in its cloud business and the success of SAP HANA. The growth can also be partially attributed to the acquisitions of Concur and Fieldglass.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2015/01/22/sap-posts-strong-2014-results-cloud-business-to-drive-future-growth SAP Posts Strong 2014 Results, Cloud Business to Drive Future Growth ], Forbes, 22 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The company announced plans in 2016 to invest heavily into technology relating to [[Internet of things|Internet of Things]] (IoT) as part of a strategy to capitalize on the growth in that market. For that purpose, €2 billion is planned for investment in relevant sectors by the end of 2020.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/09/28/sap-invest-billion-internet-things-2020/|title=SAP Plans to Invest $2.2 Billion in the Internet of Things by 2020|agency=Reuters|publisher=Fortune|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAP will also launch a new product line called SAP IoT, which "will combine large amounts of data from things connected to the Internet with machine learning and SAP's real-time database S/4 HANA."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===SAP S/4HANA===
In 2015, the company launched [[SAP S/4HANA]], the newest generation of the SAP Business Suite. It was written natively for the [[SAP HANA]] platform. It offers cloud, on-premises and hybrid deployment options to customers, with its benefits including a smaller data footprint, higher throughput, faster analytics and faster access to data. It also allows existing SAP Business Suite customers to upgrade to this product from SAP Business Suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Answers on SAP upgradation to SAP S/4HANA|URL=http://news.sap.com/what-is-sap-s4hana-13-questions-answered/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, SAP introduced SAP HANA, Express Edition which is meant to run on personal computers or on cloud computing platforms for students and other small-scale developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/sap-aims-to-court-more-hana-developers-launches-express-edition/ |title=SAP aims to court more HANA developers, launches express edition |publisher=ZDNet |date=16 September 2016 |accessdate=19 November 2016 |author=Larry Dignan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and markets==
{{As of|2016}}, SAP is the world's third largest software and programming company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/global2000/list/#industry:Software%20%26%20Programming |title=The World's Biggest Public Companies, Software &amp; Programming |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corporation operates in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Middle East, North America, and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Worldwide Office Directory of SAP|URL=http://www.sap.com/directory/main.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enterprise service-oriented architecture==
[[Service-oriented architecture]] has been incorporated into the SAP ERP ([[Enterprise Resource Planning]]) system and other products defined within the SAP Enterprise Services Architecture (Enterprise SOA).

===Enterprise SOA=== &lt;!-- Anchor from redirect of [SAP Enterprise Services Architecture]; caution. --&gt;
''SAP Enterprise Service Oriented Architecture'' (or ''Enterprise SOA'') is SAP SE's [[service-oriented architecture]] implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://global.sap.com/platform/soa/adoptionprogram.epx ''SAP - Enterprise Service-Oriented Architecture: Adoption Program''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140113103954/http://global.sap.com/platform/soa/adoptionprogram.epx |date=13 January 2014 }}, global.sap.com; accessed 27 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Enterprise SOA is enabled by the [[SAP NetWeaver]] platform and builds on the benefits of [[Web service]]s. SAP has positioned Enterprise SOA to deliver the benefits offered by service-oriented architecture, including enabling both flexibility and business efficiency. SAP markets Enterprise SOA as a cost-effective way of adding new applications to existing infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;"When Does a Web Service Become an Enterprise Service?" by Dr Franz-Josef Fritz (SAP AG), ''SAP Insider'', April–May–June 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; SAP Solutions that currently use Enterprise SOA are [[mySAP CRM]], [[mySAP ERP]], and [[mySAP SRM]].

==Organization==
{{primary sources|section|date=July 2016}}
SAP uses a two-tier structure of boards, with an [[executive board]] and a [[supervisory board]]. As of 2016, members of the executive board were [[Bill McDermott]] ([[chief executive officer|CEO]] and Chairman, joined in 2008), Robert Enslin (2014) Bernd Leukert (2014), Luka Mucic ([[Chief financial officer|CFO]], 2014), Michael Kleinemeier (2015), Stefan Ries (2016), Steve Singh (2016), Gerhard Oswald (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sap.com/corporate-en/about/our-company/our-boards/executive-board.html|title=SAP Executive Board|publisher=SAP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juergen Mueller will join the executive board in 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chief-innovation-officer-juergen-mueller-to-join-sap-se-board-300738290.html|title=Chief Innovation Officer Juergen Mueller to Join SAP SE Board|publisher=PR Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Functional units of SAP are split across different organizational units for R&amp;D needs, field activities and customer support. SAP Labs are mainly responsible for product development whereas the field organizations spread across each country are responsible for field activities such sales, marketing and consulting. Headquarters is responsible for overall management as well as core Engineering activities related to product development. Worldwide customer support is not provided by the field organizations but by a unified organization called Active Global Support (AGS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAP launches Global Support Center|URL=http://global.sap.com/corporate-en/news.epx?PressID=3042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SAP Labs ==
{{primary sources|section|date=October 2017}}
'''SAP Labs''' are R&amp;D locations that develop and improve SAP core products. SAP Labs are strategically located in high-tech clusters around the globe.

SAP Labs are located in Germany (main locations: [[Walldorf]]/Rot, [[Markdorf]], [[Berlin]]), United States (main location: [[Silicon Valley]]), India (main location: [[Bangalore]]), China (main location: [[Shanghai]]), Brazil (main location: [[São Leopoldo|Sao Leopoldo]]), Bulgaria (main location: [[Sofia]]), Canada (main locations: [[Vancouver]], [[Montreal]]), Vietnam (main location: [[Ho Chi Minh City]]), Israel (main location: [[Ra'anana]]), CIS (main location: [[Moscow]]), France (main location: [[Paris]], [[Sophia Antipolis]]), Ireland (main location: [[Dublin]]), Hungary (main location: [[Budapest]]), Slovakia (main location: [[Bratislava]]), Czech Republic (main location: [[Brno]]), Poland (main location: [[Gliwice]])，China (main location: Shanghai);

The four most prominent labs of SAP SE are located in Germany, India, China and the US. Labs Walldorf was founded in 1972 and became SAP's primary location. At the beginning, the focus of SAP's expansion was entering highly developed IT markets; in 1993 Palo Alto became a part of SAP Labs. Aiming to acquire talented employees, SAP opened another lab in Bangalore in 2003.

Among the latest SAP Labs are labs in Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland. All three labs have been established in 2016. The labs in India are now the largest labs outside Germany. 

In order to manage SAP Labs, '''SAP Labs Network (SLN)''' was created. SLN is a global unit that manages regional Labs and shares best business practices. It coordinates and distributes development projects among individual SAP Labs locations, accelerates product delivery, gives SAP full access to talent, and drives SAP corporate strategy regarding innovation and business growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sap.com/corporate/en/company/innovation/sap-labs.html|title=R&amp;D Locations {{!}} SAP Labs {{!}} About SAP SE|publisher=SAP|access-date=2016-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SAP User Groups==
{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}
'''SAP User Groups''' are independent, nonprofit organizations of SAP customers and SAP partners. They serve as communications channel for their members towards SAP and for SAP towards the markets. The Americas' SAP Users' Group (ASUG) is the company's largest user group, with 100,000 individuals at 3,800 companies. ASUG members are professionals who work in more than 17 industries. Many are technical and business process experts in the SAP ecosystem; they have varied levels of experience, and come from small businesses to global corporations, as well as universities. In 2007, the SAP User Group Executive Network (SUGEN) was established.

SAP provoked controversy and frustration among its users in 2008 by raising the cost of its maintenance contracts. The issue was the subject of intense discussion among user groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworlduk.com/management/it-business/supplier-relations/news/index.cfm?newsid=10632 SAP faces user wrath over price hikes]. Computerworlduk.com. Retrieved on 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==SAP Cloud Platform==
SAP Cloud Platform is SAP's platform-as-a-service (PaaS)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cloudplatform.sap.com/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is used to deliver in-memory capabilities and microservices for building and extending, mobile-enabled cloud applications. The infrastructure is offered through a global network of SAP managed data centers. SAP Cloud Platform is an open platform-as-a-service, which includes the in-memory SAP HANA database management system, connects to both on premises and cloud-based systems running SAP or other third-party software and relies on open standards, like Java, JavaScript, Node.js and Cloud Foundry for integration options.

SAP Cloud Platform is promoted to build and extend business applications with rapid innovation cycles. SAP and Apple Inc. partnered to develop mobile applications on iOS using cloud-based software development kits (SDKs) for the SAP Cloud Platform. SAP founding development partners&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insidesap.com.au/winners-of-2015-sap-pinnacle-awards-announced/|title=Winners of 2015 SAP Pinnacle Awards announced - Inside SAP|website=www.insidesap.com.au|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; for their Cloud Platform include [[Accenture]], Celonis, [[EnterpriseAlumni]] &amp; [[Walmart]]

SAP Cloud Platform is based on open source technology, developed &amp; supported in partnership with SUSE. The company is also in partnership with Cloud Foundry for a beta offering of SAP Cloud Platform that enables customers to test out and give feedback for the functionalities coming with Cloud Foundry.

==SAP Store==
SAP launched the SAP store in March 2015 as its principal e-commerce property to allow customers to buy its products directly on the Web rather than through traditional sales channels. Customers can purchase free trials or starter editions and can pay by credit card or PayPal.

==SAP App Center==
Launched in 2016, the SAP App Center is an online [[app store|application marketplace]] for third-party applications that integrate with and extend SAP products. Applications are available for free, as well as via yearly or monthly subscription models. Applications available range from integrations with content management software to mobile approval management and payment platforms. As of July 2018, it features over 1,500 applications.

==Conferences==
SAP has two annual conferences:
* SAPPHIRE is SAP's customer-facing event, where it generally announces major product changes and strategic direction. It is typically held in the spring in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.v3.co.uk/v3-uk/news/2154366/sap-unveils-successfactors-cloud-computing-roadmap-squares-oracle|title=SAP unveils SuccessFactors cloud computing roadmap as it squares up to Oracle|publisher=V3.co.uk|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/2223461|title=SAP Rolls Out Updates at SAPPHIRE|publisher=InternetNews|date=17 June 2003|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* SAP TechEd is the company's more technical conference, aimed at SAP's ecosystem of consultants and software development partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-09-22/bangalore/27845182_1_teched-key-theme-solutions|title=SAP TechEd '05 in Bangalore|publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com|date=22 September 2005|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/207317/sap_teched_to_go_deep_on_mobility_ondemand.html|title=SAP TechEd to Go Deep on Mobility|publisher=Pcworld.com|date=8 October 2010|accessdate=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAP TechEd has been held annually since 1995.

==Competitive landscape==
SAP competitors are primarily in the [[enterprise resource planning]] software industry. In this field, [[Oracle Corporation]] is SAP's major competitor. SAP also competes in the customer relationship management, marketing &amp; sales software, manufacturing, warehousing &amp; industrial software, and supply chain management &amp; logistics software sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Staff|title=SAP Competitors|url=http://www.hoovers.com/company-information/cs/competition.sap_se.48cbdfcd173cadff.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle Corporation filed [[Oracle Corp. v. SAP AG|a lawsuit against SAP]] for malpractice and unfair competition in the California courts in 2007. SAP lost the case in 2010 and was ordered to pay $1.3&amp;nbsp;billion, which was cited as the largest [[copyright infringement]] judgment in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SAP to pay Oracle $1.3 billion in landmark decision|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/11/24/us-oracle-sap-idUSTRE6AL4IN20101124|publisher=[[Reuters]] |accessdate=2 October 2015|first=Dan|last=Levine|date=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict was overturned in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/technology/oracle-verdict-against-sap-is-overturned.html|title=Oracle Verdict Against SAP Is Overturned|publisher=Associated Press|date=1 September 2011|accessdate=12 January 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the lawsuit was finally settled in 2014 for $356.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2014/11/13/technology/13reuters-oracle-sap-se-settlement.html|title=Oracle, SAP Settle Long-Running TomorrowNow Lawsuit|publisher=Reuters|date=13 November 2014|accessdate=14 August 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The resulting pressure saw SAP and SUGEN (SAP User Group Executive Network) agree to a major benchmarking exercise to prove the value of the new support pricing policy to customers. In December 2009, SAP delayed its Enterprise Support price rises until agreement had been reached on the benchmarks and KPIs (Key Performance Indicators).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworlduk.com/management/infrastructure/applications/news/index.cfm?newsId=17810 SAP delays Enterprise Support price rises]. Computerworlduk.com; retrieved 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, SAP reversed its direction on Enterprise Support and reintroduced its standard support package for customers. The move to reinstate standard support – at 18 percent of annual license fees, "will enable all customers to choose the option that best meets their requirements", the company said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworlduk.com/management/infrastructure/applications/news/index.cfm?newsId=18318 SAP does U-turn on Enterprise Support]. Computerworlduk.com; retrieved 7 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2013, SAP acquired German software company [[Hybris (company)|Hybris]] for eCommerce capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.eweek.com/it-management/sap-closes-deal-to-acquire-mdm-maker-hybris|title=SAP Closes Deal to Acquire MDM Maker Hybris|publisher=eWEEK|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/applications/sap-buys-hybris-gains-customer-experience-power/d/d-id/1111073 "SAP buys Hybris, gains customer experience, power"], informationweek.com; accessed 27 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropic efforts==
SAP has donated several millions of dollars to a variety of global health causes including the [[Product Red]] campaign and the [[Global Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=(RED) Partners|url=http://www.joinred.com/partners/#!/shopred/sap|work=(RED)|publisher=The ONE Campaign|date=14 October 2012|accessdate=27 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524044206/http://www.joinred.com/partners/#!/shopred/sap|archivedate=24 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidephilanthropy.com/tech-philanthropy/2014/10/8/what-this-giant-software-company-is-doing-to-advance-global.html |title=What This Giant Software Company Is Doing to Advance Global Health |publisher=Inside Philanthropy |date=8 October 2014 |accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, SAP has distributed free software in South Africa as part of an effort towards developing future markets there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triplepundit.com/2013/08/business-case-strategic-philanthropy |title=The Business Case for Strategic Philanthropy |publisher= TriplePundit |date=8 August 2013 |accessdate=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also encourages employees to volunteer through social sabbaticals, sending teams of people to different countries to aid non-profits. SAP employees have volunteered in China, India, Brazil, and South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/ernst-young-sap-corporate-volunteering |title=How EY and SAP are championing corporate volunteering |publisher=The Guardian |date=11 February 2014 |accessdate = 13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autism hiring==
SAP also engages in outreach activities within its company. In 2013, the company launched an initiative to hire employees with autism and [[Asperger syndrome]], citing their undervalued ability to contribute to its workforce. SAP aims to compose 1% of its workforce with individuals with autism by the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-22621829 |title=SAP in autism recruitment drive |publisher=BBC News |date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bribery and corruption ==

=== South African allegations ===

In July 2017, allegations were made that SAP had been involved in business transactions with the controversial and politically influential [[Gupta family]] in South Africa. SAP was accused of paying CAD House, a Gupta-controlled company, R100 million in order to secure a [[Transnet]] deal. SAP denied the allegations, claiming that the money was paid as "an extension of the sales force", despite CAD House having no prior SAP experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/guptaleaks-software-giant-paid-gupta-front-r100m-kickbacks-for-state-business-20170711|title=#GuptaLeaks: Software giant paid Gupta front R100m 'kickbacks' for state business|publisher=News24|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://amabhungane.co.za/article/2017-07-11-guptaleaks-software-giant-sap-paid-gupta-front-r100m-kickbacks-for-state-business|title=amaBhungane - #GuptaLeaks: Software giant SAP paid Gupta front R100m "kickbacks" for state business|publisher=amabhungane.co.za|language=en|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guptas' dealings with SAP were revealed in a widely publicised e-mail leak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.fin24.com/Economy/guptas-just-tip-of-sas-corruption-ice-berg-saftu-20170711|title=Guptas just tip of SA's corruption ice-berg - Saftu|publisher=Fin24|access-date=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://businesstech.co.za/news/business/184559/software-giant-pulled-into-gupta-saga-with-allegations-of-r100-million-kickbacks/|title=Software giant pulled into Gupta saga with allegations of R100 million kickbacks|access-date=2017-07-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the allegations, SAP launched an investigation that led to four of its South African managers being placed on administrative leave along with the seizure of their mobile phones and computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d8d693c0-67d8-11e7-8526-7b38dcaef614|title=Germany's SAP to investigate South Africa kickback allegations|newspaper=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claas Kuehnemann was named as acting managing director for Africa while the investigation continued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.itweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=163367|title=SAP names Kuehnemann as acting MD |publisher=ITWeb Technology News|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 October 2017, SAP announced that it had voluntarily reported itself to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] for a possible violation of US law, including the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]], related to the South African bribery allegations. SAP's own investigation, conducted by law firm [[Baker McKenzie]], revealed that SAP had paid $7.7 million in commissions to third-parties linked to the Gupta family while securing contracts worth $48 million with Transnet and [[Eskom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.sap.com/sap-provides-update-on-ongoing-investigation-into-its-south-africa-business/|title=SAP Provides Update on Ongoing Investigation into Its South Africa Business|date=26 October 2017|publisher=SAP News Center|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026143054/https://news.sap.com/sap-provides-update-on-ongoing-investigation-into-its-south-africa-business/|archivedate=26 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2017/10/26/sap-south-africa-gupta-doj-sec-corruption/|title=SAP Is Being Investigated by the U.S. Over a Major International Kickback Scandal|last=Meyer|first=David|date=26 October 2017|publisher=Fortune |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026143214/http://fortune.com/2017/10/26/sap-south-africa-gupta-doj-sec-corruption/|archivedate=26 October 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2017-10-26-us-justice-department-launches-investigation-into-sap-gupta-dealings|title=US justice department launches investigation into SAP-Gupta dealings|date=26 October 2017|newspaper=Mail and Guardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026143251/https://mg.co.za/article/2017-10-26-us-justice-department-launches-investigation-into-sap-gupta-dealings|archivedate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Panamanian bribery ===

In May 2015, SAP agreed to pay $3.9 million to settle [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] civil charges over a former executive's scheme to bribe Panama government officials in order to win lucrative technology contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sap-se-sec-idUSKCN0VA3HW|title=#PanamaBribery: SAP settles with SEC over Panama bribery scheme|publisher=Reuters|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{South American dreadnought race|state=expanded}}
A naval [[arms race]] among [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Chile]]—the most powerful and wealthy countries in [[South America]]—began in the early twentieth century when the Brazilian government ordered three [[dreadnought]]s, formidable [[battleship]]s whose capabilities far outstripped older vessels in the world's navies.

In 1904, the Brazilian Navy found itself well behind its Argentine and Chilean rivals in quality and total tonnage; few ships had been ordered since the [[#Brazilian decline and re-emergence|fall of the Brazilian monarchy]] in 1889, while Argentina and Chile had just concluded a [[Argentine–Chilean naval arms race|fifteen-year naval arms race]] which filled their navies with modern warships. Rising demand for coffee and rubber was fueling a large increase in the Brazilian government's revenue, and the country's legislature voted to devote some of the proceeds to address this naval imbalance. They believed that building a strong navy would play an essential role in remaking the country into an international power.

The Brazilian government ordered three small battleships from the [[United Kingdom]] in late 1905, but the appearance of the revolutionary British warship {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} in 1906 quickly scrapped these plans.{{efn-ua|''cf.'' [[Pre-dreadnought battleship#Obsolescence|"Obsolescence"]] in [[Pre-dreadnought battleship]].}} Instead, the Brazilians ordered three {{sclass-|Minas Geraes|battleship|0}} dreadnoughts—warships that would be the most powerful in the world, and of a type which quickly became a measure of international prestige, similar to nuclear weapons in the mid-twentieth century. This action focused the world's attention on the newly ascendant country: newspapers and politicians in the great powers fretted that Brazil would sell the ships to a belligerent nation, while the Argentine and Chilean governments immediately canceled their naval-limiting pact and ordered two dreadnoughts each (the {{sclass-|Rivadavia|battleship|5}} and {{sclass-|Almirante Latorre|battleship|4}}es, respectively).

Meanwhile, Brazil's third dreadnought faced a good deal of political opposition after an economic downturn and a [[#Brazilian naval revolt|naval revolt]]: the crews of both of their brand-new battleships, along with several smaller warships, mutinied and threatened to fire on Rio de Janeiro if there was no end to what they called the "slavery" being practiced by the Brazilian Navy. Despite these pressures, the shipbuilder [[Armstrong Whitworth]] successfully held the Brazilians to their contractual obligations. Construction on the new ship, preliminarily named [[Brazilian battleship Rio de Janeiro (1913)|''Rio de Janeiro'']], was halted several times due to repeated design changes. Brazil's coffee and rubber booms collapsed soon after. Concerned that their ship would be outclassed by larger [[super-dreadnought]]s, they sold the incomplete vessel to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in December 1913.

The First World War marked the end of the naval arms race, as the South American countries found themselves unable to purchase additional warships. The Brazilian government ordered a new battleship, [[#Riachuelo|''Riachuelo'']], in May 1914, but the conflict effectively canceled the ship. The British purchased the two Chilean battleships before they were completed; one was sold back to Chile in 1920. Argentina's two dreadnoughts, having been built in the neutral United States, escaped this fate and were commissioned in 1914–15. Although several South American [[#Aftermath: post-war expansions|post-war naval expansion plans]] called for dreadnoughts, no additional units were constructed.

Conflicting Argentine and Chilean claims to [[Patagonia]], the southernmost region in South America, had been causing tension between the two countries since the 1840s. This tension was heightened in 1872 and 1878, when Chilean warships seized merchant ships which had been licensed to operate in the disputed area by the Argentine government. An Argentine warship did the same to a Chilean-licensed American ship in 1877. This action nearly led to war in November 1878, when the Argentines dispatched a squadron of warships to the [[Santa Cruz River (Argentina)|Santa Cruz River]]. The Chilean Navy responded in kind, and war was only avoided by a hastily signed treaty. Each government was distracted in the next few years, Argentina's with intensified [[Conquest of the Desert|military operations against the indigenous population]] (1870–84), and Chile's with the [[War of the Pacific]] (''Guerra del Pacífico'', 1879–83) against Bolivia and Peru. Still, several warships were ordered by both nations: the Chileans ordered a [[protected cruiser]], {{ship|Chilean cruiser|Esmeralda|1883|2}}, while the Argentines contracted for two warships, the [[central battery ship|central battery]] [[ironclad warship|ironclad]] {{ship|ARA|Almirante Brown|1880|2}} and protected cruiser [[ARA Patagonia (1885)|''Patagonia'']].&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 45–46, 347; Garrett, "Beagle Channel," 85–87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887, the Chilean government added [[Pound sterling|£]]3,129,500 to the budget for its fleet, at the time still centered on two aging central battery ironclads, {{ship|Chilean ironclad|Almirante Cochrane||2}} and {{ship|Chilean ironclad|Blanco Encalada||2}}, from the 1870s. They ordered the battleship {{ship|Chilean battleship|Capitán Prat||2}}, two protected cruisers, and two [[torpedo boat]]s; their [[keel laying|keels were laid]] in 1890. The Argentine government quickly responded with an order for two battleships, [[ARA Independencia (1891)|''Independencia'']] and [[ARA Libertad (1892)|''Libertad'']], beginning a naval [[arms race]] between the two countries. It continued through the 1890s, even after the expensive [[Chilean Civil War of 1891|Chilean Civil War]] (1891). The two countries alternated cruiser orders between 1890 and 1895, each marking a small increase in capabilities from the ship previous. Argentina escalated the race in July 1895 by buying an [[armored cruiser]], {{ship|ARA|Garibaldi||2}}, from Italy. Chile responded by ordering its own armored cruiser, {{ship|Chilean cruiser|O'Higgins|1897|2}}, and six torpedo boats; the Argentine government quickly ordered another armored cruiser from the Italian engineering company [[Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C.|Ansaldo]], and later ordered two more.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 45–49, 297–98, 347.&lt;/ref&gt;

The race slowed for a few years after [[Puna de Atacama dispute|a boundary dispute in the Puna de Atacama]] region was successfully mediated in 1899 by the [[United States Ambassador to Argentina|American ambassador to Argentina]], [[William Paine Lord]], but more ships were ordered by both countries in 1901. The Argentine Navy bought two more armored cruisers from Italy, and the Chilean Navy replied with orders for two ''Constitución''-class [[pre-dreadnought battleship|pre-dreadnought]] battleships from British shipyards. The Argentines replied by signing letters of intent with Ansaldo in May 1901 to buy two larger battleships.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 49–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing dispute disturbed members of the British government, as war looked like a very real possibility, and an armed conflict would disrupt the extensive British commercial interests in the area. Argentina and Chile both imported British-made goods, while the United Kingdom imported large amounts of Argentine grain, most shipped through the River Plate, and Chilean nitrates.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 52; Massie, ''Castles'', 204.&lt;/ref&gt; The British government mediated negotiations between the two countries through their [[Envoy (title)|envoy]] in Chile. These [[Pacts of May|were successfully concluded]] on 28 May 1902 with three pacts. The third limited the naval armaments of both countries; both were barred from acquiring any further warships for five years without giving the other eighteen months' advance notice. The warships under construction were sold to the United Kingdom and Japan: Chile's battleships became the former's {{sclass-|Swiftsure|battleship|4}}, and Argentina's armored cruisers the latter's {{sclass-|Kasuga|cruiser|4}}. It is not clear if the two planned Argentine battleships were ordered, but in any case the plans were quickly scuttled. ''Capitán Prat'', ''Garibaldi'', and ''Pueyrredón'' were disarmed with the exception of their main batteries, as there was no crane capable of removing the cruisers' gun turrets.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 49–52; Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's navy fell into disrepair and obsolescence after an [[Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil#Republican coup|1889 coup d'État]], which deposed [[Politics of the Empire of Brazil|Emperor]] [[Dom (title)|Dom]] [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], [[Revolta da Armada|two naval revolts]] (1891 and 1893–94), the [[Federalist Riograndense Revolution (Brazil)|Federalist Revolution]] (1893–95), and the [[War of Canudos]] (1896–97).&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 148; Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 56, 67; Brook, ''Warships for Export'', 133; Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 32; Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 240.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|In 1893, Rear Admiral [[Custódio José de Mello]], the minister of the navy, revolted against President [[Floriano Peixoto]], bringing nearly all of the Brazilian warships currently in the country with him. Mello's forces took [[Florianópolis|Desterro]] when the governor surrendered, and began to coordinate with secessionists in the southern province of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], but loyal Brazilian forces overwhelmed them both. Most of the rebel naval forces were sailed to Argentina, where their crews surrendered; the flagship, {{ship|Brazilian battleship|Aquidabã||2}}, held out near Desterro until it was sunk by a torpedo boat.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 67–76, 352.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The navy had just forty-five percent of its authorized personnel in 1896, and amid quickly improving naval technology, the only modern armored ships were two small coast-defense vessels launched in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 16; Sondhaus, ''Naval Warfare'', 216; Scheina, "Brazil," 403.&lt;/ref&gt; With such dilapidated defenses, [[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco|José Paranhos Jr., the Baron of Rio Branco]] and [[Foreign Minister of Brazil]], stated "In such conditions, you ... understand how upset I am and all the worries I have. All that still protects [Brazil] is the moral force and old prestige still left from [the Imperial era] when there was still foresight in this land..."&lt;ref&gt;Viana Filho, ''A vida do Barão do Rio Branco'', 445.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|A professional diplomat and the son of the famed [[José Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco|Viscount of Rio Braco]], the Baron of Rio Branco was named as Brazil's Foreign Minister in 1902 after a distinguished career as a diplomat, and served there until his death in 1912. In that time, he oversaw the signing of many treaties and mediated territorial disputes between Brazil and its neighbors, and became a famous name in his own right.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Meanwhile, although the Argentine–Chilean agreement had limited their naval expansion, they still retained the numerous vessels built in the interim,&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 45–52; Garrett, "Beagle Channel," 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; so by the turn of the 20th century the Brazilian Navy lagged far behind its Argentine and Chilean counterparts in quality and total tonnage.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 50–51; Martins, "Colossos do mares," 75; Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil's huge advantage in population—it had almost three times the population of Argentina, close to five times that of Chile, and nearly double of the two combined—led the Brazilian government to believe that it should assume a leading role in naval affairs on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, "Brazil," 403; Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 32.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The countries' actual naval tonnages were {{convert|36896|LT|t}} for Chile, {{convert|34425|LT|t}} for Argentina, and {{convert|27661|LT|t}} for Brazil, while the populations were estimated by Livermore at three&amp;nbsp;million, five&amp;nbsp;million, and fourteen&amp;nbsp;million, respectively.&lt;ref name="Livermore32"&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 32.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while the population statistics are significant, this needs to be put into its proper economic context: [[Angus Maddison]] and the scholars continuing his work in quantitative [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] history have shown that Argentina and Chile's 1904 [[gross domestic product]] per capita were $3,191 and $2,287 (respectively) in 1990 [[Geary–Khamis dollar|international dollars]], juxtaposed against just $713 for Brazil. These are four-and-a-half and three times greater than Brazil's. By 1910, the disparity had grown: Argentina and Chile's GDP per capita was five and four times larger, respectively.&lt;ref name="Maddison"&gt;Bolt and van Zanden, "Maddison Project."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The late nineteenth and early twentieth century demand for coffee and rubber led to Brazil's [[Coffee production in Brazil#History|coffee economy]] and [[rubber boom]]. At the time, it was estimated that seventy-five to eighty percent of the world's coffee supply was grown in Brazil, particularly in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], [[Minas Gerais|Minas Geraes]], and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]. The resulting profits meant that the Brazilian government collected much more revenue than in previous years.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, "Coffee 'Valorization'," 528–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, there was an effort on the part of prominent Brazilian politicians, most notably [[Pinheiro Machado (politician)|Pinheiro Machado]] and Rio Branco, to have the country recognized as an international power. A strong navy was seen as crucial to this goal.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 14; Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pedro II of Brazil - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], the [[Emperor of Brazil]], was deposed in an [[Decline and fall of Pedro II of Brazil#Republican coup|1889 ''coup d'état'']].]]
The [[National Congress of Brazil]] passed a large naval acquisition program on 14 December 1904, but it was two years before any ships were ordered or purchased, and while Rio Branco suggested purchasing used warships to fill the gap, nothing came of it. By 1906, two factions had developed over which types of ships should be ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80; Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 156–58; Scheina, "Brazil," 403; Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 240.&lt;/ref&gt; One, supported by the British armament company [[Armstrong Whitworth]] (which eventually received the order), favored a navy centered on a small number of large warships. The other, supported by Rio Branco, preferred a larger navy composed of smaller warships.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80; Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 80, 128, 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Rio Branco, in support of this measure, stated that "with six small battleships we would be much better. If we lost one or two in combat, there would be still four or five left to fight with. But with three [larger battleships]? With two damaged or destroyed, we would be left with one only."&lt;ref&gt;Viana Filho, ''A vida do Barão do Rio Branco'', 446.&lt;/ref&gt;

At first, the smaller warships faction prevailed. After Law no. 1452 was passed on 30 December 1905, which authorized £4,214,550 for new warship construction (£1,685,820 in 1906), three small battleships, three [[armored cruiser]]s, six [[destroyer]]s, twelve [[torpedo boat]]s, three [[submarine]]s, a [[Collier (ship)|collier]], and a [[training ship]] were ordered.&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 108; Scheina, ''Naval History'', 80; Brook, ''Warships for Export'', 133; Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 147; Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 75, 78; Alger, "Professional Notes," 1051–52.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Brazilian government later eliminated the armored cruisers for monetary reasons, the Minister of the Navy, Admiral [[Júlio César de Noronha]], signed a contract with Armstrong Whitworth for the planned battleships on 23 July 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Martins, ''A marinha brasileira'', 80; Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 240–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British ambassador to Brazil was opposed to the planned naval expansion, even though the orders went to a British company, for its large cost and its negative effects on relations between Brazil and Argentina.

{{main article |Minas Geraes-class battleship | l1 = ''Minas Geraes''-class battleship}}
After construction began on Brazil's three new small battleships, the Brazilian government reconsidered their order and chosen battleship design (something that would happen [[#Reciprocation: Brazil orders again|several more times]] during the construction of [[HMS Agincourt (1913)|''Rio de Janeiro'']] in 1913). This was wrought by the debut of the United Kingdom's new [[dreadnought]] concept, which was represented by the surprisingly fast construction and [[ship commissioning|commissioning]] of [[HMS Dreadnought (1906)|the eponymous ship]] in 1906. The hallmark of this new warship type was its "all-big-gun" armament, which utilized many more heavy-caliber weapons than previous battleships, and it rendered the Brazilian ships obsolete before they were completed.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 81; Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 246; "Brazilian Battleship 'Minas Geraes'—Most Powerful Fighting Ship Afloat," ''Scientific American'', 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian order for what contemporary commentators called "the most powerful battleship[s] in the world" came at a time when few countries in the world had contracted for such armament.&lt;ref&gt;"The Mystery of the Great Brazilian Dreadnoughts," ''World's Work'', 10867; Earle, "Professional Notes," 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Brazil was the third country to have a dreadnought under construction, behind the United Kingdom, with {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|2}} and the {{sclass-|Bellerophon|battleship|4}}, and the United States, with the {{sclass-|South Carolina|battleship|4}}.

Rio Branco, through a [[telegram]] sent to the Brazilian ambassador to the United States [[Joaquim Nabuco]], based his counter-argument in the close relationship between Brazilian and American governments, saying "The old and cordial friendship between our countries is known, as well as the excellent relations existing between their governments.

They may be leaders of a great fleet which minor government are said to be preparing to build; or, to put it more accurately, to stand sponsors for.

But every statesmen and naval student may make his own guess.&lt;ref&gt;"The Mystery of the Great Brazilian Battleships," ''World's Work'', 10867–68.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the other side of the Atlantic, in the midst of the [[Anglo–German naval arms race]], members of the British [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] fretted over the battleships' possible destinations, though the Admiralty consistently stated that they did not believe any sale would occur. In mid-July and September 1908, the Commons discussed purchasing the ships to bolster the Royal Navy and ensure they would not be sold to a foreign rival, which would disrupt the British naval plan set in place by the "[[Naval Defence Act 1889|two-power standard]]," though in March and late July 1908, the Brazilian government officially denied any sale was planned.&lt;ref&gt;Трубицын, ''Линкоры'', 6; Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 246; "Naval Policy," ''Times'' (London), 24 March 1908, 6e; "Battleships for Brazil," ''Times'' (London), 12 May 1908, 4d; "The Warships for Brazil," ''Times'' (London), 14 July 1908, 8c; "Naval and Military Intelligence," ''Times'' (London), 18 July 1908, 12c; "[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19080912.2.100 British and Foreign News]," ''Evening Post'' (Wellington), 12 September 1908, 13; "Naval and Military Intelligence," ''Times'' (London), 22 March 1909, 9e.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1909, the British press and House of Commons began pushing for more dreadnoughts after the [[First Lord of the Admiralty]], [[Reginald McKenna]], asserted that Germany had stepped up its building schedule and would complete thirteen dreadnoughts in 1911—four more than previously estimated. Naturally, the subject of purchasing the Brazilian dreadnoughts already being built was brought up, and McKenna had to officially deny that the government was planning to tender an offer for the warships.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19090319&amp;id=r_ogAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cHUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5736,1907003 May Take Brazil's Ships], ''Day'' (New London), 19 March 1909, 7; "The Brazilian Battleships," ''Times'' (London), 23 March 1909, 6d; "House of Commons," ''Times'' (London), 23 March 1909, 12a; "The Brazilian Battleships," ''Times'' (London), 25 March 1909, 7b; "[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fjlVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cJUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7318,4022938 The Naval Scare]," ''Sydney Mail'', 24 March 1909, 24; "[http://www.fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2014/New%20York%20NY%20Herald/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909/New%20York%20NY%20Herald%201909%20-%202776.pdf England's Power on the Sea Safe]," ''New York Herald'', 25 March 1909, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that a sale to a foreign nation would be inconsequential, as "our present superiority in strength in 1909–10 is so great that no alarm would be created in the mind of the Board of Admiralty."&lt;ref&gt;"The Brazilian Battleships," ''Times'' (London), 25 March 1909, 7b.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the plethora of rumors, the Brazilian government was not planning to sell their ships. Dreadnoughts formed an important role in Rio Branco's goal of raising Brazil's international status:

{{quote|Brazil begins to feel the importance of her great position, the part she may play in the world, and is taking measures in a beginner's degree commensurate with that realization.

Dr. Ruy Barboza did not oppose the details of representation on the international arbitral tribunal out of antipathy to the United States, but because he believed that the sovereignty of Brazil was at least equal to that of any other sovereign nation, and because he was convinced that unequal representation on that tribunal would result in the establishment of 'categories of sovereignty'—a thing utterly opposed to the philosophy of equal sovereign rights.{{efn-ua|''cf''.

Argentina was highly alarmed by the Brazilian move, and they quickly moved to nullify the remaining months of the naval-limiting restrictions in the 1902 pact with Chile.&lt;ref&gt;Трубицын, ''Линкоры'', 3; Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1906, Argentina's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs, International Trade and Worship|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Manuel Augusto Montes de Oca|es}}, remarked that any one of the new Brazilian vessels could destroy the entire Argentine and Chilean fleets.&lt;ref name="Filho76"&gt;Martins, "Colossos do mares," 76.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the seeming hyperbole, his statement—made before the Brazilian government reordered the ships as dreadnoughts—ended up being close to the truth: in 1910, at least, the new Brazilian warships were seemingly stronger than any other vessel in the world, let alone any one ship in the Argentine or Chilean fleets.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, ''Dreadnought'', 72; Scheina, "Argentina," 400.&lt;/ref&gt; With this in mind, the ''Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers'' opined that maintaining the older ''Libertad'' class or ''Capitán Prat'' (respectively) was now a waste of money.&lt;ref&gt;"The Status of South American Navies," ''Naval Engineers'', 256.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine government's alarm continued under de Oca's successor, [[Estanislao Zeballos]]. In June 1908, Zeballos presented a plan to the Argentine Congress where they would offer the Brazilian government a chance to give one of their two unfinished dreadnoughts to Argentina. This would allow the two countries a chance to enjoy relative naval parity. Should the Brazilians refuse, Zeballos planned to issue an ultimatum: if they did not comply in eight days, the mobilized Argentine Army would invade what the army and navy ministers claimed was a defenseless Rio de Janeiro. Unfortunately for Zeballos, his plan was leaked to the media, and the resulting public outcry—Argentine citizens happened to not be in favor of their government borrowing large sums of money to mobilize the army and go to war—ensured his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsfeld, "Falsificando telegramas," 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The end of Zeballos' tenure as Foreign Minister was extremely contentious, as another controversy closely linked to him began shortly after his resignation. The Argentine government, fearing a Brazilian–Chilean alliance, paid particular attention to the two countries' communications, leading to the now-famous Telegram no. 9. This communication, sent from the Brazilian government to their representatives in Chile, was intercepted by the Argentine government and supposedly decoded in Zeballos' last days as minister. It was read in a congressional session one day after Zeballos' departure, and the new Minister of Foreign Affairs claimed it was proof of intended Brazilian aggression against Argentina. The full but fraudulent contents of the telegram were released by Zeballos to the press, which kindled international disenchantment with Brazil. However, in a public relations coup, Rio Branco released the [[cipher]] and actual full contents of the telegram, which proved it contained no reference to belligerent Brazilian intents on Argentina. The actual telegram was then printed in several prominent Argentine newspapers. Zeballos was later accused of deliberately distorting or forging the telegram, though there was no definitive proof; it may have been his secretary. Whatever Zeballos' culpability, his actions in that June may have been motivated by a personal vendetta against Rio Branco, who had bested Zeballos on several occasions since 1875, most notably during a border dispute arbitrated by American President Grover Cleveland (the [[Question of Palms]], or ''Questão de Palmas'').&lt;ref&gt;Viana Filho, ''A vida do Barão do Rio Branco'', 441–44; Heinsfeld, "Falsificando telegramas," 1–2, 5–10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Argentine government was also deeply concerned with the possible effect on the country's large export trade, as a Brazilian blockade of the entrance to the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]] would cripple the Argentine economy. The acquisition of dreadnoughts to maintain an equal footing with Brazil would, in the words of the Argentine admiral overseeing his countries' dreadnoughts while they were being constructed, avoid a "preponderance of power on the other side, where a sudden gust of popular feeling or injured pride might make [a blockade] a dangerous weapon against us."&lt;ref&gt;"[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2249&amp;dat=19100604&amp;id=upU-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kVkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=805,4380508 A Message From Garcia]," ''Boston Evening Transcript'', 4 June 1910, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both countries faced difficulty in financing their own dreadnoughts.

After the Argentine government sent a naval delegation to Europe to solicit and evaluate armament companies' offers,&lt;ref name=Livermore33/&gt; they received tenders from fifteen shipyards in five countries (the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, and Italy), and conducted a [[Rivadavia-class battleship#Bidding|drawn-out bidding process]].

This second request went not only to British builders but to all the builders of the world, and in this way it is exceedingly probable that a serious leakage of ideas and practice of our ships was disseminated through the world by the Argentine government. ... The third inquiry that was issued showed to all the builders of the world what has been eliminated or modified in the second inquiry; and so the process of leakage went merrily on, and with it that of the education of foreign builders and the Argentine government.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 84.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The United States' [[Fore River Shipyard|Fore River Ship and Engine Company]] tendered the lowest bid—in part owing to the availability of cheap steel, though they were accused of quoting an unprofitable price so the ships could act as [[loss leader]]s—and was awarded the contract.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, ''Big Battleship'', 22; Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This aroused further suspicion in the European bidders, who had previously believed that the United States was a non-contender, though Argentina did order twelve destroyers from British, French, and German shipyards to soften the blow.{{efn-ua|Four were ordered from each country, but only the German-built destroyers of the {{sclass-|Catamarca|destroyer|5}} and {{sclass-|La Plata|destroyer|4}}es would go on to serve in the Argentine Navy. Of the other eight, the British-built destroyers were purchased by Greece shortly before the [[First Balkan War]] (the ''Aetos'' or [[Wild Beast-class destroyer (1912)|Wild Beast class]]), and the French-built ships were taken over by that country at the outbreak of the First World War (the [[Aventurier-class destroyer|''Aventurier'' class]]).&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, "Argentina," 400.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  These bidders, along with newspapers like the ''Times'' (London), turned their anger on the American government under President [[William Howard Taft]], whose so-called "[[Dollar Diplomacy]]" policy had led his State Department to go to great lengths to obtain the contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 36–39.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The United States offered Argentina certain economic and military concessions: the removal of import tariffs on [[Hide (skin)|hides]] from Argentina, an offer to release the Americans' most technologically advanced [[fire-control system]] and [[torpedo tube]]s for use on the Argentine ships, and promises for additional concessions if American shipbuilders were selected. American bankers were also persuaded to offer a US$10&amp;nbsp;million loan to the Argentine government.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 83; Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the United States' {{USS|Delaware|BB-28|2}} was sent on ten-week South American voyage in 1911 to support these efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts to win the Argentine and Chilean battleship orders came as part of a widespread and mostly unsuccessful effort to obtain naval contracts from countries from China to Europe to Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, "American Navy," 875–76.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Their reactions may have been justified: Taft boasted in the high-profile 1910 [[State of the Union address]] that the Argentine dreadnought order was awarded to American manufacturers "largely through the good offices of the Department of State."&lt;ref&gt;William Howard Taft, "[[:wikisource:William Howard Taft's Second State of the Union Address|Second State of the Union Address]]," 6 December 1910.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Argentine contract included an [[Option (finance)|option]] for a third dreadnought in case the Brazilian government adhered to its contractual obligations to order a third dreadnought. Two newspapers, [[La Prensa (Buenos Aires)|''La Prensa'']] and [[La Nación|''La Argentina'']], heavily advocated for a third ship; the latter even started a petition to raise money for a new battleship.&lt;ref name=Livermore44&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The American minister to Argentina, [[Charles H. Sherrill (ambassador)|Charles H. Sherrill]], cabled back to the United States that "this newspaper rivalry promises the early conclusion of a movement which means a third battleship whether by public subscription or by Government funds."&lt;ref&gt;Sherrill to [[Philander C. Knox]], No. 415, 11 June 1910, S.D.F., Argentina, in Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 44.&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 1910, the Argentine government decided against constructing the ship, after [[Roque Sáenz Peña]], who had been making entreaties to Brazil to end the expensive naval race, was elected to the Presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the intended target of the third Argentine dreadnought, the third Brazilian dreadnought, had already been canceled multiple times.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 249, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The third dreadnought, which was provided for in the original contract and would have been named ''Rio de Janeiro'', was laid down on 16 March 1910. As the ship had already been eclipsed by new naval technology (chiefly the advent of [[super-dreadnought]]s, beginning with the British {{HMS|Orion|1910|2}}), the Brazilian government canceled it on 7 May and asked Armstrong to prepare a new design. The new contract was signed in October, but by November a new naval minister was appointed who had a different design in mind. ''cf.'' [[#Reciprocation: Brazil orders again|Reciprocation: Brazil orders again]].&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 249–63, 281–82.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Chilean government delayed their naval plans after a financial [[depression (economics)|depression]] brought on by the [[1906 Valparaíso earthquake]] and a drastic fall in the [[nitrate]] market in 1907, but these economic problems were not enough to stop them from countering the dreadnoughts purchased by their traditional rival Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Livermore and Grant, who cites Livermore's work, both attribute part of this delay to a 1908 earthquake,&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 168; Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 40.&lt;/ref&gt; but no major earthquake hit Chile in that year, ''cf.'' [[List of earthquakes in Chile]]. However, the [[1906 Valparaíso earthquake|Valparaíso earthquake]] of 1906 caused nearly 4,000 deaths, a tsunami, and a wide swath of destruction over the Chilean capital and surrounding areas. Given this, and at least one primary source's confirmation that the plans were delayed by the Valparaíso earthquake,&lt;ref&gt;"The Status of South American Navies," ''Naval Engineers'', 257.&lt;/ref&gt; it seems likely that Livermore's 1908 earthquake was a simple typographical error inadvertently repeated in Grant's account.}} While Argentina's principal concern was with Brazil, Chile also wished to respond to Peruvian military acquisitions.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 146–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Money for a naval building program was allocated in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;"Acorazado Almirante Latorre," ''Unidades Navales''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Chilean government solicited bids from several armament companies, nearly all believed that a British company would win the contract; the American [[Military attaché|naval attaché]] opined that without anything short of a revolution the contracts were destined for the United Kingdom. The Chilean Navy had cultivated extensive ties with the United Kingdom's Royal Navy since the 1830s, when Chilean naval officers were given places on British ships to receive training and experience they could bring back to their country. This relationship had recently been cemented when a British [[naval mission]] was requested by Chile and sent in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the American and German governments attempted to swing sentiment to their side by dispatching modern naval vessels ({{USS|Delaware|BB-28|2}} and {{SMS|Von der Tann||2}}, respectively) to Chilean ports. Their efforts were futile, and the design tendered by Armstrong Whitworth was chosen on 25 July 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other navies ===
Other South American navies, having limited resources and little expertise in operating large warships, were in no state to respond. The [[Peruvian Navy]], fourth largest on the continent, had been decimated during the [[Naval Campaign of the War of the Pacific|naval campaign]] of the [[War of the Pacific]] against Chile (1879–83). It took the Peruvian government more than twenty years to order new warships—the {{sclass-|Almirante Grau|cruiser|4}} ([[BAP Almirante Grau (1906)|''Almirante Grau'']] and [[BAP Coronel Bolognesi (1906)|''Coronel Bolognesi'']]), scout cruisers delivered in 1906 and 1907. They were augmented by two submarines and a destroyer ordered from France.&lt;ref&gt;Schenia, "Peru," 409–10.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Almirante Grau'' was only intended to be the fleet's flagship until a more powerful warship was purchased; along with ''Coronel Bolognesi'', they would be the "pioneers" of a modern navy.&lt;ref&gt;"New Peruvian Warships," ''Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers'', 581–83.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Proceedings'' reported in 1905 that this new navy would be composed of three [[Swiftsure-class battleship|''Swiftsure'']]-like pre-dreadnoughts, three armored cruisers, six destroyers, and numerous smaller warships, all acquired as part of a nine-year, $7&amp;nbsp;million outlay.&lt;ref&gt;"Fleets in Preparation," ''Proceedings'', 740.&lt;/ref&gt;

None of these plans came to fruition. The closest major expansion came in 1912, when the Peruvian Navy had an agreement to acquire an obsolete French armored cruiser in 1912 ({{ship|French cruiser|Dupuy de Lôme||2}}) for three million [[French franc|francs]]. The Peruvian government paid one of a planned three planned installments, but the purchase came under criticism at home for not being able to change any balance of power with Chile. When a potential cruiser purchase by Ecuador fell through, the Peruvians quit paying for the ship, which was later converted to a merchant ship and scrapped in 1923.&lt;ref&gt;Feron, "The Cruiser Dupuy-de-Lôme," 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other South American navies also added smaller vessels to their naval forces in the same time period. The [[National Navy of Uruguay|Uruguayan Navy]] acquired a {{convert|1400|LT|t|0|adj=on}} gunboat in 1910, while the [[Bolivarian Armada of Venezuela|Venezuelan Navy]] bought an ex-Spanish {{convert|1125|LT|t|adj=on}} [[protected cruiser]], [[USS Isla de Cuba (1886)|''Mariscal Sucre'']], from the United States in 1912. The [[Ecuadorian Navy]] added a Chilean torpedo boat to its fleet in 1907, complementing its fleet of two [[aviso]]s, both around {{convert|800|LT|t}}, two small steamers, and one minor coast guard ship.&lt;ref&gt;Schenia, "Ecuador," 414; Schenia, "Uruguay," 424–25; Schenia, "Venezuela," 425; "The Status of South American Navies," ''Naval Engineers'', 254–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reciprocation: Brazil orders again ==

=== ''Rio de Janeiro'' ===
{{main article|HMS Agincourt (1913)|l1=HMS ''Agincourt'' (1913)}}
After the first Brazilian dreadnought, ''Minas Geraes'', was launched, the Brazilian government began an extended campaign to remove the third dreadnought from the contract because of political—backlash from the [[Revolt of the Lash]] coupled with warming relations with Argentina—and economic reasons. After much negotiating and attempts from Armstrong to hold the Brazilian government to the contract, the Brazilians relented, due in part to lower bond rates that made it possible for the government to borrow the necessary money. ''Rio de Janeiro'' was laid down for the first time in March 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 247–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agincourt postcard.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|''Agincourt'' depicted prior to its British modifications, which included the removal of the flying bridge between the funnels seen here.]]
By May, the Brazilian government asked Armstrong to stop work on the new warship and to submit new designs which took in the most recent advance in naval technology, [[super-dreadnought]]s. [[Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, 1st Baronet|Eustace Tennyson-d'Eyncourt]] served as Armstrong's liaison to Brazil. The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']] specifies this design as a {{convert|655|ft|m|adj=on}} long [[length overall|overall]], {{convert|32000|LT|t|adj=on}} ship mounting twelve 14-inch guns and costing near £3,000,000. The many requests made by the Brazilian Navy for minor changes delayed the contract signing until 10 October 1910, and the battleship's keel laying was delayed further by a [[Labor unrest|labor dispute]] with the [[Worshipful Company of Shipwrights]], which led to a [[Lockout (industry)|lockout]]. During these delays, a new Minister of the Navy, Admiral [[Marques Leão]], was appointed to replace de Alencar—an important development, as the contract stipulated that the design could only proceed with the approval of the new Minister. Again, however, the Brazilian Navy found itself torn between two schools of thought: Leão and others in the navy favored a reversion to the 12-inch gun, but others, led by the outgoing Minister of the Navy (de Alencar) and the head of the Brazilian naval commission in the United Kingdom (Rear Admiral {{Interlanguage link multi|Duarte Huet de Bacelar Pinto Guedes|pt}}), were strongly in favor of obtaining the ship with the largest armament—in this case, a design drawn up by Bacellar, carrying eight 16-inch guns, six 9.4-inch guns, and fourteen 6-inch guns.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 254–57, 260, 263–64, 268; ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th ed., ''s.v.'' "Ship," 906.&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Eyncourt, who had departed Brazil in October immediately after the contract was signed, returned in March 1911 to display the various design options available to the Brazilian Navy. Armstrong evidently thought the second faction would prevail, so he also took with him everything needed to close a deal on Bacellar's design. By mid-March, Armstrong's contacts in Brazil reported that Leão had convinced the recently elected President [[Hermes da Fonseca|Hermes Rodrigues da Fonseca]] to cancel the design with twelve 14-inch guns in favor of a smaller ship.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 269.&lt;/ref&gt; The credit may not have laid with Leão alone, though; da Fonseca was already dealing with multiple issues. Most importantly, he had to deal with [[#Brazilian naval revolt|the fallout]] from a large naval revolt in November 1910 (the Revolt of the Lash), which had seen three of the new vessels just purchased by the navy, along with one older coast-defense ship, mutiny against the use of corporal punishment in the navy.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

To make matters worse, the dreadnoughts' expense combined with loan payments and a worsening economy led to growing [[government debt]] compounded by [[Government budget deficit|budget deficits]]. By one measure of Brazil's [[Gross domestic product|GDP per capita]], income in the country rose from $718 in 1905 to a high of $836 in 1911 before declining over the next three years to a low of $780 in 1914 (both measured in 1990&amp;nbsp;[[Geary–Khamis dollar|international&amp;nbsp;dollars]]). It did not fully recover until after the First World War.&lt;ref name="Maddison"/&gt; At the same time, Brazil's external and internal debt reached $500 and $335&amp;nbsp;million (respectively, in contemporaneous dollar amounts) by 1913, partly through rising deficits, which were $22&amp;nbsp;million in 1908 and $47&amp;nbsp;million by 1912.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Latin America'', 37.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, the president commented negatively on the new ship:

{{quote|When I assumed office, I found that my predecessor had signed a contract for the building of the battleship ''Rio de Janeiro'', a vessel of 32,000&amp;nbsp;tons, with an armament of 14-inch guns. Considerations of every kind pointed to the inconvenience of acquiring such a vessel and to the revision of the contract in the sense of reducing the tonnage. This was done, and we shall possess a powerful unit which will not be built on exaggerated lines such as have not as yet stood the time of experience.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 354.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

D'Eyncourt probably avoided proposing any design with 16-inch guns when he saw the political situation. In meetings with Leão, designs of only ten 12-inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong as that of the ''Minas Geraes'' class, but a design with no less than ''fourteen'' 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the ''Minas Geraes'' class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 280.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sultan Osman I fitting out.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|''Sultân Osmân-ı Evvel'', previously ''Rio de Janeiro'' and soon to be ''Agincourt'', fitting-out.]]
After numerous requests for design alterations from the Brazilian Navy were accommodated or rejected, a contract was signed for a ship with fourteen 12-inch guns on 3 June 1911 for £2,675,000, and ''Rio de Janeiro''{{'}}s keel was laid for the fourth time on 14 September. It did not take long for the Brazilian government to reconsider their decision again;&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "The Brazilian Dreadnought," 284.&lt;/ref&gt; by mid-1912, battleships with 14-inch guns were under construction, and suddenly it seemed that ''Rio de Janeiro'' would be outclassed upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, ''Warships for Export'', 133; Vanterpool, "The 'Riachuelo'," 140; Gill, "Professional Notes," 492.&lt;/ref&gt; Making matters worse, a European depression after the end of the [[Second Balkan War]] in August 1913 reduced Brazil's ability to obtain foreign loans. This coincided with a collapse in Brazil's coffee and rubber exports, the latter due to the loss of the [[Rubber boom#The end of the Amazon's rubber monopoly|Brazilian rubber monopoly]] to British plantations in the Far East. The price of coffee declined by 20 percent and Brazilian exports of it dropped 12.5 percent between 1912 and 1913; rubber saw a similar decline of 25 and 36.6 percent, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, ''Latin America and the War'', 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Brazilian Navy later claimed that selling ''Rio de Janeiro'' was a tactical decision, so they could have two divisions of battleships: two with 12-inch guns (the ''Minas Geraes'' class), and two with 15-inch guns.&lt;ref&gt;Gill, "Professional Notes," 492.&lt;/ref&gt;

Armstrong studied whether replacing the 12-inch guns with seven 15-inch guns would be feasible, but Brazil was probably already attempting to sell the ship. In the tension building up to the First World War, many countries, including Russia, Italy, Greece, and the Ottoman Empire, were interested in purchasing the ship. While Russia quickly dropped out, Italy and the rival Greeks and Ottomans were all highly interested. The Italians seemed close to purchasing the ship until the French government decided to back the Greeks—rather than allow the Italians, who were the principal naval rivals of the French, to obtain the ship. The Grecian government made an offer for the original purchase price plus an additional £50,000, but as the Greeks worked to obtain an initial installment, the Ottoman government was also making offers.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian government rejected an Ottoman proposal to swap ships, with Brazil's ''Rio de Janeiro'' going to the Ottomans and [[Ottoman battleship Reşadiye|''Reşadiye'']] going to Brazil, presumably with some amount of money. The Brazilian government would only accept a monetary offer. Lacking this, the Ottomans were forced to find a loan. Fortunately for them, they were able to obtain one from a French banker acting independent of his government, and the Ottoman Navy secured the ''Rio de Janeiro'' on 29 December 1913 for £1,200,000 as-is.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 284; Gill, "Professional Notes," 555.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|The surprise acquisition of ''Rio de Janeiro'' by the Ottomans alarmed the Greek government, due to what contemporary commentators called the "[assured Ottoman] naval superiority over Greece."&lt;ref name="Turkish Navy"/&gt; The Greeks scrambled to put offers together for ''Almirante Latorre'' or one of the Argentine dreadnoughts to counter the Ottoman purchase, which would have given them two dreadnoughts by the end of 1914 (the other being ''Reşadiye'', later taken over by the British and renamed {{HMS|Erin||2}}). Greece would only have {{ship|Greek battleship|Salamis||2}}, which was being built in Germany and scheduled for completion in March 1915, and two entirely obsolete pre-dreadnoughts, {{ship|Greek battleship|Kilkis||2}} and {{ship|Greek battleship|Lemnos||2}}, purchased from the United States in May 1914 to avert what seemed to be an imminent war.&lt;ref&gt;Kaldis, "Background for Conflict," D1135, D1139; Mach, "Greece," 384; Gill, "Professional Notes," 1217–18.&lt;/ref&gt;}} As part of the purchase contract, the remainder of the ship was constructed with £2,340,000 in Ottoman money.&lt;ref name="Turkish Navy"&gt;"[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15488993 Turkish Navy]," ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 31 December 1913, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Renamed ''Sultân Osmân-ı Evvel'', it was eventually taken over by the British shortly after the beginning of the First World War, serving with the Royal Navy as {{HMS|Agincourt|1913|6}}.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 284, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|This action is commonly cited as a major reason in the Ottoman decision to join the [[Central Powers]] and enter the First World War, but historians have disputed this claim, using as evidence the signing of a secret alliance between the German and Ottoman Empires on 2 August 1914 and the lack of any response to the United Kingdom's offer of compensation for the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, ''British Battleships'', 597.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Argentine government authorized a third dreadnought in October 1912 in case ''Rio de Janeiro'' was completed and delivered, but the ship was never named or built.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Latin America'', 321; Трубицын, ''Линкоры'', 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Riachuelo'' ===
After selling ''Rio de Janeiro'', the Brazilian government asked Armstrong and Vickers to prepare designs for a new battleship, something strongly supported by the [[Navy League of Brazil]] (''Liga Maritima'').&lt;ref&gt;Oakenfull, ''Brazil'', 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Armstrong agreed to construct the ship without any further payments from Brazil. They replied with at least fourteen designs, six from Vickers (December 1913 through March 1914) and eight from Armstrong (February 1914). Vickers' designs varied between eight and ten 15-inch and eight 16-inch guns, with speeds between 22 and 25&amp;nbsp;knots (the lower-end ships having mixed firing, the higher using oil), and displacements between {{convert|26000|t|LT}} and {{convert|30500|t|LT}}. Armstrong took two basic designs, one with eight and the other with ten 15-inch guns, and varied their speed and firing.&lt;ref name="Topliss285-86"&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 285–86.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Topliss (1985), in writing a design history of the four Brazilian dreadnoughts, makes no mention of Vanterpool's (1969) article, which detailed four substantially different designs prepared in October 1913 by Armstrong. Sturton (1970), whose article was written in direct reply to Vanterpool, found that designs were submitted after that date and that one, bearing little resemblance to anything uncovered by Vanterpool, was ordered. Topliss, on whose research this paragraph is largely based, appears to have expanded upon Sturton's work, but does not include the designs detailed by Vanterpool, even though his article is listed in Topliss' sources.}}

While most secondary sources do not mention that Brazil ordered a battleship,&lt;ref&gt;Sturton, "Re: The Riachuelo," 205.&lt;/ref&gt; with the ship's entry in the warship encyclopedia ''Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships'' even remarking that "Brazil had not selected from the four design variations,"&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, "Brazil," 405.&lt;/ref&gt; the Brazilian government chose what was labeled as Design 781, the first of the eight 15-inch designs tendered by Armstrong, which also shared characteristics with the [[Queen Elizabeth-class battleship|''Queen Elizabeth'']] and [[Revenge-class battleship|''Revenge'' classes]] then being built for the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 285–86; Sturton, "Re: The Riachuelo," 205; Gill, "Professional Notes," 192.&lt;/ref&gt; They placed an order for one ship of this design, to be named ''Riachuelo'', at the Armstrong Whitworth shipyard in [[Elswick, Tyne and Wear|Elswick]] on 12 May 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 285–86; "E Rio de Janeiro," ''Navios De Guerra Brasileiros''.&lt;/ref&gt; Some preliminary gathering of materials was completed for a planned [[keel laying]] date of 10 September, but the beginning of the First World War in August 1914 delayed plans.

=== Brazilian naval revolt ===
{{main article|Revolt of the Lash}}
[[File:Sailors of Minas Geraes.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|''[[Pardo]]'' and [[Afro-Brazilian|''preto'']] Brazilian marines pose for a photographer on board ''Minas Geraes'', probably during the ship's visit to the United States in early 1913.]]
In late November 1910, a large naval revolt, later named the Revolt of the Lash, broke out in Rio de Janeiro.{{efn-ua|Other English translations include the "Revolt of the Whip" or the "Revolt against the Lash."}} The tension was kindled by the racial makeup of the navy's regular crewmembers, who were heavily black or [[mulatto]], whereas their officers were mostly white.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, "Revolt of the Lash," 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; The Baron of Rio Branco commented: "For the recruitment of marines and enlisted men, we bring aboard the dregs of our urban centers, the most worthless ''lumpen'', without preparation of any sort. Ex-slaves and the sons of slaves make up our ships' crews, most of them dark-skinned or dark-skinned mulattos."&lt;ref&gt;[[José Paranhos, Baron of Rio Branco]], in Edmar Morel, ''A Revolta da Chibata'' 4th ed. (Rio de Janeiro: Edições Graal, 1986), 13, in Morgan, "Revolt of the Lash," 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

This kind of [[impressment]], combined with the heavy use of [[corporal punishment]] for even minor offenses, meant that relations between the black crews and white officers was tepid at best. Crewmen aboard ''Minas Geraes'' began planning for a revolt in 1910. They chose [[João Cândido Felisberto]], an experienced sailor, as their leader. The mutiny was delayed several times by disagreements among the participants. In a major meeting on 13 November, some of the revolutionaries expressed a desire to revolt when the president would be inaugurated (15 November), but another leader, Francisco Dias Martins, talked them out of the idea, insisting that their demands would be overshadowed by a perceived rebellion against the political system as a whole. The immediate catalyst for their revolt came on 21 November 1910, when an Afro-Brazilian sailor, [[Marcelino Rodrigues Menezes]], was brutally flogged 250 times for insubordination.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 66–72; Morgan, "Revolt of the Lash," 33, 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|There is some scholarly confusion over the exact date of Menezes' lashing. Morgan (2003) says that it occurred at dawn on 16 November and the span between whipping and revolt was due to the need for additional planning and organization.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, "Revolt of the Lash," 33, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Love (2012), the account followed here, states that Menezes was whipped on the night of 21 November, with the revolt starting around 10 p.m. on the 22nd.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 28–29; 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Both, however, agree that the incident was the immediate cause of the uprising.}} A Brazilian government observer, former navy captain [[José Carlos de Carvalho]], stated that the sailor's back looked like "a mullet sliced open for salting."&lt;ref&gt;Presentation to Federal Congress by Federal Deputy for Rio Grande do Sul, [[José Carlos de Carvalho]], 23 November 1910, in Morel, ''Revolta'', 80–84, in Morgan, "Revolt of the Lash," 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt began aboard ''Minas Geraes'' at around 10&amp;nbsp;pm on 22 November; the ship's commander and several loyal crewmen were murdered in the process. Soon after, ''São Paulo'', the new cruiser ''Bahia'', the coast-defense ship {{ship|Brazilian coastal defense ship|Deodoro||2}}, the minelayer {{ship|Brazilian minelayer|República||2}}, the [[training ship]] {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Benjamin Constant||2}}, and the torpedo boats {{ship|Brazilian torpedo boat|Tamoio||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian torpedo boat|Timbira||2}} all revolted with relatively little violence. The first four ships represented the newest and strongest ships in the navy; ''Minas Geraes'', ''São Paulo'', and ''Bahia'' had been completed and commissioned only months before. ''Deodoro'' was twelve years old and had recently undergone a [[wikt:refit|refit]]. The crews of the smaller warships made up only two percent of the mutineers, and some moved to the largest ships after the revolt began.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 20, 28–31, 35–36; Morgan, "Revolt of the Lash," 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Key warships that remained in government hands included the old cruiser {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Almirante Barroso|1896|2}}, ''Bahia''{{'}}s sister {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}}, the eight new destroyers of the [[Pará class destroyer (1908)|''Pará'' class]]. Their crews were in a state of flux at the time: with nearly half of the navy's enlisted men in Rio at that time in open revolt, naval officers were suspicious of even those who remained loyal to the government. These suspicions were perhaps well-placed, given that radio operators on loyal ships passed on operational plans to the mutineers. Enlisted men on ships that remained in government hands were reduced wherever possible, and officers took over all of the positions that would be involved in direct combat. Further complicating matters were weapon supplies, such as the destroyer's [[torpedo]]es. These could not be fired without [[Percussion cap|firing cap]]s, yet the caps were not where they were supposed to be. When they were located and delivered, they did not fit the newer torpedoes on board the destroyers. The correct caps were fitted only 48 hours after the rebellion began.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 30–31, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Felisberto and his fellow sailors demanded an end to what they called the "slavery" being practiced by the navy, most notably the continued use of whipping despite its ban in every other Western nation. Though navy officers and the president were staunchly opposed to any sort of amnesty and made plans to attack the rebel-held ships, many legislators were supportive. Over the next three days, both houses of the Brazilian National Congress, led by the influential senator [[Rui Barbosa|Ruy Barbosa]], passed a general bill granting amnesty to all involved and ending the use of corporal punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Love, ''Revolt'', 33–47; Morgan, "Revolt of the Lash," 38–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the revolt, the two Brazilian dreadnoughts were disarmed by the removal of their guns' [[breechblock]]s. The revolt and consequent state of the navy, which was essentially unable to operate for fear of another rebellion, caused many leading Brazilians, including the president, prominent politicians like Barbosa and the Baron of Rio Branco, and the editor of the most respected newspaper in Brazil, ''[[Jornal do Commercio]]'', to question the use of the new ships and support their sale to a foreign country.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 158–59.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|On the status of ''Jornal do Commercio'' within Brazil, see Love, ''Revolt'', 3.}} The British ambassador to Brazil, W.H.D. Haggard, was ecstatic at Rio Branco's about-face, saying "This is indeed a wonderful surrender on the part of the man who was answerable for the purchase and who looked upon them as the most cherished offspring of his policy."&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Office, British National Archives, 371/1051, Haggard to [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Sir Edward Grey]], 3 February 1911, in Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the vote on the amnesty bill, Ruy Barbosa emphatically outlined his opposition to the ships:

[[File:Deck scene aboard Minas Geraes.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|''Minas Geraes'', seen from the stern of the ship.]]
{{quote|Let me, in conclusion, point out two profound lessons of the bitter situation in which we find ourselves. The first is that a military government is not one whit more able to save the country from the vicissitudes of war nor any braver or resourceful in meeting them than a civil government. The second is that the policy of great armaments has no place on the American continent. At least on our part and the part of the nations which surround us, the policy which we ought to follow with joy and hope is that of drawing closer international ties through the development of commercial relations, the peace and friendship of all the peoples who inhabit the countries of America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The experience of Brazil in this respect is decisive. All of the forces employed for twenty years in the perfecting of the means of our national defense have served, after all, to turn upon our own breasts these successive attempts at revolt. International war has not yet come to the doors of our republic. Civil war has come many times, armed by these very weapons which we have so vainly prepared for our defense against a foreign enemy. Let us do away with these ridiculous and perilous great armaments, securing international peace by means rather of just and equitable relations with our neighbors. On the American continent, at least, it is not necessary to maintain a 'peace armada'; that hideous cancer which is devouring continuously the vitals of the nations of Europe.&lt;ref name="Lambuth1433"&gt;Lambuth, "Naval Comedy," 1433.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the end, the president and cabinet decided against selling the ships because they feared it would hurt them politically. This came despite a consensus agreeing that the ships should be disposed of, possibly to fund smaller warships capable of traversing Brazil's many rivers.&lt;ref name="Grant159"&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 159.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive's apprehension was heightened by Barbosa's speech given before the revolt's end, as he also used the occasion to attack the government, or what he called the "brutal militaristic regime".&lt;ref name="Lambuth1433"/&gt; Still, the Brazilians ordered Armstrong to cease working towards laying down their third dreadnought, which induced the Argentine government to not pick up their contractual option for a third dreadnought, and the United States' ambassador to Brazil cabled home to state that the Brazilian desire for naval preeminence in Latin America was quelled, though this proved to be short-lived.&lt;ref name="Livermore45" /&gt;

Although the ''Minas Geraes'' class remained in Brazilian hands, the mutiny had a clear detrimental effect on the navy's readiness: by 1912, an Armstrong agent stated that the ships were in terrible condition, with rust already forming on turrets and boilers. The agent believed it would cost the Brazilian Navy around £700,000 to address these issues.&lt;ref name="Grant159"/&gt; Haggard tersely commented, "These ships are absolutely useless to Brazil", a sentiment echoed by ''Proceedings''.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Office, British National Archives, 371/1518, Haggard to Grey, 19 June 1913, Brazil, ''Annual Report'', 1912, in Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 160; Gill, "Professional Notes," 1257.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the government's refusal to sell the two ''Minas Geraes''-class ships and subsequent support for acquiring ''Rio de Janeiro'', some historians credit the rebellion, combined with the Baron of Rio Branco's death in 1912, as major factors in the Brazilian government's decision (which was possibly made by January 1913, but certainly by September) to sell the ship to the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, ''Rulers, Guns, and Money'', 160; Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 283.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attempted sales ===
After ''Rio de Janeiro'' was purchased by the Ottoman Empire, the Argentine government bowed to popular demand and began to seek a buyer for their two dreadnoughts. The money received in return would have been devoted to internal improvements. Three bills directing that the battleships be sold were introduced into the [[Argentine National Congress]] in mid-1914, but all were defeated. Still, the British and Germans expressed worries that the ships could be sold to a belligerent nation, while the Russian, Austrian, Ottoman, Italian, and Greek governments were all reportedly interested in buying both ships, the latter as a counter to the Ottoman purchase of ''Rio de Janeiro''.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 46–47; Hislam, "Century of Dreadnoughts," 146; "[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=PBH19140103.2.48 Turkey and Greece; Purpose of Dreadnoughts]," ''Poverty Bay Herald'', 2 January 1914, 3; "[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1915-04-27/ed-1/seq-3/ Argentine Pride Outweighs $6,000,000 Profit Greece Offers for Moreno]," ''New-York Tribune'', 27 April 1913, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Chile's ''Almirante Latorre'' in December 1921.]]
The ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' reported in late April that the Argentine government rejected a $17.5&amp;nbsp;million offer for ''Moreno'' alone, which would have netted them a large profit over the original construction cost of the ships ($12&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1915-04-27/ed-1/seq-3/ Argentine Pride Outweighs $6,000,000 Profit Greece Offers for Moreno]," ''New-York Tribune'', 27 April 1913, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States, worried that its neutrality would not be respected and its technology would be released for study to a foreign country, put diplomatic pressure on the Argentine government to keep the ships, which it eventually did.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, news outlets reported in late 1913 and early 1914 that Greece had reached an accord to purchase Chile's first battleship as a counterbalance to the Ottoman acquisition of ''Rio de Janeiro'',&lt;ref&gt;Gill, "Professional Notes," 934; "[http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1913-11-02/ed-1/seq-12/ Turkey Threatened with Another War]," ''New-York Tribune'', 2 November 1913, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; but despite a developing sentiment within Chile to sell one or both of the dreadnoughts, no deal was made.&lt;ref&gt;Kaldis, "Background for Conflict," D1135; Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

In each of the countries involved in the South American dreadnought arms race, movements arose that advocated the sale of the dreadnoughts to redirect the substantial amounts of money involved toward what they viewed as more worthy pursuits.&lt;ref name=Livermore45&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 45.&lt;/ref&gt; These costs were rightfully viewed as enormous. After the ''Minas Geraes'' class was ordered, a Brazilian newspaper equated the initial purchase cost for the original three ships as equaling 3,125 miles of [[Track (rail transport)|railroad tracks]] or 30,300 [[Homestead (buildings)|homesteads]]. Naval historian Robert Scheina put the price at [[Pound sterling|£]]6,110,100 without accounting for ammunition, which was £605,520, or necessary upgrades to docks, which was £832,000. Costs for maintenance and related issues, which in the first five years of ''Minas Geraes''{{'}}s and ''São Paulo''{{'}}s commissioned lives was about 60 percent of the initial cost, only added to the already staggering sum of money.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The two ''Rivadavia''s were purchased for nearly a fifth of the Argentine government's yearly income, a figure which did not include the later in-service costs.&lt;ref&gt;Hough, ''Big Battleship'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Robert K. Massie]] rounded the figure to a full quarter of each government's annual income.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, ''Castles'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the nationalistic sentiments that exacerbated the naval arms race gave way to slowing economies and negative public opinions which came to support investing inside the country instead.&lt;ref name="Livermore45"/&gt; Commenting on this, the United States' [[United States Ambassador to Chile|Minister to Chile]], [[Henry Prather Fletcher]], wrote to [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[William Jennings Bryan]]: "Since the naval rivalry began in 1910, financial conditions, which were none too good then, have grown worse; and as time approaches for the final payment, feeling has been growing in these countries that perhaps they are much more in need of money than of battleships."&lt;ref&gt;Fletcher to Bryan, No. 454, 16 February 1914, S.D.F., Chile, in Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The First World War effectively ended the dreadnought race, as all three countries suddenly found themselves unable to acquire additional warships.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, ''Warships for Export'', 133.&lt;/ref&gt; After the conflict, the race never resumed, but many plans for post-war naval expansions and improvements were postulated by the Argentine, Brazilian, and Chilean governments.

The Brazilians modernized ''Minas Geraes'', ''São Paulo'', and the two cruisers acquired under the 1904 plan, {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Bahia||2}} and {{ship|Brazilian cruiser|Rio Grande do Sul||2}}, between 1918 and 1926.&lt;ref name="English, Armed Forces, 110"&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 110.&lt;/ref&gt; This was sorely needed, as all four ships were not ready to fight a modern war. Although the Brazilian government intended to send ''São Paulo'' overseas for service in the [[Grand Fleet]], both it and ''Minas Geraes'' had not been modernized since entering service, meaning they were without essential equipment like modern [[fire-control system|fire control]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, "Brazil," 404; Robinson, "Brazilian Navy."&lt;/ref&gt; Maintenance on the two ships had also been neglected, which was most clearly illustrated when ''São Paulo'' was sent to New York for modernization: fourteen of its eighteen boilers broke down, and the ship required the assistance of the American battleship {{USS|Nebraska|BB-14|2}} and cruiser {{USS|Raleigh|C-8|2}} to continue the voyage.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 26, 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The two cruisers were in "deplorable" condition, as they were able to steam at a top speed of only {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} thanks to a desperate need for new [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]]s and boiler tubes. With repairs, though, both participated in the war as part of [[Brazilian cruiser Bahia#First World War|Brazil's main naval contribution to the conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, "Brazilian Navy"; "Bahia (3º)," ''Serviço de Documentação da Marinha&amp;nbsp;— Histórico de Navios''; "Rio Grande do Sul I," ''Serviço de Documentação da Marinha&amp;nbsp;— Histórico de Navios.''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brazilian Navy also made plans to acquire additional ships in the 1920s and 30s, but both were sharply reduced from the original proposals. In 1924, they contemplated constructing a relatively modest number of warships, including a heavy cruiser, five destroyers, and five submarines. In the same year, the newly arrived American naval mission, led by Rear Admiral [[Carl Theodore Vogelgesang]], tendered a naval expansion plan of 151,000&amp;nbsp;tons, divided between battleships (70,000), cruisers (60,000), destroyers (15,000), and submarines (6,000). The United States' State Department, led by Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and fresh from negotiating the [[Washington Naval Treaty]], was not keen on seeing another dreadnought race, so Hughes quickly moved to thwart the efforts of the mission. Only one Italian-built submarine, {{ship|Brazilian submarine|Humaytá||2}}, was acquired during this time.&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 110; Scheina, ''Naval History'', 135–36; Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1930s, the international community believed that the bulk of the Brazilian Navy was "obsolete" and were old enough to no longer be "considered effective".&lt;ref&gt;"Brazil Navy Composed of 28 Obsolete Ships," ''New York Times'', 7 October 1930, 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, ''Minas Geraes'' was modernized a second time at the [[Arsenal de Marinha do Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro Naval Yard]] from June 1931 to April 1938.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 27; Topliss, "Brazilian Dreadnoughts," 289.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Other sources give different dates for the modernization, such as 1931 to 1935,&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, "Brazil," 416.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1934 to 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, ''Battleships'', 320–21; Scheina, ''Naval History'', 153.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Plans to give similar treatment to ''São Paulo'' were dropped due to the ship's poor material condition.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 29; Breyer, ''Battleships'', 321; Scheina, "Brazil," 416.&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period, the Brazilian government looked into purchasing cruisers from the United States Navy but ran into the restrictions of the Washington and [[London Naval Treaty|London Naval Treaties]], which placed restrictions on the sale of used warships to foreign countries. The Brazilians eventually contracted for six destroyers from the United Kingdom.{{efn-ua|These were taken over after the beginning of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and became the [[G and H-class destroyer#Havant class 2|''Havant'' class]].&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 136–37.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the interim, a plan to lease six destroyers from the United States was abandoned after it was met with strong opposition from both international and American institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 136–37; Scheina, "Brazil," 416.&lt;/ref&gt; Three {{sclass-|Marcilio Dias|destroyer}}s, based on the American {{sclass-|Mahan|destroyer|4}}, were laid down in Brazil with six minelayers, all of which were launched between 1939 and 1941. Though both programs required foreign assistance and were consequently delayed by the war, all nine ships were completed by 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 327.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, nearly all of the major warships of the Argentine Navy were obsolete; aside from ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'', the newest major warship had been constructed at the end of the nineteenth century. The Argentine government recognized this, and as part of holding on to their naval superiority in the region, they sent ''Rivadavia'' and ''Moreno'' to the United States in 1924 and 1926 to be modernized. In addition, in 1926 the Argentine Congress allotted 75&amp;nbsp;million [[Argentine peso#Gold and silver pesos, 1881–1969|gold peso]]s for a naval building program.  This resulted in the acquisition of three cruisers (the Italian-built {{sclass-|Veinticinco de Mayo|cruiser|4}} and the British-built {{ship|ARA|La Argentina|C-3|2}}), twelve destroyers (the Spanish-built {{sclass-|Churruca|destroyer|4}} and the British-built {{sclass-|Mendoza|destroyer|5}}/{{sclass-|Buenos Aires|destroyer|5}} classes), and three submarines (the Italian-built {{sclass-|Santa Fe|submarine|4}}).&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 38–39; Scheina, "Argentina," 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chile began to seek additional ships to bolster its fleet in 1919, and the United Kingdom eagerly offered many of its surplus warships. This action worried nearby nations, who feared that a Chilean attempt to become the region's most powerful navy would destabilize the area and start another naval arms race.&lt;ref&gt;Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 48; Graser Schornstheimer, "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9B04E6DF173AE532A25751C2A96E9C946195D6CF Chile as a Naval Power]," ''New York Times'', 22 August 1920, X10.&lt;/ref&gt; Chile asked for ''Canada'' and ''Eagle'', the two battleships they ordered before the war, but the cost of converting the latter back to a battleship was too high.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, "Great Britain," 70; Brown, "HMS ''Eagle''," 251.&lt;/ref&gt; Planned replacements included the two remaining {{sclass-|Invincible|battlecruiser}}s, but a leak to the press of the secret negotiations to acquire them caused an uproar within Chile itself over the value of such ships.&lt;ref&gt;Somervell, "Naval Affairs," 393–94.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Chile only bought ''Canada'' and four destroyers in April 1920—all ships that had been ordered from British yards by the Chilean government before 1914 but were purchased by the Royal Navy after the British entered the First World War—for relatively low prices. ''Canada'', for instance, was sold for just £1,000,000, less than half of what had been required to construct the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 139; Livermore, "Battleship Diplomacy," 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next several years, the Chileans continued to acquire more ships from the British, like six destroyers (the {{sclass-|Serrano|destroyer|4}}) and three submarines (the {{sclass-|Capitan O'Brien|submarine (1928)|4}}).&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 148.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Almirante Latorre'' was modernized in the United Kingdom from 1929 to 1931 at the [[HMNB Devonport|Devonport Dockyard]].&lt;ref name="WhitleyBattleships"&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 33.&lt;/ref&gt; A recession and a [[Chilean naval mutiny of 1931|major naval revolt]] then led to the battleship's ''de facto'' inactivation in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 112–14; Sater, "The Abortive Kronstadt," 240–53.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, the Chilean government inquired into the possibility of constructing an {{convert|8600|LT|t|adj=on}} cruiser in the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, or Sweden, but this did not lead to an order. A second plan to acquire two small cruisers was dropped with the beginning of the Second World War.&lt;ref name="English149"&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the United States attempted to purchase ''Almirante Latorre'', two destroyers, and a [[submarine tender]], probably because the Chilean Navy had a reputation for keeping its ships in top-quality condition, but the offer was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Forces'', 149; Scheina, ''Naval History'', 164; Scheina, "Brazil," 416.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, the three major South American navies found themselves unable to acquire major warships; they were only able to do so again after the conflict, when the United States and United Kingdom had many unnecessary or surplus warships. The war had proved the obsolete status of battleships, so the South American navies were seeking cruisers, destroyers, and submarines, yet they ran into political difficulties in acquiring anything larger than {{sclass2-|Flower|corvette}}s and {{sclass2-|River|frigate}}s. They were only able to acquire them when the [[Red Scare]] began to strongly affect American and international politics. One of the deals reached under the [[Mutual Defense Assistance Act]] (1949) sold six American light cruisers to Argentina, Brazil, and Chile in January 1951.{{efn-ua|Most of the cruisers transferred were from the {{sclass-|Brooklyn|cruiser|4}}, but one of Brazil's cruisers ([[USS St. Louis (CL-49)|''Almirante Tamandaré'']]) was from the slightly improved {{sclass-|St. Louis|cruiser (1938)|4}}.}} While this bolstered the navies of important South American allies of the United States, which would be [[Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance|treaty-bound]] to assist the United States in any war, naval historian Robert Scheina argues that the American government also used the opportunity to significantly affect the traditional naval rivalry among the three countries. The warships sold unilaterally changed the naval outlook of all three nations, leading them to accept parity (as opposed to the Argentine pre-war stipulation that its fleet be equal to Brazil's and Chile's combined).&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, ''Naval History'', 172–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The venerable dreadnoughts of South America soldiered on for a short time after the war. The US Navy's ''[[All Hands]]'' magazine reported in a series of 1948 articles that all save ''São Paulo'' and ''Almirante Latorre'' were still in active service; the former had been decommissioned and the latter undergoing repairs.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, "Brazil: Small, Modern Ships," 16; Austin, "Largest South American Navy," 14; Austin, "The Fleets of Chile and Peru," 25.&lt;/ref&gt; With the influx of the modern cruisers, frigates, and corvettes, the battleships were quickly sold for [[ship breaking|scrap]]. The Brazilian Navy was the first to dispose of its dreadnoughts, the oldest in the world by that time. ''São Paulo'' was sold for scrap in 1951 but sank in a storm north of the [[Azores]] while under tow.&lt;ref&gt;"São Paulo I," ''Serviço de Documentação da Marinha&amp;nbsp;— Histórico de Navios''; "E São Paulo," ''Navios De Guerra Brasileiros''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Minas Geraes'' followed two years later and was broken up in [[Genoa]] beginning in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;"E Minas Geraes," ''Navios De Guerra Brasileiros''.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Argentine dreadnoughts, ''Moreno'' was towed to Japan for scrapping in 1957, and ''Rivadavia'' was broken up in Italy beginning in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley, ''Battleships'', 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Almirante Latorre'', inactive and unrepaired after a 1951 explosion in its engine room, was decommissioned in October 1958 and followed ''Moreno'' to Japan in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Brook, ''Warships for Export'', 148; Whitley, ''Battleships'', 33; "Acorazado Almirante Latorre," ''Unidades Navales''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2104">'''R-045/R-046 ''Starshel''''' ([[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]: Стършел, ''Hornet'') is a type of [[electronic countermeasures]] ammunition, fired by 122&amp;nbsp;mm or 152&amp;nbsp;mm [[artillery]] guns. It is designed to completely disrupt enemy [[radio]] communications on the battlefield.

== Design and deployment ==
The Starshel rounds were developed and deployed in the early 1980s and were operationally deployed in the mid-80s. By the mid-1990s the rounds were issued to every artillery unit in the [[Bulgarian army]] as special ammunition. A full jamming kit consists of several rounds, covering a jamming range of 20 to 100 [[MHz]] (with 5 rounds) for the R-045 and from 1.5 to 120&amp;nbsp;MHz (with 8 rounds) for the R-046. The fins of the round are deployed in-flight. After contact with the ground, an automatic fuze fires the 1,5 meter-long [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] up, which is powered by a small [[lithium battery]] for at least an hour. The effective jamming range is at least 700 m. Usually 1 or 2 Starshel kits are used to completely jam enemy front-line communications on a tactical scale.

== Specifications ==
* '''R-045 range''': 3,000 - 14,500 m
* '''R-046 range''': 4,000 - 16,500 m
* '''R-046 weight''': 34,56&amp;nbsp;kg
* '''Storage durability in rough conditions''': 3 years
* '''Storage durability in normal conditions''': 10 years

Ground vehicles using [[stealth technology]] have come to fruition at various times in history.

The [[Challenger 2]] features a redesigned hull and turret offering lower radar observability over its predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tanks: an illustrated history of their impact|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-996-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N481TmqiSiUC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;lpg=PA182&amp;dq=stealth+turret+%22challenger+II%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O8YA0LduUp&amp;sig=B5tqce44Utnib_DtVxbM_S7OHhA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=isZhTP76D4PLnAecs-2ODw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=stealth%20turret%20%22challenger%20II%22&amp;f=false|author=Spencer Tucker|accessdate=10 August 2010|page=182|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the joint U.S./British Future Scout Cavalry System concept was experimented with and appeared in prototype form before being canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future Scout and Cavalry System (FSCS) Tactical Reconnaissance Armoured Combat Equipment Requirement (TRACER) Armored Scout and Reconnaissance Vehicle (ASRV) |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/fscs.htm|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other vehicles, particularly [[unmanned ground vehicle]]s, may unintentionally have an undetectably low radar signature due to their small size. Various coatings and radar absorbing layers of material are available for combat vehicles.

The [[Armored Gun System]] program of the 1980s attempted to create a stealth vehicle. One of the competitors, the [[Stingray light tank]] later became Thailand's light tank.

The '''storm glass''' or '''chemical weather glass''' was an instrument which was proposed as a method for predicting weather. It consisted of a special liquid placed inside a sealed transparent glass. The state of crystallization within the liquid was believed to be related to the weather. The inventor is unknown but the device became popular in the 1860s after being promoted by Admiral [[Robert FitzRoy]] who claimed that {{quote|if fixed, undisturbed, in free air, not exposed to radiation, fire, or sun, but in the ordinary light of a well-ventilated room or outer air, the chemical mixture in a so-called storm-glass varies in character with the direction of the wind, not its force, specially (though it may so vary in appearance only) from another cause, electrical tension.}} The compositions of the liquid in a storm glass varied but usually contained "camphor, nitrate of potassium and sal-ammoniac, dissolved by alcohol, with water and some air." These devices are now known to have little value in weather prediction but continue to be a curiosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=An experimental examination of the so-called Storm-glass|author=Tomlinson, Charles |pages=93–109|url= https://archive.org/stream/s4philosophicalm26lond#page/93/mode/1up| journal=The Philosophical Magazine|volume=26| year=1863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The liquid within the glass is a mixture of several ingredients, most commonly [[distilled water]], [[ethanol]], [[potassium nitrate]], [[ammonium chloride]], and [[camphor]]. This specific mixture was promoted by Admiral [[Robert FitzRoy]] although similar devices existed even two decades earlier with variants in Italy, France and Germany.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/j.1477-8696.1992.tb05785.x|title=The Admiral's Storm Glass|journal=Weather|volume=47|issue=3|pages=89|year=1992|last1=Bolton|first1=H.C.|last2=Rae|first2=I.D.|bibcode=1992Wthr...47...89B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/j.1477-8696.1967.tb02956.x|title=A Further Note on the Storm-Glass|journal=Weather|volume=22|issue=10|pages=412|year=1967|last1=Sealey|first1=Antony F.|bibcode=1967Wthr...22..412S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1179/174582306X93200|title=Will the True Originator of the Storm Glass Please Own Up|journal=Ambix|volume=53|pages=67|year=2013|last1=McConnell|first1=Anita|last2=Collins|first2=Philip}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prognosticator.jpg|thumb|1825 advertisement for a storm glass]]
FitzRoy carefully documented how the storm glass would predict the weather:&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/j.1477-8696.1965.tb02202.x|title=Admiral Fitzroy and the Storm Glass|journal=Weather|volume=20|issue=9|pages=270|year=1965|last1=Sutton|first1=Graham|bibcode=1965Wthr...20..270S}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the liquid in the glass is clear, the weather will be bright and clear.
*If the liquid is cloudy, the weather will be cloudy as well, perhaps with [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]].
*If there are small dots in the liquid, [[humidity|humid]] or [[fog]]gy weather can be expected.
*A cloudy glass with small stars indicates [[thunderstorm]]s.
*If the liquid contains small stars on sunny winter days, then [[snow]] is coming.
*If there are large flakes throughout the liquid, it will be overcast in temperate seasons or snowy in the winter.
*If there are crystals at the bottom, this indicates [[frost]].
*If there are threads near the top, it will be windy.

The device was apparently available in the 18th century and the inventor is unknown. In 1859, violent storms struck the British Isles. In response, the [[British Crown]] distributed storm glasses, then known as "FitzRoy's storm barometers," to many small fishing communities around the British Isles that were to be consulted by ships at port before setting sail.

An article in the ''Journal of Crystal Growth'' concluded that temperature change is the sole cause of crystal growth in storm glasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Pattern formation of crystals in storm glass | first1 = Yasuko | last1 = Tanaka | first2 = Koichi | last2 = Hagano | first3 = Tomoyasu | last3 = Kuno | first4 = Kazushige | last4 = Nagashima | journal = [[Journal of Crystal Growth]] | volume = 310 | issue = 10 | date = 1 May 2008 | origyear = 1 February 2008 | pages = 2668–2672 | doi = 10.1016/j.jcrysgro.2008.01.037 |bibcode = 2008JCrGr.310.2668T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''trivet''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɪ|v|ᵻ|t}} is an object placed between a serving dish or [[bowl (vessel)|bowl]], and a dining [[table (furniture)|table]], usually to protect the table from [[heat]] damage.

Trivet also refers to a [[tripod]] used to elevate pots from the coals of an open fire (the word ''trivet'' itself ultimately comes from Latin ''tripes'' meaning "tripod").  [[Metal]] trivets are often tripod-like structures with three legs to support the trivet horizontally in order to hold the dish or pot above the table surface.  These are often included with modern non-electric [[pressure cookers]].  A trivet may often contain a receptacle for a candle that can be lit to keep food warm. 

A three-legged design is optimal because it eliminates wobbling on uneven surfaces.

Modern trivets are made from [[metal]], [[wood]], [[ceramic]], fabric, [[silicone]] or [[Cork (material)|cork]]. 

When roasting any meat in an oven, trivet racks  - which typically fit into roasting pans - are often used to enable the meat joint to be held above the direct heat of the roasting pan and allow the juices of the joint to drip into the roasting pan for the subsequent making of gravy. A trivet can also be made of freshly cut carrot, celery and onion. This not only raises the meat, i.e. chicken, it has the further advantage of providing a gravy-friendly liquid when the vegetables and juices are sieved at the end of cooking.

A trivet is also a synonym of [[Drink coaster|coaster]] in [[Indian English]] and [[British English]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.etsy.com/market/wooden_trivet&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Virtuozzo partnered with Packet.net to distribute Virtuozzo software through Packet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.thg.ru/technews/20170418_152411.html| title= Virtuozzo и Packet анонсировали облачный сервис гиперконвергентной инфраструктуры| publisher=Tom’s Hardware}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
[[Virtuozzo]] is an operating system-level server virtualization solution designed to centralize server management and consolidate workloads by reducing the number of physical servers required.  Organizations use Virtuozzo for server consolidation, disaster recovery, and server workload agility.  Virtuozzo does not generate a virtual machine on a host OS like traditional VM software, but instead, it creates isolated virtual private servers (VPSs) on a single physical server.  For instance, the software can run multiple Linux VPSs, but not Linux and Windows at the same time on the same server. Each VPS performs exactly like a stand-alone server and can be rebooted independently.&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite journal| journal=InfoWorld| date=April 24, 2008| title=Virtuozzo Plays Well With Others| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=xzYEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54&amp;dq=%22Virtuozzo%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTu875zcTTAhVI0oMKHT_jDBAQ6AEINjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Virtuozzo%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtuozzo for Linux became available in 2001 while a version that supports 32- and 64-bit microprocessors became available in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5883119.html Virtualized-OS company makes 64-bit change | Tech News on ZDNet&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=info/&gt; In 2002, Virtuozzo proved that the 2.5 version of its software could run 2,500 instances of Red Hat Linux on an eight-processor Dell server. As a result, Intel partnered with Virtuozzo in 2002 to develop a partitioning technology for IA-64 processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal=Computerworld| date=September 30, 2002| title=Intel Taps Linux Developer for IA-63| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=EtwRJJ9BI90C&amp;pg=PT7&amp;dq=%22Virtuozzo%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiKqY3m0sTTAhVG5YMKHcfKDTA4HhDoAQghMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Virtuozzo%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linux architectures that support Virtuozzo for Linux are x86, ia64, AMD64, EM64T, and Itanium. Virtuozzo for Linux enables multiple Linux distributions to exist simultaneously on one server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtual-strategy.com/article/view/752/ A Q&amp;A with SWsoft about Virtuozzo - Virtual Strategy Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on [[OpenVZ]], a Linux-based OS-level virtualization technology, which allows a physical server to run multiple isolated operating system instances. In 2005, the company updated Virtuozzo to support 64-bit x86 processors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120715224130/http://news.com.com/Virtualized-OS+company+makes+64-bit+change/2100-1012_3-5883119.html Virtualized-OS company makes 64-bit change | CNET News.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Virtuozzo requires at least a Pentium III server with at least 1 GB of memory and 4 GB available hard drive.  Virtuozzo’s management tools will be compatible with Microsoft’s Viridian and Virtual Server software. Virtuozzo's container staging is processed through the company's container platform OpenVZ.&lt;ref name=data/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.infoworld.com/article/3099981/virtualization/openvz-70-runs-linux-vms-like-containers.html| title=OpenVZ 7.0 runs Linux VMs like containers| author=Serdar Yrgulalp| date=July 26, 2016| publisher=InfoWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virtuozzo 7, which incorporated an optimized Kernel-based Virtual Machine, was released in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.geekwire.com/2016/virtuozzo-7/| title=Virtuozzo’s new Kernel-based Virtual Machine for ISPs is a ‘huge thing,’ years in the making| author=Dan Richman| date=July 25, 2016| publisher=Geek Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the company released Virtuozzo Storage, a targeted container storage. The second version of Virtuozzo Storage was released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/news/450416837/Persistent-container-storage-vendors-take-center-stage| title=DevOps doesn't need stateful containers with storage, but apps dp| author=Garry Kranz| date=April 13, 2017| publisher=Tech Target}}&lt;/ref&gt;
