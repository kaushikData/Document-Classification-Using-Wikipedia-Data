'''Akram Najaf oglu Naibov''' ({{lang-az|Əkrəm Nəcəf oğlu Naibov}}, born December 6, 1937), better known by his [[pen name]] '''Akram Aylisli''',  is an [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] writer, playwright, novelist and former member of parliament.&lt;ref name="IIIç"&gt;{{az icon}} "[http://www.meclis.gov.az/?/az/content/85 Üçüncü çağırış Azərbaycan Respublikası Milli Məclisinin deputatları haqqında seçildikləri tarixə olan qısa MƏLUMATLAR]."

In 2013, after the publication of Aylisli's ''Stone Dreams'' novella, which depicted the pogroms carried out by Azerbaijanis against the Armenians in [[Sumgait pogrom|Sumgait]] and [[Baku pogrom|Baku]]&lt;ref name="Enson Haber"/&gt; and presented Armenians in sympathetic light, President Aliyev signed a [[presidential decree]] that stripped Aylisli of the title of "People's Writer" and the presidential pension.&lt;ref name="Trend.az"&gt;"[http://en.trend.az/news/politics/2116873.html Azerbaijani President signs orders to deprive Akram Aylisli of presidential pension and honorary title]."

==Biography==
Aylisli was born in the village of [[Yuxarı Əylis|Aylis]] in 1937 in the [[Ordubad]] region of the [[Nakhichivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]], part of Soviet Azerbaijan, near the borders of Armenia and Iran.&lt;ref name="Türk Edebiyatı"/&gt; His mother, Leya Ali Kyzy, was the village storyteller, his father died at WWII when Akram was five. His youth in the Soviet Union coincided with one of its more liberal periods: the years of de-Stalinization and the ‘Thaw’ under the flamboyant leadership of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. Aylisli received his graduate education at the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]] in Moscow, the elite school of creative writing for Soviet writers.

His first work, a poem entitled "Qeşem ve onun Kürekeni", was published in the journal ''Azerbaycan''. During Soviet times Aylisli was a poet, translator, and playwright, and he authored a number of novels: "Trees without Shade", "Shining of the six suns", "The season of colorful dresses", "The white canyon", "The dam", "Peoples and Trees" and others. Most of Aylisli’s works are associated with this native village. Aylisli’s stories and novels, so subtle and full of affection for peasant life, are very popular in Azerbaijan and Soviet Union. His novel "Peoples and Trees" have been translated into more than thirty languages and published beyond Soviet borders in the countries of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Türk Edebiyatı"/&gt; Сonceptually and personally Aylisli was close to the Russian "[[Village Prose]]" movement.

Aylisli was also the author of a number of dramas and plays, including "Quşu Uçan Budaqlar", "Menim Neğmekar Bibim", "Bağdada Putyovka Var", and "Vezife", which were staged and shown in theaters in [[Baku]], Nakhchivan, [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], and [[Yerevan]].&lt;ref name="Türk Edebiyatı"/&gt; Moreover, Aylisli worked as a translator. He translated into Azeri the books by [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]], [[Heinrich Böll]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Konstantin Paustovsky]], [[Vladimir Korolenko]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Vasily Shukshin]], [[Chinghiz Aitmatov]], [[Salman Rushdie]].

From 1968–70, he became the editor-in-chief of "Gençlik", and later worked as a satirist for the journal ''Mozalan''. From 1974–78, he served on the [[Azerbaijan SSR]]'s State Committee for Cinematography.

Aylisli was awarded the title of “People’s Writer” as well as the highest state awards of Azerbaijan – the medals of “Shokhrat” (“Honor”) and “Istiglal” (“Independence”). In November 2005, he was elected to the [[National Assembly (Azerbaijan)|National Assembly of Azerbaijan (Milli Majlis)]] as a member of parliament representing his constituency in [[Julfa, Azerbaijan (city)|Julfa]]-[[Ordubad]]. He served for one term, which ended on November 7, 2010.&lt;ref name="IIIç"/&gt;

Aylisli generally is supportive of left wing views. His works published in the Soviet Union did not conform to [[socialist realism]], than some other writers of the [[Azerbaijan SSR]] at that time, and he spoke negatively about the Soviet era for a while in 1990s. In one of his recent interviews broadcast on television channel [[ANS TV]] he stated that he believes that [[Karl Marx]] was a genius, and the world will come to his ideas sooner or later.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bizimyolinfo.com/?sehife=1&amp;xeber=480 Intellectuals by Mammad Suleymanov]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Stone Dreams'' controversy==
In late 2012 and early 2013, Aylisli found himself embroiled in controversy when his novella, ''Daş yuxular'' (''Stone Dreams''), was published in a Russian-language journal called ''Druzhba Narodov'' (Friendship of the Peoples). It covers the pogroms of Armenians in Baku in 1989 and the massacre of Armenians in his native village by Turkish troops in 1919. The scenes of the recent past and the tales of old people about the Armenian massacre intertwined in the novel. The book was written in 2006 but the author did not dare to publish it. The decision to do so only came following the extradition of [[Ramil Safarov]] to Azerbaijan. Safarov – an Azerbaijani army lieutenant – had hacked to death an Armenian army officer in [[Hungary]], and was subsequently welcomed home as a hero of the nation.

=== Plot ===
The novel tells the story of the Azerbaijani actor Saday Sadykhly and his efforts to protect his [[Armenians|Armenian]] neighbors during the [[Sumgait Pogrom|Sumgait]] and [[Baku Pogrom]]s in the closing years of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Enson Haber"&gt;{{tr icon}} "[http://www.ensonhaber.com/azeri-yazarin-ezber-bozan-ermeni-cikisi-2013-02-04.html Azeri yazarın ezber bozan Ermeni çıkışı]." ''Enson Haber''. February 4, 2013. Retrieved February 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel begins as the severely beaten Sadykhly is being transported to the hospital: while trying to protect his Armenian neighbor he was also assaulted by the [[yeraz]] [Azeri refugees from Armenia] on the streets of Baku, who mistook him too for an Armenian. Basically there are four main characters in the novel. Sadai Sadykhly, his friend Nunavrish Karabahly, also an actor, Sadykhly's father in law Professor of psychiatry, Dr. Abbasaliev and a surgeon in the hospital where Sadykhly was taken right after assault Dr. Farid Farzaneh. Although it looks like that Sadykhly was recovering at the beginning, by the end his body couldn't sustain the physical injuries or the nervous pressure, and so he died.

=== Critics ===

{{rquote|right|If a single candle were lighted for every murdered Armenian, the light from these candles would be brighter than that of the moon|''The Stone Dreams''&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/19/world/la-fg-azerbaijan-author-20130220|accessdate=2013-03-09 Azerbaijani novelist vilified for his call for reconciliation]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many in Azerbaijan took offense to Aylisli's sympathetic portrayal of Armenians, with whom they fought and lost a [[Nagorno-Karabakh War|six-year-long conflict]] over control of the region of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] in the early 1990s. The novella stirred resentment by depicting only the Azerbaijani brutality against Armenians during the conflict, while never mentioning incidents of alleged Armenian violence against Azerbaijanis such as the [[Khojaly massacre]].&lt;ref name=RFERL&gt;{{cite web|last=Sindelar|first=Daisy|title=In Azerbaijan, Anger at an Author, But Not Necessarily at His Argument|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/azerbaijan-author-akram-aylisli/24897008.html|publisher=''[[RFE/RL]]''|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some other controversial aspects to the novel. Shortly after the pogroms in Sumgait at the beginning of March 1988 Sadyghly wants “to go to [[Echmiadzin]] in order to convert to Christianity with the blessing of the [[Catholicos of All Armenians|Armenian Catholicos]], stay [there] forever as a monk begging God to forgive Muslims for all the evils which they committed against Armenians”. This element to the novel is likely to be deeply frustrating for many Azerbaijani readers, considering the ambiguous role played by the Armenian Catholicos in the events of the late 1980s. [[Vazgen I]] did not act to protect the Azerbaijani population of Armenia or to prevent their expulsion, becoming an unpopular figure in Azerbaijan and his name a derogatory one. Another sensitive taboo seemingly questioned by Aylisli is the significance of circumcision—a ritual sacred to every practicing Muslim. Dr. Farzani, who is married to a Russian woman, wants to have their son circumcised. But his wife asks Farzani whether the [[Muhammad|Prophet]] is wiser than God. Ultimately, their son comes to see circumcision as an act of violence on his body, and this reaction eventually breaks Farzani’s family apart. Such a controversial portrayal of a concept as sacred as circumcision is likely to prove very irritating for some Azerbaijani readers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caucasus-survey.org/vol2/mamedov-stone-dreams-scandal.php The Stone Dreams scandal: the Nagorny Karabakh conflict and Armenian-Azerbaijani relations in contemporary literature] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129111054/http://www.caucasus-survey.org/vol2/mamedov-stone-dreams-scandal.php |date=January 29, 2015 }}. http://www.caucasus-survey.org/.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harassment campaign ===
Soon after ''Stone Dreams'' was published, the honored writer became an enemy of the state. Mass media launched a wide-scale bullying campaign.

In Baku, Ganja, and in the writer’s native village, rallies were organized where people cried out slogans such as “Death to Akram Aylisli!”, “Traitor!”, "Why have you sold yourself out to the Armenians?" ,“Akram is Armenian!”, and they set his books and portraits on fire.&lt;ref&gt;Sultanova, Aida and Peter Leonard.

''APA''. February 6, 2013. Retrieved February 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 7, 2013, the [[President of Azerbaijan]] [[Ilham Aliyev]] signed a [[presidential decree]] that stripped Aylisli of his title "People's Writer" and the personal pension that went with it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ru.president.az/articles/7230 Распоряжение Президента Азербайджанской Республики о лишении Акрама Айлисли (Акрама Наджаф оглу Наибова) персональной пенсии Президента Азербайджанской Республики]. Официальный сайт Президента Азербайджанской Республики&lt;/ref&gt;

Ali Hasanov, Head of the Azerbaijani Presidential Administration's Social and Political Department, denounced him for purportedly having no national spirit or sense of humanity, for disrespecting the memory of those who died during the war, and for posing as a defender of human values. He added that Aylisli represents Armenian youth who killed thousands of Azerbaijanis, and took control over Azerbaijani lands and committed the massacre in Khojaly, but that he represents Azerbaijanis as murderers and weak personalities. He further added that as Azerbaijanis they "must express public hatred towards these people."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://en.trend.az/news/politics/2116003.html Top Official: Writer Akram Aylisli disrespects memory of thousands of martyrs]."

Parliamentarians of the [[National Assembly (Azerbaijan)|National Assembly]] during the special session required to deprive Aylisli of all state awards, and his Azerbaijani citizenship and insisted that he move to [[Armenia]]. Parliamentarians commented that the novella "insulted not only Azerbaijanis, but the whole Turkish nation," on account of references to the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s historical persecution of Armenians. They suggested that Aylisli have [[DNA]] tested to determine if he was genetically ethnic Armenian.

=== Author's reaction ===
Responding to the critics accusing him of being partial, the writer has said: “If I had any doubt that I had disgraced my people that would break me. But they think that when I say two good words about some Armenian I must say three good ones about an Azerbaijani. But it’s not my business to keep that foolish balance! In my story I depict a character and his perception of reality. His mind is very fragile; he’s on the brink of insanity.”&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.rusrep.ru/article/2014/12/08/aylisli/ “It is like being pregnant all your life..."]." 12.11.2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Aylisli defended himself in an interview, commenting that "Armenians are not enemies for me....How can they be? I am a writer living in the 21st century. A solution to Nagorno-Karabakh is being delayed, and hostility is growing between the two nations. I want to contribute to a peaceful solution."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; 
In answer to accusation  of betrayal Aylisli claimed that he is not a patriot: Where have you seen a writer as a patriot? He must write, everything his mind and reason tell him to ".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://haqqin.az/news/12799 Акрам Айлисли: Я не патриот Азербайджана (Обновлено)]."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support ===
On February 3 the group of young independent intellectuals organized the small demonstration near the monument of [[Mirza Alakbar Sabir]] to support Akram Aylisli. The number of Azerbaijani writers and intellectuals, including famous writer and screenwriter [[Rustam Ibragimbekov]], also spoke out in defence of Aylisli.
[[Leyla Yunus]], the leading Azerbaijani human right activist, claimed that "Only Aylisli defends the honor and the dignity of our nation after the story of Ramil Safarov".&lt;ref&gt;[http://haqqin.az/news/3732 Лейла Юнус: «Акрам Айлисли рассказал правду»] // haqqin.az. 9.2.2013&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ragıp Zarakolu]], the leading Turkish human right activist and publisher who is well known for long faced legal harassment for publishing books about the [[Armenian Genocide]], also supported Aylisli.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agos.com.tr/tr/yazi/4257/ragip-zarakolu-ekrem-eylisli-ile-dayanisma-icin-toplanti-duzenliyor Ragıp Zarakolu, Ekrem Eylisli ile dayanışma için toplantı düzenliyor] // agos.com.tr 12.02.2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]], [[Helsinki Citizens’ Assembly]] and Institute for the Protection of Media Rights struсk a blow for Aylisli. Human Rights Watch (HRW) voiced its concern for Aylisli's physical safety and called for Azerbaijan's "government to end [the] hostile campaign of intimidation." "The government of Azerbaijan is making a mockery of its international obligations on freedom of expression," remarked HRW's Europe and Central Asia director Hugh Williamson.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/02/12/azerbaijan-stop-harassing-writer Azerbaijan: Stop Harassing Writer]." [[Human Rights Watch]]. February 12, 2013. Accessed February 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The chairman of Armenia's Union of Writers, [[Levon Ananyan]], offered a formal response to the controversy on February 8, saying, "Kudos to our Azerbaijani colleague! He is that brave man who blazes the trail, the trail that leads to repentance through truth." Ananyan added that "Not only Armenians, but also Russians, all people that are concerned about the future of the country...should share this braveness."&lt;ref name=RFERL/&gt;

The Russian [[PEN International|PEN]] center and a number of Russian famous writers as [[Boris Akunin]], [[Andrei Bitov]], [[Viktor Erofeev]], [[Sergey Kaledin]], [[Lev Anninsky]] also declared their support to Ayilisli.&lt;ref name="bbc-pen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/rolling_news/2013/02/130212_rn_pencenter_azeri_writer.shtml |title=Русский ПЕН-центр против преследований писателя Айлисли |date=2013-02-12 |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2013-02-12 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ESvu5O0X?url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/russian/rolling_news/2013/02/130212_rn_pencenter_azeri_writer.shtml |archivedate=February 16, 2013 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2014 a formal request was made by various public figures throughout the world to nominate Aylisli for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] - "For courage shown in his efforts to reconcile Azerbaijani and Armenian people". Among the nominators were the social science professors and the university presidents as [[Craig Calhoun]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[Theodor Shanin]]. They noted that Akram Aylisli was probably the first Turkic author who wrote a book of penitence for the [[Armenian Genocide]]. "Aylisli was the first to express that pain in a literary work which is very personal, deep and hard-won. &lt;...&gt; Mr Aylisli’s actions are important not only for Armenians and Azerbaijanis, but for others all across the former Soviet Union, who have been blinded by ethnic hatred. His example in fact transcends location, ethnicity or political persuasion. His lone resistance, his defiance, his willingness to sacrifice all for the sake of truth, is an encouragement to each of us to be brave. &lt;...&gt; Mr Aylisli is one of those rare people such as Martin Luther King and Andrey Sakharov, whose personal courage and moral impulse can change a nation’s fate and destroy the walls dividing nations."&lt;ref name="en.apa.az"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://1news.az/society/20140311045845150.html Акрама Айлисли предлагают в качестве кандидата на Нобелевскую премию мира]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://akramaylisli.info/english/nomination/ Akram Aylisli - for courage shown in his efforts to reconcile Azerbaijani and Armenian people]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://armenpress.am/eng/news/753795 Sergey Abashin explains reason for Aylisli’s candidacy in Nobel Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--{{Mergefrom|Araz Ali Matubbar|date=February 2008}}--&gt;
'''Aroj Ali Matubbar''' ({{lang-bn|আরজ আলী মাতুব্বর}}; 17 December 1900{{snd}}15 March 1985) was a self-taught [[philosopher]] and [[rationalist]] from [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Roy|first1=Pradip Kumar|title=Matubbar, Aroj Ali|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Matubbar,_Aroj_Ali|website=Banglapedia|publisher=Bangladesh Asiatic Society|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
He was born in the village of [[Charbaria Lamchari]], about {{convert|11|km}} from [[Barisal]] town in [[British India]], currently in Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His original name was Aroj Ali, and he only acquired the name 'Matubbar' (meaning 'local landlord') later. He was born to a poor farming family. He studied for only a few months at the village [[maqtab]], however this brief dabble in institutional education centered only on the [[Quran]] and other [[Islamic|Islam]] studies.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} He gathered most of his knowledge on varied subjects, including science and philosophy, through his own readings and research.

Matubbar lost his father at an early age. When he was 12 years old, his inherited property of {{convert|2|acre|m2}} of land was auctioned off because, as a minor, he was unable to pay land tax. The landless boy faced an even more critical crisis when a local usurer called him out of his ancestral homestead. Destitute, Matubbar grew up somehow on the charity of others and by working as a farm laborer. Due to his poverty, he could not attend school and had to rely on the free [[maqtab]] religious education provided by a local mosque. However he did not accept the rigid methods of learning there, and left it. A kindhearted man helped him finish the Bengali Primers. Persevering as he was, he kept on reading more and more. To satisfy his thirst for knowledge he studied all the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] books in [[Barisal Public Library]] like a serious student. Philosophy as a subject interested him most, but there were not enough books in the collection there. A teacher of philosophy at the [[B M College]], Kazi Ghulam Quadir, was impressed by his depth of knowledge and understanding, so he helped him borrow books from the college library. This was how his mind was shaped.

==Philosophy==
Matubbar developed a very [[progressivism|progressive]] approach and wrote against ignorance, superstition, and religious fundamentalism. He came to be considered an iconoclast for writing against established religious ideologies. For example, he questioned Islamic law of inheritance, as he failed to reconcile the suggested mode of sharing of inherited property.

Aroj Ali wrote several books, in spite of his lack of formal schooling. His writings reflect his controversial philosophy about life and the world. He also befriended a number of communist politicians and academics of Barisal town, including Professor Kazi Golam Kadir and Professor Muhammad Shamsul Haque. His books were always in danger of being banned by the government, since they contained certain claims that disagreed with the religious beliefs of the majority. Matubbar was arrested and taken into police custody for his book, ''Sotyer Shondhaney'' (The Quest for Truth).&lt;ref name="The Quest for Truth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avijit.humanists.net/aroj_ali/quest_for_truth_1.html |title=The Quest for Truth |work=avijit.humanists.net |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723144846/http://avijit.humanists.net/aroj_ali/quest_for_truth_1.html |archivedate=23 July 2010 }}{{self-published source|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was, in fact, subjected to harassment and threats throughout his life, due to his writings, as many of them challenged religious statements and claims.&lt;ref name="The Quest for Truth" /&gt;

==Career==
Due to financial constraints, Matubbar could not pursue any academic course or attain a formal institutional degree. He lived mostly on subsistence farming. He learned surveying techniques and began his life as a private land surveyor in his locality. This enabled him to accumulate some capital and he could own some land to start farming.

==Death==
He died on 15 March 1985 (1st [[Chaitra]] of the [[Bengali year]] 1392 ) in [[Barisal]], Bangladesh. He donated his eyes for transplantation after his death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He donated his body which was received by the Anatomy Department of [[Sher-e-Bangla Medical College]] and used for dissection by the medical students. After his death in 1985, Aroj Ali Matubbar came to be regarded as one of the most prolific thinkers that rural Bangladesh ever produced, and an iconoclast who was not afraid of speaking out against entrenched beliefs and superstitions.&lt;ref name="The Quest for Truth"/&gt;

==Writings and publications==
Matubbar had to take a lot of trouble in order to publish his books. He himself drew the cover of his first book, which was written in 1952 and published twenty one years later in 1973, under the title ''Satyer Sandhane''. This book gained him a reputation in the locality as a "learned man". In the preface he wrote:

“I was thinking of many things, my mind was full of questions, but haphazardly. I then started jotting down questions, not for writing a book, but only to remember these questions later. Those questions were driving my mind towards an endless ocean and I was gradually drifting away from the fold of religion.”

He made six propositions in this book, which reflected the nature of his philosophical questions. These are:

Proposition 1 : dealt with the soul, containing 8 questions&lt;br&gt;
Proposition 2 : dealt with God, containing as many as 11 questions&lt;br&gt;
Proposition 3 : dealt with the after-world, containing as many as 7 questions&lt;br&gt;
Proposition 4 : dealt with religious matters, containing as many as 22 questions&lt;br&gt;
Proposition 5 : dealt with Nature, containing as many as 10 questions&lt;br&gt;
Proposition 6 : dealt with remaining matters, containing as many as 9 questions

The eight questions he posed in the first proposition exemplify his approach. These are (a) Who am I (self)?, (b) Is Life incorporeal or corporal ? (c) Is mind and his/soul one, and the same? (d) What is the relationship of life with the body and the mind? (e) Can we recognize or identify life? (f) Am I free? (g) Will the soul without body continue to have "knowledge" even after it leaves the body at death? and finally (h) How does life can come into and go out of the body?

==Books==
He was an unusual type of writer. Because of his rural background, it was not possible on his part to remove the darkness covering his society, but with the dim torch he held, he tried to see the truth, wherever he could, without fear or doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mukto-mona.com/Special_Event_/5_yrs_anniv/sirajul_islam_chy/aroj1.htm |title=5 years of Mukto-Mona |website=Mukto Mona |language=bn}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Bangladesh, his writings were censored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kabir |first=Md Anwarul |date=26 November 2004 |title=Letters to Editor: Freedom of speech |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2004/11/26/d41126110379.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following are his writings:
* ''Shotter Shondhaney'' (The Quest for Truth) (1973)
* ''Sristir Rahasya'' (The Mystery of Creation) (1977)
* ''Anuman'' (Estimation) (1983)
* ''Muktaman'' (Free Mind) (1988)

Several of his unpublished manuscripts were later published posthumously under the title of ''Aroj Ali Matubbar Rachanabali''. Some of his writings have been translated into English and compiled in a volume published by [[Pathak Samabesh]].

==Recognition and awards==
Matubbar was little known to the elite educated society of the country during his lifetime. His first book, published in 1973, was rich with secular thought but caught little attention. It is only in the final years of life that he came to be known to the enlightened society of the country. His writings were collected and published. People in general started to take an interest in his books, which, although reflecting an untrained mind, posed a number of intriguing questions. He soon rose to eminence, albeit after his death in 1985.

An '''arrest''' is the act of apprehending a person and taking them into custody, usually because they have been suspected of committing or planning a [[crime]]. After the person is taken into custody, they can be [[Interrogation|questioned further]] and/or [[Criminal charge|charged]]. An arrest is a procedure in a [[Criminal justice|criminal justice system]].

[[Police]] and various other officers have [[powers of arrest]]. In some places, a [[citizen's arrest]] is permitted; for example in [[England and Wales]], any person can arrest "anyone whom he has reasonable grounds for suspecting to be committing, have committed or be guilty of committing an [[indictable offence]]," although certain conditions must be met before taking such action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120805174930/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Police+and+Criminal+Evidence+Act+1984&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=1871554&amp;ActiveTextDocId=3416535&amp;filesize=4138 section 24a, Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]&lt;/ref&gt;. Similar powers exist in France, Italy, Germany, Austria and Switzerland if a person is caught in an act of crime and not willing or able to produce valid ID.

As a safeguard against the abuse of power, many countries require that an arrest must be made for a thoroughly justified reason, such as the requirement of [[probable cause]] in the United States. Furthermore, the time that a person can be detained in custody is relatively short (in most cases 24 hours in the United Kingdom and France and 24 or 48 hours in the United States) before the detained person must be either charged or released.

==Etymology==
[[File:Lucy.Parsons.1915.arrest.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Lucy Parsons]] after her arrest for [[riot]]ing during an [[unemployment]] protest at [[Hull House]] in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]], 1915]]
The word "arrest" is  [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] in origin, derived from the French word ''arrêt'' meaning 'to stop or stay' and signifies a restraint of a person. Lexicologically, the meaning of the word arrest is given in various dictionaries depending upon the circumstances in which the word is used. There are numerous slang terms for being arrested throughout the world. In [[British slang]] terminology, the term "nicked" is often synonymous with being arrested, and "nick" can also refer to a [[police station]], and the term "pinched" is also common.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Eric and Paul Beale''A dictionary of slang and unconventional English'', p. 790, 886.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United States]] and [[France]] the term "collared" is sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;Hérail, René James and Edwin A. Lovatt, ''Dictionary of Modern Colloquial French'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "lifted" or "picked up" are also heard on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Partridge, Eric and Paul Beale''A dictionary of slang and unconventional English'', p. 681.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedure==
===India===
According to Indian law, no formality is needed during the procedure of arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Kanoon -Shri D.K. Basu, Ashok K. Johri vs State Of West Bengal,State Of U.P|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/501198/|publisher=IndianKanoon.org|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest can be made by a citizen, a police officer or a Magistrate. The police officer needs to inform the person being arrested the full particulars of the person's offence and that they are entitled to be released on bail if the offence fits the criteria for being bailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://delhicourts.nic.in/CrPC.htm|title=CODE OF CRIMINAL PROCEDURE|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no general rule of eligibility or requirement that a police officer must handcuff a person who is being arrested. When there is a question regarding handcuffing a person then at that time case laws has stated that the choice to handcuff a person is dependent on the surrounding circumstances, and that officers should always take the proper precautions to ensure the safety of themselves, and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://intolegalworld.com/2017/09/27/handcuffing-is-it-really-easy-as-it-seems-to-be/|title=HANDCUFFING: IS IT REALLY EASY AS IT SEEMS TO BE - Into Legal World|work=Into Legal World|access-date=2017-12-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
====Minor crimes and infractions====
[[File:LAPD Gang Investigation Arrest.jpg|thumb|right|Los Angeles police officers arresting a suspected gang]]
[[File:Man being arrested.jpg|thumb|right|Chicago police officers taking a man into custody.]]
When there exists [[probable cause]] to believe that a person has committed a minor crime, such as petty theft, driving on a suspended license, or disturbing the peace, law enforcement agents typically issue the individual a citation but do not otherwise detain them.  The person must then appear in court on the date provided on the citation. Prior to the court date, the prosecution will decide whether to file formal criminal charges against the individual. When the accused appears in court, they will be advised if formal criminal charges have been filed. If charges are filed, they will be asked to plead guilty or not guilty at the initial court hearing, which is referred to as the [[arraignment]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/publiced/practical/books/family/chapter_14.authcheckdam.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Arrests for serious crimes====
When a person is arrested for a serious crime, the defendant will have their picture taken and be held in [[Remand (detention)|pre-trial prison]]. Under certain circumstances (that is where the public won't be endangered by one's release from custody), the [[defendant]] may be entitled to release on [[bail]]. If the accused cannot post a monetary bail, they will appear at their arraignment where the judge will determine if the bail set by the schedule should be lowered.

Also, in certain states, the prosecution has 48 hours to decide whether or not to file formal charges against the accused. For example, in California, if no formal charges are filed within the 48-hour period, the accused must be released from the arresting host's custody. If formal charges are filed, the accused will be asked to appear at their arraignment. At the arraignment, the accused will be asked to plead guilty or not guilty, and the judge will set a bail amount (or refuse to set bail) for the accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=813-829|title=CA Codes (pen:813-829)|publisher=|accessdate=21 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512180414/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=813-829|archive-date=12 May 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the FBI estimated that law enforcement agencies made 13,120,947 arrests (excluding traffic violations). Of those persons arrested, 74.5% were male and 69.4 percent of all persons arrested were white, 28.0 percent were black, and the remaining 2.6 percent were of other ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/persons-arrested|title=FBI — Arrests|work=FBI|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers of arrest==

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
Arrests under English law fall into two general categories—with and without a warrant—and then into more specific subcategories. Regardless of what power a person is arrested under, they must be informed&lt;ref name="PACE 1984 S28"&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1871591 section 28, Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220223357/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1871591 |date=20 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that they are under arrest and of the grounds for their arrest at the time or as soon after the arrest as is practicable, otherwise the arrest is unlawful.&lt;ref name="PACE 1984 S28"/&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
{{empty-section|date=October 2015}}

====Scotland====

=====Arrest with a warrant=====
A justice of the peace can issue [[Arrest warrant#Scotland|warrants to arrest]] suspects and witnesses.

=====Arrest without a warrant=====
{{Main article|Powers of the police in England and Wales#Arrest without warrant}}
There are four subcategories of arrest without warrant:
*[[Powers of the police in England and Wales#Criminal offences|under the provisions of section 24 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]] (PACE), which only applies to [[constable]]s,
*[[Citizens arrest#England and Wales|under the provisions of section 24A of PACE]], applies to those who are not constables,
*[[Powers of the police in England and Wales#Breach of the peace|the power to arrest for a breach of the peace at common law]], which applies to everyone (constable or not and includes a power of entry), and
*[[Powers of the police in England and Wales#Other powers of arrest|the powers to arrest otherwise than for an offence]], which apply to constables only.

===United States===
United States law recognizes the [[common law]] arrest under various jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Atwater v. Lago Vista: Buckle-Up or Get Locked-Up: Warrantless Arrests for Fine-Only Misdemeanors Under the Fourth Amendment |last=Katz |first=Jason M. |journal=Akron Law Review |year=2003 |volume=36 |issue=3 |pages=496–498 |publisher=[[University of Akron School of Law]] |ref=harv |url=http://www.uakron.edu/law/lawreview/v36/docs/katz36.3.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111113407/http://www.uakron.edu/law/lawreview/v36/docs/katz36.3.pdf |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
The police may arrest a person according to a warrant issued by a Magistrate under sections 31, 72, 73 or 74 of the Magistrates Ordinance. For example, an arrest warrant may be issued if an accused person does not appear in Court when he is due to answer a charge.

However, an arrest warrant is not always necessary. Under section 50(1) of the Police Force Ordinance, a police officer can "apprehend" (i.e. arrest) a person if he reasonably suspects the person being arrested is guilty of an offence. Whether there is such a reasonable suspicion in a particular case is to be determined objectively by reference to facts and information which the arresting officer has at the time of the arrest. It is not necessary that the officer knows the exact statutory provision that the suspect has violated, so long as the officer reasonably suspects that the suspect has done something amounting to an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.clic.org.hk/en/topics/policeAndCrime/police_powers/q6.shtml |title = Under what circumstances can the police arrest me?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Warnings on arrest==

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Right to silence in England and Wales }}
In the United Kingdom a person must be told that they are under arrest in simple, non-technical language, the essential legal and factual grounds for his arrest. A person must be 'cautioned' when being arrested or subject to a criminal prosecution procedure, unless this is impractical due to the behaviour of the arrested person.

The caution required in England and Wales states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;You are under arrest on suspicion of (''offence''). You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court.    Anything you do say may be given in evidence.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Minor deviations from the words of any caution given do not constitute a breach of the Code of Practise, provided the sense of the caution is preserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pace-code-g-2012|title=PACE Code G 2012|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2018-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The caution required in Scotland states:

You are not obliged to say anything, but anything you do say will be noted and may be used in evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], [http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1871591 section 28] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220223357/http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?ActiveTextDocId=1871591 |date=20 February 2009 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Taylor v Thames Valley Police | link =  | country =  | court = EWCA | division = Civ | year = 2004 | num = 858 | para =  | eucase =  | parallelcite = [2004] 1 WLR 3155, [2004] 3 All ER 503 | date = 6 July 2004 | courtname = [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] | juris = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080107222454/http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/news-and-publications/publication/operational-policing/PACECodeCH.pdf?version=1 Code C] to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, para. 10.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Miranda warning}}
Based on the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling in ''[[Miranda v. Arizona]]'', after making an arrest, the police must inform the detainee of their [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] and  [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] rights in order for statements made during questioning to be admissible as evidence against the detainee in court. A [[Miranda warning]] is required only when a person has been taken into custody (i.e. is not free to leave) and is being interrogated, and the results of this interrogation are to be used in court. An officer is not required to inform a person of their Miranda rights if they will not be questioning them any further after their arrest. An officer is also not necessarily required to provide a Miranda warning if the person they are questioning has not been arrested or if a person they have arrested speaks spontaneously without being questioned. There is also an exception that permits questioning without providing the warning under circumstances involving urgent matters of public safety.

The warning must inform the detainee that they have the right to be silent, the right to legal council (and the availability of [[pro bono]] legal assistance), and that what they say can be used against them. The failure to provide a detainee with an adequate warning could make information obtained from an interrogation inadmissible in court, but does not prevent other evidence from being used to obtain a conviction. As in the British system, the exact phrasing of the warning is not explicitly mandated under federal law. There are also additional requirements about the warning that vary from state to state and may depend on the circumstances (such as when the arrestee is a non-citizen or juvenile). Since the exact wording used in an arrest is legally important, police officers often carry a printed copy of the rights with them and read from it when providing the warning to ensure accuracy.

===Hong Kong===
Immediately after the arrest, the police must inform you of your right to remain silent. You may choose whether or not to answer any questions posed by the police (except that you may need to provide your name and address to the police). The police officer will caution you by saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"You are not obliged to say anything unless you wish to do so but whatever you say will be put into writing and may be given in evidence." 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://www.clic.org.hk/en/topics/policeAndCrime/police_powers/q7.shtml |title = What are my rights if I am being arrested?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Search and Seizure==

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
{{Main article|Powers of the  police in England and Wales#People or vehicles}}

==Non-criminal arrests==

===United States===
Breach of a court order can be considered civil [[contempt of court]], and a warrant for the person's arrest may be issued. Some court orders contain authority for a police officer to make an arrest without further order.

If a [[legislature]] lacks a [[quorum]], many jurisdictions allow the members present the power to order a [[call of the house]], which orders the arrest of the members who are not present.  A member arrested is brought to the body's chamber to achieve a quorum.  The member arrested does not face prosecution, but may be required to pay a fine to the legislative body.

==Following arrest==
While an arrest will not necessarily lead to a [[criminal conviction]], it may nonetheless in some jurisdictions have serious ramifications such as absence from work, social stigma, and in some cases, the legal obligation to disclose a conviction when a person applies for a job, a loan or a professional license.  In the [[United States]] a person who was not found guilty after an arrest can remove their arrest record through an [[expungement]] or (in [[California]]) a finding of factual innocence. A cleared person has the choice to file a complaint or a lawsuit if they choose to. Legal action is sometimes filed against the government after a wrongful arrest.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

For convictions, the [[collateral consequences of criminal charges|collateral consequences]] are more severe in the United States than in the UK, where arrests without conviction do not appear in standard [[criminal record check]]s and need not be disclosed, whereas in the United States, people have to expunge or (if the case goes to court) seal arrest without convictions, or if the charges are dropped. However, in the UK, 'Enhanced' CRB disclosures permit a Chief Constable to disclose this data if they believe it relevant to the post for which the CRB disclosure was applied.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''Balwant Gargi''' (4 December 1916 – 22 April 2003) was a [[Punjabi language]] dramatist, theatre director, novelist, and short story writer, and academic.&lt;ref name=tri/&gt;

==Early life==
On 4 December 1916 in Neeta Khandan in [[Bathinda]] ([[Punjab (India)|Punjab]]), Balwant Gargi was born in a house in the Neeta Mal street, near the 1800-year-old historical Gobind Fort, famous for being the spot where [[Razia Sultana|Razia Sultan]] was imprisoned. The second son in the family of Shiv Chand, a head clerk in the Irrigation Department, he would go on create history in the world of Indian and Punjabi literature.

Gargi studied at [[Government College Lahore]], and completed his M.A.(English) and M.A.(Political Science) from [[FC College]] in [[Lahore]].&lt;ref name=tri&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030423/main6.htm Balwant Gargi dead] ''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]'', 23 April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied theatre with [[Norah Richards]] at her school in [[Kangra Valley]].

==Plays==
Gargi wrote several plays, including ''Loha Kutt'', ''Kesro'', ''Kanak Di Balli'', ''Sohni Mahiwal'', ''Sultan Razia'', ''Soukan'', ''Mirza Sahiba'' and ''Dhooni di Agg'' and short stories ''Mircha Wala Sadh'', ''Pattan di Berhi'' and ''Kuari Disi''. His plays were translated into 12 languages, and have been performed around the world, including [[Moscow]], [[London]], [[New Delhi]] and around the [[United States]].

Gargi's first play, ''Loha kutt'' (English: ''Blacksmith'') in 1944 became controversial for its stark picture of the Punjab countryside. At that juncture, he focused on poverty, [[illiteracy]], ignorance, and [[superstition]] marking rural life, which continued in ''Saelpathar'' (English: ''Petrified Stone'') in 1949, ''Navan mudh'' (English: ''New Beginning'') in 1950, and ''Ghugi'' (English: ''Dove'') in 1950. In the 1950 edition of Loha kutt, he resorted to drawing poetic and dramatic elements from [[J. M. Synge]] and [[Garcia Lorca]]. In subsequent works like ''Kanak di balli'' (English: ''Stalk of Wheat'') in 1968 and ''Dhuni di agg'' (English: ''Fire in the Furnace'') in 1977, these became his chief vehicles. For all the specificity of native locale, the former deflected as much towards Lorca's ''[[Blood Wedding (play)|Blood Wedding]]'' as the latter reminded one of Yerma. In ''Mirza-Sahiban'' in 1976, customs and conventions came in for bitter censure. Gradually, Gargi's preoccupation with sex, violence, and death became almost an obsession. [[Antonin Artaud]]`s theatre of cruelty grew into his [[categorical imperative]]. This required his [[dramaturgy]] to proceed through mythopoeia, which turns explicit in his last plays.

In ''Saunkan'' (English: ''Rival Women'') in 1979, the paradigm of [[Yama]]-[[Yami]], the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] god of death and his twin sister, becomes an occasion to glorify sexual union. Altogether dispensing with socio-political discourse, he turned to his new theme with a vengeance in ''Abhisarka'' (English: ''Lover'') in 1990. Gargi's penchant for the unexpected grew all-powerful.

For subject matter Gargi moved freely over social milieu, mythology, history, and folklore. For form and technique he relied as much upon [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] classics as on Lorca's poetic drama, [[Berthold Brecht|Brecht's]] [[epic theatre]], or Artaud's [[theatre of cruelty]]. In the composition and performance of his dozen full-length plays and five collections of one-act drama, he traveled from the realistic to the mythopoeic mode.

In addition to this dramatic corpus, Gargi's short stories began to be published in English. A book, ''Folk Theatre of India'', published in [[New York City]] and two semi-autobiographical novels in English and Punjabi, ''The Naked Triangle'' (''Nangi Dhup'') and ''The Purple Moonlight (Kashni Vehra)'' brought him to the forefront of cosmopolitan attention.&lt;ref name="thehinduretailplus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehinduretailplus.com/thehindu/mp/2003/05/26/stories/2003052600910200.htm |title=The Hindu : Scent of the soil, vision of the stars |publisher=thehinduretailplus.com |accessdate=6 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219111613/http://www.thehinduretailplus.com/thehindu/mp/2003/05/26/stories/2003052600910200.htm |archivedate=19 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balwant Gargi was among the pioneers of playwriting in Punjabi and the production and telecast of his plays like ''Sanjha Chulha'' on [[Doordarshan]] received countrywide appreciation

==Awards==
Gargi was awarded the [[Sahitya Akademi award]], the highest Indian literary award, in 1962 for his book ''Rang Manch''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://jsks.biz/rang-manch-balwant-gargi | title=Rang Manch | publisher=Navyug Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the [[Padma Shri]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://india.gov.in/myindia/padmashri_awards_list1.php?start=1380 Padma Shri Awards] ''Govt. of India'' website.&lt;/ref&gt; (1972), and the [[Sangeet Natak Akademi Award]] in Punjabi Playwriting in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sangeetnatak.org/sna/awardeeslist.htm |title=SNA: List of Akademi Awardees |publisher=[[Sangeet Natak Akademi]] Official website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217185616/http://www.sangeetnatak.org/sna/awardeeslist.htm |archivedate=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gargi is one of the few artists to win both the Sahitya Akademi and Sangeet Natak Akademi awards.

==Theatre and teaching==
Balwant Gargi taught for two years (1966–67) at the [[University of Washington]], where he met Jeanne Henry, who later became his wife. This period was the basis of his [[autobiography]] ''The Naked Triangle''.

Balwant Gargi was the founder-director of the Indian Theatre Department, [[Panjab University]], [[Chandigarh]]. The open-air theatre at the department is named after him. His students include [[Anupam Kher]], [[Kiron Kher]], [[Satish Kaushik]], [[Poonam Dhillon]], and many other current [[Bollywood]] stars.

Over the years, Gargi lectured and taught as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Harvard University]], [[Vassar College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|University of Hawai'i]], [[Yale University]], and many other renowned international institutions.

His children, Manu Gargi and Jannat Gargi, are settled in the United States. Manu is a producer of films in [[Hollywood]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3895">The first [[Bible translation|translation]] of the Bible into [[Cambodian language]], or Khmer, was by the American [[Arthur L. Hammond]], who began translating the Bible in 1925. The New Testament was completed in 1934 and the whole Bible in 1954. It was revised in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Gerard Ravasco ''Towards a Christian Pastoral Approach to Cambodian Culture'' Page 29 "Arthur L.

[[Christianity in Cambodia]] was ruthlessly suppressed during the [[Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia]] (1975-1979), then began to resurface under the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]]. New modern language versions followed in the 1990s but were initially not well received.&lt;ref&gt;Chalcedon report: Issues 378-389 Chalcedon (Organization) - 1997 "Unfortunately this new Cambodian Bible version has not borne good fruit. Many well respected Cambodian-speaking pastors in Cambodia and elsewhere are sternly warning their people to stay away from it. They say it is better to struggle over a challenging more literal translation than to regularly read a more shallow version of the Scriptures. The difference has been compared to food. The original Hammond literal translation has been compared to a hearty oriental chicken dinner while the modern Cambodian paraphrase is more like steamed white rice. Both are filling but only the meat gives lasting sustenance."&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the Bible Society in Cambodia supplies the ''Khmer Standard Version'' (2005) and the "Khmer Old Version" (Hammond Version 1954, 1962).&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblecambodia.org/catalogue.html#bookmark1 UBS catalogue: ''Khmer Standard Version'' (2005) and the ''Khmer Old Version'' (Hammond Version 1954, 1962).]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 The [[Watchtower Bible and Tract Society]] produced the [[New World Translation]] of the Christian Greek Scriptures in Khmer.

While the  [[Languages of Malaysia|Malaysian languages]] only consist of [[Malay language]] and a few other languages, [[Languages of Indonesia|Indonesian languages]] consist of more than 726 local languages, Malay language being one of them.

===Indonesian===
{{main|Bible translations into Indonesian}}
Since [[Indonesia]] gained [[Indonesian Independence Day|its independence]], there have been at least ten Bible translations made, due to the rapid changes in the Indonesian language; every few years each translation's language becomes outdated. The most widespread translation used by Indonesian speakers right now is the ''[[Terjemahan Baru]],'' or "New Translation" (1974), published by LAI ("Lembaga Alkitab Indonesia," or [[Indonesian Bible Society]]). 

List of modern (1945 onward) translations:
*Alkitab Terjemahan Lama (1958): called the Old Translation after the New Translation (1974) came out. Before that it was the only translation in the Indonesian language. However, it was not an original translation; rather, it was a combined translation from Klinkert's Old Testament (1879), in Malay language, and Bode's New Testament (1938) also in Malay language, which was called "an emergency publication"&lt;ref&gt;{{id}} [http://sejarah.sabda.org/sejarah/ver_terjemahan_lama.htm Sejarah Alkitab Indonesia: Versi Terjemahan Lama]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alkitab Bouma/Ende (1968): first Catholic translation in Indonesian language by P.Y. Bouma, printed in Ende, Flores, Nusa Tenggara Timur
*Alkitab Terjemahan Baru (1974): first fresh Protestant translation in Indonesian language by Indonesian Bible Society's team of translators, printed in Jakarta
*Alkitab Kabar Baik (BIS) (1985): first dynamic translation in Indonesian language (since Terjemahan Baru was translated in formal Indonesian) by IBS, based on [[Today's English Version]]
*Firman Allah Yang Hidup (1989) by Yayasan Kalam Hidup: printed in Bandung, this translation is based on [[The Living Bible]], and paraphrased by a team led by Dr. Ganda Wargasetia
*Kitab Suci Injil (2000): a revision of 1912 Malay New Testament by Shellabear, printed side-by-side with its Greek text
*Kitab Suci Komunitas Kristiani (2002) by Yayasan OBOR: a new Catholic translation, printed in Jakarta
*Alkitab Versi Mudah Dibaca (2005) by World Bible Translation Center: a new translation based on the [[Easy to Read Version]]
*Indonesian Literal Translation (2008) by Yayasan Lentera Bangsa: a new translation aimed primarily at the wording of "Yahweh" instead of "Allah" (used in every other Indonesian Bible)
*Wasiat Baru - King James Indonesia (2011): a new translation based on the [[King James Version]] and other English versions such as the [[New International Version]]

In 1877, the whole New Testament was finished by [[Sierk Coolsma]], and followed by the whole Bible in 1891. Coolsma also published some books of the NT in Arabic script ([[Jawi script]]) in 1871.

=== Bugis/Makassar ===
[[Benjamin Frederick Matthes|B.F. Matthes]] (1818–1908) translated the Bible into [[Bugis language]] of southern [[Sulawesi]] (1863 Matthew, 1888 NT, 1901 OT) and [[Makassar language]] (1864 Matthew, 1888 OT, 1900 NT).

===Batak Toba===
[[Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen]] (1834 - 1918), of the [[Rhenish Mission Society]], translated the Bible into [[Batak Toba language|Batak Toba]] of northern Sumatra (1878 in [[Batak script]] and 1885 in Latin script)

=== Sangir ===
[[E.T. Steller]] (1834–1897) translated the Bible into [[Siau language]] (1883 NT) and [[Sangir language]] of northern Sulawesi (1942 NT).

      <comment>/* Vowels */ there is no contradiction between the last paragraph and the preceding statements and, apart from the listing, it is superfluous. Of course pupils are initially taught a simplified - but not false - account, and that fact is unimportant for the purposes of this article anyway.</comment>

This article discusses the '''[[phonology|phonological]] system of [[Bulgarian language|Standard Bulgarian]]'''. Most scholars agree that contemporary Bulgarian has 45 phonemes but different authors place the real number of Bulgarian phonemes between 42 and 47,{{cn|date= August 2015|reason=Wasn't there a controversy around the phonemic status of the soft consonants? This would affect the count.}} depending on whether one includes or excludes phonemes which appear primarily only in borrowed foreign words.

==Vowels==
[[File:Bulgarian vowel chart2.svg|right|thumb|upright=1.13|Standard Bulgarian vowels. From {{Harvcoltxt|Ternes|Vladimirova-Buhtz|1999}}.]]
{| class="wikitable"
!
! Front
! Central
! Back
|-
! High
| и {{IPAslink|i}}
|
| у {{IPAslink|u}}, {{IPAblink|o}}
|-
! Mid
| е {{IPAslink|ɛ}}
| ъ {{IPAslink|ɤ̞|ɤ}}, {{IPAblink|ɐ}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;Sometimes transcribed as {{IPA|/ə/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
| о {{IPAslink|ɔ}}, {{IPAblink|o}}
|-
! Low

| а {{IPAslink|a}}, {{IPAblink|ɐ}}

|}

Bulgarian vowels may be grouped in three pairs according to their backness: the front vowels '''е''' ({{IPAslink|ɛ}}) and '''и''' ({{IPAslink|i}}), the central vowels '''а''' ({{IPAslink|a}}, {{IPAblink|ɐ}}) and '''ъ''' ({{IPAslink|ɤ̞|ɤ}}, {{IPAblink|ɐ}}) and the back vowels '''о''' ({{IPAslink|ɔ}}, {{IPAblink|o}}) and '''у''' ({{IPAslink|u}}, {{IPAblink|o}}). In stressed syllables, six vowels are phonemic.{{cn|date=August 2015}} Unstressed vowels tend to be shorter and weaker compared to their [[stress (linguistics)|stressed]] counterparts, and the corresponding pairs of open and closed vowels approach each other with a tendency to merge, above all as [[low vowel|low]] ([[open vowel|open]] and [[open-mid vowel|open-mid]]) vowels are raised and shift towards the [[high vowel|high]] ([[close vowel|close]] and [[close-mid vowel|close-mid]]) ones. However, the coalescence is not always complete. The vowels are often distinguished in emphatic or deliberately distinct pronunciation, and reduction is strongest in colloquial speech. Besides that, some linguists distinguish two degrees of reduction, as they have found that a clearer distinction tends to be maintained in the syllable immediately preceding the stressed one. The complete merger of the pair {{IPA|/a/}} – {{IPA|/ɤ/}} is regarded as most common, while the status of {{IPA|/ɔ/}} vs {{IPA|/u/}} is less clear. The coalescence of {{IPA|/ɛ/}} and {{IPA|/i/}} is not allowed in formal speech and is regarded as a provincial (East Bulgarian) dialectal feature; instead, unstressed {{IPA|/ɛ/}} is both raised and [[centralization (phonetics)|centralized]], approaching {{IPA|[ɤ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zhobov|2004|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{IPA|/ɤ/}} vowel itself does not exist as a [[phoneme]] in other Slavic languages, though a similar reduced vowel transcribed as {{IPA|[ə]}} does occur.

==Semivowels==
The Bulgarian language possesses only one [[semivowel]]: {{IPAslink|j}}. Orthographically it is represented by the Cyrillic letter {{angbr|[[short_I|й]]}} ({{angbr|[[I (Cyrillic)|и]]}} with a [[breve]]) as in {{lang|bg|най}} {{IPA|[naj]}} ('most'), {{lang|bg|тролей}} {{IPA|[troˈlɛj]}} ('trolleybus'), except when it precedes {{IPA|/a/}} or {{IPA|/u/}} (and their reduced counterparts {{IPA|[ɐ]}} and {{IPA|[o]}}), in which case each of the two phonemes is represented by a single letter, respectively {{angbr|я}} or {{angbr|ю}}: e.g. {{lang|bg|ютия}} {{IPA|[joˈtijɐ]}} ('flat iron'), but {{lang|bg|Йордан}} {{IPA|[jorˈdan]}} ('Jordan').

==Consonants==
Bulgarian has a total of 35 consonant [[phonemes]] (see table below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Scatton|1984|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Klagstad Jr.|1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Joshi|Aaron|2006|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three additional phonemes can also be found ({{IPA|[xʲ]}}, {{IPA|[d͡z]}}, and {{IPA|[d͡zʲ]}}), but only in foreign [[proper names]] such as {{lang|bg|Хюстън}} {{IPA|/xʲustɤn/}} ('Houston'), {{lang|bg|Дзержински}} {{IPA|/d͡zɛrʒinski/}} ('[[Dzerzhinsky (disambiguation)|Dzerzhinsky]]'), and {{lang|bg|Ядзя}} {{IPA|/jad͡zʲa/}}, ('[[Jadzia]]'). They are, however, normally not considered part of the phonetic inventory of the Bulgarian language. The Bulgarian [[obstruent]] consonants are divided into 12 pairs of voiced and voiceless consonants. The only obstruent without a counterpart is the [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|/x/}}. The voicing contrast is neutralized in word-final position, where [[Final-obstruent devoicing|all obstruents are voiceless]], at least with regard to the official [[orthoepy]] of the contemporary Bulgarian spoken language (word-final devoicing is a common feature in [[Slavic languages]]); this neutralization is, however, not reflected in the spelling.

An alternative analysis, however, treats the palatalized variants of consonant sounds as sequences of the consonant and {{IPA|/j/}} (for example, {{lang|bg|някой}} {{IPA|/nʲakoj/}} is analyzed as {{IPA|/njakoj/}}). This effectively reduces the consonant inventory to merely 22 phonemes. No ambiguity rises from such analysis since the palatalized consonants occur only before vowels, and never before other consonants or in the syllable coda as they do in some other languages with palatalized consonants (for example, in the fellow Slavic language, [[Russian phonology|Russian]]).&lt;ref&gt;International Phonetic Association (1999), ''Handbook of the International Phonetic Association: A Guide to the Use of the International Phonetic Alphabet'', pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;56.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|1a|1}} According to {{Harvcoltxt|Klagstad Jr.|1958|pp=46–48}}, {{IPA|/t tʲ d dʲ s sʲ z zʲ n/}} are dental. He also analyzes {{IPA|/ɲ/}} as palatalized dental nasal, and provides no information about the place of articulation of {{IPA|/t͡s t͡sʲ r rʲ l ɫ/}}.

{{note|2a|2}} Only as an allophone of {{IPA|/m/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}}. For example, {{lang|bg|инфлация}} {{IPA|[iɱˈflatsijɐ]}} ('inflation').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabev|first=Mitko|title=Bulgarian Sound System|url=http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~llsroach/phon2/b_phon/b_phon.htm|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|3a|3}} As an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}. Examples: {{lang|bg|тънко}} {{IPA|[ˈtɤŋko]}} ('thin' neut.), {{lang|bg|танго}} {{IPA|[tɐŋˈɡɔ]}} ('tango').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabev|first=Mitko|title=Bulgarian Sound System|url=http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~llsroach/phon2/b_phon/b_phon.htm|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|4a|4}} {{IPA|/x/}} is voiced {{IPAblink|ɣ}} at word boundaries before voiced obstruents. Example: {{lang|bg|видях го}} {{IPA|[viˈdʲaɣɡo]}} ('I saw him').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabev|first=Mitko|title=Bulgarian Sound System|url=http://www.personal.rdg.ac.uk/~llsroach/phon2/b_phon/b_phon.htm|accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|5a|5}} Described as having "only slight friction".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ternes|first=Elmer|last2=Vladimirova-Buhtz|first2=Tatjana|year=1999|chapter=Bulgarian|pages=55|title=Handbook of the International Phonetic Association|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-63751-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{note|6a|6}} Not a native phoneme, but appears in borrowings from English, where it is often vocalised as {{IPAslink|u}} or pronounced as a fricative {{IPAslink|v}} in older borrowings which have come through German or Russian. It is always written as the Cyrillic letter ⟨{{lang|bg|у}}⟩ {{IPAslink|u}} in Bulgarian orthography although a small number of people have suggested the use of ⟨{{lang|bg|ў}}⟩ in such cases (by way of analogy  to the shape (mainly the use of a [[breve]]) of the Cyrillic letter ⟨[[short_I|й]]⟩ which stands for the semi-vowel {{IPAslink|j}} in Bulgarian). That suggestion for the use of ⟨{{lang|bg|ў}}⟩ hasn't gained any widespread use, however.

{{note|7a|7}} {{IPA|[l]}} can be analyzed as an allophone of {{IPA|/ɫ/}}, as it appears only before front vowels. A trend of [[l-vocalization]] is emerging among younger native speakers and more often in colloquial speech.

===Hard and palatalized consonants===
Like a number of Eastern Slavic languages, most consonant phonemes come in "hard" and "soft" pairs. The latter tend to feature [[palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]], or the raising of the tongue toward the hard palate. Thus, for example, {{IPA|/b/}} contrasts with {{IPA|/bʲ/}} by the latter being palatalized. The consonants {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}}, and {{IPA|/d͡ʒ/}} are considered hard and do not have palatalized variants, though they may have palatalization in some speakers' pronunciation.

The distinction between hard and soft consonants is clear in Bulgarian orthography, where hard consonants are considered normal and precede either {{angbr|{{lang|bg|а}}}}, {{angbr|{{lang|bg|у}}}}, {{angbr|{{lang|bg|о}}}}, {{angbr|{{lang|bg|и}}}}, {{angbr|{{lang|bg|е}}}} or {{angbr|{{lang|bg|ъ}}}}. Soft consonants appear before {{angbr|{{lang|bg|я}}}}, {{angbr|{{lang|bg|ю}}}}, or {{angbr|{{lang|bg|ьо}}}}. In certain contexts, the contrast hard/soft contrast is neutralized. For example, in Eastern dialects, only soft consonants appear before {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}. {{IPA|/l/}} varies: one of its allophones, involving a raising of the back of the tongue and a lowering of its middle part (thus similar or, according to some scholars, identical to a [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|velarized lateral]]), occurs in all positions, except before the vowels {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/ɛ/}}, where a more "clear" version with a slight raising of the middle part of the tongue occurs. The latter pre-front realization is traditionally called "soft l" (though it is not phonetically palatalized). In some Western Bulgarian dialects, this allophonic variation does not exist.

Furthermore, in the speech of many young people the more common and arguably velarized allophone of {{IPA|/l/}} is often realized as a [[labiovelar approximant]] {{IPA|[w]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Zhobov|2004|pp=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon, sometimes colloquially referred to as {{lang|bg|мързеливо л}} ('lazy l') in Bulgaria, was first registered in the 1970s and isn't connected to original dialects. Similar developments, termed [[L-vocalization]], have occurred in many languages, including [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]] and certain dialects of English such as [[Cockney]] and [[AAVE]].

===Palatalization===
During the [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of most hard consonants (the bilabial, labiodental and alveolar ones), the middle part of the tongue is lifted towards the palate, resulting in the formation of a second articulatory centre whereby the specific palatal "clang" of the soft consonants is achieved. The articulation of alveolars {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/r/}}, however, usually does not follow that rule; the palatal clang is achieved by moving the place of articulation further back towards the palate so that {{IPA|/ʎ/}}, {{IPA|/ɲ/}} and {{IPA|/rʲ/}} are actually alveopalatal (postalvelolar) consonants. Soft {{IPA|/ɡ/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} ({{IPA|/ɡʲ/}} and {{IPA|/kʲ/}}, respectively) are articulated not on the velum but on the palate and are considered [[palatal consonants]].

===Word stress===
Stress is not usually signified in written text. In cases where the stress must be indicated, a [[grave accent]] is placed on the vowel of the stressed syllable.&lt;ref group=note&gt;For practical purposes, the grave accent can be [[Combining character|combined]] with letters by pasting the symbol "&lt;tt&gt;̀&lt;/tt&gt;" directly after the designated letter. An alternative is to use the keyboard shortcut Alt + 0300 (if working under a [[Windows (operating system)|Windows operating system]]), or to add the decimal [[HTML code]] "&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;#768;&lt;/tt&gt;" after the targeted stressed vowel if editing HTML source code. See [https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0300/index.htm "Accute accent" diacritic character in Unicode], [https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/045d/index.htm  Unicode character "Cyrillic small letter i with grave"] and [https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/040d/index.htm  Unicode character "Cyrillic capital letter i with grave"] for the exact Unicode characters that utilize the [[grave accent]]. Retrieved 2010-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bulgarian [[lexical stress|word stress]] is ''dynamic''. Stressed syllables are louder and longer than unstressed ones. As in Russian and other East Slavic languages, Bulgarian stress is also ''lexical'' rather than ''fixed'' as in French, Latin or the West Slavic languages. It may fall on any syllable of a polysyllabic word, and its position may vary depending on the inflection and derivation, for example:
* ''nouns'' – {{lang|bg|мъ̀ж}} {{IPA|/mɤʃ/}} ('man'), {{lang|bg|мъжъ̀т}} {{IPA|/mɐˈʒɤt/}} ('the man'), {{lang|bg|мъжѐ}} {{IPA|/mɐˈʒɛ/}} ('men'), {{lang|bg|мъжѐте}} {{IPA|/mɐˈʒɛtɛ/}} ('the men')
* ''verbs'' – {{lang|bg|отѝвам}} {{IPA|/oˈtivɐm/}} ('I am going'), {{lang|bg|отидѝ}}  {{IPA|/otiˈdi/}} ('go!')

Bulgarian stress is also ''distinctive'': the following examples are not only differentiated by stress (see the different vowels):
* ''nouns''
** {{lang|bg|въ̀лна}} {{IPA|/ˈvɤɫnɐ/}} ('wool'), {{lang|bg|вълна̀}} {{IPA|/vɐɫˈna/}} ('wave')
** {{lang|bg|па̀ра}} {{IPA|/ˈparɐ/}}  ('steam'), {{lang|bg|пара̀}} {{IPA|/pɐˈra/}} ('coin')
* ''verbs''
** {{lang|bg|когато до̀йде}} {{IPA|/koˈɡato ˈdɔjdɛ/}} ('when he comes'), {{lang|bg|когато дойдѐ}} {{IPA|/koˈɡato dojˈdɛ/}} (when he came')
** {{lang|bg|взрѝвен}} {{IPA|/ˈvzrivɛn/}} ('explosive'), {{lang|bg|взривѐн}} {{IPA|/vzriˈvɛn/}} ('exploded') &lt;ref group="note"&gt;Note that the last example is only spelled the same in the masculine. In the feminine, neuter and the plural, it is spelled differently – e.g. ''vzrìvna'' ('explosive' fem.), ''vzrivèna'' ('exploded' fem.), etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stress usually isn't signified in written text, even in the above examples, if the context makes the meaning clear. However, the grave accent may be written if confusion is likely. &lt;ref group="note"&gt;However, the grave accent is obligatorily used to disambiguate between the two non-stressed words –
* {{lang|bg|и}} ('and'), {{lang|bg|ѝ}} ('to her')
Since many computer programs do not allow for accents on Cyrillic letters, "{{lang|bg|й}}" is sometimes seen instead of "{{lang|bg|ѝ}}".&lt;/ref&gt;

The stress is often written in order to signify a dialectal deviation from the standard pronunciation:
* {{lang|bg|каза̀ ми}} {{IPA|/kɐˈza mi/}} ('he told me'), instead of {{lang|bg|каза ми}} {{IPA|/ˈkazɐ mi/}}
* {{lang|bg|иска̀ да дойде}} {{IPA|/iˈska dɐ dɔjdɛ/}} ('he wanted to come'), instead of {{lang|bg|искаше да дойде}} {{IPA|/ˈiskɐʃɛ dɐ dɔjdɛ/}})&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Note that in this case the accent would be written in order to differentiate it from the present tense {{lang|bg|иска да дойде}} {{IPA|/ˈiskɐ dɐ dojdɛ/}} ('he wants to come').&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bulk messaging''' is the dissemination of large numbers of [[SMS]] messages for delivery to [[mobile phone]] terminals. It is used by media companies, enterprises, banks (for marketing and fraud control)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmagazineuk.com/Mobile-phone-technology-developed-to-cut-down-credit-card-fraud/article/136597/|title=Mobile phone technology developed to cut down credit card fraud|date=12 May 2009|website=www.scmagazineuk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consumer brands for a variety of purposes including entertainment, enterprise and mobile marketing.

Bulk messaging is commonly used for alerts, reminders, marketing but also for information and communication between both staff and customers.

==Software==

Software is required for sending and receiving bulk messages and various software packages are available. These software packages provide users with the opportunity to add as many phone numbers as required and these phone numbers can be managed in a variety of ways.  Most SMS software applications allow the upload of lists of mobile phone numbers using a [[text file]] or [[Comma-separated values|CSV file]]. Some sophisticated systems can automatically remove any duplicated numbers and the mobile numbers may be validated prior to sending the messages.  With enhanced software features, messages can be scheduled to be sent at specific times and/or days and bulk messages can be sent on national and international mobile networks as long as the bulk messaging software provider sends internationally.

==API==
Most bulk messaging services use the following standard application programming interfaces (APIs) which allow programmers to add SMS functionality to any program:
* [[Email]]
* [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] (File Transfer Protocol)
* [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
* [[Short Message Peer-to-Peer|SMPP]] (Short Message Peer-to-Peer)

A '''closed-ended question''' refers to any question for which a researcher provides research participants with options from which to choose a response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-open-ended-and-closed-ended-questions.html|website=''yourdictionary.com''|publisher=yourdictionary.com|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open-ended questions are sometimes phrased as a [[Declarative sentence|statement]] which requires a response.

A closed-ended question contrasts with an [[open-ended question]], which cannot easily be answered with specific information.

Examples of close-ended questions which may elicit a "yes" or "no" response include:
*Were you born in {{CURRENTYEAR}}?
*Is [[Lyon]] the capital of France?
*Did you steal the money?

Similarly, variants of the above close-ended questions which possess specific responses are:
*On what day were you born? ("[[{{CURRENTWEEKDAYNAME}}]].")
*What is the capital of France? ("Paris.")
*Where did you steal the money? ("From the bank.")

At the same time, there are closed-ended questions which are sometimes impossible to answer correctly with a yes or no without confusion, for example: "Have you stopped taking heroin?" (if you never took it) or "Who told you to take heroin?"; see "[[loaded question]]".

A study by the [[University of Cincinnati]] found 20 to 40 percent of Americans will provide an opinion when they do not have one because of [[social pressure]], using [[Contextual learning|context clues]] to select an answer they believe will please the questioner. A classic example of this phenomenon was the 1947 study of the fictional [[Metallic Metals Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.kivitv.com/-/the-bomb-agrabah-survey-shows-how-problematic-polling-can-be |title=The 'Bomb Agrabah' Survey Shows How Problematic Polling Can Be |last=Daniels |first=Eugene |date=18 December 2015 |publisher=[[KIVI-TV]] |access-date= 17 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Closed-ended questions in education ==
Some in the field of education argue that closed-ended questions are broadly speaking "bad" questions. They are questions that are often asked to obtain a specific answer and are therefore good for testing knowledge. It is often argued that open-ended questions (i.e. questions that elicit more than a yes/no answers) are preferable because they open up discussion and enquiry.

Peter Worley argues that this is a false assumption. This is based on Worley’s central arguments that there are two different kinds of open and closed questions: grammatical and conceptual. He argues that educational practitioners should be aiming for questions that are "grammatically closed, but conceptually open".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=3 December 2016|title=Ariadne's Clew Absence and presence in the facilitation of philosophical conversations|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1350/870|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v3i2.1350|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in standard parlance, "is it ever right to lie?" would be regarded as a closed question: it elicits a yes–no response. Significantly, however, it is conceptually open. Any initial yes–no answer to it can be "opened up" by the questioner ("why do you think that?", "Could there be an instance where that's not the case?), inviting elaboration and enquiry.

This grammatically closed but cognitively open style of questioning, Worley argues, "gives [educators] the best of both worlds: the focus and specificity of a closed question (this, after all, is why teachers use them) and the inviting, elaborating character of an open question".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/question-your-questioning|title=Question your questioning|date=19 April 2017|work=Tes|access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closed questions, simply require "opening up" strategies to ensure that conceptually open questions can fulfil their educational potential.

Worley's structural and semantic distinction between open and closed questions is integral to his pedagogical invention "Open Questioning Mindset" (OQM). OQM refers to the development, in educators, of an open attitude towards the process of learning and the questioning at the heart of that process. It is a mind-set that is applicable to all subject areas and all pedagogical environments. Teachers who develop an Open Questioning Mindset listen openly for the cognitive content of student's contributions and looks for ways to use what is given for learning opportunities, whether right, wrong, relevant or apparently irrelevant. OQM encourages a style of pedagogy that values genuine enquiry in the classroom. It provides teachers with the tools to move beyond what Worley calls "guess what's in my head" teaching, that relies on closed and leading questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Worley|first=Peter|date=29 November 2015|title=Open thinking, closed questioning: Two kinds of open and closed question|url=https://www.ojs.unisa.edu.au/index.php/jps/article/view/1269|journal=Journal of Philosophy in Schools|volume=2|issue=2|doi=10.21913/JPS.v2i2.1269|issn=2204-2482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Community interpreting''' is a specific type of [[interpreting]] service which is found more in community-based than organisational situations.  It is a particularly vital service in communities with large numbers of [[Ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]], enabling those minorities to access services where, due to the [[language barrier]], they would otherwise find it difficult. Situations where such interpreters are necessary are typical include medical, educational, [[House|housing]], [[social security]] and legal areas.

Community interpreters need not only to be fluent in the language that they are interpreting, but also with the [[public services]] involved, to be aware of the cultural and racial implications of the interpreting work. Interpreters are also expected to follow the Interpreter's Code of Ethics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5668">{{unsolved|mathematics|Do the graphs with a fixed forbidden induced subgraph necessarily have large cliques or large independent sets?}}
In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''Erdős–Hajnal conjecture''' states that families of graphs defined by [[forbidden graph characterization|forbidden induced subgraph]]s have either large [[Clique (graph theory)|cliques]] or large [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent sets]]. It is named for [[Paul Erdős]] and [[András Hajnal]].

More precisely, for an arbitrary [[undirected graph]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_H&lt;/math&gt; be the family of graphs that do not have &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; as an [[induced subgraph]]. Then, according to the conjecture, there exists a constant &lt;math&gt;\delta_H &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-vertex graphs in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_H&lt;/math&gt; have either a clique or an independent set of size &lt;math&gt;\Omega(n^{\delta_H})&lt;/math&gt;.

An equivalent statement to the original conjecture is that, for every graph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;-free graphs all contain polynomially large [[perfect graph|perfect]] [[induced subgraph]]s.

==Graphs without large cliques or independent sets==
In contrast, for [[random graph]]s in the [[Erdős–Rényi model]] with edge probability 1/2, both the [[maximum clique]] and the [[maximum independent set]] are much smaller: their size is proportional to the [[logarithm]] of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, rather than growing polynomially. [[Ramsey's theorem]] proves that no graph has both its maximum clique size and maximum independent set size smaller than logarithmic.&lt;ref name="c14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="aps"/&gt; Ramsey's theorem also implies the special case of the Erdős–Hajnal conjecture when &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; itself is a clique or independent set.&lt;ref name="c14"/&gt;

==Partial results==
This conjecture is due to [[Paul Erdős]] and [[András Hajnal]], who proved it to be true when &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a [[cograph]]. They also showed, for arbitrary &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, that the size of the largest clique or independent set grows superlogarithmically. More precisely, for every &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; there is a constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-vertex &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;-free graphs have cliques or independent sets containing at least &lt;math&gt;\exp c\sqrt{\log n}&lt;/math&gt; vertices.&lt;ref name="c14"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

An earlier formulation of the conjecture, also by Erdős and Hajnal and still unsolved, concerns the special case when &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a 5-vertex [[cycle graph]].&lt;ref name="reflections"/&gt; The &lt;math&gt;C_5&lt;/math&gt;-free graphs include the [[perfect graph]]s, which necessarily have either a clique or independent set of size proportional to the square root of their number of vertices. Conversely, every clique or independent set is itself perfect. For this reason, a convenient and symmetric reformulation of the Erdős–Hajnal conjecture is that for every graph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;-free graphs necessarily contain an induced perfect subgraph of polynomial size.&lt;ref name="c14"/&gt;

==History==
The French language was introduced to Laos in the 19th century when French explorers arrived in Laos trying to make inroads into [[China]] after colonizing Vietnam. The French did not pay much attention to the kingdom of [[Lan Xang]] but established a consulate in present-day [[Luang Prabang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.savannanet.com/frlegacy.htm|publisher=France-Diplomatie|title=French legacy in Laos|date=|accessdate=2010-10-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827045901/http://www.savannanet.com/frlegacy.htm|archivedate=2010-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual catalysts for the establishment of colonial protectorate over Lao cultural regions were French fears of economic and political competition from Britain.&lt;ref&gt;John Holt (2009). Page 79. Spirits of the Place: Buddhism and Lao Religious Culture. University of Hawaii Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   By the 1890s, border disputes with [[Siam]] and France led to the [[Franco-Siamese War]] and the borders of Laos and Siam were established in favor of France and Laos became a French protectorate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ooi|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in Vietnam, the French did not pursue to fully exert their influence in Laos and it was not until the 1900s that French began to be introduced into schools in Laos, but it was mostly limited to [[Vientiane]]. However, French rule finally gained firmer ground and French soon became the primary language of government and education and the language spread into southern Laos following the founding of [[Pakse]]. The French language peaked between the 1910s and [[World War II]] and spread throughout the nation but, like Vietnam, was not widely spoken in most rural areas. French eventually became the language of government officials and the elite. When Japan invaded Laos in World War II, French remained in the educational system, unlike in Vietnam, where [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] became the sole language of education, but the [[Lao language]] was briefly used in the government.&lt;ref name="c309"&gt;Chieu, p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; French returned as the sole political language after France resumed its rule of Laos and was co-official with Lao when Laos was granted [[Kingdom of Laos|self-rule in 1949]], but Lao became the sole official language after independence in 1953.

The French language's decline was slower and occurred later than in Vietnam and Cambodia in Laos as the monarchy of Laos had close political relations with France. At the eve of the [[Vietnam War]], the [[Laotian Civil War|Secret War]] was beginning in Laos as political factions between communist [[Pathet Lao]] and the government occurred. Pathet Lao held areas used Lao as their sole language and following the end of the Vietnam War, French began its sharp decline in Laos. Additionally, many elite and French-educated Lao immigrated to nations such as the [[United States]] and [[France]] to escape government persecution. With the end of isolationism in the early 1990s however, the French language rebounded, thanks to the establishment of French, Swiss and Canadian relations and opening of French-language centers in central Laos.&lt;ref name="La Francophonie in Asia"/&gt; Today, French has a healthier status in Laos than the other Francophone nations of Asia and about 35% of all students in Laos receive their education in French, with the language being a required course in many schools.&lt;ref name="La Francophonie in Asia"/&gt; French is also used in public works in central and southern Laos and Luang Prabang and is a language of diplomacy and of the elite classes, higher professions and elders. However, the [[English language]] has continued to threaten the French language in Laos as it is seen as the language of international commerce and some schools have also made English a mandatory subject. Laos is also a member of [[La Francophonie]].

==Characteristics==
The French spoken in Laos is based on standard Parisian French but has some minor differences in vocabulary as in other French dialects of Asia. Mixtures of Lao are sometimes added into French, giving it a local flavor. Some Lao words that have found their way into the French language are used in Laos as well. There are some notable differences between Lao and standard French such as:

* The word ''rue'' can be used to refer to any street, road, avenue and highway unlike standard French which also uses ''avenue'' or ''boulevard''.
* The incorporation of Lao words into French when referring to native Lao topics such as food, plants, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7497">'''Hardiness''' of [[plant]]s describes their ability to survive adverse growing conditions. It is usually limited to discussions of [[climatic]] adversity. Thus a plant's ability to tolerate [[cold]], [[heat]], [[drought]], [[flood]]ing, or [[wind]] are typically considered measurements of hardiness. Hardiness of plants is defined by their native extent's geographic location: [[longitude]], [[latitude]] and [[elevation]]. These attributes are often simplified to a [[hardiness zone]]. In [[temperate]] latitudes, the term most often describes resistance to cold, or "cold-hardiness", and is generally measured by the lowest temperature a plant can withstand. Hardiness of a plant is usually divided into two categories: tender, and hardy.  Some sources also use the erroneous terms "Half-hardy" or "Fully hardy".  Tender plants are those killed by freezing temperatures, while hardy plants survive freezing&amp;mdash;at least down to certain temperatures, depending on the plant. "Half-hardy" is a term used sometimes in horticulture to describe [[bedding (horticulture)|bedding]] plants which are sown in heat in winter or early spring, and planted outside after all danger of frost has passed. "Fully hardy" usually refers to plants being classified under the Royal Horticultural Society classifications, and can often cause confusion to those not using this method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Titchmarsh|first=Alan|title=How to be a gardener|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/htbg/module2/perennials_and_bedding_plants1.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=24 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants vary a lot in their tolerance of growing conditions. The [[selective breeding]] of [[variety (botany)|varieties]] capable of withstanding particular climates forms an important part of [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]]. Plants adapt to changes in climate on their own to some extent. Part of the work of nursery growers of plants consists of [[cold hardening]], or hardening off their plants, to prepare them for likely conditions in later life.

==Winter hardiness==
Winter-hardy plants grow during the [[winter]], or at least remain healthy and [[dormancy|dormant]]. Apart from hardy [[evergreen]]s, these include many cultivated plants, including varieties of [[cabbage]] and [[broccoli]], and all kinds of [[carrot]]. Some bulbs – such as [[tulip]]s – need cold winters to bloom, while others – such as [[freesia]] – can survive a freezing winter.  Many domestic plants are assigned a [[hardiness zone]] that specifies the climates in which they can survive. [[Winter garden]]s are dependent upon the cultivation of winter-hardy plants.

==Mechanisms==
Woody plants survive freezing temperatures by suppressing the formation of ice in living cells or by allowing water to freeze in plant parts that are not affected by ice formation. The common mechanism for woody plants to survive up to –40&amp;nbsp;°C (–40&amp;nbsp;°F) is [[supercooling]]. Woody plants that survive lower temperatures are dehydrating their cells, allowing water to freeze between cell walls and the cells to survive. Plants normally considered hardy may not survive freezing if they are not readily acclimated, which renders them unable to use these mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/hortnews/1996/3-1-1996/brr.html |title=How Woody Plants Survive Extreme Cold |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=March 1, 1996 |website=Iowa State University |publisher=Horticulture &amp; Home Pest News |accessdate=December 4, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardiness ratings==
[[File:Heather in Yorkshire 02.JPG|thumbnail|right|Heather, ''[[Calluna vulgaris]]'', one of Britain's hardiest plants ([[North York Moors]])]]
Various hardiness ratings are published. In the USA, the most widely used is the [[USDA]] system of [[hardiness zone]]s based on average minimum yearly temperatures.{{citation needed|date = July 2015}} This system was developed specifically for the extremely diverse range of conditions in the [[United States]] (US), from baking desert to frozen tundra.  Another commonly used system is the Sunset Climate Zone system {{citation needed|date = March 2014}}.  This system is much more specific to climates (i.e. precipitation, temperature, and humidity based) and less dependent on the yearly minimum.

In contrast the [[United Kingdom]] (UK) and [[Western Europe]] have an oceanic climate, and experience a narrower range of temperatures that is tempered by the presence of the [[Gulf Stream]]. This results in areas like western Scotland experiencing relatively mild winter conditions that enable the growing of subtropical plants, despite being well to the north of subtropical climate areas. The [[Royal Horticultural Society]] has published a set of hardiness ratings applicable to the UK.{{sfn|RHS|2017}} The ratings range from H1a to H7. H1a, higher than {{convert|15|C|F|abbr=on}}, applies to tropical plants permanently under glass in heat; while H7, below {{convert|-20|C|F|abbr=on}}, applies to very cold-tolerant plants such as heathers. Most outdoor plants in the UK fall within the range H4, {{convert|-10|to|-5|C|F|abbr=on}} (hardy in the average winter) to H5, {{convert|-15|to|-10|C|F|abbr=on}} (hardy in a cold winter). Also, the average minimum temperature in the UK is much warmer than the average minimums in most of the US  (see [[Hardiness Zone]] ).  This means that the coldest areas in the UK would be considered USDA Zone 7, plants considered 'Fully Hardy' in the UK may not be hardy below Zone 7 in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/ukmapavge.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230185431/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/ukmapavge.html |archivedate=2010-12-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to cold tolerance, plant hardiness has been observed to be linked to how much stress specific plants are undergoing into the winter, or even how fast the onset of cold weather is in a specific year.  This means that often stressed plants will exhibit less cold tolerance than plants that have been well maintained.  Plants may also die if the winter changes from balmy to exceptionally cold in a short period of time.

'''Humayun Azad''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Humayun Azad from Bangladesh pronunciation (Voice of America).ogg|lang}}; 28 April 1947{{snd}}12 August 2004) was a Bangladeshi author, poet, scholar and linguist. He wrote more than seventy titles. His writings against Bangladeshi society-system received both positive and negative reviews. He was threatened and attacked by Islamist fundamentalist groups for his writings.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3561184.stm|title=Top Bangladeshi author found dead|date=2004-08-13|publisher=BBC|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azad was awarded the [[Bangla Academy Literary Award]] in 1986 for his contributions to  Bengali linguistics. In 2012, the [[Government of Bangladesh]] honored him with [[Ekushey Padak]] posthumously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=20 February 2012|title=15 personalities receive Ekushey Padak|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2012/02/20/15-personalities-receive-ekushey-padak|newspaper=bdnews24.com|access-date=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Azad was born as Humayun Kabir in Rarhikhal village in [[Birampur Upazila|Bikrampur]], [[Munshiganj]] on 28 April 1947.&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Sirajul |year=2012 |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]|chapter=Azad, Humayun|chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Azad,_Humayun|editor2-first=Muhammad |editor2-last=Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable scientist [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] was born in the same village.&lt;ref name=truncated/&gt; He passed the secondary examination from Sir Jagadish Chandra Basu Institute in 1962 and higher secondary examination from [[Dhaka College]] in 1964. He earned BA and MA degrees in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] language and literature from the [[University of Dhaka]] in 1967 and 1968 respectively. He obtained his PhD in [[linguistics]] submitting his thesis titled "Pronominalisation in Bangla" from the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt;&lt;ref name=truncated/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H.|first=Kabir,|date=1976|title=Pronominalization in Bengali|url=http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=1&amp;uin=uk.bl.ethos.653172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Azad changed his surname from Kabir to Azad on 28 September 1988 by the magistrate of [[Narayanganj District]].&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt;

==Career==
Azad started his career in 1969 by joining the [[Chittagong College]]. He joined [[University of Chittagong]] as a lecturer on 11 February 1970 and [[Jahangirnagar University]] in 1972. He was appointed as associate professor of Bengali at the University of Dhaka on 1 November 1978 and got promoted to the post of professor in 1986.&lt;ref name=bpedia/&gt;

==Literary works==
Towards the end of the 1980s, he started to write newspaper column focusing on contemporary sociopolitical issues. His commentaries continued throughout the 1990s and were later published as books as they grew in numbers. Through his writings of the 1990s, he established himself as a freethinker and appeared to be an agnostic. In his works, he openly criticized [[Islamic extremism]], as well as the conservative society-system of Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntvbd.com/arts-and-literature/17418/%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%AA%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A8-%E0%A6%9B%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%B8%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%95%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%AF%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%82%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B6--%E0%A6%AE%E0%A7%8C%E0%A6%B2%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%A6|title=বাবার স্বপ্ন ছিল সেক্যুলার বাংলাদেশ : মৌলি আজাদ|website=ntvbd.com|date=12 August 2015|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2016/02/28/humayun-azad-case-trial-in-limbo-12-years-on|title=Humayun Azad case trial in limbo 12 years on|website=[[Bdnews24.com]]|date=28 February 2016|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Azad published the first comprehensive feminist book in Bengali titled ''[[Naree|Naari]]'' (''Woman''). ''Naari'' received positive reviews as a literary work and earned Azad popularity as an author. In this work Azad painstakingly compiled the feminist ideas of the West that underlie the feminist contributions of the subcontinent's socio-political reformers and drew attention to the anti-women attitude of some acclaimed [[Bengali writers]] including [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. The work, critical of the patriarchal and male-chauvinistic attitude of religion towards women, attracted negative reaction from the conservatives. The Government of Bangladesh banned the book in 1995. The ban was eventually lifted in 2000, following a legal battle that Azad won in the [[Supreme Court of Bangladesh|High Court]] of the country.

==Assassination attempt==
On 27 February 2004, near the campus of the University of Dhaka during the annual [[Bangla Academy]] book fair, two assailants, armed with chopping knives, hacked Azad several times on the jaw, lower part of the neck and hands.&lt;ref name=truncated/&gt; Azad was taken to the nearby [[Dhaka Medical College and Hospital]]. He was then sent to the [[Combined Military Hospital (Dhaka)|Combined Military Hospital (CMH)]] and later to [[Bumrungrad International Hospital]] in Thailand where he recovered.&lt;ref name=truncated/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2004/03/07/d40307011212.htm|title=Azad's Health : Family blasts Disinformation|newspaper=The Daily Star|date=2004-03-07|access-date=2017-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azad had been fearing for his life ever since excerpts of his new novel, ''[[Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad]]'' (Pakistan's national anthem; ''Blessed be the Sacred Land'') were first published in ''[[The Daily Ittefaq]]''{{'}}s Eid supplement in 2003. In that write-up, he tried to expose the politics and ideology of Islamic fundamentalists of Bangladesh. After that book had been published, he started receiving various threats from the fundamentalists.  In an email to [[Avijit Roy|Mukto-mona]], a website for secularists and liberals, where he was then a member, Azad wrote:

{{quote|text=The Ittefaq published a novel by me named ''Pak Sar Jamin Saad Baad'' in its Eid issue on December 3. It deals with the condition of Bangladesh for the last two years. Now the (religious) fundamentalists are bringing out regular processions against me, demanding exemplary punishment.

A week prior to Azad's assault, [[Delwar Hossain Sayeedi]], one of the renowned religious leaders of Bangladesh demanded, in the parliament, that Azad's political satire ''Pak Sar Jamin Sad Bad'' would be banned and demanded the introduction of the Blasphemy Act on the author.&lt;ref name=truncated/&gt; In 2006, the commander of [[Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh|Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB)]] admitted to the [[Rapid Action Battalion|RAB]] interrogators that his operatives carried out the attack on writer Azad, as well as two other murders, bomb blasts, and attacks on cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=5 June 2006 |title=JMB also killed writer of Tangail |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/2006/06/05/d6060501128.htm |newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 12 August 2004, Azad was found dead in his apartment in [[Munich]], Germany, where he had arrived a week earlier to conduct research on the nineteenth century German romantic poet [[Heinrich Heine]], several months after the Islamists' machete attack on him at a book fair, which had left him grievously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Humayun Azad found dead in Munich|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2004/08/14/d4081401011.htm|newspaper=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]]|date=14 August 2004 |accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family demanded an investigation, alleging that the extremists who had attempted the earlier assassination had a role in this death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=12 August 2009|title=Proper probe into death of Humayun Azad demanded|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=101061|newspaper=The Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; While alive, Azad had expressed his wish to donate his body to medical college after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2004/08/14/d4081401011.htm|title=Humayun Azad found dead in Munich|last=Staff Correspondent|first=|date=|website=The Daily Star Web Edition Vol. 5 Num 79|publisher=The Daily Star|access-date=2016-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; But he was buried in Rarhikhal, his village home in Bangladesh as doctors denied to take his body for medical research, as several days had passed to reach his body to Bangladesh from Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ntvbd.com/arts-and-literature/17369/হুমায়ুন-আজাদ-ভেতর-বাহিরে|title=হুমায়ুন আজাদ, ভেতর-বাহিরে|access-date=2016-09-07|date=2015-08-12|publisher=ntvbd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Azad married his Dhaka University class-mate Latifa Kohinoor on 12 October 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/2004/02/28/d4022801011.htm|title=Humayun Azad stabbed, fighting for life|website=thedailystar.net|date=February 28, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=truncated/&gt; They lived in Scotland for an year before they returned to Dhaka.

An '''inkometer''' is a specialized [[measuring instrument]] used by the [[printing]] industry to measure the "tack" ([[adhesive]]ness) of an ink with the roller system on an offset press. The importance of tack is that it is not so excessive that it doesn't allow effective transfer from the rollers to the plate and then to the blanket and onto the substrate being printed.  Inks can also be tack "graded" in descending sequence to allow for better trapping of one color over another.  Inks with too much tack can cause the surface of the paper to pick off and interfere with transfer on subsequent printing units and copies.

The amount of tack can be controlled by changing the amount of [[solvent]] or other diluent used in the ink.  

The inkometer is made up of three rollers.  The center roller is a temperature controlled brass roller, the bottom roller is an oscillating rubber distribution roller.  The top roller is attached to a load cell which measures the tack at a given press speed (i.e. 800 feet per minute for a web press or 15000 sheets per hour for an offset press)

'''Iñapari''' is a critically endangered indigenous South American language spoken by just four people in [[Perú]] along the [[Las Piedras River (Peru)|Las Piedras]] river near the mouth of the Sabaluyoq river. The language is already extinct in neighboring [[Bolivia]]. All four remaining speakers are bilingual in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and none have any children, which will likely lead to its extinction once the speakers die. The Iñapari language currently has a published dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_work.asp?id=36668 Datos de la lengua Iñapari.] Parker, Stephen G., compiler. 1995.

International Journal of American Linguistics 65: 1-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pacaguara (Pacahuara) dialect described by Mercier was at least ethnically distinct.  (But see [[Pacaguara language]].)

'''Jagannath Prasad Das'''(J.P.) (born 26 April 1936) is an eminent litterateur from [[Odisha]] who has dominated the [[Odia language|Odia]] literary scene for over forty years. His literary oeuvre comprise poetry, plays, short stories, novel, essays, children’s poems and nonsense verse. He has done translations of literary works from different languages into Odia and English. He has done extensive research into Odishan art and has published three works on the pictorial arts of the state. He has also done paintings, acted on stage and in films, and taken an active part in social and cultural movements. His writings have been widely translated into Hindi, English and other Indian languages, bringing him national recognition. He has been honoured with awards for his writings, the important ones being the Central [[Sahitya Akademi]] award for his poetry (which he refused), the  [http://nandikar.net Nandikar Award] for plays, the Sarala Award for short stories and the [http://www.kkbirlafoundation.org/saraswati-r.html Saraswati Samman] for his poetry. He has been connected with literary, cultural, and charitable organisations and has been member/office holder of these bodies.

Starting his career with a brief teaching assignment as Assistant Professor in the [[University of Allahabad]], he joined the [[Indian Administrative Service]] and had held many important positions in the Government of Odisha and the Central Government. He has chosen to settle down in Delhi after taking premature retirement from Government service and is a well-known  figure in the cultural and social life of the city where he lives.

It would come as no surprise that Prof.Sumanyu Satpathy has titled a short biographical piece he has written on him '''The Artist as Polumetis''', the Greek term meaning ''many-mindedness''.

== Early life ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
J.P.Das was born on 26 April 1936 to Shridhar Das and Indu Devi at Banpur in the Puri District of Odisha. His father Shridhar Das, an eminent literatteur, was then teaching at the Banpur High School. Banpur is a village and Das studied in the local ‘vernacular’ school. Shridhar moved to Cuttack as Professor in the Christ College there and the family moved there in 1948. J P enrolled in the Mission School (later called the Christ Collegiate School) and passed the matriculation examination from there (1951). He did his Intermediate in Arts from the Christ College (1953) and Bachelor of Arts (Honours) from Ravenshaw College, Cuttack (1955). He was a good student and secured high ranks in all the examinations. He moved to  Allahabad to do his Master of Arts in Political Science which he passed in 1957 topping the list of successful candidates.

== Early Writing ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
J.P. Das started writing poetry from his school days and one of his earliest poems was published in the reputed Odia literary journal '''Kumkum''' in 1949 when he was thirteen years old. He regularly contributed to Odia literary journals and shared space with many literary luminaries of the time. In 1951, he brought out a collection of 39 of his poems titled '''Stabaka''' (meaning 'Bouquet', published by Odisha Publishing House, Cuttack, priced four annas. He continued writing poetry and was considered a major young voice in Odia poetry. However, he stopped writing when he moved to Allahabad. His next collection of poems was to appear only in 1971.

JP has not included these early poems in his later anthologies considering them juvenilia. However, many readers of his early poems still remember the words of those poems and feel that they should not be excluded from the corpus of his poems.

== Service career ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
J P Das joined the IAS in 1958 and was allotted the Odisha cadre. His earliest posting was to Rourkella as Subdivisional Officer. He thereafter worked in several Departments of Government of Odisha, and was Secretary of the Departments of Works and Transport, Industries, and Finance at different times. In 1973, he was deputed to the Central Government in Delhi and worked in the Commerce and the Finance Ministries. In 1976, he did his M.Phil in the Indian Institute of Public Administration, and took a [[Homi Bhabha fellowship]] to research. After completing the fellowship, he joined as the Resident Commissioner of the Government of Odisha at Delhi from which post he took premature retirement in 1984.

J P is on record saying that of the years he spent in Government service, he considers the three years he spent in Kalahandi district of Odisha as Collector and District Magistrate as the most rewarding and fulfilling of his career.

== Kalahandi ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
J P Das was posted to [[Kalahandi]] in 1963, when the district was one of the most backward ones having a substantial tribal population and lacking in basic facilities. The district faced severe drought in 1965, which necessitated tremendous efforts by the administration to provide relief to ameliorate the condition of the famine-stricken population. He has written about the problems he had faced when he stopped the export of food grains outside the district, though his order was rescinded by the Government. The authorities had to permit import rice at a later date. J P Das has written a poem on Kalahandi, which has gained an almost classic status.

== Poetry==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
J.P.Das considers poetry his first love. He is also on record saying: ''All that I want to say, let me say in poetry''. Writing poems from an early age, he published his first collection of poems in 1951, which he later called immatured. His next collection '''Prathama Purusha''' came out after a twenty-year hiatus in 1971 and made a great impact on the Odia poetry scene. The poems were hailed as free from the existing trends in poetry and received rave reviews. Translation of the collection soon followed and was equally well-received. [[Mulk Raj Anand]] called the translated poems in First Person ''authentic poetic expression in new metaphor''. Of the Urdu translation, a review said: ''Das’s sensibility is easily comparable with that of Faiz in Urdu''.

Given below are some comments on his poetry at different times.

- ''If contemporary Odia poetry has acquired a new dimension and sophistication in terms of vision, technical integrity and innovative use of the creative medium, it was because of J.P.Das's contribution.'' {{pad|4.0em}} - [[Kavya Bharati]],1997

- ''An unusual blending of the sense of beauty and the sense of joy in living and loving makes his poetry extremely readable and accessible. His passion for the diverse facets of life and existence makes his poetry vibrant and rejuvenating. The sense of rhythm that he tries to capture in his poetry is very close to the colloquial speech.''{{pad|4.0em}}-[[Kavya Bharati]], Madurai, Issue 13, 2001

- ''J.P.Das's collection of poems] is authentic poetic expressions in new metaphors.'' {{pad|4.0em}} - [[Mulk Raj Anand]]

- ''There is no self-indulgent practicing here; form and language suggest a strong, mature personality.'' {{pad|4.0em}} - Nissim Ezekiel

- ''His poetry is universal as true poetry should be and ranks with some of the best in any language.'' {{pad|4.0em}}  - Vassilis Vitsaxis

- ''The world that J.P.Das creates is both magical and historical, lost and redeemed.'' {{pad|4.0em}} - Mary O'Connor

- ''J.P.Das's is a poetry of concern, of dread and angst in a world growing darker day by day...its virtues are to be sought in its moral earnestness and its faithfulness to the gruesome reality of our times of torment.'' {{pad|4.0em}} - [[K. Satchidanandan]]

== Painting==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
J.P.Das held the first (and only) exhibition of sixteen of his paintings in 1971 at Bhubaneswar.  His formal training in Art was joining the diploma course of fine arts at the Allahabad University, which he could not finish.

Though painted by an amateur Sunday artist, the paintings got some good reviews. Dr. [[Dinanath Pathy]] wrote:  ''It is not necessary that one should go through a training course in fine arts to make a good artist….All the sixteen canvases on display were marked with a freshness and individuality, which clearly indicated a good artist in the making…..With his vision and sincerity, he will one day establish himself one day as a true artist.'' Prof. [[Inam Ansari]], another reviewer wrote: ''Given time and maturity, Das is sure to succeed and prove a worthy member of the artist fraternity''.

But this was not to be, for Das stopped this creative activity and thus ended the short period of his career as visual artist.

==Short stories==

{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
J.P.Das wrote his first short-story in 1980, many years after publishing poetry. His very first short-story attracted attention for the novelty of its theme as well as for the use of a new style and language for Odia fiction. Since then, he has alternated between poetry and prose and given both equal attention.

He is now as much known as a fiction writer as a poet, and his collection of short stories has been awarded the prestigious Sarala Award. Many of his short stories have been produced as television films.

Given below are some appreciations of his short stories:

- ''His stories draw a map of India whereby seemingly incontestable categories, widely accepted beliefs and traditions associated with the national identity collapse…. The stories gain a deeper, unstated meaning as they provide an acid critique of a country largely transformed under the pressures of globalization…. J.P.Das’s characters re-validate the assertion that the authentic re-appropriation of one’s cultural space remains by and large one of the most critical unfinished agendas of our time.'' {{pad|4.0em}} - Mauricio D. Aguilera Linde

- ''J.P.Das is the quintessential raconteur with an instinctive mastery of form.''  {{pad|4.0em}} - The Hindu

- ''J.P.Das’s stories begin with clinical and detached descriptions…but at some point, imperceptively, the mood changes and we find ourselves in an uncharted territory, where shadows of unresolved mysteries darken the surface of quotidian life.''  {{pad|4.0em}} - Meenakshi Mukherjee

- ''Epiphanies and liquid perceptions are subtly phased into one another, characters and situations multiply and recreate themselves and mature as the whole seems to be spawned by an intelligent camera.'' {{pad|4.0em}} - The Book Review

- ''A feature of J.P.Das’s stories is the slow, deliberate accretion of detail that seems calculated to make the reader breathless and impatient, driving him on to the inevitable climax, which provides a sense of relief as well as disbelief.''  {{pad|4.0em}} - Bikram  K. Das

- ''He occupies a special place in the history of the Odia short story, having helped to modernise it by expanding its horizon and by his unusual angles of approach….JP is one among the few living contemporary Odia writers who is astute in mapping the relations between writing and social power as they obtain in a provincial milieu.'' {{pad|2.0em}} - Himansu S. Mohapatra

== Drama==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}

J.P.Das wrote two short plays in 1960 and then wrote his first full-length play  ''Suryasta Purbaru'' (translated into English as ''Before the Sunset'') in 1971. This play was staged in a Bengali version in Kolkata the next year, even before it was staged in [[Odia language|Odia]] in Odisha. In 1976, the Hindi version was performed in Delhi directed by the eminent theatre personality [[Ram Gopal Bajaj]]. [[Om Puri]] played the role of the protagonist Deepankar in the play. The play has since been translated into many other languages and staged in different parts of the country giving it the status of a classic. It is included in the volume ''Modern Indian Plays'' published by the [[National School of Drama]].

His second play ''Saba Shesha Loka''  (translated into English as [''The Underdogs'']) was also produced in the Hindi version first, directed by eminent theatre and film personality [[Ravi Baswani]]. Thespian  [[Pankaj Kapoor]] essayed the important role of Ram/Shyam in the play.

A subsequent play of his, ''Sundardas'', was staged by the Department of Art and Aesthetics of the [[Jawaharlal Nehru University]] directed by the renowned playwright and theatre-person [[H.S.Shiva Prakash]].  It was also staged under the auspices of Indira Gandhi National Centre of Arts.

JP Das has been closely associated with the new theatre movement in Odisha and is a founder trustee of the [[Utkal Rangamanch Trust]], Bhubaneswar. He has been an office-bearer of [[Bharatiya Natya Sangh]], the Indian branch of International Theatre. He was the Vice-chairman of [[National School of Drama]]. He has been honoured with Nandikar Theatre Award  [http://nandikar.net Nandikar Award], Kolkata as an eminent playwright.

He has done some acting on stage too; mention may be made of his role as father in his own play ''Made for Each Other'' and as Fateh Muhammad in Manoranjan Das’s play ''Buxi Jagabandhu''.

Below are given some comments on J.P.Das’s plays:

- ''J.P.Das is a versatile writer and his plays are literary works at their best. It is hoped that these works of an important Indian playwright will delight both readers and theatre-persons. {{pad|2.0em}} - Nirmal KantiBhattachraje (in his Introduction to ''Complete Plays'' by J.P.Das)

- ''J.P.Das has now secured his place among the leading playwrights of the country.''  {{pad|4.0em}} -Enact

- ''J.P.Das is a poet turned playwright and his poetic sensitivity, compassion and perspective inform his plays. He leaves many things to the imagination of the audience or gives only suggestions, as a poet would. But he does succeed in saying many things with a minimum of words.'' {{pad|4.0em}} -J.N.Kaushal

- ''Sundardas is a significant addition to Indian dramatic literature. The play is an insightful treatment of the politics of conversion.'' {{pad|4.0em}} - H.S.Shivaprakash

== Association with Films ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
J.P.Das has been closely associated with cinema, having been an active member of the Bhubaneswar and Delhi Film Societies. He has been on the Boards of [[Orissa Film Development Corporation]] and the [[Children’s Film Society, India]]. [http://cfsindia.org CFSI]. He was Chairman of the International Jury of Children’s Film Awards of the international organisation CIFEJ in 1985.

He was a Member of the International Children’s Film Awards Jury, 1989. He was a Member of the Jury of [[National Film Awards]] in the years 1985, 1988 and 1990. He was a Member of the Film Review Committee of the Ministry of Health and Family Planning during 2001-2003.

He was instrumental in organizing the International Children’s Film Festival in Bhubaneswar in 1987. He has edited a volume ''Films for Children'' published by Vikas Publishing House. He has acted in telefilm [[Sunaina]] directed by S.N.Dhir and in the tele-serial [[Panchhi]] directed by [[Ravi Baswani]]. Many of his short stories have been made into telefilms.

== Novel ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}

===''Desha Kala Patra'' (''A Time Elsewhere'')===

J.P.Das has written one historical novel, a fictional account of Odisha in the second half of the 19th century. In its six hundred pages, it gives a panoramic picture of the political, social, cultural and literary history of the State of Odisha. Published in 1992, it has already got into several editions and has gained the status of a literary classic.

The book was chosen for translation into all Indian languages by the [[National Book Trust]] under their Aadaan Pradaan scheme, and it has been translated into Hindi, Bengali and English. A film project based on the book is under way.

In his translator’s note to the English translation ''A Time Elsewhere'', published by [[Penguin Books]],  Prof. Jatindra K. Nayak  has the following to say about the book: ''It tells the story of the transformation of a traditional society under the impact of colonial rule....it seeks to construct an alternate narrative in which the colonised is not content to be only written about; he is seen as shaping his own destiny.'' [http://www.museindia.com/focuscontent.asp?issid=34&amp;id=2294 muse India]

==Translations and Editing==
Besides translating some of his own work in Odia into English, he has also translated other works in different languages into both Odia and English. He has translated ''Odia Women Poets’ Work'' into English (with Arlene Zide), [[Catherine Clement]]’s poems from French into English (with the poet), [[Gulzar]]’s poems from Urdu into English, Swedish poet [[Werner Aspenstrom]]’s poems into Odia,  a medieval Odia text ''Lakshmipurana'' into English and the poetry of Odia Dalit poet Basudev Sunani into English.

He edited the first ever anthology of Odia Short Stories in English translation. He has edited an anthology of poetry from different Indian languages ( with [[K.Satchidanandan]]), and a volume of essays, Films for Children.

* Emeritus Fellow of the Ministry of Culture, Government of India (1994-1996)

==Awards==

* Sarala Award  - 1998 (for ''Priya Vidushaka'') 
* Nandikar Playwright Award - 2000
* Saraswati Samman - 2006 (for ''Parikrama'')

==Research Work==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
Though Odisha temple sculpture and architecture has been studied by scholars for a long time, no such study had been done of the rich tradition of pictorial arts of Odisha. This shortcoming was made good with the publication of J.P.Das’s ''Puri Paintings: The Chitrakara and His Work'' (Arnold-Heinemann, New Delhi and Humanities Press, New Jersey, USA) in 1982. It was the first book on the distinctive Pata style of painting of Odisha and received rave reviews on its publication.

Dr. Eberhard Fischer had the following to say in his review of the book in Artibus Asiae, 2/3 1983: ''This book is an important contribution to our knowledge of traditional painters’ role and of Orissa’s  rich artistic heritage…. The text is well-written, scholarly and clear. The author, a well-known poet and an administrator, deserves high praise for his direct and unpretentious presentation. J.P.Das, also an amateur painter, has been acquainted since his childhood with traditional Orissan paintings and as a young IAS officer was involved in Handicraft Programmes of the Orissan Government. For his thesis, he lived and worked mainly in Raghurajpur near Puri, observed the painters’ way of life and their working techniques, and conducted interviews. Furthermore, he obtained records from the Puri Temple Administration Office, and searched for relevant Civil Court records of Puri and for documents from the American Friends Service Organisation. He finally visited museums, mainly in Calcutta and London, studying their collections of Pata paintings to form his own ideas about historic questions…..What I enjoyed most when reading this important publication is the clear diction and the well-organised layout. J.P.Das is on the whole unprejudiced as a historian and yet critical in all questions concerning general assumptions.''

Miloslav Krasa, reviewing the book in Archiv Orientalni 54, 1986, wrote: ''This study is a basic and valuable contribution to a long-neglected subject, filling yet another lacuna in our knowledge of the social and cultural history of Orissa.''

''Puri Paintings'' has helped in promoting this painting style in India and abroad and has gained respect and recognition of the painters.

J P Das followed up this book with two other books on the pictorial arts of Orissa: [[Chitra-Pothi]]: Illustrated Palm-leaf Manuscripts from  Orissa ( [[Arnold-Heinemann]], New Delhi and  Lotus Press, London, 1985) and ''Palm-leaf Miniatures: The Art of Raghunath Prusty of Orissa'' (Abhinav Publications, New Delhi,1991). The first of these books is about the art of illuminating kavya texts from medieval Odia literature on palm-leaves. The second book, written in collaboration with Prof. Joanna Williams of the [[University of Berkeley]], California, is about one such palm-leaf artist, Raghunath Prusty who lived in the second half of the nineteenth century. Both books were highly appreciated and well- reviewed. Prof. Pratapaditya Pal wrote in [[Marg (magazine)|Marg]] ( Vol.49 No.3 March 1998) : ''The recent research and publications by at least two enthusiasts, among others, will redress the balance [neglect of study of Orissan painting] and Orissan Painting will receive the attention it deserves. The scholars are J.P.Das of India and Joanna Williams of the United States''

==Children’s/Nonsense Verses==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2016}}
During a period of illness in 1991 J.P.Das wrote some nonsense verses as also some poems for children which were published in 1993 in two books under the titles ''Alimalika'' (Publications Division, New Delhi)and ''Alukuchi-Malukuchi'' (Lark Books, Bhubaneswar).  Both titles mean ‘odds and ends’ in Odia. Children’s and nonsense writing are rather neglected in Odia and the two books e hence were a pleasant addition to this genre of writing in Odia literature. J P Das himself translated some of the poems from these two books into English and published ''Alimalika: Children’s Nonsense Rhymes'' ([[Writers Workshop]], Calcutta, 2004). In 2008, he published another such collection under the title ''Anabana'' – also meaning ‘odds and ends’ in Odia – (Ink Odisha, Bhubaneswar). Another similar collection by him, written during another period of illness, ''Aanamaana'' was published in 2015.

'''Kho'ini''' (alternatives: '''Xoini''', '''Xo'ini''', '''Khoeini''', or '''Di''') is a [[Tati (Iran)|Tatic]] [[dialect]] or [[language]] spoken in northwestern [[Iran]], and is one of many [[Western Iranian languages]].  It is spoken in the village of [[Xoin]] and surrounding areas, about {{convert|60|km}} southwest of [[Zanjan, Iran|Zanjan]] city in northern Iran.  The Xoini verbal system follows the general pattern found in other Tati dialects. However, the dialect has its own special characteristics such as [[continuous present]] which is formed by the past stem, a preverb shift, and the use of connective sounds. The dialect is in danger of [[language death|extinction]].

== Kho'in ==

'''Kho'in''' ({{lang-fa|خوئین}}), also spelled as ''Xo'in'' an ''Khoein'', is located in "Ejarud" rural district of [[Zanjan Province]] at the end of a long valley. In recent decades the village has lost its centrality because of veering the road of Zanjan to [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]] from Xoin. In 1960, the farmers was growing fruits around on the slopes of the hills, but Xoin's [[Qanat]]s were neglected; many of the houses deteriorated already and a number of inhabitants had been migrating to [[Tehran]] seeking works. The population was 800 to 900 at the time and declining.

There has been a sense of nostalgia about the better days of Xo'in among the dwellers. Local beliefs hold that in the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] period some Xoinis emigrated to [[Merv]], [[Ashgabat]] and [[Baku]]. There is a cavernous dent called "Dei-manda", meaning, "remnant of a fort" (known in other parts of Iran as "Qaleh Gabri/Gowri"), said to have been made by [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]s. Some villagers legendarily believed that Xoinis had earlier been [[Gabr|Gowr]]. They gave credence to being originally from [[Sistan]]. Some said when [[Kai Bahman|Bahman]] invaded Sistan to avenge his father, [[Esfandiyar]], the descendants of [[Rostam]] fled and came to Xoin. In spite of dwindling estate, the village has 8 maintained [[mosque]]s and a [[Tekyeh]].

== Geography ==

[[Azerbaijani language|Azeri Turkic]] has mostly replaced Xoini, however in the 1960s, the extent of the dialect was as follows:

*'''Sipkamar''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: "Sefidkamar")''':''' It is a village to the west of Xoin. The dialect was best preserved there. It had some 70 households in 1963. Sefidkamar has been more flourishing than Xoin. The access road is rather doubly arduous and limits communications, which may have been instrumental in the dialect's survival.
*'''Xoin:''' Azerbaijani language is the predominant language and the indigenous dialect was fading away in 1960 and might be extinct by now. In '''Aruz Mâla''', the northern quarter of Xoin, the dialect is somewhat better known than in '''Aš Mâla''', the southern quarter, where almost no one knows the language any longer.
*'''Sa'idabad:''' In its lower quarter, they speak mostly the dialect.
*'''Garne:''' A couple of kilometers from Xoin. The people speak the dialect.
*'''Sura:''' A village to the east of Xoin, which had some 250 inhabitants. Some knew the dialect.
*'''Balubin''' (Persian: "Balbavin")''':''' The dialect is spoken side by side with Turkic.
*'''Halab:''' The language had practically disappeared, being replaced by Azerbaijani. Just one old man could remember a few sentences in 1960.

== Phonology ==

Some sounds are approximate. Some of the vowels like "e, â, o, u" and "i" show variations.

|x || style="text-align: justify;"| In a number of words it is followed by a weak /w/ or /u/ without making any changes in the syllabic count of the word.

In Xoini, [[vowel harmony]], [[gemination]] and [[Length (phonetics)|lengthening]] more or less occurs.

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns and adjectives ===

Nouns have two cases: [[Object (grammar)#Types of object|direct]] and oblique. Contrary to the often case in Persian, adjective is not [[Post-positive adjective|Post-positive]]. The formation of different kinds of nouns and adjectives and their order are as follows:

|-
|}
&lt;br/&gt;
The [[possessive pronoun]]s are also used with both [[preposition and postposition]], e.g.:
*''a:râ buri čeman ku pül ar-gi'' (tomorrow come (and) take money from me). ''čeman ku'' means "from me"
*''de man panir a-čman xarat-(e)š-e'' (he sold two maunds of cheese to me). ''a-čman'' means "to me"

They are acted as possessive adjectives too:
*''čeman da:s-em begi'' (take my hand). Note that the pronoun is repeated by the [[clitic]] ''-em''.
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;

|-

&lt;br/&gt;
For example:
*''čia ku'' (from this),
*''čâ ku'' (from that).

They serve also as adjectives:
*''čiân/čân daste begi'' (take these/those ones' hands)
*''čie/čâ daste begi'' (take this/that one's hand)

Possession is also expressed by adding suffixes to nouns. These are added after inflection for number. See the "Person Suffixes" table below.

Reflexive pronoun: ''geg''.  But it is treated as a noun in terms of declension, e.g.:
*''mâ a gege-mân viar seg-mân či'' (we piled stones in front of ourselves).

=== Verbs ===

The verbal system follows the general pattern found in other Tati dialects. It employs:
* A present and a past stem
* Personal suffixes
* [[preverb]]s: â-, (âje-), ar-, baʋ-/ʋaʋ-, bay/ʋay-, či-, da(r)-, dari-, pa(r)-, &lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;ut-
* Negative Marker: ne-
* Prohibitive Marker: ma-
* Subjunctive/Imperative prefix: be-
* Imperfective: -in-/-en-/-m-
* Insistence, necessity, volition: pi-; e.g.: ''te pi niši'' (you must not go)
* Desire, need: pi-sta-; e.g.: ''pist-am/pista-r-im bešum'' (I want to go)

However, the main exceptional characteristics of Xoini are:
#Continuous present is made by the past stem;
#The preverbs shift their positions depending on tense and mood;
#The use of a connective sound is frequent. It is generally -r- and sometimes -y-, when the vowels of the different elements of a verb come into contact. For example: ''mesar te nâza-&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;-â-m-bim'' (this year you will become well).
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;div style="clear:both" &gt;&lt;/div&gt;
{| border="1" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" style="border:1px solid #aaa; border-collapse:collapse; text-align: center;"
|- bgcolor="#ADD8E6"
! colspan="3" | '''Person Suffixes'''
|-
!Person
!Singular
!Plural
|-
|1st ||  -(e)m ||  -mân
|-
|2nd ||  -i (-y after a vowel) ||  -yân
|-
|3rd ||  -(e)š ||  -(e)šân
|-
|}
&lt;br/&gt;
The above suffixes serve as:
# Possessives, e.g.: ''berâ-&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; âmi'' (My brother came).
# Agents of past transitive verbs in an [[Ergative case|ergative]] construction, e.g.: ''te ow-&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; ente'' (You drank water).
# Objects, direct or indirect, e.g.: ''ü seg-&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;ešân&lt;/span&gt; p(e)tow-šân kay'' (They threw a stone).

The suffixes may be attached to the verb; the agent of the verb in an ergative construction; an adverb; a prepositional or postpositional phrase; and in a [[compound verb]] to its [[nominal (linguistics)|nominal]] [[Complement (linguistics)|Complement]].

The same set of endings is used for the present and the subjunctive. The endings of the preterit and the present perfect are basically the enclitic present forms of the verb 'to be' (''*ah-'', here called base one). For pluperfect and subjunctive perfect the freestanding auxiliary verb 'to be' (''*bav-'', here called base two) is utilized. There is no ending for singular imperative and it is ''-ân'' for plural. For the inflections of "to be" see "Auxiliary inflection" below.

==== Conjugations ====

===== Stems and imperative mood =====

The past and present stems are irregular and shaped by historical developments, e.g.: ''&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;uj- / &lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;ut-'' (to say); xaraš-/xarat- (to sell); ''taj-/tat-'' (to run). However, in many verbs the past stem is built on the present stem by adding ''-(e)st''; e.g.: ''brem-'' → ''brem&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;est&lt;/span&gt;-'' (to weep).

The imperative is formed by the modal prefix ''be-'' if the verb contains no preverb, plus the present stem and without ending in the singular and with ''-ân'' in the plural. ''be-'' is often changed to ''bi-, bo- or bu-'' according to the situation, and appears as ''b-'' before a vowel of a verbal stem.

===== Auxiliary inflection =====
The conjugation of the verb 'to be' uses two different bases; historically one from the root ''*ah-'' and the other from the root ''*bav-''.

|Infinitive || '''-''' || be || '''-'''

|-
|Indicative || Present || im, iš, e; âm, ân, end || style="text-align: justify;"| After ''e'' and ''â'', the ''e'' of the 3rd person singular changes to ''y''. e.g. ''te-yš'' (you are (sing.))

&lt;br/&gt;
The present from the root ''*bav-'' is the present of "to become" which is from the same root with the addition of the preverb ''â-'' and the imperfective prefix ''(e)m-'', thus: ''â-m-bum, â-m-bin, â-m-buk; â-m-biâm, â-m-biân â-m-bend'' (I become, you become, etc.). So it doesn't mean "to be".

There is another form, ''hest-'' which occurs in the sense of "to be, to exist": ''hest-im, hest-iš, hest-e; hest-im, hest-iân, hest-end''.

== Turkic influence ==

Xoini has been impacted by [[Azerbaijani language|Turkic Azeri]] to some extent. That includes borrowing a number of verbal forms, for example: ''-miš'' which is attached to the past stem of some verbs to form a verbal noun, e.g., ''&lt;sup&gt;w&lt;/sup&gt;ut-miš'' (saying). The postposition, ''-da'' (from) seems to be Turkic. There exist also a number words e.g.: ''düz'' (straight, right).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">'''''La Santa''''' is a secret society within the ''[['Ndrangheta]]'', a [[criminal organisation]] in [[Calabria]] ([[Italy]]). The name probably derives from the shortening of ''[[mamma santissima]]''.&lt;ref name=paoli114&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', pp. 114-16&lt;/ref&gt; In mafia slang, the expression is used to refer to mafia chiefs. ''Mamma santissima'' literally means "most holy mother" and refers to the [[Virgin Mary]], who is regarded as the protector of the 'Ndrangheta.&lt;ref name=paoli238&gt;Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'', p. 238&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Santa was an innovation in the traditional [[social stratification|stratification]] of the 'Ndrangheta introduced in the early 1970s to maximize the power and invisibility of the most important bosses.&lt;ref name=paoli114/&gt; Security concerns led to the creation of a secret society within the secret society. Membership in the ''Santa'' is only known to other members. Contrary to the 'Ndrangheta code, it allowed bosses to establish close connections with state representatives, even to the extent that some were affiliated with the ''Santa''. These connections were often established through the [[Freemasonry]], which the ''santisti'' – breaking another rule of the traditional code – were allowed to join.&lt;ref name=paoli114/&gt;&lt;ref name=paoli&gt;[http://www.organized-crime.de/revpao01mafiandrangheta.htm Review of: Paoli, ''Mafia Brotherhoods'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The rank of ''santista'' was established at the end of the 1960s by [[Girolamo Piromalli]], leader of the Piromalli family in [[Gioia Tauro]], and by the chiefs of several other families. They were eager to modify the traditional rules of the 'Ndrangheta  in order to enter the public works market and start illegal activities such as drug [[trafficking]], which were prohibited by the 'Ndrangheta’s traditional code but promised to be very profitable. According to [[Gaetano Costa]] (the former boss of the Messina [['ndrina]]), "it was Mommo Piromalli who – given the enormous interests which the existed in the [[Reggio Calabria]] area (the railroad stump, the steelwork centre, and the port in Gioia Tauro, etc.) – entrusted himself with the rank of ''santista'', in order to assert his higher authority and hence directly control the public works. He said that this rank had been given him directly in Toronto, where there was a very important 'ndrina." &lt;ref name=paoli114/&gt;

It was precisely on account of these innovations that the new institution was opposed by the more traditionalist bosses, such as [[Antonio Macrì]] from the Ionic town of [[Siderno]], the 'Ndrangheta’s charismatic leader of the 1960s, and [[Domenico Tripodo]], who was the dominant figure of the Reggio Calabria clans. Only at the end of the so-called [[First 'Ndrangheta war]], which took place in 1974-76 and led to their deaths and the consequent rise of the [[Paolo De Stefano|De Stefano brothers]] as the new leaders of the Reggio Calabria 'Ndrangheta, was the new institution fully recognized.&lt;ref name=paoli114/&gt;

The ''Santa'' was originally set up as an exclusive body restricted to 33 people. Only when a santista died another member was allowed to enter it. As the years went by, an inflation took place in assigning the status of ''santista''. Around 1978, a new higher rank was established: the ''[[vangelo]]''. Later this was followed by the institution of the position of ''[[trequartino]]'' (three-quarters) or ''quintino'' (fifth). Finally, the current highest rank of ''[[associazione]]'' (society) was established – reserved for the supreme bosses of the 'Ndrangheta.&lt;ref name=paoli114/&gt;&lt;ref name=palmieri&gt;{{it icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070929031031/http://www.fondazionecesar.it/uploads/tx_useregidoc/Ndrangheta.pdf 'Ndrangheta 2005], Nisio Palmieri, ''Dossier della Fondazione Cesar e dell’Associazione Sicurstrada per conto della Consulta Nazionale dei Consigli Regionali Unipol Assicurazioni.''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5013">[[Mozambique]] is a [[multilingual]] country. A number of [[Bantu languages]] are indigenous to Mozambique. [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], inherited from the colonial period (''see: [[Portuguese Mozambique]]''), is the official language, and Mozambique is a full member of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]].&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt; ''Ethnologue'' lists 43 languages spoken in the country.

According to INE, the [[National Institute of Statistics (Mozambique)|National Institute of Statistics]] of Mozambique, Portuguese is the most widely spoken language in Mozambique: According to the 2007 national population and housing census, 50.4% of the national population aged 5 and older (80.8% of people living in urban areas and 36.3% in rural areas) are fluent in the language. Other widely spoken languages include [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Makhuwa language|Makhuwa]], [[Sena language|Sena]], [[Ndau language|Ndau]], and [[Tsonga language|Tswa-Ronga (Tsonga)]]. Other indigenous languages of Mozambique include [[Lomwe language|Lomwe]], [[Makonde language|Makonde]], [[Chopi language|Chopi]], [[Chuwabu language|Chuwabu]], [[Ronga language|Ronga]], [[Kimwani language|Kimwani]], [[Zulu language|Zulu]], and [[Tswa language|Tswa]].&lt;ref name="e"/&gt; The language of the deaf community is [[Mozambican Sign Language]].&lt;ref name="e"/&gt;

Small communities of [[Arabs]], [[overseas Chinese|Chinese]], and [[India]]ns (primarily the [[Gujarati language]]) speak their own languages (Indians from [[Portuguese India]] speak any of the [[Portuguese Creole]]s of their origin) aside from Portuguese as their second language.&lt;ref name="e"/&gt;
[[File:Maputo-marked Praça-dos-Combatentes Mercado-de-Xiquelene.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Commercial signs in Portuguese in Maputo.]]

Article 9 of Mozambique's constitution provides for the recognition of ''national languages'' and that such languages be considered "cultural and educational heritage" and that the state "shall promote their development and increasing use as languages that convey our identity". Portuguese is deemed the country's ''official language'' by article 10.

==Sociolinguistics==
===Multilingualism===

Most Mozambicans speak more than one language.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. According to the 2007 census about 50.4% of all people aged 5 and older speak Portuguese, and 10.7%, including people of Portuguese ancestry and mestiços, speak it as their first language. Use of the Portuguese language remains strongly concentrated to the urban population of Mozambique along the coast.&lt;ref name="brit"/&gt;

{{Infobox Korean name|hangul=이양지|hanja=李良枝|rr=I Yangji|mr=I Yangji|text=Also referred to in Japanese as:&lt;BR/&gt;イ・ヤンジ (''I Yanji'')}}
'''Yangji Lee''' (March 15, 1955 – May 22, 1992) was a second-generation [[Zainichi Korean]] Japanese [[novelist]] born in [[Nishikatsura, Yamanashi]], Japan.  When she was in grade school, her parents acquired Japanese citizenship, and her nationality became Japanese at that time.

In 1982, while studying at [[Seoul National University]], Lee published her work ''Nabi Taryong'' in the literary magazine ''Gunzou'', and her career as a writer began.  In 1988, her work ''Yuhi'' won the 100th [[Akutagawa Prize]], making her the second Zainichi Korean to receive the prize (the first being [[Lee Hoesung]]).  While writing the novel ''Ishi no Koe'', she contracted acute [[myocarditis]] and soon died.

The '''Matsés language''' (also ambiguously called '''Mayoruna''') is an indigenous language of the [[Peru]]vian and [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon basin]] which belongs to the [[Panoan]] language family and is spoken by ca. 2000 [[Matsés people]] (Fleck 2006). The language is vigorous and is spoken by all age groups in the Matsés communities. In the Matsés communities several other indigenous languages are also spoken by women who have been captured from neighboring tribes and some mixture of the languages occur (Fields &amp; Wise 1976 p.&amp;nbsp;1, Fleck 2006 p.&amp;nbsp;542).

Dialects are Peruvian Matses, Brazilian Matses, and the extinct Paud Usunkid.

==Geography==
The language is spoken in the [[Loreto Region]] of Peru and the [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]] state of Brazil, along the [[Javari River]] and its tributaries. A large community is found at Yaquerana in the [[Maynas Province]] of Loreto.

==Genealogy==
Along with the languages of the [[Matis]] and [[Korubo people|Korubo]] peoples, Matsés constitutes the Mayoruna subgroup of the [[Panoan]] languages.

==Phonology==

According to Fleck (2003) Matses has six vowels and 18 consonants.

===Vowels===

The vowel system of Matses is peculiar in that no vowels are rounded. Both of its back vowels should accurately be represented as {{IPA|[ɯ]}} and {{IPA|[ɤ]}} but the convention is to transcribe them with {{angbr|u}} and {{angbr|o}}.(Fleck 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;72)

==Grammar==
The Matsés language is primarily suffixing and highly [[Polysynthetic language|synthetic]] with many morphological possibilities and potentially very long words. There is [[body-part prefix]]ation, but no productive [[noun incorporation]] (Fleck 2006b). [[Inflection]]al and class-changing
morphology is fusional, while non-class-changing derivational morphology is mostly [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]]. Matsés is predominantly “[[dependent-marking language|dependent-marking]]” and uses [[Ergative–absolutive language|ergative–absolutive]] case-marking. Its basic [[word order]] is [[subject–object–verb|SOV]].

''Pisabo'', also known as ''Pisagua'' (Pisahua), is a purported Panoan language spoken by approximately 600 people in Peru and formerly in Brazil, where it was known as ''Mayo'' (Maya, Maia) and was evidently the language known as Quixito.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell &amp; Grondona (2012) ''The Indigenous Languages of South America: A Comprehensive Guide'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; However, no linguistic data is available (Fleck 2013) and it is reported to be [[mutually intelligible]] with Matses.

'''Maxakalí''' (''Yĩy'ax'' 'language', ''Tikmũ'ũn Yĩy'ax'' 'Maxakalí language') is a [[Maxakalían|Maxakalían language]] spoken in fourteen villages in [[Minas Gerais]], [[Brazil]], by fewer than a thousand people.

==Dialects==
[[John Alden Mason|Mason]] identifies six varieties of Maxakali. All but Maxakalí proper are extinct:

* Maxakalí
* Caposhó (Kapoxo) ''(†)''
* Cumanashó (Kumanaxo) ''(†)''
* Maconí (Makuni) ''(†)''
* Monoshó (Monaxo, Monocho) ''(†)''
* Panyame ''(†)''

==Phonology==

Maxakalí has five vowels, occurring in both oral and nasal form.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5266">[[Image:new NVC logo small.jpg|right]]
The '''National Vocabulary Championship''' (NVC) was the first-ever U.S.-wide [[vocabulary]] competition for high school students created by [[Game Show Network|GSN]], in association with [[The Princeton Review]]. Thirty thousand high school students from across the United States participated in the inaugural year (2006-2007).

The NVC aimed to inspire students to expand their vocabularies and narrow the [[achievement gap]]. The program offered free educational resources, created spirited competition through testing and game play, and awarded more than $100,000 annually in college tuition and other prizes.

Fifty finalists nationally received a trip to the NVC Finals, where they competed to win $40,000 toward college tuition in the form of a [[529 plan]] and to be crowned the National Vocabulary Champion.

The host of the National Vocabulary Championship was GSN host [[Dylan Lane]].

The NVC was discontinued after the 2007-2008 academic and competition year due to changes in GSN policy and administration.

== How to Compete ==
The NVC was open to eligible high school students in the United States between the ages of 13 and 19 years old and in grades 9-12. [[Home schooling|Home-schooled]] students were also eligible to compete.

There were two ways to enter the competition:

Eligible students at participating schools in eight local markets could qualify to participate in a ''Citywide Championship'' for a chance to win $5,000 toward college tuition and other prizes, as well as a trip to the national finals.

Eligible students nationwide could also participate through a ''National Qualifying Competition'' via on-line and regional exams offered by The Princeton Review for a chance to compete in the NVC Finals.

==2007-2008 Citywide Championships==
Eight U.S. cities across the country were chosen each year to host Citywide Championship events. Eligible students who wanted to compete in one of the local Citywide Championships had to attend a participating high school, register with the designated NVC coach at their school, and take the NVC in-school qualifying exam. All public and private high schools within these markets and their surrounding areas were invited to participate and encourage their students to compete. Approximately 100 top scorers per market qualified to compete in each Citywide Championship, where one winner received $5,000 toward college tuition and other prizes as well as a trip to the national finals.

Below is a list of cities that the NVC visited in 2007-2008:
* Sacramento: Thursday, November 15 -- '''WINNER:''' Yvonne Lin (Sophomore) 
* Nashville: Tuesday, November 27 -- '''WINNER:''' Brian Swenson (Junior)
* St. Louis: Thursday, November 29  -- '''WINNER:''' Rajiv Tarigopula (Sophomore)
* Detroit: Monday, December 3 -- '''WINNER:''' Steven Banks (Senior)
* Northeast Ohio: Thursday, December 6 -- '''WINNER:''' Joel Fichter (Senior)
* New York: Monday, December 10 -- '''WINNER:''' Rebecca Maxfield (Junior)
* Pittsburgh: Monday, January 14 -- '''WINNER:''' John Oxenreiter (Senior)
* Philadelphia: Thursday, January 17 -- '''WINNER:''' Lauren Bezjak (Junior)

==National Qualifying Competition==
Eligible high school students who did not attend a participating school (listed under Citywide Championship) or who did not wish to take the in-school qualifying exam could compete in the National Qualifying Competition by following the below steps:
1) The NVC offered an online national qualifying exam during November 2007 at [http://www.winwithwords.com winwithwords.com]. For months leading up to the online exam, study tools and study modules were available at [http://www.winwithwords.com winwithwords.com]
Or:
2) Top-scoring students on the online national qualifying exam had an opportunity to advance to the regional exams, which took place at designated The Princeton Review locations across the country. Forty-two top scorers from the National Qualifying Competition joined the eight citywide champions at the national finals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10714">In [[formal language theory]], a [[formal grammar|grammar]] is '''noncontracting''' (or '''monotonic''') if all of its production rules are of the form 
α&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;β where α and β are [[string (formal languages)#Formal theory|strings]] of [[nonterminal]] and terminal symbols, and 
the length of α is less than or equal to that of β, |α| ≤ |β|, that is β is not shorter than α. 
A grammar is '''essentially noncontracting''' if there may be one exception, namely, a rule
''S'' → ε
where ''S'' is the [[Formal grammar#The syntax of grammars|start symbol]] and ε the empty string, and furthermore, ''S'' never occurs in the right-hand side of any rule.

None of the rules of a noncontracting grammar decreases the length of the string that is being rewritten. If each rule even properly increases the length, the grammar is called a '''[[growing context-sensitive grammar]]'''.

== History ==
Chomsky (1963) called a noncontracting grammar a '''type 1 grammar'''; in the same work, he called a [[context-sensitive grammar]] a "type 2 grammar", and he proved that these two are [[Weak equivalence (formal languages)|weakly equivalent]] (context-free grammars were designated "type 4" in this work).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Noam Chomsky | contribution=Formal properties of grammar | pages=323–418 | url=https://archive.org/details/handbookofmathem017893mbp | editor=R.D. Luce and R.R. Bush and E. Galanter | title=Handbook of Mathematical Psychology | location=New York | publisher=Wiley | series= | volume=II | year=1963 }} Here: pp. 360–363 and 367&lt;/ref&gt; The type numbering scheme in this 1963 work of Chomsky does not coincide with the earlier one known today as the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] because he was trying to emphasize the distinction between weak [generative] and strong [structural] equivalence; in his 1959 work he had used "type 1 grammar" to denote a context-sensitive grammar and "type 2" for context-free.&lt;Ref&gt;Chomsky, N. 1959a. On certain formal properties of grammars. Information and Control 2: 137–67. (141–42 for the definitions)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levelt2008-126"&gt;{{cite book|author=Willem J. M. Levelt|title=An Introduction to the Theory of Formal Languages and Automata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFvtwGYNe7kC&amp;pg=PA125|year=2008|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-3250-4|pages=125-126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|- 
| ''S'' || → || ''abc''
|-
| ''S'' || → || ''aSBc''
|-
| ''cB'' || → || ''Bc''
|-
| ''bB'' || → || ''bb''
|}

This grammar, with the start symbol ''S'', generates the language 
{{nowrap|1={ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''b''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''c''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; : ''n'' ≥ 1 } }},&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mateescu|Salomaa|1997}}, Example 2.1, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;
which is not [[context-free language|context-free]] due to the [[Pumping lemma for context-free languages|pumping lemma]].

A context-sensitive grammar for the same language is shown [[#Transforming into context-sensitive grammar|below]].

== Transforming into context-sensitive grammar ==

Every noncontracting grammar (''N'', Σ, ''P'', ''S'') can be transformed into a [[context-sensitive grammar]] (''N''’, Σ, ''P''’, ''S'') as follows:
# For every terminal symbol ''a'' ∈ Σ, introduce a new nonterminal symbol [''a''] ∈ ''N''’, and a new rule ([''a''] → ''a'') ∈ ''P''’.
# In the rules of ''P'', replace every terminal symbol ''a'' by its corresponding nonterminal symbol [''a'']. As a result, all these rules are of the form {{nowrap|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''X''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} → {{nowrap|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} for nonterminals ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''m''≤''n''.
# Replace each rule {{nowrap|''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''X''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;}} → {{nowrap|''Y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;...''Y''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} with ''m''&gt;1 by 2''m'' rules:&lt;ref group=note&gt;For convenience, the non-context part of left and right hand side is shown in boldface.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Expressive power ==
{{misleading}}
Similarly, there is an easy procedure for bringing any noncontracting grammar into [[Kuroda normal form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sige-Yuki Kuroda | title=Classes of languages and linear-bounded automata | journal=Information and Control | volume=7 | number=2 | pages=207–223 | date=June 1964 | doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(64)90120-2}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Mateescu|Salomaa|1997}}, Theorem 2.2, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;
Vice versa, every context-sensitive grammar and every Kuroda normal form grammar is trivially also a noncontracting grammar.
Therefore, noncontracting grammars, grammars in Kuroda normal form, and context-sensitive grammars have the same expressive power.
To be precise, the noncontracting grammars describe exactly the [[context-sensitive language]]s that do not include the empty string, while the essentially noncontracting grammars describe exactly the set of [[context-sensitive language]]s.

{{Maoism sidebar |expanded=Basic}}

'''People's war''', also called '''protracted people's war''', is a [[Marxist]] military strategy first developed by the Chinese [[communist]] revolutionary leader [[Mao Zedong]] (1893–1976). The basic concept behind People's War is to maintain the support of the population and draw the enemy deep into the countryside (stretching their supply lines) where the population will bleed them dry through a mix of [[Mobile Warfare|mobile warfare]] and [[guerrilla warfare]]. It was used by the Communists against [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in [[World War II]] and by the [[Chinese Soviet Republic]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]].

The term is used by [[Maoism|Maoists]] for their strategy of long-term armed revolutionary struggle. After the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]] in 1979, [[Deng Xiaoping]] abandoned People's War for "People's War under Modern Conditions," which moved away from reliance on troops over technology. With the adoption of "[[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]", economic reforms fueled military and technological investment. Troop numbers were also reduced and professionalisation encouraged.

The strategy of people's war was used heavily by the [[Viet Cong]] in the [[Vietnam War]]. However protracted war should not be confused with the [[Foco|"foco" theory]] employed by [[Che Guevara]] and [[Fidel Castro]] in the [[Cuban Revolution]] of 1959.

==Overview==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2009}}

===In China===
In its original formulation by [[Mao Zedong]], people's war exploits the few advantages that a small revolutionary movement has—broad-based popular support can be one of them—against a [[State (polity)|state]]'s [[Political power|power]] with a large, professional, well-equipped and well-funded army. People's war strategically avoids decisive battles, since a tiny force of a few dozen soldiers would easily be routed in an all-out confrontation with the state. Instead, it favours a three-stage strategy of protracted warfare, with carefully chosen battles that can realistically be won.

In stage one, revolutionary force conducting people's war starts in a remote area with mountainous or otherwise difficult terrain in which its enemy is weak. It attempts to establish a local stronghold known as a [[revolutionary base area]]. As it grows in power, it enters stage two, establishes other revolutionary base areas and spreads its influence through the surrounding countryside, where it may become the governing power and gain popular support through such programmes as [[land reform]]. Eventually in stage three, the movement has enough strength to encircle and capture small cities, then larger ones, until finally it seizes power in the entire country.

Within the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese Red Army]], the concept of people's war was the basis of strategy against the Japanese, and against a hypothetical Soviet invasion of China. The concept of people's war became less important with the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the increasing possibility of conflict with the [[United States]] over [[Taiwan]]. In the 1980s and 1990s the concept of people's war was changed to include more high-technology weaponry.

===Outside China===
Outside China, the people's war doctrine has been successful in [[Cuba]], [[Nepal]], and [[Nicaragua]], but generally unsuccessful elsewhere in which the government has the will and the means to break up the movement before it can establish base areas.

Outside China, people's war has been basis of wars started in [[Peru]] on May 2, 1982, and in the [[Nepalese Civil War]] begun on February 9, 1999. A group of Peruvian Maoists known as the [[Shining Path]] at times controlled significant parts of the country during the [[internal conflict in Peru]], but they were dealt a blow by the arrest of their leader [[Abimael Guzmán]] in 1992. While they claim to consider this event only a "bend in the road", most independent sources have claimed them to be in decline since that time.

By all accounts, at the height of the conflict in Peru, both the Shining Path and the Peruvian government used terror tactics against the civilian population, especially in the countryside. Government tactics included sponsorship of [[death squads]]; Shining Path tactics included violent attacks on trade unionists and others they saw as rivals for the leadership of those opposing the government. This has made it very difficult to get any objective measure of support among the peasantry for either the government or the Maoist insurgents, since such tactics on both sides are liable to intimidate people, but unlikely to win hearts and minds.

In Nepal, the Maoists succeeded in controlling most of the country and formed 100,000 troops into 3 divisions in what they called the "beginning of the strategic offensive". The Nepalese rebels also resorted to conscription, a practice that Mao himself opposed. By aligning with the [[2006 democracy movement in Nepal|democracy movement]], with the subsequent restoration of democracy, and a peace agreement with the government, the Maoist insurgency met sufficient success to allow the formation of a [[Nepalese Constituent Assembly election, 2008|coalition government in 2008]].

In [[India]], the [[Naxalite]] [[Naxalite-Maoist insurgency|Maoist insurgency]] controls several rural districts in the eastern and southern regions, especially in [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Chhattisgarh]] and [[Jharkhand]]. In the [[Philippines]] the [[Communist Party of the Philippines]] is waging an enduring people's war through its armed wing, the [[New People's Army]], the Turkish [[TKP/ML]] and its armed wing TiKKO (Turkish Workers and Peasants Liberation Army) has been waging a People's War in Turkey since 1972.

During the 1980s in Ireland, [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] leader [[Jim Lynagh]] devised a Maoist [[urban guerilla]] military strategy adapted to Irish conditions aimed at escalating the war against [[British forces]]. The plan envisaged the destruction of police and army bases in parts of [[Northern Ireland]] in order to create liberated areas under IRA control. In 1984 he started cooperating with [[Pádraig McKearney]] who shared his views. The strategy began materializing with the destruction of two Royal Ulster Constabulary barracks in Ballygawley in December 1985 (resulting in the death of two [[Royal Ulster Constabulary|RUC]] officers), and in The Birches in August 1986. Lynagh and his IRA unit were killed in another attack at Loughgall Police station in an [[Special Air Service|SAS]] ambush.

A '''professional wrestling promotion''' (also '''federation''' or '''fed''') is a [[company]] or [[business]] that regularly performs shows involving [[professional wrestling]]. "Promotion" also describes a role which entails management, advertising and logistics of running a wrestling event (''see [[promoter (entertainment)|promoter]]''). Within the convention of the show, the company is a [[Sport governing body|sports governing body]] which sanctions wrestling matches and gives authority to the championships and is responsible for determining the divisions, rankings, etc. of wrestlers. In truth, the company serves as a [[touring theatre]] [[Repertory theatre|troupe]], as well as [[Promoter (entertainment)|event promotion body]] for its own events.

Currently, the major wrestling organizations in the [[United States]] are [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) and [[Ring of Honor]]. The major promotion in [[Canada]] is [[Impact Wrestling]]. The major [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[lucha libre]] promotions are [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) and [[Lucha Libre AAA Worldwide|AAA]]. The top [[Japan]]ese [[puroresu]] promotions are [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW), [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW), and [[Pro Wrestling Noah]]. There are also small promotions called [[Independent circuit|indies]] or territories around the world.

==Structure==
Most promotions are self-contained, organized around one or more [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championships]] and do not acknowledge or recognize the legitimacy of other promotions' titles unless they share a working agreement. Others, such as the [[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA]], act as an [[umbrella organization]] which governs titles that are shared among multiple promotions.

Major promotions have a permanent roster of talent under exclusive contract to them. Independent promotions may have contracted workers but are just as likely to use [[free agent]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7786">[[File:Common purlin framing.JPG|thumb|A view of a roof using common purlin framing. This view is from the inside of the building, below the roof. The ''rafters'' are the beams of wood angled upward from the ground. They meet at the top of the gable at a ''ridge beam'', which has extra ''bracing'' to attach it to the rafters.  The ''purlins'' are the large beams perpendicular to the rafters; from this shot, it appears that there are three purlins on either side of the roof. The sheathing boards are sometimes called the [[roof deck]] and are painted white.]]
In [[architecture]], [[structural engineering]] or building, a '''purlin''' (or historically '''purline''', '''purloyne''', '''purling''', '''perling''') is any longitudinal, horizontal, structural member in a [[roof]] except a type of framing with what is called a crown plate. In traditional [[timber framing]] there are three basic types of purlin: purlin plate, principal purlin and common purlin.

== Purlin plates in wooden construction ==
A ''purlin plate'' in wooden construction is also called an "arcade plate" in European English,&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Richard. "Bays, frames and boxes." Discovering timber-framed buildings. 3rd revised ed. Aylesbury: Shire Publications, 1979. 10&lt;/ref&gt; "under purlin", and "principal purlin". The term [[Wall plate|plate]] means a major, horizontal, supporting timber. Purlin plates are beams which support the mid-span of rafters and are supported by posts. By supporting the rafters they allow longer spans than the rafters alone could span thus allowing a wider building. Purlin plates are very commonly found in large, old barns in North America. A [[Crown post|crown plate]] has similarities to a purlin plate but supports [[collar beam]]s in the middle of a timber framed building.

==Principal purlins in wood construction==
Principal purlins in wood construction, also called "major purlin", "side purlin". Principal purlins are supported by principal rafters and support common rafters in what is known as a "double roof" (a roof framed with a layer of principal rafters and a layer of common rafters). Principal purlins are further classified by how they connect to the principal rafters:  "Through purlins" pass over the top; "butt purlins" tenon into the sides of the principal rafters; "clasped purlins," of which only one historic U.S. example is known,{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}) are captured by a collar beam. Through purlins are further categorized as trenched, back, or clasped; butt purlins are classified as threaded, tenoned, and/or{{Please clarify|reason=Classified by definition as all or classifiable depending on further characteristics as one or more of the three?|date=July 2014}} staggered.&lt;ref&gt;Alcock, N. W. "Purlins." ''Recording timber-framed buildings: an illustrated glossary''. York, England: Council for British Archaeology, 1996. G14, F12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common purlins in wood construction==
Common purlins in wood construction, also called a "major-rafter minor-purlin system".&lt;ref&gt;Hubka, Thomas C.. "The Buildings." Big house, little house, back house, barn: the connected farm buildings of New England. Hanover [N.H.: University Press of New England, 1984. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Common purlins are typically "trenched through" the top sides (backs) of principal rafters and carry vertical roof sheathing (The key to identifying this type of roof system). Common purlin roofs in North America are found in areas settled by Englishmen and may have been a new invention in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. No examples of framed buildings with common purlin roofs have been reported in England, however some stone barns in England have vertically boarded, common purlin roofs. Historically, these roofs are found in New England, the highest concentration in Maine, and isolated parts of New York and along the St. Lawrence River in Canada. One of the oldest extant (surviving) examples is in the [[Coffin House]] in Newbury, Massachusetts from 1678. The purpose of a common purlin roof may be they allow a [[board roof]], that is a roof of nothing but vertically laid boards with seams covered with battens or another layer of boards.&lt;ref&gt;The origin of the common purlin roof is my studied opinion. These roofs were historically common in northern Europe and may have been brought to the New World by the Pilgrims after their two decades of living in the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steel construction==
In steel construction, the term '''purlin''' typically refers to roof framing members that span parallel to the building eave, and support the roof decking or sheeting.  The purlins are in turn supported by rafters or walls. Purlins are most commonly used in Metal Building Systems, where Z-shapes are utilized in a manner that allows flexural continuity between spans.

It is the practice in the steel industry that structural shapes are assigned representative designations for convenient shorthand description on drawings and documentation: Channel sections, with or without flange stiffeners, are usually referenced as C shapes; Channel sections without flange stiffeners are also referenced as U shapes; Point symmetric sections that are shaped similar to the letter Z are referenced as Z shapes. Section designations can be regional and even specific to a manufacturer. In steel building construction, secondary members such as purlins (roof) and girts (wall) are frequently [[cold-formed steel]] C, Z or U sections, (or mill rolled) C sections.

Cold formed members can be efficient on a weight basis relative to mill rolled sections for secondary member applications. Additionally, Z sections can be nested for transportation bundling and, on the building, lapped at the supports to develop a structurally efficient continuous beam across multiple supports.

==Etymology==
Information on the origin of the term "purlin" is scant. The Oxford Dictionary suggests a French origin, with the earliest quote using a variation of ''purlin'' in 1447.

English [[theatre]] [[stage (theatre)|stages]] in the [[Middle Ages]] and early Modern era typically sloped upwards away from the [[audience]]. This is known as a '''rake''' or '''raked stage''' and improves the view and sound for the audience.

==Calculating incline==
The slope of the rake is measured by the number of horizontal units it takes for one vertical unit measured in the direction of the [[Grade (slope)|slope]], or by the equivalent percentage. A rake of one horizontal unit to one vertical unit (1 in 1) would give an angle of 45° from the horizontal. Rakes of 1 in 18 (5.56%) to 1 in 48 (2.08%) were more common. 

Converting the rake ratio to an angle requires the application of some basic trigonometry. The angle in degrees = arctan(vertical/horizontal), where "vertical" is the vertical rise in distance and "horizontal" is the horizontal distance over which this rise occurs. For example, for a rake of 1:18, the corresponding angle is arctan(1/18) = 3.18°.

==History==
Theatres constructed after the beginning of the 20th century feature a raked audience section. This change back to the method of construction seen in [[Greek theatre|Greek]] and [[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theaters]] (flat stage and terraced audience) was effected due the difficulty encountered when one tries to walk across a sloped surface, which had resulted in unnatural movement patterns to avoid the appearance of limping caused by the non-level surface.

Raked stages can still be seen in many [[opera]] and west end productions, where a temporary raked acting surface is built over a theatre's permanent flat stage. Creating a raked stage can also assist [[scenic design|set designs]] requiring forced perspective.

==Upstaging==
On a raked stage an actor who is further from the audience is higher than an actor who is closer to the audience. This led to the theatre positions "upstage" and "downstage", meaning, respectively, further from or closer to the audience.

The term "[[Blocking (stage)|upstaging]]" refers to one actor moving to a more elevated position on the rake (stage), causing the upstaged actor (who stays more downstage, closer to the audience) to turn their back from the audience to address the cast member. The term "upstaging" has also since taken on the figurative meaning of an actor unscrupulously drawing the audience's attention away from another actor.

'''Rigoberto Fontao Meza''' (December 29, 1900 – December 29, 1936) was a [[Paraguay|Paraguayan]] poet. He is considered by some{{Who|date=April 2018}} to be one of the greatest poets of the Paraguayan [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native]] canon. He wrote highly descriptive poems in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]] and [[Jopara language|Jopara]].

He died in [[Asunción]], [[Paraguay]], on his birthday, December 29, 1936, at the age of 36.

==Biography==

The son of Benjamín Fontao and Marciana Meza, he was born in Tape Ka'aty, located in the [[San Pedro Department, Paraguay]], on December 29, 1900.
 
He was friends with many of the composers of his time, including [[José Asunción Flores]]. Flores composed the lyrics of the songs "Arribeño Resay", "Ka'aty" and the first version of "India" for him.

He wrote the lyrics of "El Arriero", with [[Félix Pérez Cardozo]] composing a song for it later. The piece has since been interpreted by numerous people.
 
When [[Manuel Ortiz Guerrero]] heard Flores' interpretation for the ''guarania'' (a traditional [[Guarani language|Guarani]] folk song)  "India" for the first time, he showed admiration for the piece, but questioned the lyrics, saying that they did not have the same transcendence as the song, and offered to compose better lyrics. Flores and Rigoberto Fontao Meza agreed that Meza wouldn't allow the change, but Flores replaced the lyrics with ones from Guerrero, and it became the version of India known nowadays. "India"  was declared in 1944 as "Official Paraguayan Music" along with "Campamento Cerro León" and "Cerro Corá" by law of the Executive State.

==List of Works==

Meza wrote numerous poems throughout his lifetime. Some of his contributions to the Paraguayan folkloric canon include:

* Mba'épa Nerohasê.
* Mutilados de guerra.
* El Arriero.
* Arribeño Resay.
* Ka'a Poty.
* Che resay.
* Nde Clavelkuemi.
* Poniente Ruguaicha.
* Congoja.
* Nda vy'airamoguare.
* Guerra tiempope guare'e.

He also produced theatrical plays and published a poem book.

Spencer does not believe that traditional [[Islam]] is "inherently terroristic" but says he can prove that "traditional Islam contains violent and supremacist elements", and that "its various schools unanimously teach warfare against and the subjugation of unbelievers".&lt;ref name="the last"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/021661.php|title=''The Last Patriot'': Worse than Spencer's books!|publisher= Jihad Watch|date=July 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he rejects the notion that all Muslims are necessarily violent people.&lt;ref name="the last"/&gt; He has said that among moderate Muslims, "there are some who are genuinely trying to frame a theory and practice of Islam that will allow for peaceful coexistence with unbelievers as equals."&lt;ref name="what is moderate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jihadwatch.org/archives/009791.php|title=What is a moderate Muslim?|publisher=Jihad Watch|author=Robert Spencer|date=January 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spencer co-founded [[Stop Islamization of America]] (SIOA) and the [[American Freedom Defense Initiative]] (AFDI) with [[Pamela Geller]] in 2010. Both organizations are designated as [[hate group]]s by the [[Anti-Defamation League]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/main_Extremism/sioa.htm "Backgrounder: Stop Islamization of America (SIOA)"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502054200/http://www.adl.org/main_Extremism/sioa.htm |date=2012-05-02 }}.

In July 2011, [[Wired (Magazine)|Wired]] reported that two of Spencer’s books were listed in [[FBI]] training materials. Both ''[[The Truth About Muhammad]]'' and ''[[The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam]]'' were recommended for agents hoping to better understand Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ackerman, Spencer|date=July 27, 2011|work=[[Wired (Magazine)|Wired]]|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/07/fbi-islam-101-guide/|title=FBI 'Islam 101' Guide Depicted Muslims as 7th-Century Simpletons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
On December 20, 2006, the government of Pakistan announced a ban on Spencer's book, ''[[The Truth About Muhammad]]'', citing "objectionable material" as the cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nationalreview.com/phi-beta-cons/45068/pakistan-book-closed-muhammad-candace-de-russy |title= Pakistan: Book Closed on Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Onward Muslim Soldiers]]'' was banned in Malaysia on July 12, 2007.&lt;ref name=BERNAMA&gt;{{cite news|title=Ministry Bans 14 Books|url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/printable.php?id=272915|newspaper=[[BERNAMA]]|date=12 July 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221210/http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/printable.php?id=272915|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Spencer was asked to participate in an information session about Islam and Muslims designed for ethnic and multicultural librarians entitled "Perspectives on Islam: Beyond the Stereotyping", at the 2009 annual meeting of the [[American Library Association]], which was sponsored by the ALA's Ethnic &amp; Multicultural Information Exchange Round Table (EMIERT). After objections were raised by ALA members and the general public, the three other panelists withdrew in protest and the session was ultimately canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ALA Conference 2009: Panelists Quit Session Featuring 'Islam Basher{{'-}}|url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6670156.html|work=Library Journal|accessdate=June 11, 2011|author=Raya Kuzyk|author2=Norman Oder |date=July 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Operation Protective Edge]], Spencer was accused of spreading an anti-Palestinian misinformation video, originally published by Pamela Geller, by inaccurately claiming a video of an Egyptian [[die-in]] protest from Egyptian newspaper El Badil was a video of Hamas faking the number of casualties killed by Israel.  Robert Spencer wrote “as Muhammad said, ‘War is deceit.’ And so here is more ‘Palestinian’ victimhood propaganda unmasked. Not that the international media and the world ‘human rights community’ will take any notice. Video thanks to Pamela Geller.” After El Badil had the video removed from Geller's YouTube account due to copyright infringement, El Badil wrote that Spencer and Geller's inability to distinguish a die-in protest from an [[Islamic funeral]] either makes them "incompetent to speak on Islam or they are professional liars."&lt;ref&gt;Pamela Geller is transmitting hate against Palestinians by spreading misinformation, El Badil, (2014). [http://elbadil.com/2014/08/24/pamela-geller-transmitting-hate-palestinians-spreading-misinformation/ Elbadil.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Conservative Post, Gaza ‘Corpses’ Caught Moving When They Forget Cameras Are On Them, August 19, 2014 [http://conservativepost.com/gaza-corpses-caught-moving-when-they-forget-cameras-are-on-them/ Conservativepost.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an October 2010 news article, an investigative report by ''[[The Tennessean]]'' described Spencer as one of several individuals who "... cash in on spreading hate and fear about Islam." Tennessean investigation concluded "IRS filings from 2008 show that Robert Spencer earned $132,537 from the [[David Horowitz Freedom Center]], and Horowitz pocketed over $400,000 for himself in just one year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20101024/NEWS01/10240374/Anti-Muslim-crusaders-make-millions-spreading-fear|title=Anti-Muslim crusaders make millions spreading fear|date=October 24, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tennessean.com/assets/pdf/DN1658821023.PDF|title=David Horowitz Freedom Center's IRS Form 990|date=June 3, 2009|accessdate=April 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spencer was first invited to be a speaker at the Catholic Men’s Conference of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Worcester]] on March 16, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20130203/NEWS/102039841/1020|title=Catholic speakers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bishop [[Robert Joseph McManus]] then decided to rescind the invitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicfreepress.org/local/2013/02/08/catholic-mens-conference-opens-ticket-sales/|title=Catholic Men’s Conference opens ticket sales |publisher= The Catholic Free Press|date=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University appearances===
On April 13, 2017, Spencer spoke at the [[Truman State University]] despite protests and a petition against him. He was invited by the [[Young America's Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/truman-state-grapples-with-controversial-anti-muslim-speaker/article_138f0acd-bd84-59e1-890e-d921a1ec6ee2.html|title=Truman State grapples with controversial anti-Muslim speaker|publisher=St. Louis Post-Dispatch }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2017, Spencer spoke at the [[University of Buffalo]]. There he was shouted down and heckled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buffalonews.com/2017/05/01/controversial-speaker-ub-shouted-heckled/|title=No violence, but UB speaker greeted with tension, heckling|publisher=The Buffalo News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 3, 2017, Spencer spoke at [[Gettysburg College]]. 375 alumni urged the college president [[Janet Morgan Riggs]] to cancel the speech, but the event went on as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gettysburgian.com/2017/05/open-letter-from-375-alums-urges-president-riggs-to-cancel-robert-spencers-speech/|title=Open letter from 375 alums urges President Riggs to cancel Robert Spencer’s speech|date=May 1, 2017|newspaper=[[The Gettysburgian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer said, "There is one kind of diversity that is not valued generally in an academic setting and that is intellectual diversity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gettysburgian.com/2017/05/robert-spencers-speech-at-gettysburg-college-engages-students-in-civil-discourse/|title=Robert Spencer’s speech at Gettysburg College engages students in civil discourse|author=Pontz, Benjamin|date=May 3, 2017|newspaper=The Gettysburgian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 14, 2017, Spencer spoke at [[Stanford University]]. Many students walked out during the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Stanford-Students-Walk-Out-Protest-During-Robert-Spencer-Speaking-Event-457635203.html|title=Stanford Students Walk Out, Protest During Robert Spencer Speaking Event|publisher=NBC Bay Area }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ban from entering the UK===
On June 26, 2013, Spencer and [[Pamela Geller]] were banned from entering the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US bloggers banned from entering UK|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23064355|accessdate=June 27, 2013|publisher=BBC|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were due to speak at an [[English Defence League]] march in [[Woolwich]], south London, where Drummer [[Murder of Lee Rigby|Lee Rigby]] was killed. [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] informed Spencer and Geller that their presence in the UK would "not be conducive to the public good".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rawlinson|first=Kevin|title=Anti-Ground Zero Mosque campaigners Pamela Geller and Robert Spencer barred from entering Britain to speak at an EDL rally|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/antiground-zero-mosque-campaigners-pamela-geller-and-robert-spencer-barred-from-entering-britain-to-speak-at-an-edl-rally-8675251.html|accessdate=June 27, 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=June 26, 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A letter from the UK Home Office stated that this decision is based on Spencer's statement that:

"{{anchor|uk ban statement}}It [Islam] is a religion or a belief system that mandates warfare against unbelievers for the purpose of establishing a societal model that is absolutely incompatible with Western society ... because of media and general government unwillingness to face the sources of Islamic terrorism these things remain largely unknown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=The Speech that Got Robert Spencer Banned From the UK|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=June 27, 2013|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHdUgc6gxDI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision&lt;!-- ", which they cannot appeal,"-it was appealed in 2015-see below--&gt; will stand for between three and five years. The ban followed a concerted campaign by the UK anti-extremism and civil rights organization [[Hope not Hate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Muslim pair banned from UK|url=http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/410494/Anti-Muslim-pair-banned-from-UK|accessdate=June 27, 2013|newspaper=Daily Express|location=UK|date=June 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which said it had collected 26,000 signatures for a petition to the Home Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lowles|first=Nick|title=Geller and Spencer Banned|url=http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/blog/article/2803/geller-and-spencer-banned|publisher=Hope not Hate|accessdate=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer and Geller contested the ban, but in 2015 the [[British Court of Appeals]] dismissed the appeal, arguing  that "this was a public order case where the police had advised that significant public disorder and serious violence might ensue from the proposed visit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2015/45.html&amp;query=geller&amp;method=boolean | title=Geller &amp; Anor, R (on the application of) v The Secretary of State for the Home Department [2015] EWCA Civ 45 (05 February 2015) | publisher=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute]] | accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UK Human Rights Blog"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ukhumanrightsblog.com/2015/02/15/critics-of-islam-prevented-from-entering-uk-to-attend-lee-rigby-rally/ | title=Critics of Islam prevented from entering UK to attend Lee Rigby rally | publisher=1 Crown Office Row | work=UK Human Rights Blog | date=February 15, 2015 | accessdate=October 31, 2017 | author=English, Rosalind}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban was criticised by [[Douglas Murray (author)|Douglas Murray]]. He noted that Islamist hate preachers are still allowed to enter the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A gross double standard over hate speech|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2013/06/a-gross-double-standard-over-hate-speech/|accessdate=February 8, 2017|newspaper=[[The Spectator]]|location=UK|date=June 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saaroa''' or '''Hla’alua''' is a Southern [[Tsouic language]] is spoken by the [[Saaroa people|Saaroa (Hla'alua) people]], an [[Taiwanese aborigines|indigenous people]] of [[Taiwan]]. It is a [[Formosan language]] of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family.

The Saaroa live in the two villages of Taoyuan and Kaochung in Taoyuan District (Taoyuan Township), [[Kaohsiung]] City, Taiwan (Zeitoun &amp; Teng 2014).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iscll-14.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files-pdf/Papers/Session6/ZeitounTeng.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606223817/http://iscll-14.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files-pdf/Papers/Session6/ZeitounTeng.pdf |archivedate=2014-06-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Saaroa map.png|thumb|map indicates the location where the language is still spoken]]

With fewer than 10 native speakers and an ethnic population of 400 people, Saaroa is considered critically [[Endangered language|endangered]]. Even among native speakers of the language, they use primarily [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] or Bunun in their daily lives. There is no longer an active speech community for Saaroa.&lt;ref name="endangeredlanguages.com"/&gt;

==Language evolution==
When grouped according to grammar, Saaroa is most closely related to the other Formosan language ([[Tsou language|Tsou]]) and branches very early from Proto-Formosan language that defines the grouping.&lt;ref&gt;http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf4/starosta1996position.pdf Starosta, S.

In Pan-Asiatic Linguistics: Proceedings of the Fourth International Symposium on Languages and Linguistics (Vol. 3, pp. 944-966), 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

On lexical and phonographical grounds, [[Tsou language|Tsou]], [[Kanakanbu]], and Saaroa also cluster well to form the Tsouic subgroup; it is likely that the Rukai and the "Lower Three Villages Rukai" are also Tsouic languages.&lt;ref&gt;http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/ferrell1979construction.pdf Ferrell, R. (1979). Construction markers and subgrouping of Formosan languages. Southeast Asian Linguistic Studies, 3, 199-211. 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsouic group used to occupy a fairly large area in the southwestern parts of central Taiwan. Due to the invasion of other communities and contagious diseases, it shrank to the relatively small areas as today.
The oral tradition say that the Tsouic group originated in [[Yushan National Park#Cultural heritage|Yushan]]. About 2,000 years ago, the group split into two, the Northern Tsou and Southern Tsou. Northern Tsou moved down along [[Nantzuhsien River]] to the west, while Southern Tsou moved down along [[Laonung River]]. The latter split into two, Kanakanabu and Saaroa about 800 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;http://intranet.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2001_1_15_4392.pdf Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 2001. "The Dispersal of the Formosan Aborigines in Taiwan." ''Languages and Linguistics'' 2.1:271-278, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990, Saaroa was nearly extinct. Few children speak the language. The [[Bunun language]] is becoming the main language of the Saaroa people, and many of the elders in the community speak [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese Hokkien]]. The shift to the Bunun language occurred when the Bunun migrated into the area inhabited by the Saaroa people.

Saaroa has heavily borrowed from Mantauran [[Rukai language|Rukai]], since the Saaroa and Rukai peoples are geographically adjacent to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Li, Paul Jen-kuei. 2001. "The Dispersal of the Formosan Aborigines in Taiwan." ''Languages and Linguistics'' 2.1:271-278, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammatical profile==
Lha’alua has 13 consonants: |p, t, k, ʔ, s, v, ts, m, n, ŋ, r, ɾ, ɬ| and four vowels: |i, ɨ, u, a|. The basic syllable pattern in Saaroa is (C)V, where C stands for consonants and V for vowels or long vowels. Vowels can either appear as long vowels or in clusters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar of Lha'alua, an Austronesian Language of Taiwan|last=Pan|first=Chia-jung|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vowels in clusters make two or more syllables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  There are also plenty of loan words in Saaroa, many of which were introduced during the [[Japanese occupation of Taiwan]] (1895-1945). Apart from Japanese, words were borrowed from Mandarin Chinese, Taiwanese southern Min, and other aboriginal languages in the neighboring area, e.g. [[Bunun language|Bunun]].

In the past, Roman script was employed in the previous writing materials of Saaroa.

Underived roots carry the basic meaning of words typically consist of more than two syllables, in a (C)V.(C)V.(C)V pattern. 
Saaroa distinguishes primary stress (indicated by ˊ ) and secondary stress (indicated by ˋ). Primary stress is not contrastive, nor is secondary stress. A vowel with primary stress is characterised by higher pitch and greater intensity. Though the stressed syllable is realised with a high pitch, the difference between words does not lie in the positioning or quality of this pitch. Therefore, Saaroa should not be considered a pitch-accent language.
In Saaroa, [[reduplication]] is a very productive morphological process. Exactly the same morphological process may apply to a dynamic verb and an adjectival element within a predicate. For example, when undergoing reduplication, both adjectival elements and dynamic verbs can have 'progressive', 'continuous', intensification (or 'iteration')', 'diminutive' and 'collectivity' meanings.

In Saaroa, nouns are subsumed under several grammatical subclasses according to their morphological/syntactic possibilities correlating with semantic properties of their referents (i) common nouns, (ii) kinship terms, (iii) human nouns and nonhuman nouns, (iv) person names, (v) locative nouns and (vi) temporal nouns. These classes may overlap; accordingly, a noun can fall in more than one class. 
Similarly, verbs are subsumed under several grammatical subclasses according to the morphological/syntactic possibilities correlating with semantic properties of the referents: (i) transitivity classes, (ii) stative verbs, and (iii) adverbial verbs. All the classes may overlap; accordingly, a verb can fall into more than one class.
In Saaroa, the functional possibilities of adjectival elements typically include being modifiers to a head noun in an NP and heads of an intransitive predicate.&lt;ref&gt;http://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/32386/1/32386_Pan_2012_thesis.pdf Pan, C. (2012). A Grammar of Lha'alua, an Austronesian Language of Taiwan. James Cook University. 417pp, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to word order, Saaroa is basically a predicate-initial language. The irrealis Actor Voice verb muacekehle 'will return' appears before the Subject argument kana'ana '(s)he'. Moreover, the basic word order is Verb-Actor-Theme. For example, the nominative Actor argument of an Actor Voice Construction (e.g., mairange 'sweet potato'). Similalrly, the nominative Theme argument of a Patient Voice construction must follow the genitive Actor argument.&lt;ref&gt;Li, C. (2010).

==Ingot==
[[File:Lingot aluminium.jpg|thumb|An aluminum ingot]]
{{Main|Ingot}}

Ingots are large rough castings designed for storage and transportation. The shape usually resembles a rectangle or square with generous [[fillet (mechanics)|fillets]]. They are tapered, usually with the big-end-down.&lt;ref name="summit"&gt;{{Citation | title = Definition of standard mill terms | url = http://www.summitsteel.com/term.htm | accessdate = 03-04-2010 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5nzOUAsA3 | archivedate = 03-04-2010 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bloom==
In the era of commercial [[wrought iron]], blooms were slag-riddled iron castings poured in a [[bloomery]] before being worked into wrought iron. In the era of commercial [[steel]], blooms are intermediate-stage pieces of steel produced by a first pass of [[rolling (metalworking)|rolling]] (in a blooming mill) that works the ingots down to a smaller cross-sectional area, but still greater than {{convert|36|in2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="arcelormittal"/&gt; Blooms are usually further processed via [[rotary piercing]], [[structural shape rolling]] and profile rolling. Common final products include [[structural shapes]], [[rail tracks|rails]], rods, and [[seamless pipe]]s.&lt;ref name="degarmo"/&gt;

==Billet==
[[File:Palanquillas.JPG|thumb|Steel billets]]
{{For|the colloquial use of the term|Bar stock}}

A '''billet''' is a length of metal that has a round or square cross-section, with an area less than {{convert|36|in2|abbr=on}}. Billets are created directly via [[continuous casting]] or [[extrusion]] or indirectly via [[hot rolling]] an ingot or bloom.&lt;ref name="arcelormittal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="summit"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Titanium Metal Glossary | url = http://www.westerntitanium.com/glossary.html | accessdate = 03-04-2010 | archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5nzP6WseK | archivedate = 03-04-2010 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Billets are further processed via [[profile rolling]] and [[drawing (manufacturing)|drawing]]. Final products include [[bar stock]] and [[wire]].&lt;ref name="degarmo"&gt;{{Citation | last = Degarmo | first = E.

[[Centrifugal casting (industrial)|Centrifugal casting]] is also used to produce short circular tubes as billets, usually to achieve a precise metallurgical structure. They are commonly used as [[Cylinder (engine)|cylinder sleeves]] where the inner and outer diameters are [[grinding (abrasive cutting)|ground]] and machined to length. Because their size is not modified significantly, they are not always classified as semi-finished casting products.

In copper production, a billet is a 30' long, about 8" diameter, of pure copper.

==Slab==
A slab is a length of metal that is rectangular in cross-section. The slab is created directly by [[continuous casting]] or indirectly by rolling an ingot on a slabbing mill.&lt;ref name="arcelormittal"/&gt; Slabs are usually further processed via [[rolling (metalworking)|flat rolling]], [[skelp]]ing, and pipe rolling. Common final products include [[sheet metal]], plates, strip metal, [[pipe (material)|pipes]], and [[Tube (fluid conveyance)|tubes]].&lt;ref name="degarmo"/&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], a '''sign relational complex''' is a generalization of a [[sign relation]] that allows for empty components in the ''elementary sign relations'', or sign relational triples of the form (object, sign, interpretant).

Generally speaking, when it comes to things that are being contemplated as ostensible or potential signs of other things, neither the existence nor the uniqueness of the elements appearing in the sign relation is guaranteed.  For example, the reference of a putative sign to its putative objects may achieve reference to zero, to one, or to many objects.  A proper treatment of this complication calls for the conception of something slightly more general than a sign relation proper, namely, a sign relational complex.  In effect, expressed in the roughest practical terms, this allows for ''missing data'' in the columns of the relational database table for the sign relation in question.  Typically one operates on the default assumption that all of the roles of elementary sign relations are filled, but remains wary enough of the possible exceptions to deal with them on an ''[[ad hoc]]'' basis.

[[Image:Partial suspension folsom.jpg|thumb|right|This bondage demonstration during [[Folsom Street Fair]] 2005 is a [[shibari]] style partial suspension.]]
'''Suspension bondage''' is a form of [[Bondage (BDSM)|sexual bondage]] where a bound person is hung from one or more overhead suspension points. Suspension bondage is considered to carry a higher risk than other forms of sexual bondage.

== Stimulation ==
In ''partial suspension'' the person is bound in a way that part of their body weight is held by suspension ropes, cables or chains. The classic partial suspension position is to have the person balancing on one foot with part of their weight supported through a chest harness and the other leg pulled up in some direction. A person lying on their upper back with legs tied upwards to a suspension point to pull their lower back off the ground would also qualify as partial suspension.

In ''full suspension'' the person is completely supported by suspension ropes, cables or [[chain]]s, and they have no contact with the ground. The position of the person's body in a full suspension is only limited by their endurance and the skill of the binder.

The main effect of suspension bondage is to create a heightened sense of [[vulnerability]] and [[inescapability]], as the subject is made to feel that by attempting to free themselves they may fall and hurt themselves, thus also creating a form of mental bondage in addition to the physical one that holds them. Being suspended, especially in a large open space, also creates a sense of [[objectification]], [[submissiveness]] and [[erotic helplessness]] for the subject, which can be erotically stimulating for them and for those observing them. Rope suspension is sometimes done as [[performance art]] at BDSM conventions and [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]-themed [[nightclub]]s.

Suspension can alternatively create a sense of liberation in that one can "fly" around the room, and some styles of rigging are optimal for the suspendee to have control over their spin rate, body position, and general activities. Trance-like states are also common, resulting alternatively or simultaneously from the sensations of 'anti-gravity", the heightened awareness of one's body, and the sacrifice of one's natural physical strengths.

== Three main positions ==
The three main suspension positions are vertical, horizontal and inverted.

=== Vertical suspension ===

This primarily involves the person being lifted from the ground by their wrists. This is usually achieved by use of rope or by special [[Bondage cuffs|suspension cuffs]]. When using rope, extreme damage can be caused to the soft tissues of the wrists, as well as reducing circulation, so being suspended by ropes can only normally be achieved for a very short period of time. Often in fiction and movies a person may be pictured hanging from metal cuffs or [[handcuffs]]. This is possible, although extremely painful and will leave deep marks in the wrists. The safest and "most comfortable" method of suspension by the wrists is to use suspension cuffs as they are specifically designed to spread the weight around the wrist as much as possible.

An alternative method of vertical suspension is to use a [[bondage rope harness]]. With the ropes tied around the body and in particular around the upper arms close to the shoulders as well as around the upper leg and through the groin, it is possible to suspend a person with ropes attached to these areas similar to the way a parachute is attached to a person. In this position the arms and legs may be left to hang free, as the person would have great difficulty getting free without assistance.

[[Image:model-in-suspension.jpg|thumb|left|Horizontal suspension, face up.]]

=== Horizontal suspension ===
[[File:Model in suspended hogtie.jpg|thumb|right|A woman hanging horizontally in a "teardrop" [[hogtie]].]]
[[File:Topless suspension bondage at BoundCon 2013.jpg|thumb|right|A woman in horizontal suspension using [[rope bondage]] at [[BoundCon]] 2013. Since the submissive's arms are tied here, it is important for safety that the rope is strong and does not break.]]
This position has the subject bound in a horizontal position, sometimes face up but usually face down. The body is lifted into this position either by attaching bondage equipment to the wrists and ankles, or to other areas of the body, or a mixture of both, with the subject's weight born by these areas. The ankles or wrists may be brought together or kept apart by a [[spreader bar]]. In case of the wrists and ankles ropes or suspension cuffs can be used. When the body itself is used to suspend the person, they may first be tied into a conventional bondage position such as a hogtie or ball tie, then by attaching ropes or chains to ropes under areas of the body able to take weight the person is lifted into the air.

A variation on this position is to secure the wrists to either the spreader bar or to a securing point between their ankles forming a [[hogtie bondage|hogtie]], resulting in what is called a suspension bow. In this position, if the subject is a female and facing down, her breasts would be pointing almost straight down depending on the strictness of the position, and [[nipple clamps]] and weights can be added for painful stimulation. The clamps may alternatively be secured to a point on the floor, limiting the subject's ability to struggle or move at all without causing pain.

=== Inverted suspension ===
[[File:2014 WGT 260 Umbra Et Imago.jpg|thumb|left|A woman hanging in inverted suspension at [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen]] music festival, Germany, 2014. On the right is her [[bondage rigger]].]]
Being suspended upside down can be a very hard position to maintain as a result of the position causing the blood to rush to the head. This means that this position probably cannot be maintained for any length of time and can even lead to the person blacking out.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} To be suspended in this position, ropes or suspension cuffs are used to lift the person into the air by their ankles.

Unlike when a person is suspended by their wrists, rope suspension around the ankles can be maintained for much longer as the ankle region naturally is able to take far more weight and stress than the wrists. This is especially so if boots are used as the ropes can run around the outside surface of the boot thus protecting the skin from damage. The person may be suspended with their legs together, or held apart either by using a spreader bar or by securing the ankles to two separate locations. With the legs held in this position, the subject may have an increased sense of vulnerability as their genital region would be easily accessible.

==Risks==
{{Cquote|The risks of rope suspension rank up there with heavy breath play. Heck, rope suspensions can turn into heavy breath play scenes if not careful.|||[[Midori (author)|Midori]]|''Thoughts on Rope Suspension''}}
The danger most often associated with suspension bondage, over and above the usual risks inherent in bondage, is falling; whether due to a weak suspension point, faulty equipment or poor technique. Inverted positions are especially hazardous in this regard since a head-first fall of only a few inches can kill or [[paralysis|paralyze]] a person. Less obvious dangers include [[nerve]] compression and resulting damage, circulation problems and fainting, and the recently recognized [[harness hang syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Federation Francaise de Speleologie | title = Harness Induced Pathology | work = Petzl Work/Rescue Catalog | year = 1997 | url = http://www.caves.org/grotto/nag/html/harness.html | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051216185233/http://www.caves.org/grotto/nag/html/harness.html | archivedate = 16 December 2005 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Paul Seldon | title = Harness suspension: review and evaluation of existing information | publisher=UK Health and Safety Executive | work=Contract Research Report 451 | year = 2002 | url = http://www.hse.gov.uk/RESEARCH/crr_pdf/2002/crr02451.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; Harness hang syndrome appears to relate to suspension with the legs below the heart, as in the case when someone is suspended in a standing position, with no weight on their legs. Extracting a person safely out of suspension bondage can be difficult if they are unconscious, or if a winch or hoist jams. Suspension tops will often work with spotters who can help get the person down in an emergency.

== Experts ==
Suspension bondage is a difficult subject to find information on.  
While many famous riggers regularly perform suspensions, they have expressed hesitation in committing such knowledge for dissemination, due to the increased risk of injury to amateurs attempting to imitate without enough prior research or practice.  

Most suspension bondage educational material is found on the web, however there are a couple of books available.
Douglas Kent's Complete Shibari Volume 2: Sky (2010) is a bondage suspension guide companion to his Complete Shibari Volume 1: Land (2010) which focuses on the basic knots and ties of rope bondage.
[[Go Arisue]]'s Kinbaku Theory And Practices (2008) is written in Japanese, the extensive color photographs and step by step guide provide an incredible pictorial resource.

'''Thanksgivukkah''' is a holiday name [[portmanteau]] [[neologism]] given to the convergence of the American holiday of [[Thanksgiving (United States)|'''Thanksgiv'''ing]] and the first day (and second night) of the [[Jewish holiday]] of [[Hanukkah|Han'''ukkah''']] on Thursday, November 28, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christine Byrne |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/thanksgivukkah |title=How To Celebrate Thanksgivukkah, The Best Holiday Of All Time |publisher=Buzzfeed |date=October 2, 2013 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stu Bykofsky |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20131011_Thanks_for_Thanukkah_.html |title=Thanks for Thanukkah! |publisher= Philadelphia Daily News |date=October 22, 2012 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/11/ART2/512/470.html |author=אלכס דורון וצביקה קליין |title=אירוע נדיר: חנוכה וחג ההודיה מתאחדים |language=Hebrew |publisher=''[[Maariv (newspaper)|Maariv]]'' |date= October 11, 2013|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the result of a rare coincidence between the [[lunisolar]] [[Hebrew calendar]] (whose dates reflect both the [[moon phase]] and the time of the [[solar year]], and which  can have between 353 and 385 days per year) and the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite news|author=Katy Steinmetz |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/11/01/everything-you-need-to-know-about-thanksgivukkah/ |title=What Is Thanksgivukkah? |publisher=TIME |date=November 1, 2013 |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/dining/index.ssf/2013/10/thanksgivukkah.html |author=Vicki Hyman |title=Thanksgivukkah: New traditions for a Thanksgiving nosh |publisher=The Star-Ledger |date=October 14, 2013 |accessdate=October 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thanksgivukkahboston.com/four-questions-with-jonathan-mizrahi-jewish-calendar-math-whiz/ |author=Molly Parr|title=Four Questions with Jonathan Mizrahi, Jewish Calendar Math Whiz &amp;#124; Thanksgivukkah |publisher=Thanksgivukkahboston.com |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Colbert&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/1.551699 |title=WATCH: Stephen Colbert laments Thanksgivukkah |publisher=''[[Haaretz]]'' |date=March 6, 2013 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the calendars are not calculated the same way, Hanukkah appears at a different time each year on the Gregorian calendar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ben Popken |url=http://www.today.com/money/chanukah-thanksgiving-mash-create-thanksgivukkah-8C11371625 |title=Chanukah and Thanksgiving mash-up to create 'Thanksgivukkah' |publisher=TODAY |date=September 19, 2013 |accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sharyn Jackson |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/08/thanksgivukkah-holiday/3478023/ |title=Thanksgivukkah pulls a chair up to the table |publisher=USA Today |date=March 11, 2013 |accessdate=November 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Thanksgivukkah" was trademarked by Dana Gitell, a [[Boston]]-area resident who, along with her sister-in-law, Deborah Gitell, created a [[Facebook]] page and a [[Twitter]] account devoted to the phenomenon and bought the URL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thanksgivukkahboston.com/four-questions-with-dana-gitell-creator-of-thanksgivukkah-com/ |author=Molly Parr|title=Four Questions with Dana Gitell, Creator of Thanksgivukkah.com |publisher=Thanksgivukkahboston.com |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bostonmagazine1"/&gt;  ''[[Boston Magazine]]'' reported that the idea was popular all over the U.S.&lt;ref name="bostonmagazine1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/blog/2013/10/17/thanksgivukkah-holiday-massachusetts-celebration/ |author=Steve Annear|title=Thanksgivukkah: Massachusetts Coins Term For Rare Holiday Celebration; Thanksgiving and Hanukkah won’t fall on the same day for another 76,000 years, so people are making sure they celebrate with pride. |publisher=Boston Magazine |date=October 5, 2013 |accessdate=October 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been some disagreement about the name: the [[Manischewitz]] company, the country’s top producer of [[kosher]] food, has spelled the dual-holiday with one fewer "k" towards the end, as “Thanksgivukah”;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt; and Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' posed the question: "Why 'Thanksgivukkah'? Why not 'Chanksgiving?'".&lt;ref name="haaretz1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaplan |first=Allison |url=http://www.haaretz.com/blogs/routine-emergencies/.premium-1.552131 |title=Hanukkah occupies Thanksgiving: Colbert hates it, Jews love it |publisher=''[[Haaretz]]'' |date=October 13, 2013 |accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Haaretz'' points to a clip from ''[[The O.C.]]'', the source of the portmanteau "[[Chrismukkah]]", as the basis of the "Thanksgivukkah" portmanteau.

==History==

Thanksgiving Day fell during Hanukkah at least twice between 1863 (when Thanksgiving was proclaimed a [[Federal holidays in the United States|U.S. federal holiday]] by [[President Abraham Lincoln]]) and 2013: in 1888 Thanksgiving was the first day of Hanukkah, and in 1899 it was the fourth day.&lt;ref name="jpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Thanksgivukka-Please-pass-the-turkey-stuffed-doughnuts-331952|work=Jerusalem Post|title= Thanksgivukka: Please pass the turkey-stuffed doughnuts|author=Amy Spiro|date=November 17, 2013|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.timeanddate.com/calendar/?year=1918&amp;country=34 |title=Calendar for the 1918, with a list of Jewish holidays below it |accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1888 coincidence of Thanksgiving and Hanukkah attracted some media attention at the time, with the ''[[New York Herald]]'' reporting on joint Thanksgiving–Hanukkah services held in "various synagogues" and a sermon given by Rabbi [[Frederick de Sola Mendes]].&lt;ref name="nyherald"&gt;{{citation|title=Twin Festivals: A Memorable Day for the Hebrews of New York|newspaper=New York Herald|date=November 30, 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanksgiving occurred later in 1888 and 1899 than is possible under current U.S. law: as a result of changes between 1939 and 1941, Thanksgiving is always held on the fourth Thursday in November. The last time the fourth Thursday of November fell within Hanukkah before 2013 was in 1861, before Thanksgiving existed.&lt;ref name="fwd"&gt;http://forward.com/articles/187288/lets-celebrate-the-convergence-of-thanksgiving-and/&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this confusion, some media reports have mistakenly claimed that Thanksgivukkah had ''never'' occurred prior to 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4438178,00.html |author= Levi Brackman|title=American Jews ready for Thanksgivukkah |publisher=Ynetnews.com |date= October 23, 2013|accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/eats/kutsher-tribeca-celebrates-thanksgivukkah-feast-article-1.1471942  |author=Justin Silverman |title=When Chanukah and Thanksgiving fall on the same day, it's "Thanksgivukkah" |publisher=New York Daily News |date=October 1, 2013 |accessdate=October 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gene-marks/5-reasons-why-thanksgivin_b_4083898.html |title=5 Reasons Why Thanksgiving Has Been Ruined For Millions Of Jews |author=Gene Marks |publisher=Huffington Post |date= November 10, 2013|accessdate=October 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Gregorian and Jewish calendars have slightly different average year lengths, over time they drift out of sync with each other. As a result of this, the first day of Hanukkah will not precede or coincide with Thanksgiving Day again in the foreseeable future.

==Products and shopping==
Thanksgivukkah was characterized by products promoted on and sold online.

==Similarities between Thanksgiving and Hanukkah==
While the imagery and products surrounding the day were light-hearted, advocates contended it had a broader significance resonant with American democracy. “There are amazing similarities between the [[Pilgrims (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]]’ quest for religious freedom and what the [[Maccabees]] were fighting for,” one advocate told the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', referring to the Hanukkah story of [[Judah Maccabee]], who led the [[Hebrews]]’ fight for freedom from and military victory over the [[Seleucid Empire|Greeks]] in the 2nd century BC.&lt;ref name="marketwatch1"/&gt; “This a great opportunity for [[Jewish American]]s to celebrate this country and for everyone to acknowledge the greatness of our shared [[religious freedom]]s.”&lt;ref name="nydailynews1"/&gt;  In 1888, the ''[[New York Herald]]'' wrote that "The two festivals merged well together," describing Hanukkah as "a thanksgiving festival for deliverance from… tyranny".&lt;ref name="nyherald"/&gt; A "Thanksgivukkah Manifesto" has been penned, claiming that it is the ideal holiday for increasingly secular American Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Mishael Zion, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-mishael-zion/a-thanksgivukkah-manifest_b_4214556.html A Thanksgivukkah Manifesto], Huffington Post, retrieved November 5, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, some have claimed that both Hanukkah&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Maccabees|10:6|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thanksgiving&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seiglie|first=Mario|title=Is Thanksgiving Rooted in a Biblical Festival?|journal=The Good News|date=November 2011|url=http://www.ucg.org/holidays-and-holy-days/thanksgiving-rooted-biblical-festival/|accessdate=November 28, 2013|publisher=United Church of God}}&lt;/ref&gt; have roots in the Jewish harvest festival of [[Sukkot]].&lt;ref name="fwd"/&gt;

==Similar holidays==
''[[Chrismukkah]]'' is a portmanteau neologism referring to the merging of the holidays of [[Christianity]]'s [[Christmas|'''Chris'''t'''m'''as]] and [[Judaism]]'s Han'''ukkah'''. The term was popularized by the TV drama ''[[The O.C.]]'' Chrismukkah is also celebrated as an ironic, alternative holiday.&lt;ref name = McCarthy&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=McCarthy |title=Have a merry little Chrismukkah |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2004-12-15-chrismukkah_x.htm |work=USA TODAY |date=December 16, 2004 |accessdate=December 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar neologisms such as ''Chrismahanukwanzakah''&lt;ref&gt;Amann, Joseph and Tom Breuer (2007).

Cincinnati Magazine 39(3): 66. {{ISSN|0746-8210}}.&lt;/ref&gt; blend Christmas, Hanukkah, and [[Kwanzaa]].
In "''A Kosher Christmas: 'Tis the Season to Be Jewish''" (Rutgers University Press, 2012), author Rabbi Joshua Eli Plaut discusses the phenomenon of hybrid Jewish holidays such as Chrismukkah during the December holiday season in the US, and the Americanization of Hanukkah and the holiday season for Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akosherchristmas.org |title=. |publisher=www.akosherchristmas.org |date=November 30, 2012 |accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akosherchristmas.wordpress.com/ |title=A Kosher Christmas &amp;#124; 'Tis the Season to be Jewish |publisher=Akosherchristmas.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:View of Asramam Maidan, Kollam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Asramam Maidan]] in [[Kollam]] city, [[India]]. It is the largest open space available in any of the city limits in [[Kerala]] state.]]
In [[land use planning]], '''urban open space''' is [[open space reserve|open space]] areas for "parks," "green spaces," and other open areas&lt;ref&gt;Ranasinghe ,WC and Hemakumara, GPTS(2018),  Spatial modelling of the householders' perception and assessment of the potentiality to improve the urban green coverage in residential areas: A case study from Issadeen Town Matara, Sri Lanka, Ruhuna Journal of Science,Vol 9(1); http://rjs.ruh.ac.lk/index.php/rjs/article/view/174&lt;/ref&gt;. The landscape of urban open spaces can range from [[playing field]]s to highly maintained environments to relatively [[natural landscape]]s. Generally considered open to the public, urban open spaces are sometimes privately owned, such as [[campus|higher education campuses]], [[community gardening|neighborhood/community parks/gardens]], and institutional or corporate grounds. Areas outside city boundaries, such as [[state park|state]] and [[national park]]s as well as open space in the countryside, are not considered urban open space. Streets, piazzas, plazas and urban squares are not always defined as urban open space in land use planning.

== Scope ==

The term "urban open space" can describe many types of open areas.&lt;ref&gt;Alfirevic Djordje, Simonovic-Alfirevic Sanja. ''[https://www.academia.edu/26596496/Interpretations_of_Space_Within_Space_Concept_in_Contemporary_Open-Plan_Architecture_Primena_koncepta_prostor_u_prostoru_u_savremenoj_arhitekturi_otvorenog_plana_ Interpretations of Space Within Space Concept in Contemporary Open-Plan Architecture / Primena koncepta prostor u prostoru u savremenoj arhitekturi otvorenog plana]''. Arhitektura i urbanizam (Belgrade), No.42 (2016), pp.&amp;nbsp;24–40.&lt;/ref&gt;  One definition holds that, "As the counterpart of development, urban open space is a natural and cultural resource, synonymous with neither 'unused land' nor 'park and recreation areas." Another is "Open space is land and/or water area with its surface open to the sky, consciously acquired or publicly regulated to serve conservation and urban shaping function in addition to providing recreational opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;Marilyn.  "Decision Making in Allocating Metropolitan Open Space: State of the Art."  Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science 1975.  pp 149–153.&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all instances, the space referred to by the term is, in fact, green space.  However, there are examples of urban green space which, though not publicly owned/regulated, are still considered urban open space.

From another standpoint public space in general is defined as the meeting or gathering places that exist outside the home and workplace that are generally accessible by members of the public, and which foster resident interaction and opportunities for contact and proximity.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Francis | first1 = Jacinta | last2 = Giles-Corti | first2 = Billie | last3 = Wood | first3 = Lisa | last4 = Knuiman | first4 = Matthew | year = 2012 | title = Creating sense of community: The role of public space | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | volume = 32 | issue = 4| pages = 401–409 | doi = 10.1016/j.jenvp.2012.07.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition implies a higher level of community interaction and places a focus on public involvement rather than public ownership or stewardship.[[File:WashingtonPark.jpg|right|thumb|Washington Park in [[Troy, New York|Troy, NY]], U.S., an example of privately owned urban open space|alt=A grassy area with tall trees leaving shadows from the sun above.

== Benefits ==
The benefits that urban open space provides to citizens can be broken into three basic forms; recreation, ecology, and aesthetic value. Psychological benefits gained by visitors to urban green spaces increased with their biodiversity,&lt;ref name="fuller"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuller|first1=R.A.|last2=Irvine|first2=K.N.|last3=Devine-Wright|first3=P.|last4=Warren|first4=P.H.|last5=Gaston|first5=K.J.|year=2007|title=Psychological benefits of green-space increase with biodiversity|url=|journal=Biology Letters|volume=3|issue=4|pages=390–394|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2007.0149|pmc=2390667|pmid=17504734}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that 'green' alone is not sufficient; the quality of that green is important as well.

===Recreational===

[[Image:Slovakia Bratislava 947.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sad Janka Kráľa]] park in [[Bratislava]] (Slovakia)]]
Urban open space is often appreciated for the recreational opportunities it provides.  Recreation in urban open space may include active recreation (such as organized sports and individual exercise) or passive recreation, which may simply entail being in the open space. Research shows that when open spaces are attractive and accessible, people are more likely to engage in physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Hartig, Terry.  "Three steps to understanding restorative environments as health resources."  Open Space People Space.  Ed. Catharine Ward Thompson and Penny Travlou.  London: Taylor and Francis, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Time spent in an urban open space for recreation offers a reprieve from the urban environment and a break from over-stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Marc G., John Jonides, and Stephen Kaplan. "The cognitive benefits of interacting with nature." Psychological science 19.12 (2008): 1207-1212.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies done on physically active adults middle aged and older show there are amplified benefits when the physical activities are coupled with green space environments. Such coupling leads to decreased levels of stress, lowers the risk for depression as well as increase the frequency of participation in exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Astell-Burt, Thomas, Xiaoqi Feng, and Gregory S. Kolt. "Mental health benefits of neighbourhood green space are stronger among physically active adults in middle-toolder age: evidence from 260,061 Australians." Preventive medicine 57.5 (2013): 601606.&lt;/ref&gt; Casual group walks in a green environment (nature walks) increase one's positive attitude and lower stress levels as well as risk of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Richard|year=2013|title=Is physical activity in natural environments better for mental health than physical activity in other environments?.|url=|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=91|issue=|pages=130–134|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2012.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Ecological===
The [[conservation (ethic)|conservation of nature]] in an urban environment has direct impact on people for another reason as well.  A Toronto civic affairs bulletin entitled ''Urban Open Space: Luxury or Necessity'' makes the claim that "popular awareness of the balance of nature, of natural processes and of man’s place in and effect on nature – i.e., "ecological awareness" – is important.  As humans live more and more in man-made surroundings – i.e., cities – he risks harming himself by building and acting in ignorance of natural processes."  Beyond this man-nature benefit, urban open spaces also serve as islands of nature, promoting [[biodiversity]] and providing a home for natural species in environments that are otherwise uninhabitable due to city development.

In a sense, by having the opportunity to be within a natural urban green space people gain a higher appreciation for the nature around them. As Bill McKibben mentions in his book ''The End of Nature'', people will only truly understand nature if they are immersed within it. He follows in Henry David Thoreau's footsteps when he isolated himself in the Adirondack Mountains in order to get away from society and the overwhelming ideals it carries. Even there he writes how society and human impact follows him as he sees airplanes buzzing overhead or hears the roar of motorboats in the distance.

===Aesthetic===
The [[aesthetic value]] of urban open spaces is self-evident.  People enjoy viewing nature, especially when it is otherwise extensively deprived, as is the case in urban environments.  Therefore, open space offers the value of "substituting gray infrastructure."&lt;ref name="Eysenbach, Mary 2008"&gt;Eysenbach, Mary.  "Park System Function and Services." From Recreation to Re-creation.  American Planning Association, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; One researcher states how attractive neighborhoods contribute to positive attitudes and social norms that encourage walking and community values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ward Thompson | first1 = Catharine | year = 2013 | title = Activity, exercise and the planning and design of outdoor spaces | url = | journal = Journal of Environmental Psychology | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 79–96 | doi = 10.1016/j.jenvp.2013.01.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Properties near urban open space tend to have a higher value. One study was able to demonstrate that, “a pleasant view can lead to a considerable increase in house price, particularly if the house overlooks water (8–10%) or open space (6–12%).”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Luttik|first1=Joke|year=2000|title=The value of trees, water and open space as reflected by house prices in the Netherlands|url=|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|volume=48|issue=3–4|pages=161–167|doi=10.1016/S0169-2046(00)00039-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain benefits may be derived from exposure to virtual versions of the natural environment, too. For example, people who were shown pictures of scenic, natural environments had increased brain activity in the region associated with recalling happy memories, compared to people that were shown pictures of urban landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = Gwang-Won | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2010 | title = Functional neuroanatomy associated with natural and urban scenic views in the human brain: 3.0 T functional MR imaging | url = | journal = Korean Journal of Radiology | volume = 11 | issue = 5| pages = 507–513 | doi=10.3348/kjr.2010.11.5.507}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

=== Ancient Rome ===
The term "rus in urbe" meaning "country in the city" was used in Rome around the first century C.E.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://urbanrambles.org/background/a-brief-history-of-rus-in-urbe-1307|title=A brief history of urban green spaces|date=2015-12-28|work=Urban Rambles|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urban planning]] in Rome valued the natural landscape and took account for environmental factors. It was thought that by building a city with regard to the local countryside, the people living there would be healthier and happier.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-07-01|title=The environmental elements of foundations in Roman cities: A theory of the architect Gaetano Vinaccia|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2210670716305686|journal=Sustainable Cities and Society|language=en|volume=32|pages=42–55|doi=10.1016/j.scs.2017.03.002|issn=2210-6707}}&lt;/ref&gt; English landscapes would later take inspiration from Roman urban planning concepts in their own open spaces.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2011-03-15|title=Linking landscape and health: The recurring theme|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204610002860|journal=Landscape and Urban Planning|language=en|volume=99|issue=3-4|pages=187–195|doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2010.10.006|issn=0169-2046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== London===
[[London]] has a long history of urban open space, which has significantly influenced development of modern parks, and is still among the greenest capital cities in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitlondon.com/areas/parks/ Explore London with our Interactive Map Tool]. visitlondon.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis for many urban open spaces seen today across Europe and the West began its process of development in London in the 17th and 18th centuries.  What would eventually become urban open green space began as [[plaza|paved public plazas]].  Though they were intended to be open to the public, these spaces began to be re-designated as private parks around the late eighteenth century.  It was during this period that the areas became pockets of green in the urban environment, commonly modelled after the natural wild of the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Henry W.  The Greening of Squares of London: Transformation of Urban Landscapes and Ideals.  Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Vol. 83, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first parks to reverse the trend of privatization and again be opened to the public were England’s [[Royal Parks of London|royal parks]] in the nineteenth century.  This was done in response to the extensive and unexpected population movement from the country into cities.  As a result, "the need for open space was socially and politically pressing… The problems, to which the provision of parks was expected to offer some relief, were easy to describe: overcrowding, poverty, squalor, ill-health, lack of morals and morale, and so on".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Hilary A..  Garden History. "Urban Public Parks, 1840–1900: Design and Meaning".  1995.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such sentiments again received significant popular support during the "[[City Beautiful movement|City Beautiful]]" movement in America during the 1890s and 1900s.  Both trends focused on providing the public an opportunity to receive all of the perceived health and lifestyle benefits of having access to open space within urban environments.

== Current trends ==
Segmentation of urban open spaces was particularly prominent in America during the twentieth century.  Since the late 1800's romantic park systems, open space designers have been concerned with guiding, containing or separating urban growth, distributing recreation, and/or producing scenic amenity, mostly within the framework of geometric abstractions."&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, William H.  "Design of Metropolitan Open Space Based on Natural Process." Metropolitan Open Space and Natural Process.  Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;
Such segmentation was especially prominent in the 1990s, when urban open spaces took a path similar to that of parks, following the modernization trend of segmentation and specialization of areas.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Terence.  "Modern Urban Parks."  Geographical Review 1995.  Pp 535–551&lt;/ref&gt; As modernity stressed "increased efficiency, quantifiablity, predictability, and control… In concert with the additional social divisions" (Young 1995), open spaces grew more specific in purpose.  Perhaps this increase in division of social classes’ use of open space, demonstrated by the segmentation of the spaces, displays a situation similar to the privatization of London parks in the eighteenth century, which displayed a desire to make classes more distinct.

Today, places like [[Scandinavia]], which do not have a significant history of outdoor recreation and gathering places,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} are seeing a proliferation of urban open spaces and adopting a lifestyle supported by the extra urban breathing room.  An example of this can be seen in [[Copenhagen]] where an area closed to car traffic in 1962 developed, in just a few decades, a culture of public political gatherings and outdoor cafes emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Gehl, Jan. "Public Spaces for a Changing Public Life." Open Space People Space.  Ed. Catharine Ward Thompson and Penny Travlou.  London: Taylor and Francis, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not only is appreciation for and use of urban open spaces flourishing in locations that historically lacked such traditions, the number of urban open spaces is increasing rapidly as well.

== Inequalities ==
Urban open space is under strong pressure. Due to increasing [[urbanization]], combined with a spatial planning policy of [[densification]], more people face the prospect of living in less green residential environments, especially people from low economic strata. This may cause [[Open Space Accessibility in California|environmental inequality]] with regard to the distribution of (access) to public green space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Groenewegen | first1 = PP | last2 = den Berg | first2 = AE | last3 = de Vries | first3 = S | last4 = Verheij | first4 = RA | last5 = Vitamin | first5 = G | year = 2006 | title = Effects of green space on health, well-being, and social safety | url = | journal = BMC Public Health | volume = 6 | issue = | page = 149 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2458-6-149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large epidemiological study &lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, R. and Popham, F. "Effect of exposure to natural environment on health inequalities: an observational population study." (2008) The Lancet 372(9650):pp. 1655-1660&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that wealthier individuals were generally healthier than individuals with a lower income, explained by the pattern that wealthier individuals reside in areas more concentrated with green space.  Urban open spaces in higher socioeconomic neighborhoods were also more likely to have trees that provided shade, a water feature (e.g. pond, lake and creek), walking and cycling paths, lighting, signage regarding dog access and signage restricting other activities as well.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;David Crawford, Anna Timperio, Billie Giles-Corti, Kylie Ball, Clare Hume, Rebecca Roberts, Nick Andrianopoulos, Jo Salmon, Do features of public open spaces vary according to neighbourhood socio-economic status?, ''Health &amp; Place'', Volume 14, Issue 4, December 2008, Pages 889-893 doi 10.1016/j.healthplace.2007.11.002.
&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted in Australia provided insight into how there is a correlation between community development/community safety and natural open space within the community. Open areas allow community members to engage in highly social activities and facilitate the expansion of social networks and friendship development. As people become more social they decrease the perceptions of fear and mistrust allowing a sense of community bondage.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org" /&gt;

'''Vincas Mickevičius''' (October 19, 1882 – July 17, 1954), better known by his [[pen name]] '''Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius''', was a [[Lithuania]]n [[writer]], [[poet]], [[novelist]], [[playwright]] and [[philologist]]. He is also known as '''Vincas Krėvė''', the shortened name he used in the United States.

==Biography==
Vincas Mickevičius was born to a family of peasant farmers on October 19, 1882, in the village of [[Subartonys]] in [[Dzūkija]] [[Regions of Lithuania|ethnographic region]] of Lithuania.  His family was called ''Krėvė'' by the local villagers, name that he later used for his pen name.  The customs and traditions of his native district were a constant source of the inspiration for his literary work.

In 1898, he became a student for the Roman Catholic priesthood at the [[Vilnius Seminary]], but in 1900 he was expelled from the seminary. In 1904, he enrolled the [[Kiev University|University of Kiev]].  However, a year later, the university was temporarily closed due to the revolutionary conditions in the [[Imperial Russia|Russian Empire]], and Krėvė-Mickevičius, unwilling to interrupt his studies, entered the [[Lviv University|University of Lviv]], in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], which was at the time part of the [[Austrian Empire]], and in 1908, he received his doctorate in [[philology]].  That same year, the University of Kiev awarded him a gold medal for his thesis on the original home of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-Europeans]].  In 1913, the University of Kiev awarded him the degree of Master of [[Comparative Linguistics]] for his dissertation on the origin of the names ''[[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'' and ''Pratjekabuddha''.

In 1909, Krėvė-Mickevičius became a high school teacher in the city of [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].  Three years later he assisted in founding the [[University of Baku|People's University of Baku]], and delivered lectures there.

Lithuania achieved independence in 1918, and a year later, Krėvė-Mickevičius became Lithuanian Consul in Azerbaijan.  In 1920, he returned to Lithuania, and settled in [[Kaunas]], which at the time was the [[temporary capital]].

When the [[Kaunas University|University of Lithuania]] was founded in 1922, Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius became professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures, and remained there as part of the faculty for the following two decades.

His first attempts on writing came at the age fifteen, at first using [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]] languages; however, after 1902, he wrote in [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]].  The first volume of his collected works was published in 1921, at which time he was already a well-known and respected figure, serving as editor of several academic and literary periodicals.

On 24 June 1940, he was appointed as Prime Minister of Lithuania by acting President [[Justas Paleckis]].  He headed the "[[People's Government of Lithuania]]", which was formed essentially as a [[rubber stamp]] for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] takeover of Lithuania. On July 1, 1940 he, together with some other communists, visited [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] (prime minister of the USSR) and asked for full annexation of Lithuania into the USSR (this visit was later used as the pretext for that de jure annexation, although occupation and the de facto annexation happened before that). On returning, he offered his resignation, which was not accepted at the time.

After the start of the Nazi occupation of Lithuania in 1941, and the closing of higher educational institutions in 1943, Krėvė-Mickevičius went into hiding.  Soviet forces reoccupied Lithuania in 1944, at which point he fled the country and settled in a [[displaced persons camp]] at Glasenbach, near [[Salzburg]], Austria. There, he taught at the local camp's high school.  In 1947, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] extended an invitation to join its faculty. There, he served as an Assistant Professor of Slavic Languages and Literatures until 1953, when he retired.  On July 17, 1954, Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius died in [[Broomall, Pennsylvania]], United States.

He was considered as a candidate for the [[Nobel Prize]] in Literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Laisvės ir literatūros hipostazės|journal=Mokslo Lietuva|year=2000|first=Arvydas|last=Genys|coauthors=|volume=|issue=4|pages=|id=|url=http://ic.lms.lt/ml/206/laisves.htm|accessdate=2007-09-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225452/http://ic.lms.lt/ml/206/laisves.htm|archive-date=2007-09-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
The literary production of Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius is wide and varied. It included historical dramas, collections of folklore, short stories and sketches of village life, novels on contemporary problems, and tales based on oriental themes. At his death he was engaged on a major work entitled ''Sons of Heaven and Earth'', which defies classification.  It is written partly as drama and partly as a narration; its subjects are biblical with the action taking place in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] at the beginning of the Christian era.  His work filled with a romantic impulse, drawing attention to rural life and oriental themes, is balanced with realistic narration and description.  His writing is characterized by an unusually large vocabulary with remarkable purity. Some scholars sustain that Lithuanian language acquired a range of expression through his works only rivaled by that of [[Ancient Greece]].

'''William John Gruffydd''' (1916 – 21 April 2011),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anhourago.co.uk/show.aspx?l=8402546&amp;d=501 "Poet WJ Gruffydd dies, aged 94"]&lt;/ref&gt; better known by his [[bardic name]] of '''Elerydd''', was a [[Wales|Welsh]] Baptist minister and poet who served as [[Archdruid]] of the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] between 1984 and 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumwales.ac.uk/en/894/?display_mode=text National Museum of Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all Archdruids, Elerydd was himself the winner of a major prize at the National Eisteddfod, in his case the crown at the [[Pwllheli]] Eisteddfod in 1955 and at [[Cardiff]] in 1960.

'''Zaiwa''' (autonym: ''{{IPA|tsau˧˩va˥˩}}''; Tsaiwa, Tsaiva, 载瓦) is a [[Burmish language]] spoken in parts of [[China]] and [[Burma]]. There are around 100,000 speakers. It is also known as ''Atsi'', its name in [[Jingpho language|Jingpo]]. Other names for the language include Atzi, Azi, Aci, Aji, Atshi, Atsi-Maru, Maru, Zi, Tsaiwa, Szi and Xiaoshanhua.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://multitree.org/codes/atb|title=Atsi|last=|first=|date=|website=MultiTree|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pela language|Pela]] (Bola)'', with 400 speakers, was once classified as a dialect. From the 1950s Zaiwa was using Roman script. A Gospel of Mark was published in Zaiwa in 1938 in the [[Fraser alphabet]], and in 1951 in Roman script.&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2739675]&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/atb|title=Zaiwa|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
There are more than 70,000 Zaiwa speakers in Yunnan, China, including in:&lt;ref&gt;Xu Xijian 徐悉艰, Xu Guizhen 徐桂珍. Jingpozu Zaiwayu Jianzhi 景颇族载瓦语简志.&lt;/ref&gt;

*Zhanxi 盏西, [[Yingjiang County]], Dehong Prefecture
*Xishan 西山, [[Luxi County, Yunnan|Luxi County]], [[Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture|Honghe Prefecture]]

The ''[[Ethnologue]]'' lists Bengwa, Longzhun, and Tingzhu as dialects.

In Myanmar, the [[Sadon]] (Sadung) dialect is the standard variety (Yabu 1982).

== Tones ==
Zaiwa has five tones. Three of these five tones are in unchecked syllables and the remaining two are in checked syllables.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The tones are distinguished through a numbering system of one to five; one being the lowest pitch and five the highest pitch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Grammar and Dictionary of Zaiwa|last=Lustig|first=Anton|publisher=Brill|year=|isbn=9004184899|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
