'''Alessandro Giuseppe Antonio Anastasio Volta''' ({{IPA-it|alesˈsandro ˈvɔlta|lang}}; 18 February 1745 &amp;ndash; 5 March 1827) was an Italian [[physicist]], [[chemist]], and a pioneer of [[electricity]] and [[Power (physics)|power]],&lt;ref name = "wmnqsy"&gt;Giuliano Pancaldi, ''"Volta: Science and culture in the age of enlightenment"'', Princeton University Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "nxukip"&gt;Alberto Gigli Berzolari, ''"Volta's Teaching in Como and Pavia"'' - Nuova voltiana&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edisontechcenter.org/HallofFame.html Hall of Fame], Edison.&lt;/ref&gt; who is credited as the inventor of the [[electric battery]] and the discoverer of [[methane]]. He invented the [[Voltaic pile]] in 1799, and reported the results of his experiments in 1800 in a two-part letter to the President of the [[Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Milestones:Volta's Electrical Battery Invention, 1799 |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Volta%27s_Electrical_Battery_Invention,_1799 |website=ieeeghn.org |publisher=IEEE Global History Network|accessdate=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RoyalSocRef"&gt;{{cite web|title=Enterprise and electrolysis|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/2003/August/electrolysis.asp|website=rsc.org|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this invention Volta proved that electricity could be generated chemically and debunked the prevalent theory that electricity was generated solely by living beings. Volta's invention sparked a great amount of scientific excitement and led others to conduct similar experiments which eventually led to the development of the field of [[electrochemistry]].&lt;ref name="RoyalSocRef"/&gt;

Alessandro Volta also drew admiration from [[Napoleon|Napoleon Bonaparte]] for his invention, and was invited to the [[Institut de France|Institute of France]] to demonstrate his invention to the members of the Institute. Volta enjoyed a certain amount of closeness with the Emperor throughout his life and he was conferred numerous honours by him.&lt;ref name="ArchiveBook"/&gt; Alessandro Volta held the chair of experimental physics at the [[University of Pavia]] for nearly 40 years and was widely idolised by his students.&lt;ref name="ArchiveBook"/&gt;

Despite his professional success, Volta tended to be a person inclined towards domestic life and this was more apparent in his later years. At this time he tended to live secluded from public life and more for the sake of his family until his eventual death in 1827 from a series of illnesses which began in 1823.&lt;ref name="ArchiveBook"/&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit of [[electric potential]] is named in his honour as the [[volt]].

== Early life and works ==
Volta was born in [[Como]], a town in present-day northern [[Italy]], on 18 February 1745. In 1794, Volta married an aristocratic lady also from Como, Teresa Peregrini, with whom he raised three sons: Zanino, Flaminio, and Luigi. His father, Filippo Volta, was of noble lineage. His mother, Donna Maddalena, came from the family of the Inzaghis.&lt;ref name="Alessandrovolta.info_February_18_2015c"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alessandrovolta.info/life_and_works_8.html |title=Life and works |newspaper=Alessandrovolta.info |publisher=Editoriale srl |location=Como, Italy |accessdate= February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, he became a professor of physics at the Royal School in Como. A year later, he improved and popularised the [[electrophorus]], a device that produced [[static electricity]]. His promotion of it was so extensive that he is often credited with its invention, even though a machine operating on the same principle was described in 1762 by the Swedish experimenter [[Johan Wilcke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pancaldi|first=Giuliano|year= 2003|title=Volta, Science and Culture in the Age of Enlightenment|publisher=Princeton Univ. Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=hGoYB1Twx4sC&amp;pg=PA73|isbn=978-0-691-12226-7}}, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joh. Carl Wilcke (1762) "Ytterligare rön och försök om ''contraira electriciteterne'' vid laddningen och därtil hörande delar" (Additional findings and experiments on the opposing electric charges [that are created] during charging, and parts related thereto) ''Kongliga Svenska Vetenskaps Academiens Handlingar'' (Proceedings of the Royal Swedish Science Academy), vol. 23, pages [https://books.google.com/books?id=HHRJAAAAcAAJ&amp;lpg=PA210&amp;ots=z7rONACULS&amp;pg=PA202#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 206-229], 245–266.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1777, he travelled through Switzerland. There he befriended [[H. B. de Saussure]].

In the years between 1776 and 1778, Volta studied the [[chemistry]] of gases. He researched and discovered [[methane]] after reading a paper by [[Benjamin Franklin]] of the United States on "flammable air". In November 1776, he found methane at [[Lake Maggiore]],&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Volta, ''Lettere del Signor Don Alessandro Volta … Sull' Aria Inflammabile Nativa delle Paludi'' [Letters of Signor Don Alessandro Volta … on the flammable native air of the marshes] (Milan, (Italy):  Giuseppe Marelli, 1777).&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1778 he managed to isolate methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/methane-woc/ |title=Methane |publisher=BookRags |accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He devised experiments such as the [[combustion|ignition]] of methane by an electric [[Electrostatic discharge|spark]] in a closed vessel.

Volta also studied what we now call electrical [[capacitance]], developing separate means to study both electrical potential (''V'' ) and charge (''Q'' ), and discovering that for a given object, they are proportional.&lt;ref name=Williams2014&gt;{{cite book |author=Williams, Jeffrey Huw |title=Defining and Measuring Nature: The Make of All Things |year=2014 |publisher=Morgan &amp; Claypool |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPO9BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT76&amp;lpg=PT76&amp;dq=volta%27s+law+of+capacitance&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SM5BsYjTIX&amp;sig=eBtfeyO-XGN_dU8orDwoUSBQq4M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4crkVNeHOabPsQSJzYDAAw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-627-05278-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called Volta's Law of Capacitance, and it was for this work the unit of electrical potential has been named the [[volt]].&lt;ref name=Williams2014/&gt;

In 1779 he became a professor of experimental physics at the [[University of Pavia]], a chair that he occupied for almost 40 years.&lt;ref name=ArchiveBook&gt;{{cite book|author=Munro, John|title=Pioneers of Electricity; Or, Short Lives of the Great Electricians|year=1902|publisher=The Religious Tract Society| location = London|pages=89–102|url=https://archive.org/details/pioneerselectri00munrgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Volta and Galvani ==
[[File:Luigi Galvani, oil-painting.jpg|thumb|[[Luigi Galvani]], Volta's rival]]
[[Luigi Galvani]], an Italian physicist, discovered something he named, "animal electricity" when two different metals were connected in series with a frog's leg and to one another. Volta realised that the frog's leg served as both a conductor of electricity (what we would now call an [[electrolyte]]) and as a detector of electricity. He replaced the frog's leg with brine-soaked paper, and detected the flow of electricity by other means familiar to him from his previous studies.

In this way he discovered the [[electrochemical series]], and the law that the [[electromotive force]] (emf) of a [[galvanic cell]], consisting of a pair of metal [[electrode]]s separated by electrolyte, is the difference between their two electrode potentials (thus, two identical electrodes and a common electrolyte give zero net emf). This may be called Volta's Law of the electrochemical series.

In 1800, as the result of a professional disagreement over the galvanic response advocated by Galvani, Volta invented the [[voltaic pile]], an early [[Battery (electricity)|electric battery]], which produced a steady electric current.&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|title=A popular history of science|author=Robert Routledge|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VO1HAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA553|page=553 |edition=2nd|year=1881|publisher=G. Routledge and Sons|isbn=0-415-38381-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volta had determined that the most effective pair of dissimilar metals to produce electricity was [[zinc]] and [[copper]]. Initially he experimented with individual cells in series, each cell being a wine goblet filled with [[brine]] into which the two dissimilar electrodes were dipped. The voltaic pile replaced the goblets with cardboard soaked in brine.

== Early battery ==
[[File:Voltaic pile.svg|thumb|300px|A [[voltaic pile]]]]
In announcing his discovery of the voltaic pile, Volta paid tribute to the influences of [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], [[Tiberius Cavallo]], and [[Abraham Bennet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elliott, P. |title=Abraham Bennet F.R.S. (1749-1799): a provincial electrician in eighteenth-century England |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=59–78 |year=1999 |url=http://www.journals.royalsoc.ac.uk/content/klgdd0umcmvjqnpr/fulltext.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1098/rsnr.1999.0063 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The battery made by Volta is credited as one of the first electrochemical cells. It consists of two electrodes: one made of [[zinc]], the other of [[copper]]. The [[electrolyte]] is either [[sulfuric acid]] mixed with water or a form of saltwater [[brine]]. The electrolyte exists in the form 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;. The zinc, which is higher in the [[standard electrode potential (data page)|electrochemical series]] than both copper and hydrogen, reacts with the negatively charged sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). The positively charged hydrogen ions ([[proton]]s) capture [[electron]]s from the copper, forming bubbles of hydrogen gas, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This makes the zinc rod the negative electrode and the copper rod the positive electrode.

Thus, there are two terminals, and an [[electric current]] will flow if they are connected. The [[chemical reaction]]s in this voltaic cell are as follows:

:Zinc:
::Zn &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

:Sulfuric acid:
::2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The copper does not react, but rather it functions as an electrode for the electric current.

However, this cell also has some disadvantages. It is unsafe to handle, since sulfuric acid, even if diluted, can be hazardous. Also, the power of the cell diminishes over time because the hydrogen gas is not released. Instead, it accumulates on the surface of the copper electrode and forms a barrier between the metal and the electrolyte solution.

== Last years and retirement ==
[[File:Painting of Volta by Bertini (photo).jpeg|thumb|300px|Volta explains the principle of the ''"electric column"'' to [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] in 1801]]

In 1809 Volta became associated member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences|Royal Institute of the Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00003610 |title=Alessandro G.A.A. Volta (1745 - 1827) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=20 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In honour of his work, Volta was made a count by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1810.&lt;ref name = "wmnqsy"/&gt;

Volta retired in 1819 to his estate in Camnago, a [[frazione]] of [[Como, Italy]], now named "Camnago Volta" in his honour. He died there on 5 March 1827, just after his 82nd birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/volta.htm#end |title=Volta |publisher=Institute of Chemistry - Jerusalem |accessdate=1 May 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090408220853/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/history/volta.htm |archivedate= 8 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volta's remains were buried in Camnago Volta.&lt;ref&gt;For a photograph of his gravesite, and other Volta locales, see {{cite web |title=Volta's localities |url=http://www.corrieredicomo.it/pg_interna.cfm?IndiceID=526&amp;MenuID=2 |accessdate=20 June 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy ===
Volta's legacy is celebrated by the [[Tempio Voltiano]] memorial located in the public gardens by the lake. There is also a museum which has been built in his honour, which exhibits some of the equipment that Volta used to conduct experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Geek Atlas: 128 Places Where Science and Technology Come Alive |first=John |last=Graham-Cumming |chapter=Tempio Voltiano, Como, Italy |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2009 |isbn=9780596523206 |page=95 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HhEC0q-O1ewC&amp;pg=PA95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearby stands the [[Villa Olmo]], which houses the Voltian Foundation, an organization promoting scientific activities. Volta carried out his experimental studies and produced his first inventions near Como.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.centrovolta.it/volta-en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=63 | title=Villa Olmo | website=centrovolta.it | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210083231/http://www.centrovolta.it/volta-en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=63 | archivedate=10 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His image was depicted on the [[Italian lira|Italian 10,000 lira note]] (1990-1997) along with a sketch of his voltaic pile.&lt;ref name="Desmond2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Desmond|first=Kevin|title=Innovators in Battery Technology: Profiles of 95 Influential Electrochemists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gliiDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235|accessdate=17 February 2018|date=10 June 2016|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476622781|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious beliefs ==
Volta was raised as a Catholic and for all of his life continued to maintain his belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-29971?l=italian|title=Gli scienziati cattolici che hanno fatto lItalia (Catholic scientists who made Italy)|publisher=Zenit}}{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he was not ordained a clergyman as his family expected, he was sometimes accused of being irreligious and some people have speculated about his possible unbelief, stressing that "he did not join the Church",&lt;ref&gt;'Adam-Hart Davis. (2012). ''Engineers''. Penguin. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; or that he virtually "ignored the church's call".&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brian Schiffer (2003), ''Draw the Lightning Down: Benjamin Franklin and Electrical Technology in the Age of Enlightenment''. University of California Press. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, he cast out doubts in a declaration of faith in which he said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I do not understand how anyone can doubt the sincerity and constancy of my attachment to the religion which I profess, the Roman, Catholic and Apostolic religion in which I was born and brought up, and of which I have always made confession, externally and internally. I have, indeed, and only too often, failed in the performance of those good works which are the mark of a Catholic Christian, and I have been guilty of many sins: but through the special mercy of God I have never, as far as I know, wavered in my faith... In this faith I recognise a pure gift of God, a supernatural grace; but I have not neglected those human means which confirm belief, and overthrow the doubts which at times arise. I studied attentively the grounds and basis of religion, the works of apologists and assailants, the reasons for and against, and I can say that the result of such study is to clothe religion with such a degree of probability, even for the merely natural reason, that every spirit unperverted by sin and passion, every naturally noble spirit must love and accept it. May this confession which has been asked from me and which I willingly give, written and subscribed by my own hand, with authority to show it to whomsoever you will, for I am not ashamed of the Gospel, may it produce some good fruit!&lt;ref&gt;Kneller, Karl Alois, ''[https://archive.org/stream/christianitylead00knelrich#page/118/mode/2up Christianity and the leaders of modern science; a contribution to the history of culture in the nineteenth century]'' (1911), p. 117–118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alessandro Volta. 1955.

'''Bumper cars''' or '''dodgems''' is the generic name for a type of flat ride consisting of several small electrically powered cars which draw power from the floor and/or ceiling, and which are turned on and off remotely by an operator.  They are also known as '''bumping cars''', '''dodging cars''' and '''dashing cars'''.

==Design==
Power is commonly supplied by one of three methods:
* The oldest and most common method, called Over Head System (OHS), uses a conductive floor and ceiling, each with a separate power polarity. Contacts under the vehicle touch the floor while a pole-mounted contact touches the ceiling, forming a complete [[Electrical network|circuit]].
* A newer method, the Floor Pick-Up (FPU) system, uses alternating strips of [[metal]] across the floor separated by insulating spacers, and no ceiling grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physicsforums.com/showthread.php?t=459773 |title=How does this Electric Floor work? |publisher=physicsforums.com |accessdate=2014-08-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The alternating strips carry the supply current, and the cars are large enough so that the vehicle body can always cover at least two strips at any one time. An array of brushes under each car make random contact with whatever strip is below, and the voltage polarity on each contact is sorted out to always provide a correct and complete circuit to operate the vehicle.
* The bumper cars on the ''[[Quantum-class cruise ship|Quantum]]''-class cruise ships run on batteries. This avoids the conductive floor/ceiling of the traditional bumper cars setup, as the SeaPlex venue is to be readily convertible from a bumper cars ride to a multipurpose gym (basketball court). The disadvantage is that these ships' bumper cars take several hours to recharge their batteries.

[[File:Autotamponneuse.ogg|right|thumb|A ride in a bumper car, short video clip]]

The metal floor is usually set up as a rectangular or oval track, and [[graphite]] is sprinkled on the floor to decrease [[friction]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} A [[Elastomer|rubber]] [[Bumper (automobile)|bumper]] surrounds each vehicle, and drivers either ram or dodge each other as they travel. The controls are usually an [[accelerator (car)|accelerator]] and a [[steering wheel]]. The cars can be made to go backwards by turning the steering wheel far enough in either direction, necessary in the frequent [[pile-up]]s that occur.

Although the idea of the ride is to bump other cars, safety-conscious (or at least [[litigation]]-conscious) owners sometimes put up [[Signage|signs]] reading "This way around" and "No (head on) bumping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Dolan|first=Maura|title=Ruling over bumper-car injury supports amusement park|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=January 1, 2013|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jan/01/local/la-me-amusement-park-injuries-20130101|accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide To The Rides|publisher=Santa's Village Jefferson, New Hampshire|date=2013|url=http://www.santasvillage.com/public/explore/rides/bumper_cars.cfm|accessdate=8 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212233818/http://www.santasvillage.com/public/explore/rides/bumper_cars.cfm|archivedate=12 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the level of enforcement by operators, these rules are often ignored by bumper car riders, especially younger children and teenagers.{{cn|date=August 2018}} 

During their heyday, from the late 1920s to 1950s, two major US bumper cars brands were Dodgem by Max and Harold Stoehrer and the Lusse Brothers' Auto-Skooter by Joseph and Robert 'Ray' Lusse.&lt;ref name=LAShist&gt;{{cite web|last1=(Multiple authors)|title=Legend/History|url=http://www.lusseautoscooters.com/html/legend_history.html|website=Lusse Auto Scooter Bumper Car Web Site|publisher=Lusse Auto Scooters, LLC|accessdate=6 September 2014}} Includes many details about ''Dodgem'' as well.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JStanton97&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanton|first1=Jeffrey|title=Coney Island: Independent Rides|url=http://www.westland.net/coneyisland/articles/independentrides.htm|website=Coney Island History Site|publisher=Westland|accessdate=6 September 2014|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lusse Brothers built the first fiberglass body in 1959, in part due to the survival of Chevrolet Corvette bodies over the previous six years. After getting permission from Chevrolet, then subsequently buying the actual Corvette chevrons from local Philadelphia dealers, those were attached to the nose of their product for 1959. In the mid-1960s, [[Disneyland]] introduced [[hovercraft]]-based bumper cars called [[Flying Saucers (attraction)|Flying Saucers]], which worked on the same principle as an [[air hockey]] game; however, the ride was a mechanical failure and closed after a few years.

The current largest operating bumper car floor is located at [[Six Flags Great America]] in [[Gurnee]], [[Illinois]], and is called the Rue Le Dodge (Rue Le Morgue during Fright Fest in the fall). The ride is {{convert|51|ft|9|in|m}} by {{convert|124|ft|9|in|m}} or a total of {{convert|6455|sqft|m2}}. A [[replica]] of the ride was built at [[California's Great America]] in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]; in 2005, however, a [[concrete]] island was added to the middle of the floor to promote [[one-way traffic]], reducing the floor area. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}
[[Six Flags Great Adventure]]'s Autobahn is the largest bumper car floor, but it has not operated since 2008.

[[File:Chest of Drawers LACMA M.67.66.jpg|thumb|A cabinet of solid wood exterior construction]]
A '''cabinet''' is a box-shaped piece of [[furniture]] with doors and/or drawers for storing miscellaneous items. Some cabinets stand alone while others are built in to a wall or are attached to it like a [[Bathroom cabinet|medicine cabinet]]. Cabinets are typically made of wood (solid or with [[Wood veneer|veneer]]s or artificial surfaces), coated [[steel]] (common for medicine cabinets), or synthetic materials. [[Commerce|Commercial]] grade cabinets, which differ in the materials used, are called '''casework''', '''casegoods''', or '''case furniture'''.

Cabinets usually have one or more doors on the front, which are mounted with [[Door furniture|door hardware]], and occasionally a [[Lock (security device)|lock]]. Cabinets may have one or more doors, [[Drawer (furniture)|drawer]]s, and/or [[Shelf (storage)|shelves]]. Short cabinets often have a finished surface on top that can be used for display, or as a working surface, such as the [[countertop]]s found in kitchens.

A cabinet intended to be used in a bedroom and with several drawers typically placed one above another in one or more columns intended for clothing and small articles is called a [[chest of drawers]]. A small bedside cabinet is more frequently called a [[nightstand|nightstand or night table]]. A tall cabinet intended for clothing storage including hanging of clothes is called a ''[[wardrobe]]'' or an ''armoire'', or (in some countries) a ''closet'' if built-in.

== History ==
[[File:CommodeBoulle.jpg|369px|thumb|center|Commode by [[André-Charles Boulle]] at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]]]]
Before the advent of [[industrial design]], cabinet makers were responsible for the conception and the production of any piece of furniture. In the last half of the 18th century, cabinet makers, such as [[Thomas Sheraton]], [[Thomas Chippendale]], Shaver and Wormley Bros. Cabinet Constructors, and [[George Hepplewhite]], also published books of furniture forms. These books were compendiums of their designs and those of other '''cabinet makers'''.  The most famous cabinetmaker before the advent of industrial design is probably [[André-Charles Boulle]] (11 November 1642 – 29 February 1732) and his legacy is known as "[[Boulle Work]]" and the [[École Boulle]], a college of fine [[arts and crafts]] and [[applied arts]] in Paris, today bears testimony to his Art.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Boulle, André Charles |volume=4 |pages=321-323 |first=James |last=Penderel-Brodhurst}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tortoiseshell cabinet Sobieski.JPG|thumb|right|[[Tortoiseshell material|Tortoise-shell]] [[Cabinet (furniture)|cabinet]] of Polish king [[John III Sobieski]], [[Looting|looted]] by the Germans from the [[Wilanów Palace]] during [[World War II]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |author = Monika Kuhnke |url = |title = Cenny dar dla zwycięzcy spod Wiednia |work = icons.pl |publisher = valuable, priceless, lost |pages =  |page =  |year = 2000 |language=pl}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
With the [[industrial revolution]] and the application of [[Watt steam engine|steam]] power to cabinet making tools, [[mass production]] techniques were gradually applied to nearly all aspects of cabinet making, and the traditional cabinet shop ceased to be the main source of furniture, domestic or commercial. In parallel to this evolution there came a growing demand by the rising [[middle class]] in most industrialised countries for finely made furniture. This eventually resulted in a growth in the total number of traditional cabinet makers.

Before 1650, fine furniture was a rarity in Western Europe and North America. Generally, people did not need it and for the most part could not afford it. They made do with simple but serviceable pieces.

The [[arts and craft movement]] which started in the [[United Kingdom]] in the middle of the 19th century spurred a market for traditional cabinet making, and other [[craft]] goods. It rapidly spread to the [[United States]] and to all the countries in the [[British Empire]]. This movement exemplified the reaction to the eclectic historicism of the [[Victorian era]] and to the 'soulless' machine-made production which was starting to become widespread.

After [[World War II]] woodworking became a popular [[hobby]] among the middle classes. The more serious and skilled amateurs in this field now turn out pieces of furniture which rival the work of professional cabinet makers. Together, their work now represents but a small percentage of furniture production in any industrial country, but their numbers are vastly greater than those of their counterparts in the 18th century and before.

== Schools of design ==
[[File:Hughes Sambin - Cabinet - Walters 652.jpg|thumb|right|Crafted by Hughes Sambin (1570-1600), double cabinet features the combination of architectural elements and relief carving that is characteristic of French furniture of the period.]]

=== Scandinavian ===
This style of design is typified by clean horizontal and vertical lines. Compared to other designs there is a distinct absence of ornamentation.  While [[Scandinavian design]] is easy to identify, it is much more about the materials than the design.

=== French Provincial ===
This style of design is very ornate. [[French furniture|French Provincial]] objects are often stained or painted, leaving the wood concealed. Corners and bevels are often decorated with gold leaf or given some other kind of gilding.  Flat surfaces often have artwork such as landscapes painted directly on them. The wood used in French provincial varied, but was often originally beech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=QV9g3DbB1kQC&amp;dq=french+furniture&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bll&amp;ots=gxO-gTMoO8&amp;sig=JKg93eWCimuhMkJMdHOAtoP0vts&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=11&amp;ct=result#PPT1,M1 |title=French Furniture - Andre Saglio |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early American Colonial ===
This design emphasises both form and materials. [[Colonial furniture|Early American]] chairs and tables are often constructed with turned spindles and chair backs often constructed using steaming to bend the wood. Wood choices tend to be deciduous hardwoods with a particular emphasis on the wood of edible or fruit-bearing trees such as cherry or walnut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/175713/Early-American-furniture |title=Early American furniture - Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rustic ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
The [[rustic furniture|rustic]] style of design sometimes called "log furniture" or "[[log cabin]]" is the least finished. Design is very utilitarian yet seeks to feature not only the materials used but in, as much as possible, how they existed in their natural state. For example, a table top may have what is considered a "live edge" that allows you to see the original contours of the tree that it came from. It also often uses whole logs or branches including the bark of the tree.  Rustic furniture is often made from [[pine]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], [[fir]] and [[spruce]]. Also see [[Adirondack Architecture]].

=== Mission Style ===
[[Mission Style Furniture|Mission Design]] is characterized by straight, thick horizontal and vertical lines and flat panels. The most common material used in [[Mission Style Furniture|Mission furniture]] is oak. For early mission cabinetmakers, the material of choice was white oak, which they often darkened through a process known as [[Ammonia fuming|"fuming"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hUdIZJ56XLgC&amp;pg=RA1-PA18&amp;lpg=RA1-PA18&amp;dq=mission+cabinets+fumed+oak+article&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=LdD8UPLMgf&amp;sig=kTUWn75kwEfDlNaddMFDEvGr-4g&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BUO5SaKXF4KUMc7P1KoI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ct=result |title=The Stickley Brothers: The Quest for an American Voice - Michael E. Clark, Jill Thomas-Clark |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardware is often visible on the outside of the pieces and made of black iron. It is a style that became popular in the early 20th century; popularized by designers in the Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveaux movements.

=== Oriental ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
Also known as [[Asian furniture|Asian Design]], this style of furniture is characterized by its use of materials such as [[bamboo]] and [[rattan]].  Red is a frequent color choice along with landscape art and Chinese or other Asian language characters on the pieces.

=== Shaker ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
[[Shaker furniture]] design is focused on function and symmetry. Because it is so influenced by an egalitarian religious community and tradition it is rooted in the needs of the community versus the creative expression of the designer. Like Early American and Colonial design, Shaker craftsmen often chose fruit woods for their designs. Pieces reflect a very efficient use of materials.

== Types of cabinetry ==

}}
The fundamental focus of the cabinet maker is the production of cabinetry. Although the cabinet maker may also be required to produce items that would not be recognized as cabinets, the same skills and techniques apply.

A cabinet may be built-in or free-standing. A built-in cabinet is usually custom made for a particular situation and it is fixed into position, on a floor, against a wall, or framed in an opening. For example, modern kitchens are examples of built-in cabinetry. Free-standing cabinets are more commonly available as off-the-shelf items and can be moved from place to place if required. Cabinets may be wall hung or suspended from the ceiling. Cabinet doors may be hinged or sliding and may have mirrors on the inner or outer surface.

Cabinets may have a [[face frame]] or may be of [[frameless construction]] (also known as ''European'' or ''euro-style''). Face frame cabinets have a supporting frame attached to the front of the cabinet box. This face frame is usually {{convert|1+1/2|in|mm}} in width. Mounted on the cabinet frame is the cabinet door. In contrast, frameless cabinet have no such supporting front face frame, the cabinet doors attach directly to the sides of the cabinet box. The box's side, bottom and top panels are usually {{convert|5/8|to|3/4|in|mm}} thick, with the door overlaying all but {{convert|1/16|in|mm}} of the box edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://cabinets-q-and-a.com/refinishing-kitchen-cabinets.html| title=Refinishing and Upgrading Kitchen Cabinets | publisher= CabinetsQandA.com| year=2010| accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Modern cabinetry is often frameless and is typically constructed from man-made sheet materials, such as [[plywood]], [[Particle board|chipboard]] or [[medium-density fibreboard]] (MDF). The visible surfaces of these materials are usually clad in a timber [[Wood veneer|veneer]], plastic laminate, or other material. They may also be painted.

== Cabinet components ==
=== Bases ===
 {{multiple image
 | direction = vertical
 | width = 180
 | header=
 | image1 = Cabinetmaking-kick space base.svg
 | caption1 = Enclosed cabinet base with a kick space | alt1 =
 | image2 =Cabinetmaking-scrolled base.svg
 | caption2 = Scrolled base  | alt2 =
 | image3 = Cabinetmaking bracket foot.svg
 | caption3 = Bracket feet  | alt3 =
 }}
Cabinets which rest on the floor are supported by some base. This base could be a fully enclosed base (i.e. a [[plinth]]), a scrolled based, bracket feet or it could be a set of legs.

=== Adjustable feet ===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
A type of adjustable leg has been adopted from the European cabinet system which offers several advantages. First off, in making base cabinets for kitchens, the cabinet sides would be cut to 34½ inches, yielding four cabinet side blanks per 4 foot by 8 foot sheet. Using the adjustable feet, the side blanks are cut to 30&amp;nbsp;inches, thus yielding six cabinet side per sheet.

These feet can be secured to the bottom of the cabinet by having the leg base screwed onto the cabinet bottom. They can also be attached by means of a hole drilled through the cabinet bottom at specific locations. The legs are then attached to the cabinet bottom by a slotted, hollow machine screw. The height of the cabinet can be adjusted from inside the cabinet, simply by inserting a screwdriver into the slot and turning to raise or lower the cabinet. The holes in the cabinet are capped by plastic inserts, making the appearance more acceptable for residential cabinets. Using these feet, the cabinets need not be shimmed or scribed to the floor for leveling. The toe kick board is attached to the cabinet by means of a clip, which is either screwed onto the back side of the kick board, or a barbed plastic clip is inserted into a saw kerf, also made on the back side of the kick board. This toe kick board can be made to fit each base cabinet, or made to fit a run of cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.prowoodworkingtips.com/Base_Cabinet_Construction_Sketch.html |title= Base Cabinet Construction Sketch |publisher=ProWoodworkingTips.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kitchen cabinets, or any cabinet generally at which a person may stand, usually have a fully enclosed base in which the front edge has been set back 75&amp;nbsp;mm or so to provide room for toes, known as the [[kick space]]. A scrolled base is similar to the fully enclosed base but it has areas of the base material removed, often with a decorative pattern, leaving feet on which the cabinet stands. Bracket feet are separate feet, usually attached in each corner and occasionally for larger pieces in the middle of the cabinet.

=== Compartments ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
A cabinet usually has at least one compartment. Compartments may be open, as in open shelving; they may be enclosed by one or more doors; or they may contain one or more drawers. Some cabinets contain secret compartments, access to which is generally not obvious.

Modern cabinets employ many more complicated means (relative to a simple shelf) of making browsing lower cabinets more efficient and comfortable. One example is the [[lazy susan]], a shelf which rotates around a central axis, allowing items stored at the back of the cabinet to be brought to the front by rotating the shelf. These are usually used in corner cabinets, which are larger and deeper and have a greater "dead space" at the back than other cabinets.

=== Cabinet insert hardware ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2014}}
An alternative to the [[Lazy Susan|lazy susan]], particularly in base cabinets, is the blind corner cabinet pull out unit. These pull out and turn, making the attached shelving unit slide into the open area of the cabinet door, thus making the shelves accessible to the user. These units make usable what was once dead space.

Other insert hardware includes such items as mixer shelves that pull out of a base cabinet and spring into a locked position at counter height. This hardware aids in lifting these somewhat heavy mixers and assists with positioning the unit for use. More and more components are being designed to enable specialized hardware to be used in standard cabinet carcasses.

=== Tops ===
Most cabinets incorporate a top of some sort. In many cases, the top is merely to enclose the compartments within and serves no other purpose—as in a wall hung cupboard for example. In other cabinets, the top also serves as a work surface—a kitchen countertop for example.

'''Calcium chloride''' is an [[inorganic compound]], a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] with the [[chemical formula]] CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a colorless crystalline solid at room temperature, highly [[solubility|soluble]] in water.

Calcium chloride is commonly encountered as a [[water of crystallization|hydrated]] solid with generic formula CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''x'' = 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6.  These compounds are mainly used for de-icing and dust control. Because the [[anhydrous]] salt is [[hygroscopic]], it is used as a [[desiccant]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Robert Kemp, Suzanne E. Keegan "Calcium Chloride" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2000, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a04_547}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Uses==

===De-icing and freezing-point depression===
[[File:Cacl2 storage for winter road in japan.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|Bulk CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for de-icing in [[Japan]]]]
By [[freezing-point depression|depressing the freezing point]] of water, calcium chloride is used to prevent ice formation and is used to [[de-icing|de-ice]]. This application consumes the greatest amount of calcium chloride. Calcium chloride is relatively harmless to plants and soil. As a de-icing agent, it is much more effective at lower temperatures than sodium chloride. When distributed for this use, it usually takes the form of small, white spheres a few millimeters in diameter, called [[prills]]. Solutions of calcium chloride can prevent freezing at temperature as low as −52&amp;nbsp;°C (−62&amp;nbsp;°F), making it ideal for filling agricultural implement tires as a liquid ballast, aiding traction in cold climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Binary Phase diagram: The Calcium Chloride – water system |publisher = Aqueous Solutions Aps |date = October 2016 |url = http://www.phasediagram.dk/binary/calcium_chloride.htm |accessdate=2017-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used in domestic and industrial chemical air [[dehumidifiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://humantouchofchemistry.com/keeping-things-dry.htm |title= humantouchofchemistry.com Keeping Things Dry |accessdate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Road surfacing===
[[File:Calcium chloride on a dirt road.jpg|thumb|left|Calcium chloride was sprayed on this road to prevent weathering, giving it a wet appearance even in dry weather.]]
The second largest application of calcium chloride exploits  [[hygroscopic]] properties and the tackiness of its hydrates.  A concentrated solution keeps a liquid layer on the surface of [[dirt road]]s, which suppresses formation of dust. It keeps the finer dust particles on the road, providing a cushioning layer. If these are allowed to blow away, the large aggregate begins to shift around and the road breaks down. Using calcium chloride reduces the need for [[Grading (engineering)|grading]] by as much as 50% and the need for fill-in materials as much as 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dust: Don't Eat It! Control It! |work=Road Management &amp; Engineering Journal |publisher=US Roads (TranSafety Inc.) |date=1 June 1998 |url=http://www.usroads.com/journals/rmej/9806/rm980603.htm |accessdate=9 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water treatment===
Calcium chloride is used to increase the [[Hard water|water hardness]] in swimming pools. This process reduces the erosion of the concrete in the pool. By [[Le Chatelier's principle]] and the [[common-ion effect]], increasing the concentration of calcium in the water reduces the dissolution of calcium compounds essential to the structure of concrete.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Food===
The average intake of calcium chloride as food additives has been estimated to be 160–345&amp;nbsp;mg/day.&lt;ref&gt;Calcium Chloride SIDS Initial Assessment Profile, UNEP Publications, SIAM 15, Boston, 22–25 October 2002, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium chloride is permitted as a food additive in the [[European Union]] for use as a [[sequestrant]] and [[firming agent]] with the [[E number]] E509. It is considered as [[generally recognized as safe|generally recognized as safe (GRAS)]] by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.&lt;ref&gt;21 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] § 184.1193&lt;/ref&gt; Its use in [[Organic farming|organic crop production]] is generally prohibited under the US [[National Organic Program]].&lt;ref name="CFRTitle7Part205Section602c"&gt;7 [[Code of Federal Regulations|CFR]] [http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=1&amp;SID=e967a1968547dfb3141e756cac7ca0ad&amp;h=L&amp;n=7y3.1.1.9.32.7&amp;r=SUBPART&amp;ty=HTML#7:3.1.1.9.32.7.354.3 § 205.602]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[marine aquarium]]s, calcium chloride is one way to introduce [[Bioavailability|bioavailable]] calcium for calcium carbonate-shelled animals such as [[mollusks]] and some [[cnidarians]]. [[Calcium hydroxide]] (kalkwasser mix) or a [[calcium reactor]] can also be used.

As a [[firming agent]], calcium chloride is used in canned vegetables, in firming [[soybean]] curds into [[tofu]] and in producing a [[caviar]] [[spherification|substitute from vegetable or fruit juices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Apple Caviar Technique|work = StarChefs Studio|publisher = StarChefs.com|date = April 2004| url = http://www.starchefs.com/events/studio/techniques/FAdria/index.shtml|accessdate = 9 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is commonly used as an [[electrolyte]] in [[sports drink]]s and other beverages, including bottled water. The extremely [[saltiness|salty taste]] of calcium chloride is used to flavor [[Pickled cucumber|pickles]] without increasing the food's [[sodium]] content. Calcium chloride's freezing-point depression properties are used to slow the freezing of the caramel in caramel-filled chocolate bars. Also, it is frequently added to sliced apples to maintain texture.

In [[brewing]] beer, calcium chloride is sometimes used to correct mineral deficiencies in the brewing water. It affects flavor and chemical reactions during the brewing process, and can also affect yeast function during fermentation.

In [[cheesemaking]], calcium chloride is sometimes added to processed (pasteurized/homogenized) milk to restore the natural balance between calcium and protein in [[casein]]. It is added before the coagulant.

Calcium chloride is used to prevent [[cork spot]] and [[bitter pit]] on apples by spraying on the tree during the late growing season.&lt;ref&gt;"Cork Spot and Bitter Pit of Apples", Richard C. Funt and Michael A. Ellis, Ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/plpath-fru-01&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laboratory and related drying operations===
[[Drying tube]]s are frequently packed with calcium chloride. [[Kelp]] is dried with calcium chloride for use in producing [[sodium carbonate]]. Anhydrous calcium chloride has been approved by the FDA as a packaging aid to ensure dryness (CPG 7117.02).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = CPG 7117.02|work = FDA Compliance Articles|publisher = US Food and Drug Administration|date = March 1995|url = http://www.fda.gov/ora/compliance_ref/cpg/cpgfod/cpg500-400.html|accessdate = 3 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
It is injected to treat internal hydrofluoric acid burns.  It can be used to treat [[Hypermagnesemia|magnesium intoxication]]. Calcium chloride injection may improve the appearance of an [[electrocardiogram]]. It can help to protect the myocardium from dangerously high levels of serum [[potassium]] in [[hyperkalemia]]. Calcium chloride can be used to quickly treat calcium channel blocker toxicity, from the side effects of drugs such as [[diltiazem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Calcium chloride Prescribing Information|publisher = Hospira, Inc.|date = November 2009|url = https://www.drugs.com/pro/calcium-chloride.html|accessdate = 10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cardiac arrest====
While intravenous calcium has been used to treat [[cardiac arrest]], its general use is not recommended.&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; Cases of cardiac arrest in which it is still recommended include [[high blood potassium]], [[low blood calcium]] such as may occur following [[blood transfusions]], and [[calcium channel blocker overdose]].&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; There is the potential that general use could worsen outcomes.&lt;ref name=AHFS2017/&gt; If calcium is used, calcium chloride is generally the recommended form.&lt;ref name=AHFS2017&gt;{{cite web |title=Calcium Salts |url=https://www.drugs.com/monograph/calcium-salts.html |publisher=The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists |accessdate= 8 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science===
Aqueous calcium chloride is used in genetic [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] of cells by increasing the cell membrane permeability, inducing [[competence (biology)|competence]] for DNA uptake (allowing DNA fragments to enter the cell more readily).

===Miscellaneous applications===
Calcium chloride is used in concrete mixes to [[Cement accelerator|accelerate]] the initial setting, but chloride ions lead to corrosion of steel [[rebar]], so it should not be used in [[reinforced concrete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Accelerating Concrete Set Time|publisher = [[Federal Highway Administration]]|date = 1 June 1999|url = http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/materialsgrp/acclerat.htm|accessdate = 16 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anhydrous form of calcium chloride may also be used for this purpose and can provide a measure of the moisture in concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Adhesives in Building: Selection and Field Application; Pressure-sensitive Tapes|author=National Research Council (U.S.). Building Research Institute|publisher=National Academy of Science-National Research Council|pages=24–5|year=1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calcium chloride is included as an additive in plastics and in [[fire extinguisher]]s, in wastewater treatment as a drainage aid, in [[blast furnace]]s as an additive to control scaffolding (clumping and adhesion of materials that prevent the furnace charge from descending), and in [[fabric softener]] as a thinner.

The exothermic dissolution of calcium chloride is used in [[self-heating cans]] and [[heating pad]]s.

In the oil industry, calcium chloride is used to increase the density of solids-free brines. It is also used to provide inhibition of swelling clays in the water phase of invert emulsion drilling fluids.

CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; acts as flux material (decreasing melting point) in the Davy process for the industrial production of sodium metal, through the electrolysis of molten NaCl.

Similarly, CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used as a flux and [[electrolyte]] in the [[FFC Cambridge process]] for [[titanium]] production, where it ensures the proper exchange of calcium and oxygen ions between the electrodes.

Calcium chloride is also used in the production of [[activated charcoal]].

Calcium chloride is also an ingredient used in ceramic slipware. It suspends clay particles so that they float within the solution making it easier to use in a variety of slipcasting techniques.

====Animal sterilization====
Calcium chloride dihydrate (20% by weight) dissolved in [[ethanol]] (95% ABV) has been used as a [[Animal sterilization|sterilant]] for male animals.  The solution is injected into the testes of the animal. Within 1 month, necrosis of testicular tissue results in sterilization.&lt;ref&gt;Koger, Nov 1977, "Calcium Chloride, Practical Necrotizing Agent", ''Journal of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners (USA)'', (Nov 1977), v. 12, p. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Jana|first = K.|last2 = Samanta|first2 = P.K.|title = Clinical evaluation of non-surgical sterilization of male cats with single intra-testicular injection of calcium chloride|journal = BMC Vet. Res.|doi= 10.1186/1746-6148-7-39|pmid = 21774835|volume=7|year=2011|pages=39|pmc=3152893}}&lt;!--|accessdate = 12 November 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazards==
Calcium chloride can act as an [[irritation|irritant]] by desiccating moist skin. Solid calcium chloride dissolves [[exothermic process|exothermically]], and [[Burn (injury)|burns]] can result in the [[mouth]] and [[esophagus]] if it is ingested. Ingestion of concentrated solutions or solid products may cause gastrointestinal irritation or ulceration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dow.com/productsafety/finder/cacl_2.htm|title = Product Safety Assessment (PSA): Calcium Chloride|publisher = [[Dow Chemical Company]]|date = 2 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consumption of calcium chloride can lead to [[hypercalcemia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.drugs.com/pro/calcium-chloride.html|title = Calcium Chloride Possible Side Affects}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
[[File:Flame Test Ca.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|[[Flame test]] of CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]
Calcium chloride dissolves in water, producing chloride and the [[aquo complex]] [Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In this way, these solutions are sources of "free" calcium and free chloride ions. This description is illustrated by the fact that these solutions react with [[phosphate]] sources to give a solid precipitate of calcium phosphate:
: 3 CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 PO{{su|b=4|p=3−}}  →  Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  6 Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
Calcium chloride has a very high [[enthalpy change of solution]], indicated by considerable temperature rise accompanying dissolution of the anhydrous salt in water.  This property is the basis for its largest-scale application.

Molten calcium chloride can be [[electrolysis|electrolysed]] to give [[calcium]] metal and [[chlorine]] gas:
: CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Ca + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Preparation==
[[File:Ca(aq)6 improved image.tif|thumb|Structure of the polymeric [Ca(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; center in crystalline calcium chloride hexahydrate, illustrating the high coordination number typical for calcium complexes.]]

In much of the world, calcium chloride is derived from [[limestone]] as a by-product of the [[Solvay process]]:&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; North American consumption in 2002 was 1,529,000 [[tonne]]s (3.37 billion pounds).&lt;ref&gt;Calcium Chloride SIDS Initial Assessment Profile, UNEP Publications, SIAM 15, Boston, 22–25 October 2002, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
: 2 NaCl + CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

In the US, most of calcium chloride is obtained by purification from [[brine]].  A Dow Chemical Company manufacturing facility in Michigan houses about 35% of the total U.S. production capacity for calcium chloride.&lt;ref&gt;Calcium Chloride Chemical Profile, The Innovation Group, www.the-innovation-group.com, printed 9 September 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with most bulk commodity salt products, [[trace element|trace]] amounts of other [[cation]]s from the [[alkali metal]]s and [[alkaline earth metal]]s ([[group (periodic table)|groups]] 1 and 2) and other [[anion]]s from the [[halogen]]s ([[group (periodic table)|group]] 17) typically occur, but the [[concentration]]s are trifling.

===Occurrence===
Calcium chloride occurs as the rare [[evaporite]] minerals sinjarite (dihydrate) and [[antarcticite]] (hexahydrate). The related minerals [[chlorocalcite]] (potassium calcium chloride, KCaCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[tachyhydrite]] (calcium magnesium chloride, [[calcium|Ca]][[magnesium|Mg]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[chlorine|Cl]]&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;·12[[water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]) are also very rare.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7392">'''Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation''', or '''CORSIA''', is an emission mitigation approach for the global airline industry, developed by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). CORSIA addresses emissions from international air travel. The proposal has been described as "a delicate compromise between all involved in its elaboration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ec.europa.eu/transport/sites/transport/files/2018-03-01-eu-reply-to-corsia-state-letter.pdf |title=State letter |website=ec.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
As per an IPCC report published in 1999&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/spm/av-en.pdf |title=Special report |website=ipcc.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;, aviation accounted for approximately two percent of global [[carbon emissions]] due to human activity, as of 1992 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/sres/aviation/126.htm |title=Aviation and the Global Atmosphere |website=ipcc.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Per capita emissions from [[air travel]] is one of the highest in comparison to various other modes of transportation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eea.europa.eu/media/infographics/co2-emissions-from-passenger-transport/view|title=CO2 emissions from passenger transport|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The industry is expecting a growth in air travel in various regions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/urban-expeditions/transportation/air-travel-fuel-emissions-environment/|title=As Billions More Fly, Here’s How Aviation Could Evolve|date=20 June 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Through CORSIA, the aviation industry is aiming for a [[carbon neutral]] growth from 2020.

Many airlines offers an option for airline passengers, for an additional payment, to [[Carbon offset|offset]] their emissions associated with their air travel. Few airlines such as NatureAir&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2008/11/282442-carbon-neutral-airline-gets-board-un-scheme-cut-greenhouse-gas-emissions|title=Carbon neutral airline gets on board UN scheme to cut greenhouse gas emissions|date=20 November 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-1047240|title=Flying the world's first carbon neutral airline|website=CNN iReport}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Harbour Air &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.harbourair.com/about/carbon-neutral/|title=Carbon Neutral - Harbour Air|website=www.harbourair.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been carbon-neutral. There are start-up aviation ventures such as FlyPOP that are aiming to be carbon neutral&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businessgreen.com/bg/feature/2471096/could-a-uk-startup-become-the-worlds-first-carbon-neutral-airline|title=Could a UK startup become the world's first 'carbon neutral' airline?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.airline-suppliers.com/uk-startup-fly-pop-become-worlds-first-carbon-neutral-airline/|title=Could UK startup Fly POP become the world's first 'carbon neutral' airline? - Airline Suppliers|date=20 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Process==
CORSIA has three implementation phases, beginning 2021. Participation of countries till 2026 is voluntary.

==Participation==
As of January 2018, more than 70 countries representing more than 85% of international aviation activity have volunteered to participate. [[India]] and [[Russia]] are yet to join CORSIA. India, which has four of the five carbon-neutral airports in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airportcarbonaccreditation.org/airport/participants/asia-pacific.html|title=Airport Carbon Accreditation - ASIA PACIFIC|website=www.airportcarbonaccreditation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the world's first fully solar powered airport, has drawn attention to "differentiated responsibilities" and the "need to ensure the transfer of financial resources, technology transfer and deployment and capacity building support to developing countries for enabling them to voluntarily undertake action plans."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Lists/ActionPlan/Attachments/33/Final_State_Action_Plan_India.pdf |title=Report|website=icao.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Exemptions==
Least Developed Countries, Small Island Developing States and Landlocked Developing Countries can volunteer to participate in CORSIA, while it is not mandated on them. However, all ICAO member states "with aeroplane operators conducting international flights are required to monitor, report and verify (MRV) CO2 emissions from these flights every year from 2019"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Documents/CorsiaBrochure_8Panels-ENG-Web.pdf |title=Report|website=icao.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;. All aeroplane operators with CO2 emissions less than or equal to 10,000 tonnes are exempted from the CORSIA reporting requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebaa.org/en/current-issues/environment---corsia.aspx|title=CORSIA - The ICAO Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation - EBAA|website=www.ebaa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Criticisms==
CORSIA is a market based mechanism focusing on offsetting emissions through the process of an airline purchasing emission units equivalent to its offsetting requirements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iata.org/about/worldwide/asia_pacific/Pages/What-is-CORSIA.aspx|title=IATA - What is CORSIA|first=|last=IATA|website=www.iata.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Offsetting processes may tend to divert the focus from reducing emissions, to trading on emissions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.traveltourismguild.com/single-post/2018/02/07/Carbon-Footprints-and-The-Travel-Industry|title=theguild|website=theguild}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
It is also said that CORSIA is not as stringent as [[EU ETS]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/publications/2016_12_CE_Delft_ETS_CORSIA_final.pdf |title=Report |website=transportenvironment.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
While the scheme may address a significant percentage of emissions from international aviation, it may not fully contribute to a 'carbon neutral growth'. CORSIA has also not stated any upper limit to the aviation related emissions that may be produced by an airline operator or a country.

==Emissions from domestic aviation==
Emissions from domestic air travel is not included in CORSIA. ICAO states that "Emissions from domestic aviation, as other domestic sources, are addressed under the UNFCCC and calculated as part of the national GHG inventories and are included in national totals (part of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs))..." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/A39_CORSIA_FAQ1.aspx|title=1.

[[File:Hydrogen cascade storage system.jpg|thumb|right|Hydrogen storage cylinders in a cascade filling system]]
A '''cascade filling system''' is a high pressure [[gas cylinder]] storage system which is used for the refilling of smaller compressed gas cylinders.&lt;ref name=evil&gt;{{cite journal |title=Compressed breathing air – the potential for evil from within. |author=Millar IL; Mouldey PG |year=2008 |volume=38 |pages=145–51 |journal=Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine |publisher=[[South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society]] |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/7964 |accessdate=2009-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oxyhackers&gt;{{cite book |author=Harlow, V |title=Oxygen Hacker's Companion |publisher=Airspeed Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-9678873-2-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some applications, each of the large cylinders is filled by a [[Gas compressor|compressor]], otherwise they may be filled remotely and replaced when the pressure is too low for effective transfer. The cascade system allows small cylinders to be filled without a compressor. In addition, a cascade system is useful as a reservoir to allow a low-capacity compressor to meet the demand of filling several small cylinders in close succession, with longer intermediate periods during which the storage cylinders can be recharged.

==Principle of operation==
When gas contained in a cylinder at high pressure is allowed to flow to another cylinder containing gas at a lower pressure, the pressures will equalise to a value somewhere between the two initial pressures. The equilibrium pressure is affected by transfer rate as it will be influenced by temperature, but at constant temperature the equilibrium pressure is described by [[Dalton's law]] of partial pressures and [[Boyle's law]] for ideal gases.

The formula for the equilibrium pressure is:
: P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = (P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;×V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;×V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/(V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
: where P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are the initial pressure and volume of one cylinder
: P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the initial pressure and volume of the other cylinder
: and P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the equilibrium pressure.

An example could be a 100-litre (internal volume) cylinder (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) pressurised to 200 bar (P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) filling a 10-litre (internal volume) cylinder (V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which was unpressurised (P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 bar) (resulting in both cylinder equalising to approximately 180 bar (P&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). If another 100 litre cylinder pressurised this time to 250 bar were then used to "top-up" the 10 litre cylinder, both of these cylinders would equalise to about 240 bar. However, if the higher pressure 100 litre cylinder were used first, the 10 litre cylinder would equalise to about 225 bar and the lower pressure 100 litre cylinder could not be used to top it up. In a cascade storage system, several large cylinders are used to bring a small cylinder up to a desired pressure, by always using the supply cylinder with the lowest usable pressure first, then the cylinder with the next lowest pressure, and so on.

In practice the theoretical transfers can only be achieved if the gases are allowed to reach a temperature equilibrium before disconnection. This requires significant time, and a lower efficiency may be accepted to save time. Actual transfer can be calculated using the general gas equation of state if the temperature of the gas in the cylinder is accurately measured.

==Uses==

===Breathing sets===
A breathing set cylinder may be filled to its working pressure by decanting from larger (often 50 litre) cylinders. (To make this easy the neck of the cylinder of the [[Siebe Gorman Salvus]] [[rebreather]] had the same thread as an oxygen storage cylinder, but the opposite gender, for direct decanting.) The storage cylinders are available in a variety of sizes, typically from 50 litre internal capacity to well over 100 litres.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airproducts.com/NR/rdonlyres/7CCE748B-35BA-45B2-93D4-48AE3D3EEDF3/0/reference_cylinder_information.pdf Specialty Gas Cylinder Dimensions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911020423/http://www.airproducts.com/NR/rdonlyres/7CCE748B-35BA-45B2-93D4-48AE3D3EEDF3/0/reference_cylinder_information.pdf |date=September 11, 2008 }} Air Products&lt;/ref&gt;

In the more general case a high pressure hose known as a filling whip is used to connect the filling panel or storage cylinder to the receiving cylinder.

Cascade filling is often used for partial pressure blending of [[breathing gas]] mixtures for [[Underwater diving|diving]], to economize on the relatively expensive oxygen, for [[nitrox]], and the even more expensive helium in [[trimix (breathing gas)|trimix]] or [[heliox]] mixtures.&lt;ref name=oxyhackers /&gt;

===Compressed natural gas fueling===
Cascade storage is used at [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG) fueling stations. Typically three CNG tanks will be used, and a vehicle will first be fueled from one of them, which will result an incomplete fill, perhaps to 2000 PSI for a 3000 PSI tank. The second and third tanks will bring the vehicle's tank closer to 3000 PSI. The station normally has a compressor, which refills the station's tanks, using natural gas from a utility line. This prevents accidentally overfilling the tank, which could happen with a system using a single fueling tank at a higher pressure than the target pressure for the vehicle.

===Hydrogen storage===
&lt;!--The explanation below is confusing and may be inaccurate. The reference is a broken link--&gt;
In cascade storage systems for [[hydrogen storage]], as for example at [[hydrogen station]]s, [[fuel dispenser]] A draws hydrogen from tank A, while dispenser B draws fuel from [[hydrogen tank]] B. If dispenser A is over-utilized, tank A will become depleted before tank B. At this point the dispenser A is switched to tank C. Tank C will then supply dispenser A and B and tank A until tank A is filled to the same pressure as tank B and the dispensers are disconnected, after which the control system will close the control valves to switch to its former state.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogencontest.org/pdf/UMissouri_2004.pdf Hydrogen Fueling Station Pag 4.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070726054204/http://www.hydrogencontest.org/pdf/UMissouri_2004.pdf |date=July 26, 2007 }} Broken link&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrangement of system==
[[File:Cascade schematic.svg|thumb|Schematic diagram of a simple cascade filling system]]
The storage cylinders may be used independently in sequence using a portable transfer whip with a pressure gauge and manual bleed valve, to transfill the receiving cylinder until the appropriate fill pressure has been reached, or the storage cylinders may be connected to a manifold system and a filling control panel with one or more filling whips. 

Ideally each storage cylinder has an independent connection to the filling panel with a contents pressure gauge and supply valve dedicated to that cylinder, and a filling gauge connected to the filling whip, so the operator can see at a glance the next higher storage cylinder pressure compared to the receiving cylinder pressure.

The storage cylinders may be filled remotely and connected to the manifold by a flexible hose when in use, or may be permanently connected and refilled by a compressor through a dedicated filling system, which may be automated or manually controlled.

An over-pressure safety valve is usually installed inline between the compressor and the storage units to protect the cylinders from overfilling, and each cylinder may also be protected by a [[rupture disc]].

The diagram below shows the tire from above, so that the road surface lies in the ''x''-''y'' [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]. The vehicle to which the tire is attached is moving in the positive ''y'' direction.

[[Image:Circle-of-Forces.gif|300px|right|Circle of Forces]]

In this example, the vehicle would be cornering to the right (i.e. the positive ''x'' direction points to the center of the corner). Note that the [[plane of rotation]] of the tire is at an angle to the actual direction that the tire is moving (the positive ''y'' direction). This is the [[slip angle]].

A tire can generate horizontal [[force]] where it meets the road surface by the mechanism of [[Slip (vehicle dynamics)|slip]]. That force is represented in the diagram by the [[vector (geometry)|vector]] '''''F'''''. Note that in this example '''''F''''' is perpendicular to the plane of the tire. That is because the tire is rolling freely, with no [[torque]] applied to it by the vehicle's [[brake]]s or [[Automobile#Major possible subsystems|drive train]]. However, that is not always the case.

The magnitude of '''''F''''' is limited by the dashed circle, but it can be any combination of the components '''''F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''''' and '''''F&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''''' that does not extend beyond the dashed circle.&lt;ref name="FoaleBook"/&gt; (For a real-world tire, the circle is likely to be closer to an ellipse, with the ''y'' axis slightly longer than the ''x'' axis.)

In the example, the tire is generating a component of force in the ''x'' direction ('''''F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''''') which, when transferred to the vehicle's [[chassis]] via the [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] system in combination with similar forces from the other tires, will cause the vehicle to turn to the right. Note that there is also a small component of force in the negative ''y'' direction ('''''F&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'''''). This represents [[Drag (physics)|drag]] that will, if not countered by some other force, cause the vehicle to decelerate. Drag of this kind is an unavoidable consequence of the mechanism of slip, by which the tire generates [[cornering force|lateral force]].

The diameter of the circle of forces, and therefore the maximum horizontal force that the tire can generate, depends upon many factors, including the design of the tire and its condition (age and temperature, for example), the qualities of the road surface, and the vertical load on the tire.

'''Coffee wastewater''', also known as '''coffee effluent''', is a byproduct of [[coffee processing]]. Its treatment and disposal is an important environmental consideration for coffee processing as [[wastewater]] is a form of industrial [[water pollution]].{{sfn|Nemerow|1971}}

The unpicked [[fruit]] of the coffee tree, known as the coffee cherry, undergoes a long process to make it ready for [[ingestion|consumption]]. This process often entails use of large quantities of [[water]] and the production of considerable amounts of solid and liquid waste. The type of waste is a result of the type of process that the coffee cherries go through. The conversion of the cherry to ''oro''&lt;ref group=footnotes&gt;Stemming from the Spanish word for gold, due to the colour of the dried bean&lt;/ref&gt; or ''green bean'' (the dried coffee bean which is ready to be exported) is achieved through either a dry, semi-washed or fully washed process.

== Processing ==
{{main|Coffee production#Processing}}

=== Dry ===

The coffee cherries are dried immediately after they are harvested through sun drying, solar drying or artificial drying. In sun drying, the coffee cherries are placed on a clean floor and left to dry in the open air. In solar drying, the cherries are placed in a closed cabinet, which has ventilation holes to let moisture out. Artificial drying is used mostly during the wet season, when the low level of sunlight extends the time needed for solar drying and the cherries are prone to mold growth. After being dried, the cherries are hulled. In this process the dried outer layer of the cherry, known as the [[pericarp]], is removed mechanically.

=== Semi-washed ===

In semi-washed processing, the cherries are de-pulped to remove the pericarp. After this the slimy [[mucilage]] layer which covers the bean is removed. This is done mechanically by feeding the beans into a cylindrical device which conveys them upward. While the friction and pressure exerted on the beans by this process is enough to remove most of the mucilage, a small amount of it will still remain in the centre-cut of the beans. This technique is used in Colombia and Mexico in order to reduce the water consumption from the long fermentation process and the extensive washing.

==== Becolsub ====

In order to reduce the contamination generated by the wet process of coffee fruits, scientists at [[Centro Nacional de Investigaciones de Café|Cenicafé]] developed a technology that avoids using water when not needed and uses the right water when needed. The technology, called ''Becolsub'' (taken from the initials of the Spanish for ecological wet coffee process with by-products handling: '''''B'''eneficio '''Ecol'''ogicos '''Sub'''-productos''{{sfn|Cuervo|1997|p=3}}), controls more than 90% of the contamination generated by its predecessor. The quality of the coffee processed this way is the same as for coffee processed by natural fermentation.

The Becolsub technology consists of pulping without water, mechanical demucilaging and mixing the by-products (fruit outer-skin and mucilage) in a screw conveyor. The technology also includes a hydromechanical device to remove floating fruits and light impurities, as well as heavy and hard objects, and a cylindrical screen to remove the fruits whose skin was not separated in the pulping machine. Scientists at Cenicafé discovered that a coffee fruit with mucilage (immature and dry fruits have no mucilage) has enough water inside for the skin and seeds to be separated in conventional pulping machines without water, that the liquid was only required as a conveying means and that pulping without water avoids 72% of the potential contamination.

Mucilage removal has been done through a fermenting process, which takes between 14 and 18 hours, until the mucilage is degraded and can easily be removed with water. Washing fermented mucilage requires, in the best case, 5.0&amp;nbsp;L/kg of DPC. Scientists at Cenicafé developed a machine to remove the mucilage covering the coffee seeds. This machine, called Deslim (the initial letters of the Spanish demucilager, the mechanical washer and cleaner) removes more than 98% of the total mucilage (same as a well conducted fermentation) by exerting stress and generating collisions among beans, using only 0.7&amp;nbsp;L/kg of DPC. The resulting highly concentrated mixture of water, mucilage and impurities is viscous and is added to the separated fruit skin in a screw conveyor. In the screw conveyor the retention is greater than 60%, which means a 20% additional control of potential contamination.

The two by-products are widely used as worms' substrate to produce natural fertilizers. However, the high concentration of the mucilage obtained from the demucilager provides opportunity for industrializing the by-product.

=== Fully washed ===

This process is mainly used when processing ''[[Coffea arabica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herbs2000.com/herbs/herbs_coffee.htm|title=Coffee|author=|date=|website=www.herbs2000.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After de-pulping, the beans are collected in [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] tanks where bacterial removal of the mucilage takes place over 12 to 36 hours.{{sfn|Von Enden|2002|p=3–4}} The fermentation phase is important in the development of the flavour of the coffee, which is partially due to the microbiological processes that take place. The emergence of yeasts and moulds in acidic water can lead to [[Off-flavours|off-flavors]] like ''sour coffee'' and ''onion-flavour''. However, wet processing is believed to yield higher quality coffee than the other processes since small amounts of [[Off-flavours|off-flavors]] give the coffee its particular taste and "body".{{sfn|Calvert|1998|p=9–13}}

When fermentation is complete, the beans are washed thoroughly to remove fermentation residues and any remaining mucilage. If not removed, these cause decolouring of the parchment and make the beans susceptible to yeasts. After washing, the beans are dried. When the drying process is not rapid enough earthy and musty taints, like ''Rio-flavor'' come up.{{sfn|Calvert|1999}}

== Water usage ==

The amount of water used in processing depends strongly on the type of processing. Wet fully washed processing of the coffee cherries requires the most fresh water, dry processing the least. Sources indicate a wide range in water use.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Recycling of water in the de-pulping process can drastically reduce the amount needed. With reuse and improved washing techniques, up to 1 to 6&amp;nbsp;m³ water per tonne of fresh coffee cherry is achievable; without reuse a consumption of up to 20&amp;nbsp;m³/tonne is possible.

=== General ===
[[File:Coffee Processing Seperation vats.jpg|thumb|Coffee cherries being separated using water in separation vats]]

Water used in processing coffee leaves the coffee processing unit with high levels of [[pollution]]. The main component is [[organic matter]], stemming from de-[[pulping]] and [[mucilage]] removal.{{sfn|Von Enden|Calvert|2002a|p=4}} The majority of [[organic material]] in the wastewater is highly resistant and [[Chemical Oxygen Demand|COD]] values, the amount oxygen required to stabilize organic matter by using a strong oxidant, make up 80% of the pollution load, with values as high as 50&amp;nbsp;g/l.{{sfn|Von Enden|Calvert|2002|p=6}}{{sfn|Treagust|1994}} The [[Biological Oxygen Demand|BOD]], the amount of oxygen required for the biological decomposition of organic matter under aerobic conditions at a standardized temperature and time of incubation,{{sfn|Droste|1997}} coming from [[biodegradable]] organic material can reach values of 20&amp;nbsp;g/l.

With a (rough) screening and removal of the pulp COD and BOD values become considerably lower. Values in the range of 3 - 5&amp;nbsp;g/l for COD and 1.5– 3&amp;nbsp;g/l for BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref group=footnotes&gt;BOD values after 5 days&lt;/ref&gt; were found.{{sfn|De Matos|2001}} Recorded values of 2.5&amp;nbsp;g/l for COD and 1.5&amp;nbsp;g/l for BOD&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Bello-Mendoza|Calvo-Bado|Sánchez-Vázquez|Lau-Chong|1995}}{{sfn|Bello-Mendoza|Castillo-Rivera|1998|p=220}}

A large part of the organic matter, [[pectin]]s, precipitates as mucilated solids and could be taken out of the water.{{sfn|Von Enden|Calvert|2002a|p=6}} When these solids are not removed and [[pH]] values rise and an increase in COD can be observed.

In order to optimize the [[wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] processing of the wastewater pH values should be between 6.5 and 7.5, instead of the generally present values of pH=4, which is highly acidic. This is obtained by adding [[calcium hydroxide]] (CaOH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to the wastewater. This resulted in a regained solubility of the pectins, raising COD from an average of 3.7&amp;nbsp;g/l to an average of 12.7&amp;nbsp;g/l.

The water is further characterised by the presence of [[flavonoid]] compounds, coming from the skin of the cherries. Flavonoid compounds result in dark colouration of the water at a pH=7 or higher, but they do not add to BOD or COD levels of the wastewater, nor have major environmental impacts. Lower levels of transparency, however, can have a negative impact on [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] processes and growth and nutrient transformations by (especially) rooted water plants. Many efforts in [[olive]] and [[wine]] processing industries, with relatively large funds for research, have been trying to find a solution for this problem. Calvert mentions research done into the removal of [[polyphenol]]ics and flavonoid compounds by species of wood digesting fungi ([[Basidiomycetes]]) in a submerged solution with [[aeration]] using compressed air.{{sfn|Calvert|1997}} These complex processes seemed to be able to remove the colour compounds, but simplified, cheaper techniques using other types of fungi (i.e. ''[[Geotrichum]]'', ''[[Penicillium]]'', ''[[Aspergillus]]'') only thrived in highly diluted wastewaters.

Coffee wastewater is not a constant flow of water with uniform loadings of contamination. The processing of coffee cherries is a batch process and regarding water flows, two processes can be determined: de-pulping and fermentation/washing.

=== De-pulping ===
[[File:Coffee Mechinacal Seperator.jpg|thumb|A mechanical separator de-pulps coffee cherries with the aid of water]]

The water used for de-pulping of the cherries is referred to as pulping water. It accounts for just over half of the water used in the process. According to Von Enden and Calvert, "pulping water consists of quickly fermenting sugars from both pulp and mucilage components. Pulp and mucilage consists to a large extent of proteins, sugars and the mucilage in particular of pectins, i.e. polysaccharide carbohydrates.{{sfn|Von Enden|Calvert|2002a|p=4}} These sugars are fermenting using the enzymes from the bacteria on the cherries. Other components in pulping water are acids and toxic chemicals like polyphenolics (tannins) or alkaloids (caffeine).

Pulping water can be reused during the de-pulping of the harvest of one day. This results in an increase in organic matter and a decrease in pH. Research in Nicaragua showed COD averages rising from 5,400&amp;nbsp;mg/l up to 8,400&amp;nbsp;mg/l with most of the pulp removed.{{sfn|Grendelman|2006}} The drop in pH can be attributed to the start of fermentation of the pulping water. This drop continues until fermentation is finished and pH levels of around 4 are reached. The nutrient content of the pulping water at the maximum COD load, which was considered to reflect maximum pollution, was determined during this research. Total nitrogen (TN) concentration in the samples ranged from 50 to 110&amp;nbsp;mg/l with an average over all samples of 90&amp;nbsp;mg/l. Total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the samples ranged from 8.9 to 15.2&amp;nbsp;mg/l with an average over all samples of 12.4&amp;nbsp;mg/l.

=== Washing ===

Washing of the fermented beans leads to wastewater containing mainly pectins from the mucilage, proteins and sugars. The fermentation of the sugars (disaccharide carbohydrates) into ethanol and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to acid conditions in the washing water. The [[ethanol]] is converted in acetic acids after reaction with oxygen, lowering the pH to levels of around 4. The high acidity can negatively affect the treatment efficiency of treatment facilities treating the coffee wastewater like an anaerobic reactor or constructed wetlands and is considered to be detrimental for aquatic life when discharged directly into [[surface water]]s.

During the washing process the research in Nicaragua showed a clear decrease in contamination of the wastewater.{{sfn|Grendelman|2006}} The COD values drop from an average of 7,200&amp;nbsp;mg/l to less than 50&amp;nbsp;mg/l. Despite the fact that wastewater with COD values below 200&amp;nbsp;mg/l is allowed to be discharged in the natural waterways in Nicaragua it is advisable to redirect all the wastewater to the treatment system. This is because COD levels cannot be determined onsite during the washing process and discharge of the wastewater into surface waters is based on visual inspection. When the water is "clear" it is considered to be clean enough but the COD values measured during the research showed that discharge generally was to soon, resulting in wastewater with higher levels of COD than permitted. Another positive effect of diverting the wastewater to a treatment system is the dilution of the wastewater which enables better treatment by anaerobic bacteria due to more favourable pH values and better post-treatment due to lower concentrations of ammonium.

TN concentration in the samples of wastewater stemming from washing ranged from 40 to 150&amp;nbsp;mg/l with an average over all samples of 110&amp;nbsp;mg/l. TP concentration in the samples ranged from 7.8 to 15.8&amp;nbsp;mg/l with an average over all samples of 10.7&amp;nbsp;mg/l.

'''Colloidal gold''' is a [[sol (colloid)|sol]] or [[colloidal suspension]] of [[nanoparticles]] of [[gold]] in a fluid, usually water.  The colloid is usually either an intense red colour (for spherical particles less than 100&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]]) or blue/purple (for larger spherical particles or [[nanorod]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sapsford KE, Algar WR, Berti L, Gemmill KB, Casey BJ, Oh E, Stewart MH, Medintz IL | title = Functionalizing nanoparticles with biological molecules: developing chemistries that facilitate nanotechnology | language = EN | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 113 | issue = 3 | pages = 1904–2074 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23432378 | doi = 10.1021/cr300143v }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to their [[Metallic bond#Optical properties|optical]], electronic, and molecular-recognition properties, gold nanoparticles are the subject of substantial research, with many potential or promised applications in a wide variety of areas, including [[electron microscopy]], [[electronics]], [[nanotechnology]], [[materials science]], and [[biomedicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang X, Yang M, Pang B, Vara M, Xia Y | title = Gold Nanomaterials at Work in Biomedicine | journal = Chemical Reviews | volume = 115 | issue = 19 | pages = 10410–88 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26293344 | doi = 10.1021/acs.chemrev.5b00193 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;{{cite report | vauthors =Mulvaney P | title = The beauty and elegance of Nanocrystals: How invisibly small particles will colour and shape our future. | publisher = University of Melbourne | year = 2003 | url = http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/articleid_791.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20041028230241/http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/articleid_791.html | archive-date=2004-10-28 | dead-url = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rao |first1=C.

==History==
[[File:Vintage cranberry glass.jpg|thumb|left|This [[cranberry glass]] bowl was made by adding a gold salt (probably gold chloride) to molten glass.]] 
Used since ancient times as a method of [[Stained glass|staining glass]] colloidal gold was used in the 4th-century [[Lycurgus Cup]], which changes color depending on the location of light source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Lycurgus Cup|url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=61219&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Lycurgus%2520Cup|website = British Museum|access-date = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freestone|first=Ian|last2=Meeks|first2=Nigel|last3=Sax|first3=Margaret|last4=Higgitt|first4=Catherine | name-list-format = vanc |title=The Lycurgus Cup — A Roman nanotechnology |journal=Gold Bulletin|language=en|volume=40|issue=4|pages=270–277|doi=10.1007/BF03215599 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Middle Ages]], soluble gold, a solution containing [[Gold salts|gold salt]], had a reputation for its curative property for various diseases. In 1618, [[Francis Anthony]], a philosopher and member of the medical profession, published a book called ''Panacea Aurea, sive tractatus duo de ipsius Auro Potabili''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Panacea aurea sive Tractatus duo de ipsius auro potabili|last = Antonii|first = Francisci| name-list-format = vanc |publisher = Ex Bibliopolio Frobeniano|year = 1618|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (Latin: gold potion, or two treatments of [[Drinking water|potable]] gold). The book introduces information on the formation of colloidal gold and its medical uses. About half a century later, English botanist [[Nicholas Culpeper|Nicholas Culpepper]] published book in 1656, ''Treatise of Aurum Potabile'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Mr. Culpepper's Treatise of aurum potabile Being a description of the three-fold world, viz. elementary celestial intellectual containing the knowledge necessary to the study of hermetick philosophy.

In 1676, [[Johann von Löwenstern-Kunckel|Johann Kunckel]], a German chemist, published a book on the manufacture of stained glass. In his book ''Valuable Observations or Remarks About the Fixed and Volatile Salts-Auro and Argento Potabile, Spiritu Mundi and the Like'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Utiles observationes sive animadversiones de salibus fixis et volatilibus, auro et argento potabili (etc.)|last = Kunckel von Löwenstern|first = Johann | name-list-format = vanc |publisher = Wilson|year = 1678|isbn = |location = Austria|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kunckel assumed that the pink color of Aurum Potabile came from small particles of metallic gold, not visible to human eyes. In 1842, [[John Herschel]] invented a photographic process called chrysotype (from the Greek χρῡσός meaning "gold") that used colloidal gold to record images on paper.

Modern scientific evaluation of colloidal gold did not begin until [[Michael Faraday|Michael Faraday's]] work in the 1850s.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy VR | title = Gold nanoparticles: synthesis and applications. | journal = Synlett | date =  July 2006 | volume = 11 | pages = 1791–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Faraday_1857"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Faraday M |title=The Bakerian Lecture: Experimental Relations of Gold (and Other Metals) to Light |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |date=January 1857 |volume=147 |pages=145–181 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1857.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1856, in a basement laboratory of [[Royal Institution]], Faraday accidentally created a ruby red solution while mounting pieces of gold leaf onto microscope slides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Michael Faraday's gold colloids {{!}} The Royal Institution: Science Lives Here|url = http://www.rigb.org/our-history/iconic-objects/iconic-objects-list/faraday-gold-colloids|website = www.rigb.org|access-date = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since he was already interested in the properties of light and matter, Faraday further investigated the optical properties of the colloidal gold. He prepared the first pure sample of colloidal gold, which he called 'activated gold', in 1857. He used [[phosphorus]] to [[Redox|reduce]] a solution of gold chloride. The colloidal gold Faraday made 150 years ago is still optically active. For a long time, the composition of the 'ruby' gold was unclear. Several chemists suspected it to be a gold [[tin]] compound, due to its preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Annalen der Physik | year = 1832 | volume = 101 | issue = 8 | pages = 629–630 | title = Ueber den Cassius'schen Goldpurpur | last = Gay-Lussac | doi = 10.1002/andp.18321010809 | bibcode = 1832AnP...101..629G }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Annalen der Physik | volume = 98 | issue = 6 | pages = 306–308 | title = Ueber den Cassius' schen Goldpurpur | vauthors = Berzelius JJ | doi = 10.1002/andp.18310980613 | year = 1831 | bibcode = 1831AnP....98..306B }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Faraday recognized that the color was actually due to the miniature size of the gold particles. He noted the [[light scattering]] properties of suspended gold microparticles, which is now called [[Tyndall effect|Faraday-Tyndall effect]].&lt;ref name = "Faraday_1857" /&gt;

In 1898, [[Richard Adolf Zsigmondy]] prepared the first colloidal gold in diluted solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1925/zsigmondy-lecture.pdf | first = Richard | last = Zsigmondy | name-list-format = vanc | title = Properties of colloids | publisher = Nobel Foundation | date = December 11, 1926 | access-date = 2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Zsigmondy, [[Theodor Svedberg]], who invented [[ultracentrifugation]], and [[Gustav Mie]], who provided the [[Mie Scattering|theory for scattering and absorption by spherical particles]], were also interested in the synthesis and properties of colloidal gold.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Size dependence of Au NP-enhanced surface plasmon resonance based on differential phase measurement |journal=Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical |year=2013 |doi=10.1016/j.snb.2012.09.073 |volume=176|pages=1128–1133|last1=Zeng |first1=Shuwen |last2=Yu |first2=Xia |last3=Law |first3=Wing-Cheung |last4=Zhang |first4=Yating |last5=Hu |first5=Rui |last6=Dinh |first6=Xuan-Quyen |last7=H o|first7=Ho-Pui |last8=Yong |first8=Ken-Tye | name-list-format = vanc  |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268225952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With advances in various analytical technologies in the 20th century, studies on gold nanoparticles has accelerated. Advanced microscopy methods, such as [[atomic force microscopy]] and [[Electron microscope|electron microscopy]], have contributed the most to nanoparticle research. Due to their comparably easy synthesis and high stability, various gold particles have been studied for their practical uses. Different types of gold nanoparticle are already used in many industries, such as medicine and electronics. For example, several [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]-approved nanoparticles are currently used in [[drug delivery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter= Nanoparticle Therapeutics: FDA Approval, Clinical Trials, Regulatory Pathways, and Case Study |title=Biomedical Nanotechnology |volume = 726|pages = 325–338|publisher = Humana Press|date = 2011-01-01|isbn = 978-1-61779-051-5|series = Methods in Molecular Biology|doi = 10.1007/978-1-61779-052-2_21|pmid = 21424459|editor-first = Sarah J.|editor-last = Hurst | name-list-format = vanc |last1 = Eifler|first1 = A.

== Physical properties ==

=== Optical ===
Colloidal gold has been used by artists for centuries because of the nanoparticle’s interactions with visible light. Gold nanoparticles absorb and scatter light&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Michele L.|last2=Morris|first2=Catherine A.|last3=Stroud|first3=Rhonda M.|last4=Merzbacher|first4=Celia I.|last5=Rolison|first5=Debra R. | name-list-format = vanc |date=1999-02-01|title=Colloidal Gold Aerogels:  Preparation, Properties, and Characterization |journal=Langmuir|volume=15|issue=3|pages=674–681|doi=10.1021/la980784i }}&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in colours ranging from vibrant reds to blues to black and finally to clear and colorless, depending on particle size, shape, local refractive index, and aggregation state. These colors occur because of a phenomenon called [[Surface plasmon resonance|Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR)]], in which conduction electrons on the surface of the nanoparticle oscillate in resonance with incident light.

==== Effect of size ====

In addition to biological probes, gold nanoparticles can be transferred to various mineral substrates, such as mica, single crystal silicon, and atomically flat gold(III), to be observed under atomic force microscopy (AFM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Grobelny J, DelRio FW, Pradeep N, Kim DI, Hackley VA, Cook RF | chapter = Size measurement of nanoparticles using atomic force microscopy | veditors = McNeil SE |title=Characterization of nanoparticles intended for drug delivery |publisher=Humana Press |isbn=978-1-60327-198-1 | pages = 71–82 | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug delivery system===

Gold nanoparticles can be used to optimize the biodistribution of drugs to diseased organs, tissues or cells, in order to improve and target drug delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Han G, Ghosh P, Rotello VM | title = Functionalized gold nanoparticles for drug delivery | journal = Nanomedicine | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 113–23 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17716197 | doi = 10.2217/17435889.2.1.113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Han G, Ghosh P, Rotello VM | title = Multi-functional gold nanoparticles for drug delivery | journal = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | volume = 620 | issue =  | pages = 48–56 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18217334 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery is feasible only if the drug distribution is otherwise inadequate. These cases include drug targeting of unstable ([[protein]]s, [[Small interfering RNA|siRNA]], [[DNA]]), delivery to the difficult sites (brain, retina, tumors, intracellular organelles) and drugs with serious side effects (e.g. anti-cancer agents). The performance of the nanoparticles depends on the size and surface functionalities in the particles. Also, the drug release and particle disintegration can vary depending on the system (e.g. biodegradable polymers sensitive to pH). An optimal nanodrug delivery system ensures that the active drug is available at the site of action for the correct time and duration, and their concentration should be above the minimal effective concentration (MEC) and below the minimal toxic concentration (MTC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Langer R | title = Biomaterials in drug delivery and tissue engineering: one laboratory's experience | journal = Accounts of Chemical Research | volume = 33 | issue = 2 | pages = 94–101 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10673317 | doi = 10.1021/ar9800993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold nanoparticles are being investigated as carriers for drugs such as [[Paclitaxel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gibson JD, Khanal BP, Zubarev ER | title = Paclitaxel-functionalized gold nanoparticles | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 129 | issue = 37 | pages = 11653–61 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17718495 | doi = 10.1021/ja075181k }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The administration of hydrophobic drugs require [[molecular encapsulation]] and it is found that nanosized particles are particularly efficient in evading the [[reticuloendothelial system]].

===Tumor detection===
In cancer research, colloidal gold can be used to target tumors and provide detection using SERS ([[surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy]]) ''in vivo''.  These gold nanoparticles are surrounded with Raman reporters, which provide light emission that is over 200 times brighter than [[quantum dots]].  It was found that the Raman reporters were stabilized when the nanoparticles were encapsulated with a thiol-modified [[polyethylene glycol]] coat.  This allows for compatibility and circulation ''in vivo''.  To specifically target tumor cells, the [[polyethylene]]gylated gold particles are conjugated with an antibody (or an antibody fragment such as scFv), against, e.g. [[epidermal growth factor receptor]], which is sometimes overexpressed in cells of certain cancer types. Using SERS, these pegylated gold nanoparticles can then detect the location of the tumor.&lt;ref name="pmid18157119"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qian X, Peng XH, Ansari DO, Yin-Goen Q, Chen GZ, Shin DM, Yang L, Young AN, Wang MD, Nie S | title = In vivo tumor targeting and spectroscopic detection with surface-enhanced Raman nanoparticle tags | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–90 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18157119 | doi = 10.1038/nbt1377 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gold nanoparticles accumulate in tumors, due to the leakiness of tumor vasculature, and can be used as contrast agents for enhanced imaging in a time-resolved optical tomography system using short-pulse lasers for skin cancer detection in mouse model.  It is found that intravenously administrated spherical gold nanoparticles broadened the temporal profile of reflected optical signals and enhanced the contrast between surrounding normal tissue and tumors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sajjadi AY, Suratkar AA, Mitra KK, Grace MS | year = 2012 | title = Short-Pulse Laser-Based System for Detection of Tumors: Administration of Gold Nanoparticles Enhances Contrast | journal = J. Nanotechnol. Eng. Med. | volume = 3 | issue = 2| page = 021002 | doi = 10.1115/1.4007245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:tumor targeting.png|framed|right|Tumor targeting|framed|Tumor targeting via multifunctional nanocarriers. Cancer cells reduce adhesion to neighboring cells and migrate into the vasculature-rich stroma. Once at the vasculature, cells can freely enter the bloodstream. Once the tumor is directly connected to the main blood circulation system, multifunctional nanocarriers can interact directly with cancer cells and effectively target tumors.]]

===Gene therapy===
Gold nanoparticles have shown potential as intracellular delivery vehicles for siRNA oligonucleotides with maximal therapeutic impact.

[[File:Gold siRNA nanoparticles.png|framed|right|Multifunctional siRNA-gold nanoparticles with several biomolecules: PEG, cell penetration and cell adhesion peptides and siRNA. Two different approaches were employed to conjugate the siRNA to the gold nanoparticle: (1) '''Covalent approach''': use of thiolated siRNA for gold-thiol binding to the nanoparticle; (2) '''Ionic approach''': interaction of the negatively charged siRNA to the modified surface of the AuNP through ionic interactions.]]

Gold nanoparticles show potential as intracellular delivery vehicles for [[antisense]] oligonucleotides (ssDNA,dsDNA) by providing protection against intracellular [[nucleases]] and ease of functionalization for selective targeting.&lt;ref&gt;Giljohann DA, Seferos DS, Prigodich AE, Patel PC, Mirkin CA. ''Gene regulation with polyvalent siRNA-nanoparticle conjugates.'' J Am Chem Soc 2009;131:2072–2073.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photothermal agents===
[[Gold nanorods]] are being investigated as photothermal agents for in-vivo applications. [[Gold nanorods]] are rod-shaped gold nanoparticles whose aspect ratios tune the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band from the visible to near-infrared wavelength.  The total extinction of light at the SPR is made up of both absorption and scattering.  For the smaller axial diameter nanorods (~10&amp;nbsp;nm), absorption dominates, whereas for the larger axial diameter nanorods (&gt;35&amp;nbsp;nm) scattering can dominate.  As a consequence, for in-vivo studies, small diameter gold nanorods are being used as photothermal converters of near-infrared light due to their high absorption cross-sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mackey MA, Ali MR, Austin LA, Near RD, El-Sayed MA | title = The most effective gold nanorod size for plasmonic photothermal therapy: theory and in vitro experiments | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B | volume = 118 | issue = 5 | pages = 1319–26 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24433049 | pmc = 3983380 | doi = 10.1021/jp409298f }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since near-infrared light transmits readily through human skin and tissue, these nanorods can be used as ablation components for cancer, and other targets. When coated with polymers, gold nanorods have been observed to circulate in-vivo with half-lives longer than 6 hours, bodily residence times around 72 hours, and little to no uptake in any internal organs except the liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Niidome T, Yamagata M, Okamoto Y, Akiyama Y, Takahashi H, Kawano T, Katayama Y, Niidome Y | title = PEG-modified gold nanorods with a stealth character for in vivo applications | journal = Journal of Controlled Release | volume = 114 | issue = 3 | pages = 343–7 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16876898 | doi = 10.1016/j.jconrel.2006.06.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Apart from rod-like gold nanoparticles, also spherical colloidal gold nanoparticles are recently used as markers in combination with [[Photothermal optical microscopy|photothermal single particle microscopy]].

===Radiotherapy dose enhancer===
Considerable interest has been shown in the use of gold and other heavy-atom-containing nanoparticles to enhance the dose delivered to tumors.&lt;ref name="pmid15509078"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hainfeld JF, Slatkin DN, Smilowitz HM | title = The use of gold nanoparticles to enhance radiotherapy in mice | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 49 | issue = 18 | pages = N309–15 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15509078 | doi = | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the gold nanoparticles are taken up by the tumors more than the nearby healthy tissue, the dose is selectively enhanced. The biological effectiveness of this type of therapy seems to be due to the local deposition of the radiation dose near the nanoparticles.&lt;ref name="pmid22355537"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McMahon SJ, Hyland WB, Muir MF, Coulter JA, Jain S, Butterworth KT, Schettino G, Dickson GR, Hounsell AR, O'Sullivan JM, Prise KM, Hirst DG, Currell FJ | title = Biological consequences of nanoscale energy deposition near irradiated heavy atom nanoparticles | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 18 | date = 2011 | pmid = 22355537 | pmc = 3216506 | doi = 10.1038/srep00018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This mechanism is the same as occurs in [[heavy ion therapy]].

===Detection of toxic gas===
Researchers have developed simple inexpensive methods for on-site detection of [[hydrogen sulfide]] {{chem|H|2|S}} present in air based on the antiaggregation of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Dissolving {{chem|H|2|S}} into a weak [[alkali]]ne buffer solution leads to the formation of HS-, which can stabilize AuNPs and ensure they maintain their red color allowing for visual detection of toxic levels of {{chem|H|2|S}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Z, Chen Z, Wang S, Qu C, Chen L | title = On-site visual detection of hydrogen sulfide in air based on enhancing the stability of gold nanoparticles | journal = ACS Applied Materials &amp; Interfaces | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = 6300–7 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24754960 | doi = 10.1021/am500564w }}&lt;!--|access-date=16 May 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gold nanoparticle based biosensor===

Gold nanoparticles are incorporated into [[biosensor]]s to enhance its stability, sensitivity, and selectivity.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Xu S | title = Gold nanoparticle-based biosensors | journal = Gold Bulletin | year = 2010 | volume = 43 | pages = 29–41 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nanoparticle properties such as small size, high surface-to-volume ratio, and high surface energy allow immobilization of large range of biomolecules.

The exact amount of GSH can be derived via [[Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy|UV-vis spectroscopy]] through a [[calibration curve]].]]
Gold nanoparticles improve the sensitivity of optical sensor by response to the change in local refractive index.

=== Thin films ===
Gold nanoparticles capped with organic ligands, such as alkanethiol molecules, can self-assemble into large monolayers (&gt;cm&lt;math&gt;^{2}&lt;/math&gt;). The particles are first prepared in organic solvent, such as chloroform or toluene, and are then spread into monolayers either on a liquid surface or on a solid substrate.  Such interfacial thin films of nanoparticles have close relationship with [[Langmuir-Blodgett film|Langmuir-Blodgett]] monolayers made from surfactants.

The mechanical properties of nanoparticle monolayers have been studied extensively. For 5&amp;nbsp;nm spheres capped with dodecanethiol, the Young's modulus of the monolayer is on the order of GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mueggenburg KE, Lin XM, Goldsmith RH, Jaeger HM | title = Elastic membranes of close-packed nanoparticle arrays | journal = Nature Materials | volume = 6 | issue = 9 | pages = 656–60 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17643104 | doi = 10.1038/nmat1965 | bibcode = 2007NatMa...6..656M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanics of the membranes are guided by strong interactions between ligand shells on adjacent particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = He J, Kanjanaboos P, Frazer NL, Weis A, Lin XM, Jaeger HM | title = Fabrication and mechanical properties of large-scale freestanding nanoparticle membranes | journal = Small | volume = 6 | issue = 13 | pages = 1449–56 | date = July 2010 | pmid = 20521265 | doi = 10.1002/smll.201000114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon fracture, the films crack perpendicular to the direction of strain at a fracture stress of 11 &lt;math&gt;\pm&lt;/math&gt; 2.6 MPa, comparable to that of cross-linked polymer films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Kanjanaboos P, Barry E, McBride S, Lin XM, Jaeger HM | title = Fracture and failure of nanoparticle monolayers and multilayers | journal = Nano Letters | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 826–30 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24467462 | doi = 10.1021/nl404185b | bibcode = 2014NanoL..14..826W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Free-standing nanoparticle membranes exhibit bending rigidity on the order of 10&lt;math&gt;^{5}&lt;/math&gt; eV, higher than what is predicted in theory for continuum plates of the same thickness, due to nonlocal microstructural constraints such as nonlocal coupling of particle rotational degrees of freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang Y, Liao J, McBride SP, Efrati E, Lin XM, Jaeger HM | title = Strong Resistance to Bending Observed for Nanoparticle Membranes | journal = Nano Letters | volume = 15 | issue = 10 | pages = 6732–7 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26313627 | doi = 10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b02587 | bibcode = 2015NanoL..15.6732W }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, resistance to bending is found to be greatly reduced in nanoparticle monolayers that are supported at the air/water interface, possibly due to screening of ligand interactions in a wet environment.&lt;ref name="pmid28397901"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Griesemer SD, You SS, Kanjanaboos P, Calabro M, Jaeger HM, Rice SA, Lin B | title = The role of ligands in the mechanical properties of Langmuir nanoparticle films | journal = Soft Matter | volume = 13 | issue = 17 | pages = 3125–3133 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28397901 | doi = 10.1039/c7sm00319f }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surface chemistry ==
In many different types of colloidal gold syntheses, the [[Interface (chemistry)|interface]] of the nanoparticles can display widely different character – ranging from an interface similar to a [[self-assembled monolayer]] to a disordered boundary with no repeating patterns.&lt;ref name="Sperling 1333–1383"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sperling RA, Parak WJ | title = Surface modification, functionalization and bioconjugation of colloidal inorganic nanoparticles | journal = Philosophical Transactions. Series A, Mathematical, Physical, and Engineering Sciences | volume = 368 | issue = 1915 | pages = 1333–83 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20156828 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2009.0273 | bibcode = 2010RSPTA.368.1333S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the Au-Ligand interface, conjugation of the interfacial ligands with various functional [[Moiety (chemistry)|moieties]] (from small organic molecules to polymers to DNA to RNA) afford colloidal gold much of its vast functionality.

=== Ligand exchange/functionalization ===
After initial nanoparticle synthesis, colloidal gold ligands are often exchanged with new ligands designed for specific applications. For example, Au NPs produced via the Turkevich-style (or Citrate Reduction) method are readily reacted via ligand exchange reactions, due to the relatively weak binding between the carboxyl groups and the surfaces of the NPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tauran Y, Brioude A, Coleman AW, Rhimi M, Kim B | title = Molecular recognition by gold, silver and copper nanoparticles | journal = World Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 35–63 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23977421 | pmc = 3746278 | doi = 10.4331/wjbc.v4.i3.35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ligand exchange can produce conjugation with a number of biomolecules from DNA to RNA to proteins to polymers (such as [[Polyethylene glycol|PEG]]) to increase [[biocompatibility]] and functionality. For example, ligands have been shown to enhance [[Catalysis|catalytic activity]] by mediating interactions between adsorbates and the active gold surfaces for specific oxygenation reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Taguchi T, Isozaki K, Miki K | title = Enhanced catalytic activity of self-assembled-monolayer-capped gold nanoparticles | journal = Advanced Materials | volume = 24 | issue = 48 | pages = 6462–7 | date = December 2012 | pmid = 22968900 | doi = 10.1002/adma.201202979 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ligand exchange can also be used to promote phase transfer of the colloidal particles.&lt;ref name="Sperling 1333–1383"/&gt; Ligand exchange is also possible with alkane thiol-arrested NPs produced from the Brust-type synthesis method, although higher temperatures are needed to promote the rate of the ligand detachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heinecke CL, Ni TW, Malola S, Mäkinen V, Wong OA, Häkkinen H, Ackerson CJ | title = Structural and theoretical basis for ligand exchange on thiolate monolayer protected gold nanoclusters | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 134 | issue = 32 | pages = 13316–22 | date = August 2012 | pmid = 22816317 | pmc = 4624284 | doi = 10.1021/ja3032339 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perumal S, Hofmann A, Scholz N, Rühl E, Graf C | title = Kinetics study of the binding of multivalent ligands on size-selected gold nanoparticles | journal = Langmuir | volume = 27 | issue = 8 | pages = 4456–64 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21413796 | doi = 10.1021/la105134m }}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative method for further functionalization is achieved through the conjugation of the ligands with other molecules, though this method can cause the colloidal stability of the Au NPs to breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McMahon JM, Emory SR | title = Phase transfer of large gold nanoparticles to organic solvents with increased stability | journal = Langmuir | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 1414–8 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17241067 | doi = 10.1021/la0617560 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ligand removal ===
In many cases, as in various high-temperature catalytic applications of Au, the removal of the capping ligands produces more desirable physicochemical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tyo EC, Vajda S | title = Catalysis by clusters with precise numbers of atoms | journal = Nature Nanotechnology | volume = 10 | issue = 7 | pages = 577–88 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26139144 | doi = 10.1038/nnano.2015.140 | bibcode = 2015NatNa..10..577T | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1233471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal of ligands from colloidal gold while maintaining a relatively constant number of Au atoms per Au NP can be difficult due to the tendency for these bare clusters to aggregate. The removal of ligands is partially achievable by simply washing away all excess capping ligands, though this method is ineffective in removing all capping ligand. More often ligand removal achieved under high temperature or light [[ablation]] followed by washing. Alternatively, the ligands can be [[Electroetching|electrochemically etched]] off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niu|first=Zhiqiang|last2=Li|first2=Yadong | name-list-format = vanc |date=2014-01-14|title=Removal and Utilization of Capping Agents in Nanocatalysis |journal=Chemistry of Materials|volume=26|issue=1|pages=72–83|doi=10.1021/cm4022479 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surface structure and chemical environment ===
The precise structure of the ligands on the surface of colloidal gold NPs impact the properties of the colloidal gold particles. Binding conformations and surface packing of the capping ligands at the surface of the colloidal gold NPs tend to differ greatly from bulk surface model adsorption, largely due to the high curvature observed at the nanoparticle surfaces.&lt;ref name="Sperling 1333–1383"/&gt; Thiolate-gold interfaces at the nanoscale have been well-studied and the thiolate ligands are observed to pull Au atoms off of the surface of the particles to for “staple” motifs that have significant Thiyl-Au(0) character.&lt;ref name="Häkkinen 9927–9931"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Häkkinen H, Walter M, Grönbeck H | title = Divide and protect: capping gold nanoclusters with molecular gold-thiolate rings | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B | volume = 110 | issue = 20 | pages = 9927–31 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16706449 | doi = 10.1021/jp0619787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Häkkinen 9927–9931"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reimers JR, Ford MJ, Halder A, Ulstrup J, Hush NS | title = Gold surfaces and nanoparticles are protected by Au(0)-thiyl species and are destroyed when Au(I)-thiolates form | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 113 | issue = 11 | pages = E1424–33 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26929334 | pmc = 4801306 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1600472113 | bibcode = 2016PNAS..113E1424R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The citrate-gold surface, on the other hand, is relatively less-studied due to the vast number of binding conformations of the citrate to the curved gold surfaces. A study performed in 2014 identified that the most-preferred binding of the citrate involves two carboxylic acids and the hydroxyl group of the citrate binds three surface metal atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Park JW, Shumaker-Parry JS | title = Structural study of citrate layers on gold nanoparticles: role of intermolecular interactions in stabilizing nanoparticles | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 136 | issue = 5 | pages = 1907–21 | date = February 2014 | pmid = 24422457 | doi = 10.1021/ja4097384 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and safety==
{{See also|Health and safety hazards of nanomaterials|Nanotoxicology}}

As gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are further investigated for targeted drug delivery in humans, their toxicity needs to be considered. For the most part, it is suggested that AuNPs are biocompatible,{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}} but the concentrations at which they become toxic needs to be determined, and if those concentrations fall within the range of used concentrations. Toxicity can be tested ''[[in vitro]]'' and ''[[in vivo]]''. ''In vitro'' toxicity results can vary depending on the type of the cellular growth media with different protein compositions, the method used to determine cellular toxicity (cell health, cell stress, how many cells are taken into a cell), and the capping ligands in solution.&lt;ref name = "Alkilany"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alkilany AM, Murphy CJ | title = Toxicity and cellular uptake of gold nanoparticles: what we have learned so far? | journal = Journal of Nanoparticle Research | volume = 12 | issue = 7 | pages = 2313–2333 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 21170131 | pmc = 2988217 | doi = 10.1007/s11051-010-9911-8 | bibcode = 2010JNR....12.2313A }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''In vivo'' assessments can determine the general health of an organism (abnormal behavior, weight loss, average life span) as well as tissue specific toxicology (kidney, liver, blood) and inflammation and oxidative responses.&lt;ref name="Alkilany"/&gt; ''In vitro'' experiments are more popular than ''in vivo'' experiments because ''in vitro'' experiments are more simplistic to perform than ''in vivo'' experiments.&lt;ref name="Alkilany"/&gt;

===Toxicity and hazards in synthesis===
While AuNPs themselves appear to have low or negligible toxicity,{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and the literature shows that the toxicity has much more to do with the ligands rather than the particles themselves, the synthesis of them involves chemicals that are hazardous. [[Sodium borohydride]], a harsh reagent, is used to reduce the gold ions to gold metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perala SR, Kumar S | title = On the mechanism of metal nanoparticle synthesis in the Brust-Schiffrin method | journal = Langmuir | volume = 29 | issue = 31 | pages = 9863–73 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23848382 | doi = 10.1021/la401604q }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gold ions usually come from [[chloroauric acid]], a potent acid.&lt;ref name="Cellular uptake"/&gt; Because of the high toxicity and hazard of reagents used to synthesize AuNPs, the need for more “green” methods of synthesis arose.

===Toxicity due to capping ligands===
Some of the capping ligands associated with AuNPs can be toxic while others are nontoxic. In gold nanorods (AuNRs), it has been shown that a strong cytotoxicity was associated with [[Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide|CTAB]]-stabilized AuNRs at low concentration, but it is thought that free CTAB was the culprit in toxicity .&lt;ref name="Cellular uptake"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Alkilany AM, Nagaria PK, Hexel CR, Shaw TJ, Murphy CJ, Wyatt MD | title = Cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of gold nanorods: molecular origin of cytotoxicity and surface effects | journal = Small | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 701–8 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19226599 | doi = 10.1002/smll.200801546 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Takahashi H, Niidome Y, Niidome T, Kaneko K, Kawasaki H, Yamada S | title = Modification of gold nanorods using phosphatidylcholine to reduce cytotoxicity | journal = Langmuir | volume = 22 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–5 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16378388 | doi = 10.1021/la0520029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modifications that overcoat these AuNRs reduces this toxicity in human colon cancer cells (HT-29) by preventing CTAB molecules from desorbing from the AuNRs back into the solution.&lt;ref name="Cellular uptake" /&gt;
Ligand toxicity can also be seen in AuNPs. Compared to the 90% toxicity of HAuCl4 at the same concentration, AuNPs with carboxylate termini were shown to be non-toxic.&lt;ref name="Rotello Toxicity"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman CM, McCusker CD, Yilmaz T, Rotello VM | title = Toxicity of gold nanoparticles functionalized with cationic and anionic side chains | journal = Bioconjugate Chemistry | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 897–900 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15264879 | doi = 10.1021/bo049951i | doi-broken-date = 2018-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Large AuNPs conjugated with biotin, cysteine, citrate, and glucose were not toxic in human leukemia cells ([[K562]]) for concentrations up to 0.25 M.&lt;ref name="Murphy Jan 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Connor EE, Mwamuka J, Gole A, Murphy CJ, Wyatt MD | title = Gold nanoparticles are taken up by human cells but do not cause acute cytotoxicity | journal = Small | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 325–7 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 17193451 | doi = 10.1002/smll.2004000093 | doi-broken-date = 2018-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, citrate-capped gold nanospheres (AuNSs) have been proven to be compatible with human blood and did not cause platelet aggregation or an immune response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobrovolskaia MA, Patri AK, Zheng J, Clogston JD, Ayub N, Aggarwal P, Neun BW, Hall JB, McNeil SE | title = Interaction of colloidal gold nanoparticles with human blood: effects on particle size and analysis of plasma protein binding profiles | journal = Nanomedicine | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 106–17 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19071065 | pmc = 3683956 | doi = 10.1016/j.nano.2008.08.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, citrate-capped gold nanoparticles sizes 8-37&amp;nbsp;nm were found to be lethally toxic for mice, causing shorter lifespans, severe sickness, loss of appetite and weight, hair discoloration, and damage to the liver, spleen, and lungs; gold nanoparticles accumulated in the spleen and liver after traveling a section of the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen YS, Hung YC, Liau I, Huang GS | title = Assessment of the In Vivo Toxicity of Gold Nanoparticles | journal = Nanoscale Research Letters | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = 858–864 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 20596373 | pmc = 2894102 | doi = 10.1007/s11671-009-9334-6 | bibcode = 2009NRL.....4..858C }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are mixed-views for [[polyethylene glycol]] (PEG)-modified AuNPs. These AuNPs were found to be toxic in mouse liver by injection, causing cell death and minor inflammation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho WS, Cho M, Jeong J, Choi M, Cho HY, Han BS, Kim SH, Kim HO, Lim YT, Chung BH, Jeong J | title = Acute toxicity and pharmacokinetics of 13 nm-sized PEG-coated gold nanoparticles | journal = Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology | volume = 236 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–24 | date = April 2009 | pmid = 19162059 | doi = 10.1016/j.taap.2008.12.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, AuNPs conjugated with PEG copolymers showed negligible toxicity towards human colon cells ([[Caco-2]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gref R, Couvreur P, Barratt G, Mysiakine E | title = Surface-engineered nanoparticles for multiple ligand coupling | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 24 | issue = 24 | pages = 4529–37 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 12922162 | doi = 10.1016/s0142-9612(03)00348-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
AuNP toxicity also depends on the overall charge of the ligands. In certain doses, AuNSs that have positively-charged ligands are toxic in monkey kidney cells (Cos-1), human red blood cells, and E. coli because of the AuNSs interaction with the negatively-charged cell membrane; AuNSs with negatively-charged ligands have been found to be nontoxic in these species.&lt;ref name="Rotello Toxicity" /&gt;
In addition to the previously mentioned ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' experiments, other similar experiments have been performed.

===Toxicity due to size of nanoparticles===
Toxicity in certain systems can also be dependent on the size of the nanoparticle. AuNSs size 1.4&amp;nbsp;nm were found to be toxic in human skin cancer cells (SK-Mel-28), human cervical cancer cells ([[HeLa]]), mouse [[fibroblast]] cells (L929), and mouse [[macrophages]] (J774A.1), while 0.8, 1.2, and 1.8&amp;nbsp;nm sized AuNSs were less toxic by a six-fold amount and 15&amp;nbsp;nm AuNSs were nontoxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman CM, McCusker CD, Yilmaz T, Rotello VM | title = Toxicity of gold nanoparticles functionalized with cationic and anionic side chains | journal = Bioconjugate Chemistry | volume = 15 | issue = 4 | pages = 897–900 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15264879 | doi = 10.1021/bc049951i }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence for AuNP buildup after injection in ''in vivo'' studies, but this is very size dependent. 1.8&amp;nbsp;nm AuNPs were found to be almost totally trapped in the lungs of rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gratton SE, Pohlhaus PD, Lee J, Guo J, Cho MJ, Desimone JM | title = Nanofabricated particles for engineered drug therapies: a preliminary biodistribution study of PRINT nanoparticles | journal = Journal of Controlled Release | volume = 121 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 10–8 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17643544 | pmc = 1994820 | doi = 10.1016/j.jconrel.2007.05.027 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different sized AuNPs were found to buildup in the blood,&lt;ref name="Sonavane" &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sonavane G, Tomoda K, Makino K | title = Biodistribution of colloidal gold nanoparticles after intravenous administration: effect of particle size | journal = Colloids and Surfaces.

== Synthesis ==
[[File:Gold nanoparticle Zeta-potential.png|thumb|300px|Potential difference as a function of distance from particle surface.]]
Generally, gold nanoparticles are produced in a liquid ("liquid chemical methods") by [[reduction (chemistry)|reduction]] of [[chloroauric acid]] (H[AuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]).  After dissolving H[AuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], the solution is rapidly stirred while a [[reducing agent]] is added.  This causes Au&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; [[ion]]s to be reduced to Au&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;[[ion]]s. Then a disproportionation reaction occurs whereby 3 Au&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions give rise to Au&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and 2 Au&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; atoms. The Au&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; atoms act as center of nucleation around which further Au&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions gets reduced. To prevent the particles from aggregating, some sort of stabilizing agent that sticks to the nanoparticle surface is usually added. In the Turkevich method of Au NP synthesis, citrate initially acts as the reducing agent and finally as the capping agent which stabilizes the Au NP through electrostatic interactions between the lone pair of electrons on the oxygen and the metal surface.

They can be functionalized with various organic ligands to create organic-inorganic hybrids with advanced functionality.&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;

=== Turkevich method ===
The method pioneered by J. Turkevich et al. in 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Turkevich J, Stevenson PC, Hillier J | year = 1951 | title = A study of the nucleation and growth processes in the synthesis of colloidal gold | journal = Discuss.

Frens in the 1970s,&lt;ref name="G.

In general, it is used to produce modestly [[monodisperse]] spherical gold nanoparticles suspended in water of around 10–20&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter.  Larger particles can be produced, but this comes at the cost of monodispersity and shape. It involves the reaction of small amounts of hot [[chloroauric acid]] with small amounts of [[sodium citrate]] solution. The colloidal gold will form because the citrate ions act as both a reducing agent and a capping agent. A capping agent is used in nanoparticle synthesis to stop particle growth and aggregation. A good capping agent has a high affinity for the new nuclei so it will bind to surface atoms which stabilizes the surface energy of the new nuclei and makes so that they cannot bind to other nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/cm4022479 | volume=26 | title=Removal and Utilization of Capping Agents in Nanocatalysis | year=2014 | journal=Chemistry of Materials | pages=72–83 | last1 = Niu | first1 = Zhiqiang | last2 = Li | first2 = Yadong | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the evolution of the spherical gold nanoparticles in the Turkevich reaction has been elucidated. Extensive networks of gold nanowires are formed as a transient intermediate. These gold nanowires are responsible for the dark appearance of the reaction solution before it turns ruby-red.&lt;ref name = "Pong, BK 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pong BK, Elim HI, Chong JX, Trout BL, Lee JY | year = 2007 | title = New Insights on the Nanoparticle Growth Mechanism in the Citrate Reduction of Gold(III) Salt: Formation of the Au Nanowire Intermediate and Its Nonlinear Optical Properties | journal = J. Phys. Chem. C | volume = 111 | issue = 17| pages = 6281–6287 | doi = 10.1021/jp068666o }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To produce larger particles, less sodium citrate should be added (possibly down to 0.05%, after which there simply would not be enough to reduce all the gold).  The reduction in the amount of sodium citrate will reduce the amount of the citrate ions available for stabilizing the particles, and this will cause the small particles to aggregate into bigger ones (until the total surface area of all particles becomes small enough to be covered by the existing citrate ions).

===Brust-Schiffrin method===
This method was discovered by Brust and Schiffrin in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1994|title=Synthesis of Thiol-derivatised Gold Nanoparticles in a Two-phase Liquid-Liquid System|journal=Chem. Commun.|issue=7|pages=801–802|doi=10.1039/C39940000801 | vauthors = Brust M, Walker M, Bethell D, Schiffrin DJ, Whyman R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be used to produce gold nanoparticles in [[organic liquid]]s that are normally not [[miscible]] with water (like [[toluene]]). It involves the reaction of a [[chlorauric acid]] solution with [[tetraoctylammonium bromide]] (TOAB) solution in [[toluene]] and [[sodium borohydride]] as an anti-coagulant and a reducing agent, respectively.

Here, the gold nanoparticles will be around 5–6&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manna A, Chen P, Akiyama H, Wei T, Tamada K, Knoll W |title=Optimized Photoisomerization on Gold Nanoparticles Capped by Unsymmetrical Azobenzene Disulfides |journal= Chemistry of Materials |year=2003 |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |doi=10.1021/cm0207696 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is the reducing agent, and TOAB is both the [[phase transfer catalyst]] and the stabilizing agent.

TOAB does not bind to the gold nanoparticles particularly strongly, so the solution will aggregate gradually over the course of approximately two weeks. To prevent this, one can add a stronger binding agent, like a [[thiol]] (in particular, [[alkanethiol]]s), which will bind to gold, producing a near-permanent solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gao J, Huang X, Liu H, Zan F, Ren J | title = Colloidal stability of gold nanoparticles modified with thiol compounds: bioconjugation and application in cancer cell imaging | journal = Langmuir | volume = 28 | issue = 9 | pages = 4464–71 | date = March 2012 | pmid = 22276658 | doi = 10.1021/la204289k }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bekalé, Laurent, Saïd Barazzouk, and Surat Hotchandani. "Beneficial Role of Gold Nanoparticles as Photoprotector of Magnesium Tetraphenylporphyrin." SpringerReference (n.d.): n. pag. Web. 14 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Alkanethiol protected gold nanoparticles can be precipitated and then redissolved. Thiols are better binding agents because there is a strong affinity for the gold-sulfur bonds that form when the two substances react with each other.&lt;ref name="pmid10639073"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Templeton AC, Wuelfing WP, Murray RW | title = Monolayer-protected cluster molecules | journal = Accounts of Chemical Research | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–36 | date = January 2000 | pmid = 10639073 | doi = 10.1021/ar9602664 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.501.2383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tetra-dodecanthiol is a commonly used strong binding agent to synthesize smaller particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Louis C | veditors = Louis C, Pluchery O |title=Gold nanoparticles for physics, chemistry and biology |isbn=978-1-78634-124-2 |edition=Second | location = Hackensack (N.J.) ; London | publisher = World Scientific | year = 2017 | chapter = Chemical preparation of gold nanoparticles on surfaces | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2c-6CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA155&amp;dq=Tetra-dodecanthiol+gold+nanoparticles | page = 155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the phase transfer agent may remain bound to the purified nanoparticles, this may affect physical properties such as [[solubility]]. In order to remove as much of this agent as possible, the nanoparticles must be further purified by [[soxhlet extraction]].

===Perrault method===
This approach, discovered by Perrault and Chan in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perrault SD, Chan WC | title = Synthesis and surface modification of highly monodispersed, spherical gold nanoparticles of 50-200 nm | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 131 | issue = 47 | pages = 17042–3 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19891442 | doi = 10.1021/ja907069u }}&lt;/ref&gt; uses hydroquinone to reduce HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; in an aqueous solution that contains 15&amp;nbsp;nm gold nanoparticle seeds. This seed-based method of synthesis is similar to that used in photographic film development, in which silver grains within the film grow through addition of reduced silver onto their surface. Likewise, gold nanoparticles can act in conjunction with hydroquinone to catalyze reduction of ionic gold onto their surface. The presence of a stabilizer such as citrate results in controlled deposition of gold atoms onto the particles, and growth. Typically, the nanoparticle seeds are produced using the citrate method. The hydroquinone method complements that of Frens,&lt;ref name="G. Frens 1972"/&gt;&lt;ref name="G. Frens 1973"/&gt; as it extends the range of monodispersed spherical particle sizes that can be produced. Whereas the Frens method is ideal for particles of 12–20&amp;nbsp;nm, the hydroquinone method can produce particles of at least 30–300&amp;nbsp;nm.

===Martin method===
This simple method, discovered by Martin and Eah in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin MN, Basham JI, Chando P, Eah SK | title = Charged gold nanoparticles in non-polar solvents: 10-min synthesis and 2D self-assembly | journal = Langmuir | volume = 26 | issue = 10 | pages = 7410–7 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20392108 | doi = 10.1021/la100591h }}  A 3-min demonstration video for the Martin synthesis method is available at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqkwM9o1s-w YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt; generates nearly monodisperse "naked" gold nanoparticles in water. Precisely controlling the reduction stoichiometry by adjusting the ratio of NaBH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-NaOH ions to HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-HCl ions within the "sweet zone," along with heating, enables reproducible diameter tuning between 3–6&amp;nbsp;nm. The aqueous particles are colloidally stable due to their high charge from the excess ions in solution. These particles can be coated with various hydrophilic functionalities, or mixed with hydrophobic ligands for applications in non-polar solvents. In non-polar solvents the nanoparticles remain highly charged, and self-assemble on liquid droplets to form 2D monolayer films of monodisperse nanoparticles.

=== Nanotech studies===
''Bacillus licheniformis'' can be used in synthesis of gold nanocubes with sizes between 10 and 100 nanometres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalishwaralal K, Deepak V, Ram Kumar Pandian S, Gurunathan S | title = Biological synthesis of gold nanocubes from Bacillus licheniformis | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 100 | issue = 21 | pages = 5356–8 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19574037 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2009.05.051 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gold nanoparticles are usually synthesized at high temperatures in organic solvents or using toxic reagents. The bacteria produce them in much milder conditions.

=== Navarro et al. method ===
For particles larger than 30&amp;nbsp;nm, control of particle size with a low polydispersity of spherical gold nanoparticles remains challenging. In order to provide maximum control on the NP structure, Navarro and co-workers used a modified Turkevitch-Frens procedure using sodium acetylacetonate Na(acac) as the reducing agent and sodium citrate as the stabilizer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Navarro JR, Lerouge F, Cepraga C, Micouin G, Favier A, Chateau D, Charreyre MT, Lanoë PH, Monnereau C, Chaput F, Marotte S, Leverrier Y, Marvel J, Kamada K, Andraud C, Baldeck PL, Parola S | title = Nanocarriers with ultrahigh chromophore loading for fluorescence bio-imaging and photodynamic therapy | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 34 | issue = 33 | pages = 8344–51 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23915950 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2013.07.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sonolysis ===
Another method for the experimental generation of gold particles is by [[sonolysis]]. The first method of this type was invented by Baigent and Müller.&lt;ref name="baigent"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baigent CL, Müller G | year = 1980 | title = A colloidal gold prepared using ultrasonics | journal = Experientia | volume = 36 | issue = 4| pages = 472–473 | doi=10.1007/BF01975154}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work pioneered the use of ultrasound to provide the energy for the processes involved and allowed the creation of gold particles with a diameter of under 10&amp;nbsp;nm. In another method using ultrasound, the reaction of an aqueous solution of HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with [[glucose]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Du J, Han B, Liu Z, Jiang T, Zhang Z | title = Sonochemical formation of single-crystalline gold nanobelts | journal = Angewandte Chemie | volume = 45 | issue = 7 | pages = 1116–9 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16389606 | doi = 10.1002/ange.200503762 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[reducing agent]]s are hydroxyl radicals and sugar [[pyrolysis]] [[radical (chemistry)|radicals]] (forming at the interfacial region between the collapsing cavities and the bulk water) and the morphology obtained is that of nanoribbons with width 30–50&amp;nbsp;nm and length of several micrometers. These ribbons are very flexible and can bend with angles larger than 90°. When glucose is replaced by [[cyclodextrin]] (a glucose oligomer), only spherical gold particles are obtained, suggesting that glucose is essential in directing the morphology toward a ribbon.

=== Block copolymer-mediated method ===
An economical, environmentally benign and fast synthesis methodology for gold nanoparticles using block copolymer has been developed by Sakai et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sakai T, Alexandridis P | title = Mechanism of gold metal ion reduction, nanoparticle growth and size control in aqueous amphiphilic block copolymer solutions at ambient conditions | journal = The Journal of Physical Chemistry B | volume = 109 | issue = 16 | pages = 7766–77 | date = April 2005 | pmid = 16851902 | doi = 10.1021/jp046221z }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this synthesis methodology, block copolymer plays the dual role of a reducing agent as well as a stabilizing agent. The formation of gold nanoparticles comprises three main steps: reduction of gold salt ion by block copolymers in the solution and formation of gold clusters, adsorption of block copolymers on gold clusters and further reduction of gold salt ions on the surfaces of these gold clusters for the growth of gold particles in steps, and finally its stabilization by block copolymers. But this method usually has a limited-yield (nanoparticle concentration), which does not increase with the increase in the gold salt concentration. Recently, Ray et al. demonstrated that the presence of an additional [[reductant]] ([[trisodium citrate]]) in 1:1 [[mole ratio]] with gold salt enhances the yield by manyfold at ambient conditions and [[room temperature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ray D, Aswal VK, Kohlbrecher J | title = Synthesis and characterization of high concentration block copolymer-mediated gold nanoparticles | journal = Langmuir | volume = 27 | issue = 7 | pages = 4048–56 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21366279 | doi = 10.1021/la2001706 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17151">In [[chemistry]], [[crystallography]], and [[materials science]] the ''''''coordination number''',''' also called '''ligancy,''' of a central [[atom]] in a [[molecule]] or [[crystal]] is the number of atoms, molecules or ions bonded to it. The ion/molecule/atom surrounding the central ion/molecule/atom is called a [[ligand]]. This number is determined somewhat differently for molecules than for crystals.

For molecules and polyatomic ions the coordination number of an atom is determined by simply counting the other atoms to which it is bonded (by either single or multiple bonds).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{GoldBookRef | title = coordination number | file = C01331}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [Cr(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; has Cr&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; as its central cation, and has a coordination number of 6.

However the solid-state structures of crystals often have less clearly defined [[chemical bond|bonds]], and in these cases a count of neighboring atoms is employed. The simplest method is one used in [[materials science]]. The usual value of the coordination number for a given structure refers to an atom in the interior of a [[crystal lattice]] with neighbors in all directions. In contexts where crystal surfaces are important, such as materials science and [[heterogeneous catalysis]], the value for an interior atom is the '''bulk coordination number''', while the value for an atom at a surface of the crystal is the '''surface coordination number'''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In chemistry, '''coordination number''' (C.N.), defined originally in 1893 by [[Alfred Werner]], is the total number of neighbors of a central atom in a molecule or ion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=A.K. |last=De |date=2003 |title=A Text Book of Inorganic Chemistry |page=88 |publisher=New Age International Publishers |ISBN=8122413846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a carbon atom has four [[chemical bonds]] in most stable molecules, the coordination number of each [[carbon]] is four in [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), three in [[ethylene]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, each C is bonded to 2H + 1C = 3 atoms), and two in [[acetylene]] (HC≡CH). In effect we count the first bond (or [[sigma bond]]) to each neighboring atom, but not the other bonds ([[pi bond]]s).

In [[coordination complex]]es, only the first or sigma bond between each [[ligand]] and the central atom counts, but not any pi bonds to the same ligands. In [[tungsten hexacarbonyl]], W(CO)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, the coordination number of [[tungsten]] (W) is counted as six although pi as well as sigma bonding is important in such [[metal carbonyl]]s.

The most common coordination number for ''d-''block transition metal complexes is 6, with an octahedral geometry.  The observed range is 2 (e.g., Au&lt;sup&gt;I&lt;/sup&gt; in Ph&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PAuCl) to 9 (e.g., Re&lt;sup&gt;VII&lt;/sup&gt; in [ReH&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;).  Metals in the ''f''-block (the [[Lanthanide|lanthanoids]] and [[Actinide|actinoids]]) can accommodate higher coordination number due to their greater ionic radii and availability of more orbitals for bonding.  Coordination numbers of 8 to 12 are commonly observed for ''f''-block elements.  For example, with [[bidentate]] [[nitrate]] ions as ligands, Ce&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; and Th&lt;sup&gt;IV&lt;/sup&gt; form the 12-coordinate ions [Ce(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[ceric ammonium nitrate]]) and [Th(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;.  When the surrounding ligands are much smaller than the central atom, even higher coordination numbers may be possible. One [[computational chemistry]] study predicted a particularly stable {{chem|PbHe|15|2+}} ion composed of a central [[lead]] ion coordinated with no fewer than 15 helium atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Search for the Species with the Highest Coordination Number|first1= Andreas |last1=Hermann |first2=Matthias |last2=Lein |first3=Peter |last3=Schwerdtfeger|doi=10.1002/anie.200604148|year=2007|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|volume=46|issue=14|pages=2444 |pmid=17315141}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the opposite extreme, steric shielding can give rise to unusually low coordination numbers.  An extremely rare instance of a metal adopting a coordination number of 1 occurs in the [[terphenyl]]-based arylthallium(I) complex 2,6-Tipp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Tl, where Tipp is the 2,4,6-triisopropylphenyl group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niemeyer|first=Mark|last2=Power|first2=Philip P.|date=1998-05-18|title=Synthesis and Solid-State Structure of 2,6-Trip2C6H3Tl (Trip=2,4,6-iPr3C6H2): A Monomeric Arylthallium(I) Compound with a Singly Coordinated Thallium Atom|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19980518)37:93.0.CO;2-1/abstract|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition|language=en|volume=37|issue=9|pages=1277–1279|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19980518)37:93.0.CO;2-1|issn=1521-3773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For π-electron ligands such as the [[cyclopentadienide]] ion [C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, [[alkene]]s and the [[cyclooctatetraenide]] ion [C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, the number of atoms in the π-electron system that bind to the central atom is termed the [[hapticity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{GoldBookRef | title = hapticity | file = H01881}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ferrocene]] the hapticity, ''η'', of each cyclopentadienide anion is five, Fe(''η''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. There are various ways of assigning the contribution made to the coordination number of the central iron atom by each cyclopentadienide ligand. The contribution could be assigned as one since there is one ligand, or as five since there are five neighbouring atoms, or as three since there are three electron pairs involved. Normally the count of electron pairs is taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Organometallic Chemistry of the Transition Metals |first=Robert H. |last=Crabtree |date=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |ISBN=9780470257623}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crystalline substances==
In order to determine the coordination number of an atom in a crystal, the crystal structure has first to be determined. This is achieved using [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray]], [[neutron diffraction|neutron]] or [[electron diffraction|electron]] diffraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Crystal Structure Determination |first=Werner |last=Massa |pages=67–92 |edition=English |date=1999 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the positions of the atoms within the unit cell of the crystal are known the coordination number of an atom can be determined. For molecular solids or coordination complexes the units of the polyatomic species can be detected and a count of the bonds can be performed. Solids with lattice structures which includes metals and many inorganic solids can have regular structures where coordinating atoms are all at the same distance and they form the vertices of a [[coordination geometry|coordination polyhedron]]. However, there are also many such solids where the structures are irregular. In [[materials science]], the '''bulk coordination number''' of a given atom in the interior of a [[crystal lattice]] is the number of nearest neighbours to a given atom.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} For an atom at a surface of a crystal, the '''surface coordination number''' is always less than the bulk coordination number. The surface coordination number is dependent on the [[Miller index|Miller indices]] of the surface. In a [[Cubic crystal system|body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal]], the bulk coordination number is 8, whereas, for the (100) surface, the surface coordination number is 4.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}&lt;!---These definitions square with the usage in the literature but a reference for the difinition is required--&gt;

α-Aluminium has a regular cubic close packed structure, [[face-centered cubic|fcc]], where each aluminium atom has 12 nearest neighbors, 6 in the same plane and 3 above and below and the coordination polyhedron is a [[cuboctahedron]]. α-Iron has a [[Cubic crystal system|body centered cubic]] structure where each iron atom has 8 nearest neighbors situated at the corners of a cube. 
[[Image:Graphite-sheet-3D-balls.png|left|thumb|100px|A graphite layer, carbon atoms and C–C bonds shown in black.]]The two most common [[allotropes]] of carbon have different coordination numbers. In [[diamond]], each carbon atom is at the centre of a regular [[tetrahedron]] formed by four other carbon atoms, the coordination number is four, as for methane. [[Graphite]] is made of two-dimensional layers in which each carbon is covalently bonded to three other carbons; atoms in other layers are further away and are not nearest neighbours, giving a coordination number of 3.&lt;ref name = "Wells"/&gt;

[[File:Lattice body centered cubic.svg|left|thumb|100px|bcc structure]][[File:NaCl polyhedra.png|right|thumb|100px|rock salt structure]]For chemical compounds with regular lattices such as [[sodium chloride]] and [[caesium chloride]], a count of the nearest neighbors gives a good picture of the environment of the ions. In sodium chloride each sodium ion has 6 chloride ions as nearest neighbours (at 276&amp;nbsp;pm) at the corners of an [[octahedron]] and each chloride ion has 6 sodium atoms (also at 276&amp;nbsp;pm) at the corners of an octahedron. In caesium chloride each caesium has 8 chloride ions (at 356 pm) situated at the corners of a [[cube]] and each chloride has eight caesium ions (also at 356&amp;nbsp;pm) at the corners of a cube.

However, not all crystal structures are regular and the neighboring atoms may not all be at the same distance. In these cases a different definition of coordination number is used that includes atoms at a greater distance than the nearest neighbours. The very broad definition adopted by the [[International Union of Crystallography]], IUCR, states that the coordination number of an atom in a crystalline solid depends on the chemical bonding model and the way in which the coordination number is calculated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ww1.iucr.org/comm/cnom/inorg/node4.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mittemeijer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of Materials Science: The Microstructure–Property Relationship using metals as model systems |first=Eric J. |last=Mittemeijer |date=2010 |publisher=Springer |ISBN=9783642105005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some metals have irregular structures. For example, zinc has a distorted hexagonal close packed structure. Regular hexagonal close packing of spheres would predict that each atom has 12 nearest neighbours and a [[triangular orthobicupola]] (also called an anticuboctahedron or twinned cuboctahedron) coordination polyhedron.&lt;ref name = "Wells"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wells |first=A.F. |date=1984 |title=Structural Inorganic Chemistry |edition=5th |publisher=Oxford Science Publications |ISBN=0198553706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fundamentals of the Physics of Solids: Volume 1: Structure and Dynamics |first1=A. |last1=Piróth |first2=Jenö |last2=Sólyom |publisher=Springer |page=227 |date=2007 |ISBN=9783540726005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In zinc there are only 6 nearest neighbours at 266&amp;nbsp;pm in the same close packed plane with six other, next-nearest neighbours, equidistant, three in each of the close packed planes above and below at 291&amp;nbsp;pm. It is considered to be reasonable to describe the coordination number as 12 rather than 6.&lt;ref name = "Mittemeijer"/&gt; Similar considerations can be applied to the regular body centred cube structure where in addition to the 8 nearest neighbors there 6 more, approximately 15% more distant,&lt;ref name = "Wells"/&gt; and in this case the coordination number is often considered to be 14.

[[File:Strukturformel Nickelarsenid.png|left|thumb|100px|NiAs structure]]
Many chemical compounds have distorted structures. [[Nickel arsenide]], NiAs has a structure where nickel and arsenic atoms are 6-coordinate. Unlike sodium chloride where the chloride ions are cubic close packed, the arsenic anions are hexagonal close packed. The nickel ions are 6-coordinate with a distorted octahedral coordination polyhedron where columns of octahedra share opposite faces. The arsenic ions are not octahedrally coordinated but have a trigonal prismatic coordination polyhedron. A consequence of this arrangement is that the nickel atoms are rather close to each other. Other compounds that share this structure, or a closely related one are some transition metal sulfides such as [[Iron(II) sulfide|FeS]] and [[Cobalt(II) sulfide|CoS]], as well as some intermetallics. In [[cobalt(II) telluride]], CoTe, the six tellurium and two cobalt atoms are all equidistant from the central Co atom.&lt;ref name = "Wells"/&gt;[[File:Haematite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png|right|thumb|100px|Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; structure]]
Two other examples of commonly-encountered chemicals are [[iron(III) oxide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[titanium dioxide|TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]. Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has a crystal structure that can be described as having a near close packed array of oxygen atoms with iron atoms filling two thirds of the octahedral holes. However each iron atom has 3 nearest neighbors and 3 others a little further away. The structure is quite complex, the oxygen atoms are coordinated to four iron atoms and the iron atoms in turn share vertices, edges and faces of the distorted octahedra.&lt;ref name = "Wells"/&gt; TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has the [[rutile]] structure. The titanium atoms 6-coordinate, 2 atoms at 198.3&amp;nbsp;pm and 4 at 194.6&amp;nbsp;pm, in a slightly distorted octahedron. The octahedra around the titanium atoms share edges and vertices to form a 3-D network. The oxide ions are 3-coordinate in a [[trigonal planar]] configuration.&lt;ref name="Diebold2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diebold|first1=Ulrike|title=The surface science of titanium dioxide|journal=Surface Science Reports|volume=48|issue=5–8|year=2003|pages=53–229|issn=0167-5729|doi=10.1016/S0167-5729(02)00100-0|bibcode=2003SurSR..48...53D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coordination number of systems with disorder cannot be precisely defined.

The '''first coordination number''' can be defined using the [[radial distribution function]] ''g''(''r''):&lt;ref&gt;Yoshio Waseda, ''The Structure of Non-crystalline Materials – Liquids and Amorphous Solids'', McGraw-Hill, New York, 1980, pp. 48–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=X-ray diffraction study of liquid sulfur|first1= K.

:&lt;math&gt;n_1 = 4 \pi \int_{r_0}^{r_1} r^2 g(r) \rho \, dr, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the rightmost position starting from ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 whereon ''g''(''r'') is approximately zero, ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the first minimum. Therefore, it is the area under the first peak of ''g''(''r'').

The '''second coordination number''' is defined similarly:
:&lt;math&gt;n_2 = 4 \pi \int_{r_1}^{r_2} r^2 g(r) \rho \, dr. &lt;/math&gt;

Alternative definitions for the coordination number can be found in literature, but in essence the main idea is the same. One of those definition are as follows: Denoting the position of the first peak as ''r''&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;n'_1 = 8 \pi \int_{r_0}^{r_p} r^2 g(r) \rho \, dr. &lt;/math&gt;

The '''first coordination shell''' is the [[spherical shell]] with radius between ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; around the central particle under investigation.

[[File:4StrokeEngine Ortho 3D Small.gif|thumb|right|225px|[[Four-stroke cycle]] (or Otto cycle) {{ordered list |Intake |Compression |Power |Exhaust}}]]
A '''cylinder''' is the central working part of a [[reciprocating engine]] or [[pump]], the space in which a [[piston]] travels.&lt;ref name =hsw&gt;{{cite web|last=Brain|first=Marshall|title=HowStuffWorks "Basic Engine Parts"|url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/engine2.htm|publisher=HowStuffWorks, Inc|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple cylinders are commonly arranged side by side in a bank, or [[engine block]], which is typically [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] from [[aluminum]] or [[cast iron]] before receiving precision machine work. Cylinders may be '''sleeved''' (''lined'' with a harder [[metal]]) or '''sleeveless''' (with a wear-resistant coating such as [[Nikasil]]). A sleeveless engine may also be referred to as a "parent-bore engine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = TRUCK | date = June 1986 | ref = truck86 | page = 54 | last = Kennett | first = Pat | title = The Cummins Beat | location = London, UK | publisher = FF Publishing Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A cylinder's displacement, or swept [[volume]], can be calculated by multiplying its cross-sectional [[area]] (the [[square (algebra)|square]] of half the [[bore (engine)|bore]] by [[pi]]) by the distance the piston travels within the cylinder (the [[stroke (engine)|stroke]]). The [[engine displacement]] can be calculated by multiplying the swept volume of one cylinder by the number of cylinders.

Presented symbolically,
:&lt;math&gt;\text{(Cylinder Volume)} = \pi \cdot \left(\frac{\text{bore}}{2}\right)^2 \cdot \text{Stroke}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\text{(Engine Displacement)} = \text{(Cylinder Volume)} \cdot \text{(Number of Cylinders)}&lt;/math&gt;

A piston is seated inside each cylinder by several metal [[piston ring]]s &lt;ref name=hsw /&gt;  fitted around its outside surface in machined grooves; typically two for [[compression (physical)|compressional]] sealing and one to seal the [[motor oil|oil]].  The rings make near contact with the cylinder walls (sleeved or sleeveless), riding on a thin layer of lubricating oil; essential to keep the engine from seizing and necessitating a cylinder wall's durable surface. 

During the earliest stage of an engine's life, its initial ''breaking-in'' or ''running-in'' period, small irregularities in the metals are encouraged to gradually form congruent grooves by avoiding extreme operating conditions. Later in its life, after mechanical wear has increased the spacing between the piston and the cylinder (with a consequent decrease in power output) the cylinders may be machined to a slightly larger diameter to receive new sleeves (where applicable) and piston rings, a process sometimes known as ''reboring''.

==Heat engines==
[[Image:Cylinder-NF.png|frame|right|Cylinder with piston in a double acting steam engine]]
{{main|Heat engine}}
{{see also|Cylinder (locomotive)}}

Heat engines, including [[Stirling engine]]s, are sealed [[machine]]s using pistons within cylinders to transfer [[energy]] from a heat source to a colder reservoir, often using steam or another [[gas]] as the working [[chemical substance|substance]]. (See [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot cycle]].) The first illustration depicts a longitudinal section of a cylinder in a [[steam engine]]. The sliding part at the bottom is the piston, and the upper sliding part is a distribution valve (in this case of the [[D slide valve]] type) that directs [[steam]] alternately into either end of the cylinder. [[Refrigerator]] and [[air conditioning|air conditioner]] compressors are heat engines driven in reverse cycle as  pumps.

==Internal combustion engines==

[[File:Cylinder 2 (PSF).png|thumb|Illustration of an engine cylinder with a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] view of the piston, connecting rod, valves and spark plug.]]

{{main|Internal combustion engine}}

Internal combustion engines operate on the inherent volume change accompanying [[combustion|oxidation]] of [[gasoline]] (petrol), [[diesel fuel]] (or some other [[hydrocarbon]]) or [[ethanol]], an expansion which is greatly enhanced by the [[heat]] produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internal Combustion Engine|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3418501239.html|work=The Gale Encyclopedia of Science|publisher=Gale Group via [[HighBeam Research]]|accessdate=3 May 2012}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are not classical heat engines since they expel the working substance, which is also the combustion product, into the surroundings.

The [[Reciprocating engine|reciprocating]] motion of the pistons is translated into [[crankshaft]] rotation via [[connecting rod]]s. As a piston moves back and forth, a connecting rod changes its angle; its distal end has a rotating link to the crankshaft. A typical four-cylinder automobile [[engine block|engine]] has a single row of [[watercooling|water-cooled]] cylinders. [[V engine]]s ([[V6]] or [[V8 engine|V8]]) use two [[angle]]d [[cylinder bank]]s. The "V" configuration is utilized to create a more compact configuration relative to the number of cylinders. Many other [[engine configuration]]s exist.

For example, there are also [[rotation|rotary]] [[turbine]]s. The [[Felix Wankel|Wankel]] engine is a rotary adaptation of the cylinder-piston concept which has been used by [[Mazda]] and [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] in [[automobile]]s. Rotary engines are relatively quiet because they lack the clatter of reciprocating [[motion (physics)|motion]].

[[Air-cooled_engine|Air-cooled engines]] generally use individual cases for the cylinders to facilitate cooling. [[Straight engine|Inline]] [[motorcycle|motorcycle engines]] are an exception, having two-, three-, four-, or even six-cylinder air-cooled units in a common block.  Water-cooled engines with only a few cylinders may also use individual cylinder cases, though this makes the cooling system more complex. The [[Ducati]] motorcycle company, which for years used air-cooled motors with individual cylinder cases, retained the basic design of their [[V-twin]] engine while adapting it to water-cooling.

In some engines, especially French designs, the cylinders have "wet liners". They are formed separately from the main casting so that liquid coolant is free to flow around their outsides.  Wet-lined cylinders have better cooling and a more even temperature distribution, but this design makes the engine as a whole somewhat less rigid.

During use, the cylinder is subject to wear from the rubbing action of the [[piston ring]]s and [[piston]] skirt.  This is minimized by the thin oil film which coats the cylinder walls and also by a layer of [[glaze (metallurgy)|glaze]] which naturally forms as the engine is run-in, but eventually the cylinder becomes worn and slightly oval in shape, usually necessitating a rebore to an oversize diameter and the fitting of new, oversize pistons.  The cylinder does not wear above the highest point reached by the top compression ring of the piston, which can result in a detectable ridge.  If an engine is only operated at low rpm for its early life (e.g. in a gently driven automobile) then abruptly used in the higher rpm range (e.g. by a new owner), the slight stretching of the connecting rods at high speed can enable the top compression ring to contact the wear ridge, breaking the ring.  For this reason it is important that all engines, once initially run-in, are occasionally "exercised" through their full speed range to develop a tapered wear profile rather than a sharp ridge.

== Cylinder sleeving ==
Cylinder walls can become very worn or damaged from use.  If the engine is not equipped with replaceable sleeves, there is a limit to how far the cylinder walls can be bored or worn before the block must be sleeved or replaced.  In such cases, the use of a sleeve or liner can restore proper clearances to an engine.  Sleeves are made out of iron alloys and are very reliable.  A sleeve is installed by a machinist at a machine shop.  The engine block is mounted on a precision boring machine, where the cylinder is then bored to a size much larger than normal and a new cast-iron sleeve can be inserted with an interference fit.  The sleeves can be pressed into place, or they can be held in by a shrink fit. This is done by boring the cylinder (between 3 and 6 thousandths of an inch) smaller than the sleeve being installed, then heating the engine block and while hot, the cold sleeve can be inserted easily.  When the engine block cools down it shrink fits around the sleeve holding it into place.  Cylinder wall thickness is important to efficient thermal conductivity in the engine.  When choosing sleeves, engines have specifications to how thick the cylinder walls should be to prevent overworking the coolant system.  Each engine's needs are different, dependent on designed work load duty cycle and energy produced. After selecting and installing the sleeve, the cylinder needs to be finish bored and [[honing (metalworking)|honed]] to match the piston.  Care needs to be given to the finish of the cylinder walls to prevent improper ring seating at break in.

== Seizing ==
Failed lubrication can cause the pistons or piston rings to seize to the cylinder walls. Seizing can occur during engine use, via overheating and lack of oil, or during storage via condensation and corrosion.

==Observational evidence==
Large surveys with sensitive, but low resolution radio telescopes like [[Arecibo Observatory|Arecibo]] or the [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes Telescope]] look for [[Hydrogen line|21&amp;nbsp;cm emission]] from atomic hydrogen in galaxies. These surveys are then matched to optical surveys to identify any objects with no optical counterpart, i.e. sources with no stars. 

Another way astronomers search for dark galaxies is to look for hydrogen absorption lines in the spectra of background [[quasar]]s. This technique has revealed many intergalactic clouds of hydrogen, but following up candidate dark galaxies is difficult, since these sources tend to be too far away, and are often optically drowned out by the bright light from the quasar.

==Nature of dark galaxy==

===Origin===
In 2005, astronomers found gas cloud [[VIRGOHI21]] and attempted to determine what it was and why it caused such a gravitational pull on galaxy [[NGC 4254]]. After years of running out of other explanations, some have concluded that VIRGOHI21 is a dark galaxy, due to the massive effect it had on NGC 4254.&lt;ref name="universetoday"&gt;{{cite web|author=Fraser Cain |url=http://www.universetoday.com/1888/no-stars-shine-in-this-dark-galaxy/ |title=No Stars Shine in This Dark Galaxy |publisher=Universetoday.com |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size===
The actual size of dark galaxies is unknown because they cannot be observed with normal telescopes. There have been various estimations, ranging from double the size of the Milky Way&lt;ref name="spacedaily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Arecibo_Survey_Produces_Dark_Galaxy_Candidate.html |title=Arecibo Survey Produces Dark Galaxy Candidate |publisher=Spacedaily.com |date=2006-04-07 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the size of a small [[#HE0450-2958|quasar]].

===Structure===
Dark galaxies are composed of [[dark matter]]. Furthermore, dark galaxies are theoretically composed of hydrogen and [[cosmic dust|dust]].&lt;ref name="universetoday" /&gt;  Some scientists support the idea that dark galaxies may contain stars.&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12100-dark-galaxy-continues-to-puzzle-astronomers.html |title=Dark galaxy' continues to puzzle astronomers |accessdate=2008-02-26 |publisher=[[New Scientist]]|author=[[Stuart Clark (author)|Stuart Clark]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the exact composition of dark galaxies is unknown because there is no conclusive way to spot them so far. However, astronomers estimate that the mass of the gas in these galaxies is approximately 1 billion times that of the Sun.&lt;ref name="FirstDirectDetection"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/10/121030161234.htm |title=First Direct Detection Sheds Light On Dark Galaxies |publisher=Zmescience.com |accessdate=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodology to observe dark bodies===
Dark galaxies contain no visible stars, and are not visible using optical telescopes. The Arecibo Galaxy Environment Survey (AGES) is a current study using the [[Arecibo radio telescope]] to search for dark galaxies, which are predicted to contain detectable amounts of [[Hydrogen line#Uses in radio astronomy|neutral hydrogen]].

===Alternative theories===
Scientists do not have much explanation for some astronomic events, so some use the idea of a dark galaxy to explain these events. Little is known about dark galaxies, and some scientists believe a dark galaxy is actually a newly forming galaxy. One such candidate is in the Virgo cluster. This candidate contains very few stars. Scientists classify this galaxy as a [[Galaxy formation and evolution|newly forming galaxy]], rather than a dark galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsblaze.com/story/20091130170354drex.nb/topstory.html |title=Drexler's Dark Matter Prediction Confirmation Followed His New Book |publisher=Newsblaze.com |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Scientists say that the galaxies we see today only began to create stars after dark galaxies. Based on numerous scientific assertions, dark galaxies played a big role in many of the galaxies astronomers and scientists see today. Martin Haehnel, from Kavli Institute for Cosmology at the University of Cambridge, claims that the precursor to the Milky Way galaxy was actually a much smaller bright galaxy that had merged with dark galaxies nearby to form the Milky Way we currently see. Multiple scientists agree that dark galaxies are building blocks of modern galaxies. Sebastian Cantalupo of the University of California, Santa Cruz, agrees with this theory. He goes on to say, "In our current theory of galaxy formation, we believe that big galaxies form from the merger of smaller galaxies. Dark galaxies bring to big galaxies a lot of gas, which then accelerates star formation in the bigger galaxies." Scientists have specific techniques they use to locate these dark galaxies. These techniques have the capability of teaching us more about other special events that occur in the universe; for instance, the “cosmic web”. This “web” is made of invisible filaments of gas and dark matter believed to permeate the universe, as well as “feeding and building galaxies and galaxy clusters where the filaments intersect.”&lt;ref name="FirstDirectDetection"/&gt;

===HE0450-2958===
{{main|HE0450-2958}}

HE0450-2958 is a [[quasar]] at [[redshift]] z=0.285. [[Hubble Space Telescope]] images showed that the quasar is located at the edge of a large cloud of gas, but no host galaxy was detected for the quasar. The authors of the Hubble study suggested that one possible scenario was that the quasar is located in a dark galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Magain P. | display-authors = etal | year = 2005 | title = Discovery of a bright quasar without a massive host galaxy | bibcode = 2005Natur.437..381M | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 7057| pages = 381–4 | doi=10.1038/nature04013|arxiv = astro-ph/0509433 | pmid=16163349}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, subsequent analysis by other groups found no evidence that the host galaxy is anomalously dark, and demonstrated that a normal host galaxy is probably present,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Merritt | first = David | display-authors = etal | authorlink=David Merritt | year = 2006 | title = The nature of the HE0450-2958 system | bibcode = 2006MNRAS.367.1746M | journal = [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]| volume = 367 | issue = 4| pages = 1746–1750 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2006.10093.x|arxiv = astro-ph/0511315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Minjin |last2=Ho |first2=Luis |last3=Peng |first3=Chien |last4=Im |first4=Myungshin |title=The Host Galaxy of the Quasar HE 0450-2958 |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |date=2007 |volume=658 |issue=1 |pages=107–113 |doi=10.1086/510846 |bibcode=2007ApJ...658..107K|arxiv=astro-ph/0611411 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, so the observations do not support the dark galaxy interpretation.

'''Decanoic acid''', also known as '''capric acid''' ('''C10:0''') or '''decylic acid''', is a saturated [[fatty acid]]. Its formula is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;COOH. [[salt (chemistry)|Salts]] and [[ester]]s of decanoic acid are called '''decanoates''' or '''caprates'''.  The term capric acid is derived from the Latin "''caper / capra''" (goat) because the sweaty, unpleasant smell of the compound is reminiscent of goats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wordinfo.info/unit/371|title=capri-, capr- +|accessdate=2012-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Capric acid occurs naturally in [[coconut oil]] (about 10%) and [[palm kernel oil]] (about 4%), otherwise it is uncommon in typical seed oils.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;David J. Anneken, Sabine Both, Ralf Christoph, Georg Fieg, Udo Steinberner, Alfred Westfechtel "Fatty Acids" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'', 2006, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a10_245.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is found in the [[milk]] of various mammals and to a lesser extent in other animal fats.&lt;ref name="lexicon" /&gt;  It also comprises 1.62% of the fats from the fruit of the [[durian]] species ''[[Durio graveolens]]''.&lt;ref name="Nasaruddin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nasaruddin|first1=Mohd hanif|last2=Noor|first2=Noor Qhairul Izzreen Mohd|last3=Mamat|first3=Hasmadi|title=Komposisi Proksimat dan Komponen Asid Lemak Durian Kuning (Durio graveolens) Sabah|journal=Sains Malaysiana|date=2013|volume=42|issue=9|pages=1283–1288|url=http://www.ukm.my/jsm/pdf_files/SM-PDF-42-9-2013/11%20Mohd%20Hanif.pdf|accessdate=28 November 2017|trans-title=Proximate and Fatty Acid Composition of Sabah Yellow Durian (Durio graveolens)|language=Malay|format=PDF|issn=0126-6039|oclc=857479186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other acids are named after goats: [[Hexanoic acid|caproic]] (a C6:0 fatty acid) and [[caprylic acid|caprylic]] (a C8:0 fatty acid). Along with decanoic acid, these total 15% in goat milk fat.

==Production==
Decanoic acid can be prepared from [[Redox|oxidation]] of primary alcohol [[1-Decanol|decanol]] by using [[chromium trioxide]] (CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) [[oxidizing agent|oxidant]] under acidic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Organic Chemistry 7th edition| publisher = Thompson - Brooks/Cole| author= John McMurry| year=2008}} Page 624&lt;/ref&gt;

Neutralization of decanoic acid or [[saponification]] of its esters, typically [[triglyceride]]s, with [[sodium hydroxide]] will give sodium decanoate.  This salt (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is a component of some types of [[soap]].

==Uses==
Decanoic acid is used in the manufacture of esters for artificial fruit flavors and perfumes. It is also used as an intermediate in chemical syntheses. It is used in organic synthesis and industrially in the manufacture of perfumes, lubricants, greases, rubber, dyes, plastics, food additives and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name=cheml&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.chemicalland21.com/industrialchem/organic/CAPRIC%20ACID.htm|title = CAPRIC ACID|publisher = AroKor Holdings Inc.|website=chemicalland21.com|accessdate = 2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceuticals===
Decanoate ester [[prodrug]]s of various pharmaceuticals are available. Since decanoic acid is a fatty acid, forming a salt or ester with a drug will increase its [[lipophilicity]] and its affinity for [[adipose tissue]]. Since [[Distribution (pharmacology)|distribution]] of a drug from fatty tissue is usually slow, one may develop a long-acting injectable form of a drug (called a [[injection (medicine)#Depot injection|Depot injection]]) by using its decanoate form. Some examples of drugs available as a decanoate ester include [[nandrolone]], [[fluphenazine]], [[bromperidol]], and [[haloperidol]].

==Effects==
Decanoic acid acts as a non-competitive [[AMPA receptor]] antagonist at therapeutically relevant concentrations, in a voltage- and subunit-dependent manner, and this is sufficient to explain its antiseizure effects.&lt;ref name= awv325&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Chang P, Augustin K, Boddum K, Williams S, Sun M, Terschak JA, Hardege JD, Chen PE, Walker MC, Williams RS | title=Seizure control by decanoic acid through direct AMPA receptor inhibition | journal= [[Brain (journal)|Brain]] | volume=139 | issue=Pt 2 | pages=431–443 | year=2016 | url= https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/brain/awv325 | doi= 10.1093/brain/awv325| pmc=4805082 | pmid = 26608744 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This direct inhibition of excitatory neurotransmission by decanoic acid in the brain contributes to the anticonvulsant effect of the MCT [[ketogenic diet]].&lt;ref name=awv325/&gt; Decanoic acid and the AMPA receptor antagonist drug [[perampanel]] act at separate sites on the AMPA receptor, and so it is possible that they have a cooperative effect at the AMPA receptor, suggesting that perampanel and the ketogenic diet could be synergistic.&lt;ref name=awv325/&gt;

Decanoic acid may be responsible for the mitochondrial proliferation associated with the [[ketogenic diet]], and that this may occur via [[Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma|PPARγ receptor]] agonism and its target genes involved in [[mitochondrial biogenesis]].&lt;ref name="pmid24383952"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hughes SD, Kanabus M, Anderson G, Hargreaves IP, Rutherford T, O'Donnell M, Cross JH, Rahman S, Eaton S, Heales SJ | title = The ketogenic diet component decanoic acid increases mitochondrial citrate synthase and complex I activity in neuronal cells | journal = [[Journal of Neurochemistry]] | volume = 129 | issue = 3 | pages = 426–33 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24383952 | doi = 10.1111/jnc.12646 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jnc.12646 | accessdate = 2015-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22039047"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Malapaka RR, Khoo S, Zhang J, Choi JH, Zhou XE, Xu Y, Gong Y, Li J, Yong EL, Chalmers MJ, Chang L, Resau JH, Griffin PR, Chen YE, Xu HE | title=Identification and mechanism of 10-carbon fatty acid as modulating ligand of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors | journal= [[Journal of Biological Chemistry]] | volume=287 | issue=1 | pages=183–195| year=2012 | url=http://www.jbc.org/content/287/1/183.long | doi= 10.1074/jbc.M111.294785 | pmc=3249069 | pmid = 22039047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8271">The '''December 2005 North American ice storm''' was a damaging [[winter storm]] that produced extensive [[freezing rain|ice]] damage in a large portion of the [[Southern United States]] from December 14&amp;ndash;16, 2005, while extensive snowfall was reported across portions of the Canadian provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. The [[ice storm]] led to enormous and widespread power outages, and at least 7 deaths.

==Background==
The storm was triggered by a deep [[low pressure]] system formed over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on 14 December 2005, which began moving northward. At the same time, cold arctic air from northern [[Canada]] penetrated deep into the [[central United States]] and lowered the temperatures at the surface while warm air from the [[Gulf Stream]] remained at the coast. A second [[Alberta clipper]] farther north also added additional energy to the system.

The precipitation remained as rain in the coastal areas, including the large cities from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] to [[Washington, D.C.]]. However, freezing rain was extensive in the inland areas, including around [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], where the temperatures remained just below freezing for extended periods. The freezing rain persisted for many hours, leading to extensive ice damage.

Trees and power lines, along with numerous other lightweight structures, came down in many areas from Georgia northward, and [[highway]]s (including several [[Interstate Highway]]s) were closed and impassable. The heaviest ice accretions were in southwestern [[North Carolina]], where ice over 3/4&amp;nbsp;inch (20&amp;nbsp;mm) thick was reported&lt;ref name="NWS SC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/gsp/localdat/cases/15Dec2005IceStorm/15Dec2005.htm |title=Event Summary |publisher=[[National Weather Service]] |author=Greenville-Spartanburg office |date= |accessdate=2007-04-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010022605/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/gsp/localdat/cases/15Dec2005IceStorm/15Dec2005.htm |archivedate=October 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charlottesville, Virginia]] with 1&amp;nbsp;inch (25,4&amp;nbsp;mm).&lt;ref name="HPC"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the higher elevations, and farther north across the [[Great Lakes]] region and into northern [[New England]], the storm produced heavy snow with amounts varying between 7&amp;nbsp;inches to as high as 26&amp;nbsp;inches (57&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name="HPC"/&gt;

In Canada, 41 centimetres of snow fell in [[Montreal]] in about 12&amp;nbsp;hours, with snowfall rates as high as 30 centimetres in 4&amp;nbsp;hours, and 11 centimetres in a one-hour period during the morning rush hour on December 16. This is the second worst storm on record, after a [[Eastern Canadian Blizzard of March 1971|storm]] on March 4, 1971 dumped 47 centimetres and the worst fall snowstorm to hit the area since records were kept.&lt;ref name="MSC2"&gt;{{cite web

In addition, at least seven deaths were blamed on the weather, one of them directly related to weather conditions. One of the deaths was as a result of a tree that fell into a home and crashed into a man in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]], one as a result of a faulty [[Electrical generator|generator]] in a house without power, and the other five as a result of [[traffic accident]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051216/ap_on_re_us/ice_storm ]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/mld/myrtlebeachonline/news/local/13432268.htm |title=Myrtle Beach Visitors' Guide |publisher=MyrtleBeachOnline.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-09 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Power outage===
The ice storm left more than a million&amp;nbsp;people without power in and near the Appalachians, including 630,000 customers in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 358,000 in [[South Carolina]], 328,000 in North Carolina and 13,000 in [[Virginia]]. It took over a week to restore power. Several emergency shelters also were opened.&lt;ref name="wlos"&gt;

}}'''Edward Armand Guggenheim''' [[Royal Society|FRS]]&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; (11 August 1901 in Manchester – 9 August 1970) was an English [[physical chemist]], noted for his contributions to [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | title = Guggenheim, Edward Armand (1901–1970)| doi = 10.1093/ref:odnb/33598 | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/specialcollections/coll/pauling/calendar/1937/02/index.html Letter exchanged with Linus Pauling] - Feb, 24, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Guggenheim was born in [[Manchester]] 11 August 1901, the son of Armand Guggenheim and Marguerite Bertha Simon. His father was [[Swiss people|Swiss]], a [[Naturalization|naturalised]] [[British citizenship|British citizen]]. Guggenheim married Simone Ganzin (died 1954), in 1934 and Ruth Helen Aitkin, born Clarke, widow, in 1955. They had no children. He died in [[Reading, Berkshire]] 9 August 1970.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

==Education==
Guggenheim was educated at [[Terra Nova School]], [[Southport]], [[Charterhouse School]] and [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]] where he obtained firsts in both the [[Mathematical Tripos|mathematics part 1]] and [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|chemistry part 2 triposes]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; Unable to gain a fellowship at the college, he went to [[Denmark]] where he studied under [[Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted|J. N. Brønsted]] at the [[University of Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

==Career==
Returning to England, he found a place at [[University College, London|University College]], London where he wrote his first book, ''Modern Thermodynamics by the Methods of [[Willard Gibbs]]'' (1933), which "established his reputation and revolutionized the teaching of the subject".&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; He was also a visiting professor of chemistry at [[Stanford University]], and later became a reader in the [[chemical engineering]] department at [[Imperial College London]]. During [[World War II]] he worked on defence matters for the [[Royal Navy|navy]]. In 1946 he was appointed professor of chemistry and head of department at [[Reading University]], where he stayed until his retirement in 1966.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

==Publications==
Guggenheim produced eleven books and more than 100 papers.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; His first book,''Modern Thermodynamics by the Methods of Willard Gibbs'' (1933), was a 206-page, detailed study, with text, figures, index, and preface by F. G. Donnan, showing how the analytical thermodynamic methods developed by [[Willard Gibbs]] leads in a straightforward manner to relations such as phases, constants, solution, systems, and laws, that are unambiguous and exact. This book, together with [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]]'s 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'', are said to be responsible for the inception of the modern science of [[chemical thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ott | first = Bevan J.  |author2=Boerio-Goates, Juliana | title = Chemical Thermodynamics – Principles and Applications | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-12-530990-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other books included ''Statistical Thermodynamics'' with [[Ralph Fowler]] (1939),&lt;ref name="fowler"&gt;{{MacTutor Biography|id=Fowler|title=Ralph Fowler}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Thermodynamics – an Advanced Treatment for Chemists and Physicists'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Guggenheim | first = E. A.  | title = Thermodynamics – an Advanced Treatment for Chemists and Physicists | publisher = North-Holland Publishing Company | year = 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to this book, he states that no thermodynamics book written before 1929 even attempts an account of any of the following matters:

# The modern definition of heat given by [[Max Born]] in 1921.
# The quantal theory of the [[entropy]] of gases and its experimental verification.
# [[Peter Debye]]'s formulae for the [[activity coefficient]]s of [[electrolytes]].
# The use of [[electrochemical potential]]s of ions
# The application of thermodynamics to dielectrics and to paramagnetic substances.

==Honours and awards==
Guggenheim was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; His nomination reads
{{centred pull quote|Distinguished for his important contributions to thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and for the applications of these branches of physical science in many fields, e.g. electrolytic solutions, electro-chemical potentials, magnetic and electrostatic energy, surface and interfacial phenomena, stellar interiors, chemical equilibria and reaction kinetics, co-operative assemblies, theory of super-lattices, etc.
Author of "Modern Thermodynamics by the Methods of Willard Gibbs" (1933). Joint author with Professor R. H. Fowler of "Statistical Thermodynamics" (1939).&lt;ref name="royal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqDb=Catalog&amp;dsqCmd=show.tcl&amp;dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1946%2F11%27)|title = Library and Archive Catalogue|publisher=The Royal Society|accessdate=27 November 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1972, the '''E. A. Guggenheim Memorial Fund''' was established by friends and colleagues. The income from the fund is used to (a) award an annual prize and (b) to provide a biennial or triennial memorial lecture on some topic of chemistry or physics appropriate to the interests of Guggenheim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/calendar/2006-7/pdfs/k%20University%20societies.pdf E. A. Guggenheim Memorial Fund] – established in 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guggenheim Medal''' was introduced in 2014 by the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]] for significant contributions to research in thermodynamics and / or complex fluids. The first recipient (in 2015) was Professor George Jackson of [[Imperial College London]].&lt;ref name=IChemE&gt;[http://www.icheme.org/icheme_home/media_centre/news/2015/george-jackson-receives-first-guggenheim-medal www.icheme.org] George Jackson receives first Guggenheim medal&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TCE&gt;''The Chemical Engineer'', March 2015 p 52 "Winners of 2014 medals announced"&lt;/ref&gt;

Red - choline and phosphate group; Black - glycerol; Green - unsaturated fatty acid; Blue - saturated fatty acid]]

'''Egg lecithin''' is a type of [[lecithin]], a group of [[chemical compound|compounds]] primarily containing [[phospholipid]]s, that is derived from eggs.

==Markets==

The key companies operating in the global egg lecithin market include Lipoid GmbH, Cargill Incorporated, Kewpie Corporation and [[VAV.in|VAV Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd]].&lt;ref&gt;Global Lecithin Market 2016-2020 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160209006410/en/Global-Lecithin-Market-2016-2020---Source-Soy] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
Egg lecithin was first isolated in 1846 by the French chemist and pharmacist [[Theodore Nicolas Gobley|Theodore Gobley]].&lt;ref&gt;Gobley (1846) "Recherches chimiques sur le jaune d'œuf" (Chemical researches on egg yolk), ''Journal de Pharmacie et de Chemie'', series 3, vol. 9, pages 81-91; on [https://books.google.com/books?id=DC04AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 84])&lt;/ref&gt; Gobley originally isolated lecithin from [[egg yolk]]&amp;mdash;λέκιθος (''lekithos'') is 'egg yolk' in [[ancient Greek]]&amp;mdash;and established the complete chemical formula of phosphatidylcholine in 1874.

==Biology==
[[Phosphatidylcholine]] a major component of egg lecithin, occurs in all cellular organisms, being one of the important components of the phospholipid portion of the [[cell membrane]]. Other components include [[phosphatidylethanolamine]] and [[sphingomyelin]].

==Production==
Egg lecithin is usually extracted chemically using [[ethanol]], [[acetone]], [[petroleum ether]] but not [[benzene]] or [[hexane]] due to restrictions on residual solvents by the pharmaceutical regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500002674.pdf ICH Topic Q3C (R4) Impurities: Guideline for Residual Solvents]&lt;/ref&gt; It is an emulsifier, especially for [[parenteral]] use since it does not need to be metabolized. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either [[liposome]]s, bilayer sheets, [[micelle]]s, or [[Lamella (materials)|lamellar]] structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of [[surfactant]] that is usually classified as [[amphipathic]].

Commercial egg lecithin, specified in the [[United States Pharmacopeia|United States National Formulatory]] (USP/NF) as used by pharmaceutical companies, is a highly purified mixture of [[phospholipid]]s, devoid of [[triglyceride]]s, [[cholesterol]], or [[protein]]s.

==Properties and applications==
Egg lecithin has [[emulsion|emulsification]] and [[lubricant]] properties, and is a [[surfactant]]. It can be totally integrated into the cell membrane in humans, so does not need to be metabolized and is well tolerated by humans and non[[toxic]] when ingested; some synthetic [[emulsifier]]s can only be excreted via the [[kidney]]s.

Applications include:
* In the [[pharmaceutical industry]], it acts as a wetting, stabilizing agent and a choline enrichment carrier, helps in emulsifications and encapsulation, and is a good dispersing agent. It can be used in manufacture of intravenous fat infusions and for therapeutic use. Examples of intravenous applications are [[propofol]] for [[anesthesia]], NSAID drugs,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12086734 In-vitro release of diclofenac diethylammonium from lipid-based formulations, Int J Pharm. 2002 Jul 8;241(1):185-90 Parsaee et.al.]&lt;/ref&gt; etc. 
* In the cosmetics industry, it is used to produce stable O/W emulsions for cosmetic compositions or pharmaceutical excipients&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4481185.pdf United States Patent No. 4481185, Grollier, et.al.]&lt;/ref&gt;
Egg lecithin is  approved by the [[United States]] [[Food and Drug Administration]] with the status "[[generally recognized as safe]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/fcn/gras_notices/GRN000411.pdf Egg-derived phospholipids as an ingredient in  term and preterm infant formula, Food and Drug Administration, USA]&lt;/ref&gt; and listed in the compendium.

=== Compatibility with special diets ===
[[Egg (food)|Egg]]-derived lecithin is not usually a concern for those allergic to eggs since commercially available food grade egg lecithin is devoid of allergy causing egg proteins. Egg lecithin is not a concern for those on low-[[cholesterol]] diets, because the lecithin found in eggs markedly inhibits the absorption of the cholesterol contained in eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Unisci.com, [http://www.unisci.com/stories/20014/1029013.htm Why Eggs Don't Contribute Much Cholesterol To Diet.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==

Consider a [[Spin (physics)|spin]]-less ideal [[Fermi gas]] of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; particles. According to [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]], the mean occupation number of a state with energy &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; is given by&lt;ref name='Reif1965dist341'&gt;{{harv|Reif|1965|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\langle n_i\rangle =\frac{1}{e^{(\epsilon_i-\mu)/k_{\rm B}T}+1},&lt;/math&gt;

where,

*&lt;math&gt;\left\langle n_i\right\rangle&lt;/math&gt; is the mean occupation number of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; state
*&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i&lt;/math&gt; is the kinetic energy of the &lt;math&gt;i^{th}&lt;/math&gt; state
*&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[chemical potential]] (at zero temperature, this is the maximum kinetic energy the particle can have, i.e. [[Fermi energy]] &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;)
*&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the [[absolute temperature]]
*&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm B}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Boltzmann constant]]

Suppose we consider the limit &lt;math&gt;T\to 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have,

&lt;math&gt;\left\langle n_i\right\rangle\approx\begin{cases}1 &amp; (\epsilon_i&lt;\mu) \\ 0 &amp; (\epsilon_i&gt;\mu)\end{cases}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[Pauli exclusion principle]], no two fermions can be in the same state. Therefore, in the state of lowest energy, the particles fill up all energy levels below the Fermi energy &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;, which is equivalent to saying that &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; is the energy level below which there are exactly &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; states''.''

In [[momentum space]], these particles fill up a sphere of radius &lt;math&gt;p_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt;, the surface of which is called the Fermi surface.&lt;ref&gt;K. Huang, ''Statistical Mechanics'' (2000), p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The linear response of a metal to an electric, magnetic or thermal gradient is determined by the shape of the Fermi surface, because currents are due to changes in the occupancy of states near the Fermi energy. In [[Reciprocal lattice|reciprocal space]], the Fermi surface of an ideal Fermi gas is a sphere of radius

&lt;math&gt;k_{\rm F} = \frac{p_{\rm F}}{\hbar}= \frac{\sqrt{2 m E_{\rm F}}} {\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;,

determined by the valence electron concentration where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[reduced Planck's constant]]. A material whose Fermi level falls in a gap between bands is an [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] or semiconductor depending on the size of the [[bandgap]]. When a material's Fermi level falls in a bandgap, there is no Fermi surface.

[[Image:graphiteFS.png|thumb|Figure 2. A view of the [[graphite]] Fermi surface at the corner H points of the
[[Brillouin zone]] showing the trigonal symmetry of the electron and
hole pockets.]]

Materials with complex crystal structures can have quite intricate Fermi surfaces. The figure 2 illustrates the [[anisotropic]] Fermi surface of graphite, which has both electron and hole pockets in its Fermi surface due to multiple bands crossing the Fermi energy along the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}_z&lt;/math&gt; direction. Often in a metal the Fermi surface radius &lt;math&gt;k_{\rm F}&lt;/math&gt; is larger than the size of the first [[Brillouin zone]] which results in a portion of the Fermi surface lying in the second (or higher) zones. As with the band structure itself, the Fermi surface can be displayed in an extended-zone scheme where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; is allowed to have arbitrarily large values or a reduced-zone scheme where wavevectors are shown [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\frac{2 \pi} {a}&lt;/math&gt; (in the 1-dimensional case) where a is the [[lattice constant]]. In the three-dimensional case the reduced zone scheme means that from any wavevector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; there is an appropriate number of reciprocal lattice vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt; subtracted that the new &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; now is closer to the origin in &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;-space than to any &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}&lt;/math&gt;. Solids with a large density of states at the Fermi level become unstable at low temperatures and tend to form [[ground state]]s where the condensation energy comes from opening a gap at the Fermi surface. Examples of such ground states are [[superconductor]]s, [[ferromagnet]]s, [[Jahn–Teller effect|Jahn–Teller distortions]] and [[spin density wave]]s.

The state occupancy of [[fermion]]s like electrons is governed by [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] so at finite temperatures the Fermi surface is accordingly broadened. In principle all fermion energy level populations are bound by a Fermi surface although the term is not generally used outside of condensed-matter physics.

==Experimental determination==
Electronic Fermi surfaces have been measured through observation of the oscillation of transport properties in magnetic fields &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, for example the [[de Haas–van Alphen effect]] (dHvA) and the [[Shubnikov–de Haas effect]] (SdH). The former is an oscillation in [[magnetic susceptibility]] and the latter in [[resistivity]]. The oscillations are periodic versus &lt;math&gt;1/H&lt;/math&gt; and occur because of the quantization of energy levels in the plane perpendicular to a magnetic field, a phenomenon first predicted by [[Lev Landau]]. The new states are called Landau levels and are separated by an energy &lt;math&gt;\hbar \omega_{\rm c}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\omega_{\rm c} = eH/m^*c&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[electron cyclotron resonance|cyclotron frequency]], &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the electronic charge, &lt;math&gt;m^*&lt;/math&gt; is the electron [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]]. In a famous result, [[Lars Onsager]] proved that the period of oscillation &lt;math&gt;\Delta H&lt;/math&gt; is related to the cross-section of the Fermi surface (typically given in [[Ångström|Å&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;]]) perpendicular to the magnetic field direction &lt;math&gt;A_{\perp}&lt;/math&gt; by the equation&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;math&gt;A_{\perp} = \frac{2 \pi e \Delta H}{\hbar c}&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Thus the determination of the periods of oscillation for various applied field directions allows mapping of the Fermi surface.Observation of the dHvA and SdH oscillations requires magnetic fields large enough that the circumference of the cyclotron orbit is smaller than a [[mean free path]]. Therefore, dHvA and SdH experiments are usually performed at high-field facilities like the High Field Magnet Laboratory in Netherlands, Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory in France, the Tsukuba Magnet Laboratory in Japan or the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in the United States.

[[Image:Fermi surface of BSCCO exp.jpg|thumb| Figure 3. [[Fermi surface of BSCCO]] measured by [[ARPES]]. The experimental data shown as an intensity plot in yellow-red-black scale. Green dashed rectangle represents the [[Brillouin zone]] of the CuO2 plane of [[BSCCO]].]]

The most direct experimental technique to resolve the electronic structure of crystals in the momentum-energy space (see [[reciprocal lattice]]), and, consequently, the Fermi surface, is the [[angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy]] (ARPES). An example of the [[Fermi surface of superconducting cuprates]] measured by ARPES is shown in the figure 3.

With [[positron annihilation]] it is also possible to determine the Fermi surface as the annihilation process conserves the momentum of the initial particle. Since a positron in a solid will thermalize prior to annihilation, the annihilation radiation carries the information about the electron momentum. The corresponding experimental technique is called [[Angular Correlation of Electron Positron Annihilation Radiation|angular correlation of electron positron annihilation radiation]] (ACAR) as it measures the angular deviation from {{val|180|u=degree}} of both annihilation quanta. In this way it is possible to probe the electron momentum density of a solid and determine the Fermi surface. Furthermore, using [[Spin polarization|spin polarized]] positrons, the momentum distribution for the two [[Spin (physics)|spin]] states in magnetized materials can be obtained. ACAR has many advantages and disadvantages compared to other experimental techniques: It does not rely on [[Ultra-high vacuum|UHV]] conditions, cryogenic temperatures, high magnetic fields or fully ordered alloys. However, ACAR needs samples with a low vacancy concentration as they act as effective traps for positrons. In this way, the first determination of a ''smeared Fermi surface'' in a 30% alloy was obtained in 1978.

[[File:Coudée-turin detail.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail of a [[cubit]] rod in the [[Museo Egizio]] of [[Turin]]]]
The earliest recorded systems of weights and measures originate in the 3rd or 4th millennium BC. Even the very earliest civilizations needed measurement for purposes of agriculture, construction, and trade. Early standard units might only have applied to a single community or small region, with every area developing its own standards for lengths, areas, volumes and masses. Often such systems were closely tied to one field of use, so that volume measures used, for example, for dry grains were unrelated to those for liquids, with neither bearing any particular relationship to units of length used for measuring cloth or land. With development of manufacturing technologies, and the growing importance of trade between communities and ultimately across the Earth, standardized weights and measures became critical. Starting in the 18th century, modernized, simplified and uniform systems of weights and measures were developed, with the fundamental units defined by ever more precise methods in the science of [[metrology]]. The discovery and application of [[electricity]] was one factor motivating the development of standardized internationally applicable units. 

==Sources of information==

[[Weights and measures]] have taken a great variety of forms over the course of history, from simple informal expectations in barter transactions to elaborate state and supranational systems that integrate measures of many different kinds.  Weights and measures from the oldest societies can often be inferred at least in part from [[archaeology|archaeological specimens]], often preserved in museums.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The comparison of the dimensions of buildings with the descriptions of contemporary writers is another source of information. An interesting example of this is the comparison of the dimensions of the Greek [[Parthenon]] with the description given by [[Plutarch]] from which a fairly accurate idea of the size of the [[Ancient Greek units of measurement#Length|Attic foot]] is obtained. Because of the comparative volume of artifacts and documentation, we know much more about the state-sanctioned measures of large, advanced societies than we do about those of smaller societies or about the informal measures that often coexisted with official ones throughout history. In some cases, we have only plausible theories and we must sometimes select the interpretation to be given to the evidence.

By studying the evidence given by all available sources, and by correlating the relevant facts, we obtain some idea of the origin and development of the units. We find that they have changed more or less gradually with the passing of time in a complex manner because of a great variety of modifying influences.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} It is possible to group official measurement systems for large societies into historical systems that are relatively stable over time, including: the Babylonian system, the Egyptian system, the Phileterian system of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] age, the Olympic system of Greece, the Roman system, the [[English unit|British system]], and the [[metric system]].

==Earliest known systems==
The earliest known uniform systems of weights and measures seem all to have been created at some time in the [[4th millennium BC|4th]] and [[3rd millennium BC|3rd millennia BC]] among the ancient peoples of [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Indus Valley]], and perhaps also [[Elam]] (in [[Iran]]) as well.

Early [[Babylonia]]n and [[History of Egypt|Egyptian]] records and the [[Hebrew Bible]] indicate that length was first measured with the forearm, hand, or finger and that time was measured by the periods of the sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies. When it was necessary to compare the capacities of containers such as [[gourd]]s or [[clay]] or metal vessels, they were filled with plant seeds which were then counted to measure the [[volume]]s. When means for weighing were invented, seeds and stones served as standards. For instance, the [[Carat (unit)|carat]], still used as a unit for gems, was derived from the [[carob]] seed.

==History of units==
{{main|Historical metrology}}

=== Units of length ===
The Egyptian [[cubit]], the [[Indus Valley]] units of length referred to above and the Mesopotamian cubit were used in the 3rd millennium BC and are the earliest known units used by ancient peoples to measure length. The units of length used in ancient India included the dhanus, or dhanush (bow), the krosa (cry, or cow-call) and the [[yojana]] (stage).

The common cubit was the length of the forearm from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. It was divided into the span of the hand or the length between the tip of little finger to the tip of the thumb (one-half cubit), the palm or width of the hand (one sixth), and the digit or width of the middle finger (one twenty-fourth).  The Royal Cubit, which was a standard cubit enhanced by an extra palm—thus 7 palms or 28 digits long—was used in constructing buildings and monuments and in surveying in ancient Egypt.  The [[inch]], [[foot (length)|foot]], and [[yard]] evolved from these units through a complicated transformation not yet fully understood. Some believe they evolved from cubic measures; others believe they were simple proportions or multiples of the cubit. In whichever case, the Greeks and Romans inherited the foot from the Egyptians. The Roman foot (~296&amp;nbsp;mm) was divided into both 12 ''unciae'' (inches) (~24.7&amp;nbsp;mm) and 16 digits (~18.5&amp;nbsp;mm). The Romans also introduced the ''mille passus'' (1000 paces) or double steps, the pace being equal to five Roman feet (~1480&amp;nbsp;mm). The Roman [[mile]] of 5000 feet (1480 m) was introduced into England during the occupation. [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] (reigned from 1558 to 1603) changed, by statute, the mile to 5280 feet (~1609 m) or 8 furlongs, a [[furlong]] being 40 [[rod (unit)]]s (~201 m) of 5.5 yards (~5.03 m) each.

The introduction of the yard (0.9144 m) as a unit of length came later, but its origin is not definitely known. Some believe the origin was the double cubit, others believe that it originated from cubic measure. Whatever its origin, the early yard was divided by the binary method into 2, 4, 8, and 16 parts called the half-yard, span, finger, and nail. The association of the yard with the "gird" or circumference of a person's waist or with the distance from the tip of the nose to the end of the thumb of [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (reigned 1100–1135) are probably standardizing actions, since several yards were in use in Britain.
There were also Rods, Poles and Perches for measurements of length. The following table lists the equivalents.

=== Units of mass ===
The [[Grain (mass)|grain]] was the earliest [[Mass#Units of mass|unit of mass]] and is the smallest unit in the [[Apothecarie' system of mass|apothecary]], [[avoirdupois]], Tower, and [[Troy weight|troy]] systems. The early unit was a grain of wheat or barleycorn used to weigh the precious metals silver and gold. Larger units preserved in stone standards were developed that were used as both units of mass and of monetary currency. The [[Pound (mass)|pound]] was derived from the mina used by ancient civilizations.  A smaller unit was the shekel, and a larger unit was the [[talent (measurement)|talent]]. The magnitude of these units varied from place to place. The Babylonians and Sumerians had a system in which there were 60 shekels in a mina and 60 minas in a talent. The Roman talent consisted of 100 libra (pound) which were smaller in magnitude than the mina. The troy pound (~373.2 g) used in England and the United States for monetary purposes, like the Roman pound, was divided into 12 ounces, but the Roman uncia (ounce) was smaller. The carat is a unit for measuring gemstones that had its origin in the carob seed, which later was standardized at 1/144 ounce and then 0.2&amp;nbsp;gram. 

Goods of commerce were originally traded by number or volume.  When weighing of goods began, units of mass based on a volume of grain or water were developed. The diverse magnitudes of units having the same name, which still appear today in our dry and liquid measures, could have arisen from the various commodities traded.  The larger avoirdupois pound for goods of commerce might have been based on volume of water which has a higher [[bulk density]] than grain.

The stone, quarter, hundredweight, and ton were larger units of mass used in Britain.  Today only the stone continues in customary use for measuring personal body weight.  The present stone is 14 pounds (~6.35&amp;nbsp;kg), but an earlier unit appears to have been 16 pounds (~7.25&amp;nbsp;kg).  The other units were multiples of 2, 8, and 160 times the stone, or 28, 112, and 2240 pounds (~12.7&amp;nbsp;kg, 50.8&amp;nbsp;kg, 1016&amp;nbsp;kg), respectively.  The hundredweight was approximately equal to two talents.  The ton of 2240 pounds is called the "long ton".  The "short ton" is equal to 2000 pounds (~907&amp;nbsp;kg).  A tonne (t) is equal to 1000&amp;nbsp;kg.

=== Units of time and angle ===
The division of the circle into 360 degrees and the day into hours, minutes, and seconds can be traced to the Babylonians who had [[sexagesimal]] system of numbers.  The 360 degrees may have been related to a [[360-day calendar|year of 360 days]].  Many other [[systems of measurement]] divided the day differently -- [[Hour#Counting hours|counting hours]], [[decimal time]], etc. Other [[calendar]]s divided the year differently.

== Forerunners of the metric system ==
Decimal numbers are an essential part of the metric system, with only one base unit and multiples created on the decimal base, the figures remain the same. This simplifies calculations. Although the [[India|Indians]] used decimal numbers for mathematical computations, it was [[Simon Stevin]] who in 1585 first advocated the use of decimal numbers for everyday purposes in his booklet ''De Thiende'' (old Dutch for 'the tenth').  He also declared that it would only be a matter of time before decimal numbers were used for currencies and measurements. [[Simon Stevin#Decimal fractions|His notation]] for decimal fractions was clumsy, but this was overcome with the introduction of the decimal point, generally attributed to [[Bartholomaeus Pitiscus]] who used this notation in his trigonometrical tables (1595).&lt;ref name="Stevin_MacTutor2"&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Stevin|date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|''Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language'']], published in 1668, [[John Wilkins]] proposed a system of measurement that was very similar in concept to today's metric system.  He proposed retaining the second as the basic unit of time and proposed that the length of a pendulum which crossed the zero position once a second (i.e. had a period of two seconds) should be the base unit of length.  This length, for which he proposed the name "standard", would have been 994&amp;nbsp;mm.  His base unit of mass, which he proposed calling a "hundred", would have been the mass of a cubic standard of distilled rainwater.  The names that he proposed for decimal multiples and subunits of his base units of measure were the names of units of measure that were in use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction (33&amp;nbsp;MB):{{cite book|url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationLong.pdf|title=An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language|author=[[John Wilkins]]|publisher=The Royal Society|year=1668|pages=190–194|chapter=VII|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metricationmatters.com/docs/WilkinsTranslationShort.pdf|title=An ESSAY Towards a REAL CHARACTER, And a PHILOSOPHICAL LANGUAGE|publisher=Metricationmatters.com|format=PDF|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1670, [[Gabriel Mouton]] published a proposal that was in essence similar to Wilkins' proposal, except that his base unit of length would have been 1/1000 of a [[minute of arc]] (about 1.852&amp;nbsp;m) of geographical latitude.  He proposed calling this unit the virga.  Rather than using different names for each unit of length, he proposed a series of names that had prefixes, rather like the prefixes found in SI.&lt;ref name="Mouton2"&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Mouton|date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, [[Thomas Jefferson]] submitted a [[Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States|report]] to the [[United States Congress]] in which he proposed the adoption of a decimal system of coinage and of weights and measures.  He proposed calling his base unit of length a "foot" which he suggested should be either {{frac|3|10}} or {{frac|1|3}} of the length of a pendulum that had a period of one second – that is {{frac|3|10}} or {{frac|1|3}} of the "standard" proposed by Wilkins over a century previously.  This would have equated to 11.755 English inches (29.8&amp;nbsp;cm) or 13.06 English inches (33.1&amp;nbsp;cm). Like Wilkins, the names that he proposed for multiples and subunits of his base units of measure were the names of units of measure that were in use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/jeffplan.asp|title=Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States Communicated to the House of Representatives, July 13, 1790|last=Jefferson|first=Thomas|date=4 July 1790|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great interest in [[geodesy]] during this era, and the measurement system ideas that developed, influenced how the continental US was [[Surveying|surveyed]] and parceled. The story of how Jefferson's full vision for the new measurement system came close to displacing the [[Chain (unit)|Gunter chain]] and the traditional [[acre]], but ended up not doing so, is explored in [[Andro Linklater]]'s ''Measuring America''.&lt;ref name="Linklater_20022"&gt;{{cite book|title=Measuring America: How an Untamed Wilderness Shaped the United States and Fulfilled the Promise of Democracy|last=Linklater|first=Andro|publisher=Walker &amp; Co|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8027-1396-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Metric conversion ==
{{Main article|Metrication|History of the metric system}}
The [[metric system]] was first described in 1668 and officially adopted by France in 1799.  Over nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it became the dominant system worldwide, although several countries, including the United States and China, continue to use their customary units. Among the numerous customary systems, many have been adapted to become an integer multiple of a related metric unit: The [[Scandinavian mile]] is now defined as 10&amp;nbsp;km, the [[Chinese jin]] is now defined as 0.5&amp;nbsp;kg, and the [[Dutch units of measurement|Dutch ons]] is now defined as 100&amp;nbsp;g. The [[US customary units|American system]] is unusual in that its units have not been adapted in such a manner.

==History==
The Agasote Millboard Company was founded as a division of the Bermuda Trading Company in 1909 by [[Eugenius Harvey Outerbridge]]. Outerbridge brought the process to the United States from England.&lt;ref name=homasote&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homasote.com/about.html |title=Homasote Company |accessdate=2008-12-18 |quote=Homasote Company is the oldest manufacturer of building products made from recycled materials in the U.S., and the only manufacturer of its kind in the Americas.

The first commercial use of the panels were for lining and insides of railroad cars. In 1915, the company won a contract to use the panels as automobile tops. From 1915 to 1925 they supplied board for the tops of [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Buick]], [[Nash Motors]], [[Studebaker]], and [[Dodge]]. They also manufactured a larger panel, sold as "vehisote" for truck panels.&lt;ref name=homasote/&gt; The panels were used for the exterior of [[field hospital]]s and military housing in France during World War I.&lt;ref name=homasote/&gt; By 1925 car manufacturers switched to canvas tops and Agasote lost sales, so the company heavily promoted Homasote for its versatility and insulation properties. The company then changed its name to Homasote after its now largest product.&lt;ref name=homasote/&gt; The company makes a version called "440 SoundBarrier".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcd.com/bpr/bpr_ma_3_2004.html |title=440 SoundBarrier by Homasote: The High-Performance Sheathing Alternative to OSB and Plywood |accessdate=2008-12-18 |quote=One additional advantage that 440 SoundBarrier has over alternatives is the bonus reduction in ambient outside sound coming into a home that's achieved when that home is sheathed with Homasote.  |publisher=DCD }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model railroading==
Homasote is frequently used by [[model railroading]] for the sub-roadbed or roadbed,&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Russ. ''N Scale Primer''. Kalmback Publishing Company, 1974, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; because of its noise-deadening qualities, ease of forming into shapes used as roadbed for tracks, ease of driving nails to hold track sections to the bed, light weight and retention of form under plaster scenery. [[Cork (material)|Cork]], [[plywood]], [[hardboard]], [[drywall]], and [[building insulation materials|foam insulation]] are common alternatives to Homasote.

== Other uses ==
Homasote has also found its way into numerous church basements and fellowship halls as the material used by church [[dartball]] leagues for the backboard of their baseball field shaped dartboards.  It has proven to be a durable material that darts can be thrown into repeatedly without damaging their metal tips.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Homasote has also been used to cover ice rinks in multipurpose arenas for basketball and other events. It keeps ice cold and is durable enough to walk on.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Homasote was also widely used as wall sheeting from the 1940s into the 1970s; however, due to the development of the more fire-resistant gypsum board it has decreased in popularity as a wall sheeting.

Homasote is also commonly found in studio spaces and featured in many art institutions as a wall covering and doubling as a type of cork board. It often receives hundreds of coats of paint over the years due to the strength of the product.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Homasote is also used for blocking knit or crochet pieces. "Homosote is sturdy, and incredibly absorbent. It will wick water away from your garment so it dries more quickly. And it's like a bulletin board -- you can stick pins in it easily."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEwinter02/FEATdiyknitter.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''jumbotron''', sometimes referred to as '''Jumbovision''', is a video display using [[large-screen television technology]]. The original JumboTron was developed by [[Sony]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=iwAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA10 Popular Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=duUCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA20 New York Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and is typically used in [[sports stadium]]s and [[concert venue]]s to show close up shots of an event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QTkL5K3RCM0C&amp;pg=PA119 Tailgate to Heaven: A British NFL Fan Tackles America - Adam Goldstein&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mercer"/&gt; 

==History and development==
The JumboTron was originally manufactured by Sony, and is recognized as one of the largest non-projection video displays ever manufactured. Sony creative director Yasuo Kuroki is credited with the development of the JumboTron.

While the JumboTron and similar large-screen displays are physically large, they were often low in [[display resolution]]. The JumboTron at the now-demolished [[Tampa Stadium]] in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]], measured 30&amp;nbsp;ft (9 m) diagonally with a resolution of only 240×192 pixels, below [[VHS]] resolution. Screen size since then varies depending on the venue. The display introduced in 1985 was 40 meters wide by 25 meters tall.  Newer, LED-based large screens have an order of magnitude greater than the early JumboTron resolution at a fraction of the cost. For example, the much publicized center-hung video board in the [[Dallas Cowboy]]s' [[AT&amp;T Stadium]] is 72 feet tall and 160 feet wide (22 m x 49 m), displaying HDTV at 1920 x 1080 resolution, 45 times more pixels.

The largest JumboTron in use was located at SkyDome (now [[Rogers Centre]]) in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and measured 10 m tall by 33.5 m wide (33&amp;nbsp;ft&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;110&amp;nbsp;ft) at a cost of [[USD|US$]]17 million. By comparison, a similar-sized LED system sold today would cost around $3 million. The Rogers Centre JumboTron was replaced in 2005 by a [[Daktronics]] ProStar as part of a stadium revitalization project.

==Specifications of production and design==
Originally, the JumboTron was not an LED ([[light-emitting diode]]) display since blue LEDs were unavailable at the time, and the only green LEDs available were of the traditional yellow-green variety, which were unsuitable for an RGB display. Each display consisted of multiple modules composed of 16 or more small flood-beam CRTs ([[cathode ray tube]]s), each of which included from 2 to 16 pixels composed of red, green, and blue phosphors. Sony displayed one of the earliest versions at the [[Expo '85]] [[World's Fair]] in [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba]].
Eventually, JumboTron systems adopted LED technology as blue and pure green LEDs were developed. LED-based systems have about ten times the lifespan of CRT-based systems, a key reason for the change.

A '''kytoon''' or '''kite balloon''' is a tethered aircraft which obtains some of its lift dynamically as a heavier-than-air [[kite]] and the rest aerostatically as a [[Lighter than air|lighter-than-air]] [[Balloon (aircraft)|balloon]].&lt;ref name=pm58&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5t0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=domina%20jalbert&amp;pg=PA83#v=onepage&amp;q=domina%20jalbert&amp;f=false Popular Mechanics Mar 1958]&lt;/ref&gt; The word is a [[portmanteau]] of kite and balloon.

The primary advantage of a kytoon is that it remains in a reasonably stable position above the tether point, irrespective of the strength of wind, whereas ordinary balloons and kites are less stable.&lt;ref name=pm58 /&gt;

The kytoon has been used for many purposes both civil and military.

==History==
In 1919, a handbook was published giving extensive details to support the kite balloon crafts being used in the military. Described is the first kite balloon made in 1893 by Captains Parseval and Sigsfeld at the Berlin works of the Prussian Balloon Battalion; theirs was the "predecessor of the ''Drachen'' balloon." "This was the first real kite balloon flying like a kite with a fairly constant angle and direction relative to the wind and remained practically unchanged until the beginning of the war in 1914-1918."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=M5gP3sgWf5AC&amp;dq=Kite%20Balloon%20Type%20%22M%22&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=Kite%20Balloon%20Type%20%22M%22&amp;f=false The Type "M" Kite Balloon Handbook,United States Navy Dept. Bureau of Construction and Repair, October, 1919.]&lt;/ref&gt;
A hybrid kite-balloon was patented by [[Domina Jalbert]]&lt;ref name=pm50 /&gt; in 1944 as patent [https://www.google.com/patents/US2431938 US2431938]. and later became known as the kytoon. Jalbert furthered his attention on kite balloons also with another patent filed on August 31, 1945 titled "[https://www.google.com/patents/US2398744 Kite Balloon]"

The [[Allsopp Helikite]] is a modern helium-filled example.

==Stability==
A captive balloon tends to drift down the wind and the harder the wind blows, the further the balloon drifts. This leans the tether over at an angle, pulling the balloon lower. On a kytoon, the kite action lifts the balloon, counteracting this pull and holding the kytoon in position. As the wind blows harder, the kite action lifts harder. This can provide good stability even in strong winds.

In low or gusty winds a kite can nose-dive, losing a large amount of height even if it recovers. Because a kytoon is buoyant it does not nose-dive and remains in position even in relatively still air.&lt;ref name=pm50&gt;"Kite + balloon = kytoon", ''Popular Mechanics'', August 1950, Page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
Applications of the kytoon have included:

* Raise communications antenna aloft.&lt;ref name=pm50 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0057119 RESPONSE OF A KYTOON TO VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL GUSTS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tifr.res.in/~bf/balloon_prod.html Balloon Production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100312082615/http://www.tifr.res.in/~bf/balloon_prod.html |date=2010-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''AN/SEQ-3 Laser Weapon System''' or '''XN-1 LaWS'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sadefensejournal.com/wp/?p=3459 The US Navy’s Electric Weaponry] - SAdefensejournal.com, 19 February 2016&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[directed-energy weapon]] developed by the [[United States Navy]]. The weapon was installed on {{USS|Ponce|LPD-15|6}} for field testing in 2014. In December 2014, the United States Navy reported that the LaWS system worked perfectly against low-end [[Asymmetric warfare|asymmetric]] threats, and that the commander of the ''Ponce'' is authorized to use the system as a defensive weapon.&lt;ref name=cnn2014&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lendon |first1=Brad |title=Navy: New laser weapon works, ready for action |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/11/tech/innovation/navy-laser-weapon |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=December 11, 2014 |ref=CNN2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The LaWS is a ship-defense system that has so far publicly engaged an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV or drone) and a simulated small-boat attacker. LaWS uses an infrared beam from a [[solid-state laser]] array which can be tuned to high output to destroy the target or low output to warn or cripple the sensors of a target. Among the advantages of this device versus projectile weapons is the low cost per shot, as each firing of the weapon requires only the minimal cost of generating the energetic pulse; by contrast ordnance for projectile weapons must be designed, manufactured, handled, transported and maintained, and takes up storage space.

The LaWS is designed to be used against low-end asymmetric threats.  Scalable power levels allow it to be used on low-power to dazzle a person's eye to non-lethally make them turn away from a threatening posture, and increase to 30 thousand watts (30&amp;nbsp;kW) to fry sensors, burn out motors, and detonate explosive materials.  Against a vital point on small UAVs, one can be shot down in as little as two seconds.  When facing small boats, the laser would target a craft's motor to disable it and make it "dead in the water," then repeating this against others in rapid succession, requiring only a few seconds of firing per boat.  Targeting the platform is more effective than individual crewmembers, although the LaWS is accurate enough to target explosive rockets if on board, whose detonations could kill the operators. Against a larger aircraft like a helicopter, LaWS can burn through some vital components to cause it to fall and crash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/12/star-wars-at-sea-navys-laser-gets-real/ Star Wars At Sea: Navy’s Laser Gets Real] – Breakingdefense.com, December 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2010, [[Kratos Defense &amp; Security Solutions]] was awarded an $11 million contract to support the [[Naval Surface Warfare Center]] (NSWC) in the development of LaWS for the U.S. Navy's Directed Energy and Electric Weapon Systems (DE&amp;EWS) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kratos Awarded $11 Million Contract to Support the Navy Directed Energy and Electric Weapon Systems and Total Ship Training System Program Offices |author= |url=http://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2010/07/29/426352/197887/en/Kratos-Awarded-11-Million-Contract-to-Support-the-Navy-Directed-Energy-and-Electric-Weapon-Systems-and-Total-Ship-Training-System-Program-Offices.html |newspaper=[[GlobeNewswire]] |date=July 29, 2010 |accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The May 2012 NSWC test used a [[close-in weapon system]] control system to enable the beam director to track an [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] target.&lt;ref name="urlNEWS - LAWS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/dahlgren/NEWS/LAWS/LAWS.aspx |title=NEWS – LAWS |accessdate=2013-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605232732/http://www.navsea.navy.mil/nswc/dahlgren/NEWS/LAWS/LAWS.aspx |archivedate=June 5, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LaWS was to be installed on USS ''Ponce'' in summer 2014 for a 12-month trial deployment.  The Navy spent about $40&amp;nbsp;million over the past six years on research, development, and testing of the laser weapon.  It will be directed to targets by the [[Phalanx CIWS]] radar.  If tests go well, the Navy could deploy a laser weapon operationally between 2017 and 2021 with an effective range of {{convert|1|mi|km nmi|abbr=on}}.  The exact level of power the LaWS will use is unknown but estimated between 15–50&amp;nbsp;kW for engaging small aircraft and high-speed boats.  Directed-energy weapons are being pursued for economic reasons, as they can be fired for as little as one dollar per shot, while conventional gun rounds and missiles can cost thousands of dollars each.  The Navy has a history of testing energy weapons, including megawatt [[chemical laser]]s in the 1980s.  Their chemicals were found to be too hazardous for shipboard use, so they turned to less powerful fiber solid-state lasers.  Other types can include slab solid state and free electron lasers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=1394 Navy’s Laser Gun Nears Critical Test] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140202182519/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/blog/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=1394 |date=February 2, 2014 }} – Nationaldefensemagazine.com, January 29, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The LaWS benefitted from commercial laser developments, with the system basically being six [[laser beam welding|welding lasers]] "strapped together" that, although they don't become a single beam, all converge on the target at the same time.  It generates 33&amp;nbsp;kW in testing, with follow-on deployable weapons generating 60–100&amp;nbsp;kW mounted on a [[Littoral Combat Ship]] or {{sclass-|Arleigh Burke|destroyer}} to destroy fast-attack boats, drones, manned aircraft, and anti-ship cruise missiles out to a few miles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://breakingdefense.com/2014/05/laser-weapons-lower-expectations-higher-threats/ Laser Weapons: Lower Expectations, Higher Threats] – Breakingdefense.com, May 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the short term, the LaWS will act as a short-range, self-defense system against drones and boats, while more powerful lasers in the future should have enough power to destroy anti-ship missiles; Navy slab lasers have been tested at 105&amp;nbsp;kW with increases to 300&amp;nbsp;kW planned.  Laser weapons like the LaWS are meant to complement other missile and gun-based defense systems rather than replace them.  While lasers are significantly cheaper and have virtually unlimited magazines, their beams can be disrupted by atmospheric and weather conditions (especially when operating at the ocean's surface) and are restricted to line-of-sight firing to continuously keep the beam on target.  More conventional systems will remain in place for larger and longer-range targets that require the use of kinetic defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2014/August/Pages/LasersCouldBecomeCostEffectiveMissileDefenseWeapons.aspx Lasers Could Become Cost Effective Missile Defense Weapons] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522181019/http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2014/August/Pages/LasersCouldBecomeCostEffectiveMissileDefenseWeapons.aspx |date=May 22, 2016 }} – Nationaldefensemagazine.org, August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deployment===
The LaWS was deployed on the ''Ponce'' in late August 2014 to the [[Persian Gulf]] with the [[U.S. 5th Fleet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Navy's New Laser Weapon Blasts Bad Guys From Air, Sea |author=Luis Martinez |url=https://news.yahoo.com/navys-laser-weapon-blasts-bad-215808231.html |newspaper=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] |date=April 9, 2013 |accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. Navy sees shipboard laser weapon coming soon |author=Jonathan Skillings |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11386_3-57578559-76/u.s-navy-sees-shipboard-laser-weapon-coming-soon/ |newspaper=[[CNET]] |date=April 8, 2013 |accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=US to deploy new laser weapon to Persian Gulf |url=http://rt.com/usa/us-laser-weapon-persian-gulf-530/ |newspaper=[[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]] |date=April 9, 2013 |accessdate=April 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deployment is to test the feasibility of a laser weapon in a maritime environment against heat, humidity, dust, and salt water and to see how much power is used.  The system has scalable power levels to be able to fire a non-lethal beam to dazzle a suspect vessel, and fire stronger beams to physically destroy a target; range is classified.  Although neighboring Iran has threatened to block the [[Strait of Hormuz]] out of the Gulf using small boat swarms that the LaWS is able to counter, it was not designed or deployed specifically to be used against any one particular country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-11-14/u-s-navy-deploys-its-first-laser-weapon-in-the-persian-gulf.html?hootPostID=94e130e1e7fc30541915dec039384948 U.S. Navy Deploys Its First Laser Weapon in the Persian Gulf] – Bloomberg.com, November 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, the LaWS was declared an operational asset, so the ship commander has permission to use it for self-defense.  Humans are not a target of the weapon under stipulations of the [[Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons]], but targets do include UAVs, helicopters, and fast patrol craft.  Rules of engagement have been developed for its use, but details have not been released.  The Navy has released video of the LaWS on deployment disabling a [[Boeing Insitu ScanEagle|ScanEagle]] UAV, detonating a [[rocket propelled grenade]], and burning out the engine of a rigid hull inflatable boat.  Officials said it is working beyond expectations. Compared to hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars for a missile, one laser shot costs only 59 cents.  Composed of commercial laser components and proprietary Navy software, it is powered and cooled by a "skid" through a diesel generator, separate from the ship's electrical systems, giving greater efficiency relative to power provided of 35 percent.  Mounted on the ''Ponce'''s superstructure above the bridge, its powerful optics are also useful as a surveillance tool that can detect objects at unspecified but "tactically significant ranges"; sailors have equated its surveillance abilities to having the [[Hubble telescope]] at sea.  Sailors are using it for targeting and training daily, whether to disable or destroy test targets or for potential target identification.  The system is operated through a flat screen monitor and a gaming system-like controller integrated into the ship's combat system, so anyone with experience playing common video games can operate the weapon.  It has functioned well against adverse weather, able to work in high humidity and after a dust storm.  However, the system is not expected to work during harsh sandstorms and has not been tested in such conditions because "it didn't make much sense to", but threats would also not be expected to be operational under the same conditions.  Deployments on other ships are being examined and although the LaWS was planned to remain deployed for one year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.usni.org/2014/12/10/u-s-navy-allowed-use-persian-gulf-laser-defense U.S. Navy Allowed to Use Persian Gulf Laser for Defense] – News.USNI.org, December 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.military.com/daily-news/2014/12/10/navy-declares-laser-weapons-ready-to-protect-ships-in-persian.html?comp=7000023468025&amp;rank=1 Navy Declares Laser Weapons Ready to Protect Ships in Persian Gulf] – Military.com, December 10, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20141211/DEFREG02/312110043/Navy-s-First-Laser-Gun-Shines-Deployed-Exercises Navy's First Laser Gun Shines In Deployed Exercises] – Defensenews.com, December 11, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; it performed so well that fleet leadership decided to keep it on the ''Ponce'' as long as it was at sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.usni.org/2015/07/28/navy-pursuing-upgraded-railgun-higher-power-laser-gun-by-2020 Navy Pursuing Upgraded Railgun, Higher-Power Laser Gun By 2020] - News.USNI.org, 28 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a review of several ship classes to determine which had available space, power, and cooling, it was decided that after the ''Ponce's'' planned decommissioning in 2018, the LaWS will be moved to the new amphibious transport dock ship {{USS|Portland|LPD-27}} for indefinite testing, it will utilise the space and power connections reserved for VLS to house the LaWS power and control modules while the laser itself will be bolted to the deck. Because the installation will be only a trial, LaWS will not be integrated into the ship's warfare system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.usni.org/2018/01/10/lpd-portland-selected-host-onr-laser-weapon-demonstrator-serve-rimpac-2018-flagship LPD Portland Will Host ONR Laser Weapon Demonstrator, Serve as RIMPAC 2018 Flagship]. Megan Eckstein, ''USNI News''. 10 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, the Navy announced a $150 million contract with Lockheed Martin for the production of two more LaWS units to be delivered in 2020; one will be fitted to {{USS|Arleigh Burke|DDG-51}} while the other will be used for land-based testing. Further contract options could bring its value to $942.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Navy_orders_laser_weapon_systems_from_Lockheed_Martin_999.html Navy orders laser weapon systems from Lockheed Martin].

'''''Mammoths, Sabertooths, and Hominids: 65 Million Years of Mammalian Evolution in Europe''''' is a book written by [[Jordi Agustí]] and illustrated by [[Mauricio Antón]]. It was first published in 2002 by [[Columbia University Press]].

The book is a journey through {{mya|65|million years}} of palaeontological records, from the extinction of the dinosaurs to just before present.  Notwithstanding the title, the book includes the complex evolutionary records of most continents within its pages&amp;nbsp;– thoroughfully described by Agustí and breathtakingly illustrated by Antón.

Agustí and Antón provide a broad overview of the Tertiary history of mammals in Europe: the evolutionary changes within the European fauna as well as the fates of immigrant taxa that arrived from other continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1073295 | last1 = Flannery | first1 = T. | title = PALEONTOLOGY: Mammals on the European Stage | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5578 | pages = 57 | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4156">[[File:Beautiful Geghard Monastery.jpg|thumbnail|[[Geghard]] Monastery in [[Armenia]], founded in 4th century]]
A '''monolithic church''' or '''rock-hewn church''' is a [[church architecture|church]] made from a single block of [[Rock (geology)|stone]]. Because freestanding rocks of sufficient size are rare, such [[monolithic architecture|edifices]] are usually hewn into the ground or into the side of a hill or mountain. They can be of comparable architectural complexity to constructed buildings.

The term ''monolithic church'' is most often used to refer to the complex of eleven churches in [[Lalibela]], [[Ethiopia]], believed to have been created in the 12th century. 

==Ethiopia==
[[Image:Bete Giyorgis 04.jpg|thumb|[[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Bete Giyorgis]] (Church of St. George), Lalibela, Ethiopia]]
A series of eleven monolithic churches in [[Lalibela]] are the Church of the Redeemer, of Saint Mary, of Mount Sinai, of Golgotha, of the House of the Cross, of the House of the Virgins, of Saint Gabriel, of Abba Matta, of Saint Mercurius, and of Immanuel. The most famous of the edifices is the cross-shaped [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of St. George]] (Bete Giyorgis). Tradition credits its construction to the [[Zagwe dynasty]] King [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela]], who was a devout [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Orthodox Tewahedo]] [[Christianity|Christian]]. The medieval monolithic churches of this 12th-century 'New Jerusalem' are situated in a mountainous region in the heart of Ethiopia near a traditional village. Lalibela is an important center of Ethiopian Christianity, and even today is a place of pilgrimage and devotion. Lalibela is one of the world's heritage sites registered by UNESCO.

Many other churches were [[rock-cut architecture|hewn from rock]] in Ethiopia, outside of Lalibela. This practice was very common in [[Tigray Region|Tigray]], where the outside world knew of only a few such churches until the [[Roman Catholicism in Ethiopia|Catholic]] priest Abba Tewelde Medhin Josief presented a paper to the Third International Conference of Ethiopian Studies in which he announced the existence of over 120 churches, 90 of which were still in use.&lt;ref&gt;Ghelawdewos Araia, ''[http://www.africanidea.org/magnificent_aksum.html The Magnificence of Aksum: Revisiting Ethiopian Civilization]''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Dr. Josief's death soon after his presentation, research over the next few years raised the total number of these rock-hewn churches to 153.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Briggs, ''Ethiopia: The Bradt Travel Guide'', 5th edition (Chalfont St Peters: Bradt, 2002), p. 278&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other churches==
[[Image:Helsinki Temppeliaukio.jpg|thumb|right|[[Temppeliaukio Church]] in Helsinki]]
There are a number of monolithic churches elsewhere in the world. However, none have the free-standing external walls of the Lalibela churches. They instead more closely resemble [[cave monastery|cave monasteries]] in that they consist of tunnels converging into a single rock. Examples include:

* The [[Geghard]] monastery, [[Kotayk Province]], Armenia
* The [[Rock-hewn Churches of Ivanovo]], [[Bulgaria]] near [[Ruse, Bulgaria|Ruse]]
* The subterranean St. Jean Church in [[Aubeterre-sur-Dronne]], France
* Church in [[Saint-Émilion]], France
* [[Temppeliaukio Church]] in [[Helsinki]], Finland
* The subterranean rock churches in [[Cappadocia]], Turkey which number beyond one thousand and contain some superb examples of [[Byzantine]] wall-paintings, representing both the academic classicizing trend in Byzantine art, and some archaic popular styles

'''NACA Report No. 736 - Nonstationary Flow about a Wing-aileron-tab Combination Including Aerodynamic Balance''' was issued by the United States [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] in 1942. It analyzes the oscillating air forces on an airfoil that is equipped with various control or lift-augmenting devices.

==Summary==
NACA Report No. 736 presents a continuation of the flutter analysis published in [[NACA Report No. 496]]. The results of that paper have been extended to include the effect of [[Balanced rudder|aerodynamic balance]] and the effect of adding a control tab to the aileron. The aerodynamic coefficients are presented in a form usable for application to the flutter problem.

NACA Report 736 presents theoretical expressions for the forces and the moments in a uniform
horizontal air stream on a plane airfoil performing small sinusoidal motions in several degrees of freedom: verticaI motion, torsional movement about an arbitrary spanwise axis, aileron movement about a hinge axis not necessarily located at the Ieading edge of the aileron, and tab movement similar to the aileron movement. The solution of this problem has direct application to the larger problem of flutter involving these various degrees of freedom and, in particular, to flutter of tails with control surfaces, including servocontrols. The development of the theory is analogous with
that of Report No. 496, which treats the case of three degreea of freedom: vertical motion, torsional movement about an arbitrary spanwise axis, and an aileron movement about a hinge axis located at the aileron's leading edge.

==Conclusions==
The material presented in NACA Report No. 736 represents an extension of the work in NACA Report No. 496, which has been expanded to include tab functions, and the effect of aerodynamic balance. Inasmuch as this addition fits in with the general arrangement of the earlier report, reference should be made to that report, and also to [[NACA Report No. 685]], for application to the flutter problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18359">'''Nanocomposite hydrogels''' ('''NC gels''') are nanomaterial-filled, hydrated, polymeric networks that exhibit higher elasticity and strength relative to traditionally made [[Gel#Hydrogels|hydrogels]]. A range of natural and synthetic [[polymer]]s are used to design nanocomposite network. By controlling the interactions between [[nanoparticle]]s and [[polymer]] chains, a range of physical, chemical, and biological properties can be engineered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carrow|first1=James K.|last2=Gaharwar|first2=Akhilesh K.|title=Bioinspired Polymeric Nanocomposites for [[Regenerative Medicine]]|journal=Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics|date=November 2014|pages=248–264|doi=10.1002/macp.201400427|volume=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of organic (polymer) and inorganic (clay) structure gives these hydrogels improved physical, chemical, electrical, biological, and swelling/de-swelling properties that cannot be achieved by either material alone.&lt;ref name="AppsDrugDeliver"&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Song|first= Fangfang|last2= Li|first2= Xiaoqiong|last3= Wang|first3= Qun|last4= Liao|first4= Liqiong|last5= Zhang|first5= Chao|date= August 2015|title= Nanocomposite Hydrogels and Their Applications in Drug Delivery and Tissue Engineering|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265092165_Nanocomposite_Hydrogels_and_Their_Applications_in_Drug_Delivery_and_Tissue_Engineering|journal= Journal of Biomedical Nanotechnology|pages= 40–52|volume= 11|issue= 1|doi= 10.1166/jbn.2015.1962|access-date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by flexible biological tissues, researchers incorporate carbon-based, polymeric, ceramic and/or metallic nanomaterials to give these hydrogels superior characteristics like optical properties and stimulus-sensitivity which can potentially be very helpful to medical (especially drug delivery and stem cell engineering) and mechanical fields.&lt;ref name="AppsDrugDeliver" /&gt;

Nanocomposite hydrogels are not to be confused with ''[[nanogel]]'', a nanoparticle composed of a hydrogel.

==Synthesis==
The synthesis of [[nanocomposite]] hydrogels is a process that requires specific material and method. These polymers need to be made up of equally spaced out, 30&amp;nbsp;nm in diameter, [[Clay minerals|clay]] platelets that can swell and exfoliate in the presence of water. The platelets act as [[cross-link]]s to modify molecular functions to enable the hydrogels to have superior elasticity and toughness that resembles closely that of biological tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Wiley Online Library|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-4095(20020816)14:16%253C1120::AID-ADMA1120%253E3.0.CO;2-9/abstract|doi= 10.1002/1521-4095(20020816)14:16&lt;1120::aid-adma1120&gt;3.0.co;2-9|volume=14|journal=Advanced Materials|pages=1120|access-date=22 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using clay platelets that do not swell or exfoliate in water, using an organic cross-linker such as N,N-methylenebisacrylamide(BIS), mixing of clay and BIS, or preparing nanocomposite hydrogels in a method other than cross-link, will be unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://csw.ch.bme.hu/oktatas/konyvek/fizkem/SMART/20141009_polymer%20gels/additional%20knowledge/nanocomposite%20hydrogels.pdf|title= Nanocomposite hydrogels|last= Haraguchi|first= Kazutoshi|date= 22 May 2008|work= |access-date= |via= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite all the specifications, the process of synthesizing nanocomposite hydrogels is simple and because of the flexible nature of the material, these hydrogels can be easily made to come in different shapes such as huge blocks, sheets, thin films, rods, hollow tubes, spheres, bellows and uneven sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Nanocomposite Gels: New Advanced Functional Soft Materials|url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/masy.200751014/abstract|journal= Macromolecular Symposia|date= 2007-09-01|issn= 1521-3900|pages= 120–130|volume= 256|issue= 1|doi= 10.1002/masy.200751014|first= Kazutoshi|last= Haraguchi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==

===Mechanical===
Nanocomposite hydrogels are tough, and can withstand stretching, bending, knotting, crushing, and other modifications.

====Tensile====
[[Tensile testing]]s were performed on nanocomposite hydrogels to measure the stress and strain it experiences when elongated under room temperature. The results show that this material can be stretched up to 1000% of its original length.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Nanocomposite hydrogels|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359028608000144|journal= Current Opinion in Solid State and Materials Science|date= 2007-06-01|pages= 47–54|volume= 11|issue= 3–4|doi= 10.1016/j.cossms.2008.05.001|first= Kazutoshi|last= Haraguchi|bibcode= 2007COSSM..11...47H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Compression====
[[Hysteresis]] is used to measure the compression properties of nanocomposite hydrogels, which shows that this material can withstand around 90% compression. This data shows that nanocomposite hydrogels exhibit superior strength relative to conventionally-made [[Gel#Hydrogels|hydrogels]], which would have broken down under less compression.

===Swelling and stimulus sensitivity===

====Swelling, de-swelling====
The porous network of clay particles enable nanocomposite hydrogels to swell in the presence of water. Swelling (and de-swelling) distinguishes NC gels from conventionally-made hydrogels (OR gels) as it is a property that OR gels lack. The swelling property of NC gels allows them to collect the surrounding aqueous solution instead of being dissolved by it, which helps make them good candidates for drug delivery carriers.&lt;ref name="Hamidi 1638–1649"&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Hydrogel nanoparticles in drug delivery|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169409X08002275|journal= Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews|date= 2008-12-14|pages= 1638–1649|volume= 60|series= 2008 Editors' Collection|issue= 15|doi= 10.1016/j.addr.2008.08.002|first= Mehrdad|last= Hamidi|first2= Amir|last2= Azadi|first3= Pedram|last3= Rafiei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stimulus sensitivity====
Nanocomposite hydrogels are observed to be temperature sensitive and will change temperature when their surrounding is altered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= The unique optical and physical properties of soft, transparent, stimulus-sensitive nanocomposite gels|url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253869244_The_unique_optical_and_physical_properties_of_soft_transparent_stimulus-sensitive_nanocomposite_gels_-_art._no._66540O|journal= Liquid Crystals XI|doi= 10.1117/12.734714|first= Kazutoshi|last= Haraguchi|first2= Huan-jun|last2= Li|first3= Liyuan|last3= Song}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inorganic salts, when absorbed, will result in changing the hydrogels to a lower temperature whereas cat-ionic surfactant will shift the temperature the other way. The temperature of these hydrogels are around 40 degrees Celsius, making it a possible candidate for use as biomaterial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Swelling behavior of thermosensitive nanocomposite hydrogels composed of oligo(ethylene glycol) methacrylates and clay|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014305715002244|journal= European Polymer Journal|date= 2015-08-01|pages= 472–482|volume= 69|doi= 10.1016/j.eurpolymj.2015.03.072|first= Mengge|last= Xia|first2= Weijie|last2= Wu|first3= Fengwei|last3= Liu|first4= Patrick|last4= Theato|first5= Meifang|last5= Zhu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stimulus-sensitivity of hydrogels allow for a responsive release system where the hydrogels can be designed to deliver the drug in response to changes in condition of the body.

==Types==

===Via carbon-based nanomaterials===
Nanocomposite hydrogels that are enforced with carbon-based nanomaterials are mechanically tough and electrically conducive, which make them suitable for use in biomedicine, tissue engineering, drug delivery, [[Biosensor|biosensing]], etc. The electrical conducting property of these hydrogels allow them to mimic the characteristic of nerve, muscle, and cardiac tissues. However, even though these nanocomposite hydrogels demonstrate some functions of human tissue in lab environments, more research is needed to ensure their utility as tissue replacement.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title= Nanocomposite hydrogels for biomedical applications|journal= Biotechnology and Bioengineering|date= 2014-03-01|issn= 0006-3592|pmc= 3924876|pmid= 24264728|pages= 441–453|volume= 111|issue= 3|doi= 10.1002/bit.25160|first= Akhilesh K.|last= Gaharwar|first2= Nicholas A.|last2= Peppas|first3= Ali|last3= Khademhosseini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Via polymeric nanoparticles===
Nanocomposite hydrogels incorporated with polymeric nanoparticles are tailored for drug delivery and tissue engineering. The addition of polymeric nanoparticles gives these hydrogels a reinforced polymeric network that is more stiff and has the ability to enclose hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs along with genes and proteins. The high stress-absorbing property makes them a potential candidate for cartilage tissue engineering.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Via inorganic nanoparticles===
Most inorganic nanoparticles used for nanocomposite hydrogels are already present in and necessary for the body, and thus present no negative impacts on the body. Some of them, like calcium and silicon, help with preventing bone loss and skeletal development. Others, like nanoclays, improve the structural formation and characteristics of hydrogels where they acquire self-healing properties, flame retardant structures, elasticity, super gas-barrier membrane, oil-repellence, etc. The unique properties obtained by incorporating nanocomposite hydrogels with inorganic nanoparticles will let researchers work on improving bone-related tissue engineering.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Via metal and metal-oxide nanoparticles===
The electrical and thermal conductivity and magnetic property of metals enhance the electrical conductivity and antibacterial property of nanocomposite hydrogels when incorporated. The electrical conducting property is necessary for the hydrogels to start forming functional tissues and be used as imaging agents, drug delivery systems, conductive scaffolds, switchable electronics, actuators, and sensors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Hydrogels: smart materials for drug delivery : Oriental Journal of Chemistry|url= http://www.orientjchem.org/vol29no3/hydrogels-smart-materials-for-drug-delivery/|website= www.orientjchem.org|accessdate= 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Researchers have been looking for a material that can mimic tissue properties to make the [[tissue engineering]] process more effective and less invasive to the human body. The porous, interconnecting network of nanocomposite hydrogels, created through cross-link, enable wastes and nutrients to easily enter and exit the structure, and their elastomeric properties let them acquire the desired anatomical shape without needing prior molding. The porous structure of this material would also make the process of [[drug delivery]] easier where the pharmaceutical compounds present in the hydrogel can easily escape and be absorbed by the body. Aside from that, researchers are also looking into incorporating nanocomposite hydrogels with [[silver nanoparticle]]s for antibacterial applications and microorganism elimination in medical and food packing and water treatment.Hydrogels infused with nanoparticles have a number of biological applications, including: tissue engineering, chemical and biological sensing and drug and gene delivery.

===Tissue engineering===
As tissue replacements, nanocomposite hydrogels need to interact with cells and form functional tissues. With the incorporated nanoparticles and nanomaterials, these hydrogels can mimic the physical, chemical, electrical, and biological properties of most native tissue. Each type of nanocomposite hydrogels has its own unique properties that let it mimic certain types of animal tissue.

===Drug delivery===
The emergence of nanocomposite hydrogels allow for more site-specific and time-controlled delivery of drugs of different sizes at improved safety and specificity. Depending on the method of inserting drugs into the material, for example, dissolved, encased, or attached, the drug carrier will be named differently: nanoparticles, nanospheres (where the drug is evenly dispersed throughout the polymeric network), or [[nanocapsule]]s (where the drug is surrounded by a polymer shell structure).&lt;ref name="Hamidi 1638–1649"/&gt; The elastomeric nature of this material allows the hydrogels to obtain the shape of the targeted site and thus the hydrogels can be manufactured identically and used on all patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Highly extensible, tough, and elastomeric nanocomposite hydrogels from poly (ethylene glycol) and hydroxyapatite nanoparticles|url= https://www.academia.edu/3461771/Highly_extensible_tough_and_elastomeric_nanocomposite_hydrogels_from_poly_ethylene_glycol_and_hydroxyapatite_nanoparticles|website= www.academia.edu|accessdate= 2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogels are controlled drug delivery agents that can be engineered to have desired properties.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Peppas, N.; Hilt, J. Z.; Khademhosseini, A. Hydrogels in Biology and medicine: From Molecular Principles to Bionanotechnology. ''Advanced Materials''. [Online] '''2006''', 18, 1345 – 1360. (accessed October 4, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, hydrogels can be designed to release drugs or other agents in response to physical characteristics of the environment like temperature and pH.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The responsiveness of hydrogels is a result of their molecular structure and polymer networks.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Hydrogel nanoparticles have a promising future in the drug delivery field. Ideally, drug delivery systems should, “…maximize the efficacy and the safety of the therapeutic agent, delivering an appropriate amount at a suitable rate and to the most appropriate site in the body”.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Cirillo, G.; Hampel, S.; Spizzirri, U. Carbon Nanotubes Hybrid Hydrogels in Drug Delivery: A Perspective Review. Biomed Research International, Hindawi. [Online] '''2014''' http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/825017/ (accessed October 4, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Nanotechnology incorporated within hydrogels has the potential to meet all the requirements of an ideal drug delivery system. Hydrogels have been studied with a variety of nanocomposites including: clay, gold, silver, iron oxide, carbon nanotubes, hydroxyapatite, and tricalcium phosphate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Nanoparticles, largely due to their size related physical properties, are highly useful as drug delivery agents. They can overcome physiological barriers and reach specific targets.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Goncalves, C.; Periera, P.; Gama, M.  Self Assembled Hydrogel nanoparticles for Drug Delivery Applications. ''Materials''. [Online] '''2010''', 3, 1420-1460. http://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials (accessed October 4, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;  Nanoparticles’ size, surface charge and properties enable them to penetrate biological barriers that most other drug carriers cannot.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; To become even more specified, nanoparticles can be coated with targeting ligands.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The ability of nanoparticles to deliver drugs to specific targets suggests the potential to limit systemic side-effects and immune responses.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;1) Nayak, S.; Lyon, L. Soft Nanotechnology with Soft Nanoparticles.  ''Nanotechnology.'' [Online] '''2005''', 44.47. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.200501321/pdf (accessed October 9, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of nanoparticles to carry and release drugs is also largely dependent on characteristics which result from the small size and unique surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles can generally carry drugs in two ways: drugs can either be bound to the outside of the nanoparticles or packed within the polymeric matrix of the nanoparticles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Smaller nanoparticles have higher surface area ratios and can thus bind a high quantity of drug, while larger nanoparticles can encapsulate more of the drug within its core.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The best method of drug loading is dependent on the structures of the drug to be bound. Also, drug loading can occur as the nanoparticles are produced, or the drugs can be added to pre-existing nanoparticles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The release of drugs, depends largely on the size of the nanoparticle carrying it. Because nanoparticles can be bound to the surface of nanoparticles, which is large relative to the volume of the particles, drugs can be released quickly. In contrast, drugs that are loaded within nanoparticles are released more slowly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Antibacterial applications===
Silver nanoparticles are inserted into the 3D polymeric networks of nanocomposite hydrogels for applications in antibacterial activity and improvement in electrical conductance. The presence of silver ions either stop the respiratory enzyme from transferring electrons to oxygen molecules during respiration or prevent proteins from reacting with thiol groups (-SH) on bacteria membrane, both result in the death of bacteria and microorganism without damaging mammal cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijcc/2013/243695/|title= Development and Characterization of Semi-IPN Silver Nanocomposite Hydrogels for Antibacterial Applications|date= 2013|accessdate= |website= |publisher= International Journal of Carbohydrate Chemistry|last= |first= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The size of these silver nanoparticles need to be small enough to pass through the cell membrane and thus further research is required to manufacture them into appropriate sizes.

===Concerns===
Some concerns relating to hydrogels infused with nanoparticles are the chances of either bursting, or of incomplete release of drugs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although hydrogels infused with nanoparticles are speculated to be quite promising methods of drug, protein, peptide, oligosaccharide, vaccine, and nucleic acid delivery, more studies regarding nanotoxicology and safety are required before clinical applications can be pursued.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Further, to avoid accumulation, biodegradable gels and nanoparticles are highly desirable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The '''New World Agriculture and Ecology Group''' (NWAEG) is an organization focused on [[sustainable agriculture]], [[conservation biology]] and [[social justice]].

==History==

Originally known as the New World Agriculture Group, NWAEG (pronounced "new-ag") became active in the 1980s. NWAEG drew inspiration from the 1970s-1980s [[Science for the People]] movement, and many of its founding members were active in Science for the People.

NWAEG's best-known project was an intensive effort to provide agricultural research and extension services to the [[Nicaragua]]n people during the [[Sandinista]] era.  [[Cuba]] and [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]] are locations of other NWAEG projects, exemplifying the group's informal focus on [[Latin America]].

'''Overlogging''' is a kind of [[overexploitation]] caused by [[logging|legal]] or [[illegal logging]] activities that lead to [[unsustainable]] or irrecoverable [[deforestation]] and permanent [[habitat destruction]] for forest [[wildlife]]. Overlogging is often associated with attempts at reducing the "[[third world debt]]" but is not restricted to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=Iuc8DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;lpg=PA186&amp;dq=overlogging+overgrazing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7U1Mpnr3IF&amp;sig=uqcyQ5MDG_WeUyrQ3Kh_yYiOum0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=overlogging%20overgrazing&amp;f=false|title=The Global Politics of the Environment|chapter=Strategies for sustainable development - Debt and the environment}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the developed world's growing demand for [[pulp and paper]], especially - but not restricted to - for [[disposable]] [[tissue paper|tissues]], overlogging is an imminent threat to Earth's forests everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=WWF|url=http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/deforestation/forest_sector_transformation/pulp_and_paper/|title=Pulp and paper |quote=Paper products are crucial to society, as they have enabled literacy and cultural development.

The adoption of '''plug-in electric vehicles in  Germany''' is actively supported by the  [[German Federal Government]]. Under its [[Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität|National Plattform for Electric Mobility]], [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] set the goal in 2010 to deploy one million electric vehicles on German roads by 2020.&lt;ref name=Goal2020/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goal2020_2/&gt; {{As of|2017|12}}, a total of 129,246 plug-in electric cars have been registered in Germany since 2010.&lt;ref name=Germay2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Global2mi/&gt; The country is the largest passenger car market in Europe, however, {{as of|2016|12|lc=y}}, ranked as the eighth largest plug-in market in the world and the fifth largest in Europe.&lt;ref name=Global2mi/&gt;&lt;ref name=Europe500K/&gt; About 80% of the [[plug-in electric car]]s registered in the country through September 2016 were registered since January 2014.&lt;ref name=Germany2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Germany2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Germany092016/&gt; {{As of|2014|11}}, the country had 4,800 public charging stations.&lt;ref name=GERincentives2014/&gt;

The market share of plug-in electric passenger cars increased from 0.12% of new car sales in 2012, to 0.25% in 2013, and reached 0.40% in 2014.&lt;ref name=Germany2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Germany2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=EU122012/&gt; As plug-in car sales surge in 2015, the segment's market share increased to 0.7% of new car sales.&lt;ref name=Germany2015/&gt; The German monthly plug-in market share passed the 1% mark for the first time ever in December 2015, with an all-time record market share of 1.28% of new car registrations that month.&lt;ref name=Germany2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Record122015/&gt;  After the introduction of the purchase subsidy in mid-2016, the plug-in segment achieved a market share of 1.1% in September, the highest during the first nine months of 2016.&lt;ref name=MarketShare1pc/&gt; The market share remained at 0.7% in 2016, but rose to 1.6% in 2017, with sales up 217% from 2016.&lt;ref name=Germany2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Germay2017/&gt;

Initially, the government announced that it would not provide subsidies to promote sales of plug-in electric vehicles, however, by the end of 2014 it was recognized that the country was well behind the set sales targets.&lt;ref name=Goal2020/&gt;&lt;ref name=GERincentives2014/&gt; As a result, an incentive scheme to promote plug-in electric vehicle adoption was approved in April 2016 with a budget of {{euro|1 billion}} ({{USD|1.13 billion}}), of which, a total of {{euro|600 million}} ({{USD|678 million}}) is reserved for purchase subsidies, which are expected to run until  all the money is disbursed, estimated to last until 2019 at the latest. Electric car buyers get a {{euro|4000}} ({{USD|4520}}) discount while buyers of plug-in hybrid vehicles get a discount of {{euro|3000}} ({{USD|3390}}). Premium cars are not eligible to the incentive.&lt;ref name=BonusGer/&gt; Only electric vehicles purchased after 18 May 2016 are eligible for the bonus.&lt;ref name=Bild052016/&gt;

[[File:Elektromobilität - Angela Merkel 2010.JPG|thumb|[[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] [[Angela Merkel]] announced her goal to bring 1 million electric vehicles on German roads at the 2010 Electromobility Summit in Berlin.]]

The private use of a company car is treated as taxable income in Germany and measured at a flat monthly rate of 1% of the vehicle's gross list price. So plug-in electric cars have been at a disadvantage since their price tag can be as much as double that of a car using a conventional internal combustion engine due to the high cost of the battery. In June 2013 German legislators approved a law that ends the tax disadvantage for corporate plug-in electric cars. The law, backdated to 1 January 2013, allows private users to offset the list price with {{euro|500}}  per unit of battery size, expressed in [[kilowatt hour]]s (kWh). The maximum offset was set at {{euro|10,000}} corresponding to a 20 [[kWh]] battery. the amount one can offset will sink annually by {{euro|50}} per kilowatt hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/07/germany-electricvehicles-tax-idUSL5N0EJ1Y320130607|title=Germany ends tax disadvantage for corporate electric cars |work=[[Reuters]] |date=2013-06-07|accessdate=2013-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the package of financial incentives approved in 2016, private owners of plug-in electric vehicles that charge their cars in their employer premises are exempted from declaring this perk as a cash benefit in their income tax return. Employers who provide this perk are allowed to discount from their income tax a 25% of the lump sum value of the cash benefit.

In August 2014, the federal government announced its plan to introduce non-monetary incentives through new legislation to be effective by early 2015. The proposed user benefits include measures to privilege battery-powered cars, fuel cell vehicles and some plug-in hybrids, just like Norway does, by granting local governments the authority to allow these vehicles into bus lanes, and to offer free parking and reserved parking spaces in locations with charging points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/neuwagen/handel/articles/454644/?cmp=nl-125|title=Förderung von Elektroautos kommt ins Rollen|language=German|trans-title=Promotion of electric cars gets rolling|author=Staff|work=KFZ-betrieb|date=2014-08-04|accessdate=2014-08-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826165602/http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/neuwagen/handel/articles/454644/?cmp=nl-125|archivedate=2014-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2014/08/15/germany-plans-new-ev-incentives-to-spur-uptake/|title=Germany plans new EV incentives to spur uptake |author=Faye Sunderland|work=The Green Car Website UK|date=2014-08-15|accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all plug-in hybrids will qualify for the benefits, only those with {{CO2}} emissions of no more than 50 g/km or an [[all-electric range]] of over {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on}} are eligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-24/germany-proposes-free-parking-to-spur-electric-car-sales|title=Germany Proposes Free Parking to Spur Electric-Car Sales|author=Stefan Nicola|work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=2014-09-24|accessdate=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range criteria will rise to {{Convert|40|km|abbr=on}} starting in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/transport/berlin-approves-new-incentives-electric-car-drivers-308700|title=Berlin approves new incentives for electric car drivers|author=Daniel Tost|publisher=EurActiv.com|date=2014-09-25|accessdate=2014-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bundestag]] passed the Electric Mobility Act in March 2015 authorizing local government to grant these non-monetary incentives, which are not mandatory.

According to the fourth progress report of the German National Platform for Electric Mobility, only about 24,000 plug-in electric cars are on German roads by the end of November 2014, well behind the target of 100,000 unit goal set for 2014. As a result, Chancellor Angela Merkel recognized in December 2014 that the government has to provide more incentives to meet the goal of having one million electric cars on the country's roads by 2020. Among others, the federal government is considering to offer a tax break for zero-emission company cars, more subsidies to expand charging infrastructure, particularly to deploy more public fast chargers, and more public funding for research and development of the next generation of rechargeable batteries.&lt;ref name=GERincentives2014&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-02/merkel-backs-incentives-in-1-million-electric-cars-push |title=Merkel Backs Incentives in Push for a Million Electric Cars |author1=Brian Parkin |author2=Dorothee Tschampa |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|date=2014-12-02|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dw.de/the-future-is-electric-or-is-it/a-18108847 |title=The future is electric - or is it?|author=Sabine Kinkartz|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=2014-12-03|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Purchase incentives ===

At the beginning of 2016, German politicians from the three parties in Mrs. Merkel's ruling coalition and auto executives began talks to introduce a subsidy for green car buyers worth up to {{euro|5000}} ({{USD|5500}}) to boost sales of electric and plug-in hybrid cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://europe.autonews.com/article/20160129/ANE/160129831/germany-will-mull-5000-euro-incentive-for-ev-plug-in-hybrid-sales | title=Germany considers $5,500 incentive for electric cars | work=[[Reuters]] | publisher= [[Automotive News|Automotive News Europe]] |date=2016-01-29 |accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2016|02}}, the German government proposal is for the auto industry to cover 40% of the cost of the purchase subsidy. Private buyers would get the full {{euro|5000}} subsidy, while corporate buyers would receive {{euro|3000}} for each electric car, and the program is expected to run until 2020, the deadline set to achieve the goal of 1 million electric cars on German roads.

Nissan Center Europe CEO said "''we remain convinced that the goal of one million electric cars by 2020 is still achievable''." According to Nissan if from now on electric car sales double every year until 2020, it is still possible to achieve the government goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/wirtschaft/articles/526724/?cmp=nl-125&amp;uuid=B225CA8F-E6F9-464D-9839-BAB0E10881B8 |title=Nissan will zusätzliche E-Prämie zahlen | language=German |trans-title= Nissan will pay an additional E-premium | first=Andreas |last=Grimm |work=KFZ-betrieb |date=2016-03-18 |accessdate=2016-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2014 Tesla Model S in Germany.jpg|thumb|The [[Tesla Model S]], and other premium car with a purchase price over {{euro|60,000}} ({{USD|67800}}) are not eligible to the purchase bonus.]]

An incentive scheme to promote plug-in electric vehicle adoption was approved in April 2016 with a budget of {{euro|1 billion}} ({{USD|1.13 billion}}). A total of {{euro|600 million}} ({{USD|678 million}})  is reserved for the purchase subsidies, which are expected to run until  all the money is disbursed, estimated to last until 2019 at the latest. Another {{euro|300 million}} ({{USD|339 million}}) are budgeted to finance the deployment of charging stations in cities and on autobahn highway stops. And another {{euro|100 million}} ({{USD|113 million}}) would go toward purchasing electric cars for federal government fleets. The program is aimed to promote the sale of 400,000 electric vehicles. The cost of the purchase incentive is shared equally between the government and automakers. Electric car buyers get a {{euro|4000}} ({{USD|4520}}) discount while buyers of plug-in hybrid vehicles get a discount of {{euro|3000}} ({{USD|3390}}). Premium cars, such as the [[Tesla Model S]] and [[BMW i8]], are not eligible to the incentive because there is a cap of {{euro|60,000}} ({{USD|67800}}) for the purchase price.&lt;ref name=BonusGer&gt;{{cite news | url=http://in.reuters.com/article/autos-electric-germany-discount-idINKCN0XO1Y4 | title=Germany to launch 1 billion-euro discount scheme for electric car buyers | first=Andreas | last=Cremer | work=[[Reuters]] | date=2016-04-27 | accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/germany-subsidy-boost-electric-car-sales | title=Germany to give €1bn subsidy to boost electric car sales | author=Agence France-Presse | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=2016-04-28 | accessdate=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/wirtschaft/articles/531213/?cmp=nl-125&amp;uuid=B225CA8F-E6F9-464D-9839-BAB0E10881B8 |title=Bis zu 4.000 Euro Förderung für Elektroautos |language=German |trans-title=Up to 4,000 euros in funding for electric cars |author=Staff |work=KFZ-betrieb |date=2016-04-27 |accessdate=2016-04-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20160616183533/http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/wirtschaft/articles/531213/?cmp=nl-125&amp;uuid=B225CA8F-E6F9-464D-9839-BAB0E10881B8 |archivedate=2016-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only electric vehicles purchased after 18 May 2016 are eligible for the bonus and the owner must keep the new electric car at least nine months.

;Loophole to EU regulations
According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', by the early fourth quarter of 2015 the [[Kia Soul EV]] ranked as the top selling [[plug-in electric car]] in Germany during 2015 with 2,459 units sold, with almost 1,000 registered in October, nevertheless, there were actually only a few of them on German roads. At the time, about 1,400 Soul EVs had been shipped to Norway and sold as used cars, where availability of new Soul EVs was limited. According to the magazine, [[Kia Motors]] is registering the electric cars in Germany and then shipping them to Norway, which does not belong to the [[European Union]], as a strategy to reduce the average {{CO2}} fleet emissions of the entire [[Hyundai-Kia Group]]. This strategy allows the carmaker to comply with European Union regulations that mandate 130 grams of {{CO2}} emission per km in 2015, and so they avoid to pay a fine of {{euro|70 million}} per year for each gram above the established average limit.

=== National Platform for Electric Mobility ===
{{Main article|Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität}}

The German [[Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität|National Platform for Electric Mobility ("Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität")]] is an advisory council of the German Federal Government for electric vehicle introduction. It consists of the top representatives of industry (10 Members), politics (6), science (3), associations (3) and unions (1). It was officially established on 3 May 2010 during a meeting with German chancellor Angela Merkel. Its task is to push on the National Development Plan for Electric Mobility ("Nationaler Entwicklungsplan Elektromobilität"). The goal for 2020 of the NPE is to develop Germany to the leading supplier and lead market for electric mobility and to gain employment in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationale-plattform-elektromobilitaet.de/en/background/the-approach/ |title=Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität: Background |accessdate=2016-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Inrush Current into HVDC Capacitor.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Peak inrush current into a high voltage capacitor upon power up can stress the component, reducing its reliability.]]

'''Pre-charge''' of the powerline [[voltages]] in a high voltage [[Direct current|DC]] application is a preliminary mode which limits the inrush current during the power up procedure. 

A high-voltage system with a large capacitive load can be exposed to high electric current during initial turn-on. This current, if not limited, can cause considerable stress or damage to the system components. In some applications, the occasion to activate the system is a rare occurrence, such as in commercial utility power distribution.  In other systems such as vehicle applications, pre-charge will occur with each use of the system, multiple times per day.  Precharging is implemented to increase the lifespan of electronic components and increase reliability of the high voltage system.

== Background:  inrush currents into capacitors==
[[Inrush current|Inrush currents]] into [[capacitive]] components are a key concern in power-up stress to components. When DC input power is applied to a capacitive load, the step response of the voltage input will cause the input capacitor to charge.  The capacitor charging starts with an inrush current and ends with an exponential decay down to the steady state condition.  When the magnitude of the inrush peak is very large compared to the maximum rating of the components, then component stress is to be expected.  
The current into a capacitor is known to be &lt;math&gt;I = C(dV/dT)&lt;/math&gt;: the peak inrush current will depend upon the [[capacitance]] C and the rate of change of the [[voltage]] (dV/dT).  The inrush current will increase as the capacitance value increases, and the inrush current will increase as the voltage of the power source increases.  This second parameter is of primary concern in high voltage power distribution systems.  By their nature, high voltage power sources will deliver high voltage into the distribution system.  Capacitive loads will then be subject to high inrush currents upon power-up.  The stress to the components must be understood and minimized.

The objective of a pre-charge function is to limit the magnitude of the inrush current into capacitive loads during power-up.  This may take several seconds depending on the system.  In general, higher voltage systems benefit from longer pre-charge times during power-up.

Consider an example where a high voltage source powers up a typical electronics control unit which has an internal power supply with 11000 µF input capacitance. When powered from a 28 V source, the inrush current into the electronics unit would approach 31 amperes in 10 milliseconds.  If that same circuit is activated by a 610 V source, then the inrush current would approach 670 A in 10 milliseconds.  It is wise not to allow unlimited inrush currents from high voltage power distribution system activation into capacitive loads: instead the inrush current should be controlled to avoid power-up stress to components.

== Definition of a pre-charge function==
[[Image:Precharge.jpg|thumb|right|500px|Precharging a high voltage DC power distribution line can control the inrush current into capacitive components, reducing stress and supporting a long component life.]]

The functional requirement of the high voltage pre-charge circuit is to minimize the peak current out from the power source by slowing down the ''dV''/''dT'' of the input power voltage such that a new “pre-charge mode” is created. Of course the inductive loads on the distribution system must be switched off during the precharge mode.  While pre-charging, the system voltage will rise slowly and controllably with power-up current never exceeding the maximum allowed.  As the circuit voltage approaches near steady state, then the pre-charge function is complete.  Normal operation of a pre-charge circuit is to terminate pre-charge mode when the circuit voltage is 90% or 95% of the operating voltage.  Upon completion of pre-charging, the pre-charge resistance is switched out of the power supply circuit and returns to a low impedance power source for normal mode.  The high voltage loads are then powered up sequentially.

The simplest inrush-current limiting system, used in many consumer electronics devices, is a [[thermistor|NTC resistor]]. When cold, its high resistance allows a small current to pre-charge the [[reservoir capacitor]]. After it warms up, its low resistance more efficiently passes the working current.

Many [[active power factor correction]] systems also include [[soft start]].

If the example circuit from before is used with a pre-charge circuit which limits the ''dV''/''dT'' to less than 600 volts per second, then the inrush current will be reduced from 670 amperes to 7 amperes.  This is a “kinder and gentler” way to activate a high voltage DC power distribution system.

== Benefits of pre-charging==

The primary benefit of avoiding component stress during power-up is to realize a long system operating life due to reliable and long lasting components.  

There are additional benefits:  pre-charging reduces the electrical hazards which may occur when the system integrity is compromised due to hardware damage or failure.  Activating the high voltage DC system into a short circuit or a ground fault or into unsuspecting personnel and their equipment can have undesired effects.  [[Arc flash]] will be minimized if a pre-charge function slows down the activation time of a high voltage power-up.  A slow pre-charge will also reduce the voltage into a faulty circuit which builds up while the system diagnostics come on-line. This allows a diagnostic shut down before the fault is fully realized in worst case proportions.

In cases where unlimited inrush current is large enough to trip the source [[circuit breaker]], a slow precharge may even be required to avoid the nuisance trip.

Pre-charging is commonly used in [[battery electric vehicle]] applications. The current to the motor is regulated by a ''controller'' that employs large capacitors in its input circuit. Such systems typically have ''contactors'' (a high-current  [[relay]]) to disable the system during inactive periods and to act as an emergency disconnect should the motor current regulator fail in an active state. Without pre-charge the high voltage across the contactors and inrush current can cause a brief [[Electric arc|arc]] which will cause pitting of the contacts. Pre-charging the controller input capacitors (typically to 90 to 95 percent of applied battery voltage) eliminates the pitting problem. The current to maintain the charge is so low that some systems apply the pre-charge at all times other than when charging batteries, while more complex systems apply pre-charge as part of the starting sequence and will defer main contactor closure until the pre-charge voltage level is detected as sufficiently high.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3272">'''Short Rotation Forestry''' (SRF) is grown as an [[energy crop]] for use in power stations, alone or in combination with other fuels such as coal. It is similar to historic [[wood fuel|fuelwood]] [[coppice]] systems.

== Species used ==
SRF is the practice of cultivating fast-growing trees that reach their economically optimum size between eight and 20 years old. Species used are selected on this basis and include [[Alder]], [[Ash tree|Ash]], Southern [[Beech]], [[Birch]], [[Eucalyptus]], [[Populus|Poplar]], [[Willow]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/popfull/ POPFULL project]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edepot.wur.nl/279837 Harvesting of Salix and Populus]&lt;/ref&gt; new varieties of [[paulownia elongata]], [[Paper mulberry]], [[Australian Blackwood]] and [[Sycamore]].

== Planting and harvesting ==
Trees are planted at widths that allow for quick growth and easy harvesting. They are usually felled when they are around 15&amp;nbsp;cm wide at chest height, this takes from 8 to 20 years. This compares with 60 years or more for standard [[forestry]] crops. When felled, SRF trees are replaced by new planting or, more usually, allowed to regenerate from the stumps as coppice. The wood chip produced by SRF is preferred in the power industry as it does not contain bark and wood and is therefore more homogenous than wood chip provided by [[short rotation coppice]]. The profit after transport is estimated to be around €15 to €30 per tonne.

== Greenhouse gas impact ==
During growth SRF will offer significant [[carbon sequestration]]. The main carbon cost is associated with haulage of the harvested trees.

== Environmental impact ==
Some species such as Eucalyptus have a high water usage, this is especially important given the changing water patterns due to climate change. There are also potential impacts on biodiversity and the effects of large scale SRF on flora and fauna are not known.

A '''soap substitute''' refers to [[detergent]]s or cleansing creams, other than [[soap]], for cleaning the [[skin]], especially removing greasy films or glandular exudates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/soap+substitute Soap substitute definition]&lt;/ref&gt; Soap contains a increasingly high amount of synthetic elements than actual ingredients intended to cleanse the skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Cosmetics/ProductsIngredients/Products/ucm115449.htm|title=Products - Soap: FAQs|last=Nutrition|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of everyday cleansing soap has correlated to several cases of topical skin problems like acne and eczema. Making the switch to soap alternatives welcomes the replacement of chemical-ridden body wash for [[eco-friendly products]]. Soap substitutes can be made from a variety of sources including plants with high saponin levels. Soap substitutes should not be confused with [[natural cleaning products]] which are cleaning agents for kitchen and house use. Plants with high saponin levels are purported to contain [[saponin]]s in sufficient quantities to produce [[Foam|lather]] (when mashed plant parts are beaten in water) and can be used either as is or in soap or shampoos.&lt;ref&gt; The Herb Book by John Lust&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GastownSteamClock.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Tourists are entertained by the Gastown steam clock in [[Vancouver]]]]
A '''steam clock''' is a [[clock]] which is fully or partially powered by a [[steam engine]]. Only a few functioning steam clocks exist, most designed and built by [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[horology|horologist]] [[Raymond Saunders (clockmaker)|Raymond Saunders]] for display in urban public spaces. Steam clocks built by Saunders are located in [[Otaru, Hokkaido|Otaru]], Japan; [[Indianapolis, Indiana|Indianapolis]], United States; and the Canadian cities of [[Vancouver]], [[Whistler, British Columbia|Whistler]] and [[Port Coquitlam, British Columbia|Port Coquitlam]], all in [[British Columbia]]. Steam clocks by other makers are installed in [[St Helier]], [[Jersey]] and at the Chelsea Farmers' Market in [[London]], England.

Although they are often styled to appear as 19th-century antiques, steam clocks are a more recent phenomenon inspired by the Gastown steam clock built by Saunders in 1977. One exception is the steam clock built in the 19th century by [[Birmingham]] engineer [[John Inshaw]] to demonstrate the versatility of steam power.

==Steam Clock Tavern==
In 1859, the engineer and businessman [[John Inshaw]] took over the [[public house]] on the corner of Morville Street and Sherborne Street in [[Ladywood]], Birmingham, UK. In a bid to make the establishment a talking point in the area, as well as furnishing it with  various working models, Inshaw applied his interest in [[steam engine|steam power]] to construct a steam-powered clock as a feature. A small boiler made steam; the steam condensed into droplets of water that fell on a plate at regular intervals, and the plate then drove the mechanism. The clock was installed above the door, and the pub became known as the Steam Clock Tavern. The establishment was sufficiently successful that it became a [[music hall]] in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Upton|first=Chris|title=John Inshaw's Steam Clock|url=http://www.search.digital-ladywood.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/sequential/default.asp?theme=&amp;originator=/engine/theme/default.asp&amp;page=1&amp;records=&amp;direction=1&amp;pointer=4659&amp;text=0&amp;resource=7666|publisher=Digital Ladywood|accessdate=17 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721040719/http://www.search.digital-ladywood.org.uk/engine/resource/exhibition/sequential/default.asp?theme=&amp;originator=%2Fengine%2Ftheme%2Fdefault.asp&amp;page=1&amp;records=&amp;direction=1&amp;pointer=4659&amp;text=0&amp;resource=7666|archivedate=21 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea Farmers' Market steam clock===

The towering and quirky steam clock located at the Chelsea Farmers' Market was constructed in 1984. Although still standing, the clock is no longer in operation.

===Jersey waterfront steamboat clock===
[[File:Steam Clock in Saint Helier.jpg|thumb|right|&lt;center&gt;Jersey Steam Clock&lt;/center&gt;]]
The Jersey steam clock is a full-scale replica of the centre section of a [[Paddle steamer|paddle steamboat]] named the ''Ariadne''. The clock was commissioned by the Jersey Waterfront Board in 1996, and built by [[Smith of Derby Group]]. Although once powered by steam, according to a Jersey government document "the steam workings have been replaced with electrical fittings designed to provide the same functionality including the blowing of 'steam' at the appropriate times of the day."

The clock is sited on the North Quay of the harbour at [[St Helier]], [[Jersey]], and also incorporates a fountain. It is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the World's largest steam clock.&lt;!--which is not difficult, considering how few have been built!--&gt;

===Berwick steam clock===
Located at Berwick, Australia, {{coord|38|1|43.74|S|145|20|53.12|E|name=Berwick steam clock}}. Designed and built by Peter Weare at his own expense, it is a half scale prototype for a larger clock proposed for Melbourne Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Foster|first=Tony|title=Berwick steam clock|url=http://tonyforster.blogspot.com/2007/11/berwick-steam-clock.html|accessdate=17 September 2010|date=8 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock was dismantled in December 2010 due to vandalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://pakenham.starcommunity.com.au/gazette/2011-09-07/clocks-time-runs-out/&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, the City Council agreed to find a new site for the clock.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.casey.vic.gov.au/council/your-council/minutes-agendas/20-december-2011?minutes City of Casey, Minutes of the Council Meeting Tuesday 20 December 2011]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Doomsday Machine: The High Price of Nuclear Energy, the World's Most Dangerous Fuel''''' is a [[2012 in literature|2012]] book by [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] and [[Andrew McKillop]] which addresses a broad range of concerns regarding the [[nuclear industry]], the economics and environmental aspects of [[nuclear power|nuclear energy]], [[nuclear power plants]], and [[nuclear accidents]]. The book has been described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "a polemic on the evils of splitting the atom".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wald|first=Matthew L. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/business/energy-environment/nuclear-powers-death-somewhat-exaggerated.html?_r=0 |title=Nuclear Power's Death Somewhat Exaggerated |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2012-04-10 |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

=== Economic fundamentals ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The usual rule of thumb for nuclear power is that about two thirds of the generation cost is accounted for by fixed costs, the main ones being the cost of paying interest on the loans and repaying the capital..."&lt;ref name=D89&gt;Doomsday 2012, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Areva]], the French nuclear plant operator, for example, offers that 70 percent of the cost of a [[Kilowatt hour|kWh]] of nuclear electricity is accounted for by the fixed costs from the construction process.&lt;ref name=D89/&gt; In the foreword to the book, [[Stephen Thomas (professor)|Steve Thomas]], Professor of Energy Studies at the [[University of Greenwich]] in the UK, states that "the economic realities of rapidly escalating costs and insurmountable financing problems... will mean that the much-hyped nuclear renaissance will one day be remembered as just another 'nuclear myth'."&lt;ref&gt;Doomsday 2012, page v&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussions about the economics of nuclear power, the authors explain, what is often not appreciated is that the cost of equity, that is, companies using their own funds to pay for new plants, is generally higher than the cost of debt. Another advantage of borrowing may be that "once large loans have been arranged at low interest rates—perhaps with government support—the money can then be lent out at higher rates of return".&lt;ref&gt;Doomsday 2012, page 199&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental platform ===
As [[Matthew Wald]] in the ''New York Times'' noted, despite being at its heart environmentalist, the book challenges certain Green orthodoxies, notably the idea that whatever the risks of nuclear energy, the threat from man-made [[climate change]] is greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=Martin |url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2012/03/doomsday-drivel-promoting-nuclear-paranoia.html |title=CultureLab: Doomsday drivel: promoting nuclear paranoia |publisher=Newscientist.com |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Chiara Proietti Silvestri wrote in a review for the Italian Energy journal ''Energia''&lt;ref&gt;Energia 2/2012, pages 78–80  http://www.rie.it/rivista/44&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Doomsday Machine'', the authors argue that the fight against pollution from CO2 generated mostly by the human activities and described as be the primary cause of rising temperatures at the global level thus becomes a "simple story" told by a club dominated from Anglophone countries in an attempt to defend and promote particular national interests. Reducing huge national subsidies to domestic coal industries and promoting the lucrative market for nuclear power stations being the case in point.&lt;ref&gt;Doomsday 2012, page 167&lt;/ref&gt;

The book describes how [[fossil fuel]]s remain the main source of energy for the world, while nuclear power manages to meet only three percent of the needs of world energy. Which leads to the question: why is the figure so low when it is often read that nuclear is a key part of the 'world energy mix'? The authors explain that the trick is in the "fiddling" of statistics, writing that the "key point about world energy is that it is almost all thermal. Whether it is created by burning coal, oil or gas, or firewood or dung, or even running nuclear power plants, the first thing produced is heat".&lt;ref&gt;Doomsday 2012, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical perspective ===
Although nuclear power is still today presented as the energy of future ("the first myth" &lt;ref&gt;Doomsday 2012, page 34. The book says: "Yet, as with most technological solutions, novelty has shielded nuclear from a clear-eyed assessment of its actual usefulness. Many people in the “old-nuclear” countries, where civil nuclear power was first developed from the 1950s and 1960s, can still recall how atomic energy was first presented to them. In schoolbooks, in speeches from leading politicians, and in the press, an impressive chorus of recommendations for ever bigger and bigger high-tech reactor projects presented nuclear power unambiguously as the energy of the future."

And a bit later: "…with a new millennium starting, nuclear power was back— suddenly reinvigorated with a surge of multibillion-dollar projects—or at least plans for them. Once again, the atom was to be the energy of the future."&lt;/ref&gt;), its roots are paradoxically in the speech "[[Atoms for Peace]]", by President Eisenhower. The authors state that this history shows that the origins of nuclear power lie with military needs, and are anything but peaceful, and that Eisenhower's speech itself was an attempt to distract the world from the tests of the US hydrogen bomb. Scientists — from [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Georges Lemaître]] to [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Robert Oppenheimer]] — come in for criticism for serving the same military strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Doomsday 2012, page 40&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of nuclear power is also marked by the slogan — "[[too cheap to meter]]" — described as the foundation of another myth. The book argues that nuclear power is not and has never been cheap but rather found the resources to tap public subsidies, special systems of taxation, loans government and other beneficial guarantees. The arrival of the liberalization&lt;ref name=D89/&gt; of the electrical market has had a strong impact on the nuclear industry, revealing the true costs (e.g. the over-run in costs on the new EPR at [[Olkiluoto]] in [[Finland]]).&lt;ref&gt;Doomsday 2012, page 73&lt;/ref&gt;

This leads to "tricks" to manipulate figures (cost projections of construction, decommissioning and insurance schemes), the extension of the life of the reactors, the reuse of the depleted fuel) in order to conceal the fundamental non-affordability.&lt;ref&gt;A
 section of the book entitled: '12 Best Tricks of nuclear economics' describes these: Doomsday 2012, pages 92-108&lt;/ref&gt;  Today,{{When|date=June 2013}} according to the authors, the nuclear lobby triumphantly describes the new order flow, especially in developing countries, where the "environment tends to remain a '[[free good]]'",&lt;ref&gt;Doomsday 2012, page 20&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a "cultural indifference to public hazard and risk" all of which, they argue, raises new concerns about the environmental protection, about technical expertise and political instability.&lt;ref&gt;Doomsday 2012, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
A central theme of the book is the issue of the true, economic, cost of nuclear electricity. The preface by professor Steve Thomas indicates the information density with which the authors construct their arguments, expressed nonetheless in witty and tight language, as the Italian ''Energia'' review put it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rie.it/rivista/44|title=Rivista Energia - Rie - Page 44|website=www.Rie.it|access-date=7 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while according to Kirukus: "The authors deliver a convincing account of the partnership between industry and government (essential because nuclear plants require massive subsidies) to build wildly expensive generators whose electricity remains uncompetitive without more subsidies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Gar |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/martin-cohen/doomsday-machine/ |title=THE DOOMSDAY MACHINE by Martin Cohen, Andrew McKillop &amp;#124; Kirkus |publisher=Kirkusreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another review, science policy writer [[Jon Turney]] stated that the "strongest suit" of the book was "energy economics and supply data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=5 July 2012 |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/the-doomsday-machine-the-high-price-of-nuclear-energy-the-worlds-most-dangerous-fuel/420444.article |title=The Doomsday Machine: The High Price of Nuclear Energy, the World's Most Dangerous Fuel &amp;#124; General |publisher=[[Times Higher Education]] |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''New York Times''' Matthew L. Wald analyzes the argument put forth in the ''Doomsday Machine'' that "even if global warming science was not explicitly invented by the nuclear lobby, the science could hardly suit the lobby better". He comments, "In fact, the [nuclear] industry continues to argue that in the United States it is by far the largest source of zero-carbon energy, and recently began a campaign of upbeat ads to improve its image." Finding the claim that "In almost every country — usually for reasons completely unrelated to its ability to deliver electricity — there is almost universal political support for nuclear power" is "probably an exaggeration" in the case of Japan post-[[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] and Germany, Wald agrees that "two countries with enormous demand for electricity and not much hand-wringing over global warming, are planning huge reactor construction projects". Wald notes that, even in Japan, the "catastrophe plays in some quarters as a reason to build new reactors".&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

[[New Scientist]]'s [[Fred Pearce]] panned the book, calling it "mendacious and frequently anti-scientific", remarking that it "combines hysterical opposition to all things nuclear with an equally deranged climate-change denialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2012/03/doomsday-drivel-promoting-nuclear-paranoia.html |title=CultureLab: Doomsday drivel: promoting nuclear paranoia |author=[[Fred Pearce]] |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |date=29 March 2012 |accessdate=2013-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Elephant’s Foot''' is an extremely radioactive mass of [[corium (nuclear reactor)|corium]] formed during the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in April 1986, and was discovered in December 1986. It is named for its wrinkly appearance, resembling the foot of an [[elephant]]. The corium mass is beneath Reactor N. 4 of the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]], in under-reactor room 217.&lt;ref name=Record&gt;{{cite book |title= Chernobyl Record: The Definitive History of the Chernobyl Catastrophe |author= R. F. Mould |publisher= CRC Press |year= 2000 |isbn= 9781420034622 |page= 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elephant's Foot is a large mass of black corium with many layers, externally resembling tree bark and glass. The mass is quite dense, unyielding to a drill but able to be damaged by a [[Kalashnikov rifle]]. By June 1998, the outer layers of the mass began to turn to dust and the entire mass was starting to crack. The mass has penetrated through at least {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} of concrete.&lt;ref name=Record/&gt;

The radiation level near the mass was approximately 8,000 [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen]]s per hour, an invariably lethal dosage of radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title= Daily Report: Soviet Union |issue= 235-239 |editor= United States Foreign Broadcast Information Service |publisher= The Service |year= 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

These grains of zircon are not elongated, suggesting a moderate crystallization rate. While [[uranium dioxide]] [[Dendrite (crystal)|dendrites]] grew quickly at high temperatures within the lava, the zircon began crystallization during slow cooling of the lava. Despite the distribution of uranium bearing particles not being uniform, the radioactivity of the mass is evenly distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Radioactivity distribution in fuel-containing materials (Chernobyl “lava”) and aerosols from the Chernobyl “Shelter” |last1= Vlasova |first1= Irina |last2= Shiryaev |first2= Andrey |last3= Ogorodnikov |first3= Boris |last4= Burakov |first4= Boris |last5= Dolgopolova |first5= Ekaterina |last6= Senin |first6= Roman |last7= Averin |first7= Alexey |last8= Zubavichus |first8= Yan |last9= Kalmykov |first9= Stepan |journal= Radiation Measurements |volume= 83 |pages= 20-25 |year= 2015 |publisher= Elsevier |doi= |url= https://doi.org/10.1016/j.radmeas.2015.06.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UK Dark Matter Collaboration''' ('''UKDMC''') (1987–2007) was an experiment to search for [[Weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs). The consortium consisted of [[astrophysicist]]s and [[particle physicist]]s from the [[United Kingdom]], who conducted experiments with the ultimate goal of detecting rare scattering events which would occur if galactic dark matter consists largely of a new heavy neutral particle.  Detectors were set up {{convert|1100|m|ft|abbr=on}} underground in a halite seam at the [[Boulby Mine]] in North Yorkshire.

==Background==
WIMPs are considered prime candidates for [[dark matter]], which accounts for approximately nine-tenths of the mass of certain [[galaxy|galaxies]], such as the [[Milky Way]]. WIMPs are predicted by several [[supersymmetric]] theories of [[particle physics]]. The [[particle detector]]s used for this experiment are placed 1100 metres below the surface of [[Yorkshire]]'s [[Boulby mine]].

==History==
UKDMC began in 1987, with principal participants from several notable institutions, including the [[Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine]], the [[Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils|CCLRC]]'s [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]], and the [[University of Sheffield]]. Funding for the programme was provided by the [[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council]] (PPARC), as well as [[Cleveland Potash Ltd.]] which operates the mine where the experiments were conducted.  The underground laboratory was officially opened on 18 April 2003, and the experiment ran until 2007 when collaborating institutions and scientists moved on to the related projects [[ZEPLIN-III]] and [[Directional Recoil Identification from Tracks|DRIFT]]-II.

== Experiments ==
UKDMC operated multiple dark matter detectors and developed techniques for WIMP searches in crystals and xenon.

In 1996 they published limits that were obtained using room temperature crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = P.F.Smith|display-authors = etal|title = Improved dark matter limits from pulse shape discrimination in a low background sodium iodide detector at the Boulby mine | date = 1996|journal = Phys.

began with EcoSystems ([[Nepal]]) in 1996, to improve living standards for rural people by creating affordable energy and transport products. VTS creates inexpensive technology by focusing creative talent on problems ignored by commercial investors because the solutions are intentionally easily copied, and the markets are distorted by conflicting cultures, governments, subsidies and real conflict.

The VTS mission is to apply simple, locally [[appropriate technology]] to problems in education, transportation, health and economic development.

VTS is the American [[non-profit]] offshoot of EcoSystems Pvt Ltd in [[Nepal]], founded by David and Haydi Sowerwine in 1996 to provide ‘energy and transport solutions’ in Nepal where they lived for 14 years. In that time EcoSystems built 38 “WireBridges” across Himalayan rivers to connect villagers with medical care, schools and trade. Since 1998 the bridges have moved an estimated 3.5 million passengers without harm.

In 2009 the Sowerwines launched a successor wirebridge builder in Kathmandu, the locally owned and operated: VillageSolutions Pvt. Ltd.

VTS won the esteemed Tech Museum Award in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;The Tech Museum Awards, The Tech Museum of Innovation [http://www.techawards.org/laureates/stories/index.php?id=052 2003 Economic Development Award Laureate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rural Education==
VillageTech Solutions is developing Looma for use in rural schools in Nepal and elsewhere.

Looma is an affordable, battery-powered audiovisual
device that brings the Internet and enhanced learning
media tools to village schools that have never seen electricity,
computers, or in some cases, even books.

Looma is a small box that contains a computer, 300 lumen
projector, interactive whiteboard, and audio system, all in one.
Looma projects an image onto a facing wall, and a simple user
interface allows teachers who are unaccustomed to computers
to navigate through screens intuitively using a handheld
wand. It comes pre-loaded with government textbooks for the
country of use and a rich set of multimedia enhancements.
Looma’s web browser allows the class to explore the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/99206742 Looma Vimeo video]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Looma prototype is being field tested in Nepal.  Enhancements such as webcam, microphone,
and dual-wand control are just a few features planned for future versions.

==Arsenic Removal from Well Water==
In 2008 David challenged a [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] engineering student team to take on a [[social change]] project. The project was a system for removing [[arsenic]] from [[groundwater]] in a geology that runs from Nepal to [[Bangladesh]]. In April 2009, the team demonstrated their prototype, inexpensive household-scale system that cuts arsenic concentrations to below the [[World Health Organization]] standard of 10 ppb and in a region where villagers’ well water often ranges beyond 200 ppb.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thayer School of Engineering]], The Cook Engineering Design Center, Project: Groundwater Arsenic Removal  {{cite web|url=http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/industry/cook/recent/energy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613151320/http://engineering.dartmouth.edu/industry/cook/recent/energy.html |archivedate=June 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Confirming the merit of their discovery, the sponsors of the Collegiate Inventors Competition ([[US Patent Office]], Inventors Hall of Fame, and Abbott Foundation) awarded the top prize for USA undergraduate innovators to the Thayer School of Engineering team in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;The Collegiate Inventors Competition, Project: Groundwater Arsenic Removal {{cite web|url=http://www.invent.org/collegiate/finalists_2009.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=January 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109082449/http://www.invent.org/Collegiate/finalists_2009.html |archivedate=January 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arsenic removal system is called SafaPani.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHAjrQ1yzyU SafaPani YouTube video]&lt;/ref&gt;

==WireBridge Project==
VTS supports the building of WireBridges in [[developing countries]].
&lt;ref&gt;David Sowerwine, Stanford Business Magazine, 2003-05 [http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0305/social_entrep.shtml Moving Goods Through Nepal's Fragile Countryside] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901182007/http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0305/social_entrep.shtml |date=September 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The WireBridge is a low-cost [[monorail]]-like aerial ‘roadway'. This [[aerial roadway]] offers all-weather transport, requires little maintenance, poses no threat to children, uses no [[fossil fuel]], provides low-skill jobs, and costs less than a good conventional bridge. The WireBridge is adapted from a business “[[best practice]]" transport system developed by the global banana industry.

At each end of a bridge stands a tall steel post. The ends of the WireBridge are at exactly the same height. A carriage, holding up to five or six people plus goods, hangs from wheels which roll on the wires suspended between the posts. Passengers and bystanders pull the carriage with a rope.

Building a bridge first requires a site survey that includes terrain, traffic levels, other crossing options, supply of local labor and maintenance.  In addition, VTS requires that there be significant and demonstrable benefits to local villages in the categories of health, education, commerce, and social integration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3647">In [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], '''volatility''' is quantified by the tendency of a substance to [[vaporize]]. Volatility is directly related to a substance's [[vapor pressure]]. At a given temperature, a substance with higher vapor pressure vaporizes more readily than a substance with a lower vapor pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bae.uky.edu/~snokes/BAE549thermo/gasesvapor.htm Gases and Vapor] ([[University of Kentucky]] website)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coop.engr.uvic.ca/engrweb/whmis/terms.html#V Definition of Terms] ([[University of Victoria]] website)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = James G. Speight| title = The Chemistry and Technology of Petroleum| url = https://books.google.com/?id=ymL2S9RWzx4C| edition = 4th| year = 2006| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8493-9067-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Kister, Henry Z.| title = Distillation Design| url = https://books.google.com/?id=0M1TAAAAMAAJ| edition = 1st| date = 1992-02-01| publisher = McGraw-hill| isbn = 978-0-07-034909-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is primarily written to be applied to liquids; however, it may be used to describe the process of [[sublimation (physics)|sublimation]] which is associated with [[solid]] substances, such as [[dry ice]] (solid [[carbon dioxide]]) and [[osmium tetroxide|osmium tetroxide (OsO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], which can change directly from the solid state to a [[vapor]], without becoming liquid.

==Relations between vapor pressure, temperature, and boiling point==
{{main|Vapor pressure}}
The vapor pressure of a substance is the [[pressure]] at which its gas phase is in equilibrium with its condensed phases (liquid or solid). It is a measure of the tendency of [[molecule]]s and [[atom]]s to escape from a liquid or a solid. A liquid's [[atmospheric pressure]] boiling point corresponds to the [[temperature]] at which its vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure and it is often called the ''normal boiling point''.

The higher the vapor pressure of a liquid at a given temperature, the higher the volatility and the lower the normal boiling point of the liquid. The vapor pressure chart (right hand side) displays the vapor pressures dependency for a variety of liquids as a function of temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Perry, R.H. and Green, D.W. (Editors)|author2=Don W. Green |author3=James O. Maloney | title = Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook| url = https://books.google.com/?id=n8B7QgAACAAJ| edition = 7th| year = 1997| publisher = McGraw-Hill| isbn = 978-0-07-049841-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, at any given temperature, [[chloromethane]] (methyl chloride) has the highest vapor pressure of any of the liquids in the chart. It also has the lowest normal boiling point (−24.2&amp;nbsp;°C), which is where the vapor pressure curve (the blue line) intersects the horizontal pressure line of one atmosphere ([[Atmosphere (unit)|atm]]) of absolute vapor pressure.

{{italic title}}
'''''Windfall''''' is a 2010 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Laura Israel]] about the reaction of residents in rural [[Meredith, New York]] (in [[Delaware County, New York]]) to a proposal to place numerous [[wind turbine]]s in their community to harness [[wind power]]. It is notable that the film was made by an interested local citizen rather than an organization.

==Summary==
The film begins in 2004, when energy companies approached several property owners in Meredith, offering cash payments to allow the long-term placement of wind turbines standing over 400 feet tall on their land. The documentary portrays Meredith residents as deeply divided over the idea. Some believe the economic and energy benefits are worth investigating. Others are concerned about the towers being an eyesore, loss of property values, or posing a variety of hazards such as collapse, accumulation of ice which is then flung from the turbines in large chunks, or health problems attributed to [[low frequency]] noise. Residents of [[Lowville, New York]] are also interviewed, expressing regret at installing wind turbines in their community.

After an often rancorous debate, the citizens vote out the current officials who were promoting wind energy, and were not amenable to enacting a protective wind ordinance. The newly elected officials in Meredith subsequently passed a citizen-friendly wind law, and the developer decided to leave the community.

The film is composed mostly of interviews with Meredith residents. Also included are excerpts of news broadcasts, films of town council meetings, and computer-animated segments.

==Reactions==
[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing that the film "left me disheartened. I thought wind energy was something I could believe in. This film suggests it's just another corporate flim-flam game." He notes that there is doubtless a legion of wind-power activists and lobbyists who would counter-argue the points made in ''Windfall'', but asks "How many of them live on wind farms?"&lt;ref&gt;http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20120201/REVIEWS/120209994&lt;/ref&gt; In a review for the ''New York Times'', Andy Webster writes that Israel's film tends to "overheat" but raises important questions:  "The quest for energy independence comes with caveats. Developers’ motives must be weighed, as should the risks Americans are willing to take in their own backyard."&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/movies/windfall-a-documentary-on-wind-turbines-by-laura-israel.html Turbines in the Backyard: The Sound and the Strobes], New York Times, February 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
