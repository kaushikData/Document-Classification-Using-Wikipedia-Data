      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1906">An '''acoustic interferometer''' is an instrument, using [[interferometry]], for measuring the physical characteristics of [[sound]] [[wave]]s in a [[gas]] or [[liquid]]. It may be used to measure [[velocity]], [[wavelength]], [[absorption (acoustics)|absorption]], or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]]. A vibrating [[crystal]] creates the ultrasonic waves that are radiated into the medium. The waves strike a reflector placed  parallel to the crystal. The waves are then reflected back to the source and measured.

'''''Akkermansia glycanphila''''' is a species of intestinal [[mucin]]-degrading bacterium. It was first isolated from reticulated python (''[[Malayopython reticulatus]]'') feces in 2016.&lt;ref name="Ouwerkerk2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ouwerkerk |first1=Janneke P. |last2=Aalvink |first2=Steven |last3=Belzer |first3=Clara |last4=de Vos |first4=Willem M. |title=''Akkermansia glycaniphila'' sp. nov., an anaerobic mucin-degrading bacterium isolated from reticulated python faeces |journal=International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology |date=1 November 2016 |volume=66 |issue=11 |pages=4614–4620 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Etymology==
The genus was named for Antoon DL Akkermans (1940–2006), a Dutch microbiologist recognized for his contribution to microbial ecology, and the epithet from the New Latin and Greek meaning "glycan-loving".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Euzéby |first1=JP |title=List of Bacterial Names with Standing in Nomenclature: a folder available on the Internet. |journal=International journal of systematic bacteriology |date=April 1997 |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=590-2 |doi=10.1099/00207713-47-2-590 |pmid=9103655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology and biochemistry==
''A. glycaniphila'', like, ''A. muciniphilia'' is [[Gram-negative]], strictly [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]], non-[[motile]], non-[[spore]]-forming, oval-shaped bacterium. The typestrain is Pyt&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; (=DSM100705&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;=CIP 110913&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;). ''A. glycaniphila'' is able to use [[mucin]] as its sole source of carbon and nitrogen. It is culturable under the same conditions as ''A. muciniphilia'', (anaerobic conditions on medium containing gastric mucin). When grown on soft agar mucin medium, colonies appear white with a diameter of 0.7mm. The long axis of single cells is 0.6–1.0 μm. Cells are covered with filaments, and occur singly, in pairs, in short chains and in aggregates.&lt;ref name="Ouwerkerk2016"/&gt;

The [[bacterial genome]] of ''A. glucaniphila'' Pyt&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is encoded on a single chromosome of 3,074,121 bp. The G+C content is 57.6% and contains 2,532 [[coding region|coding regions]], all 21 [[tRNA]] genes, and three complete [[rRNA]] [[operons]]. For 72% (1,811) of the coding sequences, a function could be predicted. Genome analysis revealed the presence of many mucin-degrading enzymes, of which a number are predicted to be secreted: 54 [[glycoside hydrolases]], one [[glycosyl hydrolase]], seven [[sialidases]], and three [[sulfatases]]. The Pyt&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; genome is predicted to encode a [[Ubiquinol oxidase (H+-transporting)|cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase]], indicating the potential for [[aerobic respiration]].&lt;ref name="Ouwerkerk2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ouwerkerk |first1=Janneke P. |last2=Koehorst |first2=Jasper J. |last3=Schaap |first3=Peter J. |last4=Ritari |first4=Jarmo |last5=Paulin |first5=Lars |last6=Belzer |first6=Clara |last7=de Vos |first7=Willem M. |title=Complete Genome Sequence of Strain Pyt , a Mucin-Degrading Specialist of the Reticulated Python Gut |journal=Genome Announcements |date=5 January 2017 |volume=5 |issue=1 |doi=10.1128/genomeA.01098-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
This bacterium probably inhabits oxic-anoxic interface of the intestinal mucin layer.&lt;ref name="Ouwerkerk2017"/&gt; This was demonstrated for ''A. muciniphila'' Muc&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ouwerkerk |first1=Janneke P. |last2=van der Ark |first2=Kees C.

16s rRNA gene amplicon sequencing reveals that the genus ''Akkermansia'' have been detected in animals with a wide variety of GI tract anatomy (foregut, hindgut, or simple) and in diet (from herbivores to omnivores and carnivores). It has been found in mammals both wild and domesticated, and in non-mammals like birds, fish and reptiles like the Burmese python.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Costello |first1=Elizabeth K |last2=Gordon |first2=Jeffrey I |last3=Secor |first3=Stephen M |last4=Knight |first4=Rob |title=Postprandial remodeling of the gut microbiota in Burmese pythons |journal=The ISME Journal |date=3 June 2010 |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=1375–1385 |doi=10.1038/ismej.2010.71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mucin types, and the glycan types expressed, vary between these organisms, but mucus a consistent feature of their intestinal tracts/&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johansson |first1=Malin E.

'''Alchemy and chemistry in Islam''' refers to the study of both traditional [[alchemy]] and early practical [[chemistry]] (the early chemical investigation of nature in general) by [[Science in medieval Islam|scholars in]] the medieval [[Islamic world]]. The word ''alchemy'' was derived from the [[Arabic]] word كيمياء or ''kīmiyāʾ''.&lt;ref&gt;"alchemy", entry in ''The Oxford English Dictionary'', J. A. Simpson and E. S. C. Weiner, vol. 1, 2nd ed., 1989, {{ISBN|0-19-861213-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=anawati854&gt;p. 854, "Arabic alchemy", Georges C. Anawati, pp. 853-885 in '' Encyclopedia of the history of Arabic science'', eds. Roshdi Rashed and Régis Morelon, London: Routledge, 1996, vol. 3, {{ISBN|0-415-12412-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chemistry (etymology)|may ultimately derive]] from the ancient Egyptian word ''kemi'', meaning black.&lt;ref name=anawati854 /&gt;

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the focus of alchemical development moved to the [[Caliphate]] and the [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic civilization]]. Much more is known about [[Islam]]ic alchemy as it was better documented; most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as Arabic translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title = Alchemy: science of the cosmos, science of the soul|author-link = Titus Burckhardt|first =Titus|last = Burckhardt|year = 1967|publisher = Stuart &amp; Watkins|page = 46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and relationship with medieval western sciences==
In considering Islamic sciences as a distinct, local practice, it is important to define words such as "Arabic," "Islamic," "alchemy," and "chemistry." In order to gain a better grasp on the concepts discussed in this article, it is important to come to an understanding of what these terms mean historically. This may also help to clear up any misconceptions regarding the possible differences between alchemy and early chemistry in the context of medieval times. As A.I. Sabra writes in his article entitled, "Situating Arabic Science: Location versus Essence," "the term Arabic (or Islamic) science denotes the scientific activities of individuals who lived in a region that roughly extended chronologically from the eighth century A.D. to the beginning of the modern era, and geographically from the Iberian Peninsula and [[North Africa]] to the [[Indus]] valley and from [[southern Arabia]] to the [[Caspian Sea]] - that is, the region covered for most of that period by what we call Islamic civilization, and in which the results of the activities referred to were for the most part expressed in the Arabic language."&lt;ref&gt;Sabra 1996, P. 655&lt;/ref&gt; This definition of Arabic science provides a sense that there are many distinguishing factors to contrast with science of the Western hemisphere regarding physical location, culture, and language, though there are also several similarities in the goals pursued by scientists of the Middle Ages, and in the origins of thinking from which both were derived.

[[Lawrence Principe]] describes the relationship between alchemy and chemistry in his article entitled, "Alchemy Restored," in which he states, "The search for metallic transmutation — what we call "alchemy" but that is more accurately termed "Chrysopoeia" — was ordinarily viewed in the late seventeenth century as synonymous with or as a subset of chemistry." &lt;ref name="Principe 2011, P. 306"&gt;Principe 2011, P. 306&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore proposes that the early spelling of chemistry as "chymistry" refers to a unified science including both alchemy and early chemistry. Principe goes on to argue that, "[a]ll their chymical activities were unified by a common focus on the analysis, synthesis, transformation, and production of material substances."&lt;ref name="Principe 2011, P. 306"/&gt; Therefore, there is not a defined contrast between the two fields until the early [[18th century]].&lt;ref name="Principe 2011, P. 306"/&gt; Though Principe's discussion is centered on the Western practice of alchemy and chemistry, this argument is supported in the context of Islamic science as well when considering the similarity in methodology and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] inspirations, as noted in other sections of this article. This distinction between alchemy and early chemistry is one that lies predominately in semantics, though with an understanding of previous uses of the words, we can better understand the historical lack of distinct connotations regarding the terms despite their altered connotations in modern contexts.

The transmission of these sciences throughout the Eastern and Western hemispheres is also important to understand when distinguishing the sciences of both regions. The beginnings of cultural, religious, and scientific diffusion of information between the Western and Eastern societies began with the successful conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] (334-323 B.C). By establishing territory throughout the East, Alexander the Great allowed greater communication between the two hemispheres that would continue throughout history. A thousand years later, those Asian territories conquered by Alexander the Great, such as [[Iraq]] and [[Iran]], became a center of religious movements with a focus on [[Christianity]], [[Manicheism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]], which all involve sacred texts as a basis, thus encouraging literacy, scholarship, and the spread of ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg 2007, P. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotelian logic was soon included in the curriculum a center for higher education in [[Nisibis]], located east of the Persian border, and was used to enhance the philosophical discussion of theology taking place at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg 2007, P. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qur'an]], the holy book of Islam, became an important source of "theology, morality, law, and cosmology," in what Lindberg describes as "the centerpiece of Islamic education." After the death of Muhammed in 632, Islam was extended throughout the Arabian peninsula, Byzantium, Persia, Syria, Egypt, and Israel by means of military conquest, solidifying the region as a predominately Muslim one.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg 2007, P. 166&lt;/ref&gt; While the expansion of the Islamic empire was an important factor in diminishing political barriers between such areas, there was still a wide range of religions, beliefs, and philosophies that could move freely and be translated throughout the regions. This development made way for contributions to be made on behalf of the East towards the Western conception of sciences such as alchemy.

While this transmission of information and practices allowed for the further development of the field, and though both were inspired by Aristotelian logic and [[Hellenic philosophy and Christianity|Hellenic philosophies]], as well as by mystical aspects&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Louise von Franz (CALA IA) 2006, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; it is also important to note that cultural and religious boundaries remained. The mystical and religious elements discussed previously in the article distinguished Islamic alchemy from that of its Western counterpart, given that the West had predominately Christian ideals on which to base their beliefs and results, while the Islamic tradition differed greatly. While the motives differed in some ways, as did the calculations, the practice and development of alchemy and chemistry was similar given the contemporaneous nature of the fields and the ability with which scientists could transmit their beliefs.

===Contributions of Islamic alchemists to mystical alchemy===
''Marie-Louise von Franz'' describes in her introduction to [[Ibn Umail]]s "Book of the Explanation of the Symbols — Kitāb Ḥall ar-Rumūz" the contributions of Islamic alchemy as follows: In the [[7th century|7th]] to [[8th century]], Islamic scholars were mainly concerned with translating ancient [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]]-[[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] texts without changing them. Gradually they began "'confronting' their content with the Islamic religion" and began "to think independently and experiment themselves in the realm of alchemy". Thus they added "an emphasis on the monotheistic outlook" (tawḥīd) and more and more creating a synopsis of the diverse antique traditions. Thus unifying their meaning, the Islamic scholars arrived at the idea, that the secret and aim of alchemy were the achievement of "''one'' inner psychic experience, namely the God-image" and that stone, water, prima materia etc. were "all aspects of the inner mystery through which the alchemist unites with the transendent God". Secondly, they added "a passionate feeling tone" by using much more a poetic language than the antique Hermetists did, also giving "a greater emphasis on the coniunctio motif", i.e. images of the union of male and female, sun and moon, king and queen etc.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Louise von Franz (CALA IA) 2006, p. 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; "The mystical masters of Islam understood alchemy as a transformative process of the alchemist's psyche. The fire which promoted this transformation was the love of God."&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Louise von Franz (CALA IA) 2006, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alchemists and works==
===Khālid ibn Yazīd===
According to the bibliographer [[Ibn al-Nadīm]], the first Muslim alchemist was [[Khālid ibn Yazīd]], who is said to have studied alchemy under the Christian Marianos of [[Alexandria]].  The historicity of this story is not clear; according to M. Ullmann, it is a legend.&lt;ref name=holmyard63-66&gt;pp. 63-66, ''Alchemy'', E. J.

===Jābir ibn Ḥayyān===
[[File:Jabir ibn Hayyan.jpg|150px|thumb|right|15th century European impression of "Geber"]]
[[Jābir ibn Ḥayyān]] ({{lang-fa|جابرحیان}}, Arabic: جابر بن حیان, Latin Geberus; usually rendered in English as Geber) may have been born in 721 or 722, in Persian city of [[Tus, Iran]], and have been the son of Ḥayyān, a druggist from the tribe of [[al-Azd]] who originally lived in [[Kufa]]. When young Jābir studied in [[Arabian peninsula|Arabia]] under [[Harbi al-Himyari|Ḥarbī al-Ḥimyarī]].  Later, he lived in Kufa, and eventually became a court alchemist for [[Hārūn al-Rashīd]], in [[Baghdad]]. Jābir was friendly with the [[Barmecides]] and became caught up in their disgrace in 803. As a result, he returned to Kufa.  According to some sources, he died in Tus in 815.

A large corpus of works is ascribed to Jābir, so large that it's difficult to believe he wrote them all himself.  According to the theory of Paul Kraus, many of these works should be ascribed to later [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] authors.  It includes the following groups of works: ''The One Hundred and Twelve Books''; ''The Seventy Books''; ''The Ten Books of Rectifications''; and ''The Books of the Balances''.  This article will not distinguish between Jābir and the authors of works attributed to him.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 68-82, Holmyard 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abū Bakr al-Rāzī===
[[Abū Bakr al-Rāzī|Abū Bakr ibn Zakariyā’ al-Rāzī]] (Latin: Rhazes), born around 864 in [[Rey, Iran|Rayy]], was mainly known as a Persian physician.  He wrote a number of alchemical works, including the ''Sirr al-asrār'' (Latin: ''Secretum secretorum;'' English: ''Secret of Secrets''.)&lt;ref&gt;pp. 867-879, Anawati 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;pp. 86-92, Holmyard 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ibn Umayl===
[[Muhammed ibn Umail al-Tamimi|Muḥammad ibn Umayl al-Tamīmī]] was a 10th-century alchemist of the symbolic-mystical branch.  One of his surviving works is ''Kitāb al-māʿ al-waraqī wa-l-arḍ al-najmiyya'' (''The Book on Silvery Water and Starry Earth'').  This work is a commentary on his poem, the ''Risālat al-shams ilā al-hilāl'' (''The Epistle of the Sun to the Crescent Moon'') and contains numerous quotations from ancient authors.&lt;ref&gt;pp. 870-872, Anawati 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Umayl had important influence on [[Alchemy#Medieval Europe|medieval Western (Latin) alchemy]],&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Louise von Franz (CALA IA) 2006, chapter: "Life and Work of Muḥammad ibn Umail", p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; where his work is found under different names, mainly as Senior or as Zadith.&lt;ref&gt;Julius Ruska, "Senior Zadith = Ibn Umail." ''Orientalistische Literaturzeitung 31,'' 1928, pp. 665-666&lt;/ref&gt; His "Silvery Water" e.g. was reprinted as "The Chemical Tables of Senior Zadith" in the collection of alchemical texts: [[Theatrum Chemicum]], and commented upon by Pseudo Aquinas in [[Aurora Consurgens]]. They both also give his (modified) image of the sage holding a chemical table (see image above).&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Abt: "The Transmission of Ibn Umail's Vision to the Occident" in: ''Book of the Explanation of the Symbols - Kitāb Hall ar-Rumūz by Muhammad ibn Umail.

===Al-Tughrai===
[[Al-Tughrai]] was an 11th–12th century [[Persian people|Persian]] [[physician]].&lt;ref name="Khadem"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1021/ed072p774| volume = 72| issue = 9| pages = 774| last = El Khadem| first = H.

===Al-Jildaki===
[[Al-Jildaki]] who was a [[Persian people|Persian]] alchemist urged in his book the need for [[experiment]]al chemistry and mentioned many experiments ''Kanz al-ikhtisas fi ma'rifat al-khawas by Abu 'l-Qasim Aydamir al-Jildaki''.

Jābir analyzed each [[Classical element|Aristotelian element]] in terms of [[Aristotle]]'s four basic qualities of ''hotness'', ''coldness'', ''dryness'', and ''moistness''.  For example, fire is a substance that is hot and dry, as shown in the table.&lt;ref name=holmyard74-82 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holmyard 1990, pp. 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''On Generation and Corruption'', II.3, 330a-330b.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Jābir, in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was externally cold and dry but internally hot and moist; gold, on the other hand, was externally hot and moist but internally cold and dry.  He believed that metals were formed in the Earth by fusion of [[sulfur]] (giving the hot and dry qualities) with [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (giving the cold and moist.)  These elements, mercury and sulfur, should be thought of as not the ordinary elements but ideal, hypothetical substances.  Which metal is formed depends on the purity of the mercury and sulfur and the proportion in which they come together.&lt;ref name=holmyard74-82 /&gt;   The later alchemist [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|al-Rāzī]] followed Jābir's mercury-sulfur theory, but added a third, salty, component.&lt;ref&gt;Holmyard 1990, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Jābir theorized, by rearranging the qualities of one metal, a different metal would result.&lt;ref name="Burckhardt_p29"&gt;{{Cite document|title = Alchemy: science of the cosmos, science of the soul|first =Titus|last = Burckhardt|year = 1967|publisher = Stuart &amp; Watkins|page = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this reasoning, the search for the [[philosopher's stone]] was introduced to Western alchemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Philosopher's Stone: Alchemy and Chemistry|first=Jehane|last=Ragai|journal=Journal of Comparative Poetics|volume=12|issue=Metaphor and Allegory in the Middle Ages|year=1992|pages=58–77|doi=10.2307/521636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Maslama al-Majriti and the Rutbatu'l-Hakim|first=E.

==Processes and equipment==
Al-Rāzī mentions the following chemical processes:  [[distillation]], [[calcination]], [[solution]], [[evaporation]], [[crystallization]], [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimation]], [[filtration]], [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgamation]], and [[ceration]] (a process for making solids pasty or fusible.)&lt;ref&gt;p. 89, Holmyard 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these operations (calcination, solution, filtration, crystallization, sublimation and distillation) are also known to have been practiced by pre-Islamic Alexandrian alchemists.&lt;ref&gt;p. 23, ''A short history of chemistry'', James Riddick Partington, 3rd ed., Courier Dover Publications, 1989, {{ISBN|0-486-65977-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Secretum secretorum'', Al-Rāzī mentions the following equipment:&lt;ref&gt;Anawati 1996, p. 868&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tools for melting substances (''li-tadhwīb''): [[hearth]] (''kūr''), [[bellows]] (''minfākh'' or ''ziqq''), [[crucible]] (''bawtaqa''), the ''būt bar būt'' (in Arabic, from Persian) or ''botus barbatus'' (in Latin), [[ladle (foundry)|ladle]] (''mighrafa'' or ''milʿaqa''), [[tongs]] (''māsik'' or ''kalbatān''), [[scissors]] (''miqṭaʿ''), [[hammer]] (''mukassir''), [[File (tool)|file]] (''mibrad'').
* Tools for the preparation of drugs (''li-tadbīr al-ʿaqāqīr''): cucurbit and still with evacuation tube (''qarʿ'' or ''anbīq dhū khatm''), receiving matras (''qābila''), blind still (without evacuation tube) (''al-anbīq al-aʿmā''), [[aludel]] (''al-uthāl''), [[goblet]]s (''qadaḥ''), [[Laboratory flask|flask]]s (''qārūra'', plural ''quwārīr''), [[rosewater]] flasks (''mā’ wardiyya''), [[cauldron]] (''marjal'' or ''tanjīr''), [[earthenware]] pots varnished on the inside with their lids (''qudūr'' and ''makabbāt''), [[Laboratory water bath|water bath]] or [[sand bath]] (''qidr''), oven (''al-tannūr'' in Arabic, ''athanor'' in Latin), small cylindirical oven for heating [[aludel]] (''mustawqid''), [[funnel]]s, [[sieve]]s, [[Filter (chemistry)|filter]]s, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2866">'''Antitaenite''' is a [[Meteorite|meteoritic]] metal [[alloy]] [[mineral]] composed of [[iron]] and [[nickel]], 20–40% Ni (and traces of other [[chemical element|elements]]) that has a face centered cubic [[crystal structure]].

Its existence as a new mineral species occurring in both iron [[meteorites]] and in [[chondrite]]s was first recognized in 1995&lt;ref&gt;D.G. Rancourt and R.B. Scorzelli.  Low Spin γ-Fe-Ni (γLS) Proposed as a New Mineral in Fe-Ni-Bearing Meteorites: Epitaxial Intergrowth of γLS and Tetrataenite as Possible Equilibrium State at ~20-40 at % Ni.  ''Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials'' 150 (1995) 30-36&lt;/ref&gt; but the [[International Mineralogical Association|IMA]] didn't approve paramagnetic antitaenite (a variety of taenite now). Gamma (fcc) Fe-Ni alloys with low-Ni (c. 25% Ni) are probably inhomogeneous on a nanometer scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis |type= |title=Mössbauer Spectroscopy of Meteoritic and Synthetic Fe-Ni Alloys |url=http://www.dissertations.se/dissertation/21b198bf31/ |author=Yassir Ahmed Mohamed Abdu |year=2004 |publisher=University of Uppsala |accessdate= 4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three other known Fe-Ni meteoritic minerals: [[kamacite]], [[taenite]], and [[tetrataenite]].

The pair of minerals antitaenite and taenite constitute the first example in nature of two minerals that have the same crystal structure (face centered cubic) and can have the same chemical composition (same proportions of Fe and Ni)—but differ in their electronic structures:  taenite has a high magnetic moment whereas antitaenite has a low magnetic moment.

This unique difference in electronic structure was first established in 1999&lt;ref&gt;D.G. Rancourt, K. Lagarec, A. Densmore, R.A. Dunlap, J.I. Goldstein, R.J. Reisener, and R.B. Scorzelli.  Experimental Proof of the Distinct Electronic Structure of a New Meteoritic Fe-Ni Alloy Phase.   ''Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials''  191 (1999) L255-L260&lt;/ref&gt; and arises from a high-magnetic-moment to low-magnetic-moment transition occurring in the Fe-Ni bi-metallic alloy series.&lt;ref&gt;K. Lagarec, D.G. Rancourt, S.K. Bose, B. Sanyal, and R.A. Dunlap.  Observation of a composition-controlled high-moment/low-moment transition in the face centered cubic Fe-Ni system:  Invar effect is an expansion, not a contraction.  ''Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials'' 236 (2001) 107-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  The same electronic structure transition is believed to be a causal factor in [[Invar]] behaviour.

'''''Artificial Minds''''' is a book written by [[Stan Franklin]] and published in 1995 by [[MIT Press]].

The book is a wide-ranging tour of the development of [[artificial intelligence]] as of the time it was written. As well as discussing the theoretical and philosophical backgrounds of many approaches, it goes into some detail in explaining the workings of many of what the author considers to be the most promising examples of the era.

[[File:ASTC logo.jpg|thumb|200px]]
The '''Association of Science-Technology Centers''' ('''ASTC''') is a non-profit, global organization based in [[Washington, D.C.]], United States that provides a collective voice, professional support, and programming opportunities for [[Science museum#Science_center|science centers]], [[museums]], and related institutions. Through strategic alliances and global partnerships, ASTC's goal is to increase awareness of the valuable contributions its members make to their communities and the field of informal STEM learning.

Founded in 1973, ASTC now represents approximately 650 members in nearly 50 countries, including not only science centers and museums, but also [[nature centers]], [[aquariums]], [[planetarium]]s, [[zoos]], [[botanical gardens]], and [[natural history museum|natural history]] and children’s museums, as well as companies, consultants, and other organizations that share an interest in [[science education|informal science education]].

==Purpose==
Science centers connect people with science, give science a presence in the community and offer people of all ages and backgrounds the opportunity to ask questions, discuss, and explore.

Science centers provide firsthand experience and an opportunity to develop intuitions about the natural world. In science centers, hands-on activities may include things such as feeling infrared radiation and experiencing angular momentum—so when they encounter these concepts in other settings, they’ll be likelier to understand. Many schools rely on science centers for memorable field trips and auditorium programs, hands-on curriculum, science kits, and teacher training.

Science centers also encourage curiosity. In the words of [[Frank Oppenheimer]], founder of San Francisco's [[Exploratorium]], “No one flunks a museum.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Something Incredibly Wonderful Happens: Frank Oppenheimer and His Astonishing Exploratorium |year= 2012|publisher= University of Chicago Press| isbn=9780226113470|pages=104–105|author=K. C. Cole|authorlink = K.C. Cole }}&lt;!--|accessdate=18 August 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  For some, the interests awakened by science center experiences have turned into a passion for science, and the beginning of a lifetime devoted to teaching or research.

ASTC’s goal is to support these efforts of science centers and museums, in addition to their staff, visitors, and communities.

==Passport Program==
Some ASTC member institutions also participate in ASTC’s Passport Program. The Passport Program allows members of a participating institution to visit other participating institutions for free, provided the member is visiting an institution more than 90 miles from their home institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.fi.edu/join/membership/membership_astc.php |title=ASTC: Association of Science Technology Centers |publisher=[[Franklin Institute]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630061048/http://www2.fi.edu/join/membership/membership_astc.php |archivedate=2012-06-30 |accessdate=2014-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 300 institutions in over a dozen countries are currently participating in the Passport Program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astc.org/members/passlist_about.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual Conference==
Each year, nearly 2,000 individuals representing science centers and museums from across the world, informal science educators, and companies collaborating with the museum field gather for ASTC’s Annual Conference.

==Professional development==
ASTC provides professional development opportunities for those who work in science centers and other institutions of informal learning. ASTC’s professional development services include:

===Communities of Practice===
Communities of Practice (CoP) provide informal science education professionals the infrastructure they need to meet the field's challenges from the ground up. ASTC provides CoPs with resources and support for connecting with colleagues, convening meetings, and organizing workshops, among other activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astc.org/profdev/communities/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The current CoPs include:
* Public Engagement with Science
* Research &amp; Evaluation 
* Visitor Services
* Volunteer Managers on LinkedIn
* Youth Programs Advocates for Diversity
* ASTC Development Professionals LinkedIn Group
* ASTC Information Technology LinkedIn Group
* ASTC Membership Managers LinkedIn Group
* Network for Leaders of Interpreters, Facilitators and Explainers (NetLIFE)
* Afterschool Programs
* Intersection of Technology, Art, Science, and Culture (TASC)
Coming Soon: Museum Screens

===Exhibition Services===
Since 1974, ASTC Exhibition Services has supported excellence and innovation in science exhibitions through collaborations with science centers and other organizations worldwide. They work with partners to support sharing of knowledge and experience, and assist with planning, marketing, and management of traveling exhibitions.

===ASTC Connect===
ASTC Connect is a learning and resource-sharing area for the informal science education community. Discussion forums, online workshops, and self-paced tutorials are hosted in collaboration with partners from throughout the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://connect.astc.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships and programs==

===Learning Labs===
The [[Nichole Pinkard#YOUmedia|YOUmedia]] Network is a group of libraries, museums and community-based organizations that invite young people to create, learn, and build skills with traditional and 21st century digital tools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youmedia.org/&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 24 Learning Lab sites operating across the country with programs that are driven by youth interests and connect learning directly back to school, careers, and other realms.

===Youth Inspired Challenge===
The Youth Inspired Challenge is a 3-year initiative designed to expand the impact of science centers and museums to assist the youth around the world to become the innovative and creative thinkers needed for the 21st century workforce. This program was inspired by President Obama and other world leaders’ commitment to strengthening the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics knowledge of today’s youth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2010/09/16/president-obama-announce-major-expansion-educate-innovate-campaign-impro&lt;/ref&gt; To date, more than 100 science centers have joined the challenge.&lt;ref&gt;http://youthinspiredchallenge.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Girls RISEnet===
Girls RISEnet, a partnership between the [[Miami Science Museum]], the Association of Science-Technology Centers, and [[SECME|SECME, Inc.]], is strengthening the professional capacity of informal science educators to engage and motivate minority girls in grades 6-12 to explore and pursue science and engineering careers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.girlsrisenet.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

===ExhibitFiles===
ExhibitFiles is an online community of exhibit practitioners building a shared collection of exhibition records and reviews. It's a place to connect with colleagues, find out about exhibits, and share your own experiences. ExhibitFiles was developed to preserve and share experiences and materials that are often unrecorded, temporary, and hard to locate. Visitors to the site can also search for, and post exhibitions rentals and sales.&lt;ref&gt;http://exhibitfiles.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intersections===
ASTC and the [[National Writing Project]] (NWP) received a grant from the [[National Science Foundation]] to design a program that will integrate science and literacy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astc.org/blog/2012/10/09/nwp-and-astc-receive-nsf-grant-to-develop-integrated-science-and-literacy-program/&lt;/ref&gt; Through this program, ten partnerships will be created between NWP sites and ASTC-member science centers and museums to develop innovative programs for educators and youth.

==''Dimensions''==
ASTC publishes a bimonthly magazine titled ''Dimensions''. The magazine features in-depth analysis of news and trends in the science center and museum field, in addition to articles about noteworthy events and resources. ''Dimensions'' readers include directors and staff of ASTC-member institutions around the world, as well as those with an interest in informal science education.

==Legislative Action Center==

{{For|the '''bispectral analysis''' [[speckle imaging]] method|speckle masking}}
'''Bispectral analysis''' describes observations made at two wavelengths. It is often used by scientists to analyze elemental make up of a planetary atmosphere by analyzing the amount of light reflected and received through various color [[filter (optics)|filter]]s. By combining and removing two filters, much can be gleaned from only two filters. Through modern computerized [[interpolation]], a third virtual filter can be created to recreate [[False-color|true color]] photographs that, while not particularly useful for scientific analysis, are popular for public display in textbooks and fund raising campaigns.

The [[bispectrum]] is a statistic used to search for evidence of
nonlinear interactions in signals. 

A form of bispectral analysis called the [[bispectral index]]
is applied to [[EEG]] waveforms to monitor depth of anaesthesia.

Baron '''Clas Alströmer''' (9 August 1736 – 5 March 1794) was a Swedish naturalist who was a student of [[Carl Linnaeus]] at [[Uppsala University]]. From 1760 to 1764 he traveled throughout Southern Europe, collecting plants for Linnaeus. He established a botanical garden and natural museum near [[Gothenburg]] which was managed by the notable botanist [[Anders Dahl]], another student of Linnaeus. Alströmer was the son of the industrialist [[Jonas Alströmer]]. The [[genus]] ''[[Alstroemeria]]'' was named after him by Linnaeus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kungl.

In [[astronomy]], '''dropout''' is a [[radiation]] source whose radiation intensity falls off sharply below a specific [[wavelength]]. The source will be easily visible when its light is filtered to wavelengths longer than the cutoff value, but will "drop out" of the image when it is filtered to wavelengths shorter than the threshold.

This is a standard method for locating distant galaxies in [[Hubble Deep Field|deep field images]]. Because the [[hydrogen]] that surrounds the galaxies absorbs light with a wavelength around 100 nanometers, the galaxies have a natural dropout threshold. The exact wavelength of this threshold is [[redshift]]ed and can be used to determine the distance to the galaxy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5830">An '''electronic submission''' refers to a [[manuscript]] submitted by electronic means: that is, via [[Email|e-mail]] or a [[web form]] on the [[Internet]], or on an electronic medium such as a [[compact disc]], a [[hard disk]] or a [[USB flash drive]].&lt;ref name="ElectronicSubmissionDefinition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scribendi.com/advice/glossary.en.html|title=The definition for 'Electronic Submission'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, a manuscript referred to anything that was explicitly "written by hand". However, in popular usage and especially in the context of computers and the Internet, the term "manuscript" may even refer to documents (text or otherwise) typed out or prepared on [[typewriter]]s and computers and can be extended to digital photographs and videos, and online surveys too. In other words, any manuscript prepared and submitted online can be considered to be an electronic submission.

==History and early usage==
There is no concrete data indicating when and by whom were electronic submissions used for the first time. However, research based universities in several countries have been encouraging the collection of course assignments and projects in the form of electronic submissions for almost a decade now.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Several governments and organizations are also switching to electronic submissions for the collection of [[Academic paper|research paper]]s, [[grant application]]s and government application forms. {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Types of electronic submissions==
Since modern computers can store and process information and data in virtually any format and with the Internet allowing easy transfer of this data, the number of scenarios in which submissions can be collected electronically has increased exponentially in the last few years. Some of these scenarios are described below. In most of these scenarios, submissions were collected on hard paper until the [[Information Technology]] revolution occurred.

===Academic Submissions===
Teachers, professors and teaching assistants often collect course assignments and projects electronically. Electronic submissions are usually collected using a web-based system which more often than not also helps in the [[Submission management|management of submissions]] collected and stored on it.

===Research Papers===
In call-for-paper or [[academic conference]]s, prospective presenters are usually asked to submit a short abstract or a full paper on their presentation or research work electronically, which is reviewed before being accepted for the conference.

===Proposals for Grants===
Several grant-giving organizations like the [[NSA]], [[W3C]], [[National Intelligence Agency (United States)|NIA]], [[NIH]] etc. require grant seekers to submit a proposal which if accepted result in the desired grants. A majority of these proposals are now submitted electronically on systems that also help in the managing and tracking the proposals submitted.

===Articles for Publication===
Magazines, newspapers and other publishing houses have begun accepting electronic submissions for articles from various sources - both internal (by journalists and writers hired by them) as well as external (by users and popular readers). The submitted articles are stored on a server hosted by the publication house or by a third-party vendor and are usually evaluated before being given a green signal.

===Contests and Competition Entries===
Almost every kind of [[Competition|contest]] or competition requires participants to submit an entry in a format described by the organizers of the contest. If the contest is an Internet-based one, then the entries or nominations for the contest are collected electronically using e-mail or other electronic means depending on feasibility and the choice of the organizers.

===Government Applications===
The governments of several countries are turning to electronic submission of applications and forms for various government procedures. Electronic submissions allow easier [[Submission management|management]] of the applications and forms submitted.

===Resumés and CVs===
It has become commonplace for job-seekers to submit soft copies (electronic versions) of their resumès and CVs to recruiting agencies and [[employment website|online job portals]]. This is usually done over the Internet using e-mail or a pre-hosted web-based system.

==Submission management systems==
The art and science of collecting and managing electronic submissions is called [[Submission management|Submission Management]]. Certain software vendors have begun developing [[submission management system]]s to assist in the collection, tracking and management of complex submission processes realized electronically. Most of these systems are web based and accessible from any device with a browser and an Internet connection. However, a majority of these systems are application specific and cannot be applied to all submission management scenarios.

==Resistance to electronic submissions==
Despite the easier management and tracking of electronic submissions compared to their paper-based counterparts, widespread adoption and use of electronic submissions and systems for managing them has been hampered by several facts&lt;ref name="NitzaGeri_OritNaor-Elaiza"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ijello.org/Volume4/IJELLOv4p225-241Ger476.pdf|title=Beyond Adoption: Barriers to an Online Assignment Submission System Continued Use|last=Geri|first=Nitza|last2=Naor-Elaiza|first2=Orit}}&lt;/ref&gt; that include but are not limited to:

* Inconvenience while drawing figures, diagrams and equations on a computer
* Resistance to change and adopt new technologies
* Lack of or limited access to the Internet

==Life==
Zeck was born in Sydney. His artistic talent was recognised early and from 1908 to 1923 he worked as an entomological [[Technical illustration|illustrator]] at the Government Printing Office in Sydney. He subsequently joined the staff of the [[Department of Primary Industries (New South Wales)|New South Wales Department of Agriculture]] as an entomologist and remained there until his retirement in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P001954b.htm |title= Zeck, Emil Hermann (1891 - 1963) |accessdate=2014-04-28 |work= |first=GJ |last=McCarthy |publisher= Encyclopedia of Australian Science |date=2004-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/aboutus/services/collections/scientific-illustrations/zeck |title= Paintings of insects by EH Zeck |accessdate=2014-04-28 |work= |first= |last= |publisher= NSW Dept of Primary Industries |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''exodermis ''' is a layer of cells from the outermost layer of the cortex of many [[angiosperms]].  Like the [[endodermis]], its cells are very compact and are surrounded by a [[Casparian strip]], two features which are used to restrict flow of water to [[symplast]]ic rather than [[apoplast]]ic flow through passages through the cells' membranes called [[plasmodesma]]ta.

The exodermis is thought to provide protection against water loss of the root to the soil, and also to serve as defense against microorganisms.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, Peter H., Ray F. Evert, Susan E. Eichhorn. (2005) Biology of Plants. 7th Edition.  W.H. Freeman and Company Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''finderscope''' is an aiming device used in astronomy, typically a small auxiliary [[telescope]] mounted on the main [[astronomy|astronomical]] telescope along the same [[Sightline|line of sight]]. The finderscope usually has a smaller magnification than the main telescope, providing a much larger [[field of view]], useful for manually aiming (also called "slewing") a telescope and locating a desired astronomical object. Some finderscopes have [[crosshair]]s to aid in accurately pointing the telescope system at a target.

==Function and Design==
Finderscopes contain mechanisms to properly align them with the main telescope's line of sight. Accomplishing this alignment varies based on the design of the finderscope and its mount: usually on amateur telescopes it is done by three or six adjustment screws.

Finderscopes usually come with a designation of the form A×B, where A is the [[magnification]] and B is the [[aperture]] of the finderscope's [[objective lens]] in millimeters; for example, a 6×30 finderscope means a finderscope with a 30&amp;nbsp;mm objective and a magnification of 6×.  This designation is in the same format used by most [[binoculars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Select the Right Binocular|url=http://www.meade.com/support/selbinoc.html|publisher=Meade Instruments Corporation|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 6×30 finderscope is typically considered the minimum useful size for a magnifying finderscope on an amateur telescope, and an 8×50 or larger finderscope is preferred for more accurate aiming.&lt;ref&gt;"The Backyard Astronomer's Guide", by [[Terence Dickinson]] and Alan Dyer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most finderscopes have one of three viewing orientations:

== Reflex Sights ==
[[File:Telrad hinten.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Reflector sight|Reflex sights]] such as the Telrad (pictured) are  popular alternatives to traditional finderscopes, and are often used in conjunction with them.]]
Another type of finder commonly found on amateur telescopes is known as a [[Reflector sight|reflector (reflex) sight]]. This non-magnifying [[Sight (device)|sight]] (technically not a "scope") uses a type of [[beam splitter]] to "reflect" a reticle generated by [[Collimator#Optical collimators|collimating optics]] into the users field of view. The view of the sky seen through the sight is just what can be seen with the naked eye with an illuminated crosshair or dot seeming to float in space at [[infinity]]. These crosshairs are generally illuminated by a small LED. Reflector sights are useful for locating bright objects visible to the naked eye such as stars and [[planets]]. Since the sight uses a beam splitter "window", instead of an optical telescope with the ability to [[Optical telescope#Light-gathering power|gather light]], objects dimmer than the naked eye limit can not be seen through it. Finding dim objects with a reflector sight is accomplished by using the object's known position relative to brighter objects as a reference and then slewing a known angular distance (or "[[star hopping]]") from the bright object to the desired object. Many reflector sights have circles with a given angular dimension in order to facilitate this. Reflector sights are less useful in [[Light pollution|light polluted]] areas since the stars used to guide the observer to a dim object may also be invisible.&lt;ref&gt;Rod Mollise, The Urban Astronomer's Guide: A Walking Tour of the Cosmos for City Sky Watchers, Springer Science &amp; Business Media - 2006, page 43&lt;/ref&gt;

All of these phenomena can be generalised by a few theoretical results that qualitatively describe these non-equilibrium steady states. A common example of this is the derivation of the force exerted by a non-equilibrium system on two embedded walls. It is characteristic of a narrow, unimodal spectrum for the force to be dependent on the width and peak within a fluctuation spectrum, which oscillates between repulsion and attraction.

Some common generalisations of this theory can be applied to the [[Maritime Casimir Effect]] and through the motion of active [[Brownian motion|Brownian]] particles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandt|first=Erik G.|last2=Braun|first2=Anthony R.|last3=Sachs|first3=Jonathan N.|last4=Nagle|first4=John F.|last5=Edholm|first5=Olle|date=2011-05-04|title=Interpretation of Fluctuation Spectra in Lipid Bilayer Simulations|journal=Biophysical Journal|volume=100|issue=9|pages=2104–2111|doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2011.03.010|issn=0006-3495|pmc=3149257|pmid=21539777|bibcode=2011BpJ...100.2104B}}&lt;/ref&gt; within a closed system. Examples of active non-equilibrium systems can be demonstrated through many chemical, physical and biological processes; which range from [[turbulence]], mechanical driving, [[chemical bond]]ing, chemical gradients and [[cosmic background radiation]].

==Education==
Van Ginneken completed a bachelor's degree at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], a master’s at the [[University of Amsterdam]], followed by a brief stint at the [[École pratique des Hautes études]] en sciences sociales in Paris, and finally a Ph. D. with distinction on [[mass psychology]] and [[crowd psychology]]. He taught at various universities, ultimately as a long-time associate professor at the International School and Communication Science Department of the [[University of Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Kumar, ''The writers dictionary'', Farmington Hills, Michigan: St. James Press 2011 (26th ed.). {{ISBN|1-55862-756-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Journalism==
For most of the 1970s, he worked as a Paris-based newspaper correspondent and roving reporter on third world affairs for Dutch media, with isolated contributions to foreign newspapers such as the French ''[[Le Monde]]'' and the British ''[[The Guardian]]''. In line with the spirit of [[May 1968 in France]] and widespread opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam war, he adhered to the [[unequal exchange]] and [[dependency theory]], and came to sympathize with [[liberation movements]] and [[third world]] revolutions. Two of his early  books then focused on the new conflicts arising from them. ''The rise and fall of Lin Piao'' (and the so-called ‘Gang of Four’) dealt with ultraleftism during the Chinese cultural revolution. ''The third Indochina war'' dealt with the subsequent confrontation between China, Vietnam and Cambodia.
In the course of the early 1980s, however, Van Ginneken recognized that he had become too much of a [[fellow traveler]], and returned to academic work in his original fields.

==Academic Work==
This covered three themes: first the history of science, second social, political and mass psychology, third media images of other cultures. On the first theme, he published a series of studies on the history of [[political psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;‘Outline of a cultural history’. Ch. 1, pp. 3-22, in W. Stone &amp; P. Schaffner (1988), ''The psychology of politics'', New York: Springer. French transl.: [http://documents.irevues.inist.fr/handle/2042/15128 "Hermès: documents irevues"]{{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[crowd psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;''Crowds, psychology and politics''. Reviews:

Ch. 7, pp. 220-244, in J. Jansz &amp; P. van Drunen (eds., 2004), ''A social history of psychology'', Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; He just completed a biography of Kurt Baschwitz: a Jewish- German- Dutch pioneer of communication studies and social psychology. The second theme concerned new approaches to [[mass psychology]] and [[collective behavior]] sociology, in line with [[complex adaptive systems]] and [[chaos theory]] ''in Collective behavior and public opinion – Rapid shifts'',&lt;ref&gt;''Collective behavior and public opinion''. (Dutch: ''Brein-bevingen'').

The third theme concerned a series of studies on [[media psychology]], and [[stereotypes]] about [[cultural identity]]. In the international [[news media]]: with ''Understanding global news''.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding global news''. (Dutch: ''De schepping van de wereld in het nieuws''). Review: [http://ecs.sagepub.com/content/2/3/423.extract "Sage Journals"].&lt;/ref&gt; In movies: with ''Screening difference – How Hollywood blockbusters imagine race, ethnicity and culture''.&lt;ref&gt;''Screening difference''. (Dutch: ''Exotisch Hollywood''). Review: [http://news-business.vlex.com/vid/screening-blockbuster-imagine-ethnicity-68316937 "Vlex"].&lt;/ref&gt; As well as on the clash of civilizations,&lt;ref&gt;‘9/11 as a trigger for long-term shifts in world public opinion’, ''International Communication Gazette'', Vol. 4, No. 4 (Aug. 2007), pp. 323-333.  [http://gaz.sagepub.com/content/69/4/323.abstract abstract: ''International Communication Gazette''].&lt;/ref&gt; with further Dutch titles on classical comic strips, interpersonal communication and the immigration debate.

Next to his academic work, Van Ginneken always remained involved in a wide range of non-academic projects, for instance in [[science communication]]: for national events, major museums and prime-time television. Today, he is an independent speaker and writer, based near Nice in France.

Jacquard.jpg|thumb|This portrait of [[Joseph Marie Jacquard|Jacquard]] was woven in [[silk]] on a Jacquard loom and required 24,000 punched cards to create (1839). It was only produced to order. [[Charles Babbage]] owned one of these portraits; it inspired him in using perforated cards in his [[analytical engine]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, Anthony, ed.

The '''Jacquard machine''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒakaʁ|lang}}) is a device fitted to a [[power loom]] that simplifies the process of manufacturing [[textiles]] with such complex patterns as [[Brocade (fabric)|brocade]], [[damask]] and [[matelassé]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |title=Fabric Glossary |accessdate=2008-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105170019/http://www.christinalynn.com/fabric-glossary.shtml |archivedate=January 5, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was invented by [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Hobsbawm, "The Age of Revolution", (London 1962; repr. 2008), p.45.&lt;/ref&gt; The loom was controlled by a "chain of cards"; a number of [[punched card]]s laced together into a continuous sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal 
  |title= The London journal of arts and sciences (and repertory of patent inventions) |date= June 1, 1866 |page= 334

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple rows of holes were punched on each card, with one complete card corresponding to one row of the design. Several such paper cards, generally white in color, can be seen in the images below. Chains, like Bouchon's earlier use of [[paper tape]], allowed sequences of any length to be constructed, not limited by the size of a card.

It is based on earlier inventions by the Frenchmen [[Basile Bouchon]] (1725), Jean Baptiste Falcon (1728), and [[Jacques Vaucanson]] (1740).&lt;ref&gt;[[#RAZY|C. Razy]] p.120 (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; A static display of a Jacquard loom is the centrepiece of the [[Musée des Tissus et des Arts décoratifs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museedestissus.com |title=Musée des Tissus et des Arts Décoratifs |publisher=Museedestissus.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Lyon.  Live displays of a Jacquard loom are available at a few private museums around Lyon and also twice a day at La Maison des Canuts, as well as at other locations around the world.

Both the Jacquard process and the necessary loom attachment are named after their inventor. This mechanism is probably one of the most important weaving inventions as Jacquard [[shedding (loom)|shedding]] made possible the automatic production of unlimited varieties of pattern weaving. The term "Jacquard" is not specific or limited to any particular loom, but rather refers to the added control mechanism that automates the patterning. The process can also be used for patterned knitwear and machine-knitted textiles, such as [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parrillo Chapman|first=Lisa|title=Textile Design Engineering Within the Product Shape|year=2008|publisher=ProQuest|isbn=1109003986|pages=69–70|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QaHxO8qgZFYC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=jacquard+knitting&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1K8YUbyEJ4yo0AXOkoDgDg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=jacquard%20knitting&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of replaceable [[punched cards]] to control a sequence of operations is considered an important step in the [[history of computing hardware]].

==History==
[[File:Telaio Jacquard 1849.jpg|thumb|19th century Jacquard loom]]
In former times, if figured designs were required, this was done on a [[drawloom]]. The [[heddle]]s with warp ends to be pulled up were manually selected by a second operator (draw boy), apart from the weaver. It was slow and labour-intensive, with practical limitations on the complexity of the pattern.

The first important improvement of the draw loom took place in 1725, when [[Basile Bouchon]] introduced the principle of applying a perforated band of paper. A continuous roll of paper was punched by hand, in sections, each of which represented one lash or tread, and the length of the roll was determined by the number of shots in each repeat of pattern. The Jacquard machine subsequently evolved from this.

Joseph Marie Jacquard recognized that although weaving was intricate, it was repetitive, and saw that a [[mechanism (technology)|mechanism]] could be developed for the production of sophisticated patterns just as it had been done for the production of simple patterns.

It is difficult to determine what part of the 'Jacquard' machine was designed by Jacquard himself. He may have combined the best mechanical elements of other inventors, but - at any rate - the machine he made must have differed from its predecessors in arrangement and minor working details. It was similar in most general principles to [[Vaucanson]]'s arrangement, except that he made use of Jean-Baptiste Falcon's individual paste board cards and his square prism (or card 'cylinder'), which he is credited with having fully perforated on each of its four sides in lieu of [[Vaucanson]]'s perforated 'barrel'. Jacquard's machine also contained eight rows of needles and uprights as compared with [[Vaucanson]]'s double row, of which modifications enabled him to increase the figuring capacity of the machine. In his first machine, he supported the harness by knotted cords, which he elevated by a single trap board.

One of the chief advantages claimed for the Jacquard machine was that unlike previous damask-weaving machines, in which the figuring shed was usually drawn once for every four shots, with the new apparatus, it could be drawn on every shot, thus producing a fabric with greater definition of outline.&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, Fred (1912). ''Jacquard Mechanisms and Harness Mounting''. John Heywood Ltd., Technical Book Depot, Halifax, Yorks.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacquard's invention had a deep influence on [[Charles Babbage]]. In that respect, he is viewed by some authors as a precursor of modern [[computing]] science.&lt;ref&gt;Essinger, James (2004). ''Jacquard's web''. Oxford University Press, Oxford. {{ISBN|978-0-19-280578-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of operation==
[[File:Jacquard 2.jpg|thumb|Jacquard 2]]
On the diagram to the right, the cards are fastened into a continuous chain(1) which passes over a square box.  At each quarter rotation a new card is presented to the Jacquard head which represents one row.  The box swings from the right to the position shown and presses against the control rods(2).  Where there is a hole the rod passes through the card and is unmoved whereas if the hole is not punched the rod is pushed to the left.  Each rod acts upon a hook(3).  When the rod is pushed in the hook moves out of position to the left, a rod that is not pushed in leaves its hook in place.  A beam(4) then rises under the hooks and those hooks in the rest location are raised; the hooks that have been displaced are not moved by the beam.  Each hook can have multiple cords(5).  The cords pass through a guide(6) and are attached to their [[heddle]](7) and a return weight(8).  The heddles raise the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] to create the [[shed (weaving)|shed]] through which the [[shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]] carrying the [[weft]] will pass.  A loom with a 400 hook head might have four threads connected to each hook, resulting in a fabric that is 1600 [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] ends wide with four repeats of the weave going across.

The term "Jacquard loom" is somewhat inaccurate.  It is the "Jacquard head" that adapts to a great many [[dobby loom]]s that allow the weaving machine to then create the intricate patterns often seen in [[Jacquard weaving]].

Jacquard looms, although relatively common in the textile industry, are not as ubiquitous as dobby looms which are usually faster and much cheaper to operate. However, unlike jacquard looms, they are not capable of producing so many different weaves from one [[Warp (weaving)|warp]].  Modern jacquard looms are controlled by computers in place of the original punched cards, and can have thousands of hooks.

The threading of a Jacquard loom is so labor-intensive that many looms are threaded only once. Subsequent [[Warp (weaving)|warp]]s are then tied into the existing warp with the help of a knotting robot which ties each new thread on individually.  Even for a small loom with only a few thousand [[Warp (weaving)|warp ends]] the process of re-threading can take days.

==Mechanical Jacquard looms==
[[File:Jacquard.loom.cards.jpg|right|thumb|Punched cards in use in a Jacquard loom.]]
[[File:Masson Mills WTM 10 Jacquard Card Cutter 5890.JPG|thumb|A punch for Jacquard cards]]
Originally the Jacquard machines were [[machine|mechanical]], and the fabric design was stored in a series of [[punched card]]s which were joined to form a continuous chain. The Jacquards often were small and only independently controlled a relatively few warp ends. This required a number of repeats across the loom width. Larger capacity machines, or the use of multiple machines, allowed greater control, with fewer repeats, and hence larger designs could be woven across the loom width.

A [[factory]] must choose looms and shedding mechanisms to suit its commercial requirements. As a rule the more warp control required the greater the expense. So it is not economical to purchase Jacquard machines if one can make do with a [[Dobby loom|dobby mechanism]]. As well as the capital expense, the Jacquard machines are more costly to maintain, as they are complex and require higher skilled personnel; an expensive design system is required to prepare the designs for the loom, and possibly a card-cutting machine. Weaving is more costly since Jacquard mechanisms are more likely to produce faults than dobby or cam shedding. Also, the looms will not run as quickly and down-time will increase because it takes time to change the continuous chain of cards when a design changes. For these reasons it is best to weave larger batches with mechanical Jacquards.

==Electronic Jacquard looms==
It is recorded that in 1855 a Frenchman &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/irishlinentrade00smitgoog#page/n110/mode/2up/ The Irish Linen Trade Hand-Book and Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; adapted the Jacquard mechanism to a system by which it could be worked by electro-magnets. There was significant interest, however trials were not successful, and the development was soon lost in history.

Bonas Machine Company Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bonas.co.uk/ Bonas.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; launched the first successful electronic Jacquard at ITMA,&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.cematex.org/ Cematex.org]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milan]] in 1983. Although the machines were initially small, modern technology has allowed Jacquard machine capacity to increase significantly, and single end warp control can extend to more than 10,000 warp ends. This avoids the need for repeats and symmetrical designs and allows almost infinite versatility. The computer-controlled machines significantly reduce the down time associated with changing punched paper designs, thus allowing smaller batch sizes. However, electronic Jacquards are costly and may not be required in a factory weaving large batch sizes, and smaller designs. The larger machines allowing single end warp control are very expensive, and can only be justified where great versatility is required, or very specialized design requirements need to be met. For example, they are an ideal tool to increase the ability and stretch the versatility of the niche linen Jacquard weavers who remain active in Europe and the West, while most of the large batch commodity weaving has moved to low cost areas.

[[Linen]] products associated with Jacquard weaving are linen damask napery, Jacquard apparel fabrics and damask bed linen.

Jacquard weaving of course uses all sorts of fibers and blends of fibers, and it is used in the production of fabrics for many end uses. Research is under way to develop layered and shaped items as reinforcing components for structures made from [[composite material]]s.

==Importance in computing==
The Jacquard head used replaceable [[punched cards]] to control a sequence of operations.  It is considered an important step in the [[history of computing hardware]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability to change the pattern of the loom's weave by simply changing cards was an important conceptual precursor to the development of [[computer programming]] and data entry. [[Charles Babbage]] knew of Jacquard looms and planned to use cards to store programs in his [[Analytical Engine]]. In the late 19th century, [[Herman Hollerith]] took the idea of using punched cards to store information a step further when he created a punched card tabulating machine which he used to input data for the [[1890 U.S. Census]]. A large data processing industry using punched-card technology, developed in the first half of the twentieth century{{mdash}}dominated initially by the [[International Business Machine]] corporation (IBM), with its line of [[unit record equipment]]. The cards were used for data, however, with programming done by [[plugboard]]s.

Some early computers, such as the 1944 [[IBM Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator]] (Harvard Mark I) received program instructions from a paper tape punched with holes, similar to Jacquard's string of cards. Later computers executed programs from higher-speed memory, though cards were commonly used to load the programs into memory. Punched cards remained in use in computing up until the mid 1980s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5863">'''Laser linewidth''' is the [[spectral linewidth]] of a [[laser]] beam.

Two of the most distinctive characteristics of laser emission are [[coherence (physics)|spatial coherence]] and [[coherence (physics)|spectral coherence]].  While spatial coherence is related to the [[beam divergence]] of the laser, spectral coherence is evaluated by measuring the laser linewidth of the radiation.  Although the concept of laser linewidth can have varied theoretical descriptions here, this article provides a simple experimental description.  One of the first methods used to measure the coherence of a laser was [[optical interferometry|interferometry]].&lt;ref&gt;O. S. Heavens, ''Optical Masers'' (Wiley, New York, 1963).&lt;/ref&gt;  An alternative approach is the use of [[spectroscopy|spectrometry]].&lt;ref name="FPS"&gt;[[F. P. Schäfer]]'' et al.'', Organic dye solution laser, ''Appl. Phys. Lett.'' '''9''', 306-309 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous lasers==
Laser linewidth in a typical single-[[transverse mode|transverse-mode]] [[He-Ne laser]] (at a [[wavelength]] of 632.8&amp;nbsp;nm), in the absence of intracavity line narrowing optics,  can be of the order of 1&amp;nbsp;GHz.  On the other hand, the laser linewidth from stabilized low-power continuous-wave lasers can be very narrow and reach down to less than 1&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;L. W. Hollberg, CW dye lasers, in ''Dye Laser Principles'', F. J. Duarte and L. W. Hillman (eds.) (Academic, New York, 1990) Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Often this type of linewidth is limited by fundamental quantum processes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Haken|H. Haken]], ''Light and Matter'' (Springer, Berlin, 1970).&lt;/ref&gt; This limit is known as the Schawlow–Townes linewidth&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rp-photonics.com/schawlow_townes_linewidth.html - Schawlow–Townes Linewidth&lt;/ref&gt; which can be lower than Hz for some kind of CW lasers. Nevertheless, observed linewidths are larger due to a technical noise (from noise in current, vibrations etc.).

==Pulsed lasers==
Laser linewidth from high-power, high-gain pulsed-lasers, in the absence of intracavity line narrowing optics,  can be quite broad and in the case of powerful broadband [[dye laser]]s it can range from a few nm wide&lt;ref&gt;M. L. Spaeth and D. P. Bortfeld, Stimulated emission from polymethine dyes, ''Appl. Phys. Lett.'' '''9''', 179-181 (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; to as broad as 10&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="FPS"/&gt;

Laser linewidth from high-power high-gain pulsed laser oscillators, comprising line narrowing optics, is a function of the geometrical and dispersive features of the [[laser cavity]].&lt;ref name=TLO&gt;F. J. Duarte,[http://www.tunablelaseroptics.com ''Tunable Laser Optics'', 2nd Edition (CRC, New York, 2015)].&lt;/ref&gt;  To a first approximation the laser linewidth, in an optimized cavity, is directly proportional to the [[beam divergence]] of the emission multiplied by the inverse of the [[Multiple-prism dispersion theory|''overall intracavity dispersion'']].&lt;ref name=TLO /&gt; That is,  
 
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\lambda \approx \Delta \theta \left({\partial\Theta\over\partial\lambda}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as the ''cavity linewidth equation'' where &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[beam divergence]] and the term in parenthesis (elevated to –1) is the overall intracavity dispersion.  This equation was originally derived from classical optics.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Robertson, ''Introduction to Optics: Geometrical and Physical'' (Van Nostrand, New York, 1955).&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1992 [[F. J. Duarte|Duarte]] derived this equation from [[N-slit interferometric equation|quantum interferometric]] principles,&lt;ref&gt;F. J. Duarte, Cavity dispersion equation: a note on its origin, ''Appl. Opt.'' '''31''', 6979-6982 (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;  thus linking a quantum expression with the overall intracavity angular dispersion.

An optimized [[multiple-prism grating laser oscillator]] can deliver pulse emission in the kW regime at single-longitudinal-mode linewidths of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \nu&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 350&amp;nbsp;MHz (equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\Delta \lambda&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 0.0004&amp;nbsp;nm at a laser wavelength of 590&amp;nbsp;nm).&lt;ref name=D1999&gt;[[F. J. Duarte]], Multiple-prism grating solid-state dye laser oscillator: optimized architecture, ''Appl. Opt.'' '''38''', 6347-6349 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Since the pulse duration from these oscillators is about 3 ns,&lt;ref name=D1999 /&gt; the laser linewidth performance is near the limit allowed by the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].

==Linewidth equivalence==
In the frequency domain the laser linewidth is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\Delta \nu&lt;/math&gt; and is given in units of GHz, MHz, or kHz.   In the spectral domain the laser linewidth is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\Delta \lambda&lt;/math&gt; and is often given in units of nm.   In the field of [[spectroscopy]] the use of the reciprocal cm, or cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, is widespread.

In more detail, the laser linewidth in frequency units can be written as&lt;ref name=TLO /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\nu \approx {c \over\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the speed of light (in units of velocity) and &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the [[coherence length]] (a length) so that the linewidth &lt;math&gt;\Delta \nu&lt;/math&gt; is in units of frequency.  The equivalent definition in the wavelength domain is&lt;ref name=TLO /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta\lambda \approx {\lambda^2 \over\Delta x}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the quantity &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is the common factor between the equivalent linewidths in Hz and meter units.  With these definitions it can be shown, for example, that &lt;math&gt;\Delta \nu&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 350&amp;nbsp;MHz is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\Delta \lambda&lt;/math&gt; ≈ 0.0004&amp;nbsp;nm at a laser wavelength of 590&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name=D1999 /&gt;

The CERCLA federal law of 1980 authorized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to create a list of [[Pollution|polluted]] locations requiring a long-term response to clean up hazardous material contaminations.&lt;ref&gt;P.L. 96-510, {{USC|42|9601|9675}}), December 11, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;   These locations are known as [[Superfund]] sites, and are placed on the [[National Priorities List]] (NPL).  

The NPL guides the EPA in "determining which sites warrant further investigation" for [[environmental remediation]].&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;  As of May 3, 2010, there were thirteen Superfund sites on the National Priorities List in [[Tennessee]]&lt;ref name="NPL"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epa.gov/superfund/sites/npl/ |title=National Priorities List |publisher=United States Environmental Protection Agency |accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and four Superfund Alternative sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Region 4 Superfund Sites | publisher=EPA | url=http://www.epa.gov/region4/waste/npl/index.htm#TN | accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Two more sites have been proposed for entry on the list and six others have been cleaned up and removed from it.&lt;ref name="NPL"/&gt;

This is a '''list of [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]s''' for common [[function (mathematics)|function]]s. Note that ''a'' and ''b'' are constants with respect to ''x''. Algebra of limits

==Limits for general  functions==

:&lt;math&gt;\text{If }\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = L_1 \text{ and }\lim_{x \to c} g(x) = L_2 \text{ then:}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \, [f(x) \pm g(x)] = L_1 \pm L_2&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \, [f(x)g(x)] = L_1 \times L_2&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{L_1}{L_2} \qquad \text{ if } L_2 \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \, f(x)^n = L_1^n \qquad \text{ if }n \text{ is a positive integer}&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \, f(x)^{1 \over n} = L_1^{1 \over n} \qquad \text{ if }n \text{ is a positive integer, and if } n \text{ is even, then } L_1 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to c} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} \qquad \text{ if } \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = \lim_{x \to c} g(x) = 0 \text{ or } \pm\infty&lt;/math&gt; ([[L'Hôpital's rule]])

==Limits of general functions==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to 0}{f(x+h)-f(x)\over h}=f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\to0}\left(\frac{f(x+h)}{f(x)}\right)^\frac{1}{h}=\exp\left(\frac{f'(x)}{f(x)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h \to 0}{\left({f(x(1+h))\over{f(x)}}\right)^{1\over{h}} }=\exp\left(\frac{x f'(x)}{f(x)}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Notable special limits==

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to+\infty} \left(1+\frac{k}{x}\right)^{mx}=e^{mk}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to+\infty} \left(1+\frac{1}{x}\right)^x=e&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to+\infty} \left(1-\frac{1}{x}\right)^x=\frac{1}{e}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to+\infty} \left( \frac{x}{x+k}\right)^x=\frac{1}{e^k}&lt;/math&gt; 

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to 0} \left(1+x\right)^\frac{1}{x}=e&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n}{\sqrt[n]{n!}}=e&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to \infty }\, 2^{n} \underbrace{\sqrt{2-\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\text{...} +\sqrt{2}}}}}_n= \pi&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0} \left( \frac{a^x - 1}{x} \right) = \ln{a}, \qquad \forall~a &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;/div&gt; &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0} \left(1+ a \left({e^{-x} - 1}\right)\right)^{-\frac{1}{x}} = e^{a}\qquad \text{Follows from }&lt;/math&gt;[[#Logarithmic and exponential functions Anchor01|***]]

==Simple functions==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} a = a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} x = c&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} ax + b = ac + b&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} x^r = c^r \qquad \mbox{ if } r \mbox{ is a positive integer}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^+} \frac{1}{x^r} = +\infty&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^-} \frac{1}{x^r} = \begin{cases} -\infty, &amp; \text{if } r \text{ is odd} \\ +\infty, &amp; \text{if } r \text{ is even}\end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

==Logarithmic and exponential functions==
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to1}\frac{\ln(x)}{x-1}=1&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{y\to0}\frac{\ln(y+1)}{y}=1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{For } a &gt; 1: &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^+} \log_a x = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \log_a x = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{For } a &lt; 1: &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0^+} \log_a x = \infty&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \log_a x = -\infty&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;div id="Logarithmic and exponential functions Anchor01"&gt; &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{-\ln\left(1+ a \left({e^{-x} - 1}\right)\right)}{x} = a\quad \text{***   Follows from}&lt;/math&gt; [[L'Hôpital's rule]].

==Trigonometric functions==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} \sin x = \sin a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to a} \cos x = \cos a&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is expressed in radians:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin x}{x} = 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin ax}{ax} = 1&lt;/math&gt;    for a is a constant
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1-\cos x}{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1-\cos x}{x^2} = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to n^\pm} \tan \left(\pi x + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \mp\infty \qquad \text{for any integer } n&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin ax}{x} = a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin ax}{bx} = \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;

==Near infinities==

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}N/x=0 \text{ for any real }N &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}x/N=\begin{cases} \infty, &amp; N &gt; 0 \\ \text{does not exist}, &amp; N = 0 \\ -\infty, &amp; N &lt; 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}x^N=\begin{cases} \infty, &amp; N &gt; 0 \\ 1, &amp; N = 0 \\ 0, &amp; N &lt; 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}N^x=\begin{cases} \infty, &amp; N &gt; 1 \\ 1, &amp; N = 1 \\ 0, &amp; 0 &lt; N &lt; 1 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}N^{-x}=\lim_{x\to\infty}1/N^{x}=0 \text{ for any } N &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\sqrt[x]{N}=\begin{cases} 1, &amp; N &gt; 0 \\ 0, &amp; N = 0 \\ \text{does not exist}, &amp; N &lt; 0 \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\sqrt[x]{x}=1&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to\infty}\sqrt[N]{x}= \infty \text{ for any } N &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The following are lists of devices categorized as types of telescopes or devices associated with [[telescope]]s. They are broken into major classifications with many variations due to professional, amateur, and commercial sub-types. Telescopes can be classified by optical design or mechanical design/construction. Telescopes can also be classified by where they are placed, such as [[space telescope]]s. One major determining factor is type of light, or particle being observed including devices referred to as "telescopes" that do not form an image or use optics. Some telescopes are classified by the task they perform; for example [[Solar telescope]]s are all designs that look at the [[Sun]], [[Dobsonian telescope]]s are designed to be low cost and portable, [[Aerial telescope]]s overcame the optical shortcomings of 17th-century objective lenses, etc.

==List of optical telescope types==
'''[[Optical telescope]]s''' can be classified by three primary optical designs (refractor, reflector, or catadioptric), by sub-designs of these types, by how they are constructed, or by the task they perform. They all have their different advantages and disadvantages and they are used in different areas of [[Astronomer|professional]] and [[amateur astronomy]].

[[File:Marine-engineering.jpg|thumb|Marine engineers reviewing ship plans]]
'''Marine engineering''' includes the [[engineering]] of [[watercraft|boats, ships, oil rigs and any other marine vessel]] or structure, as well as '''oceanographic engineering''' or '''ocean engineering'''. Specifically, marine engineering is the discipline of applying engineering sciences, including [[mechanical engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[electronic engineering]], and [[computer science]], to the development, design, operation and maintenance of [[Marine propulsion|watercraft propulsion]] and on-board systems and oceanographic technology. It includes but is not limited to power and propulsion plants, machinery, piping, automation and control systems for marine vehicles of any kind, such as surface ships and submarines.

==History==
[[Archimedes]] is traditionally regarded as the first marine engineer, having developed a number of marine engineering systems in antiquity. Modern marine engineering dates back to the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]] (early 1700s). In 1712 [[Thomas Newcomen]], a blacksmith, created a steam powered engine to pump water out of mines. In 1807 [[Robert Fulton]] successfully used a steam engine to propel a vessel through the water. Fulton's ship used the engine to power a small wooden paddle wheel as its propulsion system. The integration of steam engines into ships was the start of the marine engineering profession.

Paddle wheel ships were the front runner of the industry for the next thirty years till the next type of propulsion came around. Only twelve years after Fulton’s [[North River Steamboat|''Clermont'']] had her first voyage, the [[SS Savannah|''Savannah'']] marked the first sea voyage from America to Europe. Around 50 years later the steam powered paddle wheels had a peak with the creation of the [[SS Great Eastern|''Great Eastern'']], which was as big as one of the cargo ships of today, 700 feet in length, weighing 22,000 tons. The ''Great Eastern'' was said to be ahead of its time and was destined for failure. Since the 1800s there have been many improvements to the design of engines and propellers. The [[maritime industry]] holds 90% of all international trade.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, J.R. (1971). Marine Engineering. New York: SNAME(page 2-3)&lt;/ref&gt;

Marine engineers work on more than just engines in ships. Marine engineers are also responsible for building and maintaining [[Oil platform|offshore oil rigs]]. These oil rigs were first made by Henry L. Williams in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce A. Wells, (2003) Offshore Petroleum History, American Oil and Gas Historical Society. Retrieved 4/10/14 http://aoghs.org/offshore-exploration/offshore-oil-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marine engineering specialties==

===Naval architect===

[[Naval architecture|Naval architects]] are concerned with the overall design of the ship and its propulsion through the water.

===Mechanical engineering===

Mechanical engineers design the main [[propulsion]] plant, the powering and mechanization aspects of the ship functions such as steering, [[anchor]]ing, [[cargo#Marine|cargo]] handling, heating, ventilation, air conditioning interior and exterior communication, and other related requirements.  [[Electrical power generation]] and [[electrical power distribution]] systems are typically designed by their suppliers; only installation is the design responsibility of the marine engineer.

===Oceanographic engineering===
Oceanographic engineering is concerned with mechanical, electrical, and electronic, and computing technology deployed to support [[oceanography]], and also falls under the umbrella of marine engineering, especially in Britain, where it is covered by the same professional organisation, the [[IMarEST]].

===Offshore engineering===

Civil engineering for an offshore environment, the design and construction of fixed and floating marine structures, such as [[oil platform]]s and [[offshore wind farm]]s is generally called ''offshore engineering''.

==Challenges specific to marine engineering==
===Hydrodynamic loading===
In the same way that civil engineers design to accommodate wind loads on building and bridges, maritime engineers design to accommodate a ship being flexed or a platform being struck by waves millions of times in its life.

===Stability===
A naval architect, like an airplane designer, is concerned with [[Ship stability|stability]].  The naval architect's job is different, insofar as a ship operates in two fluids simultaneously: water and air. Engineers also face the challenge of balancing cargo as the mass of the ship increase and the center of gravity shifts higher as additional containers are stacked vertically. In addition, the weight of fuel presents a problem as the pitch of the ship cause the weight to shift with the liquid causing an imbalance. This offset is counteracted by water inside larger [[ballast]] tanks. Engineers are faced with the task of balancing and tracking the fuel and ballast water of a ship.

===Corrosion===
The chemical environment faced by ships and offshore structures is far harsher than nearly anywhere on land, save chemical plants.  Marine engineers are concerned with surface protection and preventing [[galvanic corrosion]] in every project.   [[Corrosion]] can be inhibited through [[cathodic protection]] by utilizing pieces of metal known as sacrificial anodes. A piece of metal such as zinc is used as the sacrificial anode as it becomes the anode in the chemical reaction. This causes the metal to corrode and not the ship’s hull. Another way to prevent corrosion is by sending a controlled amount of low DC current to the ship’s hull to prevent the process of electro-chemical corrosion. This changes the electrical charge of the ship’s hull to prevent electro-chemical corrosion.

=== Anti-fouling ===
Anti-fouling is the process of eliminating obstructive organisms from essential components of seawater systems. Marine organisms grow and attach to the surfaces of the outboard suction inlets used to obtain water for cooling systems. [[Electrochlorination|Electro-chlorination]] involves running high electrical current through sea water. The combination of current and sea water alters the chemical composition to create [[sodium hypochlorite]] to purge any bio-matter.  An electrolytic method of anti-fowling involves running electrical current through two anodes (Scardino, 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/20464177.2009.11020214|title=Fouling control using air bubble curtains: protection for stationary vessel.|last=Scardino|date=2009|website=Journal of marine engineering and technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; These anodes typically consist of copper and aluminum (or iron). The copper [[anode]] releases its ion into the water creating an environment that is too toxic for bio-matter. The second metal, aluminum, coats the inside of the pipes to help prevent corrosion. Other forms of marine growth such as mussels and algae may attach themselves to the bottom of a ship's hull. This causes the ship to have a less hydrodynamic shape since it would not be uniform and smooth around the hull. This creates the problem of less fuel efficiency as it slows down the vessel (IMO, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/en/OurWork/Environment/Anti-foulingSystems/Pages/Default.aspx|title=Anti-Fouling Systems|date=2018|website=International Maritime Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; This issue can be remedied by using special paint that prevent the growth of such organisms.

=== Pollution control ===

==== Sulfur emission ====

The burning of marine fuels has the potential to release harmful pollutants into the atmosphere. Ships burn marine diesel in addition to [[heavy fuel oil]]. Heavy fuel oil, being the heaviest of [[Refined oil products|refined oils]], releases [[sulfur dioxide]] when burned. [[Sulfur dioxide emissions]] have the potential to raise atmospheric and [[ocean acidity]] causing harm to. However, heavy fuel oil may only be burned in [[international waters]] due to the pollution created. It is commercially advantageous due to the cost effectiveness compared to other marine fuels. It is prospected that heavy fuel oil will be phased out of commercial use by the year 2020 (Smith, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maritimepropulsion.com|title=Eco Ships:The New Norm for Top Tier Ships|last=Smith|date=2018|website=Maritime Reporter and Engineering News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Oil and water discharge ====

Water, oil, and other substances collect at the bottom of the ship in what is known as the bilge. Bilge water is pumped overboard, but must pass a pollution threshold test of 15 ppm (parts per million) of oil to be discharged. Water is tested and either discharged if clean or recirculated to a holding tank to be separated before being tested again. The tank it is sent back to, the oily water separator, utilizes gravity to separate the fluids due to their viscosity. Ships over 400 gross tons  are required to carry the equipment to separate oil from bilge water. Further, as enforced by MARPOL, all ships over 400 gross tons and all oil tankers over 150 gross tons are require to log all oil transfer is an oil record book (EPA, 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/vgp_bilge.pdf|title=Oily Bilgewater Separators|date=2011|website=Environmental Protection Agency Office of Wastewater Management United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cavitation ===
[[Cavitation]] is the process of forming an air bubble in a liquid due to the vaporization of that liquid cause by an area of low pressure. This area of low pressure lowers the boiling point of a liquid allowing it to vaporize into a gas. Cavitation can take place in pumps, which can cause damage to the impeller that moves the fluids through the system. Cavitation is also seen in propulsion. Low pressure pockets form on the surface of the propeller blades as its revolutions per minute increase (IIMS, 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iims.org.uk/introduction-propeller-cavitation/|title=An Introduction to Propeller Cavitation|date=2015|website=International Institute of Maritime Surveying}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cavitation on the propeller causes a small put violent implosion which could warp the propeller blade. To remedy the issue, more blades allow the same amount of propulsion force but at a lower rate of revolutions. This is crucial for submarines as the propeller needs to keep the vessel relatively quiet to stay hidden. With more propeller blades, the vessel is able to achieve the same amount of propulsion force at lower shaft revolutions.

==Career==

In 2012, the average annual earnings for marine engineers in the U.S. were $96,140 with average hourly earnings of $46.22.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor. (January 8, 2014) Marine Engineers and Naval Architects, Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Retrieved April 2, 2014 http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/marine-engineers-and-naval-architects.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry growth ==

Marine engineering is predicted to grow approximately 12% from 2016 to 2026. Currently there are about 8,200 naval architects and marine engineers employed, however, this number is expected to increase to 9,200 by 2026 (BLS, 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/marine-engineers-and-naval-architects.htm#|title=Occupational Handbook: Marine Engineers and Naval Architects|date= October 24, 2017|website=Bureau of Labor Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trend could be attributed to the demand in fossil fuels obtained through offshore drilling and mining. In addition, 90% of the world's trade is done overseas by close to 50,000 ships, all of which require engineers aboard and shoreside (ICS, 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ics-shipping.org/shipping-facts/shipping-and-world-trade|title=Shipping and World Trade|date=2017|website=International Chamber of Shipping}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
[[File:TSGB Vallejo CA.jpg|thumb|Training Ship Golden Bear docked at California Maritime Academy.]]
[[List of maritime colleges|Maritime universities]] are dedicated to teaching and training students in maritime professions. Marine engineers generally have a bachelor's degree in marine engineering, marine engineering technology, or marine systems engineering. Practical training is valued by employers alongside the bachelor's degree.

'''Multi-Scale Multidisciplinary Modeling of Electronic Materials (MSME) Collaborative Research Alliance (CRA)''' was a research program initiated and sponsored by the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|US Army Research Laboratory]]. The objective of the program was “to develop quantitative understanding of materials from the smallest to the largest relevant scales to advance the state of the art in electronic, optoelectronic and electrochemical materials and devices.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=1418|title=Electronic Materials {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory|website=www.arl.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collaborative Technology and Research Alliances is a term for partnerships between Army laboratories and centers, private industry and academia for performing research and technology development intended to benefit the US Army. The partnerships are funded by the US Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?page=93|title=Collaborative Alliances {{!}} U.S. Army Research Laboratory|website=www.arl.army.mil|language=en|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Since approximately 1992, ARL formed a number of partnerships that involved the triad of industry, academia and government. One of them was the Multi-Scale Multidisciplinary Modeling of Electronic Materials (MSME) Collaborative Research Alliance which was awarded in 2012. The program was completed in 2016.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uintah.utah.edu/projects/16-projects/projects-new/22-cde3m.html|title=Multiscale Multidisciplinary Modeling of Electronic Materials Collaborative Research Alliance|last=Galli|first=Nathan|website=uintah.utah.edu|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

The objective of this Alliance was to conduct research supporting efforts in future electronic materials and devices for the Army. MSME achieved this through development of fundamental models in electronic materials research. The multiscale models were assembled by the MSME team and the experimentation for validation and verification for these models was performed by ARL scientists in each research area, which was part of a continual process to develop new models through collaboration between ARL and its partners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Research Thrusts ==

The MSME program was organized around several research thrusts, which included the following:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* 
* Electrochemical Energy Devices - Focus on interfacial physics and chemistry, ion transport, nanostructures, solid-liquid interface: to include fuel cells, capacitors, etc.
* Hybrid Photonic Devices - Study the interaction of photons, electrons, and phonons, to include photonics, spintronics, plasmonics, etc.
* Heterogeneous Metamorphic Electronics - Examine mixed materials with partial ordering, e.g., graphene, metamaterials, nanoelectronic structures, etc.

== Participants ==

The research under this program was performed collaboratively by the US Army Research Laboratory and by scientists and engineers of the following institutions:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* Army Research Laboratory
* [[University of Utah]]
* [[Boston University]]
* [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4300">In [[fluid mechanics]], '''multiphase flow''' is simultaneous flow of (a) materials with different states or phases (i.e. gas, liquid or solid), or (b) materials with different chemical properties but in the same state or phase (i.e. liquid-liquid systems such as oil droplets in water).

Each of the [[phase (matter)|phase]]s is considered to have a separately defined volume fraction (the sum of which is unity) and velocity field. 
[[Continuity equation|Conservation equations]] for the flow of each species (perhaps with terms for interchange between the phases) can then be written down straightforwardly.

The momentum equation for each phase is less straightforward. It can be shown that a common [[pressure]] field can be defined and that each phase is subject to the gradient of this field, weighted by its volume fraction. Transfer of momentum between the phases is sometimes less straightforward to determine, and, in addition, a very light phase in bubble form has a [[added mass|virtual mass]] associated with its acceleration. (The virtual mass of a single bubble is about half its displaced mass).

These terms, often called [[constitutive equation|constitutive relation]]s, are often strongly dependent on flow regime.

==Environment and nature==
In nature and environment, rain, snow, fog, avalanches, mud slides, sediment transport, debris flows are all examples of multiphase flow where the behaviour of the phases are studied in different fields of natural science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brennen|first1=Christopher E.|title=Fundamentals of Multiphase Flows|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521 848040|pages=20|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/25021/2/cabook.pdf|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Oil and gas ==
In oil and gas industries, multiphase flow often implies to simultaneous flow of oil, water and gas. The term is also applicable to signifies the properties of a flow in some field where there is a chemical injection or various types of inhibitors. Volumetric flow rates, mass flow rates (per phases and total) and also phase fractions are the important parameters to be accounted for when designing and operating multiphase-including systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Multiphase Well Testing and Monitoring|url=http://www.slb.com/services/characterization/testing/multiphase.aspx|website=SLB|publisher=Schlumberger|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vx Spectra Surface Multiphase Flowmeter|url=http://www.slb.com/services/characterization/testing/multiphase/spectra.aspx|website=SLB|publisher=Schlumberger|accessdate=21 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example, multiphase flow can occur during the different stages of oil and gas recovery. 
Stage 1: Single-phase flow (oil) or multiphase flow (gas production related decrease of the average pressure of the reservoir).
Stage 2: Waterflooding: Injection of water to increase oil recovery
Stage 3: EOR ([[Enhanced oil recovery]]): Use of chemicals (surfactant) or bacteria to improve the recovery of the residual oil.

Norton &amp; Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Next-The-Future-Just-Happened/dp/0393020371/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388395191&amp;sr=1-13 Next: The Future Just Happened Hardcover]&lt;/ref&gt; The book argues that rapidly evolving technology will upend the power structure of society.  It gives power to the youngster who doesn't have preconceptions and entrenched interests. By making information readily available, the [[internet]] erodes the power and mystique of many professions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-393-02037-3 NEXT: The Future Just Happened]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Lewis provides examples including:

* At the age of twelve, [[Jonathan Lebed]] began trading stocks.  When he and three buddies did well in a stock-picking contest, people began coming to him for advice.  By the age of fourteen, he learned that by posting messages in chat rooms, he could affect stock prices.  This illustrates how internet chat rooms shifted power from seasoned professionals to a fourteen-year-old.
* In the next chapter, the legal profession suffers a blow to its pride at the hands of fifteen-year-old Marcus Arnold, who became a top-ranked respondent to legal questions on AskMe.com.
* The British rock band [[Marillion]] could not get funds for a promotional tour from their record company so they turned to the internet.  By connecting directly with their fans through their fan website, they were able to raise money for the tour, then to produce new CDs and to sell merchandise.  They are no longer dependent on the normal intermediaries.
* [[TiVo]] and [[ReplayTV|Replay]] allow people to watch TV shows when they want and to skip the advertisements.  This changes the relationship between the broadcasters and the viewers.  It continues the fracturing of the market observed by [[Alvin Toffler]] in [[The Third Wave (Toffler book)|''The Third Wave'']] (1980) and many others.  The TiVo and Replay black boxes also transmit information back to the companies.  The information on consumer preferences and behavior is valuable to advertisers because they can use it to try to target their ads to the people most likely to buy the product.  This further segments the markets.  Consumers gain convenience at the cost of privacy.

Lewis argues that [[elite]]s are under attack.  The internet makes information readily available to everyone.  If nothing is hidden or arcane, the need for professionals is threatened.  In a world of accelerating change, “the state of mind demanded by [such] a world… is alien to anyone over forty.”

'''Nur al-Din Bimaristan''' ({{lang-ar|البيمارستان النوري}}) is a large medieval ''[[bimaristan]]'' ("hospital") in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]]. It is located in the [[al-Hariqa]] quarter in the old walled city, to the southwest of the [[Umayyad Mosque]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-hakawati.net/arabic/Architecture/school3.asp|title=Al- Hakawati|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built and named after the [[Zengid dynasty|Zengid]] Sultan [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]] in 1154. The ''bimaristan'' is well known for its unusual portal, which displays an antique [[lintel]] and a curious flattened ''[[muqarnas]]'' vault. It is also unusual in its full-scale [[Mesopotamian]]-style ''muqarnas'' vault over the vestibule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Architecture==
The building is of the Iraqi type, in plan also, with a symmetrical disposition of four ''[[iwan]]s'' around a central courtyard. But other than that, the building is fully in the [[Damascus|Damascene]] construction tradition, and in fact stones from the outer enclosure of the antique temple were reused in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Eucalyptus erythrocorys operculum.jpg|thumb|right|The flower buds of ''[[Eucalyptus erythrocorys]]'' have a large, bright red operculum.]]
An '''operculum''' or (in plural) '''opercula''' are [[botany|botanical]] terms describing a certain structure or structures of certain [[vascular plant]]s, [[moss]]es, or [[fungus|fungi]] which act as a cap, flap, or lid. In vascular plants, an operculum may also be called a '''bud cap'''.

Examples of structures identified as opercula include:
*A flap of the [[sporangium]] of a [[moss]], covering the [[peristome]] (appendages surrounding the mouth of a moss capsule).
*The cap of the [[ascus]] in certain [[Ascomycota|ascomycetous]] fungi.
*A lid covering the aperture of [[pollen]] grains.
*The bud cap covering the flowers of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' and ''[[Corymbia]]'' trees which falls off as they open.
*The covering of a pyxidium (fruit [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] whose upper part falls off when the seeds are released) of a plant, such as the [[Plantago|plantain]].
*The flared [[leaflet (botany)|leaflet]] that prevents a [[pitcher plant]] from accumulating rainwater.

'''Paul Dognin''' (10 May 1847 – 10 August 1931) was a French [[entomologist]] who specialised in the [[Lepidoptera]] of [[South America]].
Dognin named 101 new [[genera]] of moths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhm.ac.uk/jdsml/research-curation/research/projects/butmoth/GenusList2.dsml?AUTHOR=Dognin&amp;searchPageURL=BrowseAuthors.dsml "Genera authored by Dognin"]. ''Butterflies and Moths of the World''. Natural History Museum, London. Retrieved December 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dognin lived at 11 Villa Molitor, [[16th arrondissement of Paris|Paris 16]]. He was a member of the [[Société entomologique de France]].

His collection (82,000 specimens including 3,000 Dognin [[Holotype|types]] and  over 300 [[Paul Thierry-Mieg|Thierry-Mieg]] types) is shared between the French [[Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle]] and the [[National Museum of Natural History]] in Washington, DC. It was partially sold to [[William Schaus]], who then donated it to National Museum of Natural History.

'''Questacon – the National Science and Technology Centre''', is located on the southern shore of [[Lake Burley Griffin]] in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]]. It is a large centre with more than 200 interactive exhibits relating to [[Science, technology and society|science and technology]]. It has many science programs that are devoted to inspiring the children of Australia to love science.

== History ==
Questacon is an interactive science centre that opened in September 1988. It was developed by Professor Mike Gore, a physics lecturer from the [[Australian National University]]. Professor Gore went on to become the founding Director of Questacon.

Questacon's current building was [[Japan|Japan's]] present to Australia for the 1988 [[Australian Bicentenary|Bicentenary]] and it was opened on 23 November 1988. Japanese government and business contributed ¥1 billion, half of the capital cost of A$19.64 million.&lt;ref name="questacon+japan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.questacon.edu.au/japan|title=Questacon and Japan|publisher=Questacon.edu.au|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questacon was formerly housed at the old Ainslie Primary School.

As of 3 December 2007,&lt;ref name="www.australia.gov.au"&gt;[http://www.australia.gov.au/Government_Sites_by_Portfolio#InnovationIndustryScienceandResearch]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725023940/http://www.australia.gov.au/Government_Sites_by_Portfolio#InnovationIndustryScienceandResearch |date=25 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Questacon is a part of the Australian Government Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research [http://www.industry.gov.au (DIISR)]. The director is Professor Graham Durant. Questacon's vision is "a better future for all Australians through engagement with science and innovation".&lt;ref name="questacon_2005-06_review"&gt;[http://www.questacon.edu.au/html/assets/pdf/review_2005-06.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830100747/http://www.questacon.edu.au/html/assets/pdf/review_2005-06.pdf |date=30 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday 18 September 2008 a [https://web.archive.org/web/20090227052631/http://www.innovation.gov.au/General/Corp-MC/Documents/SteppingUponline.pdf review of Questacon] was released.&lt;ref name="Innovation release"&gt;[http://www.innovation.gov.au/General/Corp-MC/Pages/REVIEWOFQUESTACONREPORT.aspx]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519012540/http://www.innovation.gov.au/General/Corp-MC/Pages/REVIEWOFQUESTACONREPORT.aspx |date=19 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was commissioned by Minister [[Kim Carr]] and chaired by John Simpson of [[National Australia Bank]]. Among other recommendations, the review calls for Questacon to be established as a [[statutory authority]].

The galleries are staffed by paid staff, as well as team of about 60 volunteers. The volunteers occasionally will make use of ''Discovery Trolleys'', featuring smaller, hands-on exhibits related to the gallery.

=== Science theatre ===
The Centre also features a number of performance spaces, used for presentations for general public and student audiences by Questacon's in-house theatre troupe, the "Excited Particles". The Excited Particles also perform puppet shows for young children.

=== Nkrypt ===
''Nkrypt'' is a sculpture installation outside the Questacon building that consists of eight laser etched stainless steel poles that each carry an encoded message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.questacon.edu.au/nkrypt/|title=NKRYPT|publisher=Questacon.edu.au|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The outdoor exhibit was installed as a part of the Centenary of [[Canberra]] and a prize is offered to the first person to solve the puzzle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canberra100.com.au/calendar/view/737/questacon-centenary-code-challenge/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104051822/http://www.canberra100.com.au/calendar/view/737/questacon-centenary-code-challenge/ |date=4 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Facilities===
Questacon is open from 9am to 5pm.

The ''Q Shop'' offers a range of educational science toys, books and teacher resources. Questacon's cafe is situated in the foyer of the building. An entry fee is not required to visit either the cafe or the ''Q Shop''. There are toilets throughout the building, including a children's toilet in the ''Mini Q'' exhibition. There are two dedicated baby change rooms - one near the café in the foyer and another in ''Mini Q''.

==Questacon Technology Learning Centre==
The Questacon Technology Learning Centre is located at the [[Royal Australian Mint]]'s former administration building in Deakin and houses more than 80 staff. All of the outreach programs and the exhibition developers, including researchers, designers and electronics, metal and wood shop staff are based there. There are also an exhibition area and spaces for booked technology workshops and holiday programs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221949/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/inventive-technology-in-mint-condition-20121228-2bzel.html] &lt;/ref&gt;

== Outreach programs ==
In addition to the exhibitions in Canberra, Questacon runs the ''Shell Questacon Science Circus'' and ''Q2U''. Past outreach programs run by Questacon include the ''[[Tenix]] Questacon Maths Squad'', ''Questacon Smart Moves'', ''Questacon Science Play'', ''Questacon Science Squad'' and a range of activities in remote Indigenous communities.

Questacon's common advertising slogan is "The smarter way to have fun."

=== Questacon Science Circus===
The ''Shell Questacon Science Circus'' is an outreach program of Questacon and is the most extensive science outreach program of its kind in the world. Each year, the ''Science Circus'' engages with more than 100,000 people, travels 25,000 kilometers, runs professional development courses for 600 teachers and visits about 30 remote [[Indigenous Australians|aboriginal]] communities as well as [[hospitals]], [[nursing homes]] and [[special school]]s.

The '' Questacon Science Circus'' is a partnership between Questacon, the [[Shell Oil Company]] Australia and the [[Australian National University]]. The ''Science Circus'' won the Prime Minister's Award for Community Business Partnerships in 2006.
Fifteen or sixteen science graduates staff the ''Science Circus'' as it travels, bringing lively presentations of science to towns and schools. The ''Science Circus'' also supports the teaching of science and technology by running practical and fun professional development workshops for teachers. While working for the ''Science Circus'', each presenter also completes a Masters of Science Communication Outreach through the [http://info.anu.edu.au/cpas/ Centre for the Public Awareness of Science] at the [[Australian National University]]. Coursework includes studies in print media, programme evaluation and exhibition design.

Every year the ''Science Circus'' presenters graduate from the course and a new team are selected. The first team graduated in 1988 and there are now over 300 ''Science Circus'' graduates. Graduates have contributed to programmes on [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] Radio, the [[Diffusion Science Radio Show]],  [[Cosmos Magazine]], and the [[Mr Science Show]] podcast.

'''R-type asteroids''' are moderately bright, relatively uncommon inner-belt [[asteroid]]s that are spectrally intermediate between the [[V-type asteroid|V]] and [[A-type asteroid]]s.  The spectrum shows distinct [[olivine]] and [[pyroxene]] features at 1 and 2 [[micrometre]]s, with a possibility of [[plagioclase]]. Shortwards of 0.7 μm the spectrum is very reddish.

The [[IRAS]] mission has classified [[4 Vesta]], [[246 Asporina]], [[349 Dembowska]], [[571 Dulcinea]] and [[937 Bethgea]] as type R; however, the re-classification of Vesta, the V archetype, is debatable.  Of these bodies, only [[349 Dembowska]] is recognized as being type R when all wavelengths are taken into account.

'''''Radiolab''''' is a radio program produced by [[WNYC]], a [[Public broadcasting|public radio station]] in New York City, and broadcast on public radio stations in the United States. The show is nationally syndicated and is available as a [[podcast]]. In 2008, live shows were first offered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiolab.org/articles/radiolab-live/ Radiolab Live] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011102518/http://www.radiolab.org/articles/radiolab-live/ |date=October 11, 2012 }}. WNYC, Retrieved October 11, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hosted by [[Jad Abumrad]] and [[Robert Krulwich]], the show focuses on topics of a scientific and philosophical nature. The show attempts to approach broad, difficult topics such as "time" and "morality" in an accessible and light-hearted manner and with a distinctive audio production style.

''Radiolab'' received a 2007 [[National Academies Communication Award]] "for their imaginative use of radio to make science accessible to broad audiences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = 'In Search Of Memory' Wins 2007 Best Book Award From The National Academies; WNYC's Radio Lab And Writer Carl Zimmer Also Awarded Top Prizes|publisher = The National Academies Office of News and Public Information|url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=10012007b|accessdate = 2010-04-26|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160807062008/http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=10012007b|archivedate = August 7, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has received two [[Peabody Award]]s; first in 2010 and again in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= WNYC's RADIOLAB Wins Peabody Award| publisher= WNYC| date= March 31, 2011| url= http://www.wnyc.org/press/radiolab-peabody/| deadurl= no| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304002111/http://www.wnyc.org/press/radiolab-peabody/| archivedate= March 4, 2016| df= mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Peabody2015 /&gt; In 2011, Abumrad received the [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur grant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =MacArthur 'Genius' Award Winner Jad Abumrad| url =http://www.thetakeaway.org/2011/sep/20/macarthur-genius-award-winner-jad-abumrad/| accessdate =2011-09-21| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20110925000031/http://www.thetakeaway.org/2011/sep/20/macarthur-genius-award-winner-jad-abumrad/| archivedate =September 25, 2011| df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ''Radiolab'' is a "limited run series", numerous seasons of five to ten episodes each have been produced.&lt;ref&gt;Transcribed from the introduction in the "Musical Language" MP3 podcast.{{cite web|title = Musical Language|publisher = WNYC Radio|url = http://www.radiolab.org/2007/sep/24/|accessdate = 2010-04-28|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100906210709/http://www.radiolab.org/2007/sep/24/|archivedate = September 6, 2010|df = mdy-all}} "From WNYC, New York Public Radio, this is Radiolab.

==History==
Having majored in [[experimental music]] composition and production at [[Oberlin College]], Jad Abumrad worked for New York City [[Pacifica Radio|Pacifica]] affiliate [[WBAI]] before landing a job freelancing for [[NPR|National Public Radio]] (NPR). In 2002 he produced a series of post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] radio documentaries called ''24 Hours at the Edge of Ground Zero'', and regularly contributed material to [[Studio 360]], both for WNYC.&lt;ref name="Abumrad"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiolab.org/about/|title=About the Staff|accessdate=2007-05-31|last=Abumrad|first=Jad|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905024300/http://www.radiolab.org/about/|archivedate=September 5, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first weekly episodes of ''Radiolab'' aired in May 2002, and each compiled two hours worth of NPR stories around a particular theme with between-story commentary from Jad Abumrad. These themes were not necessarily science-related, but tackled issues such as the [[death penalty]], [[religious fundamentalism]] and politics in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].

In 2003 Abumrad was given an assignment to interview [[ABC News]] science reporter Robert Krulwich and the two men discovered they had a lot in common: both were alumni of Oberlin College (though 25 years apart), and both had worked at WBAI before moving on to WNYC and NPR. They became fast friends and began collaborating on experimental radio pieces, the first of which they sent to [[Ira Glass]] for a proposed [[Flag Day]] episode of ''[[This American Life]]''. "It was horrible", Glass said of the tape in an interview with Abumrad and Krulwich. "It's just amazing that you were able to put together such a wonderful program after that."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2008/may/06/jad-and-robert-the-early-years/ Radiolab: "Jad and Robert: The Early Years"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117130401/http://www.radiolab.org/blogs/radiolab-blog/2008/may/06/jad-and-robert-the-early-years/ |date=January 17, 2011}}. WNYC, May 6, 2008. Retrieved 2010-8-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not to be dissuaded, Abumrad and Krulwich continued to collaborate. By 2004 ''Radiolab'' had become an hour-long, science-themed program characterized by Abumrad's unique [[sound design]] style, and Robert Krulwich appeared as a "guest host" on a program about [[time]] in early June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiolab.org/2007/may/29/ Radiolab: "Time"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011195237/http://www.radiolab.org/2007/may/29/ |date=October 11, 2012}}. WNYC, June 4, 2004. Retrieved 2010-8-6.&lt;/ref&gt; By the following episode ("Space", aired two weeks later), they were co-hosts, launching into the program's first official season in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radiolab.org/2007/may/07/ Radiolab: "Who Am I?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011201152/http://www.radiolab.org/2007/may/07/ |date=October 11, 2012 }}. WNYC, February 4, 2005. Retrieved 2010-8-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Formerly distributed nationally by NPR, WNYC began distributing the show in 2015. The change was noticeably marked by the omission of NPR's name in the show's opening audio sequence after the tagline, "You're listening to ''Radiolab''...from WNYC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://current.org/2015/05/wnyc-to-self-distribute-radiolab-on-the-media/|title=WNYC to self-distribute Radiolab, On the Media|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319112350/http://current.org/2015/05/wnyc-to-self-distribute-radiolab-on-the-media/|archivedate=March 19, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
''Radiolab'' is aired on over 300 radio stations across the U.S. Each episode is one hour long and tackles various philosophical and scientific topics. However, the show began in 2002 as a three-hour weekly show on New York City radio station WNYC's AM signal.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Walker|first=Rob|title=On 'Radiolab', the Sound of Science|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/magazine/mag-10Radiolab-t.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 7, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024184635/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/10/magazine/mag-10Radiolab-t.html?pagewanted=all|archivedate=October 24, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until 2004 that Krulwich began appearing as a regular guest and eventually as a co-host.

Each ''Radiolab'' episode is elaborately stylized. For instance, thematic—and often dissonant and atonal—music accompanies much of the commentary. In an April 2011 interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'', Abumrad explained the choice in music: "I put a lot of jaggedy sounds, little plurps and things, strange staccato, percussive things."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; In addition, previously recorded interview segments are interspersed in the show's live dialogue, adding a layered, call-and-response effect to the questions posed by the hosts. These recordings are often unedited and the interviewee's asides appear in the final product. In the same ''New York Times'' interview, Abumrad said, "You're trying to capture the rhythms and the movements, the messiness of the actual experience.... It sounds like life."&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; And unlike traditional journalism, in which the reader is given only access to the final article, not the interview, Abumrad added that ''Radiolab''{{'}}s process is more transparent.

As of June 15, 2009, the podcast offers full, hour-long episodes on a regular schedule with a variable number of podcasts in between "that follow some detour or left turn, explore music we love, take you to live events, and generally try to shake up your universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org/2009/jun/15/|title=Stochasticity|date=2009-06-15|publisher=WNYC Radio|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912171856/http://www.radiolab.org/2009/jun/15/|archivedate=September 12, 2010|deadurl=no|accessdate=2010-04-28|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These extra podcasts, referred to as "Shorts", are occasionally combined into full-length compilation episodes.

==Response==
''Radiolab'' has been widely acclaimed among listeners and critics alike. Around 1.8 million listeners tune in to the show, though most of them access it via podcasts.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; It has even been hailed, along with ''This American Life'', as one of the most innovative shows on American radio.&lt;ref&gt;Bottomley, Andrew (January 11, 2012).

In a 2007–2008 study by Multimedia Research (sponsored by the [[National Science Foundation]]), it was determined that over 95 percent of listeners reported that the science-based material featured on ''Radiolab'' was accessible. Additionally, upwards of 80 percent of listeners reported that the program's pace was exciting, and over 80 percent reported that the layering of interviews was engaging.&lt;ref&gt;Flagg, Barbara (May 19, 2009).

''Radiolab'' has won several awards, including two [[Peabody Award]]s for broadcast excellence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peabodyawards.com/results/null/1/2014/2014/title/asc|title=The Peabody Awards|website=www.peabodyawards.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416132609/http://www.peabodyawards.com/results/null/1/2014/2014/title/asc|archivedate=April 16, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/radiolab 70th Annual Peabody Awards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140913024445/http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/radiolab |date=September 13, 2014 }}, May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In spring 2011, Krulwich and Abumrad took the show on a live, national tour, selling out in cities such as New York, Seattle, and Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rainey|first=James|title=On the Media: 'Radiolab' takes its audio smörgasbord on the road|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/09/entertainment/la-et-onthemedia-20110309|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 9, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311232851/http://articles.latimes.com/2011/mar/09/entertainment/la-et-onthemedia-20110309|archivedate=March 11, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
On September 24, 2012, in a [[podcast]] titled "The Fact of the Matter", the program ran a segment about the [[yellow rain]] incidents in [[Laos]] and surrounding countries in the 1970s. Included in the story was an interview with [[Hmong people|Hmong]] veteran and refugee Eng Yang, with his niece [[Kao Kalia Yang]] serving as translator. After hearing the segment, Kao Kalia Yang and others complained that her uncle's viewpoints had been dismissed or edited out, that interviewer Robert Krulwich had treated them callously, and that the overall approach to the story had been [[racism|racist]]. The complaints prompted several rounds of allegation, apology, rebuttal, and edits to the podcast, as well as commentary in various sources such as the public radio newspaper ''Current''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/news_cut/archive/2012/10/5x8_-_102512.shtml|date=October 25, 2012|author=Bob Collins|title=The Yellow Rain fallout|accessdate=October 25, 2012|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|work=Bob Collins news cut|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026110858/http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/columns/news_cut/archive/2012/10/5x8_-_102512.shtml|archivedate=October 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.current.org/2012/10/search-for-truth-results-in-radiolab-apology/|date=October 24, 2012|author=Andrew Lapin|title=Search for 'truth' results in Radiolab apology|accessdate=October 25, 2012|publisher=American University School of Communication|work=Current|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026171850/http://www.current.org/2012/10/search-for-truth-results-in-radiolab-apology/|archivedate=October 26, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 12, 2017, ''Radiolab'' removed an episode titled "Truth Trolls" about the attacks on [[LaBeouf, Rönkkö &amp; Turner]]'s ''[[HEWILLNOTDIVIDE.US]]'' art project by [[far-right]] [[Internet troll|trolls]].&lt;ref name="truthtrolls-chen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://davechen.net/2017/08/radiolab-removes-truth-trolls-podcast-episode/|title=Radiolab removes its 'Truth Trolls' episode from podcast feed|website=David Chen|date=August 13, 2017|access-date=November 26, 2017|author=Chen, D.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180217135615/https://davechen.net/2017/08/radiolab-removes-truth-trolls-podcast-episode/|archivedate=February 17, 2018|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="truthtrolls-apology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/note-jad-about-truth-trolls/|title=A Note From Jad About "Truth Trolls"|website=Radiolab|date=August 12, 2017|access-date=November 26, 2017|author=Abumrad, J.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128181635/http://www.radiolab.org/story/note-jad-about-truth-trolls/|archivedate=November 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program had been criticized for appearing to condone the actions of extremist groups, with Turner condemning the reporting as "abhorrent and irresponsible" for describing the [[white supremacist]] vandalism and harassment they had been subjected to as "a really encouraging story" and "comforting."&lt;ref name="truthtrolls-chen"/&gt; Abumrad issued an apology for giving the impression that they "essentially condoned some pretty despicable ideology and behavior,"&lt;ref name="truthtrolls-apology"/&gt; while WNYC stated that they supported ''Radiolab'''s decision to remove the podcast, adding that "Radiolab unambiguously rejects the beliefs and actions of the trolls, and deeply regrets doing anything that would imply differently."&lt;ref name="nieman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/08/new-york-city-makes-the-claim-that-its-the-podcast-capital-of-the-world-but-is-that-a-good-thing/|title=New York City makes the claim that it's the podcast capital of the world (but is that a good thing?)|website=[[Nieman Foundation for Journalism|Nieman Lab]]|date=August 15, 2017|access-date=November 26, 2017|author=Quah, N.|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201041127/http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/08/new-york-city-makes-the-claim-that-its-the-podcast-capital-of-the-world-but-is-that-a-good-thing/|archivedate=December 1, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Radiolab'' episodes==
{{main|List of Radiolab episodes}}
Through stories, interviews, and [[thought experiment]]s, each hour-long episode usually deals with a specific topic and investigates it from several different angles. [[Sound design]] (not a common practice in modern radio programming), rapid dialog edits and sound effects are used to build a soundscape constructing an expository conversation, and usually feature brief, seemingly unscripted tangents. The episode credits are generally read by people who were interviewed or featured on the show, rather than by the hosts, while the program credits are read by listeners.

==''Radiolab'' live==
Episode 3 of [[List of Radiolab episodes#Season 12 (2013-2014)|Season 12]], titled "Apocalyptical – Live from the Paramount in Seattle", was recorded at one of the live show tour locations that ''Radiolab'' performed. Unlike most shows, this show was recorded both visually and auditorily, and can be viewed on their official website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiolab Live|url=http://www.radiolab.org/live/|website=Radiolab|accessdate=February 11, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211030544/http://www.radiolab.org/live/|archivedate=February 11, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour covered 21 cities and primarily focused on a speculative [[fringe theory]] regarding the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]] that has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. The fundamental new idea surrounding this theory is that when a large asteroid impacted the Earth, the asteroid driving into the ground caused the rock to become heated so extremely that it became gaseous. This "rock-gas" was then ejected outside the Earth's atmosphere and into [[Outer space|space]]. The rock-gas, after cooling into many tiny glass particles, was pulled back in by Earth's gravity. The majority of this "glass-rain" burned up in the Earth's atmosphere upon re-entry, causing the Earth's atmosphere to become superheated, killing most of the species living on the surface of the Earth within a matter of hours. The episode did not include any discussion of the problems with the theory or that it has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

== ''More Perfect'' ==
In June 2016, Radiolab launched their first "spinoff series" entitled ''More Perfect''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/podcast-dept/more-perfect-where-radiolab-meets-the-supreme-court|title=“More Perfect,” Where “Radiolab” Meets the Supreme Court|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wnyc.org/press/radiolab-more-perfect/60216/|title=WNYC Studios Introduces "Radiolab Presents: More Perfect"  {{!}} WNYC {{!}} New York Public Radio, Podcasts, Live Streaming Radio, News|website=WNYC|language=en|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series examines controversial and historic cases in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boulderweekly.com/entertainment/order-form-perfect-union/|title=In order to form a ‘More Perfect’ union... - Boulder Weekly|date=2018-03-01|work=Boulder Weekly|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.eugeneweekly.com/2018/08/02/what-we-are-downloading/|title=What We Are Downloading|date=2018-08-02|work=Eugene Weekly|access-date=2018-08-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's title comes from a line in the preamble of the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]]: "in Order to form a more perfect Union".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm|title=U.S. Senate: Constitution of the United States|website=www.senate.gov|access-date=2018-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Seven Wonders of the Industrial World''''' is a 7-part British [[docudrama]] television [[miniseries]] that originally aired from {{start date|2003|9|4|df=y}} to {{end date|2003|10|16|df=y}} on [[BBC]] and was later released on DVD. The programme examines seven engineering feats that occurred since the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The same feats are covered in a companion book of the same name by producer [[Deborah Cadbury]].

==Production==
The programmes were [[drama]]tised versions of actual events: actors played the various figures involved, reciting monologues and dialogue based on their letters and writings. It cost approximately ₤1 million to create the 7-part documentary. A book of the same name was released by [[television producer|producer]] [[Deborah Cadbury]], exploring the same feats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/victorians/seven_wonders_01.shtml|accessdate=2015-03-25|title=British History in depth: Seven Wonders of the Industrial World|author=Deborah Cadbury|date=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview7|title=Review: Seven Wonders of the Industrial World by Deborah Cadbury|work=the Guardian|author=Manjit Kumar|date=7 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Episodes==

===The Great Ship===
This episode focuses on the construction of the [[SS Great Eastern|SS ''Great Eastern'']], designed by [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] to be both the first ship entirely made out of iron and the most luxurious vessel of the day. However, whilst the ship itself was a marvel of shipbuilding, its construction was marred by accidents, scandal and misfortune, including a fire that practically destroyed the shipbuilder's yard, problems with the launch and financial scandals, all of which contributed towards Brunel's deteriorating health and comparatively early demise in 1859 and the popular belief that the ship was jinxed (a rumour leading to the legend of two bodies being found trapped in the hull upon its dismantling).

===The Brooklyn Bridge===
Focusing on the construction of the [[Brooklyn Bridge]], the episode examines the family that built it—[[John Augustus Roebling]], who designed the bridge; his son, [[Washington Roebling]], who took over construction following his father's death shortly after the project was announced; and Washington's wife [[Emily Roebling]], who taught herself engineering principles and took on the burden of her husband's work after his health was destroyed by the [[decompression sickness]] he suffered, owing to the length of time he spent working and overseeing matters in the pressured atmosphere of the underwater [[Caisson (engineering)|caisson]]s used to build the bridge.

===Bell Rock Lighthouse===
This episode tells the story of the construction in the early 19th century of the offshore [[Bell Rock Lighthouse|lighthouse]] on [[Inchcape|Bell Rock]], by the Scottish engineer [[Robert Stevenson (civil engineer)|Robert Stevenson]]. Bell or Inchcape Rock was underwater except for a couple of hours at low tide each day. It had claimed the lives of sailors and sunk ships for hundreds of years, but its situation caused difficulties in producing a design that would stand up to the storms and waves that ravaged the area while simultaneously housing the builders who worked on it during the few months of fair weather available each year.

===The Sewer King===
Set in London during the 1850s, this episode focusses on the construction of the [[London sewerage system]], built to replace the antiquated medieval system that was overworked and inadequate for the needs of the then-largest [[metropolis]] in the world, causing [[epidemic]]s of disease and a permanent foul stench to fill the air also known as the [[Great Stink]]. The episode follows the efforts and work of [[Joseph Bazalgette]], the brilliant engineer who designed the influential and modern sewer system that would purify the city, transform the streets above and would result in the end of the epidemics of [[cholera]] and [[typhoid]] that had ravaged the population—although, ironically not for the reasons that he initially thought. (This episode was [[television director|directed]] and [[television producer|produced]] by Bazalgette's great-great-grandson, [[Edward Bazalgette]])

===The Panama Canal===
This episode presents the French and American efforts to build [[Panama Canal|a canal]] through [[Panama]] to link the [[Atlantic Ocean]] with the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The first attempt to construct the canal by [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], the builder of the [[Suez Canal]], was abandoned because of [[tropical disease]]s (which killed over 22,000 men) and the difficulty of constructing a sea-level canal through the mountains. The resulting financial scandals not only ruined de Lesseps and many investors, it also brought down the French government. The episode then takes up the story seventeen years later when the United States took up the challenge. A concentrated effort succeeded in eradicating the causes of the tropical diseases, but the attempt to build a sea-level canal once again failed.  Instead the canal was built with [[lock (canal)|locks]].

===The Line===

The episode follows the construction of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], the first transcontinental [[railroad|rail]] system, which would unite the eastern and western seaboards of the [[United States]]. Started in [[Sacramento]] by [[Big 4 (Central Pacific Railroad)|a consortium]] of local shopkeepers with no experience in building a railroad, the episode follows their efforts to build from west to east through the forbidding [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains with the help of Chinese labourers whilst simultaneously following the efforts of the workers of the [[Union Pacific]] to build from east to west, and their problems in dealing with the lawless nature of the [[Wild West]], attacks by [[Native Americans in the United States|hostile Indians]], and [[Crédit Mobilier of America scandal|financial corruption and scandal]].

===The Hoover Dam===
The final episode focuses on the construction of the [[Hoover Dam]] during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, focussing in particular on the ruthless pace set by [[Frank Crowe]], the builder, whose eagerness to complete the project well before schedule and subsequent exploitation of the workforce (who were desperate for any employment and were forced to accept conditions of extreme hardship in the process) resulted in many deaths and the eventual construction of [[Boulder City|a new city]] to house the workers.

The '''South Asian river dolphin''' (''Platanista gangetica'') is an endangered freshwater or [[river dolphin]] found in the region of South Asia which is split into two subspecies, the Ganges river dolphin (''P. g. gangetica'')(~3,500 individuals) and the Indus river dolphin (''P. g. minor'')(~1,500 individuals). The Ganges river dolphin is primarily found in the [[Ganges]] and [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] Rivers and their tributaries in Bangladesh, India and Nepal, while the Indus river dolphin is now found only in the main channel of the [[Indus River]] in [[Pakistan]] and active channels connected to it between the Jinnah and Kotri barrages. From the 1970s until 1998, they were regarded as separate species; however, in 1998, their classification was changed from two separate species to subspecies of a single species (see taxonomy below). The Ganges river dolphin has been recognized by the government of [[India]] as its [[List of national animals|National Aquatic Animal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moef.nic.in/sites/default/files/dolphin-eng_0.pdf|title=Declaration of Gangetic Dolphin as National Aquatic Animal|last=|first=|date=10 May 2010|website=Government of India - Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change|publisher=|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the official animal of the Indian city of [[Guwahati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gangetic river dolphin to be city animal of Guwahati |url=http://timesofindia.com/home/environment/flora-fauna/Gangetic-river-dolphin-to-be-city-animal-of-Guwahati/articleshow/52623206.cms |newspaper=The Times of India |date=6 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indus river dolphin has been named as the [[List of national animals|National Mammal]] of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/national_symbols.html|title=The Official Web Gateway to Pakistan|website=www.pakistan.gov.pk|access-date=2016-10-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128073024/http://www.pakistan.gov.pk/national_symbols.html|archivedate=28 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The species was described by two separate authors, Lebeck and Roxburgh, in 1801, and it is unclear to whom the original description should be ascribed.&lt;ref name=Kinze&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kinze, C.C. | year = 2000 | title = Rehabilitation of ''Platanista gangetica'' (Lebeck, 1801) as the valid scientific name of the Ganges dolphin | url = http://www.repository.naturalis.nl/document/44083 | journal = [[Zoologische Mededelingen]] | volume = 74 | pages = 193–203 | publisher=National Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the 1970s, the South Asian river dolphin was regarded as a single species. The two subspecies are geographically separate and have not interbred for many hundreds if not thousands of years. Based on differences in skull structure, vertebrae and lipid composition scientists declared the two populations as separate species in the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=Pilleri&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pilleri, G. | author2 = G. Marcuzzi | author3 = O.

The latest analyses of mitochondrial DNA of the two populations did not display the variances needed to support their classification as separate species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|year=2015|title=One Species or Two?

An assessment of divergence rates in [[mitochondrial DNA]] of the two subspecies indicates that they diverged from a common ancestor around 550,000 years ago. This ancestor is thought to have been a marine Platanistid inhabiting the epi-continental seas in South Asia during the sea level rises in the middle [[Miocene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2014|title=One Species or Two?

== Description ==
The South Asian river dolphin has the long, pointed nose characteristic of all river dolphins. Their teeth are visible in both the upper and lower jaws even when the mouth is closed. The teeth of young animals are almost an inch long, thin and curved; however, as animals age, the teeth undergo considerable changes and in mature adults become square, bony, flat disks. The snout thickens towards its end. Navigation and hunting are carried out using [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]].&lt;ref name="EDGE" /&gt; They are unique among cetaceans in that they swim on their sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usdeptcommercepub/138/ | journal=Science | series=New Series | title=Blind River Dolphin: First Side-Swimming Cetacean | volume=166 | issue=3911 | date=12 December 1969 | pages=1408–1410}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body is a brownish color and stocky at the middle. The species has only a small, triangular lump in the place of a [[dorsal fin]]. The flippers and tail are thin and large in relation to the body size, which is about 2-2.2 meters in males and 2.4-2.6 m in females. The oldest recorded animal was a 28-year-old male, 199&amp;nbsp;cm in length.&lt;ref&gt;Kasuya, T., 1972. Some information on the growth of the Ganges dolphin with a comment on the Indus dolphin. Sci. Rep. Whales Res. Inst., 24: 87-108&lt;/ref&gt; Mature females are larger than males. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is expressed after females reach about {{convert|150|cm|abbr=on}}; the female [[Rostrum (anatomy)|rostrum]] continues to grow after the male rostrum stops growing, eventually reaching approximately {{convert|20|cm|abbr=on}} longer.[[File:Platanista gangetica skull cast.jpg|thumb|left|Skull cast]]

=== Life Cycle ===
[[File:Ganges river dolphin skeleton.jpg|left|thumb|Ganges river dolphin skeleton specimen exhibited in [[Pisa Charterhouse|Museo di storia naturale e del territorio dell'Università di Pisa]]]]Births may take place year round, but appear to be concentrated between December to January and March to May.&lt;ref name="CMS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cms.int/reports/small_cetaceans/data/P_gangetica/p_gangetica.htm|title=Platanista gangetica (Roxburgh, 1801)|author=Boris Culik|publisher=CMS Report|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611110231/http://www.cms.int/reports/small_cetaceans/data/P_gangetica/p_gangetica.htm|archivedate=11 June 2011|deadurl=yes|accessdate=24 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gestation is thought to be approximately 9–10 months. After around one year, juveniles are weaned and they reach sexual maturity at about 10 years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/site/accounts/information/Platanista_gangetica.html|title=Platanista gangetica|author=Swinton, J.|author2=W. Gomez|publisher=Animal Diversity Web|accessdate=24 July 2011|author3=P. Myer|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the monsoon, South Asian river dolphins tend to migrate to [[tributaries]] of the main river systems.&lt;ref name="CMS" /&gt; Occasionally, individuals swim along with their beaks emerging from the water,&lt;ref name="wdcs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdcs.org/|title=The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and they may "breach"; jumping partly or completely clear of the water and landing on their sides.&lt;ref name="wdcs" /&gt;

===Diet===
The South Asian river dolphin relies on [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]] to find prey due to their poor eyesight. Their extended rostrum is advantageous in detecting hidden or hard to find prey items. The prey is held in their jaw and swallowed. Their teeth is used as a clamp rather than a chewing mechanism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dolphins-world.com/ganges-river-dolphin/|title=Ganges River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica gangetica)|website=Dolphins-World|access-date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The species feeds on a variety of [[shrimp]] and fish, including [[carp]] and [[catfish]]. The Ganges subspecies may take birds and turtles. They are usually encountered on their own or in loose aggregations; the dolphins do not form tight interacting groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dolphins-world.com/indus-river-dolphin/|title=Indus River Dolphin (Platanista gangetica minor)|publisher=Dolphins-World|access-date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Vision ===
The species lacks a [[crystalline eye lens]] and has evolved a flat [[cornea]]. The combination of these traits makes the eye incapable of forming clear images on the [[retina]] and renders the dolphin effectively blind, but the eye may still serve as a light receptor. The retina contains a densely packed [[Receptor layer of retina|receptor layer]], a very thin bipolar and [[ganglion cell layer]], and a tiny [[optic nerve]] (with only a few hundred optic fibers) that are sufficient for the retina to act as a light-gathering component.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Herald|first=Earl S.|last2=Brownell|first2=Robert L.|last3=Frye|first3=Fredric L.|last4=Morris|first4=Elkan J.|last5=Evans|first5=William E.|last6=Scott|first6=Alan B.|date=1969|title=Blind River Dolphin: First Side-Swimming Cetacean|journal=Science|volume=166|issue=3911|pages=1408–1410|jstor=1727285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dense pigmentation in the skin overlying the eye prevents light from reaching the retina from any entrance except for a pinhole sphincter-like structure. This structure is controlled by a cone-shaped muscle layer that extends from the posterior eye orbit to the overlying eye skin layer. The sphincter-like structure is capable of sensing light, and may be able to sense the direction from where the light was emitted. However, the muddy waters, or low light conditions, that the ''Platanista gangetica'' inhabit negate the use of the little vision that remains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Vocalization ===
The Ganges subspecies shows object-avoidance behavior in both the consistently heavily murky waters of its habitat and in clear water in captivity, suggesting that it is capable of using echolocation effectively to navigate and forage for prey.&lt;ref name=:0/&gt; However, there is limited information on how extensively vocalization is utilized between individuals. This subspecies of river dolphin is capable of performing whistles but rarely does so, suggesting that the whistle is a spontaneous sound and not a form of communication. The Ganges river dolphin most typically makes echolocation sounds such as clicks, bursts, and twitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mizue|first=Kazuhiro|last2=Takemura|first2=Akira|last3=Nishiwaki|first3=Masaharu|date=1971|title=The Underwater Sound of Ganges River Dolphins (Platanista Gangetica)|url=http://www.icrwhale.org/pdf/SC023123-128.pdf|journal=The Scientific Reports of the Whales Research Institute|volume=23|pages=123 - 128|via=ICR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced pulse trains are similar in wave form and frequency to the echolocation patterns of the [[Amazon river dolphin]]. Both species regularly produce frequencies lower than 15kHz and the maximum frequency is thought to fall somewhere between 15 to 60kHz.&lt;ref name=:0/&gt;

Echolocation is also utilized for population counts by using acoustic surveying. This method is still being developed and is not heavily utilized due to cost and technical skill requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richman|first=Nadia I.|last2=Gibbons|first2=James M.|last3=Turvey|first3=Samuel T.|last4=Akamatsu|first4=Tomonari|last5=Ahmed|first5=Benazir|last6=Mahabub|first6=Emile|last7=Smith|first7=Brian D.|last8=Jones|first8=Julia P.

==Distribution and habitat==
The South Asian river dolphins are native to the freshwater river systems located in [[Nepal]], [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=iucn /&gt; They can be most commonly found in water with high abundance of prey and reduced flow.&lt;ref name=EDGE&gt;{{cite web|title=South Asian river dolphin (Platanista gangetica)|url=http://www.edgeofexistence.org/mammals/species_info.php?id=65|publisher=EDGE|accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They migrate seasonally—downstream in colder conditions with lower water levels and upstream in warmer conditions with higher water levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sinha|first=Ravindra K.|last2=Kannan|first2=Kurunthachalam|date=December 2014|title=Ganges River Dolphin: An Overview of Biology, Ecology, and Conservation Status in India|journal=Ambio|volume=43|issue=8|pages=1029–1046|doi=10.1007/s13280-014-0534-7|issn=0044-7447|pmc=4235892|pmid=24924188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ganges subspecies (''P. g. gangetica'') can be found along the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna and Karnaphuli-Sangu river systems of Bangladesh and India, although its range formerly extended to Nepal.&lt;ref name=EDGE /&gt; A small subpopulation can be still found on the [[Ghaghara River]] and possibly the Sapta Kosi River.

The Indus subspecies (''P. g. minor'') today only occurs in a 1,000&amp;nbsp;km stretch of the Indus River itself and several connecting channels between the Jinnah and Kotri barrages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwfpak.org/species/indus_dolphin.php|title=Indus River Dolphin|publisher=WWF Pakistan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past it was to be found along 3,400&amp;nbsp;km of the Indus, its tributaries and neighboring river systems. Its range has contracted by about 80% since 1870.&lt;ref name=Braulik/&gt; Since the two originally inhabited river systems - between the Sukkur and Guddu barrage in Pakistan's Sind Province, and in the Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provinces - are not connected in any way, it remains unknown how they were colonized. It is improbable that the river dolphins made it from one river to another through the sea route since the two estuaries are very far apart. A possible explanation is that several north Indian rivers like the [[Sutlej]] and [[Yamuna]] changed their channels in ancient times while retaining their dolphin populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanyal|first=Sanjeev|title=Land of the Seven Rivers: A Brief History of India's Geography|year=2012|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
{{see also|Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary}}
A 2017 population assessment estimated less than 5,000 individuals for the species as a whole, of which about 3,500 belong to the Ganges subspecies and about 1,500 to the Indus subspecies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-12-01|title=Review of status, threats, and conservation management options for the endangered Indus River blind dolphin|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715300999|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=192|pages=30–41|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2015.09.008|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the underlying surveys are temporally patchy and believed to contain a large amount of uncertainty. Current population trends are unclear. A demonstrable increase in the main river population of the Indus subspecies between 1974 and 2008 may have been driven by permanent immigration from upstream tributaries, where the species no longer occurs.&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

International trade is prohibited by the listing of the South Asian river dolphin on Appendix I of the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]] (CITES).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CITES|url=http://www.cites.org/|publisher=CITES|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is protected under the Indian Wildlife Act, although these legislations require stricter enforcement.&lt;ref name=CMS /&gt; Both subspecies are listed by the [[IUCN]] as endangered on their [[Red List of Threatened Species]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; The Indus river dolphin is listed as endangered by the US government [[National Marine Fisheries Service]] under the [[Endangered Species Act]].

The species is listed on Appendix I&lt;ref name="Appendices"&gt;"[http://www.cms.int/documents/appendix/Appendices_COP9_E.pdf Appendix I and Appendix II] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611112003/http://www.cms.int/documents/appendix/Appendices_COP9_E.pdf |date=11 June 2011 }}" of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Appendix II&lt;ref name="Appendices" /&gt; of the [[Convention on Migratory Species|Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals]] (CMS).

The Ministry of Environment and Forest declared the Gangetic dolphin the national aquatic animal of India. A stretch of the Ganges River between Sultanganj and Kahlgaon in Bihar has been declared a dolphin sanctuary and named [[Vikramshila Gangetic Dolphin Sanctuary]] (VGDS), the first such protected area.

The Uttar Pradesh government in India is propagating ancient Hindu texts in hopes of raising the community support to save the dolphins from disappearing. One of the lines being versed from Valimiki’s Ramayan, highlighted the force by which the Ganges emerged from Lord Shivji’s locks and along with this force came many species such as animals, fish and the Shishumaar—the dolphin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Hinduism Continues to Save Dolphins in India|url=http://www.chakranews.com/how-hinduism-continues-to-save-dolphins-in-india/964|publisher=The Chakra News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human interaction==

[[File:GangeticDolphin.jpg|thumb|Gangetic dolphin, 1894 book illustration]]

Both subspecies have been adversely affected by human use of river systems in South Asia. Entanglement in fishing nets as by-catch can cause significant damage to local populations, and individuals are taken each year by hunters; their oil and meat used as a liniment, as an [[aphrodisiac]], and as bait for [[catfish]]. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also be a contributing factor towards population decline, as these chemicals are bio-magnified in the bodies of the dolphins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kannan|first=Kurunthachalam|date=1997|title=Sources and Accumulation of Butyltin Compounds in Ganges River Dolphin, Platanista gangetica|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/46348097/Sources_and_Accumulation_of_Butyltin_Com20160608-24155-1njpezf.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1528180071&amp;Signature=YAoptbdAxAazWHbn6EU6wrgisok%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DSources_and_accumulation_of_butyltin_com.pdf|journal=Applied Organometallic Chemistry|volume=11|pages=223–230|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed [[gene pool]] in which dolphins can breed.&lt;ref name=Braulik&gt;{{cite journal | author = Braulik, G.

=== Non-human personhood ===
On 20 May 2013 India’s Ministry of Environment and Forests declared dolphins ‘non-human persons’ and as such has forbidden their captivity for entertainment purposes; keeping dolphins in captivity must satisfy certain legal prerequisites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/kids/dolphins-get-their-due/article6119256.ece|title=Dolphins get their due|last=Gautama|first=Madhulika|date=2014-06-16|newspaper=The Hindu|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technology society and life''' or '''technology and culture''' refers to cyclical co-dependence, co-influence, and co-production of [[technology]] and [[society]] upon the other (technology upon culture, and vice versa). This synergistic relationship occurred from the dawn of humankind, with the invention of simple tools and continues into modern technologies such as the [[printing press]] and [[computer]]s. The academic discipline studying the impacts of science, technology, and society, and vice versa is called [[science and technology studies]].

==Pre-historical==
The importance of [[stone tool]]s, circa 2.5 million years ago, is considered fundamental in the human development in the [[hunting hypothesis]].

Primatologist, [[Richard Wrangham]], theorizes that the [[control of fire by early humans]] and the associated development of [[cooking]] was the spark that radically changed human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Catching Fire: How Cooking Made Us Human]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Texts such as ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]'' suggest that early advances in plant agriculture and husbandry fundamentally shifted the way that collective groups of individuals, and eventually societies, developed.

==Modern examples and effects==
Technology has become a huge part in society and day-to-day life. When societies know more about the development in a technology, they become able to take advantage of it. When an innovation achieves a certain point after it has been presented and promoted, this technology becomes part of the society.The use of technology in education provides students with technology literacy, information literacy, capacity for life-long learning and other skills necessary for the 21st century workplace. &lt;ref name=Puricelli&gt;{{harv|Puricelli|2011|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Digital technology]] has entered each process and activity made by the [[social system]]. In fact, it constructed another worldwide [[communication system]] in addition to its origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rückriem|2009|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1982 study by ''[[The New York Times]]'' described a technology assessment study by the [[Institute for the Future]], "peering into the future of an electronic world." The study focused on the emerging videotex industry, formed by the marriage of two older technologies, communications and computing. It estimated that 40 percent of American households will have two-way videotex service by the end of the century. By comparison, it took television 16 years to penetrate 90 percent of households from the time commercial service was begun.

Since the creation of [[computer]]s achieved an entire better approach to transmit and store [[data]]. Digital technology became commonly used for downloading music and watching movies at home either by [[DVD]]s or purchasing it online.
Digital music records are not quite the same as traditional recording media. Obviously, because [[digital media|digital]] ones are reproducible, portable and free.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Katz|2010|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several states started to implement education technology in schools, universities and colleges. According to the statistics, in the early beginnings of 1990s the use of Internet in schools was ,on average, 2-3%. Continuously, by the end of 1990s the evolution of technology increases rapidly and reaches to 60%, and by the year of 2008 nearly 100% of schools use Internet on educational form. According to ISTE researchers, technological improvements can lead to numerous achievements in classrooms. E-learning system, collaboration of students on project based learning, and technological skills for future results in motivation of students. 

Although these previous examples only show a few of the positive aspects of technology in society, there are negative side effects as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Lynden|first1 = Burke|title = Generation Y Heavily Dependent On Technology, Promotes Laziness|url = http://www.thejambar.com/generation-y-heavily-dependent-on-technology-promotes-laziness/|website = The Jambar|accessdate = 28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this virtual realm, social media platforms such as [[Instagram]], [[Instagram|Facebook]], and [[Snapchat]] have altered the way [[Millennials|Generation Y culture]] is understanding the world and thus how they view themselves. In recent years, there has been more research on the development of social media depression in users of sites like these. "Facebook Depression" is when users are so affected by their friends' posts and lives that their own jealousy depletes their sense of self-worth. They compare themselves to the posts made by their peers and feel unworthy or monotonous because they feel like their lives are not nearly as exciting as the lives of others.&lt;ref name=Puricelli/&gt;

Another instance of the negative effects of technology in society, is how quickly it is pushing younger generations into maturity. With the world at their fingertips, children can learn anything they wish to. But with the uncensored sources from the [[internet]], without proper supervision, children can be exposed to explicit material at inappropriate ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Woollaston|first1=Victoria|title=Kids ARE growing up faster today - and it's all down to technology|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2834559/Kids-growing-faster-today-s-technology-Facebook-mobile-phones-causing-young-people-mature-quickly-poll-reveals.html|accessdate=28 October 2015|agency=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comes in the forms of premature interests in experimenting with makeup or opening an email account or social media page—all of which can become a window for predators and other dangerous entities that threaten a child's innocence. Technology has a serious effect on youth's health. The overuse of technology is said to be associated with sleep deprivation which is linked to obesity and poor academic performance in the lives of adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Saudi med J. 2016 pages 436-439&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics and technological development==
[[File:Doel Kerncentrale.JPG|thumb|Nuclear reactor, [[Doel]], [[Belgium]]]]

In ancient history, [[economics]] began when spontaneous exchange of goods and services was replaced over time by deliberate trade structures. Makers of arrowheads, for example, might have realized they could do better by concentrating on making arrowheads and barter for other needs. Regardless of goods and services bartered, some amount of technology was involved&amp;mdash;if no more than in the making of shell and bead jewelry. Even the shaman's potions and sacred objects can be said to have involved some technology. So, from the very beginnings, technology can be said to have spurred the development of more elaborate economies.Technology is seen as primary source in economic development.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Andrey Korotayev]], Artemy Malkov, and Daria Khaltourina. [https://www.academia.edu/35443515/Introduction_to_Social_Macrodynamics_Compact_Macromodels_of_the_World_System_Growth._Moscow_KomKniga_2006 ''Introduction to Social Macrodynamics: Compact Macromodels of the World System Growth''] {{ISBN|5-484-00414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology advancement and economic growth are related to each other.The level of technology is important to determine the economic growth.It is the technological process which keeps the economy moving.

In the modern world, superior technologies, resources, geography, and history give rise to robust economies; and in a well-functioning, robust economy, economic excess naturally flows into greater use of technology. Moreover, because technology is such an inseparable part of human society, especially in its economic aspects, funding sources for (new) technological endeavors are virtually illimitable. However, while in the beginning, technological investment involved little more than the time, efforts, and skills of one or a few men, today, such investment may involve the collective labor and skills of many millions.

===Funding===
Consequently, the sources of funding for large technological efforts have dramatically narrowed, since few have ready access to the collective labor of a whole society, or even a large part. It is conventional to divide up funding sources into governmental (involving whole, or nearly whole, social [[Organization|enterprises]]) and private (involving more limited, but generally more sharply focused) business or individual enterprises.

====Government funding for new technology====
The government is a major contributor to the development of new technology in many ways. In the United States alone, many government agencies specifically invest billions of dollars in new technology.

[In 1980, the UK government invested just over six million pounds in a four-year program, later extended to six years, called the [[Microelectronics Education Programme]] (MEP), which was intended to give every school in Britain at least one computer, software, training materials, and extensive teacher training. Similar programs have been instituted by governments around the world.]

Technology has frequently been driven by the military, with many modern applications developed for the military before they were adapted for civilian use. However, this has always been a two-way flow, with industry often developing and adopting a technology only later adopted by the military.

Entire government agencies are specifically dedicated to research, such as America's [[National Science Foundation]], the United Kingdom's [[List of UK government scientific research institutes|scientific research institutes]], America's [[Small Business Innovation Research|Small Business Innovative Research]] effort. Many other government agencies dedicate a major portion of their budget to research and development.

====Private funding====
[[Research and development]] is one of the smallest areas of investments made by corporations toward new and innovative technology.
&lt;!--source needed--&gt;

Many foundations and other nonprofit organizations contribute to the development of technology. In the [[OECD]], about two-thirds of [[research and development]] in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 98 percent and 10 percent, respectively, by [[University|universities]] and government. But in poorer countries such as [[Portugal]] and [[Mexico]] the industry contribution is significantly less. The U.S. government spends more than other countries on military research and development, although the proportion has fallen from about 30 percent in the 1980s to less than 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723051956/http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/45/24236156.pdf |date=July 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2009 founding of [[Kickstarter]] allows individuals to receive funding via [[crowdsourcing]] for many technology related products including both new physical creations as well as documentaries, films, and webseries that focus on [[technology management]]. This circumvents the corporate or government oversight most inventors and artists struggle against but leaves the accountability of the project completely with the individual receiving the funds.

===Other economic considerations===
* [[Appropriate technology]], sometimes called "intermediate" technology, more of [[Index of economics articles|an economics concern]], refers to compromises between central and expensive technologies of [[Developed country|developed nations]] and those that [[Developing country|developing nations]] find most effective to deploy given an excess of labour and scarcity of cash.
*[[Persuasive technology|Persuasion technology]]: In [[economics]], definitions or assumptions of progress or [[economic growth|growth]] are often related to one or more assumptions about technology's economic influence. Challenging prevailing assumptions about technology and its usefulness has led to alternative ideas like [[uneconomic growth]] or [[Quality of life|measuring well-being]]. These, and economics itself, can often be described as technologies, specifically, as persuasion technology.

* [[Technology acceptance model]]

* [[Technology transfer]]

==Sociological factors and effects==
{{See also|Social construction of technology}}

===Values===
The implementation of technology influences the [[Value (ethics)#Personal and cultural values|values]] of a society by changing expectations and realities. The implementation of technology is also influenced by values. There are (at least) three major, interrelated values that inform, and are informed by, technological innovations:
*[[Mechanism (philosophy)|Mechanistic world view]]: Viewing the universe as a collection of parts (like a machine), that can be individually analyzed and understood.&lt;ref name = McGinn&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a form of [[reductionism]] that is rare nowadays. However, the "neo-mechanistic world view" holds that nothing in the universe cannot be understood by the human intellect. Also, while all things are greater than the sum of their parts (e.g., even if we consider nothing more than the information involved in their combination), in principle, even this excess must eventually be understood by human intelligence. That is, no [[Divinity|divine]] or [[Vitalism|vital]] principle or essence is involved.
*[[Efficiency (economics)|Efficiency]]: A value, originally applied only to machines, but now applied to all aspects of society, so that each element is expected to attain a higher and higher percentage of its maximal possible performance, output, or ability.
*Social [[progress]]: The belief that there is such a thing as social progress, and that, in the main, it is beneficent. Before the [[Industrial Revolution]], and the subsequent explosion of technology, almost all societies believed in a [[cyclical theory]] of social movement and, indeed, of all history and the universe. This was, obviously, based on the cyclicity of the seasons, and an agricultural economy's and society's strong ties to that cyclicity. Since much of the world is closer to their agricultural roots, they are still much more amenable to cyclicity than progress in history. This may be seen, for example, in Prabhat Rainjan Sarkar's modern social cycles theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metafuture.org/sarkar/prabhat.htm | title=Prabhat rainjan sarkar's social cycles, world unity and peace; Renaissance 2000 honoring Sarkar's 75th Anniversary, LA 1 | work=Metafuture.org | accessdate=July 6, 2016 | author=Galtung, Johan}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a more westernized version of social cyclicity, see ''Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069'' (Paperback) by Neil Howe and William Strauss; Harper Perennial; Reprint edition (September 30, 1992); {{ISBN|0-688-11912-3}}, and subsequent books by these authors.

====Institutions and groups====
Technology often enables organizational and bureaucratic group structures that otherwise and heretofore were simply not possible. Examples of this might include:
*The rise of very large organizations: e.g., governments, the military, health and social welfare institutions, supranational corporations.
*The commercialization of leisure: sports events, products, etc. (McGinn)
*The almost instantaneous dispersal of information (especially news) and entertainment around the world.

===International===
Technology enables greater knowledge of international issues, values, and cultures. Due mostly to mass transportation and mass media, the world seems to be a much smaller place, due to the following:{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}
*Globalization of ideas
*Embeddedness of values
*Population growth and control

==Environment==
{{Main article|Environmental technology}}
Technology provides an understanding, and an appreciation for the world around us.

Most modern technological processes produce unwanted by products in addition to the desired products, which is known as industrial waste and pollution. While most material waste is re-used in the industrial process, many forms are released into the environment, with negative environmental side effects, such as pollution and lack of sustainability. Different social and political systems establish different balances between the value they place on additional goods versus the disvalues of waste products and pollution. Some technologies are designed specifically with the environment in mind, but most are designed first for economic or ergonomic effects. Historically, the value of a clean environment and more efficient productive processes has been the result of an increase in the wealth of society, because once people are able to provide for their basic needs, they are able to focus on less tangible goods such as clean air and water.

The effects of technology on the environment are both obvious and subtle. The more obvious effects include the depletion of nonrenewable natural resources (such as petroleum, coal, ores), and the added [[pollution]] of air, water, and land. The more subtle effects include debates over long-term effects (e.g., global warming, deforestation, natural habitat destruction, coastal wetland loss.)

Each wave of technology creates a set of waste previously unknown by humans: [[toxic waste]], [[radioactive waste]], [[electronic waste]].

One of the main problems is the lack of an effective way to remove these pollutants on a large scale expediently. In nature, organisms "recycle" the wastes of other organisms, for example, plants produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis, oxygen-breathing organisms use oxygen to metabolize food, producing carbon dioxide as a by-product, which plants use in a process to make sugar, with oxygen as a waste in the first place. No such mechanism exists for the removal of technological wastes.

==Construction and shaping==

===Choice===
Society also controls technology through the choices it makes. These choices not only include consumer demands; they also include:
*the channels of distribution, how do products go from raw materials to consumption to disposal;
*the cultural beliefs regarding style, freedom of choice, consumerism, materialism, etc.;
*the economic values we place on the environment, individual wealth, government control, capitalism, etc.

According to Williams and Edge,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Williams|Edge|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; the construction and shaping of technology includes the concept of choice (and not necessarily conscious choice). Choice is inherent in both the design of individual artifacts and systems, and in the making of those artifacts and systems.

The idea here is that a single technology may not emerge from the unfolding of a predetermined logic or a single determinant, technology could be a garden of forking paths, with different paths potentially leading to different technological outcomes. This is a position that has been developed in detail by [[Judy Wajcman]]. Therefore, choices could have differing implications for society and for particular social groups.

===Autonomous technology===
In one line of thought, technology develops autonomously, in other words, technology seems to feed on itself, moving forward with a force irresistible by humans. To these individuals, technology is "inherently dynamic and self-augmenting."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McGinn|1991|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Ellul]] is one proponent of the irresistibleness of technology to humans. He espouses the idea that humanity cannot resist the temptation of expanding our knowledge and our technological abilities. However, he does not believe that this seeming autonomy of technology is inherent. But the perceived autonomy is because humans do not adequately consider the responsibility that is inherent in technological processes.

[[Langdon Winner]] critiques the idea that [[Radovan Richta|technological evolution]] is essentially beyond the control of individuals or society in his book Autonomous Technology. He argues instead that the apparent autonomy of technology is a result of "technological somnambulism," the tendency of people to uncritically and unreflectively embrace and utilize new technologies without regard for their broader social and political effects.

===Government===
Individuals rely on governmental assistance to control the side effects and negative consequences of technology.
*Supposed independence of government. An assumption commonly made about the government is that their governance role is neutral or independent. However, some argue that governing is a political process, so government will be influenced by political winds of influence. In addition, because government provides much of the funding for technological research and development, it has a vested interest in certain outcomes. Other point out that the world's biggest ecological disasters, such as the [[Aral Sea]], [[Chernobyl]], and [[Lake Karachay]] have been caused by government projects, which are not accountable to consumers.
*Liability. One means for controlling technology is to place responsibility for the harm with the agent causing the harm. Government can allow more or less legal liability to fall to the organizations or individuals responsible for damages.
*Legislation. A source of controversy is the role of industry versus that of government in maintaining a clean environment. While it is generally agreed that industry needs to be held responsible when pollution harms other people, there is disagreement over whether this should be prevented by legislation or civil courts, and whether ecological systems as such should be protected from harm by governments.

Recently, the social shaping of technology has had new influence in the fields of [[E-Science|e-science]] and [[e-social science]] in the United Kingdom, which has made centers focusing on the social shaping of [[Science and technology studies|science and technology]] a central part of their funding programs.

'''Thomas Patten Stafford''' (born September 17, 1930; [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt Gen]], [[United States Air Force|USAF]], Ret.) is an American former [[United States Air Force|Air Force officer]], [[test pilot]], and [[NASA]] [[astronaut]].

After graduating from the [[United States Naval Academy]], Stafford commissioned in the [[United States Air Force]], flying the [[F-86 Sabre]] prior becoming a test pilot.  He was selected to become an astronaut in 1962, and flew aboard [[Gemini 6A]] and [[Gemini 9]]. In 1969, Stafford was the Commander of [[Apollo 10]], the second manned mission to orbit the [[Moon]] and the first to fly a [[Lunar Module]] in lunar orbit, descending to an altitude of nine miles.

In 1975, Stafford was the commander of the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]] flight, the first joint U.S.-[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] space mission. Stafford was a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] at the time of the mission, becoming the first general officer to fly in space, as well as the first member of his Naval Academy class to pin on the first, second, and third stars of a general officer.  He made six rendezvous in space and logged 507 hours of space flight. He has flown over 120 different types of fixed wing and [[rotary aircraft]] and three different types of [[spacecraft]].

== Early years and education ==
Thomas Patten Stafford was born on September 17, 1930, in [[Weatherford, Oklahoma]] to Thomas Sabert Stafford, a dentist, and Mary Ellen Stafford ({{nee|Patten}}), a former teacher. Thomas Sabert Stafford was diagnosed with skin cancer in 1944, and passed away on June 22, 1948. Mary Stafford remained in Weatherford until her death in August 1987. Stafford became interested in aviation following the start of World War II, as the nearby city [[El Reno]] has an Army Air Corps training base.  Stafford began making model airplanes, and made his first flight  at the age of 14 in a [[Piper Cub]]. He attended [[Weatherford High School (Oklahoma)|Weatherford High School]] and graduated in 1948.&lt;ref name="wehavecapture"&gt;{{cite book

In his senior year of high school, Stafford was recruited to play football at the [[University of Oklahoma]], where he had received a [[Navy ROTC]] scholarship. Stafford applied to the [[United States Naval Academy]], and was accepted to the class of 1952.  Stafford intended to play football for the [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy Midshipman]], but received a career-ending knee injury during a preseason practice session.  After his freshman year, he sailed aboard the [[battleship]] {{USS|Missouri|BB-63|6}}, where his roommate was his future Apollo 10 Command Module Pilot, [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]]. Following his second year, Stafford spent a summer at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], where he was exposed to naval aviation and flew in the [[North American T-6 Texan|SNJ Trainer]]. On a trip home to Weatherford, Stafford began dating his future wife, Faye Shoemaker. After his third year, he served aboard {{USS|Burdo|APD-133|6}}, a [[destroyer]] escorting USS ''Missouri''. While visiting home during his fourth year, Stafford became engaged to Faye in December 1951. In the spring of 1952, he was selected in a lottery to join the U.S. Air Force upon graduation.{{refn|group=note|The [[United States Air Force Academy|U.S. Air Force Academy]] was not yet established at this time.}} Stafford graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree with honors in 1952, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|8–13}}&lt;ref name="usafbio"&gt;{{cite web

==Military service==
Prior to graduating high school, Stafford served in the [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division]] in the [[Oklahoma National Guard]]. Soon after, he transferred to the [[158th Field Artillery Regiment]], where he plotted targets for artillery fires.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|6}}

Stafford attended the first phase of pilot training at [[Greenville Air Force Base (Mississippi)|Greenville AFB]], [[San Marcos Air Force Base|San Marcos AFB]], and [[Connally Air Force Base|Connally AFB]], where he flew the [[North American T-6 Texan|T-6 Texan]] and the [[T-33 Shooting Star]]. While on a training mission at San Marcos AFB, he was involved in a mid-air collision with another student pilot. Stafford and his instructor were able to land successfully, but the other student pilot was killed. He graduated from pilot training on September 1, 1953, and moved to [[Tyndall Air Force Base|Tyndall AFB]] for [[F-86 Sabre]] training. In 1954, Stafford was assigned to the [[54th Fighter Squadron|54th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]] at [[Ellsworth Air Force Base|Ellsworth AFB]], where he flew the F-86 mission for [[Arctic]] defense. In 1955, Stafford transferred to the [[496th Tactical Fighter Squadron|496th Fighter Interceptor Squadron]] at Landstuhl AFB (now [[Ramstein Air Base|Ramstein AB]]), [[West Germany]], again flying interceptor mission in the F-86 Sabre. In addition, he served as an assistant maintenance officer, developing his interest in applying for the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School|USAF Experimental Test Pilot School]].&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|13–24}}

In 1958, Stafford attended the Air Force Test Pilot School at [[Edwards Air Force Base|Edwards AFB]], where he finished first in his class, and received the A. B. Honts Award. After graduation, he remained at Edwards AFB as a [[flight instructor]]. While working as an instructor, Stafford created the first civilian instructor position at Test Pilot School to ensure continuity, and co-authored the ''Pilot's Handbook for Performance Flight Testing'' and the ''Aerodynamics Handbook for Performance Flight Testing''.&lt;ref name="nasabio"&gt;{{cite web

Three days after arriving there he was accepted to [[List of astronauts by selection#1962|NASA Group Two]].&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|27–38}}

==NASA career==
In April 1962, while still working as a flight instructor, Stafford applied for the next round of astronaut selection.  The required interviews and medical screenings occurred over the summer of 1962 at [[Brooks Air Force Base]] and in Houston.  On September 14, 1962, Stafford was selected for [[Astronaut Group 2]], alongside eight other future astronauts.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|35–40}}

===Project Gemini===
====Gemini 6A====
{{Main|Gemini 6A}}
[[File:Gemini 6 prime crew.jpg|thumb|right|Stafford (left) with his Gemini 6A crewmate Wally Schirra (1965)]]
Stafford was originally scheduled to fly with [[Alan Shepard]] on the first manned Gemini mission, [[Project Gemini#Crew selection|Gemini 3]], but was replaced when Shepard was removed from the flight rotation after being diagnosed with [[Ménière's disease]]. Stafford was paired with [[Wally Schirra]] as pilot and commander, respectively, and the pair was reassigned as the backup crew for Gemini 3, and primary crew for Gemini 6.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|50}}

The original Gemini 6 mission profile involved docking with an [[Agena target vehicle]]. On October 25, 1965, Schirra and Stafford were inside Gemini 6 before liftoff when the Agena vehicle exploded on ascent. After the original mission was cancelled, it was redesignated Gemini 6A and was planned to rendezvous with the long-duration Gemini 7 mission. Gemini 7 lifted off on December 4, 1965. On December 12, 1965, Gemini 6A's ignition was followed by an immediate engine shutdown. Schirra and Stafford did not eject, and the cause of the shutdown was found to be an electrical issue and a cap inadvertently left on a fuel line.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|64–72}}

On December 15, 1965, Gemini 6A lifted off and rendezvoused with Gemini 7. The two spacecraft [[Orbital station-keeping|kept station]] for approximately five hours, coming within feet of each other. Gemini 6A splashed down on December 16, and was recovered by {{USS|Wasp|CV-18|6}}.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|70–76}}

====Gemini 9====
{{Main|Gemini 9}}
[[File:Gemini Crew Welcomed by Wasp Crew - GPN-2000-001415.jpg|thumb|right|Stafford (right) and Eugene Cernan arrive aboard USS ''Wasp'' (1966)]]
Prior to Gemini 6A, Stafford was assigned as the backup commander for Gemini 9 with [[Eugene Cernan]] as the backup pilot. [[Charles Bassett|Charlie Bassett]] and [[Elliot See]] were the primary crew. On February 28, 1966, both crews flew in [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38 Talons]] to [[Lambert Field]] to visit the [[McDonell Douglas]] Gemini assembly facility. Bassett and See crashed on landing, and were killed. Stafford and Cernan became the Gemini 9 primary crew, with [[Jim Lovell]] and [[Buzz Aldrin]] as their backup crew.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|75–82}}

On May 17, 1966, the Agena target vehicle went off course and was shut down before entering orbit. As there was no replacement Agena rocket, the new target for the mission was the [[Agena target vehicle#Augmented Target Docking Adapter|Augmented Target Docket Adapter (ADTA)]], which successfully achieved orbit on June 1, 1966. The Gemini 9 launch, scheduled for later the same day, was cancelled due to a computer error. Gemini 9 successfully launched on June 3, and rendezvoused with the ATDA on the second orbit. However, the shroud on the ATDA had only partially opened, and Gemini 9 was unable to dock with it. Nonetheless, Stafford and Cernan conducted orbital rendezvous maneuvers with the ATDA, including a simulated rescue of a lunar module in a lower orbit.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|85–92}}

The following day, Cernan attempted an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), with the primary mission of testing the [[Astronaut propulsion unit#USAF Astronaut Maneuvering Unit|Astronaut Maneuvering Unit]] (AMU).  After exiting the spacecraft, Cernan quickly experienced mobility issues, followed by environmental regulation and communication issues. The EVA was aborted, and Cernan returned to the capsule after two hours. On June 6, Gemini 9 landed, and was successfully recovered by USS ''Wasp''.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|92–95}}

===Apollo program===
[[File:Astronaut Thomas P. Stafford, prime crew commander of the Apollo 10 lunar orbit mission.jpg|thumb|right|Stafford as Apollo 10 Commander (1968)]]
After Gemini 9, Stafford was assigned as the backup command module pilot on Apollo 2, with [[Frank Borman]] as the commander and [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Mike Collins]] as the lunar module pilot. For his technical assignment, Stafford was tasked as an astronaut liaison for the development of Apollo guidance and navigation systems, as well as the command and service module. In late 1966, he was reassigned to Apollo 2 backup commander, with Apollo 10 crewmates John Young as the command module pilot and Gene Cernan as the lunar module pilot. While testing the command module, they received word of the [[Apollo 1#Fire|Apollo 1 fire]] and subsequent suspension of the Apollo program.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|95–105}}

====Apollo 10====
{{Main|Apollo 10}}
In the spring of 1968, Deke Slayton announced that the previous backup crew for Apollo 2 would become the primary crew for Apollo 10. In preparation for the mission, Stafford helped design a color camera to replace the grainy black-and-white video broadcast before from space; he felt that public outreach was a vital aspect of the mission.&lt;ref name ="Colour TV on the Moon"&gt;{{cite news

Apollo 10 lifted off on May 18, 1969. Despite heavy oscillation during ascent, Apollo 10 achieved orbit without incident, successfully docked the LM and CM, and achieved its translunar injection burn. Upon arriving in lunar orbit, Stafford and Cernan undocked in the LM and entered an elliptical orbit with a [[Apsis|periapsis]] (the closest distance) of nine miles over the lunar surface. To provide reconnaissance, the periapsis coincided with the [[Mare Tranquillitatis|Sea of Tranquility]], the intended landing site for Apollo 11. Upon ascent, the LM began turning rapidly from a misaligned switch on the Abort Guidance System; Stafford was able to regain control and conduct the burn to rendezvous with the CM. The LM docked with the CM to return the astronauts and was jettisoned. After two days in lunar orbit, the Apollo 10 began its return trajectory. Along the return, the capsule achieved a speed of {{cvt| 28547|mph}}, setting the record for the fastest speed achieved by a human being. Apollo 10 splashed down east of Samoa and was recovered by {{USS|Princeton|CV-37|6}}.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|120–135}}

==== Apollo-Soyuz Test Project ====
{{Main|Apollo-Soyuz Test Project}}
[[File:ASTP Training at Star City - GPN-2002-000158.jpg|thumb|right|Stafford (right) and cosmonaut Leonov training for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project at [[Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Center|Star City]] (1975)]]

In July 1969, Stafford replaced Alan Shepard (who had returned to flight status) as [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]]. Along with Director of Flight Crew Operations [[Deke Slayton]], Stafford oversaw assignments to the upcoming Apollo and [[Skylab]] missions until Shepard resumed the position after [[Apollo 14]] in July 1971. During this period, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] and Soviet Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]] agreed to the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP). Stafford was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in late 1972, and was soon named the commander of ASTP, along with Slayton (who had also returned to flight status) and [[Vance Brand]].&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|135–156}}

Beginning in 1973, the ASTP team trained extensively in Russia and the United States. [[Soyuz 19]], carrying [[Aleksei Leonov]] and [[Valery Kubasov]], launched on July 15, 1975, at 12:20&amp;nbsp;UTC, followed by Apollo at 19:50&amp;nbsp;UTC. After two days in space, Soyuz and Apollo docked on July 17, where the crews met and conducted joint experiments and held press conferences. After remaining docked for 44 hours. the two spacecraft undocked on July 19. Soyuz returned to Earth on July 21; Apollo remained in orbit until July 24. While descending, the Apollo command module began filling with [[nitrogen tetroxide]] from the reaction control thrusters. The crew donned oxygen masks, but Brand lost consciousness and had to be assisted by Stafford. All crew were safely recovered aboard {{USS|New Orleans|LPH-11|6}}, and were hospitalized in Hawaii for [[edema]] (swelling) from fuel inhalation.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|156–197}}

==Post-NASA career==
[[File:LtGen Thomas P Stafford Official Photo.jpg|thumb|right|LtGen Thomas Stafford (1979)]]
In June 1975, before ATSP, Stafford was offered command of the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]] at Edwards AFB. He accepted and assumed the assignment on November 15, 1975. Stafford oversaw both the Air Force and NASA test facilities at Edwards AFB, as well as test ranges in [[Utah]] and [[Nevada]]. He continued to fly (including foreign aircraft such as the [[MiG-17]] and [[Panavia Tornado]]) and was involved in the interview of [[Viktor Belenko]] after his defection. Stafford also managed the development of the [[Lockheed Have Blue#Experimental Survivable Testbed|XST]], which would later evolve into the [[F-117 Nighthawk]]. In March 1978, he was promoted to lieutenant general and became Deputy Chief of Staff, Research Development and Acquisition in [[Washington, D.C.]] While working in Washington, Stafford advocated for the creation of the mobile [[MX missile]], and began developing the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit#ATB program|Advanced Technology Bomber]], the predecessor to the [[Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit|B-2 stealth bomber]]. Stafford retired to [[Norman, Oklahoma]], on November 1, 1979.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|198–210}}

Following his retirement, Stafford served on several corporate boards, including [[Omega SA]], Gibralter Exploration, and [[Gulfstream Aerospace]]. He originally intended to reunite with his ATSP crewmates in Russia, but the 1979 [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], and the subsequent [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|1980 Olympics boycott]], left them unable to travel to Russia. Stafford created a consulting firm, Stafford, Burke, and Hecker, with two recently retired general officers. In July 1990, [[Dan Quayle|Vice President Quayle]] and [[Admiral (United States)|Admiral]] [[Richard Truly]], then the [[NASA administrator]], asked Stafford to chair a committee that advised NASA on long-term lunar and [[Mars]] missions. Stafford and his team of 42 full-time members and 150 part-time members created a long-term plan with lunar missions in 2004 and Mars mission in 2012.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|211–232}} In 1992, Stafford began work as an advisor for [[Space Station Freedom]], the precursor to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). While coordinating Russian involvement, Stafford became a technical advisor for the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]], particularly [[STS-63]] and [[STS-71]]. He also served on a review committee for the [[Progress M-34#Collision|Progress-Mir Collision]].&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;{{rp|230–269}}

In 2002, Stafford published an autobiography written with [[Michael Cassutt]], titled ''We Have Capture: Tom Stafford and the Space Race''.&lt;ref name=wehavecapture /&gt;  He also wrote the epilogue of the book ''Falling to Earth: An Apollo 15 Astronaut's Journey to the Moon'' by fellow Apollo astronaut [[Al Worden]].&lt;ref name="fallingtoearth"&gt;{{cite web

{{Cosmology|history}}
This '''timeline of cosmological theories''' and discoveries is a [[Chronology|chronological]] record of the development of humanity's understanding of the [[cosmos]] over the last two-plus millennia. Modern [[Cosmology|cosmological]] ideas follow the development of the [[science|scientific discipline]] of [[physical cosmology]].

==Pre-1900==

* '''1965'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]], astronomers at [[Bell Labs]] discover the 2.7 K ''microwave background radiation'', which earns them the 1978 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physics. [[Robert Dicke]], [[Jim Peebles|James Peebles]], Peter Roll and [[David Todd Wilkinson]] interpret it as a relic from the big bang.
* '''1966'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[George Francis Rayner Ellis|George Ellis]] show that any plausible general relativistic cosmology is [[gravitational singularity|singular]]
* '''1966'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Jim Peebles|James Peebles]] shows that the hot [[Big Bang]] predicts the correct helium abundance
* '''1967'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Andrei Sakharov]] presents the requirements for [[baryogenesis]], a [[baryon]]-[[antimatter|antibaryon]] [[asymmetry]] in the universe

* '''1969'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Charles Misner]] formally presents the Big Bang [[horizon problem]]
* '''1969'''&amp;nbsp;— Robert Dicke formally presents the Big Bang flatness problem
* '''1970'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Vera Rubin]] and Kent Ford measure spiral galaxy rotation curves at large radii, showing evidence for substantial amounts of [[dark matter]].

* '''1976'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Alex Shlyakhter]] uses [[samarium]] ratios from the [[Oklo]] prehistoric [[natural nuclear fission reactor]] in [[Gabon]] to show that some laws of physics have remained unchanged for over two billion years
* '''1977'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Gary Steigman]], [[David Schramm (astrophysicist)|David Schramm]], and [[James Gunn (astronomer)|James Gunn]] examine the relation between the primordial helium abundance and number of neutrinos and claim that at most five [[lepton]] families can exist.
* '''1980'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Alan Guth]] and Alexei Starobinsky independently propose the [[cosmic inflation|inflation]]ary Big Bang universe as a possible solution to the horizon and flatness problems.
* '''1981'''&amp;nbsp;— [[Viacheslav Mukhanov]] and G. Chibisov propose that quantum fluctuations could lead to large scale structure in an [[cosmic inflation|inflationary]] universe.
* '''1982'''&amp;nbsp;— The first CfA galaxy redshift survey is completed.
* '''1982'''&amp;nbsp;— Several groups including [[Jim Peebles|James Peebles]], J. Richard Bond and George Blumenthal propose that the universe is dominated by cold [[dark matter]]. 
* '''1983 - 1987''' &amp;nbsp;— The first large computer simulations of cosmic structure formation are run by Davis, Efstathiou, Frenk and White. The results show that cold dark matter produces a reasonable match to observations, but hot dark matter does not.
* '''1988'''&amp;nbsp;— The [[CfA2 Great Wall]] is discovered in the CfA2 redshift survey.
* '''1988'''&amp;nbsp;— Measurements of galaxy large-scale flows provide evidence for the [[Great Attractor]]. 
* '''1990'''&amp;nbsp;— Preliminary results from [[NASA]]'s [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] mission confirm the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] has a [[blackbody]] spectrum to an astonishing one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; precision, thus eliminating the possibility of an integrated starlight model proposed for the background by steady state enthusiasts.
* '''1992'''&amp;nbsp;— Further [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] measurements discover the very small [[anisotropy]] of the [[cosmic microwave background]], providing a "baby picture" of the seeds of large-scale structure when the universe was around 1/1100th of its present size and 380,000 years old.   
* '''1996'''&amp;nbsp;- The first [[Hubble Deep Field]] is released, providing a clear view of very distant galaxies when the universe was around one-third of its present age. 
* '''1998'''&amp;nbsp;— Controversial evidence for the [[fine structure constant]] varying over the lifetime of the universe is first published.
* '''1998'''&amp;nbsp;— The [[Supernova Cosmology Project]] and [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]]  discover [[dark energy|cosmic acceleration]] based on distances to  [[Type Ia supernova]]e, providing the first direct evidence for a non-zero [[cosmological constant]].
* '''1999'''&amp;nbsp;— Measurements of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] with finer resolution than COBE, (most notably by the [[BOOMERanG experiment]] see Mauskopf et al., 1999, Melchiorri et al., 1999, de Bernardis et al. 2000) provide evidence for oscillations (the first acoustic peak) in the [[anisotropy]] angular spectrum, as expected in the standard model of cosmological structure formation. The angular position of this peak indicates that the geometry of the universe is close to flat.

==Since 2000==
* '''2001'''&amp;nbsp;— The [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey]] (2dF) by an Australian/British team gave strong evidence that the matter density is near 25% of critical density. Together with the CMB results for a flat universe, this provides independent evidence for a [[cosmological constant]] or similar [[dark energy]]. 
* '''2002'''&amp;nbsp;— The [[Cosmic Background Imager]] (CBI) in [[Chile]] obtained images of the cosmic microwave background radiation with the highest angular resolution of 4 arc minutes. It also obtained the anisotropy spectrum at high-resolution not covered before up to l ~ 3000. It found a slight excess in power at high-resolution (l &gt; 2500) not yet completely explained, the so-called "CBI-excess".
* '''2003'''&amp;nbsp;— NASA's [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) obtained full-sky detailed pictures of the cosmic microwave background radiation. The images can be interpreted to indicate that the universe is 13.7 billion years old (within one percent error), and are very consistent with the [[Lambda-CDM model]] and the density fluctuations predicted by [[cosmic inflation|inflation]].
* '''2003'''&amp;nbsp;— The [[Sloan Great Wall]] is discovered.
* '''2004'''&amp;nbsp;— The Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI) first obtained the E-mode polarization spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation.
* '''2005'''&amp;nbsp;— The [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] (SDSS) and [[2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey|2dF]] redshift surveys both detected the [[baryon acoustic oscillation]] feature in the galaxy distribution, a key prediction of cold [[dark matter]] models. 
* '''2006'''&amp;nbsp;— The long-awaited three-year [[WMAP]] results are released, confirming previous analysis, correcting several points, and including [[Cosmic microwave background radiation#Polarization|polarization]] data.
* '''2006–2011'''&amp;nbsp;— Improved measurements from [[WMAP]], new supernova surveys ESSENCE and SNLS, and baryon acoustic oscillations from [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey|SDSS]] and [[Astronomical survey#List of sky surveys|WiggleZ]], continue to be consistent with the standard [[Lambda-CDM model]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3959">This '''timeline of paleontology in West Virginia''' is a chronologically ordered list events in the history of [[paleontological]] research occurring within or conducted by people from the [[U.S. state]] of [[West Virginia]].

==18th century==
[[File:Megalonyx CasparWistar claw Griffe1799.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Claws of ''[[Megalonyx jeffersonii]]'']]
===1790s===
'''[[1796 in paleontology|&lt;span style="color:#14145C;"&gt;1796&lt;/span&gt;]]'''
* A man named John Stuart sent some limb bones discovered by workers operating [[saltpeter]] vats in a cave then considered part of [[Greenbrier County]], [[Paleontology in Virginia|Virginia]] to [[Thomas Jefferson]]. Jefferson recognized them as being from a genus unknown to science and named the creature ''[[Megalonyx]]''. The cave from which these fossils were taken later came to be identified with [[Organ Cave]].&lt;ref name="grady-megalonyx-abstract-111" /&gt;

==20th century==
[[File:Proterogyrinus NT.jpg|thumb|150px|right|The anthracosaur ''[[Proterogyrinus]]'' may have left behind fossil footprints in West Virginia.]]
'''[[1990 in paleontology|&lt;span style="color:#14145C;"&gt;1990&lt;/span&gt;]]'''
* Frederick A. Sundberg, and other colleagues erected the new [[ichnospecies]] ''[[Hylopus hamesi]]'' to hold fossil amphibian footprints from the latest [[Mississippian age|Mississippian]] [[Bluefield Formation]]. This ichnospecies represented the oldest evidence for terrestrial vertebrates in the eastern United States. Based on the anatomy of the foot responsible for the traces, the researchers concluded that the tracks were left by [[anthracosaurs]], possibly the species ''[[Protergyrinus scheelei]]'', which was also known from West Virginia's Mississippian deposits. Variations in the structure of the trackways suggested that some of them were left while the animal was swimming, and thus the tracks suggest it was capable of walking on land and swimming underwater.&lt;ref name="amphibian-footprints-abstract-111" /&gt;

'''[[1993 in paleontology|&lt;span style="color:#14145C;"&gt;1993&lt;/span&gt;]]'''
* Two pieces of a ''Megalonyx'' shoulder blade were found in [[Haynes Cave]] of [[Monroe County, West Virginia]], suggesting it may have been the true location where the ''Megalonyx'' bones examined by Thomas Jefferson were discovered, rather than Organ Cave.&lt;ref name="grady-megalonyx-abstract-111" /&gt;

'''[[1995 in paleontology|&lt;span style="color:#14145C;"&gt;1995&lt;/span&gt;]]'''
* Fred Grady further debunked the association between the ''Megalonyx'' fossils and Organ Cave since the original discovery site was owned at the time of the discovery by a man named Frederic Gromer, who had never owned Organ Cave. However, he did own Haynes Cave. Additional details gleaned from descriptions of Haynes Cave taken from the correspondence of subsequent owner, Tristram Patton, add more evidence that it was the true site of the discovery of Megalonyx.&lt;ref name="grady-megalonyx-abstract-111" /&gt;

==21st century==
'''[[2008 in paleontology|&lt;span style="color:#14145C;"&gt;2008&lt;/span&gt;]]'''
* ''[[Megalonyx jeffersonii]]'' was designated the West Virginia [[state fossil]].
