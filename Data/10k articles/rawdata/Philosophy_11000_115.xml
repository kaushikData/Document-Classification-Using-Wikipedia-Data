==Life==
Adam studied in the Department of Liberal Arts at the [[University of Krakow]], earning a baccalaureate in 1488 and a master's degree in 1492. He then studied medicine in [[Italy]]. Returning to Poland, he served as court physician to Kings [[Jan I Olbracht]], [[Alexander Jagiellon]] and [[Zygmunt I]]. In 1510 and 1511 he was twice elected rector of the [[University of Krakow]]. He opposed the clergy's dominance over the secular estate. An unconventional thinker, he hypothesized the immortality of humankind.&lt;ref name="Henryk Barycz 1514 pp. 20"/&gt;

In the early sixteenth century, [[Plato]] had become a model for philosophy in [[Italy]], especially in [[Medici|Medicean]] [[Florence]]. In some ways he was represented in [[Poland]] by Adam of Łowicz, author of ''Conversations about Immortality''.&lt;ref&gt;Tatarkiewicz, ''Zarys...'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10260">In the [[psychoanalysis]] of [[Sigmund Freud]], '''afterwardsness''' is a "mode of belated understanding or retroactive attribution of sexual or traumatic meaning to earlier events... [from the German word] ''Nachträglichkeit'', translated as deferred action, retroaction, [[:fr:après-coup|après-coup]], afterwardsness".&lt;ref&gt;Teresa de Lauretis, ''Freud's Drive: Psychoanalysis, Literature and Film'' (Basingstoke 2008), p. 118&lt;/ref&gt; As summarized by another scholar, 'In one sense, Freud's theory of deferred action can be simply stated: memory is reprinted, so to speak, in accordance with later experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and development of the term==

===Freud===
The psychoanalytical concept of "afterwardsness" ({{lang-de|Nachträglichkeit}}) appeared initially in [[Freud]]'s writings in the 1890s in the commonsense form of the German adjective-adverb "afterwards" or "deferred" (''nachträglich''): as Freud wrote in the unfinished and unpublished "A Project for a Scientific Psychology" of 1895, 'a memory is repressed which has only become a trauma ''after the event'' '.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Jean Laplanche, ''Life and Death in Psychoanalysis'' (London 1976), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; However the 'theory of deferred action had already been [publicly] put forward by Freud in the ''Studies on Hysteria'' (1895)',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991), p. 278n&lt;/ref&gt; and in a paper of 1896 'he elaborates on the idea of ''deferred action'': the pathogenic effect of a traumatic event occurring in childhood...[manifesting] retrospectively when the child reaches a subsequent phase of sexual development'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Quinodoz, ''Reading Freud'' (London 2006), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

The same idea would feature prominently a couple of decades later in his study of the "Wolf Man": 'The effects of the scene were deferred, but...had the same effect as though it were a recent experience'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991), pp. 276–7&lt;/ref&gt; 'Thus although he never offered a definition, much less a general theory, of the notion of deferred action, it was indisputably looked on by Freud as part of his conceptual equipment'.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Laplanche and J.-B. Pontalis, in Adam Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacan===
It was [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] who brought the term back from obscurity after Freud's death—his translation in the French language as the "[[:fr:après-coup|après-coup]]" fits into the context of his "return to Freud" ("rapport de Rome", 1953)—and certainly French [[psychoanalysis]] has since taken the lead in its explication. Lacan himself claimed in his Seminar that "the real implication of the ''nachträglich'', for example, has been ignored, though it was there all the time and had only to be picked up,"&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (London 1994), p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; while writing in Ecrits of "'deferred action' (''Nachtrag''), to rescue another of these terms from the facility into which they have since fallen...they were unheard of at that time."&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Ecrits: A Selection'' (London 1996), p. 281&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean Laplanche===
After Lacan's ''après-coup'',  [[Jean Laplanche]]’s contribution to the concept of the afterwardsness signifies something very  different:&lt;ref&gt;See particularly: [[Jean Laplanche]], "Sa reviviscence en France", "Chez Lacan avec [[Heidegger]]" in: Jean Laplanche, ''Problématiques VI. L'après-coup'', Paris, PUF, 2006, p. 16-22.&lt;/ref&gt; with Jean Laplanche and in the relation to Freud (theory of the seduction, ''neurotica''), Lacan's "Other" loses its capital letter of the "[[The Symbolic|Symbolic]]", that links [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] to French [[structuralism]] ([[Saussure]]'s [[linguistics]], [[Lévi-Strauss]]'s [[ethnology]]), and that links also Lacan ''afterwards'' in the history of the ideas (from the 1960s on)—by "inversion in the opposite direction" (a "destiny of the [[drive theory|drive]]" in psychoanalytic theory)—to the [[:fr:French theory|French theory]] at the place of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s [[deconstruction]].&lt;ref&gt;Roseline Bonnellier, "De ''[[Hölderlin]] et la question du père'' à la ''[[:fr:théorie de la séduction généralisée|théorie de la séduction généralisée]]'' de [[:fr:Jean Laplanche|Jean Laplanche]]: Avancée paradoxale de la traduction d’''Œdipe'' en psychanalyse ", thèse du Doctorat de psychologie, Université Paris-XIII, 2007, 1050 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roseline Bonnellier, ''Sous le soleil de [[Hölderlin]]: Oedipe en question - Au premier temps du complexe était la fille'', Paris, L'Harmattan, Collection "Études psychanalytiques" (dirigée par Alain Brun et Joël Bernat), février 2010, 360 pages, {{ISBN|978-2-296-10411-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Afterwardsness"  becomes the key concept in Laplanche’s "[[theory of the general seduction]]" (''[[:fr:théorie de la séduction généralisée|théorie de la séduction généralisée]]'') and  of the corresponding importance of 'the act of ''psychic translation''... of [enigmatic] deposits by the other'&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Elliott, ''Social Theory since Freud'' (London 20040 p. 13 and p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;—an approach which develops further Freud's letter 52/112 (to [[Wilhelm Fliess]]). In his "Notes on Afterwardsness" (1992), based on a conversation of [[Jean Laplanche]] with [[Martin Stanton]],&lt;ref&gt;''Jean Laplanche: Seduction, Translation, Drives'', A dossier compiled by John Fletcher and Martin Stanton, Translations by Martin Stanton, Psychoanalytic Forum, Institute of Contemporary Arts London, 1992, p. 217-223.  {{ISBN|0-905263-68-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an excellent definition of ''afterwardsness'' in Laplanche's sense, including the category  of the ''enigmatic message'', that highlights Laplanche's contribution to [[Freud]]'s concept:
{{cquote | Freud's concept of afterwardsness contains both great richness and great ambiguity between retrogressive and progressive directions. I want to account for this problem of the directional to and fro by arguing that, right at the start, there is something that goes in the direction from the past to the future, and in the direction from the adult to the baby, which I call the implantation of the enigmatic message. This message is then retranslated following a temporal direction which is sometimes progressive and sometimes retrogressive (according to my general model of translation).&lt;ref&gt;Jean Laplanche in ''Jean Laplanche: Seduction, Translation, Drives'', A dossier compiled by John Fletcher and Martin Stanton, Translations by Martin Stanton, Psychoanalytic Forum, Institute of Contemporary Arts London, 1992, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Deferred obedience==
Closely related for Freud to deferred action was [[deferred obedience]]: again, 'a ''deferred'' effect...a "deferred obedience" under the influence of [[psychological repression|repression]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Standard Edition X'' (London 1955), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; Thus for instance Freud explored the different phases of a man's infantile attitude to his father: 'As long as his father was alive it showed itself in unmitigated rebelliousness and open discord, but immediately after his death it took the form of a [[neurosis]] based on abject submission and deferred obedience to him'.&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (London 1991), p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Totem and Taboo'' he generalised the principle and 'depicted the social contract also as based on posthumous obedience to the father's authority'&lt;ref&gt;Jose Bruner, ''Freud and the Politics of Psychoanalysis'' (2001), p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;—offset at times by its converse, occasional [[Carnival]]-like licence such as 'the memorial festival of the totem meal, in which the ''restrictions'' of deferred obedience no longer held'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julia Kristeva]]/Jeanine Herman, ''The Sense and Non-Sense of Revolt'' (Columbia 2001), p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4186">A '''body of knowledge''' ('''BOK''' or '''BoK''') is the complete set of concepts, terms and activities that make up a [[professional]] domain, as defined by the relevant [[learned society]] or [[professional association]].&lt;ref name="Oliver 2012"&gt;Oliver, G.R. (2012). ''Foundations of the Assumed Business Operations and Strategy Body of Knowledge (BOSBOK): An Outline of Shareable Knowledge'', p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[knowledge representation]] by any [[knowledge organization]]. Several definitions of BOK have been developed, for example:
:* "Structured knowledge that is used by members of a discipline to guide their practice or work.” “The prescribed aggregation of knowledge in a particular area an individual is expected to have mastered to be considered or certified as a practitioner.” (BOK-def). Waite’s pragmatic view is also worth noting: “BOK is a stepping stone to unifying community” (Waite 2004).&lt;ref&gt;Waite, W. (2004). "V&amp;V Education Initiatives," ''Foundations ’04.''&lt;/ref&gt;'' - [[Tuncer Ören]] (2005),&lt;ref&gt;[[Ören, Tüncer I.]] "[http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~oren/pubs-pres/2005/pub-0513-MSBOK-IITSEC.pdf Toward the body of knowledge of modeling and simulation]." ''Proceedings of the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation Conference, Orlando, FL, Nov. 2005.''&lt;/ref&gt;
:* The systematic collection of activities and outcomes in terms of their values, constructs, models, principles and instantiations, which arises from continuous discovery and validation work by members of the profession and enables self-reflective growth and reproduction of the profession (Romme 2016).&lt;ref&gt;Romme, G. (2016). ''The Quest for Professionalism: The Case of Management and Entrepreneurship.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* A set of knowledge within a profession or subject area which is generally agreed as both essential and generally known (Oliver 2012).&lt;ref name="Oliver 2012"/&gt;
A body of knowledge is the accepted [[Ontology (information science)#Domain ontologies and upper ontologies|ontology for a specific domain]]. A BOK is more than simply a collection of terms; a professional reading list; a library; a website or a collection of websites; a description of professional functions; or even a collection of information.

The '''Centre de recherche et de documentation sur Hegel''' (Research Center for the Writings of Hegel and Marx) was established at the Philosophy Department of the [[University of Poitiers]] in 1969. Its founding, under Professor [[Jacques D’Hondt]], was a significant event in the [[France|French]] philosophical field. This center attempted to coordinate the research of an objective, scientific and philosophical nature on the origins and ideas of the theologian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and the atheist [[Karl Marx|Marx]].

The idea for this Center appeared around a Seminar of [[Jean Hyppolite]], Professor of the [[College of France]], during conversations between Jean Hyppolite and Jacques D’Hondt. Their proposal was supported by George Canguilhem and materialized within a broader intent to decentralize French philosophical research between the College of France, the [[University of Paris]] and the University of Poitiers.

The death of Jean Hyppolite in 1969, however, deprived the Research Center of its Parisian anchor.

Its first convention in November, 1969 included Professors D’Hondt, Pucelle, Delhomme and Garaudy, of the Philosophy Department of University of Poitiers, and other notable researchers, including Mssrs. Dubarle, Bruaire, Sichirollo, Bess, Garniron, Guillaumaud, Hoffmann, Janicaud, Méthais, Planty, Ricci, Vadée, Mrs. Jalley and Miss Thomas. Other associates included Mssrs. Doz, Saintillan, Large, Wetzel, Bourdin, Draper, Gauvin, Olivier, Francisci, Fleischmann, Mrs. Königson and Mrs. Draper-Josa.

In 1975, the Professor Planty succèeded J. D’Hondt. J. D’Hondt's final seminar on Hegel and Marx was completed in 1981. Professor Jean-Louis L'Baron succeeded Professor Planty in 1991.

Around this timeframe the [[USSR]] had fallen, and Marxist studies significantly declined in the West. The Research Center for the Writings of Hegel and Marx ceased to exist in 1998, and was replaced by the Research center on Hegel and [[German Idealism]].

==Scholarship and recognition==
Gushee is an internationally recognized Holocaust scholar and ethicist, based on his 1994 book ''Righteous Gentiles of the Holocaust''. He was appointed in 2008 by the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] to serve as a member of the Church Relations and the Holocaust Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/church/ | title= Committee on Church Relations and the Holocaust|website=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=June 15, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203025139/http://www.ushmm.org/research/center/church/committee/|archivedate=February 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught a summer seminar for college faculty at the USHMM. 

Gushee's most important books include ''Kingdom Ethics'' (with Glen Stassen, 2003), ''The Sacredness of Human Life'' (2013), and ''Changing Our Mind'' (2014). ''Kingdom Ethics'' was ''Christianity Today's'' Theology/Ethics Book of the Year for 2004, and has been translated into eight languages. A second edition was released in 2016. 

Gushee is the author of well over one hundred scholarly articles, chapters and reviews and has written or edited twenty books. 

Gushee was [[ordained]] to the Gospel Ministry at Walnut Hills Baptist Church in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidpgushee.com/Welcome_files/gusheelongbio.pdf|title=David P. Gushee Bio|accessdate=June 15, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230104549/http://www.davidpgushee.com/Welcome_files/gusheelongbio.pdf|archivedate=December 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gushee was granted an honorary [[Doctor of Divinity]] (D.D.) degree in May 2009 by the [[John Leland Center for Theological Studies]].

==Education==
Gushee received his [[Ph.D.]] in Christian ethics from [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in 1993, having earned his [[M.Phil.]] from Union Theological Seminary in 1990. Gushee earned his [[M.Div.]] from [[Southern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in 1987.  He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from the [[College of William and Mary]] in 1984.

==Controversy==
As a Christian ethicist, Gushee has periodically been out spoken about current controversial societal topics. His positions on such issues as [[climate change]], torture, and [[LGBT]] rights have often put him into conflict with his traditional evangelical constituency.  For example, In 2015, [[Russell D. Moore|Russell Moore]], also a well known Evangelical ethicist, implied that Gushee was not a true Evangelical because of his change of belief supporting LGBT civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Can Affirming Gay Christians Be Evangelical?|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/can-affirming-gay-christians-be-evangelical-russell-moore-says-no-and-not-to-expect-actual-evangelicals-to-change-their-minds-144266/|accessdate=4 September 2015|agency=The Christian Post|date=September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gushee, however, nevertheless describes himself as a "progressive evangelical."

'''''Dialogo de Cecco di Ronchitti da Bruzene in perpuosito de la stella Nuova''''' (''Dialogue of Cecco di Ronchitti of [[Brugine]] concerning the New star'') is the title of an early 17th-century [[pseudonym|pseudonymous]] [[pamphlet]] ridiculing the views of an aspiring  [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosopher]], Antonio Lorenzini da Montepulciano,&lt;ref&gt;Favaro ([[#CITEREFFavaro,_AntonioGalileiSpinelli1881|1881]], [https://archive.org/stream/attidelrealeist03unkngoog#page/n242/mode/1up pp.210''ff'']). Lorenzini had espoused his views in a booklet, ''Discorso intorno alla nuova stella'', published in Padua at the beginning of 1605&lt;/ref&gt; on the nature and properties of [[Kepler's Supernova]], which had appeared in October 1604.  The pseudonymous ''Dialogue'' was written in the coarse language of a rustic Paduan dialect,&lt;ref&gt;Drake ([[#CITEREFDrakeGalileiSpinelli1976|1976]], pp.ix, 23–24, 45)&lt;/ref&gt; and first published in about March, 1605, in [[Padua]].   A second edition was published later the same year in [[Verona]].&lt;ref&gt;Favaro ([[#CITEREFFavaro,_AntonioGalileiSpinelli1881|1881]], [https://archive.org/stream/attidelrealeist03unkngoog#page/n227/mode/1up pp.195–237]), Drake ([[#CITEREFDrakeGalileiSpinelli1976|1976]], pp.1–32).&lt;/ref&gt;   A translation into standard Italian was published by [[:it:Antonio Favaro|Antonio Favaro]]&lt;ref&gt;Favaro ([[#CITEREFFavaro,_AntonioGalileiSpinelli1881|1881]], [https://archive.org/stream/attidelrealeist03unkngoog#page/n271/mode/1up pp.239–271])&lt;/ref&gt; in 1881, and an English translation by [[Stillman Drake]]&lt;ref&gt;Drake ([[#CITEREFDrakeGalileiSpinelli1976|1976]], pp.33–53)&lt;/ref&gt; in 1976.

Scholars agree that the pamphlet was written either by [[Galileo Galilei]] or one of his followers, Girolamo Spinelli, or by both in collaboration, but do not agree on the extent of the contribution&amp;mdash;if any&amp;mdash;made by each of them to its composition.

Algora Publishing, 2005; {{ISBN|0-87586-331-0}}/{{ISBN|978-0-87586-331-3}}, pg. 163&lt;/ref&gt; while fostering an ambition for the "[[Fourth Reich]]" centred in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Barbie's Postwar Ties With U.S. Army Detailed|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=14 February 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Infield. ''The Secrets of the SS''. Stein and Day, New York, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Wechsberg]], ''The Murderers Among Us.'' McGraw Hill, New York, 1967. pp. 81, 116.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Infield, the idea for the Spinne network began in 1944 as Hitler's chief intelligence officer [[Reinhard Gehlen]] foresaw a possible downfall of the [[Third Reich]]&lt;ref&gt;Infield, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; due to Nazi military failures in Russia. [[T.H. Tetens]], expert on German geopolitics and member of the US War Crimes Commission in 1946-47, referred to a group overlapping with die Spinne as the Führungsring ("a kind of political Mafia, with headquarters in Madrid... serving various purposes.")&lt;ref&gt;[[T.H. Tetens]]. ''The New Germany and the Old Nazis'', Random House/Marzani+Munsel, 1961. p. 31&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Madrid office built up what was referred to as a sort of [[Fascist International]], per Tetens.&lt;ref&gt;Tetens, p.&amp;nbsp;73&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tetens the German leadership also included Dr [[Hans Globke]], who had written the official commentary on the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. Globke held the important position of Director of the [[German Chancellery]] from 1953–63, serving as adviser to [[Konrad Adenauer]].&lt;ref&gt;Tetens, pp. 38–41&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "Fascist International"==
From 1945 to 1950, Die Spinne's leader Skorzeny facilitated the escape of Nazi war criminals from war-criminal prisons to [[Memmingen]], Bavaria, through Austria and Switzerland into Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Infield, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Certain US military authorities allegedly knew of the escape, but took no action.&lt;ref&gt;Infield, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; The Central European headquarters of Die Spinne as of 1948 was in [[Gmunden]], [[Upper Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;Wechsberg, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

A coordinating office for international Die Spinne operations was established in [[Madrid]] by Skorzeny under the control of [[Francisco Franco]],&lt;ref&gt;Infield, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; whose victory in the [[Spanish Civil War]] had been aided by economic and military support from Hitler and Mussolini. When a Die Spinne Nazi delegation visited Madrid in 1959, Franco stated, "Please regard Spain as your second Fatherland."&lt;ref&gt;Tetens, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Skorzeny used Die Spinne's resources to allow notorious Nazi concentration camp doctor [[Joseph Mengele]] to escape to Argentina in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Infield, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Skorzeny requested assistance from German industrialist tycoon [[Alfried Krupp]], whose company had controlled 138 private concentration camps under the Third Reich; the assistance was granted in 1951. Skorzeny became Krupp's representative in industrial business ventures in Argentina,&lt;ref&gt;Infield, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; a country which harboured a strong pro-Nazi political element throughout World War II and afterwards,&lt;ref&gt;Wechsberg, pp. 337-38&lt;/ref&gt; regardless of a nominal declaration of loyalty to the Allies as World War II ended. With the help of Die Spinne leaders in Spain, by the early 1980s Die Spinne had become influential in Argentina, Chile and Paraguay, including ties involving Paraguayan dictator [[Alfredo Stroessner]].&lt;ref&gt;Wechsberg, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

War Crimes investigator [[Simon Wiesenthal]] claimed [[Joseph Mengele]] had stayed at the notorious [[Colonia Dignidad]] Nazi colony in Chile in 1979,&lt;ref&gt;Infield, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately found harbour in Paraguay until his death. As of the early 1980s, Die Spinne's Mengele was reported by Infield&lt;ref&gt;Infield, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; to have been advising Stroessner's ethnic German [[Paraguayan police]] on how to reduce native Paraguayan Indians in the [[Gran Chaco|Chaco Region]] to slave labour.&lt;ref&gt;Infield, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; A wealthy, powerful post–World War II underground Nazi political contingent held sway in Argentina as of the late 1960s, which included many ethnic German Nazi immigrants and their descendants.&lt;ref&gt;Wechsberg, pp. 123–24, 159, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The "Spinne" network in Spain is the focus of the 1966 [[Nick Carter-Killmaster|Nick Carter]] spy novel ''[[Web of Spies (Killmaster novel)|Web of Spies]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

"THRUSH" ("WASP") from the TV-series (as well as the unnamed antagonist in the movie) called ''[[The Man from U.N.C.L.E.]]'', is built upon Die Spinne.

Ian Fleming (who allegedly was the MI6 handler in real life "Operation James Bond" to extract Bormann out of Berlin) had in his fictional James Bond series Bormann's network in mind for "Octopussy" (Die Spinne) and S.P.E.C.T.R.E. (Die Spinne / O.D.E.S.S.A.).

'''Diluted property rights theory''' is a [[macroeconomics]] theory proposed by founder of Holland Meissner Company [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrVGKCmuc0c Amber Persons] (formerly known as Monica Natasha Lester).  The theory is meant to serve as an extension of [[Property rights (economics)|property rights theory]].  Property rights theory has not received substantial theoretical or empirical attention despite its potential to explain various phenomena dealing with business transactions.&lt;ref name=KandM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Jongwook|last2=Mahoney|first2=Joseph|title=Property Rights Theory, Transaction Costs Theory, and Agency Theory: An Organizational Economics Approach to Strategic Management|journal=Managerial and Decision Economics|date=2005|volume=26|pages=223–242|doi=10.1002/mde.1218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diluted property rights theory addresses this lack of progression by approaching property rights theory from the position of approximating the conditions that actually exist when rights are negotiated, exchanged, and handled.

This is the same approach that [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Ronald Coase]] took when discovering and clarifying the significance of property rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics: Ronald H. Coase|url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Coase.html|website=Library of Economics and Liberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While property rights theory defines property rights and delineates how the rightful owner of such rights may use, enforce, transfer, and benefit from them, diluted property rights theory attempts to define a pervasive violation of a principal of property rights theory.  Writing from a legal perspective, Coase explains how property rights should be delimited.&lt;ref name=Coase&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coase|first1=R. H.|title=The Problem of Social Cost|journal=Journal of Law and Economics|date=October 1960|volume=3|pages=1–44|doi=10.1086/466560|url=http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/classes/tsc220/hallam/Coase.pdf|accessdate=October 25, 2015|ref=http://www.jstor.org/stable/724810}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Coase, such rights should go to the party that can create the most [[public benefit]].  However, property rights are often diluted and the party that can create the most public good are not always granted such rights.&lt;ref name=Lester&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lester|first1=Monica N.|last2=Maheshwari|first2=Sharad K.|last3=McLain|first3=Michael|title=Family Firms and Negative Social Capital: A Property Rights Theory Approach|journal=Journal of Behavioral &amp; Applied Management|date=2013|volume=15|issue=1|pages=11–24|url=http://www.ibam.com/pubs/jbam/articles/vol15/No1/article%203%20Lester%20et%20al%20after%20assistant%20ed.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diluted property rights are created when: 
 
# Rights are not well-defined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Soto|first1=H|title=The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else|date=2000|publisher=Transworld Publisher|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0465016150}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# Rights are weakened due to some legal or socially accepted event
# The diluting event is mediating
# The diluting event has a significant and/or reprehensive impact
# The diluting event interferes with the use, transfer, enforcement, or residual claim deriving from ownership of the property right
The theory holds that the event need not be reoccurring to make a lasting impression.  In addition, diluted property rights are not extended to incidental violation of the law that reaves a rightful owner of his rights.  Diluted property rights theory is concerned with widespread weakening of rights that are dictated by policy, law, and norms.  The concern is that the continued weakening of property rights will have long-lasting wide spread effects that may be disadvantageous to the [[world economy]]. This concern is valid in so much as well protected property rights have created long-lasting benefits to [[Corporation|corporations]].&lt;ref name="Chomsky"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chomsky|first1=Noam|title=Free Market Fantasies: Capitalism In The Real World|date=May 4, 2005|publisher=AK Press|ref=http://www.amazon.com/Property-Rights/dp/B000QVJGUS|format=Album}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prior approaches to diluted property rights==

Diluted property rights have often been approached as a minor topic in traditional business research.  For example, in his book ''Internal Research &amp; Development Markets,'' Eric Kasper offered two examples of how rights can be diluted: 1) the exploitation of [[Research and development|R &amp; D]] results by a business unit, and 2) the simultaneous sharing of rights by several individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Internal Research &amp; Development Markets|last = Kasper|first = Eric|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year = 2006|isbn = 3790817295|location = New York, NY|pages = 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[trademark law]], dilution from a legal and [[intellectual rights]] perspective is well-documented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Rierson|first1 = Sandra L.|title = The Myth and Reality of Dilution|journal = Duke Law &amp; Technology Review|date = 2012|ssrn = 1952671}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Dilution Under Section 43(c) of the Lanham Act|last = Alexander|first = Miles|date = 1996|journal = Law and Contemporary Problems|doi = 10.2307/1192072|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Heilbronner|first2 = Michael |volume=59 |pages=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Statutory Interpretation, Property Rights, and Boundaries: The Nature and Limits of Protection in Trademark Dilution, Trade Dress, and Product Configuration Cases|last = Myers|first = Gary|date = 2000|journal = Columbia - VLA Journal of Law &amp; the Arts|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edgar Morin''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɔː|ˈ|r|æ|n}}; {{IPA-fr|mɔʁɛ̃|lang}}; born '''Edgar Nahoum''' on 8 July 1921) is a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]] and [[sociologist]] who has been internationally recognized for his work on complexity and "complex thought" ([[:fr:Pensée complexe|pensée complexe]]), and for his scholarly contributions to such diverse fields as media studies, politics, sociology, visual anthropology, ecology, education, and systems biology. He holds degrees in history, economics, and law. Though less well known in the United States due to the limited availability of English translations of his over 60 books, Morin is renowned in the French-speaking world, Europe, and Latin America.

== Biography ==
At the beginning of the 20th century, Morin's family migrated from the Greek city of [[Salonica]] (Thessaloniki) to [[Marseille]]&lt;ref&gt;Edgar Morin, Véronique Nahoum-Grappe, Haïm Vidal Sephiha (1989), ''Vidal et les siens'', Paris: Seuil.&lt;/ref&gt; and later to [[Paris]], where Edgar was born. He is of Judeo-Spanish ([[Sephardi Jews|Sefardi]]) origin.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

When the Germans invaded France in 1940, Morin assisted refugees and joined the French Resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morin|first1=Edgar|last2=Boukhardi|first2=Sophie|title=Talking to Edgar Morin: Defining dialogue|journal=UNESCO: The New Courier|date=January 2004|pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a member of the [[French Resistance]] he adopted the pseudonym ''Morin'', which he would use for the rest of his life. He joined the [[French Communist Party]] in 1941.

In 1945, Morin married Violette Chapellaubeau and they lived in [[Landau]], where he served as a lieutenant in the French Occupation army in Germany.

In 1946, he returned to Paris and gave up his military career to pursue his activities with the Communist Party. Due to his critical posture, his relationship with the party gradually deteriorated until he was expelled in 1951 after he published an article in ''[[Le Nouvel Observateur]]''. In the same year, he was admitted to the National Center of Scientific Research ([[CNRS]]).

Morin founded and directed the magazine ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Arguments (journal)|fr|3=Arguments|lt=Arguments}}'' (1954–1962). In 1959 his book ''Autocritique'' was published. The book was a sustained reflection on his adherence to, and subsequent exit from, the Communist Party, focusing on the dangers of ideology and self-deception.

In 1960, Morin travelled extensively in Latin America, visiting [[Brazil]], [[Chile]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Mexico]]. He returned to France, where he published ''L'Esprit du Temps'', a work on popular culture''.''

That same year, French sociologist [[Georges Friedmann]] brought him and [[Roland Barthes]] together to create a Centre for the Study of Mass Communication that, after several name changes, became the [[Edgar Morin Centre]] of the [[EHESS]], Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=iiac |title=Centre Edgar-Morin |url=http://www.iiac.cnrs.fr/cetsah/spip.php?article207 |accessdate=2010-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023005003/http://www.iiac.cnrs.fr/cetsah/spip.php?article207 |archivedate=October 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1960 Morin and [[Jean Rouch]] coauthored the film [[Chronique d'un été]], an early example of ''[[cinéma vérité]]'' and [[Direct Cinema|direct cinema]].

Beginning in 1965, Morin became involved in a large multidisciplinary project, financed by the Délégation Générale à la Recherche Scientifique et Technologique in [[Plozévet]].

In 1968, Morin replaced [[Henri Lefebvre]] at the [[University of Paris X: Nanterre|University of Nanterre]]. He became involved in the student revolts that began to emerge in France. In May 1968 he wrote a series of articles for [[Le Monde]] that tried to understand what he called "The Student Commune." He followed [[May 1968 in France|the student revolt]] closely and wrote a second series of articles in Le Monde called "The Revolution without a Face," as well as coauthoring ''Mai 68: La brèche'' with [[Cornelius Castoriadis]] and [[Claude Lefort]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Herpen |first=Marcel |title =PARIS MAY '68 AND PROVO AMSTERDAM '65 |url =http://www.cicerofoundation.org/lectures/Marcel_Van_Herpen_May_68_and_Provo_Amsterdam_65.pdf | pages=19 |accessdate =2010-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Morin spent a year at the [[Salk Institute|Salk Institute for Biological Studies]] in [[La Jolla]], California. [[Jonas Salk]] invited him under the recommendation of [[Jacques Monod]] and John Hunt, with the sole imposed condition of learning. It was there, in this "breeding ground for Nobel Prizes" that he familiarized himself with systems theory. He read [[Henri Laborit]], [[James Watson]], [[Stéphane Lupasco]], [[Bronowski]], and was introduced to the thought of [[Gregory Bateson]] and the "new problematic in ecology".&lt;ref&gt;"Penser avec Edgar Morin, Lire La Méthode", Robin Fortin, Presses de l'Université Laval.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983 he published ''De la nature de l’URSS,'' which deepened his analysis of Soviet communism and anticipated the [[perestroika]] of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].

In 2002 Morin participated in the creation of the [[Collegium International|International Ethical, Scientific and Political Collegium]]. Also that year, he made a trip to Iran with Dariush Shayegan.

==Work==
In addition to being the [[UNESCO]] Chair of Complex Thought, Morin is known as a founder of [[transdisciplinarity]] and holds honorary doctorates in a variety of social science fields from 21 universities (Messina, Geneva, Milan, Bergamo, Thessaloniki, La Paz, Odense, Perugia, Cosenza, Palermo, Nuevo León, Université de Laval à Québec, Brussels, Barcelona, Guadalajara, Valencia, Vera Cruz, Santiago, the Catholic University of Porto Alegre, the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte, and Candido Mendes University (Rio de Janeiro)).&lt;ref name=Montuori&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montuori|first1=Alfonso|title=COMPLEX THOUGHT An Overview of Edgar Morin's Intellectual Journey|journal=MetaIntegral Foundation|date=June 2013|volume=Resource Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Messina]] in Sicily, Ricardo Palma University in Lima, and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)]], the French National Research Center in Paris, have established research centers based on his transdisciplinary methods and philosophy.&lt;ref name=Montuori/&gt; In addition, the [[Multiversidad Mundo Real Edgar Morin]], a university based on his work, was established in Mexico. Morin did not embrace the French [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] or [[poststructuralist]] movements, instead pursuing his own research agenda. As a result, US academics did not transport his theories into disciplinary discourses in same fashion as they did Foucault's and Derrida's. Morin's work spans scholarly and popular literature, and he has appeared on the cover of multiple publications including [http://www.scienceshumaines.com/edgar-morin-l-aventure-d-une-pensee_fr_497.htm Sciences Humaines] and a special issue of [http://boutique.lemonde.fr/le-monde-hors-serie-edgar-morin.html Le Monde].

According to Alfonso Montuori in "Edgar Morin: A partial introduction" &lt;blockquote&gt; "The 6 volume Method is perhaps Morin’s culminating work, a remarkable and seemingly inexhaustible treasure trove of insights, reflection, and a real manual for those who are interested in broadening the nature of human inquiry. Drawing on [[cybernetics]], [[information theory]], [[systems theory]], but also integrating all the work he has done before, from the work on imagination in his research on movies to his profound reflections on death, Method integrates Morin’s journey and provides the reader with an alternative to the traditional assumptions and method of inquiry of our time."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1065">'''Endowment''' (in philosophy) refers to the innate capacities of an individual, group, or institution. An individual's "natural endowment" can be abilities, such as intelligence or strength, given at birth. An individual's "social endowment" can be abilities attributed to the individual's position within a social hierarchy. 

According to [[Stephen R. Covey]], author of [[The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People]], there are seven human endowments.  They are listed below.

==Primary endowments==

1) Self-awareness or self-knowledge
 
2) Imagination and conscience 
 
3) Volition or will power

==Secondary endowments==

4) An [[abundance mentality]]

5) Courage and consideration

6) Creativity

7) Self-renewal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6269">{{short description|The evolution of the behaviour in frogs in which both the mother and father raise their offspring}}
The '''Evolution of biparental care in tropical frogs''' is the [[Behavioral ecology|evolution of the behaviour]] of a [[Frog#Parental_care|parental care system in frogs]] in which both the mother and father raise their offspring.

==Evolution==
Many tropical frogs have developed a parental care system where both the mother and father partake in raising their offspring. The evolution of biparental care, which is the joint effort of both parents, is a topic that is still under investigation. Biparentalism arose in some species of tropical frogs as a result of ecological conditions, the differences between the sexes, and their natural tendencies.

Male parental care could have served as the basis for the development of biparental care. Phylogenetic evidence shows that male parental care is the ancestral strategy in ''[[Dendrobates]]''.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"&gt;Summers, K.,and Earn, D.. 1999.''The cost of polygyny and the evolution of female care in poison frogs''. Biological Journal of the Linnean Society 66(4):515-538.&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently there are ''Dendrobates'' species, such as ''[[Reticulated poison frog|D. ventrimaculatus]]'' and ''[[Red-headed poison frog|D. fantasticus]]'', that exhibit biparental care.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"/&gt; The trend of using males to guard or brood eggs for biparental care or paternal care can be understood from the perspective of the female. After oviposition, or when the eggs are laid, the females need to replenish their bodies that have been dedicated to nurturing the eggs before they can mate again.&lt;ref name="Weygoldt"&gt;Weygoldt, P. 1987. ''Evolution of parental care in dart poison frogs''. Journal of Zoological Systematics and Evolutionary Research 25(1):51-67.&lt;/ref&gt; Brooding by the females would delay the opportunity to mate by about two to four weeks.&lt;ref name="Weygoldt"/&gt;Since this outcome would cause many males to compete for a few females that are able to mate, the males are favored for the brooding.&lt;ref name="Weygoldt"/&gt;

==Environment==
The environment can have a substantial impact on the uses of parental care. Not all tropical frogs have the ability to lay their eggs plainly on land or plants. Tropical frogs can choose from a variety of water sources, such as lakes, streams, and small puddles.  There is greater risk involved with reproducing in bigger bodies of water because of the higher likelihood of fish and other aquatic predators being there.&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"&gt;Brown, J. L., Morales, V., and Summers, K.. 2010. ''A Key Ecological Trait Drove the Evolution of Biparental Care and Monogamy in an Amphibian''. The American Naturalist 175(4):436-446.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, frogs can choose to place eggs in [[phytotelma|phytotelmata]].&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"/&gt; However, there is a trade-off that comes with electing a smaller water source. Not much sunlight reaches these locations, so algae and other food sources cannot grow to feed the inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Caldwell &amp; de Oliveira"&gt;Caldwell, J. P., and de Oliveira, V.. 1999. ''Determinants of Biparental Care in the Spotted Poison Frog (Dendrobates vanzolinii)''. Copeia 1999(3):565-575.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tropical frogs must use alternative methods of feeding their tadpole offspring.  In the case of using phytotelmata, it is very difficult for one parent to guard and feed his or her offspring in possibly several different places. Roles performed by both parents provide a great advantage to the offspring.&lt;ref name="Caldwell &amp; de Oliveira"/&gt; As seen in the Amazon Rain Forrest, the different size of the bodies of water chosen for breeding correlates with the amount of biparental care in two very similar species of the ''Ranitomeya'' genus.&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"/&gt;  ''[[Ranitomeya imitator]]'' favors smaller pools and uses biparental care.&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"/&gt; Conversely, ''[[Ranitomeya variabilis]]'' utilizes larger bodies of water for breeding and only males take part in parental care.&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"/&gt;  The ecologic aspects of a species habitat can have significant impacts on the type of parental care exhibited.

==Competition==
[[Trophic egg]] feeding plays a key role in the ability of frogs to breed in smaller bodies of water that lack food sources.&lt;ref name="Brown, Morales and Summers"/&gt;  Many species of tropical frogs have an inherent nature of [[cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]], such as ''[[Dendrobates vanzolinii]]'', that allow their tadpoles to utilize the eggs for nourishment.&lt;ref name="Caldwell &amp; de Oliveira"/&gt; With a male guarding the eggs, an intermediate step to developing biparental care may have been using the eggs from a mating with another female to feed existing tadpoles.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"/&gt; Males could direct where the eggs should be positioned, and then he could move them into the water that holds his tadpole offspring.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"/&gt; This [[polygyny in nature|polygynous]] relationship puts a cost on the female because she loses eggs to benefit offspring that are not her own.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"/&gt; It is possible that the female could counter this effect by participating in biparental care with her mate.&lt;ref name="Summers &amp; Earn"/&gt; Also, since there may be a lack of males, females could benefit from attacking other clutches that her mate might have fertilized.&lt;ref name="Wells"&gt;Wells, K.D. 1978. ''Courtship and Parental Behavior in a Panamanian Poison-Arrow Frog (Dendrobates auratus)''. Herpetologica 34(2):148-155.&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliminating competition of a female’s offspring might result in higher survival of those she is trying to protect.  Females have been seen eating other females’ eggs in captivity by certain species, such as ''[[Dendrobates auratus]]''.&lt;ref name="Wells"/&gt; This [[sexual selection|intrasexual competition]] among the females might have been another important driving force for bringing about biparental care.  Multiple factors contributed to the evolution of biparental care in some species of tropical frogs.

'''Extensionism''' holds that all objects and events extend indefinitely through time and space. Because of constraints inherent in human (and perhaps animal) perceptual apparatus we tend to regard all objects in the world as coherent and discrete, a limitation Professor [[Robert Pepperell]] considers to be caused, in part, by "the coersive effects of time".&lt;ref name="Pepperell 2003"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Postscript to his book ''The Posthuman Condition'', Robert Pepperell continues:

{{quotation|[E]xtensionism recognises the co-presence of opposites (such as a world that is both full of distinctions and devoid of distinctions, or an object that is more than one thing at the same time) without negating or resolving them...&lt;ref name="Pepperell 2003"/&gt;}}

In this regard, extensionism bears a resemblance to the notion of the [[quasi-object]]&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9037">The '''Federation of German Scientists - VDW''' (Vereinigung Deutscher Wissenschaftler e. V.) is a German [[non-governmental organization]].

== History ==
Since its founding 1959 by [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Max Born]] and further prominent [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] scientists, known as [[Göttinger 18]], who had previously publicly declared their position against the nuclear armament of the German [[Bundeswehr]], the Federation has been committed to the ideal of ''responsible [[Wissenschaft]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FGS Brochure|url=https://www.cbd.int/doc/external/mop-04/fgs-1-en.pdf|website=Convention on Biological Diversity|publisher=Federation of German Scientists|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The founders were almost identical to the "[[Göttinger 18]]" (compare the historical [[Göttingen Seven]]).  Both the "[[Göttingen Manifesto]]" and the formation of the VDW were an expression of the new sense of responsibility felt by Otto Hahn and some scientists after the dropping of atomic bombs on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. The VDW tried to mirror the American [[Federation of American Scientists|Federation of Atomic Scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Zukünfte: Aufstieg und Krise der Zukunftsforschung 1945-1980|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=W4wFCgAAQBAJ|publisher = Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG|date = 2015-07-01|isbn = 9783110349122|language = de|first = Elke|last = Seefried}}&lt;/ref&gt; VDW has been identified as Western Germany's [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|Pugwash]] group.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Gottstein: Erinnerungen an Pugwash und an die Rolle der VDW als deutsche Pugwash-Gruppe. In: Götz Neuneck und Michael Schaaf (Hrsg.): Zur Geschichte der Pugwash-Bewegung in Deutschland. Max-Planck-Institut für Wissenschaftsgeschichte, 2007, p. 39–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of VDW feel committed to taking into consideration the possible military, political and economical implications and possibilities of atomic misuse when carrying out their scientific research and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Albrecht, Hans-Joachim Bieber, Reiner Braun, Peter Croll, Henner Ehringhaus, Maria Finckh, Hartmut Graßl, Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker (Hrsg.): Wissenschaft – Verantwortung – Frieden: 50 Jahre VDW, Berlin 2009, {{ISBN|978-3-8305-1704-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation of German Scientists comprises around 400 scholars of different fields. The Federation of German Scientists addresses both interested members of the public and decision-makers on all levels of politics and society with its work. The politician [[Egon Bahr]] was a longstanding member. [[Georg Picht]] presented a radio series about the [[The Limits to Growth|Limits of growth]] on behalf of the VDW in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Zukunft und Utopie|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GgwCIjUmFZUC|publisher = Klett-Cotta|date = 1992-01-01|isbn = 9783608916218|language = de|first = Georg|last = Picht}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005/2006, the VDW was the patron and main contributor to the [[Potsdam Manifesto]]‚ 'We have to learn to think in a new way’ and the [[Potsdam Denkschrift]].  2015 [[Hartmut Graßl]], a former [[Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy|Wuppertal Institute]] s&lt;nowiki/&gt;cientist took over the chair of VDW from Ulrich Bartosch, a political scientist at [[Catholic University of Eichstätt-Ingolstadt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Neue Spitze bei der Vereinigung Deutscher Wissenschaftler|url = http://wupperinst.org/info/details/wi/a/s/ad/3291/|website = wupperinst.org|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VDW was closely connected with the German [[Peace movement|Friedensbewegung]] (peace movement) in the 1980s. After 1999 VDW tried to regain public interest with the establishment of the Whistleblower Prize, awarded together with the German branch of the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms ILANA.

The Whistleblower Prize worth 3,000 euro, is given biannually and was established in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/snowden-gets-whistleblower-award-in-germany/483527.html#ixzz2i2K4sbSm Snowden Gets Whistleblower Award in Germany | News]. The Moscow Times.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, the selection of [[Gilles-Éric Séralini]] generated some controversy. Ulrich Bahnsen in ''Die Zeit'' described VDW and ILANA as consisting of ''[[busybody]]s with best wills - and worst possible outcome in the case of this award''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gentechnik: Ausgezeichnete Pfeife|url = http://www.zeit.de/2015/39/whistleblower-gentechnik-glyphosat-kritik|website = ZEIT ONLINE|accessdate = 2015-12-16|first = Von Ulrich|last = Bahnsen|quote = Nun sind VDW und Ialana von sicherlich guten Menschen mit besten Absichten bevölkert, was stets befürchten lässt, dass die Sache den schlechtesten Ausgang nimmt.|date = 8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion piece, featured in [[Die Zeit|Zeit Online]], described the awarding of Séralini as a failure, and viewed his status as a "whistleblower" as questionable, in light of his use of "junk science" to support anti-GMO activism.&lt;ref name="zo"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Zeit Online |language=de |quote=Séralini ist in der Wissenschaft zu Recht und zur Gänze diskreditiert |author=Ulrich Bahnsen |date=8 October 2015 |url=http://www.zeit.de/2015/39/whistleblower-gentechnik-glyphosat-kritik |title=Ausgezeichnete Pfeife}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fogging''' is a type of visual censorship. An area for a picture or movie is blurred to obscure it from sight. This form of [[censorship]] is used for sexually related images/scenes, hiding [[genitals]], [[pubic hair]], or [[sexual penetration]] of any sort. [[Pixelization]] is a form of fogging. In [[Japan]], where it is called ''bokashi'', fogging is employed on most films that show pubic hair or genitals, including [[hardcore pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eiga9.altervista.org/articulos/obscenity.html|title=Obscenity and Article 175 of the Japanese Penal Code: A Short Introduction to Japanese Censorship|accessdate=2014-05-08|last=da Silva|first=Joaquin|date=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of editing also appears in television programs where an individual's face may not be shown due to legal or privacy concerns. As it does not contrast with the surrounding image very much, it is preferable over most other forms of censorship.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} Fogging is also used if the scenes which are too bloody and gruesome to be rendered even in black and white, over vehicle license plates, mainly to protect the identities of the vehicles' owners, and over branded items and specific company names to obscure their background.

'''Gerald C. MacCallum Jr.''' (June 16, 1925 – January 14, 1987) was an American philosopher. He was Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=William H. Hay|author2=Rex Martin|author3=Marcus Singer|last-author-amp=yes|title=Gerald C.

MacCallum is well known for his critique to the distinction, made famous by [[Isaiah Berlin]], between [[Negative liberty|negative]] and [[positive liberty]], proposing instead that the concept of freedom can only be understood as a 'triadic relation', in which "'''x''' is (is not) free from '''y''' to do (not do, become, not become) '''z'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacCallum|first=Gerald C.|title=Negative and Positive Freedom|journal=The Philosophical Review|date=July 1967|volume=76|issue=3|pages=314|doi=10.2307/2183622}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "'''identifiable victim effect'''" refers to the tendency of individuals to offer greater aid when a specific, identifiable person ("victim") is observed under hardship, as compared to a large, vaguely defined group with the same need.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jenni|first=Karen|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=1997-05-01|title=Explaining the Identifiable Victim Effect|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007740225484|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|language=en|volume=14|issue=3|pages=235–257|doi=10.1023/A:1007740225484|issn=0895-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is also observed when subjects administer [[punishment]] rather than reward. Research has shown that individuals can be more likely to mete out punishment, even at their own expense, when they are punishing specific, identifiable individuals ("perpetrators").&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=2005-12-01|title=The devil you know: the effects of identifiability on punishment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bdm.507/abstract|journal=Journal of Behavioral Decision Making|language=en|volume=18|issue=5|pages=311–318|doi=10.1002/bdm.507|issn=1099-0771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concrete images and representations are often more powerful sources of persuasion than are abstract statistics.&lt;ref name="Collins &amp; Taylor, 1988"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collins|first=Rebecca L.|last2=Taylor|first2=Shelley E.|last3=Wood|first3=Joanne V.|last4=Thompson|first4=Suzanne C.|date=1988-01-01|title=The vividness effect: Elusive or illusory?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022103188900418|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=24|issue=1|pages=1–18|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(88)90041-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Ryan White]] contracted [[HIV/AIDS|HIV]] at age 13 and struggled with the disease until succumbing some six years later. Following his death, the US congress passed the [[Ryan White Care Act]], which funded the largest set of services for people living with the AIDS in the country.&lt;ref name= "Ryan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhhr.wv.gov/oeps/std-hiv-hep/HIV_AIDS/caresupport/Pages/RyanWhiteCareAct.aspx|title=Ryan White and Care Act History|last=|first=|date=|website=dhhr.wv.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect is epitomized by the phrase (commonly attributed to [[Joseph Stalin]]) "A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic."&lt;ref&gt;http://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/21/death-statistic/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
The conceptualization of the identifiable victim effect as it is known today is commonly attributed to American economist [[Thomas Schelling]]. He wrote that harm to a particular person invokes “anxiety and sentiment, guilt and awe, responsibility and religion, [but]…most of this awesomeness disappears when we deal with statistical death”.&lt;ref name="Schelling, 1968"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schelling|first=Thomas, C|date=|year=1968|editor-last=Chase|title=The Life You Save May Be Your Own|url=|journal=Problems in public expenditure analysis (pp. 127–162). :|publisher=The Brookings Institution|volume=|pages=127–162|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==

=== ''Ex post'' vs ''ex ante'' evaluation ===

The decision to save an identifiable victim is made ''ex post'', meaning it is done ''after'' the victim is in danger. In contrast, the decision to save a statistical victim is often made ''ex ante'', as a pre-emptive measure to ''prevent'' the individual from being in danger.&lt;ref name="Weinstein, Shepard, &amp; Pliskin, 1980"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weinstein|first=M|last2=Shepard|first2=D|last3=Pliskin|first3=J|year=1980|title=The Economic Value of Changing Mortality Probabilities: A Decision-Theoretic Approach|url=|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=94 |issue=2|pages=373–396|via=|doi=10.2307/1884546}}&lt;/ref&gt; When people consider the risks of not helping a victim, they consider the probability of being responsible and blamed.&lt;ref name="Douglas, 2017"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-7B2338nHGgC&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=douglas%20risk%20and%20blame|title=Risk and Blame|last=Douglas|first=Professor Mary|last2=Douglas|first2=Professor of Anthropology Mary|date=2013-06-17|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136490040|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This probability is much greater with identifiable victims than with statistical victims because one cannot accurately predict the likelihood of a tragedy occurring in the future and thus cannot be held responsible for tragedies that ''might'' occur in the future.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt; (Although, Jenni, &amp; Loewenstein (1997) have found no evidence to support the effect of ex post/ex ante on IVE)

This explanation is closest to what Thomas Schelling implied in his now-famous paper.

=== Vividness ===
Identifiable victims, as their name suggests, have features that make them identifiable. Details about their predicament, family background, educational history, etc., are shared through the media and brought to public attention. The stories are emotional, with victims often portrayed as innocent and helpless. For example, Perrault et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Silk|first2=Kami J.|last3=Sheff|first3=Sarah|last4=Ahn|first4=Jisoo|last5=Hoffman|first5=Alice|last6=Totzkay|first6=Daniel|date=2015-10-02|title=Testing the Identifiable Victim Effect With Both Animal and Human Victims in Anti-Littering Messages|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/08824096.2015.1089857|journal=Communication Research Reports|volume=32|issue=4|pages=294–303|doi=10.1080/08824096.2015.1089857|issn=0882-4096}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested an identifiable human victim message, in relation to an identifiable animal victim (i.e., a squirrel) using the context of the consequences of littering, and found the identifiable animal message - an innocent and helpless creature - elicited greater levels of distress and empathy than the identifiable human message. Images and videos of the victim are often shared, and the public is able to follow the victim's predicament in real-time. Studies have previously indicated that people respond more to concrete, graphic information than abstract, statistical information.&lt;ref name= "Nisbett, 1980"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human Inference: Strategies and Shortcomings of Social Judgment|last=Nisbett|first=Richard|last2=Ross|first2=Lee|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1980|isbn=978-0134451305|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vividness of identifiable victims creates a sense of familiarity and social closeness(opposite of social distance).Therefore, identifiable victims elicit greater reactions from people than statistical victims. (Although, Jenni, &amp; Loewenstein (1997) have found no evidence to support this effect)

=== Certainty effect, risk-seeking for losses and loss aversion ===

The certainty effect and risk seeking for losses reinforce each other. The [[certainty effect]] is the inclination to place disproportionately greater weighting to certain outcomes than to uncertain but likely outcomes.&lt;ref name= "Kanheman &amp; Tversky, 1979"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kahneman|first=Daniel|last2=Tversky|first2=Amos|date=1979-01-01|title=Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk|jstor=1914185|journal=Econometrica|volume=47|issue=2|pages=263–291|doi=10.2307/1914185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The consequences to identifiable victims are viewed as certain to occur whereas the consequences to statistical victims are viewed as probabilistic.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt; Research has also shown the tendency of people to be risk-seeking for losses.&lt;ref name= "Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1986"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tversky|first=Amos|last2=Kahneman|first2=Daniel|date=1986-01-01|title=Rational Choice and the Framing of Decisions|jstor=2352759|journal=The Journal of Business|volume=59|issue=4|pages=S251–S278}}&lt;/ref&gt; A certain loss is viewed more negatively than an uncertain loss with the same expected value. Closely related to this is people tend to be loss averse.&lt;ref name= "Kanheman &amp; Tversky, 1979" /&gt; They view saving a statistical life as a gain whereas saving an identifiable victim is seen as avoiding a loss. Together, these effects result in people being more likely to aid identifiable, certain victims than statistical, uncertain victims.

=== Response to the relative size of the reference group ===

Risk that is concentrated is perceived as greater than the same risk dispersed over a wider population. Identifiable victims are their own reference group; if they do not receive aid then the entire reference group is regarded to perish.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt; To illustrate this point, consider an explosion at an offshore oil rig where 50 people work. Suppose all 50 people die in the explosion, this represents 50 of the thousands of people working on offshore oil rigs. Yet, the reference group is not the thousands of people working on offshore oil rigs but rather the 50 people working on that particular offshore oil rig. Therefore, this is perceived as 50 of 50 people certain to die so by aiding them, a significant proportion of the reference group can be saved.

People's response to the proportion of the reference group that can be saved is such a significant contributor to the identifiable victim effect that this effect could be re-labelled as the “percentage of reference group saved effect”.&lt;ref name= "Jenni &amp; Loewenstein, 1997" /&gt;

== Implications and examples ==

=== Aiding ===
One implication of the identifiable victim effect is identifiable victims are more likely to be helped than statistical victims.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Small|first=Deborah A.|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|date=2003-01-01|title=Helping a Victim or Helping the Victim: Altruism and Identifiability|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022299422219|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=5–16|doi=10.1023/A:1022299422219|issn=0895-5646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident that frequently features in literature is the aid given to Jessica McClure and her family.&lt;ref name= "Loewenstein &amp; Small, 2005" /&gt; On October 14, 1987, 18-month old Jessica McClure fell into a narrow well in her aunt's home cum day-care centre in Midland, Texas.&lt;ref name= "Loewenstein &amp; Small, 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loewenstein|first=George|last2=Small|first2=Deborah|last3=Strnad|first3=Jeff|date=2005-03-01|title=Statistical, Identifiable and Iconic Victims and Perpetrators|ssrn=678281|location=Rochester, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within hours, 'Baby Jessica', as she became known, made headlines around the US. The public reacted with sympathy towards her ordeal. While teams of rescue workers, paramedics and volunteers worked to successfully rescue 'Baby Jessica' in 58 hours, a total of $700,000 was amassed in that time. Even after being discharged from hospital, the McClure family were flooded with cards and gifts from members of the public as well as a visit from then-Vice President George H.W. Bush and a telephone call from then-President Ronald Reagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/baby-jessica-rescued-from-a-well-as-the-world-watches|title=October 16, 1987 : Baby Jessica rescued from a well as the world watches|first=|date=2011|website=history.com|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-12|quote=|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Punishment ===
The identifiable victim effect is suggested to be a specific case of a more general 'identifiable other effect'.&lt;ref name= "Loewenstein &amp; Small, 2005" /&gt; As such, it also has an effect on punishments. People prefer to punish identified transgressors rather than unidentified transgressors when given a choice between the two. People also exert more severe punishments on identified than unidentified transgressors.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

Individuals are also more likely to assign blame to an identified transgressor if they feel they have been wronged. There is also an increased desire for harsh punishments that persists even when self-sacrifice is required in order to punish the transgressor. This effect can possibly be explained by the increased anger felt towards an identified rather than an unidentified transgressor. This supports the theory of “vividness” as a source of the identifiable victim effect (Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005).&lt;ref name = "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

=== Public policy ===

==== Healthcare ====

The identifiable victim effect may also influence healthcare, both at the individual and national level (Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990).&lt;ref name= "Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Redelmeir | first1 = D. A. | last2 = Tversky | first2 = A. | year = 1990 | title = Discrepancy between medical decisions for individual patients and for groups | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3840/ba46475c2c8d39bb786d304584cb84ae0a10.pdf#page=904 | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 322 | issue = 16| pages = 1162–1164 | doi=10.1056/nejm199004193221620}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the individual level, doctors are more likely to recommend expensive, but potentially life-saving, treatments to an individual patient rather than to a group of patients. This effect is not limited to medical professionals, as laymen demonstrate this same bias towards providing more expensive treatments for individual patients (Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990).&lt;ref name= "Redelmeir &amp; Tversky, 1990" /&gt; On the national level, the American people are far more likely to contribute to an expensive treatment to save the life of one person rather than spend much smaller amounts on [[Preventive healthcare|preventative measures]] that could save the lives of thousands per year. A function of American [[individualism]], this nationwide bias towards expensive treatments is still prevalent today (Toufexis &amp; Bjerklie, 1993).&lt;ref name= "Toufexis &amp; Bjerklie, 1993"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toufexis | first1 = A. | last2 = Bjerklie | first2 = D. | year = 1993 | title = The ultimate choice | url = http://web.a.ebscohost.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=938602b4-df0c-46ad-9002-c3a01fe3bf00%40sessionmgr4009&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4214&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=9308240013&amp;db=aph | journal = Time | volume = 142 | issue = 9| page = 43 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ryan White Care Act =====
The need to tackle the problems faced by AIDS sufferers was brought to the political forefront as a result of the legal and social plight of one particular AIDS victim, Ryan White. His circumstances and campaign for greater funding for AIDS research were widely publicised in the media which culminated in legislation being passed to provide financial support to AIDS sufferers and their families in 1990 shortly after White's death.&lt;ref name= "Ryan" /&gt;

==== Criminal justice ====

Since the identifiable victim effect can influence punishment, it has the potential to undermine the system of trial by jury (Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005).&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt; Jurors, when deliberating, work with an identifiable perpetrator, and thus may attach negative emotions (e.g. disgust, anger) to the individual or assign increased blame when handing down a harsh sentence. Policymakers, who are unable to see the individual offender, being almost entirely emotionally removed, may actually have intended a more lenient sentence. This may produce a harsher verdict than the legal guidelines recommend or allow. On the other extreme, jurors may feel [[sympathy]], relating with the perpetrator on a level not experienced by policymakers, leading to a milder verdict than legally appropriate or allowable (Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005).&lt;ref name = "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

Typically in crime investigations, law enforcement forces conceal any information regarding the identities of the suspects until they have strong evidence that the suspects are credible. When identities of suspects are revealed through description of their features or release of their images, media coverage and public discussion on the issue grows. On one side, the public discourse can become increasingly negative and hostile, or, if the perpetrator is sympathetic, support for the perpetrator may grow. This is because people experience a greater emotional reaction towards a concrete, identifiable perpetrator than an abstract, unidentifiable one.&lt;ref name = "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2005" /&gt;

=====Brady Bill =====
[[James Brady|James S. Brady]], the then-White House press secretary, was among three collateral damage victims in the attempted assassination of President Reagan in 1981. Brady was explicitly named in reports of the shooting in contrast to the other two injured, a District of Columbia police officer and a Secret Service agent. The political reaction was largely focused on the injuries of Brady which led to the enactment of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993]]. It states that it is mandatory for firearm dealers to perform background searches on firearm purchasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/brady-act-gun-buyer-background-checks-3321492|title=Brady Act Gun Buyer Background Checks|last=Longley|first=Robert|date=August 23, 2016|website=thoughtco.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business ethics ===

According to a 2016 study by Yam and Reynolds, the growing absence of the identifiable victim effect in the business world may contribute to an increase in unethical business behavior.&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yam | first1 = K. C. | last2 = Reynolds | first2 = S. J. | year = 2016 | title = The effects of victim anonymity on unethical behavior | url = https://link-springer-com.proxy.library.nd.edu/article/10.1007/s10551-014-2367-5 | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | volume = 136 | issue = 1| pages = 13–22 | doi=10.1007/s10551-014-2367-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasingly [[Globalization|globalized]] business framework, the identifiable victim effect may become naturally mediated, freeing business leaders and employees alike to engage in unethical behavior without guilt or emotional distress. This may be possible because globalization results in less face-to-face contact, decreasing the identifiability of possible victims. Research suggests that business leaders, as well as workers, are more likely to engage in unethical behavior when the victims of their behavior are anonymous. At the executive level, one possible result of this is worker [[commodification]] and exploitation. At the worker level, employees of a company are possibly more likely to steal from the company or lie on a report if they do not believe this behavior will negatively affect a recognizable coworker. A decrease in recognizable coworkers could thus potentially lead to an increase in unethical behavior by workers (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; Research also suggests that outside observers, not only perpetrators, view unethical behavior as less unethical if the victim of the unethical behavior is unidentified (Gino, Shu, &amp; Bazerman, 2010).&lt;ref name= "Gino, Shu, &amp; Bazerman, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gino | first1 = F. | last2 = Shu | first2 = L. L. | last3 = Bazerman | first3 = M. H. | year = 2010 | title = Nameless + harmless = blameless: When seemingly irrelevant factors influence judgment of (un)ethical behavior | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/science/article/pii/S0749597809001022 | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 111 | issue = 2| pages = 93–101 | doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2009.11.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could possibly result in less public outcry against unethical practices in a globalized business environment, where the victims are often unseen.

== Moderating factors ==

=== Attachment anxiety ===

High levels of [[Attachment in adults|attachment anxiety]] may increase the power of identifiable victim effect. Research indicates that individuals with high levels of attachment anxiety may donate more to identified victims and donate less to unidentified victims than the average person (Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013).&lt;ref name="Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kogut | first1 = T. | last2 = Kogut | first2 = E. | year = 2013 | title = Exploring the relationship between adult attachment style and the identifiable victim effect in helping behavior | url = http://isiarticles.com/bundles/Article/pre/pdf/73400.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 49 | issue = 4| pages = 651–660 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2013.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a study by Kogut and Kogut, attachment anxiety may reduce the expression of [[Altruism|altruistic tendencies]], commonly demonstrated by charitable giving. Researchers hypothesize that this is because anxiously-attached individuals focus their time and energy on dealing with their own vulnerabilities, leaving them no mental energy to focus on the well-being of others. However, this would only be true of the unidentified individual. When faced with an identified victim, individuals who are anxiously attached tend to donate more money than the average individual. This aligns with past research indicating that anxiously attached people experience significantly more personal distress than those securely attached when confronted with victims in need (Mikulincer et al., 2001).&lt;ref name="Mikulincer et al., 2001"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Gillath | first2 = O. | last3 = Halevy | first3 = V. | last4 = Avihou | first4 = N. | last5 = Avidan | first5 = S. | display-authors = 5 | last6 = et al | year = 2001 | title = Attachment theory and reactions to others' needs: Evidence that activation of the sense of attachment security promotes empathic responses | url = http://psycnet.apa.org.proxy.library.nd.edu/journals/psp/81/6/1205/ | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 81 | issue = 6| pages = 1205–1224 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.81.6.1205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although anxiously-attached people may participate in [[prosocial behavior]]s, such as donating money to a charity, their actions are suggested not to be the result of altruistic tendencies, but instead "positively correlated with egoistic, rather than altruistic motives for helping and volunteering."(p 652)(Kogut, T. &amp; Kogut E., 2013).&lt;ref name="Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013" /&gt; Thus, researchers hypothesize that anxiously attached individuals are more likely to help identified victims only because they will personally benefit. This is possibly because the identified victim can fulfill the desire for personal attachment, not because the victim is in need. It is important to note that their increased helpfulness only extends to easy, effortless actions, such as donating money. It does not extend to particularly difficult or effortful actions, such as donating time (Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013).&lt;ref name="Kogut &amp; Kogut, 2013" /&gt;

=== Guilt ===

Research suggests that guilt reduces the power of the identifiable victim effect (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; Before engaging in a behavior, an individual conducts an assessment of the possible emotional outcomes of that behavior. An individual is drawn towards behaviors that would make them happy and repulsed by those that would make them upset. Thus, a person with a high level of guilt is drawn towards altruistic acts because they serve to alleviate the negative emotions that they are experiencing. Consequently, the presence of guilt may actually increase the occurrence of altruistic behavior, such as charitable donations, regardless of whether the victim they are helping is identified or not. Research also suggests that anticipated guilt reduces the occurrence of unethical behavior that may negatively affect an identified victim (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; This may be because knowingly and negatively affecting a recognizable victim causes the individual engaging in unethical behavior to experience distress and negative emotions.

=== Reasoning style ===

Research suggests that individual differences in reasoning style moderate the identifiable victim effect (Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010).&lt;ref name= "Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friedrich | first1 = J. | last2 = McGuire | first2 = A. | year = 2010 | title = Individual differences in reasoning style as a moderator of the identifiable victim effect | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15534511003707352 | journal = Social Influence | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 182–201 | doi=10.1080/15534511003707352}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two different methods of reasoning are “experiential” and “rational”. [[Cognitive-experiential self-theory#Intuitive-experiential system|Experiential thinking]] (e.g. emotionally-based thinking) is automatic, contextual and fluid, and [[Cognitive-experiential self-theory#Analytical-rational system|rational thinking]] (e.g. logically-based thinking) is deliberative, analytical, and decontextualized. Experiential thinking styles may increase the power of the identifiable victim effect, and rational thinking styles may decrease the power of the identifiable victim effect. Researchers theorize that these differences result because experiential thinkers rely on emotional responses towards an issue when making a decision. In contrast, rational thinkers analyze the situation as a whole before making a decision. Thus, a person thinking rationally would respond to all victims equally, not giving preference to those specifically named or otherwise identified, just as experiential thinkers would be drawn towards the more emotionally charged identified victim (Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010).&lt;ref name= "Friedrich &amp; McGuire, 2010" /&gt;

== Criticism ==
The identifiable victim effect has been contested in academia. Critics argue that, when a victim is identified, information such as age and gender of the victim are revealed and people are especially sympathetic in response to that information rather than to identifiability ''per se''.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2003" /&gt;

In 2003, Deborah Small and George Loewenstein conducted an experiment that mitigated this issue. Identifiability was strictly limited to the ''determination'' of the victim's identity.&lt;ref name= "Small &amp; Loewenstein, 2003" /&gt; Therefore, the victim had already been identified regardless of whether the participants had known anything specific about their identity or not. The circumstances of the victim were more palpable and thus elicited greater sympathy from participants. In contrast, the identities of statistical victims were not yet determined. As such, participants found it more difficult to sympathize with indeterminate victims.

=== Identification ===

In certain situations, identification of a victim can actually reduce the amount of help offered to that individual. Research suggests that if an individual is seen as responsible for their plight, people are less likely to offer help than if the victim was not identified at all (Kogut, 2011).&lt;ref name= "Kogut, 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kogut | first1 = T | year = 2011 | title = Someone to blame: when identifying a victim decreases helping | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/store/10.1002/bdm.492/asset/492_ftp.pdf?v=1&amp;t=j1vk6fsl&amp;s=1a3860951722425fce0c1b7d8c04c57cc7ec8f93 | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 47 | issue = 4| pages = 748–755 | doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2011.02.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most research dedicated to the identifiable victim effect avoids the topic of blame, using explicitly blameless individuals, such as children suffering from an illness (Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005).&lt;ref name= "Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kogut | first1 = T. | last2 = Ritov | first2 = I. | year = 2005 | title = The "identified victim" effect: an identified group, or just a single individual? | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/store/10.1002/bdm.492/asset/492_ftp.pdf?v=1&amp;t=j1vk6fsl&amp;s=1a3860951722425fce0c1b7d8c04c57cc7ec8f93 | journal = Journal of Behavioral Decision Making | volume = 18 | issue = 3| pages = 157–165 | doi=10.1002/bdm.492}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are real-world situations where victims may be seen as to blame for their current situation. For example, in a 2011 study by Kogut, individuals were less likely to offer help to an AIDS victim if the victim had contracted AIDS through sexual contact than if the individual was born with AIDS. In other words, individuals were less likely to offer help to victims if they were seen as at least partially responsible for their plight. A meta-study conducted in 2016 supports these findings, reporting that charitable donations were highest when the victim showed little responsibility for their victimization (Lee &amp; Feeley, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Lee &amp; Feeley, 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lee | first1 = S. | last2 = Feeley | first2 = T. H. | year = 2016 | title = The identifiable victim effect: A meta-analytic review | url = http://www.tandfonline.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/doi/abs/10.1080/15534510.2016.1216891 | journal = Social Influence | volume = 11 | issue = 3| pages = 199–215 | doi=10.1080/15534510.2016.1216891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In such cases where victim blaming is possible, identification of individuals may not induce sympathy and may actually increase negative perception of the victim (Kogut, 2011).&lt;ref name= "Kogut, 2011" /&gt; This reduction in help is even more pronounced if the individual believes in the [[Just-world hypothesis|just world hypothesis]], which is the tendency for people to blame the victim for what has happened to them. This pattern of blame results from a desire to believe that the world is predictable and orderly and that those who suffer must have done something to deserve their suffering.

=== Individual applicability  ===

Research may indicate that the identifiable victim effect only affects identified individuals, not identified groups (Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005).&lt;ref name= "Kogut &amp; Ritov, 2005" /&gt; A 2005 study by Kogut and Ritov asked participants how much they would be willing to donate to either a critically ill child or a group of eight critically ill children. Although identification of the individual child increased donations, identification of the group of children as a whole did not. Researchers also found that, although both the individual and group evoked similar amounts of empathy, individual victims evoked more emotional distress than groups of victims. Continuing from this, researchers hypothesized that [[Psychological pain|emotional distress]], not empathy, appears to be positively correlated with desire to help, or “willingness to contribute.” This supports the idea that altruistic acts may serve as coping mechanisms to alleviate negative emotions, such as guilt (Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016).&lt;ref name= "Yam &amp; Reynolds, 2016" /&gt; This also supports later research that suggests distress and sympathy are the driving emotional factors behind the identifiable victim effect (Erlandsson, Björklund, &amp; Bäckström, 2015).&lt;ref name= "Erlandsson, Björklund, &amp; Bäckström, 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Erlandsson | first1 = A. | last2 = Björklund | first2 = F. | last3 = Bäckström | first3 = M. | year = 2015 | title = Emotional reactions, perceived impact and perceived responsibility mediate the identifiable victim effect, proportion dominance effect and in-group effect respectively | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com.proxy.library.nd.edu/science/article/pii/S0749597814001022 | journal = Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes | volume = 127 | issue = | pages = 1–14 | doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2014.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Incivility''' is a general term for social behaviour lacking in civility or good [[manners]], on a scale from [[rude]]ness or lack of [[respect]] for elders, to [[vandalism]] and [[hooliganism]], through [[public drunkenness]] and threatening behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/results/?view=dict&amp;freesearch=incivility&amp;branch=13842570&amp;textsearchtype=exact |work=[[AskOxford]] |title=Definition of 'Incivility{{'-}} |accessdate=2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "incivility" is derived from the Latin ''incivilis'', meaning "not of a citizen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Catherine Soanes, Angus Stevenson (Eds.) |title=The Oxford Dictionary of English (revised edition) |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinction between plain rudeness, and perceived incivility as threat, will depend on some notion of civility as structural to society; incivility as anything more ominous than bad manners is therefore dependent on appeal to notions like its antagonism to the complex concepts of [[civic virtue]] or [[civil society]]. It has become a contemporary political issue in a number of countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Incivility in Political Discourse (The Coming Apogee of the Moonbat Hordes) |work=[http://www.indcjournal.com/ InDC Journal] |url=http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |accessdate=2006-11-25 |date=2004-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130103133948/http://www.indcjournal.com/archives/001136.php |archivedate=2013-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uncivil communication ==
Civil behavior requires that people communicate with respect, restraint, and responsibility, and uncivil communication occurs when people fail to do so.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lane|last2=McCourt|title=Uncivil Communication in Everyday Life: A Response to Benson’s "The Rhetoric of Civility."|journal=Journal of Contemporary Rhetoric|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal pragmatics]], a term coined by [[Jürgen Habermas]], suggests that human conflict arises from miscommunication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Communication and the Evolution of Society|last=Habermas|first=Jurgen|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1979|isbn=|location=Toronto, Canda|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; so [[communicative competence]] is needed to reduce [[Conflict (process)|conflict]]. Communication competence "involves the ability to communicate in such a way that: (1) the truth claim of an utterance is shared by both speaker and hearer; (2) the hearer is led to understand and accept the speaker’s intention; and (3) the speaker adapts to the hearer’s world view."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric|last=Herrick|first=James|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2005|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If people disagree about the truth or appropriateness of their interaction, conflict will occur.

According to Habermas, we should establish communicative [[Norm (social)|norms]] that lead to rational conversations by creating the social coordination needed for interactants to pursue their goals while recognizing the truth or appropriateness of their interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theory of Communicative Action, trans. Thomas McCarthy|last=Habermas|first=Jurgen|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1984|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such norms, or social rules, include: "all participants must be allowed to speak freely, all participants must be allowed to speak for themselves (to enable them to establish their own [[ethos]] or "selfhood"), and that communication should be equal, with no one participant commanding more attention from the others than is afforded to them on their turn."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some examples of uncivil communication include rude gestures, vulgar language, interrupting, and loudly having private discussions in public spaces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Recent poll data suggests that Americans believe uncivil communication is a serious problem, and believe it has led to an increase in physical violence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webershandwick.com/news/article/civility-in-america-2013-incivility-has-reached-crisis-levels|title=News - Civility in America 2013: Incivility has reached crisis levels - Weber Shandwick|website=www.webershandwick.com|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2013 study on ''Civility in America: A Nationwide Survey'', conducted by global public relations firm [[Weber Shandwick]] and public affairs firm Powell Tate in partnership with KRC Research found that 70 percent of Americans believe incivility has reached crisis proportions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Of those who expect civility to rise, 34 percent blame [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The study found that Americans encounter incivility, on average, 17.1 times per week, or 2.4 times per day.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some studies suggest that uncivil communication may have real consequences, including increased health problems due to stress, decreased work productivity, more auto accidents caused by aggressive driving, and [[vandalism]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Political incivility ==
Political incivility is different from the everyday incivility described above. According to [[face negotiation theory]], politeness norms require us to avoid challenging others, but political incivility is different because, since it is specific to the political sphere, contestation of views and confrontation are required for a [[democracy]] to occur.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massaro|last2=Stryker|year=2012|title=Freedom of speech, liberal democracy and emerging evidence on civility and effective democratic engagement|ssrn=2042171|journal=Arizona Law Review|volume=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas Benson, "Where there is disagreement, there is a risk of incivility; in many cases, incivility is itself a tactic in political discourse, employed as an indicator of sincerity, as the marker of the high stakes in a disagreement."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benson|first=Thomas|year=2011|title=The Rhetoric of Civility: Power, Authenticity, and Democracy|url=http://www.contemporaryrhetoric.com/articles/benson1_3.pdf|journal=Journal of Contemporary Rhetoric|volume=1|pages=22–30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Civil discourse]] is "the free and respectful exchange of different ideas".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coe|last2=Kenski|last3=Rains|title=Online and uncivil? Patterns and determinants of incivility in newspaper website commentary|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=64|doi=10.1111/jcom.12104}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight out of 10 Americans believe that the lack of civil discourse in the political system is a serious problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://publicreligion.org/research/2010/11/americans-say-elections-more-negative-than-past-lack-of-civility-as-major-problem|title=Americans Say Elections More Negative than Past, Lack of Civility as Major Problem - PRRI|newspaper=PRRI|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty-two percent of American respondents to a 2011 survey felt that political advertisements were too "nasty" and 72 percent believed that political commercials that attacked the opponent were "inappropriate".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fridkin|first=Kim L.|last2=Kenney|first2=Patrick|date=2011-04-01|title=Variability in Citizens’ Reactions to Different Types of Negative Campaigns|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00494.x/abstract|journal=American Journal of Political Science|language=en|volume=55|issue=2|pages=307–325|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2010.00494.x|issn=1540-5907}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has linked political incivility to reduced trust in the legitimacy of political candidates, political polarization, and policy gridlock.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stryker|first=Robin|last2=Conway|first2=Bethany Anne|last3=Danielson|first3=J.

The public also participates in civil discourse, and incivility. Incivility in these contexts can lead to the breakdown of political discourse, and exclude certain people or groups from the discussion&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Papacharissi|first=Zizi|date=2014|title=Democracy online: Civility, politeness, and the democratic potential of online political discussion groups|url=|journal=New Media &amp; Society|volume=6|pages=259-283|via=SAGE}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouffe|first=Chantal|date=1998|title=Deliberative democracy or agonistic pluralism?|url=|journal=Dialogue International Edition|volume=7|pages=9-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If people or groups are systematically excluded from the discussion, the democratic nature of that discussion is called into question&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. 

In his article ''[[The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article (1964)]]'', Habermas explains that the [[public sphere]] is "a realm of our social life in which something approaching public opinion can be formed… Although state authority is so to speak the executor of the political public sphere, it is not a part of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habermas|first=Jürgen|last2=Lennox|first2=Sara|last3=Lennox|first3=Frank|date=1974-01-01|title=The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article (1964)|jstor=487737|journal=New German Critique|issue=3|pages=49–55|doi=10.2307/487737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political incivility threatens the features of the rhetorical model of the public sphere,&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vernacular Voices: The Rhetoric of Publics and Public Spheres|last=Hauser|first=Gerard|publisher=The University of South Carolina Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=61–64|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which include:
# It is discourse-based as opposed to class-based.
# Norm of reasonableness, meaning the success of an argument depends on participants agreeing that it makes sense.
# It "emphasizes indeterminate bracketing of discursive exchanges", meaning the public sphere is made up of many smaller conversations that happen independently of each other.
# Values communication that leads to shared judgments.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Political incivility threatens the future of the rhetorical model of the public sphere because it fractures that sphere into counter-publics, which may or may not interact with each other&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. According to Papacharissi (2004), "Incivility can then be operationalized as the set of behaviors that threaten democracy, deny people their personal freedoms, and stereotype social groups."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;, all of which could result from the violation of the features of the rhetorical model of the public sphere. People or groups may be systematically shut out of the mainstream political discourse, which makes that discourse less democratic, as certain voices are then missing from that discourse&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;. Examples of incivility in political discourse include, but are not limited to, name calling, derisive or disrespectful speech and vulgarity, intentional lies, and misrepresentation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gervais|first=Bryan|date=2015|title=Incivility online: Affective and behavioral reactions to uncivil political posts in a web-based experiment|url=|journal=Journal of Information Technology &amp; Politics|volume=12|pages=167-185|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another type of uncivil behavior is "outrage speech", which includes name calling, insulting, character assassination, mockery, and emotional displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sobieraj|first=Sarah|last2=Berry|first2=Jeffrey M.|date=2011-02-09|title=From Incivility to Outrage: Political Discourse in Blogs, Talk Radio, and Cable News|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10584609.2010.542360|journal=Political Communication|volume=28|issue=1|pages=19–41|doi=10.1080/10584609.2010.542360|issn=1058-4609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The outrage industry: Political opinion media and the new incivility|last=Sobieraj|first=|last2=Berry|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are disagreements among researchers about whether or not emotional speech – using anger, fear, or hatred – should be considered uncivil.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;Some researchers view some emotional speech as civil unless it threatens democracy in some way, while other researchers view emotional speech itself as a disruption to democracy, and push for a purely rational view of civility&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;.  

Stryker et al. assert that "political incivility is usefully distinguished from interpersonal politeness outside of politics." Their research found consensus among survey respondents concerning the types of political speech and behavior that "count" as "political incivility".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Papacharissi echoes this sentiment, stating that "civility should be redefined as a construct that encompasses, but also goes beyond, politeness."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

==Workplace incivility==
{{Main article|Workplace incivility}}
A 2011 report in [[USA Today]] defined Workplace incivility as "a form of organizational deviance... characterized by low-intensity behaviors that violate respectful workplace norms, appearing vague as to intent to harm."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://yourlife.usatoday.com/parenting-family/story/2011/08/Incivility-a-growing-problem-at-work-psychologists-say/49854130/1 | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=2011-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article asserts further that researchers had announced at the annual meeting of the [[American Psychological Association]] that "Workplace incivility is on the rise.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Uncivil behaviors are characteristically rude and [[courtesy|discourteous]], displaying a lack of regard for others."&lt;ref name=Andersson&gt;{{cite journal |first=Lynne M. |last=Andersson |first2=Christine M. |last2=Pearson |date=July 1999 |title=Tit for Tat?

Examples of workplace incivility include insulting comments, denigration of the target's work, spreading false rumors, and social isolation.

* Dr. P.M. Forni, a professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]], co-founded the Johns Hopkins Civility Project in 1997. An aggregation of academic and community outreach activities, the JHCP aimed at assessing the significance of civility, manners and politeness in contemporary society. The JHCP has been reconstituted as The Civility Initiative at Johns Hopkins, which Dr. Forni now directs. This Web site is designed to introduce Dr. Forni's work on civility and to offer links to related material (http://sites.jhu.edu/civility/index.html).
* The Civility Project is a voluntary, grassroots movement of people from diverse backgrounds who agree that, at this critical time in America's history, solutions to our most pressing problems will be found only through a more civil exchange of ideas. A web-based organization, CivilityProject.org hopes to promote more civility in public discourse. Mark DeMoss and long-time Clinton advisor [[Lanny Davis]] launched The Civility Project (http://www.CivilityProject.org) earlier 2009.
* Choose Civility is an ongoing community-wide initiative, led by Howard County Library, to position [[Howard County, Maryland]] as a model of civility. The project intends to enhance respect, empathy, consideration and tolerance in Howard County (http://www.choosecivility.org).
* The National Civility Center is a not-for-profit organization established in 2000 to help people make their communities better places to live. They believe that a comprehensive approach to community improvement—one that engages all local stakeholders around shared ideas and a unified plan for action—can help community members and organizations become more effective at solving tough social issues (http://www.civilitycenter.org).
* The Institute for Civility believes there are two key threats to the effectiveness and efficiency of our governing process today. A nation experiencing both polarization and citizen apathy is a nation at risk. The institute works to reduce polarization in society by focusing on the very public civility (or lack of it!) in the governing process by facilitating dialogue, teaching respect, and building civility (http://www.instituteforcivility.org/  and http://www.civilityblog.org/).
* "The Civility Institute" (http://www.civilityinstitute.com), founded by Dr. Benet Davetian (author of Civility-A Cultural History), conducts research on civility and provides consultations for institutions, schools, corporations. The goal of the institute is to offer beneficiaries with a practical understanding of the social psychology of civility and how civility can be increased without interfering with the mandates of a competitive society.

'''Joseph Ber Soloveitchik''' ({{lang-he-n|יוסף דב הלוי סולובייצ׳יק}} ''Yosef Dov ha-Levi Soloveychik''; February 27, 1903 – April 9, 1993) was a major [[United States|American]] [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[rabbi]], [[Talmud]]ist, and modern [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]]. He was a scion of the [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] [[Brisk yeshivas|Soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty]].

As a ''[[rosh yeshiva]]'' of [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary]] at [[Yeshiva University]] in [[New York City]], '''The Rav''' (variantly spelled '''The Rov'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32429343|title=The Soloveitchik heritage : a daughter's memoir|last=Soloveitchik.|first=Meiselman, Shulamit|date=1995|publisher=KTAV Pub|year=|isbn=0881255254|location=Hoboken, N.J.|pages=front cover; the sister of the Rav called him the Rav.|oclc=32429343}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he came to be known, [[Semicha|ordained]] close to 2,000 rabbis over the course of almost half a century.

He served as an advisor, guide, mentor, and role-model for tens of thousands of Jews, both as a Talmudic scholar and as a religious leader. He is regarded as a seminal figure by [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]].

==Heritage==
Joseph Ber Soloveitchik was born on February 27, 1903, in [[Pruzhany]], then [[Russian Empire|Russia]] (next [[Poland]], now [[Belarus]]). He came from a rabbinical dynasty dating back some 200 years: His paternal grandfather was Rabbi [[Chaim Soloveitchik]], and his great-grandfather and namesake was Rabbi Yosef Dov Soloveitchik, the ''[[Beis HaLevi]]''. His great-great-grandfather was Rabbi [[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin]] (''The Netziv''), and his great-great-great-great grandfather was Rabbi [[Chaim Volozhin]]. His father, Rabbi [[Moshe Soloveichik]] (note different spelling of last name), preceded him as head of the [[Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary|RIETS]] rabbinical school at Yeshiva University.
On his maternal line, Soloveitchik was a grandson of Rabbi [[Eliyahu Feinstein]] and his wife Guta Feinstein, née Davidovitch, who, in turn, was a descendant of a long line of Kapulyan rabbis, and of the [[Tosafot Yom Tov]], the [[Isaiah Horowitz#Works|Shelah]], the [[Maharshal]], and [[Rashi]].

==Early years, education, and immigration==
Soloveitchik was educated in the traditional manner at a [[Talmud Torah]], an elementary [[yeshiva]], and by private tutors, as his parents realized his great mental powers. According to a [[curriculum vitae]] written and signed in his own hand,&lt;ref name="Lehmann 2003"&gt;{{cite web
| last = Lehmann

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1922, he graduated from the liberal arts "Gymnasium" in [[Dubno]]. In 1924, he entered the [[Free Polish University]] in [[Warsaw]], where he spent three terms, studying political science. In 1926, he came to [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], and entered the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich Wilhelm University]]. He passed the examination for supplementary subjects at the German Institute for Studies by Foreigners, and was then given full matriculation at the University. He took up studies in philosophy, economics, and Hebrew subjects, simultaneously maintaining a rigorous schedule of intensive [[Talmud]] study.

According to the CV, among his "highly honored" teachers in university, bearing the title "[[Geheimrat]]" (literally: [[Privy Council|Privy Counselor]]), were Professor Dr. [[:de:Heinrich Maier (Philosoph)|Heinrich Maier]] (1867-1933) and Professor Dr. [[Max Dessoir]], along with Professor Dr. [[Eugen Mittwoch]] and Professor Dr. [http://www.sammlungen.hu-berlin.de/dokumente/14924/ Ludwig Bernhard]. He studied the work of European philosophers, and was a life-long student of neo-[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian thought.

He wrote his Ph.D. thesis on the [[epistemology]] and [[metaphysics]] of the German philosopher [[Hermann Cohen]].
Contrary to most biographies, which erroneously state that in 1931, he received his degree, he actually passed his oral doctor's examination on July 24, 1930, but graduated with a doctorate only on December 19, 1932, as he had requested an extension to allow him to expand his thesis. Documents exist to support this assertion, located by [[Marc B. Shapiro]] in the University of Berlin archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seforim.blogspot.de/2007/11/marc-b-shapiro-responses-to-comments.html|title=Marc B. Shapiro - Responses to Comments and Elaborations on Previous Posts|website=seforim.blogspot.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, he married Tonya Lewit (1904-1967), who had earned a Ph.D. in Education from [[Jena University]]. Rabbi [[Chaim Ozer Grodzinski]] served as his [[mesader kiddushin]] in [[Vilna]].

During his years in Berlin, Soloveitchik became a close disciple of Rabbi [[Hayyim Heller]],&lt;ref name="yu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yu.edu/riets/about/mission-history/historic-roshei/chaim-heller/|title=Yeshiva University - Yeshiva University|website=yu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; who had established an institute for advanced Jewish Studies from an Orthodox perspective in the city. He also made the acquaintance of other young scholars pursuing a similar path to his own. One such figure was Rabbi [[Yitzchok Hutner]], who would become the rosh yeshiva of the [[Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin]], also in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. Both of them developed a system of thought that bridged the [[Eastern Europe]]an way of traditional scholarship with the new forces of [[modernity]] in the [[Western World]]. Among the other personalities with whom he came into contact were Professor [[Alexander Altmann]], Rabbi Dr. [[Yehiel Yaakov Weinberg]], Rector of the [[Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary]], and Professor [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]].

===Boston===
In 1932, Soloveitchik emigrated to America and settled in Boston, where he referred to himself as "The Soloveitchik of Boston". He pioneered the [[Maimonides School]], one of the first [[Hebrew day school]]s in [[Boston]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;An American Orthodox Dreamer: Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik and Boston's Maimonides School, by Seth Farber, University Press of New England, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; When the school's high school was founded in the late 1940s, he instituted a number of innovations in the curriculum, including teaching Talmud to boys and girls studying in classes together. He involved himself in all manner of religious issues in the Boston area. He was at times both a rabbinical supervisor of [[kashrut|kosher]] slaughtering - ''shechita'' - and an educator, gladly accepting invitations to lecture in Jewish and religious philosophy at prestigious [[New England]] colleges and universities. His son-in-law, Rabbi Professor [[Isadore Twersky]], was an internationally renowned expert on the writings of Maimonides, and succeeded Professor [[Harry Austryn Wolfson]] to the Nathan Littauer chair of Jewish History and Literature at [[Harvard University]].

===New York===
Joseph Soloveitchik succeeded his father, Moses (Moshe) Soloveichik, as the head of the RIETS rabbinical school at Yeshiva University in 1941. He taught there until 1986, when illness kept him from continuing, and was considered the top [[Rosh Yeshiva]] (never, however, a formally recognized position at YU) from the time he began teaching there until his death in 1993. He was the first occupant of the [[Leib Merkin]] Distinguished Professorial Chair in Talmud and Jewish Philosophy at RIETS.

He ordained over 2,000 rabbis, many of whom are among the leaders of Orthodox Judaism and the Jewish people today. In addition, he gave public lectures that were attended by thousands from throughout the greater Jewish community, as well as regular classes at other New York institutions.

Rav Soloveitchik advocated more intensive textual [[Torah study]] for Jewish women at the [[Stern College for Women]], giving the first class in Talmud inaugurated at Stern College. With his enlightened outlook, he attracted and inspired many young men and women to become spiritual leaders and educators in Jewish communities worldwide. They, in turn, went out with the education of Yeshiva University to head synagogues, schools, and communities, where they continue to influence many Jews to remain - or become - committed to Orthodoxy and observance. Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]] was highly influenced by his lectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahane|first1=Libby|title=Rabbi Meir Kahane: His Life and Thought Volume One:1932-1975|date=2008|publisher=Urim Publications|location=Israel|isbn=965-524-008-8|page=31|quote=Meir had great love and admiration for Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveitchik of Yeshiva University and went to hear his lectures from time to time, especially his famous memorial lectures.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson===
Rabbis Herschel Schacter, [[Sholem Kowalsky]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article.asp?AID=529444 The Rebbe and the Rav]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article.asp?AID=527750|title=A Relationship from Berlin to New York - 1980|website=Chabad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Berman]]; [[Menachem Genack]]; and [[Fabian Schoenfeld]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article.asp?AID=527752|title=The Rebbe in Berlin, Germany - 1929|website=Chabad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; (all students of Soloveitchik) have asserted that [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson|Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the late [[Lubavitcher Rebbe]] and Soloveitchik met for the first time while they both studied in Berlin. They met many times at the home of [[Hayyim Heller]].&lt;ref name="yu.edu"/&gt; Soloveitchik told Kowalsky he "was a great admirer of the Rebbe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article.asp?AID=529444|title=The Rebbe and the Rav|website=www.chabad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schoenfeld quoted Soloveitchik as having told him that while both he and Schneerson were studying at the University of Berlin, "I can testify that he never missed going to the mikva one single day."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdmxCe2l8Ag|title=The Rav and The Rebbe: Early Years Excerpt|first=|last=JewishMedia|date=16 May 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1964, Soloveitchik paid a lengthy visit while Rabbi Schneerson was mourning the death of his mother. Their conversation during this visit lasted approximately two hours. Soloveitchik later visited again following the death of Rabbi Schneerson's mother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article.htm/aid/529444/jewish/The-Rebbe-and-the-Rav|title=The Rebbe and the Rav|website=www.chabad.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1980, accompanied by his student Herschel Schacter, Soloveitchik visited Schneerson at Chabad headquarters in Brooklyn on the occasion of a celebration marking the 30th anniversary of his leadership. The visit lasted close to two hours after which Soloveitchik told Schacter his opinion of Schneerson: "He is a gaon (genius), he is a great one, he is a leader of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0uF44xLM-k&amp;feature=relmfu|title=Excerpt: The Rebbe and the Rav|first=|last=JewishMedia|date=5 February 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy and major works==
{{Jewish philosophy}}

===''Torah Umadda'' synthesis===
During his tenure at Yeshiva University, in addition to his Talmudic lectures, Soloveitchik deepened the system of "synthesis" whereby the best of religious Torah scholarship would be combined with the best secular scholarship in Western civilization.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} This later became known as the ''[[Torah Umadda]]'' - "Torah and secular wisdom" philosophy- the motto of Yeshiva University. Through public lectures, writings, and his policy decisions for the Modern Orthodox world, he strengthened the intellectual and ideological framework of Modern Orthodoxy.

In his major non-Talmudic publications, which altered the landscape of [[Jewish philosophy]] and [[Jewish theology]], Soloveitchik stresses the normative and intellectual centrality of the [[halakha|halakhic]] corpus. He authored a number of essays and books offering a unique synthesis of Neo-Kantian existentialism and Jewish thought, the most well-known being ''The Lonely Man of Faith'' which deals with issues such as the willingness to stand alone in the face of monumental challenges, and ''Halakhic Man''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_3_51/ai_97722706#continue Findarticles.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206143001/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_3_51/ai_97722706 |date=2008-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstthings.com/ftissues/ft0006/reviews/carmy.html|title=Issues Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A less known essay, though not less important, is "The Halakhic Mind - An essay on Jewish tradition and modern thought",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soloveitchik |first=Joseph B. |title=The halakhic mind: An essay on Jewish tradition and modern thought |publisher=Seth Press &lt;!--distributed by Free Press--&gt; |isbn=978-0-684-86372-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; written in 1944 and published only 40 years later, without any change, as the author himself stresses.

===''The Lonely Man of Faith''===
[[File:Soloveitchikbooks.jpg|thumb|right|200px|4 books of Joseph B. Soloveitchik]]
In ''[[The Lonely Man of Faith]]'', Soloveitchik reads the first two chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] as a contrast in the nature of the human being and identifies two human types: Adam I, or "majestic man", who employs his creative faculties in order to master his environment; and Adam II, or "covenantal man", who surrenders himself in submission to his Master. Soloveitchik describes how the man of faith integrates both of these aspects.

In the first chapter, '''Adam I''' is created together with Eve, and they are given the mandate to subdue nature, master the cosmos, and transform the world "into a domain for their power and sovereignty". Adam I is ''majestic man'' who approaches the world and relationships—even with the divine—in functional, pragmatic terms. Adam I, created in the image of God, fulfills this apparently "secular" mandate by conquering the universe, imposing his knowledge, technology, and cultural institutions upon the world. The human community depicted in Genesis 1 is a utilitarian one, where man and woman join together, like the male and female of other animals, to further the ends of their species.

In chapter two of Genesis, '''Adam II''', on the other hand represents the lonely man of faith - bringing a "redemptive interpretation to the meaning of existence". Adam II does not subdue the garden, but rather tills it and preserves it. This type of human being is introduced by the words, "It is not good for man to be alone" - and through his sacrifice (of a metaphoric rib), he gains companionship and the relief of his existential loneliness - this covenantal community requires the participation of the Divine.

===''Halakhic Man''===
In ''Halakhic Man'', Soloveitchik propounds the centrality of halakha in [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish thought]]. His theological outlook is distinguished by a consistent focus on halakha, i. e., the fulfillment and study of the divine law. He presents the halakha as the ''a priori'' basis for religious practice and for the theological foundation for Jewish thought. Soloveitchik emphasizes halakha's "this-worldly, here-and-now grounding", as opposed to religious approaches that focus on the nature of the transcendent realm. This work argues that Jewish piety does not, therefore, fit familiar models of Western [[religiosity]], and presents a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] of this religious type. Here, "Halakhic man", as a result of his [[Torah study|study of Torah]] and his observance of the [[mitzvah|commandments]], develops a set of coherent attitudes towards [[intellectual|intellectual activity]], [[ascetic]]ism, death, [[esotericism]], [[mysticism]], creativity, [[repentance]], and [[Divine providence#Modern Orthodox Judaism|providence]]. He also underscores the necessity for individual self-creation as the divinely assigned task of the human being.

''Halakhic Man'' has become well read in the Orthodox Jewish community, but its psychology and model of Jewish law was rejected by most of non-Orthodox Judaism; one of the most prominent critiques is from Rabbi [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], who wrote: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Ish Ha-halakhah? Lo haya velo nivra ela mashal haya!'' [Halakhic Man? Such a Jew has never existed!] Soloveitchik's study, though brilliant, is based on the false notion that Judaism is a cold, logical affair with no room for piety. After all, the Torah does say 'Love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and soul and might'. No, there never was such a typology in Judaism as the halakhic man. There was - and is - an Ish Torah ''[Torah man]'' who combines halakhah and aggadah, but that is another matter altogether. When I came to Berlin I was shocked to hear my fellow students talking about the problem of halakha as a central issue. In Poland it had been a foreign expression to me. Halakhah is not an all-inclusive term, and to use it as such is to restrict Judaism. 'Torah' is the more comprehensive word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Abraham Joshua | last = Heschel | title = Heschel, Hasidism and Halakha | editor-first = Samuel H | editor-last = Dresner | page = 102 | author-link = Abraham Joshua Heschel | publisher = [[Fordham University Press]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Halakhic Mind''===
''Halakhic Mind'' is a four-part analysis of the historical correlation between science and philosophy. Only in its fourth and last part does the author introduce the consequences on the Halakha of the analysis performed in the previous three parts.

==Other views and controversy==
Soloveitchik became a "lightning rod" of criticism from two directions. From the religious left, he was viewed as being too connected to the [[Old World]] of [[Europe]], while for those on the religious right, he was seen as legitimizing those wanting to lower their religious standards in the attempt to [[modernize]] and [[Americanize]]. Despite this criticism, Soloveitchik remained steadfast in his beliefs and positions throughout the years of his leadership. His highly original use in all of the foregoing works of categories and concepts drawn from existentialism and other schools of secular modern philosophy is analyzed in some depth in the writings of Fr. Christiam M. Rutishauser, S.J.

===Departure from the traditional Brisker view of Zionism===
Soloveitchik was proud of his connections to the Soloveitchik rabbinic dynasty, speaking fondly of his "uncle" Rabbi [[Yitzchak Zev Soloveitchik]] (the "Brisker Rov"). To his relatives and namesakes who now lived in [[Jerusalem]], where they had established their own branch of the [[Brisk yeshivas|Brisk Yeshiva]], he was respected for his genius in Talmudic scholarship which few could challenge or disparage, despite their very differing views on [[Zionism]] (the "Briskers" in Jerusalem being staunch anti-Zionists). See the paragraph on "Zionism" below for a discussion of Soloveitchik's Zionist viewpoint.
Recent research published by Shlomo Pick indicates that his father, Rabbi [[Moshe Soloveitchik]], maintained a close relationship with [[Religious Zionist]] ([[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]]) circles in [[Warsaw]], prior to the father's departure for [[Yeshiva University]] and the son's departure for the [[University of Berlin]] in 1923.

===Impact on Modern Orthodoxy===
Modern Orthodox Jews consider Rabbi Soloveitchik to be the paradigmatic Modern Orthodox Jew, based on Soloveitchik's focus on secular studies and world culture, and his Zionism (see paragraph on Soloveitchik's Zionism below). However, some of Soloveitchik's opinions on these issues are vague, and Soloveitchik's students have taken many different stances on these matters. In any case, most Modern Orthodox institutions today, including [[Yeshiva University]], have connections to Rabbi Soloveitchik.

===Relations with Agudath Israel===
After Soloveitchik left Agudath Israel, the organization's leadership was mostly quiet when it came to public statements involving Soloveitchik. Rabbi [[Moshe Feinstein]], who was Soloveitchik's cousin, maintained very warm and profoundly respectful relations with him. They corresponded and spoke (at least) on the eve of every Jewish holiday. Rabbi [[Yitzchok Hutner]] referred to him as a "[[gadol]]" (a foremost Torah scholar of the time).&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.yucommentator.com/media/storage/paper652/news/2005/05/16/Yudaica/Looking.Before.And.After-951249.shtml Looking Before and After - YUdaica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007085030/http://media.www.yucommentator.com/media/storage/paper652/news/2005/05/16/Yudaica/Looking.Before.And.After-951249.shtml |date=2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Aaron Kotler]], whose public policy in relation to American Jewry was far more right-wing than Soloveitchik's, was introduced by Soloveitchik at a Chinuch Atzmai dinner,&lt;ref&gt;"Memorable Encounters" by [[Joseph Kaminetsky]]&lt;/ref&gt; and this later became famous as an instance of unity among the Orthodox leadership. Agudath Israel's mouthpiece, the "Jewish Observer", also mentioned Soloveitchik as one of the greatest rabbis of the generation when detailing a cable which was sent by various gedolim to former Israeli Prime Minister [[Levi Eshkol]] requesting the government to put a stop to Christian missionary activity in Israel. In May 1993, Rabbi Nisson Wolpin penned an obituary for Soloveitchik in the ''Jewish Observer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6347/1075/1600/rybs_jo.jpg|title=Photos&amp;.blogger.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article was criticized for being a mere page long as instead of the ''Jewish Observer's'' usually comparatively long obituaries, for the obituary not being mentioned in the table of contents, and portraying Soloveitchik as not clarifying his views enough. Rabbi [[Moshe David Tendler]], a son-in-law of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, wrote a scathing attack on Wolpin's piece, which was published both in The Community Synagogue of Monsey's newsletter and the ''[[Algemeiner Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://masliah.googlepages.com/RYBSJO.bmp|title=Rabbi Tendler's "Open Letter to the Moetzes of Agudas Yisrael"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soloveitchik did not sign Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's proposed ban on interfaith dialogue. Instead, he published a path-breaking essay expounding his views on the subject, entitled "Confrontation". He also did not sign the ban by America's foremost rabbis against participating in the Synagogue Council of America. It has been debated whether his refusal to sign was because he believed in participating in the SCA, or because he was not happy with the way the ban was instituted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/research/cjl/meta-elements/texts/center/conferences/soloveitchik/Cunningham_23Nov03.htm Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik on Interreligious Dialogue ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119154056/http://www.bc.edu/research/cjl/meta-elements/texts/center/conferences/soloveitchik/Cunningham_23Nov03.htm |date=2008-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Agudah's comparative silence on Soloveitchik and his stances, the ''Jewish Observer'' has often criticized the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] in which he served and his more modern students, including Rabbi [[Norman Lamm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israelvisit.co.il/top/ll8.shtml|title=Let's Learn -- Vol. I, No. 8|website=israelvisit.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbi [[Shlomo Riskin]]&lt;ref&gt;"Approaching the Avos—Through Up-Reach or Drag-Down", March 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; and Rabbi Dr. Lawrence Kaplan.&lt;ref&gt;"Two Letters and a Response" by Lawrence Kaplan and the Novominsker Rebbe.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Soloveitchik's students became leaders in the [[Modern Orthodox]] community. These students tend to espouse very distinct world views.

One of the most [[iconoclastic]] is Rabbi Prof. [[David Hartman (rabbi)|David Hartman]] of Jerusalem, whose support for [[Religious pluralism|pluralism]] has gained him serious backing in non-Orthodox streams and who has brought Soloveitchik's thinking to the non-Orthodox. The institution he founded, the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]], is a home for serious thinkers from Orthodoxy, Conservative/Masorti, Reform and even secular scholars, and trains hundreds of Jewish community leaders annually. Rabbis [[Avi Weiss]] and [[Saul Berman]], who represent liberal Modern Orthodox institutions such as [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]] and [[Edah]], are somewhat further to the right of [[Irving Greenberg]], Shlomo Riskin and Hartman,{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} but still very liberal in comparison to most Orthodox thinkers (Rabbi Weiss has classified this approach as "[[Open Orthodoxy]]").

Many students of Soloveitchik represent a centrist approach to Modern Orthodoxy (which Lamm has coined "[[Centrist Orthodoxy]]") such as Rabbis [[Aharon Lichtenstein]], [[Benjamin Blech]], [[Lawrence Kaplan]], and Lamm. The ''Torah UMadda Journal'', ''Tradition'' magazine, the [[Rabbinical Council of America]], [[Efrat]], [[Yeshiva University]], [[Bnei Akiva]], the [[Orthodox Union]], and various post-high school yeshivot and seminaries in Israel (i.e. Yeshivat Hakotel and [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]]) are largely, if not mostly (but almost never monolithically) populated by "Centrist Orthodox" Jews.

Further to the right in the spectrum of Orthodoxy lie Rabbis Yehuda Parnes and Abba Bronspiegel, both of whom resigned from teaching positions in Yeshiva University to join right-wing alternative [[Lander College]]. A few of Soloveitchik students identify themselves and Soloveitchik's teachings with the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] world, such as Rabbi [[Moshe Meiselman]], Soloveitchik's nephew and [[Rosh Yeshiva]] of [[Yeshiva Toras Moshe]] in [[Jerusalem]]; Rabbi [[Mosheh Twersky]], one of Soloveitchik's grandchildren and a teacher at Toras Moshe; Rabbi Michel Shurkin, also a teacher at Toras Moshe; and Rabbi Chaim Ilson, Rosh Yeshiva of Yeshivas Derech Hatalmud in Jerusalem.

====Integration with secular society====
Since his death, interpretations of Soloveitchik's beliefs have become a matter of ongoing debate, somewhat analogous to the long-standing debate about [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]]. Some [[Haredi Judaism|Haredim]] and some on the right wing of [[Modern Orthodoxy]] believe that Hirsch only wanted Jews to combine an observant Jewish lifestyle with learning the surrounding gentile society's language, history, and science, so that a religious Jew could operate in the surrounding secular society. However, this is not a universally held opinion among right-wing Orthodox Jews (see, for example, the writings of Rabbi [[Shimon Schwab]] and the biography of Rabbi Hirsch by Rabbi Eliyahu Klugman). Similarly, some scholars of Soloveitchik's philosophy maintain that an eclectic pragmatic approach was adopted by Soloveitchik as well. According to this view, Soloveitchik did not approve of Jews learning secular philosophy, music, art, literature or ethics, unless it was for purposes of obtaining a livelihood or outreach.

In contrast, liberal leaning scholars believe that this understanding of Soloveitchik's philosophy is misguided. This issue has been discussed in many articles in ''Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Thought'', published by the [[Rabbinical Council of America]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} According to this view, Soloveitchik believed that it was permissible for Jews to learn secular philosophy, music, art, literature and ethics for their own sake and encouraged this.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

Professor Yitzchak Twersky, a son-in-law of The Rav, pointed out in a eulogy published in the journal ''[[Tradition]]'' in 1996 that Soloveitchik's philosophy could be paraphrased as follows: "When you know your [Jewish] Way—your point of departure and goals—then use philosophy, science and the humanities to illumine your exposition, sharpen your categories, probe the profundities and subtleties of the masorah and reveal its charm and majesty; in so doing you should be able to command respect from the alienated and communicate with some who might otherwise be hostile or indifferent to your teaching as well as to increase the sensitivity and spirituality of the committed."

====Own criticism of his students====
Soloveitchik stated that although he felt that he successfully transmitted the facts and laws of Judaism to his students, he felt that he failed in transmitting the experience of living an authentic Jewish life. He stated that many of his students "act like children, and experience religion like children. This is why they accept all types of fanaticism and superstition. Sometimes, they are even ready to do things that border on the immoral. They lack the experiential component of religion, and simply substitute obscurantism for it ... After all, I come from the ghetto. Yet, I have never seen so much naïve and uncritical commitment to people and to ideas as I see in America ... All extremism, fanaticism, and obscurantism come from a lack of security. A person who is secure cannot be an extremist." (''A Reader's Companion to Ish Ha-Halakhah: Introductory Section'', David Shatz, Yeshiva University, Joseph B. Soloveitchik Institute).

====Revisionism====
Shortly after Soloveitchik's passing, Lamm, in a eulogy for Soloveitchik delivered on April 25, 1993, urged his auditors to "guard ... against any revisionism, any attempts to misinterpret the Rav's work in both worlds [the world of Torah and the world of Madda(Science)]. The Rav was not a lamdan who happened to have and use a smattering of general culture, and he was certainly not a philosopher who happened to be a talmid hakham, a Torah scholar ... We must accept him on his terms, as a highly complicated, profound, and broad-minded personality ... Certain burgeoning revisionisms may well attempt to disguise and distort the Rav's uniqueness by trivializing one or the other aspect of his rich personality and work, but they must be confronted at once." (Lawrence Kaplan ''Revisionism and the Rav: The Struggle for the Soul of Modern Orthodoxy'', Judaism, Summer, 1999).

===Relations with non-Orthodox Judaism===
Soloveitchik was a life-long critic of all forms of non-Orthodox Judaism, including [[Reform Judaism]] and [[Conservative Judaism]]. He believed that these denominations were in significant error where they differed from Orthodox Judaism. He compared religious dialogue with Reform and Conservative leaders to dialogue between [[Pharisees]] and [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]], considering it ridiculous. One of the major differences was in regard to the mixed seating in the synagogue. Consistent with the traditional rabbinic understanding of this issue, Soloveitchik ruled that it was forbidden to pray in a synagogue without a separation between the sexes (mi-d'orayta, a Pentateuchal prohibition), and without the use of a [[mechitza]], a divider between the men's and women's sections (mi-derabbenan, a rabbinical prohibition).&lt;ref&gt;Susan Grossman, Rivka Haut, ''Daughters of the King: Women and the Synagogue A Survey of History, Halakhah, and Contemporary Realities'', p. 132 note 8&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of this was to prohibit prayer in any Reform synagogue and in many Conservative synagogues. His [[responsa|responsum]] on this question was also directed at the small number of Orthodox synagogues that were adopting mixed-sex seating. He was vociferous on this issue.
Soloveitchik believed that Reform and Conservative rabbis did not have proper training in halakha and Jewish theology, and that due to their decisions and actions, they could not be considered rabbis, as Orthodox Jews traditionally understood the term. However, in practice, he sometimes granted non-Orthodox rabbis some degree of validity with respect to communal affairs (see examples below).

Soloveitchik developed the idea that Jews have historically been linked together by two distinct covenants. One is the ''brit yi'ud'', "covenant of destiny", which is the covenant by which Jews are bound together through their adherence to halakha. The second is the ''brit goral'', "covenant of fate", the desire and willingness to be part of a people chosen by God to live a sacred mission in the world, and the fact that all those who live in this covenant share the same fate of persecution and oppression, even if they do not live by halakha. Soloveitchik held that non-Orthodox Jews were in violation of the covenant of destiny, yet they are still bound together with Orthodox Jews in the covenant of fate.

In 1954 Soloveitchik issued a responsum on working with non-Orthodox Jews, ''Orthodox, Conservative and Reform Jews in the United States: Second article in a series on Responsa of Orthodox Judaism in the United States''. The responsum recognized the leadership of non-Orthodox Jews in Jewish communal institutions (but not their rabbis in the Orthodox sense of the term), and concluded that participation with non-Orthodox Jews for political or welfare purposes is not only permissible, but obligatory.

The ''Council of Torah Sages'' of Agudath Yisroel countered with a ruling that such cooperation with non-Orthodox Jews was equivalent to endorsement of non-Orthodox Judaism, and thus was forbidden. In 1956 many [[Yeshiva]] leaders, including two rabbis from his own [[Yeshiva University]], signed and issued a proclamation forbidding any rabbinical alumni of their yeshivot from joining with Reform or Conservative rabbis in professional organizations.

Soloveitchik declined to sign the proclamation, maintaining that there were areas, particularly those relating to problems that threatened all of [[Judaism]], that required co-operation regardless of affiliation. His refusal emboldened other Modern Orthodox rabbis, and the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] and Union of Orthodox Congregations then joined the [[Synagogue Council of America]], a group in which Orthodox, Reform and Conservative denominations worked together on common issues. (The Synagogue Council of America ceased operating in 1994.)

In the 1950s Soloveitchik and other members of the [[Rabbinical Council of America]] engaged in a series of private negotiations with the leaders of Conservative Judaism's [[Rabbinical Assembly]], especially with Rabbi [[Saul Lieberman]]; their objective was to found a joint Orthodox-Conservative [[beth din]] that would be a national rabbinic court for all Jews in America; it would supervise communal standards of marriage and divorce. It was to be modeled after the Israeli [[Chief Rabbinate]], with only Orthodox judges, but with the expectation that it would be accepted by the larger Conservative movement as legitimate. Conservative rabbis in the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] formed a ''Joint Conference on Jewish Law'' and devoted a year to the effort.

For a number of reasons, the project did not succeed. According to Orthodox Rabbi Bernstein, the major reason for its failure was that the Orthodox rabbis insisted that the Conservative Rabbinical Assembly expel some Conservative rabbis for actions they took before the new Beit Din was formed, and the RA refused to do so (Bernstein, 1977). According to Orthodox Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, former president of the RCA, the major reason for its failure was pressure from right-wing Orthodox rabbis, who held that any cooperation between Orthodoxy and Conservatism was forbidden. In an account prepared in 1956, Rabbi [[Harry Halpern]] of the Rabbinical Assembly's ''Joint Conference'' wrote that negotiations between the Orthodox and Conservative were completed and agreed upon, but then a new requirement was demanded by the RCA: that the RA "impose severe sanctions" upon Conservative rabbis for actions they took before the new beth din was formed. The RA "could not assent to rigorously disciplining our members at the behest of an outside group". Per Halpern, subsequent efforts were made to cooperate with the Orthodox, but a letter from eleven [[Rosh Yeshiva]]s was circulated declaring that Orthodox rabbis were forbidden to cooperate with Conservative rabbis (''Proceedings of the CJLS of the Conservative Movement 1927-1970'' Vol. II, pp.&amp;nbsp;850–852).

Until the 1950s, Jews of all denominations were generally allowed to use the same communal [[mikvah|mikvaot]] (ritual baths) for the purposes of converting to Judaism, observing the rules of [[niddah]] in regard to laws of marital purity, ritually cleansing dishes, etc. However the Ultra-Orthodox movement increasingly denied the use of mikvaot to non-Orthodox rabbis for use in conversions. According to Rabbi [[Walter Wurzburger]], Rav Soloveitchik counselled Orthodox rabbis against this practice, insisting that non-Orthodox have the option to use mikvaot (Wurzburger, 1994).

===Zionism===
Soloveitchik was the pre-eminent leader of politically conscious pro-Zionist modern Orthodox Judaism. Out of respect for his stature, many leaders and politicians from [[Israel]] sought his advice and blessings in state affairs. Reputedly, he was offered the position of [[Chief rabbi#Chief Rabbis of The Land of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Israel]] by Prime Minister Ben Gurion, but quietly declined. Despite his open and ardent support for the modern [[Israel|State of Israel]], he only visited Israel - then called [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] - once, in 1935, before the state was established. Rabbi [[Yosef Blau]] has written that Soloveitchik's non-messianic Zionism was philosophically similar to that of Rabbi [[Yitzchak Yaacov Reines]] (see ''Tradition'' 33.2, Communications).

On Yom ha-Atzma'ut (Israel's Independence Day), 1956, Soloveitchik delivered a public address at Yeshiva University entitled: Kol Dodi Dofek; The Voice of My Beloved Knocks. The address, which has become a classic of religious Zionist philosophy, enumerates, and elaborates upon, the instances of God's tangible presence in the recent history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. It also issues a clarion call to American Orthodoxy to embrace the State of Israel, and to commit itself and its resources to its development.

===Affiliated organizations===
In his early career in America, Soloveitchik joined with the traditional movements such as [[Agudath Israel of America]] and the ''Agudat Harabanim'' - the [[Union of Orthodox Rabbis]] of North America. In fact, Soloveitchik was on the first Moetzes Chachmei HaTorah of America.&lt;ref&gt;''Hapardes'', September 1941, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he later removed himself from the former organizations, and instead joined with the ''Mizrachi'' [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionists]] of America (RZA) and became Chairman of the centrist [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] [[Rabbinical Council of America]]'s (RCA) Halakhah Commission (the other two members are the time were Rabbis [[Hayyim Heller]] and [[Samuel Belkin]]).

During the 1950s and 1960s, until his wife's death in 1967, Soloveitchik and some of his students would spend summers near [[Cape Cod]] in [[Onset, Massachusetts]], where they would pray at [[Congregation Beth Israel (Onset, Massachusetts)|Congregation Beth Israel]].&lt;ref name=Resnick&gt;Resnick, Elliot. [http://www.jewishpress.com/displayContent_new.cfm? contentid=33340&amp;mode=a&amp;sectionid=17&amp;contentname=Beaches%2C_Cottages_..._And_Shul_Draw_Vacationers_To_Onset%2C_Massachusetts&amp;recnum=12&amp;subid=20740 "Beaches, Cottages ... And Shul Draw Vacationers to Onset, Massachusetts"], ''[[The Jewish Press]]'', June 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the passing of his wife in 1967, Soloveitchik began giving additional lectures, open to the public, during the summer months in Boston.

Soloveitchik's daughters married prominent academics and Talmudic scholars: his daughter Tovah married the late Rabbi Dr. [[Aharon Lichtenstein]], former [[Rosh Yeshiva]] of [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]] in Israel (who had a PhD in English Literature from [[Harvard University]]); his daughter Atarah married the late Rabbi Dr. [[Isadore Twersky]], former head of the Jewish Studies department at [[Harvard University]] (who also served as the [[Talner]] [[Rebbe]] in [[Boston]]). His son Rabbi Dr. [[Haym Soloveitchik]] is a University Professor of Jewish History at [[Yeshiva University]]. His siblings included Dr. [[Samuel Soloveichik]] (1909-1967), Rabbi [[Ahron Soloveichik]] (1917-2001), Mrs. [[Shulamith Meiselman]] (1912-2009), and Mrs. [[Anne Gerber]] (1915-2011). His grandchildren have maintained his heritage and also hold distinguished scholarly positions.

As he got older he suffered several bouts of serious illness ([[Alzheimer's Disease]]&lt;ref&gt;See: "Of Language And Nuance. A Conversation with the Renowned Posek and Rosh Yeshivah Rav Hershel Schachter, Shlita". Mishpacha, Issue 288, 29 Kislev 5770/December 16, 2009, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; preceded by [[Parkinson's Disease]]).

{{PaliCanonSamanaViews}}
'''Makkhali Gosala''' ([[Pāli]]; [[Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit|BHS]]: Maskarin Gośāla; [[Jain]] [[Prakrit]] sources: Gosala Mankhaliputta) or '''Manthaliputra Goshalak''' was an [[shramana|ascetic]] teacher of ancient India. He was a contemporary of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of [[Buddhism]], and of [[Mahavira]], the last and 24th [[Tirthankara]] of [[Jainism]].

== Sources ==
Details about Gosala's life are sparse. All of the available information about Gosala and about the [[Ājīvika]] movement generally comes from Buddhist and Jain sources. As Gosala's teachings appear to have been rivals of those of the Buddhist and Jain leaders of his day, this information is regarded by most scholars as being overtly influenced and coloured by sectarian hostilities.

Two primary sources describe Gosala's life and teaching: the Jain [[Bhagavati Sutra]], and [[Buddhaghosa]]'s commentary on the Buddhist Sammannaphala Sutta.&lt;ref name="Basham"&gt;{{cite book |last=Basham |first=A.L. |authorlink=A.L. Basham |title=History and Doctrines of the Ājīvikas |year=2002 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers |location=Delhi, India |isbn=81-208-1204-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} The Bhagavati Sutra goes into detail about the career of Makkhali Gosala and his relationship with Mahavira; the Sammannaphala Sutra itself mentions Makkhali in passing as one of six leading teachers of philosophy of the Buddha's day, and Buddhaghosa's commentary provides additional details about his life and teaching.

== Early life ==
According to the ''Bhagavati Sutra'', Gosala was in the village of Saravana, a name meaning 'thicket of reeds'.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|37}} His mother's name is given as 'Bhadda', a name used in many Jaina sources to refer to the unknown mother of some mythological figure, while his father's name is given as Mankhali.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|35–36}} Gosala's father was said to be employed as a ''mankha'', a somewhat obscure class of mendicant or ascetic that seems to have been occupied with carrying an image of a god or goddess, and with singing religious songs.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|35}}

The name 'Gosala' literally means 'cow shed', and both the Bhagavati Sutra and Buddhaghosa claim that Gosala was so named because he was born in a cow shed, his parents being unable to find more suitable lodgings in the village of Saravana.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|36}} The Bhagavati Sutra reports that Gosala went on to follow his father's profession, becoming a ''mankha''. Meanwhile, Buddhaghosa claims that Gosala was born into slavery, and became a naked ascetic after fleeing from his irate master, who managed to grab hold of Gosala's garment and disrobe him as he fled.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|37}} While it is possible that the broad outlines of Gosala's birth story or early life are correct—that he was born into poverty in a cowshed—it may be equally likely that these versions of his early life were concocted by Buddhist and Jain partisans to bring a rival teacher into disrepute.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|38}}

The philosopher's true name seems to have been Maskarin, the Jaina Prakrit form of which is Mankhali and the Pāli form Makkhali. "Maskarin" is explained by Pāninī (VI.i.154) as "one who carries a bamboo staff" (maskara). A Maskarin is also known as Ekadandin. According to Patañjali (Mahābhāsya iii.96), the name indicates a School of Wanderers who were called Maskarins, not so much because they carried a bamboo staff as because they taught "Don't perform actions, don't perform actions, quietism (alone) is desirable to you". The Maskarins were thus fatalists or determinists.{{sfn|Barua|1920|p=12}}

==Makkhali Gosala and Mahavira==
The Bhagavati Sutra states that Gosala became Mahavira's disciple three years after the start of Mahavira's asceticism, and travelled with him for the next six years.{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=29}}&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|40}} A commentary to the Jain Avasyaka Sutra provides details of these six years of association, many of them reflecting poorly on Gosala- another likely indication of sectarian bias.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|41–45}} Several incidents in the narrative show Mahavira making predictions that then come true, despite Gosala's repeated attempts to foil them. These incidents were likely included in the narrative to provide motivation for Gosala's later belief in the inevitability of fate.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|40}} Some of these incidents may in fact have been adapted from Ajivika sources but recast by Jaina chroniclers.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|46}}

Another possible adaptation of an Ajivika story is found in Mahavira's explanation of the end of the association between himself and Gosala, recorded in the Bhagavati Sutra.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|48–49}} On coming to a plant by the roadside, Gosala asked Mahavira what the fate of the plant and its seeds would be. Mahavira stated that the plant would grow to fruition, and the seed pods would grow into new plants. Determined to foil his master's prediction, Gosala returned to the plant at night and uprooted it. Later, a sudden rain shower caused the plant to revive and re-root itself. Upon approaching the plant again later, Gosala claimed to Mahavira that he would find his prophecy to have been foiled. Instead, it was found that the plant and its seeds had developed exactly as predicted by Mahavira. Gosala was so impressed by the reanimation of the plant that he became convinced that all living things were capable of such reanimation. The terms used in the story of the Bhagavati Sutra for reanimation mimic a technical term for reanimation of the dead that is also found elsewhere in Ajivika doctrine.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|48–49}} Mahavira disagreed with this thesis, and this seems to have been the cause of the separation of the two ascetics. Mahavira is, however, later depicted as having rescued Gosala from an attack by an enraged renunciant using magical powers acquired through the practice of austerities; this is claimed to motivate Gosala's pursuit of the same sort of magical powers.&lt;ref name="Basham"/&gt;{{rp|49–50}}

==Death==
[[A. L. Basham]] dates the death of Gosala in 484 BC on the basis of ''[[Mahavamsa]]''.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=75}}

==In literature==
Gosala appears briefly as a "cameo" character in the 1981 [[Gore Vidal]] novel ''[[Creation (novel)|Creation]]'', a fictional account of the [[Persian Wars]] of the 5th century BC, told from the perspective of a widely travelled Persian diplomat, Cyrus Spitama, who is depicted as the grandson of [[Zoroaster]] and boyhood friend of [[Xerxes I]]. In early adulthood, thanks to his facility with languages, Cyrus is appointed by King [[Darius I]] as the Persian ambassador to the kingdoms of India. While travelling across the Subcontinent, Cyrus stops at the city of [[Mathura]], where he is accosted by the Jain sage, who lectures Cyrus about his views on the inevitability of fate, and his disagreements with Mahavira.&lt;ref&gt;Gore Vidal, ''Creation: A Novel'' (Random House, 1981), pp.189-192&lt;/ref&gt;

'Khanti Kikatia' is a novel focused on the life of Makkhali Gosala. Hindi novelist Ashwini Kumar Pankaj wrote this and it is in the Magahi language. In this novel, the author presented the life and philosophy of the Makkhali in a very authentic and live manner.&lt;ref&gt;Ashwini Kumar Pankaj, [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=CIlVDwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Khanti Kikatia]: A Novel based on life and thought of Makkhali Goasala'' (Pyara Kerketta Foundation, 2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3177">'''May Brodbeck''' (July 26, 1917 – August 1, 1983)&lt;ref name=jwa /&gt;&lt;ref name=thoemmes /&gt; was an American [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]].

==Biography==

Brodbeck was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]]. She studied chemistry at [[New York University]], attending evening courses while working, and earned a bachelor's degree in 1941. Thereafter, she worked as a high-school chemistry teacher, before being recruited into the [[Manhattan Project]]. Following the war, she studied philosophy at the [[University of Iowa]], completing a Ph.D. supervised by [[Gustav Bergmann]] in 1947, on the subject of [[John Dewey]]'s ''[[Logic: The Theory of Inquiry]]''.&lt;ref name=jwa /&gt;&lt;ref name=thoemmes /&gt;

Upon finishing her PhD, she was offered a professorship at the [[University of Minnesota]], where she worked from 1947 to 1974, eventually rising to chair of the philosophy department (1967–1970) and dean of the graduate school (1972–1974). She then returned to the University of Iowa as Carver Professor of Philosophy and Dean of the Faculties. In the administrative part of her role at the University of Iowa, among other initiatives she focused in particular on the status of women in the university, and oversaw the creation of one of the first [[women's studies]] programs. She stepped down from administration in 1981, retired in 1983, and died later that year in [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;ref name=jwa /&gt;&lt;ref name=thoemmes /&gt;

==Work==

Brodbeck's career focused on a number of issues in the philosophy of science, in particular aiming to include the [[social sciences]] within its remit. She edited two widely read anthologies on the subject: ''Readings in the Philosophy of Science'' (1953, co-edited with [[Herbert Feigl]]), and ''Readings in the Philosophy of the Social Sciences'' (1968). Later in her career, she also wrote on the [[philosophy of mind]], defending a form of [[psychophysical parallelism]].&lt;ref name=jwa /&gt;&lt;ref name=thoemmes /&gt;

== Biography ==
Cartwright earned her BSc from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in mathematics and her Ph.D. in philosophy at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago|University of Illinois at Chicago Circle]]. Her thesis was on the concept of mixture in quantum mechanics. Before taking her current appointments, she taught at the [[University of Maryland]], [[Stanford University]] and the [[London School of Economics]]. She has held visiting appointments at the [[University of Oslo]], [[Princeton University]], [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], the [[University of Cambridge]] and [[UCLA]]. She is currently Tsing Hua Honorary Distinguished Chair Professor at the [[National Tsing Hua University]] in Taiwan and Visiting Research Fellow at [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice|Ca' Foscari]] University in Venice. She co-founded the [[Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science]] (CPNSS) at the [[London School of Economics|LSE]] and the [[Centre for Humanities Engaging Science and Society]] (CHESS) at the [[University of Durham]].

Cartwright has mentored several students in England and the United States who have gone on to become professional philosophers of science, including [[Naomi Oreskes]], Carl Hoefer, [[Mauricio Suarez]], Andrew Hamilton, Julian Reiss, [[Roman Frigg]], Gabriele Contessa, Anna Alexandrova, Leah McClimans, [[Jacob Stegenga]], [[Jeremy Howick]], Marta Halina, Joyce Havstad, Sindhuja Bhakthavatsalam, [[Peter Menzies (philosopher)|Peter Menzies]], Martin Thomson-Jones, Matt Brown, [[Hasok Chang]], Jordi Cat, Sophia Efstathiou, Sang Wook Yi, Towfic Shomar and Szu-Ting Chen.  She was also a supervisor of [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSE insider claims Gaddafi donation was openly joked about;|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/lse-insider-claims-gaddafi-donation-was-lsquoopenly-joked-aboutrsquo-2240488.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=26 June 2018|date=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cartwright was married to the philosopher [[Stuart Hampshire]] until his death in 2004. She was also previously married to [[Ian Hacking]]. She has two daughters, Emily and Sophie Hampshire Cartwright, and a granddaughter, Lucy Charlton.

== Main contributions ==

Cartwright's approach to the [[philosophy of science]] is associated with the "[[Stanford School]]" of [[Patrick Suppes]], [[John Dupré]], [[Peter Galison]] and [[Ian Hacking]]. It is characterized by an emphasis on scientific practice as opposed to abstract scientific theories. Cartwright has made important contributions to debates on laws of nature, causation and causal inference, scientific models in the natural and social sciences, objectivity and the unity of science. Her recent work focuses on evidence and its use in informing policy decisions.

Carl Hoefer describes Cartwright's philosophy in the following terms:&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Stephann, Hoefer, Carl and Luc Bovens (eds.) - Nancy Cartwright's Philosophy of Science. London: Routledge. 2008. p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nancy Cartwright’s philosophy of science is, in her view, a form of empiricism but empiricism in the style of Neurath and Mill, rather than of Hume or Carnap. Her concerns are not with the problems of skepticism, induction, or demarcation; she is concerned with how actual science achieves the successes it does, and what sort of metaphysical and epistemological presuppositions are needed to understand that success.

Cartwright, like many working scientists themselves, takes a rather pragmatic/realist stance toward observations and interventions made by scientists and engineers and particularly toward their connections to causality: Scientists see impurities causing signal loss in a cable, and they stimulate an inverted population, causing it to lase. Given these starting points, there can be no question of a skeptical attitude toward causation, in either singular or generic form. The fundamental role (or better, roles) played by causation in scientific practice is undeniable; what Cartwright does, then, is reconfigure empiricism from the ground up based on this insight. In the reconfiguration process, many mainstays of the received view of science take a beating; especially [...] the fundamentality of laws of nature.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Honors and awards ==

Cartwright served as the president of the [[Philosophy of Science Association]] (2009–10)&lt;ref name=philsci-gov /&gt; and as vice-president (2007–8) and president (2008–9) of the Pacific Division of the [[American Philosophical Association]].&lt;ref name = apa-gov /&gt; She is Professor Emeritus at the [[London School of Economics]]. She is also Fellow of the [[British Academy]] and member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]]. She has received honorary degrees from [[Southern Methodist University]] and the [[University of St Andrews]] as well as a [[MacArthur Fellowship]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/philosophy/NancyCV.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Cartwright was elected a [[Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences]] (FAcSS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eighty-four leading social scientists conferred as Fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences|url=https://www.acss.org.uk/news/eighty-four-leading-social-scientists-conferred-fellows-academy-social-sciences/|website=Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=5 August 2017|date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]] and [[second scholasticism]], '''objective precision''' (Latin ''praecisio obiectiva'') is the "objective" aspect of [[abstraction]]. Objective precision is the process by which certain features (the [[differentia]]e) of the real object of a [[formal concept]] are excluded from the comprehension of that concept; the object is thus being intentionally transformed into a universal [[objective concept]]. Objective precision is thus a process by which universal objective concepts arise. It is the "objective" aspect of the process of (total) [[abstraction]] or concept-formation.

== Objective precision and formal precision ==
Objective precision is distinguished against [[formal precision]]. Whereas objective precision is a process on the part of objective ''concepts'' (the objective correlates of the mental acts by means of which something is being conceived) formal precision is the corresponding process on the part of formal concepts or the mental ''acts'' themselves. Objective and formal precision are the two aspects (objective and subjective) of abstraction.

== Nominalism and realism ==
The two opposing philosophical views on universals, [[nominalism]] (or rather [[conceptualism]]) and [[philosophical realism|realism]] can be defined by means of their relation to objective precision: anyone who accepts objective precision, is a philosophical realist; anyone who rejects it, is a conceptualist or nominalist (in a broad sense). In other words, the nominalists reject the idea that our universal mental concepts (formal concepts) require universal intentional objects; thus, according to nominalists, in abstraction only formal precision takes place, no objective precision.

== Ontological requirements on the part of the object ==
The schools are divided in their opinion what constitutes the necessary condition on the part of the object in order that objective precision be possible. According to the [[Thomism|Thomists]] a [[virtual distinction]] on the part of the object between the excluded differentia and the arising abstracted objective concept is sufficient to make objective precision possible. According to the [[Scotism|Scotists]], a [[formal distinction]] is generally required, although certain Scotists (like [[Bartolomeo Mastri]]) regard virtual distinction as sufficient in certain special cases. [[Francisco Suárez|Suárez]] defends objective precision but he rejects any distinctions on the part of the object. The nominalists (conceptualists) agree with the Scotists that a formal distinction would be necessary to enable objective precision, but since they regard such a distinction as impossible, they reject objective precision altogether.

'''Operation Cauldron''' was a series of secret [[biological warfare]] trials undertaken by the British government in 1952.  Scientists from [[Porton Down]] and the [[Royal Navy]] were involved in releasing [[biological agent]]s, including [[pneumonic plague|pneumonic]] and [[bubonic plague]], [[brucellosis]] and [[tularaemia]] and testing the effects of the agents on caged monkeys and guinea pigs.&lt;ref name=DC&gt;{{cite book| title=Deadly Cultures: Biological Weapons since 1945| first=Mark| last=Wheelis |author2=Lajos Rózsa |author3=Malcolm Dando| publisher=Harvard University Press| year=2006| pages=56–7|isbn=0-674-01699-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=P8&amp;xml=/health/2005/09/20/nplag19.xml| title=Trawler steamed into germ warfare site and no one said a word| publisher=Daily Telegraph| date=2005-09-20 | location=London | first=Ben | last=Fenton | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The tests==

The experiments were carried out at sea, off the coast of the [[Isle of Lewis]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]], aboard a floating pontoon, supported by the ship ''Ben Lomond''.  The test animals were placed in cages on the deck of the pontoon and biological agents dispersed either from a bomb suspended from a boom or by being sprayed.  After being exposed, the animals were taken aboard the ''Ben Lomond'' and those that died were dissected to determine the cause of death.  3,492 guinea pigs and 83 monkeys were used in the tests.&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;

The tests were initially judged to be a success, both in terms of the effectiveness of the biological agents and the test platform.  However, a year later, this decision was reversed, with the tests on plague bacteria being described as a "failure" and the statement that "brucellosis has not increased its reputation as a dangerous agent."&lt;ref name=DC/&gt;

==Carella incident==
In the final test of the series, the [[Fleetwood]]-based [[Commercial trawler|trawler]] ''Carella'', with a crew of eighteen, ignored warnings to steer clear and unwittingly sailed through a cloud of plague bacteria (''[[Yersinia pestis]]'') on its return from a fishing trip to the waters around [[Iceland]], causing concern about a possible plague outbreak around its home port in north-west England.  The ''Carella'' was not stopped for disinfection or medical examination but was kept under covert observation by a [[destroyer]] and a fisheries vessel for twenty-one days, and the ship's radio communications were monitored for any kind of medical distress call.  The surveillance period included a period of shore-leave at [[Blackpool]], during which the crew mixed with the people of the town as usual.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;  None of the crew became ill.

The incident was dealt with at the highest levels of government, going through the [[First Sea Lord]] to the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Rab Butler]], who was deputising for the absent [[Winston Churchill]].  The event was successfully covered up and, after the danger had passed, most of the documents relevant to the case were ordered to be burnt.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;
Even the crew of the ''Carella'' were unaware of the incident until approached by a BBC documentary crew&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Matt Fletcher (researcher), Jolyon Jenkins (presenter and producer)| date=2005 | title=Operation Cauldron | medium=Documentary | location=Bristol  | publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; more than fifty years later.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

==Ministerial intervention==
In 1994, the local [[Member of Parliament]], [[Calum MacDonald (politician)|Calum Macdonald]] called upon&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1994/feb/09/chemical-weapons#S6CV0237P0_19940209_CWA_744 Hansard, House of Commons, 9 February 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1994/mar/04/operations-cauldron-and-hesperus#S6CV0238P0_19940304_CWA_467 Hansard, House of Commons, 4 March 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1994/mar/04/operations-cauldron-and-hesperus#S6CV0238P0_19940304_CWA_462 on Defence Secretary Hansard, House of Commons, 4 March 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt; the then-[[Secretary of State for Defence]], [[Malcolm Rifkind]], to commission an independent report on Operations Cauldron and Hesperus in 1952 and 1953, and all similar chemical weapons tests ''about which the public reasonably seek reassurance.'' An initial Commons question by him to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry Of Defence]] was referred to the director-general of the [[List of Royal Air Force &amp; Defence Units &amp; Establishments|Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment]] at [[Porton Down]], [[Wiltshire]].

In his letter, Dr Pearson said: ''The papers on Operations Cauldron and Hesperus are classified, and it would not be in the natioinal interest to make these available as the information therein could be misused by states seeking to acquire a biological weapons capability.

''The pathogens used were as follows: (a) Operation Cauldron: the pathogens that cause brucellosis and plague. (b) Operation Hesperus: the pathogens that cause brucellosis and tularaemia.'' Dr Pearson added: ''The safety aspects of handling, transport and
packaging were all carefully addressed to ensure there was no danger to any of those engaged in the trial.

''There is no cause to believe that there was any hazard to the public or the environment and there is no evidence to the contrary.

Mr MacDonald responded at the time saying: ''This reply is deeply unsatisfactory and does not provide any of the reassurances which I and my constituents seek about the tests.''

He continued to outline his belief that it was not satisfactory that the same Government organisation which carried out ''potentially highly dangerous experiments'' should be allowed to pass the final judgment on itself regarding the health implications both then and subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/aberdeen/plague-virus-inquiry-urged-over-minch-tests-1.718369&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ruling against the MOD==

On the 21st of January 2008 the [[Information Commissioner's Office]] ruled against the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MOD]] to release a video they made on Operation Cauldron.
The video contains images of identifiable individuals, and the MOD argued that it would need to obscure or mask the faces of the individuals, as this information would be exempt under sections 38, 40(2) and 44 of the Act. The MOD estimated that the process of masking would exceed the cost limit as set out in section 12 of the Act, and therefore refused the complainant’s request. The Commissioner found that the footage did contain images of identifiable individuals, some of whom may still be alive, but that disclosure of the footage would not breach any of the data protection principles. For this reason the Commissioner found that the MOD wrongly applied the exemption under sections 38, 40(2) and 44, and the cost limit under section 12. The Commissioner therefore directed the MOD to disclose the footage in full.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ico.gov.uk/~/media/documents/decisionnotices/2008/FS_50099223.ashx |title=Freedom of Information Act 2000 (Section 50) -- Decision Notice |date=21 January 2008 &lt;!-- Ref # FS50099223 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video released was about 47 minutes long and showed the pontoon which was situated off the coast of the Tolsta District on the North East of the Isle of Lewis.  The exact location was between Cellar head and Tolsta head.  Many of the Tolsta villagers can remember the ship and seeing white gas clouds in the testing.  The video shows a flight coming in and describes the arrival of the biological agents from the Microbiological Research Department (MRD) at [[Porton Down]]. On the pontoon they placed the animals in small boxes and released the agents, before returning after to check the results and burning the dead animals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPA_yce0Swg Operation CAULDRON 1952 (video)]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8141">Oswell Eve, sometimes referred to as Oswald. (c. 1715 – 1793, New Providence Island, [[The Bahamas]]) was a mariner, [[ship chandler]], [[gunpowder]] manufacturer and member of the [[American Philosophical Society]], in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He attended the [[The Academy and College of Philadelphia|College of Philadelphia]] and was an associate of Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]], later signer of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref&gt;''Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society''. pp. 471-474, 1997 by Whitfield Jenks Bell, {{ISBN|0-87169-226-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Eve was born, circa 1715, possibly in [[Bermondsey (parish)|Bermondsey]], [[Surrey]], England.
Eve was a sea captain, and owned and commanded the [[brigantine]] ''Roebuck'' and the ship ''George''. At the same time, he was a shipping merchant, becoming so prosperous that he part-owned some twenty-five other vessels as well. In 1756, he served as a lieutenant in Samuel Mifflin's company of Philadelphia [[Associators]].

== Birth of the [[Frankford Powder-Mill]] ==
{{main|Frankford Powder-Mill}}
In 1774, Eve built a water-powered factory for producing gunpowder on [[Frankford Creek]] in [[Frankford, Philadelphia|Frankford]], which was then a village outside Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=Lakwete&gt;Angela Lakwete, ''Inventing the Cotton Gin: Machine and Myth in Antebellum America'', JHU Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8018-7394-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]], Eve's powder mill at Wingohocking Street and Adams Avenue, was the only one in operation in the colonies.

[[Silas Deane]] writes in July 24. 1775&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Yours of the 6th I received Yesterday, and wish it were possible to obtain the Article of Powder, but it is more scarce, &amp; more sought after than Gold.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters of Delegates to Congress: Volume 1 AUGUST 1774 - AUGUST 1775'', Silas Deane to Zebulon Butler, located in the Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the fall of 1775 it became very difficult to get sufficient powder for the Continental army. The Massachusetts Provincial Congress sent [[Paul Revere]] to Philadelphia to study the inner workings of Eve's mill.&lt;ref&gt;Park Pressey, "Paul Revere: Goldsmith", p. 145, ''A Vocational Reader'', Rand McNally &amp; Co., Chicago New York, 1916&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his arrival, he met with Continental Congressmen [[Robert Morris (financier)|Robert Morris]] and [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]] who provided the following letter of introduction to present to Oswald Eve:

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Sir&lt;br&gt;
Philada. Novr. 21st 1775

I am requested by some Honorable Members of the Congress to recommend the bearer hereof Mr. Paul Revere to you. He is just arrived from New England where it is discovered they can manufacture a good deal of Salt Petre in Consequence of which they desire to Erect a Powder Mill &amp; Mr. Revere has been pitched upon to gain instruction &amp; Knowledge in this branch. A Powder Mill in New England cannot in the least degree affect your Manufacture nor be of any disadvantage to you.  Therefore these Gentn &amp; myself hope You will Chearfully &amp; from Public Spirited Motives give Mr. Revere such information as will inable him to Conduct the business on his return home. I shall be glad of any opportunity to approve myself.

Sir&lt;br&gt;
Your very Obed Servt.&lt;br&gt;
Robt Morris

P.S. Mr. Revere will desire to see the Construction of your Mill &amp; I hope you will gratify him in that point.

Sir, I heartily join with Mr. Morris in his Request; and am with great Respect, Your very hble Servt. John Dickinson''&lt;ref&gt;Letters of Delegates to Congress: Volume 2 September 1775 - December 1775 --Robert Morris and John Dickinson to Oswell Eve, located in the Library of Congress&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On January 11, 1776, Eve signed a contract with Committee of Secrecy of the [[Continental Congress]] to supply gunpowder at $8 per hundredweight, with Congress supplying the [[niter]]. Because Eve had complied with the request of Congress and allowed Revere to pass through his powder manufactory, thus allowing him to obtain sufficient information that enabled him to set up a powder mill at [[Canton, Massachusetts|Canton]], Eve petitioned Congress for a reward:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Committee of Safety, Philadelphia, May 3, 1776.

SIR: This Committee having considered the petition of Mr. Oswell Eve, are of opinion it should be laid before the honourable Congress; and they take the liberty of sending it to you for that purpose; at the same time, they certify that Mr. Eve has at different times, upon the recommendation of this Board, shown his works and improvements to such gentlemen as were appointed from this and the neighbouring Colonies to view the same.

I am, sir, your most obedient, humble servant,

[[John Nixon (financier)|JOHN NIXON]], Chairman.

To the Honourable [[John Hancock]], Esq.&lt;ref&gt;Petition of Oswell Eve, 22 March 1776, Papers of the Continental Congress, No. 42, II, f. 378 (microfilm, M247, reel 53, National Archives), As per footnotes in ''Patriot-Improvers: Biographical Sketches of Members of the American Philosophical Society'' By Whitfield Jenks Bell&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mill Legacy===
The Powder-Mill on Frankford Creek became the working model that was studied by all the other colonies for building their own mills in the production of gunpowder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalsocietyoffrankford.org/history.html Historical Society of Frankford]&lt;/ref&gt; When the British occupied Philadelphia in September 1777, they took over the mill, and it was rumored that Eve cooperated.&lt;ref name=Lakwete /&gt; On March 6, 1778, the [[Supreme Executive Council of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania|Supreme Executive Council]] found Eve found guilty of treason for trading with the [[Great Britain|British]], but he was allowed to leave the city when the British evacuated in Spring 1778, leaving his son Oswell Jr. in charge of the mill.&lt;ref name=Lakwete /&gt; However, on July 6, 1778, all his property, including the powder mills and {{convert|202|acre|km2}}, were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northeasttimes.com/2006/0316/frankford.html "Fond of Frankford"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621201132/http://www.northeasttimes.com/2006/0316/frankford.html |date=2009-06-21 }}, by Diane Villano, ''The Northeast Times'', March 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.workshopoftheworld.com/frankford/frankford.html Barbara M. Auwarter and Joyce Halley, ''Workshop of the World''], Oliver Evans Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of the Revolution, Eve fled with his wife to [[Nassau, Bahamas]], where he died in his son Joseph's house in [[New Providence]] in 1793.&lt;ref name=Sarah&gt;"Extracts from the Journal of Miss Sarah Eve" (1759-1774) of Frankford, Pennsylvania, in ''Pennsylvania Mag. Hist. Biog.'', V, 1881, pp. 19-36 and 191-205&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Eve was married to Anne Moore in [[Christ Church, Philadelphia]] on June 2, 1744. The couple had thirteen children, of whom seven died in infancy.&lt;ref name=Sarah/&gt;

One daughter, Sarah Eve, was an intimate friend of the family of Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]], with whom she was eventually engaged to be married. However, In September 1774, she came down with a lingering illness, believed to have been [[tuberculosis]], and died just three weeks before their wedding was to take place on Christmas of that year.&lt;ref name=Sarah/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Salons Colonial and Republican'', by Anne Hollingsworth Wharton, 2004, Kessinger Publishing, {{ISBN|1-4179-0621-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faris, John T. ''The Romance of Old Philadelphia'', p. 225, J. B. Lippincott Co., 1918&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Eve's sons, Joseph, came under the tutelage of Dr. Rush and became a medical doctor.

'''Punctuality''' is the characteristic of being able to complete a required task or fulfill an obligation before or at a previously designated time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/punctual |title=Punctual - Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Punctual" is often used [[synonym]]ously with "on time". 
It is also acceptable that punctual can also, be related to talking about grammar, means "to be accurate".{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

An opposite personality trait is [[tardiness (vice)|tardiness]].

According to each culture, there is often an understanding about what is considered an acceptable degree of punctuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/dec/11/travel/tr-insider11 |title=Punctuality: Some cultures are wound tighter than others - Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=1994-12-30 |accessdate=2014-02-01 |first=Jane |last=Engle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, a small amount of lateness is acceptable; this is commonly about ten or fifteen minutes in Western cultures, but this is not the case in such instances as doctor's appointments or school lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/germans-and-punctuality/a-16430264 |title=Germans and punctuality &amp;#124; All about those Germans &amp;#124; DW.DE &amp;#124; 09.12.2012 |publisher=DW.DE |date= |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, such as [[Japanese society]], and settings, such as military ones, expectations may be much stricter.{{cn|date=August 2017}}

Some cultures have an unspoken understanding that actual deadlines are different from stated deadlines, for example with [[Africa time]]. For example, it may be understood in a particular culture that people will turn up an hour later than advertised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=White |first=Lawrence T. |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/culture-conscious/201202/is-punctuality-standard-oxymoron |title=Is "Punctuality Standard" an Oxymoron? |publisher=Psychology Today |date=2012-02-23 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, since everyone understands that a 9 pm party will actually start at around 10 pm, no-one is inconvenienced when everyone arrives at 10 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3211923.stm |title=Africa &amp;#124; Can Africa keep time? |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-10-28 |accessdate=2014-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultures which value punctuality, being late is seen as disrespectful of others' time and may be considered insulting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/788640.shtml |title=Time for Africa to abandon tardy culture to avoid punctuality problems - OP-ED |publisher=Globaltimes.cn |date=2013-06-13 |accessdate=2014-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141113154030/http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/788640.shtml |archivedate=2014-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, punctuality may be enforced by social penalties, for example by excluding low-status latecomers from meetings entirely. Such considerations can lead on to considering the value of punctuality in [[econometrics]] and to considering the effects of non-punctuality on others in [[queueing theory]].

'''Radovan Richta''' (June 6, 1924 – July 21, 1983) was a Czech [[philosopher]] who coined the term [[technological evolution]]; a theory about how societies diminish physical labour by increasing mental labour.{{#tag:ref|Ondryáš, Karel [http://www.sds.cz/docs/prectete/epubl/kon_arr.htm "Akademik Radovan Richta"], Marathon 4/1999, in Czech, accessed November 14, 2010. (Note: The Czech word "Akademik" in this context means specifically a member of the [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]].)|name="Ondryas1999"}} Richta was born in [[Prague]].&lt;ref name="Ondryas1999"/&gt;

Richta's first work was ''Člověk a technika v revoluci našich dnů'' ("Man and Technology in the Revolution of Our Day"), published in 1963. This work did much to bring the concept of technology into the forefront of philosophical thought during the 1960s. Richta then went on to publish ''Civilizace na rozcestí'' ("Civilization at the Crossroads") in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Richta, Radovan "Civilizace na rozcestí" ("Civilization at the Crossroads"), Svoboda, Praha 1966, in Czech&lt;/ref&gt; "Crossroads" was a compilation work published by 60 authors (including and led by Richta) that "attempt[ed] to analyze the social and human implications of the scientific and technological revolution".&lt;ref&gt;"Civilization at the Crossroads", Third expanded edition. Trans. Marian Slingova, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts touched on in "Crossroads" are considered by some philosophical historians to be very ground-breaking for their time.

Richta developed the famous term of "[[Socialism with a human face]]" serving as a motto of the [[Prague Spring]] period. He became the director of the Institute for Philosophy and Sociology of the [[Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences]] (''ČSAV - Československá akademie věd'') in 1969 - 1982,.&lt;ref&gt;coll.

== Life ==
During [[World War II]], Richta organized a resistance movement against the [[Nazis]], and his organization became part of the communist resistance in the critical moment of the worst persecution (or man-hunting). Richta was arrested and held prisoner for several months. He was saved by the Swiss Red Cross when they collected prisoners with the worst cases of [[tuberculosis]] and extracted them to Switzerland. Shortly after the rescue Ritcha's former fellow prisoners were executed on May 2, 1945.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The translation is vague - the author could have meant the prisoners were killed without sentence.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MarathonRevolutionaries"&gt;Jan Smíšek.

After the war Richta became quite ill, and beginning in 1958 he periodically spent time in sanatoria.&lt;ref name="MarathonRevolutionaries"/&gt; In between bouts of sickness, and in a compromise with his doctors who prescribed complete bed rest, Richta studied and worked very hard.

In the 1960s Richta took on the role of the leader of an interdisciplinary research team. In 1963 they released their first works - ''Člověk a technika v revoluci našich dnů'' ("Man and technology in the revolution of our days") and ''Komunismus a proměny lidského života'' (K povaze humanismu naší doby) ("Communism and changes of human life. To the nature of humanism of our time").&lt;ref name="MarathonRevolutionaries"/&gt;

'''Raphael Debono''' (19th century) was a Maltese minor [[philosopher]]. In philosophy he mostly specialised in [[logic]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. I, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; No portrait of him is known to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Not to be confused with another Raphael Debono, who was an 18th-century cleric, author of the tract ''Brevis Tractatus De Ordine'' (1723).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Almost nothing is known about the personal life of Debono. He was probably one of the thousands of Maltese emigrants in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], around the end of the 19th century.

==Extant work==
[[File:Raphael Debono - Analisi Logica.jpg|thumb|''Di una Teorica di Analisi Logica'' (1884) of Raphael Debono]]

Just one composition of Debono survives as yet. It is a pamphlet in Italian published in Cairo in 1884 (Typo Lithographe Franco-Egyptienne J. Serrière) under the title '''''Di una Teorica di Analisi Logica''''' (An Investigation of Analytical Logic).&lt;ref&gt;Montebello, ''Op. cit.'', pp. 304-305.&lt;/ref&gt;  The work is an interesting disputation on technical points of some aspects of [[symbolic logic]], also called [[mathematical logic]]. The tone used is friendly. If the disputation ever took place (it might be supposed), it was between two friends in the professional spirit of academic collaboration and amity. Perhaps this is an inherent message which Debono also wanted to get through to his readers. Nevertheless, Debono mentions a certain S. Frendo as his interlocutor, who might have been a language professor at the Italian public schools of Cairo.

After an introduction, the work is divided into three parts, amongst which the first is the most substantial and important. The first part bears the name ''Pro Veritate'' (For Truth). Debono refutes certain positions of analytic logic held by his colleague. Debono seems to imply that the positions were exposed in an earlier publication by Frendo.

The other two parts of the work successively refer to a letter which Debono had written (perhaps in some newspaper), and to Frendo’s publication. Few other details are provided to get at the bottom of the story. Nevertheless, the style and argumentation of the work is intriguing. It is clear that Debono is of an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] frame of mind.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8498">{{for|referring expressions in Chomskyan linguistics|R-expression}}
{{no footnotes|date=June 2015}}
In [[linguistics]], a '''referring expression''' ('''RE''') is any [[noun phrase]], or surrogate for a noun phrase, whose function in discourse is to identify some individual object. The [[technical terminology]] for ''identify'' differs a great deal from one school of linguistics to another. The most widespread term is probably ''refer'', and a thing identified is a ''referent'', as for example in the work of [[John Lyons (linguist)|John Lyons]]. In linguistics, the study of reference relations belongs to [[pragmatics]], the study of language use, though it is also a matter of great interest to philosophers, especially those wishing to understand the nature of [[knowledge]], [[perception]] and [[cognition]] more generally.

Various devices can be used for reference including [[determiner]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[proper name]]s. Reference relations can be of different kinds; referents can be in a "real" or imaginary world, or in discourse itself, and they may be singular, plural, or collective.

== Kinds ==
{{multiple issues|section=y|{{unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}{{original research|section|date=June 2015}}}}
The kinds of expressions which can refer are:

# a noun phrase of any structure, such as: ''the taxi'' in ''The taxi's waiting outside''; ''the apple on the table'' in ''Bring me the apple on the table''; and ''those five boys'' in ''Those five boys were off school last week''. In those languages which, like English, encode [[definiteness]], REs are typically marked for definiteness. In the examples given, this is done by the definite article ''the'' or the demonstrative adjective, here ''those''.
# a noun-phrase surrogate, i.e. a pronoun, such as ''it'' in ''It's waiting outside'' and ''Bring me it''; and ''they'' in ''They were off school last week.'' The referent of such a pronoun may vary according to context - e.g. the referent of ''me'' depends on who the speaker is - and this property is technically an instance of [[deixis]].
# a [[proper name]], like ''Sarah'', ''London'', ''The Eiffel Tower'', or ''The Beatles''. The intimate link between proper names and type (1) REs are shown by the definite article that appears in many of them. In many languages this happens far more consistently than in English. Proper names are often taken to refer, in principle, to the same referent independently of the context in which the name is used and in all possible worlds, i.e. they are in [[Saul Kripke]]'s terminology rigid designators.

Referring can take place in a number of ways. Typically, in the case of (1), the RE is likely to succeed in picking out the referent because the words in the expression and the way they are combined together give a true, accurate, description of the referent, in such a way that the hearer of the expression can recognize the speaker's intention. In the first example, if the hearer knows what an apple and a table are, and understands the relation expressed by ''on'', and is aware that ''the'' is a signal that an individual thing or person is intended, they can build up the meaning of the expression from the words and grammar and use it to identify an intended object (often within sight, or at any rate easily recoverable, but not necessarily).

The speaker may use a mistaken description and still manage to refer successfully. If the speaker asks the hearer to "Take this plate to the woman with the glass of vodka", the hearer may take it to the intended person even if, unbeknownst to the speaker, the vodka is really water. On the other hand, the speaker may be accurate in calling it vodka, but the hearer may believe wrongly that it is water, and therefore not deliver the plate. Accurate reference is then not a guarantee of successful reference, and successful reference does not wholly depend on accurate reference. There is, however, a strong positive correlation between them.

Proper names, on the other hand, generally achieve reference irrespective of the meaning of the words which constitute them (if any are recognizable). If a local pub is called ''The Anchor'', this is simply a label which functions conversationally with no appeal to the meaning of the words. If someone says, ''I'm going to the Anchor'', they do not mean ''I'm going to the device for halting and securing a ship'', and the hearer will not necessarily call such a device to mind when I say this. ''The Anchor'' just serves to identify a particular building. This point is more obvious still with those names like ''Sarah'' and ''London'' which have no lexical meaning of their own.

== Kinds of reference relations ==

In addition to the singular and plural reference (in many languages grammatically obvious), linguists typically distinguish individual or specific reference, exemplified by each case presented so far, from generic reference, where a singular expression picks out a type of object rather than an individual one, as in '''''The bear''' is a dangerous animal''. Plural expressions can, of course, be interpreted in the same way, as in '''''Bears''' are dangerous animals''.

Definite reference to single individuals is usually taken to be the prototypical type of reference.

Other types of reference recognized by linguists include ''indefinite'' as opposed to ''definite reference'', and ''collective'' and ''distributive reference''. Definite referring expressions refer to an identifiable individual or class (''The Dalai Lama''; ''The Coldstream Guards''; ''the student with the highest marks''), whilst indefinite referring expressions allow latitude in identifying the referent (''a corrupt Member of Parliament''; ''a cat with black ears''—where ''a'' is to be interpreted as 'any' or 'some actual but unspecified'). Collective reference is the picking out of the members of a set as a set, whilst distributive reference is the picking out of the members of a set individually. The difference may not be marked linguistically, but arrived at by interpretation in context. Compare ''Manchester United won again today'' (where the reference of ''Manchester United'' is to members of the team as a unit), with ''Manchester United wear red shirts and black shorts'' (where the reference of ''Manchester United'' is to the team members as individuals). English allows such expressions to be ambiguous: compare ''Manchester United are rich beyond my wildest dreams.''

== Reference and denotation ==

Denotation is the relation existing between a lexical item and a set of potential referents in some world. Reference is the relation between some expression and actual referents (subject to the technical restriction given above). The word ''rabbit'' denotes the entire class of objects that are classified with this term, whilst the RE ''my rabbit'' will generally refer, on a particular occasion of usage, to the one individual in my possession. Generally speaking, lexical items have denotation, whilst phrases have the job of doing reference in real situations. This distinction is not systematically made by some linguists.

===Some technical linguistic characteristics===

REs carry a presupposition of the existence of the referent(s), in some universe of discourse, including fictional universes.

There are many other technical issues surrounding the nature of reference. Some of these are discussed from the perspective of linguistics in Lyons (1977, vol. I: chapter 7); Cann (1993: chapters 9 and 10); Saeed (1997: chapters 2, 7, 11). There is a vast literature on the topic in philosophy.

== Referring expressions generation ==
[[Referring expression generation]] (REG) is the subtask of [[natural language generation]] (NLG) that receives most scholarly attention.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} While NLG is concerned with the conversion of non-linguistic information into natural language, REG focuses only on the creation of '''referring expressions''' (noun phrases) that identify specific entities called ''targets'' by describing their attributes that are most distinct from those of the ''distractors''.

'''''Rules of Civility &amp; Decent Behaviour In Company and Conversation'''''&lt;ref&gt;Washington, George. Rules of Civility &amp; Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation: a Book of Etiquette. Williamsburg, VA: Beaver Press, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; is the name of a list best known as a school writing exercise of [[George Washington]], who became the first [[President of the United States|president]] of the [[United States of America]].  Most of the rules have been traced to a [[France|French]] [[etiquette]] manual written by [[Jesuits]] in 1595 entitled "Bienséance de la conversation entre les hommes". As a handwriting exercise in around 1744, Washington merely copied word-for-word Francis Hawkins' translation which was published in England in about 1640.&lt;ref&gt;see [http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/documents/the-rules-of-civility/ Charles Moore, "Washington's Copy of Rules of Civility &amp; Decent Behaviour In Company and Conversation"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The list of rules opens with:

#Every Action done in Company, ought to be with Some Sign of Respect, to those that are Present.
#When in Company, put not your Hands to any Part of the Body, not usualy{{sic}} Discovered.
#Shew Nothing to your Freind that may affright him.
#In the Presence of Others Sing not to yourself with a humming Noise, nor Drum with your Fingers or Feet.
#If You Cough, Sneeze, Sigh, or Yawn, do it not Loud but Privately; and Speak not in your Yawning, but put Your handkercheif or Hand before your face and turn aside.

The exercise goes on to list a total of 110 such rules.

The list features in the plot of the [[Amor Towles]] novel ''Rules of Civility'', which is named after it.

'''Rumor control centers''' (RCC) and [[rumor control]] mechanisms, identify, investigate and mitigate potentially disruptive rumors, capable of driving a cycle of harmful escalation. Rumor control centers, which often operate [[call centre|call centers]], respond to crisis situations such as [[terrorism|terrorist attacks]], [[natural disasters]], or [[civil disorder|civil disturbances]].

The well-developed crisis control centers established during the [[Cold War]] were among the earlier examples of effective rumor control mechanisms.&lt;ref name="BI_Burgess_Maise_2004"/&gt; In the United States, during the [[civil rights movement]], rumor control centers were set up and operated with the assistance of the [[Community Relations Service]] (CRS),&lt;ref name="CRM_1999_Salinas_interview"/&gt; a "peacemaker" agency created by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title X|Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Rumor control centers have been established in the United States at different levels of governance, including municipal, regional, state-wide and national. Permanent rumor control centers serve a specific, local population, and have often been set up in response to specific incidents.

[[Social media]] makes it easier for rumors to spread, and more difficult for [[rumor control]] and [[fake news]] to be managed. By 2018, "rumor cascades" were under investigation as stories with serious inaccuracies were spread by millions of people."&lt;ref name="Science_2018_Vosoughi_rumor_cascades"/&gt; 

==Overview==
According to a 2004 article by [[Heidi Burgess]] and [[Michelle Maiese]], rumors—"knowledge gaps" with "serious inaccuracies" or "misinformation—can drive the cycle of destructive escalation" and contribute to making situations more disruptive.&lt;ref name="BI_Burgess_Maise_2004"/&gt; These rumors can be spread "through the mass media—television, radio, newspapers, and the Internet."&lt;ref name="BI_Burgess_Maise_2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.beyondintractability.org/essay/rumor_control |series=Rumor Control |title=Why is Rumor Control Important?|first1=Heidi |last1=Burgess |first2=Michelle |last2=Maiese |date=August 2004 |publisher=[[Beyond Intractability Knowledge Base Project]] |access-date=October 21, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First, Brugess and Maisse list three phases of a rumor control process. The first step requires a mechanism through which trusted, trained "rumor agents"—usually those experienced and active in conflict resolution—identify the most recent rumors in circulation.&lt;ref name="BI_Burgess_Maise_2004"/&gt; The second step requires a strategy for establishing the truth and/or falsehood of the rumors. These "rumor investigators" may also be rumor reporters. Thirdly, there is a need for mechanisms whereby the inaccurate reports can be replaced with reliable information.&lt;ref name="BI_Burgess_Maise_2004"/&gt;

The [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]-based Nieman Lab&lt;ref name="niemanlab_Owen_2018"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/03/fear-surprise-and-disgust-why-fake-news-spreads-faster-than-real-news-on-twitter/ |title=Fear, surprise, disgust: Fake news spreads faster than some real news on Twitter |first=Laura |last=Hazard Owen |date=March 9, 2018 |access-date=October 21, 2018 |publisher=Nieman Lab, [[Nieman Foundation]] |location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; cited a ''[[Science]]'' report by [[MIT]] researchers that by March 2018, "fake news both reached more people than the truth and spread faster than the truth."&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Owen noted that "truth" and real news included stories that "had been fact-checked by outlets like [[Snopes]] and [[PolitiFact]]".&lt;/ref&gt; The MIT researchers based their conclusions on "126,000 "[[rumor cascades]]" spread by about 3 million people".&lt;ref name="Science_2018_Vosoughi_rumor_cascades"&gt;{{cite report |journal=Science |first1=Soroush |last1=Vosoughi |first2=Deb |last2=Roy |first3=Sinan |last3=Aral |title=The spread of true and false news online |date=March 9, 2018 |volume=359 |number=6380 |pages=1146-1151 |doi=10.1126/science.aap9559}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1146}}

Since 2007, [[Facebook]] has made attempts to combat rumor cascades by partnering with independent, third-party [[Fact checking|fact-checkers]] to identify inaccurate news stories, and to flag them with warning labels to caution users before sharing them.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/15/media/facebook-fake-news-warning-labels-germany/index.html|title=Facebook to begin warning users of fake news before German election|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=January 15, 2017|publisher=[[CNNMoney]] |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/12/clamping-down-on-viral-fake-news-facebook-partners-with-sites-like-snopes-and-adds-new-user-reporting/|title=Clamping down on viral fake news, Facebook partners with sites like Snopes and adds new user reporting |publisher=[[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]] |accessdate=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Chowdhry|first1=Amit|title=Facebook Launches A New Tool That Combats Fake News|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2017/03/05/facebook-fake-news-tool/#7ec1beea7ec1|publisher=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;For example, the Coral Springs Police Facebook page has a warning entitled "Rumor Control" in which they provide a statement contextualizing an October 18, 2018 incident at the Coral Square Mall involving a 14-year-old girl.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural disasters==
FEMA created the Hurricane Florence Rumor Control and the Hurricane Michael Rumor Control centers in response to the rumors surrounding [[Hurricane Florence]] and [[Hurricane Michael]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fema.gov/florence-rumors# Hurricane Florence Rumor Control]10/19/2018&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical context===
====Cold War====
Brugess and Maisse described the [[Cold War]] crisis control centers as the "best-developed examples of rumor control mechanisms." They were "confidence-building measures aimed to prevent incomplete information about the actions of opposing military forces from escalating into a violent and dangerous confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union".&lt;ref name="BI_Burgess_Maise_2004"/&gt; In his 1983 publication, ''Beyond the Hotline: Crisis Control to Prevent Nuclear War'', [[William L. Ury]] described how a [[crisis control system]] was created during the [[Cold War]], "jointly staffed by U.S. and Soviet military and diplomatic officers."&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs_1985_Pierre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ury_1983_Hotline"&gt;{{cite book |first=William L. |last=Ury |orig-year=1983 |title=Beyond the Hotline: Crisis Control to Prevent Nuclear War. U.S. Arms Control &amp; Disarmament Agency from the Nuclear Negotiation Project |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1985 |pages=187 |isbn=0140088636}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BI_Burgess_Maise_2004"/&gt; A [[hotline]] was established, which provided "direct" and "immediate" communication&lt;ref name="BI_Burgess_Maise_2004"/&gt; to alleviate some of the "above-normal risk of nuclear war" through "notification procedures for accidental missile launches".&lt;ref name="BI_Burgess_Maise_2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs_1985_Pierre"&gt;{{cite web |title=Review of William L. Ury's "Beyond the Hotline"|first=Andrew J. |last=Pierre |quote="This is a quick-read version of a 1984 report to the U.S. Arms Control &amp; Disarmament Agency from the Nuclear Negotiation Project at Harvard Law School. It calls for moving beyond the present "hotline" between Moscow and Washington to a crisis control center jointly staffed by U.S. and Soviet military and diplomatic officers." |date=June 1, 1985 |access-date=October 21, 2018 |url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/reviews/capsule-review/1985-06-01/beyond-hotline-crisis-control-prevent-nuclear-war |publisher=[[Foreign Affairs]] |series=Capsule Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. civil rights movement====
Rumor control centers were established during the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States using Community Relations Service (CRS) mediators, who provided reliable telephone numbers, (early call centers), where new rumors could be reported, assessed and the results of the assessment accessed.&lt;ref name="CRM_1999_Salinas_interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRM_1980_Rumor_Control"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilrightsmediation.org/topics/1980.shtml |title=How did you control rumors? |first=Manuel |last=Salinas |series=[[Conflict Management Initiatives]] |work=Civil Rights Mediation via [[Conflict Information Consortium]] (CIS), University of Colorado |date=1980 |access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trusted rumor agents were either CRS, police departments, city officials, or "people with authority."&lt;ref name="CRM_1999_Salinas_interview"/&gt; In a 1999 interview, [[Manuel Salinas]], who served as mediator for CRS from 1968 to 1988,&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;Manuel Salinas—prior to his 20 years as mediator with CRS (1968 - 1988)—was the state of Colorado's director of Service, Employment and Rehabilitation (SER), a jobs program that was part of the "war on poverty".&lt;/ref&gt; said,&lt;ref name="CRM_1999_Salinas_interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.civilrightsmediation.org/interviews/Manuel_Salinas.shtml#B19801 |title=How did you control rumors? |first=Manuel |last=Salinas |series=Interviews on controlling rumors |work=Civil Rights Mediation, via [[Conflict Information Consortium]] (CIS), University of Colorado |date=July 26, 1999 |access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quotation |[I]f people heard of something, the community could call that number and say, "Hey we heard that fifty cars are coming down the highway," and we would verify that and say "yes' or "no". So rumor control involved getting as accurate information as possible, so that if anybody would call we could convey the correct information. Because rumors begin when you have something like that and they are way off the wall, but the person doesn't know that until you try to find out if it's true or not. The press might call, too. So that's what rumor control was about."|Manuel Salinas. Community Relations Service (1999)}}

The first rumor center in the United States was established in July 1967 by the City of Chicago.&lt;ref name="PolGeo_2014"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629813000942 |title=The word on the street: Rumor, “race” and the anticipation of urban unrest |first1=Stephen |last1=Young |first2=Alasdair |last2=Pinkerton |first3=Klaus |last3=Dodds |journal=Political Geography |volume=38 |pages=57–67 |date=January 2014 |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2013.11.001 |quote="Examined "the emergence of Rumor Control Centers (RCCs) across the US in the 1960s. There are a number of contemporary corollaries of RCCs in operation today." |access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}} "An ofﬁce was equipped with a radio, television and type-writer, and a large map of the city hung on one of the walls. Ten telephone lines were also installed, including direct lines to the Police Department and Mayor's Ofﬁce. Local government ofﬁcials encouraged citizens to call the Center if they heard a "rumor"—defined as information unveriﬁed by ofﬁcial sources—that suggested social tensions in the city were increasing.&lt;ref name="PolGeo_2014"/&gt;{{rp|57}} The Seattle Rumor Center was established by the "citizen-directed" State Council of Churches, in response to the rise of racial tension in 1968. The Rumor Center was operated "to stop the spread of rumors that might cause tension, panic or bring harm to an individual or group of persons, particularly in situations involving race relations." The Center closed in 1973 "because the need had changed and government agencies had developed methods for dealing with rumor control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archiveswest.orbiscascade.org/ark:/80444/xv03494 |title=Seattle Rumor Center records, 1968-1973 |access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.kuow.org/post/seattle-officials-feared-these-rumors-would-start-race-riots |title=Seattle officials feared these rumors would start race riots |first=Ann |last=Dornfeld |date=January 10, 2018 |access-date=October 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the end of the 1960s, a hundred cities across the United States had established RCCs.&lt;ref name="PolGeo_2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABS_Ponting_1973"/&gt; Local government, the private sector, and volunteers funded and operated the RCCs.&lt;ref name="PolGeo_2014"/&gt;{{rp|57}}&lt;ref name="ABS_Ponting_1973"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/000276427301600311 |title=Rumor Control Centers: Their Emergence and Operations |first=J.

====Niger uranium forgeries====
{{main|Niger uranium forgeries}}
On the eve of the [[Iraq War]] in the early 2000s, rumors and inaccuracies spread in the U.S. regarding [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD), including the false information, now known as the [[Niger uranium forgeries]], regarding Iraq's attempted [[uranium]] purchase from [[Niger]]. According to Burgess and Maiese, the Niger rumor, "was one of the many reasons" "the U.S. administration decided that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, or at least the ability to make them. This rumor later proved to be false, as did most of the other "facts" surrounding Iraq's WMD program. While the problems that led to the Iraq war were deeper than simple rumors, rumor control efforts might have played a significant role in slowing down the U.S.'s march to war".&lt;ref name="BI_Burgess_Maise_2004"/&gt;

==United States==
The United States Community Relations Service (part of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]) uses rumor control teams when mediating domestic racial conflicts.&lt;ref name="BI_Burgess_Maise_2004"/&gt;

===Background===
The [[Community Relations Service]] (CRS) was created by the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964#Title X|Civil Rights Act of 1964]] as a "peacemaker" to respond to potential ethnic or racial disputes that might result from the Act.&lt;ref name="Levine_2005_CRS"&gt;{{cite book |title=Resolving Racial Conflict: The Community Relations Service and Civil Rights, 1964-1989 |first=Bertram J. |last=Levine |publisher=University of Missouri Press |date=2005 |pages=262 |isbn=0826215580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="justice_gov_US"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrington|first=Christine|title=Shadow Justice: The Ideology and Institutionalization of Alternatives to Court|url=https://www.questia.com/read/24402327/shadow-justice-the-ideology-and-institutionalization|year=1985|publisher=Greenwood Press {{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}} |isbn=0313243328|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-871140.html|title=BCA Delays Boycott; Justice Department Offers to Mediate|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Steve|last2=Asher|first2=Mark|date=15 January 1994|work=Washington Post {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-181909420.html|title=Republican National Convention; Justice Department unit reaches out to police, protesters|last=Furst|first=Randy|date=July 22, 2008|work=Star Tribune {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the CRS, "worked with law enforcement, city officials, and community members to establish rumor control mechanisms to prevent the spread of false and inflammatory information."&lt;ref name="justice_gov_US"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/crs/file/627821/download |series=Community Relations Service |title=Police-Community Conflicts |date=nd |access-date=October 21, 2018 |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidi Burgess and Guy Burgess, directors and founders of the [[Conflict Information Consortium]] (CIC) based at the  [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], continue to edit and direct the ''[[Beyond Intractability Knowledge Base Project]]'' (BI) website as an extension of the [[Conflict Resolution|CRInfo]] website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.beyondintractability.org/about/bi |title=Beyond Intractability Knowledge Base Project |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess_2007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Colloquy: The challenge of intractable conflicts: Introduction to the colloquium |first1=Heidi |last1=Burgess |first2=Guy |last2=Burgess |first3=Sanda |last3=Kaufman |date=January 31, 2007 |doi=10.1002/crq.165 |volume=24 |number=2 |journal=[[Conflict Resolution Quarterly]]|pages=173-176 |publisher=[[Association for Conflict Resolution]] via [[Wiley Periodicals]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. rumor control centers ===
The U.S. had rumor control agencies at the national, state, regional, county, and municipal levels.

====National====

In his book describing the CRS history from 1964 to 1989, Bertram J. Levine described how a Rumor Control Center was set up in preparation for the May Day 1970 massive protest of the [[New Haven Black Panther trials]] on the [[New Haven Green]] near both the courthouse and [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hoover and the F.B.I.|url=https://www.pbs.org/hueypnewton/people/people_hoover.html|work=Luna Ray Films, LLC|publisher=PBS.org|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hoover Calls Panthers Top Threat to Security|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/147638465|accessdate=9 February 2017|work=The Washington Post|publisher=WP Company LLC d/b/a The Washington Post|date=16 July 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Panthers 'threaten' U.S., Hoover says|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/532216174|accessdate=9 February 2017|work=Afro-American|publisher=Afro - American Company of Baltimore City|date=Jul 26, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-[[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Director]] [[J.

Jack Middleton—a "seasoned community relations professional" with training in setting up and running an RCC—had helped design and operate a [[New Haven]] community-based RCC specifically for the 1970 protest. Levine said that the RCC—operated by Yale Divinity School volunteers in close collaboration with municipal information sources including local police—was a "textbook" example of an RCC run by a private organization. Middleton's manual on RCCs served as a template across the United States for many years. Levine said that the RCCs "played a vital role in limiting chaos during civil disorders."&lt;ref name="Levine_2005_CRS"/&gt;{{rp|115}}

[[Alachua County, Florida]] has a Rumor Control Center which was activated in 1990, after the serial murders of five local college students [http://communityservices.alachua.fl.us/new/crisis/services.htm].

==Rumor control and social media==
[[Social media]] makes it easier for rumors to spread,&lt;ref name="Kazienko_SocialMedia_2015"&gt;{{cite book |title=Applications of Social Media and Social Network Analysis |first1=Przemysław |last1=Kazienko |first2=Nitesh |last2=Chawla |publisher=Springer |date=May 28, 2015 |pages=240 |isbn=9783319190037}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} and more difficult for [[rumor control]] to be managed. By 2018, "rumor cascades"&lt;ref group="Notes"&gt;According to Vosoughi et al, "A rumor cascade begins on Twitter when a user makes an assertion about a topic in a tweet, which could include written text, photos, or links to articles online. Others then propagate the rumor by retweeting it. A rumor’s diffusion process can be characterized as having one or more cascades, which we deﬁne as instances of a rumor-spreading pattern that exhibit an unbroken retweet chain with a common, singular origin." The researchers noted that not all rumor cascades contain misinformation.&lt;/ref&gt; were under investigation as stories with serious inaccuracies were spread by millions of people (Vosoughi et al 2018:1146)."&lt;ref name="Science_2018_Vosoughi_rumor_cascades"/&gt;

===Rumor control strategies===

By 2013, research rumor spreading and control was often based on models used in [[epidemiology]], such as SI (susceptible (S), infected (I)), SIR (susceptible (S), infected (I), resistant (R)) models, and more recently, the SEIR model which includes "the flows of people between four states: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and resistant (R)".&lt;ref name="SEIR_Nesse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~hnesse/classes/seir.html |first=Hans |last=Nesse |series=Global Health |title=SEIR Model |location=Tempe, Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Precise Modeling Rumor Propagation and Control Strategy on Social Networks |first1=Yuanyuan |last1=Bao |first2=Chengqi |last2=Yi |first3=Yibo |last3=Xue |first4=Yingfei |last4=Dong |editor-last1=Kazienko |editor-first1=P. |editor-last2=Chawla |editor-first2=N. |title=Applications of Social Media and Social Network Analysis |series=Lecture Notes in Social Networks |date=2015 |publisher=Springer, Cham |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-19003-7_5 |isbn=978-3-319-19002-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=A new rumor propagation model and control strategy on social networks|date=August 2013 |doi=10.1145/2492517.2492599 |book-title=Proceedings of the 2013 IEEE/ACM International Conference on Advances in Social Networks Analysis and Mining |first1=Yuanyuan |last1=Bao |first2=Chengqi |last2=Yi |first3=Yibo |last3=Xue |first4=Yingfei |last4=Dong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah Kofman''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔfman|lang}}; September 14, 1934 &amp;ndash; October 15, 1994) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]].

==Biography==
Kofman began her teaching career in [[Toulouse]] in 1960 at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Lycée Saint-Sernin|fr}}, and worked with both [[Jean Hyppolite]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]].  Her abandoned primary thesis (''thèse principale'') for her [[State doctorate]], later published as ''Nietzsche et la métaphore'', was supervised by Deleuze. In 1969 Kofman met [[Jacques Derrida]] and began attending his seminars at the [[École Normale Supérieure]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

Kofman did not receive tenure until 1991, when she was appointed to a chair at [[Paris I]].

Kofman was the author of numerous books, including several on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. Her book, ''L'énigme de la femme: La femme dans les textes de Freud'' (1980), is perhaps the most thorough consideration of Freud's ideas concerning [[human female sexuality|female sexuality]].

==Writings==
Though many of her philosophical writings focused on Nietzsche and Freud, Kofman wrote several works in an autobiographical vein. ''Paroles suffoquées'' (1987) is dedicated to the memory of her father, rabbi [[Bereck Kofman]], whom she saw for the last time on July 16, 1942, and who was killed at [[Auschwitz]].

''Rue Ordener, rue Labat'' (1994) also opens with the removal of her father by the [[Vichy]] police, and describes what Kofman understands to have been his fate. The title refers to two Parisian streets: the address at which her family lived until her father's arrest; and the address at which she was sheltered for much of the remainder of the war. Kofman was taken in by a Parisian divorcée who became her surrogate mother and whom she called Mémé. The book tells the story of this period, and of the custody dispute between Mémé and Kofman's mother following the [[liberation of Paris]].

==Death==
Kofman committed [[suicide]] in 1994. The fact that she did so on the date of Nietzsche's 150th birthday&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/kofman-sarah JWA.org]&lt;/ref&gt; has been seen by some writers as significant.&lt;ref&gt;Christie McDonald, [http://www.erudit.org/revue/TTR/1998/v11/n2/037340ar.pdf Sarah Kofman: Effecting Self Translation], p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; After her death, Jacques Derrida wrote the following: 

{{quote|For she too was without pity, if not without mercy, in the end, for both Nietzsche and Freud, whom she knew and whose bodies of work she had read inside and out. Like no one else in this century, I dare say. She loved them pitilessly, and was implacable towards them (not to mention a few others) at the very moment when, giving them without mercy all that she could, and all that she had, she was inheriting from them and was keeping watch over what they had—what they still have—to tell us, especially regarding art and laughter.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Derrida, ''The Work of Mourning'' (Chicago &amp; London: University of Chicago Press, 2001), p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1194">In [[Roman Catholic]] [[theology]], '''Sententia fidei proxima''' refers to teachings, which are generally accepted as divine revelation but not defined as such by the Magisterium.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of Catholic dogma'' b Ludwig Ott, 1964, Herder, ASIN: B002BZOUAI page 9&lt;/ref&gt; These are below the [[Fides ecclesiastica]] level, but above [[Sententia certa]].

==Insight==
The sect and other self defining gnostics were the subject of criticism by the Church Fathers, these finding evidence of heresy and [[blasphemy]] caused by a  [[corruption]] of the truth of Christian doctrine. This the fathers may have attributed to the former weight of their [[ancestral sin]] or the result of persons with [[unclean spirit]]s.

'''Trishna''' ([[Sanskrit]]: तृष्णा) means – 'thirst' (''Caitanya Caritamrta'' Adi 4.149), 'aspiration' (''Caitanya Caritamrta'' Antya 14.44), 'longing', 'craving' or 'lusty desires' (''Srimad Bhagavatam'' 9.19.18),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trsna|url= http://vedabase.net/t/trsna}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as तृष्णज् meaning covetous, greedy or thirsting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit – English dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=783|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?p.2:254.apte}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Trishna'' is the Fourth ''Nidana'', spiritual love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theosophical Glossary|author=Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|publisher=Theosophical Publishing Society|page=344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mgEMAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Trishna+rig+veda&amp;dq=Trishna+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ot48U8a-FMnGrAe8x4F4&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAzgU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==

The Sanskrit root of the word ''Tṛishṇā'' (तृष्णा) is ''Tṛish'' (तृष्) meaning to be thirsty, to thirst, to thirst for (metaphorically), strong desire or long for. In the [[Vedas]] the accent is on the first syllable as in - ''Tṛishyā'' (to be thirsty), ''Tṛishṇākshaya'' (cessation of desire, tranquillity of mind, resignation, patience, content), ''Tṛishnāghna'' (quenching the thirst), ''Tṛishṇāmaya'' (ill with thirst), ''Tṛishṇāmāra'' (dying of thirst),  ''Tṛishṇāri'' (enemy of thirst), ''Tṛishālu'' (thirsting much, very thirsty), ''Tṛishyat'' (thirsting) or ''Tṛishya'' (thirst).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Sanskrit – English Dictionary|author=Monier Monier-Williams|publisher=|page=383|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Hp1MX8d8osC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=Trishna+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=md88U5OhB4WIrQespIHgDg&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAjgo#v=onepage&amp;q=Trishna%20rig%20veda&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Trishna'' in [[Pali]] (''tanha'') means thirst for life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedic theosophical Glossary|publisher=Theosophical university Press|url=http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/etgloss/tri-tz.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedic relevance==

The word ''Trishna'' appears in the [[Rig Veda]] in a few [[mantras]] where it refers to greed, craving, hankering or longing, and the like. In mantra Rig Veda (I.XXXVII.6), Rishi Ghora Kanva states:

:मो षु णः परा परा निर्ऋतिर्दुर्हणा बधीत् |
:पदीष्ट तृष्णया सह ||

He speaks about the (unfavourable ) wind (निर्ऋतिः) which flows on greedily (तृष्णया).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda Mandala 1 Hindi Bhasya|publisher=Sarvadeshika Arya Pratinidhi Sabha|page=222|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, in mantra Rig Veda (I.LXXXV.11), [[Gautama Maharishi|Rishi Rahugano Gotama]] stating -

:जिह्मं नुनुद्रेऽवतं तया दिशासिञ्चन्नुत्सं गोतमाय तृष्णजे |
:आ गच्छन्तीमवसा चित्रभानवः कामं विप्रस्य तर्पयन्त धामभिः ||

speaks about the wise ones craving (तृष्णजे) for opportunities to sate the thirst of those hankering (तर्पयन्त ) for knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rig Veda Mandala 10 Hindi Bhasya|publisher=Sarvadeshika Arya Pratinidhi Sabha|page=429|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist relevance==

[[Gautama Buddha]] said that the cause of sorrow – the second of the Four Noble Truths – is desire; and the cause of desire is ''tanha'' or ''trishna''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Theosophical Movement Vol.74|publisher=Theosophy Company|page=116|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XVbYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Trishna+rig+veda&amp;dq=Trishna+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_t48U6WID877rAft3oGIBQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwCDge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] teaches the doctrine of inaction, i.e. cessation of activity, desiring or doing little. The extinction of craving of the desire for existence in all its forms and the consequent cessation of suffering is [[Nirvana]]  (Nirvana is grasping nothingness and possessing nothing which state is reached through the knowledge of impermanence and voidness).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian History (Opt)|author=Reddy|publisher=Tata-McGraw- Hill Education|page=A158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CeEmpfmbxKEC&amp;pg=SL1-PA158&amp;dq=rig+veda+trishna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7eA8U86SGo3KrAfO44CoBg&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=rig%20veda%20trishna&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vivekananda]] holds that the Buddhist doctrine of giving up ''trishna'' ('greed') is an offshoot of [[Advaita Vedanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Life and Philosophy of Swami Vivekananda|author=Gopal Shrinivas Banhatti|publisher=Atlantic Publishers|page=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jK5862eV7_EC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=vedanta+trishna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TOI8U5V7xY6tB-jdgKgK&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=vedanta%20trishna&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Puranic relevance==

According to the ''[[Puranas]]'', ''Trishna'' is the daughter of Kamadeva or Kama, the god of love and husband of Rati; Aniruddha is her brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Parrot and the Starling|author=Rangilal|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4AwMAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=Trishna+rig+veda&amp;dq=Trishna+rig+veda&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_t48U6WID877rAft3oGIBQ&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAjge}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Vishnu Purana]] tells us that ''Anrita'' ('falsehood') married his own sister, ''Nikritti'' ('immorality') and had two sons, ''Bhaya'' ('fear') and ''Naraka'' ('hell'), and two daughters, ''Maya'' ('illusion' or 'deceit') and ''Vedana'' ('torture') who again married each other. The son of ''Bhaya'' and ''Maya'' is ''Mrityu'' ('death'), and ''Dukha'' ('sorrow' or 'pain') is the son of ''Naraka'' and ''Vedana''.

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] explains that the intellect (''buddhi'') of those who perceive the Being as affected with difference of space etc., cannot be brought immediately to an intuition of the highest reality; Brahman is to be realized as attributeless. He states that even if the knowers of Brahman of themselves abstain from objects of sensual enjoyment yet the thirst (''trishna'') caused by being addicted to sensuality in different births cannot at once be converted. Renunciation is ''brahmacāryam'' or ''stri-vishaya-tyāga''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Vedanta Philosophy|author=Subodh Kapoor|publisher=Genesis Publishing|pages=663, 666|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3odc7SK8pfEC&amp;pg=PA663&amp;dq=vedanta+trishna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=reE8U4TfD43wrQfTn4HoCA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=vedanta%20trishna&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Trishna'', that causes dukkha, the philosophical translation of which is unsatisfactoriness rather than pain, is immoderate desire as such; ''Trishna'' is the will-to-live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Schopenhauer and India Philosophy|author=arati Barua|publisher=Northern Book centre|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iX8PLajNrAIC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=vedanta+trishna&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=reE8U4TfD43wrQfTn4HoCA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=vedanta%20trishna&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upanishadic relevance==

In the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] (IV.iv.6) in the passage –

:इति नु कामयमानः; अथाकाम्यमानः – योऽकामो निष्काम आप्तकाम आत्तकामो न तस्य प्राणा उत्क्रामन्ति, ब्रह्मेव सन्ब्रह्माप्येति ||

the word ''Kāma'' (काम) refers to desires – the man who desires migrates, but the man who is without desires never migrates; of him who is without desires, who is free from desires, the objects of whose desire have been attained, and to whom all objects of desire are but the Self – the organs do not depart, being Brahman, he is merged in [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=498|url= http://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Search/Author=Swami%20Madhavananda}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held that the main fundamental Buddhist thought, [[Nirvana]] i.e. the removal of suffering by removal of ''trishna'', is an echo of the afore-cited [[Upanishadic]] [[doctrine]] of union with [[Brahman]] by the removal of ''Kāma''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Philosophy of the Upanishads |author=Paul Deussen|publisher=Cosimo|page=Preface|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-a0RHpZw78C&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=trishna+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BuM8U9bmKMWlrQfGx4DwDw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=trishna%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The truth is - that deeds come from ''upādāna'' (clinging to existence), ''upādāna'' comes from ''trishna'' (craving), ''trishna'' comes from ''vedana'' (torture), the perception of pain and pleasure, the desire for rest; sensation (contact with objects) brings desire for life or the will to live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sacred Books of the East|author=Epiphanius Wilson|publisher=The Floating Press|page=610|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hoV-aiNlwbgC&amp;pg=PA610&amp;dq=trishna+upanishads&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BuM8U9bmKMWlrQfGx4DwDw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=trishna%20upanishads&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Bhagavad Gita]]([[Shloka|Sloka]] XIV.7), [[Krishna]] tells [[Arjuna]] :-

:रजो रागात्मकं विद्धि तृष्णाऽऽसङ्गस्मुदभवम् |
:तन्निबध्नाति कौन्तेय कर्मसङ्गेन देहिनम् ||

: "Know that Rajas is essentially attachment; it is the source of craving and passion." 
: "O Son of Kunti! It binds the embodied Spirit with attachment to works."

Here, the word ''Rāga'' refers to attachment, and ''Trishna'', refers to the craving for what is unattained.

==Implication==

From the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (VIII.viii.5, VIII.ix.1,VIII.xii.1-3) we learn that the term ''Asura'' (आसुर) signifies the natural and impulsive ('demonical') actions of the senses which are promoted by the desire for an object of pleasure called ''Asu'' (असु), and that the term ''Deva'' (देव), which is derived from the verb ''Div'' (दिव) signifying 'illumination', stands for the functions of the senses illuminated by reason. [[Prajapati]] tells [[Indra]] that the body which is mortal because it is covered by death is the seat of the self which is immortal and bodiless; anything embodied is within the range of the desirable and the non-desirable which two aspects cannot affect one who has become unembodied. The tranquil one having become established in his own nature after rising up from his body reaches the supreme Light and becomes Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chandogya Upanishad|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=631–657|url= https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Search/Author=Swami%20Gambhirananda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vishnugupta ([[Chanakya]]) in his Chanakya Niti tells us that "anger is personification of ''[[Yama]]'', ('the demi-god of death'), thirst is like hellish river ''Vaitarani'', knowledge is like ''[[Kamadhenu]]'' ('the cow of plenty'), and contentment is like ''Nandanavana'' ('the garden of Indra')".{{cn|date=April 2014}}

'''[[Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)#Tsa Lung|Tsa lung]] Trul khor''' ({{lang-sa|[[vayu|vayv]]-adhisāra}} "magical movement instrument, channels and inner breath currents"), known in short as '''Trul khor''' "magical instrument" or "magic circle" ({{lang|sa|adhisāra}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wallace|first1=Karma Chagmé ; with commentary by Gyatrul Rinpoche ; translated by B. Alan|title=A spacious path to freedom : practical instructions on the union of Mahāmudrā and Atiyoga|date=1998|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=1559390719|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Vajrayana]] discipline which includes [[pranayama]] and body postures ([[asana]]s). From the perspective of [[Dzogchen]], the mind is merely ''vāyu'' "breath" in the body. Thus working with ''vāyu'' and the body is paramount, while meditation on the other hand is considered contrived and conceptual.

The late [[Namkhai Norbu]], a prominent proponent of trul khor, prefered to use the Sanskrit equivalent term, '''[[Yantra]] Yoga''', when writing in English. Trul khor derives from the instructions of the [[India]]n [[mahasiddha]]s who founded [[Vajrayana]].

Trul khor traditionally consists of [[108 (number)|108]] movements, including bodily movements (or dynamic [[asana]]s), incantations (or [[mantra]]s), [[pranayama]] and [[Mental image|visualizations]]. The flow or [[vinyāsa]] of movements are likened to [[Buddhist prayer beads|prayer beads]]. Trul khor asanas are depicted on the walls of the [[Dalai Lama]]'s summer temple of [[Lukhang]].

==Lung==
{{Main|Lung (Tibetan Buddhism)}}
Lung (Wylie) is equivalent to the Sanskrit [[vāyu]].

==English discourse==
[[Namkhai Norbu]] was the first to discuss Trul Khor in English with his book on Yantra Yoga,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Namkhai Norbu|last2=Andrico|first2=Fabio|title=Tibetan yoga of movement : the art and practice of yantra yoga|date=2013|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9781583945568}}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially a commentary on a practical yoga manual by [[Vairotsana]].  Namkhai Norbu began dissemination of Yantra Yoga through his practical teaching and esoteric transmission of this discipline within the International Dzogchen Community which he founded post 1975 from its seat in Italy, Merigar.

Chaoul (2006) has begun discussion of Bon traditions of Trul Khor in English with his thesis from [[Rice University]].&lt;ref name="Chaoul2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chaoul|first=Alejandro|title=Magical movements ('phrul 'khor): ancient yogic practices in the Bon religion and contemporary medical perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FH2ZNwAACAAJ|accessdate=7 March 2011
|year=2006|publisher=Rice University|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Chaoul makes reference to a commentary by the famed Bonpo Dzogchen master, [[Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen]].

{{Zen Buddhism}}
The '''''Tso-chan-i''''' (坐禅仪, [[Pinyin]]: '''''Zuo-Chan-Yi''''', '''''Principles of [[Zazen]]'''''), is a short [[Chan Buddhist]] meditation manual attributed to a monk named [[Changlu Zongze|Ch'ang-lu Tsung-tse]] (c. 11th century) during the Northern [[Song dynasty]] (CE 960 - 1126) which exemplifies the practice of seated meditation which aims at "sudden" enlightenment. According to Peter Gregory it is the "earliest known work of its kind in the Zen tradition."&lt;ref name=Gregory&gt;Gregory, Peter N; Ch 'ang-lu Tsung-tse and Zen Meditation in 'Traditions of Meditation in Chinese Buddhism'.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Tso-chan-i'' was later revised and expanded in 1202 by Yu Hsiang and this version was published together with Tsung-tse's monastic code ("Pure Regulations of the Zen Preserve"), the earliest extant Zen monastic code, which was widely circulated.&lt;ref name=Gregory /&gt;

==Outline==
In writing the ''Principles'', Tsung-tse was influenced by the works of the [[Tiantai]] meditation master [[Zhiyi]] as well as by the ''Cultivation and Realization According to the [[Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment]]'' by Kuei-feng Tsung-mi (780-841). The ''Principles'' actually quotes large parts of Zhiyi's introduction to meditation, the ''Xiao Zhi Guan,'' showing the extent of the Tiantai influence on Chinese Chan.&lt;ref name=Gregory /&gt; The 600-700 character text begins with a description of the traditional cross-legged meditation posture with eyes partially opened (criticizing [[Zhiyi]] for promoted closed eyes) and then outlines how the meditator is to watch his thoughts until his mind becomes [[samadhi|unified]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Do not think of any good or evil whatsoever. Whenever a thought occurs, be aware of it; as soon as you are aware of it, it will vanish. If you remain for a long period forgetful of objects, you will naturally become unified.&lt;ref name=Gregory /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike the meditation works of [[Zhiyi]], the 'Principles' doesn't outline a [[vipassana]] practice which leads to wisdom - [[prajña]]. This might be because the ideas of Tsung-tse seem to be related practices in the Chan chronicle ''Leng-ch'ieh shih-tzu chi'' and to the teachings of the [[East Mountain Teaching]], who taught that in quieting the mind one would be able to see one's innate [[Buddha nature]] and that this was a form of [[Subitism|sudden enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=Gregory /&gt;&lt;ref name="King, Sallie B page 158"&gt;King, Sallie B; Buddha Nature, page 158.&lt;/ref&gt; This teaching is also related to the concept of [[Tathatā]] or 'Suchness' which is derived from the [[Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana]]. Tsung-tse uses a well known metaphor to describe how practicing his kind of samadhi will lead the discovery of [[Hongaku|inherent wisdom]] already present in the mind:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To seek the pearl, we should still the waves; if we disturb the water, it will be hard to get. When the water of meditation is clear, the pearl of the mind will appear of itself. Therefore, the [[Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment|Perfect Enlightenment Sutra]] says, "Unimpeded, immaculate wisdom always arises dependent on meditation.&lt;ref name=Gregory /&gt;&lt;ref name="King, Sallie B page 158"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Influence==
The practice taught in this text seems to be at the core of the dispute in later Chan Buddhism between "sudden" and "gradual" teachings of the "Northern and Southern schools" illustrated in the ''[[Platform Sutra]]''. One major distinctions between the "sudden" and "gradual" approach was that the gradual was seen as a way to counteract mental hindrances while the "sudden" approach took metaphysical doctrines of Suchness and non-dual, inherent enlightenment as their theme and saw the practice of counteracting hindrances as counterproductive.&lt;ref name=Gregory /&gt; Thus while the practice of watching the mind outlined by Tsung-tse remained a central practice in Chan into the [[Tang Dynasty]] (e.g. in the works of [[Zongmi]]: "As soon as a thought occurs, be aware of it (''nien ch'i chi chueh''); as soon as you are aware of it, it will cease to exist. The profound gate of practice lies precisely here.") other, more radical teachers such as [[Mazu Daoyi]] emphasized the "celebration of the natural wisdom active in every thought", the idea that "everyday mind is the Way" and radical new methods of practice such as the practices of shouting, spontaneous dialogue and enigmatic sayings or anecdotes.&lt;ref name=Gregory /&gt; Even so, this simple and pared down style of seated meditation continued to be used by even the most iconoclastic of Chan Buddhists and laid the foundation for the practice known as "silent illumination" or "[[Shikantaza]]".

Included in various Zen monastic codes and text collections, the ''Tso-chan-i'' was widely imitated or used as a basis for other texts such as the ''Ju-ju chu-shih tso-ch'an i'' (''Layman Ju-ju's Principles of Meditation'', CE 1212?) and the ''Zazen gi'' by Muhon Kakushin (1207-1297). It was included in the popular Japanese Zen anthology, the ''Shibu roku'' ("Fourfold Record"), was quoted by [[Eisai]] in the ''Kazen gokoku ron'' and used by [[Dogen]] in his writing of the ''Fukanzazengi'' (''Universal Promotion of the Principles of Meditation'', CE 1233).&lt;ref name=Gregory /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bielefeldt, Carl. Dogen's Manuals of Zen Meditation&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willem Bernard "Wim" Drees''' (born 20 April 1954) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] philosopher. He is the [[editor-in-chief]] of [[Zygon (journal)|''Zygon, Journal of Religion &amp; Science'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zygonjournal.org/editorial_9_09.html |title=Zygon: Journal of Religion and Science |publisher=Zygonjournal.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1 November 2014 he is a humanities professor of philosophy at [[Tilburg University]] in the Netherlands.

==Biography==
Drees was born in the Hague on April 20, 1954, as the third child of five and the only son of [[Willem Drees jr]] (1922–1998) and Anna Erica Drees-Gescher (1922–1988). His paternal grandfather [[Willem Drees]] was the prime minister of the Netherlands from 1948 until 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. W. (Willem) Drees|url=https://www.parlement.com/id/vg09ll01jztw/w_willem_drees|website=www.parlement.com|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was also a Netherlands politician being the party leader of the [[Democratic Socialists '70]] from 1971 to 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. W. (Wim) Drees jr|url=https://www.parlement.com/id/vg09llecbrzz/w_wim_drees|website=www.parlement.com|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drees is a past-president of the [[European Society for the Study of Science and Theology]] (ESSSAT).{{cn|date=April 2018}} According to Tillburg University, Drees "was also dean of the Faculty of Theology and vice-dean of the Faculty of Humanities."&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; As of 1 November 2014, he is a  professor of philosophy within the Tilburg School of Humanities.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite press release|title=Persbericht Tilburg University 28 mei 2014|url=https://uvtapp.uvt.nl/tsb11/npc.npc.showpressreleasecm?v_id=6467821878823705|website=uvtapp.uvt.nl|language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Drees has been the editor and publisher of numerous books, journal articles, essays, book reviews and articles for the wider public. His books include ''Beyond the Big Bang: Quantum Cosmologies and God'' (1990), ''Religion, Science and Naturalism'' (1996), and ''Creation: From Nothing until Now'' (2002). 

==Religious naturalism and science==

===Naturalism===
Drees addressed the analysis of cosmology limit questions with the interpretation of the explanatory success of science. His second Fulbright grant resulted in the book - ''Religion, Science and Naturalism'' (1996).  [[John H. Brooke]], historian of science and religion, concluded a review of work of the Oxford theologian [[Keith Ward]] and Drees’s book: ''“Because he is as secure in his epistemology as in his knowledge of theoretical physics, Willem Drees should be read by all who take a scholarly interest in the discourses of ‘science and religion’. His arguments cannot be compressed into sound-bites, and that is their strength.”'' &lt;ref&gt;John H. Brooke - [[Times Literary Supplement]] , February 7, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] as addressed in his  ''Religious Naturalism and Science''  has remained a major component in Drees’s research.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; He has also paid attention in his analysis of naturalism to the understanding of human nature, with two edited volumes on anthropology and non-reductive physicalism in Dutch and one in English (2000).

William A. Rottschaefer argues that Drees’s naturalism is seriously flawed claiming that it is both methodologically and epistemologically naturalistic. Drees maintains while rejecting both of these that [[ontological naturalism]]  offers the best account of the natural world. It also provides for a supernaturalistic understanding of religion and theology. Although naturalism is often considered to be antithetical to theology and genuine religion, Drees proposes a scientifically informed  account of religion, which, he contends, is not only compatible with supernaturalism and theology but provides a better account of both.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118976751/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 ''How to Make Naturalism Safe for Supernaturalism: An Evaluation of Willem Drees's Supernaturalistic Naturalism''] by William A. Rottschaefer&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious Naturalism===
As the Vice President for Interdisciplinary Affairs of IRAS, Drees has participated in the formulative discussions of [[Religious Naturalism]] and helped organize a conference on Human Meaning in a Technological Culture (2001). When it comes to his position on this emerging worldview, Drees, says of himself:&lt;blockquote&gt;Am I a religious naturalist? Others have used that label on me. I am not sure I like the label, as it seems to constrain, whereas I want to explore. I also have some sympathy for the naturalistic theism described above. But certainly, precisely in the attitude of exploring, I fit the naturalism referenced above. Or I at least, I hope do. Even if I am not sure whether I am a religious naturalist, I am most interested in understanding what religious naturalism might mean, may become, and will offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clayton|first1=Philip|last2=Simpson|first2=Zachary|title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science|date=2006|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199279272|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eyrikGwJfCsC&amp;pg=PA108&amp;dq=Willem+b.+drees|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Conferences|url=http://www.iras.org/pastconferences.html|website=IRAS|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Jerome A. Stone]] in his 2008 book ''Religious Naturalism Today: The Rebirth of a Forgotten Alternative'' cites Drees as one of the leaders of the Religious Naturalism movement along with other member of IRAS – [[Ursula Goodenough]],  [[Karl Peters]], Connie Barlow, Michael Cavanaugh and Stone himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stone|first1=Jerome Arthur|title=Religious Naturalism Today: The Rebirth of a Forgotten Alternative|date=2009|publisher=International Society for Science and Religion|isbn=9780791475379|language=English|oclc=756930510}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2018}}

'''William J. Webb''' is a theologian, ordained [[Baptist]] minister and former professor of [[New Testament]] at [[Heritage Baptist College and Heritage Theological Seminary|Heritage Seminary]], [[Ontario]]. He is currently adjunct professor at Tyndale Seminary in Toronto. He is notable for developing the "redemptive-movement" hermeneutic in his book ''Slaves, Women &amp; Homosexuals: Exploring the Hermeneutics of Cultural Analysis'' (2001). This book argues for full role equality of men and women in the church and family while concluding that homosexuality is not a biblically sanctioned lifestyle. [[Craig Blomberg]] argues that Webb's "proposals concerning redemptive trajectories are among the more influential (and controversial) of new twenty-first century North American hermeneutical methods to emerge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blomberg|first1=Craig L.|author-link=Craig Blomberg|chapter=New Testament Studies in North America|title=Understanding the Times: New Testament Studies in the 21st Century: Essays in Honor of D.
