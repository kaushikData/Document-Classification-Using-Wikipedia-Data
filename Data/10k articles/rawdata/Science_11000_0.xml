In [[Internet culture]], the '''1% rule''' is a [[rule of thumb]] pertaining to participation in an internet community, stating that only 1% of the users of a website actively create new content, while the other 99% of the participants only [[Lurker|lurk]]. Variants include the ''1–9–90 rule'' (sometimes ''90–9–1 principle'' or the ''89:10:1 ratio''),&lt;ref name="arthur"/&gt; which states that in a collaborative website such as a [[wiki]], 90% of the participants of a community only view content, 9% of the participants edit content, and 1% of the participants actively create new content.

Similar rules are known in [[information science]], such as the 80/20 rule known as the [[Pareto principle]], that 20 percent of a group will produce 80 percent of the activity, however the activity may be defined.

==Definition==
The 1% rule states that the number of people who create content on the Internet represents approximately 1% of the people who view that content. For example, for every person who posts on a forum, generally about 99 other people view that forum but do not post. The term was coined by authors and bloggers Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba,&lt;ref name="1% rule"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.churchofthecustomer.com/blog/2006/05/charting_wiki_p.html|title=The 1% Rule: Charting citizen participation|last1=McConnell|first1=Ben|first2=Jackie |last2=Huba|date=May 3, 2006|work=Church of the Customer Blog|accessdate=2010-07-10|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100511081141/http://www.churchofthecustomer.com/blog/2006/05/charting_wiki_p.html|archivedate= 11 May 2010 &lt;!--Added by DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; although earlier references to the same concept&lt;ref name="100-10-1"/&gt; did not use this name.

The terms ''lurk'' and ''lurking'', in reference to online activity, are used to refer to online observation without engaging others in the community, and were first used by veteran print journalist, P. Tomi Austin, circa 1990, when her presence was noticed by other users in chat rooms, who queried her reasons for not engaging in chat.{{cn|date=September 2017}} There were repeated inquiries about her identity and her refusal to engage in chat. The etiquette was, apparently, to greet other users upon entry into the chat rooms/sites. At the time, (then in her 30s, surfing among users averaging in their teens and 20s) she was only identified as "Bilbo", she explained that she was a mature, but computer-literate, user and novice to chat, and preferred to ''lurk'', or was ''lurking'' to familiarize herself with the chat culture, etiquette, and the sites to which she had logged on. In some instances, she needed to explain her coinage of the term "lurking", as the term was new to the online community, but others quickly understood her meaning. To her knowledge, the terms had not been used prior to that period, and there appears to be no earlier dated reference to the coinage.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

A 2005 study of radical Jihadist forums found 87% of users had never posted on the forums, 13% had posted at least once, 5% had posted 50 or more times, and only 1% had posted 500 or more times.&lt;ref name="1% doctrine"&gt;Awan, A. N. (2007b) [http://ecs.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/3/389 'Virtual Jihadist media: Function, legitimacy, and radicalising efficacy'], ''European Journal of Cultural Studies'', vol. 10(3), pp. 389–408.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2014 peer-reviewed paper entitled "The 1% Rule in Four Digital Health Social Networks: An Observational Study" empirically examined the 1% rule in health oriented online forums. The paper concluded that the 1% rule was consistent across the four support groups, with a handful of "Superusers" generating the vast majority of content. &lt;ref&gt;van Mierlo T. [https://www.jmir.org/2014/2/e33/ The 1% Rule in Four Digital Health Social Networks: An Observational Study.] ''J Med Internet Res'' 2014;16(2):e33.&lt;/ref&gt; A study later that year, from a separate group of researchers, replicated the 2014 van Mierlo study in an online forum for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carron-Arthur|first1=B|last2=Cunningham|first2=JA|last3=Griffiths|first3=KM|title=Describing the distribution of engagement in an Internet support group by post frequency: A comparison of the 90-9-1 Principle and Zipf's Law|journal=Internet Interventions|date=2014|volume=1|issue=4|pages=165-168|url=http://www.invent-journal.com/article/S2214-7829(14)00027-X/abstract?cc=y=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results indicated that the distribution frequency of the 1% rule fit followed [[Zipf's Law]], which is a specific type of a [[power law]].  

The "90–9–1" version of this rule states that for websites where users can both create and edit content, 1% of people create content, 9% edit or modify that content, and 90% view the content without contributing.

The actual percentage is likely to vary depending upon the subject matter.  For example, if a forum requires content submissions as a condition of entry, the percentage of people who participate will probably be significantly higher than one percent, but the content producers will still be a minority of users. This is validated in a study conducted by Michael Wu, who uses economics techniques to analyze the participation inequality across hundreds of communities segmented by industry, audience type, and community focus.&lt;ref name="The Economics of 90–9–1"/&gt;

The 1% rule is often misunderstood to apply to the Internet in general, but it applies more specifically to any given Internet community. It is for this reason that one can see evidence for the 1% principle on many websites, but aggregated together one can see a different distribution. This latter distribution is still unknown and likely to shift, but various researchers and pundits have speculated on how to characterize the sum total of participation. Research in late 2012 suggested that only 23% of the population (rather than 90 percent) could properly be classified as lurkers, while 17% of the population could be classified as intense contributors of content.&lt;ref name="Participant choice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2012/05/bbc_online_briefing_spring_201_1.html|title=BBC Online Briefing Spring 2012: The Participation Choice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several years prior, results were reported on a sample of students from Chicago where 60 percent of the sample created content in some form.&lt;ref name="Participation divide"&gt;Hargittai, E. and Walejko, G. (2008) [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13691180801946150 'The Participation Divide: Content creation and sharing in the digital age'], ''Information, Communication and Society'', vol. 11(2), pp. 389–408.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participation inequality==
A similar concept was introduced by Will Hill of [[AT&amp;T Laboratories]]&lt;ref name="Edit wear and read wear"/&gt; and later cited by [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]]; this was the earliest known reference to the term "[[participation inequality]]" in an online context.&lt;ref name="participation_inequality"/&gt; The term regained public attention in 2006 when it was used in a strictly quantitative context within a blog entry on the topic of marketing.&lt;ref name="1% rule"/&gt;

It was also the focus of an interview feature with the author in ''[[Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-whittle/ben-ramalingam-on-aid-and_b_805838.html |title=Dennis Whittle: Ben Ramalingam on Aid and Complexity |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''Aid on the Edge of Chaos'' was the subject of a public lecture by Ben Ramalingam at the [[Royal Society of Arts]], London, in December 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thersa.org/events/our-events/whats-next-for-foreign-aid |title=What's Next For Foreign Aid? |publisher=RSA |date=2013-12-05 |accessdate=2014-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203133836/http://www.thersa.org/events/our-events/whats-next-for-foreign-aid |archivedate=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an event chaired by [[Geoff Mulgan]], CEO of [[NESTA]]. The book was discussed by Ramalingam and Sir John Holmes at the [[Oxford Literary Festival]] in March 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxfordliteraryfestival.org/literature-events/2014/Thursday-27/aid-on-the-edge-of-chaos-how-do-we-make-it-count |title=Ben Ramalingam and John Holmes Interviewed by Bidisha - Aid on the Edge of Chaos: How Do We Make it Count - 27 Mar 2014 |publisher=Oxford Literary Festival |date=2014-03-27 |accessdate=2014-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; an event chaired by leading British filmmaker and author [[Bidisha]].

'''Arcus''' is a proposed [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] [[space observatory]] proposed to NASA's [[Explorer program]], Medium Explorer (MIDEX) class.  

The Arcus mission would study [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and [[galaxy cluster]]s using high-resolution [[X-ray spectroscopy]] to characterize the interactions between these objects and the diffuse hot gas that permeates them. The Principal investigator is Randall Smith at the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts; the project has significant contributions from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], cosine Measurement Systems (Warmond NL), [[PennState]], and the [[Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics]].&lt;ref name='Harvard Press'/&gt;&lt;ref name=SRON/&gt;

==Overview==

Arcus's spectrograph was originally intended to fly on the cancelled [[International X-ray Observatory]] (IXO).&lt;ref name='Arcus home'&gt;[http://www.arcusxray.org/ Arcus Mission] - Home page. Accessed: April 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2011 cancellation, Arcus was proposed as a mission in 2014 to the [[Small Explorer program]] (SMEX) but it was not selected for development. After numerous technological advances later, Arcus was again proposed to NASA in 2016 to the [[Explorers program#Medium Explorer|Medium Exproler program]] (MIDEX) and was awarded $2 million to refine their mission concept (Phase A study) over nine-months.&lt;ref name='Proposals 2017'/&gt; If selected, it would be funded $250 million for development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.psu.edu/story/480301/2017/08/31/research/nasa-selects-arcus-phase-studies NASA selects Arcus for Phase A studies]. ''Penn State News''. 31 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arcus is an [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray grating spectrometer]] space observatory that combines X-ray optics and [[X-ray spectroscopy#Grating spectrometers|gratings]] to disperse the X-rays, much like how a prism separates sunlight into the colors of the rainbow.&lt;ref name='Harvard Press'/&gt; It would observe astrophysical phenomena in X-ray band over a broad target size range. Its mission includes investigations on the composition of [[cosmic dust]] grains, [[stellar evolution]], identify the launching mechanisms of [[supermassive black hole]] winds, and structure formation of [[galaxy cluster]]s. Using new technologies, it offers a resolution improvement of ten times better than existing X-ray observatories.&lt;ref name='Arcus home'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://phys.org/news/2018-01-high-resolution-x-ray-enable-state-of-the-art-spectrometer.html High-resolution X-ray gratings enable state-of-the-art spectrometer]. ''Phys Org''. 9 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The space observatory would orbit Earth in a 4:1 lunar resonance, which would allow significant stability for minimal propellant consumption, which could extend the mission life to about 10 years.&lt;ref name='Smith 2018'&gt; [https://authors.library.caltech.edu/84178/1/103970Q.pdf Arcus: exploring the formation and evolution of clusters, galaxies, and stars].

It is competing for selection for the next [[Explorers program#Medium-Class Explorers|Medium-Class Explorers]] mission, which will take place in 2019, between Arcus and [[SPHEREx]].&lt;ref name='Proposals 2017'&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-proposals-to-study-galaxies-stars-planets NASA Selects Proposals to Study Galaxies, Stars, Planets].

An '''autoguider''' is an automatic electronic guidance tool used in [[astronomy]] to keep a telescope pointed precisely at an object being observed. This prevents the object from drifting across the [[field of view]] during [[Long-exposure photography|long-exposure]]s which would create a blurred or elongated image.

==Usage==
Imaging of dim celestial targets, usually [[deep sky object]]s, requires [[Shutter speed|exposure times]] of many minutes, particularly when narrowband images are being taken. In order for the resulting image to maintain usable clarity and sharpness during these exposures, the target must be held at the same position within the telescope's field of view during the whole exposure; any apparent motion would cause point sources of light (such as [[stars]]) to appear as streaks, or the object being photographed to appear blurry. Even computer-tracked mounts and [[GoTo (telescopes)|GoTo telescope]]s do not eliminate the need for tracking adjustments for exposures beyond a few minutes, as astrophotography demands an extremely high level of precision that these devices typically cannot achieve, especially if the mount is not properly [[polar alignment|polar aligned]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lodriguss|first=Jerry|title=Polar Aligning|url=http://www.astropix.com/HTML/I_ASTROP/TRACKED/POLAR.HTM|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;note: This can be accomplished by manually adjusting the orientation of one or both axes of an [[equatorial mount]] to hold either the target itself or a nearby [[guide star]] at a certain position, but such a method is difficult and time-consuming.&lt;/ref&gt;

To accomplish this automatically an autoguider is usually attached to either a guidescope or [[finderscope]], which is a smaller telescope oriented in the same direction as the main telescope, or an off-axis guider, which uses a prism to divert some of the light originally headed towards the eyepiece.

The device has a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] or [[CMOS]] sensor that regularly takes short exposures of an area of sky near the object.  After each image is captured, a computer measures the apparent motion of one or more stars within the imaged area and issues the appropriate corrections to the telescope's computerized mount.

Some computer controlled telescope mounts have an autoguiding port that connects directly to the autoguider (usually referred to as an ST-4 port, which works with analog signals).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.themcdonalds.net/richard/index.php?title=Astrophotography_Equipment:_Autoguiding#Mount_with_Autoguider_Connector&lt;/ref&gt;

An autoguider need not be an independent unit; some high-end CCD imaging units (such as those offered by [[Santa Barbara Instrument Group|SBIG]]) have a second, integrated CCD sensor on the same plane as the main imaging chip that is dedicated to autoguiding. Astronomical video cameras or modified [[webcam]]s can also serve as an autoguiding unit when used with guiding software such as Guidedog or PHD Guiding,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PHD Guiding|url=http://www.stark-labs.com/phdguiding.html|publisher=Stark Labs|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; or general-purpose astronomical programs such as MaxDSLR.&lt;ref name="DigitalAstro"&gt;{{cite book

Since an image of a star can take up more than one pixel on an [[image sensor]] due to lens imperfections and other effects, autoguiders use the amount of light falling on each [[pixel]] to calculate where the star should actually be located. As a result, most autoguiders have ''subpixel accuracy''.  In other words, the star can be tracked to an accuracy better than the angular size represented by one CCD pixel.  However, atmospheric effects ([[astronomical seeing]]) typically limit accuracy to one [[arcsecond]] in most situations.  To prevent the telescope from moving in response to changes in the [[guide star]]'s apparent position caused by seeing, the user can usually adjust a setting called "aggressiveness".&lt;ref name="DigitalAstro"/&gt;

==Notable projects==
[[File:Battelle Memorial Institute Columbus1.JPG|thumb|left|185px|View of Columbus facilities from King Ave.]]
In the 1940s, Battelle's Vice-President of Engineering, [[John Crout]] made it possible for Battelle researchers, including [[William Bixby]] and [[Paul Andrus]], to develop [[Chester Carlson]]'s concept of dry copying.  Carlson had been turned down for funding by more than a dozen agencies including the U.S. Navy.  Work led to the first commercial xerographic equipment, and to the formation of [[Xerox]] corporation.

Battelle also developed the first nuclear fuel rods for nuclear reactors, numerous advances in metallurgy that helped advance the United States space program, algorithms and coatings that led to the first optical digital recorder developed by [[James Russell (inventor)|James Russell]], which paved the way for the first compact disc, and the first generation jet engines using titanium alloys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.battelle.org/SPOTLIGHT/tech_forecast/75.aspx Battelle Memorial Institute Firsts] Retrieved 26 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other advances included the armor plating for [[tank]]s in [[World War II]]; [[Snopake]], the first [[correction fluid]], developed in 1955; the fuel for the first [[nuclear submarine]], the [[USS Nautilus (SSN-571)]]; development of the [[Universal Product Code]] in 1965; [[cruise control]] for automobiles in 1970; and the first all-[[Sputtering|sputtered]] [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic cell]] for [[solar energy]] in 1974. In 1987, PIRI, a [[fiber optics]] venture with [[Mitsubishi]] and NTT, was launched, which resulted in a $1.8 billion market. In conjunction with Kevin M. Amula, Battelle Geneva developed "No-melt" [[chocolate]] in 1988.

Battelle has made numerous medical advances, including a 1972 breakthrough development of special tubing to prevent blood clots during surgical procedures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stlcommercemagazine.com/archives/april2006/report.html St. Louis Commerce Magazine, "A Tale of Four Cities"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120010556/http://www.stlcommercemagazine.com/archives/april2006/report.html |date=November 20, 2008 }} Retrieved 26 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently, the development of reusable insulin injection pen, including dose memory, with [[Eli Lilly and Co.]].

Battelle was the contractor for a computer system on which the [[Voter News Service]] relied for tallying [[exit polling]] data in the [[United States elections, 2002|November 2002 U.S. Congressional and Senate elections]]; the system failed and results were not reported until ten months after the election. The failure led to the disbanding of the VNS and the formation of its replacement, the [[National Election Pool]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=David| last=Bauder| date=September 5, 2003| title=VNS Data From '02 Midterm Votes Released| agency=[[Associated Press]] {{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}| url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-79260276.html| accessdate=August 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WaPo2003&gt;{{cite news| first=Richard| last=Morin| date=January 14, 2003| title=Networks To Dissolve Exit Poll Service| newspaper=Washington Post| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A51692-2003Jan13?language+printer| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110804221517/https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A51692-2003Jan13?language+printer|archivedate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2004&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rutenberg|first1=Jim|title=Report Says Problems Led to Skewed Surveying Data|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/05/politics/campaign/report-says-problems-led-to-skewed-surveying-data.html|work=The New York Times|date=5 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battelle Center for Science and Technology Policy (OSU/Glenn)==

Battelle provides funds for a public policy research center at the [[John Glenn College of Public Affairs]] of [[The Ohio State University]] to focus on scholarly questions associated with science and technology policy. The Battelle Center for Science and Technology Policy began official operation in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.battellecenter.org Battelle Center for Science and Technology Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The vision of the CELAR project was to provide automatic, multi-grained resource allocation for cloud applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grid.ucy.ac.cy/index.php/news/74-press-release-celar-automatic-multi-grained-elasticity-provisioning-for-the-cloud- |title=Press Release, Celar, Automatic multi-grained elasticity-provisioning for the cloud, 18 November,2012 |publisher=Grid.ucy.ac.cy |date=2012-11-18 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enabled the commitment of just the right amount of resources based on application demand, performance and requirements, results in optimal use of infrastructure resources and significant reductions in administrative costs.

The outcome of the CELAR project is an open-source toolkit; a set of tools that allows you to automatically, elastically scale your application deployments. Using the CELAR Platform, you the user can perform the following steps:

* Define deployments of their complex multi-tier distributed application
* Specify the application specific elasticity constraints and actions to fulfil them
* Provide the application custom monitoring probes, provision the application on Clouds with one button click
* Then you can let the CELAR Platform manage and control the scalability lifecycle domain of the application.

CELAR features a c-Eclipse ([[Eclipse (software)]] GUI for defining the application’s topology, deployment and elasticity constraints. User application deployments can be defined in any scripting language with an ability to incorporate any of the configuration management systems ([[Chef (software)]], [[Puppet (software)]] etc.).

==Background==
Auto Scaling Resources is one of the top obstacles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/prototype/celar/ |title=Distributed Systems Group |publisher=Infosys.tuwien.ac.at |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opportunities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tendersinfo.com/details-12609812.php |title=Greece : CELAR: Automatic, multi-grained elasticity-provisioning for the Cloud in GREECE ( 12609812 ) |publisher=Tendersinfo.com |date=2012-10-04 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; for cloud computing: consumers can minimize the execution time of their tasks without exceeding a given budget. Cloud providers maximise their financial gain while keeping their customers satisfied and minimizing administrative costs. Many systems claim to offer adaptive elasticity, yet the “throttling” is usually performed manually, requiring the user to figure out the proper scaling conditions. In order to harvest the benefits of elastic provisioning, it is imperative that it be performed in an automated, fully customizable manner. CELAR delivers a fully automated and highly customisable system for elastic provisioning of resources in cloud computing platforms.

https://www.fi-athens.eu/media/celar
Craig Sheridan, Head of Research [[Flexiant Limited|Flexiant]] said in a statement:

“Combining our consultancy and expertise of cloud orchestration with world class academic and industrial partners in this project will offer the consortium the qualitative and quantitative information necessary to gauge platform and application performance to facilitate intelligent deployment decisions.”&lt;ref name="thewhir1"/&gt;

==Objective==
The goal of the CELAR project was to develop methods and open-source tools for applying and controlling multi-grained, elastic resource provisioning for Cloud applications in an automated manner. This resource allocation is to be performed through intelligent decision-making based on:

(a) Cloud and application performance metrics collected and cost-evaluated through a scalable monitoring system and exposed to the user.
(b) Qualitative and quantitative characterisation of the application‘s performance through modelling of its elastic properties.

[https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=wgwP96QAAAAJ&amp;hl=en Nectarios Koziris], Project Coordinator and Associate Professor of the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the [[National Technical University of Athens]] explains:

“The result of CELAR is a software package that offers organisations the right amount of resources based on application demand, performance and requirements resulting in optimal use of infrastructure resources and significant reductions in administrative costs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sixsq.com/news/2012/11/16/news-celar-kickoff.html |title=SixSq. CELAR - Automatic Multi-Grained Elasticity-Provisioning for Cloud |publisher=Sixsq.com |date=2012-11-16 |accessdate=2014-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201203613/http://sixsq.com/news/2012/11/16/news-celar-kickoff.html# |archive-date=2014-02-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CELAR covers the three layers required by an application to operate over the Cloud:

* Infrastructure layer
* Monitoring/optimization middleware (automatic elasticity provisioning over cloud platforms and multi-layer monitoring)
* Programming development environment (through a distributed tool to enable developers, administrators and users to define the characteristics of their applications, deploy them, and monitor performance).

The outcome is a modular, completely open-source system that offers elastic programmability for the user and automatic elasticity at the platform level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihe-online.com/feature-articles/reaching-for-the-skies-healthcare-and-cloud-computing/index.html |title=Reaching for the skies: Healthcare and cloud computing |publisher=Ihe-online.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This outcome can be bundled in a single software package for one-click installation of any application alongside its automated resource provisioning over a Cloud IaaS.

Two exemplary applications that showcase and validate the aforementioned technology will be developed: The first will showcase the use of CELAR technology for massive data management and large-scale collaboration required in the on-line gaming realm, while the second will focus on the area of scientific computing, requiring compute- and storage-intensive genome computations.

The CELAR consortium – under the lead of [[List of research institutes in Greece|ATHENA Research and Innovation Center]] – achieved its objectives by bringing together a team of leading researchers in the large-scale technologies such as Cloud/Grid Computing, service-oriented architectures, virtualization, analytics, Web 2.0 and the world of the Semantic Web.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Čeština |url=http://www.linkedin.com/groups/Celar-FP7-4758281 |title=Celar FP7 |publisher=LinkedIn |date=2013-01-09 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are combined with active industrial and leading user organizations that offer expertise in the cloud application domain and production-level service provisioning.

'''Candida hypersensitivity''' is a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] disease promoted by William G. Crook, M.D.&lt;ref name="Crook"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Yeast Connection: A Medical Breakthrough|year=1986|first=William G.|last=Crook|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0933478062}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is spuriously claimed that chronic yeast infections are responsible for many common disorders and [[Symptom#Non-specific symptoms|non-specific symptoms]] including [[fatigue]], [[weight gain]], [[constipation]], [[dizziness]], muscle and joint [[pain]], [[asthma]], and others.&lt;ref name="SBM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Candida and Fake Illnesses|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/|website=Science-Based Medicine|date=25 September 2013|access-date=4 July 2018|first=Steven|last=Novella}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''[[Candida (fungus)|Candida albicans]]'' is a [[fungus]] that colonizes a large majority of the population (meaning it is present in the body but not causing an infection or any problems). Under certain conditions, however, it can cause an [[Candidiasis|infection]]. The most common manifestations are thrush (a superficial ''Candida'' infection in the mouth) and [[vaginitis]], also commonly referred to as a yeast infection. ''Candida'' can also cause serious [[systemic infection]], but this is almost always restricted to those with [[Immunodeficiency|compromised immune systems]], such as patients undergoing [[chemotherapy]] or with advanced [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="SBM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Candida and Fake Illnesses|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/candida-and-fake-illnesses/|website=Science-Based Medicine|date=25 September 2013|access-date=4 July 2018|first=Steven|last=Novella}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symptoms==
After reading publications by C. Orian Truss, M.D.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Truss|first=CO|title=The Missing Diagnosis|location=Birmingham, AL|publisher=The Missing Diagnosis, Inc.|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Crook proposed the idea that a condition he termed systemic candidiasis, or '''Candida hypersensitivity''', was responsible for a long list of common conditions and [[Symptom#Non-specific symptoms|non-specific symptoms]] including [[fatigue]], [[asthma]], [[psoriasis]], [[sexual dysfunction]], and many others.&lt;ref name="SBM"/&gt; The list of symptoms is similar to that of [[multiple chemical sensitivity]].&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"/&gt; Many patients presenting with symptoms of environmental sensitivity claim to suffer from multiple "fashionable" syndromes.&lt;ref name="Stewart1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stewart|first1=Donna E.|title=The Changing Faces of Somatization|journal=Psychosomatics|volume=31|issue=2|year=1990|pages=153–158|issn=00333182|doi=10.1016/S0033-3182(90)72188-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology]] strongly criticized the concept of "candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome" and the diagnostic and treatment approaches its proponents use. AAAAI's position statement concludes: (1) the concept of candidiasis hypersensitivity is speculative and unproven; (2) its basic elements would apply to almost all sick patients at some time because its supposed symptoms are essentially universal; (3) overuse of oral antifungal agents could lead to the development of resistant germs that could menace others; (4) adverse effects of oral antifungal agents are rare, but some inevitably will occur; and (5) neither patients nor doctors can determine effectiveness (as opposed to coincidence) without controlled trials. Because allergic symptoms can be influenced by many factors, including emotions, experiments must be designed to separate the effects of the procedure being tested from the effects of other factors.&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndersonChai1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=J|last2=Chai|first2=H|last3=Claman|first3=H|last4=Ellis|first4=E|last5=Fink|first5=J|last6=Kaplan|first6=A|last7=Lieberman|first7=P|last8=Pierson|first8=W|last9=Salvaggio|first9=J|last10=Sheffer|first10=A|title=Candidiasis hypersensitivity syndromeApproved by the executive committee of the American academy of allergy and immunology|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=78|issue=2|year=1986|pages=271–273|issn=00916749|doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(86)80073-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2005, scientists were taking note of "a large [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] cult"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odds|first1=FC|title=Candida infections: an overview.|journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology|date=1987|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–5|pmid=3319417|doi=10.3109/10408418709104444}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had developed around the topic of [[Candidiasis|yeast infections]], with claims that up to one in three people were affected by yeast-related illnesses including Candida hypersensitivity.&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Stephen Barrett, M.D.|title=Dubious "Yeast Allergies"|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html|date=October 8, 2005|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513203124/http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/candida.html|archivedate=May 13, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Legal action==
Some practitioners of alternative medicine have promoted dietary supplements as supposed cures for this non-existent illness, rendering themselves liable to prosecution.&lt;ref name="Barrett2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NCAHF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncahf.org/articles/c-d/candida.html |title=Candidiasis Hypersensitivity |accessdate=18 January 2014 |publisher=[[National Council Against Health Fraud]] |author=Jarvis WT}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, alternative health vendor [[Nature's Way]] signed a [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] consent agreement not to misrepresent in advertising any self-diagnostic test concerning yeast conditions or to make any unsubstantiated representation concerning any food or supplement's ability to control yeast conditions, with a fine of US$30,000 payable to the [[National Institutes of Health]] for research in genuine candidiasis.&lt;ref name="NCAHF" /&gt;

'''Charles-François Delamarche''' (1740 - 1817) was a French geographer and mapmaker.
[[File:Charles Francois Delamarshe Carte générale de l'Asie divisée en ses principaux états 1818.jpg|thumb|«Carte générale de l'Asie divisée en ses principaux états»,  ,Delamarche, 1818]]
One of the most important French geographers and mapmakers of the second half of the eighteenth century. Successor to [[Nicolas Sanson]] (1600 – 1667), [[Robert de Vaugondy]] (1686 – 1766), and [[Rigobert Bonne]] (1727 – 1794), whose [[atlas]]es he reprinted. Also taught [[geography]]. In addition to maps and globes, his works include a treatise on the use of the sphere and celestial and terrestrial globes. In the treatise, he illustrates both the [[Ptolemaic system|Ptolemaic]] and [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican system]]s, as well as listing all the ancient and modern [[constellation]]s. His son [[Félix Delamarche]] (18th century – 1st half 19th century) continued his work.

'''''Chemisches Zentralblatt''''' is the first and oldest abstracts [[Academic journal|journal]] published in the field of [[chemistry]]. It covers the chemical literature from 1830 to 1969 and describes therefore the “birth” of chemistry as [[science]], in contrast to [[alchemy]]. The information contained in this German journal is comparable with the content of the leading source of chemical information [[Chemical Abstracts Service]] (CAS), which started publishing abstracts in English in 1907.

''Chemisches Zentralblatt'' was founded as ''Pharmaceutisches Centralblatt'' by [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] &lt;ref name=Pfl&amp;uuml;cke&gt;M. Pfl&amp;uuml;cke:'' Das Chemische Zentralblatt 125 Jahre alt'', [[Angewandte Chemie|Angew. Chem.]] ''66'' ('''1954''') 537-541, [[DOI: :10.1002/ange.19540661708]].&lt;/ref&gt; and published by Leopold Voß in [[Leipzig]]&lt;ref name=Willst&amp;auml;tter&gt;R. Willst&amp;auml;tter: ''Zur Hundertjahrfeier des Chemischen Zentralblattes'', [[Angewandte Chemie|Angew. Chem.]] ''42'' ('''1925''') 1049-1052, [[DOI: :10.1002/ange.19290424502]].&lt;/ref&gt; in 1830. In the first year, 544 pages containing 400 abstracts were published, reporting all relevant research results in [[pharmaceutical chemistry]]. In the following 20 years the relevance of chemistry grew so much that in 1850 the title changed in ''Chemisch-Pharmazeutisch Zentralblatt'', and in 1856 it became ''Chemisches Zentralblatt''.&lt;ref name="Pfl&amp;uuml;cke"/&gt; In 1969, after 140 years the expenses for the collection of primary literature in many languages and the production of abstracts were too high and the publication of ''Chemisches Zentralblatt ceased''.&lt;ref name=Weiske&gt;Christian Weiske:'' Das Chemische Zentralblatt – ein Nachruf'', ''[[Chemische Berichte]]'' ''106'' ('''1973''') I−XVI, [[DOI: 10.1002/cber.19731060435]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In these 140 years, scientific editors reported research progresses in chemistry with approximately 2 million abstracts, publishing over 650,000 pages. Additional 180,000 pages contain indexes such as index of authors, subject indexes, general indexes, register of patents, and formula register.&lt;ref name="Weiske"/&gt;

''Chemisches Zentralblatt'' was completely digitized by [http://www.fiz-chemie.de/home/produkte-services/chemische-daten/chemie-ab-1830.html ''FIZ Chemie''] in Berlin. ''FIZ Chemie'' scanned the entire work and developed a full text searchable database for the web. In addition the database can be purchased and integrated in [[Intranet]]s. The chemical software company [http://www.infochem.de InfoChem], based in [[Munich]], developed an Internet-based database, the [http://www.infochem.de/products/databases/czb.shtml ''Chemisches Zentralblatt'' Structural Database]. This database provides access to the chemical content within the ''Chemisches Zentralblatt'' by performing [[chemical structure]] and substructure searches.

There has been contested view with regard to the position of  the local [[community]] on their resources that surrounds their vicinity. Most people urge that the local community's perceptions and aspirations has to be taken on board in the course of [[Natural resource management|planning and managing]] the resources that are close to their surroundings from which they acquire their day to day livelihood means.According to &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Logomo|title=Community perception of on farm trees and adjacent natural forest status under participatory management, Dodola District, Ethiopia|accessdate=2012|agency=Hawassa University Ethiopia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptions of the local community towards a given natural resource management programme is very essential and hence need not to be underestimated. Understanding of community perceptions is of paramount importance in natural resources management.Several studies stress the importance of using local people’s perceptions as an input for designing and applying appropriate management plans for [[sustainable development]], particularly in [[protected area]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleftoyanni|title=Environmental perceptions of students, farmers and other economically active members of the local population near the protected areas of [[Axios River|Axios]], [[Loudias (river)|Loudias]] and  Aliakmonas Estuaries in [[Greece]].|journal= Global NEST Journal|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developed from the earlier [[Geissler tube]], the Crookes tube consists of a partially [[vacuum|evacuated]] glass bulb of various shapes, with two metal [[electrodes]], the [[cathode]] and the [[anode]], one at either end. When a [[high voltage]] is applied between the electrodes, [[cathode ray]]s ([[electron]]s) are projected in straight lines from the cathode. It was used by Crookes, [[Johann Hittorf]], [[Julius Plücker]], [[Eugen Goldstein]], [[Heinrich Hertz]], [[Philipp Lenard]], [[Kristian Birkeland]] and others to discover the properties of cathode rays, culminating in [[J.J. Thomson]]'s 1897 identification of cathode rays as negatively charged particles, which were later named ''[[electron]]s''. Crookes tubes are now used only for demonstrating cathode rays.

[[Wilhelm Röntgen]] discovered [[X-ray]]s using the Crookes tube in 1895. The term ''Crookes tube'' is also used for the first generation, [[cold cathode]] [[X-ray tube]]s,&lt;ref&gt;''Mosby's Dental Dictionary'', 2nd ed., 2008, Elsevier, Inc. cited in {{cite encyclopedia

==How a Crookes tube works==
[[File:Crookes tube2 diagram.svg|thumb|Diagram showing a Crookes tube circuit.]]

Crookes tubes are [[cold cathode]] tubes, meaning that they do not have a heated [[electrical filament|filament]] in them that releases [[electron]]s as the later electronic [[vacuum tube]]s usually do. Instead, electrons are generated by the [[ionization]] of the residual air by a high [[direct current|DC]] [[voltage]] (from a few [[kilovolts]] to about 100 kilovolts) applied between the [[cathode]] and [[anode]] electrodes in the tube, usually by an [[induction coil]] (a "Ruhmkorff coil"). The Crookes tubes require a small amount of air in them to function, from about 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; to 5×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; [[atm (unit)|atmosphere]] (7×10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; - 4×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; [[Torr (unit)|torr]] or 0.1-0.005 [[Pascal (unit)|pascal]]).

When high [[voltage]] is applied to the tube, the [[electric field]] accelerates the small number of electrically charged [[ion]]s and free [[electron]]s always present in the gas, created by natural processes like [[photoionization]] and [[radioactivity]]. The electrons collide with other gas [[molecule]]s, knocking electrons off them and creating more positive ions.  The electrons go on to create more ions and electrons in a chain reaction called a [[Townsend discharge]]. All the positive ions are attracted to the [[cathode]] or negative electrode. When they strike it, they knock large numbers of electrons out of the surface of the metal, which in turn are repelled by the cathode and attracted to the [[anode]] or positive electrode. These are the [[cathode ray]]s.

Enough of the air has been removed from the tube that most of the electrons can travel the length of the tube without striking a gas molecule. The high voltage accelerates these low-mass particles to a high velocity (about 37,000 miles per second, or 59,000&amp;nbsp;km/s, about 20 percent of the [[speed of light]], for a typical tube voltage of 10&amp;nbsp;kV&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn= }}, Table 27&lt;/ref&gt;). When they get to the anode end of the tube, they have so much [[momentum]] that, although they are attracted to the anode, many fly past it and strike the end wall of the tube.  When they strike atoms in the glass, they knock their [[Atomic orbital|orbital electrons]] into a higher [[energy level]]. When the electrons fall back to their original energy level, they emit light. This process, called [[fluorescence]], causes the glass to glow, usually yellow-green. The electrons themselves are invisible, but the glow reveals where the beam of electrons strikes the glass. Later on, researchers painted the inside back wall of the tube  with a [[phosphor]], a fluorescent chemical such as [[zinc sulfide]], in order to make the glow more visible. After striking the wall, the electrons eventually make their way to the anode, flow through the anode wire, the power supply, and back to the cathode.

The above only describes the motion of the electrons. The full details of the action in a Crookes tube are complicated, because it contains a nonequilibrium [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of positively charged [[ion]]s, [[electron]]s, and neutral [[atom]]s which are constantly interacting. At higher gas pressures, above 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; atm (0.1 Pa), this creates a [[glow discharge]]; a pattern of different colored glowing regions in the gas, depending on the pressure in the tube (see diagram). The details were not fully understood until the development of [[plasma physics]] in the early 20th century.

==History==
Crookes tubes evolved from the earlier [[Geissler tube]]s, experimental tubes which are similar to modern [[neon lighting#Neon tube lighting and signs|neon tube lights]]. Geissler tubes had only a low vacuum, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; [[atm (unit)|atm]] (100 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

So the current of electrons moved in a slow [[diffusion]] process, constantly colliding with gas molecules, never gaining much energy. These tubes did not create beams of cathode rays, only a colorful [[glow discharge]] that filled the tube as the electrons struck the gas molecules and excited them, producing light.

[[File:Sir William Crookes 1902.jpg|thumb|left|Crookes and his glowing tubes gained renown, as shown by this 1902 caricature in ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''. The caption read "ubi Crookes ibi lux", which in Latin means roughly, "Where there is Crookes, there is light".]]

By the 1870s, Crookes (among other researchers) was able to evacuate his tubes to a lower pressure, 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; to 5x10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; [[atm (unit)|atm]], using an improved Sprengel mercury [[vacuum pump]] invented by his coworker Charles A. Gimingham. He found that as he pumped more air out of his tubes, a dark area in the glowing gas formed next to the cathode. As the pressure got lower, the dark area, now called the ''Crookes dark space'', spread down the tube, until the inside of the tube was totally dark. However, the glass envelope of the tube began to glow at the anode end.

What was happening was that as more air was pumped out of the tube, there were fewer gas molecules to obstruct the motion of the electrons from the cathode, so they could travel a longer distance, on average, before they struck one. By the time the inside of the tube became dark, they were able to travel in straight lines from the cathode to the anode, without a collision. They were accelerated to a high velocity by the electric field between the electrodes, both because they did not lose energy to collisions, and also because Crookes tubes were operated at a higher [[voltage]]. By the time they reached the anode end of the tube, they were going so fast that many flew past the anode and hit the glass wall. The electrons themselves were invisible, but when they hit the glass walls of the tube they excited the atoms in the glass, making them give off light or [[fluoresce]], usually yellow-green.  Later experimenters painted the back wall of Crookes tubes with fluorescent paint, to make the beams more visible.

This accidental fluorescence allowed researchers to notice that objects in the tube, such as the anode, cast a sharp-edged shadow on the tube wall. [[Johann Hittorf]] was first to recognise in 1869 that something must be travelling in straight lines from the cathode to cast the shadow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

At the time, atoms were the smallest particles known, the electron was unknown, and what carried [[electric current]]s was a mystery. Many ingenious types of Crookes tubes were built to determine the properties of cathode rays (see below). The high energy beams of pure electrons in the tubes revealed their properties much better than electrons flowing in wires. The colorful glowing tubes were also popular in public lectures to demonstrate the mysteries of the new science of electricity. Decorative tubes were made with fluorescent minerals, or butterfly figures painted with fluorescent paint, sealed inside. When power was applied, the fluorescent materials lit up with many glowing colors.

In 1895, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] discovered [[X-ray]]s emanating from Crookes tubes. The many uses for X-rays were immediately apparent, the first practical application for Crookes tubes.  Medical manufacturers began to produce specialized Crookes tubes to generate X-rays, the first [[X-ray tube]]s. 

Crookes tubes were unreliable and temperamental. Both the energy and the quantity of cathode rays produced depended on the pressure of residual gas in the tube.&lt;ref name="Kaye"&gt;{{cite book

Eventually the pressure got so low the tube stopped working entirely.&lt;ref name="VanDerPlaats" /&gt; To prevent this, in heavily used tubes such as X-ray tubes various "softener" devices were incorporated that released a small amount of gas, restoring the tube's function.&lt;ref name="Kaye" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Crowther" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VanDerPlaats" /&gt;

The electronic [[vacuum tube]]s invented later around 1906 superseded the Crookes tube. These operate at a still lower pressure, around 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; atm (10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; Pa), at which there are so few gas molecules that they do not conduct by [[ionization]]. Instead, they use a more reliable and controllable source of electrons, a heated filament or [[hot cathode]] which releases electrons by [[thermionic emission]]. The ionization method of creating cathode rays used in Crookes tubes is today only used in a few specialized [[gas discharge tube]]s such as [[thyratron]]s.

The technology of manipulating [[electron beam]]s pioneered in Crookes tubes was applied practically in the design of vacuum tubes, and particularly in the invention of the [[cathode ray tube]] by [[Ferdinand Braun]] in 1897.

==The discovery of X-rays==
[[File:Cosser Crookes xray tube.jpg|thumb|240px|Crookes X-ray tube from around 1910.]]
[[File:X-ray tube 2.jpg|thumb|Another Crookes x-ray tube.  The device attached to the neck of the tube ''(right)'' is an "osmotic softener".]]
When the voltage applied to a Crookes tube is high enough, around 5,000 [[volt]]s or greater,&lt;ref&gt;The energy and penetrating ability of the x-rays increases with the voltage on the tube.  Tubes with voltages below 5,000 V also create x-rays, but they are "soft" enough that very few penetrate the glass envelope of the tube.&lt;/ref&gt; it can accelerate the electrons to a high enough velocity to create [[X-rays]] when they hit the anode or the glass wall of the tube. The fast electrons emit X-rays when their path is bent sharply as they pass near the high electric charge of an atom's [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]], a process called [[bremsstrahlung]], or they knock an atom's inner electrons into a higher [[energy level]], and these in turn emit X-rays as they return to their former energy level, a process called [[X-ray fluorescence]]. Many early Crookes tubes undoubtedly generated X-rays, because early researchers such as [[Ivan Pulyui]] had noticed that they could make foggy marks on nearby unexposed [[photographic plate]]s. On November 8, 1895, [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] was operating a Crookes tube covered with black cardboard when he noticed that a nearby fluorescent screen glowed faintly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This is a likely reconstruction by his biographers.&lt;/ref&gt; He realized that some unknown invisible rays from the tube were able to pass through the cardboard and make the screen fluoresce. He found that they could pass through books and papers on his desk. Röntgen began to investigate the rays full-time, and on December 28, 1895, published the first scientific research paper on X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

was awarded the first [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] (in 1901) for his discoveries.

The many applications of X-rays created the first practical use for Crookes tubes, and workshops began manufacturing specialized Crookes tubes to generate X-rays, the first X-ray tubes. The anode was made of a heavy metal, usually [[platinum]], which generated more X-rays, and was tilted at an angle to the cathode, so the X-rays would radiate through the side of the tube. The cathode had a concave spherical surface which focused the electrons into a small spot around 1&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter on the anode, in order to approximate a point source of X-rays, which gave the sharpest [[radiograph]]s. These cold cathode type X-ray tubes were used until about 1920, when they were superseded by the [[hot cathode]] Coolidge X-ray tube.

==Experiments with Crookes tubes==

During the last quarter of the 19th century Crookes tubes were used in dozens of historic experiments to try to find out what cathode rays were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Brona | first=Grzegorz | title=The Cathode Rays | work=Atom - The Incredible World | publisher= | url=http://library.thinkquest.org/19662/high/eng/cathoderays.html | doi= | accessdate=2008-09-27 | display-authors=etal | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211185645/http://library.thinkquest.org/19662/high/eng/cathoderays.html | archivedate=2009-02-11 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were two theories: British scientists Crookes and Cromwell Varley believed they were particles of 'radiant matter', that is, electrically charged [[atoms]]. German researchers E. Wiedemann, [[Heinrich Hertz]], and [[Eugen Goldstein]] believed they were '[[Luminiferous aether|aether]] vibrations', some new form of [[electromagnetic wave]]s, and were separate from what carried the current through the tube.&lt;ref&gt;Pais, 1986, pp. 79-81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 1903, pp. 189-190.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate continued until [[J.J. Thomson]] measured their mass, proving they were a previously unknown negatively charged particle, the first [[subatomic particle]],  which he called a 'corpuscle' but was later renamed the 'electron'.

===Maltese cross===
[[Julius Plücker]] in 1869 built an anode shaped like a [[Maltese Cross]] in the tube. It was hinged, so it could fold down against the floor of the tube. When the tube was turned on, it cast a sharp cross-shaped shadow on the fluorescence on the back face of the tube, showing that the rays moved in straight lines.  This fluorescence was used as an argument that cathode rays were electromagnetic waves, since the only thing known to cause fluorescence at the time was [[ultraviolet]] light.   After a while the fluorescence would get 'tired' and decrease. If the cross was folded down out of the path of the rays, it no longer cast a shadow, and the previously shadowed area would fluoresce more strongly than the area around it.
{{breakafterimages}}

===Perpendicular emission===
[[File:Crookes tube for heating 1879.png|thumb|upright=0.4|Crookes tube with concave cathode]]
[[Eugen Goldstein]] in 1876 found&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein E. (1876). ''Monat der Berl. Akad''., p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt; that cathode rays were always emitted perpendicular to the cathode's surface.&lt;ref name=Thomson/&gt; If the cathode was a flat plate, the rays were shot out in straight lines perpendicular to the plane of the plate. This was evidence that they were particles, because a luminous object, like a red hot metal plate, emits light in all directions, while a charged particle will be repelled by the cathode in a perpendicular direction. If the electrode was made in the form of a concave spherical dish, the cathode rays would be focused to a spot in front of the dish. This could be used to heat samples to a high temperature.

===Deflection by electric fields===
[[Heinrich Hertz]] built a tube with a second pair of metal plates to either side of the cathode ray beam, a crude [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]]. If the cathode rays were [[charged particle]]s, their path should be bent by the [[electric field]] created when a [[voltage]] was applied to the plates, causing the spot of light where the rays hit to move sideways. He did not find any bending, but it was later determined that his tube was insufficiently evacuated, causing accumulations of [[surface charge]] which masked the electric field. Later Arthur Shuster repeated the experiment with a higher vacuum. He found that the rays were attracted toward a positively charged plate and repelled by a negative one, bending the beam. This was evidence they were negatively charged, and therefore not electromagnetic waves.
{{breakafterimages}}

===Deflection by magnetic fields===
[[File:Crookes magnetic deflection tube.png|thumb|Crookes magnetic deflection tube.]]
[[Image:Ampola de Crookes.gif|thumb|Deflection of electron beam with bar magnet]]
Crookes put a [[magnet]] across the neck of the tube, so that the North pole was on one side of the beam and the South pole was on the other, and the beam travelled through the [[magnetic field]] between them. The beam was bent down, perpendicular to the magnetic field. This effect (now called the [[Lorentz force]]) was similar to the behaviour of electric currents in an [[electric motor]] and showed that the cathode rays obeyed [[Faraday's law of induction]] like currents in wires.  Both electric and magnetic deflection were evidence for the particle theory, because electric and magnetic fields have no effect on a beam of light waves.
{{breakafterimages}}

===Paddlewheel===
[[File:Crookes paddlewheel tube.png|thumb|Crookes' paddlewheel tube, from his 1879 paper ''On Radiant Matter'']]
Crookes put a tiny vaned [[turbine]] or [[paddlewheel]] in the path of the cathode rays, and found that it rotated when the rays hit it. The paddlewheel turned in a direction away from the cathode side of the tube, suggesting that the force of the cathode rays striking the paddles was causing the rotation. Crookes concluded at the time that this showed that cathode rays had [[momentum]], so the rays were likely [[matter]] particles.  However, later it was concluded that the paddle wheel turned not due to the momentum of the particles (or electrons) hitting the paddle wheel but due to the [[Crookes radiometer|radiometric effect]].  When the rays hit the paddle surface they heated it, and the heat caused the gas next to it to expand, pushing the paddle.  This was proven in 1903 by [[J. J. Thomson]] who calculated that the momentum of the electrons hitting the paddle wheel would only be sufficient to turn the wheel one revolution per minute.  All this experiment really showed was that cathode rays were able to heat surfaces.

===Charge===
[[Jean-Baptiste Perrin]] wanted to determine whether the cathode rays actually carried negative [[Electric charge|charge]], or whether they just accompanied the charge carriers, as the Germans thought. In 1895 he constructed a tube with a 'catcher', a closed aluminum cylinder with a small hole in the end facing the cathode, to collect the cathode rays. The catcher was attached to an [[electroscope]] to measure its charge. The electroscope showed a negative charge, proving that cathode rays really carry negative electricity.

===Anode rays===
[[Image:Anode Ray Tube.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Special tube with perforated cathode, producing anode rays ''(top, pink)'']]
Goldstein found in 1886 that if the cathode is made with small holes in it, streams of a faint luminous glow will be seen issuing from the holes on the back side of the cathode, facing away from the anode.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstein E. (1886) Berliner Sitzungsberichte, 39, p.391&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomson 1903, p.158-159&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that in an electric field these [[anode ray]]s bend in the opposite direction from cathode rays, toward a negatively charged plate, indicating that they carry a positive charge. These were the positive [[ion]]s which were attracted to the cathode, and created the cathode rays. They were named ''canal rays'' (''Kanalstrahlen'') by Goldstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = | title = Concept review Ch.41 Electric Current through Gasses | work = Learning Physics for IIT JEE | publisher = | year = 2008 | url = http://iit-jee-physics.blogspot.com/2008/03/concept-review-ch41-electric-current.html | doi = | accessdate = 2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{breakafterimages}}

===Doppler shift===
[[Eugen Goldstein]] thought he had figured out a method of measuring the speed of cathode rays. If the [[glow discharge]] seen in the gas of Crookes tubes was produced by the moving cathode rays, the light radiated from them in the direction they were moving, down the tube, would be shifted in [[frequency]] due to the [[Doppler effect]]. This could be detected with a [[spectroscope]] because the [[emission line]] [[spectrum]] would be shifted. He built a tube shaped like an "L", with a spectroscope pointed through the glass of the elbow down one of the arms. He measured the spectrum of the glow when the spectroscope was pointed toward the cathode end, then switched the power supply connections so the cathode became the anode and the electrons were moving in the other direction, and again observed the spectrum looking for a shift. He did not find one, which he calculated meant that the rays were traveling very slowly. It is now recognized that the glow in Crookes tubes is emitted from gas atoms hit by the electrons, not the electrons themselves. Since the atoms are thousands of times more massive than the electrons, they move much slower, accounting for the lack of Doppler shift.

===Lenard window===
[[Image:Lenard window tube labeled.png|thumb|Lenard tube ]]
[[Philipp Lenard]] wanted to see if cathode rays could pass out of the Crookes tube into the air.  See diagram.  He built a tube with a "window" ''(W)'' in the glass envelope made of [[aluminum foil]] just thick enough to hold the atmospheric pressure out (later called a "Lenard window") facing the cathode ''(C)'' so the cathode rays would hit it. He found that something did come through. Holding a fluorescent screen up to the window caused it to fluoresce, even though no light reached it. A [[photographic plate]] held up to it would be darkened, even though it was not exposed to light. The effect had a very short range of about {{convert|2.5|cm|in|2}}. He measured the ability of cathode rays to penetrate sheets of material, and found they could penetrate much farther than moving atoms could. Since atoms were the smallest particles known at the time, this was first taken as evidence that cathode rays were waves. Later it was realized that electrons were much smaller than atoms, accounting for their greater penetration ability. Lenard was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1905 for his work.

'''Developmental psychology''' is the [[scientific]] study of how and why [[human]] beings change over the course of their life. Originally concerned with [[infants]] and [[child]]ren, the field has expanded to include [[adolescence]], [[adult development]], [[aging]], and the entire lifespan. Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life.  This field examines change across three major dimensions: [[physical development]], [[cognitive development]], and socioemotional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/action/science/developmental/index.aspx|title=Developmental Psychology Studies Human Development Across the Lifespan|last=|first=|date=|website=www.apa.org|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709054242/http://www.apa.org/action/science/developmental/index.aspx|archive-date=2014-07-09|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including [[motor skills]], [[executive functions]], [[morality|moral understanding]], [[language acquisition]], [[social change]], [[personality]], emotional development, [[self-concept]], and [[identity formation]].

Developmental psychology examines the influences of nature ''and'' nurture on the process of human development, and processes of change in context and across time. Many researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics, the individual's behavior, and [[environmental factor]]s, including the [[social context]] and the [[built environment]]. Ongoing debates include biological [[essentialism]] vs. [[neuroplasticity]] and [[Developmental stage theories|stages of development]] vs. dynamic systems of development.

Developmental psychology involves a range of fields, such as [[educational psychology]], [[child psychopathology]], [[forensic developmental psychology]], [[child development]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[ecological psychology]], and [[cultural psychology]]. Influential developmental psychologists from the 20th century include [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], [[Erik Erikson]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Barbara Rogoff]], [[Esther Thelen]], and [[Lev Vygotsky]].

==Historical antecedents==
[[John B. Watson]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] are typically cited as providing the foundations for modern developmental psychology.&lt;ref name=Hogan&gt;{{cite book|last=Hogan|first=John D|authorlink=John D. Hogan|title=Encyclopedia of Psychology|location=Volume 3|isbn=978-1-55798-652-8|pages=9–13|chapter=Developmental psychology: History of the field|editor=Alan E. Kazdin|editor-link=Alan E. Kazdin|accessdate=|doi=10.1037/10518-003|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-18th century Jean Jacques Rousseau described three stages of development: ''infants'' (infancy), ''puer'' (childhood) and ''adolescence'' in ''[[Emile: Or, On Education]]''. Rousseau's ideas were taken up strongly by educators at the time.

It generally focuses on how and why certain modifications throughout an individual’s life-cycle (cognitive, social, intellectual, personality) and human growth change over time. There are many theorists that have made a profound contribution to this area of psychology. For example, [[Erik Erikson]] developed a model of eight stages of psychological development. He believed that humans developed in stages throughout their lifetimes and this would affect their behaviors (Similar ideas to [[Sigmund Freud]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erikson and Erikson|first1=E and J. M.|title=The Life-Cycle Completed|date=1998|publisher=Norton and Company|edition=Extended version}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, psychologists familiar with the [[evolutionary theory]] of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] began seeking an evolutionary description of psychological development;&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; prominent here was the pioneering psychologist [[G. Stanley Hall]],&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; who attempted to correlate ages of childhood with previous ages of humanity. [[James Mark Baldwin]] who wrote essays on topics that included ''Imitation: A Chapter in the Natural History of Consciousness'' and ''Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes''. [[James Mark Baldwin]] was heavily involved in the theory of developmental psychology.&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]], whose concepts were developmental, significantly affected public perceptions.&lt;ref name=Hogan /&gt;

==Theories==

===Psychosexual development===
{{Main|Psychosexual development}}
[[Sigmund Freud]] believed that we all had a conscious, preconscious, and unconscious level. In the conscious, we are aware of our mental process. The preconscious involves information that, though not currently in our thoughts, can be brought into consciousness. Lastly, the unconscious includes mental processes we are unaware of.

He believed there is tension between the conscious and unconscious because the conscious tries to hold back what the unconscious tries to express. To explain this he developed three personality structures: the id, ego, and superego. The id, the most primitive of the three, functions according to the pleasure principle: seek pleasure and avoid pain.&lt;ref name="Theories2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Theories of personality: understanding persons|last=Cloninger|first=Susan C.|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=978-0-205-25624-2|edition=6th|location=Boston|pages=19–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superego plays the critical and moralizing role; and the ego is the organized, realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the superego.&lt;ref name="Snowden2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Teach Yourself Freud|last=Snowden|first=Ruth|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-07-147274-6|pages=105–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this, he proposed five universal stages of development, that each is characterized by the erogenous zone that is the source of the child's psychosexual energy. The first is the ''oral stage'', which occurs from birth to 12 months of age. During the oral stage, "the libido is centered in a baby's mouth." The baby is able to suck. The second is the ''anal stage'', from one to three years of age. During the anal stage, the child defecates from the anus and is often fascinated with their defecation. The third is the ''[[phallic stage]]'', which occurs from three to five years of age (most of a person's personality forms by this age). During the phallic stage, the child is aware of their sexual organs. The fourth is the ''latency stage'', which occurs from age five until puberty. During the latency stage, the child's sexual interests are repressed. Stage five is the ''[[genital stage]]'', which takes place from puberty until adulthood. During the genital stage, puberty starts happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/psychosexual.html|title=Psychosexual Stages|website=SimplyPsychology|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of cognitive development===
{{Main|Piaget's theory of cognitive development}}
[[Jean Piaget]], a Swiss theorist, posited that children learn by actively constructing knowledge through hands-on experience.&lt;ref name="WoodWoodBoyd2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mastering the world of psychology|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|year=2006|edition=2|author1=Wood, S.E.|author2=Wood, C.E.|author3=Boyd D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that the adult's role in helping the child learn was to provide appropriate materials that the child can interact with and use to construct. He used [[Socratic questioning]] to get children to reflect on what they were doing, and he tried to get them to see contradictions in their explanations.

Piaget believed that intellectual development takes place through a series of stages, which he described in his theory on cognitive development. Each stage consists of steps the child must master before moving to the next step. He believed that these stages are not separate from one another, but rather that each stage builds on the previous one in a continuous learning process. He proposed four stages: ''sensorimotor'', ''pre-operational'', ''concrete operational'', and ''formal operational''. Though he did not believe these stages occurred at any given age, many studies have determined when these cognitive abilities should take place.&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"&gt;{{cite book|title=Edpsych : modules|last=Reese-Weber|first=Lisa Bohlin, Cheryl Cisero Durwin, Marla|publisher=McGraw-Hill Humanities/Social Sciences/Languages|isbn=978-0-07-809786-7|edition=2nd|location=New York|pages=30–132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of moral development===
{{Main|Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development}}
Piaget claimed that logic and morality develop through constructive stages.&lt;ref name="higheststage2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|year=1973|title=The Claim to Moral Adequacy of a Highest Stage of Moral Judgment|journal=Journal of Philosophy|publisher=The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. 70, No. 18|volume=70|issue=18|pages=630–646|doi=10.2307/2025030|jstor=2025030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding on Piaget's work, [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] determined that the process of moral development was principally concerned with justice, and that it continued throughout the individual's lifetime.&lt;ref name="dissertation2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kohlberg|first=Lawrence|year=1958|title=The Development of Modes of Thinking and Choices in Years 10 to 16|journal=Ph. D. Dissertation, University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He suggested three levels of moral reasoning; pre-conventional moral reasoning, conventional moral reasoning, and post-conventional moral reasoning.  The pre-conventional moral reasoning is typical of children and is characterized by reasoning that is based on rewards and punishments associated with different courses of action. Conventional moral reason occurs during late childhood and early adolescence and is characterized by reasoning based on rules and conventions of society. Lastly, post-conventional moral reasoning is a stage during which the individual sees society's rules and conventions as relative and subjective, rather than as authoritative.&lt;ref name="Adolescence3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Adolescence|last=Steinberg|first=Laurence|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=2008|isbn=978-0-07-340548-3|edition=8th|location=Boston|pages=60–365|authorlink=Laurence Steinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kohlberg used the Heinz Dilemma to apply to his stages of moral development. The Heinz Dilemma involves Heinz's wife dying from cancer and Heinz having the dilemma to save his wife by stealing a drug. Preconventional morality, conventional morality, and post-conventional morality applies to Heinz's situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/kohlberg.html|title=Kohlberg|website=SimplyPsychology|last1=McLeod|first1=Saul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages of psychosocial development===
{{Main|Erikson's stages of psychosocial development}}
German-American psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] and his collaborator and wife, [[Joan Erikson]], conceptualized eight stages of psychosocial development that they theorized healthy individuals pass through as they develop from infancy to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Thomas|first=Robert McG., Jr.|title=Joan Erikson Is Dead at 95; Shaped Thought on Life Cycles|date=8 August 1997|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/08/08/us/joan-erikson-is-dead-at-95-shaped-thought-on-life-cycles.html|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=23 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first stage is called "Trust vs. Mistrust" takes place in infancy. The best virtue for the first stage is hope, in the infant learning who to trust and having hope for a supportive group of people to be there for him/her. The second stage is "Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt" with the best virtue being will. This takes place in early childhood where the child learns to become more independent by discovering what they are capable of where if the child is overly controlled, they believe to feel inadequate on surviving by themselves, which can lead to low self-esteem and doubt. The third stage is "Initiative vs. Guilt". The basic virtue that would be gained is the purpose and takes place in the play age. This is the stage where the child will be curious and have many interactions with other kids. They will ask many questions as their curiosity grows. If too much guilt is present, the child may have a slower and harder time interacting with other children. The fourth stage is "Industry (competence) vs. Inferiority". The basic virtue for this stage is competency which happens at the school age. This stage is when the child will try to win the approval of others and fit in and understand the value of their accomplishments. The fifth stage is "Identity vs. Role Confusion". The basic virtue gained is fidelity which takes place in adolescence. This is where the child will start to find who he/she is as a person in society. What sex role he/she picks. The sixth stage is "Intimacy vs. Isolation", which happens in young adults and the virtue gained is love. This is where the person will start to share his/her life with someone else intimately and emotionally. In not doing so, it could lead to isolation. The seventh stage is "Generativity vs. Stagnation". This happens in adulthood and the virtue gained would be care. We become stable and start to give back by raising a family and becoming involved in the community. The eighth stage is "Ego Integrity vs. Despair". This happens during maturity and wisdom is gained. When one grows old and they contemplate and look back and see the success or failure of their life. This is also the stage where one can also have closure and accept death without fearing anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=McLeod|first=Saul|title=Erik Erikson|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/Erik-Erikson.html|year=2013|accessdate=23 July 2016|orig-year=2008|website=Simply Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stages based on the model of hierarchical complexity===
{{Main|Model of hierarchical complexity}}
[[Michael Commons]] enhanced and simplified [[Bärbel Inhelder]] and Piaget's developmental theory and offers a standard method of examining the universal pattern of development. The Model of Hierarchical Complexity  (MHC) is not based on the assessment of domain-specific information, It divides the Order of Hierarchical Complexity of tasks to be addressed from the Stage performance on those tasks.  A stage is the order hierarchical complexity of the tasks the participant's successfully addresses. He expanded Piaget's original eight stage (counting the half stages) to fifteen stages. The stages are : 0 Calculatory; 1 Sensory &amp; Motor; 2 Circular sensory-motor; 3 Sensory-motor; 4 Nominal; 5 Sentential; 6 Preoperational; 7 Primary; 8 Concrete; 9 Abstract; 10 Formal; 11 Systematic; 12 Metasystematic; 13 Paradigmatic; 14 Cross-paradigmatic; 15 Meta-Cross-paradigmatic. The order of hierarchical complexity of tasks predicts how difficult the performance is with an R ranging from 0.9 to 0.98.

In the MHC, there are three main axioms for an order to meet in order for the higher order task to coordinate the next lower order task. Axioms are rules that are followed to determine how the MHC orders actions to form a hierarchy. These axioms are: a) defined in terms of tasks at the next lower order of hierarchical complexity task action; b) defined as the higher order task action that organizes two or more less complex actions; that is, the more complex action specifies the way in which the less complex actions combine; c) defined as the lower order task actions have to be carried out non-arbitrarily.

===Ecological systems theory===
{{Main|Ecological systems theory}}
[[File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bronfenbrenner's_Ecological_Theory_of_Development_(English).jpg|right|thumb|180x180px|{{center|Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory}}]]
Ecological systems theory, originally formulated by [[Urie Bronfenbrenner]], specifies four types of nested environmental systems, with bi-directional influences within and between the systems. The four systems are microsystem, mesosystem, exosystem, and macrosystem. Each system contains roles, norms and rules that can powerfully shape development. The microsystem is the direct environment in our lives such as our home and school. Mesosystem is how relationships connect to the microsystem. Exosystem is a larger social system where the child plays no role. Macrosystem refers to the cultural values, customs and laws of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://explorable.com/ecological-systems-theory|title=Ecological Systems Theory|website=Explorable Psychology Experiments|last1=Sincero|first1=Sarah Mae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The microsystem is the immediate environment surrounding and influencing the individual (example: school or the home setting). The mesosystem is the combination of two microsystems and how they influence each other (example: sibling relationships at home vs. peer relationships at school). The exosystem is the interaction among two or more settings that are indirectly linked (example: a father's job requiring more overtime ends up influencing his daughter's performance in school because he can no longer help with her homework). The macrosystem is broader taking into account social economic status, culture, beliefs, customs and morals (example: a child from a wealthier family sees a peer from a less wealthy family as inferior for that reason). Lastly, the chronosystem refers to the chronological nature of life events and how they interact and change the individual and their circumstances through transition (example: a mother losing her own mother to illness and no longer having that support in her life).&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"/&gt;

Since its publication in 1979, Bronfenbrenner's major statement of this theory, ''The Ecology of Human Development''&lt;ref&gt;Bronfenbrenner, U. (1979). ''The Ecology of Human Development: Experiments by Nature and Design''. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ({{ISBN|0-674-22457-4}})&lt;/ref&gt; has had widespread influence on the way psychologists and others approach the study of human beings and their environments. As a result of this conceptualization of development, these environments—from the family to economic and political structures—have come to be viewed as part of the life course from childhood through to adulthood.&lt;ref name="Smith et al.2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding Children's Development|publisher=Blackwell|edition=4|series=Basic psychology|location=Oxford, England|author1=Smith, P.K.|author2=Cowie, H.|author3=Blades, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zone of proximal development===
{{Main|Zone of proximal development}}
[[Lev Vygotsky]] was a Russian theorist from the Soviet era, who posited that children learn through hands-on experience and social interactions with members of his/her culture.&lt;ref&gt;Schacter, D. L., D. T. Gilbert, and D. M. Wegner. Psychology. 2. New York, NY: Worth Publishers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike Piaget, he claimed that timely and sensitive intervention by adults when a child is on the edge of learning a new task (called the "zone of proximal development") could help children learn new tasks. This adult role is often referred to as the skilled "master," whereas the child is considered the learning apprentice through an educational process often termed "[[cognitive apprenticeship]]" Martin Hill stated that "The world of reality does not apply to the mind of a child." This technique is called "scaffolding," because it builds upon knowledge children already have with new knowledge that adults can help the child learn.&lt;ref name="vygotsky782"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind in Society|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1978|location=Cambridge, MA|author=Vygotsky, L.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky was strongly focused on the role of culture in determining the child's pattern of development, arguing that development moves from the social level to the individual level.&lt;ref name="vygotsky782" /&gt; In other words, Vygotsky claimed that psychology should focus on the progress of human consciousness through the relationship of an individual and their environment.&lt;ref name="vygotsky20102"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Activity Systems Analysis Methods: Understanding Complex Learning Environments|publisher=Springer Science|year=2010|location=New York, NY|author=Yamagata-Lynch, L.C}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that if scholars continued to disregard this connection, then this disregard would inhibit the full comprehension of the human consciousness.&lt;ref name="vygotsky20102" /&gt;

===Constructivism===
{{Main|Constructivism (psychological school)}}
Constructivism is a paradigm in psychology that characterizes learning as a process of actively constructing knowledge. Individuals create meaning for themselves or make sense of new information by selecting, organizing, and integrating information with other knowledge, often in the context of social interactions.  Constructivism can occur in two ways: individual and social. Individual constructivism is when a person constructs knowledge through cognitive processes of their own experiences rather than by memorizing facts provided by others.  Social constructivism is when individuals construct knowledge through an interaction between the knowledge they bring to a situation and social or cultural exchanges within that content.&lt;ref name="Edpsych24"/&gt;

Jean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist, proposed that learning is an active process because children learn through experience and make mistakes and solve problems. Piaget proposed that learning should be whole by helping students understand that meaning is constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://viking.coe.uh.edu/~ichen/ebook/et-it/cognitiv.htm|title=Overview of Cognitive Constructivism|website=Cognitive Constructivist Theories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary developmental psychology===
{{Main|Evolutionary developmental psychology}}

Evolutionary developmental psychology is a research paradigm that applies the basic principles of Darwinian [[evolution]], particularly [[natural selection]], to understand the development of human behavior and cognition. It involves the study of both the [[Genetics|genetic]] and environmental mechanisms that underlie the development of social and [[cognitive]] competencies, as well as the [[epigenetic]] ([[gene-environment interaction]]s) processes that adapt these competencies to local conditions.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology|last2=Blasi|first2=Carlos Hernández|last3=Ellis|first3=Bruce J|isbn=978-1-118-75580-8|editor-link=|location=Volume 2|pages=905|chapter=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology|doi=|last1=Bjorklund|first1=David F|editor=David M. Buss|accessdate=|date=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EDP considers both the reliably developing, species-typical features of ontogeny (developmental adaptations), as well as [[Differential psychology|individual differences]] in behavior, from an evolutionary perspective. While evolutionary views tend to regard most individual differences as the result of either random genetic noise (evolutionary byproducts)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tooby|first=John|date=1990|title=On the universality of human nature and the uniqueness of the individual: The role of genetics and adaptation|url=http://www.psych.ucsb.edu/research/cep/papers/jpersonality.pdf|journal=Journal of Personality|volume=58|issue=1|pages=17–67|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1990.tb00907.x|pmid=2198338}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or idiosyncrasies (for example, peer groups, education, neighborhoods, and chance encounters)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The blank slate|last=Pinker|first=Steven|publisher=Penguin Books|year=2002|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=Chapter 19: Children}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than products of natural selection, EDP asserts that natural selection can favor the emergence of individual differences via "adaptive developmental plasticity."&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Developmental plasticity and evolution|last=West-Eberhard|first=Mary Jane|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this perspective, human development follows alternative life-history strategies in response to environmental variability, rather than following one species-typical pattern of development.&lt;ref name="Bjorklund et al. 20142" /&gt;

EDP is closely linked to the theoretical framework of [[evolutionary psychology]] (EP), but is also distinct from EP in several domains, including research emphasis (EDP focuses on adaptations of ontogeny, as opposed to adaptations of adulthood) and consideration of proximate ontogenetic and environmental factors (i.e., how development happens) in addition to more ultimate factors (i.e., why development happens), which are the focus of mainstream evolutionary psychology.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Carlos Hernandez|last2=Bjorklund|first2=David F.|date=2003|title=Evolutionary Developmental Psychology: A New Tool for Better Understanding Human Ontogeny|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Carlos_Blasi/publication/275042203_Evolutionary_Developmental_Psychology_A_new_tool_for_better_understanding_human_ontogeny/links/553132e10cf27acb0dea90ec.pdf|journal=Human Development|volume=46|issue=5|pages=259–281|doi=10.1159/000071935|pmid=|access-date=March 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attachment theory===
{{Main|Attachment theory}}
Attachment theory, originally developed by [[John Bowlby]], focuses on the importance of open, intimate, emotionally meaningful relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=x-Oki9MxalQC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA45|title=Attachment Theory: Social, Developmental, and Clinical Perspectives|last=Goldberg|first=Susan|last2=Muir|first2=Roy|last3=Kerr|first3=John|date=2013-04-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135890520}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment is described as a biological system or powerful survival impulse that evolved to ensure the survival of the infant. A child who is threatened or stressed will move toward caregivers who create a sense of physical, emotional and psychological safety for the individual. Attachment feeds on body contact and familiarity. Later [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed the [[Mary Ainsworth#Strange Situation|Strange Situation]] protocol and the concept of the secure base.

Theorists have proposed four types of attachment styles:&lt;ref name="Schacter4402"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology|last=Schacter, Gilbert, Wegner|publisher=Worth|year=2011|pages=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; secure, anxious-avoidant, anxious-resistant,&lt;ref name="Adolescence3"/&gt; and disorganized.&lt;ref name="Schacter4402" /&gt; Secure attachment is a healthy attachment between the infant and the caregiver. It is characterized by trust. Anxious-avoidant is an insecure attachment between an infant and a caregiver. This is characterized by the infant's indifference toward the caregiver. Anxious-resistant is an insecure attachment between the infant and the caregiver characterized by distress from the infant when separated and anger when reunited.&lt;ref name="Adolescence3" /&gt; Disorganized is an attachment style without a consistent pattern of responses upon return of the parent.&lt;ref name="Schacter4402" /&gt;

A child can be hindered in its natural tendency to form attachments. Some babies are raised without the stimulation and attention of a regular caregiver or locked away under conditions of abuse or extreme neglect. The possible short-term effects of this deprivation are anger, despair, detachment, and temporary delay in intellectual development. Long-term effects include increased aggression, clinging behavior, detachment, psychosomatic disorders, and an increased risk of depression as an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exploring Psychology|last=Myers|first=D.|publisher=Worth Publishers|year=2008|isbn=1-57259-096-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Level Psychology Through Diagrams|last=Hill|first=G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-918094-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2015}}

Attachment style can affect the relationships between people. Attachment is established in early childhood and attachment continues into adulthood. An example of secure attachment continuing in adulthood would be when the person feels confident and is able to meet their own needs. An example of anxious attachment during adulthood is when the adult chooses a partner with anxious-avoidant attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201307/how-your-attachment-style-impacts-your-relationship|title=How Your Attachment Style Impacts Your Relationship|website=Psychology Today|publisher=Compassion Matters|last1=Firestone|first1=Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major debates==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2017}}

===Nature vs nurture===
A significant issue in developmental psychology is the relationship between innateness and environmental influence in regard to any particular aspect of development. This is often referred to as "[[nature and nurture]]" or [[psychological nativism|nativism]] versus [[empiricism]]. A nativist account of development would argue that the processes in question are innate, that is, they are specified by the organism's [[genes]].

An empiricist perspective would argue that those processes are acquired in interaction with the environment. Today developmental psychologists rarely take such polarised positions with regard to most aspects of development; rather they investigate, among many other things, the relationship between innate and environmental influences. One of the ways this relationship has been explored in recent years is through the emerging field of [[evolutionary developmental psychology]].

One area where this innateness debate has been prominently portrayed is in research on [[language acquisition]]. A major question in this area is whether or not certain properties of human language are specified genetically or can be acquired through [[learning]]. The empiricist position on the issue of language acquisition suggests that the language input provides the necessary information required for learning the structure of language and that infants acquire language through a process of [[statistical learning]]. From this perspective, language can be acquired via general learning methods that also apply to other aspects of development, such as [[perceptual learning]].

The nativist position argues that the input from language is too impoverished for infants and children to acquire the structure of language. Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]] asserts that, evidenced by the lack of sufficient information in the language input, there is a [[universal grammar]] that applies to all human languages and is pre-specified. This has led to the idea that there is a special cognitive [[modularity of mind|module]] suited for learning language, often called the [[language acquisition device]]. Chomsky's critique of the behaviorist model of language acquisition is regarded by many as a key turning point in the decline in the prominence of the theory of behaviorism generally.&lt;ref name="Schlinger"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Schlinger, H.D. |year=2008 |title=The long good-bye: why B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior is alive and well on the 50th anniversary of its publication |journal=The Psychological Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Skinner's conception of "Verbal Behavior" has not died, perhaps in part because it has generated successful practical applications.&lt;ref name="Schlinger" /&gt;

===Continuity vs discontinuity===
Since theorists believe that development is a smooth, continuous process, individuals gradually add more of the same types of skills throughout their lives. Other theorists, however, think that development takes place in discontinuous stages. People change rapidly and step up to a new level, and then change very little for a while. With each new step, the person shows interest and responds to the world qualitatively.

===Stability vs change===
This issue involves the degree to which we become older renditions of our early experience or whether we develop into something different from who we were at an earlier point in development. It considers the extent to which early experiences ( especially infancy) or later experiences are the key determinants of a person's development.

Most lifespan developmentalists, recognise that extreme positions are unwise. Therefore, the key to a comprehensive understanding of development at any stage requires the ·interaction of different factors and not only one.

==Mechanisms of Development==
Developmental psychology is concerned not only with describing the characteristics of psychological change over time but also seeks to explain the principles and internal workings underlying these changes. Psychologists have attempted to better understand these factors by using [[model (abstract)|models]]. Developmental models are sometimes [[computer model|computational]], but they do not need to be.

A model must simply account for the means by which a process takes place. This is sometimes done in reference to changes in the [[human brain|brain]] that may correspond to changes in behavior over the course of the development. Computational accounts of development often use either [[symbol]]ic, [[connectionist]] ([[neural net]]work), or [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] models to explain the Mechanisms of Development.

==Research areas==

===Cognitive development===
{{Main|Cognitive development|Theory of cognitive development|Neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development}}
Cognitive development is primarily concerned with the ways that infants and children acquire, develop, and use internal mental capabilities such as: problem-solving, memory, and language. Major topics in cognitive development are the study of language acquisition and the development of perceptual and motor skills. Piaget was one of the influential early psychologists to study the development of cognitive abilities. His theory suggests that development proceeds through a set of stages from infancy to adulthood and that there is an end point or goal.

Other accounts, such as that of [[Lev Vygotsky]], have suggested that development does not progress through stages, but rather that the developmental process that begins at birth and continues until death is too complex for such structure and finality. Rather, from this viewpoint, developmental processes proceed more continuously. Thus, development should be analyzed, instead of treated as a product to obtain.

[[K. Warner Schaie]] has expanded the study of cognitive development into adulthood.  Rather than being stable from adolescence, Schaie sees adults as progressing in the application of their cognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;Schaie, K. W. (1990). Intellectual development in adulthood. In J. E. Birren &amp; K. W. Schaie (Eds.), Handbook of the psychology of aging, 3rd ed., (pp. 291-309). New York: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cognitive development has integrated the considerations of [[cognitive psychology]] and the psychology of [[individual differences]] into the interpretation and modeling of development.&lt;ref name="demetriou"&gt;Demetriou, A. (1998). Cognitive development. In A. Demetriou, W. Doise, K.F.M. van Lieshout (Eds.), ''Life-span developmental psychology'' (pp. 179–269). London: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]] showed that the successive levels or stages of cognitive development are associated with increasing processing efficiency and [[working memory]] capacity. These increases explain differences between stages, progression to higher stages, and individual differences of children who are the same-age and of the same grade-level. However, other theories have moved away from Piagetian stage theories, and are influenced by accounts of [[domain-specific]] information processing, which posit that development is guided by innate evolutionarily-specified and content-specific information processing mechanisms.

===Social and emotional development===
{{Main|Social-emotional development in childhood|Social psychology}}
Developmental psychologists who are interested in social development examine how individuals develop social and emotional competencies. For example, they study how children form friendships, how they understand and deal with emotions, and how identity develops. Research in this area may involve study of the relationship between cognition or cognitive development and social behavior.

[[Emotional self-regulation|Emotional regulation]] or ER refers to an individual's ability to modulate emotional responses across a variety of contexts. In young children, this modulation is in part controlled externally, by parents and other authority figures. As children develop, they take on more and more responsibility for their internal state. Studies have shown that the development of ER is affected by the emotional regulation children observe in parents and caretakers, the emotional climate in the home, and the reaction of parents and caretakers to the child's emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Amanda Morris et al. (2009) National Institute of Health. "The Role of the Family Context in Development of Emotion Regulation." pp 1-36 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/PSYCH305-11.2.pdf] Retrieved May 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Music also has an influence on stimulating and enhancing the senses of a child through self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;Oaklander, Violet. (2006) Hidden Treasure : A Map to the Child's Inner Self. London,   Karnac Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

A child's social and emotional development can be disrupted by motor coordination problems as evidenced by the environmental stress hypothesis.  The environmental hypothesis explains how children with coordination problems and [[developmental coordination disorder]] are exposed to several psychosocial consequences which act as secondary stressors, leading to an increase in [[Internalizing disorder|internalizing symptoms]] such as depression and anxiety.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cairney|first1=John|last2=Veldhuizen|first2=Scott|last3=Szatmari|first3=Peter|title=Motor coordination and emotional-behavioral problems in children|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|date=2010|volume=23|pages=324–329|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e32833aa0aa}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motor coordination problems affect fine and gross motor movement as well as perceptual-motor skills.  Secondary stressors commonly identified include the tendency for children with poor motor skills to be less likely to participate in organized play with other children and more likely to feel socially isolated.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Social and emotional development focuses on 5 keys areas: Self-Awareness, Self Management, Social Awareness, Relationship Skills and Responsible Decision Making.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SEL Competencies|url = http://www.casel.org/social-and-emotional-learning/core-competencies|website = CASEL|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical development===
Physical development concerns the physical maturation of an individual's body until it reaches the adult stature. Although physical growth is a highly regular process, all children differ tremendously in the timing of their growth spurts.&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;Eaton, Warren. "Physical Maturation", University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada. Retrieved on 2012-03-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Studies are being done to analyze how the differences in these timings affect and are related to other variables of developmental psychology such as information processing speed. Traditional measures of physical maturity using x-rays are less in practice nowadays, compared to simple measurements of body parts such as height, weight, head circumference, and arm span.&lt;ref name="Eaton" /&gt;

A few other studies and practices with physical developmental psychology are the phonological abilities of mature 5- to 11-year-olds, and the controversial hypotheses of left-handers being maturationally delayed compared to right-handers. A study by Eaton, Chipperfield, Ritchot, and Kostiuk in 1996 found in three different samples that there was no difference between right- and left-handers.&lt;ref name="Eaton" /&gt;

===Memory development===
Researchers interested in memory development look at the way our memory develops from childhood and onward. According to [[Fuzzy-trace theory]], we have two separate memory processes: verbatim and gist. These two traces begin to develop at different times as well as at a different pace. Children as young as 4 years-old have verbatim memory, memory for surface information, which increases up to early adulthood, at which point it begins to decline. On the other hand, our capacity for gist memory, memory for semantic information, increases up to early adulthood, at which point it is consistent through old age. Furthermore, our reliance on gist memory traces increases as we age.&lt;ref name="Fuzzy-trace theory and children's false memories"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brainerd|first=C.J.|author2=Reyna, V.F.|title=Fuzzy-trace theory and children's false memories|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|year=1998|volume=71|issue=2|pages=81–129|doi=10.1006/jcep.1998.2464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research methods and designs==

===Main research methods===
Developmental psychology employs many of the [[psychological research methods|research methods]] used in other areas of psychology. However, infants and children cannot be tested in the same ways as adults, so different methods are often used to study their development.

Developmental psychologists have a number of methods to study changes in individuals over time. Common research methods include systematic observation, including [[naturalistic observation]] or structured observation; self-reports, which could be clinical interviews or [[structured interviews]]; clinical or [[case study]] method; and [[ethnography]] or participant observation.&lt;ref name=Berk&gt;{{cite book |title=Infants and children: Prenatal through middle childhood |author=Laura E. Berk |edition=7 |year=2012 |publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31–35}} These methods differ in the extent of control researchers impose on study conditions, and how they construct ideas about which variables to study.&lt;ref name=Bruning&gt;{{cite book|last=Bruning|first=David Moshman, John A.

===Research designs===
Most developmental studies, regardless of whether they employ the experimental, correlational, or case study method, can also be constructed using research designs.&lt;ref name=Bruning /&gt; Research designs are logical frameworks used to make key comparisons within research studies such as:
* [[cross-sectional design]]
* [[longitudinal design]]
* [[cohort study|sequential design]]
* [[microgenetic design]]

In a [[longitudinal study]], a researcher observes many individuals born at or around the same time (a [[cohort (statistics)|cohort]]) and carries out new observations as members of the cohort age. This method can be used to draw conclusions about which types of development are universal (or [[norm (sociology)|normative]]) and occur in most members of a cohort. As an example a longitudinal study of early literacy development examined in detail the early literacy experiences of one child in each of 30 families.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jweducation.com/PhDabstractsummary.html A Longitudinal Study of Early Literacy Development and the Changing Perceptions of Parents and Teachers], Dr John Worthington, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers may also observe ways that development varies between individuals, and hypothesize about the causes of variation in their data. Longitudinal studies often require large amounts of time and funding, making them unfeasible in some situations. Also, because members of a cohort all experience historical events unique to their generation, apparently normative developmental trends may, in fact, be universal only to their cohort.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|40}}

In a [[cross-sectional study]], a researcher observes differences between individuals of different ages at the same time. This generally requires fewer resources than the longitudinal method, and because the individuals come from different cohorts, shared historical events are not so much of a [[lurking variable|confounding factor]]. By the same token, however, cross-sectional research may not be the most effective way to study differences between participants, as these differences may result not from their different ages but from their exposure to ''different'' historical events.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|41}}

A third study design, the [[cohort study|sequential design]], combines both methodologies. Here, a researcher observes members of different birth cohorts at the same time, and then tracks all participants over time, charting changes in the groups. While much more resource-intensive, the format aids in a clearer distinction between what changes can be attributed to an individual or historical environment from those that are truly universal.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|42}}

Because every method has some weaknesses, developmental psychologists rarely rely on one study or even one method to reach conclusions by finding consistent evidence from as many converging sources as possible.&lt;ref name=Prentice-Hall /&gt;

===Prenatal development===
{{Main|Prenatal development}}
{{See also|Fetal psychology}}
Prenatal development is of interest to psychologists investigating the context of early psychological development. The whole prenatal development involves three main stages: germinal stage, embryonic stage and fetal stage. Germinal stage begins at conception until 2 weeks; embryonic stage means the development from 2 weeks to 8 weeks; fetal stage represents 9 weeks until birth of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=K|last=Cherry|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/developmentalpsychology/a/prenataldevelop.htm|title=Stages of Prenatal Development|website=About Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=May 2016}} The senses develop in the womb itself: a fetus can both see and hear by the second trimester (13 to 24 weeks of age). The sense of touch develops in the embryonic stage (5 to 8 weeks).&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|97}} Most of the brain's billions of neurons also are developed by the second trimester.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|100}} Babies are hence born with some odor, taste and sound preferences, largely related to the mother's environment.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|101}}

Some [[primitive reflexes]] too arise before birth and are still present in newborns. One hypothesis is that these reflexes are vestigial and have limited use in early human life. [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development]] suggested that some early reflexes are building blocks for infant sensorimotor development. For example, the [[tonic neck reflex]] may help development by bringing objects into the infant's field of view.&lt;ref name="butterworth"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Butterworth |first=G. |author2=Harris, M. |title=Principles of Developmental Psychology |year=1994 |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |isbn=0-86377-280-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reflexes, such as the [[walking reflex]] appear to be replaced by more sophisticated voluntary control later in infancy. This may be because the infant gains too much weight after birth to be strong enough to use the reflex, or because the reflex and subsequent development are functionally different.&lt;ref name="bremner"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bremner |first=J.G. |title=Infancy |year=1994 |publisher=Blackwell |edition=2 |isbn=0-631-18466-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that some reflexes (for example the [[moro reflex|moro]] and [[walking reflex]]es) are predominantly adaptations to life in the womb with little connection to early infant development.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt;  Primitive reflexes reappear in adults under certain conditions, such as neurological conditions like [[dementia]] or traumatic lesions.

[[Ultrasound]] has shown that infants are capable of a range of movements in the womb, many of which appear to be more than simple reflexes.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt; By the time they are born, infants can recognize and have a preference for their mother's voice suggesting some prenatal development of auditory perception.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt; Prenatal development and birth complications may also be connected to neurodevelopmental disorders, for example in [[schizophrenia]]. With the advent of [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[embryology]] and the neuroscience of prenatal development is of increasing interest to developmental psychology research.

Several environmental agents—[[teratogens]]—can cause damage during the prenatal period. These include prescription and nonprescription drugs, illegal drugs, tobacco, alcohol, environmental pollutants, infectious disease agents such as the [[rubella]] virus and the [[toxoplasmosis]] parasite, maternal malnutrition, maternal emotional stress, and Rh factor blood incompatibility between mother and child.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|102–115}} There are many statistics which prove the effects of the aforementioned substances. A leading example of this would be that, in America alone, approximately 100,000-375,000 'cocaine babies' are born on an annual basis. This is a result of an expectant mother abusing the drug while pregnant. 'Cocaine babies' are proven to have quite severe and lasting difficulties which persist throughout infancy and right throughout childhood. The drug also encourages behavioural problems in the affected children, as well as defects of various vital organs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=One of five expectant mothers use cocaine, U.S. study finds|author=AP|work=Toronto star

===Infancy===
{{Main|Infant and child psychology|Infant cognitive development}}
From birth until the first year, the child is referred to as an [[infant]].&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt; Developmental psychologists vary widely in their assessment of infant psychology, and the influence the outside world has upon it, but certain aspects are relatively clear.

The majority of a newborn infant's time is spent in sleep. At first, this sleep is evenly spread throughout the day and night, but after a couple of months, infants generally become [[diurnal animal|diurnal]].

Infants can be seen to have six states, grouped into pairs:
* quiet sleep and active sleep ([[dream]]ing, when [[REM sleep]] occurs)
* quiet waking, and active waking
* fussing and [[crying]]

====Infant perception====
Infant perception is what a newborn can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch.  These five features are better known as one's "five senses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bee |first=Denise Boyd, Helen |title=The developing child |publisher=Pearson Education |location=Upper Saddle River, N.J. |isbn=978-0-205-25602-0 |page=36 |edition=13th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants respond to stimuli differently in these different states.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt;

* [[Visual perception|Vision]] is significantly worse in infants than in older children. Infant sight tends to be blurry in early stages but improves over time. Color perception similar to that seen in adults has been demonstrated in infants as young as four months, using habituation methods.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt; Infants get to adult-like vision in about six months.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|191}}
* [[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] is well-developed prior to birth, unlike vision. Newborns prefer complex sounds to pure tones, human speech to other sounds, mother's voice to other voices, and the native language to other languages. Scientist believe these features are probably learned in the womb.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|151}} Infants are fairly good at detecting the direction a sound comes from, and by 18 months their hearing ability is approximately equal to an adult's.
* [[Olfaction|Smell]] and [[taste]] are present, with infants showing different expressions of disgust or pleasure when presented with pleasant odors (honey, milk, etc.) or unpleasant odors (rotten egg) and tastes (e.g. sour taste). Newborns are born with odor and taste preferences acquired in the womb from the smell and taste of amniotic fluid, in turn influenced by what the mother eats. Both breast- and bottle-fed babies around 3 days old prefer the smell of human milk to that of formula, indicating an innate preference.&lt;ref name="Berk" /&gt;{{rp|150}} There is good evidence for older infants preferring the smell of their mother to that of others.&lt;ref name="butterworth" /&gt;
* [[Haptic perception|Touch and feel]] is one of the better-developed senses at birth considering it's one of the first senses to develop inside the womb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Feldman |first=Ruth Duskin |last2=Papalia |first2=Diane E. |title=A child's world: infancy through adolescence |year=2010 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-353204-2 |page=57 |edition=12th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is evidenced by the [[primitive reflexes]] described above, and the relatively advanced development of the [[somatosensory cortex]].&lt;ref name="Slater"&gt;{{cite book |title=Introduction to Infant Development |last1=Slater |first1=A. |last2=Lewis |first2=M. |isbn=0-19-928305-2 |publisher=OUP |location=Oxford |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Pain]]: Infants feel pain similarly, if not more strongly than older children but pain-relief in infants has not received so much attention as an area of research.&lt;ref name="MatthewMatthew"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/pmj.79.934.438 |journal=Postgraduate Medical Journal |year=2003 |volume=79 |issue=934 |pages=438–43 |title=Assessment and management of pain in infants |last=Mathew |first=P.J. |last2=Mathew |first2=J.L. |url=http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/79/934/438 |pmid=12954954 |pmc=1742785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glucose is known to relieve pain in newborns.&lt;ref name="DilenElseviers"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1523-536X.2010.00389.x |journal=Birth (Berkeley, Calif.) |year=2010 |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=98–105 |title=Oral glucose solution as pain relief in newborns: results of a clinical trial |last1=Dilen |first1=Ben |last2=Elseviers |first2=Monique |pmid=20557532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Language====
{{Main|Language development}}
Babies are born with the ability to discriminate virtually all sounds of all human languages.&lt;ref name=Berk /&gt;{{rp|189}} Infants of around six months can differentiate between [[phoneme]]s in their own language, but not between similar phonemes in another language. At this stage infants also start to [[Babbling|babble]], producing phonemes.

====Infant cognition: the Piagetian era====
Piaget suggested that an infant's perception and understanding of the world depended on their motor development, which was required for the infant to link visual, tactile and motor representations of objects.&lt;ref&gt;Lefmann, T. &amp; Combs-Orme, T. 2013, "Early Brain Development for Social Work Practice: Integrating Neuroscience with Piaget's Theory of Cognitive Development", Journal of Human Behavior in the Social Environment, vol. 23, no. 5, pp. 640-647.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this view, it is through touching and handling objects that infants develop [[object permanence]], the understanding that objects are solid, permanent, and continue to exist when out of sight.&lt;ref name="bremner" /&gt;

[[File:Baby.jpg|thumb|200px|Special methods are used in the psychological study of infants.]]
Piaget's sensorimotor stage comprised six sub-stages (see [[Theory of cognitive development#Sensorimotor period|sensorimotor stages]] for more detail). In the early stages, development arises out of movements caused by [[primitive reflexes]].&lt;ref name="Gruber"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Piaget |first=J. |year=1977 |title=The essential Piaget |editor-first=H.E. |editor-last=Gruber |editor2-first=J.J. |editor2-last=Voneche |location=New York |publisher=Basic Books |isbn=0-7100-8778-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Discovery of new behaviors results from [[classical conditioning|classical]] and [[operant conditioning]], and the formation of [[habit (psychology)|habits]].&lt;ref name="Gruber" /&gt; From eight months the infant is able to uncover a hidden object but will persevere when the object is moved.

Piaget came to his conclusion that infants lacked a complete understanding of object permanence before 18 months after observing infants' failure before this age to look for an object where it was last seen. Instead, infants continue to look for an object where it was first seen, committing the "[[A-not-B error]]." Some researchers have suggested that before the age of eight to nine months, infants' inability to understand object permanence extends to people, which explains why infants at this age do not cry when their mothers are gone ("Out of sight, out of mind").

====Recent findings in infant cognition====
In the 1980s and 1990s, researchers have developed many new methods of assessing infants' understanding of the world with far more precision and subtlety than Piaget was able to do in his time. Since then, many studies based on these methods suggest that young infants understand far more about the world than first thought.

Based on recent findings, some researchers (such as [[Elizabeth Spelke]] and [[Renee Baillargeon]]) have proposed that an understanding of object permanence is not learned at all, but rather comprises part of the innate cognitive capacities of our species.

Other research has suggested that young infants in their first six months of life may possess an understanding of numerous aspects of the world around them, including:

* an early [[numerical cognition]], that is, an ability to represent number and even compute the outcomes of addition and subtraction operations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wynn |first1=Karen |authorlink1=Karen Wynn |year=1992  |title=Addition and subtraction by human infants |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=358 |issue= 6389|pages=749–750 |publisher= |doi= 10.1038/358749a0|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v358/n6389/abs/358749a0.html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an ability to infer the goals of people in their environment;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1998 | title = Infants selectively encode the goal object of an actor's reach | url = | journal = Cognition | volume =  69| issue = | pages =  1–34| doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(98)00058-4  | last1 = Woodward | first1 = A}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* an ability to engage in simple causal reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leslie | first1 = A. | last2 = Keeble | first2 = S. | year = 1987 | title = Do six-month-old infants perceive causality?| url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 265–288 | doi = 10.1016/S0010-0277(87)80006-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Critical periods of development====
There are [[critical period]]s in infancy and childhood during which development of certain perceptual, sensorimotor, social and language systems depends crucially on environmental stimulation.&lt;ref name="Siegler"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Siegler |first=Robert |year=2006 |title=How Children Develop, Exploring Child Development Student Media Tool Kit &amp; Scientific American Reader to Accompany How Children Develop |location=New York |publisher=Worth Publishers |isbn=0-7167-6113-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feral child]]ren such as [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]], deprived of adequate stimulation, fail to acquire important skills and are unable to learn in later childhood. The concept of critical periods is also well-established in [[neurophysiology]], from the work of [[Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel|Wiesel]] among others.

====Developmental delays====
Children with developmental delays (DD) are at heightened risk for developing clinically significant behavioral and emotional difficulties as compared to children with typical development (TD). However, nearly all studies comparing psychopathology in youth with DD employ TD control groups of the same chronological age (CA).This comorbidity of DD and a mental disorder is often referred to as dual diagnosis. Epidemiological studies indicate that 30–50% of youth with DD meet the clinical cutoff for behavioral and emotional problems and/or diagnosable mental disorder. Studies that include comparison samples of children with typical development (TD) highlight the considerable difference in risk for psychopathology, with the relative risk for youth with DD (to youth with TD) ranging from 2.8–4.1 to 1.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Toddler-hood===
{{Main|Toddler}}
Infants shift between ages of one and two to a developmental stage known as toddlerhood. In this stage, an infant's transition into toddlerhood is highlighted through self-awareness, developing maturity in language use, and presence of memory and imagination.

During toddlerhood, babies begin learning how to [[Walking|walk]], talk, and make decisions for themselves. An important characteristic of this age period is the [[Language development|development of language]], where children are learning how to communicate and express their emotions and desires through the use of vocal sounds, babbling, and eventually words.&lt;ref name=Upton&gt;{{cite book|last=Upton|first=Penney|title=Developmental Psychology: Critical Thinking in Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Learning Matters|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85725-276-3|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-control also begins to develop. At this age, children take initiative to explore, experiment and learn from making mistakes. Caretakers who encourage toddlers to try new things and test their limits, help the child become autonomous, self-reliant, and confident.&lt;ref name=ToddlerPlay&gt;{{cite book|last=Massi|first=Wendy S.|title=Toddler Play|year=2001|publisher=Creative Pub. international|isbn=0-86573-435-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the caretaker is overprotective or disapproving of independent actions, the toddler may begin to doubt their abilities and feel ashamed of the desire for independence. The child's autonomic development is inhibited, leaving them less prepared to deal with the world in the future. Toddlers also begin to identify themselves in [[gender role]]s, acting according to their perception of what a man or woman should do.&lt;ref name=UPton&gt;{{cite book|last=Upton|first=Penney|title=Developmental Psychology: Critical Thinking in Psychology|year=2011|publisher=Learning Matters|location=Exeter|isbn=0-85725-276-3|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socially, the period of toddler-hood is commonly called the "terrible twos".&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=Barbara M.|title=Development Through Life : A Psychosocial Approach|year=2011|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=1-111-34468-X|pages=215–217|author2=Newman, P. R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toddlers often use their new-found language abilities to voice their desires, but are often misunderstood by parents due to their language skills just beginning to develop.  A person at this stage testing their independence is another reason behind the stage's infamous label. Tantrums in a fit of frustration are also common.

===Childhood===
{{See also|Early childhood}}
[[Erik Erikson]] divides childhood into four stages, each with its distinct social crisis:&lt;ref name="Bernardo J. Carducci 2009"&gt;Bernardo J. Carducci, ''The Psychology of Personality: Viewpoints, Research, and Applications'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009), 189.&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Stage 1: [[Infancy]] (0 to 1½) in which the psychosocial crisis is Trust vs. Mistrust
:* Stage 2: Early childhood (2½ to 3) in which the psychosocial crisis is Autonomy vs. Shame and doubt
:* Stage 3: Play age (3 to 5) in which the psychosocial crisis is Initiative vs. Guilt. (This stage is also called the "pre-school age," "exploratory age" and "toy age."&lt;ref&gt;Vardhaman I.Q. Toys, "Vision," http://www.vardhamaniqtoys.com/vision.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;)
:* Stage 4: School age (5 to 12) in which the psychosocial crisis is Industry vs. Inferiority

'''Play (or preschool) ages 3–5.'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the earliest years, children are "completely dependent on the care of others." Therefore, they develop a "social relationship" with their care givers and, later, with family members. During their preschool years (3-5), they "enlarge their social horizons" to include people outside the family.&lt;ref&gt;Arland Thornton, ''The Well-being of Children and Families: Research and Data Needs'' (University of Michigan Press, 2001), 73-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cognitive development#Preoperational stage|Preoperational]] and then [[Cognitive development#Concrete operational stage|operational]] thinking develops, which means actions are reversible, and egocentric thought diminishes.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Lightfoot, Michael Cole, Sheila R. Cole, ''The Development of Children'' (Macmillan, 2008), 275-277.&lt;/ref&gt;

The motor skills of preschoolers increase so they can do more things for themselves. They become more independent. No longer completely dependent on the care of others, the world of this age group expands. More people have a role in shaping their individual personalities. Preschoolers explore and question their world.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Preschoolers (3-5 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/preschoolers.html&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Jean Piaget]], the child is "''a little scientist'' exploring and reflecting on these explorations to increase competence" and this is done in "a very independent way."&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Halpenny, Jan Pettersen, ''Introducing Piaget: A Guide for Practitioners and Students in Early Years Education'' (Routledge, 2013), 7, 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Play is a major activity for ages 3–5. For Piaget, through play "a child reaches higher levels of cognitive development."&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Halpenny, Jan Pettersen, ''Introducing Piaget: A Guide for Practitioners and Students in Early Years Education'' (Routledge, 2013), 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their expanded world, children in the 3-5 age group attempt to find their own way. If this is done in a socially acceptable way, the child develops the initiative. If not, the child develops guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Bob O'Connor, Christine Wells, Trent Applegate, ''Health: You and Your World Volume 1: Brief Edition'' (CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform, 2015), 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who develop "guilt" rather than "initiative" have failed Erikson's psychosocial crisis for the 3-5 age group.

'''Middle childhood ages 6–12.'''&lt;br /&gt;
For Erik Erikson, the psychosocial crisis during middle childhood is Industry vs. Inferiority which, if successfully met, instills a sense of Competency in the child.&lt;ref name="Bernardo J. Carducci 2009" /&gt;

In all cultures, middle childhood is a time for developing "skills that will be needed in their society."&lt;ref name="Barbara Engler 2013"&gt;Barbara Engler, ''Personality Theories, 9th edition'' (Cengage Learning, 2013), 142.&lt;/ref&gt; School offers an arena in which children can gain a view of themselves as "industrious (and worthy)." They are "graded for their school work and often for their industry." They can also develop industry outside of school in sports, games, and doing volunteer work.&lt;ref name="Marc H. Bornstein 2010"&gt;Marc H. Bornstein, Deborah Lowe Vandell, Karen S. Rook, ''Lifespan Development: Infancy Through Adulthood'' (Cengage Learning, 2010), 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Children who achieve "success in school or games might develop a feeling of competence."

The "peril during this period is that feelings of inadequacy and inferiority will develop.&lt;ref name="Barbara Engler 2013" /&gt; Parents and teachers can "undermine" a child's development by failing to recognize accomplishments or being overly critical of a child's efforts.&lt;ref name="Marc H. Bornstein 2010" /&gt;
Children who are "encouraged and praised" develop a belief in their competence. Lack of encouragement or ability to excel lead to "feelings of inadequacy and inferiority".&lt;ref&gt;Megan Broutian, Milestones, "Your child: early school years (7 to 11 years) stage of development" in ''Your Child's Development'' online at http://behavioralchild.com/milestones/. Accessed October 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Centers for Disease Control]] (the CDC) divides Middle Childhood into two stages, 6–8 years and 9–11 years, and gives "developmental milestones for each stage."&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle.html and Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (9-11 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle2.html. Both accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Middle Childhood (7-10).''&lt;br /&gt;
Entering elementary school, children in this age group begin to thinks about the future and their "place in the world." Working with other students and wanting their friendship and acceptance become more important. This leads to "more independence from parents and family." As students, they develop the mental and verbal skills "to describe experiences and talk about thoughts and feelings". They become less self-centered and show "more concern for others".&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle.html. Accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Middle Childhood (9-11).''&lt;br /&gt;
For children ages 9–11 "friendships and peer relationships" increase in strength, complexity, and importance. This results in greater "peer pressure." They grow even less dependent on their families and they are challenged academically. To meet this challenge, they increase their attention span and learn to see other points of view.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control, "Child Development: Middle Childhood (6-8 years of age)" online at https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/childdevelopment/positiveparenting/middle2.html. Accessed October 15, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
{{Main|Adolescent psychology}}
Adolescence is the period of life between the onset of puberty and the full commitment to an adult social role, such as worker, parent, and/or citizen. It is the period known for the formation of personal and social identity (see [[Erik Erikson]]) and the discovery of moral purpose (see [[William Damon]]). Intelligence is demonstrated through the logical use of symbols related to abstract concepts and formal reasoning. A return to [[egocentric]] thought often occurs early in the period. Only 35% develop the capacity to reason formally during adolescence or adulthood. (Huitt, W. and Hummel, J. January 1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~moursund/Math/developmental_theory.htm|title=Developmental Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is divided into three parts, namely:
# Early Adolescence: 9 to 13 years 
# Mid Adolescence: 13 to 15 years and
# Late Adolescence: 15 to 18 years

The adolescent unconsciously explores questions such as "Who am I? Who do I want to be?" Like toddlers, adolescents must explore, test limits, become [[autonomous]], and commit to an [[identity (social science)|identity]], or [[sense of self]]. Different roles, behaviors and [[ideologies]] must be tried out to select an identity. Role confusion and inability to choose vocation can result from a failure to achieve a sense of identity through, for example, friends.

===Early adulthood===
{{Main|Young adult (psychology)}}
Early adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 18 to 25, and according to theorists such as Erik Erikson, is a stage where development is mainly focused on [[Interpersonal relationship|maintaining relationships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kastenbaum|first=Robert|title=Encyclopedia of Adult Development|year=1993|publisher=Oryx Press|isbn=0-89774-669-4|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples include creating bond of intimacy, sustaining friendships, and ultimately making a family. Some theorists state that development of intimacy skills rely on the resolution of previous developmental stages. A sense of identity gained in the previous stages is also necessary for intimacy to develop. If this skill is not learned the alternative is alienation, isolation, a fear of commitment, and the inability to depend on others.

A related framework for studying this part of the lifespan is that of [[emerging adulthood]]. Scholars of emerging adulthood, such as Jeffrey Arnett, are not necessarily interested in relationship development. Instead, this concept suggests that people transition after their teenage years into a period not characterized as relationship building and an overall sense of constancy with life, but with years of living with parents, phases of self-discovery, and experimentation.&lt;ref name=Twenge&gt;{{cite journal|last=Twenge|first=Jean M.|title=Review of emerging adulthood: The winding road from the late teens through the twenties|journal=American Journal of Psychology|year=2008|volume=121|issue=4|pages=682–687}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle adulthood===
{{Main|Middle age}}
Middle adulthood generally refers to the period between ages 25 to 69. During this period, middle-aged adults experience a conflict between generativity and stagnation. They may either feel a sense of contributing to society, the next generation, or their immediate community; or develop a sense of purposelessness.

Physically, the middle-aged experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, sensory keenness, and cardiac output. Also, women experience [[menopause]] and a sharp drop in the hormone [[estrogen]]. Men experience an equivalent endocrine system event to menopause. [[Andropause]] in males is a hormone fluctuation with physical and psychological effects that can be similar to those seen in menopausal females. As men age lowered testosterone levels can contribute to mood swings and a decline in [[spermatozoa|sperm]] count. Sexual responsiveness can also be affected, including delays in [[erection]] and longer periods of [[penile stimulation]] required to achieve [[ejaculation]].

===Old age===
{{Main|Old age}}

The [[World Health Organization]] finds "no general agreement on the age at which a person becomes old." Most [[Developed country|"developed countries"]] set the age as 60 or 65. However, in [[Developing country|developing countries]] inability to make "active contribution" to society, not chronological age, marks the beginning of old age.&lt;ref&gt;"Definition of an older or elderly person" on World Health Organization website at http://www.who.int/healthinfo/survey/ageingdefnolder/en/. Accessed October 11, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development]], old age is the stage in which individuals assess the quality of their lives. In reflecting on their lives, people in this age group develop a feeling of integrity if deciding that their lives were successful or a feeling of despair if evaluation of one's life indicates a failure to achieve goals.&lt;ref name="Miller2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia R.

Physically, older people experience a decline in muscular strength, reaction time, stamina, hearing, distance perception, and the sense of smell.&lt;ref name="Deary2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Deary | first1 = I.

Sexual expression depends in large part upon the emotional and physical health of the individual. Many older adults continue to be sexually active and satisfied with their sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blanchard-Fields|first=John C.

Mental [[wikt:disintegration|disintegration]] may also occur, leading to [[dementia]] or ailments such as [[Alzheimer's disease]].

==Parenting==
Parenting variables alone have typically accounted for 20 to 50 percent of the variance in child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Flaherty&gt;{{cite journal|last=Flaherty|first=Serena Cherry|author2=Sadler, Lois S.|title=A Review of Attachment Theory in the Context of Adolescent Parenting|journal=Journal of Pediatric Health Care|date=1 March 2011|volume=25|issue=2|pages=114–121|doi=10.1016/j.pedhc.2010.02.005|pmc=3051370|pmid=21320683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All parents have their own parenting styles. Parenting styles, according to [https://www.human.cornell.edu/people/kak33 Kimberly Kopko], are "based upon two aspects of parenting behavior; control and warmth. Parental control refers to the degree to which parents manage their children's behavior. Parental warmth refers to the degree to which parents are accepting and responsive to their children's behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kopoko|first1=Kimberly|title=Parenting Styles and Adolescents|journal=Cornell University Cooperative Extension|date=2007|pages=1–8|url=http://www.human.cornell.edu/pam/outreach/parenting/research/upload/Parenting-20Styles-20and-20Adolescents.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parenting styles===
The following [[parenting styles]] have been described in the child development literature:

* Authoritative parenting is characterized as parents who have high parental warmth, responsiveness, and demandingness, but rate low in negativity and conflict.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=Lorraine C.|author2=Clayton, Jennifer D. |author3=Rowley, Stephanie J. |title=Academic Socialization: Understanding Parental Influences on Children's School-Related Development in the Early Years.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=1 January 2004|volume=8|issue=3|pages=163–178|doi=10.1037/1089-2680.8.3.163}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parents are assertive but not intrusive or overly restrictive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumrind|first=D.|title=The Influence of Parenting Style on Adolescent Competence and Substance Use|journal=The Journal of Early Adolescence|date=1 February 1991|volume=11|issue=1|pages=56–95|doi=10.1177/0272431691111004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This method of parenting is associated with more positive social and academic outcomes. The beneficial outcomes of authoritative parenting are not necessarily universal. Among African American adolescents, authoritative parenting is not associated with academic achievement without peer support for achievement.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; Children who are raised by authoritative parents are "more likely to become independent, self-reliant, socially accepted, academically successful, and well-behaved. They are less likely to report depression and anxiety, and less likely to engage in antisocial behavior like delinquency and drug use."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewar PHD|first1=Gwen|title=The authoritative parenting style: Warmth, rationality, and high standards." A guide for the science-minded parent|url=http://www.parentingscience.com/authoritative-parenting-style.html|website=Parenting Science|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Authoritarian parenting is characterized by low levels of warmth and responsiveness with high levels of demandingness and firm control.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; These parents focus on obedience and they monitor their children regularly.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; In general, this style of parenting is associated with maladaptive outcomes.  The outcomes are more harmful for middle class boys than girls, preschool white girls than preschool black girls, and for white boys than Hispanic boys.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; Furthermore, the negative effects of authoritarian parenting among Asian Americans can be offset by positive peer support.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt; Finally, among African Americans, some elements of authoritarian parenting such as firm control and physical discipline do not serve as predictive factors for negative outcomes.&lt;ref name=Taylor /&gt;
* Permissive parenting is characterized by high levels of responsiveness combined with low levels of demandingness.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt; These parents are lenient and do not necessarily require mature behavior.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  They allow for a high degree of self-regulation and typically avoid confrontation.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Compared to children raised using the authoritative style, preschool girls raised in permissive families are less assertive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Additionally, preschool children of both sexes are less cognitively competent than those children raised under authoritative parenting styles.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;
* Rejecting or neglectful parenting is the final category. This is characterized by low levels of demandingness and responsiveness. These parents are typically disengaged in their child's lives, lacking structure in their parenting styles and are unsupportive.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;  Children in this category are typically the least competent of all the categories.&lt;ref name=Baumrind /&gt;

===Mother and father factors===
Parenting roles in child development have typically focused on the role of the mother. Recent literature, however, has looked toward the father as having an important role in child development.  Affirming a role for fathers, studies have shown that children as young as 15 months benefit significantly from substantial engagement with their father.&lt;ref name="aredos"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ericdigests.org/2004-3/role.html|title=Fathers' Role in Children's Academic Achievement and Early Literacy. ERIC Digest.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Children with active, involved fathers have better social skills, are healthier, and do better in school", according to Duane Wilson, the Proud Fathers, Proud Parents program coordinator for the Michigan Department of Human Services (http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-2125328669291708941 2:57)&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, a study in the U.S. and New Zealand found the presence of the natural father was the most significant factor in reducing rates of early sexual activity and rates of teenage pregnancy in girls.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce J. Ellis, Child Development May/June 2003, 74:3, pp. 801–21&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, another argument is that neither a mother nor a father is actually essential in successful parenting, and that single parents as well as homosexual couples can support positive child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Silverstein&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silverstein|first=Louise|author2=Carl Auerbach|title=Deconstructing the Essential Father|journal=American Psychologist|year=1999|volume=54|pages=397–407|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.54.6.397}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this set of research, children need at least one consistently responsible adult with whom the child can have a positive emotional connection. Having more than one of these figures contributes to a higher likelihood of positive child outcomes.&lt;ref name=Silverstein /&gt;

===Divorce===
Another parental factor often debated in terms of its effects on child development is divorce.  Divorce in itself is not a determining factor of negative child outcomes. In fact, the majority of children from divorcing families fall into the normal range on measures of psychological and cognitive functioning.&lt;ref name=Whiteside&gt;{{cite journal|last=Whiteside|first=Mary F.|author2=Becker, Betsy Jane|title=Parental factors and the young child's postdivorce adjustment: A meta-analysis with implications for parenting arrangements.|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|date=1 January 2000|volume=14|issue=1|pages=5–26|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.14.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of mediating factors play a role in determining the effects divorce has on a child, for example, divorcing families with young children often face harsher consequences in terms of demographic, social, and economic changes than do families with older children.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt; Positive coparenting after divorce is part of a pattern associated with positive child coping, while hostile parenting behaviors lead to a destructive pattern leaving children at risk.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt; Additionally, direct parental relationship with the child also affects the development of a child after a divorce.  Overall, protective factors facilitating positive child development after a divorce are maternal warmth, positive father-child relationship, and cooperation between parents.&lt;ref name=Whiteside /&gt;

'''''Don't Be Such A Scientist:  Talking Substance in an Age of Style''''' is a [[book]] published by [[Island Press]] written by [[scientist]]-turned-[[filmmaker]] [[Randy Olson]], [[Ph.D.]] which arises from a talk of the same title Olson gave to science audiences at [[university|universities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.psu.edu/alert/Johnson9-2008.htm|title=Randy Olson to Show Comedy/Science Movies and Discuss Science Communication|publisher=[[Penn State University]]}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[museum]]s for five years preceding its publication.  The focus of the book is the challenge scientists face in communicating to the general public in an age of [[information-overload]].  Olson draws on his two careers, first as a [[marine biologist]] who achieved a [[tenure]]d [[professor]]ship, then his second career which began when he then resigned to attend [[film school]] and [[acting]] classes, eventually becoming an independent feature filmmaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/11/science/sciencespecial2/11prof.html|title=Eager to Tell the Stories of Science, a Biologist Evolves|work=[[NY Times]]|author=Cornelia Dean|date=April 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other topics, the book addresses the role of spontaneity, storytelling, and likeability in the [[mass communication]] [[Science communication|of science]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20716">The '''Elliott formula''' describes analytically, or with few adjustable parameters such as the [[dephasing]] constant, the light [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] or [[emission (electromagnetic radiation)|emission]] spectra of [[solids]]. It was originally derived by [[Roger James Elliott]] to describe linear absorption based on properties of a single electron–hole pair.&lt;ref name="Elliott1963"&gt;
Kuper, C. G.; Whitfield, G. D. (1963). ''Polarons and Excitons''. Plenum Press. LCCN [http://lccn.loc.gov/63021217 63021217].
&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis can be extended to a many-body investigation with full predictive powers when all parameters are computed microscopically using, e.g., the [[semiconductor Bloch equations]] (abbreviated as SBEs) or the [[semiconductor luminescence equations]] (abbreviated as SLEs).

==Background==

One of the most accurate theories of semiconductor [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and [[photoluminescence]] is provided by the SBEs and SLEs, respectively. Both of them are systematically derived starting from the many-body/quantum-optical system Hamiltonian and fully describe the resulting quantum dynamics of optical and quantum-optical [[observables]] such as optical polarization (SBEs) and photoluminescence intensity (SLEs). All relevant many-body effects can be systematically included by using various techniques such as the [[cluster-expansion approach]].

Both the [[Semiconductor-Bloch Equations|SBEs]] and [[Semiconductor-Luminescence Equations|SLEs]] contain an identical homogeneous part driven either by a classical field (SBEs) or by a [[Spontaneous emission|spontaneous-emission source]] (SLEs). This homogeneous part yields an eigenvalue problem that can be expressed through the [[Wannier equation|generalized Wannier equation]] that can be solved analytically in special cases. In particular, the low-density Wannier equation is analogous to bound solutions of the [[hydrogen]] problem of quantum mechanics. These are often referred to as [[exciton]] solutions and they formally describe Coulombic binding by oppositely charged electrons and holes. The actual physical meaning of excitonic states is discussed further in connection with the [[Semiconductor-Bloch Equations|SBEs]] and [[Semiconductor-Luminescence Equations|SLEs]]. The exciton [[eigenfunctions]] are denoted by &lt;math&gt;\phi_\lambda({\mathbf{k}})&lt;/math&gt;  where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; labels the exciton state with eigenenergy &lt;math&gt;E_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hbar {\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[crystal momentum]] of charge carriers in the [[solid]].

These exciton eigenstates provide valuable insight to SBEs and SLEs, especially, when one analyses the linear semiconductor absorption spectrum or photoluminescence at [[steady-state]] conditions. One simply uses the constructed eigenstates to [[Matrix diagonalization#Diagonalization|diagonalize]] the homogeneous parts of the SBEs and SLEs.&lt;ref name="SQOBook"&gt;
Kira, M.; Koch, S. W. (2011). ''Semiconductor Quantum Optics''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0521875097}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; Under the steady-state conditions, the resulting equations can be solved analytically when one further approximates dephasing due to higher-order many-body effects. When such effects are fully included, one must resort to a numeric approach. After the exciton states are obtained, one can eventually express the linear absorption and steady-state photoluminescence analytically.

The same approach can be applied to compute absorption spectrum for fields that are in the terahertz (abbreviated as THz) range&lt;ref name="Lee2009"&gt;
Lee, Y.-S. (2009). ''Principles of Terahertz Science and Technology''. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1007%2F978-0-387-09540-0 10.1007/978-0-387-09540-0]. {{ISBN|978-0-387-09539-4}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; of [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Since the THz-photon energy lies within the [[meV]] range, it is mostly resonant with the many-body states, not the interband transitions that are typically in the [[Electronvolt|eV]] range. Technically, the THz investigations are an extension of the ordinary SBEs and/or involve solving the dynamics of two-particle correlations explicitly.&lt;ref name="Kira2006"&gt;
Kira, M.; Koch, S.W. (2006). "Many-body correlations and excitonic effects in semiconductor spectroscopy". ''Progress in Quantum Electronics'' '''30''' (5): 155–296. doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.pquantelec.2006.12.002 10.1016/j.pquantelec.2006.12.002]
&lt;/ref&gt; Like for the optical absorption and emission problem, one can diagonalize the homogeneous parts that emerge analytically with the help of the exciton eigenstates. Once the diagonalization is completed, one can then compute the THz absorption analytically.
 
All of these derivations rely on the steady-state conditions and the analytic knowledge of the exciton states. Furthermore, the effect of further many-body contributions, such as the [[excitation-induced dephasing]], can be included microscopically&lt;ref name="JahnkeKira1996"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; to the Wannier solver, which removes the need to introduce phenomenological dephasing constant, energy shifts, or screening of the [[Coulomb interaction]].

==Linear optical absorption==

[[File:Linear Elliott formula spectrum of bulk GaAs.png|500px|thumbnail|right|Characteristic linear absorption spectrum &lt;math&gt;\alpha(E)&lt;/math&gt; of bulk GaAs using two-band SBEs. The decay of polarization is approximated with a decay constant &lt;math&gt;\hbar \gamma = 0.13\,\mathrm{meV}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha(E)&lt;/math&gt; is computed as function of the pump field's photon energy &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;. The energy is shifted with respect to the band-gap energy &lt;math&gt;E_{\mathrm{gap}}=1.490\,\mathrm{meV}&lt;/math&gt; and the semiconductor is initially unexcited. Due to the small dephasing constant used, several excitonic resonances appear (vertical lines) well below the bandgap energy. The magnitude of high-energy resonances are multiplied by 5 for visibility.]]

Linear [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] of [[broadband]] weak optical probe can then be expressed as

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Linear Elliott formula'''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
    \alpha(\omega) = \mathrm{Im}\left[ \sum_\lambda \frac{F_\lambda}{E_\lambda - \hbar \omega - \mathrm{i} \gamma_\lambda(\omega)}\right] 
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding

|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

where &lt;math&gt;\hbar \omega&lt;/math&gt; is the probe-photon energy, &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the oscillator strength of the [[exciton]] state &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the dephasing constant associated with the exciton state &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. For a [[phenomenological model|phenomenological]] description, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; can be used as a single fit parameter, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\lambda \rightarrow \gamma&lt;/math&gt;. However, a full microscopic computation generally produces  &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\lambda(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; that depends on both exciton index &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; and photon frequency. As a general tendency,  &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\lambda(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; increases for elevated &lt;math&gt;E_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; while the &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; dependence is often weak.

Each of the exciton resonances can produce a peak to the absorption spectrum when the photon energy matches with &lt;math&gt;E_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. For [[Direct and indirect band gaps|direct-gap semiconductors]], the oscillator strength is proportional to the product of [[Transition dipole moment|dipole-matrix element]] squared and &lt;math&gt;|\sum_{\mathbf{k}} \phi_\lambda({\mathbf{k}})|^2&lt;/math&gt; that vanishes for all states except for those that are spherically symmetric. In other words, &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is nonvanishing only for the &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;-like states, following the quantum-number convention of the hydrogen problem. Therefore, optical spectrum of direct-gap semiconductors produces an absorption resonance only for the &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;-like state. The width of the resonance is determined by the corresponding dephasing constant.

In general, the exciton eigen energies consist of a series of bound states that emerge energetically well below the fundamental [[bandgap]] energy and a continuum of unbound states that appear for energies above the bandgap. Therefore, a typical semiconductor's low-density absorption spectrum shows a series of exciton resonances and then a continuum-absorption tail. For realistic situations, &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; increases more rapidly than the exciton-state spacing so that one typically resolves only few lowest exciton resonances in actual experiments.

The concentration of charge carriers influence the shape of the absorption spectrum considerably. For high enough densities, all &lt;math&gt;E_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; energies correspond to continuum states and some of the oscillators strengths may become negative-valued due to the [[Pauli-blocking]] effect. Physically, this can be understood as the elementary property of Fermions; if a given electronic state is already excited it cannot be excited a second time due to the Pauli exclusion among Fermions. Therefore, the corresponding electronic states can produce only photon emission that is seen as negative absorption, i.e., gain that is the prerequisite to realizing [[semiconductor lasers]].

Even though one can understand the principal behavior of semiconductor absorption on the basis of the Elliott formula, detailed predictions of the exact &lt;math&gt;E_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma_\lambda(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; requires a full many-body computation already for moderate carrier densities.

==Photoluminescence Elliott formula==

[[File:Photoluminescence spectrum for a semiconductor quantum well.png|500px|thumbnail|right|Photoluminescence intensity computed via the Elliott formula. The population of s-like exciton states follow a Boltzmann distribution at 35 Kelvin, where the 1''s'' population is suppressed to four percent and the dephasing constant is &lt;math&gt;\hbar \gamma \approx 1 /, \mathrm{meV}&lt;/math&gt;. The vertical lines indicate the position of ''s''-like excitonic resonances, i.e., 1''s'', 2''s'', 3''s'', etc. The bandgap energy is denoted by &lt;math&gt;E_\mathrm{gap}&lt;/math&gt; and 'arb. u.' means arbitrary units.
]]

After the semiconductor becomes electronically excited, the carrier system relaxes into a quasiequilibrium. At the same time, [[Quantum fluctuation|vacuum-field fluctuations]]&lt;ref name="Walls2008"&gt;
Walls, D. F.; Milburn, G. J. (2008). ''Quantum Optics'' (2nd ed.). {{ISBN|978-3-540-28574-8}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; trigger spontaneous recombination of electrons and holes (electronic vacancies) via spontaneous emission of photons. At quasiequilibrium, this yields a steady-state photon flux emitted by the semiconductor. By starting from the SLEs, the steady-state photoluminescence (abbreviated as PL) can be cast into the form

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''Photoluminescence Elliott formula'''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
    \mathrm{PL}(\omega) = \mathrm{Im}\left[ \sum_\lambda \frac{ F_\lambda S_\lambda }{E_\lambda - \hbar \omega - \mathrm{i} \gamma_\lambda(\omega)}\right]\, ,
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

that is very similar to the Elliott formula for the optical absorption. As a major difference, the numerator has a new contribution – the [[Spontaneous emission|spontaneous-emission source]]

&lt;math&gt;
    S_\lambda = \sum_{\mathbf{k}} |\phi_\lambda({\mathbf{k}})|^2 f_{\mathbf{k}}^e f_{\mathbf{k}}^h + \Delta N_\lambda\; 
&lt;/math&gt;

that contains electron and hole distributions &lt;math&gt;f_{\mathbf{k}}^e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_{\mathbf{k}}^h&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, where &lt;math&gt;\hbar{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is the carrier momentum. Additionally, &lt;math&gt;S_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; contains also a direct contribution from exciton populations &lt;math&gt;\Delta N_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; that describes truly bound [[Excitons|electron–hole]] pairs.

The &lt;math&gt;f^e_{\mathbf{k}} f^h_{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; term defines the probability to find an electron and a hole with same &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt;. Such a form is expected for a probability of two uncorrelated events to occur simultaneously at a desired &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{k}&lt;/math&gt; value. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;f^e_{\mathbf{k}} f^h_{\mathbf{k}}&lt;/math&gt; is the spontaneous-emission source originating from  uncorrelated electron–hole [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The possibility to have truly [[Exciton|correlated electron–hole]] pairs is defined by a two-particle exciton correlation &lt;math&gt;\Delta N_\lambda&lt;/math&gt;; the corresponding probability is directly proportional to the correlation. Nevertheless, both the presence of electron–hole plasma and excitons can equivalently induce the spontaneous emission. A further discussion of the relative weight and nature of plasma vs. exciton sources&lt;ref name="ChatterjeeEll2004"&gt;
Chatterjee, S.; Ell, C.; Mosor, S.; Khitrova, G.; Gibbs, H.; Hoyer, W.; Kira, M.; Koch, S.; Prineas, J.; Stolz, H. (2004). "Excitonic Photoluminescence in Semiconductor Quantum Wells: Plasma versus Excitons". ''Physical Review Letters'' '''92''' (6). doi:[https://dx.doi.org/10.1103%2FPhysRevLett.92.067402 10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.067402]
&lt;/ref&gt; is presented in connection with the [[Semiconductor-Luminescence Equations|SLEs]].

Like for the absorption, a direct-gap semiconductor emits light only at the resonances corresponding to the &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;-like states. As a typical trend, a quasiequilibrium emission is strongly peaked around the 1''s'' resonance because &lt;math&gt;S_\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is usually largest for the &lt;math&gt;\lambda=1s&lt;/math&gt; ground state. This emission peak often remains well below the fundamental bandgap energy even at the high excitations where all states are continuum states. This demonstrates that semiconductors are often subjects to massive Coulomb-induced renormalizations even when the system appears to have only electron–hole plasma states as emission resonances. To make an accurate prediction of the exact position and shape at elevated carrier densities, one must resort to the full SLEs.

==Terahertz Elliott formula==

[[File:THz absorption spectrum of bulk GaAs.png|500px|thumbnail|right|Terahertz absorption spectrum in bulk GaAs computed using the THz Elliott formula. The vertical lines indicate the n''p''-1''s'' transition energies of which the first one (2''p''-1''s'' transition) is dominant. The 1''s''-band-gap-transition lies slightly above 4meV, whereas the dephasing constant is chosen to be &lt;math&gt;\hbar\gamma = 1.7\,\mathrm{meV}&lt;/math&gt;.]]

As discussed above, it is often meaningful to tune the electromagnetic field to be resonant with the transitions between two many-body states. For example, one can follow how a bound exciton is excited from its 1''s'' ground state to a 2''p'' state. In several semiconductor systems, one needs THz fields to induce such transitions. By starting from a steady-state configuration of electron–hole correlations, the diagonalization of THz-induced dynamics yields a THz absorption spectrum&lt;ref name="Kira2006" /&gt;

{{Equation box 1
|indent=:
|title='''THz Elliott formula'''
|equation=&lt;math&gt;
    \alpha_{\rm{THz}}(\omega) = \mathrm{Im}\left[ \frac{\sum_{\nu, \lambda} S^{\nu, \lambda} (\omega) \Delta N_{\nu,\lambda} - \left[ S^{\nu, \lambda}(-\omega) \Delta N_{\nu,\lambda}\right]^{\star} }{ \omega (\hbar \omega + \mathrm{i} \gamma(\omega))} \right]\;.
&lt;/math&gt;
|cellpadding
|border
|border colour = #50C878
|background colour = #ECFCF4}}

In this notation, the diagonal contributions &lt;math&gt;\Delta N_{\lambda, \lambda}&lt;/math&gt; determine the population of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; excitons. The off-diagonal &lt;math&gt;\Delta N_{\nu, \lambda\neq \nu}&lt;/math&gt; elements formally determine transition amplitudes between two exciton states &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda \neq \nu&lt;/math&gt;. For elevated densities, &lt;math&gt;\Delta N_{\nu, \lambda\neq \nu}&lt;/math&gt; build up spontaneously and they describe correlated [[Plasma (physics)|electron–hole plasma]] that is a state where electrons and holes move with respect to each other without forming bound pairs.&lt;ref name="Kira2006" /&gt;

In contrast to optical absorption and photoluminescence, THz absorption may involve all exciton states. This can be seen from the spectral response function

&lt;math&gt;
S^{\nu, \lambda} (\omega) = \sum_\beta \frac{ (E_\beta-E_\nu) J_{\nu \beta} J_{\beta \lambda} }{E_\beta - E_\nu - \hbar \omega - \mathrm{i} \gamma_{\lambda,\nu}(\omega)}
&lt;/math&gt;

that contains the current-matrix elements &lt;math&gt;J_{\nu \beta} \propto \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \phi^\star_\nu({\mathbf{k}}) {\mathbf{k}} \cdot {\mathbf{k}}_{\rm THz} \phi_\beta({\mathbf{k}})&lt;/math&gt; between two exciton states.  The unit vector &lt;math&gt;{\mathbf{k}}_{\rm THz}&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the direction of the THz field. This leads to dipole [[selection rules]] among exciton states, in full analog to the atomic dipole [[selection rules]]. Each allowed transition produces a resonance in &lt;math&gt;S^{\nu, \lambda} (\omega)&lt;/math&gt; and the resonance width is determined by a dephasing constant &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\lambda,\nu}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; that generally depends on exciton states involved and the THz frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. The THz response also contains &lt;math&gt;\gamma(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; that stems from the decay constant of macroscopic THz currents.&lt;ref name="Kira2006" /&gt;

In contrast to optical and photoluminescence spectroscopy, THz absorption can directly measure the presence of exciton populations  in full analogy to atomic spectroscopy.&lt;ref name="TimuskNavarro1978"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the presence of a pronounced 1''s''-to-2''p'' resonance in THz absorption uniquely identifies the presence of excitons as detected experimentally in Ref.&lt;ref name="KaindlCarnahan2003"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As a major difference to atomic spectroscopy, semiconductor resonances contain a strong excitation-induced dephasing that produces much broader resonances than in atomic spectroscopy. In fact, one typically can resolve only one 1''s''-to-2''p'' resonance because the dephasing constant &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{\nu,\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; is broader than energetic spacing of n-''p'' and (n+1)-''p'' states making 1''s''-to-n-''p'' and 1''s''-to-(n+1)''p'' resonances merge into one asymmetric tail.

The '''International Society for the Study of Individual Differences''' ('''ISSID''') is a scientific society founded in 1983 that fosters research on the measurement, structure, dynamics and biological bases of [[differential psychology|individual differences]] in temperament, [[intelligence quotient|intelligence]], attitudes, and abilities. Its first president (and one of its founders) was [[Hans Eysenck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Wiley-Blackwell Handbook of Individual Differences |last=von Stumm |first=Sophie |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2011 |pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The society investigates the major dimensions of individual differences in the context of experimental, physiological, pharmacological, clinical, medical, genetical, statistical, and social psychology. 

ISSID holds ''[[Personality and Individual Differences]]'' (''PAID'') as its official scientific journal[https://web.archive.org/web/20060615173619/http://issid.org/issid.files/ISSmem/newslet6.html] and hosts a conference on individual differences every other year. The current president is Philip Corr, professor of psychology at City University London.

'''Irrigation''' is the application of controlled amounts of water to plants at needed intervals. Irrigation helps to  grow [[agriculture|agricultural crops]], maintain [[landscape]]s, and [[revegetation|revegetate]] disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of less than average rainfall. Irrigation also has other uses in crop production, including frost protection,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Snyder | first1 = R. L. | last2 = Melo-Abreu | first2 = J.

Irrigation systems are also used for cooling [[livestock]], [[dust suppression]], disposal of [[sewage]], and in [[heap leaching|mining]]. Irrigation is often studied together with [[drainage]], which is the removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given area.

Irrigation has been a central feature of agriculture for over 5,000 years and is the product of many cultures. Historically, it was the basis for economies and societies across the globe, from Asia to the [[Southwestern United States]].

== History ==
[[File:David Roberts ancient fountain.jpg|thumb|upright|Animal-powered irrigation, Upper Egypt, ca. 1846]]

Archaeological investigation has found evidence of irrigation where natural [[rainfall]] was insufficient to support crops for [[rainfed agriculture]].

Irrigation was used as a means of manipulation of water in the alluvial plains of the [[Indus valley civilization]], the application of it is estimated to have begun around 4500 BC and drastically increased the size and prosperity of their agricultural settlements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=(Italy)|first1=Consiglio nazionale delle ricerche|last2=Science?|first2=Symposium on the Basis of Civilization—Water|title=The Basis of Civilization—water Science?|date=2004|publisher=International Association of Hydrological Science|isbn=9781901502572|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=JI65-MygMm0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;Sophisticated irrigation and water storage systems were developed by the Indus Valley Civilization, including artificial [[reservoir]]s at [[Girnar]] dated to 3000 BCE, and an early [[canal]] irrigation system from c. 2600 BCE. Large scale agriculture was practiced and an extensive network of canals was used for the purpose of irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=(Italy)|first1=Consiglio nazionale delle ricerche|last2=Science?|first2=Symposium on the Basis of Civilization—Water|title=The Basis of Civilization—water Science?|date=2004|publisher=International Association of Hydrological Science|isbn=9781901502572|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=JI65-MygMm0C&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=rodda+and+ubertini&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s9HtG9wNlc&amp;sig=CjJqRhHg3DO_8UN4CTDfEOfQXts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi4h-yspc3aAhUHo48KHeK1BUAQ6AEwA3oECAEQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=rodda%20and%20ubertini&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Ancient India Indus Valley Civilization| work =| publisher =Minnesota State University "e-museum"| url =http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/india/indus/elements.html| doi =| accessdate =2007-01-10| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070205113936/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/prehistory/india/indus/elements.html| archivedate =2007-02-05| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Perennial irrigation'' was practiced in the [[Mesopotamia]]n plain whereby crops were regularly watered throughout the [[growing season]] by coaxing water through a matrix of small channels formed in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Donald: ''A History of Engineering''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ancient Egyptians]] practiced ''Basin irrigation'' using the [[flooding of the Nile]] to inundate land plots which had been surrounded by dykes. The flood water was held until the fertile sediment had settled before the surplus was returned to the [[watercourse]].&lt;ref name=p19&gt;''p19'' Hill&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence of the ancient Egyptian [[pharaoh]] [[Amenemhet III]] in the [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|twelfth dynasty]] (about 1800 [[Common era|BCE]]) using the natural lake of the [[Faiyum Oasis]] as a reservoir to store surpluses of water for use during the dry seasons.  The lake swelled annually from flooding of the [[Nile]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Amenemhet III |work= |publisher=Britannica Concise |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9006076/Amenemhet-III |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510203748/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9006076/Amenemhet-III |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-05-10 |doi= |accessdate=2007-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sub-Saharan Africa]] irrigation reached the [[Niger River]] region cultures and civilizations by the first or second millennium BCE and was based on wet season flooding and water harvesting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/004/y0969e/y0969e03.htm |title=Traditional technologies |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-world.org/africa.htm |title=Africa, Emerging Civilizations In Sub-Sahara Africa.

''Terrace irrigation'' is evidenced in pre-Columbian America, early Syria, India, and China.&lt;ref name=p19 /&gt; In the Zana Valley of the [[Andes Mountains]] in [[Peru]], archaeologists found remains of three irrigation [[canal]]s [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] from the [[4th millennium BCE]], the 3rd millennium BCE and the 9th century [[Common era|CE]]. These canals are the earliest record of irrigation in the [[New World]]. Traces of a canal possibly dating from the [[5th millennium BCE]] were found under the 4th millennium canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=[[Tom Dillehay|Dillehay TD]], Eling HH Jr, Rossen J | title=Preceramic irrigation canals in the Peruvian Andes | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume=102 | issue=47 | year=2005 | pages=17241–4 | pmid=16284247 | doi=10.1073/pnas.0508583102 | pmc=1288011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Persia]] (modern day [[Iran]]) used irrigation as far back as the [[6th millennium BCE]] to grow barley in areas where natural rainfall was insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = | authorlink = | title =The History of Technology&amp;nbsp;– Irrigation | publisher =Encyclopædia Britannica, 1994 edition | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qanat]]s, developed in ancient [[Persia]] in about 800 BCE, are among the oldest known irrigation methods still in use today.

The irrigation works of ancient [[Sri Lanka]], the earliest dating from about 300 BCE, in the reign of King [[Pandukabhaya]] and under continuous development for the next thousand years, were one of the most complex irrigation systems of the ancient world. In addition to underground canals, the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] were the first to build completely artificial reservoirs to store water. These reservoirs and canal systems were used primarily to irrigate [[Paddy field|paddy fields]] which require a lot of water to cultivate. Most of these irrigation systems still exist undamaged up to now, in [[Anuradhapura]] and [[Polonnaruwa]], because of the advanced and precise engineering. The system was extensively restored and further extended during the reign of King [[Parakrama Bahu]] (1153–1186 [[Common era|CE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =de Silva | first =Sena | authorlink = | title =Reservoirs of Sri Lanka and their fisheries | work = | publisher =UN Food and Agriculture Organization | year= 1998 | url =http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/T0028E/T0028E03.htm | doi = | accessdate = 2007-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known [[hydraulic]] engineers of [[China]] were [[Sunshu Ao]] (6th century BCE) of the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Ximen Bao]] (5th century BCE) of the [[Warring States]] period, both of whom worked on large irrigation projects. In the [[Sichuan]] region belonging to the [[Qin (state)|State of Qin]] of ancient China, the [[Dujiangyan Irrigation System]] devised by the Qin Chinese hydrologist and irrigation engineer [[Li Bing]] was built in 256 BCE to irrigate a vast area of farmland that today still supplies water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | title =China&amp;nbsp;– history | publisher =Encyclopædia Britannica,1994 edition | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 2nd century AD, during the [[Han Dynasty]], the Chinese also used [[chain pump]]s that lifted water from a lower elevation to a higher one.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 344 346"&gt;Needham, Joseph (1986).

In 15th century [[Joseon|Korea]], the world's first rain gauge, ''uryanggye'' ([[Korean language|Korean]]:[[Hangul|우량계]]), was invented in 1441. The inventor was [[Jang Yeong-sil]], a Korean engineer of the [[Joseon Dynasty]], under the active direction of the king, [[Sejong the Great]]. It was installed in irrigation tanks as part of a nationwide system to measure and collect rainfall for agricultural applications. With this instrument, planners and farmers could make better use of the information gathered in the survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Baek Seok-gi 백석기 | first = | authorlink = | title =Jang Yeong-sil 장영실 | publisher =Woongjin Wiin Jeon-gi 웅진위인전기 11.

The earliest agricultural irrigation canal system known in the U.S. dates to between 1200 B.C. and 800 B.C. and was discovered in Marana, Arizona (adjacent to Tucson) in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0909/trenches/canals.html|title=Earliest Canals in America – Archaeology Magazine Archive|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The irrigation canal system predates the Hohokam culture by two thousand years and belongs to an unidentified culture. In North America, the Hohokam were the only culture known to rely on irrigation canals to water their crops, and their irrigation systems supported the largest population in the Southwest by AD 1300. The Hohokam constructed an assortment of simple canals combined with [[weirs]] in their various agricultural pursuits. Between the 7th and 14th centuries, they also built and maintained extensive irrigation networks along the lower Salt and middle Gila rivers that rivaled the complexity of those used in the ancient Near East, Egypt, and China. These were constructed using relatively simple excavation tools, without the benefit of advanced engineering technologies, and achieved drops of a few feet per mile, balancing erosion and siltation. The Hohokam cultivated varieties of cotton, tobacco, maize, beans and squash, as well as harvested an assortment of wild plants. Late in the Hohokam Chronological Sequence, they also used extensive dry-farming systems, primarily to grow [[Agave murpheyi|agave]] for food and fiber. Their reliance on agricultural strategies based on canal irrigation, vital in their less than hospitable desert environment and arid climate, provided the basis for the aggregation of rural populations into stable urban centers.&lt;ref&gt;James M.

In year 2000, the total fertile land was 2,788,000&amp;nbsp;km² (689 million acres) and it was equipped with irrigation infrastructure worldwide. About 68% of this area is in Asia, 17% in the Americas, 9% in Europe, 5% in Africa and 1% in Oceania. The largest contiguous areas of high irrigation density are found:

:* In Northern India and Pakistan along the Ganges and Indus rivers
:* In the Hai He, Huang He and Yangtze basins in China

== Types of irrigation==
There are several methods of irrigation.  They vary in how the water is supplied to the plants.  The goal is to apply the water to the plants as uniformly as possible, so that each plant has the amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little.

=== Surface irrigation===
{{Main|Surface irrigation}}
[[File:LevelBasinFloodIrrigation.JPG|thumb|Basin flood irrigation of wheat]]

Surface irrigation is the oldest form of irrigation and has been in use for thousands of years.  In ''surface'' (''furrow'', ''flood'', or ''level basin'') irrigation systems, water moves across the surface of an  agricultural lands, in order to wet it and infiltrate into the soil. Surface irrigation can be subdivided into furrow,'' borderstrip or basin irrigation''. It is often called ''flood irrigation'' when the irrigation results in flooding or near flooding of the cultivated land. Historically, this has been the most common method of irrigating agricultural land and is still used in most parts of the world.

Where water levels from the irrigation source permit, the levels are controlled by dikes, usually plugged by soil. This is often seen in terraced rice fields (rice paddies), where the method is used to flood or control the level of water in each distinct field. In some cases, the water is pumped, or lifted by human or animal power to the level of the land. The water application efficiency of surface irrigation is typically lower than other forms of irrigation.
[[File:Residential flood irrigation in Phoenix, Arizona, in the United States of America.jpg|thumb|Residential flood irrigation in Phoenix, Arizona]]
Surface irrigation is even used to water landscapes in certain areas, for example, in and around [[Phoenix, Arizona]].  The irrigated area is surrounded by a [[berm]] and the water is delivered according to a schedule set by a local [[irrigation district]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flood Irrigation Service|url=http://www.tempe.gov/home/showdocument?id=3194|publisher=City of Tempe, Arizona|accessdate=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micro-irrigation===
{{Main|Micro-irrigation}}
[[File:Dripperwithdrop.png|thumb|Drip irrigation – a dripper in action]]
''Micro-irrigation'', sometimes called '''localized irrigation''', '''low volume irrigation''', or '''trickle irrigation''' is a system where water is distributed under low pressure through a piped network, in a pre-determined pattern, and applied as a small discharge to each plant or adjacent to it. Traditional drip irrigation using individual emitters, subsurface drip irrigation (SDI), micro-spray or micro-sprinkler irrigation, and mini-bubbler irrigation all belong to this category of irrigation methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Frenken | first1 = K. | title = Irrigation in Africa in figures&amp;nbsp;– AQUASTAT Survey&amp;nbsp;– 2005 | booktitle = Water Report 29 | publisher = Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations | year= 2005 | url = ftp://ftp.fao.org/agl/aglw/docs/wr29_eng.pdf | format=PDF| isbn = 92-5-105414-2 | accessdate = 2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Drip irrigation ====
[[File:dripirrigation.gif|thumb|left|Drip irrigation layout and its parts]]
{{Main|Drip irrigation}}
[[File:Sprinkler Irrigation - Sprinkler head.JPG|thumb|Micro-sprinkler]]
Drip (or micro) irrigation, also known as trickle irrigation, functions as its name suggests. In this system water falls drop by drop just at the position of roots. Water is delivered at or near the [[root]] zone of plants, drop by drop. This method can be the most water-efficient method of irrigation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Provenzano | first = Giuseppe | title = Using HYDRUS-2D Simulation Model to Evaluate Wetted Soil Volume in Subsurface Drip Irrigation Systems | journal = J. Irrig. Drain Eng. | volume = 133 | issue = 4 | pages = 342–350 | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9437(2007)133:4(342)}}&lt;/ref&gt; if managed properly, evaporation and runoff are minimized. The field [[water efficiency]] of drip irrigation is typically in the range of 80 to 90 percent when managed correctly.

In modern agriculture, drip irrigation is often combined with [[plastic mulch]], further reducing evaporation, and is also the means of delivery of fertilizer. The process is known as ''[[fertigation]]''.

Deep percolation, where water moves below the root zone, can occur if a drip system is operated for too long or if the delivery rate is too high. Drip irrigation methods range from very high-tech and computerized to low-tech and labor-intensive. Lower water pressures are usually needed than for most other types of systems, with the exception of low energy center pivot systems and surface irrigation systems, and the system can be designed for uniformity throughout a field or for precise water delivery to individual plants in a landscape containing a mix of plant species. Although it is difficult to regulate pressure on steep slopes, pressure compensating [[Drip irrigation#Emitter|emitters]] are available, so the field does not have to be level. High-tech solutions involve precisely calibrated emitters located along lines of tubing that extend from a computerized set of [[valves]].

=== Sprinkler irrigation ===
[[File:Crop sprinklers Rio Vista California 15 Jul 2004-002.jpg|thumb|Crop sprinklers near [[Rio Vista, California]]]]
[[File:TravellingSprinkler.JPG|thumb|A traveling sprinkler at Millets Farm Centre, [[Oxfordshire]], United Kingdom]]
{{Further|Irrigation sprinkler}}
In ''sprinkler'' or overhead irrigation, water is piped to one or more central locations within the field and distributed by overhead high-pressure sprinklers or guns. A system using sprinklers, sprays, or guns mounted overhead on permanently installed risers is often referred to as a ''solid-set'' irrigation system. Higher pressure sprinklers that rotate are called ''rotors'' and are driven by a ball drive, gear drive, or impact mechanism. Rotors can be designed to rotate in a full or partial circle. Guns are similar to rotors, except that they generally operate at very high pressures of 275 to 900 kPa (40 to 130 psi) and flows of 3 to 76 L/s (50 to 1200 US gal/min), usually with nozzle diameters in the range of 10 to 50&amp;nbsp;mm (0.5 to 1.9 in). Guns are used not only for irrigation, but also for industrial applications such as dust suppression and [[logging]].

Sprinklers can also be mounted on moving platforms connected to the water source by a hose. Automatically moving wheeled systems known as ''traveling sprinklers'' may irrigate areas such as small farms, sports fields, parks, pastures, and cemeteries unattended. Most of these use a length of polyethylene tubing wound on a steel drum. As the tubing is wound on the drum powered by the irrigation water or a small gas engine, the sprinkler is pulled across the field. When the sprinkler arrives back at the reel the system shuts off. This type of system is known to most people as a "waterreel" traveling irrigation sprinkler and they are used extensively for dust suppression, irrigation, and land application of waste water.

Other travelers use a flat rubber hose that is dragged along behind while the sprinkler platform is pulled by a cable.

==== Center pivot ====

{{Main|Center pivot irrigation}}
[[File:Crop Triangle.jpg|alt=Center pivot irrigation|center|thumb|[[Center pivot irrigation]]]]
Center pivot irrigation is a form of sprinkler irrigation utilising several segments of pipe (usually galvanized steel or aluminium) joined together and supported by [[truss]]es, mounted on wheeled towers with sprinklers positioned along its length.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The system moves in a circular pattern and is fed with water from the pivot point at the center of the arc. These systems are found and used in all parts of the world and allow irrigation of all types of terrain. Newer systems have drop sprinkler heads as shown in the image that follows.

{{As of | 2017}} most center pivot systems have drops hanging from a U-shaped pipe attached at the top of the pipe with sprinkler heads that are positioned a few feet (at most) above the crop, thus limiting evaporative losses. Drops can also be used with drag hoses or bubblers that deposit the water directly on the ground between crops. Crops are often planted in a circle to conform to the center pivot. This type of system is known as LEPA ([[Low Energy Precision Application]]). Originally, most center pivots were water-powered. These were replaced by hydraulic systems (''[[T-L Irrigation]]'') and electric-motor-driven systems (Reinke, Valley, Zimmatic). Many modern pivots feature [[GPS]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.agriculture.com/machinery/irrigation-equipment/gps-swing-arms-prove-their-worth|title=GPS SWING ARMS PROVE THEIR WORTH|last=Gaines|first=Tharran|date=January 7, 2017|website=Successful Farming|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Irrigation by lateral move (side roll, wheel line, wheelmove)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peters|first1=Troy|title=Managing Wheel ‐ Lines and Hand ‐ Lines for High Profitability|url=http://irrigation.wsu.edu/Content/Fact-Sheets/Set-Move-Management.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=Robert|title=Wheelmove Sprinkler Irrigation Operation and Management|url=http://extension.usu.edu/files/publications/publication/ENGR_BIE_WM_08.pdf|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====

A ''series of pipes, each with a wheel'' of about 1.5 m diameter permanently affixed to its midpoint, and sprinklers along its length, are coupled together. Water is supplied at one end using a large hose. After sufficient irrigation has been applied to one strip of the field, the hose is removed, the water drained from the system, and the assembly rolled either by hand or with a purpose-built mechanism, so that the sprinklers are moved to a different position across the field. The hose is reconnected. The process is repeated in a pattern until the whole field has been irrigated.

This system is less expensive to install than a center pivot, but much more labor-intensive to operate – it does not travel automatically across the field: it applies water in a stationary strip, must be drained, and then rolled to a new strip.   Most systems use 100 or 130&amp;nbsp;mm (4 or 5 inch) diameter aluminum pipe.  The pipe doubles both as water transport and as an axle for rotating all the wheels.  A drive system (often found near the centre of the wheel line) rotates the clamped-together pipe sections as a single axle, rolling the whole wheel line.  Manual adjustment of individual wheel positions may be necessary if the system becomes misaligned.

Wheel line systems are limited in the amount of water they can carry, and limited in the height of crops that can be irrigated.  One useful feature of a lateral move system is that it consists of sections that can be easily disconnected, adapting to field shape as the line is moved. They are most often used for small, rectilinear, or oddly-shaped fields, hilly or mountainous regions, or in regions where labor is inexpensive.

==== Lawn sprinkler systems ====

A lawn sprinkler system is permanently installed, as opposed to a hose-end sprinkler, which is portable.  Sprinkler systems are installed in residential lawns, in commercial landscapes, for churches and schools, in public parks and cemeteries, and on [[golf course]]s. Most of the components of these irrigation systems are hidden under ground, since aesthetics are important in a landscape.  A typical lawn sprinkler system will consist of one or more zones, limited in size by the capacity of the water source.  Each zone will cover a designated portion of the landscape.  Sections of the landscape will usually be divided by [[microclimate]], type of plant material, and type of irrigation equipment.  A landscape irrigation system may also include zones containing drip irrigation, bubblers, or other types of equipment besides sprinklers.

Although manual systems are still used, most lawn sprinkler systems may be operated automatically using an [[Controller (irrigation)|irrigation controller]], sometimes called a clock or timer.  Most automatic systems employ electric [[solenoid valve]]s.  Each zone has one or more of these valves that are wired to the controller.  When the controller sends power to the valve, the valve opens, allowing water to flow to the sprinklers in that zone.

There are two main types of sprinklers used in lawn irrigation, pop-up spray heads and rotors.  Spray heads have a fixed spray pattern, while rotors have one or more streams that rotate.  Spray heads are used to cover smaller areas, while rotors are used for larger areas.  Golf course rotors are sometimes so large that a single sprinkler is combined with a valve and called a 'valve in head'.  When used in a turf area, the sprinklers are installed with the top of the head flush with the ground surface.  When the system is pressurized, the head will pop up out of the ground and water the desired area until the valve closes and shuts off that zone. Once there is no more pressure in the lateral line, the sprinkler head will retract back into the ground. In flower beds or shrub areas, sprinklers may be mounted on above ground risers or even taller pop-up sprinklers may be used and installed flush as in a lawn area.
[[File:Irrigational sprinkler.jpg|thumb|An [[impact sprinkler]] watering a lawn, an example of a hose-end sprinkler.]]

==== Hose-end sprinklers ====

There are many types of hose-end sprinklers.  Many of them are smaller versions of larger agricultural and landscape sprinklers, sized to work with a typical garden hose.  Some have a spiked base allowing them to be temporarily stuck in the ground, while others have a sled base designed to be dragged while attached to the hose.

=== Subirrigation ===

[[Subirrigation]] has been used for many years in field crops in areas with high [[water table]]s. It is a method of artificially raising the water table to allow the [[soil]] to be [[wikt:moisten|moistened]] from below the plants' [[root]] zone. Often those systems are located on permanent grasslands in lowlands or river valleys and combined with drainage infrastructure. A system of pumping stations, canals, weirs and gates allows it to increase or decrease the water level in a network of ditches and thereby control the water table.

Subirrigation is also used in [[commerce|commercial]] [[greenhouse]] production, usually for [[potted plant]]s. Water is delivered from below, absorbed upwards, and the excess collected for recycling. Typically, a solution of water and [[nutrient]]s floods a container or flows through a trough for a short period of time, 10–20 minutes, and is then pumped back into a holding [[Water tank|tank]] for reuse. Sub-irrigation in greenhouses requires fairly sophisticated, expensive equipment and management. Advantages are water and nutrient conservation, and labor savings through reduced system maintenance and [[automation]]. It is similar in principle and action to subsurface basin irrigation.

Another type of subirrigation is the self-watering container, also known as a [[sub-irrigated planter]].  This consists of a planter suspended over a reservoir with some type of wicking material such as a polyester rope.  The water is drawn up the wick through capillary action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.entheogen.com/forum/showthread.php?t=13076 |title=Polyester ropes natural irrigation technique |publisher=Entheogen.com |accessdate=2012-06-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412031536/http://www.entheogen.com/forum/showthread.php?t=13076 |archivedate=April 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Self-watering-recycled-plant-pot-for-growing-herbs/ |title=DIY instructions for making self-watering system using ropes |publisher=Instructables.com |date=2008-03-17 |accessdate=2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Subsurface textile irrigation ====
{{Main|Subsurface textile irrigation}}
[[File:SSTI Cross-Section.png|thumb|Diagram showing the structure of an example SSTI installation]]
Subsurface Textile Irrigation (SSTI) is a technology designed specifically for subirrigation in all soil textures from desert sands to heavy clays. A typical subsurface textile irrigation system has an impermeable base layer (usually [[polyethylene]] or [[polypropylene]]), a drip line running along that base, a layer of [[geotextile]] on top of the drip line and, finally, a narrow impermeable layer on top of the geotextile (see diagram). Unlike standard drip irrigation, the spacing of emitters in the drip pipe is not critical as the geotextile moves the water along the fabric up to 2&amp;nbsp;m from the dripper.  The impermeable layer effectively creates an artificial water table.

== Water sources ==
[[File:Pump-enabled Riverside Irrigation in Comilla, Bangladesh, 25 April 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|right|Irrigation is underway by [[Pump|pump-enabled]] extraction directly from [[Gumti River (Tripura)|the Gumti]], seen in the background, in [[Comilla District|Comilla]], [[Bangladesh]].]]

Irrigation water can come from groundwater (extracted from [[Spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] or by using [[Water well|wells]]), from surface water (withdrawn from [[rivers]], [[lake]]s or [[reservoirs]]) or from non-conventional sources like [[reclaimed water|treated wastewater]], [[desalinated water]], [[drainage water]], or [[fog collection]]. A special form of irrigation using surface water is [[spate irrigation]], also called [[floodwater harvesting]]. In case of a flood (spate), water is diverted to normally dry river beds (wadis) using a network of dams, gates and channels and spread over large areas. The moisture stored in the soil will be used thereafter to grow crops. Spate irrigation areas are in particular located in semi-arid or arid, mountainous regions. While floodwater harvesting belongs to the accepted irrigation methods, [[rainwater harvesting]] is usually not considered as a form of irrigation. Rainwater harvesting is the collection of runoff water from roofs or unused land and the concentration of this.

Around 90% of wastewater produced globally remains untreated, causing widespread water [[pollution]], especially in low-income countries. Increasingly, agriculture uses untreated wastewater as a source of irrigation water. Cities provide lucrative markets for fresh produce, so are attractive to farmers. However, because agriculture has to compete for increasingly scarce water resources with industry and municipal users (see Water scarcity below), there is often no alternative for farmers but to use water polluted with urban waste, including sewage, directly to water their crops. Significant health hazards can result from using water loaded with pathogens in this way, especially if people eat raw vegetables that have been irrigated with the polluted water. The [[International Water Management Institute]] has worked in India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Ghana, Ethiopia, Mexico and other countries on various projects aimed at assessing and reducing risks of wastewater irrigation. They advocate a 'multiple-barrier' approach to wastewater use, where farmers are encouraged to adopt various risk-reducing behaviours. These include ceasing irrigation a few days before harvesting to allow pathogens to die off in the sunlight, applying water carefully so it does not contaminate leaves likely to be eaten raw, cleaning vegetables with disinfectant or allowing fecal sludge used in farming to dry before being used as a human manure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/Publications/Water_Issue_Briefs/index.aspx Wastewater use in agriculture: ''Not only an issue where water is scarce!''] [[International Water Management Institute]]'', 2010. Water Issue Brief 4&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] has developed guidelines for safe water use.

There are numerous benefits of using [[recycled water]] for irrigation, including the low cost (when compared to other sources, particularly in an urban area), consistency of supply (regardless of season, climatic conditions and associated water restrictions), and general consistency of quality. Irrigation of recycled wastewater is also considered as a means for plant fertilization and particularly nutrient supplementation. This approach carries with it a risk of soil and water pollution through excessive wastewater application. Hence, a detailed understanding of soil water conditions is essential for effective utilization of wastewater for irrigation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/17/4339/2013/hess-17-4339-2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In countries where humid air sweeps through at night, water can be obtained by [[condensation]] onto cold surfaces. This is practiced in the vineyards at [[Lanzarote]] using stones to condense water.  Fog collectors are also made of canvas or foil sheets.  Using condensate from air conditioning units as a water source is also becoming more popular in large urban areas.

[[File:Vale do São Francisco Pernanbuco.jpg|thumb|Grapes in [[Petrolina]], only made possible in this [[semi arid]] area by [[drip irrigation]]]]

== Efficiency ==

Modern irrigation methods are efficient enough to supply the entire field uniformly with water, so that each plant has the amount of water it needs, neither too much nor too little.&lt;ref name="efficiency"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agriwaterpedia.info/wiki/Water_use_efficiency|title=Water use efficiency - agriwaterpedia.info|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water use efficiency in the field can be determined as follows:

* Field Water Efficiency (%) = (Water Transpired by Crop ÷ Water Applied to Field) x 100

Until 1960s, the common perception was that water was an infinite resource. At that time, there were fewer than half the current number of people on the planet. People were not as wealthy as today, consumed fewer calories and [[meat consumption|ate less meat]], so less water was needed to produce their food. They required a third of the volume of water we presently take from rivers. Today, the competition for [[water resources]] is much more intense. This is because there are now [[human overpopulation|more than seven billion people]] on the planet, their consumption of water-thirsty meat and vegetables is rising, and there is increasing competition for water from [[industry]], [[urbanisation]] and [[biofuel crops]]. To avoid a global [[water crisis]], farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing [[food security|demands for food]], while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;Chartres, C. and Varma, S.

Successful agriculture is dependent upon farmers having sufficient access to water. However, water scarcity is already a critical constraint to farming in many parts of the world. With regards to agriculture, the [http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/reengaging-agricultural-water-management-challenges-and-options/ World Bank] targets food production and water management as an increasingly global issue that is fostering a growing debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.worldbank.org/water/publications/reengaging-agricultural-water-management-challenges-and-options |title=Reengaging in Agricultural Water Management: Challenges and Options |publisher=The World Bank | accessdate=2011-10-30|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Physical water scarcity]] is where there is not enough water to meet all demands, including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively. Arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity. It also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed. This can happen where there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure, usually for irrigation. Symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining [[groundwater]]. Economic scarcity, meanwhile, is caused by a lack of investment in water or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water. Symptoms of [[economic water scarcity]] include a lack of infrastructure, with people often having to fetch water from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses. Some 2.8 billion people currently live in water-scarce areas.&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].''

{{Main|Environmental impact of irrigation}}

Irrigation schemes involve solving numerous engineering and economic problems while minimizing negative environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;ILRI, 1989, Effectiveness and Social/Environmental Impacts of Irrigation Projects: a Review. In: Annual Report 1988, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands, pp. 18 – 34 . On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/irreff.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Overdrafting]] (depletion) of underground [[aquifers]]. In the mid-20th century, the advent of diesel and electric motors led to systems that could pump [[groundwater]] out of major [[aquifer]]s faster than [[drainage basin]]s could refill them. This can lead to permanent loss of aquifer capacity, decreased water quality, ground subsidence, and other problems. The future of food production in such areas as the [[North China Plain]], the [[Punjab region|Punjab]], and the [[Great Plains]] of the US is threatened by this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = A new report says we're draining our aquifers faster than ever|date = 2013-06-22|url = https://www.hcn.org/issues/45.12/a-new-report-says-were-draining-our-aquifers-faster-than-ever|accessdate = 2014-02-11|newspaper = High Country News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.groundwatergovernance.org/fileadmin/user_upload/groundwatergovernance/docs/Thematic_papers/GWG_Thematic_Paper_4.pdf|title = Management of aquifer recharge and discharge processes and aquifer storage equilibrium|quote = Groundwater storage is shown to be declining in all populated continents...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ground [[subsidence]] (e.g. [[New Orleans, Louisiana]])
* Underirrigation or irrigation giving only just enough water for the plant (e.g. in drip line irrigation) gives poor [[soil salinity control]] which leads to increased [[soil salinity]] with consequent buildup of toxic salts on soil surface in areas with high evaporation. This requires either [[leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] to remove these salts and a method of [[drainage]] to carry the salts away. When using drip lines, the leaching is best done regularly at certain intervals (with only a slight excess of water), so that the salt is flushed back under the plant's roots.&lt;ref&gt;EOS magazine, september 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Water Council&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact on society ==
A 2016 study found that countries whose agriculture depended on irrigation are more likely to be autocratic than other countries. The authors of the study "argue that the effect has historical origins: irrigation allowed landed elites in arid areas to monopolize water and arable land. This made elites more powerful and better able to oppose democratization."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bentzen|first=Jeanet Sinding|last2=Kaarsen|first2=Nicolai|last3=Wingender|first3=Asger Moll|date=2016-06-01|title=Irrigation and Autocracy|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jeea.12173/abstract|journal=Journal of the European Economic Association|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/jeea.12173|issn=1542-4774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5877">The '''Kew Rule''' was used by some authors to determine the application of synonymous names in botanical nomenclature up to about 1906,&lt;ref name=chron&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipni.org/IK_chronology.html |title=Index Kewensis chronology |publisher=International Plant Names Index |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was and still is contrary to [[Nomenclature code|codes]] of [[botanical nomenclature]] including the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]. [[Index Kewensis]], a publication that aimed to list all [[botanical names]] for [[seed plant]]s at the ranks of [[species]] and [[genus]], used the Kew Rule until its ''Supplement IV'' was published in 1913 (prepared 1906–1910).&lt;ref name=chron/&gt;

The Kew Rule applied rules of [[Priority (nomenclature)|priority]] in a more flexible way, so that when transferring a species to a new genus, there was no requirement to retain the epithet of the original species name, and future priority of the new name was counted from the time the species was transferred to the new genus.&lt;ref name=Reveal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipni.org/understand_the_data.html |title=Understanding the Index Kewensis data|publisher=International Plant Names Index|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect has been summarized as "nomenclature used by an established monographer or in a major publication should be adopted".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Reveal, J.L.|year=2012|title=A divulgation of ignored or forgotten binomials |journal=Phytoneuron |volume=2012-28 |issue=1–64 |url=http://www.phytoneuron.net/PhytoN-Divulgation.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrary to the modern article 11.4 of the Code of Nomenclature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011|publisher=A.R.G.

==History==

===Beginnings===
The first discussion in print of what was to become known as the Kew Rule appears to have occurred in 1877 between [[Henry Trimen]] and [[Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle]].&lt;ref name=Nicolson&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nicolson, D.H.|year=1991|title=A History of Botanical Nomenclature |journal=Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=33–56 |jstor=2399589 |doi=10.2307/2399589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trimen did not think it was reasonable for older names discovered in the literature to destabilize the nomenclature that had been well accepted:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trimen, H.|year=1877|title=Editor's response to A. de Candolle's letter to the journal on the subject of Botanical Nomenclature|journal=Journal of Botany |volume=15 |pages=242–243|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/108518#page/254/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Probably all botanists are agreed that it is very desirable to retain when possible old specific names, but some of the best authors do not certainly consider themselves bound by any generally accepted rule in this matter. Still less will they be inclined to allow that a writer is at liberty, as M. de Candolle thinks, to reject the specific appellations made by an author whose genera are accepted, in favour of older ones in other genera. It will appear to such that to do this is to needlessly create in each case another synonym.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===The end===
{{expand section|reason=needs discussion of the American Code and of the confused period when the international code was somewhat ignored|date=September 2013}}
The first botanical code of nomenclature that declared itself to be binding was the 1906 ''Règles internationales de la nomenclature botanique adoptées par le Congres International de Botanique de Vienne 1905'' that followed from the 1905 [[International Botanical Congress]].&lt;ref name=Nicolson/&gt; The Kew Rule was outlawed by this code.

The end of the Kew Rule brought about considerable upheaval in botanical nomenclature. Many new species names were coined to resurrect older epithets, for example, in 1917 [[Willis Linn Jepson|Willis Jepson]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jepson, W. L.|title=Taxonomic notes on California plants |journal=Madroño|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132036#page/83/mode/1up |volume=1|pages=61–62|year=1917}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;""The plant so long known as ''[[Brodiaea grandiflora]]'' Smith ... [was] first published as ''Hookera coronaria'' Salisbury (1806). The correct name, then, is ''Brodiaea coronaria'' Jepson, ''[[n. comb.]]''"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Names that had previously been [[conserved name|conserved]] to improve the stability of well-known plant names often now no longer required conservation, and other names that had been formed using the Kew Rule and had become well known, were illegitimate. The entire previous list of conserved and rejected names was consequently replaced in 1959 with a reworked list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Rickett, H.W. |author2=Stafleu, F.A. |year=1959|title=Nomina generica conservanda et rejicienda spermatophytorum |journal=Taxon |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=213–243 |doi=10.2307/1217883}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously overlooked botanical literature has continued to yield new examples of forgotten older names for more than 100 years since the Kew Rule was banished from the International Code of Nomenclature.&lt;ref name=Reveal/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5996">The '''law of averages''' is the fallacious belief that a particular outcome or event is inevitable or certain simply because it is statistically possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Law of Averages | publisher=Cambridge Dictionary | url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/law-of-averages}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Law of Averages | publisher=Merriam Webster | url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/law%20of%20averages}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on context or application it can be considered a valid common-sense observation or a misunderstanding of probability. This notion can lead to the [[gambler's fallacy]] when one becomes convinced that a particular outcome must come soon simply because it has not occurred recently (e.g. believing that because three consecutive coin flips yielded ''heads'', the next coin flip must be virtually guaranteed to be ''tails'').

As invoked in everyday life, the "law" usually reflects [[wishful thinking]] or a poor understanding of [[statistics]] rather than any mathematical principle. While there is a real [[Law of large numbers|theorem]] that a random variable will reflect its underlying probability over a very large sample, the law of averages typically assumes that unnatural short-term "balance" must occur.&lt;ref name="Rees"&gt;Rees, D.G. (2001) ''Essential Statistics'', 4th edition, Chapman &amp; Hall/CRC.  {{ISBN|1-58488-007-4}} (p.48)&lt;/ref&gt; Typical applications also generally assume no [[Skewness|bias]] in the underlying probability distribution, which is frequently at odds with the [[empirical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/law-of-averages&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===Gambler's fallacy===
The [[gambler's fallacy]] is a particular misapplication of the law of averages in which the gambler believes that a particular outcome is more likely because it has not happened recently, or (conversely) that because a particular outcome has recently occurred, it will be less likely in the immediate future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidschwartz/2018/06/04/how-casinos-use-math-to-make-money-when-you-play-the-slots/#38cfaa0394d0|title=How Casinos Use Math To Make Money When You Play The Slots|last=Schwartz|first=David G.|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example, consider a [[roulette]] wheel that has landed on red in three consecutive spins. An onlooker might apply the law of averages to conclude that on its next spin it must (or at least is much more likely to) land on black. Of course, the wheel has no memory and its probabilities do not change according to past results. So even if the wheel has landed on red in ten or a hundred consecutive spins, the probability that the next spin will be black is still no more than 48.6% (assuming a ''fair'' European wheel with only one green zero; it would be exactly 50% if there were no green zero and the wheel were fair, and 47.4% for a fair American wheel with one green "0" and one green "00"). Similarly, there is no statistical basis for the belief that lottery numbers which haven't appeared recently are due to appear soon. (There is some value in choosing lottery numbers that are, in general, less ''popular'' than others — not because they are any more or less likely to come up, but because the largest prizes are usually shared among all of the people who chose the winning numbers. The unpopular numbers are just as likely to come up as the popular numbers are, and in the event of a big win, one would likely have to share it with fewer other people.)

On the other hand, in some locales, modern [[slot machine]]s are rigged so they ''do'' give wins a certain proportion of the time — the results are not truly random. This is carefully managed so as to encourage people to keep playing, while the casino takes its designated amount of profit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/travel/top-10-secrets-casinos-dont-want-you-to-know|title=Top 10 secrets casinos don’t want you to know|date=2015-12-08|work=Fox News|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expectation values===
Another application of the law of averages is a belief that a sample's behaviour must line up with the [[expected value]] based on population statistics. For example, suppose a [[fair coin]] is flipped 100 times. Using the law of averages, one might predict that there will be 50 heads and 50 tails. While this is the single most likely outcome, there is only an 8% chance of it occurring. Predictions based on the law of averages are even less useful if the sample [[bias (statistics)|does not reflect the population]].

===Repetition of trials===
In this example, one tries to increase the probability of a rare event occurring at least once by carrying out more trials. For example, a job seeker might argue, "If I send my résumé to enough places, the law of averages says that someone will eventually hire me." Assuming a non-zero probability, it is true that conducting more trials increases the overall likelihood of the desired outcome. However, there is no particular number of trials that guarantees that outcome; rather, the probability that it will already have occurred [[asymptote|approaches but never quite reaches]] 100%.

===Chicago Cubs===
The [[Steve Goodman]] song "A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request" mentions the Law of Averages in reference to the [[Chicago Cubs]] lack of championship success. At the time Goodman recorded the song in 1981, the Cubs had not won a [[National League]] championship since the year the United States dropped [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|the atomic bomb on Japan]] (1945), and had not won a [[World Series]] since [[1908 World Series|1908]]. This futility would continue until the Cubs would finally win both in [[2016 Chicago Cubs season|2016]].

The '''Mars Organic Molecule Analyser''' ('''MOMA''') is a [[mass spectrometer]]-based instrument on board the [[ExoMars rover]] to be launched in July 2020 to [[Mars]] on an [[astrobiology]] mission.&lt;ref name='MOMA ESA'&gt;[http://exploration.esa.int/mars/45103-rover-instruments/?fbodylongid=2132 MOMA - Mars Organics Molecule Analyser]. European Space Agency. 25 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It will search for [[organic compound]]s (carbon-containing molecules) in the collected soil samples. By characterizing the molecular structures of detected organics, MOMA can provide insights into potential molecular [[biosignature]]s.  MOMA will be able to detect organic molecules at concentrations as low as 10 parts-per-billion by weight (ppbw).&lt;ref name='MOMA ESA'/&gt; MOMA examines solid crushed samples exclusively; it does not perform atmospheric analyses.

The Principal Investigator is Fred Goesmann, from the [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name='MOMA ESA'/&gt;

==Overview==

The goal of MOMA is to seek signs of past [[life on Mars]] (biosignatures) by analysing a wide range of [[organic compound]]s that may be found in drilled samples acquired from 2  meters below the Martian surface by the [[ExoMars rover]]. MOMA examines solid crushed samples only; it does not perform atmospheric analyses.

MOMA will first volatilize solid organic compounds so that they can be analysed by a [[mass spectrometer]]; this volatilization of organic material is achieved by two different techniques: [[Soft laser desorption|laser desorption]] and thermal volatilisation, followed by separation using four [[GC-MS]] columns. The identification of the organic molecules is then performed with an [[Quadrupole ion trap|ion trap mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref name="Vago"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://esamultimedia.esa.int/multimedia/publications/ESA-Bulletin-155/offline/download.pdf |title=ExoMars: ESA's Next Step in Mars Exploration |journal=Bulletin |publisher=European Space Agency |first1=Jorge |last1=Vago |first2=Olivier |last2=Witasse |first3=Pietro |last3=Baglioni |first4=Albert |last4=Haldemann |first5=Giacinto |last5=Gianfiglio |first6=Thierry |last6=Blancquaert |first7=Don |last7=McCoy |first8=Rolf |last8=de Groot |display-authors=5 |issue=155 |pages=12–23 |date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Goesmann 2017'&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1089/ast.2016.1551| title = The Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) Instrument: Characterization of Organic Material in Martian Sediments| journal = Astrobiology| volume = 17| issue = 6–7| pages = 655| year = 2017| last1 = Goesmann| first1 = Fred| last2 = Brinckerhoff| first2 = William B.| last3 = Raulin| first3 = François| last4 = Goetz| first4 = Walter| last5 = Danell| first5 = Ryan M.| last6 = Getty| first6 = Stephanie A.| last7 = Siljeström| first7 = Sandra| last8 = Mißbach| first8 = Helge| last9 = Steininger| first9 = Harald| last10 = Arevalo| first10 = Ricardo D.| last11 = Buch| first11 = Arnaud| last12 = Freissinet| first12 = Caroline| last13 = Grubisic| first13 = Andrej| last14 = Meierhenrich| first14 = Uwe J.| last15 = Pinnick| first15 = Veronica T.| last16 = Stalport| first16 = Fabien| last17 = Szopa| first17 = Cyril| last18 = Vago| first18 = Jorge L.| last19 = Lindner| first19 = Robert| last20 = Schulte| first20 = Mitchell D.| last21 = Brucato| first21 = John Robert| last22 = Glavin| first22 = Daniel P.| last23 = Grand| first23 = Noel| last24 = Li| first24 = Xiang| last25 = Van Amerom| first25 = Friso H.

===Organic biosignatures===

While there is no unambiguous Martian biosignature to look for, a pragmatic approach is to look out for certain molecules such as [[Membrane lipid|lipids]] and [[phospholipid]]s that may be forming [[cell membrane]]s which can be preserved over geological timescales.&lt;ref name='Goesmann 2017'/&gt; Lipids and other organic molecules may exhibit biogenic features that are not present in abiogenic organic material. If biogenic (synthesized by a life form), such compounds may be found at high concentrations only over a narrow range of molecular weights, unlike in carbonaceous meteorites where these compounds are detected over a broader range of molecular weights.&lt;ref name='Goesmann 2017'/&gt; In the case of sugars and [[amino acid]]s, excessive molecular [[homochirality]] (asymmetry) is another important clue of their biological origin.&lt;ref name='Goesmann 2017'/&gt; The assumption is that life on Mars would be carbon-based and cellular as on Earth, so there are expected common building blocks such as chains of amino acids ([[peptide]]s and [[proteins]]) and chains of nucleobases ([[RNA]], [[DNA]], or their analogs). Also, some [[isomers]] of high molecular weight organics can be potential biosignatures when identified in context with other supporting evidence. Other compounds targeted for detection will include [[fatty acid]]s, [[sterol]]s, and [[hopanoid]]s.&lt;ref name='Goesmann 2017'/&gt;

===Background organics===

The surface of Mars is expected to have accumulated significant quantities of large organic molecules delivered by interplanetary dust particles and carbonaceous meteorites.&lt;ref name='Goesmann 2017'/&gt; MOMA's characterization of this fraction, may determine not only the abundance of this potential background for trace biomarker detection, but also the degree of decomposition of this matter by radiation and oxidation as a function of depth.&lt;ref name='Goesmann 2017'/&gt;&lt;ref name=LDMS&gt;[https://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/IPM/PDF/1098.pdf Detecting Organics with the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) on the 2018 ExoMars Rover] (PDF). H. Steininger, F. Goesmann, F. Raulin, W. B. Brinckerhoff, MOMA Team.&lt;/ref&gt; This is essential in order to interpret the samples' origin in the local geological and geochemical context.&lt;ref name=LDMS/&gt;

==Development==

The components of MOMA related to GC-MS have heritage from the [[Viking lander biological experiments|''Viking'' landers]], the COSAC on board the comet lander [[Philae (spacecraft)#Instruments|''Philae'']], and [[Sample Analysis at Mars|SAM]] on board the ''Curiosity'' rover.&lt;ref name='MOMA ESA'/&gt; But the methods applied in the past on board the ''Viking'' landers and the ''Curiosity'' rover are mostly destructive (pyrolysis), and consequently important information of the organic material is lost. Also, only volatile molecules can be detected and, only nonpolar molecules can get through the GC columns to the detector.  MOMA will combine pyrolysis–derivatization with a less destructive method: LDMS (Laser Desorption Mass Spectrometry), which allows large and intact molecular fragments to be detected and characterized by the mass spectrometer (MS).&lt;ref name='MOMA ESA'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/IPM/IPM2012/PDF/Revised_Orals/Steineinger-1116.pdf Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) onboard ExoMars 2018] (PDF). Harald Steininger.&lt;/ref&gt; The LDMS technique is not affected by these drawbacks, and it is unaffected to the presence of [[perchlorates]], known to be abundant on the surface of Mars.&lt;ref name='MOMA ESA'/&gt;&lt;ref name=LDMS/&gt; Tandem mass spectrometry can then be used to further characterize these molecules.&lt;ref name='MOMA ESA'/&gt;

The [[Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research]] is leading the development. International partners include NASA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spaceflightnow.com/news/n1211/21exomars/ |title=European states accept Russia as ExoMars partner |work=Spaceflight Now |first=Stephen |last=Clark |date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[mass spectrometer]] (MS) and the main electronics of MOMA are provided by NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], while the [[gas chromatography]] (GC) is provided by the two French institutes [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|LISA]] and [[Laboratoire atmosphères, milieux, observations spatiales|LATMOS]]. The UV-Laser is being developed by the Laser Zentrum Hannover.&lt;ref name='Goesmann 2017'/&gt; MOMA does not form a single compact unit, but is modular with numerous mechanical and thermal interfaces within the rover. The final integration and verification will be performed at [[Thales Alenia Space]] in Italy.

A '''microscope''' (from the {{lang-grc|μικρός}}, ''mikrós'', "small" and {{lang|grc|σκοπεῖν}}, ''skopeîn'', "to look" or "see") is an [[Laboratory equipment|instrument]] used to see objects that are too small to be seen by the naked eye. [[Microscopy]] is the [[science]] of investigating small objects and structures using such an instrument. [[Microscopic]] means invisible to the eye unless aided by a microscope.

There are many types of microscopes, and they may be grouped in different ways. One way is to describe the way the instruments interact with a sample to create images, either by sending a beam of light or electrons to a sample in its optical path, or by scanning across, and a short distance from, the surface of a sample using a probe. The most common microscope (and the first to be invented) is the [[optical microscope]], which uses [[light]] to pass through a sample to produce an image. Other major types of microscopes are the [[fluorescence microscope]], the [[electron microscope]] (both, the [[transmission electron microscope]] and the [[scanning electron microscope]]) and the various types of [[scanning probe microscope]]s.&lt;ref name="CAP"&gt;{{cite book|title=Characterization and Analysis of Polymers|date=2008|publisher=Wiley-Interscience|location=Hoboken, NJ|isbn=978-0-470-23300-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Old-microscopes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|18th-century microscopes from the [[Musée des Arts et Métiers]], [[Paris]]]]
{{See|Timeline of microscope technology|Optical microscope#History}}
Although objects resembling lenses date back 4000 years and there are [[Greeks|Greek]] accounts of the optical properties of water-filled spheres (5th century BC) followed by many centuries of writings on optics, the earliest known use of simple microscopes ([[magnifying glass]]es) dates back to the widespread use of lenses in [[eyeglasses]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="Bardell2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bardell|first1=David|title=The Invention of the Microscope|journal=Bios|date=May 2004|volume=75|issue=2|pages=78–84|jstor=4608700|doi=10.1893/0005-3155(2004)75&lt;78:tiotm&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The history of the telescope'' by Henry C.

===Rise of modern light microscopes===

[[File:Binocular compound microscope, Carl Zeiss Jena, 1914 (6779276516).jpg|thumb|Carl Zeiss binocular compound microscope, 1914|upright]]

The first detailed account of the [[histology|microscopic anatomy]] of organic tissue based on the use of a microscope did not appear until 1644, in Giambattista Odierna's ''L'occhio della mosca'', or ''The Fly's Eye''.&lt;ref name=Wootton&gt;{{cite book |author=Wootton, David |title=Bad medicine: doctors doing harm since Hippocrates |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2006 |page=110|isbn=978-0192803559 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The microscope was still largely a novelty until the 1660s and 1670s when naturalists in Italy, the Netherlands and England began using them to study biology, both organisms and their [[ultrastructure]]. Italian scientist [[Marcello Malpighi]], called the father of [[histology]] by some historians of biology, began his analysis of biological structures with the lungs. [[Robert Hooke]]'s ''[[Micrographia]]'' had a huge impact, largely because of its impressive illustrations. A significant contribution came from [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] who achieved up to 300 times magnification using a simple single lens microscope.  He sandwiched a very small glass ball lens between the holes in two metal plates riveted together, and with an adjustable-by-screws needle attached to mount the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/early-microscopes-revealed-new-world-tiny-living-things-180958912|title=Early Microscopes Revealed a New World of Tiny Living Things|author=Liz Logan|publisher=Smithsonian.com|date=27 April 2016|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, Van Leeuwenhoek re-discovered [[red blood cell]]s (after [[Jan Swammerdam]]) and [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]], and helped popularise the use of microscopes to view biological ultrastructure. On 9 October 1676, van Leeuwenhoek reported the discovery of micro-organisms.&lt;ref name=Wootton/&gt;

The performance of a light microscope depends on the quality and correct use of the [[Condenser (optics)|condensor]] lens system to focus light on the specimen and the objective lens to capture the light from the specimen and form an image.&lt;ref name="Murphy" /&gt; Early instruments were limited until this principle was fully appreciated and developed from the late 19th to very early 20th century, and until electric lamps were available as light sources. In 1893 [[August Köhler]] developed a key principle of sample illumination, [[Köhler illumination]], which is central to achieving the theoretical limits of resolution for the light microscope. This method of sample illumination produces even lighting and overcomes the limited contrast and resolution imposed by early techniques of sample illumination. Further developments in sample illumination came from the discovery of [[Phase contrast microscopy|phase contrast]] by [[Frits Zernike]] in 1953, and [[Differential interference contrast microscopy|differential interference contrast]] illumination by [[Georges Nomarski]] in 1955; both of which allow imaging of unstained, transparent samples.

===Electron microscopes===
{{See also|electron microscope}}
[[File:Ernst Ruska Electron Microscope - Deutsches Museum - Munich-edit.jpg|thumb|Electron microscope constructed by [[Ernst Ruska]] in 1933]]
In the early 20th century a significant alternative to the light microscope was developed, an instrument that uses a beam of [[electron]]s rather than [[light]] to generate an image. The German physicist, [[Ernst Ruska]], working with electrical engineer [[Max Knoll]], developed the first prototype electron microscope in 1931, a [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM). The transmission electron microscope works on similar principles to an optical microscope but uses electrons in the place of light and electromagnets in the place of glass lenses. Use of electrons, instead of light, allows for much higher resolution.

Development of the transmission electron microscope was quickly followed in 1935 by the development of the [[scanning electron microscope]] by [[Max Knoll]].&lt;ref name="knoll"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Knoll |first=Max|year=1935 |title=Aufladepotentiel und Sekundäremission elektronenbestrahlter Körper |journal=Zeitschrift für Technische Physik |volume=16|pages=467–475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although TEMs were being used for research before WWII, and became popular afterwards, the SEM was not commercially available until 1965.

Transmission electron microscopes became popular following the [[Second World War]]. Ernst Ruska, working at [[Siemens]], developed the first commercial transmission electron microscope and, in the 1950s, major scientific conferences on electron microscopy started being held. In 1965, the first commercial scanning electron microscope was developed by Professor Sir [[Charles Oatley]] and his postgraduate student Gary Stewart, and marketed by the [[Cambridge Instrument Company]] as the "Stereoscan".

One of the latest discoveries made about using an electron microscope is the ability to identify a virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldsmith|first=Cynthia S.|last2=Miller|first2=Sara E.|date=2009-10-01|title=Modern Uses of Electron Microscopy for Detection of Viruses|url=http://cmr.asm.org/content/22/4/552|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=552–563|doi=10.1128/cmr.00027-09|issn=0893-8512|pmid=19822888|pmc=2772359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since this microscope produces a visible, clear image of small organelles, in an electron microscope there is no need for reagents to see the virus or harmful cells, resulting in a more efficient way to detect pathogens.

===Scanning probe microscopes===
{{See also|scanning probe microscope}}
From 1981 to 1983 [[Gerd Binnig]] and [[Heinrich Rohrer]] worked at [[IBM]] in [[Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] to study the [[quantum tunnelling]] phenomenon. They created a practical instrument, a [[scanning probe microscope]] from quantum tunnelling theory, that read very small forces exchanged between a probe and the surface of a sample. The probe approaches the surface so closely that electrons can flow continuously between probe and sample, making a current from surface to probe. The microscope was not initially well received due to the complex nature of the underlying theoretical explanations.  In 1984 [[Jerry Tersoff]] and D.R. Hamann, while at AT&amp;T's Bell Laboratories in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]] began publishing articles that tied theory to the experimental results obtained by the instrument. This was closely followed in 1985 with functioning commercial instruments, and in 1986 with Gerd Binnig, Quate, and Gerber's invention of the [[atomic force microscope]], then Binnig's and Rohrer's Nobel Prize in Physics for the SPM.&lt;ref name="Morita"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morita|first1=Seizo|title=Roadmap of Scanning Probe Microscopy|date=2007|publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|isbn=978-3540343158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New types of scanning probe microscope have continued to be developed as the ability to machine ultra-fine probes and tips has advanced.

===Fluorescence microscopes===

{{See also|fluorescence microscope|immunofluorescence|confocal microscope}}

[[File:Fluorescence microscop.jpg|thumb|upright|Fluorescence microscope with the filter cube turret above the objective lenses, coupled with a camera.]]

The most recent developments in light microscope largely centre on the rise of [[fluorescence microscope|fluorescence microscopy]] in [[biology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During the last decades of the 20th century, particularly in the post-[[genome|genomic]] era, many techniques for fluorescent [[staining]] of [[cell (biology)|cellular]] structures were developed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main groups of techniques involve targeted chemical staining of particular cell structures, for example, the chemical compound [[DAPI]] to label [[DNA]], use of antibodies conjugated to fluorescent reporters, see
[[immunofluorescence]], and fluorescent proteins, such as [[green fluorescent protein]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These techniques use these different fluorophores for analysis of cell structure at a molecular level in both live and fixed samples.

The rise of fluorescence microscopy drove the development of a major modern microscope design, the [[confocal microscope]]. The principle was patented in 1957 by [[Marvin Minsky]], although [[laser]] technology limited practical application of the technique. It was not until 1978 when [[Thomas Cremer|Thomas]] and [[Christoph Cremer]] developed the first practical [[confocal laser scanning microscope]] and the technique rapidly gained popularity through the 1980s.

===Super resolution microscopes===
{{Main|Super-resolution microscopy|Microscopy#Sub-diffraction techniques}}
Much current research (in the early 21st century) on optical microscope techniques is focused on development of [[superresolution]] analysis of fluorescently labelled samples. [[Microscopy#Structured illumination|Structured illumination]] can improve resolution by around two to four times and techniques like [[stimulated Emission Depletion microscopy|stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy]] are approaching the resolution of electron microscopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2014/advanced-chemistryprize2014.pdf|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2014 – Scientific Background|last=|first=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This occurs because the diffraction limit is occurred from light or excitation, which makes the resolution must be doubled to become super saturated. Stefan Hell was awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of the STED technique, along with Eric Betzig and William Moerner who adapted fluorescnence microscopy for single-molecule viusalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2014/press.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2014|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-ray microscopes===
{{main|X-ray microscope}}
X-ray microscopes are instruments that use electromagnetic radiation usually in the soft X-ray band to image objects. Technological advances in x-ray lens optics in the early 1970s made the instrument a viable imaging choice.&lt;ref name="Erko"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erko|first1=A.|title=Modern developments in X-ray and neutron optics|date=2008|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3540745617}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often used in tomography (see [[X-ray microtomography|micro-computed tomography]]) to produce three dimensional images of objects, including biological materials that have not been chemically fixed. Currently research is being done to improve optics for hard x-rays which have greater penetrating power.&lt;ref name="Erko" /&gt;

==Types==
[[Image:MicroscopesOverview.svg|thumb|right|300px|Types of microscopes illustrated by the principles of their beam paths]]
[[File:MicroscopyResolution.png|thumb|300px|Evolution of spatial resolution achieved with optical, transmission (TEM) and aberration-corrected electron microscopes (ACTEM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1557/mrs2006.4|url=http://web.pdx.edu/~pmoeck/pennycooks%20aberration%20corrected%20microscopes.pdf|title=Materials Advances through Aberration-Corrected Electron Microscopy|journal=MRS Bulletin|volume=31|pages=36–43|year=2011|last1=Pennycook|first1=S.J.|last2=Varela|first2=M.|last3=Hetherington|first3=C.J.D.|last4=Kirkland|first4=A.I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Microscopes can be separated into several different classes. One grouping is based on what interacts with the sample to generate the image, i.e., [[light]] or [[photons]] (optical microscopes), [[electron]]s (electron microscopes) or a probe (scanning probe microscopes). Alternatively, microscopes can be classified based on whether they analyze the sample via a scanning point (confocal optical microscopes, scanning electron microscopes and scanning probe microscopes) or analyze the sample all at once (wide field optical microscopes and transmission electron microscopes).

Wide field optical microscopes and transmission electron microscopes both use the theory of lenses ([[optics]] for light microscopes and [[electromagnet]] lenses for electron microscopes) in order to magnify the image generated by the passage of a [[wave]] transmitted through the sample, or reflected by the sample. The waves used are [[electromagnetic waves|electromagnetic]] (in [[optical microscope]]s) or [[electron]] beams (in [[electron microscopes]]). [[Optical resolution|Resolution]] in these microscopes is limited by the wavelength of the radiation used to image the sample, where shorter wavelengths allow for a higher resolution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lodish|first=Harvey|last2=Berk|first2=Arnold|last3=Zipursky|first3=S. Lawrence|last4=Matsudaira|first4=Paul|last5=Baltimore|first5=David|last6=Darnell|first6=James|date=2000|title=Microscopy and Cell Architecture|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21629/|journal=Molecular Cell Biology. 4th Edition|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scanning optical and electron microscopes, like the confocal microscope and scanning electron microscope, use lenses to focus a spot of light or electrons onto the sample then analyze the signals generated by the beam interacting with the sample. The point is then scanned over the sample to analyze a rectangular region. Magnification of the image is achieved by displaying the data from scanning a physically small sample area on a relatively large screen. These microscopes have the same resolution limit as wide field optical, probe, and electron microscopes.

Scanning probe microscopes also analyze a single point in the sample and then scan the probe over a rectangular sample region to build up an image. As these microscopes do not use electromagnetic or electron radiation for imaging they are not subject to the same resolution limit as the optical and electron microscopes described above.

=== Optical ===
{{main|Optical microscope}}
The most common type of microscope (and the first invented) is the [[optical microscope]]. This is an [[optics|optical]] [[measuring instrument|instrument]] containing one or more [[Lens (optics)|lenses]] producing an enlarged image of a sample placed in the focal plane. Optical microscopes have [[refraction|refractive]] glass (occasionally plastic or [[quartz]]), to focus light on the eye or on to another light detector. Mirror-based optical microscopes operate in the same manner. Typical magnification of a light microscope, assuming visible range light, is up to 1250x with a theoretical [[Diffraction-limited system|resolution limit]] of around 0.250&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre]]s or 250&amp;nbsp;[[nanometre]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This limits practical magnification to ~1500x.  Specialized techniques (e.g., [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|scanning confocal microscopy]], [[Vertico SMI]]) may exceed this magnification but the resolution is [[diffraction]] limited. The use of shorter wavelengths of light, such as ultraviolet, is one way to improve the spatial resolution of the optical microscope, as are devices such as the [[near-field scanning optical microscope]].

[[Sarfus]] is a recent optical technique that increases the sensitivity of a standard optical microscope to a point where it is possible to directly visualize nanometric films (down to 0.3&amp;nbsp;nanometre) and isolated nano-objects (down to 2&amp;nbsp;nm-diameter). The technique is based on the use of non-reflecting substrates for cross-polarized reflected light microscopy.

[[Ultraviolet]] light enables the resolution of microscopic features as well as the imaging of samples that are transparent to the eye. [[Near infrared]] light can be used to visualize circuitry embedded in bonded silicon devices, since silicon is transparent in this region of wavelengths.

In [[fluorescence microscopy]] many wavelengths of light ranging from the ultraviolet to the visible can be used to cause samples to [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] which allows viewing by eye or with specifically sensitive cameras.[[File:Brightfield phase contrast cell image.jpg|thumb|Unstained cells viewed by typical brightfield (left) compared to phase contrast microscopy (right). ]] [[phase contrast microscope|Phase contrast microscopy]] is an [[optical microscopy]] [[lighting|illumination]] technique in which small [[phase shifts]] in the light passing through a transparent specimen are converted into [[amplitude]] or [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] changes in the image.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of phase contrast does not require [[staining]] to view the slide. This microscope technique made it possible to study the [[cell cycle]] in live cells.

The traditional optical microscope has more recently evolved into the [[digital microscope]]. In addition to, or instead of, directly viewing the object through the [[eyepiece]]s, a type of sensor similar to those used in a [[digital camera]] is used to obtain an image, which is then displayed on a computer monitor. These sensors may use [[CMOS]] or [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) technology, depending on the application.

Digital microscopy with very low light levels to avoid damage to vulnerable biological samples is available using sensitive [[photon counting|photon-counting]] digital cameras. It has been demonstrated that a light source providing pairs of [[Photon entanglement|entangled photons]] may minimize the risk of damage to the most light-sensitive samples. In this application of [[ghost imaging]] to photon-sparse microscopy, the sample is illuminated with infrared photons, each of which is spatially correlated with an entangled partner in the visible band for efficient imaging by a photon-counting camera.&lt;ref name="AspdenGemmell2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aspden|first1=Reuben S. |last2=Gemmell|first2=Nathan R. |last3=Morris|first3=Peter A. |last4=Tasca|first4=Daniel S. |last5=Mertens|first5=Lena |last6=Tanner|first6=Michael G. |last7=Kirkwood|first7=Robert A. |last8=Ruggeri|first8=Alessandro |last9=Tosi|first9=Alberto |last10=Boyd|first10=Robert W. |last11=Buller|first11=Gerald S. |last12=Hadfield |first12=Robert H. |last13=Padgett |first13=Miles J. |title=Photon-sparse microscopy: visible light imaging using infrared illumination |journal=Optica |volume=2 |issue=12 |year=2015 |pages=1049 |issn=2334-2536 |doi=10.1364/OPTICA.2.001049|url=http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/112219/1/112219.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the specimen do not necessarily need to be sectioned, but require coating with a substance such as a heavy metal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This allows three-dimensional views of the surface of samples.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{main|Electron microscope}}

=== Scanning probe ===
{{main|Scanning probe microscopy}}

The different types of scanning probe microscopes arise from the many different types of interactions that occur when a small probe of some type is scanned over and interacts with a specimen. These interactions or modes can be recorded or mapped as function of location on the surface to form a characterization map. The three most common types of scanning probe microscopes are [[atomic force microscopy|atomic force microscopes]] (AFM), [[near-field scanning optical microscopy|near-field scanning optical microscopes]] (MSOM or SNOM, scanning near-field optical microscopy), and [[scanning tunneling microscopy|scanning tunneling microscopes]] (STM).&lt;ref name="Bhushan"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Bhushan|editor1-first=Bharat|title=Springer handbook of nanotechnology|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3642025259|page=620|edition=3rd rev. &amp; extended}}&lt;/ref&gt; An atomic force microscope has a fine probe, usually of silicon or silicon nitride, attached to a cantilever; the probe is scanned over the surface of the sample, and the forces that cause an interaction between the probe and the surface of the sample are measured and mapped. A near-field scanning optical microscope is similar to an AFM but its probe consists of a light source in an optical fiber covered with a tip that has usually an aperture for the light to pass through. The microscope can capture either transmitted or reflected light to measure very localized optical properties of the surface, commonly of a biological specimen. Scanning tunneling microscopes have a metal tip with a single apical atom; the tip is attached to a tube through which a current flows.&lt;ref name="Sakurai"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Sakurai|editor1-first=T.|editor2-last=Watanabe|editor2-first=Y.|title=Advances in scanning probe microscopy|date=2000|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3642569494}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tip is scanned over the surface of a conductive sample until a tunneling current flows; the current is kept constant by computer movement of the tip and an image is formed by the recorded movements of the tip.&lt;ref name="Bhushan" /&gt;

=== Other types ===
[[Scanning acoustic microscope]]s use sound waves to measure variations in acoustic impedance. Similar to [[Sonar]] in principle, they are used for such jobs as detecting defects in the subsurfaces of materials including those found in integrated circuits. On February 4, 2013, Australian engineers built a "quantum microscope" which provides unparalleled precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/02/130204163442.htm|title=Quantum Microscope for Living Biology|publisher=Science Daily|date=4 February 2013|accessdate=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Ignition Facility''' ('''NIF'''), is a large [[laser]]-based [[inertial confinement fusion]] (ICF) research device, located at the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] in [[Livermore, California]]. NIF uses lasers to heat and compress a small amount of [[Fusion power#Fuels|hydrogen fuel]] with the goal of inducing [[nuclear fusion]] reactions. NIF's mission is to achieve [[fusion ignition]] with high [[fusion energy gain factor|energy gain]], and to support [[nuclear weapon]] [[stockpile stewardship|maintenance]] and design by studying the [[equation of state|behavior of matter]] under the conditions found within nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/ "About NIF &amp; Photon Science"], Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt; NIF is the largest and most energetic ICF device built to date, and the largest laser in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/gear-and-gadgets/world-most-powerful-laser-120322.htm|title=RebelMouse vs. WordPress VIP|author=|date=10 May 2017|website=discovery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction on the NIF began in 1997 but management problems and technical delays slowed progress into the early 2000s. Progress after 2000 was smoother, but compared to initial estimates, NIF was completed five years behind schedule and was almost four times more expensive than originally budgeted. Construction was certified complete on 31 March 2009 by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]],&lt;ref name="Certified complete"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Energy Announces Completion of World's Largest Laser |url=https://www.energy.gov/news2009/7191.htm |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2009-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401194726/http://www.energy.gov/news2009/7191.htm |archivedate=April 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a dedication ceremony took place on 29 May 2009.&lt;ref name="dedication"&gt;{{cite web | title=Dedication of world's largest laser marks the dawn of a new era | url=https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2009/NR-09-05-05.html | publisher=[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] | date=2009-05-29 | accessdate=2009-09-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527184853/https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2009/NR-09-05-05.html | archivedate=2010-05-27 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large-scale laser target experiments were performed in June 2009&lt;ref name="firstshots"&gt;{{cite web | title=First NIF Shots Fired to Hohlraum Targets | url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2009/june.php | publisher=National Ignition Facility | date=June 2009 | accessdate=2009-09-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528000229/https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2009/june.php | archivedate=2010-05-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first "integrated ignition experiments" (which tested the laser's power) were declared completed in October 2010.&lt;ref name="Oct8_10"&gt;{{cite web | title = First successful integrated experiment at National Ignition Facility announced | work = General Physics | publisher = PhysOrg.com | date = October 8, 2010 | url = http://www.physorg.com/news205740709.html | accessdate = 2010-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bringing the system to its full potential was a lengthy process that was carried out from 2009 to 2012. During this period a number of experiments were worked into the process under the National Ignition Campaign, with the goal of reaching ignition just after the laser reached full power, some time in the second half of 2012. The Campaign officially ended in September 2012, at about {{frac|10}} the conditions needed for ignition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport |last=Crandall |first=David |title=Final Review of the National Ignition Campaign |url=http://fire.pppl.gov/NIF_NIC_rev6_Koonin_2012.pdf |date=27 December 2010 |publisher=Department of Energy |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments since then have pushed this closer to {{frac|3}}, but considerable theoretical and practical work is required if the system is ever to reach ignition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= An Assessment of the Prospects for Inertial Fusion Energy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lBKfAwAAQBAJ |publisher= National Academies Press |date=July 2013 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, NIF has been used primarily for materials science and weapons research.

==Description==

===ICF basics===
{{Main|inertial confinement fusion#ICF mechanism of action|l1=ICF mechanism}}
Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) devices use ''drivers'' to rapidly heat the outer layers of a ''target'' in order to compress it. The target is a small spherical pellet containing a few milligrams of fusion fuel, typically a mix of [[deuterium]] (D) and [[tritium]] (T). The energy of the laser heats the surface of the pellet into a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]], which explodes off the surface. The remaining portion of the target is driven inward, eventually compressing it into a small point of extremely high density. The rapid blowoff also creates a [[shock wave]] that travels toward the center of the compressed fuel from all sides. When it reaches the center of the fuel, a small volume is further heated and compressed to a greater degree. When the temperature and density of that small spot are raised high enough, fusion reactions occur and release energy.&lt;ref name=how&gt;[https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ "How NIF works"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527191346/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nif/how_nif_works/ |date=2010-05-27 }}, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Retrieved on October 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion reactions release high-energy particles, some of which, primarily [[alpha particle]]s, collide with the surrounding high density fuel and heat it further. If this process deposits enough energy in a given area it can cause that fuel to undergo fusion as well. However, the fuel is also losing heat through [[x-ray]] losses and hot electrons leaving the fuel area, so the rate of alpha heating must be greater than these losses, a condition known as ''bootstrapping''.&lt;ref name=hurricane&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/climbing-mountain-fusion-ignition-interview-omar-hurricane |title=Climbing the mountain of fusion ignition: an interview with Omar Hurricane |website=LLNL}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the right overall conditions of the compressed fuel—high enough density and temperature—this bootstrapping process will result in a [[chain reaction]], burning outward from the center where the shock wave started the reaction. This is a condition known as ''ignition'', which will lead to a significant portion of the fuel in the target undergoing fusion and releasing large amounts of energy.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html|title=Inertial Fusion Energy: A Tutorial on the Technology and Economics |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221233137/http://www.nuc.berkeley.edu/thyd/icf/IFE.html|archivedate=2008-12-21 |last=Peterson|first=Per F.|date=1998-09-23|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To date most ICF experiments have used lasers to heat the target. Calculations show that the energy must be delivered quickly in order to compress the core before it disassembles. The laser energy also must be focused extremely evenly across the target's outer surface in order to collapse the fuel into a symmetric core. Although other drivers have been suggested, notably heavy ions driven in [[particle accelerator]]s, lasers are currently the only devices with the right combination of features.&lt;ref&gt;Per F.

===Driver laser===
NIF aims to create a single 500&amp;nbsp;[[watt|terawatt]] (TW) peak flash of light that reaches the target from numerous directions at the same time, within a few [[1 E-12 s|picoseconds]]. The design uses 192 beamlines in a parallel system of flashlamp-pumped, neodymium-doped phosphate glass lasers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: NNSA and LLNL announce first successful integrated experiment at NIF|url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/nnsa-and-llnl-announce-first-successful-integrated-experiment-nif|work=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|date=6 October 2010|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure that the output of the beamlines is uniform, the initial laser light is amplified from a single source in the Injection Laser System (ILS). This starts with a low-power flash of 1053-nanometer (nm) infra-red light generated in an [[ytterbium]]-doped optical fiber laser known as the Master Oscillator.&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Wisoff et al., ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..146W NIF Injection Laser System]'', Proceedings of SPIE Vol. 5341, pages 146–155&lt;/ref&gt;  The light from the Master Oscillator is split and directed into 48 Preamplifier Modules (PAMs). Each PAM contains a two-stage amplification process. The first stage is a regenerative amplifier in which the pulse circulates 30 to 60 times, increasing in energy from nanojoules to tens of millijoules. The light then passes four times through a circuit containing a [[neodymium]] glass amplifier similar to (but much smaller than) the ones used in the main beamlines, boosting the nanojoules of light created in the Master Oscillator to about 6&amp;nbsp;joules. According to [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] (LLNL), the design of the PAMs was one of the major challenges during construction. Improvements to the design since then have allowed them to surpass their initial design goals.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.llnl.gov/str/Powell.html Keeping Laser Development on Target for the NIF]'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

[[Image:NIF beamline diagram.png|thumb|left|400px|Simplified diagram of the beampath of a NIF laser beam, one of 192 similar beamlines. On the left are the amplifiers and [[Pockels effect|optical switch]], and on the right is the final spatial filter, switchyard and [[optical frequency multiplier|optical frequency converter]].]]

The main amplification takes place in a series of glass amplifiers located at one end of the beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first [[optical pumping|optically pumped]] by a total of 7,680 [[xenon flash lamp]]s (the PAMs have their own smaller flash lamps as well). The lamps are powered by a [[capacitor]] bank which stores a total of 422&amp;nbsp;MJ (117&amp;nbsp;kWh) of electrical energy. When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the light energy stored in them into the beam. To improve the energy transfer the beams are sent though the main amplifier section four times, using an [[Pockels effect|optical switch]] located in a mirrored cavity. In total these amplifiers boost the original 6&amp;nbsp;J provided by the PAMs to a nominal 4&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref name=how/&gt; Given the time scale of a few billionths of a second, the peak UV power delivered to the target is correspondingly very high, 500&amp;nbsp;TW.

Near the center of each beamline, and taking up the majority of the total length, are ''[[spatial filter]]s''. These consist of long tubes with small telescopes at the end that focus the laser beam down to a tiny point in the center of the tube, where a [[photomask|mask]] cuts off any stray light outside the focal point. The filters ensure that the image of the beam when it reaches the target is extremely uniform, removing any light that was misfocused by imperfections in the optics upstream. Spatial filters were a major step forward in ICF work when they were introduced in the [[Cyclops laser]], an earlier LLNL experiment.

The total length of the path the laser beam propagates from one end to the other, including switches, is about {{convert|1500|m|ft|sp=us}}. The various optical elements in the beamlines are generally packaged into Line Replaceable Units (LRUs), standardized boxes about the size of a vending machine that can be dropped out of the beamline for replacement from below.&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Doug W. (2004). ''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..127L NIF laser line-replaceable units (LRUs)]'', ''Optical Engineering at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory II: The National Ignition Facility.'' {{doi|10.1117/12.538467}}. Retrieved on May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After the amplification is complete the light is switched back into the beamline, where it runs to the far end of the building to the ''target chamber''. The target chamber is a {{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us|adj=mid|-diameter}} multi-piece steel sphere weighing {{convert|130000|kg}}.&lt;ref name="Newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/222792/ |title=Could This Lump Power the Planet? |author=Lyons, Daniel |date=2009-11-14 |publisher=''[[Newsweek]]'' |page=3 |accessdate=2009-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091117020847/http://www.newsweek.com/id/222792 |archivedate=November 17, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Just before reaching the target chamber, the light is reflected off various mirrors in the ''switchyard'' and target area in order to impinge on the target from different directions. Since the length of the overall path from the Master Oscillator to the target is different for each of the beamlines, optics are used to delay the light in order to ensure all of them reach the center within a few picoseconds of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Arnie Heller, ''[https://www.llnl.gov/str/JulAug05/VanArsdall.html Orchestrating the World's Most Powerful Laser]'', Science &amp; Technology Review, July/August 2005. Retrieved on May 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; NIF normally directs the laser into the chamber from the top and bottom. The target area and switchyard system can be reconfigured by moving half of the 48 beamlines to alternate positions closer to the equator of the target chamber.

[[Image:NIF building layout.png|thumb|right|400px|NIF's basic layout. The laser pulse is generated in the room just right of center, and is sent into the beamlines (blue) on either side. After several passes through the beamlines the light is sent into the "switchyard" (red) where it is aimed into the target chamber (silver).]]

One of the last steps in the process before reaching the target chamber is to convert the infrared (IR) light at 1053&amp;nbsp;nm into the ultraviolet (UV) at 351&amp;nbsp;nm in a device known as a [[optical frequency multiplier|frequency converter]].&lt;ref&gt;P.J. Wegner et al.,''[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004SPIE.5341..180W NIF final optics system: frequency conversion and beam conditioning]'', Proceedings of SPIE 5341, May 2004, pages 180–189.&lt;/ref&gt; These are made of thin sheets (about 1&amp;nbsp;cm thick) cut from a single crystal of [[potassium dihydrogen phosphate]]. When the 1053&amp;nbsp;nm (IR) light passes through the first of two of these sheets, frequency addition converts a large fraction of the light into 527&amp;nbsp;nm light (green). On passing through the second sheet, frequency combination converts much of the 527&amp;nbsp;nm light and the remaining 1053&amp;nbsp;nm light into 351&amp;nbsp;nm (UV) light. [[Infrared]] (IR) light is much less effective than UV at heating the targets, because IR couples more strongly with hot [[electrons]] which will absorb a considerable amount of energy and interfere with compression. The conversion process can reach peak efficiencies of about 80 percent for a laser pulse that has a flat [[time|temporal]] shape, but the temporal shape needed for ignition varies significantly over the duration of the pulse. The actual conversion process is about 50 percent efficient, reducing delivered energy to a nominal 1.8&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref&gt;Bibeau, Camille; Paul J. Wegner, Ruth Hawley-Fedder (June 1, 2006).

One important aspect of any ICF research project is ensuring that experiments can actually be carried out on a timely basis. Previous devices generally had to cool down for many hours to allow the flashlamps and laser glass to regain their shapes after firing (due to thermal expansion), limiting use to one or fewer firings a day. One of the goals for NIF is to reduce this time to less than four hours, in order to allow 700 firings a year.&lt;ref name=performance&gt;''[https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2003/NR-03-06-01.html NIF Project Sets Record for Laser Performance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528023239/https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2003/NR-03-06-01.html |date=2010-05-28 }}'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, June 5, 2003.

===NIF and ICF===
[[Image:Laser hohlraum target energy coupling.svg|thumb|left|300px|[[Sankey diagram]] of the laser energy to [[hohlraum]] [[x-ray]] to target capsule energy coupling efficiency. Note the "laser energy" is after conversion to [[UV]], which loses about 50% of the original [[infrared|IR]] power.]]

The name National Ignition Facility refers to the goal of igniting the fusion fuel, a long-sought threshold in fusion research. In existing (non-weapon) fusion experiments the heat produced by the fusion reactions rapidly escapes from the plasma, meaning that external heating must be applied continually in order to keep the reactions going. Ignition refers to the point at which the energy given off in the fusion reactions currently underway is high enough to sustain the temperature of the fuel against those losses. This causes a chain-reaction that allows the majority of the fuel to undergo a nuclear ''burn''. Ignition is considered a key requirement if [[fusion power]] is to ever become practical.&lt;ref name=econ/&gt;

NIF is designed primarily to use the ''indirect drive'' method of operation, in which the laser heats a small metal cylinder instead of the capsule inside it. The heat causes the cylinder, known as a [[hohlraum]] (German for "hollow room", or cavity), to re-emit the energy as intense [[X-ray]]s, which are more evenly distributed and symmetrical than the original laser beams. Experimental systems, including the [[OMEGA laser|OMEGA]] and [[Nova laser]]s, validated this approach through the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Lindl et al., ''[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PHPAEN000011000002000339000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes The physics basis for ignition using indirect-drive targets on the National Ignition Facility]'', Physics of Plasmas, Vol. 11, February 2004, page 339. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the NIF, the large delivered power allows for the use of a much larger target; the baseline pellet design is about 2&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, chilled to about 18 kelvins (−255&amp;nbsp;°C) and lined with a layer of frozen DT fuel. The hollow interior also contains a small amount of DT gas.

In a typical experiment, the laser will generate 3&amp;nbsp;MJ of infrared laser energy of a possible 4. About 1.5&amp;nbsp;MJ of this is left after conversion to UV, and about 15 percent of this is lost in the x-ray conversion in the hohlraum. About 15 percent of the resulting x-rays, about 150&amp;nbsp;kJ, will be absorbed by the outer layers of the target.&lt;ref name=gain&gt;Suter, L.; J. Rothenberg, D.

The net wall-plug efficiency of NIF (UV laser energy out divided by the energy required to pump the lasers from an external source) is less than one percent, and the total wall-to-fusion efficiency is under 10% at its maximum performance. An economical fusion reactor would require that the fusion output be at least an order of magnitude more than this input. Commercial laser fusion systems would use the much more efficient [[Diode-pumped solid-state laser|diode-pumped solid state lasers]], where wall-plug efficiencies of 10 percent have been demonstrated, and efficiencies 16-18 percent are expected with advanced concepts under development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Stephen |last1=Paine |first2=Christopher |last2=Marshall |url=https://www.llnl.gov/str/Payne.html |title=Taking Lasers Beyond the NIF |journal=Science and Technology Review |date=September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other concepts===
NIF is also exploring new types of targets. Previous experiments generally used plastic [[laser ablation|ablators]], typically [[polystyrene]] (CH). NIF's targets also are constructed by coating a plastic form with a layer of sputtered [[beryllium]] or beryllium-copper alloys, and then oxidizing the plastic out of the center.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Wilson et all, ''[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PHPAEN000005000005001953000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes The development and advantages of beryllium capsules for the National Ignition Facility]'', Phys.

Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to traditional plastic targets, beryllium targets offer higher overall implosion efficiencies for the indirect-drive mode where the incoming energy is in the form of x-rays.

Although NIF was primarily designed as an indirect drive device, the energy in the laser is high enough to be used as a ''direct drive'' system as well, where the laser shines directly on the target. Even at UV wavelengths the power delivered by NIF is estimated to be more than enough to cause ignition, resulting in [[Fusion energy gain factor|fusion energy gains]] of about 40 times,&lt;ref&gt;S.

A more uniform beam layout suitable for direct drive experiments can be arranged through changes in the switchyard that move half of the beamlines to locations closer to the middle of the target chamber.

It has been shown, using scaled implosions on the OMEGA laser and computer simulations, that NIF should also be capable of igniting a capsule using the so-called ''polar direct drive'' (PDD) configuration where the target is irradiated directly by the laser, but only from the top and bottom, with no changes to the NIF beamline layout.&lt;ref name=pdd&gt;Yaakobi, B.; R.

Other targets, called ''saturn targets'', are specifically designed to reduce the anisotropy and improve the implosion.&lt;ref&gt;True, M. A.; J. R. Albritton, and E. A.

==History==

===Impetus===
[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]'s (LLNL) history with the ICF program starts with physicist [[John Nuckolls]], who started considering the problem after a 1957 meeting on the peaceful use of nuclear weapons arranged by [[Edward Teller]] at LLNL. During these meetings, the idea later known as [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]] first developed. PACER envisioned the explosion of small [[hydrogen bomb]]s in large underground caverns to generate steam that would be converted into electrical power. After identifying several problems with this approach, Nuckolls became interested in understanding how small a bomb could be made that would still generate net positive power.&lt;ref name=EarlyNuckolls/&gt;

There are two parts to a typical hydrogen bomb, a plutonium-based atomic bomb known as the ''primary'', and a cylindrical arrangement of fusion fuels known as the ''secondary''. The primary releases significant amounts of x-rays, which are trapped within the bomb casing and heat and compress the secondary until it undergoes ignition. The secondary consists of [[lithium deuteride]] fuel, which requires an external neutron source to begin the reaction. This is normally in the form of a D-T "spark plug" in the center of the fuel. Nuckolls's idea was to explore how small the secondary could be made, and what effects this would have on the energy needed from the primary to cause ignition. The simplest change is to replace the LiD fuel with D-T gas, essentially making the spark plug the entire secondary. At that point there is no theoretical smallest size - as the secondary got smaller, so did the amount of energy needed to reach ignition. At the milligram level, the energy levels started to approach those available through several known devices.&lt;ref name=EarlyNuckolls&gt;John Nuckolls, [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/658936-fpqpjO/webviewable/658936.pdf "Early Steps Toward Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE)"], LLNL, 12 June 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1960s, Nuckolls and several other weapons designers had developed the outlines of the ICF approach. The D-T fuel would be placed in a small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum did not have to be heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5&amp;nbsp;MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1&amp;nbsp;MJ beam.&lt;ref name="EarlyNuckolls"/&gt; To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5&amp;nbsp;kt releases 2 million MJ in total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-kT-to-MJ.html "Convert kilotons, to megajoules"], Unit Juggler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nuckolls et al., ''[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5368/pdf/239139a0.pdf Laser Compression of Matter to Super-High Densities: Thermonuclear (CTR) Applications]'', ''Nature'' Vol. 239, 1972, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, ''[http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/10126383-6NAuBK/native/10126383.pdf The Edward Teller Medal Lecture: The Evolution Toward Indirect Drive and Two Decades of Progress Toward ICF Ignition and Burn]'', 11th International Workshop on Laser Interaction and Related Plasma Phenomena, December 1994.

===ICF program begins===
While Nuckolls and LLNL were working on hohlraum-based concepts, former weapon designer [[Ray Kidder]] was working on the direct drive concept, using a large number of laser beams to evenly heat the target capsule. In the early 1970s, Kidder formed [[KMS Fusion]] to directly commercialize this concept. This sparked off intense rivalry between Kidder and the weapons labs. Formerly ignored, ICF was now a hot topic and most of the labs soon started ICF efforts of their own.&lt;ref name=EarlyNuckolls/&gt; LLNL decided early on to concentrate on glass lasers, while other facilities studied gas lasers using carbon dioxide (e.g. ANTARES, [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]) or KrF (e.g. [[Nike laser]], [[Naval Research Laboratory]]).

Throughout these early stages of development, much of the understanding of the fusion process was the result of computer simulations, primarily [[LASNEX]]. LASNEX greatly simplified the reaction to a 2-dimensional simulation, which was all that was possible given the amount of computing power at the time. According to LASNEX, laser drivers in the kJ range would have the required properties to reach low gain, which was just within the state of the art. This led to the [[Shiva laser]] project which was completed in 1977. Contrary to predictions, Shiva fell far short of its goals, and the densities reached were thousands of times smaller than predicted. This was traced to issues with the way the laser delivered heat to the target, which delivered most of its energy to [[electron]]s rather than the entire fuel mass. Further experiments and simulations demonstrated that this process could be dramatically improved by using shorter wavelengths of laser light.

Further upgrades to the simulation programs, accounting for these effects, predicted a new design that would reach ignition. This new system emerged as the 20-beam 200&amp;nbsp;kJ [[Nova laser]] concept. During the initial construction phase, Nuckolls found an error in his calculations, and an October 1979 review chaired by John Foster Jr. of [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] confirmed that there was no way Nova would reach ignition. The Nova design was then modified into a smaller 10-beam design that added frequency conversion to 351&amp;nbsp;nm light, which would increase coupling efficiency.&lt;ref name=peer&gt;{{cite techreport |first1=Matthew |last1=McKinzie |first2=Christopher |last2=Paine |url=http://www.nrdc.org/nuclear/nif2/findings.asp |title=When Peer Review Fails |publisher=NDRC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In operation, Nova was able to deliver about 30&amp;nbsp;kJ of UV laser energy, about half of what was initially expected, primarily due to limits set by optical damage to the final focusing optics. Even at those levels, it was clear that the predictions for fusion production were still wrong; even at the limited powers available, fusion yields were far below predictions.

===Halite and Centurion===
With each experiment, the predicted energy needed to reach ignition rose, and it was not clear that post-Nova predictions were any more accurate than earlier ones. The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) decided that direct experimentation was the best way to settle the issue, and in 1978 they started a series of underground experiments at the [[Nevada Test Site]] that used small nuclear bombs to illuminate ICF targets. The tests were known as Halite or Centurion depending on which lab ran it, LLNL or LANL.

Each test was able to simultaneously illuminate many targets, allowing them to test the amount of x-ray energy needed by placing the targets at different distances from the bomb. Another question was how large the fuel assembly had to be in order for the fuel to self-heat from the fusion reactions and thus reach ignition. Initial data were available by mid-1984, and the testing ceased in 1988. Ignition was achieved for the first time during these tests, but the amount of energy and the size of the fuel targets needed to reach ignition was far higher than predicted.&lt;ref name=secretadvance&gt;{{cite newspaper |title=Secret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among Scientists |first=William |last=Broad |date=21 March 1988 |newspaper=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/03/21/us/secret-advance-in-nuclear-fusion-spurs-a-dispute-among-scientists.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this same period, experiments began on Nova using similar targets to understand their behaviour under laser illumination, allowing direct comparison against the results obtained from the bomb tests.&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, "A strategy for determining the driver requirements for high gain ICF implosions utilizing hydrodynamically equivalent capsules on Nova laser", Laser Annual Program Report, 1981, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, Livermore, CA, UCRL-50055-80/81, pp.2-29-2-57 (unpublished)&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the tests suggested that about 10&amp;nbsp;MJ of x-ray energy would be needed to reach ignition.&lt;ref name=secretadvance/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Math+society+says+no+to+SDI+funding.-a06540237 "Laser advance amid pros and con(fusion)s of DOE fusion path"], Free Online Library, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, Rober McCrory and Michael Campbell, [http://www.physics.utoronto.ca/~phy189h1/Ignition%20and%20Inertial%20Confinement%20Fusion.pdf "Progress Toward Ignition and Burn Propagation in Inertial Confinement Fusion"], ''Physics Today'', September 1992, pp. 32-40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classic.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/10455/|title=Infighting Among Rival Theorists Imperils 'Hot' Fusion Lab Plan|author=|date=|website=The Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Schewe and Ben Stein, [http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/News/Lindl.txt "Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Article Announcement"], ''Physics News'', 25 October 1995&lt;/ref&gt; If this energy is supplied by an IR laser to a hohlraum, as in Nova or NIF, this corresponds to an original laser energy on the order of 100&amp;nbsp;MJ, well beyond the reach of existing technologies.&lt;ref name=secretadvance/&gt;

A great debate broke out in the ICF establishment as a result. One group suggested that they attempt to build a laser of this power; [[Leonardo Mascheroni]] and Claude Phipps designed a new type of [[hydrogen fluoride laser]] that was pumped by high-energy [[electron]]s that would be able to reach the 100&amp;nbsp;MJ limit. Others used the same data and new versions of their computer simulations based on these experiments that suggested that careful shaping of the laser pulse and using more beams spread more evenly showed that ignition and net energy gains could be achieved with a laser between 5 and 10&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/6686429-47queD/6686429.pdf|title=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=osti.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Lindl, Development of the Indirect-Drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain, Physics of Plasmas Vol. 2, No. 11, November 1995; pp. 3933–4024&lt;/ref&gt;

These results prompted the DOE to request a custom military ICF facility they called the "Laboratory Microfusion Facility" (LMF). LMF would use a driver on the order of 10&amp;nbsp;MJ, delivering fusion yields of between 100 and 1,000&amp;nbsp;MJ. A 1989/90 review of this concept by the [[National Academy of Sciences]] suggested that the LMF was too large a step to make at once, and that fundamental physics issues still needed to be explored. They recommended further experiments before attempting to move to a 10&amp;nbsp;MJ system. Nevertheless, the authors were aware of the potential for higher energy requirements, and noted "Indeed, if it did turn out that a 100 MJ driver were required for ignition and gain, one would have to rethink the entire approach to, and rationale for, ICF".&lt;ref&gt;Review of the Department of Energy's Inertial Confinement Fusion Program, Final Report, National Academy of Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;

===LMF and Nova Upgrade===
Building the LMF was estimated to cost about $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=upgrade&gt;''Nova Upgrade - A Proposed ICF Facility to Demonstrate Ignition and Gain'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory ICF Program, July 1992&lt;/ref&gt; LLNL initially submitted a design with a 5&amp;nbsp;MJ 350&amp;nbsp;nm (UV) driver laser that would be able to reach about 200&amp;nbsp;MJ yield, which was enough to attain the majority of the LMF goals. The program was estimated to cost about $600&amp;nbsp;million FY 1989 dollars, and an additional $250&amp;nbsp;million to upgrade it to a full 1,000&amp;nbsp;MJ if needed, and would grow to well over $1&amp;nbsp;billion if LMF was to meet all of the goals requested by the DOE.&lt;ref name=upgrade/&gt; Other labs also proposed their own LMF designs using other technologies.

The National Academy of Sciences review led to a reevaluation of these plans, and in July 1990, LLNL responded with the Nova Upgrade, which would reuse the majority of the existing Nova facility, along with the adjacent Shiva facility. The resulting system would be much lower power than the LMF concept, with a driver of about 1&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref&gt;Tobin, M.T et all, ''[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel2/578/5735/00218762.pdf?tp=&amp;isnumber=&amp;arnumber=218762 Target area for Nova Upgrade: containing ignition and beyond]'', Fusion Engineering, 1991, pg. 650–655. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The new design included a number of features that advanced the state of the art in the driver section, including the multi-pass design in the main amplifiers, and 18 beamlines (up from 10) that were split into 288 "beamlets" as they entered the target area in order to improve the uniformity of illumination. The plans called for the installation of two main banks of laser beamlines, one in the existing Nova beamline room, and the other in the older Shiva building next door, extending through its laser bay and target area into an upgraded Nova target area. The lasers would deliver about 500&amp;nbsp;TW in a 4&amp;nbsp;ns pulse. The upgrades were expected to allow the new Nova to produce fusion yields of between 2 and 10&amp;nbsp;MJ.&lt;ref name=upgrade/&gt; The initial estimates from 1992 estimated construction costs around $400&amp;nbsp;million, with construction taking place from 1995 to 1999.

===NIF emerges===
Throughout this period, the ending of the [[Cold War]] led to dramatic changes in defense funding and priorities. As the need for nuclear weapons was greatly reduced and various arms limitation agreements led to a reduction in warhead count, the US was faced with the prospect of losing a generation of nuclear weapon designers able to maintain the existing stockpiles, or design new weapons.&lt;ref&gt;William Broad, ''[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0DE4D9133DF932A15755C0A962958260 Vast Laser Plan Would Further Fusion and Keep Bomb Experts]'', New York Times, June 21, 1994. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, progress was being made on what would become the [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]], which would ban all [[critical mass|criticality]] testing. This would make the reliable development of newer generations of nuclear weapons much more difficult.

[[File:Preamplifier at the National Ignition Facility.jpg|left|400px|thumb|The preamplifiers of the National Ignition Facility are the first step in increasing the energy of laser beams as they make their way toward the target chamber. In 2012 NIF achieved a 500 terawatt shot—1,000 times more power than the [[electric energy consumption#World electricity consumption (2012)|United States uses at any instant in time]].]]
Out of these changes came the [[Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program]] (SSMP), which, among other things, included funds for the development of methods to design and build nuclear weapons that would work without having to be explosively tested. In a series of meetings that started in 1995, an agreement formed between the labs to divide up the SSMP efforts. An important part of this would be confirmation of computer models using low-yield ICF experiments. The Nova Upgrade was too small to use for these experiments,&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Charles Curtis, Undersecretary of Energy, June 15, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|It is not clearly stated why Nova Upgrade would be too small for SSMP, no reason is given in the available resources.}} and a redesign emerged as NIF in 1994. The estimated cost of the project remained just over $1&amp;nbsp;billion,&lt;ref&gt;1.9 Cost (NIF CDR, Chapter 9)&lt;/ref&gt; with completion in 2002.

In spite of the agreement, the large project cost combined with the ending of similar projects at other labs resulted in several highly critical comments by scientists at other weapons labs, [[Sandia National Laboratories]] in particular. In May 1997, Sandia fusion scientist Rick Spielman publicly stated that NIF had "virtually no internal peer review on the technical issues" and that "Livermore essentially picked the panel to review themselves".&lt;ref&gt;"Livermore's costly fusion laser won't fly, scientists say", Albuquerque Tribune, May 29, 1997, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A retired Sandia manager, Bob Puerifoy, was even more blunt than Spielman: "NIF is worthless ... it can't be used to maintain the stockpile, period".&lt;ref&gt;L. Spohn, "NIF opponents to cite criticism of laser in court battle", Albuquerque Tribune, June 13, 1997, p. A15.&lt;/ref&gt;

A contrasting view was expressed by Victor Reis, assistant secretary for Defense Programs within DOE and the chief architect of the Stockpile Stewardship Program. Reis told the U.S. House Armed Services Committee in 1997 that NIF was "designed to produce, for the first time in a laboratory setting, conditions of temperature and density of matter close to those that occur in the detonation of nuclear weapons. The ability to study the behavior of matter and the transfer of energy and radiation under these conditions is key to understanding the basic physics of nuclear weapons and predicting their performance without underground nuclear testing.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Dr. Victor Reis, Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs, Department of Energy, before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March 19, 1997 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/pa/Director/reisSASC97.html )&lt;/ref&gt; Two JASON panels, which are composed of scientific and technical national security experts, have stated that the NIF is the most scientifically valuable of all programs proposed for science-based stockpile stewardship.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Federico Peña, Secretary, US Dept of Energy, before the Committee on Armed Services, United States Senate, March 26, 1998 (retrieved July 13, 2012 from {{cite web |url=http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205200200/http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/980326fp.htm |archivedate=2011-02-05 |df= }} )&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the initial criticism, Sandia, as well as Los Alamos, provided support in the development of many NIF technologies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osti.gov/bridge/purl.cover.jsp?purl=/274120-bKjglv/webviewable/274120.pdf |title=Information Bridge: DOE Scientific and Technical Information - Sponsored by OSTI |publisher=Osti.gov |date=2012-08-31 |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both laboratories later became partners with NIF in the National Ignition Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |title=National Ignition Campaign: Participants, NIF &amp; Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017203631/https://lasers.llnl.gov/programs/nic/participants.php |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was then sent to [[Sandia National Laboratories]] as a light source in their [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]]. A full-sized demonstrator then followed, in AMPLAB, which started operations in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;J. A.

At the time, the DOE was estimating that the NIF would cost approximately $1.1&amp;nbsp;billion and another $1&amp;nbsp;billion for related research, and would be complete as early as 2002.&lt;ref name=GAO1&gt;''[http://www.gao.gov/archive/2000/rc00141.pdf NATIONAL IGNITION FACILITY, Management and Oversight Failures Caused Major Cost Overruns and Schedule Delays]'', GAO, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1997 the DOE approved an additional $100&amp;nbsp;million in funding and pushed the operational date back to 2004. As late as 1998 LLNL's public documents stated the overall price was $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion, with the first eight lasers coming online in 2001 and full completion in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Howard T. Powell and Richard H. Sawicki, ''[https://www.llnl.gov/str/Powell.html Keeping Laser Development on Target for the National Ignition Facility]'', S&amp;TR, March 1998. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical scale of the facility alone made the construction project challenging. By the time the "conventional facility" (the shell for the laser) was complete in 2001, more than 210,000 cubic yards of soil had been excavated, more than 73,000 cubic yards of concrete had been poured, 7,600 tons of reinforcing steel rebar had been placed, and more than 5,000 tons of structural steel had been erected. In addition to its sheer size, building NIF presented a number of unique challenges. To isolate the laser system from vibration, the foundation of each laser bay was made independent of the rest of the structure. Three-foot-thick, 420-foot-long and 80-foot-wide slabs, each containing 3,800 cubic yards of concrete, required continuous concrete pours to achieve their specifications.

There were also unexpected challenges to cope with: In November, 1997, an El Niño weather front dumped two inches of rain in two hours, flooding the NIF site with 200,000 gallons of water just three days before the scheduled concrete foundation pour. The earth was so soaked that the framing for the retaining wall sank six inches, forcing the crew to disassemble and reassemble it in order to pour the concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://newsline.llnl.gov/employee/articles/2001/10-26-01newsline.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726024319/https://newsline.llnl.gov/employee/articles/2001/10-26-01newsline.pdf |archivedate=2012-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction was halted in December, 1997, when 16,000-year-old mammoth bones were discovered on the construction site. Paleontologists were called in to remove and preserve the bones, and construction restarted within four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/education/fusion_fun/niffy.php |title=Education: Fusion Fun: NIFFY, NIF &amp; Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125052443/https://lasers.llnl.gov/education/fusion_fun/niffy.php |archivedate=2013-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of research and development, technology and engineering challenges also had to be overcome, such as working with the optics industry to create a precision large optics fabrication capability to supply the laser glass for NIF's 7,500 meter-sized optics. State-of-the-art optics measurement, coating and finishing techniques were needed to withstand NIF's high-energy lasers, as were methods for amplifying the laser beams to the needed energy levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Osolin |first=Charles |url=http://www.innovation-america.org/harnessing-power-light |title=Harnessing the Power of Light |publisher=Innovation America |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuous-pour glass, rapid-growth crystals, innovative optical switches, and deformable mirrors were among the technology innovations developed for NIF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/nif/seven_wonders.php |title=National Ignition Facility: The Seven Wonders of NIF, NIF &amp; Photon Science |publisher=Lasers.llnl.gov |accessdate=2012-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017204200/https://lasers.llnl.gov/about/nif/seven_wonders.php |archivedate=2012-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sandia, with extensive experience in pulsed power delivery, designed the capacitor banks used to feed the flashlamps, completing the first unit in October 1998. To everyone's surprise, the Pulsed Power Conditioning Modules (PCMs) suffered capacitor failures that led to explosions. This required a redesign of the module to contain the debris, but since the concrete structure of the buildings holding them had already been poured, this left the new modules so tightly packed that there was no way to do maintenance in-place. Yet another redesign followed, this time allowing the modules to be removed from the bays for servicing.&lt;ref name=peer/&gt; Continuing problems of this sort further delayed the operational start of the project, and in September 1999, an updated DOE report stated that NIF would require up to $350&amp;nbsp;million more and completion would be pushed back to 2006.&lt;ref name=GAO1/&gt;

===Re-baseline and GAO report===
[[File:Bill Richardson, official DOE photo.png|thumb|Bill Richardson began a review process that brought NIF construction back under control.]]

Throughout this period the problems with NIF were not being reported up the management chain. In 1999 then [[Secretary of Energy]] [[Bill Richardson (politician)|Bill Richardson]] reported to Congress that the NIF project was on time and budget, following the information that had been passed onto him by NIF's management. In August that year it was revealed that NIF management had misled Richardson, and in fact neither claim was close to the truth.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;James Glanz, ''[https://www.nytimes.com/library/national/science/081900sci-laser-missiles.html Laser Project Is Delayed and Over Budget]'', New York Times, August 19, 2000. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As the GAO would later note, "Furthermore, the Laboratory's former laser director, who oversaw NIF and all other laser activities, assured Laboratory managers, DOE, the university, and the Congress that the NIF project was adequately funded and staffed and was continuing on cost and schedule, even while he was briefed on clear and growing evidence that NIF had serious problems".&lt;ref name=GAO1/&gt; Richardson later commented "I have been very concerned about the management of this facility... bad management has overtaken good science. I don't want this to ever happen again". A DOE Task Force reporting to Richardson late in January 2000 summarized that "organizations of the NIF project failed to implement program and project management procedures and processes commensurate with a major research and development project... [and that] ...no one gets a passing grade on NIF Management: not the DOE's office of Defense Programs, not the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and not the University of California".&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.seab.energy.gov/publications/nif_rpt.pdf Interim Report of the National Ignition Facility Laser System Task Force]'', Secretary of Energy Advisory Board, January 10, 2000.

Given the budget problems, the [[US Congress]] requested an independent review by the [[General Accounting Office]] (GAO). They returned a highly critical report in August 2000 stating that the budget was likely $3.9 billion, including R&amp;D, and that the facility was unlikely to be completed anywhere near on time.&lt;ref name="GAO1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=fas101&gt;''[http://www.aip.org/fyi/2000/fyi00.101.htm GAO Report Cites New NIF Cost Estimate]'', FYI, American Institute of Physics, Number 101: August 30, 2000. Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The report, "''Management and Oversight Failures Caused Major Cost Overruns and Schedule Delays''," identified management problems for the overruns, and also criticized the program for failing to include a considerable amount of money dedicated to target fabrication in the budget, including it in operational costs instead of development.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

Early technical delays and project management issues caused the DOE to begin a comprehensive "Rebaseline Validation Review of the National Ignition Facility Project" in 2000, which took a critical look at the project, identifying areas of concern and adjusting the schedule and budget to ensure completion. [[John A. Gordon|John Gordon]], National Nuclear Security Administrator, stated "We have prepared a detailed bottom-up cost and schedule to complete the NIF project... The independent review supports our position that the NIF management team has made significant progress and resolved earlier problems".&lt;ref&gt;Ian Hoffman, ''[http://lanl-the-rest-of-the-story.blogspot.com/2007/06/nuclear-testing-gear-in-doubt-livermore.html Nuclear testing gear in doubt]'', MediaNews Group,&lt;/ref&gt; The report revised their budget estimate to $2.25&amp;nbsp;billion, not including related R&amp;D which pushed it to $3.3&amp;nbsp;billion total, and pushed back the completion date to 2006 with the first lines coming online in 2004.&lt;ref name=fas65&gt;''[http://www.aip.org/fyi/2000/fyi00.065.htm New Cost and Schedule Estimates for National Ignition Facility]'', FYI: The API Bulletin of Science Policy News, American Institute of Physics.

Retrieved on May 7, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up report the next year included all of these items, pushing the budget to $4.2 billion, and the completion date to around 2008.

===Progress after rebaselining===

Miller (physicist)|George Miller]] (who later became LLNL director 2006-2011), who was named acting associate director for lasers. [[Ed Moses (physicist)|Ed Moses]], former head of the [[Atomic vapor laser isotope separation|Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation]] (AVLIS) program at LLNL, became NIF project manager. Since the rebaselining, NIF's management has received many positive reviews and the project has met the budgets and schedules approved by Congress. In October 2010, the project was named "Project of the Year" by the [[Project Management Institute]], which cited NIF as a "stellar example of how properly applied project management excellence can bring together global teams to deliver a project of this scale and importance efficiently."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.llnl.gov/news/newsreleases/2010/Oct/NR-10-10-03.html |title=National Ignition Facility wins prestigious 2010 project of the year award |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 11, 2010 |website=llnl.gov |publisher=[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent reviews of the project have been positive, generally in keeping with the post-GAO Rebaseline schedules and budgets. However, there were lingering concerns about the NIF's ability to reach ignition, at least in the short term. An independent review by the [[JASON Defense Advisory Group]] was generally positive about NIF's prospects over the long term, but concluded that "The scientific and technical challenges in such a complex activity suggest that success in the early attempts at ignition in 2010, while possible, is unlikely".&lt;ref name=jason&gt;''[http://www.fas.org/irp/agency/dod/jason/nif.pdf NIF Ignition]'', JASON Program, June 29, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The group suggested a number of changes to the completion timeline to bring NIF to its full design power as soon as possible, skipping over a testing period at lower powers that they felt had little value.

===Early tests and construction completion ===
In May 2003, the NIF achieved "first light" on a bundle of four beams, producing a 10.4 kJ pulse of IR light in a single beamline.&lt;ref name=performance/&gt; In 2005 the first eight beams (a full bundle) were fired producing 153 kJ of infrared light, thus eclipsing OMEGA as the highest energy laser (per pulse) on the planet. By January 2007 all of the LRUs in the Master Oscillator Room (MOOR) were complete and the computer room had been installed. By August 2007 96 laser lines were completed and commissioned, and "A total infrared energy of more than 2.5 megajoules has now been fired. This is more than 40 times what the Nova laser typically operated at the time it was the world's largest laser".&lt;ref&gt;''[https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2007/NR-07-11-05.html World's largest laser picks up the pace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527234734/https://publicaffairs.llnl.gov/news/news_releases/2007/NR-07-11-05.html |date=2010-05-27 }}'', Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, November 21, 2007.

On 29 May 2009 the NIF was dedicated in a ceremony attended by thousands, including California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] and Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]].&lt;ref name="dedication" /&gt; The first laser shots into a hohlraum target were fired in late June 2009.&lt;ref name="firstshots" /&gt;

===Buildup to main experiments===
On January 28, 2010, the facility published a paper reporting the delivery of a 669 kJ pulse to a gold [[hohlraum]], setting new records for power delivery by a laser, and leading to analysis suggesting that suspected interference by generated plasma would not be a problem in igniting a fusion reaction.&lt;ref name="Palmer"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the size of the test hohlraums, laser/plasma interactions produced plasma-optics gratings, acting like tiny prisms, which produced symmetric X-ray drive on the capsule inside the hohlraum.&lt;ref name="Seaver"/&gt;

After gradually altering the wavelength of the laser, they were able to compress a spherical capsule evenly, and were able to heat it up to 3.3 million [[kelvin]]s (285 eV).&lt;ref name="Bullis"/&gt; The capsule contained cryogenically cooled gas, acting as a substitute for the [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] fuel capsules that will be used later on.&lt;ref name="Seaver"/&gt; Plasma Physics Group Leader Dr. Siegfried Glenzer said they've shown they can maintain the precise fuel layers needed in the lab, but not yet within the laser system.&lt;ref name="Bullis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/blog/energy/24720/ |title=Scientists Overcome Obstacle to Fusion |author=Bullis, Kevin |date=January 28, 2010 |publisher=''[[Technology Review]]'' |accessdate=2010-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2010, the NIF could run as high as 1.8 megajoules. Glenzer said that experiments with slightly larger hohlraums containing fusion-ready fuel pellets would begin before May 2010, slowly ramping up to 1.2 megajoules &amp;mdash; enough for ignition according to calculations. But first the target chamber needed to be equipped with shields to block [[neutrons]] that a fusion reaction would produce.&lt;ref name="Palmer"/&gt; On June 5, 2010 the NIF team fired lasers at the target chamber for the first time in six months; realignment of the beams took place later in June in preparation for further high-energy operation.&lt;ref name="Status2010June"&gt;

===National Ignition Campaign===
[[File:Technician inside NIF target chamber.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Technician works on target positioner inside National Ignition Facility (NIF) target chamber.]]
With the main construction complete, NIF started working on the "National Ignition Campaign" (NIC), the quest to reach ignition. By this time, so sure were the experimenters that ignition would be reached that articles began appearing in science magazines stating that it would be announced only a short time after the article was published. [[Scientific American]] started a 2010 review article with the statement "Ignition is close now. Within a year or two..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |first=Michael |last=Moyer |title=Fusion's False Dawn |magazine=Scientific American |date=March 2010 |pages=50–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first test was carried out on 8 October 2010 at slightly over 1&amp;nbsp;MJ. However, a number of problems slowed the drive toward ignition-level laser energies in the 1.4 to 1.5 MJ range.

Progress was initially slowed by the potential for damage from overheating due to a concentration of energy on optical components that is greater than anything previously attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=superlaser-national-ignition-facility |title=Superlaser fires a blank |author=Eugenie Samuel Reich  |date=October 18, 2010 |publisher=''[[Scientific American]]'' |accessdate=2010-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other issues included problems layering the fuel inside the targets, and minute quantities of dust being found on the capsule surface.&lt;ref name=kramerreview&gt;David Kramer, [http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html "NIF overcomes some problems, receives mixed review from its DOE overseer"], ''Physics Today'', 21 April 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430001208/http://blogs.physicstoday.org/politics/2011/04/drive-for-fusion-milestone-ove.html |date=April 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the power was increased and targets of increasing sophistication were used, another problem appeared that was causing an asymmetric implosion. This was eventually traced to minute amounts of water vapor in the target chamber which froze to the windows on the ends of the hohlraums. This was solved by re-designing the hohlraum with two layers of glass on either end, in effect creating a storm window.&lt;ref name="kramerreview"/&gt; Steven Koonin, DOE undersecretary for science, visited the lab for an update on the NIC on 23 April, the day after the window problem was announced as solved. On 10 March he had described the NIC as "a goal of overriding importance for the DOE" and expressed that progress to date "was not as rapid as I had hoped".&lt;ref name=kramerreview/&gt;

NIC shots halted in February 2011, as the machine was turned over to SSMP materials experiments. As these experiments wound down, a series of planned upgrades were carried out, notably a series of improved diagnostic and measurement instruments. Among these changes were the addition of the ARC (Advanced Radiographic Capability) system, which uses 4 of the NIF's 192 beams as a backlighting source for high-speed imaging of the implosion sequence.

ARC is essentially a petawatt-class laser with peak power exceeding a quadrillion (10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;) watts. It is designed to produce brighter, more penetrating, higher-energy x rays than can be obtained with conventional radiographic techniques. When complete, ARC will be the world's highest-energy short-pulse laser, capable of creating picosecond-duration laser pulses to produce energetic x rays in the range of 50-100 keV for backlighting NIF experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://lasers.llnl.gov/news/photons-fusion/2014/may|title= Photons &amp; Fusion Newsletter - May 2014|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= May 2014|website= National Ignition Facility &amp; Photon Science News - Archive - Photons &amp; Fusion Newsletter|publisher= Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|access-date=2015-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NIC runs restarted in May 2011 with the goal of timing the four laser shock waves that compress the fusion target to very high precision. The shots tested the symmetry of the X-ray drive during the first three [[nanosecond]]s. Full-system shots fired in the second half of May achieved unprecedented peak pressures of 50&amp;nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|megabar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = NIC Team Launches Precision Tuning Campaign | title = Stockpile Stewardship and Diamond EOS Experiments | work = Project Status – 2011 (May) | publisher = Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory | date = May 2011 | url = https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2011/may.php | accessdate = 2011-06-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111003170516/https://lasers.llnl.gov/newsroom/project_status/2011/may.php | archivedate = 2011-10-03 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Mike Dunne, director of NIF's laser fusion energy program, predicted in a Photonics West 2012 plenary talk that ignition would be achieved at NIF by October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SPIE Europe Ltd |url=http://optics.org/news/3/1/37 |title=PW 2012: fusion laser on track for 2012 burn |publisher=Optics.org |accessdate=2012-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, the NIF fired a record high of 57 shots, more than in any month up to that point.&lt;ref name=nature201203&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/laser-fusion-nears-crucial-milestone-1.10175 |accessdate=21 Mar 2012 |date=7 March 2012 |title=Laser fusion nears crucial milestone |author=Eric Hand |work=nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 15, 2012, NIF produced a laser pulse with 411 trillion watts of peak power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2012/03/23/nif_laser_pulse/|title=Record-breaking laser pulse raises fusion-power hopes|accessdate=2012-03-22 | date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 5, 2012, it produced a shorter pulse of 1.85 MJ and increased power of 500 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2012/07/12/worlds-most-powerful-laser-fires-most-powerful-laser-blast-ever/|title=World's most powerful laser fires most powerful laser blast ever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DOE Report, July 19, 2012===
The NIC campaign has been periodically reviewed by a team led by [[Steven E. Koonin]], Under Secretary of Science. The 6th review, May 31, 2012 was chaired by David H. Crandall, Advisor on National Security and Inertial Fusion, Koonin being precluded to chair the review because of a conflict of interest. The review was conducted with the same external reviewers, who had previously served Koonin. Each provided their report independently, with their own estimate of the probability of achieving ignition within the plan, i.e. before December 31, 2012. The conclusion of the review was published on July 19, 2012.&lt;ref name="Crandall"&gt;
{{cite web
| url=http://fire.pppl.gov/NIF_NIC_report_rev5_koonin_2012.pdf
| title=External Review of the National Ignition Campaign
| publisher=[[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The previous review dated January 31, 2012, identified a number of experimental improvements that have been completed or are under way.&lt;ref name="Crandall"/&gt; The new report unanimously praised the quality of the installation: lasers, optics, targets, diagnostics, operations have all been outstanding, however:
:The integrated conclusion based on this extensive period of experimentation, however, is that considerable hurdles must be overcome to reach ignition or the goal of observing unequivocal alpha heating. Indeed the reviewers note that given the unknowns with the present 'semi-empirical' approach, the probability of ignition before the end of December is extremely low and even the goal of demonstrating unambiguous alpha heating is challenging. (Crandall&amp;nbsp;Memo&amp;nbsp;2012,&amp;nbsp;p.&amp;nbsp;2)

Further, the report members express deep concerns on the gaps between observed performance and ICF simulation codes such that the current codes are of a limited utility going forward. Specifically, they found a lack of predictive ability of the radiation drive to the capsule and inadequately modeled laser-plasma interactions. These effects lead to pressure being one half to one third of that required for ignition, far below the predicted values. The memo page 5 discusses the mix of ablator material and capsule fuel due likely to hydrodynamics instabilities in the outer surface of the ablator.&lt;ref name="Crandall"/&gt;

The report goes on to suggest that using a thicker ablator may improve performance, but this increases its inertia. To keep the required implosion speed, they request that the NIF energy be increased to 2MJ. One must also keep in mind that [[Nd:YAG laser|neodymium lasers]] can withstand only a limited amount of energy or risk permanent damage to the optical quality of the lasing medium. The reviewers question whether or not the energy of NIF is sufficient to indirectly compress a large enough capsule to avoid the mix limit and reach ignition.{{sfn|Crandall|2012|p=5}} The report concluded that ignition within the calendar year 2012 is 'highly unlikely'.&lt;ref name="Crandall"/&gt;

===Ignition fails, focus shifts, LIFE ends===
The NIC officially ended on September 30, 2012 without achieving ignition. According to numerous articles in the press,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=William J.

In 2008, as NIF was reaching completion, LLNL began the [[Laser Inertial Fusion Energy]] program, or LIFE, to explore ways to use the NIF technologies as the basis for a commercial power plant design. Early studies considered the [[fission-fusion hybrid]] concept, but from 2009 the focus was on pure fusion devices, incorporating a number of technologies that were being developed in parallel with NIF that would greatly improve the performance of the design. All of these, however, were based on the idea that NIF would achieve ignition, and that only minor changes to the basic design would be required to improve performance. In April 2014, Livermore decided to end the LIFE efforts. Bret Knapp, Livermore acting director was quoted as saying that "The focus of our inertial confinement fusion efforts is on understanding ignition on NIF rather than on the LIFE concept."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Livermore Ends LIFE |website=Physics Today |date=April 2014 |first=David |last=Kramer |url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/article/67/4/10.1063/PT.3.2344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A memo sent on 29 September 2013 by Ed Moses describes a fusion shot that took place at 5:15&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 28 September. It produced 5×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons, 75% more than any previous shot. Alpha heating, a key component of ignition, was clearly seen. It also noted that the reaction released more energy than the "energy being absorbed by the fuel", a condition the memo referred to as "scientific breakeven".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher=[[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]
| date=2013-08-26
| accessdate=2017-05-26
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This received significant press coverage as it appeared to suggest a key threshold had been achieved, which was referred to as a "milestone".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24429621 |title=Nuclear fusion milestone passed at US lab |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=2013-10-07 |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a number of researchers pointed out that the experiment was far below ignition, and did not represent a breakthrough as reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Daniel |last=Clery |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2013/10/fusion-breakthrough-nif-uh-not-really-%E2%80%A6 |title=Fusion "Breakthrough" at NIF? Uh, Not Really |website=ScienceInsider |date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others noted that the definition of breakeven as recorded in many references, and directly stated by Moses in the past, was when the fusion output was equal to the laser input. In this release, the term was changed to refer to the energy deposited in the fuel, not the energy of the laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Dale |last=Meade |url=http://fire.pppl.gov/ICF_Scientific_Breakeven_LLNL2.pdf |title=Scientific Breakeven for Fusion Energy |date=11 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method used to reach these levels, known as the "high foot", is not suitable for general ignition, and as a result, it is still unclear whether NIF will ever reach this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jeff |last=Hecht |url=http://www.laserfocusworld.com/articles/2013/10/progress-at-nif-but-no-breakthrough.html |title=Progress at NIF, but no 'breakthrough' |website=LaserFocusWorld |date=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockpile experiments ===

Since that time, NIF has returned to materials studies. Experiments beginning in 2015 FY have used plutonium targets, with a schedule containing 10 to 12 shots for 2015, and as many as 120 over the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Thomas |url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/my-town/ci_27426991/despite-objections-lawrence-livermore-lab-go-forward-plutonium |title=Despite objections, Livermore lab to fire world's largest laser at plutonium |newspaper=Contra Cost Times |date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plutonium shots simulate the compression of the primary in a nuclear bomb by [[high explosive]]s, which has not seen direct testing since the Comprehensive Test Ban. Tiny amounts of plutonium are used in these tests, ranging from less than a milligram to 10 milligrams.&lt;ref name=pumercury/&gt; Similar experiments are also carried out on Sandia's [[Z Pulsed Power Facility|Z machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independentnews.com/news/plutonium-experiments-expected-on-national-ignition-facility/article_eafe840c-86ff-11e4-b122-13c4c0a58c69.html |title=Plutonium Experiments Expected On National Ignition Facility |first=Jeff |last=Garberson |date=19 December 2014 |newspaper=The Independent |location=Livermore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of LLNL's Primary Nuclear Design Program, Mike Dunning, noted that "This is an opportunity for us to get high-quality data using a regime that was previously unavailable to us".&lt;ref name=pumercury&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeremy |last=Thomas |title=Lawrence Livermore National Lab to test plutonium using NIF laser |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/education/ci_27119177/lawrence-livermore-lab-test-plutonium-using-nif-laser |date=12 December 2014 |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One key development on NIF since the Ignition Campaign has been an increase in the shot rate. Although designed to allow shots as often as every 4 hours,{{efn|One source suggested the ultimate aim was one shot per hour.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stolz, "The National Ignition Facility" The world's largest optical system", Optical Design and Testing III, edited by Yongtian Wang, Theo T. Tschudi, Jannick P. Rolland, Kimio Tatsuno Proc. SPIE Vol. 6834, 683402, (2007) · {{DOI|10.1117/12.773365}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} in 2014 FY NIF performed 191 shots, slightly more than one every two days. This has been continuously improved, and in April 2015 NIF was on track to meet its goal of 300 laser shots in 2015 FY, almost one a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://lasers.llnl.gov/news/efficiency-improvements |title=NIF Lasers Continue to Fire at a Record Rate |website=LLNL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MagLIF experiments===

On 28 January 2016, NIF successfully executed its first gas pipe experiment intended to study the absorption of large amounts of laser light within {{convert|1|cm}} long targets relevant to high-gain [[Magnetized Liner Inertial Fusion]] (MagLIF).  In order to investigate key aspects of the propagation, stability, and efficiency of laser energy coupling at full scale for high-gain MagLIF target designs, a single quad of NIF was used to deliver 30 kJ of energy to a target during a 13 nanosecond shaped pulse. Data return was very favorable and analysis is ongoing by scientific staff at Lawrence Livermore and Sandia National Laboratories.

The '''''Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer''''' ('''''NICER''''') is a [[NASA]] [[Explorers program]] Mission of Opportunity dedicated to the study of the extraordinary gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear physics environments embodied by [[neutron star]]s, exploring the exotic states of matter where density and pressure are higher than in [[atomic nuclei]]. ''NICER'' will enable rotation-resolved [[spectroscopy]] of the thermal and non-thermal emissions of neutron stars in the soft (0.2–12 [[keV]]) X-ray band with unprecedented sensitivity, probing interior structure, the origins of dynamic phenomena, and the mechanisms that underlie the most powerful cosmic particle accelerators known.&lt;ref name="nicerPdf1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/papers/NICER-SPIE-July2012-v4.pdf |title=The Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER): an Explorer mission of opportunity for soft x-ray timing spectroscopy |journal=Proceedings of the SPIE: Space Telescopes and Instrumentation 2012, Ultraviolet to Gamma Ray |first1=Keith C. |last1=Gendreau |first2=Zaven |last2=Arzoumanian |first3=Takashi |last3=Okajima |volume=8443 |date=September 2012 |doi=10.1117/12.926396 |bibcode=2012SPIE.8443E..13G}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''NICER'' will achieve these goals by deploying, following launch, an [[X-ray]] timing and spectroscopy instrument as an attached payload aboard the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).  ''NICER'' was selected by NASA to proceed to formulation phase in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2013/apr/HQ_13-088_Astro_Explorer_Mission_.html |title=NASA Selects Explorer Investigations for Formulation |publisher=NASA |first=J.

==Science instrument==
''NICER''{{'s}} primary science instrument, called the X-ray Timing Instrument (XTI), is an array of 56 X-ray photon detectors. These detectors record the energies of the collected photons as well as with their time of arrival. A [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver enables accurate timing and positioning measurements.

During each ISS orbit, ''NICER'' will observe two to four targets. Gimbaling and a [[star tracker]] allow ''NICER'' to track specific targets while collecting science data. In order to achieve its science objectives, ''NICER'' will take over 15 million seconds of exposures over an 18-month period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/nicer-factsheet-final.pdf |title=NICER: Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer |series=NASAFacts |publisher=NASA |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==X-ray navigation and communication experiments==
An enhancement to the ''NICER'' mission, the ''[[Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology]]'' (''SEXTANT''), will act as a technology demonstrator for [[X-ray pulsar-based navigation]] (XNAV) techniques that may one day be used for deep-space navigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150001327.pdf |title=SEXTANT - Station Explorer for X-ray Timing and Navigation Technology |conference=AIAA Guidance, Navigation, and Control Conference. 5–9 January 2015.

As part of ''NICER'' testing, a rapid-modulation X-ray device was developed called Modulated X-ray Source (MXS), which is being used to create an X-ray communication system (XCOM) demonstration. If approved and installed on the ISS, XCOM will transmit data encoded into X-ray bursts to the ''NICER'' platform, which may lead to the development of technologies that allow for gigabit bandwidth communication throughout the Solar System.&lt;ref name="nasa20161104"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/nasa-s-navcube-could-support-an-x-ray-communications-demonstration-in-space-a-nasa-first |title=NASA’s NavCube Could Support an X-ray Communications Demonstration in Space — A NASA First |publisher=NASA |first=Lori |last=Keesey |date=4 November 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nocturnal bottleneck hypothesis''' is a hypothesis to explain several mammalian traits. In 1942, [[Gordon Lynn Walls]] described this concept which states that placental mammals were mainly or even exclusively nocturnal through most of their evolutionary story, starting with their origin 225 million years ago, and only ending with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|demise of the dinosaurs]] 66 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Gerkema MP, Davies WI, Foster RG, Menaker M, Hut RA.

==Evolution of mammals==
[[File:Brasilitherium riograndensis.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|''[[Brasilitherium]]'', a very advanced near-mammalian [[cynodont]], were probably nocturnal burrowers]]
{{main article|Evolution of mammals}}
Mammals evolved from [[cynodont]]s, a group of superficially dog-like [[synapsid|mammal-like reptiles]] in the wake of the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event|Permian–Triassic mass extinction]]. The emerging [[archosaur]]ian groups that flourished after the extinction, including [[crocodiles]] and [[dinosaurs]] and their ancestors, drove the remaining larger cynodonts into extinction, leaving only the smaller forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Benton|first1=Michael J.|authorlink = Michael Benton|title=Vertebrate palaeontology|date=2004|publisher=Blackwell Science|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-632-05637-8|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving cynodonts could only succeed in niches with minimal competition from the diurnal dinosaurs, evolving into the typical small-bodied [[insectivore|insectivorous]] dwellers of the nocturnal undergrowth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kielan-Jaworowska|first1=Zofia|last2=Cifelli,|first2=Richard L.|last3=Luo|first3=Zhe-Xi|title=Mammals from the age of dinosaurs : origins, evolution, and structure|date=2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-11918-6|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the early mammals continued to develop into several probably quite common groups of animals during the [[Mesozoic]], they all remained nocturnal.

Only with the massive extinction at the end of the [[Cretaceous]] did the dinosaurs leave the stage open for the establishment of a new fauna of mammals. Despite this, mammals continued to be small-bodied for millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Than|first1=K.|title=Rise of Modern Mammals Occurred Long After Dinosaur Demise|url=http://www.livescience.com/7230-rise-modern-mammals-occurred-long-dinosaur-demise.html|publisher=LiveScience|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While all the largest animals alive today are mammals, the majority of mammals are still small nocturnal animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gamberale-Stille|first1=G.|last2=Hall|first2=K.

==Mammalian nocturnal adaptions==

Several different features of mammalian physiology appear to be adaptations to a nocturnal lifestyle, mainly related to the sensory organs. These include:

===Senses===
* Acute sense of hearing, including external [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]] and auditory [[ossicles]].
* Very good sense of smell, well developed [[Nasal concha|nasal turbinate]]s.
* Well developed sense of touch, and particularly the [[whiskers]].&lt;ref name=scholarpedia&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Whisking_behavior |title=Vibrissal behaviour and function|journal=Scholarpedia | volume= 6|page=6642 | accessdate=October 29, 2011 | doi=10.4249/scholarpedia.6642 | year=2011 | last1=Grant | first1=Robyn | last2=Mitchinson | first2=Ben | last3=Prescott | first3=Tony | issue=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nova virus was first isolated in European moles (''[[Talpa europaea]]'') found in Hungary and France.

The '''Otto Laporte Award''' (1972–2003) was an annual award by the [[American Physical Society]] (APS) to "''recognize outstanding contributions to [[fluid dynamics]]''" and to honour [[Otto Laporte]] (1902–1971). It was established as the '''Otto Laporte Memorial Lectureship''' by the APS Division of Fluid Dynamics in 1972, and became an APS award in 1985. The Otto Laporte Award was merged into the [[Fluid Dynamics Prize (APS)|Fluid Dynamics Prize]] in 2004, in order to obtain one major prize in fluid dynamics by the APS.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12060">The '''phase rule''' is a general principle governing systems in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. If ''F'' is the number of [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]], ''C'' is the number of [[Component (thermodynamics)|components]] and ''P'' is the number of [[Phase (matter)|phases]], then 
:&lt;math&gt;F = C - P + 2.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Atkins"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Atkins |first1=Peter |last2=Paula |first2=Julio De |last3=Keeler |first3=James |title=Atkins' Physical chemistry |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198769866 |pages=123&amp;ndash;125 |edition=Eleventh}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It was derived by [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] in his landmark paper titled ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]'', published in parts between 1875 and 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, J. W., Scientific Papers (Dover, New York, 1961)&lt;/ref&gt;
The rule assumes the components do not react with each other.

The number of degrees of freedom is the number of independent [[intensive variable]]s, i.e. the largest number of thermodynamic parameters such as [[temperature]] or [[pressure]] that can be varied simultaneously and arbitrarily without determining one another. An example of one-component system is a system involving one pure chemical, while two-component systems, such as mixtures of water and ethanol, have two chemically independent components, and so on. Typical phases are [[solid]]s, [[liquid]]s and [[gas]]es.

==Foundations==
*A phase is a form of matter that is [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] in [[chemical composition]] and [[physical state]]. Typical phases are solid, liquid and gas. Two [[miscibility|immiscible]] liquids (or liquid mixtures with different compositions) separated by a distinct boundary are counted as two different phases, as are two immiscible solids. 
*The number of components (''C'') is the number of chemically independent constituents of the system, i.e. the minimum number of independent species necessary to define the composition of all phases of the system.&lt;ref name=Atkins/&gt; For examples see [[component (thermodynamics)]]. 
*The number of degrees of freedom (''F'') in this context is the number of intensive variables which are independent of each other.

The basis for the rule (Atkins and de Paula,&lt;ref name=Atkins/&gt; justification 6.1) is that equilibrium between phases places a constraint on the intensive variables. More rigorously, since the phases are in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other, the [[chemical potential]]s of the phases must be equal. The number of equality relationships determines the number of degrees of freedom. For example, if the chemical potentials of a liquid and of its vapour depend on temperature (''T'') and pressure (''p''), the equality of chemical potentials will mean that each of those variables will be dependent on the other. Mathematically, the equation {{nowrap|1=''μ''&lt;sub&gt;liq&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'', ''p'') = ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;vap&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'', ''p'')}}, where ''μ'' = chemical potential, defines temperature as a function of pressure or vice versa. (Caution: do not confuse ''p'' = pressure with ''P'' = number of phases.)

To be more specific, the composition of each phase is determined by {{nowrap|''C'' − ''1''}} intensive variables (such as mole fractions) in each phase. The total number of variables is {{nowrap|(''C'' − 1)''P'' + 2}}, where the extra two are temperature ''T'' and pressure ''p''. The number of constraints is {{nowrap|''C''(''P'' − 1)}}, since the chemical potential of each component must be equal in all phases. Subtract the number of constraints from the number of variables to obtain the number of degrees of freedom as {{nowrap|1=''F'' = (''C'' − 1)''P'' + 2 − ''C''(''P'' − 1) = ''C'' − ''P'' + 2}}.

The rule is valid provided the equilibrium between phases is not influenced by gravitational, electrical or magnetic forces, or by surface area, and only by temperature, pressure, and concentration.

==Consequences and examples==

===Pure substances (one component)===
For pure substances {{nowrap|1=''C'' = 1}} so that {{nowrap|1=''F'' = 3 − ''P''}}. In a single phase ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = 1}}) condition of a pure component system, two variables ({{nowrap|1=''F'' = 2}}), such as temperature and pressure, can be chosen independently to be any pair of values consistent with the phase.  However, if the temperature and pressure combination ranges to a point where the pure component undergoes a separation into two phases ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = 2}}), {{nowrap|1=''F''}} decreases from 2 to 1. When the system enters the two-phase region, it becomes no longer possible to independently control temperature and pressure.
[[File:Carbon dioxide pressure-temperature phase diagram.svg|right|thumb|280px|Carbon dioxide pressure-temperature phase diagram showing the [[triple point]] and [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] of carbon dioxide]] In the [[phase diagram]] to the right, the boundary curve between the liquid and gas regions maps the constraint between temperature and pressure when the single-component system has separated into liquid and gas phases at equilibrium.  The only way to increase the pressure on the two phase line is by increasing the temperature. If the temperature is decreased by cooling, some of the gas condenses, decreasing the pressure.  Throughout both processes, the temperature and pressure stay in the relationship shown by this boundary curve unless one phase is entirely consumed by evaporation or condensation, or unless the [[critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] is reached.  As long as there are two phases, there is only one degree of freedom, which corresponds to the position along the phase boundary curve.

The critical point is the black dot at the end of the liquid–gas boundary. As this point is approached, the liquid and gas phases become progressively more similar until, at the critical point, there is no longer a separation into two phases.  Above the critical point and away from the phase boundary curve, {{nowrap|1=''F'' = 2}} and the temperature and pressure can be controlled independently. Hence there is only one phase, and it has the physical properties of a dense gas, but is also referred to as a [[supercritical fluid]].

Of the other two-boundary curves, one is the solid–liquid boundary or [[melting point]] curve which indicates the conditions for equilibrium between these two phases, and the other at lower temperature and pressure is the solid–gas boundary.

Even for a pure substance, it is possible that three phases, such as solid, liquid and vapour, can exist together in equilibrium ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = 3}}).  If there is only one component, there are no degrees of freedom ({{nowrap|1=''F'' = 0}}) when there are three phases. Therefore, in a single-component system, this three-phase mixture can only exist at a single temperature and pressure, which is known as a [[triple point]]. Here there are two equations {{nowrap|1=''μ''&lt;sub&gt;sol&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'', ''p'') = ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;liq&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'', ''p'') = ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;vap&lt;/sub&gt;(''T'', ''p'')}}, which are sufficient to determine the two variables T and p. In the diagram for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the triple point is the point at which the solid, liquid and gas phases come together, at 5.2&amp;nbsp;bar and 217&amp;nbsp;K. It is also possible for other sets of phases to form a triple point, for example in the water system there is a triple point where [[ice I]], [[ice III]] and liquid can coexist.

If four phases of a pure substance were in equilibrium ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = 4}}), the phase rule would give {{nowrap|1=''F'' = −1}}, which is meaningless, since there cannot be −1 independent variables. This explains the fact that four phases of a pure substance (such as ice I, ice III, liquid water and water vapour) are not found in equilibrium at any temperature and pressure. In terms of chemical potentials there are now three equations, which cannot in general be satisfied by any values of the two variables ''T'' and ''p'', although in principle they might be solved in a special case where one equation is mathematically dependent on the other two. In practice, however, the coexistence of more phases than allowed by the phase rule normally means that the  phases are not all in true equilibrium.

===Two-component systems===
For binary mixtures of two chemically independent components,  {{nowrap|1=''C'' = 2}} so that {{nowrap|1=''F'' = 4 − ''P''}}. In addition to temperature and pressure, the other degree of freedom is the composition of each phase, often expressed as [[mole fraction]] or mass fraction of one component.

[[Image:Binary Boiling Point Diagram new.svg|thumb|320px|right|Boiling Point Diagram]]
As an example, consider the system of two completely miscible liquids such as [[toluene]] and [[benzene]], in equilibrium with their vapours. This system may be described by a [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium#Boiling point diagrams|boiling-point diagram]] which shows the composition (mole fraction) of the two phases in equilibrium as functions of temperature (at a fixed pressure).

Four thermodynamic variables which may describe the system include temperature (''T''), pressure (''p''), mole fraction of component 1 (toluene) in the liquid phase (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1L&lt;/sub&gt;), and mole fraction of component 1 in the vapour phase (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1V&lt;/sub&gt;). However, since two phases are present ({{nowrap|1=''P'' = 2}}) in equilibrium, only two of these variables can be independent ({{nowrap|1=''F'' = 2}}). This is because the four variables are constrained by two relations: the equality of the chemical potentials of liquid toluene and toluene vapour, and the corresponding equality for benzene.

For given ''T'' and ''p'', there will be two phases at equilibrium when the overall composition of the system ('''system point''') lies in between the two curves. A horizontal line ([[Contour line#Temperature and related subjects|isotherm]] or tie line) can be drawn through any such system point, and intersects the curve for each phase at its equilibrium composition. The quantity of each phase is given by the [[lever rule]] (expressed in the variable corresponding to the ''x''-axis, here mole fraction).

For the analysis of [[fractional distillation]], the two independent variables are instead considered to be liquid-phase composition (x&lt;sub&gt;1L&lt;/sub&gt;) and pressure. In that case the phase rule implies that the equilibrium temperature ([[boiling point]]) and vapour-phase composition are determined.

Liquid–vapour [[phase diagram]]s for other systems may have [[azeotrope]]s (maxima or minima) in the composition curves, but the application of the phase rule is unchanged. The only difference is that the compositions of the two phases are equal exactly at the azeotropic composition.

==Phase rule at constant pressure==
For applications in [[materials science]] dealing with phase changes between different solid structures, pressure is often imagined to be constant (for example at one atmosphere), and is ignored as a degree of freedom, so the rule becomes
: {{nowrap|1=''F'' = ''C'' − ''P'' + 1}}.
This is sometimes misleadingly called the "condensed phase rule", but it is not applicable to condensed systems which are subject to high pressures (for example, in geology), since the effects of these pressures can be important.

&lt;/ref&gt; or '''RST model''' in short is a modification of the [[CGHS model]] to take care of [[conformal anomaly|conformal anomalies]]. In the CGHS model, if we include [[Faddeev-Popov ghost]]s to gauge-fix diffeomorphisms in the [[conformal gauge]], they contribute an anomaly of -24. Each matter field contributes an anomaly of 1. So, unless N=24, we will have [[gravitational anomaly|gravitational anomalies]].
To the CGHS action
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\text{CGHS}} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int d^2x\, \sqrt{-g}\left\{ e^{-2\phi} \left[ R + 4\left( \nabla\phi \right)^2 + 4\lambda^2 \right] - \sum^N_{i=1} \frac{1}{2}\left( \nabla f_i \right)^2 \right\}&lt;/math&gt;, the following term
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\text{RST}} = - \frac{\kappa}{8\pi} \int d^2x\, \sqrt{-g} \left[ R\frac{1}{\nabla^2}R - 2\phi R \right]&lt;/math&gt;
is added, where ''&amp;kappa;'' is either &lt;math&gt;(N-24)/12&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;N/12&lt;/math&gt; depending upon whether ghosts are considered. The nonlocal term leads to [[Action at a distance|nonlocality]].
In the conformal gauge,
:&lt;math&gt;S_{\text{RST}} = -\frac{\kappa}{\pi} \int dx^+\,dx^- \left[ \partial_+ \rho \partial_- \rho + \phi \partial_+ \partial_- \rho \right]&lt;/math&gt;.

It might appear as if the theory is local in the conformal gauge, but this overlooks the fact that the Raychaudhuri equations are still nonlocal.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1126">A '''ranked society''' in [[anthropology]] is one that [[ranking|ranks]] individuals in terms of their [[genealogical]] distance from the [[Tribal chief|chief]]. Closer relatives of the chief have higher rank or social status than more distant ones. When individuals and groups rank about equally, competition for positions of leadership may occur. In some cases rank is assigned to entire villages rather than individuals or families. The idea of a ranked society was criticized by [[Max Weber]] and [[Karl Marx]]. Ranks in ranked society are the different levels, platforms, or classes that determine someone’s influence on political aspects, votes, decision making, etc. A person’s ranking also gives them societal power ( power within their civilisation ).

Because the reproducibility of experiments is an essential part of the [[scientific method]],&lt;ref&gt;Staddon, John (2017) Scientific Method: How science works, fails to work or pretends to work.  Taylor and Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; the inability to replicate the studies of others has potentially grave consequences for many fields of science in which significant theories are grounded on unreproducible experimental work.

The replication crisis has been particularly widely discussed in the field of [[psychology]] (and in particular, [[social psychology]]) and in [[medicine]], where a number of efforts have been made to re-investigate classic results, and to attempt to determine both the reliability of the results, and, if found to be unreliable, the reasons for the failure of replication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/the-crisis-in-social-psychology-that-isnt|title=The Crisis in Social Psychology That Isn’t|author=Gary Marcus|publisher=The New Yorker|date=May 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/13/the-truth-wears-off|title=The Truth Wears Off|author=Jonah Lehrer|publisher=The New Yorker|date=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of the crisis==
===Overall===
According to a 2016 poll of 1,500 scientists reported in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', 70% of them had failed to reproduce at least one other scientist's experiment (50% had failed to reproduce one of their own experiments).

In 2009, 2% of scientists admitted to falsifying studies at least once and 14% admitted to personally knowing someone who did. Misconducts were reported more frequently by medical researchers than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005738|title=How Many Scientists Fabricate and Falsify Research?

=== In psychology ===
Several factors have combined to put psychology at the center of the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Achenbach|first1=Joel|title=No, science’s reproducibility problem is not limited to psychology|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2015/08/28/no-sciences-reproducibility-problem-is-not-limited-to-psychology/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the focus has been on the area of [[social psychology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/magazine/when-the-revolution-came-for-amy-cuddy.html|title=When the Revolution Came for Amy Cuddy|last=Dominus|first=Susan|date=2017-10-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other areas of psychology such as [[clinical psychology]] have also been implicated.

Firstly, questionable research practices (QRPs) have been identified as common in the field.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;  Such practices, while not intentionally fraudulent, involve capitalizing on the gray area of acceptable scientific practices or exploiting flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting, often in an effort to obtain a desired outcome. Examples of QRPs include selective reporting or partial publication of data (reporting only some of the study conditions or collected dependent measures in a publication), optional stopping (choosing when to stop data collection, often based on statistical significance of tests), ''p''-value rounding (rounding ''p''-values down to 0.05 to suggest statistical significance), file drawer effect (nonpublication of data), post-hoc storytelling (framing exploratory analyses as confirmatory analyses), and manipulation of outliers (either removing outliers or leaving outliers in a dataset to cause a statistical test to be significant).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Measuring the Prevalence of Questionable Research Practices With Incentives for Truth Telling|url = https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Publication%20Files/QRP12_a137cc09-45bc-4eae-9ee9-c0cb47f14add.pdf|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2012-05-01|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 22508865|pages = 524–532|volume = 23|issue = 5|doi = 10.1177/0956797611430953|first = Leslie K.|last = John|first2 = George|last2 = Loewenstein|first3 = Drazen|last3 = Prelec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Nine Circles of Scientific Hell|url = http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/643|journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science|date = 2012-11-01|issn = 1745-6916|pmid = 26168124|pages = 643–644|volume = 7|issue = 6|doi = 10.1177/1745691612459519}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Research misconduct - The grey area of Questionable Research Practices|url = http://www.vib.be/en/news/Pages/Research-misconduct---The-grey-area-of-Questionable-Research-Practices.aspx|website = www.vib.be|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Questionable Research Practices Revisited|url = http://spp.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/10/19/1948550615612150|journal = Social Psychological and Personality Science|date = 2015-10-19|issn = 1948-5506|pages = 1948550615612150|doi = 10.1177/1948550615612150|first = Klaus|last = Fiedler|first2 = Norbert|last2 = Schwarz|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of over 2,000 psychologists indicated that a majority of respondents admitted to using at least one QRP.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[False positive]] conclusions, often resulting from the [[Publish or perish|pressure to publish]] or the author's own [[confirmation bias]], are an inherent hazard in the field, requiring a certain degree of [[skepticism]] on the part of readers.&lt;ref name="Simmons et al.

Secondly, psychology and social psychology in particular, has found itself at the center of several scandals involving outright fraudulent research, most notably the admitted data fabrication by [[Diederik Stapel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chronicle.com/article/As-Dutch-Research-Scandal/129746/|title=Fraud Scandal Fuels Debate Over Practices of Social Psychology|first=Christopher|last=Shea|date=13 November 2011|publisher=|via=The Chronicle of Higher Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as allegations against others.  However, most scholars acknowledge that fraud is, perhaps, the lesser contribution to replication crises.

Third, several effects in psychological science have been found to be difficult to replicate even before the current replication crisis. For example the scientific journal ''[[Society for Judgment and Decision Making#Publications and journal|Judgment and Decision Making]]'' has published several studies over the years that fail to provide support for the [[unconscious thought theory]]. Replications appear particularly difficult when research trials are pre-registered and conducted by research groups not highly invested in the theory under questioning.

These three elements together have resulted in renewed attention for replication supported by [[Daniel Kahneman|Kahneman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A New Etiquette for Replication|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/225285909/Kahneman-Commentary|first=Daniel|last=Kahneman|via=Scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scrutiny of many effects have shown that several core beliefs are hard to replicate. A recent special edition of the journal ''Social Psychology'' focused on replication studies and a number of previously held beliefs were found to be difficult to replicate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20140530230728/http://www.psycontent.com/content/l67413865317/?p=3f8268e0307f4036906c158b1667c57a&amp;pi=0]&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2012 special edition of the journal ''Perspectives on Psychological Science'' also focused on issues ranging from publication bias to null-aversion that contribute to the replication crises in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6.toc Table of Contents]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the first open empirical study of reproducibility in Psychology was published, called the [[Reproducibility Project]]. Researchers from around the world collaborated to replicate 100 empirical studies from three top Psychology journals. Fewer than half of the attempted replications were successful at producing statistically significant results in the expected directions, though most of the attempted replications did produce trends in the expected directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Open Science Collaboration | title = Estimating the reproducibility of Psychological Science | doi = 10.1126/science.aac4716 | journal = Science | volume = 349 | issue = 6251 | pages = aac4716 | year = 2015 | pmid=26315443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many research trials and meta-analyses are compromised by poor quality and conflicts of interest that involve both authors and professional advocacy organizations, resulting in many false positives regarding the effectiveness of certain types of psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.plos.org/mindthebrain/2014/04/15/meta-analyses-conducted-professional-organizations-trustworthy/ | title=Are meta analyses conducted by professional organizations more trustworthy? | work=Mind the Brain | date=April 15, 2014 | accessdate=September 13, 2016 | first=James | last=Coyne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the British newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that the results of the [[reproducibility project]] show that much of the published research is just "psycho-babble",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/study-reveals-that-a-lot-of-psychology-research-really-is-just-psychobabble-10474646.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Steve | last=Connor | title=Study reveals that a lot of psychology research really is just 'psycho-babble' | date=27 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the replication crisis does not necessarily mean that psychology is unscientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2014/07/replication_controversy_in_psychology_bullying_file_drawer_effect_blog_posts.single.html|title=Why Psychologists’ Food Fight Matters|first1=Michelle N.|last1=Meyer|first2=Christopher|last2=Chabris|date=31 July 2014|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/psychology-is-starting-to-deal-with-its-replication-problem/|title=Psychology Is Starting To Deal With Its Replication Problem|date=27 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/|title=Science Isn’t Broken|date=19 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather this process is a healthy if sometimes acrimonious part of the scientific process in which old ideas or those that cannot withstand careful scrutiny are pruned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/may/28/psychology-replication-drive-methods-bullying|title=Psychology’s replication drive: it’s not about you|first=Pete|last=Etchells|date=28 May 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An Agenda for Purely Confirmatory Research|url = http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/632|journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science|date = 2012-11-01|issn = 1745-6916|pmid = 26168122|pages = 632–638|volume = 7|issue = 6|doi = 10.1177/1745691612463078|first = Eric-Jan|last = Wagenmakers|first2 = Ruud|last2 = Wetzels|first3 = Denny|last3 = Borsboom|first4 = Han L.

Nobel laureate and professor emeritus in psychology [[Daniel Kahneman]] argued that the original authors should be involved in the replication effort because the published methods are often too vague.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/jun/10/physics-envy-do-hard-sciences-hold-the-solution-to-the-replication-crisis-in-psychology|title=Physics envy: Do ‘hard’ sciences hold the solution to the replication crisis in psychology?|first=Chris|last=Chambers|date=10 June 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others such as Dr. Andrew Wilson disagree and argue that the methods should be written down in detail&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/jun/10/physics-envy-do-hard-sciences-hold-the-solution-to-the-replication-crisis-in-psychology|title=Physics envy: Do ‘hard’ sciences hold the solution to the replication crisis in psychology?|first=Chris|last=Chambers|date=10 June 2014|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;. An investigation of replication rates in psychology in 2012 indicated higher success rates of replication in replication studies when there was author overlap with the original authors of a study&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Replications in Psychology Research How Often Do They Really Occur?|url = http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/537|journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science|date = 2012-11-01|issn = 1745-6916|pmid = 26168110|pages = 537–542|volume = 7|issue = 6|doi = 10.1177/1745691612460688|first = Matthew C.|last = Makel|first2 = Jonathan A.|last2 = Plucker|first3 = Boyd|last3 = Hegarty}}&lt;/ref&gt; (91.7% successful replication rates in studies with author overlap compared to 64.6% success replication rates without author overlap).

====Psychology replication rates====
A report by the [[Center for Open Science|Open Science Collaboration]] in August 2015 that was coordinated by [[Brian Nosek]] estimated the reproducibility of 100 studies in psychological science from three high-ranking psychology journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science|url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716|journal = Science|date = 2015-08-28|issn = 0036-8075|pmid = 26315443|pages = aac4716|volume = 349|issue = 6251|doi = 10.1126/science.aac4716|first = Open Science|last = Collaboration}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, 36% of the replications yielded significant findings (''p'' value below 0.05) compared to 97% of the original studies that had significant effects. The mean [[effect size]] in the replications was approximately half the magnitude of the effects reported in the original studies.

The same paper examined the reproducibility rates and effect sizes by journal (''[[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]'' [JPSP], ''[[Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition]]'' [JEP:LMC], ''[[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]]'' [PSCI]) and discipline ([[social psychology]], [[cognitive psychology]]). Study replication rates were 23% for JPSP, 38% for JEP:LMC, and 38% for PSCI. Studies in the field of cognitive psychology had a higher replication rate (50%) than studies in the field of social psychology (25%).

An analysis of the publication history in the top 100 psychology journals between 1900 and 2012 indicated that approximately 1.6% of all psychology publications were replication attempts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Articles were considered a replication attempt if the term "replication" appeared in the text. A subset of those studies (500 studies) was randomly selected for further examination and yielded a lower replication rate of 1.07% (342 of the 500 studies [68.4%]  were actually replications). In the subset of 500 studies, analysis indicated that 78.9% of published replication attempts were successful. The rate of successful replication was significantly higher when at least one author of the original study was part of the replication attempt (91.7% relative to 64.6%).

A study published in 2018 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature Human Behaviour]]'' sought to replicate 21 social and behavioral science papers from ''Nature'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]],'' finding that only 13 could be successfully replicated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/social-science-reproducibility|title=The Science Behind Social Science Gets Shaken Up—Again|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-08-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== A disciplinary social dilemma ====
Highlighting the social structure that discourages replication in psychology, Brian D. Earp and Jim A. C. Everett enumerated five points as to why replication attempts are uncommon&lt;ref&gt;see also [http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00621/abstract Earp and Trafimow], 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Everett 1152"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A tragedy of the (academic) commons: interpreting the replication crisis in psychology as a social dilemma for early-career researchers|url = http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01152/abstract|journal = Frontiers in Psychology|date = 2015-01-01|pmc = 4527093|pmid = 26300832|pages = 1152|doi = 10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01152|first = Jim Albert Charlton|last = Everett|first2 = Brian D.|last2 = Earp|volume=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Independent, direct replications of others’ findings can be time-consuming for the replicating researcher
# "[Replications] are likely to take energy and resources directly away from other projects that reflect one’s own original thinking
# "[Replications] are generally harder to publish (in large part because they are viewed as being unoriginal)
# "Even if [replications] are published, they are likely to be seen as 'bricklaying' exercises, rather than as major contributions to the field
# "[Replications] bring less recognition and reward, and even basic career security, to their authors"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Resolving the replication crisis in social psychology? A new proposal|url = http://www.spsp.org/blog/resolving-replication-crisis-social-psychology|publisher=Society for Personality and Social Psychology|accessdate = 2015-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons the authors advocated that psychology is facing a disciplinary social dilemma, where the interests of the discipline are at odds with the interests of the individual researcher.

==== "Methodological terrorism" controversy ====
With the replication crisis of psychology earning attention, Princeton University psychologist Susan Fiske drew controversy for calling out critics of psychology.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/susan-fiske-methodological-terrorism-2016-9?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=Scientists are furious after a famous psychologist accused her peers of 'methodological terrorism'|work=Business Insider|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/publications/observer/obsonline/draft-of-observer-column-sparks-strong-social-media-response.html|title=Draft of Observer Column Sparks Strong Social Media Response|work=Association for Psychological Science|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fiske|first=APS Past President Susan T.|date=2016-10-31|title=A Call to Change Science’s Culture of Shaming|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/a-call-to-change-sciences-culture-of-shaming|journal=APS Observer|language=en-US|volume=29|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/10/inside-psychologys-methodological-terrorism-debate.html|title=Inside Psychology’s ‘Methodological Terrorism’ Debate|last=Singal|first=Jesse|work=Science of Us|access-date=2017-10-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She called these unnamed "adversaries" names such as "methodological terrorist" and "self-appointed data police", and said that criticism of psychology should only be expressed in private or through contacting the journals.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Columbia University statistician and political scientist Andrew Gelman, "well-respected among the researchers driving the replication debate", responded to Fiske, saying that she had found herself willing to tolerate the "dead paradigm" of faulty statistics and had refused to retract publications even when errors were pointed out.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://andrewgelman.com/2017/10/04/breaking-pnas-changes-slogan/|title=BREAKING . . . . . . .

=== In medicine ===
Out of 49 medical studies from 1990–2003, with more than 1000 citations, 45 claimed that studied therapy was effective. Out of these studies, 16% were contradicted by subsequent studies, 16% had found stronger effects than did subsequent studies, 44% were replicated, and 24% remained largely unchallenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.294.2.218|title=Contradicted and initially stronger effects in highly cited clinical research|first=|last=Ioannidis JA|date=13 July 2005|publisher=|journal=JAMA|volume=294|issue=2|pages=218–228|via=Silverchair|doi=10.1001/jama.294.2.218|pmid=16014596}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1977–90 found flaws in 10–20% of medical studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08989629208573811|title=Scientific data audit—A key management tool|first=J.

A 2016 article by [[John Ioannidis]], Professor of Medicine and of Health Research and Policy at Stanford University School of Medicine and a Professor of Statistics at Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences, elaborated on "Why Most Clinical Research Is Not Useful".&lt;ref name="Ioannidis2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ioannidis | first1 = JPA | year = 2016 | title = Why Most Clinical Research Is Not Useful | url = http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002049 | journal = PLoS Med | volume = 13 | issue = 6| page = e1002049 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.1002049 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article Ioannidis laid out some of the problems and called for reform, characterizing certain points for medical research to be useful again – one example he made was the need for medicine to be "Patient Centered" (e.g. in the form of the [[Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute]]) instead of the current practice to mainly take care of "the needs of physicians, investigators, or sponsors". Ioannidis is known for his research focus on science itself since the 2005 paper "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Why Most Published Research Findings Are False|journal=[[PLoS Medicine]]|date=August 1, 2005|issn=1549-1277|pmc=1182327|pmid=16060722|volume=2|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124|first=John P.

== Causes of the crisis ==
In a work published in 2015 Glenn Begley and [[John Ioannidis]] offer five bullets as to summarize the present predicaments:&lt;ref name="Begley-Ioannidis2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Begley, C.

In fact some predictions of a possible crisis in the quality control mechanism of science can be traced back several decades, especially among scholars in [[science and technology studies]] (STS). [[Derek de Solla Price]] – considered the father of [[scientometrics]] – predicted that science could reach 'senility' as a result of its own exponential growth.&lt;ref name="DeSollaPrice1963"&gt;{{cite book|author1=De Solla Price|author2=Derek J.|year=1963|title=Little science big science|publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some present day literature seems to vindicate this 'overflow' prophesy, lamenting at decay in both attention and quality.&lt;ref name="Siebert-al2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Siebert, S.|author2=Machesky, L.

H.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2015|title=Overflow in science and its implications for trust|journal=eLife|volume=4|page=e10825|doi=10.7554/eLife.10825|pmid=26365552|pmc=4563216}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Della-Briotta-al2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Della Briotta Parolo, P.|author2=Kumar Pan|author3=R.

Philosopher and historian of science [[Jerome R. Ravetz]] predicted in his 1971 book ''[[Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems]]'' that science – in moving from the little science made of restricted communities of scientists to big science or techno-science – would suffer major problems in its internal system of quality control. Ravetz anticipated that modern science's system of rewarding scientists for research might become dysfunctional, the present 'publish or perish' challenge, creating [[perverse incentives]] to publish any findings however dubious. For Ravetz quality in science is maintained when there is a community of scholars linked by norms and standards, and a willingness to stand by these.

Historian [[Philip Mirowski]] offered more recently a similar diagnosis in his 2011 book ''Science Mart'' (2011).&lt;ref name="Mirowski"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mirowski, P.|year=2011|title=Science-Mart: Privatizing American Science|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  'Mart' is here a reference to the retail giant 'Walmart' and an allusion to the commodification of science. In the analysis of Mirowski, when science becomes a commodity being traded in a market, its quality collapses. Mirowski argues his case by tracing the decay of science to the decision of major corporations to close their in-house laboratories in order to outsource their work to universities, and subsequently to move their research away from universities to even cheaper contract research organizations (CRO).

The crisis of science's quality control system is affecting the use of science for policy. This is the thesis of a recent work by a group of STS scholars, who identify in 'evidence based (or informed) policy' a point of present tension.&lt;ref name="Benessia-al2016"&gt;Benessia, A., Funtowicz, S., Giampietro, M., Guimarães Pereira, A., Ravetz, J., Saltelli, A., Strand, R., van der Sluijs, J., 2016.

== Addressing the replication crisis ==
[[Reproducibility|Replication]] has been referred to as "the cornerstone of science".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Most Published Research Findings Are False—But a Little Replication Goes a Long Way|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040028|journal = PLoS Med|date = 2007-02-27|pmc = 1808082|pmid = 17326704|pages = e28|volume = 4|issue = 2|doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0040028|first = Ramal|last = Moonesinghe|first2 = Muin J|last2 = Khoury|first3 = A.

The integrity of scientific findings and reproducibility of research are important as they form the knowledge foundation on which future studies are built.

=== Tackling publication bias with pre-registration of studies ===

Main article: [[Registered report]]

A recent innovation in scientific publishing to address the replication crisis is through the use of [[registered report|registered reports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Registered Replication Reports|publisher=Association for Psychological Science|url = http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/replication|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psychology’s ‘registration revolution'|url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/may/20/psychology-registration-revolution|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-11-13|first = Chris|last = Chambers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The registered report format requires authors to submit a description of the study methods and analyses prior to data collection. Once the method and analysis plan is vetted through peer-review, publication of the findings is provisionally guaranteed, based on whether the authors follow the proposed protocol. One goal of registered reports is to circumvent the [[publication bias]] toward significant findings that can lead to implementation of questionable research practices and to encourage publication of studies with rigorous methods.

The journal ''[[Psychological Science (journal)|Psychological Science]]'' has encouraged the preregistration of studies and the reporting of effect sizes and confidence intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Replication in Psychological Science|url = http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/09/0956797615616374|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151114060748/http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2015/11/09/0956797615616374|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2015-11-14|journal = Psychological Science|date = 2015-11-09|issn = 0956-7976|pmid = 26553013|pages = 1827–32|doi = 10.1177/0956797615616374|first = D. Stephen|last = Lindsay|volume = 26|issue = 12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editor in chief also noted that the editorial staff will be asking for replication of studies with surprising findings from examinations using small sample sizes before allowing the manuscripts to be published.

Moreover, only a very small proportion of academic journals in psychology and neurosciences explicitly stated that they welcome submissions of replication studies in their aim and scope or instructions to authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yeung|first=Andy W. K.|date=2017|title=Do Neuroscience Journals Accept Replications?

=== Emphasizing replication attempts in teaching ===
Based on coursework in experimental methods at MIT and Stanford, it has been suggested that methods courses in psychology emphasize replication attempts rather than original studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Teaching Replication|url = http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/600|journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science|date = 2012-11-01|issn = 1745-6916|pmid = 26168118|pages = 600–604|volume = 7|issue = 6|doi = 10.1177/1745691612460686|first = Michael C.|last = Frank|first2 = Rebecca|last2 = Saxe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Harnessing the Undiscovered Resource of Student Research Projects|url = http://pps.sagepub.com/content/7/6/605|journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science|date = 2012-11-01|issn = 1745-6916|pmid = 26168119|pages = 605–607|volume = 7|issue = 6|doi = 10.1177/1745691612459057|first = Jon E.|last = Grahe|first2 = Alan|last2 = Reifman|first3 = Anthony D.|last3 = Hermann|first4 = Marie|last4 = Walker|first5 = Kathryn C.|last5 = Oleson|first6 = Michelle|last6 = Nario-Redmond|first7 = Richard P.|last7 = Wiebe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such an approach would help students learn scientific methodology and provide numerous independent replications of meaningful scientific findings that would test the replicability of scientific findings. Some have recommended that graduate students should be required to publish a high-quality replication attempt on a topic related to their doctoral research prior to graduation.&lt;ref name="Everett 1152"/&gt;

=== Reducing the ''p''-value required for claiming significance of new results ===

Many publications require a ''p''-value of ''p'' &lt; 0.05 to claim statistical significance.  The paper "Redefine statistical significance",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Redefine statistical significance|url = https://psyarxiv.com/mky9j|journal = PsyArXiv|first = Daniel|last = Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed by a large number of scientists and mathematicians, proposes that in "fields where the threshold for defining statistical significance for new discoveries is ''P'' &lt; 0.05, we propose a change to ''P'' &lt; 0.005. This simple step would immediately improve the reproducibility of scientific research in many fields."

Their rationale is that "a leading cause of non-reproducibility (is that the) statistical standards of evidence for claiming new discoveries in many fields of science are simply too low. Associating 'statistically significant' findings with ''P'' &lt; 0.05 results in a high rate of false positives even in the absence of other experimental, procedural and reporting problems."

=== Addressing the misinterpretation of ''p''-values ===
Although statisticians are unanimous that use of the ''p'' &lt; 0.05 provides weaker evidence than is generally appreciated, there is a lack of unanimity about what should be done about it.  Some have advocated that Bayesian methods should replace ''p''-values. This has not happened on a wide scale, partly because it is complicated, and partly because many users distrust the specification of prior distributions in the absence of hard data.  A simplified version of the Bayesian argument, based on testing a point null hypothesis was suggested by Colquhoun (2014, 2017).&lt;ref name=DC2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colquhoun|first1=David|title=An investigation of the false discovery rate and the misinterpretation of ''p''-values|journal=Royal Society Open Science|year=2015|volume=1|page=140216|doi=10.1098/rsos.140216|arxiv=1407.5296|bibcode=2014RSOS....140216C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DC2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Colquhoun|first1=David|title=The reproducibility of research and the misinterpretation of p-values|journal=Royal Society Open Science|date=2017|doi=10.1098/rsos.171085|url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/12/171085#abstract-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The logical problems of inductive inference were discussed in "The problem with p-values" (2016).&lt;ref name="DC2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colquhoun|first1=David|title=The problem with p-values|url=https://aeon.co/essays/it-s-time-for-science-to-abandon-the-term-statistically-significant|work=Aeon Magazine|accessdate=11 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hazards of reliance on ''p''-values were emphasized by pointing out that even observation of ''p'' = 0.001 was not necessarily strong evidence against the null hypothesis.&lt;ref name="DC2017"/&gt; Despite the fact that the likelihood ratio in favour of the alternative hypothesis over the null is close to 100, if the hypothesis was implausible, with a prior probability of a real effect being 0.1, even the observation of ''p'' = 0.001 would have a false positive risk of 8 percent.  It wouldn't even reach the 5 percent level.

It was recommended&lt;ref name="DC2017"/&gt; that the terms "significant" and "non-significant" should not be used. ''p''-values and confidence intervals should still be specified, but they should be accompanied by an indication of the false positive risk. It was suggested that the best way to do this is to calculate the prior probability that would be necessary to believe in order to achieve a false positive risk of, say, 5%.  The calculations can be done with R scripts that are provided,&lt;ref name="DC2017"/&gt; or, more simply, with a web calculator.&lt;ref name="fpr-calc"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Longstaff|first1=Colin|last2=Colquhoun|first2=David|title=Calculator for false positive risk (FPR)|url=http://fpr-calc.ucl.ac.uk/|publisher=UCL}}&lt;/ref&gt; This so-called reverse Bayesian approach, which was suggested by Matthews (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matthews|first1=RAJ|title=Why should clinicians care about Bayesian methods?|journal=J. Stat. Plan. Inference|date=2001|volume=94|pages=43–58|doi=10.1016/S0378-3758(00)00232-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one way to avoid the problem that the prior probability is rarely known.

=== Encouraging use of larger sample sizes ===
To improve the quality of replications, larger [[Sample size determination|sample sizes]] than those used in the original study are often needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Is psychology suffering from a replication crisis?

=== Sharing raw data in online repositories ===
Online repositories where data, protocols, and findings can be stored and evaluated by the public seek to improve the integrity and reproducibility of research. Examples of such repositories include the [[Center for Open Science#Open Science Framework|Open Science Framework]], [[Registry of Research Data Repositories]], and Psychfiledrawer.org. Sites like Open Science Framework offer badges for using open science practices in an effort to incentivize scientists. However, there has been concern that those who are most likely to provide their data and code for analyses are the researchers that are likely the most sophisticated.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Anticipating consequences of sharing raw data and code and of awarding badges for sharing|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895435615003261|journal = Journal of Clinical Epidemiology|volume = 70|pages = 258–60|doi = 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2015.04.015|pmid = 26163123|first = John P.A.|last = Ioannidis|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Ioannidis at Stanford University suggested that "the paradox may arise that the most meticulous and sophisticated and method-savvy and careful researchers may become more susceptible to criticism and reputation attacks by reanalyzers who hunt for errors, no matter how negligible these errors are".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Funding for replication studies ===
In July 2016 the [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] made 3 million Euros available for replication studies. The funding is for replication based on reanalysis of existing data and replication by collecting and analysing new data. Funding is available in the areas of social sciences, health research and healthcare innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NWO makes 3 million available for Replication Studies pilot|url=http://www.nwo.nl/en/news-and-events/news/2016/nwo-makes-3-million-available-for-replication-studies-pilot.html|website=NWO|accessdate=2 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the [[Laura and John Arnold Foundation]] funded the launch of [[Reproducibility Project#Center for Open Science|The Center for Open Science]] with a $5.25 million grant and by 2017 had provided an additional $10 million in funding.&lt;ref name=Wired2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Apple|first1=Sam|title=The Young Billionaire Behind the War on Bad Science|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/01/john-arnold-waging-war-on-bad-science/|work=Wired|date=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It also funded the launch of the [[Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford]] at Stanford University run by [[John Ioannidis]] and Steven Goodman to study ways to improve scientific research.&lt;ref name=Wired2017/&gt;  It also provided funding for the [[AllTrials]] initiative led in part by [[Ben Goldacre]].&lt;ref name=Wired2017/&gt;

=== Emphasize triangulation, not just replication ===

Marcus R. Munafò and George Davey Smith argue, in a piece published by ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', that research should emphasize triangulation, not just replication. They claim that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"replication alone will get us only so far (and) might actually make matters worse... We believe that an essential protection against flawed ideas is triangulation. This is the strategic use of multiple approaches to address one question. Each approach has its own unrelated assumptions, strengths and weaknesses. Results that agree across different methodologies are less likely to be [[Artifact (error)|artefacts]].... Maybe one reason replication has captured so much interest is the often-repeated idea that falsification is at the heart of the scientific enterprise. This idea was popularized by [[Karl Popper]]'s 1950s maxim that theories can never be proved, only [[Falsifiability|falsified]].  Yet an overemphasis on repeating experiments could provide an unfounded sense of certainty about findings that rely on a single approach.... philosophers of science have moved on since Popper. Better descriptions of how scientists actually work include what epistemologist [[Peter Lipton]] called in 1991 "inference to the best explanation"."&lt;ref name=Munafo2018&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munafò|first1=Marcus R.|last2=Smith|first2=George Davey|title=Robust research needs many lines of evidence|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-01023-3|work=Nature|date=January 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man's First Journey to the Moon''''' is a 2018 nonfiction book by [[Robert Kurson]] recounting [[NASA]]'s 1968 [[Apollo 8]] mission, which was the first manned [[spacecraft]] to reach the [[Moon]] and return safely to Earth.&lt;ref name="para"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/books/review/robert-kurson-rocket-men.html | title = The Paradoxes and the Glory of Apollo 8’s Journey Around the Moon | date = 15 May 2018 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = ''New York Times'' | author = M. G. Lord }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is Kurson's fourth, and it debuted on the ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller list.&lt;ref name="lista"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2018/05/13/science/ | title = Books - Bestsellers - Science | date = 1 May 2018 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = ''New York Times'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Kurson drew on hundreds of hours of one-on-one interviews with NASA staff, industry experts, astronauts (including all three Apollo 8 astronauts) and their families as source material for the book.&lt;ref name="dail"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.milwaukeemag.com/pec-events/nyt-bestselling-author-robert-kurson-rocket-men-the-daring-odyssey-of-apollo-8-and-the-astronauts-who-made-mans-first-journey-to-the-moon/ | title = NYT bestselling author Robert Kurson – Rocket Men: The Daring Odyssey of Apollo 8 and the Astronauts Who Made Man's First Journey to the Moon | date = 9 May 2018 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = ''Milwaukee Magazine'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2018/05/21/apollo-8-moon-mission-focus-new-book/608628002/ | title = First space mission to the moon recounted in new book | date = 21 May 2018 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = ''Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017 ''[[The Martian (Weir novel)|The Martian]]'' author [[Andy Weir]] reported that he read an advanced copy of ''Rocket Men''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/books/review/andy-weir-by-the-book.html | title = Andy Weir: By the Book | date = 17 November 2017 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = ''New York Times'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

''Rocket Men'' is an account of the Apollo 8 mission with focus on [[Frank Borman]], [[Jim Lovell]] and [[William Anders]], the three astronauts aboard during the mission. The book also places an emphasis on the astronauts' families during the mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/la-grange/community/chi-ugc-article-2018-brookfield-reads-to-feature-rocket-men-2018-04-11-story.html | title = 2018 BROOKFIELD READS! to Feature Rocket Men by Robert Kurson | date = 11 April 2018 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = ''Chicago Tribune'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From The ''[[Washington Post]]'':

:"'Rocket Men' opens in summer 1968, with the space race in high gear. The Soviet Union had already put the world’s first satellite, Sputnik, as well as the first human, Yuri Gagarin, into Earth’s orbit. The Soviets were projected to reach the moon by the end of the year, months ahead of the United States."&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/why-the-hurried-mission-to-orbit-the-moon-before-the-soviets-was-so-dangerous/2018/04/06/f291f830-216f-11e8-badd-7c9f29a55815_story.html?utm_term=.0e832e590073 | title = Why the hurried mission to orbit the moon before the Soviets was so dangerous | date = 6 April 2018 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = ''Washington Post'' | author = Mary Roach }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book includes chapters dedicated to each astronaut, the [[Space Race]] itself, and background and chronological progress of the mission including critical maneuvers and mission setbacks.&lt;ref name="wash" /&gt; It is set against the backdrop of 1968, considered by many to be among the most divisive and violent years in American history.&lt;ref name="tsr"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3472/1 | title = Review: Rocket Men | date = 16 April 2018 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = ''Space Review'' }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The book reached #7 on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list and has received positive reviews from critics.&lt;ref name="lista" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tsr" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dherald"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dailyherald.com/entlife/20180416/rocket-men-author-stops-in-highwood-thursday | title = 'Rocket Men' author stops in Highwood Thursday | date = 17 April 2018 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = ''Chicago Daily Herald'' | author = Michael Hill }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[USA Today]]'' called ''Rocket Men'' a "first-rate account of this remarkable spaceflight" and added, "There are many pieces to the Apollo 8 story, but Kurson brings them together effortlessly."&lt;ref name="today"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2018/04/13/book-review-rocket-men-robert-kurson-apollo-8-mission-1968/512445002/ | title = Story of Apollo 8's historic 1968 mission soars in Robert Kurson's fine 'Rocket Men' | date = 13 April 2018 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = ''USA Today'' | author = George Petras }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' called the book "gripping" and "a riveting introduction to the [Apollo 8] flight" in which "Kurson details the mission in crisp, suspenseful scenes."&lt;ref name="para" /&gt; Writing for The ''Washington Post'', [[Mary Roach]] compared the book to [[Alfred Lansing]]'s ''[[Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage|Endurance]]'' and [[Jon Krakauer]]'s ''[[Into Thin Air]]'' and called Kurson's writing style, "as close to a movie as writing gets."&lt;ref name="wash" /&gt;

The film rights to ''Rocket Men'' were secured by Makeready prior to the book's publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://deadline.com/2017/08/makeready-acquires-rocket-men-book-apollo-8-mission-tv-adaptation-1202142453/ | title = Makeready Acquires ‘Rocket Men’ Book About Apollo 8 Mission For TV Adaptation | date = 4 August 2017 | accessdate = 9 July 2018 | publisher = ''Deadline'' | author = Nellie Andreeva }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scientific literature''' comprises scholarly [[publication]]s that report original [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] and [[theoretical]] work in the [[natural science|natural]] and [[social science]]s, and within an academic field, often abbreviated as '''the literature'''.  [[Academic publishing]] is the process of contributing the results of one's [[research]] into the literature, which often requires a peer-review process. Original [[scientific research]] published for the first time in [[scientific journal]]s is called the [[primary literature]]. Patents and [[technical report]]s, for minor research results and engineering and design work (including computer software), can also be considered primary literature. [[Secondary source]]s include review articles (which summarize the findings of published studies to highlight advances and new lines of research) and [[book]]s (for large projects or broad arguments, including compilations of articles). [[Tertiary source]]s might include [[encyclopedia]]s and similar works intended for broad public consumption.

== Types of scientific publications ==

Scientific literature can include the following kinds of publications:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Öchsner|first=Andreas|title=Types of Scientific Publications|date=2013|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38646-6_3|work=Introduction to Scientific Publishing|pages=9–21|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-38646-6_3|isbn=9783642386459|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* scientific articles published in [[Scientific journal|scientific journals]]
* [[Patent|patents]] specialized for science and technology (for example, [[Biological patent|biological patents]] and [[Chemical patent|chemical patents]])
* [[Book|books]] wholly written by one or a small number of co-[[Author|authors]]
* [[Edited volume|edited volumes]], where each [[Chapter (books)|chapter]] is the responsibility of a different author or set of authors, while the [[Editing|editor]] is responsible for determining the scope of the project, keeping the work on schedule, and ensuring consistency of style and content
* presentations at [[Academic conference|academic conferences]], especially those organized by [[Learned society|learned societies]]
* [[government]] reports such as a [[forensic investigation]] conducted by a government agency such as the [[NTSB]]
* scientific publications on the [[World Wide Web]]
* books, [[Technical report|technical reports]], [[Pamphlet|pamphlets]], and [[Working paper|working papers]] issued by individual researchers or research organizations on their own initiative; these are sometimes organised into a series
* [[blogs]] and science forums

Literature may also be published in areas considered to be "[[Grey literature|grey]]", as they are published outside of traditional channels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This material is traditionally not indexed by major databases and can include manuals, theses and dissertations, or newsletters and bulletins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The significance of different types of the scientific publications can vary between disciplines and change over time.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to James G. Speight and Russell Foote, peer-reviewed journals are the most prominent and prestigious form of publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ORgP4AwPtQC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;dq=peer-reviewed+journal+articles+remain+the+predominant+publication+type,+and+have+the+highest+prestige.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ssTqWvQvWE&amp;sig=nLzMKCNc2qRGt3auPXHrH7TXh54&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjSwLGLpqLeAhXEzlMKHc9xDUcQ6AEwAXoECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=peer-reviewed%20journal%20articles%20remain%20the%20predominant%20publication%20type,%20and%20have%20the%20highest%20prestige.&amp;f=false|title=Ethics in Science and Engineering|last=Speight|first=James G.|last2=Foote|first2=Russell|date=2011-04-27|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781118104842|location=|pages=241|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally books published by university presses are usually considered more prestigious than those published by commercial presses.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The status of working papers and [[conference proceeding]]s depends on the discipline; they are typically more important in the [[applied sciences]]. The value of publication as a [[preprint]] or scientific report on the web has in the past been low, but in some subjects, such as [[mathematics]] or [[high energy physics]], it is now an accepted alternative.{{citationneeded|date=October 2018}}

=== Scientific papers and articles ===
There are ten different types of scientific papers. Eight of these carry specific objectives, while the other two can vary depending on the style and the intended goal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peh|first=Wilfred|date=2008|title=Basic structure and types of scientific papers|url=|journal=Effective Medical Writing|volume=|pages=|via=Singapore Medical Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Papers that carry specific objectives are:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

* '''The original article''' provides new information from original research usually supported by statistics.
* '''case reports''' are unique events that researchers look at to gain information on what they are researching.
* '''technical notes''' this is a description of a technique or piece of equipment that has been modified from an existing one to be new and more effective.
* '''[[pictorial essay]]''' are a series of images high in quality that's goal is to teach what the pictures are of.
* '''[[Review article|review]]''' is a detailed analysis of recent developments on a topic.
* '''commentary''' is a short summery of an author's personal experience.
* '''[[Editorial|editorials]]''' are short reviews or critiques of original articles.
* '''letters to the editor''', these are comments directed to the editor of an article to ask questions and provide constructive criticism.

These two have varying types of scientific classifications and can range from historical articles to speeches:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* '''other.''' Other types of papers not listed under non scientific material or any of the 8 above types of scientific publications are put into this category and vary depending on the objective and style of the article.
* '''nonscientific material.''' This type of material comes from the result of an article being published. it does not advance an article scientifically but instead contributes to its reputation as a scientific article.

==Scientific article==
{{for|broader class of these articles|Scholarly article}}

===Preparation===
The actual day-to-day records of scientific information are kept in research notebooks or logbooks. These are usually kept indefinitely as the basic evidence of the work, and are often kept in duplicate, signed, notarized, and archived. The purpose is to preserve the evidence for scientific priority, and in particular for priority for obtaining patents. They have also been used in scientific disputes.  Since the availability of computers, the notebooks in some data-intensive fields have been kept as database records, and appropriate software is commercially available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work on a project is typically published as one or more technical reports, or articles. In some fields both are used, with preliminary reports, working papers, or [[preprint]]s followed by a formal article. Articles are usually prepared at the end of a project, or at the end of components of a particularly large one. In preparing such an article vigorous rules for [[scientific writing]] have to be followed.

===Language===
{{see also|Impact factor|Copy editing}} 

Often, career advancement depends upon publishing in high-impact journals, which, especially in hard and applied sciences, are usually published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | title=MEDLINE Fact Sheet | publisher=[[United States National Library of Medicine]] | location=Washington DC | accessdate=October 15, 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016122141/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/pubs/factsheets/medline.html | archivedate=October 16, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, scientists with poor English writing skills are at a disadvantage when trying to publish in these journals, regardless of the quality of the scientific study itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pan, Z|title=Crossing the language limitations|journal=PLOS Medicine |volume=3|pages=E410|year=2006|pmid=17002510|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0030410|last2=Gao|first2=J|issue=9|pmc=1576334}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet many{{which|date=August 2018}} international universities require publication in these high-impact journals by both their students and faculty. One way that some international authors are beginning to overcome this problem is by contracting with freelance medical copy editors who are native speakers of English and specialize in ESL (English as a second language) editing to polish their manuscripts' English to a level that high-impact journals will accept.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Structure and style===
{{main|IMRAD}}
A scientific article has a standardized structure, which varies only slightly in different subjects. Although the IMRAD structure emphasizes the organization of content and in scientific journal articles, each section (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion) has unique conventions for scientific writing style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.routledge.com/Scientific-And-Medical-Communication-A-Guide-For-Effective-Practice/Mogull/p/book/9781138842557|title=Scientific And Medical Communication: A Guide For Effective Practice|last=Mogull|first=Scott A.|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781138842557|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, it is not the format that is important, but what lies behind it--the content. However, several key formatting requirements need to be met:

#The title attracts readers' attention and informs them about the contents of the article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langdon-Neuner|first=Elise|title=Titles in medical articles: What do we know about them?|journal=The Write Stuff|year=2007|volume=16|issue=4|pages=158–160|url=http://www.emwa.org/members/indevelopment/neuner.pd|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Titles are distinguished into three main types: declarative titles (state the main conclusion), descriptive titles (describe a paper's content), and interrogative titles (challenge readers with a question that is answered in the text).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vasilev|first=Martin|title=How to write a good title for journal articles|url=http://jeps.efpsa.org/blog/2012/09/01/how-to-write-a-good-title-for-journal-articles/|work=JEPS Bulletin|publisher=European Federation of Psychology Students’ Associations|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some journals indicate, in their instructions to authors, the type (and length) of permitted titles.
#The names and affiliations of all authors are given. In the wake of some [[scientific misconduct]] cases, publishers often require that all co-authors know and agree on the content of the article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scientific fraud#Responsibility of authors and of coauthors]]&lt;/ref&gt;
#An [[abstract (summary)|abstract]] summarizes the work (in a single paragraph or in several short paragraphs) and is intended to represent the article in bibliographic databases and to furnish [[subject metadata]] for indexing services.
# The context of previous scientific investigations should be presented, by citation relevant documents in the existing literature, usually in a section called an "Introduction".
# Empirical techniques, laid out in a section usually called "Materials and Methods", should be described in such a way that a subsequent scientist, with appropriate knowledge of and experience in the relevant field, should be able to repeat the observations and know whether he or she has obtained the same result. This naturally varies between subjects, and does not apply to mathematics and related subjects.
#Similarly, the results of the investigation, in a section usually called "Results", data should be presented in tabular or graphic form ([[image]], [[chart]], [[schematic]], [[diagram]] or [[drawing]]). These display elements should be accompanied by a caption and discussed in the text of the article.
# Interpretation of the meaning of the results is usually addressed in a "Discussion" or "Conclusions" section. The conclusions drawn should be based on the new empirical results while taking established knowledge into consideration, in such a way that any reader with knowledge of the field can follow the argument and confirm that the conclusions are sound.  That is, acceptance of the conclusions must not depend on personal [[appeal to authority|authority]], [[rhetoric|rhetorical skill]], or [[faith]].
# Finally, a "References" or "Literature Cited" section lists the sources cited by the authors.

== Peer review ==
{{main|Scholarly peer review}}
Though peer review and the learned journal format are not themselves an essential part of scientific literature, they are both convenient ways of ensuring that the above fundamental criteria are met. They are essentially a means of [[quality control]], a term which also encompasses other means towards the same goal.

The "quality" being referred to here is the scientific one, which consists of transparency and repeatability of the research for independent verification, the validity of the conclusions and interpretations drawn from the reported data, overall importance for advance within a given field of knowledge, novelty, and in certain fields applicability as well. The lack of peer review is what makes most [[technical report]]s and World Wide Web publications unacceptable as contributions to the literature. The relatively weak peer review often applied to books and chapters in edited books means that their status is also second-tier, unless an author's personal standing is so high that prior achievement and a continued stake in one's reputation within the scientific community signals a clear expectation of quality.

The emergence of institutional digital repositories where scholars can post their work as it is submitted to a print-based journal has taken formal peer review into a state of flux. Though publicizing a preprint online does not prevent it from being peer reviewed, it does allow an unreviewed copy to be widely circulated. On the positive side this change has led to faster dissemination of novel work within the scientific community; on the negative it has made it more difficult to discern a valid scientific contribution from the unmeritorious.

Increasing reliance on [[Indexing and abstracting service|abstracting service]]s, especially on those available electronically, means that the effective criterion for whether a publication format forms part of the established, trusted literature is whether it is covered by these services; in particular, by the specialised service for the discipline concerned such as [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], and by the major interdisciplinary services such as those marketed by the [[Institute for Scientific Information]].

==Ethics==
The transfer of [[copyright]] from author to publisher, used by some journals, can be controversial because many authors want to propagate their ideas more widely and re-use their material elsewhere without the need for permission. Usually an author or authors circumvent that problem by rewriting an article and using other pictures. Some publishers may also want publicity for their journal so will approve [[facsimile]] [[reproduction]] unconditionally; other publishers are more resistant. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In terms of research publications, a number of key issues include and are not restricted to:&lt;ref name="Chanson2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Hubert Chanson]] |title=Digital Publishing, Ethics and Hydraulic Engineering: The Elusive or "Boring" Bore?  |url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:159099 |publisher=In: Stefano Pagliara 2nd International Junior Researcher and Engineer Workshop on Hydraulic Structures (IJREW'08), Pisa, Italy, Keynote, pp. 3-13, 30 July-1 August 2008 |year=2008 |isbn=978-88-8492-568-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Honesty. Honesty and integrity is a duty of each author and person, expert-reviewer and member of journal editorial boards.
* Review process. The peer-review process contributes to the quality control and it is an essential step to ascertain the standing and originality of the research.&lt;ref name="Chanson2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Hubert Chanson]] |title=Research Quality, Publications and Impact in Civil Engineering into the 21st Century.

**Redundant Publications. Publications that contain copyrighted and new unpublished material. &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benos|first=Dale J.|last2=Fabres|first2=Jorge|last3=Farmer|first3=John|last4=Gutierrez|first4=Jessica P.|last5=Hennessy|first5=Kristin|last6=Kosek|first6=David|last7=Lee|first7=Joo Hyoung|last8=Olteanu|first8=Dragos|last9=Russell|first9=Tara|date=2005-2006|title=Ethics and scientific publication|url=https://doi.org/10.1152/advan.00056.2004|journal=Advances in Physiology Education|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=59–74|doi=10.1152/advan.00056.2004|issn=1043-4046|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**Data Fabrications. Is the process of purposefully changing data to make the information more in the favor of the author.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Ethical standards. Recent journal editorials presented some experience of unscrupulous activities.&lt;ref name="Mavinic2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=D. Mavinic |title=The "Art" of Plagiarism |journal=Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering|volume=33|issue=3|pages=iii–vi |year=2006 |isbn= |doi=10.1139/l06-901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AIAA2007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Publication Ethical Standards: Guidelines and Procedures |journal=AIAA Journal |volume=45 |issue=8 |page= 1794 |doi=10.2514/1.32639 |year=2007  |bibcode=2007AIAAJ..45.1794. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Human Welfare Concerns. The guidelines for human experimentation started during WWII with the Nuremberg Code. It has evolved into three main principles from The Belmont Report. The subject must be able to make their own choices to protect themselves, benefits must outweigh the risks, and subjects must be evaluated for their selection and benefits must go to all of society.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
**Animal Welfare Concerns. Is the ethical care of animals in scientific experiments. The APS has set strict guidelines and regulations to stop animals from being unnecessarily harmed in experiments. These are being updated regularly by the APS and is a federal law in the United States enforced by DHHS.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Authorship. Who may claim a right to authorship?&lt;ref name="Chanson2008" /&gt; In which order should the authors be listed?
**Conflicts of Interests. This is referring to the biased assumption due to private interest. It can be done knowingly or not. This is unethical because it makes data inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
**Authors Disputes. The authorship of an article is simply the author of the article. The ethical issue with this is when there are two people that believe to be the author, but there is only one true author. There are guidelines to help pick which get authorship of the writing. The one that does not get authorship is put in the acknowledgments. The guidelines come from NIH and The Council of Science Editors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Scientific writing#History}}

The first recorded editorial pre-publication peer-review occurred in 1665 by the founding editor of ''[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society]]'', [[Henry Oldenburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (2006) p. 220-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/263105/1/399we23.htm|title=The Origin of the Scientific Journal and the Process of Peer Review|last=Select Committee on Science and Technology|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technical and scientific books were a specialty of [[David Van Nostrand]], and his [[David Van Nostrand#Engineering magazine|Engineering Magazine]] re-published contemporary scientific articles.

The site was established by the [[US Navy]] in 1943.  In 1951, US funding to maintain continual presence ran out and observational responsibility was passed to [[Canada]].  The site was manned continuously until 1981.  Starting in 2007, automated observations have been made by the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] &lt;ref&gt;

The [[The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!#Awards|award-winning series]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/parents/catinthehat|title=The Cat in the Hat|work=pbs.org|accessdate=January 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on [[Random House]]'s [[Beginner Books]] franchise and ''The Cat in the Hat's Learning Library'',{{fact|date=August 2018}} and is developed by [[Portfolio Entertainment]], [[Random House Children's Books|Random House Children Entertainment]] and [[Collingwood O'Hare|Collingwood O'Hare Productions]]&lt;ref name=pressrelease2/&gt; in conjunction with [[KQED]] and [[CBC Kids]]. The first season has 40 half-hour episodes.&lt;ref name=pressrelease1/&gt; [[PBS Kids]] renewed it for a second season of 20 episodes which premiered on September 10, 2012. A 20 episode third season is currently in development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldscreen.com/tvkids/season-three-for-portfolios-cat-in-the-hat-series/|title=Season Three for Portfolio’s Cat in the Hat Series|work=Worldscreen|accessdate=February 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Each episode features [[The Cat in the Hat]] (voiced by [[Martin Short]]),&lt;ref name=credits/&gt; who leads neighbours Nick and Sally, the Fish, and Thing One and Thing Two on a variety of adventures in his "Thinga-ma-jigger", a Seussian contraption that can sprout wings, pontoons, booster rockets, change size, and do just about anything else necessary to further the adventure. The adventures are prompted by a question posed by either Nick or Sally at the beginning of each episode,&lt;ref name=pressrelease2/&gt; which will inevitably lead them around the globe to "make natural science discoveries."&lt;ref name=pressrelease1/&gt; Similar to other PBS Kids series such as ''[[Curious George (TV series)|Curious George]]'' and ''[[Sid the Science Kid]]'', ''The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!'' focuses on introducing preschoolers to various science and learning concepts.

==Characters==

===Main===
* [[The Cat in the Hat]] – Voiced by [[Martin Short]] A knowledgeable, adventurous, anthropomorphic cat. He loves to explore the world and act as Nick and Sally's guide, and he frequently speaks in rhyming patterns reminiscent of the [[Dr. Seuss]] character on which he is based.
* Nick – Voiced by [[Jacob Ewaniuk]] (seasons 1-2) and [[Deandray Hamilton]] (season 3) He is Sally's next door neighbour and best friend. He wears an orange sweater, white short-sleeves-undershirt, blue pants, and gray shoes with black soles.
* Sally – Voiced by [[Alexa Torrington]] (seasons 1-2) and [[Halle Nunes]] (season 3)  She is Nick's next door neighbour and best friend. She wears a dark pink headband, short-sleeved white undershirt, a dark pink jumper with 2 matching buttons, and dark pink Mary-Jane shoes with brown soles.
* Fish – Voiced by [[Rob Tinkler]] A moderately pessimistic fish who is loosely based on the fish in the original story. Unlike the fish in the book, however, he is red and appears to belong to the Cat instead of Sally or Nick. He is also much more cooperative in the Cat's adventures.
* Thing One and Thing Two – Also voiced by [[Rob Tinkler]]. The Cat's two zany, energetic helpers of indeterminate species.
* Sally's mom – Voiced by [[Tracey Hoyt]]. Whenever Sally asks permission to go on an adventure with the Cat, her voice is heard responding. In some of the episodes, she appears.
* Nick's mom – Also voiced by [[Tracey Hoyt]]. Whenever Nick asks permission to go on an adventure with the Cat, her voice is heard responding. In some of the episodes, she appears. She talks with a [[Jamaica]]n accent.

===Animals===
*Zhu Zhu – Voiced by [[Heather Bambrick]]. Zhu Zhu is a [[giant panda]] enlisted by the Cat, Sally, and Nick to find a present for their panda. She appears in "Bamboozled" where she lives in the forest of Bamwamabooboo.
*Daphne – A [[dolphin]].
*Fifi – A red [[mouse]].
*Ralph – Sometimes called a [[reindeer]] and sometimes called a caribou who has grey fur. In the Christmas episode, he wins the candy cane hunt and also has been stowed away in the Thingamajigger.
*Buster and Brenda – [[booby|booby bird]]s
*Betty the Beaver – Voiced by Angela Lewis. A beaver who has large teeth, just like a real beaver. The Things destroyed her dam.
*Betty's Friend – Voiced by [[Jeffrey Tambor]]. Betty's friend helped fix her dam. He appeared later in "The Cat In The Hat Knows A Lot About Christmas!".

'''''The Ethos Effect''''' (2003) is a [[science fiction]] novel by American writer [[L. E. Modesitt, Jr.]], a [[sequel]] to ''[[The Parafaith War]]''. It is set in a future where humanity has spread to the stars and divided into several factions. Many factions including the [[Eco-Tech Coalition]], the [[Revenants of the Prophet]] ("revs") and the Taran Empire are engaged in escalating conflict over territory and their competing social philosophies. Against this background, former Taran Empire officer Van C. Albert is recruited by the mysterious [[Trystin Desoll]] to work for the equally mysterious [[Integrated Information Systems]].

While this novel shares many themes that can be found in other novels by Modesitt, ''Ethos'' adds elements of Societal Ethics rather than only involving personal ethics.  This is one of the only books written by Modesitt where a person enacts major political and structural changes in the culture into which the protagonist was raised.

==Literary significance and reception==
Jackie Cassada in her review for ''[[The Library Journal]]'' called this novel a "fast-paced yet complexly plotted work of military sf portrays three-dimensional characters caught up in internal and external battles as they search for ways to combine personal integrity with their professional duties. A thoughtfully written, hard-hitting tale that belongs in most collections."&lt;ref name="Cassada"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cassada|first=Jackie|date=September 15, 2003|title=The Ethos Effect (Book)|journal=Library Journal|volume= 128|issue= 15|pages=95|issn=0363-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Peter Cannon in his review for [[Publishers Weekly]] said that "despite some expository lumps and wooden characterization, thoughtful SF readers will appreciate this weighty tale of humanitarian intentions and social speculations."&lt;ref name="Cannon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cannon|first=Peter|date=October 6, 2003|title=The Ethos Effect (Book)|journal=Publishers Weekly|volume= 250|issue= 40|pages=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frieda Murray reviewing for [[Booklist]] said "Modesitt knows well how to

'''''The New Green Consumer Guide''''' is a practical lifestyle book written by [[Julia Hailes]] and published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] on May 21, 2007.  The aim of the book is to make the ordinary layman engage in the role that he or she must play in the green mission of today.

Julia Hailes is a freelance consultant and well-known speaker on social, environmental and ethical issues. Her work includes environmental reviews, management briefings and advising companies on policy, strategy and communications.

Julia wrote the original Green Consumer Guide in 1987. It was the first book of its kind and sold a million copies worldwide.

The New Green Consumer Guide is a completely new book, full colour, redesigned. This is a practical lifestyle book and its overall message is that living a modern lifestyle doesn’t mean we have to waste energy and resources.

==Reception==
One reviewer concluded "This is a sensible and rational primer for anyone who doesn't want to be patronised but does want a practical and down-to-earth set of suggestions for making environmental lifestyle changes.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thebookbag.co.uk/reviews/index.php?title=The_New_Green_Consumer_Guide_by_Julia_Hailes| publisher=Bookbag | title=Review: The New Green Consumer Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Population Bomb''''' is a best-selling book written by [[Stanford University]] Professor [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] and his wife, [[Anne H. Ehrlich|Anne Ehrlich]] (who was uncredited), in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/cgi-bin/ccb/content/paul-r-ehrlich|title=Paul R. Ehrlich - Center for Conservation Biology|publisher=Stanford University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Population Bomb Revisited"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Paul R. Ehrlich|author2= Anne H. Ehrlich|title=The Population Bomb Revisited|url=http://www.populationmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/Population-Bomb-Revisited-Paul-Ehrlich-20096.pdf|journal=Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development|year=2009|volume= 1 | issue = 3 |pages=63–71|accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It warned of mass starvation of humans in the 1970s and 1980s due to [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], as well as other major societal upheavals, and advocated immediate action to limit population growth. Fears of a "population explosion" were widespread in the 1950s and 1960s, but the book and its author brought the idea to an even wider audience.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The phrase "population bomb", was already in use. For example, see this article. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1849103&amp;blobtype=pdf Quality Analysis and Quality Control], ''Canadian Medical Association Journal'', June 9, 1962, vol. 86, p. 1074&lt;/ref&gt;'''''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projectavalon.net/The_Population_Bomb_Paul_Ehrlich.pdf|title=The population bomb|last=Ehrlich|first=Paul|date=|website=project avalon.net|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book has been criticized since its publishing for its alarmist tone, and in recent decades for its inaccurate predictions.  The Ehrlichs stand by the basic ideas in the book, stating in 2009 that "perhaps the most serious flaw in ''The Bomb'' was that it was much too optimistic about the future" and believe that it achieved their goals because "it alerted people to the importance of environmental issues and brought human numbers into the debate on the human future."&lt;ref name="The Population Bomb Revisited"/&gt;

==General description of the book==
[[File:Population curve.svg|thumb|350px|Graph of [[human population]] from 10,000 BC to 2017 AD. It shows the extremely rapid growth in the world population since the eighteenth century.]]

''The Population Bomb'' was written at the suggestion of [[David Brower]] the executive director of the environmentalist [[Sierra Club]], and [[Ian Ballantine]] of [[Ballantine Books]] following various public appearances Ehrlich had made regarding population issues and their relation to the environment. Although the Ehrlichs collaborated on the book, the publisher insisted that a single author be credited, and also asked to change their preferred title: ''Population, Resources, and Environment.''&lt;ref name="The Population Bomb Revisited"/&gt; The title ''Population Bomb'' was taken (with permission) from [[William Henry Draper, Jr.|General William H. Draper]], founder of the [[Population Action International|Population Crisis Committee]] and a pamphlet issued in 1954 by the Hugh Moore Fund. The Ehrlichs regret the choice of title, which they admit was a perfect choice from a marketing perspective, but think that "it led Paul to be miscategorized as solely focused on human numbers, despite our interest in all the factors affecting the human trajectory."&lt;ref name="The Population Bomb Revisited"/&gt;

Early editions of ''The Population Bomb'' began with the statement:
{{quote|''The battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate...''&lt;ref name="Population Bomb"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehrlich, Paul R.|title=The Population Bomb.|publisher=Ballantine Books |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Much of the book is spent describing the state of the environment and the [[food security]] situation, which is described as increasingly dire. Ehrlich argues that as the existing population was not being fed adequately, and as it was growing rapidly it was unreasonable to expect sufficient improvements in food production to feed everyone. He further argued that the growing population placed escalating strains on all aspects of the natural world.  "What needs to be done?" he wrote, "We must rapidly bring the world population under control, reducing the growth rate to zero or making it negative. Conscious regulation of human numbers must be achieved. Simultaneously we must, at least temporarily, greatly increase our food production." Ehrlich described a number of "ideas on how these goals ''might'' be reached."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehrlich, Paul R.|title=The Population Bomb.|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1968|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the United States should take a leading role in population control, both because it was already consuming much more than the rest of the world, and therefore had a moral duty to reduce its impact, and because the US would have to lead international efforts due to its prominence in the world. In order to avoid charges of hypocrisy or racism it would have to take the lead in population reduction efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehrlich, Paul R.|title=The Population Bomb.|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1968|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich floats the idea of adding "[[Chemical castration|temporary sterilants]]" to the water supply or staple foods. However, he rejects the idea as unpractical due to "criminal inadequacy of biomedical research in this area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehrlich, Paul R.|title=The Population Bomb.|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1968|page=136|quote = Those of you who are appalled at such a suggestion can rest easy. The option isn't even open to us, thanks to the criminal inadequacy of biomedical research in this area. If the choice now is either such additives or catastrophe, we shall have catastrophe. It might be possible to develop such population control tools, although the task would not be simple.... Technical problems aside, I suspect you'll agree with me that society would probably dissolve before sterilants were added to the water supply by the government. Just consider the fluoridation controversy. Some other way will have to be found.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests a tax scheme in which additional children would add to a family's tax burden at increasing rates for more children, as well as [[luxury tax]]es on childcare goods. He suggests incentives for men who agree to permanent sterilization before they have two children, as well as a variety of other monetary incentives. He proposes a powerful Department of Population and Environment which "should be set up with the power to take whatever steps are necessary to establish a reasonable population size in the United States and to put an end to the steady deterioration of our environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehrlich, Paul R.|title=The Population Bomb.|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1968|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; The department should support research into population control, such as better [[contraceptive]]s, mass sterilizing agents, and [[prenatal sex discernment]] (because families often continue to have children until a male is born. Ehrlich suggested that if they could choose a male child this would reduce the birthrate). Legislation should be enacted guaranteeing the right to an [[abortion]], and [[sex education]] should be expanded.

After explaining the domestic policies the US should pursue, he discusses foreign policy. He advocates a system of "triage," such as that suggested by William and Paul Paddock in ''[[Famine 1975!]]''. Under this system countries would be divided into categories based on their abilities to feed themselves going forward. Countries with sufficient programmes in place to limit population growth, and the ability to become self-sufficient in the future would continue to receive food aid. Countries, for example India, which were "so far behind in the population-food game that there is no hope that our food aid will see them through to self-sufficiency" would have their food aid eliminated. Ehrlich argued that this was the only realistic strategy in the long-term. Ehrlich applauds the Paddocks' "courage and foresight" in proposing such a solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehrlich, Paul R.|title = The Population Bomb.|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1968|page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich further discusses the need to set up public education programs and agricultural development schemes in developing countries. He argues that the scheme would likely have to be implemented outside the framework of the [[United Nations]] due to the necessity of being selective regarding the targeted regions and countries, and suggests that within countries certain regions should be prioritized to the extent that cooperative [[separatist movement]]s should be encouraged if they are an improvement over the existing authority. He mentions his support for government mandated sterilization of Indian males with three or more children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehrlich, Paul R.|title=The Population Bomb.|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1968|pages=165–66|quote=When he [Indian Minister [[Sripati Chandrasekhar]]] suggested sterilizing all Indian males with three or more children, we should have applied pressure on the Indian government to go ahead with the plan. We should have volunteered logistic support in the form of helicopters, vehicles, and surgical instruments. We should have sent doctors to aid in the program by setting up centers for training para-medical personnel to do vasectomies. Coercion? Perhaps, but coercion in a good cause. I am sometimes astounded at the attitudes of Americans who are horrified at the prospect of our government insisting on population control as the price of food aid. All too often the very same people are fully in support of applying military force against those who disagree with our form of government or our foreign policy. We must be relentless in pushing for population control around the world.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the rest of the book Ehrlich discusses things which readers can do to help. This is focused primarily on changing public opinion to create pressure on politicians to enact the policies he suggests, which he believed were not politically possible in 1968. At the end of the book he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong, a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist. However, he believes that humanity will only be better off if it follows his prescriptions, so that even if he is incorrect it is the right course of action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ehrlich, Paul R.|title=The Population Bomb. |publisher=Ballantine Books|year=1968|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book sold over two million copies, raised the general awareness of population and environmental issues, and influenced 1960s and 1970s public policy.&lt;ref name="The Population Bomb Revisited"/&gt;

==Context==
In 1948, two widely read books were published that would inspire a "[[neo-Malthusian]]" debate on population and the environment: [[Henry Fairfield Osborn, Jr.|Fairfield Osborn]]’s ''[[Our Plundered Planet]]'' and [[William Vogt]]’s ''[[Road to Survival]]''. Although, they are now much less well known than ''Population Bomb'', they inspired many works such as the original ''Population Bomb'' pamphlet by [[Hugh Everett Moore]] in 1954 that inspired the name of Ehrlich's book, as well as some of the original societies concerned with population and environmental matters.&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Post War Intellectual Roots of the Population Bomb|author1=Pierre Desrochers|author2=Christine Hoffbauer|journal=The Electronic Journal of Sustainable Development|url=http://www.biologia.ucr.ac.cr/profesores/Garcia%20Jaime/POBLACION-POBREZA-DESARROLLO%20URBANO/POST_WAR_INTELLECTUAL_ROOTS_OF_THE_POPULATION_BOMB_-_FAIRFIELD_OSBORNS_OUR_PLUNDERED_PLANET_AND_WILLIAM_VOGTS_ROAD_TO_SURVIVAL_IN_RETROSPECT.pdf
|year=2009|volume= 1 | issue = 3 |pages=73–97|accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; D.B. Luten has said that although the book is often seen as a seminal work in the field, the ''Population Bomb'' is actually best understood as "climaxing and in a sense terminating the debate of the 1950s and 1960s.”&lt;ref&gt;Luten, DB 1986."The Limits-to-Growth Controversy" InTR Vale (ed.). Progress against Growth. Daniel B. Lutenon the American Landscape. New York: The Guilford Press, pp. 293–314. [Originally published in K. A. Hammond, G. Macinko and W. Fairchild (eds.) (1978). Sourcebook on the Environment. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, pp. 163–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich has said that he traced his own Malthusian beliefs to a lecture he heard Vogt give when he was attending university in the early 1950s. For Ehrlich, these writers provided “a global framework for things he had observed as a young naturalist."&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Restatement of Malthusian theory===
The ''Population Bomb'' has been characterized by critics as primarily a repetition of the [[Malthusian catastrophe]] argument that population growth will outpace agricultural growth unless controlled. Ehrlich observed that since about 1930 the population of the world had doubled within a single generation, from 2 billion to nearly 4 billion, and was on track to do so again.  He assumed that available resources on the other hand, and in particular food, were nearly at their limits. Some critics compare Ehrlich unfavorably to Malthus, saying that although [[Thomas Malthus]] did not make a firm prediction of imminent catastrophe, Ehrlich warned of a potential massive disaster within the next decade or two. In addition, critics state that unlike Malthus, Ehrlich did not see any means of avoiding the disaster entirely (although some mitigation was possible), and proposed solutions that were much more radical than those discussed by Malthus, such as starving whole countries that refused to implement [[population control]] measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway |author=Dan Gardner|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|year=2010|location=Toronto|pages=247–48|quote=William and Paul Paddock, authors of ''Famine 1975!'', advocated a policy they called "triage": Rich nations should send all their food aid to those poor countries that still had some hope of one day feeding themselves; hopeless countries like India and Egypt should be cut off immediately.... The Paddocks knew countries that lost the aid would plunge into famine... In ''The Population Bomb'', Paul Ehrlich lavishly praised ''Famine 1975!'' ... and declared that "there is no rational choice except to adopt some form of the Paddocks' strategy as far as food distribution is concerned." Even in 1968 it should have been clear that this was glib nonsense.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ehrlich was certainly not unique in his neo-Malthusian predictions, and there was a widespread belief in the 1960s and 70s that increasingly catastrophic famines were on their way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway|author=Dan Gardner|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|year=2010|location=Toronto|pages=130–31|quote=In 1974, at a World Food Congress in Rome, delegates listened somberly to dire forecasts by the likes of Philip Handler, a nutritionist and president of the United States National Academy of Sciences, who concluded that the worst pessimists - the Paddocks and Paul Ehrlich = had been on the mark.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predictions&lt;!--Linked from 'Antinatalism'--&gt;===
The Ehrlichs made a number of specific predictions that did not come to pass, for which they have received criticism. They have acknowledged that some predictions were incorrect. However, they maintain that their general argument remains intact, that their predictions were merely illustrative, that their and others' warnings caused preventive action, or that many of their predictions may yet come true (see [[#Ehrlich's response|Ehrlich's response]] below). Still other commentators have criticized the Ehrlichs' perceived inability to acknowledge mistakes, evasiveness, and refusal to alter their arguments in the face of contrary evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway|author=Dan Gardner|publisher= McClelland and Stewart|year=2010|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Ehrlich told [[Retro Report]], "I do not think my language was too apocalyptic in ''The Population Bomb.'' My language would be even more apocalyptic today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Population Bomb? |url=http://www.retroreport.org/video/the-population-bomb/ |publisher=[[Retro Report]] |date=1 June 2015 |accessdate=15 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Population Bomb''{{'}}s opening lines the authors state that nothing can prevent famines in which hundreds of millions of people will die during the 1970s (amended to 1970s and 80s in later editions), and that there would be "a substantial increase in the world death rate." Although many lives could be saved through dramatic action, it was already too late to prevent a substantial increase in the global [[death rate]]. However, in reality the global death rate has continued to decline substantially since then, from 13/1000 in 1965–74 to 10/1000 from 1985–1990. Meanwhile, the population of the world has more than doubled, while calories consumed/person have increased 24%. The UN does not keep official death-by-hunger statistics so it is hard to measure whether the "hundreds of millions of deaths" number is correct. Ehrlich himself suggested in 2009 that between 200-300 million had died of hunger since 1968. However, that is measured over 40 years rather than the ten to twenty foreseen in the book, so it can be seen as significantly fewer than predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway|author=Dan Gardner|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|year=2010|location=Toronto|pages=7–8, 229–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famine has not been eliminated, but its root cause has been political instability, not global food shortage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/x4400e/x4400e11.htm "Food Security and Nutrition in the Last 50 Years"], ''FAO Corporate Document Repository'', publication date unavailable.&lt;!--access date 2009-09-07--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian economist and [[Nobel Prize]] winner, [[Amartya Sen]], has argued that nations with democracy and a free press have virtually never suffered from extended famines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Massing|first=Michael|title=Does Democracy Avert Famine?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/01/arts/does-democracy-avert-famine.html|accessdate=28 December 2010|work=The New York Times|date=1 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; And while a 2010 UN report stated that 925 million of the world's population of nearly seven billion people were in a constant state of hunger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hunger Stats|url=http://www.wfp.org/hunger/stats|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also notes that the percentage of the world's population who qualify as "undernourished" has fallen by more than half, from 33 percent to about 16 percent, since Ehrlich published ''The Population Bomb.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proportion of undernourished people in developing countries, 1969–71 to 2010|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/012/al390e/al390e00.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ehrlich writes: "I don't see how India could possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980."&lt;ref name="Population Bomb"/&gt; This view was widely held at the time, as another statement of his, later in the book: "I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks that India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971." In the book's 1971 edition, the latter prediction was removed, as the [[Green Revolution in India|food situation in India suddenly improved]].

As of 2010, India had almost 1.2 billion people, having nearly tripled its population from around 400 million in 1960. India's Total Fertility Rate in 2008 was calculated to be 2.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/total-fertility-rate-in-india-on-decline/722989/|title=Total Fertility Rate in India on decline|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the absolute numbers of malnourished children in India is high,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/world/asia/13malnutrition.html|work=The New York Times|first=Somini|last=Sengupta|title=As Indian Growth Soars, Child Hunger Persists|date=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rates of malnutrition and poverty in India have declined from approximately 90% at the time of India's independence, to less than 40% today. Ehrlich's prediction about famines were found to be false, although food security is an issue in India. However, most epidemiologists, public health physicians and demographers identify corruption as the chief cause of malnutrition, not "overpopulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/world/asia/13malnutrition.html|work=The New York Times|first=Somini|last=Sengupta|title=As Indian Growth Soars, Child Hunger Persists|date=13 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Nobel Prize–winning economist Amartya Sen noted, India frequently had famines during British colonial rule. However, since India became a democracy, there have been no recorded famines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,989405,00.html|work=Time|first=Jeffrey|last=Sachs|title=The Real Causes of Famine |date=26 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Dan Gardner has criticized Ehrlich both for his overconfident predictions and his refusal to acknowledge his errors. "In two lengthy interviews, Ehrlich admitted making not a single major error in the popular works he published in the late 1960s and early 1970s … the only flat-out mistake Ehrlich acknowledges is missing the destruction of the rain forests, which happens to be a point that supports and strengthens his world view—and is therefore, in [[cognitive dissonance]] terms, not a mistake at all. Beyond that, he was by his account, off a little here and there, but only because the information he got from others was wrong. Basically, he was right across the board."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway|author=Dan Gardner|publisher=McClelland and Stewart|year=2010|location=Toronto|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan V. Last|Jonathan Last]] called it "one of the most spectacularly foolish books ever published".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan V. Last|Last JV]] (2013) ''What to expect when no one's expecting'', [[Encounter Books]], New York, pp 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Showmanship===
One frequent criticism of ''The Population Bomb'' is that it focused on spectacle and exaggeration at the expense of accuracy. Pierre Desrochers and Christine Hoffbauer remark that "at the time of writing ''The Population Bomb'', Paul and Anne Ehrlich should have been more cautious and revised their tone and rhetoric, in light of the undeniable and already apparent errors and shortcomings of Osborn and Vogt’s analyses."&lt;ref name="intellectual roots"/&gt; Charles Rubin has written that it was precisely because Ehrlich was largely unoriginal and wrote in a clear emotionally gripping style that it became so popular. He quotes a review from ''[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]]'' noting that Ehrlich does not try to "convince intellectually by mind dulling statistics," but rather roars "like an [[Old Testament]] Prophet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8um4nNXG1i0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |author=Charles T. Rubin |year=1994 |title=The green crusade:rethinking the roots of environmentalism |page=79 |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |location=Oxford }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gardner says, "as much as the events and culture of the era, Paul Ehrlich's style explain the enormous audience he attracted." Indeed, an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' helped to propel the success of the book, as well as Ehrlich's celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Future Babble: Why Expert Predictions Fail – and Why We Believe Them Anyway |author=Dan Gardner |publisher=McClelland and Stewart |year=2010 |location=Toronto |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Desrochers and Hoffbauer go on to conclude that it seems hard to deny that using an alarmist tone and emotional appeal were the main lessons that the present generation of environmentalists learned from Ehrlich's success.

===Criticism by Marxists===
On the [[political left]] the book received criticism that it was focusing on "the wrong problem", and that the real issue was one of distribution of resources rather than of overpopulation.&lt;ref name="The Population Bomb Revisited"/&gt; Marxists worried that Ehrlich's work could be used to justify genocide and imperial control, as well as oppression of minorities and disadvantaged groups or even a return to [[eugenics]].&lt;ref&gt;See for example: {{cite book|title=Marx and Engels on the Population Bomb|editor=Ronald L. Meek|publisher=The Ramparts Press|url=http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/literary/96/population.html|year=1973|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000521124318/http://www.fortunecity.com/victorian/literary/96/population.html|archivedate=2000-05-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Commoner]] argued that the Ehrlichs were too focused on overpopulation as the source of environmental problems, and that their proposed solutions were politically unacceptable because of the coercion that they implied, and because the cost would fall disproportionately on the poor. He argued that technological, and above all social development would lead to a natural decrease in both population growth and environmental damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|author=Barry Commoner|date=May 1972|title=A Bulletin Dialogue: on "The Closing Circle" - Response|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwsAAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=17–56|quote=Population control (as distinct from voluntary, self-initiated control of fertility), no matter how disguised, involves some measure of political repression, and would burden the poor nations with the social cost of a situation—overpopulation—which is the current outcome of their previous exploitation, as colonies, by the wealthy nations.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ehrlich's response==
In a 2004 ''[[Grist Magazine]]'' interview,&lt;ref&gt;[http://grist.org/article/ehrlich/full/ Paul Ehrlich, famed ecologist, answers readers' questions], August 13, 2004, ''Grist''&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrlich acknowledged some specific predictions he had made, in the years around the time ''The Population Bomb'' was published, that had ''not'' come to pass. However, as to a number of his fundamental ideas and assertions he maintained that facts and science proved them correct.

In answer to the question: "Were your predictions in ''The Population Bomb'' right?", Ehrlich responded:

''{{quote|Anne and I have always followed UN population projections as modified by the Population Reference Bureau -- so we never made "predictions," even though idiots think we have. When I wrote ''The Population Bomb'' in 1968, there were 3.5 billion people. Since then we've added another 2.8 billion -- many more than the total population (2 billion) when I was born in 1932. If that's not a population explosion, what is? My basic claims (and those of the many scientific colleagues who reviewed my work) were that population growth was a major problem. Fifty-eight academies of science said that same thing in 1994, as did the [[World Scientists' Warning to Humanity|world scientists' warning to humanity]] in the same year. My view has become depressingly mainline!}}''

In another retrospective article published in 2009, Ehrlich said, in response to criticism that many of his predictions had not come to pass:&lt;ref name="The Population Bomb Revisited"/&gt;

''{{quote|the biggest tactical error in ''The Bomb'' was the use of scenarios, stories designed to help one think about the future. Although we clearly stated that they were not predictions and that “we can be sure that none of them will come true as stated,’ (p. 72)—their failure to occur is often cited as a failure of prediction. In honesty, the scenarios were way off, especially in their timing (we underestimated the resilience of the world system). But they did deal with future issues that people in 1968 should have been thinking about – famines, plagues, water shortages, armed international interventions by the United States, and nuclear winter (e.g., Ehrlich et al. 1983, Toon et al. 2007)—all events that have occurred or now still threaten}}''

Dirac gives an account of quantum mechanics by "demonstrating how to construct a completely new theoretical framework from scratch"; "problems were tackled top-down, by working on the great principles, with the details left to look after themselves".&lt;ref name=Farmelo/&gt; It leaves classical physics behind after the first chapter, presenting the subject with a logical structure. Its 82 sections contain 785 equations with no diagrams.&lt;ref name=Farmelo&gt;

Dirac is credited with developing the subject "particularly in [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] between 1925–1927" (Farmelo).&lt;ref name=Farmelo/&gt;

==History==
The first and second editions of the book were published in 1930 and 1935.&lt;ref name="Paul Dirac"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalitz|first=R. H.|title=The Collected Works of P. A. M. Dirac: Volume 1: 1924–1948|year=1995|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521362313|pages=453–454|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBEdMdNWFJIC&amp;pg=453#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947 the third edition of the book was published, in which the chapter on quantum electrodynamics was rewritten particularly with the inclusion of electron-positron creation.&lt;ref name="Paul Dirac" /&gt;

In the fourth edition, 1958, the same chapter was revised, adding new sections on interpretation and applications. Later a revised fourth edition appeared in 1967.&lt;ref name="Paul Dirac" /&gt;

Beginning with the third edition (1947), the mathematical descriptions of quantum states and operators were changed to use the [[Bra–ket notation]], introduced in 1939 and largely developed by Dirac himself &lt;ref name=Dirac&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3613">The '''Thermal Emission Spectrometer''' ('''TES''') is an instrument on board [[Mars Global Surveyor]].  TES collects two types of data, [[hyperspectral]] thermal infrared data from 6 to 50 [[micrometre]]s (μm) and bolometric visible-NIR (0.3 to 2.9 μm) measurements.  TES has six detectors arranged in a 2x3 array, and each detector has a field of view of approximately 3 × 6&amp;nbsp;km on the surface of Mars.
The TES instrument uses the natural harmonic vibrations of the chemical bonds in materials to determine the composition of gases, liquids, and solids.
TES identified a large (30,000 square-kilometer) area that contained the mineral [[olivine]].  Olivine was found in the [[Nili Fossae]] formation.  It is thought that the ancient impact that created the [[Isidis basin]] resulted in faults that exposed the olivine.  Olivine is present in many [[mafic]] volcanic [[rocks]].  In the presence of water it weathers into minerals such as [[goethite]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], [[smectite]], [[maghemite]], and [[hematite]].  Olivine was also discovered in many other small outcrops within 60 degrees north and south of the equator.&lt;ref&gt;Hoefen, T. et al.  2003.  Discovery of Olivine in the Nili Fossae Region of Mars.  Science: 302. 627-630.&lt;/ref&gt;  Olivine has also been found in the [[Martian meteorite|SNC]] ([[shergottite]], [[nakhlite]], and [[Chassigny (meteorite)|chassigny]]) [[meteorites]] that are generally accepted to have come from Mars.&lt;ref&gt;Hamiliton, W. et al.  1997.  Journal of Geophysical Research: 102. 25593&lt;/ref&gt;  Later studies have found the olivine-rich rocks to cover over 113,000 square kilometers.  That is 11 times larger than the five volcanoes on the Big Island of Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/SOEST_News/News/PressReleases/amilton/ ]{{dead link|date=December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Transportation Research Board''' ('''TRB''') is a division of the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] of the United States which serves as an independent adviser to the President of the United States, the Congress and federal agencies on scientific and technical questions of national importance. It is jointly administered by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[National Academy of Engineering]], and the [[National Academy of Medicine]].

As one of seven major divisions of the  National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trb.org/AboutTRB/AboutTRB.aspx|title=About TRB|website=www.trb.org|access-date=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the TRB promotes innovation and progress in transportation through research in an objective and [[interdisciplinary]] setting. It stimulates research and offers research management services that promote technical excellence; provides expert advice on transportation policy and programs; and disseminates research results broadly and encourages their implementation. The TRB hosts some 200 standing committees that address specific aspects of transport and the annual TRB conference attracts more than 13,000 attendees.

==History==
The Transportation Research Board was established in 1920 as 'National Advisory Board on Highway Research', as the 'Highway Research Board' from 1925 until 1974 when it was renamed again as the 'Transportation Research Board'. Initially being solely involved in the sharing of information, it has commissioned ad-hoc research since 1950, became more involved in multi-modal transport in the 1960s and has extended its operations further more recently.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trb.org/AboutTRB/AboutTRB.aspx|title=About|publisher=Transport Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
TRB fulfills this mission through the work of its more than 200 standing committees and task forces addressing all modes and aspects of transportation; publication and dissemination of reports and peer-reviewed technical papers on research findings; management of cooperative research and other research programs; conduct of special studies on transportation policy issues at the request of the U.S. Congress and government agencies; operation of an on-line computerized file of transportation research information; and the hosting of an annual meeting that typically attracts more than 13,000 transportation professionals from throughout the United States and abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trb.org/AnnualMeeting/AnnualMeeting.aspx|title=Annual meeting|publisher=Transport Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board's activities are organized as follows:

* Division A &amp;ndash; Technical Activities
* Division B &amp;ndash; Studies and Special Programs
* Division C &amp;ndash; Administration and Finance
* Division D &amp;ndash; Cooperative Research Programs

TRB's varied activities annually draw on over 7,000 engineers, scientists, and other transportation researchers from the public and private sectors and academia, who contribute expertise in the public interest by participating on TRB committees, panels, and task forces.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trb.org/AboutTRB/AboutTRB.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The program is supported by state [[Department of Transportation|transportation departments]], the various administrations of the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and other federal agencies, industry associations, and other organizations and individuals interested in the development of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trb.org/AboutTRB/AboutTRB.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Publications}}Publications include the [[Highway Capacity Manual]] and ''Transportation Research Record: Journal of the Transportation Research Board''. Transportation Research Information Services (TRIS) offers several databases for researchers:
*The TRID Database is an integrated database that combines the records from TRB's [[TRIS online|Transportation Research Information Services (TRIS) Database]] and the OECD's Joint Transport Research Centre’s International Transport Research Documentation (ITRD) Database. TRID is the world's largest and most comprehensive bibliographic resource on transportation research information. It contains more than one million records of published and ongoing research, covering all modes and disciplines of transportation. More than 156,000 records contain links to full-text documents. The records in TRID are indexed with a standardized vocabulary from the Transportation Research Thesaurus (TRT) or the ITRD Thesaurus, depending on the source organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trid.trb.org/|title=TRIS and TRID|publisher=Transportation Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Research in Progress (RiP) Database contains more than 12,400 current or recently completed transportation research projects, mostly those funded by the modal administrations of the U.S. Department of Transportation, state Departments of Transportation (DOTs), University Transportation Centers, or by TRB's cooperative research programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rip.trb.org/|title=The Research in Progress Database|publisher=Transportation Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Research Needs Statements (RNS) Database An important function of TRB is to stimulate research that addresses issues facing the transportation community. In support of this function, TRB Technical Activities standing committees identify, develop, and disseminate research need statements (RNS) for use by practitioners, researchers, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rns.trb.org/|title=Research Needs Statements (RNS) Database|publisher=Transport Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The TRB Publications Index (Pubsindex) contains bibiliographic information on almost 48,000 papers, articles, and reports published by the Highway Research Board, Transportation Research Board, Strategic Highway Research Program, and the Marine Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubsindex.trb.org/|title=The TRB Publications Index|publisher=Transport Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Practice Ready Papers (PRP) Database] contains papers that are defined as those in which the research results presented and discussed make a contribution to the solution of current or future problems or issues for practitioners. Information presented in these papers is ready for immediate implementation or requires minimal additional research or implementation effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prp.trb.org/ |title=The Practice Ready Papers (PRP Database|publisher=Transport Research Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;
