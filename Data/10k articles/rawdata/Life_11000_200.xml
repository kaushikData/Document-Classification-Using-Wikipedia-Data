{{Ancient Greek painters}}
'''Agatharchus''' or '''Agatharch''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: Ἀγάθαρχος) was a self-taught painter from [[Samos]]&lt;ref&gt;Up through the 19th century, some scholars considered him to have been [[Athens|Athenian]].&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last =Donaldson  | first =John William  | title =The Theatre of the Greeks  | publisher =Pitt Press  | year =1836  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=guoAA0UZm8wC&amp;dq=agatharchus  | page =280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is said by [[Vitruvius]] to have invented scene-painting, and to have painted a scene (''scenam fecit'') for a tragedy which [[Aeschylus]] exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vitruvius]], ''Praef. ad lib.'' vii&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence some writers, such as [[Karl Woermann]], have supposed that he introduced perspective and illusion into painting.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Agatharchus|volume=1|page=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as this appears to contradict [[Aristotle]]'s assertion that scene-painting was introduced by Sophocles,&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' 4. § i 6&lt;/ref&gt; some scholars understand Vitruvius to mean merely that Agatharchus constructed a stage.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Horace]], ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Epistula ad Pisones]]'' 279: ''et modicis instravit pulpita tignis''&lt;/ref&gt;  But the context shows clearly that [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] painting must be meant, for Vitruvius goes on to say that [[Democritus]] and [[Anaxagoras]], carrying out the principles laid down in a treatise written by Agatharchus,&lt;ref name="OCD"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Arafat  | first = Karim W.  | contribution = Agatharchus  | editor-last = Hornblower  | editor-first = Simon  | title = [[Oxford Classical Dictionary]]  | volume = 1  | pages = 36  | place = Oxford  | year = 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote on the same subject, showing how, in drawing, the lines ought to be made to correspond, according to a natural proportion, to the figure which would be traced out on an imaginary intervening plane by a pencil of rays proceeding from the eye, as a fixed point of sight, to the several points of the object viewed.

It was probably not till towards the end of Aeschylus's career that scene-painting was introduced, and not till the time of Sophocles that it was generally made use of; which may account for what Aristotle says.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Mason  | first = Charles Peter| contribution = Agatharchus (2)  | editor-last = Smith  | editor-first = William  | title = [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]] | volume = 1  | pages = 61–62  | place = Boston  | year = 1867  | contribution-url = http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/0070.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agatharchus was therefore the first painter known to have used graphical perspective on a large scale, although rare occurrences of perspective do appear in vase painting around the middle of the 6th century BC.&lt;ref name="OCD"/&gt;  He is also said to have led the way for later painters, such as [[Apollodorus (painter)|Apollodorus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Mahaffy  | first =John Pentland  | title =Social Life in Greece from Homer to Menander  | publisher =[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan &amp; Co.]]  | year =1902  | location =London  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=WF4bAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=agatharchus  | page =476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agatharchus was a contemporary of [[Alcibiades]] and [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius|Zeuxis]], and was often singled out for the ease and rapidity with which he finished his works.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Pericles'' 13&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Plutarch]] and [[Andocides]] at greater length tell an anecdote of Alcibiades having inveigled Agatharchus to his house and kept him there for more than three months in strict durance, compelling him to paint it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Alcibiades'' 16&lt;/ref&gt;  The speech of Andocides above referred to seems to have been delivered after the destruction of [[Milos|Melos]] (416 BC) and before the expedition to Sicily (415 BC); so that from the above data the age of Agatharchus may be accurately fixed.&lt;ref name="DGRBM"/&gt;

A '''pacemaker''' (or '''artificial pacemaker''', so as not to be confused with the [[cardiac pacemaker|natural pacemaker]] of the [[heart]]) is a medical device that generates electrical impulses delivered by [[electrode]]s to contract the heart muscles and regulate the [[Electrical conduction system of the heart|electrical conduction system of the heart]].

The primary purpose of a pacemaker is to maintain an adequate [[heart rate]], either because the heart's natural pacemaker is not fast enough, or because there is a [[heart block|block]] in the heart's electrical conductive system. Modern pacemakers are externally programmable and allow a [[Cardiology|cardiologist]] to select the optimum pacing modes for individual patients. Some combine a pacemaker and [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator|defibrillator]] in a single implantable device. Others have multiple electrodes stimulating differing positions within the heart to improve [[Synchronization|synchronization]] of the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricles]], the lower chambers of the heart.

Percussive pacing, also known as transthoracic mechanical pacing, is the use of the closed fist, usually on the left lower edge of the [[human sternum|sternum]] over the [[right ventricle]] in the [[venae cavae|''vena cava'']], striking from a distance of 20 – 30&amp;nbsp;cm to induce a ventricular beat (the ''British Journal of Anaesthesia'' suggests this must be done to raise the ventricular pressure to 10–15&amp;nbsp;mmHg to induce electrical activity). This is an old procedure used only as a life saving means until an electrical pacemaker is brought to the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eich C, Bleckmann A, Paul T | title = Percussion pacing in a three-year-old girl with complete heart block during cardiac catheterization | journal = Br J Anaesth | volume = 95 | issue = 4 | pages = 465–7 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16051649 | doi = 10.1093/bja/aei209 | url = http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/95/4/465 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transcutaneous pacing ===

{{Main article|Transcutaneous pacing}}

Transcutaneous pacing (TCP), also called external pacing, is recommended for the initial stabilization of hemodynamically significant [[bradycardia]]s of all types. The procedure is performed by placing two pacing pads on the patient's chest, either in the anterior/lateral position or the anterior/posterior position. The rescuer selects the pacing rate, and gradually increases the pacing current (measured in mA) until electrical capture (characterized by a wide [[QRS complex]] with a tall, broad [[T wave]] on the [[electrocardiogram|ECG]]) is achieved, with a corresponding pulse. Pacing artifact on the ECG and severe muscle twitching may make this determination difficult. External pacing should not be relied upon for an extended period of time. It is an emergency procedure that acts as a bridge until transvenous pacing or other therapies can be applied.

===Epicardial pacing (temporary)===
{{Main article|Epicardial}}
[[File:Pacemaker dependent asystole.jpg|thumb|ECG rhythm strip of a threshold determination in a patient with a temporary (epicardial) ventricular pacemaker. The epicardial pacemaker leads were placed after the patient collapsed during [[aortic valve]] surgery. In the first half of the tracing, pacemaker stimuli at 60 beats per minute result in a wide QRS complex with a [[right bundle branch block]] pattern. Progressively weaker pacing stimuli are administered, which results in [[asystole]] in the second half of the tracing. At the end of the tracing, distortion results from muscle contractions due to a (short) hypoxic [[seizure]]. Because decreased pacemaker stimuli do not result in a ventricular [[escape rhythm]], the patient can be said to be pacemaker-dependent and needs a definitive pacemaker.]]
Temporary epicardial pacing is used during open heart surgery should the surgical procedure create atrio-ventricular block. The electrodes are placed in contact with the outer wall of the ventricle (epicardium) to maintain satisfactory cardiac output until a temporary transvenous electrode has been inserted.

===Transvenous pacing (temporary)===
{{Main article|Transvenous pacing}}
Transvenous pacing, when used for temporary pacing, is an alternative to transcutaneous pacing. A pacemaker wire is placed into a vein, under sterile conditions, and then passed into either the right atrium or right ventricle. The pacing wire is then connected to an external pacemaker outside the body. Transvenous pacing is often used as a bridge to permanent pacemaker placement. It can be kept in place until a permanent pacemaker is implanted or until there is no longer a need for a pacemaker and then it is removed.

[[File:Fluoroscopy pacemaker leads right atrium ventricle.png|thumb|Right atrial and right ventricular leads as visualized under x-ray during a pacemaker implant procedure. The atrial lead is the curved one making a U shape in the upper left part of the figure.]]

=== Subclavicular pacing ===
Permanent pacing with an implantable pacemaker involves transvenous placement of one or more pacing electrodes within a chamber, or chambers, of the heart, while the pacemaker is implanted inside the skin under the clavicle. The procedure is performed by incision of a suitable vein into which the electrode [[Lead (electronics)|lead]] is inserted and passed along the vein, through the valve of the heart, until positioned in the chamber. The procedure is facilitated by [[fluoroscopy]] which enables the physician to view the passage of the electrode lead. After satisfactory lodgement of the electrode is confirmed, the opposite end of the electrode lead is connected to the pacemaker generator.

There are three basic types of permanent pacemakers, classified according to the number of [[Heart chamber|chambers]] involved and their basic operating mechanism:&lt;ref name="url_Heart_Rhythm_Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrspatients.org/patients/treatments/pacemakers.asp |title=Pacemakers, Patient and Public Information Center : Heart Rhythm Society |website= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Single-chamber pacemaker''. In this type, only one pacing lead is placed into a chamber of the heart, either the [[Atrium (heart)|atrium]] or the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]].&lt;ref name="url_Heart_Rhythm_Society"/&gt;
* ''Dual-chamber pacemaker''. Here, wires are placed in two chambers of the heart. One lead paces the atrium and one paces the ventricle. This type more closely resembles the natural pacing of the heart by assisting the heart in coordinating the function between the atria and ventricles.&lt;ref name="url_Heart_Rhythm_Society"/&gt;
*''Biventricular pacemaker''. This pacemaker has three wires placed in three chambers of the heart. One in the atrium and two in either ventricle. It is more complicated to implant.&lt;ref name ="url_Heart_Rhythm_Society"/&gt;
* ''Rate-responsive pacemaker''. This pacemaker has sensors that detect changes in the patient's physical activity and automatically adjust the pacing rate to fulfill the body's metabolic needs.&lt;ref name="url_Heart_Rhythm_Society"/&gt;

The pacemaker generator is a [[hermetically sealed]] device containing a power source, usually a [[lithium battery]], a sensing amplifier which processes the electrical manifestation of naturally occurring heart beats as sensed by the heart electrodes, the [[computer]] logic for the pacemaker and the output circuitry which delivers the pacing impulse to the electrodes.

Most commonly, the generator is placed below the subcutaneous fat of the chest wall, above the muscles and bones of the chest. However, the placement may vary on a case by case basis.

The outer casing of pacemakers is so designed that it will rarely be rejected by the body's [[immune system]]. It is usually made of [[titanium]], which is inert in the body.

=== Intracardial ===
Intracardial pacemakers are placed inside the heart. They are some 10 percent the size of a subclaviculars. Such pacemakers do not require leads to be connected to in the heart muscle from the distant pacemaker device. Intracardials are implanted into the heart using a steerable catheter fed into the [[femoral vein]] via an incision in the inner thigh.{{mcn|date=August 2018}}

== Basic function ==
Modern pacemakers usually have multiple functions. The most basic form monitors the heart's native electrical rhythm. When the pacemaker does not detect a heartbeat within a normal beat-to-beat time period, it will stimulate the ventricle of the heart with a short low voltage pulse. This sensing and stimulating activity continues on a beat by beat basis.

The more complex forms include the ability to sense and/or stimulate both the atrial and ventricular chambers.

From this the basic ventricular "on demand" pacing mode is VVI or with automatic rate adjustment for exercise VVIR – this mode is suitable when no synchronization with the atrial beat is required, as in atrial fibrillation. The equivalent atrial pacing mode is AAI or AAIR which is the mode of choice when atrioventricular conduction is intact but the natural pacemaker the [[sinoatrial node]] is unreliable – sinus node disease (SND) or [[sick sinus syndrome]]. Where the problem is [[atrioventricular block]] (AVB) the pacemaker is required to detect (sense) the atrial beat and after a normal delay (0.1–0.2 seconds) trigger a ventricular beat, unless it has already happened – this is VDD mode and can be achieved with a single pacing lead with electrodes in the right atrium (to sense) and ventricle (to sense and pace). These modes AAIR and VDD are unusual in the US but widely used in Latin America and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Böhm A, Pintér A, Székely A, Préda I | title = Clinical Observations with Long-term Atrial Pacing | journal = Pacing Clin Electrophysiol | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 246–9 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9474681 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-8159.1998.tb01097.x | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119941339/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Crick JC | title = European Multicenter Prospective Follow-Up Study of 1,002 Implants of a Single Lead VDD Pacing System | journal = Pacing Clin Electrophysiol | volume = 14 | issue = 11 | pages = 1742–4 | year = 1991 | pmid = 1749727 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-8159.1991.tb02757.x | url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119992153/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; The DDDR mode is most commonly used as it covers all the options though the pacemakers require separate atrial and ventricular leads and are more complex, requiring careful programming of their functions for optimal results.

== Biventricular pacing ==
&lt;center&gt;
[[File:Cardiac resynchronisation therapy.png|thumb|Three leads can be seen in this example of a cardiac resynchronization device: a right atrial lead (solid black arrow), a right ventricular lead (dashed black arrow), and a coronary sinus lead (red arrow). The coronary sinus lead wraps around the outside of the left ventricle, enabling pacing of the left ventricle. Note that the right ventricular lead in this case has 2 thickened aspects that represent conduction coils and that the generator is larger than typical pacemaker generators, demonstrating that this device is both a pacemaker and a cardioverter-defibrillator, capable of delivering electrical shocks for dangerously fast abnormal ventricular rhythms.]]
&lt;/center&gt;
{{main article|Cardiac resynchronization therapy}}

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is used for people with [[heart failure]] in whom the left and right ventricles do not contract simultaneously ([[ventricular dyssynchrony]]), which occurs in approximately 25–50% of heart failure patients. To achieve CRT, a biventricular pacemaker (BVP) is used, which can pace both the [[Interventricular septum|septal]] and lateral walls of the [[left ventricle]]. By pacing both sides of the left ventricle, the pacemaker can resynchronize the ventricular contractions.

CRT devices have at least two leads, one passing through the ''vena cava'' and the [[right atrium]] into the [[right ventricle]] to stimulate the [[Interventricular septum|septum]], and another passing through the ''vena cava'' and the right atrium and inserted through the [[coronary sinus]] to pace the epicardial wall of the left ventricle. Often, for patients in normal sinus rhythm, there is also a lead in the right atrium to facilitate synchrony with the atrial contraction. Thus, timing between the atrial and ventricular contractions, as well as between the septal and lateral walls of the left ventricle can be adjusted to achieve optimal cardiac function.

CRT devices have been shown to reduce mortality and improve quality of life in patients with heart failure symptoms; a LV ejection fraction less than or equal to 35% and QRS duration on EKG of 120&amp;nbsp;ms or greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cleland JG, Daubert JC, Erdmann E, Freemantle N, Gras D, Kappenberger L, Tavazzi L | title = The effect of cardiac resynchronization on morbidity and mortality in heart failure | journal = N.

Biventricular pacing alone is referred to as CRT-P (for pacing). For selected patients at risk of arrhythmias, CRT can be combined with an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]] (ICD): such devices, known as CRT-D (for defibrillation), also provide effective protection against life-threatening arrhythmias.&lt;ref name=Texas2011&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ganjehei L, Razavi M, Massumi A | title = Cardiac resynchronization therapy: a decade of experience and the dilemma of nonresponders | journal = Texas Heart Institute Journal | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 358–60 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21841860 | pmc = 3147217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advancements in function ==
[[File:X-ray of pacemaker with right atrial and ventricular lead.jpg|thumb|350px|Posteroanterior and lateral [[chest radiograph]]s of a pacemaker with normally located leads in the right atrium (white arrow) and right ventricle (black arrowhead), respectively.]]
A major step forward in pacemaker function has been to attempt to mimic nature by utilizing various inputs to produce a rate-responsive pacemaker using parameters such as the [[QT interval]], pO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – pCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (dissolved [[oxygen]] or [[carbon dioxide]] levels) in the arterial-venous system, physical activity as determined by an [[accelerometer]], [[body temperature]], [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] levels, [[adrenaline]], etc.
Instead of producing a static, predetermined heart rate, or intermittent control, such a pacemaker, a 'Dynamic Pacemaker', could compensate for both actual respiratory loading and potentially anticipated respiratory loading. The first dynamic pacemaker was invented by Anthony Rickards of the [[The Heart Hospital|National Heart Hospital]], London, UK, in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Anthony Francis Rickards | journal = Heart | pmc = 1768450 | year = 2004 | volume = 90 | pages=981–2 | doi = 10.1136/hrt.2004.045674 | issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic pacemaking technology could also be applied to future [[artificial heart]]s. Advances in transitional tissue welding would support this and other artificial organ/joint/tissue replacement efforts. Stem cells may be of interest in transitional tissue welding.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Many advancements have been made to improve the control of the pacemaker once implanted. Many of these have been made possible by the transition to [[microprocessor]] controlled pacemakers. Pacemakers that control not only the ventricles but the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]] as well have become common. Pacemakers that control both the atria and ventricles are called dual-chamber pacemakers. Although these dual-chamber models are usually more expensive, timing the contractions of the atria to precede that of the ventricles improves the pumping efficiency of the heart and can be useful in congestive heart failure.

Rate responsive pacing allows the device to sense the physical activity of the patient and respond appropriately by increasing or decreasing the base pacing rate via rate response algorithms.

The DAVID trials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilkoff BL, Cook JR, Epstein AE, Greene HL, Hallstrom AP, Hsia H, Kutalek SP, Sharma A | title = Dual-chamber pacing or ventricular backup pacing in patients with an implantable defibrillator: the Dual Chamber and VVI Implantable Defibrillator (DAVID) Trial | journal = JAMA | volume = 288 | issue = 24 | pages = 3115–23 | date = December 2002 | pmid = 12495391 | doi = 10.1001/jama.288.24.3115 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/288/24/3115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that unnecessary pacing of the right ventricle can exacerbate [[heart failure]] and increases the incidence of atrial fibrillation. The newer dual chamber devices can keep the amount of right ventricle pacing to a minimum and thus prevent worsening of the heart disease.

==Considerations==

=== Insertion ===
A pacemaker is typically inserted into the patient through a simple surgery using either [[local anesthetic]] or a [[general anesthetic]]. The patient may be given a drug for relaxation before the surgery as well. An antibiotic is typically administered to prevent infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=de Oliveira JC, Martinelli M, Nishioka SA, Varejão T, Uipe D, Pedrosa AA, Costa R, D'Avila A, Danik SB | title = Efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis prior to the implantation of pacemakers and cardioverter-defibrillators: Results of a large, prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial | journal = Circ Arrhythmia Electrophysiol | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–34 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19808441 | doi = 10.1161/CIRCEP.108.795906 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, the pacemaker is inserted in the left shoulder area, where an incision is made below the collar bone, creating a small pocket where the pacemaker is actually housed in the patient's body. The [[Lead (electronics)|lead or leads]] (the number of leads varies depending on the type of pacemaker) are fed into the heart through a large vein using a [[fluoroscope]] to monitor the progress of lead insertion. The right ventricular lead would be positioned away from the apex (tip) of the right ventricle and up on the interventricular septum, below the outflow tract, to prevent deterioration of the strength of the heart. The actual surgery typically lasts 30 to 90 minutes.

Following surgery, the patient should exercise reasonable care with the wound as it heals. There is a follow-up session during which the pacemaker is checked using a "programmer" that can communicate with the device and allows a health care professional to evaluate the system's integrity and determine the settings such as pacing voltage output. The patient should have the strength of his or her heart analyzed frequently with echocardiography, every 1 or 2 years, to make sure that placement of the right ventricular lead has not led to a weakening of the left ventricle.

The patient may want to consider some basic preparation before the surgery. The most basic preparation is that people who have body hair on the chest may want to remove the hair by clipping just prior to surgery or using a [[Chemical depilatory|depilatory]] agent (preoperative shaving has been on the decline since it can cause skin breakage and increase infection risk of any surgical procedure) since the surgery will involve bandages and monitoring equipment to be affixed to the body.

Since a pacemaker uses batteries, the device itself will need replacement as the batteries lose power. Device replacement is usually a simpler procedure than the original insertion since it does not normally require leads to be implanted. The typical replacement requires a surgery in which an incision is made to remove the existing device, the leads are removed from the existing device, the leads are attached to the new device, and the new device is inserted into the patient's body, replacing the previous device.

==== Periodic pacemaker checkups ====
[[File:PaceMakerRemoteMonitoringDevicesTwoKinds.jpg|thumb|Two types of remote monitoring devices used by pacemaker patients]]
Once the pacemaker is implanted, it is periodically checked to ensure the device is operational and performing appropriately. Depending on the frequency set by the following physician, the device can be checked as often as is necessary. Routine pacemaker checks are typically done in-office every six (6) months, though will vary depending upon patient/device status and remote monitoring availability. Newer pacemaker models can also be interrogated remotely, with the patient transmitting their pacemaker data using an at-home transmitter connected to their geographical cellular network. This data can then be accessed by the technician through the device manufacturer's web portal.

At the time of in-office follow-up, the device will be interrogated to perform diagnostic testing. These tests include:
* Sensing: the ability of the device to "see" intrinsic cardiac activity (Atrial and ventricular depolarization).
* Impedance: A test to measure lead integrity. Large and/or sudden increases in impedance can be indicative of a lead fracture while large and/or sudden decreases in impedance can signify a breach in lead insulation.
* Threshold Amplitude: The minimum amount of energy (generally in hundredths of volts) required in order to pace the atrium or ventricle connected to the lead.
* Threshold Duration: The amount of time that the device requires at the preset amplitude to reliably pace the atrium or ventricle connected to the lead.
* Percentage of Pacing: Defines how dependent the patient is on the device, the percentage of time that the pacemaker has been actively pacing since the previous device interrogation.
* Estimated battery life at current rate: As modern pacemakers are "on-demand", meaning that they only pace when necessary, device longevity is affected by how much it is utilized. Other factors affecting device longevity include programmed output and algorithms (features) causing a higher level of current drain from the battery.

An additional aspect of the in-office check is to examine any events that were stored since the last follow-up. These are typically stored based on specific criteria set by the physician and specific to the patient. Some devices have the availability to display intracardiac electrograms of the onset of the event as well as the event itself. This is especially helpful in diagnosing the cause or origin of the event and making any necessary programming changes.

=== Magnetic fields, MRIs, and other lifestyle issues ===
A patient's lifestyle is usually not modified to any great degree after insertion of a pacemaker. There are a few activities that are unwise such as full contact sports and activities that involve intense magnetic fields.

The pacemaker patient may find that some types of everyday actions need to be modified. For instance, the shoulder harness of a vehicle [[seatbelt]] may be uncomfortable if the harness should fall across the pacemaker insertion site.

Any kind of an activity that involves intense magnetic fields should be avoided. This includes activities such as [[arc welding]] possibly, with certain types of equipment,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |vauthors=Marco D, Eisinger G, Hayes DL | title = Testing of work environments for electromagnetic interference| journal = Pacing Clin Electrophysiol | volume = 15 | issue = 11 Pt 2 | pages = 2016–22 | date = November 1992 | pmid = 1279591 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-8159.1992.tb03013.x }}
&lt;/ref&gt; or maintaining heavy equipment that may generate intense magnetic fields (such as a [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) machine).

However, in February 2011 the FDA approved a new pacemaker device from Medtronic called the Revo MRI [[SureScan]]&lt;ref&gt;FDA, [http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/DeviceApprovalsandClearances/Recently-ApprovedDevices/ucm244469.htm "Recently-Approved Devices: Revo MRI SureScan Pacing System"].
2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which was the first to be labeled as [[Magnetic resonance imaging#Implants|conditional]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131011031738/http://magneticresonancesafetytesting.com/genpg.asp?pgname=Terminology magneticresonancesafetytesting.com]&lt;/ref&gt; for MRI use.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Husten.

Forbes, 2013-02-13.
&lt;/ref&gt; There are several limitations to its use including certain patients' qualifications and scan settings.  Most major cardiac device manufacturers now have FDA-approved MR-conditional pacemakers.

A 2008 U.S. study has found&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; that the magnets in some headphones included with portable music players, when placed within an inch of pacemakers, may cause interference.

Some medical procedures may require the use of [[antibiotic]]s to be administered before the procedure. The patient should inform all medical personnel that he or she has a pacemaker. Some standard medical procedures such as the use of MRI may be ruled out by the patient having a pacemaker.

In addition, according to the American Heart Association, some home devices have a remote potential to cause interference by occasionally inhibiting a single beat. Cellphones available in the United States (less than 3 watts) do not seem to damage pulse generators or affect how the pacemaker works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a pacemaker?|url=http://hrmreview.net/what-is-pacemaker/|publisher=HRMReview|accessdate=22 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522160829/http://hrmreview.net/what-is-pacemaker/|archivedate=22 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turning off the pacemaker ===
A panel of The [[Heart Rhythm Society]], a specialist organization based in Washington, DC found that it was legal and ethical to honor requests by patients, or by those with legal authority to make decisions for patients, to deactivate implanted cardiac devices. Lawyers say that the legal situation is similar to removing a feeding tube, though there is currently no legal precedent involving pacemakers in the United States of America. A patient in the United States is thought to have a right to refuse or discontinue treatment, including a pacemaker that keeps him or her alive. Physicians have a right to refuse to turn it off, but are advised by the HRS panel that they should refer the patient to a physician who will.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2010/05/31/prsa0531.htm Heart devices can be turned off near end of life;] Physicians can deactivate implanted defibrillators and pacemakers when terminally ill patients request it, according to new guidelines from the Heart Rhythm Society. Kevin B. O'Reilly, amednews, May 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some patients believe that hopeless, debilitating conditions, like those brought on by severe strokes or late-stage dementia, can cause so much suffering that they would prefer not to prolong their lives with supportive measures, such as cardiac devices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/20/magazine/20pacemaker-t.html What Broke My Father’s Heart] By KATY BUTLER, New York Times, June 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Privacy and security ===
Security and privacy concerns have been raised with pacemakers that allow wireless communication. Unauthorized third parties may be able to read patient records contained in the pacemaker, or reprogram the devices, as has been demonstrated by a team of researchers.&lt;ref name="ICD-Radio"&gt;{{cite conference | date = May 2008 | first = Daniel |  last = Halperin | author2 = Thomas S.

Complications from having [[surgery]] to implant a [[Pacemaker failure|pacemaker]] are uncommon, but could include: Infection where the pacemaker was implanted. [[Allergy|Allergic reaction]] to the dye or [[anesthesia]] used during the procedure.

A possible complication of dual-chamber artificial pacemakers is 'pacemaker-mediated tachycardia' (PMT), a form of reentrant tachycardia. In PMT, the artificial pacemaker forms the anterograde (atrium to ventricle) limb of the circuit and the atrioventricular (AV) node forms the retrograde limb (ventricle to atrium) of the circuit.&lt;ref name=Olshansky&gt;[http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/159645-overview eMedicine &gt; Pacemaker-Mediated Tachycardia] Author: Brian Olshansky, MD. Coauthor(s): Chirag M Sandesara, MD; Noel G Boyle, MB, BCh, MD, PhD. Updated: Jun 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of PMT typically involves reprogramming the pacemaker.&lt;ref name=Olshansky/&gt;

Another possible complication is "pacemaker-tracked tachycardia," where a [[supraventricular tachycardia]] is tracked by the pacemaker and produces beats from a ventricular lead. This is becoming exceedingly rare as newer devices are often programmed to recognize supraventricular tachycardias and switch to non-tracking modes.

Sometimes the leads, which are small diameter wires, from the pacemaker to the implantation site in the heart muscle will need to be removed. The most common reason for lead removal is infection, however over time leads can degrade due to a number of reasons such as lead flexing.&lt;ref name=Wilkoff&gt;[https://www.hrsonline.org/content/download/1401/19549/file/2009-HRS_LeadExtraction.pdf Transvenous Lead Extraction: Heart Rhythm Society Expert Consensus on Facilities, Training, Indications, and Patient Management] Author: Bruce L.

Wazni, MD&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to programming of the pacemaker may overcome lead degradation to some extent. However a patient who has several pacemaker replacements over a decade or two in which the leads were reused may require a lead replacement surgery.

Lead replacement may be done in one of two ways. Insert a new set of leads without removing the current leads (not recommended as it provides additional obstruction to blood flow and heart valve function) or remove the current leads and then insert replacements. The lead removal technique will vary depending on the surgeon's estimation of the probability that simple traction will suffice to more complex procedures. Leads can normally be disconnected from the pacemaker easily which is why device replacement usually entails simple surgery to access the device and replace it by simply unhooking the leads from the device to replace and hooking the leads to the new device. The possible complications, such as perforation of the heart wall, come from removing the lead{s} from the patient's body.

The other end of a pacemaker lead is actually implanted into the heart muscle. In addition leads that have been implanted for a decade or two will usually have attachments to the patient's body at various places in the pathway from device to heart muscle since the human body tends to incorporate foreign devices into tissue. In some cases such as a device that has been inserted for a short amount of time, removal may involve simple traction to pull the lead from the body. Removal in other cases is typically done with a cutting device which threads over the lead and is moved down the lead to remove any organic attachments with tiny cutting lasers or similar device.

Pacemaker lead malposition in various locations has been described in the literature. Depending on the location of the pacer lead and symptoms treatment varies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An unusual cause of transient ischemic attack in a patient with pacemaker|journal = Case Reports in Cardiology|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 2090-6404|pmc = 4008350|pmid = 24826308|pages = 1–3|volume = 2014|doi = 10.1155/2014/265759|first = Jagadeesh Kumar|last = Kalavakunta|first2 = Vishal|last2 = Gupta|first3 = Basil|last3 = Paulus|first4 = William|last4 = Lapenna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible complication called [[twiddler's syndrome]] occurs when a patient manipulates the pacemaker and causes the leads to be removed from their intended location and causes possible stimulation of other nerves.

== Other devices ==
Sometimes devices resembling pacemakers, called [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]]s (ICDs) are implanted. These devices are often used in the treatment of patients at risk from sudden cardiac death. An ICD has the ability to treat many types of heart rhythm disturbances by means of pacing, [[cardioversion]], or [[defibrillation]]. Some ICD devices can distinguish between ventricular fibrillation and [[ventricular tachycardia]] (VT), and may try to pace the heart faster than its intrinsic rate in the case of VT, to try to break the tachycardia before it progresses to ventricular fibrillation. This is known as ''fast-pacing'', ''overdrive pacing'', or ''anti-tachycardia pacing'' (ATP). ATP is only effective if the underlying rhythm is ventricular tachycardia, and is never effective if the rhythm is ventricular fibrillation.

== History ==
[[File:Arne Larsson.jpg|thumb|In 1958, [[Arne Larsson]] (1915–2001) became the first to receive an implantable pacemaker. He had 26 devices during his life and campaigned for other patients needing pacemakers.]]

=== Origin ===
In 1889, [[John Alexander MacWilliam]] reported in the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' (BMJ) of his experiments in which application of an electrical impulse to the human heart in [[asystole]] caused a [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricular]] contraction and that a heart rhythm of 60–70 beats per minute could be evoked by impulses applied at spacings equal to 60–70/minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McWilliam JA |year=1899 |title=Electrical stimulation of the heart in man |journal=Br Med J |volume=1 |issue= 1468|pages=348–50 |url=|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.1468.348 |pmc=2154721 |pmid=20752595}}. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2154721/ "Electrical Stimulation of the Heart in Man – 1899"], Accessed Jan 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, [[Dr Mark Cowley Lidwill|Mark C Lidwill]] of the [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]] of Sydney, supported by physicist Edgar H. Booth of the [[University of Sydney]], devised a portable apparatus which "plugged into a lighting point" and in which "One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution" while the other pole "consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber". "The pacemaker rate was variable from about 80 to 120 pulses per minute, and likewise the voltage variable from 1.5 to 120 volts". In 1928, the apparatus was used to revive a [[Stillbirth|stillborn]] infant at [[Crown Street Women's Hospital|Crown Street Women's Hospital, Sydney]] whose heart continued "to beat on its own accord", "at the end of 10 minutes" of stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Lidwell M C, "Cardiac Disease in Relation to Anaesthesia" in ''Transactions of the Third Session'', Australasian Medical Congress, Sydney, Australia, Sept. 2–7, 1929, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mond_1982"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mond HG, Sloman JG, Edwards RH | title = The first pacemaker | journal = Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 278–82 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6176970 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-8159.1982.tb02226.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1932, American physiologist [[Albert Hyman]], with the help of his brother, described an electro-mechanical instrument of his own, powered by a spring-wound hand-cranked motor. Hyman himself referred to his invention as an "artificial pacemaker", the term continuing in use to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Aquilina O | year = 2006 | title = A brief history of cardiac pacing | url = http://hrmreview.net/brief-history-cardiac-pacing/ | journal = Images Paediatr Cardiol | volume = 27 | issue =  | pages = 17–81 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140522161030/http://hrmreview.net/brief-history-cardiac-pacing/ | archivedate = 2014-05-22 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Furman S, Szarka G, Layvand D | title = Reconstruction of Hyman's second pacemaker | journal = Pacing Clin Electrophysiol | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 446–53 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15869680 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-8159.2005.09542.x | url = http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0147-8389&amp;date=2005&amp;volume=28&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=446 | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120720053106/http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/openurl?genre=article&amp;sid=nlm:pubmed&amp;issn=0147-8389&amp;date=2005&amp;volume=28&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=446 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2012-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An apparent [[Wikt:hiatus|hiatus]] in publication of research conducted between the early 1930s and [[World War II]] may be attributed to the public perception of interfering with nature by "reviving the dead". For example, "Hyman did not publish data on the use of his pacemaker in humans because of adverse publicity, both among his fellow physicians, and due to newspaper reporting at the time. Lidwell may have been aware of this and did not proceed with his experiments in humans".&lt;ref name="Mond_1982"/&gt;

=== Transcutaneous ===
In 1950, Canadian electrical engineer [[John Alexander Hopps|John Hopps]] designed and built the first external pacemaker based upon observations by cardio-thoracic surgeons [[Wilfred Gordon Bigelow]] and [[John Callaghan]] at [[Toronto General Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/pam_archives/index.php?fuseaction=genitem.displayItem&amp;lang=eng&amp;rec_nbr=104318&amp;rec_nbr_list=104318,3588818,815761,4385271,4385234,4385226,4385302,4385311,4385420,4385246|title=John Alexander Hopps fonds|last=|first=|date=|website=Archival description|publisher=[[Library and Archives Canada]]|access-date=16 Sep 2016}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; although the device was first tested at the [[University of Toronto]]'s Banting Institute on a dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.ca/history/milestones/pacemaker.html|title=IEEE Milestone in Electrical Engineering and Computing|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A substantial external device using [[vacuum tube]] technology to provide [[transcutaneous pacing]], it was somewhat crude and painful to the patient in use and, being powered from an AC wall socket, carried a potential hazard of [[electric shock|electrocution]] of the patient and inducing [[ventricular fibrillation]].

A number of innovators, including [[Paul Zoll]], made smaller but still bulky transcutaneous pacing devices in the following years using a large rechargeable battery as the power supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2001/04.19/12-zoll.html|title=Harvard Gazette: Paul Maurice Zoll|author=Harvard News Office|work=harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, William L. Weirich published the results of research performed at the [[University of Minnesota]]. These studies demonstrated the restoration of heart rate, cardiac output and mean aortic pressures in animal subjects with complete [[heart block]] through the use of a [[myocardial]] electrode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weirich WL, Gott VL, Lillehei CW | title = The treatment of complete heart block by the combined use of a myocardial electrode and an artificial pacemaker | journal = Surg Forum | volume = 8 | issue =  | pages = 360–3 | year = 1957 | pmid = 13529629 | doi =  | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 Colombian doctor Alberto Vejarano Laverde and Colombian electrical engineer [[Jorge Reynolds Pombo]] constructed an external pacemaker, similar to those of Hopps and Zoll, weighing 45&amp;nbsp;kg and powered by a 12 volt car [[lead–acid battery]], but connected to electrodes attached to the heart. This apparatus was successfully used to sustain a 70-year-old priest, Gerardo Florez.

The development of the [[silicon]] [[transistor]] and its first commercial availability in 1956 was the pivotal event which led to rapid development of practical cardiac pacemaking.

=== Wearable ===
In 1958, engineer [[Earl Bakken]] of Minneapolis, Minnesota, produced the first wearable external pacemaker for a patient of [[C. Walton Lillehei]]. This transistorized pacemaker, housed in a small plastic box, had controls to permit adjustment of pacing heart rate and output voltage and was connected to electrode [[Lead (electronics)|leads]] which passed through the skin of the patient to terminate in electrodes attached to the surface of the [[myocardium]] of the heart.

One of the earliest patients to receive this Lucas pacemaker device was a woman in her early 30s in an operation carried out in 1964 at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]] in [[Oxford]] by cardiac surgeon Alf Gunning from South Africa and later Professor Gunning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk/biogs/E001783b.htm |title=Gunning, Alfred James – Biographical entry – Plarr's Lives of the Fellows Online |publisher=Livesonline.rcseng.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nds.ox.ac.uk/about-us/our-history |title=Our history — NDS |publisher=Nds.ox.ac.uk |accessdate=2013-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was a student of [[Christiaan Barnard]]. This pioneering operation was carried out under the guidance of cardiac consultant [[Peter Sleight]] at the Radcliffe Infirmary in Oxford and his cardiac research team at St George's Hospital in London. Sleight later became Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcs.com/pages/Cardiac_Pacemakers.asp |title=British Cardiovascular Society |publisher=Bcs.com |accessdate=2013-12-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212164351/http://www.bcs.com/pages/Cardiac_Pacemakers.asp |archivedate=2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://heart.bmj.com/content/33/6/938.full.pdf | pmid = 5120241 | volume=33 | issue = 6 | title=Treatment of chronic heart block with the Lucas induction coil pacemaker. | date=Nov 1971 | journal=Br Heart J | pages=938–42 | doi=10.1136/hrt.33.6.938 | pmc=458452 | author=Record CO, Sleight P, Gunning AJ, Kenworthy-Browne JM, Richings M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implantable ===
[[File:PPM.png|thumb|350px|Illustration of implanted cardiac pacemaker showing locations of cardiac pacemaker leads]]
The first clinical implantation into a human of a fully implantable pacemaker was in 1958 at the [[Karolinska Institute]] in Solna, [[Sweden]], using a pacemaker designed by [[Rune Elmqvist]] and surgeon [[Åke Senning]], connected to electrodes attached to the [[myocardium]] of the heart by [[thoracotomy]]. The device failed after three hours. A second device was then implanted which lasted for two days. The world's first implantable pacemaker patient, Arne Larsson, went on to receive 26 different pacemakers during his lifetime. He died in 2001, at the age of 86, outliving the inventor as well as the surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Altman| first=Lawrence| title=Arne H. W.

In 1959, temporary [[transvenous pacing]] was first demonstrated by Seymore Furman and John Schwedel, whereby the [[catheter]] electrode was inserted via the patient's [[basilic vein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Furman S, Schwedel JB | title = An intracardiac pacemaker for Stokes-Adams seizures | journal = N. Engl. J. Med. | volume = 261 | issue = 5 | pages = 943–8 | year = 1959 | pmid = 13825713 | doi=10.1056/NEJM195911052611904}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1960, an improved version of the Swedish Elmqvist design was implanted in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] in the Casmu 1 Hospital by Doctors [[Orestes Fiandra]] and Roberto Rubio. That device lasted until the patient died of other ailments, nine months later. The early Swedish-designed devices used rechargeable batteries, which were charged by an induction coil from the outside. It was the first pacemaker implanted in America.

Implantable pacemakers constructed by engineer [[Wilson Greatbatch]] entered use in humans from April 1960 following extensive [[animal testing]]. The Greatbatch innovation varied from the earlier Swedish devices in using primary cells ([[mercury battery]]) as the energy source. The first patient lived for a further 18 months.

The first use of [[transvenous pacing]] in conjunction with an implanted pacemaker was by Parsonnet in the United States,&lt;ref name="pmid83641"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parsonnet V | title = Permanent transvenous pacing in 1962 | journal = Pacing Clin Electrophysiol | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 265–8 | year = 1978 | pmid = 83641 | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-8159.1978.tb03472.x| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Preliminary Investigation of the Development of a Permanent Implantable Pacemaker Using an Intracardiac Dipolar Electrode |vauthors=Parsonnet V, Zucker IR, Asa MM | journal = Clin.

The transvenous, or pervenous, procedure involved incision of a vein into which was inserted the [[catheter]] electrode lead under [[Fluoroscopy|fluoroscopic]] guidance, until it was lodged within the [[trabeculae]] of the right ventricle. This method was to become the method of choice by the mid-1960s.

Cardiothoracic Surgeon [[Leon Abrams]], and Medical Engineer [[Ray Lightwood]], developed and implanted the first patient controlled variable rate heart pacemaker in 1960 at [[Birmingham University]]. The first implant took place in March 1960, with two further implants the following month. These three patients made good recoveries and returned to a high quality of life. By 1966, 56 patients had undergone implantation with one surviving for over {{frac|5|1|2}} years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/documents/culture/bookletfinalpdf.pdf Blue Plaque Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bhamalumni.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=1111&amp;frcrld=1|title=University of Birmingham|work=bhamalumni.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lithium battery ===
[[File:CPI Pacemaker.jpg|thumb|The first lithium-iodide cell powered pacemaker. Cardiac Pacemakers Inc. 1972&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{patent|US|3822707|title=Metal-enclosed cardiac pacer with solid-state power source}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The preceding implantable devices all suffered from the unreliability and short lifetime of the available primary cell technology which was mainly that of the [[mercury battery]]. In the late 1960s, several companies, including ARCO in the USA, developed [[Atomic battery|isotope-powered]] pacemakers, but this development was overtaken by the development in 1971 of the [[lithium iodide]] cell by [[Wilson Greatbatch]]. Lithium-iodide or lithium anode cells became the standard for future pacemaker designs.

A further impediment to reliability of the early devices was the diffusion of water vapour from the body fluids through the [[epoxy]] resin encapsulation affecting the electronic circuitry. This phenomenon was overcome by encasing the pacemaker generator in a hermetically sealed metal case, initially by [[Telectronics]] of Australia in 1969 followed by Cardiac Pacemakers Inc of Minneapolis in 1972. This technology, using [[Titanium#Medical|titanium]] as the encasing metal, became the standard by the mid-1970s.

On July 9, 1974, Manuel A. Villafaña and [[Anthony Adducci]] founders of [[Cardiac Pacemakers, Inc.]] ([[Guidant]]) in St. Paul, Minnesota, manufactured the world's first pacemaker with a lithium anode and a lithium-iodide electrolyte solid-state battery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneers of the Medical Device Industry| url=http://www.mnhs.org/collections/medTech/org_cardiac_pacemakers.php| publisher=Minnesota Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|US3822707||title=Metal-enclosed cardiac pacer with solid-state power source}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intra-cardial ===
In 2013, multiple firms announced devices that could be inserted via a leg catheter rather than invasive surgery. The devices are roughly the size and shape of a pill, much smaller than the size of a traditional pacemaker. Once implanted, the device's prongs contact the muscle and stabilize heartbeats. Engineers and scientists are currently working on this type of device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://singularityhub.com/2013/12/27/medtronics-minimally-invasive-pacemaker-the-size-of-a-multivitamin/ |title=Medtronic's Minimally Invasive Pacemaker the Size of a Multivitamin |publisher=Singularity Hub |accessdate=2013-12-29|date=2013-12-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2014 a patient, Bill Pike of Fairbanks, Alaska, received a Medtronic Micra pacemaker in Providence St Vincent Hospital in Portland Oregon. D. Randolph Jones was the EP doctor. In 2014 also St. Jude Medical Inc. announced the first enrollments in the company’s leadless Pacemaker Observational Study evaluating the Nanostim leadless pacing technology. The Nanostim pacemaker received CE marking in 2013. The post-approval implants have occurred in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dicardiology.com/article/european-post-approval-trial-nanostim-leadless-pacemaker-begins/ |title=European Post-Approval Trial for Nanostim |publisher=DAIC |date=2014-03-18 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The European study was recently stopped, after there were reports of six perforations that led to two patient deaths.

=== Reusable Pacemakers ===

Thousands of pacemakers are removed by funeral home personnel each year all over the world. They have to be removed postmortem from bodies which are going to be cremated to avoid explosions. It is a fairly simple procedure which can be carried out by a mortician. Pacemakers with significant battery life are potentially life-saving devices for people in low and middle income countries (LMICs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper| url=https://www.bbc.com/news/health-24828244/ |title=British charity calls for re-use of pacemakers abroad |journal=BBC News |accessdate=2018-07-31|date=2013-11-19 |last1=Mazumdar |first1=Tulip }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Academy of Medicine|Institute of Medicine]], a [[United States]] [[non-governmental organization]], has reported that inadequate access to advanced cardiovascular technologies is one of the major contributors to cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in LMICs. Ever since the 1970s, multiple studies all over the world have reported on the safety and efficacy of pacemaker reuse. {{As of|2016}}, widely acceptable standards for safe pacemaker and ICD reuse have not been developed, and there continue to be legal and regulatory barriers to widespread adoption of medical device reuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crawford |first1=TC |last2=Eagle |first2=KA |title=Reuse of cardiac implantable electronic devices to improve and extend lives: a call to action. |journal=Heart Asia |date=2017 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=34–35 |doi=10.1136/heartasia-2016-010835 |pmid=28191825 |pmc=5278341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blinding''' is a type of [[physical punishment]] which results in complete or nearly complete [[Visual impairment|loss of vision]]. It has been used as an act of [[revenge]] and [[torture]].&lt;ref name=eye&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goes|first1=Frank Joseph|title=The Eye in History|date=2013|publisher=JP Medical Ltd|isbn=9350902745|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; The punishment has been used since [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]]; [[Greek mythology]] makes several references to blinding as divine punishment, which reflects human practice.

In the [[Byzantine Empire]] and many other historical societies, blinding was accomplished by gouging out the eyes, sometimes using a hot poker, and by pouring a boiling substance, such as vinegar, on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lawler|first1=Jennifer|title=Encyclopedia of the Byzantine Empire|date=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=1476609292|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Examples==

===In mythology and religious law===
[[Oedipus]], who gouged out his own eyes after accidentally fulfilling the prophecy that he would end up killing his father and marrying his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Martha L.|title=The Staff of Oedipus: Transforming Disability in Ancient Greece|date=2003|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0472113399|pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hebrew Bible|Bible]], [[Samson]] was blinded upon his capture by the [[Philistines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hartsock|first1=Chad|title=Sight and Blindness in Luke-Acts: The Use of Physical Features in Characterization|date=2008|publisher=Brill|isbn=9004165355|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early Christianity|Early Christians]] were often blinded as a penalty for their beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pearman|first1=Tory Vandeventer|title=Women and Disability in Medieval Literature|date=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=0230117562|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[St. Lucy]]'s torturers tore out her eyes.

Blinding survives as a form of penalty in the modern era, especially as part of the [[sharia]] law. In 2003, a [[Pakistan]]i court sentenced a man to be blinded after he subjected his fiancee to an [[Acid throwing|acid attack]] resulting in loss of vision. The man who blinded [[Ameneh Bahrami]] in an [[acid attack]] was sentenced to blinding by an [[Iran]]ian court in 2009; Bahrami eventually pardoned the attacker.&lt;ref name=eye/&gt;

===In history===
In the Middle Ages, blinding was used as a penalty for treachery or as a means of rendering a political opponent unable to rule and lead an army in war.&lt;ref name=Evans&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Michael|title=The Death of Kings: Royal Deaths in Medieval England|date=2007|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=1852855851|pages=37, 89-90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 11th century, [[William the Conqueror]] used blinding as a punishment for rebellion to replace the [[death penalty]] in his laws for [[Kingdom of England|England]].

Blinding was a punishment for killing a [[Hart (deer)|hart]] or [[hind (deer)|hind]] in a [[royal forest]].

[[Henry I of England]] blinded [[William, Count of Mortain]], who had fought against him at [[Battle of Tinchebray|Tinchebray]] in 1106. He also ordered blinding and [[castration]] as a punishment for thieves.&lt;ref name=Evans/&gt;

In 1014, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Basil II]] had 99 of every 100 captured [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarians]] blinded, leaving 150 one-eyed men to lead them back to their commander.&lt;ref name=eye/&gt;

[[Béla II of Hungary|Bela II of Hungary]] and his father was blinded by [[Coloman, King of Hungary]].

'''Catabolysis''' is a [[biological process]] in which the body breaks down [[fat]] and [[muscle]] tissue in order to stay alive.  Catabolysis occurs only when there is no longer any source of [[protein]], [[carbohydrate]], or [[vitamin]] nourishment feeding all body systems; it is the most severe type of [[malnutrition]].

== Mechanism ==

Due to the [[Basal metabolic rate|normal metabolic rate]] of [[human]]s  catabolysis becomes life-threatening only after 1–2 months from the cessation of nutrition going into the body.  After this time, the damage to muscles and organs can be permanent and can also eventually cause [[death]], if left untreated. Catabolysis is the last metabolic resort for the body to keep itself — particularly the [[nervous system]]—functional.

Protein stores, especially in muscle tissue, provide the amino acids needed for the process. Amino acids are released into the blood and converted in the liver to [[alpha keto acids]]. Alpha keto acids can then be converted to glucose to maintain proper [[blood sugar levels]].

The situation can become dire when one begins to lose [[muscle]] mass; this is a sign that the fat has been expended and the body is now [[Metabolism|metabolizing]] the muscle tissue. This results in [[muscle atrophy]], a loss of strength and, ultimately, a depletion of muscular tissue completely. Muscle weakness is not necessarily a symptom of catabolysis: the muscles will normally feel fatigued when they are not receiving enough energy or [[oxygen]]. Ultimately, catabolysis can progress to the point of no return when the body's machinery for [[protein synthesis]], itself made of protein, has been degraded to the point that it cannot handle any protein. At this point, attempts to correct the disorder by giving food or protein are futile.

The body has a natural store of [[fat]] (also called ''[[adipose tissue]]'') that stores reserve energy.  One can still stay alive while the body breaks down the fatty tissue (hence people [[wasting]] away from starvation).

The person may, during catabolysis, have large amounts of [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s, and [[amino acid]]s in the bloodstream, due to the [[muscle fiber]]s and adipose tissues being broken down and sent to the nervous system and [[Human brain|brain]].  One may also exhibit a [[fever]], since the body is working hard to transfer the nutrients in the muscles and fat to the blood.

== Treatment ==

While catabolysis can be deadly over time, if the person is given medical treatment early enough, the effects of catabolysis can be reversed.  However, the person may require [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] [[Essential nutrient|nutrition]], a [[blood transfusion]], and/or oxygen replenishment.  After that, it may be a few weeks to a few months before the person's muscle mass and fat deposits can build themselves up again; there is a possibility that they may never build back up, depending on the severity of the condition.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6573">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[knot theory]], a '''chiral knot''' is a [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] that is ''not'' [[knot equivalence|equivalent]] to its mirror image. An oriented knot that is equivalent to its mirror image is an '''amphichiral knot''', also called an '''achiral knot''' or '''amphicheiral knot'''. The [[chirality (mathematics)|chirality]] of a knot is a [[knot invariant]]. A knot's chirality can be further classified depending on whether or not it is [[Invertible knot|invertible]].

There are only five knot symmetry types, indicated by chirality and invertibility: fully chiral&lt;!--"chiral noninvertible"--&gt;, reversible&lt;!--"chiral invertible"--&gt;, positively amphichiral noninvertible, negatively amphichiral noninvertible, and fully amphichiral invertible.&lt;ref name="htw"&gt;{{citation

==Background==
The chirality of certain knots was long suspected, and was proven by [[Max Dehn]] in 1914. [[P. G. Tait]] conjectured that all amphichiral knots had even [[Crossing number (knot theory)|crossing number]], but a counterexample was found by [[Morwen Thistlethwaite]] et al.&lt;!-- Mathworld claims it was Hoste et al., probably Thistlethwaite and Hoste and someone else, but I couldn't find anything.--&gt; in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Jablan, Slavik &amp; Sazdanovic, Radmila.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
The simplest chiral knot is the [[trefoil knot]], which was shown to be chiral by [[Max Dehn]]. All [[torus knot]]s are chiral. The [[Alexander polynomial]] cannot detect the chirality of a knot, but the [[Jones polynomial]] can in some cases; if ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''q'') ≠&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''q''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;), then the knot is chiral, however the converse is not true. The [[HOMFLY polynomial]] is even better at detecting chirality, but there is no known polynomial [[knot invariant]] which can fully detect chirality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9401095 "Chirality of Knots 9&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and 10&lt;sub&gt;71&lt;/sub&gt; and Chern-Simons Theory" by P. Ramadevi, T. R. Govindarajan, and R. K. Kaul]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reversible knot===
A chiral knot that is [[invertible knot|invertible]] is classified as a reversible knot.&lt;ref name="Atlas"&gt;{{Knot Atlas|Three Dimensional Invariants}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the trefoil knot.

===Fully chiral knot===
If a knot is not equivalent to its [[invertible knot|inverse]] or its mirror image, it is a fully chiral knot, for example the [[9 32 knot]].&lt;ref name="Atlas" /&gt;

==Amphichiral knot==
[[Image:figure8knot-01.png|thumb|80px|The [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] is the simplest amphichiral knot.]]
An amphichiral knot is one which has an [[orientability|orientation]]-reversing self-[[homeomorphism]] of the [[3-sphere]], α, fixing the knot set-wise.  
All amphichiral [[alternating knot]]s have even [[Crossing number (knot theory)|crossing number]]. The first amphichiral knot with odd crossing number is a 15-crossing knot discovered by [[Jim Hoste|Hoste]] et al.&lt;ref name="Mathworld"/&gt;

=== Fully amphichiral ===
If a knot is [[Ambient_isotopy|isotopic]] to both its reverse and its mirror image, it is fully amphichiral. The simplest knot with this property is the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]].

=== Positive amphichiral ===
If the self-homeomorphism, α, preserves the orientation of the knot, it is said to be positive amphichiral. This is equivalent to the knot being isotopic to its mirror.  No knots with crossing number smaller than twelve are positive amphichiral.&lt;ref name="Atlas" /&gt;

=== Negative amphichiral ===
[[Image:8 17 Knot.svg|thumb|80px|The first negative amphichiral knot.]]
If the self-homeomorphism, α, reverses the orientation of the knot, it is said to be negative amphichiral.  This is equivalent to the knot being isotopic to the reverse of its mirror image. The knot with this property that has the fewest crossings is the knot [[:Image:8 17 Knot.svg|8&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name="Atlas" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7458">[[File:2 parallel footprints.png|thumb|Individual left and right footprints are chiral '''enantiomorphs''' in a plane because they are mirror images while containing no mirror symmetry individually.]]
In [[geometry]], a figure is '''chiral''' (and said to have '''chirality''') if it is not identical to its [[mirror image]], or, more precisely, if it cannot be mapped to its mirror image by [[Rotation (mathematics)|rotation]]s and [[Translation (geometry)|translation]]s alone. An object that is not chiral is said to be achiral. In 3 dimensions, not all achiral objects have a mirror plane. For example, a 3-dimensional object with [[inversion centre]] as its only nontrivial [[symmetry operation]] is achiral but has no mirror plane.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

A chiral object and its mirror image are said to be '''enantiomorphs'''. The word ''chirality'' is derived from the Greek {{lang|grc|χείρ}} (cheir), the hand, the most familiar chiral object; the word ''enantiomorph'' stems from the Greek {{lang|grc|ἐναντίος}} (enantios) 'opposite' + {{lang|grc|μορφή}} (morphe) 'form'.  A non-chiral figure is called '''achiral''' or '''amphichiral'''.

== Examples==
[[File:3D Cartesian Coodinate Handedness.jpg|thumb|left|Left and [[right-hand rule]]s in three dimensions]]
{| class=wikitable align=right
|+ The [[tetromino]]s S and Z are enantiomorphs in 2-dimensions
![[File:Tetromino S.svg|100px]]&lt;BR&gt;S
![[File:Tetromino Z.svg|94px]]&lt;BR&gt;Z
|}
Some chiral three-dimensional objects, such as the [[helix]], can be assigned a right or left [[handedness]], according to the [[right-hand rule]].

Many other familiar objects exhibit the same chiral symmetry of the human body, such as gloves and shoes. Right shoes differ from left shoes only by being mirror images of each other. In contrast thin gloves may not be considered chiral if you can wear them [[wiktionary:inside out|inside-out]].{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The J, L, S and Z-shaped ''[[tetromino]]es'' of the popular video game [[Tetris]] also exhibit chirality, but only in a two-dimensional space. Individually they contain no mirror symmetry in the plane.

==Chirality and symmetry group==
A figure is achiral&lt;!--sic!--&gt; if and only if its [[symmetry group]] contains at least one ''orientation-reversing'' isometry. (In Euclidean geometry any [[isometry]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;v\mapsto Av+b&lt;/math&gt; with an [[orthogonal matrix]] &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and a vector &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;. The [[determinant]] of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is either 1 or &amp;minus;1 then. If it is &amp;minus;1 the isometry is ''[[orientation (mathematics)|orientation]]-reversing'', otherwise it is orientation-preserving.)

See &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Petitjean, M. | title = Chirality in metric spaces. In memoriam Michel Deza | journal = Optimization Letters | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1007/s11590-017-1189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a full mathematical definition of chirality.

==Chirality in three dimensions==
[[File:Chiralität von Würfeln V.1.svg|thumb|Pair of chiral [[dice]] (enantiomorphs)]]
In three dimensions, every figure that possesses a [[mirror plane of symmetry]] ''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', an inversion center of symmetry ''S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', or a higher [[improper rotation]] (rotoreflection) ''S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis of symmetry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2. Symmetry operations and symmetry elements|url=http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu/Theoretical_Chemistry/Symmetry/Symmetry_operations_and_symmetry_elements|website=chemwiki.ucdavis.edu|accessdate=25 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is achiral. (A ''plane of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a plane &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(x,y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-plane of the coordinate system. A ''center of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a point &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-x,-y,-z)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the origin of the coordinate system.) Note, however, that there are achiral figures lacking both plane and center of symmetry. An example is the figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_0=\left\{(1,0,0),(0,1,0),(-1,0,0),(0,-1,0),(2,1,1),(-1,2,-1),(-2,-1,1),(1,-2,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

which is invariant under the orientation reversing isometry &lt;math&gt;(x,y,z)\mapsto(-y,x,-z)&lt;/math&gt; and thus achiral, but it has neither plane nor center of symmetry. The figure

:&lt;math&gt;F_1=\left\{(1,0,0),(-1,0,0),(0,2,0),(0,-2,0),(1,1,1),(-1,-1,-1)\right\}&lt;/math&gt;

also is achiral as the origin is a center of symmetry, but it lacks a plane of symmetry.

Note also that achiral figures can have a [[Point groups in three dimensions#Center of symmetry|center axis]].

==Chirality in two dimensions==
[[File:Bracelets33.svg|thumb|300px|The colored [[Necklace (combinatorics)|necklace]] in the middle is '''chiral''' in 2-dimensions, the two others are '''achiral'''.&lt;br&gt;This means that as physical necklaces on a table the left and right one could be rotated into their mirror image while remaining on the table. The one in the middle, however, would have to be picked up and turned in three dimensions.]]
In two dimensions, every figure which possesses an [[axis of symmetry]] is achiral, and it can be shown that every ''bounded'' achiral figure must have an axis of symmetry. (An ''axis of symmetry'' of a figure &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a line &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is invariant under the mapping &lt;math&gt;(x,y)\mapsto(x,-y)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to be the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis of the coordinate system.) For that reason, a [[triangle]] is achiral if it is [[equilateral triangle|equilateral]] or [[isosceles triangle|isosceles]], and is chiral if it is scalene.

Consider the following pattern:
:[[File:Krok 6.png|320px]]

This figure is chiral, as it is not identical to its mirror image:
:[[File:Krok 6 mirrored.png|320px]]

But if one prolongs the pattern in both directions to infinity, one receives an (unbounded) achiral figure which has no axis of symmetry. Its symmetry group is a [[frieze group]] generated by a single [[glide reflection]].

==Knot theory==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Figure-eight knot (mathematics)]] --&gt;

A [[knot (mathematics)|knot]] is called [[amphichiral knot|achiral]] if it can be continuously deformed into its mirror image, otherwise it is called a [[chiral knot]]. For example, the [[unknot]] and the [[figure-eight knot (mathematics)|figure-eight knot]] are achiral, whereas the [[trefoil knot]] is chiral.

'''Cho Bong-am''' (조봉암; 曺奉岩, 25 September 1898 – 31 July 1959) was a Korean independence activist and politician, who ran for president in the [[South Korean presidential election, 1956|South Korean presidential election]] in 1956. He was a founding member of the [[Communist Party of Korea]] (조선공산당; 朝鮮共産黨) and the [[Progressive Party (South Korea)|Progressive Party]] (진보당; 進步黨), a moderate socialist democratic party in South Korea which was one of the country's major political forces.&lt;ref name="failure"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Yunjong|title=The Failure of Socialism in South Korea: 1945 - 2007|date=2016|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|page=54,84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cho Bong-am studied in Japan and the Soviet Union. In the 1920s, he was active in the Korean Communist Party. After [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] though, Cho defected from the Communist Party in 1946, criticising it for its subservience to the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt; name="sungjoo"{{cite book|last1=Han|first1=Sungjoo|title=The Failure of Democracy in South Korea|date=1974|publisher=University of California Press|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] in 1947, Cho became the Minister of Agriculture under [[Syngman Rhee]]'s presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Park|first1=Sub|title=Cooperation between business associations and the government in the Korean cotton industry, 1950–70|journal=Business History|date=November 2009|volume=51|issue=6|page=850|doi=10.1080/00076790903266851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Cho ran for the presidency for the first time against sitting president Rhee, and [[Yi Si-yeong]]. He received only 0.8 million votes out of 5.2 million.

The Progressive Party was founded in the aftermath of the [[Korean War]] under Cho's leadership. Cho and his followers were able to build a wide coalition with the country's leftist forces. Cho also successfully created coalitions right-wing forces opposed to [[Syngman Rhee]]'s dictatorship. The party's founding and moderate success in Korea's hostile political environment is considered a large result of Bong-am's personal charisma. The Progressive Party advocated peaceful unification with [[North Korea]], through strengthening the country's democratic forces and winning in a unified Korean election. Cho called for both anti-communist and anti-authoritarian politics, as well as advocating for social welfare policies for the peasants and urban poor.

In the 1956 election, Cho ran against Rhee, the anti-communist [[strongman (politics)|strongman]] president. Cho lost with 30% of the vote, which exceeded expectations. Following the election, the Progressive Party broke apart due to factionalism. 

Three years after the election, Cho was charged with espionage and receiving funds from North Korea. His first trial resulted in an acquittal but he was convicted in a second trial and was executed on 31 July 1959.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2011/01/116_79367.html&lt;/ref&gt;  His death sentence was posthumously overturned in 2011 by the South Korean Supreme Court. &lt;ref&gt;http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2931306&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chögyam Trungpa''' ([[Wylie transliteration|Wylie]]: ''Chos rgyam Drung pa''; March 5, 1939 – April 4, 1987) was a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[meditation]] master and holder of both the [[Kagyu]] and [[Nyingma]] lineages, the eleventh [[Trungpa tülkus|Trungpa tülku]], a [[tertön]], supreme [[abbot]] of the [[Surmang|Surmang monasteries]], scholar, teacher, poet, artist, and originator of a radical re-presentation of [[Shambhala]] vision.

Recognized both by Tibetan Buddhists and by other spiritual practitioners and scholars&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luminous passage: the practice and study of Buddhism in America By Charles S. Prebish; p44&lt;/ref&gt; as a preeminent teacher of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], he was a major figure in the dissemination of Buddhism to the West,&lt;ref&gt;"Exceptional as one of the first Tibetan lamas to become fully assimilated into Western culture, he made a powerful contribution in revealing the Tibetan approach to inner peace in the West." The Dalai Lama, "A message from his Holiness, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama" in ''Recalling Chogyam Trungpa'' Ed. Fabrice Midal; pp ix–x&lt;/ref&gt; founding [[Vajradhatu]] and [[Naropa University]] and establishing the [[Shambhala Training]] method.

Among his contributions are the translation of numerous Tibetan texts,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf Chögyam The Translator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829123015/http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf |date=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of the [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana teachings]] to the West, and a presentation of the Buddhadharma largely devoid of ethnic trappings. Trungpa coined the term [[crazy wisdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Divalerio|first1=David|title=The Holy Madmen of Tibet|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his teaching methods and actions were the topic of controversy during his lifetime and afterwards.

==Biography==

===Early years===
[[File:Khenpo gangshar2.jpg|thumb|[[Khenpo Gangshar]] (left) and Chögyam Trungpa|381x381px]]
Born in the [[Nangchen]] region of [[Tibet]] in March 1939, Chögyam Trungpa was eleventh in the line of [[Trungpa tülkus]], important figures in the [[Kagyu]] lineage, one of the four main schools of [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. Among his three main teachers were [[Jamgon Kongtrul]] of Sechen, HH [[Dilgo Khyentse|Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], and [[Khenpo Gangshar]].

The name ''Chögyam'' is a contraction of ''Chökyi Gyamtso'' ({{bo-tw|t=ཆོས་ཀྱི་རྒྱ་མཚོ་|w=Chos-kyi Rgya-mtsho}}), which means "ocean of [[dharma]]". ''Trungpa'' ({{bo-tw|t=དྲུང་པ་|w=Drung-pa}}) means "attendant". He was deeply trained in the Kagyu tradition and received his [[khenpo]] degree at the same time as [[Thrangu Rinpoche]]; they continued to be very close in later years. Chögyam Trungpa was also trained in the [[Nyingma]] tradition, the oldest of the four schools, and was an adherent of the [[Rime movement|''ri-mé'']] ("nonsectarian") ecumenical movement within Tibetan Buddhism, which aspired to bring together and make available all the valuable teachings of the different schools, free of sectarian rivalry.

At the time of his escape from Tibet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Lion's Jaws - Chögyam Trungpa's Epic Escape To The West|publisher=Mountain|year=2016|isbn=978-0-9950293-0-9|edition=1|last1=MacLean|first1=Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa was head of the Surmang group of monasteries.

=== Escape from Tibet ===
On April 23, 1959, twenty-year-old Trungpa set out on an epic nine-month escape from his homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, Chögyam (1966). ''Born in Tibet.''164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, Grant (2016). ''From Lion's Jaws: Chögyam Trungpa's Epic Escape To The West''&lt;/ref&gt; Masked in his account in ''Born in Tibet'' to protect those left behind,&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa, Chögyam (1966). ''Born in Tibet.''&lt;/ref&gt; the first, preparatory stage of his escape had begun a year earlier, when he fled his home monastery after its occupation by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA).&lt;ref&gt;''From Lion's Jaws,'' 65-69.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending the winter in hiding, he decided definitively to escape after learning that his monastery had been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.'' 164&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa started with [[Akong Rinpoche]] and a small party of monastics, but as they traveled people asked to join until the party eventually numbered 300 refugees, from the elderly to mothers with babies – additions which greatly slowed and complicated the journey. Forced to abandon their animals, over half the journey was on foot as the refugees journeyed through an untracked mountain wilderness to avoid the PLA. Sometimes lost, sometimes traveling at night, after three months’ trek they reached the Brahmaputra River. Trungpa, the monastics and about 70 refugees managed to cross the river under heavy gunfire,&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.''230&lt;/ref&gt; then, eating their leather belts and bags to survive, they climbed 19,000 feet over the Himalayas before reaching the safety of Pema Ko.&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.''239&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching India, on January 24, 1960 the party was flown to a refugee camp.&lt;ref&gt;''Born in Tibet.''248&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''From Lion's Jaws.''270&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2006 and 2010, independent Canadian and French researchers using satellite imagery tracked and confirmed Trungpa’s escape route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_157.html|title=Finding the Escape Route |last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, five survivors of the escape in Nepal, Scotland and the U.S. confirmed details of the journey and supplied their personal accounts.&lt;ref&gt;''From Lion's Jaws.''10-12.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent analysis has shown the journey to be directly comparable to such sagas as Shackleton’s 1914/17 Antarctic Expedition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fromlionsjaws.ca/place-in-history|title=Place in History|last=|first=|date= |website=|publisher=|access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 accumulated research and survivors’ stories were published in a full retelling of the story,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fromlionsjaws.ca|title=From Lion's Jaws|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=December 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later in the year preliminary talks began on the funding and production of a movie.

===Early teachings in the West===
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
In exile in India, Trungpa began his study of English. In collaboration with Freda Bedi, who had initiated the project,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Life and Accomplishments of Freda Bedi, in Karma Lekshe Tsomo, editor. Eminent Buddhist Women.|last=Palmo.|first=Tenzin|publisher=SUNY.|year=2014|isbn=143845130X|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa and Akong Tulku founded the Young Lamas Home School and, after seeking endorsement from the Dalai Lama, were appointed its spiritual head and administrator respectively.&lt;ref&gt;''From Lion's Jaws.284''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, with the assistance of sympathetic Westerners, Trungpa received a [[Spalding Trust|Spalding]] sponsorship to study [[Comparative Religion|comparative religion]] at [[St Antony's College, Oxford|St Antony's College]], [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Born in Tibet|last1=Trungpa|first1=Chogyam|publisher=Shambhala Publications|year=2000|isbn=1-57062-116-0|edition=4|location=Boston|pages=252}}&lt;!--| accessdate = 2012-04-05 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|ZEvW__ZNlj0C|The Buddhist Handbook: A Complete Guide to Buddhist Teaching and Practice|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, upon the departure of the western [[Theravada Buddhism|Theravadan]] monk [[Namgyal Rinpoche|Anandabodhi]], Trungpa and [[Akong Rinpoche]] were invited by the Johnstone House Trust in [[Scotland]] to take over a [[meditation]] center, which then became [[Samye Ling]], the first Tibetan Buddhist monastery in the West (future actor and musician [[David Bowie]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhalasun.com/sunspace/?p=20767 "Bringing Chogyam Trungpa's "Crazy Wisdom" to the screen "]&lt;/ref&gt; was one of Trungpa's meditation pupils there). In 1970, after a break with Akong, Trungpa moved to the United States at the invitation of several students.

Shortly after his move to Scotland, a variety of experiences, including a car accident that left him partially paralyzed on the left side of his body, led Trungpa to give up his monastic vows and work as a lay teacher.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Born in Tibet, 1977 edition, Epilogue&lt;/ref&gt; He made that decision principally to mitigate students' becoming distracted by exotic cultures and dress and to undercut their preconceptions of how a guru should behave.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He drank, smoked, slept with students, and often kept students waiting for hours before giving teachings. Much of his behavior has been construed as deliberately provocative and sparked controversy. In one account, he encouraged students to give up smoking [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], claiming that the smoking was not of benefit to their spiritual progress and that it exaggerated neurosis. Students were often angered, unnerved and intimidated by him, but many remained fiercely loyal, committed, and devoted.

Upon moving to the United States in 1970, Trungpa traveled around North America, gaining renown for his ability to present the essence of the highest Buddhist teachings in a form readily understandable to Western students. During this period, he conducted 13 Vajradhatu Seminaries, three-month residential programs at which he presented a vast body of Buddhist teachings in an atmosphere of intensive meditation practice. The seminaries also had the important function of training his students to become teachers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;last paragraph is exact quote from http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/chogyam-trungpa.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===Introduction of the Vajrayana===

Trungpa was one of the first teachers to introduce the esoteric practice of the [[Vajrayana]] to the West. According to Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso, "The one who mainly spread the Vajrayana in the West was Trungpa Rinpoche."&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche; 17 September 2003 [http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_16.html], after [http://www.shambhala.org/teachers/chogyam-trungpa.php]&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to its traditional presentation in Tibet, where the esoteric practices are largely the domain of the monastic sangha, in the US Trungpa introduced the Vajrayana to the lay sangha.&lt;ref&gt;Dead but not lost: grief narratives in religious traditions By Robert Goss, Dennis Klass; p74&lt;/ref&gt;

The presentation of these teachings gave rise to some criticism. According to Trungpa's former student Stephen Butterfield, "Trungpa told us that if we ever tried to leave the Vajrayana, we would suffer unbearable, subtle, continuous anguish, and disasters would pursue us like furies".&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield 11&lt;/ref&gt; Other Vajrayana teachers also warn their students about the dangers of the esoteric path.

Butterfield noted "disquieting resemblances" to cults, and "to be part of Trungpa's inner circle, you had to take a vow never to reveal or even discuss some of the things he did." But Butterfield also notes that "This personal secrecy is common with gurus, especially in Vajrayana Buddhism,"&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield 12, 100&lt;/ref&gt; and acknowledges that Trungpa's organization is anything but a cult: "a mere cult leaves you disgusted and disillusioned, wondering how you could have been a fool. I did not feel that charlatans had hoodwinked me into giving up my powers to enhance theirs. On the contrary, mine were unveiled."&lt;ref&gt;Butterfield 239&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meditation and education centers===
[[File:Karme chöling purkong.jpg|thumb|The purkhang at [[Karmê Chöling]]|349x349px]]
In 1973, Trungpa established [[Vajradhatu]], encompassing all his North American institutions, headquartered in [[Boulder, Colorado]]. Trungpa also founded more than 100 meditation centers throughout the world. Originally known as Dharmadhatus, these centers, now more than 150 in number, are known as [[Shambhala International|Shambhala Meditation Centers]]. He also founded retreat centers for intensive meditation practice, including [[Shambhala Mountain Center]] in [[Red Feather Lakes]], Colorado, [[Karmê Chöling]] in [[Barnet, Vermont]] and [[Gampo Abbey]] in [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia|Cape Breton]], [[Nova Scotia]].

In 1974, Trungpa founded the Naropa Institute, which later became [[Naropa University]], in [[Boulder, Colorado]].  Naropa was the first accredited [[Buddhist universities in the United States and Canada|Buddhist university]] in North America. Trungpa hired [[Allen Ginsberg]] to teach [[poetry]] and [[William Burroughs]] to teach [[literature]].

Trungpa had a number of notable students, among whom were [[Pema Chödrön]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Peter Orlovsky]], [[Anne Waldman]], [[Diane di Prima]], [[Peter Lieberson]], [[John Steinbeck IV]], [[José Argüelles]], [[David Nichtern]], [[Ken Wilber]], [[David Deida]], [[Francisco Varela]], and [[Joni Mitchell]], who portrayed Trungpa in the song "Refuge of the Roads" on her 1976 album [[Hejira (album)|Hejira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/neurotribes/2015/10/26/what-kind-of-buddhist-was-steve-jobs-really/|title=What Kind of Buddhist was Steve Jobs, Really?|accessdate=2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ginsberg, Waldman, and di Prima also taught at Naropa University, and in the 1980s [[Marianne Faithfull]] taught songwriting workshops.
Lesser-known students Trungpa taught in England and the US include Alf Vial, [[Rigdzin Shikpo]] (né Michael Hookham), Jigme Rinzen (né P. Howard Useche), [[Ezequiel Hernandez]] Urdaneta (known as Keun-Tshen Goba after setting up his first meditation center in Venezuela), Miguel Otaola (aka [[Dorje Khandro]]), Francisco Salas Roche, and [[Francesca Fremantle]]. [[Rigdzin Shikpo]] promulgated Trungpa's teachings from a primarily [[Nyingma]] rather than Kagyü point of view at the Longchen Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.longchenfoundation.org/aboutFounder.html Longchen Foundation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128075242/http://www.longchenfoundation.org/aboutFounder.html |date=2012-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rigdzin Shikpo 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shambhala vision===

In 1976, Trungpa began giving a series of secular teachings, some of which were gathered and presented as the [[Shambhala Training]],&lt;ref&gt;Midal 2001, pp 233–247&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trungpa 2004, Introduction to Volume 8&lt;/ref&gt; inspired by his vision (see [[terma (Buddhism)|terma]]) of the legendary Kingdom of [[Shambhala]]. Trungpa had actually started writing about Shambhala before his 1959 escape from Tibet to India, but most of those writings were lost during the escape.&lt;ref&gt;Midal 2005, pp 363–364&lt;/ref&gt;

In his view not only was individual enlightenment not mythical, but the Shambhala Kingdom, an enlightened society, could in fact be actualized. The practice of Shambhala vision is to use mindfulness/awareness meditation as a way to connect with one's [[basic goodness]] and confidence. It is presented as a path that "brings dignity, confidence, and wisdom to every facet of life." Trungpa proposed to lead the Kingdom as ''sakyong'' (Tib. earth protector) with his wife as queen-consort or ''sakyong wangmo.''

Shambhala vision is described as a nonreligious approach rooted in meditation and accessible to individuals of any, or no, religion. In Shambhala terms, it is possible, moment by moment, for individuals to establish enlightened society. His book, ''[[Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior]]'', provides a concise collection of the Shambhala views. According to Trungpa, it was his [[intention]] to propagate the [[Kings of Shambhala|kingdom of Shambala]] that provided the necessary inspiration to leave his homeland and make the arduous journey to India and the West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf Chogyam The Translator, see p. 4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829123015/http://www.shambhala.org/ntc/pdf/Chogyam-the-Translator.pdf |date=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work with arts and sciences===

From the beginning of his time in the US, Trungpa encouraged his students to integrate a contemplative approach into their everyday activities. In addition to making a variety of traditional contemplative practices available to the community, he incorporated his students' already existing interests (especially anything relating to Japanese culture), evolving specialized teachings on a meditative approach to these various disciplines. These included [[kyūdō]] (Japanese archery), [[calligraphy]], [[ikebana]] (flower arranging), [[Sadō]] ([[Japanese tea ceremony]]), [[dance]], [[theater]], [[film]], [[poetry]], [[health care]], and [[psychotherapy]]. His aim was, in his own words, to bring "art to everyday life." He founded the [[Nalanda Foundation]] in 1974 as an umbrella organization for these activities.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

===Death===
Trungpa visited [[Nova Scotia]] for the first time in 1977. In 1983 he established [[Gampo Abbey]], a Karma Kagyü monastery in Cape Breton. The following year, 1984–85, he observed a yearlong retreat at [[Mill Village, Nova Scotia|Mill Village]] and in 1986 he moved his home and Vajradhatu's international headquarters to [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]].

By then he was in failing health due to the auto accident in his youth and years of heavy alcohol use. On September 28, 1986, he suffered cardiac arrest,&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, 2008, p 367&lt;/ref&gt; after which his condition deteriorated, requiring intensive care at the hospital, then at his home and finally, in mid-March 1987, back at the hospital, where he died on April 4, 1987.

In 2006 his wife, Diana Mukpo, wrote, "Although he had many of the classic health problems that develop from heavy drinking, it was in fact more likely the diabetes and high blood pressure that led to abnormal blood sugar levels and then the cardiac arrest".&lt;ref&gt;Mukpo, 2006, p. 382&lt;/ref&gt; But in a November 2008 interview, when asked "What was he ill with? What did he die of?," Trungpa's doctor, Mitchell Levy, replied, "He had chronic liver disease related to his alcohol intake over many years."&lt;ref&gt;Chronicles Radio Presents. November 1st, 2008.&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.chronicleproject.com/chroniclesradio_dispatches/2008_11_01.html]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One of Trungpa's nursing attendants reported that he suffered in his last months from classic symptoms of terminal [[alcoholism]] and [[cirrhosis]],&lt;ref name="Butler17"/&gt; yet continued drinking heavily. She added, "At the same time there was a power about him and an equanimity to his presence that was phenomenal, that I don't know how to explain."&lt;ref&gt;Zweig 1991, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa is reported to have remained in a state of [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samādhi]] for five days after his death, his body not immediately decaying and his heart remaining warm.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, 2008, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; His body was packed in salt, laid in a wooden box, and conveyed to Karmê Chöling. A number of observers have reported that his cremation there on May 26, 1987, was accompanied by various atmospheric effects and other signs traditionally viewed as marks of enlightenment. These included the appearance of rainbows, circling eagles,&lt;ref&gt;Miles, 1989, pp. 526–528&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, 2008, p. 373&lt;/ref&gt; and a cloud in the shape of an ''Ashe''.&lt;ref&gt;"Collective identity and the post-charismatic fate of Shambhala International" by Eldershaw, Lynn P., Ph.D. thesis, University of Waterloo, 2004. pg 222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Everyone who stayed long enough at Trungpa's cremation saw the rainbows." Stephen Butterfield, in ''The new Buddhism: the western transformation of an ancient tradition'' By James William Coleman; p77&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuation of the Shambhala lineage===
Upon Trungpa's death, the leadership of [[Vajradhatu]] was first carried on by his American disciple, appointed regent and Dharma heir, [[Ösel Tendzin]] (Thomas Rich), and then by Trungpa's eldest son and Shambhala heir, [[Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche]].

The next Trungpa [[tülku]], [[Chokyi Sengay]], was recognized in 1991 by [[Tai Situ]] Rinpoche.

==Acclaim==
Major lineage holders of Trungpa's Tibetan Buddhist traditions and many other Buddhist teachers supported his work.
[[File:Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche.jpg|thumb|262x262px|Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche]]
In 1974, Trungpa invited the 16th [[Karmapa]], head of the [[Karma Kagyu]] lineage, to come to the West and offer teachings. Based on this visit, the Karmapa proclaimed Trungpa one of the principal Kagyu lineage holders in the west:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ancient and renowned lineage of the Trungpas, since the great [[siddha]] Trungmase Chökyi Gyamtso Lodrö, possessor of only holy activity, has in every generation given rise to great beings. Awakened by the vision of these predecessors in the lineage, this my present lineage holder, Chökyi Gyamtso Trungpa Rinpoche, supreme incarnate being, has magnificently carried out the vajra holders' discipline in the land of America, bringing about the liberation of students and ripening them in the [[dharma]]. This wonderful truth is clearly manifest.

Accordingly, I empower Chögyam Trungpa Vajra Holder and Possessor of the Victory Banner of the Practice Lineage of the Karma Kagyu. Let this be recognized by all people of both elevated and ordinary station.&lt;ref&gt;"Proclamation to all Those Who Dwell Under the Sun Upholding the Tradition of the Spiritual and Temporal Orders", The Gyalwang Karmapa, 1974, in ''Garuda IV'', 1976, pp 86–87, {{ISBN|0-87773-086-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1981, Trungpa and his students hosted the [[14th Dalai Lama]] in his visit to Boulder, Colorado. Of Trungpa, the Dalai Lama later wrote, "Exceptional as one of the first Tibetan lamas to become fully assimilated into Western culture, he made a powerful contribution to revealing the Tibetan approach to inner peace in the West."&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. x&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa also received support from one of his own main teachers, [[Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche]], head of the [[Nyingma]] lineage.  In addition to numerous [[sadhana]]s and poems dedicated to Trungpa, Khyentse Rinpoche wrote a supplication after Trungpa's death specifically naming him a [[mahasiddha]].&lt;ref&gt;Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, [http://www.chronicleproject.com/tributes/65.html Light of Blessings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche, [http://www.chronicleproject.com/stories_33.html Reflections on Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simhas.org/chogyamtrungpa.html The Vajracarya Trungpa Rinpoche] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205081428/http://www.simhas.org/chogyamtrungpa.html |date=December 5, 2008 }}: "The 1st Trungpa Rinpoche ... was an incarnation of the Indian Mahasiddha Dombipa"&lt;/ref&gt; Among other Tibetan lamas to name Trungpa a mahasiddha are [[Rangjung Rigpe Dorje|the Sixteenth Karmapa]], [[Thrangu Rinpoche]], [[Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche]] and [[Tai Situpa]].&lt;ref&gt;Warrior-King of Shambhala: Remembering Chogyam Trungpa By Jeremy Hayward; p274&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche]] said, "As taught in the Buddhist scriptures, there are nine qualities of a perfect master of buddhadharma. The eleventh Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche possessed all nine of these."&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Suzuki Roshi]], founder of the [[San Francisco Zen Center]] and [[Tassajara Zen Mountain Center]], and another important exponent of Buddhism to western students, described Trungpa in the context of a talk about emptiness:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The way you can struggle with this is to be supported by something, something you don't know. As we are human beings, there must be that kind of feeling. You must feel it in this city or building or community. So whatever community it may be, it is necessary for it to have this kind of spiritual support.

That is why I respect Trungpa Rinpoche. He is supporting us. You may criticize him because he drinks alcohol like I drink water, but that is a minor problem. He trusts you completely. He knows that if he is always supporting you in a true sense you will not criticize him, whatever he does. And he doesn't mind whatever you say. That is not the point, you know. This kind of big spirit, without clinging to some special religion or form of practice, is necessary for human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. 381&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Gehlek Rinpoche]], who lived with Trungpa when they were young monks in India and later visited and taught with him in the U.S., remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He was a great Tibetan yogi, a friend, and a master. The more I deal with Western Dharma students, the more I appreciate how he presented the dharma and the activities that he taught. Whenever I meet with difficulties, I begin to understand – sometimes before solving the problem, sometimes afterward – why Trungpa Rinpoche did some unconventional things. I do consider him to be the father of Tibetan Buddhism in the United States. In my opinion, he left very early – too early. His death was a great loss. Everything he did is significant.&lt;ref&gt;Midal, 2005. p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Diana Mukpo, his wife, stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
First, Rinpoche always wanted feedback. He very, very much encouraged his students’ critical intelligence. One of the reasons that people were in his circle was that they were willing to be honest and direct with him. He definitely was not one of those teachers who asked for obedience and wanted their students not to think for themselves. He thrived, he lived, on the intelligence of his students. That is how he built his entire teaching situation.

From my perspective, I could always be pretty direct with him. Maybe I was not hesitant to do that because I really trusted the unconditional nature of our relationship. I felt there was really nothing to lose by being absolutely direct with him, and he appreciated that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shambhalasun.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2998&amp;Itemid=0]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the forebears formally acknowledged by the Trungpa lineage, and referred to by Trungpa, were the Indian [[mahasiddha]] Ḍombipa&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Born in Tibet|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=33|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as Ḍombi Heruka; his name may have stemmed from his consorting with Dhombis, outcast women)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenon2.com/en/knowledge/mahasiddhas/32-mahasiddha-dombhipa%E2%80%A6-dombipa-dombip%C4%81da-dom-bhi-he-ru-ka-%E2%80%9Che-washer-folk%E2%80%9D%E2%80%9D-tiger-ride|title=Mahasiddha Dombhipa… Dombipa / Dombipāda (dom bhi he ru ka): "He of the Washer Folk"/"The Tiger Rider"|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=12 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Drukpa Kunley|Drukpa Künlek]] (also Kunley), the Mad Yogi of Bhutan, who converted Bhutan to Buddhism and was famous for his fondness for beer and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chogyam Trungpa: His Life and Vision|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=154|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Divine Madman: The Sublime Life and Songs of Drukpa Kunley|last=Dowman|first=Keith|publisher=Createspace|year=2014|isbn=1495379833|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were recognized for their powerful but unorthodox teaching styles.

Trungpa's own teaching style was often unconventional. In his own words, "When we talk about compassion, we talk in terms of being kind. But compassion is not so much being kind; it is being creative to wake a person up."&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Chögyam Trungpa, Volume Six, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; He did not encourage his students to imitate his own behavior, and was troubled by those who felt empowered by his example to do whatever they wanted and manipulate people. As the third [[Jamgon Kongtrul|Jamgön Kongtrül]] explained to Trungpa's students, "You shouldn't imitate or judge the behavior of your teacher, Chögyam Trungpa Rinpoche, unless you can imitate his mind."&lt;ref&gt;Midal 2001, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa's sexuality has been one of the sources of controversy, as he cultivated relations with a number of his female students. [[Tenzin Palmo]], who met him in 1962 while he was still at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], did not become one of his consorts, refusing his advances because he had presented himself as "a pure monk." But Palmo stated that had she known Trungpa had been having sexual relations with women since he was 13, she would not have declined.&lt;ref&gt;''Cave in the Snow: Tendzin Palmo's quest for enlightenment'' by Vicki MacKenzie. Bloomsbury: 1998 {{ISBN|1-58234-004-8}}. pg 31&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa formally renounced his monastic vows in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of Chogyam Trungpa, Volume 1.

Trungpa was also known for smoking tobacco and liberally using alcohol;&lt;ref&gt;Lojong and Tonglen Community Site. [http://lojongmindtraining.com/Biography.aspx?authorID=2 Biography of Chogyam Trungpa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514064434/http://lojongmindtraining.com/Biography.aspx?AuthorID=2 |date=2006-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; many who knew him characterized him as an alcoholic.&lt;ref name="Coleman74"&gt;Coleman 2001, pg. 74&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="das251"&gt;Das 1997, pg. 251&lt;/ref&gt; He began drinking occasionally shortly after arriving in India.&lt;ref&gt;Mukpo 72&lt;/ref&gt; Before coming to the US, Trungpa drove a sports car into a joke shop in [[Dumfries]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Das 1997, pg. 199&lt;/ref&gt; While his companion was not seriously injured,&lt;ref&gt;The new Buddhism: the western transformation of an ancient tradition By James William Coleman; p75&lt;/ref&gt; Trungpa was left partially paralyzed. Later, he described this event as a pivotal moment that inspired the course of his teachings. Some accounts ascribe the accident to drinking.&lt;ref&gt;The American occupation of Tibetan Buddhism: Tibetans and their American ... By Eve Mullen; p56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zweig141"&gt;Zweig 1991, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; Others suggest he may have had a stroke.&lt;ref&gt;"Following a stroke which left him partially paralyzed, Trungpa renounced his monastic vows" The A to Z of Buddhism – Page 258 by Charles S. Prebish&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/contemporarymasters/chogyam-trungpa.htm The Dharma Fellowship]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Trungpa himself, he blacked out.&lt;ref&gt;Warrior-King of Shambhala: Remembering Chogyam Trungpa By Jeremy Hayward; p10&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa often combined drinking with teaching. David Chadwick recounts:&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick 1999, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suzuki [Roshi] asked Trungpa to give a talk to the students in the [[zendo]] the next night. Trungpa walked in tipsy and sat on the edge of the altar platform with his feet dangling. But he delivered a crystal-clear talk, which some felt had a quality – like Suzuki's talks – of not only being about the dharma but being itself the dharma.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some instances Trungpa was too drunk to walk and had to be carried.&lt;ref name="Zweig141" /&gt; Also, according to his student [[John Steinbeck IV]] and his wife, on a couple of occasions Trungpa's speech was unintelligible.&lt;ref name="Steinbeck176_248"&gt;Steinbeck 2001, pp. 176, 248&lt;/ref&gt; One woman reported serving him "big glasses of gin first thing in the morning."&lt;ref name="Butler17"&gt;Butler, Katy. ''Encountering the Shadow in Buddhist America'' in ''Common Boundary'' May/June 1990. pg. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The Steinbecks wrote ''The Other Side of Eden'', a sharply critical memoir of their lives with Trungpa in which they claim that, in addition to alcohol, he spent $40,000 a year on [[cocaine]], and used [[Seconal]] to come down from the cocaine. The Steinbecks said the cocaine use was kept secret from the wider Vajradhatu community.&lt;ref&gt;Steinbeck 2001, pp. 32, 41, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

An incident that became a [[cause célèbre]] among some poets and artists was the Halloween party at Snowmass Colorado Seminary in 1975, held during a 3-month period of intensive meditation and study of the [[Hinayana]], [[Mahayana]], and [[Vajrayana]] vehicles of Tibetan Buddhism. The poet [[W. S. Merwin]] had arrived at the [[Naropa University|Naropa Institute]] that summer and been told by [[Allen Ginsberg]] that he ought to attend the seminary. Although he had not gone through the several years' worth of study and preparatory mind training required, Merwin insisted on attending and Trungpa eventually granted his request – along with Merwin's girlfriend. At seminary the couple kept to themselves. At the Halloween party, after many, including Trungpa himself, had taken off their clothes, Merwin was asked to join the event but refused. On Trungpa's orders, his Vajra Guard forced entry into the poet's locked and barricaded room; brought him and his girlfriend, Dana Naone, against their will, to the party; and eventually stripped them of all their clothes, with onlookers ignoring Naone's pleas for help and for someone to call the police.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, throughout; Miles 1989, pp. 466–470; and Clark 1980, pp. 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; The next day Trungpa asked Merwin and Naone to remain at the Seminary as either students or guests. They agreed to stay for several more weeks to hear the Vajrayana teachings, with Trungpa's promise that "there would be no more incidents" and Merwin's that there would be "no guarantees of obedience, trust, or personal devotion to him."&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, pp. 56, 88&lt;/ref&gt; They left immediately after the last talk. In a 1977 letter to members of a Naropa class investigating the incident, Merwin concluded,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My feelings about Trungpa have been mixed from the start.  Admiration, throughout, for his remarkable gifts; and reservations, which developed into profound misgivings, concerning some of his uses of them.  I imagine, at least, that I've learned some things from him (though maybe not all of them were the things I was "supposed" to learn) and some through him, and I'm grateful to him for those.  I wouldn't encourage anyone to become a student of his. I wish him well.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, 1977, pg. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The incident became known to a wider public when Tom Clark published "The Great Naropa Poetry Wars". The Naropa Institute later asked [[Ed Sanders]] and his class to conduct an internal investigation, resulting in a lengthy report.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marin (1979) p43-58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sanders (1977)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kashner (2004) p. 278ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberger (1986) pp 30-33&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eliot Weinberger]] commented on the incident in a critique aimed at Trungpa and [[Allen Ginsberg]] published in ''[[The Nation]]'' on April 19, 1980. He complained that the fascination of some of the best minds of his generation with Trungpa's presentation of Tibetan Buddhism and Tibetan theocracy created a dangerous exclusivity and elitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadmuseditions.com/Naropa.html|title=Cadmus Editions on Clark's publication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author [[Jeffery Paine]] commented on this incident that "[s]eeing Merwin out of step with the rest, Trungpa could have asked him to leave, but decided it was kinder to shock him out of his aloofness."&lt;ref&gt;Paine (2004) pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt; Paine also noted the outrage felt in particular by poets such as [[Robert Bly]] and [[Kenneth Rexroth]], who began calling Trungpa a [[fascism|fascist]].&lt;ref&gt;Paine (2004) pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Trungpa's choice of Westerner [[Ösel Tendzin]] as his dharma heir was controversial, as Tendzin was the first Western Tibetan Buddhist lineage holder and Vajra Regent. This was exacerbated by Tendzin's own behavior as lineage holder. While knowingly [[HIV]]-positive, Tendzin was sexually involved with students, one of whom became infected and died.&lt;ref&gt;Fields 1992, p. 365&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Close Relationships}}

'''Dating''' is a stage of romantic relationships in humans whereby two people meet socially with the aim of each assessing the other's suitability as a prospective partner in an [[intimate relationship]] or [[marriage]]. It is a form of [[courtship]], consisting of [[socializing|social activities]] done by the couple, either alone or with others. The protocols and practices of dating, and the terms used to describe it, vary considerably from country to country and over time. While the term has several meanings, the most frequent usage refers to two people exploring whether they are romantically or sexually compatible by participating in dates with the other. With the use of modern technology, people can date via telephone or computer or meet in person.

Dating may also involve two or more people who have already decided that they share romantic or sexual feelings toward each other. These people will have dates on a regular basis, and they may or may not be having [[Human sexual activity|sexual relations]]. This period of courtship is sometimes seen as a precursor to [[engagement]].&lt;ref name=twsDecI28&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Lao wai' speak out on false image in China |publisher= ''China Daily'' |date= 2004-02-06 |url= http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-02/06/content_303955.htm |accessdate= 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=twsDecI34ee /&gt; Some cultures require people to wait until a certain age to begin dating, which has been a source of controversy.

== History ==
[[File:Reza Abbasi - Two Lovers (1630).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Persian miniature]] of [[Reza Abbasi]], featuring two lovers (1629–1630)]]
Dating as an institution is a relatively recent phenomenon which has mainly emerged in the last few centuries. From the standpoint of [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]], dating is linked with other institutions such as marriage and the [[family]] which have also been changing rapidly and which have been subject to many forces, including advances in technology and medicine. As humans societies have evolved from [[hunter-gatherer]]s into [[Civilization|civilized societies]], there have been substantial changes in relations between people, with perhaps one of a few remaining [[biology|biological]] constants being that both adult [[Woman|women]] and [[Man|men]] must have [[sexual intercourse]] for human procreation to happen.&lt;ref&gt;Note: although even this is changing, with the advent of test-tube babies, in vitro fertilization, and such.&lt;/ref&gt;

Humans have been compared to other species in terms of sexual behavior. [[Neurobiology|Neurobiologist]] [[Robert Sapolsky]] constructed a reproductive spectrum with opposite poles being [[Display (zoology)|tournament species]], in which males compete fiercely for reproductive privileges with females, and [[pair bond]] arrangements, in which a male and female will bond for life.&lt;ref name=twsDecM11fss&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2010-12-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sapolsky, humans are somewhat in the middle of this spectrum, in the sense that humans form pair bonds, but there is the possibility of cheating or changing partners.&lt;ref name=twsDecM11fss /&gt; These species-particular behavior patterns provide a context for aspects of [[human reproduction]], including dating. However, one particularity of the human species is that pair bonds are often formed without necessarily having the intention of reproduction. In modern times, emphasis on the institution of marriage, generally described as a male-female bond, has obscured pair bonds formed by same-sex and transgender couples, and that many heterosexual couples also bond for life without offspring, or that often pairs that do have offspring separate. Thus, the concept of marriage is changing widely in many countries.

Historically, marriages in most societies were [[Arranged marriage|arranged by parents]] and older relatives with the goal not being [[love]] but legacy and "economic stability and political alliances", according to [[anthropology|anthropologists]].&lt;ref name=twsDecM11&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, there was little need for a temporary trial period such as dating before a permanent community-recognized union was formed between a man and a woman. While pair-bonds of varying forms were recognized by most societies as acceptable social arrangements, marriage was reserved for heterosexual pairings and had a transactional nature, where wives were in many cases a form of property being exchanged between father and husband, and who would have to serve the function of reproduction. Communities exerted pressure on people to form pair-bonds in places such as [[Europe]]; in [[China]], society "demanded people get married before having a sexual relationship"&lt;ref name=twsDecI22bb&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many societies found that some formally recognized bond between a man and a woman was the best way of rearing and educating [[child]]ren as well as helping to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings regarding competition for mates.

Generally, during much of recorded history of humans in civilization, and into the [[Middle Ages]] in [[Europe]], weddings were seen as [[business]] arrangements between families, while romance was something that happened outside of marriage discreetly, such as covert meetings.&lt;ref name=twsDecH34a /&gt; The 12th-century book ''[[De amore (Andreas Capellanus)|The Art of Courtly Love]]'' advised that "True love can have no place between husband and wife."&lt;ref name=twsDecH34a&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one view, clandestine meetings between men and women, generally outside of marriage or before marriage, were the precursors to today's dating.&lt;ref name=twsDecH34a /&gt;

From about 1700 a worldwide movement perhaps described as the "empowerment of the individual" took hold, leading towards greater emancipation of women and equality of individuals. Men and women became more equal politically, financially, and socially in many nations. Women eventually won the right to vote in many countries and own property and receive [[Equality before the law|equal treatment by the law]], and these changes had profound impacts on the relationships between men and women. Parental influence declined. In many societies, individuals could decide—on their own—whether they should marry, whom they should marry, and when they should marry. A few centuries ago, dating was sometimes described as a "courtship ritual where young women entertained gentleman callers, usually in the home, under the watchful eye of a [[Chaperone (social)|chaperone]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but increasingly, in many Western countries, it became a self-initiated activity with two young people going out as a couple in public together. Still, dating varies considerably by nation, custom, religious upbringing, technology, and social class, and important exceptions with regards to individual freedoms remain as many countries today still practice arranged marriages, request dowries, and forbid same-sex pairings. Although in many countries, movies, meals, and meeting in coffeehouses and other places is now popular, as are advice books suggesting various strategies for men and women,&lt;ref name=twsDecH26c&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other parts of the world, such as in South Asia and many parts of the Middle East, being alone in public as a couple with another person is not only frowned upon but can even lead to either person being socially ostracized.

In the twentieth century, dating was sometimes seen as a precursor to marriage but it could also be considered as an end-in-itself, that is, an informal social activity akin to [[friendship]]. It generally happened in that portion of a person's life before the age of marriage,&lt;ref name=twsDecH34b&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[text messaging]]&lt;ref name=twsDecNfaas /&gt; enabled dates to be arranged without face-to-face contact. [[effects of the automobile on societies|Cars]] extended the range of dating as well as enabled back-seat sexual exploration. In the mid-twentieth century, the advent of [[birth control]] as well as safer procedures for [[abortion]] changed the equation considerably, and there was less pressure to marry as a means for satisfying sexual urges. New types of relationships formed; it was possible for people to live together without marrying and without [[children]]. Information about [[human sexuality]] grew, and with it an acceptance of all types of sexual orientations is becoming more common. Today, the institution of dating continues to evolve at a rapid rate with new possibilities and choices opening up particularly through [[online dating]].

== Dating as a social relationship ==

=== Wide variation in behavior patterns ===
[[File:Mary Poppins8.jpg|thumb|right|[[Julie Andrews]] as [[Mary Poppins]].]]
{{quote|text=And the only rule is that there are no rules.|sign=[[Kira Cochrane]]&lt;ref name=twsDecH27a134kcc /&gt;}}
Social rules regarding dating vary considerably according to variables such as country, social class, race, religion, age, sexual orientation and gender. Behavior patterns are generally unwritten and constantly changing. There are considerable differences between social and personal [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. Each culture has particular patterns which determine such choices as whether the man asks the woman out, where people might meet, whether kissing is acceptable on a first date, the substance of conversation, who should pay for meals or entertainment,&lt;ref name="twsDecH26j"&gt;{{cite news

Among the [[Karen people]] in [[Burma]] and [[Thailand]], women are expected to write love poetry and give gifts to win over the man.&lt;ref name="Phan, Zoya 2009"&gt;Phan, Zoya (2009). Little Daughter: a Memoir of Survival in Burma and the West. [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs references to more reliable sources like a scientific study or poll.|date=March 2018}} Since dating can be a stressful situation, there is the possibility of humor to try to reduce tensions. For example, director [[Blake Edwards]] wanted to date singing star [[Julie Andrews]], and he joked in parties about her persona by saying that her "endlessly cheerful governess" image from movies such as ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' gave her the image of possibly having "lilacs for pubic hair";&lt;ref name=twsDecQ&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews appreciated his humor, sent him lilacs, dated him and later married him, and the couple stayed together for 41 years until his death in 2010.&lt;ref name=twsDecQ /&gt;

=== Different meanings of the term ===
While the term ''dating'' has many meanings, the most common refers to a trial period in which two people explore whether to take the relationship further towards a more permanent relationship; in this sense, dating refers to the time when people are physically together in public as opposed to the earlier time period in which people are arranging the date, perhaps by corresponding by email or text or phone.&lt;ref name=twsDecH27der5 /&gt; Another meaning of the term ''dating'' is to describe a stage in a person's life when he or she is actively pursuing romantic relationships with different people. If two unmarried celebrities are seen in public together, they are often described as "dating" which means they were seen in public together, and it is not clear whether they are merely friends, exploring a more intimate relationship, or are romantically involved. A related sense of the term is when two people have been out in public only a few times but have not yet committed to a relationship; in this sense, ''dating'' describes an initial trial period and can be contrasted with "being in a committed relationship".

=== Evaluation ===
One of the main purposes of dating is for two or more people to evaluate one another's suitability as a long term companion or spouse. Often physical characteristics, personality, financial status, and other aspects of the involved persons are judged and, as a result, feelings can be hurt and confidence shaken. Because of the uncertainty of the whole situation, the desire to be acceptable to the other person, and the possibility of rejection, dating can be very stressful for all parties involved. Some studies have shown that dating tends to be extremely difficult for people with [[social anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Sarah B., and Tracy L. Morris. "College dating and social anxiety: Using the Internet as a means of connecting to others." CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior 10.5 (2007): 680-688.&lt;/ref&gt;

While some of what happens on a date is guided by an understanding of basic, unspoken rules, there is considerable room to experiment, and there are numerous sources of advice available.

There are numerous ways to meet potential dates, including blind dates, classified ads, dating websites, hobbies, holidays, office romance, social networking, speed dating, and others. A Pew study in 2005 which examined Internet users in long-term relationships including marriage, found that many met by contacts at work or at school.&lt;ref name=twsDecH19e /&gt; The survey found that 55% of relationship-seeking [[single person|singles]] agreed that it was "difficult to meet people where they live."&lt;ref name=twsDecH19e /&gt;  Work is a common place to meet potential spouses, although there are some indications that the Internet is overtaking the workplace as an introduction venue.&lt;ref name=twsDecH21d&gt;{{cite news

=== Gender differences ===
There is a general perception that men and women approach dating differently, hence the reason why advice for each sex varies greatly, particularly when dispensed by popular magazines. For example, it is a common belief that heterosexual men often seek women based on [[Physical attractiveness|beauty]] and [[youth]].&lt;ref name=twsDecH22 /&gt;&lt;ref name=twsDecM18&gt;{{cite news

All of these are examples of gender stereotypes which plague dating discourse and shape individuals' and societies' expectations of how heterosexual relationships should be navigated. In addition to the detrimental effects of upholding limited views of relationships and sexual and romantic desires, stereotypes also lead to framing social problems in a problematic way. For example, some have noted that educated women in many countries including [[Italy]] and [[Russia]], and the [[United States]] find it difficult to have a [[career]] as well as raise a family, prompting a number of writers to suggest how women should approach dating and how to time their careers and personal life. The advice comes with the assumption that the work-life balance is inherently a "woman's problem." In many societies, there is a view that women should fulfill the role of primary caregivers, with little to no spousal support and with few services by employers or government such as parental leave or child care. Accordingly, an issue regarding dating is the subject of career timing which generates controversy. Some views reflect a traditional notion of gender roles. For example, [[Danielle Crittenden]] in ''What Our Mothers Didn't Tell Us'' argued that having both a career and family at the same time was taxing and stressful for a woman; as a result, she suggested that women should date in their early twenties with a seriousness of purpose, marry when their relative beauty permitted them to find a reliable partner, have children, then return to work in their early thirties with kids in school; Crittenden acknowledged that splitting a career path with a ten-year baby-raising hiatus posed difficulties.&lt;ref name=twsDecxfpu89&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are contrasting views which suggest that women should focus on careers in their twenties and thirties. Columnist [[Maureen Dowd]] quoted comedian [[Bill Maher]] on the subject of differing dating agendas between men and women: "Women get in relationships because they want somebody to talk to -- men want women to shut up."&lt;ref name=twsDecH26b&gt;{{cite news

In studies comparing children with heterosexual families and children with homosexual families, there have been no major differences noted; though some claims suggest that kids with homosexual parents end up more well adjusted than their peers with heterosexual parents, purportedly due to the lack of marginalizing gender roles in same-sex families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/bibliography/same-sex-parents|title=Same-sex parents|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is increasingly common today, however, with new generations and in a growing number of countries, to frame the work-life balance issue as a social problem rather than a gender problem. With the advent of a changing workplace, the increased participation of women in the [[labor force]], an increasing number of men who are picking up their share of parenting and housework,
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contemporaryfamilies.org/marriage-partnership-divorce/menchange.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501053233/http://www.contemporaryfamilies.org/marriage-partnership-divorce/menchange.html |date=2013-05-01 }} Article&lt;/ref&gt; and more governments and industries committing themselves to achieving gender equality, the question of whether or not, or when to start a family is slowly being recognized as an issue that touches (or should touch) both genders.

According to one source, there are four ways that marriage can happen among the [[Nyangatom people]]: (1) arranged marriage, when well-respected elders are sent to the girl's family on behalf of the boy's family; (2) courtship or dating after a friendly meeting between boy and girl such as at a market place or holiday where there's dancing; (3) abduction, such as during a blood feud between families; (4) inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Baptized In Game - The Rebirth Of The New Millennium Man (tips for Urban Dating, Women, Relationships and sexual improvement |publisher=Forbidden Fruit Books LLC |page=150 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jc24YsVsG_cC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq=There+are+four+types+of+marriage+among+the+Nyangatom+marriage+by+arrangement,+by+the+couple%27s+mutual+consent+by+abduction+and+by+inheritance#v=onepage&amp;q=There%20are%20four%20types%20of%20marriage%20among%20the%20Nyangatom%20marriage%20by%20arrangement%2C%20by%20the%20couple's%20mutual%20consent%20by%20abduction%20and%20by%20inheritance |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian dating is heavily influenced by the custom of arranged marriages which require little dating, although there are strong indications that the institution is undergoing change, and that ''love marriages'' are becoming more accepted as India becomes more intertwined with the rest of the world.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are indications that even the institution of arranged marriages is changing, with marriages increasingly being arranged by "unknown, unfamiliar sources" and less based on local families who know each other.&lt;ref name=twsDecIv16b /&gt; Writer Lavina Melwani in ''Little India'' compared Indian marriages to business deals:

{{quote|Until recently, Indian marriages had all the trappings of a business transaction involving two deal-making families, a hardboiled matchmaker and a vocal board of shareholders – concerned uncles and aunts. The couple was almost incidental to the deal. They just dressed and showed up for the wedding ceremony.

Relationships in which dating is undertaken by two people, who choose their dates without parental involvement and sometimes carry on clandestine get-togethers, has become increasingly common. When this leads to a wedding, the resulting unions are sometimes called ''love marriages''. There are increasing instances when couples initiate contact on their own, particularly if they live in a foreign country; in one case, a couple met surreptitiously over a game of cards.&lt;ref name=twsDecH36 /&gt; Indians who move abroad to Britain or America often follow the cultural patterns of their new country: for example, one Indian woman met a white American man while skiing, and married him, and the formerly "all-important relatives" were reduced to bystanders trying to influence things ineffectively.&lt;ref name=twsDecH36 /&gt; Factors operating worldwide, such as increased affluence, the need for longer education, and greater mobility have lessened the appeal for arranged marriages, and these trends have affected criteria about which possible partners are acceptable, making it more likely that pairings will cross previously impenetrable barriers such as caste or ethnic background.&lt;ref name=twsDecH36 /&gt; [[Indian Americans]] in the U.S. sometimes participate in ''Singles Meets'' organized by websites which happen about once a month, with 100 participants at each event; an organizer did not have firm statistics about the success rate leading to a long-term relationship but estimated about one in every ten members finds a partner through the site.&lt;ref name=twsDecH36gg&gt;{{cite news

==== Korea ====
The reasons for dating in Korea are various. Research conducted by ''Saegye Daily'' showed that teenagers choose to date for reasons such as "to become more mature," "to gain consultation on worries, or troubles," or "to learn the difference between boys and girls," etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=022&amp;aid=0000146456|title=중학입학전 이성교제 76%|work=naver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a news report in ''MK Daily'' showed that the primary reasons for dating for workers of age 20 ~ 30 are "emotional stability," "marriage," "someone to spend time with," etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2013&amp;no=442164|title=MK News - `직장인 연애 목적 1위는 결혼이 아니다`|work=mk.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; An interesting feature in the reasons for dating in Korea is that many Koreans are somewhat motivated to find a date due to the societal pressure that often views single persons as incompetent.&lt;ref name="news.kukinews.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.kukinews.com/article/view.asp?page=1&amp;gCode=kmi&amp;arcid=0006704337&amp;cp=nv|title=[살며 사랑하며-안주연] 연애 난민|work=kukinews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Present Korean dating shows a changing attitude due to the influence of tradition and modernization. There are a lot of Confucian ideas and practices that still saturate South Korean culture and daily life as traditional values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Korean Confucianism#Contemporary society and Confucianism]]&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchy in Korea has been grounded on Confucian culture that postulated hierarchical social orders according to age and sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Kwang-ok|title=The Reproduction of Confucian Culture in Contemporary Korea: An Anthropological Study," In Confucian Traditions in East Asian Modernity|date=1996|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchy and Women Patriarchy is "a system of social structure and practices in which men dominate, oppress and exploit women” which is well reflected in the ways of dating in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Review of Korean Studies|journal=Academy of Korean Studies|date=2002|volume=5|issue=2|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding to it, there is an old saying that says a boy and a girl should not sit together after they have reached the age of seven. It is one of the old teachings of Confucianism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=2015363&amp;cid=4386&amp;categoryId=4386|title=남녀칠세부동석|work=naver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reveals its inclination toward conservatism.

Most Koreans tend to regard dating as a precursor to marriage. According to a survey conducted by Gyeonggi-do Family Women's Researcher on people of age 26-44, 85.7% of respondents replied as ‘willing to get married’. There is no dating agency but the market for marriage agencies are growing continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mk.co.kr/newsRead.php?year=2013&amp;no=1203881|title=MK News - "배우자나 찾아볼까"…불황에도 `잘나가는` 결혼정보회사|work=mk.co.kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; DUO and Gayeon are one of the major marriage agencies in Korea.

However, the majority still takes getting into a relationship seriously.

Dating in Korea is also considered a necessary activity supported by society.&lt;ref name="news.kukinews.com" /&gt; Korean adults are constantly questioned whether or not they are dating by the people around them.&lt;ref name="news.kukinews.com" /&gt; During family gatherings on holidays one of the questions that people hate getting asked the most is related to marriage.&lt;ref name="news1.kr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news1.kr/articles/1005265|title=명절 스트레스 1위 질문 "결혼은? 애인은? 애는?"|work=뉴스1 코리아|language=kr}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a survey it was the highest ranked by 47.3 percent.&lt;ref name="news1.kr" /&gt;

College students in their sophomore to junior year who have not been in a relationship feel anxious that they are falling behind amongst their peers. Most of them try "sogaeting", going out on a blind date, for the first time to get into a relationship. Dating is a duty that most people feel they must take on to not seem incompetent.&lt;ref name="h21.hani.co.kr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h21.hani.co.kr/arti/special/special_general/36496.html|title=[제1000호]연애, 마침내 ‘스펙’이 되다 : 특집일반 : 특집 : 뉴스 : 한겨레21|work=hani.co.kr|language=kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent trends, even dramas such as “”Shining Romance” (“빛나는 로맨스”), and “Jang Bo-ri is Here!” (“왔다 장보리”),  and in a variety show called, “Dad! Where Are We Going?” (“아빠 어디가?”) there are elementary children confessing their love.

Dating has also been depicted to be an activity of fun and happiness. There are Korean TV programs that film celebrities together as married couples supporting this depiction of dating such as “We Got Married” (“우리 결혼했어요”), “With You” (“님과 함께”) and “The Man Who Gets Married Daily” (“매일 결혼 하는 남자.”)&lt;ref name="h21.hani.co.kr" /&gt;

According to a survey by wedding consulting agency, men consider a physical relation as a catalyst of love, otherwise, women regard it as a confirmation of affection. Adding to it, both 79.2% of men and 71.0% of women stated that how deep their physical relation in dating is concerned in the decision of whether to marry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.donga.com/3/all/20080710/8600934/1|title=연인들의 스킨쉽…男 ‘사랑의 촉진제’, 女 ‘애정확인’|work=donga.com|language=kr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pakistan ====
Marriages and courtship in [[Pakistan]] are influenced by traditional cultural practices similar to those elsewhere in the [[Indian subcontinent]] as well as [[Muslim]] norms and manners. Illegitimate relationships before marriage are considered a social taboo and social interaction between unmarried men and women is encouraged at a modest and healthy level. Couples are usually wedded through either an [[arranged marriage]] or [[love marriage]]. Love marriages are those in which the individuals have chosen a partner whom they like by their own choice prior to marriage, and usually occur with the consent of parents and family. Arranged marriages on the other hand are marriages which are set and agreed by the families or guardians of the two individuals where the couple may not have met before. In either cases and in consistency with traditional marital practices, individuals who marry are persuaded to meet and talk to each other for some time before considering marrying so that they can check their compatibility.

==== Singapore ====
[[Singapore]]'s largest dating service, SDU, [[Social Development Unit]], is a government-run dating system. The original SDU, which controversially promoted marriages among university graduate singles, no longer exists today. On 28 January 2009, it was merged with SDS [Social Development Services], which just as controversially promoted marriages among non-graduate singles. The merged unit, SDN [http://app.sdn.sg/AboutSDN.aspx Social Development Network] seeks to promote meaningful relationships, with marriage touted as a top life goal, among all resident [Singapore] singles within a conducive network environment of singles, relevant commercial and public entities.

In Britain, the term ''dating'' bears similarity to the American sense of the tentative exploratory part of a relationship. If two people are ''going out together'', it may mean they're dating but that their relationship has advanced to a relatively long-standing and sexual boyfriend-girlfriend relationship although they're not cohabiting. Although Britons are familiar with the term ''dating,'' the rituals surrounding courtship are somewhat different from those commonly found in [[North America]]. Writer [[Kira Cochrane]] advises daters to "get out there and meet people" while noting a trend of temporary suspension of marriage until an individual reaches his or her thirties.&lt;ref name=twsDecH27a134kcc&gt;{{cite news

While analysts such as [[Harald Martenstein]] and others suggest that it is easier for persons to initiate contact in America, many Germans view the American dating habits as "unspontaneous", "ridiculous" and "rigid".{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Until the 1960s, countries such as [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]] had a more formal approach for first contacts that was eased during seasonal festivals like [[Carnival in Germany, Switzerland and Austria|carnival]] and festivals and [[Travelling funfair|funfairs]] like the [[Oktoberfest]], which allowed for more casual flirts.&lt;ref&gt;Politik in einer deutschen Kleinstadt, [d. i. Bretten], Enke, Stuttgart 1970, {{ISBN|3-432-01618-2}}, Benita Luckmann&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in [[voluntary association]]s is relatively high in German-speaking countries and these provided further chances for possible partners to meet. Strolling on [[Esplanade]]s and Promenade walkways such as the one in Hamburg called the [[Jungfernstieg]] (maidens way), have been another venue for introductions as early as the 19th century. Analyst [[Geoffrey Gorer]] described dating as an American [[idiosyncrasy]] focusing on youth of college age and expressed in activities such as American [[prom]]s. In contrast German speaking countries and the longstanding musical tradition there provided ample opportunity of persons of varying ages enjoying social dances, such as the [[Vienna Opera Ball]] and other occasions.

Romantic encounters were often described with [[French language|French]] terms like [[wikt:rendezvous|rendezvous]] or [[wikt:tête-à-tête|tête-à-tête]]. The [[German language|German]] term of ''Stelldichein'' (as translated by [[Joachim Heinrich Campe]]s) is used to signify dating when the age of consent to marriage was relatively high. German traditions to signify lovers who met in hiding were described with terms like ''Fensterln'' (windowing) or ''Kiltgang'' (dawn stroll) used in [[Bavaria]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref Name=mart&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/2009/28/Martenstein-28 "No talk, no deal" Unser Kolumnist versteht endlich die amerikanischen Regeln der Partnerwahl] (Our Commentator finally understands the American Rucles of choosing a partner) [[Harald Martenstein]], [[Die Zeit]]  29 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Analyst Sebastian Heinzel sees a major cultural divide between American dating habits and European informality, and leads to instances in which European expatriates in cities such as [[New York, New York|New York]] keep to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/zeitung/das-war-so-nicht-verabredet/v_default,1061296.html Das war so nicht verabredet!

Today, most German couples in long-term relationships get to know each other through mutual friends, at work or while going out at night; the first few months of dating often involve sexual intercourse, but are still rather casual and do not imply a serious wish to get married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/ratgeber/partnerschaft/dating/hier-lernen-sich-die-meisten-paare-kennen-28022476.bild.html|title=Wo findet man einen Partner?

==== Italy ====
Italians maintain a conservative approach to dating. Also, inviting friends or relatives during a date is not uncommon. More modern approaches such as blind dates, speed dating and dating websites are not as popular as abroad, and are not considered very effective by the majority of the population. However, social network members outnumber the European average,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.it/internet/social-network/2014/02/17/lo-scenario-social-digital-e-mobile-europa-e-italia/ |title=Lo scenario social, digital e mobile in Europa e in Italia |date=17 February 2014 |accessdate=24 May 2014 |language=it |trans-title=The social, digital and mobile scenario in Europe and Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they may use Facebook for dating purposes too.

==== Israel ====
In Israel, in the secular community, dating is very common amongst both heterosexual and homosexual couples. However, because of the religious community, there are some religious exceptions to the dating process.
In the Haredi and Chasidic communities (Ultra-Orthodox Judaism) most couples are paired through a matchmaker.  In this arranged marriage system, young adults meet a couple times under the supervision of their parents, and after they meet, the two are asked whether they will agree to be married.

Furthermore, [[Marriage in Israel|in terms of marriage]], because the state religion is essentially Orthodox-Judaism, Conservative and Reform (Liberal denominations of Judaism) Jews cannot get married through a Conservative or Reform Rabbi without the approval of the State's Orthodox Head Rabbi.

There are similar problems in Israel for people of different denominations of other religions as well. Essentially, if you live in Israel, and the head of your religion doesn't want you to get married, you can't get religiously married.

Because people of two different religions or people of the same sex cannot get married in Israel, people in these situations oftentimes have to go overseas to get married since Israel does recognize overseas marriages.

=== North America ===
[[File:1804 Ralph Eleaser Whiteside Earl Family Portrait National Gallery of Art.jpg|thumb|An American Family]]
In many cultures around the world, dating is a serious family matter, which is based on its culture and social values. Parents in said cultures believe in arranged marriage, or at least make sure that their children get married at a certain age. However, in the United States, independency plays an important role in how singles value and date others. In America, dating is mostly a personal decision rather than based on the influence of parents. However, parents still usually expect their children to get married, but is still their son or daughter's choice between whom they want to date or marry.  Middle class tend to prioritize other things that are more important to them, such as get a college degree, a job, and then date their future spouse to settle down. Before the internet era, some Americans would meet their prospective husband or wife in college, through friends, at work, etc.  But now is very popular that singles are trying to meet people on websites and from cell phone applications.  Dating people online can create other social issues.  For example, some individuals might get in the illusion that there are so many singles looking for your mate, therefore some can get into a bad habit of constantly meet new people, but do not want to get in a meaningful relationship and they may spend years dating looking for a perfect mate when in reality that does not exist.  [http://web.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe/Rosenfeld_How_Couples_Meet_Working_Paper.pdf]  Online dating might add up the number of single people who are looking for a mate or a relationship that can lead them to a courtship since having so many choices can be difficult to make up your mind. http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2015032000

Meeting people from social sites might isolate us even more due to lack of communication face to face with friends and interact with new people on public places.

There is evidence that [[wikt:couple|couples]] differ in the pace and timing with which they initiate [[sex]] in their relationships. Studies show that approximately 50% of [[premarital]] young adult couples become sexually involved within the first month of dating, while 25% initiate sex one to three months after beginning to date and a small proportion of couples wait until [[marriage]] before initiating sexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;Busby, D.

Teenagers and college-aged students tend to avoid the more formal activity of dating, and prefer casual no-strings-attached experiments sometimes described as ''hookups''.

=== Matchmaking systems and services ===
Dating systems can be systematic and organized ways to improve [[matchmaking]] by using rules or technology. The meeting can be in-person or ''live'' as well as separated by time or space such as by [[telephone]] or [[email]] or chat-based. The purpose of the meeting is for the two persons to decide whether to go on a date in the future.

* [[Speed dating]] consists of organized matchmaking events that have multiple single persons meet one-on-one in brief timed sessions so that singles can assess further whether to have subsequent dates. An example is meeting perhaps twenty potential partners in a bar with brief interviews between each possible couple, perhaps lasting three minutes in length, and shuffling partners. In [[Shanghai, China|Shanghai]], one event featured eight-minute one-on-one meetings in which participants were pre-screened by age and education and career, and which costs 50 yuan ($6 USD) per participant; participants are asked not to reveal contact information during the brief meeting with the other person, but rather place names in cards for organizers to arrange subsequent dates.&lt;ref name=twsDecI24&gt;{{cite news

* '''Video dating''' systems of the 1980s and 1990s especially, where customers gave a performance on (typically [[VHS]]) video, which was viewable by other customers, usually in private, in the same facility. Some services would record and play back videos for men and women on alternate days to minimize the chance that customers would meet each other on the street.
* '''Phone dating''' systems of about the same vintage, where customers call a common voice mail or phone-chat server at a common local phone number, and are connected with other (reputed) singles, and typically charged by the minute as if it were a long-distance call (often a very expensive one). A key problem of such systems was that they were hard to differentiate from a phone porn service or "[[phone sex]]" where female operators are paid to arouse male customers and have no intention of ever dating them.
* '''Online dating''' systems use websites or mobile phone apps to connect possible romantic or sexual partners. One gay man found dating online difficult, and found there is an element of deception on dating website profiles just like everywhere else:

{{quote|''Very attractive'' translates as ''big-headed'' ... ''Average build'' means ''a bit paunchy'' ... ''5ft 10'' is actually ''5ft 7 and a half'' ... The picture is always taken from the best, most flattering angle ... Black and white photos mean ''I am pretentious'' or ''I've something to hide'' ... Anyone who writes in text speak or says ''I heart'' instead of ''I like'' should be avoided ... Ditto for people whose interests include ''feet''.|&lt;ref name=twsDecH34l&gt;{{cite news

Computer dating systems of the later 20th century, especially popular in the 1960s and 1970s, before the rise of sophisticated phone and computer systems, gave customers forms that they filled out with important tolerances and preferences, which were "matched by computer" to determine "compatibility" of the two customers. The history of dating systems is closely tied to the history of technologies that support them, although a statistics-based dating service that used data from forms filled out by customers opened in [[Newark, New Jersey]] in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gU4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA78 | title=Life Goes on a Date Arranged by Statistics | work=Life | date=1942-08-03 | accessdate=November 17, 2011 | pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first large-scale computer dating system, The Scientific Marriage Foundation, was established in 1957 by Dr. [[George W.

* [[Mobile dating]]/cell phone dating: Text messages to and from a mobile/cell phone carrier are used to show interest in others on the system. Can be web-based or online dating as well depending on the company.

=== Board games ===
''[[Mystery Date (game)|Mystery Date]]'' is a [[board game]] from the [[Milton Bradley Company]], originally released in 1965 and reissued in 1970, 1999, and in 2005, whose object is to be ready for a date by acquiring three matching color-coded cards to assemble an outfit. The outfit must then match the outfit of the date at the "mystery door". If the player's outfit does not match the date behind the door, the door is closed and play continues. The game has been mentioned, featured, or parodied in several popular films and television shows.

=== Television ===
Numerous [[Reality TV|television reality]] and [[game show]]s, past and current, address dating. For example, the [[dating game show]]s ''[[The Dating Game]]'' first aired in 1965, while more modern shows in that genre include ''[[The Manhattan Dating Project]]'' (US Movie about Dating in New York City), ''[[Blind Date (US TV series)|Blind Date]]'', ''[[The 5th Wheel]]'', and ''[[The Bachelor (US TV series)|The Bachelor]]'' and its spinoff series, in which a high degree of support and aids are provided to individuals seeking dates. These are described more fully [[Dating game show|here]] and in the related article on "[[reality game show]]s" that often include or motivate romantic episodes between players.  Another category of dating-oriented reality TV shows involves [[matchmaking]], such as ''[[Millionaire Matchmaker]]'' and ''[[Tough Love (TV series)|Tough Love]]''.

== Age groups ==
Dating can happen for people in most age groups with the possible exception of young children. [[Teenagers]] and [[Preadolescence|tweens]] have been described as dating; according to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]], three-quarters of eighth and ninth graders in the United States described themselves as "dating", although it is unclear what is exactly meant by this term.&lt;ref name=twsDecH12&gt;{{cite news

While people tend to date others close to their own age, it's possible for older men to date younger women. In many countries, the older-man-younger-woman arrangement is seen as permissible, sometimes with benefits. It's looked on more positively in the U.S. than in China; older men are described as more knowledgeable sexually and intellectually, supportive, skilled in the ways of women, and financially more secure so there's "no more going Dutch."&lt;ref name=twsDecI36a&gt;{{cite news

'''Edward Lamar Hopson''' (born June 30, 1971) is a former professional [[boxing|boxer]].

==Amateur career==
Born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], Hopson took up boxing at the age of seven. Hopson earned a [[AAU Junior Olympic Games|Junior Olympics]] gold medal in 1987, and was the [[National Golden Gloves Featherweight Champion]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berger|first=Phil|title=Olympic Profile: Ed Hopson; A Quick Study Is Moving Up Fast|work=The New York Times|date=1988-07-10|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/10/sports/olympic-profile-ed-hopson-a-quick-study-is-moving-up-fast.html|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1988, he won the Olympic Trials in the featherweight division; after a semifinal victory against [[World Amateur Boxing Championships|world amateur champion]] [[Kelcie Banks]], Hopson took a 3–2 decision over [[Carl Daniels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schuyler Jr.|first=Ed|title=Hopson claims 125-pound title|work=The Times-News|agency=Associated Press|date=1988-07-11|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ihsaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XSQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2939,2487289|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the Olympic Boxoffs, Hopson lost to Banks in a pair of fights; because of these losses, he did not compete in the [[Boxing at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hamelin|first=Joe|title=Hopson knew it|work=The Modesto Bee|date=1988-07-18|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hkcjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jswFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1557,5449138|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
Known as "Fast" Eddie, Hopson turned pro in 1989 and captured the vacant [[International Boxing Federation]] [[super featherweight]] title in 1995 with a [[knockout]] win over Moises Pedroza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Leads Austria in Fed Cup|work=Los Angeles Times|date=1995-04-23|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-23/sports/sp-57875_1_fed-cup/2|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost the belt in his first defense, to [[Tracy Harris Patterson]], later that year by 2nd round technical knockout (TKO), a round in which Hopson had four knockdowns recorded against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patterson stops Hopson|work=Sun Journal|agency=Associated Press|date=1995-07-10|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WtcgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DGsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5106,1469872|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterward, Hopson lost via TKO to Santos Lopez and retired.

He had a brief comeback in 1998 but retired for good in 1999.

'''Elyse Marie Pahler''' (April 24, 1980 – July 22, 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanluisobispo.com/2010/04/14/1102851/elyse-pahler-killed-in-nipomo.html|title=Latest local news from San Luis Obispo, CA - The Tribune|work=sanluisobispo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a murder victim, whose parents attempted to sue the American [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]], claiming that their music contributed to their daughter's death. Pahler was murdered in the summer of 1995.

==Murder==
Fifteen-year-old Elyse Pahler's body was discovered near her home in [[Arroyo Grande]], [[California]], in March 1996. She had been raped and murdered there eight months earlier by acquaintances Jacob Delashmutt, Joseph Fiorella and Royce Casey. The perpetrators apparently returned to the corpse and had sex with it on several occasions. The body was located after Casey confessed to the crime following a conversion to [[Christianity]]. All three eventually pleaded [[nolo contendere|no contest]] to her murder and are now imprisoned and serving 25 years to life.&lt;ref name="RollingStone.com February 20"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5932134/judge_throws_out_slayer_suit |title=Judge Throws Out Slayer Suit |publisher=Rolling Stone |accessdate=2015-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105032602/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5932134/judge_throws_out_slayer_suit |archivedate=January 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The trio had lured Elyse from her house with the stated intention of killing her as part of a satanic ritual, although the crime bears many of the hallmarks of similar sexually motivated murders. In their defense, the defendants said they had needed to commit a "sacrifice to the [[devil]]" in order to give their heavy metal band, Hatred, the "craziness" to "go professional".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/local/crime/article39122823.html|title=Elyse Pahler: Killed in Nipomo in 1995|date=April 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal case==
David and Lisanne Pahler claimed that the Slayer songs "Postmortem" and "[[Dead Skin Mask]]" (from the albums ''[[Reign in Blood]]'' and ''[[Seasons in the Abyss]]'', respectively) gave the three killers detailed instructions to "[[stalking|stalk]], [[rape]], [[torture]], murder and commit acts of [[necrophilia]]" on their daughter. The lawsuit was originally filed in 1996 but delayed until 2000 when the killers' trial was concluded. The initial case was originally thrown out, the judge stating, "There's not a legal position that could be taken that would make Slayer responsible for the girl's death. Where do you draw the line? You might as well start looking through the library at every book on the shelf."&lt;ref name="MetalHammer.com February 20"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=38796 |title=Slayer Case Dismissed |publisher=Metal Hammer |accessdate=2007-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927184056/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=38796 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Undeterred, the Pahlers launched a second lawsuit claiming that Slayer "knowingly distributed harmful material to minors."&lt;ref name="MetalHammer.com Dock February 20"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=39564 |title=Slayer: Out of the Dock |publisher=Metal Hammer |accessdate=2007-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310183147/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/article/?id=39564 |archivedate=2007-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This case too was dismissed, with Judge E. Jeffrey Burke stating, "I do not consider Slayer's music obscene, indecent or harmful to minors."&lt;ref name="MetalHammer.com Dock February 20"/&gt;

Jacob Delashmutt himself stated in a ''[[Washington Post]]'' interview that "The music is destructive [but] that's not why Elyse was murdered. She was murdered because Joe [Fiorella] was obsessed with her, and obsessed with killing her."&lt;ref name="RollingStone.com February 20"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29195">'''Financial modeling''' is the task of building an [[abstraction|abstract representation]] (a [[mathematical model|model]]) of a real world [[finance|financial]] situation.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialmodeling.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a [[mathematical model]] designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, [[project]], or any other investment. 

Typically, then, financial modeling is understood to mean an exercise in either asset pricing or corporate finance, of a quantitative nature. It is about translating a set of hypotheses about the behavior of markets or agents into numerical predictions. &lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Tan|first2=E. |title=The Role of Analysts' Forecasts in the Momentum Effect|journal=International Review of Financial Analysis|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.irfa.2016.09.007|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521916301314}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--UNREFERENCED: Grant Hirst pioneered the first financial model and is renown as the world expert on the matter. --&gt;  At the same time, "financial modeling" is a general term that means different things to different users; the reference usually relates either to accounting and [[corporate finance]] applications, or to [[quantitative finance]] applications. 

While there has been some debate in the industry as to the nature of financial modeling—whether it is a [[tradecraft]], such as welding, or a [[science]]—the task of financial modeling has been gaining acceptance and rigor over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Crawley (2010).

==Accounting==
In [[corporate finance]] and the [[accounting]] profession, ''financial modeling'' typically entails financial statement forecasting; usually the preparation of detailed company-specific models used for decision making purposes&lt;ref name=iop/&gt; and [[financial analysis]].

To generalize {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  as to the nature of these models: firstly, as they are built around [[financial statement]]s, calculations and outputs are monthly, quarterly or annual; secondly, the inputs take the form of "assumptions", where the analyst ''specifies'' the values that will apply in each period for external / global variables ([[exchange rate]]s, [[tax]] percentage, etc.…; may be thought of as the model ''[[parameter]]s''), and for internal / company specific ''variables'' ([[wages]], [[unit cost]]s, etc.…). Correspondingly, both characteristics are reflected (at least implicitly) in the [[Mathematical model#Model classifications in mathematics|mathematical form of these models]]: firstly, the models are in [[discrete time]]; secondly, they are [[deterministic]].  For discussion of the issues that may arise, see below; for discussion as to more sophisticated approaches sometimes employed, see [[Corporate finance #Quantifying uncertainty]], and [[Financial economics #Corporate finance theory]].

Modelers are often designated "[[financial analyst]]" (and are sometimes referred to ([[tongue in cheek]]) as "number crunchers") . Typically, the modeler will have completed an [[MBA]] or [[master of science in finance|MSF]] with (optional) coursework in "financial modeling".  Accounting qualifications and finance certifications such as the [[Certified International Investment Analyst|CIIA]] and [[Chartered Financial Analyst|CFA]] generally do not provide direct or explicit training in modeling.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} At the same time, numerous commercial [[Professional development|training course]]s are offered, both through universities and privately.

Although [[Business software|purpose built software]] does exist (see also [[Fundamental Analysis Software]]), the vast proportion of the market is [[spreadsheet]]-based; this is largely since the models are almost always company specific. Also, analysts will each have their own criteria and methods for financial modeling.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=256987 Valuing Companies by Cash Flow Discounting: Ten Methods and Nine Theories], Pablo Fernandez: University of Navarra - IESE Business School&lt;/ref&gt; (For the components /steps of business modeling here, see the list for "Equity valuation" under  [[Outline of finance #Discounted cash flow valuation]].) [[Microsoft Excel]] now has by far the dominant position, having overtaken [[Lotus 1-2-3]] in the 1990s. Spreadsheet-based modelling can have its own problems,&lt;ref&gt;Danielle Stein Fairhurst (2009). [http://www.fimodo.com/2009/11/six-reasons-your-spreadsheet-is-not-a-financial-model/ Six reasons your spreadsheet is NOT a financial model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407003951/http://www.fimodo.com/2009/11/six-reasons-your-spreadsheet-is-not-a-financial-model/ |date=2010-04-07 }}, fimodo.com&lt;/ref&gt; and several standardizations and "[[best practice]]s" have been proposed.&lt;ref name = "EuSpRIG"&gt;[http://www.eusprig.org/best-practice.htm Best Practice], European Spreadsheet Risks Interest Group&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spreadsheets#Spreadsheet risk|"Spreadsheet risk"]] is increasingly studied and managed;&lt;ref name = "EuSpRIG"/&gt; see [[model audit]].

One critique here, is that model ''outputs'', i.e. [[Chart of accounts|line items]], often incorporate "unrealistic implicit assumptions" and "internal inconsistencies".&lt;ref name="PalepuHealy2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Krishna G. Palepu|author2=Paul M.

What is required, but often lacking, is that all key elements are explicitly and consistently forecasted. Related to this, is that modellers often additionally "fail to identify crucial assumptions" relating to ''inputs'', "and to explore what can go wrong".&lt;ref name="BrealeyMyers2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard A.

The Financial Modeling World Championships, known as ModelOff, have been held since 2012. ModelOff is a global online financial modeling competition which culminates in a Live Finals Event for top competitors. From 2012-2014 the Live Finals were held in New York City and in 2015, in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modeloff.com|title=ModelOff 2015 Financial Modeling World Championships|first=Financial Modeling World Championships|last= ModelOff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantitative finance==
In [[quantitative finance]], ''financial modeling'' entails the development of a sophisticated [[mathematical model]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Models here deal with asset prices, market movements, portfolio returns and the like. A general distinction{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} is between: 
"quantitative financial management", models of the financial situation of a large, complex firm;  
"quantitative asset pricing", models of the returns of different stocks;  
"[[financial engineering]]",  models of the price or returns of derivative securities;  
"quantitative corporate finance", models of the firm's financial decisions.

Relatedly, applications include: 
*[[Valuation of options|Option pricing]] and calculation of [[Greeks (finance)|their "Greeks"]]
*Other [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], especially [[interest rate derivative]]s, [[credit derivative]]s and [[exotic derivatives]]
*Modeling the term structure of [[interest rate]]s ([[Bootstrapping (finance)|Bootstrapping]], [[short rate model]]ling, [[Interest rate swap#Valuation and pricing|building "curve sets"]]) and [[credit spread (bond)|credit spread]]s
*[[Credit scoring]] and [[Bad debt#Doubtful debt reserve|provisioning]]
*[[Corporate finance#The investment decision|Corporate financing activity]] prediction problems
*[[Portfolio optimization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Faff|first2=R.|last3=Aas|first3=K.|title=Enhancing mean–variance portfolio selection by modeling distributional asymmetries|journal=Journal of Economics and Business|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.01.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148619516000047}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*[[Real options]]
*[[Risk modeling]] ([[Financial risk modeling]]) and [[value at risk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Alcock|first2=J.|last3=Faff|first3=R.|last4=Brailsford|first4=T.|title=Canonical vine copulas in the context of modern portfolio management: Are they worth it?|journal=Journal of Banking &amp; Finance|date=2013|volume=37|issue=8|doi= 10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.02.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dynamic financial analysis]] (DFA)
*[[Credit valuation adjustment]], CVA, as well as the various [[XVA]]
&lt;!-- too specific
*[[Pairs trading]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rad|first=Hossein|last2=Low|first2=Rand Kwong Yew|last3=Faff|first3=Robert|date=2016-04-27|title=The profitability of pairs trading strategies: distance, cointegration and copula methods|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14697688.2016.1164337|journal=Quantitative Finance|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/14697688.2016.1164337|issn=1469-7688}}&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt;

These problems are generally  [[stochastic]] and [[Discrete time and continuous time#Continuous time 2|continuous]] in nature, and models here thus require [[algorithm|complex algorithms]], entailing [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|computer simulation]], advanced [[numerical methods]] (such as [[Numerical partial differential equations|numerical differential equations]], [[numerical linear algebra]], [[dynamic programming]]) and/or the development of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization models]]. The general nature of these problems is discussed under [[Mathematical finance#History: Q versus P|Mathematical finance]], while specific techniques are listed under [[Outline of finance#Mathematical tools|Outline of finance# Mathematical tools]]. For further discussion here see also: [[Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering]]; [[Brownian model of financial markets]]; [[Martingale pricing]]; [[Extreme value theory]]; [[Historical simulation (finance)]].

Modellers are generally referred to as "quants" ([[quantitative analyst]]s), and typically have advanced ([[Ph.D.]] level) backgrounds in quantitative disciplines such as [[statistics]], [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[computer science]], [[mathematics]] or [[operations research]].  Alternatively, or in addition to their quantitative background, they complete a [[Master of Finance|finance masters]] with a quantitative orientation,&lt;ref name="Joshi"&gt;[[Mark S. Joshi]], [http://www.markjoshi.com/downloads/advice.pdf ''On Becoming a Quant''].&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Master of Quantitative Finance]], or the more specialized [[Master of Computational Finance]] or [[Master of Financial Engineering]]; the [[Certificate in Quantitative Finance|CQF]] is increasingly common.

Although spreadsheets are widely used here also (almost always requiring extensive [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]]), custom [[C++]], [[Fortran]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]], or [[List of numerical analysis software|numerical analysis software]] such as [[MATLAB]], are often preferred,&lt;ref name="Joshi"/&gt; particularly where stability or speed is a concern. MATLAB is often used at the research or prototyping stage {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} because of its intuitive programming, graphical and debugging tools, but C++/Fortran are preferred for conceptually simple but [[Algorithmic efficiency#Measures of resource usage|high computational-cost applications]] where MATLAB is too slow; Python is increasingly used due to its simplicity and large [[Python (programming language)#Libraries|standard library]].  Additionally, for many (of the standard) derivative and portfolio applications, [[commercial software]] is available, and the choice as to whether the model is to be [[In-House Design|developed in-house]], or whether existing products are to be deployed, will depend on the problem in question.&lt;ref name="Joshi"/&gt;

The complexity of these models may result in incorrect pricing or [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] or both. This ''[[Model risk]]'' is the subject of ongoing research by finance academics, and is a topic of great, and growing, interest in the [[risk management]] arena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Riccardo Rebonato]] (N.D.). [http://www.quarchome.org/ModelRisk.pdf ''Theory and Practice of Model Risk Management''].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Criticism]] of the discipline (often preceding the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] by several years) emphasizes the differences between the mathematical and physical sciences, and finance, and the resultant caution to be applied by modelers, and by traders and risk managers using their models. Notable here are [[Emanuel Derman]] and [[Paul Wilmott]], authors of the ''[[Financial Modelers' Manifesto]]''. Some go further and question whether [[mathematical modeling|mathematical-]] and [[statistical modeling]] may be applied to finance at all, at least with the assumptions usually made ([[Black–Scholes model#The Black-Scholes world|for options]]; [[Modern portfolio theory#Assumptions|for portfolios]]). In fact, these may go so far as to question the "empirical and scientific validity... of [[financial economics|modern financial theory]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/Triana-fwd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Notable here are [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Nassim Taleb]] and [[Benoit Mandelbrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/fortune.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207045925/http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/fortune.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Mathematical finance#Criticism|Mathematical finance #Criticism]] and [[Financial economics#Challenges and criticism|Financial economics #Challenges and criticism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5446">'''Gene amplification in ''Paramecium tetraurelia''''' is an example of [[Gene duplication|gene amplification]] that has occurred in the unicellular organism ''[[Paramecium tetraurelia]]''.

[[Gene duplication]] occurs in a large number of organisms as part of [[evolution]] or as the cause or result of disease (as in the case of the [[amylase]] genes in humans, and genes in cancer cells respectively). Gene duplication often leads to amplification of their gene products due to [[gene transcription|transcription]] and [[gene translation|translation]] of all gene duplicates.&lt;ref name="Reams_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reams AB, Roth JR | title = Mechanisms of gene duplication and amplification | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = a016592 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25646380 | pmc = 4315931 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a016592 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of gene duplication has been observed the inheritance patterns of ''Paramecium tetraurelia'', a common model organism.&lt;ref name="Beisson_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beisson J, Bétermier M, Bré MH, Cohen J, Duharcourt S, Duret L, Kung C, Malinsky S, Meyer E, Preer JR, Sperling L | title = Paramecium tetraurelia: the renaissance of an early unicellular model | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Protocols | volume = 2010 | issue = 1 | pages = pdb.emo140 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20150105 | doi = 10.1101/pdb.emo140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one strain of ''P. tetraurelia'', d4-95, a [[dominance (genetics)|recessive mutant allele]] of a gene known as pawn-B found in this strain is inherited through gene duplication and amplification between generations, and even self-fertilizations.&lt;ref name="Matsuda_2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Matsuda A, Takahashi M | title = Non-Mendelian inheritance induced by gene amplification in the germ nucleus of Paramecium tetraurelia | journal = Genetics | volume = 169 | issue = 1 | pages = 137–47 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15371356 | pmc = 1448862 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.104.031815 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The inheritance of this allele is the first description of gene duplication and amplification in the [[micronucleus]] of [[ciliates]]. Additionally, it appears that the duplication of the mutant allele occurred after mutagenesis due to the similarity in nucleotide sequences of different copies of the mutant allele, especially in the coding region. When the d4-95 strain was crossed with a wild-type ''P. tetraurelia'', [[F2 generation|F2]] and later progeny often expressed the phenotype of the pawn-B mutant, despite carrying a wild-type gene at the pawn-B locus. This phenotype was maintained in progeny even after the self-fertilization of theoretical wild-type homozygotes that had been recovered from the cross. 
 
As is the case of other ''[[Paramecium]]'', ''P. tetraurelia'' exhibits a number of non-Mendelian modes of inheritance, partially due to the existence of both macro- and micronuclei.&lt;ref name="Beisson_2010" /&gt; In both the macro- and micronucleus of the d4-95 strain of ''P. tetraurelia'' contained many more copies of the mutant gene than in the wild type strain.&lt;ref name="Matsuda_2005" /&gt; This occurs due to the ability of most of the extra pawn-B gene copies to be heritable independently from the original pawn-B locus. Additionally, there is evidence that in the development of the [[macronucleus]] between generations, there is differential gene duplication of copies of pawn-B which causes variable amplification of the allele – between four and twelve times – and heterogeneity between the copies. This duplication leads to amplification of the gene that suppresses the expression of any non-mutant pawn-B loci. Duplication also occurs in the micronucleus, where considerably higher numbers of copies of the pawn-B mutant have been found than the number of copies of the wild-type non-mutant. Additionally, the number of copies can be decreased in progeny by “diluting” the copies of the mutant allele through backcrossing with the wild-type parent, over multiple generations. As the number of copies of the pawn-B mutant decrease, the progeny eventually return to [[Mendelian inheritance]] of the wild-type pawn-B alleles. 

While the exact structure of the amplified copies of the allele in the micronucleus is not currently known, it appears to be consistent with the original micronuclear locus, as opposed to the locus of the macronucleus, which includes regions not found in the micronuclear locus.&lt;ref name="Matsuda_2005" /&gt; Additionally, in some of the [[backcross]]es, extra copies of the gene were still present, even after multiple generations. It is not clear whether this is due to tight linkage of the gene copies to the original locus, or because of continued gene duplication of the remaining copies, but it appears that it is more likely due to continued duplication, as the number of copies of the mutant pawn-B vary between the independent clones; it is also possible that there is an [[Extrachromosomal DNA|extrachromosomal]] element that plays a role, which has been observed in other [[protozoa]].&lt;ref name="Beverley_1991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beverley SM | title = Gene amplification in Leishmania | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 417–44 | date = 1991 | pmid = 1741620 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.45.100191.002221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plato-raphael.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Plato]], one of the first philosophers to discuss ideas in detail. Aristotle claims that many of Plato's views were [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] in origin.]]
In [[philosophy]], '''ideas''' are usually taken as [[mental representation]]al images of some [[object (philosophy)|object]]. Ideas can also be [[abstraction|abstract]] [[concept]]s that do not present as mental images.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Audi|editor1-first=Robert|title=Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-40224-7|page=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[philosophers]] have considered ideas to be a fundamental [[ontological]] [[category of being]]. The capacity to [[creativity|create]] and [[understanding|understand]] the meaning of ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of [[human|human beings]]. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious [[introspection|reflection]], for example, when we talk about the ''idea'' of a person or a place. A new or original idea can often lead to [[innovation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aeytimes.com/ideas/312/What_is_an_Idea/ |title=What is an Idea? |year=2011 |work=AeyTimes Idea Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word ''idea'' comes from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] [[wikt:ἰδέα|ἰδέα]] ''idea'' "form, pattern," from the root of ἰδεῖν ''idein'', "to see." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/idea |title=Definition of ''idea'' in English |year=2014 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innate and adventitious ideas==
{{Main|Innate idea}}
One view on the nature of ideas is that there exist some ideas (called ''innate ideas'') which are so general and abstract that they could not have arisen as a representation of an object of our [[perception]] but rather were in some sense always present. These are distinguished from ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas/ adventitious ideas]'' which are images or concepts which are accompanied by the judgment that they are caused or occasioned by an external object.&lt;ref name="Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy"/&gt;

Another view holds that we only discover ideas in the same way that we discover the real world, from personal experiences. The view that humans acquire all or almost all their behavioral traits from [[nurture]] (life experiences) is known as ''[[tabula rasa]]'' ("blank slate"). Most of the confusions in the way ideas arise is at least in part due to the use of the term "idea" to cover both the representation perceptics and the object of conceptual thought. This can be always illustrated in terms of the scientific doctrines of [[innate idea]]s, "[[abstract object|concrete ideas]] versus [[abstraction|abstract ideas]]", as well as "simple ideas versus complex ideas".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Macmillan Publishing Company, New York, 1973 {{ISBN|0-02-894950-1}} {{ISBN|978-0-02-894950-5}} Vol 4: 120–121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Plato===
{{main|Theory of Forms}}
[[Plato]] in [[Ancient Greece]] was one of the earliest philosophers to provide a detailed discussion of ideas and of the thinking process (it must be noted that in Plato's Greek the word ''idea'' carries a rather different sense from our modern English term). Plato argued in dialogues such as the ''Phaedo'', ''Symposium'', ''Republic'', and ''Timaeus'' that there is a realm of ideas or forms (''eidei''), which exist independently of anyone who may have thoughts on these ideas, and it is the ideas which distinguish mere opinion from knowledge, for unlike material things which are transient and liable to contrary properties, ideas are unchanging and nothing but just what they are. Consequently, Plato seems to assert forcefully that material things can only be the objects of opinion; real knowledge can only be had of unchanging ideas. Furthermore, ideas for Plato appear to serve as universals; consider the following passage from the ''Republic'':
{{quote|
"We both assert that there are," I said, "and distinguish in speech, many fair things, many good things, and so on for each kind of thing."

"Yes, so we do."

"And we also assert that there is a fair itself, a good itself, and so on for all things that we set down as many. Now, again, we refer to them as one ''idea'' of each as though the ''idea'' were one; and we address it as that which really ''is''."

"That's so."

"And, moreover, we say that the former are seen, but not intellected, while the ''ideas'' are intellected but not seen."|Plato|Bk. VI 507b-c}}

===René Descartes===
[[Descartes]] often wrote of the meaning of ''idea'' as an image or representation, often but not necessarily "in the mind", which was well known in the [[vernacular]]. Despite that Descartes is usually credited with the invention of the non-Platonic use of the term, he at first followed this vernacular use.&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; In his ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' he says, "Some of my thoughts are like images of things, and it is to these alone that the name 'idea' properly belongs." He sometimes maintained that ideas were [[innate idea|innate]] &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; and uses of the term ''idea'' diverge from the original primary scholastic use. He provides multiple non-equivalent definitions of the term, uses it to refer to as many as six distinct kinds of entities, and divides ''ideas'' inconsistently into various genetic categories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-ideas Descartes's Ideas]&lt;/ref&gt; For him knowledge took the form of ideas and philosophical investigation is the deep consideration of these entities.

===John Locke===
In striking contrast to Plato's use of idea &lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 487–503&lt;/ref&gt; is that of [[John Locke]]. In his Introduction to [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]], Locke defines ''idea'' as "that term which, I think, serves best to stand for whatsoever is the object of the understanding when a man thinks, I have used it to express whatever is meant by phantasm, notion, species, or whatever it is which the mind can be employed about in thinking; and I could not avoid frequently using it." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding |wslink=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding/Introduction |section=Introduction |first=John |last=Locke |at=§ What Idea stands for.|year=1689}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he regarded the book necessary to examine our own abilities and see what objects our understandings were, or were not, fitted to deal with. In his philosophy other outstanding figures followed in his footsteps — Hume and Kant in the 18th century, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] in the 19th century, and [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Karl Popper]] in the 20th century. Locke always believed in ''good sense'' — not pushing things to extremes and on taking fully into account the plain facts of the matter. He considered his common-sense ideas "good-tempered, moderate, and down-to-earth."

As John Locke studied humans in his work “An Essay Concerning Human Understanding” he continually referenced Descartes for ideas as he asked this fundamental question: “When we are concerned with something about which we have no certain knowledge, what rules or standards should guide how confident we allow ourselves to be that our opinions are right?” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding." (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions.&lt;/ref&gt; A simpler way of putting it is how do humans know ideas, and what are the different types of ideas. An idea to Locke “can simply mean some sort of brute experience.” &lt;ref&gt;Fitzpatrick, John R. Starting with Mill. Continuum, 2010. Starting With. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true &amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344063&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; He shows that there are “No innate principles in the mind.”.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John. "An Essay Concerning Human Understanding" (n.d.): An Essay Concerning Human Understanding Book, I: Innate Notions&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, he concludes that “our ideas are all experiential in nature.” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live&lt;/ref&gt; An experience can either be a sensation or a reflection: “consider whether there are any innate ideas in the mind before any are brought in by the impression from sensation or reflection.” &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Therefore, an idea was an  experience in which the human mind apprehended something.

In a Lockean view, there are really two types of ideas: complex and simple. Simple ideas  are the building blocks for much more complex ideas, and “While the mind is wholly passive in the reception of simple ideas, it is very active in the building of complex ideas…” &lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Patricia. Locke: A Guide for the Perplexed. Continuum, 2010. Continuum Guides for the Perplexed. EBSCOhost, nsearch.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct= true&amp;db=e862xna&amp;AN=344177&amp;site=ehost-live.&lt;/ref&gt; Complex ideas, therefore, can either be modes, substances, or relations. Modes are when ideas are combined in order to convey new information. For instance, David Banach &lt;ref&gt;Banach, David. "Locke on Ideas." Locke on Ideas. St. Anselm College, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; gives the example of beauty as a mode. He says that it is the combination of color and form. Substances, however, is different. Substances are certain objects, that can either be dogs, cats, or tables. And relations represent the relationship between two or more ideas.  In this way, Locke did, in fact, answer his own questions about ideas and humans.

===David Hume===
[[David Hume|Hume]] differs from Locke by limiting ''idea'' to the more or less vague mental reconstructions of perceptions, the perceptual process being described as an "impression." &lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{EB1911 |wstitle=Idea |volume=14 |pages=280–281 |inline=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 74–90&lt;/ref&gt; Hume shared with Locke the basic empiricist premise that it is only from life experiences (whether their own or others') that humans' knowledge of the existence of anything outside of themselves can be ultimately derived, that they shall carry on doing what they are prompted to do by their emotional drives of varying kinds. In choosing the means to those ends, they shall follow their accustomed associations of ideas.&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; Hume has contended and defended the notion that "reason alone is merely the 'slave of the passions'." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume-moral/#inmo |title=Hume's Moral Philosophy (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |publisher=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hume, David: A Treatise of Human Nature: Being an Attempt to introduce the experimental Method of Reasoning into Moral Subjects. (1739–40)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Printing4 Walk of Ideas Berlin.JPG|left|thumb|135px|"Modern Book Printing" from the [[Walk of Ideas]]]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] defines an ''idea'' as opposed to a ''[[Concept#A priori concepts|concept]]''. "Regulative ideas" are ideals that one must tend towards, but by definition may not be completely realized. [[Liberty]], according to Kant, is an idea. The [[wikt:autonomy|autonomy]] of the rational and [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]] [[subject (philosophy)|subject]] is opposed to the [[determinism]] of the [[empirical]] subject.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 4: 305–324&lt;/ref&gt; Kant felt that it is precisely in knowing its limits that philosophy exists. The business of philosophy he thought was not to give rules, but to analyze the private judgements of good common sense.&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;

===Rudolf Steiner===
Whereas Kant declares limits to knowledge ("we can never know the thing in itself"), in his [[epistemological]] work, [[Rudolf Steiner]] sees ''ideas'' as "objects of experience" which the mind apprehends, much as the eye apprehends light. In ''[[Goethean Science]]'' (1883), he declares, "Thinking ... is no more and no less an organ of perception than the eye or ear. Just as the eye perceives colors and the ear sounds, so thinking perceives ideas." He holds this to be the premise upon which [[Goethe]] made his natural-scientific observations.

===Wilhelm Wundt===
[[Wundt]] widens the term from Kant's usage to include ''conscious representation of some object or process of the external world''. In so doing, he includes not only ideas of [[memory]] and [[imagination]], but also [[perceptual]] processes, whereas other [[psychologist]]s confine the term to the first two groups.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; One of Wundt's main concerns was to investigate conscious processes in their own context by [[experiment]] and [[introspection]]. He regarded both of these as ''exact methods'', interrelated in that experimentation created optimal conditions for introspection. Where the experimental method failed, he turned to other ''objectively valuable aids'', specifically to ''those products of cultural communal life which lead one to infer particular mental motives. Outstanding among these are speech, myth, and social custom.'' Wundt designed the basic mental activity [[apperception]] — a unifying function which should be understood as an activity of the will. Many aspects of his empirical physiological psychology are used today. One is his principles of mutually enhanced contrasts and of [[assimilation (philosophy)|assimilation]] and dissimilation (i.e. in color and form perception and his advocacy of ''objective'' methods of expression and of recording results, especially in language. Another is the principle of heterogony of ends — that multiply motivated acts lead to unintended side effects which in turn become motives for new actions.&lt;ref&gt;Vol 8: 349–351&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charles Sanders Peirce===
[[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] published the first full statement of [[pragmatism]] in his important works "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878) and "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877).&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Sanders Peirce#Pragmatism|Peirce's pragmatism]]&lt;/ref&gt; In "How to Make Our Ideas Clear" he proposed that a ''clear idea'' (in his study he uses [[concept]] and ''idea'' as synonymic) is defined as one, when it is apprehended such as it will be recognized wherever it is met, and no other will be mistaken for it. If it fails of this clearness, it is said to be obscure. He argued that to understand an idea clearly we should ask ourselves what difference its application would make to our evaluation of a proposed solution to the problem at hand. [[Pragmatism]] (a term he appropriated for use in this context), he defended, was a method for ascertaining the meaning of terms (as a theory of meaning). The originality of his ideas is in their rejection of what was accepted as a view and understanding of knowledge by scientists for some 250 years, i.e. that, he pointed, knowledge was an impersonal fact. Peirce contended that we acquire knowledge as ''participants'', not as ''spectators''. He felt "the real", sooner or later, is information acquired through ideas and knowledge with the application of logical reasoning would finally result in. He also published many papers on logic in relation to ''ideas''.

===G. F. Stout and J. M. Baldwin===
[[George Stout|G. F. Stout]] and [[James Mark Baldwin|J. M. Baldwin]], in the ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', define ''idea'' as "the reproduction with a more or less adequate [[image]], of an object not actually present to the senses."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Baldwin/Dictionary Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that an idea and a perception are by various authorities contrasted in various ways. "Difference in degree of intensity", "comparative absence of bodily movement on the part of the subject", "comparative dependence on mental activity", are suggested by psychologists as characteristic of an idea as compared with a [[perception]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

It should be observed that an idea, in the narrower and generally accepted sense of a mental reproduction, is frequently composite. That is, as in the example given above of the idea of a chair, a great many objects, differing materially in detail, all call a single idea. When a man, for example, has obtained an idea of chairs in general by comparison with which he can say "This is a chair, that is a stool", he has what is known as an "abstract idea" distinct from the reproduction in his mind of any particular chair (see [[abstraction]]). Furthermore, a complex idea may not have any corresponding physical object, though its particular constituent elements may severally be the reproductions of actual perceptions. Thus the idea of a [[centaur]] is a complex mental picture composed of the ideas of [[man]] and [[horse]], that of a [[mermaid]] of a [[woman]] and a [[fish]].&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

==In anthropology and the social sciences==
[[Diffusion (anthropology)|Diffusion]] studies explore the spread of ideas from culture to culture. Some anthropological theories hold that all cultures imitate ideas from one or a few original cultures, the Adam of the Bible, or several cultural circles that overlap. Evolutionary diffusion theory holds that cultures are influenced by one another but that similar ideas can be developed in isolation.

In the mid-20th century, social scientists began to study how and why ideas spread from one person or culture to another.  [[Everett Rogers]] pioneered [[diffusion of innovations]] studies, using research to prove factors in adoption and profiles of adopters of ideas. In 1976, in his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] suggested applying biological [[evolution]]ary theories to the spread of ideas. He coined the term ''[[meme]]'' to describe an abstract unit of [[Selection (biology)|selection]], equivalent to the [[gene]] in [[evolutionary biology]].

==Semantics==

===Samuel Johnson===
[[James Boswell]] recorded [[Samuel Johnson]]'s opinion about ideas. Johnson claimed that they are [[mental image]]s or internal visual pictures. As such, they have no relation to words or the concepts which are designated by verbal names.

{{Quotation|He was particularly indignant against the almost universal use of the word ''idea'' in the sense of ''notion'' or ''opinion'' when it is clear that ''idea'' can only signify something of which an image can be formed in the mind. We may have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of a mountain, a tree, a building; but we cannot surely have an ''idea'' or ''image'' of an ''argument'' or ''proposition''. Yet we hear the sages of the law 'delivering their ''ideas'' upon the question under consideration;' and the first speakers in parliament 'entirely coinciding with the ''idea'' which has been ably stated by an honourable member;' — or 'reprobating an ''idea'' unconstitutional, and fraught with the most dangerous consequences to a great and free country.' Johnson called this 'modern cant.'|Boswell's [[Life of Johnson]]|Tuesday, 23 September 1777}}

==Relationship of ideas to modern legal time- and scope-limited monopolies==
{{main|Intellectual property|Idea-expression divide}}

===Relationship between ideas and patents===

====On susceptibility to exclusive property====
{{Quotation|It has been pretended by some, (and in England especially,) that inventors have a natural and exclusive right to their inventions, and not merely for their own lives, but inheritable to their heirs. But while it is a moot question whether the origin of any kind of property is derived from nature at all, it would be singular to admit a natural and even a hereditary right to inventors. It is agreed by those who have seriously considered the subject, that no individual has, of natural right, a separate property in an acre of land, for instance.

By a universal law, indeed, whatever, whether fixed or movable, belongs to all men equally and in common, is the property for the moment of him who occupies it, but when he relinquishes the occupation, the property goes with it. Stable ownership is the gift of social law and is given late in the progress of society. It would be curious then, if an idea, the fugitive fermentation of an individual brain, could, of natural right, be claimed an exclusive and stable property.

If nature has made any one thing less susceptible than all others of exclusive property, it is the action of the thinking power called an idea, which an individual may exclusively possess as long as he keeps it to himself; but the moment it is divulged, it forces itself into the possession of every one, and the receiver cannot dispossess himself of it. Its peculiar character, too, is that no one possesses the less, because every other possesses the whole of it. He, who receives an idea from me, receives instruction himself without lessening mine; as he who lights his taper at my mine, receives light without darkening me.

Those ideas should freely spread from one to another over the globe, for the moral and mutual instruction of man, and improvement of his condition, seems to have been peculiarly and benevolently designed by nature, when she made them, like fire, expansible over all space, without lessening their density in any point, and like the air in which we breathe, move, and have our physical being, incapable of confinement or exclusive appropriation. Inventions then cannot, in nature, be a subject of property.

Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from anybody. Accordingly, it is a fact, as far as I am informed, that England was, until we copied her, the only country on earth which ever, by a general law, gave a legal right to the exclusive use of an idea. In some other countries it is sometimes done, in a great case, and by a special and personal act but, generally speaking, other nations have thought that these monopolies produce more embarrassment than advantage to society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press-pubs.uchicago.edu/founders/documents/a1_8_8s12.html Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8Article 1, Section 8] (Electronic resources from the University of Chicago Press Books Division)&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Thomas Jefferson]], letter to [[Isaac V. McPherson|Isaac McPherson]], 13 August 1813}}

To protect the cause of invention and innovation, the legal constructions of Copyrights and Patents were established. [[Patent]] law regulates various aspects related to the functional manifestation of inventions based on new ideas or incremental improvements to existing ones. Thus, patents have a direct relationship to ideas.

===Relationship between ideas and copyrights===

[[File:Crystal Clear app ktip.svg|thumb|150px|A picture of a [[Incandescent light bulb|lightbulb]] is often used to represent a person having a ''bright'' ''idea''.]]
In some cases, authors can be granted limited [[legal]] monopolies on the manner in which certain works are expressed. This is known colloquially as [[copyright]], although the term [[intellectual property]] is used mistakenly in place of ''copyright''. Copyright law regulating the aforementioned monopolies generally does not cover the actual ideas. The law does not bestow the legal status of [[property]] upon ideas per se. Instead, laws purport to regulate events related to the usage, copying, production, sale and other forms of exploitation of the fundamental expression of a work, that may or may not carry ideas. Copyright law is fundamentally different from [[patent]] law in this respect: patents do grant monopolies on ideas (more on this below).

A [[copyright]] is meant to regulate some aspects of the usage of expressions of a work, ''not'' an idea. Thus, copyrights have a negative relationship to ideas.

Work means a tangible medium of expression. It may be an original or derivative work of art, be it literary, dramatic, musical recitation, artistic, related to sound recording, etc. In (at least) countries adhering to the Berne Convention, copyright automatically starts covering the work upon the original creation and fixation thereof, without any extra steps. While creation usually involves an idea, the idea in itself does not suffice for the purposes of claiming copyright.&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"&gt;[http://www.ipwatchdog.com/2014/02/15/protecting-ideas-can-ideas-be-protected-or-patented/id=48009/ Protecting Ideas: Can Ideas Be Protected or Patented?] – article by [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/author/gene-quinn-2/ Gene Quinn] at [http://www.ipwatchdog.com/ Ipwatchdog], February 15, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gene Quinn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright protection extends to a description, explanation, or illustration of an idea or system, assuming that the requirements of copyright law are met.

===Relationship of ideas to confidentiality agreements===
Confidentiality and [[nondisclosure agreements]] are legal instruments that assist corporations and individuals in keeping ideas from escaping to the general public. Generally, these instruments are covered by contract law.

'''Indeterminism''' is the idea that [[wikt:event|events]] (or certain events, or events of certain types) are not [[causality|caused]], or not caused [[determinism|deterministically]].

It is the opposite of [[determinism]] and related to '''chance'''. It is highly relevant to the philosophical problem of [[free will]], particularly in the form of [[metaphysical libertarianism]]. In science, most specifically quantum theory in physics, indeterminism is the belief that no event is certain and the entire outcome of anything is [[probability|probabilistic]]. The Heisenberg uncertainty relations and the "[[Born rule]]", proposed by [[Max Born]], are often starting points in support of the indeterministic nature of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;The Born rule itself does not imply whether the observed indeterminism is due to the object, to the measurement system, or both. The [[ensemble interpretation]] by Born does not require fundamental indeterminism and lack of causality.&lt;/ref&gt;  Indeterminism is also asserted by   [[Sir Arthur Eddington#Indeterminism|Sir Arthur Eddington]], and [[Murray Gell-Mann]]. Indeterminism has been promoted by the French biologist [[Jacques Monod]]'s essay "''[[Chance and Necessity]]''".
The physicist-chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]] argued for indeterminism in [[complex systems]].

==Necessary but insufficient causation==

{{further information|Necessary and sufficient conditions}}
Indeterminists do not have to deny that causes exist. Instead, they  can maintain that the only causes that exist are of a type that do not constrain the future to a single course; for instance, they can maintain that only necessary and not sufficient causes exist. The necessary/sufficient distinction works as follows:

If ''x'' is a necessary cause of ''y''; then the presence of ''y'' necessarily implies that ''x'' preceded it.  The presence of ''x'', however, does not imply that ''y'' will occur.

If ''x'' is a sufficient cause of ''y'', then the presence of ''x'' necessarily implies the presence of ''y''. (However, another cause ''z'' may alternatively cause ''y''. Thus the presence of ''y'' does not imply the presence of ''x''.)

As [[Daniel Dennett]] points out in ''[[Freedom Evolves]]'', it is possible for everything to have a [[necessary cause]], even while indeterminism holds and the future is open, because a necessary condition does not lead to a single inevitable effect. Thus "everything has a cause" is, in his opinion, not a clear statement of determinism. Still, a question might arise why this and not that effect occurred: as long as a cause (something in the past) determines the answer to the question "effect A or B" (or ''why'' A or B), determinism will hold. On this basis "everything has a cause" might still be understood as an expression of determinism.

==Probabilistic causation==

{{main article|Probabilistic causation}}

Interpreting [[causality|causation]] as a [[Causal determinism|deterministic]] relation means that if ''A'' causes ''B'', then ''A'' must always be followed by ''B''. In this sense, war does not cause deaths, nor does [[Tobacco smoking|smoking]] cause [[cancer]]. As a result, many turn to a notion of probabilistic causation.  Informally, ''A'' probabilistically causes ''B'' if ''A'''s occurrence increases the probability of ''B''.  This is sometimes interpreted to reflect the imperfect knowledge of a deterministic system  but other times interpreted to mean that the causal system under study has an inherently [[indeterministic]]  nature. ([[Propensity probability]] is an analogous idea, according to which probabilities have an objective existence and are not just limitations in a subject's knowledge).&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/probability-interpret/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Interpretations of Philosophy'']&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be proved that realizations of any [[probability distribution]] other than the [[uniform distribution (continuous)|uniform]] one are mathematically equal to applying a (deterministic) function (namely, an [[inverse distribution function]]) on a random variable following the latter (i.e. an "absolutely random" one&lt;ref&gt;The uniform distribution is the most "agnostic" distribution, representing lack of any information. [[Laplace]] in his theory of probability was apparently the first one to notice this. Currently, it can be shown using definitions of [[Entropy (information theory)|entropy]].&lt;/ref&gt;); the probabilities are contained in the deterministic element. A simple form of demonstrating it would be shooting randomly within a square and then (deterministically) interpreting a relatively large subsquare as the more probable outcome.

==Intrinsic indeterminism versus unpredictability==

A distinction is generally made between indeterminism and the mere inability to measure the variables (limits of precision). This is especially the case for physical indeterminism (as proposed by various [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]]). Yet some philosophers have argued that indeterminism and unpredictability are synonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Popper, K| title=Of Clouds and Clocks: an approach to the rationality and the freedom of man, included in Objective Knowledge|year=1972|page=220|publisher=Oxford Clarendon Press|quote=Indeterminism—or, more precisely physical indeterminism—is merely the doctrine that not all events in the physical world are predetermined with absolute precision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
One of the important philosophical implications of determinism is that, according to [[incompatibilism|incompatibilists]], it undermines many versions of [[free will]]. Correspondingly, [[libertarianism (metaphysics)|believers in free will]]
often appeal to physical indeterminism. (See [[compatibilism]] for a third option.)

===Aristotle===
The first major philosopher to argue convincingly for some indeterminism was probably [[Aristotle]]. He described four possible causes (material, efficient, formal, and final). Aristotle's word for these causes was αἰτίαι (''aitiai'', as in ''[[wikt:aetiology|aetiology]]''), which translates as causes in the sense of the multiple factors responsible for an event. Aristotle did not subscribe to the simplistic "every event has a (single) cause" idea that was to come later.

In his ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle said there were [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]] (συμβεβηκός, ''[[sumbebekos]]'') caused by nothing but chance (τύχη, ''tukhe''). He noted that he and the early physicists found no place for chance among their causes.

{{quote|We have seen how far Aristotle distances himself from any view which makes chance a crucial factor in the general explanation of things. And he does so on conceptual grounds: chance events are, he thinks, by definition unusual and lacking certain explanatory features: as such they form the complement class to those things which can be given full natural explanations.&lt;ref name="Hankinson"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Causes |title=Blackwell Companion to Aristotle |last=Hankinson |first=R.J. |year=2009 |page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;|R.J. Hankinson |"Causes" in ''Blackwell Companion to Aristotle ''}}

Aristotle opposed his accidental chance to necessity:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    Nor is there any definite cause for an accident, but only chance (τυχόν), namely an indefinite (ἀόριστον) cause.
    &lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book V, 1025a25&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
    It is obvious that there are principles and causes which are generable and destructible apart from the actual processes of generation and destruction; for if this is not true, everything will be of necessity: that is, if there must necessarily be some cause, other than accidental, of that which is generated and destroyed. Will this be, or not? Yes, if this happens; otherwise not.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book VI, 1027a29-33&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Epicurus===

One generation after Aristotle, [[Epicurus]] argued that as atoms moved through the void, there were occasions when they would "swerve" (''[[clinamen]]'') from their otherwise determined paths, thus initiating new causal chains. Epicurus argued that these swerves would allow us to be more responsible for our actions, something impossible if every action was deterministically caused. For Epicurus, the occasional interventions of arbitrary gods would be preferable to strict determinism.

===Leucippus===
The first concept of ''chance'' is found in the [[Atomism]] of [[Leucippus]], often confused with that of [[Democritus]], though, in fact, the last studies show many differences between the two. The first assertion about chance is the Leucippus fragment that says:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "ὁ τοίνυν κόσμος συνέστη περικεκλασμένῳ σχήματι ἐσχηματισμένος τὸν τρόπον τοῦτον. τῶν ἀτόμων σωμάτων ἀπρονόητον καὶ τυχαίαν ἐχόντων τὴν κίνησιν συνεχῶς τε καὶ τάχιστα κινουμένων"
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;"The cosmos, then, became like a spherical form in this way: the atoms being submitted to a casual and unpredictable movement, quickly and incessantly".&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Alexander Diels|H.Diels-W.Kranz]] ''Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker'', Berlin Weidmann 1952, 24, I, 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Early modern philosophy===
In 1729 the''Testament'' of [[Jean Meslier]] states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The matter, by virtue of its own active force, moves and acts in blind manner".&lt;ref&gt;Meslier, J. ''The Testament''.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Soon after [[Julien Offroy de la Mettrie]] in his ''L'Homme Machine.'' (1748, anon.) wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Perhaps, the cause of man's existence is just in existence itself? Perhaps he is by chance thrown in some point of this terrestrial surface without any ''how'' and ''why''". &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his ''Anti-Sénèque'' [''Traité de la vie heureuse, par Sénèque, avec un Discours du traducteur sur le même sujet'', 1750] we read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Then, the chance has thrown us in life".&lt;ref&gt;Jde La Mettrie, J.O.:''Anti-Sénèque''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 19th century the French Philosopher [[Antoine-Augustin Cournot]] theorized ''chance'' in a new way, as series of not-linear causes. He wrote in ''Essai sur les fondements de nos connaissances'' (1851):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It is not because of rarity that the chance is actual. On the contrary, it is because of chance they produce many possible others."&lt;ref&gt;Cournot, A.A: ''Essai sur les fondements de nos connaissances et sur les caractères de la critique philosophique'', § 32.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Charles Peirce===
[[Tychism]] ({{lang-el|τύχη}} "chance") is a thesis proposed by the American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S.:  ''The Doctrine of Necessity Examined'', [[The Monist]], 1892
&lt;/ref&gt; It holds that absolute [[chance (philosophy)|chance]], also called spontaneity, is a real factor operative in the universe. It may be considered both the direct opposite of [[Einstein]]'s oft quoted dictum that: "[[God does not play dice]] with the universe" and an early philosophical anticipation of [[Werner Heisenberg]]'s [[uncertainty principle]].

Peirce does not, of course, assert that there is ''no'' law in the universe. On the contrary, he maintains that an absolutely chance world would be a contradiction and thus impossible.
Complete lack of order is itself a sort of order. The position he advocates is rather that there are in the universe both regularities and irregularities.

[[Karl Popper]] comments&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K: ''Of Clouds and Cuckoos'', included in ''Objective Knowledge'', revised, 1978, p231.&lt;/ref&gt; that Peirce's theory received little contemporary attention, and that other philosophers did not adopt indeterminism until the rise of quantum mechanics.

===Arthur Holly Compton===
In 1931, [[Arthur Holly Compton]] championed the idea of human freedom based on [[quantum indeterminacy]] and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring [[Randomness|chance]] into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the [[Schrödinger's cat]] paradox.&lt;ref&gt;SCIENCE, 74, p. 1911, August 14, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reacting to criticisms that his ideas made chance the direct cause of our actions, Compton clarified the two-stage nature of his idea in an ''Atlantic Monthly'' article in 1955. First there is a range of random possible events, then one adds a determining factor in the act of [[choice]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;A set of known physical conditions is not adequate to specify precisely what a forthcoming event will be. These conditions, insofar as they can be known, define instead a range of possible events from among which some particular event will occur. When one exercises freedom, by his act of choice he is himself adding a factor not supplied by the physical conditions and is thus himself determining what will occur. That he does so is known only to the person himself. From the outside one can see in his act only the working of physical law. It is the inner knowledge that he is in fact doing what he intends to do that tells the actor himself that he is free.&lt;ref&gt;"Science and Man’s Freedom", in ''The Cosmos of Arthur Holly Compton'', 1967, Knopf, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Compton welcomed the rise of indeterminism in 20th century science, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In my own thinking on this vital subject I am in a much more satisfied state of mind than I could have been at any earlier stage of science. If the statements of the laws of physics were assumed correct, one would have had to suppose (as did most philosophers) that the feeling of freedom is illusory, or if [free] choice were considered effective, that the laws of physics ... [were] unreliable. The dilemma has been an uncomfortable one.&lt;ref&gt;Commpton, A.H. ''The Human Meaning of Science'' p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;Together with Arthur Eddington in Britain, Compton was one of those rare distinguished physicists in the English speaking world of the late 1920s and throughout the 1930s arguing for the “liberation of free will” with the help of Heisenberg’s  indeterminacy principle, but their efforts had been met not only with physical and philosophical criticism but most primarily with fierce political and ideological campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kožnjak|first=Boris|title=The Earliest Missionaries of ‘Quantum Free Will’: A Socio-Historical Analysis|date=2018|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|work=Free Will &amp; Action|pages=131–154|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-99295-2_10|isbn=9783319992945|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Karl Popper===
In his essay ''Of Clouds and Cuckoos'', included in his book ''Objective Knowledge'', [[Karl Popper|Popper]]
contrasted "clouds", his metaphor for indeterministic systems, with "clocks", meaning deterministic ones.
He sided with indeterminism, writing
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I believe Peirce was right in holding that all clocks are clouds to some considerable degree — even the most precise of clocks. This, I think, is the most important inversion of the mistaken determinist view that all clouds are clocks&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K: ''Of Clouds and Cuckoos'', included in ''Objective Knowledge'', revised, 1978, p215.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Popper was also a promoter of [[propensity probability]].

===Robert Kane===
Kane is one of the leading contemporary philosophers on [[free will]].&lt;ref name = "KaneFreeWill"&gt;Kane, R. (ed.) ''Oxford Handbook of Free Will''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationphilosopher.com/solutions/philosophers/kane/ Information Philosophers] "Robert Kane is the acknowledged dean of the libertarian philosophers writing actively on the free will problem."&lt;/ref&gt;  Advocating what is termed within philosophical circles "[[Libertarianism (metaphysics)|libertarian]] freedom", Kane argues that "(1) the existence of alternative possibilities (or the agent's power to do otherwise) is a necessary condition for acting freely, and (2) determinism is not compatible with alternative possibilities (it precludes the power to do otherwise)".&lt;ref&gt;Kane (ed.): ''Oxford Handbook of Free Will'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is important to note that the crux of Kane's position is grounded not in a defense of alternative possibilities (AP) but in the notion of what Kane refers to as ultimate responsibility (UR).  Thus, AP is a necessary but insufficient criterion for free will.  It is necessary that there be ([[Metaphysics|metaphysically]]) real alternatives for our actions, but that is not enough; our actions could be random without being in our control.  The control is found in "ultimate responsibility".

What allows for ultimate responsibility of creation in Kane's picture are what he refers to as "self-forming actions" or SFAs — those moments of indecision during which people experience conflicting wills.  These SFAs are the undetermined, regress-stopping voluntary actions or refrainings in the life histories of agents that are required for UR.  UR does not require that ''every'' act done of our own free will be undetermined and thus that, for every act or choice, we could have done otherwise; it requires only that certain of our choices and actions be undetermined (and thus that we could have done otherwise), namely SFAs.  These form our character or nature; they inform our future choices, reasons and motivations in action.  If a person has had the opportunity to make a character-forming decision (SFA), he is responsible for the actions that are a result of his character.

===Mark Balaguer===

[[Mark Balaguer]], in his book ''Free Will as an Open Scientific Problem''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=19727 Notre Dame Reviews: ''Free Will as an Open Scientific Problem'']&lt;/ref&gt; argues similarly to Kane. He believes that, conceptually,  free will requires indeterminism, and the question of whether the brain behaves indeterministically is open to further [[empirical]] research. He has also written on this matter "A Scientifically Reputable Version of Indeterministic Libertarian Free Will".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://turingc.blogspot.pt/2012/07/mark-balaguer-scientifically-reputable.html|title=Mark Balaguer: A Scientifically Reputable Version of Indeterministic Libertarian Free Will|website=turingc.blogspot.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematics===
In [[probability theory]], a [[stochastic process]] {{IPAc-en|s|t|oʊ|ˈ|k|æ|s|t|ɪ|k}}, or sometimes random process, is the counterpart to a deterministic process (or [[deterministic system]]). Instead of dealing with only one possible reality of how the process might evolve over time (as is the case, for example, for solutions of an [[ordinary differential equation]]), in a stochastic or random process there is some indeterminacy in its future evolution described by probability distributions. This means that even if the initial condition (or starting point) is known, there are many possibilities the process might go to, but some paths may be more probable and others less so.

===Classical and relativistic physics===
The idea that [[Newtonian physics]] proved causal determinism was highly influential in the early modern period.
"Thus physical determinism [..] became the ruling faith among enlightened men; and everybody who did not embrace this new faith was held to be an obscurantist and a reactionary".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K: ''Of Clouds and Cuckoos'', included in ''Objective Knowledge'', revised, 1978, p212.&lt;/ref&gt; However: "Newton himself may be counted among the few dissenters, for he regarded the solar system as ''imperfect'', and consequently as likely to perish".&lt;ref&gt;Popper, 1978, citing, Henry Pemberton's ''A View of Sir Isaac Newton's Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Classical chaos]] is not usually considered an example of indeterminism, as it can occur in deterministic systems such as the [[three-body problem]].

[[John Earman]] has argued that most physical theories are indeterministic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/~uctytho/Determinism.pdf Earman, J. ''Determinism: What We Have Learned, and What We Still Don't Know'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/#StaDetPhy The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: ''Causal Determinism'']&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Newtonian physics admits solutions where particles accelerate continuously, heading out towards infinity. By the [[time reversibility]] of the laws in question, particles could also head inwards, unprompted by any pre-existing state. He calls such hypothetical particles "[[space invaders (classical physics)|space invaders]]".

John D. Norton has suggested another indeterministic scenario, known as [[Norton's Dome]], where a particle is initially situated on the exact apex of a dome.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy ''Causal Determinism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Branching space-time]] is a theory uniting indeterminism and the [[special theory of relativity]]. The idea was originated by [[Nuel Belnap]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://confer.uj.edu.pl/branching/ Conference on Branching Space Time]&lt;/ref&gt; The equations of [[general relativity]] admit of both indeterministic and deterministic solutions.

===Boltzmann===

[[Ludwig Boltzmann]], was one of the founders of [[statistical mechanics]] and the modern [[atomic theory of matter]]. He is remembered for his discovery that  the [[second law of thermodynamics]] is a statistical law  stemming from [[Chaos theory|disorder]]. He also speculated that the ordered universe we see is only a small bubble in much larger sea of chaos. The [[Boltzmann brain]] is a similar idea. He can be considered one  of few indeterminists to embrace pure chance.

===Evolution and biology===
[[Darwinian evolution]] has an enhanced reliance on the chance element of [[random mutation]] compared to the earlier evolutionary theory of [[Herbert Spencer]]. However, the question of whether evolution requires genuine ontological indeterminism is open to debate&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/millstein/papers/Millstein_agnosticism.pdf  Millstein, R.L.: ''Is the Evolutionary Process Deterministic or Indeterministic'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In the essay ''[[Chance and Necessity]]'' (1970) Jacques Monod rejected the role of [[final causation]] in [[biology]], instead arguing that a mixture of [[efficient causation]] and "pure chance" lead to [[teleonomy]], or merely ''apparent'' purposefulness.

The Japanese theoretical population geneticist [[Motoo Kimura]] emphasises the role of indeterminism in evolution.  According to [[neutral theory of molecular evolution]]: "at the molecular level most evolutionary change is caused by [[random drift]] of [[mutation|gene mutants]] that are equivalent in the face of selection.&lt;ref&gt;Kimura, M. ''The neutral theory of molecular evolution'', (''The Science'', No. 1, 1980, p. 34)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prigogine===

In his 1997 book, ''The End of Certainty'', Prigogine contends that determinism is no longer a viable scientific belief. "The more we know about our universe, the more difficult it becomes to believe in determinism." This is a major departure from the approach of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], all of whom expressed their theories in terms of deterministic equations. According to Prigogine, determinism loses its explanatory power in the face of [[irreversibility]] and [[instability]].&lt;ref&gt;End of Certainty by Ilya Prigogine pp. 162–85 Free Press; 1 edition (August 17, 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-684-83705-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-VI8093PJuUC&amp;pg=PA183]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prigogine traces the dispute over determinism back to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], whose attempt to explain individual variability according to evolving populations inspired [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] to explain the behavior of gases in terms of populations of particles rather than individual particles.&lt;ref&gt;End of Certainty by Ilya Prigogine pp. 19–21 Free Press; 1 edition (August 17, 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-684-83705-5}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-VI8093PJuUC&amp;pg=PA19]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the field of [[statistical mechanics]] and the realization that gases undergo irreversible processes. In deterministic physics, all processes are time-reversible, meaning that they can proceed backward as well as forward through time. As Prigogine explains, determinism is fundamentally a denial of the [[arrow of time]]. With no arrow of time, there is no longer a privileged moment known as the "present," which follows a determined "past" and precedes an undetermined "future." All of time is simply given, with the future as determined or undetermined as the past. With irreversibility, the arrow of time is reintroduced to physics. Prigogine notes numerous examples of irreversibility, including [[diffusion]], [[radioactive decay]], [[solar radiation]], [[weather]] and the emergence and evolution of [[life]]. Like weather systems, organisms are unstable systems existing far from [[thermodynamic equilibrium]]. Instability resists standard deterministic explanation. Instead, due to sensitivity to initial conditions, unstable systems can only be explained statistically, that is, in terms of [[probability]].

Prigogine asserts that [[Newtonian physics]] has now been "extended" three times, first with the use of the wave function in [[quantum mechanics]], then with the introduction of spacetime in [[general relativity]] and finally with the recognition of indeterminism in the study of unstable systems.

===Quantum mechanics===
{{main article|quantum indeterminacy}}
At one time, it was assumed in the physical sciences that if the behavior observed in a system cannot be predicted, the problem is due to lack of fine-grained information, so that a sufficiently detailed investigation would eventually result in a deterministic theory ("If you knew exactly all the forces acting on the dice, you would be able to predict which number comes up").

However, the advent of [[quantum mechanics]] removed the underpinning from that approach, with the claim that (at least according to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]]) the most basic constituents of matter at times behave [[quantum indeterminism|indeterministically]]. This comes from the [[wave function collapse|collapse of the wave function]], in which the state of a system upon [[measurement problem|measurement]] cannot in general be predicted.  Quantum mechanics only predicts the probabilities of possible outcomes, which are given by the [[Born rule]]. Non-deterministic behavior upon wave function collapse is not only a feature of the Copenhagen interpretation, with its [[observer (quantum mechanics)|observer]]-dependence, but also of [[objective collapse theories]].

Opponents of quantum indeterminism suggested that determinism could be restored by formulating a new theory in which additional information, so-called [[hidden variable (physics)|hidden variables]]
,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmosmagazine.com/features/online/4137/how-much-free-will-do-we-have: Cosmos Magazine: ''How Much Free Will Do We Have'']&lt;/ref&gt; would allow definite outcomes to be determined. For instance, in 1935, Einstein, Podolsky and Rosen wrote a paper titled ''"[[EPR paradox|Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?]]"'' arguing that such a theory was in fact necessary to preserve the [[principle of locality]].
In 1964, [[John S. Bell]] was able to define [[Bell's theorem|a theoretical test]] for these local hidden variable theories, which was reformulated as a workable experimental test through the work of [[CHSH inequality|Clauser, Horne, Shimony and Holt]]. The negative result of the 1980s [[Aspect experiment|tests]] by [[Alain Aspect]] ruled such theories out, provided certain [[Loopholes in Bell test experiments|assumptions]] about the experiment hold. Thus any [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]], including deterministic reformulations, must either reject [[Principle of locality|locality]] or reject [[counterfactual definiteness]] altogether. [[David Bohm]]'s [[Bohmian quantum mechanics|theory]] is the main example of a non-local deterministic quantum theory.

The [[many-worlds interpretation]] is said to be deterministic, but experimental results still cannot be predicted: experimenters do not know which 'world' they will end up in. Technically, [[counterfactual definiteness]] is lacking.

A notable consequence of quantum indeterminism is the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]], which prevents the simultaneous accurate measurement of all a particle's properties.

===Cosmology===
[[Primordial fluctuations]] are density variations in the early universe which are considered the seeds of all [[large-scale structure of the cosmos|structure]] in the universe. Currently, the most widely accepted explanation for their origin is in the context of [[cosmic inflation]]. According to the inflationary paradigm, the exponential growth of the [[scale factor]] during inflation caused [[quantum fluctuation]]s of the inflaton field to be stretched to macroscopic scales, and, upon leaving the [[Observable universe#Cosmological horizon|horizon]], to "freeze in".
At the later stages of radiation- and matter-domination, these fluctuations re-entered the horizon, and thus set the [[initial conditions]] for [[structure formation]].

===Neuroscience===
[[Neuroscientist]]s such as Bjoern Brembs and [[Christof Koch]] believe thermodynamically [[stochastic processes]] in the brain are the basis of [[free will]], and that even very simple organisms such as [[flies]] have a form of free will.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11998687 BBC Science: ''Free Will Similar in Animals, Humans—But Not So Free'']&lt;/ref&gt; Similar ideas are put forward by some philosophers such as [[indeterminism#Robert Kane|Robert Kane]].

Despite recognizing indeterminism to be a very low-level, necessary prerequisite, Bjoern Brembs says that it's not even close to being sufficient for addressing things like morality and responsibility.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; [[Edward O. Wilson]] does not extrapolate from bugs to people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/01/is-homosexualit/|title=Is Homosexuality an Evolutionary Step Towards the Superorganism?|publisher=|date=2008-01-03|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Corina E. Tarnita]] alerts against trying to draw parallels between people and insects, since human selflessness and cooperation, however, is of a different sort, also involving the interaction of culture and sentience, not just genetics and environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2010/08/kin-selection-challenged/|title=E.O. Wilson Proposes New Theory of Social Evolution|publisher=|date=2010-08-26|work=Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other views===
Against [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] and others who advocated [[determinism]], indeterminism—as championed by the English astronomer [[Sir Arthur Eddington]]—says that a physical object has an [[ontology|ontologically]] undetermined component that is not due to the [[epistemology|epistemological]] limitations of physicists' understanding. The [[uncertainty principle]], then, would not necessarily be due to [[Hidden variable theory|hidden variables]] but to an indeterminism in nature itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Determinism and indeterminism are examined in ''Causality and Chance in Modern Physics''  by [[David Bohm]]. He speculates that, since determinism can emerge from underlying indeterminism (via the [[law of large numbers]]), and that indeterminism can emerge from determinism (for instance, from [[classical chaos]]), the universe could be conceived of as having alternating layers of causality and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Causality-Chance-Modern-Physics-David/dp/0812210026 Bohm, D: ''Causality and Chance in Modern Physics'', pp. 29–33 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jaʿfar ibn Muḥammad aṡ-Ṣādiq̈''' ({{lang-ar|جعفر بن محمد الصادق}}{{lrm}}; 700 or 702–765&amp;nbsp;[[Common Era|C.E.]]), commonly known as ''Ja'''ʿ'''far al-Sadiq'' or simply '''al-Sadiq''' (The Truthful), was the sixth [[Shia Islam|Shia]] [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]] and a major figure in the [[Hanafi]] and [[Maliki]] schools of [[Madhhab|Sunni jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlEQCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA142|page=142|title=Dissent on Core Beliefs: Religious and Secular Perspectives|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a descendant of [[Ali]] on the side of  his father, [[Muhammad al-Baqir]], and of [[Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]]  on the side of his mother,  [[Umm Farwah bint al-Qasim]].   Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was raised by Ali, but was not his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = بحارالانوار|last = علامه مجلسی|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 5|volume = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali used to say: "Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr is my son but from Abu Bakr's lineage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = شرح نهج البلاغه|last = ابن ابی الحدید|first = |publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 53|volume = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Sadiq is the 6th imam and recognized by all Shia sects as an Imam, and is revered in traditional [[Sunni]] Islam as a transmitter of [[Hadith]], prominent [[Ulema|jurist]],&lt;ref name="Gleaves" /&gt; and mystic to sufis. Despite his wide-ranging attributions in a number religious disciplines, no works penned by Ja'far himself remain extant.&lt;ref name="Gleaves T" /&gt;

Al-Sadiq was born in either 700 or 702 CE. He inherited the position of imam from his father in his mid-thirties. As imam, al-Sadiq stayed out of the political conflicts that embroiled the region, evading the many requests for support that he received from rebels. He was the victim of some harassment by the [[Abbasid]] caliphs, and was eventually, according to most Shia Muslims, poisoned at the orders of the Caliph [[al-Mansur]].

In addition to his connection with Sunni schools of [[Madhhab|Sunni jurisprudence]],&lt;ref name="WIJSSS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abdullah Anik Misra|title=Was Imam Ja’far al-Sadiq Sunni or Shi’i?|url=http://islamqa.org/hanafi/seekersguidance-hanafi/32840|website=Islamqa.org|accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was a significant figure in the formulation of Shia doctrine. The traditions recorded from al-Sadiq are said to be more numerous than all [[hadith]]s recorded from all other Shia imams combined.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabatabai|first1=Sayyid Muhammad Husayn|others= Translated by [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] | authorlink=Allameh Tabatabaei | title= Shi'ite Islam|publisher=SUNY press|pages=68–69,179–181| year=1997| isbn=0-87395-272-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the founder of "[[Ja'fari jurisprudence]]", al-Sadiq also elaborated the doctrine of ''[[Nass (Islam)|Nass]]'' (divinely inspired designation of each imam by the previous imam), and ''[[Ismah]]'' (the infallibility of the imams), as well as that of [[Taqiyyah]].&lt;ref name="haywood"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haywood|first1=John A.|title=Jaʿfar ibn Muḥammad|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/299261/Jafar-ibn-Muhammad|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chittick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabåatabåa'åi|first1=Muhammad Husayn|title=A Shi'ite Anthology|date=1981|others=Selected and with a Foreword by [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i]]; Translated with Explanatory Notes by [[William Chittick]]; Under the Direction of and with an Introduction by [[Hossein Nasr]] |publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780585078182|pages=9–11, 42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of succession after al-Sadiq's death was the cause of division among Shias who considered his eldest son, [[Isma'il ibn Jafar|Isma'il]] (who had died before his father) to be the next imam, and those who believed his third son [[Musa al-Kadhim]] was the imam. The first group became known as the [[Ismaili]]s and the second, larger, group was named Ja'fari or the [[Twelver]]s.&lt;ref name="EncycOfIslam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Karen|title=Islam, A Short History|date=2002|publisher=Modern Library; Rev Upd Su edition|isbn=978-0812966183|pages=56–57, 66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birth and early life==
Ja'far al-Sadiq was born in [[Medina]] either in 80/699–700 or 83/703–704. On his father's side he was a great-great grandson of [[Ali]], the first imam. His mother, [[Farwah bint al-Qasim]] was a great-granddaughter of [[Abu Bakr]]. Al-Sadiq was the first of the Shia imams to be descended from both [[Abu Bakr]], the first ruler of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], and [[Ali]], the first Imam. However, shias believed that the previous caliphs, by taking over control of the Islamic Empire, had unlawfully unseated Ali, who was the rightful heir to the caliphate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = انساب الاشراف|last = بلاذری|first = احمد بن یحیی|publisher = مؤسسه الاعلمی ‌‌للمطبوعات|year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 394|volume = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the first fourteen years of his life he lived alongside his grandfather [[Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin|Zayn al-Abedin]], and witnessed the latter's withdrawal from politics. He also noted the respect that the famous jurists of [[Medina]] held toward Zayn al-Abedin in spite of his few followers.&lt;ref name="Lalani"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lalani|first1=Arzina R.|title=Early Shi'i Thought: The Teachings of Imam Muhammad Al-Baqir|date=March 9, 2001|publisher=I.

In his mother's house, al-Sadiq also interacted with his grandfather [[Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr]], who was respected by the people of Medina as a famous traditionalist. During this period, [[Umayyad]] power was at its climax, and the childhood of al-Sadiq was coincided with the growing interest of the people of [[Medina]] in prophetic science and interpretations of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="Jafri"/&gt;

==Imamate==
{{see also| Imamah (Shia doctrine)}}

Al-Sadiq was thirty-four or thirty-seven when he inherited the position of [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imamah]] or imamate upon the death of his father [[Muhammad al-Baqir]]. He held the imamate for 28 years, longer than any other Shia imam.&lt;ref name="Jafri"/&gt; His Imamate was a crucial period in Islamic history for both political and doctrinal areas. Prior to al-Sadiq, the majority of Shias had preferred the revolutionary politics of [[Zayd ibn Ali|Zaid]] (al-Sadiq's uncle) to the mystical quietism of al-Sadiq's father and grandfather.&lt;ref name="Gleaves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jafri"/&gt;  Zaid had claimed that the position of an imam was conditional on his appearing publicly to claim his rights.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macmillan Reference USA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=Richard C.|title=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World, A-Z|date=2003|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0028656038|pages=369, 625}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Al-Sadiq, on the other hand, elaborated the doctrine of Imamate, which says "Imamate is not a matter of human choice or self-assertion," but that each imam possesses a unique ''Ilm'' (knowledge) which qualifies him for the position. This knowledge was passed down from the prophet [[Muhammad]] through the line of [[Ali]]'s immediate descendants. The doctrine of ''Nass'' or "divinely inspired designation of each imam by the previous imam", therefore, was completed by al-Sadiq.{{efn|Sunni sources, however, claim that doctrines such as the [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imamate]] were formulated many years after al-Sadiq and wrongly ascribed to him.&lt;ref name="Macmillan Reference USA"/&gt;}} In spite of being designated as the Imam, al-Sadiq would not lay claim to the [[Caliphate]] during his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macmillan Reference USA"/&gt;

===Under the Umayyad rulers===
Al-Sadiq's Imamate extended over the latter half of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], which was marked by many revolts (mostly by Shia movements), and eventually the violent overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate by the Abbasids, decedents of Muhammad's uncle, [[Al-‘Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Abbas]]. Al-Sadiq maintained his father's policy of quietism, and played no part in the numerous rebellions. He stayed out of the uprising of [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydits]] who gathered around al-Sadiq's uncle, [[Zayd ibn Ali|Zayd]], who had the support [[Mu`tazila|Mu'tazilites]] and the traditionalists of [[Medina]] and [[Kufa]].&lt;ref name="Jafri"/&gt; Al-Sadiq also did not support the rebellion led by his cousin, [[Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya]] who was inspired by [[Kaysanites Shia|Kaysanites]].&lt;ref name="Jafri"/&gt; Al-Sadiq played no part in the Abbassid rebellion against the Umayyads.&lt;ref name="Gleaves"/&gt; His response to a message requesting help from [[Abu Muslim]], the [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasani]] leader of an uprising against the Umayyads, became famous. Al-Sadiq asked for a lamp and burned Abu Muslim's letter, saying to the envoy who brought it, "Tell your master what you have seen."&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; In burning Abû Muslim's letter he had also said, "This man is not one of my men, this time is not mine."&lt;ref name="Moezzi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moezzi|first1=Mohammad Ali Amir|title=The Divine Guide in Early Shi'ism : The Sources of Esotericism in Islam|date=1994|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=9780585069722|pages=64–65,139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Sadiq also evaded requests for assistance to other claims to the throne, without advancing his own claims. He had said that even though he, as the designated imam, was the true leader of the [[Ummah]], he would not press his claim to the caliphate.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt; This conscious position of neutrality was likely why Ja'far was tolerated by the Umayyad court for so long.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9893374|title=The book of guidance into the lives of the twelve imams = Kitāb al-irshād|last=-1022.|first=Mufīd, Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad,|date=1981|publisher=Tahrike Tarsile Qurʼan|others=Howard, I. K. A.|isbn=9780940368125|edition= 1st|location=Elmhurst, N.Y.|oclc=9893374}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position also gave rise to the legal precedent of [[Taqiya|Taqiyyah]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Under the Abbasid rulers===
The end of the Umayyad dynasty and beginning of the Abbasid was a period during which central authority was weak, allowing al-Sadiq to teach freely in a school which trained about four thousands students. A school of this size was unusual for religious teachers at this time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;John B. Taylor, “Jaʿfar al-Sādiq, Spiritual Forebear of the Sufis,” ''Islamic Culture''40/2, April 1966, pp. 97-113.&lt;/ref&gt; Among these were [[Abū Ḥanīfa]] and [[Malik ibn Anas]], founder of two major [[Sunni]] schools of law, the [[Hanafi]]yah and the [[Maliki]]yah.&lt;ref name="Phyllis G. Jestice p 415"&gt;Phyllis G. Jestice, Holy People of the World: A Cross-cultural Encyclopedia, Volume 1, p 415. {{ISBN|1576073556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig W. Adamec, Historical Dictionary of Islam, p 12. {{ISBN|0810863030}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Umar F. Abd-Allah, Mālik and Medina: Islamic Legal Reasoning in the Formative Period, p 44. {{ISBN|9004247882}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wasil ibn Ata]], founder of [[Mu`tazila]] school, was also among his pupils. After the Abbasid revolution had overthrown the Umayyad caliphate, it turned against Shia groups who had previously been its allies against the Umayyads. The new Abbasid rulers, who had risen to power on the basis of their descent from [[Muhammad]]'s uncle [[Abbas ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib]], were suspicious of al-Sadiq, because Shias had always believed that leadership of the [[Ummah]] was a position issued by divine order, and which was given to each imam by the previous imam. In addition, al-Sadiq had a large following, both among scholars and among those who believed him to be the imam.&lt;ref name="EncycOfIslam"/&gt; During rule of [[Al-Mansur]], al-Sadiq was summoned to [[Baghdad]] along with some other prominent men from [[Medina]] in order for the Caliph to keep a close watch on them. Al-Sadiq, however, asked the Caliph to excuse him from going there by reciting a [[hadith]] which said that "the man who goes away to make a living will achieve his purpose, but he who sticks to his family will prolong his life."&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; al-Mansur reportedly accepted his request. After the defeat and death of his cousin [[Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya]] in 762, however, al-Sadiq thought it advisable to obey al-Mansur's summons. After a short stay in [[Baghdad]], however, he convinced the Caliph that he was not a threat, and was allowed to return to Medina.&lt;ref name="Gleaves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haywood"/&gt;

Toward the end of his life, he was subject to some harassment by the Abbasid caliphs. The governor of [[Medina]] was instructed by the Caliph to burn down his house, an event which reportedly did al-Sadiq no harm.{{efn|The Shias consider this event as a miraculous escape from the fire by their Imam, who is said "boldly stamped on the flames, exclaiming "I am of the sons of [[Ishmael in Islam|Isma'il]]. I am a son of [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]], the Friend of God," whom the [[Quran]] represents as having escaped the fire in safety. [http://tanzil.net/#21:69 Quran, 21:69]}}&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; To cut his ties with his followers, al-Sadiq was also watched closely and occasionally imprisoned.&lt;ref name="EncycOfIslam"&gt;{{cite book|author=Campo, Juan E.|year=2009|title=Encyclopedia of Islam (Encyclopedia of World Religions)|pages=386, 652, 677|location=USA|publisher=Facts on File |isbn=978-0-8160-5454-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these trials, Al-Sadiq appears to have continued his scholarship and remained an influential teacher in his native Medina and beyond.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Family life==
Al-Sadiq married Fatimah Al-Hasan, a descendant of [[Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali]], with whom he had two sons, [[Isma'il ibn Jafar]] (the Ismaili sixth Imām) and [[Abdullah al-Aftah ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq|Abdullah al-Aftah]]. Following his wife's death, al-Sadiq purchased a [[Berber people|Berbery]] or [[Andalusia]]n slave named Hamidah Khātūn ({{lang-ar|حميدة خاتون}}), freed her, trained her as an Islamic scholar, and then married her. She bore him two more sons; [[Musa al-Kadhim]] (the seventh Twelver imam), and [[Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq (Al-Dibaj)|Muhammad al-Dibaj]]. She was revered by the Shias, especially by women, for her wisdom. She was known as Hamidah the Pure. Ja'far al-Sadiq used to send women to learn the tenets of Islam from her, said that "Hamidah is pure from every impurity like the ingot of pure gold."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rizvi|first1=Sayyid Saeed Akhtar|title=Slavery, from Islamic &amp; Christian perspectives|date=1988|publisher=Vancouver Islamic Educational Foundation|location=Richmond, B.C.|isbn=0-920675-07-7|edition= 2nd (rev.) ed., 1988.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Imam Ja‘far also had a son called 'Is-haq', who reportedly married [[Sayyidah Nafisah bint Al-Hasan]]. Nafisah was a descendant of Al-Hasan ibn ‘Ali, and teacher of Sunni Imam [[Ash-Shafi‘i]].&lt;ref name="sunnah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunnah.org/history/Scholars/nafisa_at_tahira.htm|title=Nafisa at-Tahira|website=www.sunnah.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KassamBlomfield&gt;Zayn Kassam and Bridget Blomfield "Remembering Fatima and Zaynab: Gender in Perspective", in "The Shi'i World", edited by Farhad Daftory.

==Death==
[[File:Baghi tomb.jpg|262px|thumbnail|right|The historical [[tomb]] of [[Al-Baqi']] was destroyed in 1926. Ja'far al-Sadiq was one of four Shia imams buried here.]]
Al-Sadiq was arrested several times by Umayyad and Abbasid caliphs Hisham, Saffah, and Mansur. He was particularly seen as a threat by the newly minted Abbasids who felt challenge by his strong claim to the title of caliph.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When he died in 148/765 at the age of 64 or 65, many Shi'i sources suspected that he was poisoned at the behest of Mansur. Al-sadiq's death led to uncertainty about the succession of the Imamate.&lt;ref name="Gleaves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt; He was buried in [[Medina]], in the famous [[Jannatul Baqee]] cemetery, and his tomb was a place of pilgrimage until 1926. It was then that the Wahhabis conquered Medina for the second time and razed the tomb, along with all other prominent Islamic shrines, with the exception of that of the prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adamec|first1=Ludwig W.|title=The A to Z of Islam|date=2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press; Revised edition|isbn=978-0810845053|page=53|url=https://www.amazon.com/Z-Islam-Guide/dp/0810845059/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i|Tabatabai]] upon hearing the news of al-Sadiq's death, Mansur wanted to put an end to the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]]. Mansur reportedly wrote to the governor of Medina, commanding him to read the imam's testament, and to behead the person named in it as the future imam. However, the governor found that al-Sadiq had chosen four people rather than one: Mansur himself, the governor, the imam's oldest son [[Abdullah al-Aftah]], and [[Musa al-Kazim]], his younger son.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai" /&gt;

==Succession==
The Shia group had begun to split during the lifetime of al-Sadiq, when his eldest son [[Isma'il ibn Jafar]] predeceased him. His death occurred in the presence of many witnesses.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt; After the death of Ja'far al-Sadiq, his following fractured further, with the larger group, who came to be known as the Twelvers, following his younger son [[Musa al-Kadhim]]. Another group believed instead that Isma'il had been designated as the next imam, and that since he had predeceased his father, the imamate had passed to Isma'il's son [[Muhammad ibn Ismail]] and his descendants. This latter group became known as the [[Isma'ili]]s. Some Isma'ilis believe that Isma'il had not actually died, but would reappear as [[Mahdi]], the rejuvenator of Islam in the Shia doctrine.

Still other groups accepted either [[Abdullah al-Aftah]] or [[Muhammad ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq (Al-Dibaj)]], both sons of the Ja'far al-Sadiq, as the imam. A final group believed that al-Sadiq had been the last imam, and that the lineage had not continued.

After the death of Musa al-Kazim, the majority of his followers recognized his son [[Ali al-Ridha]] as the eighth imam, while others believed that al-Kazim had been the last imam. This latter group became known as the [[Waqifite Shia|Waqifiyah]].

No major divisions occurred in Shiaism from the eighth to the twelfth imam, whom the majority of the Shia (Twelvers) considered to be [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]]. Among the sects which separated from the majority, only [[Zaidiyyah]] and [[Ismaili]] continue to exist today.&lt;ref name="Gleaves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt;&lt;ref name="haywood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EncycOfIslam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macmillan Reference USA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbin 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corbin|first1=Henry|title=The History of Islamic Philosophy|date=2001|publisher=Kegan Paul International|others=Translated by Liadain Sherrard with the assistance of Philip Sherrard|location=London and New York|page=6,31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious views==
Al-Sadiq religious views are recorded as authority in the writing of number of contradictory positions. The use of his name as an authority within the [[Sufi]], scientific, Sunni legal, Ismaili and extremist writings shows his importance as a figure within the development of early Muslim thought.&lt;ref name="Gleaves T"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gleaves|first1=Robert|title=JAʿFAR AL-ṢĀDEQ ii. Teachings|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jafar-al-sadeq-ii-teachings|website=Encyclopedia Iranica|accessdate=2015|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ya'qubi]] it was customary for anyone who wanted to relate a tradition from him to say "the Learned One informed us". Malik ibn Anas, when quoting anything from al-Sadiq, would say "The Thiqa (truthful) Ja'far b. Muhammad himself told me that…" the same is reported from Abu Hanifa.&lt;ref name="EncycOfIslam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jafri"/&gt; The works attributed to him may be of dubious authenticity, but they do establish his name at least as indicating a mastery of learning generally, and the Islamic sciences in particular.&lt;ref name="Gleaves T"/&gt;
Though most groups wished to recruit al-Sadiq's legacy for their own cause, the most extensive source for his teachings is to be found within the imami Shia tradition. For [[Twelver]] Shias Ja'far al-Ṣadiq is the sixth imam who established the Shiism as serious intellectual force in the late Umayyad and early Abbasid periods.&lt;ref name="Gleaves T"/&gt; According to [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i|Tabatabai]] the number of traditions left behind by al-Sadiq and his father were more than all the [[hadith]]s recorded from Muhammad and all the other Shia imams combined.&lt;ref name="Tabatabai"/&gt; Shia thought starting with [[Sayyid Haydar Amuli]], and leading to Safavid philosophers like [[Mir Damad]], [[Mulla Sadra]] and [[Qazi Sa’id Qumi]] continuing to the present day is based on Shia imam's tradition specially al-Sadiq.&lt;ref name="chittick"/&gt;

=== Ja'fari school of law ===
Shia jurisprudence became known as [[Ja'fari jurisprudence]] after Ja'far al-Sadiq, whose legal dicta were the most important source of Shia law. Like [[Sunni]] law, Ja'fari jurisprudence is based on the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]], and also based on the consensus ([[Ijma]]). Unlike the Sunnis, Shias give more weight to reasoning ('Aql), while Sunnis only allow for a kind of analogical reasoning ([[Qiyas]]).&lt;ref name="Macmillan Reference USA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gleaves T"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sharif|first1=Mian Mohammad|title=History of Muslim Philosophy, Vol 2|date=1966|authorlink=Muhammad Sharif|publisher=Allgauer Heimatverlag GmbH|location=Germany|pages=906–907}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Al-Sadiq is presented as one who denounces personal opinion ([[Raʾy]]) and analogical reasoning (qiās) of his contemporaries arguing that God’s law is occasional and unpredictable, and that the servants' duty is not to embark on reasoning in order to discover the law, but to submit to the inscrutable will of God as revealed by the imam.&lt;ref name="Gleaves T"/&gt;
In his book ''Maqbula'' Omar ibn Ḥanẓala (who was a disciple of al-Sadiq) asks the imam how legal disputes within the community should be solved, and whether one should take such cases to the ruler ([[Sultan]]) and his judges. Ja'far al-Sadiq replies in the negative saying that those who take their disputes to the rulers and their judges get only soḥt (unlawful decision). Instead al-Sadiq recommends an unofficial system of justice for the community, and that the disputants should turn to "those who relate our [i.e., the imams'] [[Hadith]]s". The reason for this is that the imams have "made such a one a judge (ḥākem) over you."&lt;ref name="Gleaves T"/&gt;

=== Importance in Sufism ===
''See Also: Encyclopedia Iranica: JAʿFAR AL-ṢĀDEQ iii. And Sufism'' [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jafar-al-sadeq-iii-and-sufism]

Ja'far Al-Sadiq holds a special prominence among [[Sufism|Sufi]] orders due to his claimed connections to some of Sufism's earliest theologians. He is elevated as an individual of great spiritual knowledge ('ilm) in many early works of Sufi literature, such as those by Abu Bakr Kalābāḏi (d. 380/990) or later in the writings of Sufi poet Abū Ḥamīd bin Abū Bakr Ibrāhīm [[Attar of Nishapur|Aṭṭār]] (d. 618/1221).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 'Attar claims that Ja'far, more than the other Imams, was a spiritual forebear to Sufism when he says he, "spoke more than the other imams concerning the Path (''ṭariqat'').”&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tadhkirat al-Auiiya|last='Attar|first=Farid Al-din|publisher=Routledge|year=1966|isbn=|editor-last=Nicholson|location=London|pages=|translator-last=Arberry}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Attar's attributed sayings of Al-Sadiq are full of Sufi specific terminology such as "He had passed away (fa'na: figuratively refers to the death of the ego)"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Corbin 2001" /&gt; and "window into the heart."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is suspicious that these terms are absent from older collections of sayings attributed to Ja'far.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is also worth noting that some historical jurists and authors, such as [[Moqaddas Ardabili]] (d. 993/1585), saw Sufi claims of relation to al-Sadiq as a fabricated tie created to lend historical justification to the Sufis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jafar-al-sadeq-iii-and-sufism|title=JAʿFAR AL-ṢĀDEQ iii. And Sufism – Encyclopaedia Iranica|last=electricpulp.com|website=www.iranicaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While is as apparent in these writings that Ja'far al-sadiq was regarded as a founding figure in Sufism, the historical situation is more difficult to ascertain. Given his large following and established school ([[madrasa]]), he almost certainly was a teacher to "proto-sufis."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Perhaps, as claimed by 'Attar, this included Abu Noʿaym, [[Sofyān Ṯawri]] (d 161/776), a well known jurist and [[Asceticism|ascetic]] in his time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is through Sofyan that one of the most repeated attributions to Ja'far's character reportedly comes. 'Attar relates: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Sadiq was seen wearing a precious robe of silk. They said,'Son of the Prophet of God, this is not in accord with the life of your holy family.' He took that man by the hand and drew it into his sleeve which was clad in coarse lint so that his hand was pricked. Sadiq said ‘This is for God and this is for men'&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;"&lt;/blockquote&gt;This verse shows us that Ja'far was viewed by Sufi sources as processing a humbleness and inner piety that was a cornerstone of [[malamatiyya]] thought. The malamatiyya were closely associated with the Sufis, and these two mystical traditions had, in many ways, been blended by the time of 'Attar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Whether these stories are any most than myth crafted by later generations is not something that can be conclusively determined. What can be said is that Sufi teachers often traced the source of their knowledge back to the teaching of Al-Sadiq and that perceived content of these teaching remain relevant to Sufi practice today&lt;ref name="Corbin 2001" /&gt;

===Theology===
Ja'far al-Sadiq's view on theology is transmitted through Mufazzel who recorded his own questions and al-Sadiq's answers in a book known as ''Ketab al-Tawhid'' in which al-Sadiq gives proofs as the unity of God. This book is considered identical to the ''Ketāb al-ehlilaja'' which is a reply to Mufazzel's request from al-Sadiq for a refutation of those who deny God.
Hesham ibn Ḥakam (d. 179/796) is another famous student of the imam who proposed a number of doctrines that later became orthodox Shia theology, including the rational necessity of the divinely guided imam in every age to teach and lead God's community.&lt;ref name="Gleaves T"/&gt;
Al-Sadiq is attributed with the statement: "Whoever claims that God has ordered evil, has lied about God. Whoever claims that both good and evil are attributed to him, has lied about God". This view which is accordance with that of [[Mu`tazila|Mu'tazilite]] doctrine seems to absolve God from the responsibility for evil in the world. Al-Sadiq says that God does not "order created beings to do something without providing for them a means of not doing it, though they do not do it, or not do it without God's permission". Al-Sadiq expressed a moderate view between compulsion (Jabr), and giving the choice to man (Tafviz), stating that God decreed some things absolutely, but left some others to human agency. This assertion was widely adopted afterwards and was called "al-amr bayn al-amrayn" which meant" neither predestination nor delegation but a position between the two."&lt;ref name="haywood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;
Al-Ṣadiq's view therefore is recorded as supporting either position as it is reported in an exchange between him and an unknown interlocutor. The interlocutor asks if God forces his servants to do evil or whether he has delegated power to them. Al-Sadiq's answers negatively to both questions. When asked "What then?" he replies, "The blessings of your Lord are between these two".&lt;ref name="Gleaves T"/&gt;

It is narrated in hadith that Ja'far al-Sadiq has said "We are the people well-grounded in knowledge and we are the ones who know how to interpret it."&lt;ref name="Kulayni"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Al-Kulayni |first1=Abu Ja’far Muhammad ibn Ya’qub |title=Kitab al-Kafi |date=2015 |publisher=The Islamic Seminary Inc. |location=South Huntington, NY |isbn=9780991430864 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Tafsir===
The works attributed to Jafar al-Sadiq in Tafsir (Quranic exegesis) are mostly described as the [[Sufi]]-mystical works such as "Tafsir al-Qorʾān", "Manāfeʿ ṣowar al-Qorʾān" and "ḴawāsÂsÂ al-Qorʾān al-aʿẓam". The attribution of these works to al-Sadiq, however, is suspected. In his books ''Ḥaqāʾeq al-tafsir'' and ''Ziādāt Ḥaqāʾeq al-tafsir'', ʿAbd-al-Raḥmān Solami cites al-Ṣadiq as one of his major (if not the major) source of knowledge concerning the meaning of Quranic verses.&lt;ref name="Gleaves T"/&gt;

"Ketāb al-jafr", an early mystical commentary on the Quran ([[Tafsir]]), is also attributed to al-Sadiq.&lt;ref name="EncycOfIslam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gleaves T"/&gt; According to [[Ibn Khaldun]], it was originally written on the skin of a young bull, allowing the imam to reveal the hidden meaning of the [[Quran]].&lt;ref name="smet"/&gt; al-Sadiq  is said to have proposed a fourfold model of Quran interpretation. He said that "The Book of God comprises four things: the statement set down, the implied purport, the hidden meanings, relating to the supra-sensible world, and the exalted spiritual doctrines." He said that the plain meanings were for the common people; the hidden meanings for the elite; the implied meanings for the "friends of god;" and the "exalted spiritual doctrines" were the "province of the prophets."&lt;ref name="Corbin 2001"/&gt; He stated that [[Hadith]], or traditional sayings of the Prophet, should be rejected if they contradicted the Quran.&lt;ref name="haywood"/&gt;

===Doctrine of Taqiyyah===
{{See also|Taqiyyah}}
Al-Sadiq adopted [[Taqiyyah]] as a defensive tool against the violence and threats that were directed against him and the Shias.&lt;ref name="Gleaves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macmillan Reference USA"/&gt; Taqiyya was a form of religious dissimulation,&lt;ref name=Momen/&gt; or a legal dispensation whereby a believing individual can deny their faith while they are in fear or at risk of significant persecution.&lt;ref name=StewartNYUEssay&gt;{{Cite web|title=Islam in Spain after the Reconquista|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/program/neareast/test/andalusia/2_p8_text.html|first=Devin|last=Stewart|work=Teaching Materials|publisher=The Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies at [[New York University]]|mode=cs2|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Taqiyya says that it is acceptable to hide one's true opinions if by revealing them, one puts oneself or others in danger.&lt;ref name="EncycOfIslam"/&gt; The doctrine was developed by al-Sadiq, and served to protect the Shias when [[Al-Mansur]], the [[Abbasid]] caliph, conducted a brutal and oppressive campaign against [[Alids]] and their supporters.&lt;ref name=Momen&gt;{{cite book|last=Momen|first=Moojan|title=An Introduction to Shi'i Islam|year=1985|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=39, 183|isbn=978-0-300-03531-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Moezzi, in the early sources Taqiyya means "the keeping or safeguarding of the secrets of the Imams' teaching." "Divergence of traditions" is, therefore, sometimes justified by Shia imams as a result of the need for using Taqiyya. "He who is certain that we [the imams] proclaim only the truth ([[Al-Haqq]]), may he be satisfied with our teaching," asserts al-Sadiq; "and if he hears us say something contradictory to what he heard earlier, he should know that we are acting only in his own interest."&lt;ref name="Moezzi"/&gt; Practicing Taqiyya also had an esoteric significance for those who believed that their teachings should not be comprehensible to ordinary [[Ulama]], and so hid their more profound teachings.&lt;ref name="Armstrong"/&gt;

===Works===
According to Haywood half a dozen religious works bear al-Sadiq's name as author, though none of them can be firmly described as being written by al-Ṣadiq. It is probable that al-Sadiq was an author who left the writing to his students. The alchemist, Geber, for example, suggested that some of his works are "little more than records of Jaʿfar's teaching or summaries of hundreds of monographs written by him."&lt;ref name="haywood"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macmillan Reference USA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smet"&gt;{{cite web|last1=De Smet|first1=Daniel|title=Ja'far al-Ṣadiq iv. And Esoteric sciences|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/jafar-al-sadeq-iv-and-esoteric-sciences|website=Encyclopedia Iranica|accessdate=2015|date=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ja'far Al-Sadiq is also cited in a wide range of historical sources, including [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], [[Ya'qubi|al-Yaqubi]] and [[Al-Masudi]]. [[Al-Dhahabi]] recognizes his contribution to Sunni tradition and [[Ismailism|Isma'ili]] scholars such as [[Qadi al-Nu'man]]&lt;ref&gt;Madelung, W., The Sources of Ismāīlī Law, The University of Chicago Press, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 35, No. 1 (Jan., 1976), pp. 29-40&lt;/ref&gt; recorded his traditions in their work.&lt;ref&gt;Meri, Josef W. "Medieval Islamic Civilization: An Encyclopedia". Routledge, NY. 2005, p 409 {{ISBN|978-0-415-96690-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ketāb al-jafr'' is a commentary on the Quran which, according to [[Ibn Khaldun]], was first written on the skin of a young bull, which allowed al-Sadiq to reveal the hidden meaning of the Quran.&lt;ref name="smet"/&gt; Various versions of his will, and a number of collections of legal dicta, are attributed to him as well. There are many reports attributed to him in the early Shia [[Hadith]] collections such as [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni]]'s [[Kitab al-Kafi]], where they are featured as central sources of Imami doctrine.&lt;ref name="Gleaves"/&gt; "Al-haft wa'l-aẓella" and "Ketāb al-ṣerāṭ" which are containing "secret revelations" to Mofażżal are also attributed to al-Sadiq, and had an important role in the elaboration of the esoteric doctrine of the [[Alawites|Nosayris]], for whom al-Ṣadiq is an influential figure.&lt;ref name="Gleaves"/&gt;

'''John Arthur Johnson''' (March 31, 1878 – June 10, 1946), nicknamed the '''Galveston Giant''', was an American [[boxing|boxer]] who, at the height of the [[Jim Crow era]], became the first [[African American]] [[List of lineal boxing world champions#Heavyweight|world heavyweight]] boxing champion (1908–1915). Among the period's most dominant champions, Johnson remains a boxing legend, with his 1910 fight against [[James J. Jeffries]] dubbed the "fight of the century".&lt;ref name="Sullivan"&gt;John L. Sullivan, cited in: Christopher James Shelton, Historian for The Boxing Amusement Park, [http://www.ringsideboxingshow.com/SheltonBLOGJohnsonJeffries.html {{"'}}Fight of the Century' Johnson vs. Jeffries, the 100th anniversary"]&lt;/ref&gt; According to filmmaker [[Ken Burns]], "for more than thirteen years, Jack Johnson was the most famous and the most notorious African-American on Earth".&lt;ref name=Burns&gt;Ken Burns, ''Unforgivable Blackness'' {{elaboration needed|year, publisher, form of media?|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/unforgivableblackness/sparring/rise.html |title=Unforgivable Blackness . Sparring . Johnson's Rise |publisher=PBS |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transcending boxing, he became part of the culture and the history of racism in America.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In 1912, Johnson opened a successful and luxurious "black and tan" ([[desegregated]]) restaurant and nightclub, which in part was run by his wife, a white woman.  Major newspapers of the time soon claimed that Johnson was attacked by the government only after he became famous as a black man married to a white woman, and was linked to other white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/history/ct-met-cafe-de-champion-jack-johnson-chicago-20180525-story.html |title=The short, sad story of Cafe de Champion — Jack Johnson's mixed-race nightclub on Chicago's South Side |last=Johnson |first=Charles J. |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=May 27, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was arrested on charges of violating the [[Mann Act]]—forbidding one to transport a woman across state lines for "immoral purposes"—a racially motivated charge that embroiled him in controversy for his relationships, including marriages, with white women.&lt;ref&gt;Peggy Pascoe, ''What Comes Naturally: Miscegenation Law and the Making of Race in America'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Mrjbk8zc7PgC&amp;pg=PA165 p. 165].&lt;/ref&gt; There were also allegations of [[domestic violence]]. Sentenced to a year in prison, Johnson fled the country and fought boxing matches abroad for seven years until 1920 when he served his sentence at the federal penitentiary at Levenworth. Johnson was posthumously pardoned by President [[Donald Trump]] in May 2018, 105 years after his conviction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/sports/jack-johnson-pardon-trump.html |title=Trump Pardons Jack Johnson, Heavyweight Boxing Champion |last1=Eligon|first1=John|last2=Shear|first2=Michael D.|date=May 24, 2018 |website=The New York Times|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/sports/jack-johnson-racism.html|title=Missed in Coverage of Jack Johnson, the Racism Around Him |last1=Eligon |first1=John|last2=Thorpe|first2=Brandon K.|date=May 24, 2018|website=The New York Times|accessdate=May 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson continued taking paying fights for many years, and operated several other businesses, including lucrative endorsement deals. Johnson died in a [[car crash]] on June 10, 1946, at the age of 68.&lt;ref name="Internet Archive"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/050117/17burns.peo.htm |title=U.S. News &amp; World Report 'Two champs meet' |publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=February 14, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111070334/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/050117/17burns.peo.htm |archivedate=November 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at [[Graceland Cemetery]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=FAG&gt;{{Find a Grave|6125607|Jack Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Johnson was born the third child of nine, and the first son, of Henry and Tina Johnson, two former slaves who worked blue collar jobs as a janitor and a dishwasher. His father Henry served as a civilian teamster of the Union's 38th Colored Infantry. Jack once said his father was the "most perfect physical specimen that he had ever seen", although his father was only {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m|2|abbr=on}} and left with an [[atrophied]] right leg from his service in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Geoffrey C. Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. New York:&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up in Galveston, Texas, Johnson attended five years of school.&lt;ref name="Ward, Geoffrey C 2004. PG20"&gt;Ward, Geoffrey C. Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. New York: A.A. Knopf, 2004. Print.PG20.&lt;/ref&gt; Like all of his siblings, Jack was expected to work.&lt;ref name="Ward, Geoffrey C 2004. PG20"/&gt;

Although Johnson grew up in the South, he said that segregation was not an issue in the somewhat secluded city of Galveston, as everyone living in the 12th Ward was poor and went through the same struggles.&lt;ref name="Ward, Geoffrey C 2004. PG.21"&gt;Ward, Geoffrey C. Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. New York: A.A. Knopf, 2004. Print.PG.21&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson remembers growing up with a "gang" of white boys, in which he never felt victimized or excluded. Remembering his childhood, Johnson said: "As I grew up, the white boys were my friends and my pals. I ate with them, played with them and slept at their homes. Their mothers gave me cookies, and I ate at their tables. No one ever taught me that white men were superior to me."&lt;ref name="Ward, Geoffrey C 2004. PG.21"/&gt;

Johnson was a frail young boy.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Geoffrey C. Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. New York: A.A. Knopf, 2004. Print.PG21&lt;/ref&gt;

After Johnson quit school, he began a job working at the local docks. He made several other attempts at working other jobs around town until one day he made his way to Dallas, finding work at the race track exercising horses. Jack stuck with this job until he found a new apprenticeship for a carriage painter by the name of Walter Lewis. Lewis enjoyed watching friends spar, and Johnson began to learn how to box.&lt;ref name="Ward, Geoffrey C 2004. PG23"&gt;Ward, Geoffrey C. Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. New York: A.A. Knopf, 2004. Print.PG23&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson later claimed that it was thanks to Lewis that he became a boxer.&lt;ref name="Ward, Geoffrey C 2004. PG24"&gt;Ward, Geoffrey C. Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. New York: A.A. Knopf, 2004. Print.PG24&lt;/ref&gt;

At 16, Johnson moved to Manhattan and found living arrangements with [[Barbados Joe Walcott]], a welterweight fighter from the West Indies.&lt;ref name="Ward, Geoffrey C 2004. PG24"/&gt; Johnson again found work exercising horses for the local stable, until he was fired for exhausting a horse. On his return to Galveston, he soon found employment as a janitor at a gym owned by German-born heavyweight fighter Herman Bernau. Johnson eventually put away enough money to buy two pairs of boxing gloves, sparring every chance he got.&lt;ref name="Ward, Geoffrey C 2004. PG26"&gt;Ward, Geoffrey C. Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. New York: A.A. Knopf, 2004. Print.PG26&lt;/ref&gt;

Returning home from Manhattan, Johnson had a fight with Davie Pearson. Johnson remembers Pearson as a "grown and toughened" man who accused Johnson of turning him in to the police over a game of craps.  When both of them were released from jail, they met at the docks and Johnson beat Pearson before a large crowd.&lt;ref name="Ward, Geoffrey C 2004. PG26"/&gt; Johnson fought in a summer league against a man named John "Must Have It" Lee. Because prize fighting was illegal in Texas, the fight was broken up and moved to the beach where Johnson won his first fight and a prize of one dollar and fifty cents.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Geoffrey C. Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson. New York: A.A. Knopf, 2004. Print.PG28&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early boxing career==
Johnson made his debut as a professional boxer on November 1, 1898, in Galveston, Texas, when he [[Knockout|knocked out]] Charley Brooks in the second round of a 15-round bout for what was billed as "The Texas State Middleweight Title". In his third pro fight on May 8, 1899, he battled "Klondike" (John W. Haynes or Haines), an African American heavyweight known as "The Black Hercules", in Chicago. Klondike (so called as he was considered a rarity, like the gold in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]]), who had declared himself the "Black Heavyweight Champ", won on a [[technical knockout]] (TKO) in the fifth round of a scheduled six-rounder. The two fighters met again in 1900, with the first contest resulting in a draw as both fighters were on their feet at the end of 20 rounds. Johnson won the second fight by a TKO when Klondike refused to come out for the 14th round. Johnson did not claim Klondike's unrecognized title.

===Joe Choynski===
[[File:JohnsonChoy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Johnson standing behind Choynski in Chicago in 1909]]
On February 25, 1901, Johnson fought [[Joe Choynski]] in Galveston. Choynski, a popular and experienced heavyweight, knocked out Johnson in the third round. [[Prizefighting]] was illegal in Texas at the time and they were both arrested. [[Bail]] was set at $5,000 which neither could afford. The sheriff permitted both fighters to go home at night so long as they agreed to spar in the jail cell. Large crowds gathered to watch the sessions. After 23 days in jail, their bail was reduced to an affordable level and a grand jury refused to indict either man. However, Johnson later stated that he learned his boxing skills during that jail time. The two would remain friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =The Making of Jack Johnson |last=Kroger |first=Bill |date=March 2012 |journal=Texas Bar Journal |volume=75 |issue=9 |page=206 |location=Austin, TX |publisher=State Bar of Texas |editor1-first=Michelle |editor1-last=Hunter }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson attests that his success in boxing came from the coaching he received from Choynski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xcfef_d2es4C&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage|title=The Big Book of Jewish Sports Heroes|publisher=Books.google.com.au|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0Tp3W1PWkAC&amp;pg=PA31 |title=Boxing in San Francisco|publisher=Books.google.com.au|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aging Choynski saw natural talent and determination in Johnson and taught him the nuances of defense, stating "A man who can move like you should never have to take a punch".&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;

==Boxing style==
Throughout his career Johnson  built a unique fighting style of his own, which was not customary to boxing during this time. Though Jack would typically strike first, he would fight defensively, waiting for his opponents to tire out, while becoming more aggressive as the rounds went on. He often fought to punish his opponents through the rounds rather than knocking them out, and would continuously dodge their punches.  He would then quickly strike back with a blow of his own. Jack often made his fights look effortless, and as if he had much more to offer, but when pushed he could also display some powerful moves and punches. There are films of his fights in which he can be seen holding up his opponent, who otherwise might have fallen, until he recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xpgx2_jack-johnson-vs-stanley-ketchel-190_sport|title=Jack Johnson vs Stanley Ketchel 1909|author=TheHomelessDetective|work=Dailymotion|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUdoGBkeqWQ|title=Sam Langford: The Boston Terror.wmv|work=YouTube|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His style of playing with his opponents was very effective, but his style was also criticized by the press as being a cowardly fighting approach. In contrast, world heavyweight champion "Gentleman" [[James J. Corbett|Jim Corbett]] had used many of the same techniques a decade earlier, and was praised by the press as "the cleverest man in boxing".&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt;

==Top contender==
Johnson beat former black heavyweight champ [[Frank Childs]] on October 21, 1902. Childs had twice won the black heavyweight title and continued to claim himself the true black champ despite having lost his title in a bout with [[George Byers (boxer)|George Byers]] and then, after retaking the title from Byers, losing it again to [[Ed Martin (boxer)|Denver Ed Martin]]. He still made pretence to being the black champ and claimed the unrecognized black heavyweight title as well. Johnson won by a TKO in the 12th round of the scheduled 20-rounder, when Childs's seconds signaled he couldn't go on. (He claimed he had dislocated his elbow.) The defeat by Johnson forever ended Childs's pretensions to the black heavyweight crown.

==World colored heavyweight champ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2012}}
[[File:Jack Johnson cph.3b19117.jpg|thumb|Johnson in 1908 in a photograph by [[Otto Sarony]]]]
By 1903, though Johnson's official record showed him with nine wins against three losses, five draws and two no contests, he had won at least 50 fights against both white and black opponents. Johnson won his first title on February 3, 1903, beating Denver Ed Martin on points in a 20-round match for the [[World Colored Heavyweight Championship]]. Johnson held the title until it was vacated when he won the world heavyweight title from [[Tommy Burns (boxer)|Tommy Burns]] in Sydney, Australia on [[Boxing Day]] 1908.
His reign of 2,151 days was the third longest in the 60-year-long history of the colored heavyweight title. Only [[Harry Wills]] at 3,103 days and [[Peter Jackson (boxer)|Peter Jackson]] at 3,041 days held the title longer.  A three-time colored heavyweight champion, Wills held the title for a total of 3,351 days.

Johnson defended the colored heavyweight title 17 times, which was second only to the 26 times Wills defended the title. While colored champ, he defeated ex-colored champs Denver Ed Martin and Frank Childs again and beat future colored heavyweight champs [[Sam McVey]] three times and [[Sam Langford]] once. He beat Langford on points in a 15-rounder and never gave him another shot at the title, either when he was colored champ or the world heavyweight champ.

===Johnson, Jeanette and Langford===
Johnson fought Joe Jeanette a total of seven times, all during his reign as colored champ before he became the world's heavyweight champion, winning four times and drawing twice (three of the victories and one draw were [[newspaper decision]]s). In their first match in 1905, they had fought to a draw, but in their second match on November 25, 1905, Johnson lost as he was disqualified in the second round of a scheduled six-round fight. Johnson continued to claim the title because of the disqualification.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

After Johnson became the first African-American Heavyweight Champion of the World on December 26, 1908, his World Colored Heavyweight Championship was vacated. Jeanette fought Sam McVey for the title in Paris on February 20, 1909 and was beaten, but later took the title from McVey in a 49-round bout on April 17 of that year in Paris for a $6,000 purse. Sam Langford subsequently claimed the title during Jeanette's reign after Johnson refused to defend the World Heavyweight Championship against him. Eighteen months later, Jeanette lost the title to Langford.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

During his reign as world champ, Johnson never again fought Jeanette despite numerous challenges and avoided Langford, who won the colored title a record five times. Johnson had fought Langford once while he was the colored champ and beaten him on points in a 15-rounder.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

On November 27, 1945, Johnson finally stepped back into the ring with Joe Jeanette. The 67-year-old Johnson squared off against the 66-year-old Jeanette in an exhibition held at a New York City rally to sell war bonds. Fellow former colored heavyweight champ [[Harry Wills]] also participated in the exhibition.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==World heavyweight champion==
Johnson's efforts to win the world heavyweight title were thwarted, as [[List of lineal boxing world champions#Heavyweight|world heavyweight]] champion [[James J. Jeffries]] refused to face him then. Black boxers could meet white boxers in other competitions, but the world heavyweight championship was off limits to them.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

However, Johnson did fight former champion [[Bob Fitzsimmons]] in July 1907, and knocked him out in two rounds.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt; There is a report{{where|date=October 2018}} that Johnson even fought and KO'd Jim Jeffries' brother Jack, and taunted him about it to force a fight, with no success.

Johnson finally won the [[List of lineal boxing world champions#Heavyweight|world heavyweight]] title on December 26, 1908, a full six years after lightweight champion [[Joe Gans]] became the first African American boxing champion. Johnson's victory over the reigning world champion, Canadian [[Tommy Burns (boxer)|Tommy Burns]], in [[Sydney]], Australia, came after stalking Burns around the world for two years and taunting him in the press for a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saddoboxing.com/boxing-article/Jack-Johnson-v-Tommy-Burns.html|title=Boxing Classics Jack Johnson v Tommy Burns December 26, 1908|publisher=Saddoboxing.com|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Burns had agreed to fight Johnson only after promotors guaranteed him $30,000.&lt;ref name="biography.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Johnson Biography|url=http://www.biography.com/people/jack-johnson-9355980 |accessdate=November 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fight lasted fourteen rounds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ringtv.craveonline.com/blog/120099-100-years-since-Jack-johnson-made-history|title=100 years since Jack Johnson made history|date=December 28, 2008|work=Ring TV|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being stopped by the police in front of over 20,000 spectators. The title was awarded to Johnson on a referee's decision.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Jack Johnson March 1909 Vancouver.jpg|thumb|Jack Johnson arriving in Vancouver BC on March 9, 1909 as World Heavyweight Champion]]

After Johnson's victory over Burns, racial animosity among whites ran so deep that it was called out for a "[[James J. Jeffries|Great White Hope]]" to take the title away from Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014275.html|title=ESPN.com: Johnson boxed, lived on own terms|publisher=Espn.go.com|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Johnson was heavyweight champion, he was covered more in the press than all other notable black men combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/unforgivableblackness/rebel/|title=Unforgivable Blackness . Jack Johnson: Rebel of the Progressive Era - PBS|publisher=Pbs.org|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Brown |first=Eric |title=New push to pardon boxing legend Jack Johnson |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/04/06/new_push_to_pardon_boxing_legend_jack_johnson_partner/ |publisher=International Business Times |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead-up to the bout was peppered with racist press against Johnson. Even the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote of the event, "If the black man wins, thousands and thousands of his ignorant brothers will misinterpret his victory as justifying claims to much more than mere physical equality with their white neighbors." As title holder, Johnson thus had to face a series of fighters each billed by boxing promoters as a "great white hope", often in [[Exhibition game|exhibition matches]]. In 1909, he beat Tony Ross, Al Kaufman, and the middleweight champion [[Stanley Ketchel]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The match with Ketchel was originally thought to have been an exhibition, and in fact it was fought by both men that way, until the 12th round, when Ketchel threw a right to Johnson's head, knocking him down. Quickly regaining his feet, and very annoyed, Johnson immediately dashed straight at Ketchell and threw a single punch, an uppercut, a punch for which he was famous, to Ketchel's jaw, knocking him out. The punch knocked out Ketchell's front teeth; Johnson can be seen on film removing them from his glove, where they had been embedded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://boxrec.com/media/index.php/Jack_Johnson_vs._Stanley_Ketchel |date=October 16, 1909 |title=Jack Johnson 205½ lbs beat Stanley Ketchel 170¼ lbs by KO in round 12 of 20 |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Fight of the Century"===
[[File:Johnson jeff.jpg|right|thumb|[[James J. Jeffries]] fights Johnson in 1910]] In 1910, former undefeated heavyweight champion [[James J. Jeffries]] came out of retirement to challenge Johnson. He had not fought in six years and had to lose well over 100 pounds to get back to his championship fighting weight. Initially Jeffries had no interest in the fight, being quite happy as an alfalfa farmer. But those who wanted to see Johnson defeated badgered Jeffries mercilessly for months, and offered him an unheard sum of money, reputed to be about $120,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|0.12|1910|r=1|fmt=c}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) to which he finally accepted without protest.&lt;ref name="RR"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jack Johnson vs James Jeffries Race Riots |date=July 4, 1910 |url=http://able2know.org/topic/196794-1 |publisher=Able2know.org |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffries remained mostly hidden from media attention until the day of the fight, while Johnson soaked up the spotlight. [[John L. Sullivan]], who made boxing championships a popular and esteemed spectacle, stated that Johnson was in such good physical shape compared to Jeffries that he could lose only if he had a lack of skill on the day. Before the fight, Jeffries remarked, "It is my intention to go right after my opponent and knock him out as soon as possible." While his wife added, "I'm not interested in prizefighting but I am interested in my husband's welfare, I do hope this will be his last fight." Johnson's words were "May the best man win."&lt;ref name="RR"/&gt;

Racial tension was brewing leading up to the fight and to prevent any harm to either boxer, guns were prohibited within the arena as were the sale of alcohol and anyone under the effects of alcohol. Behind the racial attitudes being instigated by the media was a major investment in gambling for the fight with 10–7 odds in favor of Jeffries.&lt;ref name="RR"/&gt;

The fight took place on July 4, 1910, in front of 20,000 people, at a ring built just for the occasion in downtown [[Reno, Nevada]]. Jeffries proved unable to impose his will on the younger champion and Johnson dominated the fight. By the 15th round, after Jeffries had been knocked down twice for the first time in his career, Jeffries' corner [[Submission (combat sports)|threw in the towel]] to end the fight and prevent Jeffries from having a knockout on his record. Johnson later remarked he knew the fight was over in the 4th round when he landed an [[uppercut]] and saw the look on Jeffries face, stating, "I knew what that look meant. The old ship was sinking." Afterwards, Jeffries was humbled by the loss and what he'd seen of Johnson in their match. "I could never have whipped Johnson at my best", Jeffries said. "I couldn't have hit him. No, I couldn't have reached him in 1,000 years."&lt;ref name="biography.com"/&gt;

The "Fight of the Century" earned Johnson $65,000 (over ${{Inflation|US|0.065|1910|r=1|fmt=c}} million in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars) and silenced the critics, who had belittled Johnson's previous victory over Tommy Burns as "empty", claiming that Burns was a false champion since Jeffries had retired undefeated. [[John L. Sullivan]] commented after the fight that Johnson won deservedly, fairly, and convincingly:

{{quote|The fight of the century is over and a black man is the undisputed champion of the world. It was a poor fight as fights go, this less than 15-round affair between James J. Jeffries and Jack Johnson. Scarcely has there ever been a championship contest that was so one-sided. All of Jeffries much-vaunted condition amounted to nothing. He wasn't in it from the first bell tap to the last&amp;nbsp;... The negro had few friends, but there was little demonstration against him. (Spectators) could not help but admire Johnson because he is the type of prizefighter that is admired by sportsmen. He played fairly at all times and fought fairly.&amp;nbsp;... What a crafty, powerful, cunning left hand (Johnson) has. He is one of the craftiest, cunningest boxers that ever stepped into the ring.&amp;nbsp;... They both fought closely all during the 15 rounds. It was just the sort of fight that Jeffries wanted. There was no running or ducking like Corbett did with me in New Orleans (1892). Jeffries did not miss so many blows, because he hardly started any. Johnson was on top of him all the time.... (Johnson) didn't get gay at all with Jeffries in the beginning, and it was always the white man who clinched, but Johnson was very careful, and he backed away and took no chances, and was good-natured with it all&amp;nbsp;... The best man won, and I was one of the first to congratulate him, and also one of the first to extend my heartfelt sympathy to the beaten man.&lt;ref name="Sullivan" /&gt;}}

====Riots and aftermath====
[[File:LA Times, 7 July 1910.png|thumb|''The LA Times'' noted the explosive nature of Johnson's victory by featuring this cartoon in which a stick of dynamite suggests that it would not have caused as much violence as the fight did.]]
The outcome of the fight triggered [[Mass racial violence in the United States|race riots]] that evening—the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]]—all across the United States, from Texas and [[Colorado]] to New York and Washington, D.C. Johnson's victory over Jeffries had dashed white dreams of finding a "great white hope" to defeat him. Many whites felt humiliated by the defeat of Jeffries.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt;

Blacks, on the other hand, were jubilant, and celebrated Johnson's great victory as a victory for racial advancement. Black poet [[William Waring Cuney]] later highlighted the black reaction to the fight in his poem "My Lord, What a Morning".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pool|first1=Rosey E.|title=Beyond the blues: new poems by American Negroes|publisher=Hand and Flower Press|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Beyond_the_blues.html?id=havoAAAAIAAJ|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the country, blacks held spontaneous parades and gathered in prayer meetings.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Race riots erupted in New York, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New Orleans, Atlanta, St. Louis, Little Rock and Houston. In all, riots occurred in more than 25 states and 50 cities. At least twenty people were killed across the US from the riots,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/305329/contributors |title=Contributors: Jack Johnson (American boxer) |work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hundreds more were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042462/1910-07-05/ed-1/seq-1/;words=Uvaldia?date1=07%2F01%2F1910&amp;date2=07%2F30%2F1910&amp;searchType=advanced&amp;language=&amp;proxdistance=5&amp;state=&amp;rows=20&amp;ortext=&amp;proxtext=Uvaldia&amp;phrasetext=&amp;andtext=&amp;dateFilterType=range&amp;index=0|title=Los Angeles herald [microform].

====Film of the bout====
 {{Details|The Johnson-Jeffries Fight}}
''[[The Johnson-Jeffries Fight]]'' film received more public attention in the United States than any other film to date and for the next five years, until the release of ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]''.&lt;ref name=cinema&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9cc71Uekc_EC&amp;pg=PA502 |date=August 1, 2004 |title=Encyclopedia of Early Cinema |isbn=9780415234405 |author1=Abel |first1=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, many states and cities banned the exhibition of the Johnson-Jeffries film. The movement to [[Censorship|censor]] Johnson's victory took over the country within three days after the fight.&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=1563863 |title=The Johnson-Jeffries Fight and Censorship of Black Supremacy |publisher=Ssrn.com |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a spontaneous movement.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Two weeks after the match former President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], an avid boxer and fan, wrote an article for ''[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]]'' in which he supported banning not just moving pictures of boxing matches, but a complete ban on all prize fights in the US. He cited the "crookedness" and gambling that surrounded such contests and that moving pictures have "introduced a new method of money getting and of demoralization".&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"/&gt; The controversy surrounding the film directly&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt; motivated Congress to ban distribution of all prizefight films across state lines in 1912; the ban was lifted in 1940.

In 2005, the film of the Jeffries-Johnson "Fight of the Century" was entered into the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being worthy of preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2005.html |title=National Film Registry 2005: Films Selected to the National Film Registry (National Film Preservation Board, Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |accessdate=November 27, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208150126/http://www.loc.gov/film/nfr2005.html |archivedate= February 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six fights for which the major films were made, starring Johnson, were:&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

* Johnson-Ketchel (film released in 1909)&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

* Johnson-Willard (film released in 1915)&lt;ref name=cinema/&gt;

===Maintaining the color bar===
The color bar remained in force even under Johnson. Once he was the world's heavyweight champ, Johnson did not fight a black opponent for the first five years of his reign. He denied matches to black heavyweights [[Joe Jeanette]] (one of his successors as colored heavyweight champ), [[Sam Langford]] (who beat Jeanette for the colored title), and the young [[Harry Wills]], who was colored heavyweight champ during the last year of Johnson's reign as world's heavyweight champ.

Blacks were not given a chance at the title allegedly because Johnson felt that he could make more money fighting white boxers. In August 1913, as Johnson neared the end of his troubled reign as world heavyweight champ, there were rumors that he had agreed to fight Langford in Paris for the title, but it came to nought. Johnson said that Langford was unable to raise $30,000 for his guarantee.

Because black boxers with the exception of Johnson had been barred from fighting for the heavyweight championship because of racism, Johnson's refusal to fight African-Americans offended the African-American community, since the opportunity to fight top white boxers was rare. Jeanette criticized Johnson, saying, "Jack forgot about his old friends after he became champion and drew the color line against his own people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rosero |first=Jessica|title=Native sons and daughters North Hudson native and 20th century boxing sensation Joe Jeanette |url=http://www.hudsonreporter.com/view/full_story/2407742/article-Native-sons-and-daughters-North-Hudson-native-and-20th-century-boxing-sensation-Joe-Jeanette? |publisher=Hudson Reporter |accessdate=May 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Johnson v. Johnson====
When Johnson finally did agree to take on a black opponent in late 1913, it was not to Sam Langford, the current colored heavyweight champ, that he gave the title shot. Instead, Johnson chose [[Jim Johnson (boxer)|Battling Jim Johnson]], a lesser boxer who, in 1910, had lost to Langford and had a draw and loss via KO to Sam McVey, the former colored champ. Battling Jim fought former colored champ Joe Jeanette four times between July 19, 1912 and January 21, 1913 and lost all four fights. The only fighter of note he did beat in that period was future colored champ [[Bill Tate (boxer)|Big Bill Tate]], whom he KO-ed in the second round of a scheduled 10-round bout. It was Tate's third pro fight.

In November 1913, the [[International Boxing Union (1913–1946)|International Boxing Union]] had declared the world heavyweight title held by Jack Johnson to be vacant.
The fight, scheduled for 10 rounds, was held on December 19, 1913 in Paris. It was the first time in history that two blacks had fought for the world heavyweight championship.

While the Johnson v. Johnson fight had been billed as a world heavyweight title match, in many ways, it resembled an exhibition. A sportswriter from the ''[[Indianapolis Star]]'' at the fight reported that the crowd became unruly when it was apparent that neither boxer was putting up a fight.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Jack Johnson, the heavyweight champion, and Battling Jim Johnson, another colored pugilist, of Galveston, Texas, met in a 10-round contest here tonight, which ended in a draw. The spectators loudly protested throughout that the men were not fighting, and demanded their money back. Many of them left the hall. The organizers of the fight explained the fiasco by asserting that Jack Johnson's left arm was broken in the third round. There is no confirmation of a report that Jack Johnson had been stabbed and no evidence at the ringside of such an accident. During the first three rounds he was obviously playing with his opponent. After that it was observed that he was only using his right hand. When the fight was over he complained that his arm had been injured. Doctors who made an examination, certified to a slight fracture of the radius of the left arm. The general opinion is that his arm was injured in a wrestling match early in the week, and that a blow tonight caused the fracture of the bone.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Colored Heavyweight Championship]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{excessive quote|date=June 2016}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of the draw, Jack Johnson kept his championship. After the fight, he explained that his left arm was injured in the third round and he could not use it.

===Title loss===
[[File:Panorama of Willard - Johnson fight, Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|center|800px|Panorama of Willard - Johnson fight, Havana, Cuba]]
On April 5, 1915, Johnson lost his title to [[Jess Willard]], a working cowboy from Kansas who started boxing when he was twenty-seven years old. With a crowd of 25,000 at [[Oriental Park Racetrack]] in [[Havana, Cuba]], Johnson was knocked out in the 26th round of the scheduled 45 round fight. Johnson, although having won almost every round, began to tire after the 20th round, and was visibly hurt by heavy body punches from Willard in rounds preceding the 26th-round knockout.

Johnson is said by many to have spread rumors that he took a [[Match fixing#History|dive]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1070658/3/index.htm|title=As fugitive, loser, prisoner and failure, Jack Johnson - 06.22.59 com (1959-06-22). Retrieved on 2010-10-26.|work=SI.com|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Willard is widely regarded as having won the fight outright. Many people thought Johnson purposely threw the fight because Willard was white, in an effort to have his Mann Act charges dropped. Willard said, "If he was going to throw the fight, I wish he'd done it sooner. It was hotter than hell out there."

===Post-championship===
After losing his world heavyweight championship, Johnson never again fought for the colored heavyweight crown.{{clarify|date=July 2012}}  His popularity remained strong enough that he recorded for [[Ajax Records]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= American Record Labels and Companies - An Encyclopedia (1891-1943)|last1= Sutton|first1= Allan|last2= Nauck|first2=Kurt|year= 2000|publisher= Mainspring Press|location= Denver, Colorado|isbn= 0-9671819-0-9|pages= 3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson continued fighting, but age was catching up with him. He fought professionally until 1938 at age 60 when he lost 7 of his last 9 bouts, losing his final fight to Walter Price by a 7th-round TKO. It is often suggested that any bouts after the age of 40—which was a very venerable age for boxing in those days—not be counted on his actual record, since he was performing in order to make a living. He also indulged in what was known as "cellar" fighting, where the bouts, unadvertised, were fought for private audiences, usually in cellars, or other unrecognized places. There are photographs existing of one of these fights. Johnson made his final ring appearance at age 67 on November 27, 1945, fighting three one-minute exhibition rounds against two opponents, [[Joe Jeanette]] and John Ballcort, in a benefit fight card for U.S. War Bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/jjohn.htm |title=Cyber Boxing Zone -- Jack Johnson |publisher=Cyberboxingzone.com |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Fqod-seL8gw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[Image:Jack Johnson boxer.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Jack Johnson, circa 1910-1915]]
Johnson earned considerable sums endorsing various products, including patent medicines, and had several expensive hobbies such as automobile racing and tailored clothing, as well as purchasing jewelry and furs for his wives.&lt;ref&gt;Papa Jack, Jack Johnson and the Era of the White Hopes, Randy Roberts, Macmillan, 1983, page 132.&lt;/ref&gt; He challenged champion racer [[Barney Oldfield]] to a match auto race at the [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]] dirt track. Oldfield easily out-distanced Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Barney Oldfield, The Life and Times of America's Speed King, William Nolan, Brown Fox Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Once, when he was pulled over for a $50 speeding ticket, he gave the officer a $100 bill; when the officer protested that he couldn't make change for that much, Johnson told him to keep the change as he was going to make his return trip at the same speed.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt; In 1920, Johnson opened a night club in [[Harlem, Manhattan|Harlem]]; he sold it three years later to a gangster, [[Owney Madden]], who renamed it the [[Cotton Club (New York City)|Cotton Club]].

Johnson's behavior was looked down upon by the African-American community, especially by the black scholar [[Booker T. Washington]] who said it "is unfortunate that a man with money should use it in a way to injure his own people, in the eyes of those who are seeking to uplift his race and improve its conditions, I wish to say emphatically that Jack Johnson's actions did not meet my personal approval and I am sure they do not meet with the approval of the colored race."

Johnson flouted conventions regarding the social and economic "place" of blacks in American society. As a black man, he broke a powerful taboo in consorting with white women and would verbally taunt men (both white and black) inside and outside the ring. Asked the secret of his staying power by a reporter who had watched a succession of women parade into, and out of, the champion's hotel room, Johnson supposedly said "Eat [[jellied eels]] and think distant thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;Stump, Al. 'The rowdy reign of the Black avenger'. ''True: The Men's Magazine'' January 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911 Johnson, through an acquaintance, attempted to become a [[Freemason]] in [[Dundee]]. Although he was admitted as a member of the Forfar and Kincardine Lodge No 225 in the city, there was considerable opposition to his membership, principally on the grounds of his race, and the Forfarshire Lodge was suspended by the Grand Lodge of Scotland. Johnson's fees were returned to him and his admission was ruled illegal.&lt;ref name=Contact&gt;{{cite journal|title=News from the archives|journal=Contact|date=June 2009|page=28|url=http://www.dundee.ac.uk/pressoffice/contact/2009/june2009.pdf|accessdate=August 15, 2013|publisher=University of Dundee|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002044125/http://www.dundee.ac.uk/pressoffice/contact/2009/june2009.pdf|archivedate=October 2, 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson wrote two memoirs of his life: ''Mes combats'' in 1914 and ''Jack Johnson in the Ring and Out'' in 1927.&lt;ref name="inventors.about.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/blwrench1.htm|title=Jack Johnson|publisher=Inventors.about.com|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Johnson attended at least one service at the Angelus Temple in Los Angeles, California.  In a public conversion, while Detroit, Michigan, burned in race riots, he professed his faith to [[Christ]] in a service conducted by evangelist [[Aimee Semple McPherson]].  She embraced him as "he raised his hand in worship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/04/30/070430crbo_books_updike |title=Famous Aimee |accessdate=November 14, 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222212652/http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/04/30/070430crbo_books_updike |archivedate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Matthew.

===Marriages===
[[File:Jack Johnson and his wife Etta LCCN2011649815 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Johnson with his wife Etta, who killed herself in 1912]]

Johnson engaged in various relationships including three documented marriages. All of his wives were white. At the height of his career, Johnson was excoriated by the press for his flashy lifestyle and for having married white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/305329/|title=Jack Johnson|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Johnson's 1927 autobiography, he married Mary Austin, a black woman from Galveston, Texas. No record exists of this marriage.&lt;ref name="WOMEN" /&gt;

While in Philadelphia in 1903, Johnson met Clara Kerr, a black prostitute. According to Johnson's autobiography, Kerr left him for Johnson's friend, a racehorse trainer named William Bryant. They took Johnson's jewelry and clothing when they left. Johnson tracked the couple down and had Kerr arrested on burglary charges. Johnson and Kerr reconciled for a while before she left him again.&lt;ref name="WOMEN" /&gt;

During a three-month tour of Australia in 1907, Johnson had a brief affair with Alma "Lola" Toy, a white woman from Sydney. Johnson confirmed to an American journalist that he intended to marry Toy. When ''[[The Referee (newspaper)|The Referee]]'' printed Johnson's plans to marry Toy, it caused controversy in Sydney. Toy demanded a retraction and later won a libel lawsuit from the newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jack Johnson, Rebel Sojourner: Boxing in the Shadow of the Global Color Line|last=Runstedtler|first=Theresa|publisher=University of California Press|year=2013|isbn=9780520280113|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning from Australia, Johnson said that "the heartaches which Mary Austin and Clara Kerr caused me led me to forswear colored women and to determine that my lot henceforth would be cast only with white women."&lt;ref name="WOMEN" /&gt;

Johnson met Etta Terry Duryea, a Brooklyn socialite and former wife of Clarence Duryea, at a car race in 1909. In 1910, Johnson hired a private investigator to follow Duryea after suspecting she was having an affair with his chauffeur. On Christmas Day, Johnson confronted Duryea and beat her so badly she was hospitalized. They reconciled and were married in January 1911. Prone to depression, her condition worsened because of Johnson's abuse and infidelity. She committed suicide in September 1912, shooting herself.&lt;ref name="WOMEN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/unforgivableblackness/knockout/women.html|title=Jack's women|publisher=Pbs.org|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pugilist Says Wife Twice Saved Him|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2051003/pugilist_says_wife_twice_saved_him/|work=The Gazette Times|location=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|date=September 13, 1912|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On December 4, 1912, Johnson married Lucille Cameron. Cameron divorced him in 1924 because of infidelity.

The next year, Johnson married Irene Pineau. When asked by a reporter at Johnson's funeral what she had loved about him, she replied, "I loved him because of his courage. He faced the world unafraid. There wasn't anybody or anything he feared."&lt;ref name="WOMEN"/&gt;

===Prison sentence===
[[File:Jack Johnson and wife Lucille LCCN98510494 (cropped 2).jpg|thumb|left|Johnson with his wife Lucille in 1921. Their relationship led to Johnson's first 1912 arrest.]]
On October 18, 1912, Johnson was arrested on the grounds that his relationship with Lucille Cameron violated the [[Mann Act]] against "transporting women across state lines for immoral purposes" due to her being an alleged prostitute. Her mother also swore that her daughter was insane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Arrest Jack Johnson For Abducting Girl |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2051090/arrest_jack_johnson_for_abducting_girl/ |work=The York Daily |location=York, Pennsylvania |date=October 19, 1912 |page=1 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cameron, soon to become his second wife, refused to cooperate and the case fell apart. Less than a month later, Johnson was arrested again on similar charges. This time, the woman, another alleged prostitute named Belle Schreiber,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/sports/jack-johnson-pardon-trump.html|title=Trump Expected to Pardon Jack Johnson as Heavyweight Champions Gather|date=2018-05-24|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had been involved in 1909 and 1910, testified against him. In the courtroom of [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]], the future [[Commissioner of Baseball (MLB)|Commissioner of Baseball]] who perpetuated the [[baseball color line]] until his death, Johnson was convicted by an [[all-white jury]] in June 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014275.html|title=ESPN.com: Johnson boxed, lived on own terms|publisher=Espn.go.com |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that the incidents used to convict him took place before passage of the Mann Act.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt; He was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.

Johnson skipped bail and left the country, joining Lucille in [[Montreal]] on June 25, before fleeing to France. To flee to Canada, Johnson posed as a member of a black baseball team. For the next seven years, they lived in exile in Europe, South America and Mexico. Johnson returned to the U.S. on July 20, 1920. He surrendered to federal agents at the Mexican border and was sent to the [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth]] to serve his sentence in September 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dbs.ohiohistory.org/africanam/page1.cfm?ItemID=9839 |title=Cleveland Advocate 2 October 1920 |publisher=Dbs.ohiohistory.org |accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on July 9, 1921.&lt;ref name=Burns/&gt;

==== Presidential pardon ====
There have been recurring proposals to grant Johnson a posthumous [[presidential pardon]]. A bill requesting President [[George W. Bush]] to pardon Johnson in 2008 passed the House,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=House seeks presidential pardon for boxing champ |work=[[The Argus-Press]] |agency=Associated Press |date=September 27, 2008 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xYkxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=s6kFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6150,1822850 |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but failed to pass in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Senate urges Obama to pardon former champ |work=[[Lodi News-Sentinel]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=June 25, 2009 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ssI0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XSEGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4335,4609887 |accessdate=August 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2009, Senator [[John McCain]], along with Representative [[Peter T.

[[Mike Tyson]], [[Harry Reid]] and [[John McCain]] lent their support to the campaign, starting a [[Change.org]] petition asking President Obama to posthumously pardon the world's first African-American boxing champion of his racially motivated 1913 felony conviction.&lt;ref name="IBT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/04/06/new_push_to_pardon_boxing_legend_jack_johnson_partner/ |title=New push to pardon boxing legend Jack Johnson |author=Eric Brown |date=April 7, 2013 |work=Salon.com |accessdate=August 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, President [[Donald Trump]] announced that he was considering a full pardon of Johnson after speaking with actor [[Sylvester Stallone]].&lt;ref name=Politico20180421&gt;{{cite web |last1=Griffiths |first1=Brent D. |title=Trump says he's 'considering' a pardon for boxer Jack Johnson |url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/21/trump-pardon-jack-johnson-boxer-544930 |publisher=Politico |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180422031538/https://www.politico.com/story/2018/04/21/trump-pardon-jack-johnson-boxer-544930 |archivedate=April 22, 2018 |date=April 21, 2018 | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump pardoned Johnson on May 24 of that year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Death===
On June 10, 1946, Johnson died in a car crash on [[U.S. Route 1 in North Carolina|U.S. Highway 1]] near [[Franklinton, North Carolina|Franklinton]], [[North Carolina]] a small town near [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], after racing angrily from a [[diner]] that refused to serve him.&lt;ref name="Internet Archive"/&gt; He was taken to the closest black hospital, [[St. Augustine's College (Raleigh)|Saint Agnes Hospital]] in Raleigh. He was 68 years old at the time of his death. He was buried next to Etta Duryea Johnson at [[Graceland Cemetery]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=FAG/&gt; His grave was initially unmarked, and then marked with a large stone that bore only the name "Johnson." &lt;ref&gt;https://billiongraves.com/grave/John-A-Jack-Johnson/19737283&lt;/ref&gt; This changed after 2005 and the film by Ken Burns. Johnson's (new, smaller) stone reads [top] "Jack / John A. Johnson / 1878-1946" [front] "First black heavyweight / champion of the world". Johnson's signature is on the back of the stone. Etta's stone, which matches his, is next to it. The stone marked "Johnson" once stood above the plots of Jack, Etta, and Irene Pineau.&lt;ref name=FAG/&gt;

==Legacy==
Johnson was an inaugural 1954 inductee to ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' magazine's [[The Ring magazine Hall of Fame|Boxing Hall of Fame]] (disbanded in 1987), and was inducted to the [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] in 1993. In 2005, the United States [[National Film Preservation Board]] deemed the film of the 1910 Johnson-Jeffries fight "historically significant" and put it in the [[National Film Registry]].

During his boxing career, Jack Johnson fought 114 fights, winning 80 matches, 45 by knockouts.&lt;ref name="inventors.about.com"/&gt;

Johnson's skill as a fighter and the money that it brought made it impossible for him to be ignored by the establishment. In the short term, the boxing world reacted against Johnson's legacy. But Johnson foreshadowed one of the most famous boxers of all time, [[Muhammad Ali]]. In fact, Ali often spoke of how he was influenced by Jack Johnson. Ali identified with Johnson because he felt America ostracized him in the same manner because of his opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and affiliation with the [[Nation of Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biographyonline.net/sport/muhammad_ali.html|title=Muhammad Ali Biography|work=Biography Online|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, scholar [[Molefi Kete Asante]] listed Jack Johnson on his list of [[100 Greatest African Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;Asante, Molefi Kete (2002). 100 Greatest African Americans: A Biographical Encyclopedia. Amherst, New York. Prometheus Books. {{ISBN|1-57392-963-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the City of Galveston dedicated a park in Johnson's memory as Galveston Island's most famous native son. The park, called Jack Johnson Park, includes a life-size, bronze statue of Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galvestondailynews.com/story/361210/ |title=Jack Johnson Park a tribute to famous BOI |accessdate=November 11, 2012 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114010232/http://galvestondailynews.com/story/361210/ |archivedate=November 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's story is the basis of the play and subsequent 1970 movie ''[[The Great White Hope (film)|The Great White Hope]],'' starring [[James Earl Jones]] as Johnson (known as Jack Jefferson in the movie), and [[Jane Alexander]] as his love interest.  Both Jones and Alexander were nominated for Oscars.  (Retrieved from the sleeve.  "The Great White Hope."  Netflix DVD.  1970.)

His fight with Tommy Burns was turned into a contemporary documentary ''[[The Burns-Johnson Fight]]'' in 1908.

In 2005, filmmaker [[Ken Burns]] produced a two-part documentary about Johnson's life, ''[[Unforgivable Blackness: The Rise and Fall of Jack Johnson]],'' based on the 2004 nonfiction book of the same name by Geoffrey C. Ward. The book won the [[William Hill Sports Book of the Year]] (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/6189040.stm |title=Johnson biog named book of year |work=[[BBC news]] |author=[[Staff writer]] |date=November 27, 2006 |accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/2351279/Johnsons-tale-floors-five-rivals.html |title=Johnson's tale floors five rivals |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |author=Andrew Baker |date=November 28, 2006 |accessdate=November 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Johnson's life was the subject of a three-part series of the podcast ''History on Fire'' by historian [[Daniele Bolelli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historyonfirepodcast.com/episodes/2017/11/9/episode-26-jack-johnson-part-1-bad-to-the-bone|title=Bad To The Bone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folksinger and blues singer [[Lead Belly]] referenced Johnson in a [[The Titanic (song)|song]] about the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']]: ''"Jack Johnson wanna get on board, Captain said I ain't hauling no coal. Fare thee, Titanic, fare thee well. When Jack Johnson heard that mighty shock, mighta seen the man do the Eagle rock. Fare thee, Titanic, fare thee well''" (The Eagle Rock was a popular dance at the time). In 1969, American folk singer [[Jaime Brockett]] reworked the Lead Belly song into a satirical talking blues called "The Legend of the S.S. Titanic." There is no convincing evidence that Johnson was in fact refused passage on the ''Titanic'' because of his race, as these songs allege.

The end of [[Miles Davis]]'s 1971 album titled ''[[A Tribute to Jack Johnson]]'' features the actor [[Brock Peters]] (as Johnson) saying:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
I'm Jack Johnson. Heavyweight champion of the world.
I'm black. They never let me forget it.
I'm black all right! I'll never let them forget it!
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Miles Davis and [[Wynton Marsalis]] both have done soundtracks for documentaries about Johnson. Several hip-hop activists have also reflected on Johnson's legacy, most notably in the album ''[[The New Danger]],'' by [[Mos Def]], in which songs like "Zimzallabim" and "Blue Black Jack" are devoted to the artist's pugilistic hero. Additionally, both Southern [[punk rock]] band [[This Bike is a Pipe Bomb]] and [[alternative country]] performer [[Tom Russell]] have songs dedicated to Johnson. Russell's piece is both a tribute and a biting indictment of the racism Johnson faced: ''"here comes Jack Johnson, like he owns the town, there's a lot of white Americans like to see a man go down&amp;nbsp;... like to see a black man drown."''

"[[Big Strong Man]]" or "My Brother Sylveste" is an English-language folk song associated with Ireland referencing the "Jeffries-Johnson fight" of 1910 with the lyric:  "Have you heard about the Jeffrey Johnson fight?/Oh, Lord what a hell of a fight."  The song was popular with Canadian soldiers in World War II.

In the trenches of World War One, Johnson's name was used by British troops to describe the impact of German 150&amp;nbsp;mm heavy artillery shells which had a black colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/atoz/jackjohnson.htm|title=First World War.com - Encyclopedia - Jack Johnson|publisher=Firstworldwar.com |accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letters home to his wife, [[Rupert Edward Inglis]] (1863–1916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of [[Albert, Somme|Albert]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt; We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue at the top of the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. It really is a wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, but I think it is now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there's a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rupert Edward Inglis |url=http://www.inglis.uk.com/RUPERT%20EDWARD%20INGLIS%20thiepval.htm |publisher=www.inglis.uk.com |accessdate=16 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jack Johnson was painted several times by [[Raymond Saunders (artist)|Raymond Saunders]].

In [[Joe R. Lansdale]]'s short story ''[[The Big Blow (novel)|The Big Blow]],'' Johnson is featured fighting a white boxer brought in by Galveston, Texas's boxing fans to defeat the African American fighter during the [[1900 Galveston Hurricane]]. The story won a [[Bram Stoker Award]] and was expanded into a novel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horror.org/stokerwinnom.htm#1997]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130429/http://www.horror.org/stokerwinnom.htm#1997|date=April 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson is a major character in the novel ''The Killings of Stanley Ketchel'' (2005), by [[James Carlos Blake]].

''The Royale'', a play by [[Marco Ramirez (playwright)|Marco Ramirez]], uses the life of Jack Johnson as inspiration for its main character, Jay Jackson. It premiered in March 2016 at [[Lincoln Center Theater]] directed by [[Rachel Chavkin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lct.org/shows/royale/?gclid=CjwKEAjw0pa5BRCLmoKIx_HTh1wSJABk5F_4r497tLrY7heh9WMl4xkcgULr3eVJiP4Y0KU8NvQHxRoCIdPw_wcB|title='The Royale: Shows'|accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for a Drama Desk Awards for [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Play|Outstanding Play]], [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Director of a Play|Outstanding Director of a Play]], and a Special Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dramadeskawards.com/nominees|title='The Nominees'|accessdate=May 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225151924/http://dramadeskawards.com/nominees|archive-date=February 25, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kay Laurell''' (born '''Ruth Leslie''', June 28, 1890&lt;ref name=will&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Will|editor=Wertheim, Arthur Frank |title=Will Rogers: At the Ziegfeld Follies|year=1992|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-806-12357-5|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite book|title=The New International Year Book|year=1928|publisher=Dodd, Mead and Company|page=570}}&lt;/ref&gt; – January 31, 1927) was an American stage and [[silent film]] actress and [[Model (profession)|model]].

Laurell began her career as an artists' model. After catching the eye of [[Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.]], she was cast in the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' where she debuted in 1914. A popular performer who was noted for her beauty, she was called "one of the most beautiful women on the stage". In 1918, Laurell left the ''Follies'' to embark on an acting career. She went on to appear in stage productions on [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] and in [[vaudeville]], and made three [[silent film]]s. In the 1920s, Laurell moved to Europe where she continued her stage career. She died during childbirth at the age of 36 in [[London]].

==Early life==
Laurell was born in 1890&lt;ref name=will /&gt;&lt;ref name=new /&gt; (some sources state 1894) in [[Erie, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vazzana|first=Eugene Michael |title=Silent Film Necrology|edition=2|year=2002|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-41059-0|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="miami"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6CsuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FNUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2515,790134&amp;dq=kay+laurell+pennsylvania&amp;hl=en|title=The Frugal Follies Girl's Fortune for her Love-Child|date=November 30, 1930|work=The Miami News|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She left Erie at the age of 16 to pursue a career in show business in [[New York City]]. She initially found work as telephone operator before she was hired as an artists' model. During her stint as a model, she posed for artists and illustrators including [[Howard Chandler Christy]] and [[William Glackens]]. It was during this time that Ruth Leslie changed her name to Kay Laurell.&lt;ref name="miami" /&gt;

In 1914, [[Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.]] saw Laurell while she was appearing in a [[Tableau vivant|tableau]] staged at the annual Illustrators' Ball. Ziegfeld was impressed by Laurell's appearance and offered her a spot in the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]''.&lt;ref name="miami" /&gt;

==Career==

===''Ziegfeld Follies''===
Laurell made her stage debut in the ''Ziegfeld Follies of 1914''. The following year, she caused a sensation when she appeared in the opening scene of the 1915 ''Follies'' as a semi-nude [[Aphrodite]]. The scene was designed by [[Joseph Urban]] and featured an elaborate set with a pool surrounded by greenery. Laurell rose out of the water flanked by two golden elephants with raised trunks from which water poured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Adams|first1=Katherine H. |last2=Keene|first2=Michael L. |last3=Campbell Koella|first3=Jennifer |title=Seeing the American Woman, 1880&amp;ndash;1920: The Social Impact of the Visual Media Explosion|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-786-46661-8|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Doris Eaton Travis]]' 2003 autobiography ''The Days We Danced'', Laurell became known for "those naked-above-the-waist poses". At that time, performers were permitted to appear nude onstage as long as they did not move. This [[loophole]] in the law inspired stage producers and set designers to come up with more inventive and elaborate ways to feature nudity in their shows. Eaton Travis later recalled, "The story was that Ziegfeld asked for a volunteer to be naked above the waist, and Kay Laurell was the first to consent. Hers became the most revealed breasts on Broadway in that era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eaton Travis|first1=Doris |last2=Eaton|first2=Charles |last3=Morris|first3=John Randolf |others=Eaton, Joseph |title=The Days We Danced: The Story of My Theatrical Family from Florenz Ziegfeld to Arthur Murray and Beyond|year=2003|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-806-19950-4|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Laurell's popularity grew and she was often noted for her physical beauty and perfect figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19160916.2.85|title=The Picture World|date=September 16, 1916|work=Evening Post|page=11|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was referred to as "one of the most beautiful women on the stage" and "the prettiest chorus girl on Broadway."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=MBcOAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YH0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1640,261194&amp;dq=kay+laurell+stage&amp;hl=en|title=Here's A Prize Beauty From Top To Toe|date=February 8, 1924|work=The Evening Independent|page=10B|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=pSRhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WmMNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1138,4641000&amp;dq=kay+laurell+prettiest&amp;hl=en|title=Do Actresses Make Good Wives?|date=February 9, 1919|work=Evening Tribune|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Florenz Ziegfeld stated that Laurell was the embodiment of feminine beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodgers|first=Marion Elizabeth |title=Mencken:The American Iconoclast|year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-195-07238-3|page=593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1916, Laurell married [[Winfield Sheehan]], the former secretary to [[Rhinelander Waldo]], in London. Shortly after the marriage, Laurell retired from the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ssNcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_1gNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1592,1334239&amp;dq=kay+laurell+beauty&amp;hl=en|title=The Battle for the Beauties|date=September 10, 1916|work=Evening Tribune|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1917, she filed for legal separation from Sheehan citing "cruelty".&lt;ref name="youngstown"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cCpKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9IUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2372,2326181&amp;dq=kay+laurell+divorce&amp;hl=en|title=Kay Laurell Seeks Divorce|date=July 14, 1917|work=Youngstown Vindicator|page=8B|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KayLaurellZiegfeldBoobless.jpg|thumb|upright|Laurell as "The Spirit of the Allies" in the ''Ziegfeld Follies of 1918''.]]

After separating from Sheehan, Laurell resumed her career and returned to the ''Follies'' in June 1918. She was again featured in the opening scene, this time posing as "The Spirit of the Allies" atop a lighted, spinning globe. As [[World War I]] was still on, the globe showed Europe in flames. One of the more memorable tableau scenes of that year's ''Follies'' featured patriotic and war imagery designed by [[Ben Ali Haggin]]. Social historian Allen Churchill later described the scene, "Actors in [[battle dress]] stood frozen in the act of tossing grenades, bayoneting cringing [[List of terms used for Germans#Hun (offensive)|Huns]]...Follies Girls as [[Red Cross]] nurses, waifs in war-torn undress and goddess of war. Dominating the vivid scene was Miss Kay Laurell representing the Spirit of the Allies, her costume in enough disarray to expose one...breast." While the ''Follies'' typically featured light-hearted themes, audiences enjoyed the war themed scene of the 1918 ''Follies''. The show ran until the [[Armistice with Germany]] in November 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bush Jones|first=John |title=Our Musicals, Ourselves: A Social History of the American Musical Theater|year=2003|publisher=UPNE|isbn=0-874-51904-7|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kay Laurell-1915-newspaper-A.jpg|thumb|Laurell in 1915]]
===Stage and films===
Like many other [[Ziegfeld girl]]s, Laurell attempted to parlay the success she found in the ''Follies'' into an acting career. In 1919, she made her film debut in ''The Brand'', opposite [[Russell Simpson (actor)|Russell Simpson]]. Later that same year, she played a supporting role in ''[[The Valley of the Giants (1919 film)|The Valley of the Giants]]'', starring [[Wallace Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=crViAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FXgNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=915,6541710&amp;dq=kay+laurell+valley+of+the+giants&amp;hl=en|title=Kay Laurell With Reid|date=April 10, 1919|work=Providence News|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurell received positive reviews for her acting, but would only make one more silent film, ''Lonely Heart'', in 1921.

Laurell focused mainly on stage work for the remainder of her career. In 1922, she joined the production of ''Ladies Night''. She remained with the play for a season before headlining the [[vaudeville]] circuit with [[Repertory theatre#Repertory theatre|stock companies]] in [[Yonkers]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theatre Magazine, Volumes 35-36|year=1922|publisher=Theatre Magazine Company|page=322}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1924, she joined the cast of ''Quarantine''. The play ran for a total of 151 performances at [[Henry Miller's Theatre]] through April 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB title|id=9361|title=Quarantine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurell then co-starred in ''Nocture'', which premiered at the Punch and Judy Theatre in [[New York City]] on February 16, 1925. The play ran for three performances before closing later that month.&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB title|id=9651|title=Nocture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She later moved to Europe where she found work in a French stock company in Paris. Laurell then moved to [[London]]. By this period, her career began to decline and her roles were no longer reported in [[Trade magazine|theater trades]].&lt;ref name="miami" /&gt;

==Personal life==
In May 1916, Laurell married [[Winfield Sheehan]]. The couple separated in July 1917 but never divorced.&lt;ref name="pittsburg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jr4cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=N44EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1348,4859392&amp;dq=kay+laurell&amp;hl=en|title=Son Survives Follies Beauty|date=October 3, 1930|work=The Pittsburgh Press|page=48|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheehan later became the general manager and vice president at [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name=painsville&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TMVZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=L0oNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2790,3507927&amp;dq=kay+laurell+death&amp;hl=en|title=Kay Laurell Is Taken By Death|date=February 22, 1927|work=Painesville Telegraph|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While separated from Sheehan, Laurell began a relationship with Joseph Whiteside Boyle, a businessman and the son of [[Joseph W. Boyle|Klondike Joe Boyle]]. The couple planned to marry after both obtained divorced from their respective spouses. In 1926, Laurell became pregnant.&lt;ref name="pittsburg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yonkers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:haUnzJMyGBIJ:fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%252018/Yonkers%2520NY%2520Statesman/Yonkers%2520NY%2520Statesman%25201931/Yonkers%2520NY%2520Statesman%25201931%2520-%25200108.pdf+&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgVWtAXmuc9Kvw6CtO0DUNu4b-4y-wO4HUwATOYw4uruWLBlcQ8qKWJlpAlBlSCpDct-7kQP5mUJJKfLgqtFJmwZoCF_jfH5lSZ0hcvOGgjVISAEv7_SpTGEkjpsLg6XGJTV2ru&amp;sig=AHIEtbRxElGL0qGoPZR-DAyZxo9HJuy_XA|title=Young Son Claims Estate Of Former Yonkers Beauty|date=January 8, 1931|work=The Yonkers Statesman|page=15|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On January 31, 1927, Laurell died in [[London]] at the age of 36. Laurell's death was initially attributed to [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kay Laurell Dead. Ex-'Follies' Star.

Boyle, survived.&lt;ref name="pittsburg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yonkers" /&gt;

===Estate===
Before her death, Laurell drew up a will leaving her property and personal effects to Joseph Whiteside Boyle (who was presumed to be the child's father) and named him the [[executor]] of her estate. Laurell left her $100,000 estate to Boyle because she was unaware that her son, who was born [[out of wedlock]], could legally inherit her assets. However, one month before Laurell's death, the [[Legitimacy Act 1926]] was passed in England which allowed her son to inherit her assets. A similar law in [[New York (city)|New York]] (where Laurell also had bank accounts and property) also allowed her son to inherit his mother's estate.&lt;ref name="miami" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=K7wVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Fg8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3127,331870&amp;dq=kay+laurell+follies&amp;hl=en|title=Actress Left $100,000|date=October 3, 1930|work=[[The Milwaukee Sentinel]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned for the child's welfare, Laurell's brother Raleigh J. Leslie, sought a [[Letters of Administration|letter of administration]] for her estate naming Joseph K. as her [[next of kin]].&lt;ref name="pittsburg" /&gt; He later dropped the matter after discovering that the boy's father, Joseph Whiteside Boyle, had been caring for the child since birth and had no plans to claim Laurell's estate.&lt;ref name="miami" /&gt;&lt;ref name="yonkers" /&gt; One month after Laurell's death, her mother Mrs. A.A. Leslie, died in Erie, Pennsylvania. Laurell's mother was never told of her daughter's death as she was dying at the time. Upon Mrs. Leslie's death, she left her Erie, Pennsylvania home and assets to Laurell which were subsequently inherited by Laurell's son.&lt;ref name="miami" /&gt;&lt;ref name=painsville /&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[H.L. Mencken]] said Laurell possessed "all the arts of the really first-rate [[harlot]]" and was "the most successful practitioner of her trade of her generation in New York."  He said, "Much of what I got from her, in fact, went into ''[[In Defense of Women]]''", his 1918 book.&lt;ref&gt;Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, ''Mencken: The American Iconoclast'', [[Oxford University Press]], 2005, pages 241-2.&lt;/ref&gt; Playwright [[Channing Pollock (writer)|Channing Pollock]] wrote, however, "Kay could have gone far if she had been willing to exchange her favors for advancement, but she didn't 'want to get ahead that way'."&lt;ref&gt;Channing Pollock, ''Harvest of My Years - An Autobiography'', page 356&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leoben Conoy''' ('''Number Two''') is a [[fictional character]] portrayed by [[Callum Keith Rennie]] appearing in the reimagined ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'' series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Callum Keith Rennie|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0719678/|website=IMDb|publisher=Amazon|accessdate=14 December 2017|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Leoben is a humanoid [[Cylon (re-imagining)|Cylon]] agent who portrays himself as possessing [[philosophical]] and [[religious]] enlightenment. Meanwhile, he delights in playing [[mind game]]s by engaging in disorienting and [[poetic]] discourse that entwines truth and lies. The Number Two series model seems to be one of the physically strongest type among the humanoid cylons, demonstrating superhuman feats such as snapping handcuffs and tossing people around like ragdolls.

Leoben expresses what can be judged a [[panentheistic]] view of [[God]] as inherent in all beings, telling [[Kara Thrace|Starbuck]], "We're all God."

In the fourth season episode "[[Six of One (Battlestar Galactica)|Six of One]]", Conoy's model number was revealed as Number Two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leoben Conoy|url=https://www.universeguide.com/character/leobenconoy|website=Universe Guide|publisher=universeguide.com|accessdate=14 December 2017|ref=1}}{{plot|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==

===Ragnar Anchorage===
Leoben Conoy is first encountered in the [[Battlestar Galactica (TV miniseries)|miniseries]] by [[William Adama|Commander Adama]] hiding in the [[List of Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining) locations#R|Ragnar Anchorage]] supply depot posing as an [[Arms industry|arms dealer]] scrounging for weapons and supplies. Apparently to avoid arrest, Leoben offers to help Adama's supply team gather cannon shells for ''Galactica''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s defensive guns. After an explosive device accidentally detonates, Adama is trapped with Leoben and separated from the rest of the crew. They look for a way out, engaging in philosophical conversation, all the while Leoben claims to be suffering from [[allergies]]. As Adama and Leoben converse, Adama notices Leoben Conoy's "allergies" getting worse. This makes Adama suspicious as he feels it may be a reaction Cylons have to [[radiation]] (in this case emitted by the [[gas giant]] the anchorage orbits). Eventually, Leoben confirms Adama's suspicions, admitting his true nature.

Adama and Leoben fight and in the ensuing struggle, Leoben reacts with amazing speed and strength, but Adama manages to kill him by [[bludgeon (weapon)|bludgeon]]ing him in the head with a flashlight. Just prior to his demise, Leoben Conoy reveals to Adama that Cylons can be "[[resurrect]]ed" with their persona downloaded into another copy upon death, allowing all of their experiences to be saved and providing effective [[immortality]]. It is implied, however, the radiation field surrounding Ragnar Anchorage prevents Leoben from [[downloading]] to a Cylon facility for proper resurrection.

After Adama is rescued, Leoben Conoy's body is taken back to ''[[Battlestar Galactica (ship)|Galactica]]'' and examined, revealing humanoid Cylon variants are almost identical to humans.

===Colonial fleet===
In the episode "[[Flesh and Bone (Battlestar Galactica)|Flesh and Bone]]", a copy of Leoben is found in the fleet hiding aboard the ''[[List of miscellaneous ships in Battlestar Galactica (2004)|Gemenon Traveller]]'' and is arrested. After dodging questions and playing mind games he claims he has planted a [[nuclear weapon|nuclear bomb]] within the fleet. Leoben is subsequently tortured for information by [[Kara Thrace|Starbuck]], something he submits to even though he is shown to be capable of breaking free of his restraints and killing her. He demonstrates a growing obsession with Starbuck throughout the episode, and the interrogation becomes a contest between the two of them. [[Laura Roslin|President Laura Roslin]] intervenes in the interrogation and more courteously questions him. He then makes startling predictions about [[Kobol]] and the future of the fleet. After he admits that there was no bomb (and frightens Roslin by claiming Adama is a Cylon spy), Roslin has him [[space exposure|vented into space]].

===Occupation of New Caprica===
&lt;!-- same as previosu copy? merge these sections? --&gt;
In the final episode of 2nd season "[[Lay Down Your Burdens (Battlestar Galactica)|Lay Down Your Burdens, Part II]]", Leoben appears again during the Cylon invasion of [[New Caprica]]. He asks Starbuck's husband [[Samuel Anders]] for Starbuck's whereabouts.

In the third season premier "[[Occupation (Battlestar Galactica)|Occupation]]", it is revealed Starbuck has been captured by the Cylons, and is forced to live with Leoben for a number of months. During this period she has killed him five times, though he would simply resurrect and return, exercising extreme patience in his task of winning Starbuck's affection.

Leoben claims he created a baby from an egg retrieved from Starbuck's ovary (see "[[The Farm (Battlestar Galactica)|The Farm]]") and presents a girl named [[Kacey (Battlestar Galactica)|Kacey]]. He says Kacey is a half-Cylon hybrid, Starbuck and Leoben being the parents. In [[Exodus (Battlestar Galactica)|"Exodus" (part 2)]], however, it is revealed Kacey is a human child taken from her mother on New Caprica, and the two are reunited (much to Starbuck's shock) when Starbuck and Kacey arrive back on ''Galactica''.

===Leoben's role in Starbuck's destiny===
Ever since Starbuck first encountered Leoben aboard the ''Gemenon Traveller'' and during the time she was forced to live with him on New Caprica, Leoben has continually told her she has a special [[destiny]] and an important role to play in future events. Despite Starbuck's guilt that she has been nothing but a "screw up" since childhood, Leoben tries to show she is more significant than she believes. In later episodes of the third season, Starbuck has bizarre dreams of Leoben, with some becoming markedly erotic.

In the episode "[[Maelstrom (Battlestar Galactica)|Maelstrom]]", Starbuck begins hallucinating things, such as her younger self, fleeting images of her mother, and finally non-existent [[Cylon Raiders]]. Because of this, her fitness for duty comes into question. Thinking she's losing her mind, she seeks help from an [[oracle]] who tells her Leoben is her spiritual guide and her deceased mother, [[List of minor characters in Battlestar Galactica (re-imagining)#Socrata Thrace|Socrata Thrace]], is using him to get a message to her.

During a hallucinatory [[dogfight]] with a Raider, Starbuck's [[Colonial Viper|Viper]] takes damage and she falls into unconsciousness, ending up in a dream of her mother's apartment. Leoben appears and takes Starbuck to a scene six years prior, where she learns her mother is dying of cancer. However, her mother's heartless and derogatory comments force Starbuck to walk out on her mother for good. Her mother dies alone and Starbuck kept the pain of that decision locked inside her.

Leoben next takes her to the moment of her mother's death and allows Starbuck another chance to be with her mother at her deathbed. Leoben consoles Starbuck, telling her death is nothing to fear. Starbuck states "You're not Leoben," to which he replies, "Never said I was. I'm here to prepare you to pass through the next door; to discover what hovers in the space between life and death." Starbuck finally accepts (apparent) death and decides to go down with her damaged Viper when it explodes in the atmosphere of a gas giant. Starbuck's reappearance in "[[Crossroads (Battlestar Galactica)|Crossroads Part II]]," where she tells [[Lee Adama]] it really is her and that she has been to [[Earth]], may suggest the destiny Leoben had been guiding her to involves much more than her death.

The copy of Leoben that held Starbuck captive on New Caprica returns to offer a truce between the Colonials and the Cylon Rebels. In "[[The Road Less Traveled (Battlestar Galactica)|The Road Less Traveled]]", he helps Starbuck finish a painting of part of her vision, and eventually convinces her to travel to his severely damaged [[basestar]], in "[[Faith (Battlestar Galactica)|Faith]]". Onboard she discovers part of her painted vision of the road to Earth: a trinary star system possessing a gas giant with a rapidly receding and damaged basestar that appeared as a comet. Leoben takes her to see the ships's Hybrid who gives Starbuck a cryptic and disturbing message. The Hybrid suggests [[unboxing]] the D'Anna models to help locate the [[Final Five Cylons|final five]] but informs Starbuck she is the harbinger of death leading humanity to its end.

In "[[Sometimes a Great Notion (Battlestar Galactica)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]", upon reaching Earth from the coordinates of Starbuck's Viper, Leoben accompanies Starbuck through a desolate landscape, eventually coming upon the ruins of a crashed Viper. The dead pilot of the Viper is revealed to be Starbuck. Starbuck asks him "What am I?" Leoben has no answer for her and appears to be extremely alarmed by this turn of events.

===Final Fate===
Having sided with the Colonials, along with the [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Six]]es and [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Eight]]s, against the remaining Cylon forces led by [[John Cavil]], Leoben is instrumental in aiding them throughout their final confrontation.  When Starbuck's interpretation of the musical notes in her head leads everyone to a new planet (which is later identified as our Earth), the Leoben series, along with the remnants of the Colonials, the Sixes and Eights, vote to settle the new world and help make a difference in rebuilding civilization before they "pass into God's hands".  The Leobens, like his Cylon counterparts and the remnants of humanity, pass into history.

[[File:MDRS Campus.jpg|thumb|480px|The Mars Society's Mars Desert Research Station located near [[Hanksville, Utah]].]]

The '''Mars Desert Research Station''' ('''MDRS''') is the second simulated [[Mars analog habitat|Mars analog habitat]] owned and operated by the [[Mars Society]].

The station was built near Hanksville, Utah, in the western [[United States]] in the early 2000s, and it is typically manned by small crews who visit the station for one week to three month rotations to conduct scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/photography/proof/2018/05/mars-on-earth-nasa-training/|title=Meet the Crews Preparing for Human Life on Mars|date=2018-05-04|access-date=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus includes a two-story habitat (the Hab), a [[greenhouse]] (the GreenHab), a solar [[observatory]](the Musk Observatory), a robotic observatory, an engineering pod (the RAM) and a science building (the ScienceDome). Tunnels between all of the buildings except the robotic observatory allow crews to travel between the buildings without a spacesuit while they are in simulation (sim). 

== Background ==
The MDRS station is situated on the [[San Rafael Swell]] of southern [[Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techfragments.com/news/275/Science/Mars_Desert_Research_Station_Simulates_Mars_Like_Base.html |title=Mars Desert Research Station Simulates Mars Like Base |work=TechFragments.com |first=Michael |last=Horton |date=January 18, 2009 |accessdate=February 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205232101/http://techfragments.com/news/275/Science/Mars_Desert_Research_Station_Simulates_Mars_Like_Base.html |archivedate=February 5, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; located {{convert|11.63|km}} by road northwest of [[Hanksville, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=wp20070331.xls |journal=MDRS-Navigation-Waypoints-Data-Base |first=Hugh |last=Gregory |author2=Graham, Paul |date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second such analogue research station to be built by the Mars Society, following in the footsteps of the [[Flashline Mars Arctic Research Station]] or [[FMARS]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fmars.marssociety.org/home/about/faq#2 |title=FMARS Location |work=fmars.marssociety.org |accessdate=February 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623013505/http://fmars.marssociety.org/home/about/faq#2 |archivedate=June 23, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Devon Island]] in Canada's high [[Arctic]].

The third station, the [[European Mars Analog Research Station]] or [[European Mars Analog Research Station|EuroMARS]] was founded and built in early 2002. It was shipped to the UK in the mid 2000s in preparation for deployment to the selected research site (approximately N65° 46' 7.18"  W16° 45' 30.50") which is located next to the [[Krafla Rift Volcano]], about {{convert|15|km}} north east of the village of Myvatn, Iceland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://european-mars-analog-research-station.co.tv/ |title=EuroMars |work=european-mars-analog-research-station.co.tv/ |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth station, the [[Australia Mars Analog Research Station]] / [[Australia Mars Analog Research Station|MARS Oz]] is currently in the planning stages and it will be deployed to the selected research site (S 30° 18' 13.91" E 139° 26' 39.55") east of the Arkaroola Sanctuary, which itself is roughly {{convert|521|km}} north of Adelaide, South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marssociety.org.au/library/AMEC2008_conference_%20proceedings.pdf |title=OzMars |work=8th AMEC Conf Proceedings Pages 17-18 |accessdate=February 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218061846/http://www.marssociety.org.au/library/AMEC2008_conference_%20proceedings.pdf |archivedate=February 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mars Society launched the Mars Analog Research Station (MARS) Project in order to develop key knowledge needed to prepare for the human exploration of Mars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdrs.marssociety.org |title=Mars Desert Research Station: Project Background |work=MarsSociety.org |accessdate=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's goals are to develop field tactics based on environmental constraints (i.e., being required to work in spacesuits), to test habitat design features and tools, and to assess crew selection protocols. Although much warmer than Mars, the desert location was selected because of its Mars-like terrain and appearance.

From the moment they arrive at MDRS, crews enter a "living on Mars" simulation. Crew members must wear an analogue space suit simulator or a "sim suit" when completing tasks outside the Habitat (HAB) to simulate the protection they would need from the harsh Martian environment. Complete analogue space suit simulators include a helmet, jumpsuit, boots, gaithers, gloves, an air supply pack, Platypus water pack, and a radio. Hand held radios mounted on the suits' helmets (with externally mounted push to talk switches) are used to communicate with Habitat communication base (Hab-com) and with fellow analogue Mars surface explorers on the same [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]. For safety reasons, there is always one crew member in the HAB to act as Hab-Com in case anything goes wrong on the extra-vehicular activity ([[Extra-vehicular activity|EVA]]). In the event that crew's vehicles break down or one of their members becomes injured in the field, being able to communicate with the HAB is crucial to protect the safety of the people partaking in the analogue Mars surface exploration simulation mission.

Destinations for [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]] can be chosen from an established waypoint database and traveled to either on foot or by [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]].

MDRS is owned and operated by The Mars Society, which selects the crews and handles most of the administrative tasks. The Mars Society is an international, non-profit organization, with chapters worldwide, that is dedicated to convincing governments and the public of the benefits of Mars exploration through various projects such as M.A.R.S., the Mars Analogue Pressurized Rover Competition, and the ARCHIMEDES Mars balloon mission.

Students interested in participating in the project receive a $500 travel stipend from the Spaceward Bound Program run out of [[NASA Ames Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://quest.nasa.gov/projects/spacewardbound/ |title=Spaceward Bound! |work=NASA.gov |first=Linda |last=Conrad |date=November 2007 |accessdate=February 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216092014/http://quest.nasa.gov/projects/spacewardbound/ |archivedate=February 16, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spaceward Bound Program aims to train the next generation of space explorers by allowing students and teachers to participate in projects in extreme environments that can serve as simulations for the moon or Mars. 

A Local Manager has been hired to take care of some of the maintenance and support services.

==Research==
Each crew establishes different scientific goals they hope to accomplish during their time at MDRS. The majority of the biological studies carried out involve [[extremophile]]s, or organisms that are capable of living in extreme environments. Bacteria and algae isolated from the surrounding desert are common subjects of study. These microorganisms have been studied for their DNA, diversity and the environments they live in. For example, in a study for [[methanogen]]s researchers studied soil and vapour samples from five different desert environments in [[Utah]], [[Idaho]] and [[California]] in the [[United States]], and in [[Canada]] and [[Chile]]. Of these, five soil samples and three vapour samples from the vicinity of the MDRS were found to have signs of viable methanogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Desert methane: Implications for life detection on Mars |journal=Icarus |first=Mark |last=Moran |author2=Miller, Joseph D |author3=Kral, Tim |author4= Scott, Dave  |volume=178 |issue=1 |pages=277–280 |date=November 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2005.06.008 |bibcode=2005Icar..178..277M}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8428-extreme-bugs-back-idea-of-life-on-mars.html |title=Extreme bugs back idea of life on Mars |journal=New Scientist |first=Kelly |last=Young |author2=Chandler, David L |date=December 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A unique opportunity to combine geology and biology occurs when studying the [[endolith]]s found in rocks around the Hab. These species of bacteria are capable of living inside rocks and obtaining the energy they need by photosynthesizing using the light that penetrates the rocks. These extreme organisms are a popular subject of research at MDRS for both geologists and biologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdrs.marssociety.org/ |title=Research Summaries |work=MarsSociety.org |accessdate=February 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other experiments include a study of the effect of [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]] on the heart rates and blood pressures of crew members, a human factors study that examine the correlation between cognitive ability and mood and a study on how much a space suit inhibits dexterity in comparison to regular street clothes.

==Crews==
[[File:MDRS Astronauts.jpg|thumb|Crew 73 members in [[Space Suit]] Simulators]]
MDRS crews traditionally consist of six people, who volunteer for one of the two-week shifts or crew rotations available during the northern hemisphere's winter months. The field season ends in the northern spring since the summer heat of the desert is not conducive to a pleasant simulation. Crews pay all of their own transportation expenses to get to and from the designated assembly place from where they are transported to and from MDRS.  As Volunteers, the Crews are not paid for their participation in a crew rotation at the station, but do get valuable experience. The crews usually consist of a mix of [[Scientist]], [[astronomers]], [[physicists]], [[biologists]], [[geologist]]s, [[engineers]] and the occasional [[journalist]]. Each crew member is usually assigned a role: Commander, Executive Officer (ExO), Health and Safety Officer (HSO), Crew Biologist, Crew Geologist or Chief Engineer.

The Crew Commander is ultimately responsible for the entire crew and operations. Their other responsibilities include maintaining a structured stream of information from the crew to Mission Support, establishing the agenda for each day (EVAs, maintenance, cooking, cleaning, etc.) and holding morning and evening meetings with all crew members. The Executive Officer's duty is to act as the second in command during the mission and to act as the Commander in the event that the Commander is incapacitated or unavailable. The Crew Geologist and the Crew Biologist work together to establish and accomplish the science goals of the mission. The Crew Geologist and Crew Biologist are in charge of developing the geology and biology goals for the mission, planning field EVAs and subsequent laboratory work to achieve those goals. Both the Crew Geologist and Crew Biologist work with the Remote Science Team (RST) during all stages of the mission. The Chief Engineer is responsible for maintaining all systems necessary for routine Hab operations. These include the power, water, [[All-terrain vehicle|ATV]] and GreenHab systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdrs.marssociety.org/home/participate/mdrs-rules-and-protocol |title=MDRS Mission Rules |work=mdrs.marssociety.org |accessdate=February 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120710123956/http://mdrs.marssociety.org/home/participate/mdrs-rules-and-protocol |archivedate=July 10, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2017|02}}, 175 crews have served rotations at MDRS over a period of sixteen years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdrs2011.com/index.htm |title=MDRS 2011 |work=MDRS2011.com |accessdate=February 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319070017/http://www.mdrs2011.com/index.htm |archivedate=March 19, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Research Station==
[[File:Mars Desert Research Station.jpg|thumb|MDRS]]
[[Image:Upstairs Hab.jpg|thumb|Crew 73 meets with writer Laurie Schmidt upstairs in the Hab.]]
The research station consists of three buildings, the Habitat, the Greenhab, the Musk Mars Desert [[Observatory]] and a remotely located Engineering Support Equipment Area.

===Habitat===
The analogue Mars Lander Habitat, commonly referred to as "The HAB", is a two-story cylinder that measures about {{convert|10|m}} in diameter and is a crew's combined home and place of work during a Mars surface exploration simulation. On the first floor there are two simulated [[airlock]]s, a shower and toilet, an EVA Preparation room for storage and maintenance of the simulated [[space suit]]s and their associated equipment, and a combined science lab and engineering work area. The laboratory is shared between the Crew Geologist and the Crew Biologist and includes an [[autoclave]], [[analytical balance]], [[microscope]], and a stock of chemicals and reagents for conducting biochemical tests. On the second floor are six very small private crew staterooms with bunks and a small reading desk, a common dining and entertainment area, a dedicated communications station and a galley or kitchen equipped with a gas stove, refrigerator, microwave, oven and a sink for meal preparations. Above the six crew staterooms is a Loft which contains the internal fresh water storage tank and equipment storage space.  At the peak of the HAB's dome shaped roof is an access hatch to permit maintenance access to the satellite antenna and weather monitoring instruments.

Power is supplied by 12 rechargeable 24-volt batteries, located under the HAB which can provide electrical power for up to twelve hours. In addition to the batteries are two {{convert|5|kW}} electricity generators named respectively "Casper" and "Wendy". Power from the generators is channeled through a Xantrex inverter, which sends the power either to the battery banks to recharge them or via a panel with 19 circuit breakers, to the HAB electrical distribution system.

Water is supplied to the HAB via a potable water tank located {{convert|100|ft}} away in the Engineering Support Equipment Area. The tank is a plastic storage container with a {{convert|450|U.S.gal|adj=on}} capacity (8 days worth of water at {{convert|6|U.S.gal}} per person per day). Water must be manually carried or pumped via a hose from the potable water tank to the HAB's internal tank, which holds about {{convert|60|U.S.gal}}. The water is then gravity fed into a pressure pump that distributes the fresh water to the rest of the HAB, including a water heater. The water used to flush toilet is [[greywater]].  This is waste water that has run down the sink and shower drains in the HAB and then through the greywater system out of the GreenHab. Water is rationed and monitored to minimize inefficiency and waste in the system.

The HAB is also equipped with an internet connection and several web cams so that the public can view the ongoing mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freemars.org/mdrscam/ |title=MDRS Web Cams |work=FreeMars.org |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GreenHab===
The GreenHab is a greenhouse used for growing crops and plant research. The original Gary Fisher GreenHab, retrofitted in 2009 from a closed loop water recycling center to a functional greenhouse, was destroyed by fire in December 2014,&lt;ref name=ms20141230&gt;
{{cite web |title=MDRS GreenHab Destroyed by Fire |url=http://www.marssociety.org/home/press/announcements/mdrsgreenhabdestroyedbyfire |publisher=Mars Society |accessdate=31 December 2014 |date=30 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206202846/http://www.marssociety.org/home/press/announcements/mdrsgreenhabdestroyedbyfire |archivedate=6 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and replaced in September 2015 after an Indiegogo campaign raised $12,540 to rebuild it.  

Originally the rebuilt GreenHab was planned as a geodesic dome.  However, once the pad and frame were in place, there appeared to be no way to make it wind and winter tight, so it was completed as the new ScienceDome. The new Greenhab is a 12 foot by 24 foot transparent building that is climate and light controlled. The plants grown in the Greenhab are mostly herbs, greens, radishes, tomatoes, and other vegetables.

===Musk Mars Desert Observatory===
[[Image:Musk Observatory.jpg|thumb|The Musk Mars Desert Observatory]]
The Musk Mars Desert Observatory houses a {{convert|28|cm|adj=on}} [[Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope]], donated by [[Celestron]]. The telescope is capable of being operated remotely, and is accessible to amateur and professional [[astronomer]]s via the [[internet]]. The observatory's other sponsors include Le Sueur Manufacturing Inc., which provided the Astro-Pier on which the telescope is mounted; Software Bisque, which provided [[TheSky]] software; Vince Lanzetta of East Coast Observatories; Adirondack Video Astronomy; High Point Scientific; Technical Innovations; and the Lehigh Valley Amateur Astronomical Association.

The addition of the Musk Mars Desert Observatory provides research opportunities that were not available before, not only to the crew, but local teachers and students. It also encourages more public involvement as students and teachers are invited to interact with the crew and to use the observatory as a learning tool.

Engineering tasks are completed in the RAM (Repair and assembly module) a retrofitted Chinook helicopter fuel compartment designed with for tool storage, and work spaces for engineering project and repair of station instruments.  It was moved to the campus in October 2017 and became fully operational in November 2018.

===Other===
North of the GreenHAB is the underground [[septic tank]] and its outflow field.  This area is a "No Drive - Foot Traffic Only Zone" as there is no record of where exactly the [[septic tank]] is buried.  East of the GreenHab is an [[wikt:omnidirectional|omnidirectional]] Jovian [[radio telescope]].

The MDRS is the site of the [[University Rover Challenge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://urc.marssociety.org/ |title=University Rover Challenge |work=urc.marssociety.org |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first of which was held on June 2, 2007.

The [[Flag of Mars]] appears on a couple of the buildings, as does the [[Flag of the United States]]. The Mars Society logo is also present in a few places.

==DC animated universe==

===''Superman: The Animated Series''===
Mercy Graves was created for ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' (voiced by [[Lisa Edelstein]]) as a tough young woman with a checkered past. Mercy serves as [[Lex Luthor]]'s personal bodyguard and chauffeur. Originally the leader of a gang of female thieves, Mercy once daringly swiped Luthor's briefcase from under the billionaire's nose. She did not get far before Luthor's men hunted her down. However, rather than take revenge, Luthor, impressed by her mixture of ruthlessness and street savvy, offered her a job. He took her in, cleaned her up, and made her his right-hand woman. Trained in unarmed combat, she was entrusted with his personal security and also to carry out his dirty work.

Her demeanor reveals a sardonic wit and her habitual dress is a chauffeur's uniform with a very short skirt, a chauffeur's cap, nylons, and short, high heeled boots. Mercy is loyal and respectful to Luthor, and she claims to be "the only one in Luthor's entire company who can get away with calling him Lex".

In the episode "Brave New Metropolis" Lois Lane travels to an alternate reality of Metropolis. Mercy Graves is the commander of Lex Luthor's law-enforcement group. She and her soldiers raid the hideout of the revolutionaries led by Jimmy Olsen where they arrest the revolutionaries, confiscate the stolen Kryptonite, send the adults to prison, and send any children of the revolutionaries to the LexCorp Orphanage. When she hears Jimmy call out to Lois, Mercy had her brought before Lex Luthor after the DNA tests prove that she is Lois Lane. Lex Luthor decided that in order to keep Superman at bay, it would be best to dispose of Lois. He sent Mercy to kill her in the city. On their way, they came across Angela Chen, who managed to distract the commander. Lois stole Mercy's gun and before she could react, Angela had bitten her leg. Lois made her getaway. Lois and the alternate Superman met where he learned what Lex Luthor has been doing behind his back. In the LexCorp building, Mercy was present when Lois and Superman confronted Luthor. Mercy fought Lois, but ultimately lost when Lois planted a jaw-breaking left hook. Rebels stormed into the room and poured onto the hated Mercy while Superman pursued Lex Luthor.

[[Image:Mercy Graves.jpg|thumb|Mercy Graves from ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'']]
In the episode "Ghost in the Machine," Mercy teams up with Superman to find a missing Lex Luthor. Superman tries to convince Mercy that Luthor does not actually care for her; Mercy tries to prove him wrong. However, after a battle with [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]], Mercy is pinned under a pile of fallen machinery while the room caves in. Although Luthor could have saved her, he flees instead causing Superman to save her.

During the "World's Finest" crossover arc, Mercy develops an intense rivalry with Harley Quinn, the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]'s henchwoman and on again/off again girlfriend. During the arc's climactic episode, Harley duct tapes Mercy's mouth shut and ties her to a killer android that attacks [[Batman]] and Superman. She is saved by the two, and is later seen watching television and laughing as Harley is publicly arrested.

===''Justice League''===
Mercy Graves later reappears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Tabula Rasa". The nature of her relationship with Luthor becomes more clear. Mercy has agreed to take over [[LexCorp]] while Luthor is in prison and is hesitant to return it to him because she feels their former relationship was not an equal one. She also states that while she was the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of LexCorp, she brought the stock up 38% and removed certain departments in the science division finding them useless or in order to save money. Lex Luthor exacerbates the situation by verbally and physically abusing her. It is repeatedly implied that their relationship was not solely platonic. Mercy grudgingly assists Luthor's escape from the Justice League. However, his deceitful manipulation of another devoted servant causes Mercy to see their years together in a different light. After his capture, Mercy hangs up on Lex Luthor during his single phone call when he requests help in obtaining a [[lawyer]] and [[Physician|doctors]] to treat his Kryptonite-caused cancer.

===''Justice League Unlimited''===
Mercy Graves reappears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "Clash". She was seen at Lex Luthor's side again implying that her new self-confidence is gone.

==Comics==
[[Image:MercyII.jpg|thumb|180px|Mercy Graves as a member of ''Infinity Inc''. From the cover of ''Infinity Inc.'' vol. 2, #9 (July 2008); art by [[Pete Woods]]]]
Mercy Graves first appears in the [[DC Universe]] in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #735 (August 1999), during the "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]" storyline in the [[Batman]] titles. This version of Mercy has blonde hair and does not wear a chauffeur's uniform. She is later joined by another female bodyguard in Luthor's employ, Hope. It is suggested that the two may be [[Bana-Mighdall|Amazons]], as they have exchanged blows with Superman. This possibility is referenced in the ''President Luthor: Secret Files and Origins'' comic when the sorceress [[Circe (comics)|Circe]] appears at the White House demanding to meet with Lex. Hope and Mercy inform Circe that they can always recognize her, no matter what disguise or form she might take, suggesting some previous familiarity. After temporarily changing them into birds Circe tells Lex that he will need to hire new Amazon bodyguards.

Although Hope's time as a LexCorp employee has passed, Mercy can be seen with the fugitive Lex Luthor after he is driven from the Presidency. Despite her loyalty to Luthor, she has still shown some humanity even while in his employ; when Superman was searching for Lois Lane after she was abducted and impersonated by the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], Mercy saw him during his search, and, in that moment, saw him not as an alien, but as a man who had lost everything. A Mercy-Harley Quinn fight is featured in ''[[Action Comics]]'' #765 (May 2000).

In the series ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'', Mercy is seen alongside Luthor at the unveiling of his "Be Your Own Hero" program, and is injured when she fires several gunshots at [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|Steel]], which he deflects and sends back at her, hitting her in the right hand. She is later shown in Luthor's employ in ''52'' Week 40.

Mercy has appeared in the ''[[Infinity, Inc.]]'' series, apparently wanting to atone for her past deeds. In #8, she takes on the moniker "Vanilla" and wears a costume equipped with a special mask that will keep her identity hidden from the likes of Superman and Lex Luthor. In #10, she almost beats a man to death. She leaves the team soon after, accepting the fact that she is not "hero" material.

Mercy's [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]] heritage is confirmed in ''[[Justice League: Cry for Justice]]'', when the supervillain [[Prometheus (DC Comics)|Prometheus]] nearly kills [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] with god-forged bullets he claimed he bought from Mercy.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League: Cry for Justice'' #1-7 (Sept. 2009 – April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Mercy Graves is reintroduced as an [[Asian American]]. She works as Lex Luthor's personal assistant and manages LexCorp during his absence.&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League'' #31 (June 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
====Animated====
* In ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' episode "[[The Batman/Superman Story, Part One]]", Mercy Graves (voiced by [[Gwendoline Yeo]]) appears again as Lex Luthor's right hand, only this time she appears to be of [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] descent, gunslinging skills, and possessing a pair of twin laser guns.
* Mercy Graves appears in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]''. She appears as Lex Luthor's main bodyguard and is depicted as a woman with a cybernetic right arm concealing powerful weapons, who speaks very little. In the episode "Targets", when assassins [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]] and [[Sportsmaster]] attempt to kill him and two Asian diplomats, Mercy uses her mechanical arm that contains projectile weapons to stop them. The diplomats, grateful and impressed by the weaponry within Mercy, make a deal with Luthor. She returns in "Usual Suspects," where she acts as Luthor's bodyguard during the battle at [[Santa Prisca]]. She blasts [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]] when he attempts to arrest Luthor, and the two escape by helicopter. She reappears alongside Luthor in "Satisfaction", helping him escape a vengeful [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] who bombs his office before they find Harper inside a parking garage blowing up Luthor's car. Mercy and Roy engage in a duel across the garage, with Roy using various weapons (like a [[crossbow]] and bombs) and techniques to avoid or knock out Mercy, most of which fail him. He eventually succeeds in blowing off her cybernetic arm and knocking her into a car windshield. Later, Roy shows [[Green Arrow]] and his [[Project Cadmus|Cadmus]] clone Red Arrow a cybernetic arm more powerful than Mercy's, and declares [[Speedy (comics)|Speedy]] "dead", preferring the sound of "Arsenal".

====Live-action====
* A character who shares some similarity with Graves appears in ''[[Smallville]]''. She is a combination character, created through an amalgamation of Mercy Graves, [[Eve Teschmacher]], and [[Lena Luthor]]. Her birth name was '''Lutessa Lena Luthor''', but she is more commonly known in the series as '''[[Characters of Smallville#Tess Mercer|Tess Mercer]]'''. She is also referred to by [[Oliver Queen]], with whom she has a romantic fling, as Mercy. She makes her first appearance in "Plastique." She is portrayed by [[Cassidy Freeman]].
* Mercy Graves appears in the [[Supergirl (season 4)|fourth season]] of [[The CW]] series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', portrayed by [[Rhona Mitra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2018/07/supergirl-rhona-mitra-mercy-graves-on-the-cw-series-robert-baker-also-cast-1202435472/ |title=‘Supergirl’: Rhona Mitra To Play Mercy Graves on the CW Series, Robert Baker Also Cast |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |date=July 27, 2018 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180728030636/https://deadline.com/2018/07/supergirl-rhona-mitra-mercy-graves-on-the-cw-series-robert-baker-also-cast-1202435472/ |archive-date=July 28, 2018 |dead-url=no |access-date=July 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is a former [[Project Cadmus]] agent alongside her brother Otis Graves. Similar to her ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' counterpart, Mercy was also head of security for what was then known as Luthor-Corp under Lex Luthor's reign. In the episode "Fallout," Mercy and Otis are apprehended by the DEO following Mercy's fight with [[Lena Luthor]] at L-Corp. They persuade a DEO agent named Jensen to release them as they use Lena Luthor's lead-dispersion device to spread Kryptonite into the air which weakened Supergirl. In the episode "Ahimsa," Agent Jensen assists Mercy Graves and Otis into furthering their anti-alien goals by releasing a [[Hellgrammite (comics)|Hellgrammite]] and an unnamed Kopy from the DEO custody where they cause havoc at a carnival. After the Kryptonite in the air is gone and the Kopy is defeated, Mercy and Otis are seemingly killed by the Hellgrammite who surrendered to the DEO.

===Film===
====Animated====
* Mercy Graves (sporting her DCAU design) is voiced by [[Tara Strong]] in ''[[Superman: Brainiac Attacks]]''. She is seen at Lex Luthor's side, even to the part where Brainiac uses LexCorp technology to build a new body. Mercy discovers Jimmy looking for evidence against Luthor and attacks him. Eventually, Jimmy uses a robot to knock her out, though destroying his camera in the process. While Luthor is recuperating in the hospital being interviewed following Brainiac's attack, he quietly tells Mercy to call all his lawyers when a small Kryptonite shard found by detectives in his facility exposes his involvement with Brainiac's rampage.

* Mercy Graves appears in ''[[Superman: Doomsday]]'' voiced by [[Cree Summer]]. In the movie, she watches a project with Lex Luthor that involves LexCorp secretly, and illegally, digging deep underground, where they accidentally unearth the villain [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]. Luthor tells Mercy to make sure that all evidence of LexCorp's involvement never existed. When Doomsday and Superman kill each other in an epic battle, Luthor loses his chance to be responsible for Superman's death, both directly and indirectly through Mercy's destruction of the evidence. Once Mercy informs him that there is no link back to LexCorp, he shoots her in the head to ensure absolutely nothing can be traced back to him.

* Mercy Graves appears in ''[[The Death of Superman (film)|The Death of Superman]]'' and ''[[Reign of the Supermen (film)|Reign of the Superman]]'' voiced by [[Erica Luttrell]].

====Live-action====
[[Tao Okamoto]] portrays Mercy Graves in the 2016 film ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', making it Mercy's first official live-action appearance.&lt;ref name="Bussey"/&gt; This version is the personal assistant of Lex Luthor. She is killed in a bombing of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]] masterminded by Luthor during a Congressional hearing, in order to both discredit Superman and receive approval to use salvaged Kryptonian technology (first seen in 2013's ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'') against him.

===Video games===
* Mercy Graves appeared in ''[[Superman: Shadow of Apokolips]]'' voiced by [[Lauren Tom]].
* Mercy Graves appears as a main character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Cree Summer reprising the role from ''Superman Doomsday''. She is first seen at [[Stryker's Island]] with "The Rookie" on her side to help break out Lex Luthor before answering a question from [[Commissioner Gordon]] that involves a break in at Waynetech. Following her success on freeing her employer and the Rookie, Graves is later accompanied by [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] to free [[Metallo]] from beneath the prison. While the Stryker's Island breakout was a success, Graves is later seen flying with Luthor to escape the [[Justice League]] after their arrival on Stryker's, then later accidentally crashed The Joker's getaway helicopter.

Panspermia hypotheses propose (for example) that [[microscopic life|microscopic life-forms]] that can survive the effects of space (such as [[extremophile]]s) can become trapped in debris ejected into space after collisions between planets and [[small Solar System bodies]] that harbor life. Some [[organism]]s may travel dormant for an extended amount of time before colliding randomly with other planets or intermingling with [[protoplanetary disk]]s. Under certain ideal impact circumstances (into a body of water, for example), and ideal conditions on a new planet's surfaces, it is possible that the surviving organisms could become active and begin to colonize their new environment. Panspermia studies concentrate not on  [[abiogenesis|how life began]], but on the methods that may cause its distribution in the Universe.&lt;ref name="Wesson"&gt;A variation of the panspermia hypothesis is '''necropanspermia''' which astronomer Paul Wesson describes as follows: "The vast majority of organisms reach a new home in the Milky Way in a technically dead state … Resurrection may, however, be possible." {{cite news|last= Grossman |first= Lisa |title = All Life on Earth Could Have Come From Alien Zombies |publisher= ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |date= 2010-11-10 |url= https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2010/11/necropanspermia/|accessdate= 10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoyle, F 1981. pp35-49"&gt;Hoyle, F. and Wickramasinghe, N.C.

Pseudo-panspermia (sometimes called ''"soft panspermia"'' or ''"molecular panspermia"'') argues that the pre-biotic organic building-blocks of life originated in space, became incorporated in the solar nebula from which planets condensed, and were further—and continuously—distributed to planetary surfaces where life then emerged ([[abiogenesis]]).&lt;ref name="Klyce 2001"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.panspermia.org/oseti.htm | title = Panspermia Asks New Questions | accessdate= 25 July 2013 | last = Klyce | first = Brig | date = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |doi= 10.1117/12.435366 |chapter= Panspermia asks new questions |title= The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) in the Optical Spectrum III |journal= Proc.

The chemistry leading to [[life]] may have begun shortly after the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago, during a habitable epoch when the Universe was only 10 to 17 million years old. Though the presence of life is confirmed only on the Earth, some scientists think that extraterrestrial life is not only plausible, but probable or inevitable. Probes and instruments have started examining other planets and moons in the Solar System and in other planetary systems for evidence of having once supported simple life, and projects such as [[SETI]] attempt to detect [[radio transmission]]s from possible extraterrestrial civilizations.

In an Origins Symposium presentation on April 7, 2009, physicist [[Stephen Hawking]] stated his opinion about what humans may find when venturing into space, such as the possibility of alien life through the theory of panspermia: "Life could spread from planet to planet or from stellar system to stellar system, carried on meteors."&lt;ref name="Stephen Hawking"&gt;{{cite news|last=Weaver|first=Rheyanne|title=Ruminations on other worlds|url=http://www.statepress.com/archive/node/5745|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724233755/http://www.statepress.com/archive/node/5745|dead-url=yes|archive-date=July 24, 2011|accessdate=25 July 2013|newspaper=statepress.com|date=April 7, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Radiopanspermia ===
In 1903, [[Svante Arrhenius]] published in his article ''The Distribution of Life in Space'',&lt;ref&gt;"Die Verbreitung des Lebens im Weltenraum" (the "Distribution of Life in Space"). Published in ''Die Umschau''. 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; the hypothesis now called radiopanspermia, that microscopic forms of life can be propagated in space, driven by the [[radiation pressure]] from stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nicholson | first1 = Wayne L. | year = 2009 | title = Ancient micronauts: interplanetary transport of microbes by cosmic impacts | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 17 | issue = 6| pages = 243–250 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2009.03.004 | pmid = 19464895 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrhenius argued that particles at a critical size below 1.5 μm would be propagated at high speed by radiation pressure of the Sun. However, because its effectiveness decreases with increasing size of the particle, this mechanism holds for very tiny particles only, such as single bacterial spores.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt; The main criticism of radiopanspermia hypothesis came from [[Iosif Shklovsky]] and [[Carl Sagan]], who pointed out the proofs of the lethal action of space radiations ([[UV]] and [[X-ray]]s) in the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Shklovskii, I.

Then, data gathered by the orbital experiments [[Exobiology Radiation Assembly|ERA]], [[BIOPAN]], [[EXOSTACK]] and [[EXPOSE]], determined that isolated spores, including those of ''[[B. subtilis]]'', were killed by several orders of magnitude if exposed to the full space environment for a mere few seconds, but if shielded against solar [[UV]], the spores were capable of surviving in space for up to six years while embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites).&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt;&lt;ref name=Protection&gt;{{cite journal|title=Protection of Bacterial Spores in Space, a Contribution to the Discussion on Panspermia|journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere : The Journal of the International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life|volume=31|issue=6|pages=527–47|bibcode=2002ESASP.518..105R|pmid=11770260|year=2001|author1=Horneck|first1=G|last2=Rettberg|first2=P|last3=Reitz|first3=G|last4=Wehner|first4=J|last5=Eschweiler|first5=U|last6=Strauch|first6=K|last7=Panitz|first7=C|last8=Starke|first8=V|last9=Baumstark-Khan|first9=C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though minimal protection is required to shelter a spore against UV radiation, exposure to solar UV and cosmic ionizing radiation of unprotected DNA, break it up into its bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rahn | first1 = R.O. | last2 = Hosszu | first2 = J.L. | year = 1969 | title = Influence of relative humidity on the photochemistry of DNA films | journal = Biochim.

Based on experimental data on radiation effects and DNA stability, it has been concluded that for such long travel times, boulder-sized rocks which are greater than or equal to 1 meter in diameter are required to effectively shield resistant microorganisms, such as bacterial spores against galactic [[cosmic radiation]].&lt;ref name='C.

=== Lithopanspermia ===

Lithopanspermia, the transfer of organisms in rocks from one planet to another either through interplanetary or interstellar space, remains speculative. Although there is no evidence that lithopanspermia has occurred in the Solar System, the various stages have become amenable to experimental testing.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.mimet.2009.10.004 |title=Experimental methods for studying microbial survival in extraterrestrial environments |date=2010 |last1=Olsson-Francis |first1=Karen |last2=Cockell |first2=Charles S. |journal=Journal of Microbiological Methods |volume=80 |pages=1–13 |pmid=19854226 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Planetary ejection''' — For lithopanspermia to occur, researchers have suggested that microorganisms must survive ejection from a planetary surface which involves extreme forces of acceleration and shock with associated temperature excursions. Hypothetical values of shock pressures experienced by ejected rocks are obtained with Martian meteorites, which suggest the shock pressures of approximately 5 to 55&amp;nbsp;GPa, acceleration of 3&amp;nbsp;Mm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and [[Jerk (physics)|jerk]] of 6&amp;nbsp;Gm/s&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and post-shock temperature increases of about 1 K to 1000 K.&lt;ref name='Cockell 2008'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11084-007-9112-3 |pmid=17906941 |title=The Interplanetary Exchange of Photosynthesis |date=2007 |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles S. |journal=Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=87–104|bibcode=2008OLEB...38...87C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/ast.2007.0134 |title=Microbial Rock Inhabitants Survive Hypervelocity Impacts on Mars-Like Host Planets: First Phase of Lithopanspermia Experimentally Tested |date=2008 |last1=Horneck |first1=Gerda |display-authors=4 |last2=Stöffler |first2=Dieter |last3=Ott |first3=Sieglinde |last4=Hornemann |first4=Ulrich |last5=Cockell |first5=Charles S. |last6=Moeller |first6=Ralf |last7=Meyer |first7=Cornelia |last8=De Vera |first8=Jean-Pierre |last9=Fritz |first9=Jörg |last10=Schade |first10=Sara |last11=Artemieva |first11=Natalia A. |journal=Astrobiology |volume=8 |pages=17–44 |pmid=18237257 |issue=1|bibcode=2008AsBio...8...17H }}&lt;/ref&gt; To determine the effect of acceleration during ejection on microorganisms, rifle and ultracentrifuge methods were successfully used under simulated outer space conditions.&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt;
* '''Survival in transit''' — The survival of microorganisms has been studied extensively using both simulated facilities and in low Earth orbit. A large number of microorganisms have been selected for exposure experiments. It is possible to separate these microorganisms into two groups, the human-borne, and the [[extremophiles]]. Studying the human-borne microorganisms is significant for human welfare and future manned missions; whilst the extremophiles are vital for studying the physiological requirements of survival in space.&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt;
* '''Atmospheric entry''' — An important aspect of the lithopanspermia hypothesis to test is that microbes situated on or within rocks could survive hypervelocity entry from space through Earth's atmosphere (Cockell, 2008). As with planetary ejection, this is experimentally tractable, with sounding rockets and orbital vehicles being used for microbiological experiments.&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt;&lt;ref name='Cockell 2008' /&gt; ''[[B. subtilis]]'' spores inoculated onto [[granite]] domes were subjected to hypervelocity atmospheric transit (twice) by launch to a ∼120&amp;nbsp;km altitude on an Orion two-stage rocket. The spores were shown to have survived on the sides of the rock, but they did not survive on the forward-facing surface that was subjected to a maximum temperature of 145&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/ast.2005.5.726 |title=Bacillus subtilis Spores on Artificial Meteorites Survive Hypervelocity Atmospheric Entry: Implications for Lithopanspermia |date=2005 |last1=Fajardo-Cavazos |first1=Patricia |last2=Link |first2=Lindsey |last3=Melosh |first3=H.

During reentry, the rock samples were subjected to temperatures and pressure loads comparable to those experienced in meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0032-0633(02)00018-1 |title=Do meteoroids of sedimentary origin survive terrestrial atmospheric entry?

As photosynthetic organisms must be close to the surface of a rock to obtain sufficient light energy, atmospheric transit might act as a filter against them by ablating the surface layers of the rock. Although [[cyanobacteria]] have been shown to survive the desiccating, freezing conditions of space in orbital experiments, this would be of no benefit as the STONE experiment showed that they cannot survive atmospheric entry.&lt;ref name='filter'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1089/ast.2006.0038 |title=Interplanetary Transfer of Photosynthesis: An Experimental Demonstration of a Selective Dispersal Filter in Planetary Island Biogeography |date=2007 |last1=Cockell |first1=Charles S. |display-authors=4 |last2=Brack |first2=André |last3=Wynn-Williams |first3=David D. |last4=Baglioni |first4=Pietro |last5=Brandstätter |first5=Franz |last6=Demets |first6=René |last7=Edwards |first7=Howell G.M. |last8=Gronstal |first8=Aaron L. |last9=Kurat |first9=Gero |last10=Lee |first10=Pascal |last11=Osinski |first11=Gordon R. |last12=Pearce |first12=David A. |last13=Pillinger |first13=Judith M. |last14=Roten |first14=Claude-Alain |last15=Sancisi-Frey |first15=Suzy |journal=Astrobiology |volume=7 |pages=1–9 |pmid=17407400 |issue=1|bibcode=2007AsBio...7....1C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, non-photosynthetic organisms deep within rocks have a chance to survive the exit and entry process. (See also: [[Impact survival]].)  Research presented at the European Planetary Science Congress in 2015 suggests that ejection, entry and impact is survivable for some simple organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://astrobiology.com/2013/09/could-life-have-survived-a-fall-to-earth.html |title= Could Life Have Survived a Fall to Earth? |work=EPSC |date=12 September 2013 |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accidental panspermia ===
[[Thomas Gold]], a professor of [[astronomy]], suggested in 1960 the hypothesis of "Cosmic Garbage", that life on Earth might have originated accidentally from a pile of [[waste]] products dumped on Earth long ago by extraterrestrial beings.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, T. "Cosmic Garbage", Air Force and Space Digest, 65 (May 1960).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Directed panspermia ===
{{Main|Directed panspermia}}
Directed panspermia concerns the deliberate transport of microorganisms in space, sent to Earth to start life here, or sent from Earth to seed new planetary systems with life by [[introduced species]] of microorganisms on lifeless planets. The Nobel prize winner [[Francis Crick]], along with [[Leslie Orgel]] proposed that life may have been purposely spread by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization,&lt;ref name="Crick_Orgel" /&gt; but considering an early "[[RNA world]]" Crick noted later that life may have originated on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/reprint/7/1/238.pdf Anticipating an RNA world. Some past speculations on the origin of life: where are they today?]" by L. E. Orgel and F. H. C. Crick in ''FASEB J.'' (1993) Volume 7 pages 238–239.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that 'directed' panspermia was proposed in order to counteract various objections, including the argument that microbes would be inactivated by the space environment and [[cosmic radiation]] before they could make a chance encounter with Earth.&lt;ref name='C. Clark'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Planetary Interchange of Bioactive Material: Probability Factors and Implications | journal = Origins of Life and Evolution of the Biosphere | date = February 2001 | first = Benton C.

Conversely, active directed panspermia has been proposed to secure and expand life in space.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; This may be motivated by biotic ethics that values, and seeks to propagate, the basic patterns of our organic gene/protein life-form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mautner | first = Michael N. | title =Life-centered ethics, and the human future in space | journal = Bioethics | volume = 23 | pages = 433–440 | date = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8519.2008.00688.x | pmid=19077128 | url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFLifeCenteredBioethics2009Paper.pdf |issue =8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panbiotic program would seed new planetary systems nearby, and clusters of new stars in interstellar clouds. These young targets, where local life would not have formed yet, avoid any interference with local life.

For example, microbial payloads launched by solar sails at speeds up to 0.0001 ''c'' (30,000&amp;nbsp;m/s) would reach targets at 10 to 100 light-years in 0.1 million to 1 million years. Fleets of microbial capsules can be aimed at clusters of new stars in star-forming clouds, where they may land on planets or be captured by asteroids and comets and later delivered to planets. Payloads may contain [[extremophile]]s for diverse environments and [[cyanobacteria]] similar to early microorganisms. Hardy multicellular organisms (rotifer cysts) may be included to induce higher evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Mautner | first = Michael Noah Ph.D.| author-link =Michael Noah Mautner | title =Seeding the Universe with Life: Securing our Cosmological Future | publisher=Legacy Books (www.amazon.com) | date = 2000 | isbn = 978-0-476-00330-9 | url = http://www.astro-ecology.com/PDFSeedingtheUniverse2005Book.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The probability of hitting the target zone can be calculated from &lt;math&gt;P(\text{target}) = \frac{A(\text{target})}{\pi (dy)^2} = \frac{a r(\text{target})^2 v^2}{(tp)^2 d^4}&lt;/math&gt; where ''A''(target) is the cross-section of the target area, ''dy'' is the positional uncertainty at arrival; ''a'' – constant (depending on units), ''r''(target) is the radius of the target area; ''v'' the velocity of the probe; (tp) the targeting precision (arcsec/yr); and ''d'' the distance to the target, guided by high-resolution astrometry of 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; arcsec/yr (all units in SIU). These calculations show that relatively near target stars(Alpha PsA, Beta Pictoris) can be seeded by milligrams of launched microbes; while seeding the Rho Ophiochus star-forming cloud requires hundreds of kilograms of dispersed capsules.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

=== Pseudo-panspermia ===
{{further| List of interstellar and circumstellar molecules|Abiogenesis#Extraterrestrial organic molecules}}

Pseudo-panspermia (sometimes called soft panspermia, molecular panspermia or quasi-panspermia) proposes that the organic molecules used for life originated in space and were incorporated in the solar nebula, from which the planets condensed and were further —and continuously— distributed to planetary surfaces where life then emerged ([[abiogenesis]]).&lt;ref name="Klyce 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; From the early 1970s it was becoming evident that interstellar dust consisted of a large component of organic molecules. The first suggestion came from [[Chandra Wickramasinghe]], who proposed a polymeric composition based on the molecule [[formaldehyde]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wickramasinghe | first1 = N.C. | year = 1974 | title = Formaldehyde Polymers in Interstellar Space | journal = Nature | volume = 252 | issue = 5483| pages = 462–463 | doi=10.1038/252462a0| bibcode = 1974Natur.252..462W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interstellar molecules are formed by chemical reactions within very sparse interstellar or circumstellar clouds of dust and gas. Usually this occurs when a molecule becomes [[ion]]ized, often as the result of an interaction with [[cosmic ray]]s. This positively charged molecule then draws in a nearby reactant by electrostatic attraction of the neutral molecule's electrons. Molecules can also be generated by reactions between neutral atoms and molecules, although this process is generally slower.&lt;ref name="pnas103"/&gt; The dust plays a critical role of shielding the molecules from the ionizing effect of ultraviolet radiation emitted by stars.&lt;ref name="brown_pais95"/&gt;

A 2008 analysis of &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C isotopic ratios of organic compounds found in the [[Murchison meteorite]] indicates a non-terrestrial origin for these molecules rather than terrestrial contamination.

In August 2012, and in a world first, astronomers at [[Copenhagen University]] reported the detection of a specific sugar molecule, [[glycolaldehyde]], in a distant star system.

In 2013, the [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] (ALMA Project) confirmed that researchers have discovered an important pair of prebiotic molecules in the icy particles in [[interstellar space]] (ISM). The chemicals, found in a giant cloud of gas about 25,000 light-years from Earth in ISM, may be a precursor to a key component of DNA and the other may have a role in the formation of an important [[amino acid]]. Researchers found a molecule called cyanomethanimine, which produces [[adenine]], one of the four [[nucleobases]] that form the "rungs" in the ladder-like structure of DNA. The other molecule, called [[ethanamine]], is thought to play a role in forming [[alanine]], one of the twenty amino acids in the genetic code. Previously, scientists thought such processes took place in the very tenuous gas between the stars. The new discoveries, however, suggest that the chemical formation sequences for these molecules occurred not in gas, but on the surfaces of ice grains in interstellar space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/2041-8205/765/1/L9 |title=The Detection of Interstellar Ethanimine (Ch3Chnh) from Observations Taken During the Gbt Primos Survey |date=2013 |last1=Loomis |first1=Ryan A. |display-authors=4 |last2=Zaleski|first2=Daniel P. |last3=Steber |first3=Amanda L. |last4=Neill |first4=Justin L. |last5=Muckle|first5=Matthew T. |last6=Harris |first6=Brent J. |last7=Hollis |first7=Jan M. |last8=Jewell |first8=Philip R.|last9=Lattanzi|first9=Valerio |last10=Lovas |first10=Frank J. |last11=Martinez |first11=Oscar|last12=McCarthy|first12=Michael C. |last13=Remijan |first13=Anthony J. |last14=Pate |first14=Brooks H.|last15=Corby|first15=Joanna F. |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=765 |issue=1 |pages=L9|bibcode=2013ApJ...765L...9L|arxiv=1302.1121}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA ALMA scientist Anthony Remijan stated that finding these molecules in an interstellar gas cloud means that important building blocks for DNA and amino acids can 'seed' newly formed planets with the chemical precursors for life.&lt;ref&gt;Finley, Dave (February 28, 2013) [https://www.nrao.edu/pr/2013/newchem/ Discoveries Suggest Icy Cosmic Start for Amino Acids and DNA Ingredients].

=== Hypotheses on extraterrestrial sources of illnesses ===
Hoyle and Wickramasinghe have speculated that several outbreaks of illnesses on Earth are of extraterrestrial origins, including the [[1918 flu pandemic]], and certain outbreaks of [[polio]] and [[mad cow disease]].  For the 1918 flu pandemic they hypothesized that [[comet]]ary dust brought the virus to Earth simultaneously at multiple locations—a view almost universally dismissed by experts on this pandemic. Hoyle also speculated that [[HIV]] came from outer space.&lt;ref name="Byrne2008"&gt;{{cite book| first =Joseph Patrick | last = Byrne |title= Encyclopedia of Pestilence, Pandemics, and Plagues | type = entry | chapter = Panspermia |url= https://books.google.com/?id=HlTIYgEACAAJ |pages= 454–55| isbn = 9780313341014 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Hoyle's death, ''[[The Lancet]]'' published a [[letter to the editor]] from Wickramasinghe and two of his colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wickramasinghe |first1= C| last2=Wainwright | first2 = M| last3=Narlikar | first3 = J |title= SARS—a clue to its origins?|journal=Lancet|date=May 24, 2003 |volume= 361|issue=9371|pages=1832|pmid=12781581|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13440-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they hypothesized that the [[virus]] that causes [[severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS) could be extraterrestrial in origin and not originated from chickens.

=== Case studies ===
* A [[meteorite]] originating from [[Mars]] known as [[ALH84001]] was shown in 1996 to contain [[microscopic]] structures resembling small terrestrial [[nanobacteria]]. When the discovery was announced, many immediately conjectured that these were [[fossil]]s and were the first evidence of [[extraterrestrial life]] — making headlines around the world. Public interest soon started to dwindle as most experts started to agree that these structures were not indicative of life, but could instead be formed abiotically from [[organic molecules]]. However, in November 2009, a team of scientists at [[Johnson Space Center]], including David McKay, reasserted that there was "strong evidence that life may have existed on ancient Mars", after having reexamined the meteorite and finding [[magnetite#Biological occurrences|magnetite]] crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=New Study Adds to Finding of Ancient Life Signs in Mars Meteorite | url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/2009/J09-030.html | publisher=[[NASA]] | date= 2009-11-30 | accessdate= 1 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1 = Thomas-Keprta | first1 = K.| first2=S | last2 = Clemett| first3= D | last3 = McKay| first4=E | last4 = Gibson| first5=S | last5 = Wentworth |last-author-amp= yes |date= 2009|title= Origin of Magnetite Nanocrystals in Martian Meteorite ALH84001|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|issue=21|pages=6631–6677|doi= 10.1016/j.gca.2009.05.064 |volume= 73|bibcode = 2009GeCoA..73.6631T| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1258983| type = Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate fragment of the [[Orgueil (meteorite)|Orgueil]] meteorite (kept in a sealed glass jar since its discovery) was found in 1965 to have a seed capsule embedded in it, whilst the original glassy layer on the outside remained undisturbed. Despite great initial excitement, the seed was found to be that of a European [[Juncaceae]] or Rush plant that had been glued into the fragment and camouflaged using [[coal dust]]. The outer "fusion layer" was in fact glue. Whilst the perpetrator of this hoax is unknown, it is thought that they sought to influence the 19th century debate on [[spontaneous generation]] — rather than panspermia — by demonstrating the transformation of inorganic to biological matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contaminated Meteorite|journal=Science|volume=146|issue=3648|pages=1157–61|doi=10.1126/science.146.3648.1157|pmid=17832241|year=1964|last1=Anders|first1=E.|last2=Dufresne|first2=E.

[[File:Blacksmoker in Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hydrothermal vent]]s are able to support [[extremophile]] bacteria on [[Earth]] and may also support life in other parts of the cosmos.]]
Until the 1970s, [[life]] was thought to depend on its access to [[sunlight]]. Even life in the ocean depths, where sunlight cannot reach, was believed to obtain its nourishment either from consuming organic detritus rained down from the surface waters or from eating animals that did.&lt;ref name="smoker"&gt;{{cite web |title= Black Smokers and Giant Worms |author=Chamberlin, Sean |date=1999 |work=Fullerton College |url=http://www.courseworld.com/ocean/smokers.html |accessdate=11 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1977, during an exploratory dive to the [[Galapagos Rift]] in the deep-sea exploration submersible ''[[DSV Alvin|Alvin]]'', scientists discovered colonies of assorted creatures clustered around undersea volcanic features known as [[black smoker]]s.&lt;ref name="smoker" /&gt;  It was soon determined that the basis for this food chain is a form of [[bacterium]] &lt;!--Find name/species.--&gt;that derives its energy from [[Redox|oxidation]] of reactive chemicals, such as [[hydrogen]] or [[hydrogen sulfide]], that bubble up from the Earth's interior. This [[chemosynthesis]] revolutionized the study of biology by revealing that terrestrial life need not be Sun-dependent; it only requires water and an energy gradient in order to exist.

The discovery of deep-sea [[ecosystem]]s, along with advancements in the fields of [[astrobiology]], observational [[astronomy]] and discovery of large varieties of extremophiles, opened up a new avenue in astrobiology by massively expanding the number of possible [[Planetary habitability|extraterrestrial habitats]] and possible transport of hardy microbial life through vast distances.&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt;

=== Research in outer space ===
{{See also|List of microorganisms tested in outer space}}
The question of whether certain [[microorganism]]s can survive in the harsh environment of outer space has intrigued biologists since the beginning of spaceflight, and opportunities were provided to expose samples to space. The first American tests were made in 1966, during the [[Gemini IX]] and [[Gemini XII|XII]] missions, when samples of [[bacteriophage]] T1 and spores of ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]'' were exposed to outer space for 16.8 h and 6.5 h, respectively.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt;&lt;ref name="Experimental methods" /&gt; Other basic life sciences research in [[low Earth orbit]] started in 1966 with the Soviet biosatellite program [[Bion (satellite)|Bion]] and the U.S. [[Biosatellite program]]. Thus, the plausibility of panspermia can be evaluated by examining life forms on Earth for their capacity to survive in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The origin of life, panspermia and a proposal to seed the Universe | journal = Plant Science | date = December 2008 | first = David Tepfer | volume = 175 | issue = 6 | pages = 756–760 | doi = 10.1016/j.plantsci.2008.08.007 | last1 = Tepfer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following experiments carried on [[low Earth orbit]] specifically tested some aspects of panspermia or lithopanspermia:

==== ERA ====
[[File:STS-46 EURECA deployment.jpg|thumb|[[European Retrievable Carrier|EURECA]] facility deployment in 1992]]
The [[Exobiology Radiation Assembly]] (ERA) was a 1992 experiment on board the [[European Retrievable Carrier]] (EURECA) on the biological effects of [[space radiation]]. EURECA was an unmanned 4.5 tonne satellite with a payload of 15 experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1992-049B-03 | title = Exobiology and Radiation Assembly (ERA) |accessdate=22 July 2013 | date = 1992 | work = [[ESA]] | publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was an [[astrobiology]] mission developed by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA). [[Spore]]s of different strains of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' and the ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' [[plasmid]] [[pUC19]] were exposed to selected conditions of space (space vacuum and/or defined wavebands and intensities of solar ultraviolet radiation). After the approximately 11-month mission, their responses were studied in terms of survival, [[mutagenesis]] in the ''his'' (''B. subtilis'') or ''[[lac operon|lac]]'' [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] (pUC19), induction of [[DNA]] strand breaks, efficiency of [[DNA repair]] systems, and the role of external protective agents. The data were compared with those of a simultaneously running ground control experiment:&lt;ref name=Dose&gt;{{cite journal | title = ERA-experiment "space biochemistry" | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 16 | issue = 8 | date= 1995 |pages = 119–129 |doi = 10.1016/0273-1177(95)00280-R | last1 = Zhang | pmid = 11542696| bibcode = 1995AdSpR..16..119D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Horneck'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Biological responses to space: results of the experiment "Exobiological Unit" of ERA on EURECA I | journal = Adv.

* The survival of spores treated with the vacuum of space, however shielded against solar radiation, is substantially increased, if they are exposed in multilayers and/or in the presence of [[glucose]] as protective.
* All spores in "artificial meteorites", i.e. embedded in [[clay]]s or simulated [[Martian soil]], are killed.
* Vacuum treatment leads to an increase of [[mutation frequency]] in spores, but not in [[plasmid]] DNA.
* Extraterrestrial solar [[ultraviolet]] radiation is [[mutagen]]ic, induces strand breaks in the DNA and reduces survival substantially.
* Action [[spectroscopy]] confirms results of previous space experiments of a synergistic action of  [[Vacuum#Outer space|space vacuum]] and [[Ultraviolet|solar UV radiation]] with [[DNA]] being the critical target.
* The decrease in viability of the microorganisms could be correlated with the increase in [[DNA repair#DNA damage|DNA damage]].
* The purple membranes, amino acids and urea were not measurably affected by the dehydrating condition of open space, if sheltered from solar radiation. Plasmid DNA, however, suffered a significant amount of strand breaks under these conditions.&lt;ref name=Dose /&gt;

==== BIOPAN ====
[[BIOPAN]] is a multi-user experimental facility installed on the external surface of the Russian [[Foton (space programs)|Foton descent capsule]]. Experiments developed for BIOPAN are designed to investigate the effect of the space environment on biological material after exposure between 13 and 17 days.&lt;ref name='Kayser'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kayser.it/index.php/life-science/facilities/biopan | title = BIOPAN Pan for exposure to space environment |accessdate=17 July 2013 | date = 2013 | work = Kayser Italia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments in BIOPAN are exposed to [[Insolation|solar]] and [[Cosmic ray|cosmic radiation]], the space vacuum and weightlessness, or a selection thereof. Of the 6 missions flown so far on BIOPAN between 1992 and 2007, dozens of experiments were conducted, and some analyzed the likelihood of panspermia. Some bacteria, [[lichen]]s (''[[Xanthoria elegans]]'', ''[[Rhizocarpon geographicum]]'' and their mycobiont cultures, the black Antarctic microfungi ''Cryomyces minteri'' and ''Cryomyces antarcticus''), spores, and even one animal ([[tardigrades]]) were found to have survived the harsh outer space environment and [[cosmic radiation]].&lt;ref name=Foton&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=2008cosp...37..660D |title=Experiment lithopanspermia: Test of interplanetary transfer and re-entry process of epi- and endolithic microbial communities in the FOTON-M3 Mission |author1=De La Torre Noetzel |first1=Rosa |volume=37 |date=2008 |pages=660 |journal=37th COSPAR Scientific Assembly.

==== EXOSTACK ====
[[File:1990 s32 LDEF stow.jpg|thumb|left|EXOSTACK on the [[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] satellite.]]

The German [[EXOSTACK]] experiment was deployed on 7 April 1984 on board the [[Long Duration Exposure Facility]] statellite.  30% of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' [[spores]] survived the nearly 6 years exposure when embedded in salt crystals, whereas 80% survived in the presence of glucose, which stabilize the structure of the cellular macromolecules, especially during vacuum-induced dehydration.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1128/MMBR.00016-09 |title=Space Microbiology |date=2010 |last1=Horneck |first1=G. |last2=Klaus |first2=D.

If shielded against solar [[UV]], spores of ''B. subtilis'' were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites).

The [[Tanpopo (mission)|Tanpopo]] mission is an orbital [[astrobiology]] experiment by Japan that is currently investigating the possible interplanetary transfer of life, [[organic compound]]s, and possible terrestrial particles in low Earth orbit. The Tanpopo experiment is taking place at the Exposed Facility located on the exterior of [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo module]] of the [[International Space Station]].

== Criticism ==
Panspermia is often criticized because it does not answer the question of the [[origin of life]] but merely places it on another celestial body. It was also criticized because it was thought it could not be tested experimentally.&lt;ref name='Experimental methods' /&gt;

Wallis and Wickramasinghe argued in 2004 that the transport of individual bacteria or clumps of bacteria, is overwhelmingly more important than lithopanspermia in terms of numbers of microbes transferred, even accounting for the death rate of unprotected bacteria in transit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wickramasinghe |first1=M.K. |author2=Wickramasinghe, C.| title=Interstellar transfer of planetary microbiota |journal=Mon.

Soc.| year=2004| volume=348| pages=52–57| bibcode=2004MNRAS.348...52W| doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.07355.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then it was found that isolated spores of ''[[B. subtilis]]'' were killed by several orders of magnitude if exposed to the full space environment for a mere few seconds. These results clearly negate the original panspermia hypothesis, which requires single spores as space travelers accelerated by the radiation pressure of the Sun, requiring many years to travel between the planets. However, if shielded against solar [[UV]], spores of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' were capable of surviving in space for up to 6 years, especially if embedded in clay or meteorite powder (artificial meteorites). The data support the likelihood of interplanetary transfer of microorganisms within [[meteorite]]s, the so-called '''lithopanspermia''' hypothesis.&lt;ref name='Gerda Horneck' /&gt;

In the game, players must run a pet-grooming salon by [[Micromanagement (gameplay)|micro-managing]] their staff. Pets must be groomed correctly to maintain customer satisfaction and to make sure that the salon is making money.

==Gameplay==
The game is set in a virtual grooming salon presented in a fixed, [[Virtual camera system#Third person view games|third person]], [[one-point perspective]] view. The player has a full view of the entire salon at all times, where service stations are affixed.  Players start off with one staff by the name of Piglina.  The objective of the game is to increase the salon's level.

Each game day lasts for approximately 2.5 minutes during which a number of customers will automatically enter the salon with their pets. Upon entering, an icon will appear on top of each customer’s pet to indicate which service they require. The player must then drag the pet to the appropriate station, after which an exclamation mark icon will appear on top of the pet. At that point, the player must tap on the pet in order for their staff to attend to it, and only afterward will the service be completed. Each pet may require more than one service per visit.

Customers and their pets have a limited amount of patience, which serves as a time limit for each service. If pets are not served within the time limit, the owner along with their pet will leave the salon without payment.

Once all services for the pet are completed, the customer and their pet will move on to the cashier to pay. Players must then tap on the cashier in order for their staff to collect payment. For each customer that successfully completes payment, the player will gain a certain amount of "happiness" and [[Virtual economy|in-game currency]].

===Levels===
Levels are earned by achieving a certain amount of "happiness" and accumulating a certain amount of [[Virtual economy|in-game currency]]. Requirements for the next level will be displayed at the end of each game day. As the salon gains levels, the game will also increase in difficulty.

===Upgrades===
At the end of each game day, players are also given the option to upgrade or purchase more stations, and upgrade or hire more staff.  Purchases can be made using premium currency called "Pet Points" or using the free, in-game currency earned throughout regular game play.

==Reception==
As of November 14, 2011, ''Pretty Pet Salon'' has received a user rating of 4.1 out of 5 stars on the [[Android Market]] based on 25,053 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://market.android.com/details?id=com.animoca.prettyPetSalon |title=Pretty Pet Salon - Android Market |work=[[Android Market]] |publisher=[[Google]] |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the iTunes US App Store, the game earned a user rating of 3 out of 5 stars for all versions of the game on the US [[App Store (iOS)]] based on 20,058 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pretty-pet-salon/id413048823 |title=App Store - Pretty Pet Salon |work=[[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 11, 2011, ''Pretty Pet Salon'' reached #6 on the global Top iPhone Games chart and #11 on the global Top Apps chart, both based on number of downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topappcharts.com/413048823/app-details-pretty-pet-salon.php |title=Pretty Pet Salon App Rank Graphs |work=Top App Charts |publisher=Headlight Software |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Requiem for Methuselah'''" is a [[Star Trek: The Original Series (season 3)|third season]] episode of the American [[science fiction]] television series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', first broadcast on February 14, 1969. Its repeat broadcast, on September 2, 1969, was the last official telecast of the series to air on [[NBC]]; it was replaced by ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and ''[[The Debbie Reynolds Show]]''. (''Star Trek'' would immediately debut in [[Television syndication|syndication]] on the following Monday, September 8, a full three years after its debut.) It is episode No. 74, production No. 76, written by [[Jerome Bixby]] and directed by [[Murray Golden]]. It guest-stars [[James Daly (actor)|James Daly]] as "Mr. Flint", and [[Louise Sorel]] as "Rayna Kapec" ("Kapec" is an anagram of Capek, after [[Karel Čapek]], who introduced the term ''[[robot]]'').

In the episode, the crew of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' encounters an immortal human.

==Plot==
The crew of the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] starship USS ''Enterprise'' is struck with deadly Rigellian fever, for which the only treatment is the mineral ryetalyn. They arrive at planet Holberg 917-G in search of the substance. [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]], first officer [[Spock]] and medical officer [[Leonard McCoy|Dr. McCoy]] beam down and are attacked by an airborne robot, which is called off by its master, Flint. Flint orders them to leave immediately, but is finally moved by their plight.

Flint gives the landing party two hours, offering the help of his sentry robot M4 to gather the mineral. Flint then escorts them to his home, which has an impressive art collection, including undiscovered paintings by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. Spock notices that the brushwork of the paintings is identical to Leonardo's, but his [[tricorder]] indicates that they are made with contemporary materials.

The party is introduced to Flint's beautiful young ward, Rayna Kapec, whose late parents, according to Flint, were employees of his. On Flint's suggestion, Kirk plays [[billiards]] with Rayna, and they dance to a [[waltz]] played on the piano by Spock, from a manuscript apparently in the hand of [[Johannes Brahms]], but written with contemporary ink. Shortly afterward, M4 returns with a container of ryetalyn, but it is contaminated with irilium, and therefore useless. Flint apologizes and accompanies M4 on a search for more ryetalyn.

Oddities begin to mount up. When Kirk kisses Rayna, M4 reacts as if he were attacking her. The ''Enterprise'' reports that no information can be found on Flint or Rayna. A tricorder scan reveals that Flint is over 6,000 years old. Finally, the processing of the new ryetalyn, supposedly being performed in Flint’s laboratory, is taking a suspiciously long time.

Rayna comes to say goodbye to Kirk, who has fallen in love with her and begs her to accompany him. McCoy tells them that the ryetalyn is missing, and Spock follows tricorder readings to a laboratory chamber containing android bodies, all labeled "Rayna".

Flint finally reveals the truth. He was born 3,834 years BCE, and after falling in battle discovered he could not die. Flint has lived "lifetimes" as [[Methuselah]], [[Alexander the Great]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and many others. Rayna is to be his mate, now that Kirk has taught her how to love. He intends also to keep the ''Enterprise'' crew in a suspended state, to protect his privacy, but relents on Rayna’s objection. A fight then breaks out between the two men for the possession of Rayna. Rayna stops them, claiming her right to choose her own future, and then, overwhelmed by her newfound emotions, dies.

Back on the ''Enterprise'', McCoy discovers that Flint, having left Earth’s environment, is now aging normally. Kirk falls asleep on his desk wishing to forget Rayna, and Spock places a suggestion to "forget" into his mind.

==Analysis==
According to fantasy and science fiction scholar Ace G. Pilkington, ''Requiem for Methuselah'' is a ''Star Trek'' adaptation of the film ''[[Forbidden Planet]]'' (1956).&lt;ref name="Pilkington"&gt;Pilkington (2015), p. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; Actress [[Anne Francis]] reported that [[Gene Roddenberry]], the creator of ''Star Trek'', had talked to her about lifting some ideas from ''Forbidden Planet''.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt; Actor [[Leslie Nielsen]] noted the similarities between ''Forbidden Planet'' and ''Star Trek'', suggesting that the film served as a [[Television pilot|pilot]] for the television series.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt;

''Forbidden Planet'' was the first big-budget [[science fiction film]] to be released by a [[major film studio]], in this case [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It differed from previous science fiction films in several ways.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt; The setting of the film was a future era, where mankind is "spreading out into the universe". Humans are using faster-than-light [[starship]]s in the film.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt; The film is set in part in [[outer space]], and in part on an alien planet.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt;  Human beings arrive on [[flying saucer]]s.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt; A notable character from the film is [[Robby the Robot]]. "He" is a [[robot]] programmed according to [[Three Laws of Robotics]], as defined by [[Isaac Asimov]].&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt;

In turn, ''Forbidden Planet'' itself was based on an earlier work, the theatrical play ''[[The Tempest]]'' (written c. 1610–1611) by [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt; ''The Tempest'' happened to be the favorite play of [[Irving Block]], one of the story writers of ''Forbidden Planet''. He had the idea to use the play as the basis of the film's action and characters.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt; Block co-wrote the main story of the film with [[Allen Adler]]. The [[screenplay]] was mainly written by novelist and screenwriter [[Cyril Hume]].&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt; Hume turned the film into a meditation on the nature of technology, on human ambition and human frailty, on the [[destiny]] of civilizations, on power and on fatherhood.&lt;ref name="Pilkington"/&gt;

Ruth Morse, a Shakespearean scholar, has written on the influence of ''The Tempest'' on ''Forbidden Planet'' and ''Requiem for Methuselah''.&lt;ref name="Morse"&gt;Morse (2000), pp. 164–171&lt;/ref&gt; Flint, the powerful recluse, seems to be based on [[Prospero]] and [[Methuselah]].&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt; Rayna appears to be Flint's daughter and is based on [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]], Prospero's daughter.&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt; The twist here is that "Rayna-Miranda" (as Morse calls her) is an android, not Flint's daughter. Flint hopes that the female android will fall in love with him. Flint offers her knowledge and intellectual stimulation but Rayna falls for the "irresistible" [[James T. Kirk]]. The female android faces new and (to her) unfamiliar emotions, having to choose between two men. The pressure causes her to short-circuit into self-destruction, her version of death.&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt;

Morse finds it is unusual for "the Miranda" in a ''Tempest'' adaptation to die but points that this version of Miranda is neither a true daughter to her Prospero, nor even human. She is a creation who came to life and was intended to be an immortal companion to Flint. She finds Rayna's story to be similar to that of [[Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]] from [[Greek mythology]]. Galatea was a female statue who came to life and mated with her creator [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]].&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt; Morse finds the depiction of the relationship between Flint and Rayna surprisingly innocent. Flint is Rayna's creator/father and her intended mate but there is not a hint of [[incest]] or [[sexual abuse]] in this pairing.&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt;

An original point of the episode is the motivation of Flint. He is [[Immortality in fiction|immortal]] and apparently unable to die. He has outlived his human attachments and it is hinted he has repeatedly outlived them in his long life. He wants a female android to be his mate, because he hopes that Rayna would also be practically immortal. His previous loves were apparently mortal women, whom he has lost to the ravages of time. He suffers from the pain of loss.&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt; Flint wants to awaken emotion in his creation but Morse observes that Flint has apparently lost his own ability to feel strong emotions.&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt;

Morse observes that this is not the only ''Star Trek'' episode which refers to Shakespeare and his works. ''[[The Conscience of the King]]'' makes references to ''[[Hamlet]]'' and ''[[Catspaw (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Catspaw]]'' makes references to ''[[Macbeth]]''.&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt; Morse finds that the romance story of the episode has some similarities with a much earlier ''Tempest'' adaptation, ''[[The Tempest (Dryden and D'Avenant play)|The Tempest]]'' (1667) by [[William Davenant]] and [[John Dryden]]. She finds it likely that the ''Star Trek'' writing team was unfamiliar with this version but they apparently came up with similar ideas.&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt;

There is an allusion to a different work in ''Requiem for Methuselah''. There is a locked door in Flint's laboratory and behind it are the bodies of women, duplicates of Rayna. This alludes to [[Bluebeard]], who kept a locked underground chamber in his castle. The chamber contained the bodies of women, the murdered corpses of his former wives.&lt;ref name="Morse"/&gt;

==40th anniversary remastering==
This episode was remastered in 2006 and aired June 21, 2008 as part of the remastered ''Original Series''. It was preceded a week earlier by the remastered "[[The Way to Eden]]" and followed a week later by the remastered "[[The Savage Curtain]]".  Changes made specific to this episode include:
* Flint's home is now a large palatial home, complete with observation tower.  Originally, Flint's home was represented by a reuse of the matte painting of Rigel VII from "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]".
* Planet Holberg 917-G is now more realistic, with two moons orbiting behind it.
* The effect of the ''Enterprise'' being miniaturized from space is remastered.

==In other media==
* The Crew meet up again with the character Flint in the ''Star Trek'' book ''The Cry of the Onlies'' by Judy Klass, which is a follow-on from both "Requiem for Methuselah" and "Miri". He is also encountered in [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s non-canonical novels ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'', as Dr. Evergreen, a 1980s scientist who discovers a hole in the [[ozone layer]] over [[Antarctica]], in ''[[Immortal Coil]]'' by [[Jeffrey Lang]], and in ''Federation'' ([[Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens]]) as [[Zefram Cochrane|Zefram Cochrane's]] benefactor Micah Brack.
* The author of the ''Star Trek'' screenplay, [[Jerome Bixby]], would write a film script at the end of his life which has many plot elements of this previous story, including an ageless man who is 14,000 years old, and has been a student of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], while he himself was the basis for the story of [[Jesus]]. This film, ''[[The Man from Earth]]'', was released in 2007.
* In the crossover comic ''Star Trek/[[Legion of Super-Heroes]]'', the crew of the ''Enterprise'' joins forces with the Legion of Super-Heroes to investigate an alternative timeline where Earth has become a galaxy-conquering empire, learning that the villain is immortal [[Vandal Savage]], who turns out to be an alternative version of Flint, Flint being a Vandal Savage who turned his back on violence and conquest.

'''Russell Earl Cochran''' (born October 31, 1958) is an American [[professional golfer]] who plays on the [[PGA Tour Champions]], having previously been a member on the [[PGA Tour]] and the [[Nationwide Tour]]. He is one of the few natural left-handed players to win a PGA Tour event. For much of the 1980s through 1992, he was the only left-hander on the PGA Tour.

Cochran was born, raised and has lived most of his life in [[Paducah, Kentucky]]. He grew up playing on Paxton Park Public Golf Course in Paducah, as did fellow PGA Tour player [[Kenny Perry]], who came along a couple years later. After graduating from [[St. Mary High School (Paducah, Kentucky)|St. Mary High School]] in Paducah, he attended the [[University of Kentucky]] and was a member of the [[golf]] team. He turned pro in 1979 and joined the PGA Tour in 1982.

Cochran has about 60 top-10 finishes in official PGA Tour events including a victory at the 1991 [[Centel Western Open]] when he made up seven shots over eight holes to beat [[Greg Norman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kLUyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wBIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4856,1826711&amp;dq=russ+cochran+greg+norman&amp;hl=en Cochran wins Western Open]&lt;/ref&gt;  His career year was 1991, when in addition to his win at the Western Open, he had two second-place finishes—including a playoff loss to [[Craig Stadler]] at the [[Tour Championship]] – and a third and finished 10th on the money list. His best finish in a [[Men's major golf championships|major]] was a tie for seventh at the [[1992 PGA Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Golf Major Championships|url=http://golfmajorchampionships.com/players?player=700|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cochran set the [[Valhalla Golf Club]] course record (65) in the third round of the [[1996 PGA Championship]] which stood until broken (63) in the same tournament four years later by [[José María Olazábal]]. He played some on the Nationwide Tour in his mid-to-late 40s in preparation for the Champions Tour. His best Nationwide finish was a tie for third at the 2003 [[Chitimacha Louisiana Open]].

Cochran debuted on the Champions Tour with a tie for seventh at the [[Allianz Championship]] on February 15, 2009, at [[Boca Raton, Florida]]. He finished third at the [[U.S. Senior Open]] on August 2, 2009, at [[Carmel, Indiana]], setting the [[Crooked Stick Golf Club]] course record with a third-round score of 8-under par 64. He ended the year by winning the [[Champions Tour awards#Player-elected awards|Rookie of the Year]] award. In 2010, he earned his first victory on the Champions Tour, defeating [[Fred Funk]] on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff in the [[Posco E&amp;C Songdo Championship]] in [[South Korea]], and followed that up with another win in the tour's next event, the [[SAS Championship]] in [[North Carolina]].

Cochran won his maiden senior major championship at the [[Senior British Open Championship|2011 Senior British Open Championship]] at Walton Heath. Cochran finished two strokes ahead of the third round leader [[Mark Calcavecchia]]. He shot a final round 67 which included six birdies in the first ten holes to open up a five stroke advantage. Despite a late charge by Calcavecchia, Cochran parred the last four holes and held on for a two stroke victory. Afterwards Cochran claimed having his son on the bag was a factor in his success. "It feels great, I had my son (Reed) on the bag, I told him I was going to work hard and come away with something good and I think he was the lucky charm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,12176_7060130,00.html|date=2011-07-24|title=Cochran wins Senior British Open Championship|accessdate=2011-07-25|work=Sky Sports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Cochran won for the fourth time on the [[Champions Tour]] at the [[Principal Charity Classic]]. He came from two shots back with a final round 67 to finish a single stroke ahead of [[Jay Don Blake]]. This ended a two-year title drought that Cochran had spent battling rib and wrist injuries. In October 2013, he won his second title of the year at the [[SAS Championship]], where he finished with four consecutive birdies to beat [[David Frost (golfer)|David Frost]] by a single stroke.

Cochran and his wife, Jackie, have four children: three sons and a daughter. His oldest son, Ryan, played golf at the [[University of Florida]] and aspires to play professionally like his father. Russ's son Case and nephew Rick III are also professional golfers.

'''Samuel Cromwell''' (died December 1, 1842) was a [[sailor]] and [[petty officer]] (boatswain's mate) aboard the [[brig]] [[USS Somers (1842)|USS ''Somers'']]. Cromwell was feared by the young apprentices who made up the majority of the ship's crew, and was rumored to have served on a [[Slave ship|slaver]] at one time. These rumors lent credence to the idea that he would have been amenable to [[Philip Spencer]]'s alleged plot to [[mutiny]], kill the ship's officers and such of the crew as were not wanted and sail the ''Somers'' either as a [[pirate]] ship or a slaver.  

On the homeward leg of a voyage to [[Liberia]], Cromwell was put in irons a few days after Spencer and [[Elisha Small]], another sailor rumored to have been part of a [[slave ship]]'s crew. After a meeting of the officers concluded that a mutinous plot existed, all three men were hanged without a [[court-martial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/wars/somers-1.htm "Somers" Deck Log 26 Nov 01 Dec 1842], www.history.navy.mil, 27 April 2001, (accessed February 3, 2007.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="837">A '''Special administrator''' is a court-appointed person who administrates a court-defined part of an [[Estate (law)|estate]] during [[probate]]. A special administrator with expertise in [[automobile]]s, for example, would administrate the probate of the deceased's car collection. A special administrator can also oversee an entire estate, albeit for a limited time (in case of emergency). In this case, the special administrator's job is to maintain the estate, not take control of the probate.

==Methods for sourcing individuals==
There are a variety of approaches to species reintroduction. The optimal strategy will depend on the biology of the organism.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Guidelines for Restorations and Other Conservation Translocations|url=http://www.iucn-whsg.org/sites/default/files/IUCN%20Guidelines%20to%20Reintroduction%20and%20Other%20Conservation%20Translocations.pdf|website=IUCN|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first matter to address when beginning a species reintroduction is whether to source individuals ''in situ'', from wild populations, or ''ex situ'', from captivity in a zoo or botanic garden, for example.

===''In situ'' sourcing===
''[[In situ]]'' sourcing for restorations involves moving individuals from an existing wild population to a new site where the species was formerly extirpated. Ideally, populations should be sourced ''in situ'' when possible due to the numerous risks associated with reintroducing organisms from captive populations to the wild.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Ex Situ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Mike|last2=Byers|first2=Onnie|title=The IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation: reflecting major changes in the application of ex situ conservation|journal=Oryx|date=January 2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=95–98|doi=10.1017/S0030605305000177|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/iucn-technical-guidelines-on-the-management-of-ex-situ-populations-for-conservation-reflecting-major-changes-in-the-application-of-ex-situ-conservation/33B02176D7D59AE939185EAFDC42915A|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To ensure that reintroduced populations have the best chance of surviving and reproducing, individuals should be sourced from populations that genetically and ecologically resemble the recipient population.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Generally, sourcing from populations with similar environmental conditions to the reintroduction site will maximize the chance that reintroduced individuals are well adapted to the habitat of the reintroduction site .&lt;ref name="Houde et al 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Houde|first1=Aimee|last2=Garner|first2=Shawn|last3=Neff|first3=Bryan|title=Restoring species through reintroductions: strategies for source population selection|journal=Restoration Ecology|date=2015|volume=23|issue=6|pages=746–753|doi=10.1111/rec.12280|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montalvo|first=Arlee M.|last2=Ellstrand|first2=Norman C.|date=2000-08-15|title=Transplantation of the Subshrub Lotus scoparius: Testing the Home-Site Advantage Hypothesis|url=https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99250.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=14|issue=4|pages=1034–1045|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.2000.99250.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One consideration for ''in situ'' sourcing is at which life stage the organisms should be collected, transported, and reintroduced. For instance, with plants, it is often ideal to transport them as seeds as they have the best chance of surviving translocation at this stage. However, some plants are difficult to establish as seed and may need to be translocated as juveniles or adults.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Guidelines"&gt;{{cite web|title=IUCN Guidelines for Restorations and Other Conservation Translocations|url=http://www.iucn-whsg.org/sites/default/files/IUCN%20Guidelines%20to%20Reintroduction%20and%20Other%20Conservation%20Translocations.pdf|website=IUCN|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ex situ'' sourcing===
In situations where ''in situ'' collection of individuals is not feasible, such as for rare and endangered species with too few individuals existing in the wild, [[Ex situ conservation|''ex situ'']] collection possible. 
''Ex situ'' collection methods allow storage of individuals that have high potential for reintroduction. Storage examples include [[germplasm]] stored in seed banks, sperm and egg banks, [[cryopreservation]], and tissue culture.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Ex Situ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Mike|last2=Byers|first2=Onnie|title=The IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation: reflecting major changes in the application of ex situ conservation|journal=Oryx|date=January 2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=95–98|doi=10.1017/S0030605305000177|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/iucn-technical-guidelines-on-the-management-of-ex-situ-populations-for-conservation-reflecting-major-changes-in-the-application-of-ex-situ-conservation/33B02176D7D59AE939185EAFDC42915A|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods that allow for storage of a high numbers of individuals also aim to maximize genetic diversity. Stored materials generally have long lifespans in storage, but some species do lose viability when stored as seed.&lt;ref name="Walters 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walters|first1=Christina|last2=Wheeler|first2=Lana|last3=Grotenhuis|first3=Judith|title=Longevity of seeds stored in a genebank: species characteristics|journal=Seed Science Research|date=2005|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–20|accessdate=|doi=10.1079/ssr2004195}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissue culture and cryopreservation techniques have only been perfected for a few species.&lt;ref name="Engelmann 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Engelmann|first1=Florent|title=Use of biotechnologies for the conservation of plant biodiversity|journal=In Vitro Cellular &amp; Developmental Biology-Plant|date=2011|volume=47|issue=1|pages=5–16|accessdate=|doi=10.1007/s11627-010-9327-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Organisms may also be kept in living collections in captivity. Living collections are more costly than storing [[germplasm]] and hence can support only a fraction of the individuals that ''ex situ'' sourcing can.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Ex Situ"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Mike|last2=Byers|first2=Onnie|title=The IUCN Technical Guidelines on the Management of Ex Situ Populations for Conservation: reflecting major changes in the application of ex situ conservation|journal=Oryx|date=January 2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=95–98|doi=10.1017/S0030605305000177|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/oryx/article/iucn-technical-guidelines-on-the-management-of-ex-situ-populations-for-conservation-reflecting-major-changes-in-the-application-of-ex-situ-conservation/33B02176D7D59AE939185EAFDC42915A|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk increases when sourcing individuals to add to living collections.

Adaptation to captivity may make individuals less suitable for reintroduction to the wild.

==Successes and failures==
Reintroduction biology is a relatively young discipline and continues to be a work in progress.  No strict and accepted definition of reintroduction success exists, but it has been proposed that the criteria widely used to assess the conservation status of endangered taxa, such as the [[IUCN Red List]] criteria, should be used to assess reintroduction success.&lt;ref name="Robert 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robert | first1 = A. | last2 = Colas | first2 = B.  | last3 = Guigon | first3 = I. | last4 = Kerbiriou | first4 = C.  | last5 = Mihoub | first5 = J.B. | last6 = Saint-Jalme | first6 = M.  | last7 = Sarrazin | first7 = F. |year = 2015 | title = Defining reintroduction success using IUCN criteria for threatened species: a demographic assessment | url = | journal = Animal Conservation | volume = 18 | issue = 5| pages = 397–406| doi = 10.1111/acv.12188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Successful reintroduction programs should yield viable and self-sustainable populations in the long-term.

A similar assessment focused solely on plants found high rates of success for rare species reintroductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Albrecht|first=Matthew A.|last2=Guerrant Jr.|first2=Edward O.|last3=Maschinski|first3=Joyce|last4=Kennedy|first4=Kathryn L.|date=2011-11-01|title=A long-term view of rare plant reintroduction|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320711002849|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=144|issue=11|pages=2557–2558|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2011.07.021}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of data from the Center for Plant Conservation International Reintroduction Registry found that, for the 49 cases where data were available, 92% of the reintroduced plant populations survived two years.

Many factors can attribute to the success or failure of a reintroduction.  Predators, food, pathogens, competitors, and weather can all affect a reintroduced population's ability to grow, survive, and reproduce.The number of animals reintroduced in an attempt should also vary with factors such as social behavior, expected rates of predation, and density in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wimberger|first=Kirsten|last2=Downs|first2=Colleen T.|last3=Perrin|first3=Mike R.|date=2009-10-01|title=Two Unsuccessful Reintroduction Attempts of Rock Hyraxes (Procavia capensis) into a Reserve in the KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3957/056.039.0213|journal=South African Journal of Wildlife Research|volume=39|issue=2|pages=192–201|doi=10.3957/056.039.0213|issn=0379-4369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animals raised in captivity may experience stress during captivity or translocation, which can weaken their immune systems.&lt;ref name="Stamps 2007" /&gt;

Unfortunately, the monitoring period that should follow reintroductions often remains neglected.&lt;ref&gt;Sarrazin, F. Barbault, R. (November 1996).

== Genetic considerations ==
When a species has been extirpated from a site where it previously existed, individuals that will comprise the reintroduced population must be sourced from wild or captive populations. When sourcing individuals for reintroduction, it is important to consider [[local adaptation]], adaptation to captivity (for [[ex situ conservation|''ex situ'' conservation]]), the possibility of [[inbreeding depression]] and [[outbreeding depression]], and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[ecology]], and [[genetic diversity]] of the source population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Reintroduced populations experience increased vulnerability to influences of [[Genetic drift|drift]], [[Natural selection|selection]], and [[gene flow]] evolutionary processes due to their small sizes, climatic and ecological differences between source and native habitats, and presence of other mating-compatible populations.&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Latch|first=Emily K.|last2=Rhodes|first2=Olin E.|date=2006-01-21|title=The effects of gene flow and population isolation on the genetic structure of␣reintroduced wild turkey populations: Are genetic signatures of source populations retained?|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10592-005-9089-2|journal=Conservation Genetics|language=en|volume=6|issue=6|pages=981–997|doi=10.1007/s10592-005-9089-2|issn=1566-0621}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sork|first=Victoria L.|date=2015-11-03|title=Gene flow and natural selection shape spatial patterns of genes in tree populations: implications for evolutionary processes and applications |journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=291–310|doi=10.1111/eva.12316 |pmc=4780383|pmid=27087853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the species slated for reintroduction is rare in the wild, it is likely to have unusually low population numbers, and care should be taken to avoid [[inbreeding]] and [[inbreeding depression]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inbreeding can change the frequency of allele distribution in a population, and potentially result in a change to crucial genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additionally, [[outbreeding depression]] can occur if a reintroduced population can hybridize with existing populations in the wild, which can result in offspring with reduced fitness, and less adaptation to local conditions. To minimize both, practitioners should source for individuals in a way that captures as much genetic diversity as possible, and attempt to match source site conditions to local site conditions as much as possible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Capturing as much [[genetic diversity]] as possible, measured as [[heterozygosity]], is  suggested in species reintroductions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some protocols suggest sourcing approximately 30 individuals from a population will capture 95% of the genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Maintaining genetic diversity in the recipient population is crucial to avoiding the loss of essential local adaptations, minimizing inbreeding depression, and maximizing fitness of the reintroduced population.

=== Ecological Similarity ===
Plants or animals that undergo reintroduction may exhibit reduced fitness if they are not sufficiently adapted to local environmental conditions. Therefore, researchers should consider ecological and environmental similarity of source and recipient sites when selecting populations for reintroduction. Environmental factors to consider include climate and soil traits (pH, percent clay, silt and sand, percent combustion carbon, percent combustion nitrogen, concentration of Ca, Na, Mg, P, K).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Historically, sourcing plant material for reintroductions has followed the rule "local is best," as the best way to preserve local adaptations, with individuals for reintroductions selected from the most geographically proximate population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Havens|first=Kayri|last2=Vitt|first2=Pati|last3=Still|first3=Shannon|last4=Kramer|first4=Andrea T.|last5=Fant|first5=Jeremie B.|last6=Schatz|first6=Katherine|date=2015-01-01|title=Seed Sourcing for Restoration in an Era of Climate Change|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3375/043.035.0116|journal=Natural Areas Journal|volume=35|issue=1|pages=122–133|doi=10.3375/043.035.0116|issn=0885-8608}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, geographic distance was shown in a [[common garden experiment]] to be an insufficient predictor of fitness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Additionally, projected climatic shifts induced by [[climate change]] have led to the development of new seed sourcing protocols that aim to source seeds that are best adapted to project climate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breed|first=Martin F.|last2=Stead|first2=Michael G.|last3=Ottewell|first3=Kym M.|last4=Gardner|first4=Michael G.|last5=Lowe|first5=Andrew J.|date=2013-02-01|title=Which provenance and where?

A study of the reintroduction of ''[[Castilleja levisecta]]'' found that the source populations most physically near the reintroduction site performed the poorest in a field experiment, while those from the source population whose ecological conditions most closely matched the reintroduction site performed best, demonstrating the importance of matching the evolved adaptations of a population to the conditions at the reintroduction site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=Beth|last2=Kaye|first2=Thomas|date=2011|title=Reintroduction of Castilleja levisecta: Effects of Ecological Similarity, Source Population Genetics, and Habitat Quality|url=|journal=Restoration Ecology|volume=19|pages=166–176|doi=10.1111/j.1526-100x.2009.00549.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Adaptation to Captivity ===
Some reintroduction programs use plants or animals from captive populations to form a reintroduced population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; When reintroducing individuals from a captive population to the wild, there is a risk that they have adapted to captivity due to differential selection of genotypes in captivity versus the wild. 
The genetic basis of this adaptation is selection of rare, [[Dominance (genetics)|recessive]] [[allele]]s that are deleterious in the wild but preferred in captivity.&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt; Consequently, animals adapted to captivity show reduced stress tolerance, increased tameness, and loss of local adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankham|first=Richard|date=2008|title=Genetic adaptation to captivity in species conservation programs|url=|journal=Molecular Ecology|volume=17|pages=325–333|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294x.2007.03399.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants also can show adaptations to captivity through changes in drought tolerance, nutrient requirements, and seed dormancy requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ensslin|first=Andreas|last2=Tschöpe|first2=Okka|last3=Burkart|first3=Michael|last4=Joshi|first4=Jasmin|date=2015-12-01|title=Fitness decline and adaptation to novel environments in ex situ plant collections: Current knowledge and future perspectives|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320715301373|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=192|pages=394–401|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2015.10.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extent of adaptation is directly related to intensity of selection, genetic diversity, [[effective population size]] and number of generations in captivity. 
Characteristics selected for in captivity are overwhelmingly disadvantageous in the wild, so such adaptations can lead to reduced fitness following reintroduction. 
Reintroduction projects that introduce wild animals generally experience higher success rates than those that use captive-bred animals.&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt; Genetic adaptation to captivity can be minimized through management methods: by maximizing generation length and number of new individuals added to the captive population; minimizing effective population size, number of generations spent in captivity, and [[Natural selection|selection]] pressure; and reducing genetic diversity by [[Fragmentation (reproduction)|fragmenting]] the population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt; For plants, minimizing adaptation to captivity is usually achieved by sourcing plant material from a [[seed bank]], where individuals are preserved as wild-collected seeds, and have not had the chance to adapt to conditions in captivity. However, this method is only plausible for plants with [[seed dormancy]].&lt;ref name="Frankham 2008" /&gt;

=== Genetic Trade-offs ===
In reintroductions from captivity, translocation of animals from captivity to the wild has implications for both captive and wild populations. Reintroduction of genetically valuable animals from captivity  improves genetic diversity of reintroduced populations while depleting captive populations; conversely, genetically valuable captive-bred animals may be closely related to individuals in the wild and thus increase risk of inbreeding depression if reintroduced. 
Increasing genetic diversity is favored with removal of genetically overrepresented individuals from captive populations and addition of animals with low genetic relatedness to the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Earnhardt|first=Joanne M.|date=November 1999|title=Reintroduction programmes: genetic trade-offs for populations|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1795.1999.tb00074.x|journal=Animal Conservation|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=279–286|doi=10.1111/j.1469-1795.1999.tb00074.x|issn=1367-9430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/774393970|title=Introduction to conservation genetics|last=1942-|first=Frankham, Richard,|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Ballou, J.

== Improving research techniques ==
A cooperative approach to reintroduction by ecologists and biologists could improve research techniques. For both preparation and monitoring of reintroductions,  increasing contacts between academic population biologists and wildlife managers is encouraged within the Survival Species Commission and the IUCN.  The IUCN states that a re-introduction requires a multidisciplinary approach involving a team of persons drawn from a variety of backgrounds.&lt;ref name="SSC Re-introduction Specialist Group 1995"/&gt; A survey by Wolf et al. in 1998 indicated that 64% of reintroduction projects have used subjective opinion to assess habitat quality.&lt;ref name="Stamps 2007"/&gt;  This means that most reintroduction evaluation has been based on human anecdotal evidence and not enough has been based on statistical findings. Seddon et al. (2007) suggest that researchers contemplating future reintroductions should specify goals, overall ecological purpose, and inherent technical and biological limitations of a given reintroduction, and planning and evaluation processes should incorporate both experimental and modeling approaches.&lt;ref name="Seddon 2007" /&gt;

Monitoring the health of individuals, as well as the survival, is important; both before and after the reintroduction. Intervention may be necessary if the situation proves unfavorable.&lt;ref name="SSC Re-introduction Specialist Group 1995"/&gt;  Population dynamics models that integrate demographic parameters and behavioral data recorded in the field can lead to simulations and tests of a priori hypotheses. Using previous results to design further decisions and experiments is a central concept of [[adaptive management]]. In other words, learning by doing can help in future projects. Population ecologists should therefore collaborate with biologists, ecologists, and wildlife management to improve reintroduction programs.&lt;ref name="bgci.org"&gt;BGCI: The global network.

=== Genetic monitoring ===
For reintroduced populations to successfully establish and maximize reproductive fitness, practitioners should perform genetic tests to select which individuals will be the founders of reintroduced populations and to continue monitoring populations post-reintroduction.&lt;ref name="IUCN 2017 Guidelines" /&gt; A number of methods are available to measure the genetic relatedness between and variation among individuals within populations. Common genetic diversity assessment tools include [[microsatellite]] markers, [[mitochondrial DNA]] analyses, [[alloenzyme]]s, and [[amplified fragment length polymorphism]] markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SCHWARTZ|first=M|last2=LUIKART|first2=G|last3=WAPLES|first3=R|date=2007|title=Genetic monitoring as a promising tool for conservation and management|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534706002722|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=22|issue=1|pages=25–33|doi=10.1016/j.tree.2006.08.009|issn=0169-5347|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Post-reintroduction, genetic monitoring tools can be used to obtain data such as population abundance, [[effective population size]], and [[Population stratification|population structure]], and can also be used to identify instances of [[inbreeding]] within reintroduced populations or [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] with existing populations that are genetically compatible. Long-term genetic monitoring is recommended post-reintroduction to track changes in genetic diversity of the reintroduced population and determine success of a reintroduction program. 
Adverse genetic changes such as loss of [[heterozygosity]] may indicate management intervention, such as population supplementation, is necessary for survival of the reintroduced population.&lt;ref name="Haye 877–892"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haye|first=M.

==Re-introduction Specialist Group (RSG)==
The RSG is a network of specialists whose aim is to combat the ongoing and massive [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] by using re-introductions as a responsible tool for the management and restoration of biodiversity. It does this by actively developing and promoting sound inter-disciplinary scientific information, policy, and practice to establish viable wild populations in their natural habitats.
The role of the RSG is to promote the re-establishment of viable populations in the wild of animals and plants. The need for this role was felt due to the increased demand from re-introduction practitioners, the global conservation community and increase in re-introduction projects worldwide.

Increasing numbers of animal and plant species are becoming rare, or even extinct in the wild. In an attempt to re-establish populations, species can – in some instances – be re-introduced into an area, either through translocation from existing wild populations, or by re-introducing captive-bred animals or artificially propagated plants.

Suicide bags were first used during the 1990s.  The method was mainly developed in North America.

==History==
{{Main|History of suicide}}
Self-administered and assisted suicides by asphyxiation using a plastic bag with helium were first recorded in the 1990s. Since the 2000s, guides have spread on the internet, in print and on video and the frequency of suicides by this method has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|vauthors=Malbranque S, Mauillon D, Turcant A, Rouge-Maillart C, Mangin P, Varlet V |date=25 Apr 2016|title=Quantification of fatal helium exposure following self-administration|journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine|volume=130|issue=6|pages=1535–1539|doi=10.1007/s00414-016-1364-x|pmid=27113477}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid20216304&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Ogden | first1 = RD. | title = Observation of two suicides by helium inhalation in a prefilled environment | journal = Am J Forensic Med Pathol | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 156–61 |date=June 2010 | doi = 10.1097/PAF.0b013e3181d749d7 | pmid = 20216304 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The suicide bag with inert gas method was originally developed by [[John Hofsess]] and the NuTech group, which consisted of Hofsess, [[Derek Humphry]], engineers and physicians.&lt;ref name="hofsess"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hofsess |first=John |url=http://torontolife.com/city/life/john-hofsess-assisted-suicide/ |title=By the time you read this, I’ll be dead |work=[[Toronto Life]] |date=2016-03-04 |accessdate=2016-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''[[Final Exit]]'' by [[Derek Humphry]], a suicide bag was described as a large plastic bag with an adjustable velcro strip around the neck.&lt;ref name=Humphry1991&gt;{{Cite book|last=Humphry|first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Humphry|year=1992|title=Final Exit: the Practicalities of Self-Deliverance and Assisted Suicide for the Dying|isbn=978-0-385-33653-6|publisher=Delta Trade Paperback|location = New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derek"&gt;{{cite book | title=Final Exit: the Practicalities of Self-Deliverance and Assisted Suicide for the Dying (3rd edition)| last=Humphry|first=Derek| year=2002| publisher=Delta Trade Paperback| location=New York| isbn=978-0-385-33653-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its use with inert gases was mentioned in the ''Supplement to Final Exit'' in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Supplement to Final Exit|first=Derek|last=Humphry|year=2000|publisher=Norris Lane Press and ERGO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pro-[[euthanasia]] group [[Exit International|Exit Australia]] distributed a manufactured version of the bag in Australia in 2002, alarming government officials&lt;!-- SMH: "Outrage over suicide bag giveaway." The Age: "While police said they were powerless to act against the bags, the Federal Government flagged the prospect of banning them, with Special Minister of State Eric Abetz warning that Dr Nitschke "must be stopped". --&gt; and pro-life groups.&lt;ref name="pn-bags"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bags" /&gt; The Australian chapter of Right to Life expressed concern that they would be used by vulnerable people.&lt;ref name="pn-bags"&gt;{{cite news |last=Roberts |first=Greg |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/08/20/1029114107399.html |title=Nitschke skirts law with suicide bag |work=[[The Age]] |date=2002-08-21 |accessdate=2016-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bags"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/07/09/1026185041388.html |title=Outrage over suicide bag giveaway | publisher=www.smh.com.au |accessdate=2008-12-19 | date=2002-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, ''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' cited Russel Ogden, Canadian criminologist and right-to-die advocate,&lt;ref name=cribb&gt;{{citation|first=Robert|last=Cribb|title=Death's midwife helps terminally ill Canadians end their lives|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|date=26 Dec 2012|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2012/10/21/deaths_midwife_helps_terminally_ill_canadians_end_their_lives.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; who said that the combination of a suicide bag and helium was "a method of choice" within the right-to-die movement for people who are [[terminally ill]] and that its promotion does not appear to cause an increase in the number of suicides. However, he said that he has no way of knowing if the method was being used by people with terminal illness or by people who are [[mentally ill]].&lt;ref name=canada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=ce4139ae-d635-4030-ac92-a7b7d6fab09d|title=Helium in an "exit bag" new choice for suicide|publisher=www.canada.com|accessdate=2008-12-19|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091109104416/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=ce4139ae-d635-4030-ac92-a7b7d6fab09d|archivedate=2009-11-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Ludwig Minelli]], founder of [[Dignitas (assisted dying organisation)|Dignitas]], filmed four people committing suicide by helium inhalation.&lt;ref name="pmid26007160" /&gt; Subsequent to this, the method "has been winning supporters both in the USA and in Europe as a reliable, rapid and painless way to die".&lt;ref name="pmid26007160" /&gt;

In 2009, [[Philip Nitschke]], founder of voluntary euthanasia organisation Exit International, wrote in a member newsletter that nitrogen has a lower risk of an adverse reaction by the body than helium and is also more available than helium in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="nitro-better"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exitinternational.net/deliverance/eDvol7no1.pdf |title=The Nitrogen Alternative |accessdate=2011-07-28 |publisher=Exit International |format=PDF |date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke's organisation sells suicide kits that contain nitrogen tanks and regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Steve|last=Rice|title=Philip Nitschke says Exit International has seen a surge in demand for help to die peacefully|newspaper=[[Herald Sun]]|date=16 Aug 2012|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/philip-nitschke-says-exit-international-has-seen-a-surge-in-demand-for-help-to-die-peacefully/story-fndo471r-1226452088699}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promotes the use of nitrogen and suicide bags with lectures and films, such as ''Doing it with Betty'' – in which an elderly woman describes how to make a plastic 'exit' bag,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/news/253927 |title=Dr Death attempts to dodge film law |work=stuff.co.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/health/article6229373.ece |title='Dr Death' Paul Nitschke reveals secrets of a peaceful exit |first=Simon |last=de Bruxelles |work=[[The Times]] [[TimesOnline]] |date= May 6, 2009 |publisher=[[News International]] |location=[[London, England|London]] |issn=0140-0460 |accessdate=25 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with published materials such as workshop handbooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatlakesadvocate.com.au/news/local/news/general/dr-death-ignites-right-to-die-debate/1358256.aspx?page=0 |title=Dr Death ignites right to die debate |work=Great Lakes Advocate |first=Tim |last=Connell |year=2011 |accessdate=24 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821234440/http://www.greatlakesadvocate.com.au/news/local/news/general/dr-death-ignites-right-to-die-debate/1358256.aspx?page=0 |archivedate=21 August 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitschke calls the suicide bag death a "[[hypoxic hypoxia|hypoxic]] death", and likens it to [[pneumonia]], the "old person's friend", where hypoxia occurs because pneumonic inflammation stops the lungs extracting sufficient oxygen from the air, and "a peaceful death often results".&lt;ref name="PDH"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nitschke |first1=Philip |authorlink=Philip Nitschke |last2=Stewart |first2=Fiona |authorlink2=Fiona Stewart (author) |title=The Peaceful Pill Handbook |chapter=Hypoxic Death and the Exit bag |publisher=Exit International US Limited |date=2016 |isbn=9780975833919 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 author and right-to-die advocate Derek Humphry reported that [[Worthington Industries]], the world's largest manufacturer of disposable helium cylinders, had announced that their helium cylinders will guarantee only 80% helium, with up to 20% air, making them inappropriate for use with a suicide bag in Humphry's opinion.&lt;ref name="oxy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assisted-dying.org/blog/2015/04/24/australian-warning-on-diluted-helium-tanks/ |title=Warning on diluted helium tanks |last=Humphry |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Humphry |work=Assisted Dying Blog |publisher=[[Derek Humphry]] |date=2015-04-24 |accessdate=2016-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch psychiatrist Boudewijn Chabot, in his 2015 book ''Dignified Dying'', calls the suicide bag with inert gas method "rapid, painless and safe".&lt;ref name="chabot"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chabot |first1=Boudewijn |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tOhHCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=suicide%20bag%20helium%20painless&amp;pg=PA64 |title=Dignified Dying |publisher=Lulu.com |date=2015 |page=63 |isbn=9789081619462 |accessdate=2016-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
{{Main|Legality of euthanasia}}
It is not illegal to own a suicide bag in any jurisdiction.

Selling suicide bags is prohibited in some places.  In 2011, the FBI raided a small mail-order business in California, which shut down afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-suicide-solution-20110531,0,4279484.story |title=Suicide kits: Woman selling 'suicide kits' reignites right-to-die debate|first=Richard |last=Marosi |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=May 30, 2011 |publisher=[[Tribune Co]] |location=[[Los Angeles, CA|Los Angeles]] |issn=0458-3035 |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_suicide_kits_raid Federal agents raid California suicide kit seller] Yahoo News.&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, this raid caused [[Oregon]] to be the first US state to pass legislation prohibiting the sale of kits containing suicide bags or hoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lifenews.com/2011/07/01/oregon-governor-signs-bill-banning-sale-of-suicide-kits/ |title=Oregon Governor Signs Bill Banning Sale of Suicide Kits |first=Steven |last=Ertelt |work=lifenews.com |year=2011 |accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian right-to-die advocates stopped shipping suicide bags to Australia in 2001, when the Australian government announced that it would review their importation.&lt;ref name="bags" /&gt;  In 2002, the Queensland Police in Australia said that suicide bags did not violate any laws at that time, and the Australian federal government said it would look into banning them.&lt;ref name="pn-bags" /&gt;  Exit Australia gave them away to members upon request; they put warning labels on them, called them "exit bags", and included no instructions for use to circumvent Australian laws against assisting suicide.&lt;ref name="pn-bags" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bags" /&gt;

==Physiological mechanism==
A hypoxic, carbon dioxide free metabolically inert gas is provided for inhalation by confining the gas supply and the head in an impermeable bag which prevents contamination with oxygen from the surrounding air, minimising the amount of gas required.&lt;ref name=PDH /&gt; (The same effect could be reached by flooding any enclosed space with the gas, but much more gas would be needed, and this would be hazardous to a third party entering the space, an effect which is well known as a cause of industrial fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boconline.co.uk/en/health-and-safety/gas-safety/gas-risks/inert-gas-risks/index.html|title=Inert Gas Risks - Oxygen Deficiency|accessdate=5 March 2018 |publisher=BOC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/welding/confined-spaces.htm |title=Lack of oxygen in confined spaces |accessdate=5 March 2018 |publisher=Health and Safety Executive }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Inhalation of oxygen deficient or oxygen free gas not only fails to replenish oxygen used in normal metabolism, but causes the blood passing through the capillaries of the gas exchange regions of the lungs to lose residual oxygen in relation to the concentration difference between the oxygen in the alveolar air and in the blood in the alveolar capillaries. This causes a far quicker drop in blood oxygen level than holding the breath. The deoxygenated blood then passes through the systemic circulation to the vital organs, including the brain, and rapidly lowers oxygen concentrations below the level required to sustain consciousness, and when it is insufficient to keep the heart functioning, cardiac arrest will occur.&lt;ref name=PDH /&gt;&lt;ref name="Asphyxiation hazards" &gt;{{cite web|title=Asphyxiation hazards in welding and allied processes |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/eis45.pdf |publisher=Health and Safety Executive |accessdate=5 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the most people, an alveolar oxygen tension of less than {{convert|30|mmHg|mbar}} or 4% by volume at atmospheric pressure is not sufficient to support consciousness.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul W. Fisher |title=USAF Flight Surgeon's Guide |publisher=USAF School of Aerospace Medicine |url=http://wwwsam.brooks.af.mil/af/files/fsguide/HTML/Chapter_02.html |accessdate=5 March 2015 |archivedate=16 March 2007 |chapter=2 - High Altitude Respiratory Physiology |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070316011544/http://wwwsam.brooks.af.mil/af/files/fsguide/HTML/Chapter_02.html |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The urge to breathe in normal humans is mainly controlled by blood carbon dioxide concentration and the acidity that it causes. A rise in carbon dioxide concentration caused by the inability to inhale fresh gas will cause a strong reflex to breathe, accompanied by increasing distress as the level rises, culminating in panic and desperate struggle for air. This effect will remain if the person is free to breathe but the available air has a high carbon dioxide content. If the supplied breathing gas is free of carbon dioxide, the blood carbon dioxide levels will remain low while breathing occurs, and there will be no distress or urge to increase breathing rate, as the sensitivity in normal people to blood oxygen level as a breathing stimulus is very low.&lt;ref name=PDH /&gt;&lt;ref name="Asphyxiation hazards" /&gt; 

&lt;!--This is not always the case for sufferers of [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] with chronic hypercapnia, who lose some of the sensitivity to blood carbon dioxide concentration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web}url=https://lungfoundation.com.au/carbon-dioxide-retention-in-patients-with-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/ |first=Claude |last=Farah |title=Carbon Dioxide Retention in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease |date=8 October 2015 |publisher=Lung Foundation Australia |accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and apparently become more sensitive to blood oxygen levels. These people may develop an urge to breathe in a low oxygen environment even when carbon dioxide is removed at rates to which they have become accustomed.--&gt;
The effect of contamination of the inert gas by air or other source of oxygen is to reduce the effects of oxygen loss and the person exposed may feel weak, tired and confused, but without a strong urge to breathe or the associated respiratory distress.&lt;ref name=PDH /&gt;&lt;ref name="Asphyxiation hazards" /&gt; The efficiency of the system for euthanasia requires minimising contamination by oxygen and carbon dioxide. Small amounts of oxygen will not affect the end result, but may extend the time taken.&lt;ref name=PDH /&gt;

==Short term physiological effects and hazards of the gases used==
Helium and nitrogen are non toxic and can be breathed with no ill effects over short or long term when oxygen levels are sufficient, and present no health risk to third parties except asphyxiation. The danger lies in that they are undetectable by human senses, and the first warning of their presence in asphyxiant concentrations may be loss of consciousness. Lower concentrations may cause confusion and weakness. Use of a suicide bag in a well ventilated room using either of these gases is unlikely to pose a hazard for other people, and there is no fire hazard.&lt;ref name="Asphyxiation hazards" /&gt; 

Propane, butane and natural gas are to varying degrees narcotic, and are a serious fire and explosion hazard, depending on concentration of the gas and of oxygen.&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt; They are usually supplied with strong-smelling additives to provide a warning. These additives may be toxic in large doses, but the concentrations which are needed to indicate the presence of the gas are not dangerous over short terms. The unpleasant smell may be a deterrent to more widespread use as a euthanasia agent, but the primary purpose is a warning of fire hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, Division of Fire safety, Office of the State Fire Marshall |url=http://www.nj.gov/dca/divisions/dfs/alerts/safety_alerts/safety_alert_12-2_suicide_bags.pdf |title=Safety Alert: Suicide Bags |accessdate=5 March 2018 |date=August 2012 |location=Trenton, NJ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Propane has low toxicity since it is not readily absorbed and is not biologically active. It is heavier than air and may accumulate in low places, particularly if they are poorly ventilated.&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/74986.html|publisher=The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) |title=Propane |access-date = 2016-05-12 | quote = Propane is a simple asphyxiant and does not present an IDLH hazard at concentrations below its lower explosive limit (LEL).

The authors wrote,&lt;ref name="pmid11110181"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ely SF, Hirsch CS |title=Asphyxial deaths and petechiae: a review |journal=J.

However, we have not seen detailed descriptions of such observations that permit another person to evaluate the variables that might have produced an isolated petechia in a rare victim. Conversely, in New York City, an average of approximately 15 persons per year accomplish suicide by plastic bag, and we never have observed petechiae in a person who did not tightly fasten the bag around his/her neck|2=Ely SF, Hirsch CS|3="Asphyxial deaths and petechiae: a review".

There are also documented cases of suicide attempts using the suicide bag that failed.&lt;ref name="pmid20430818"/&gt; A case report study in 2015 discussed the risks associated with failed attempts using this method. The authors wrote, "If the process is interrupted by someone, there is no gas or the tube slips out of the bag, there is a high risk of severe [[Cerebral hypoxia|hypoxia of the central nervous system]]" (in survivors).&lt;ref name="pmid26007160"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smędra A, Szustowski S, Jurczyk AP, Klemm J, Szram S, Berent J |title=Suicidal asphyxiation by using helium - two case reports |journal=Arch Med Sadowej Kryminol |volume=65 |issue=1 |pages=37–46 |year=2015 |pmid=26007160 |doi= |url=http://www.termedia.pl/Czasopismo/-82/Artykul-25129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If hypoxia results in coma, the length of unconsciousness is often indicative of long-term damage. In some cases coma can give the brain an opportunity to heal and regenerate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn9474 | title = 'Rewired brain' revives patient after 19 years | last = Phillips | first = Helen | date = 2006-07-03 | accessdate = 2007-04-13 | publisher = [[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, in general, the longer a coma, the greater the likelihood that the person will remain in a vegetative state until death.&lt;ref name="NINDS"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/anoxia/anoxia.htm | title = Cerebral Hypoxia Information Page | author = [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] | date = 2007-02-08 | accessdate = 2007-04-13 | publisher = U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioethics==
Russel Ogden (2002) said that the existence of "how-to" literature involving the suicide bag has been "shown to influence the choice of suicide method but not the overall suicide rate, and that an emerging counterculture of death providers, operating outside of the traditional medicolegal framework of health care, was placing assisted death outside the normative gaze of medicine".&lt;ref name="pmid12198347" /&gt; In 2010, Ogden and colleagues observed four cases of assisted suicide with helium delivered by face mask. The authors stated that a hood method might be able to play a role in "demedicalising assisted suicide".&lt;ref name="pmid20211999"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Ogden | first1 = RD. | last2 = Hamilton | first2 = WK. | last3 = Whitcher | first3 = C. | title = Assisted suicide by oxygen deprivation with helium at a Swiss right-to-die organisation. | journal = J Med Ethics | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 174–9 |date=Mar 2010 | doi = 10.1136/jme.2009.032490 | pmid = 20211999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ogden views a bag and inert gas as "the quickest way to go; used properly, you're unconscious after the second breath and dead in about 10 minutes".&lt;ref name="SA-ogden"&gt;{{cite news |last=Martindale |first=Diane |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-culture-of-death/ |title=Culture of Death |work=[[Scientific American]] |date=2005-06-01 |accessdate=2016-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinical psychologist Phillip Kleespies said that Ogden's work calls attention to some of the risks associated with covert assisted suicide using unregulated methods like the suicide bag with inert gas. He does not dispute that the method is "swift, highly lethal and painless", as claimed by Ogden and other right-to-die proponents.&lt;ref name=canada /&gt; However Kleespies feels it is an undignified, impersonal and "hurried" manner of death, which may be used by people who have not had the opportunity for appropriate counseling and that this is largely a result of more dignified methods being made illegal. He concludes by expressing the hope that with improved and more appropriate care during the dying phase of life, there will be less perceived need for these methods of self-deliverance.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Kleespies |first=PM |year=2010 |title=Psychological and ethical considerations concerning the debreather and assisted suicide: a commentary on Ogden |journal=Death Studies |volume=34 |issue=4 |pages=318–24 |pmid=24479189 |doi=10.1080/07481181003613859}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study poses the dilemma for medical ethicists and the general public who "may also want to carefully weigh the unintended adverse consequences of widely disseminated suicide methods likely to appeal to some depressed persons (irrespective of their physical health status or age) against the putative benefits associated with making these methods more widely known and available".&lt;ref name="pmid21394956"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2011|title=Suicide by asphyxiation due to helium inhalation|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/78181/heliumsuicide.pdf|journal=Am J Forensic Med Pathol|volume=32|issue=1|pages=61–70|doi=10.1097/paf.0b013e3181ed7a2d|pmid=21394956|vauthors=Howard MO, Hall MT, Edwards JD, Vaughn MG, Perron BE, Winecker RE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of users==
Promoters of this suicide method recommend it to terminally ill patients.&lt;ref name="frost" /&gt;  However, across the world, most people who use suicide bags are physically healthy.&lt;ref name="frost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21394956" /&gt;  Instead of having incurable cancer or other life-threatening physical diseases, most of the users have psychiatric disorders or substance abuse problems that might possibly be addressed through medical and psychological treatment.&lt;ref name="frost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21394956" /&gt;  The demographics of its users varies; in one survey, the method had been used mostly by [[Middle age|middle-aged]] adults in failing health, who were attracted to the relative nonviolence of the method.&lt;ref name="pmid8947355" /&gt;

This suicide method is also typically used by younger or middle-aged adults, rather than by [[older adults]].&lt;ref name="frost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21394956" /&gt;  In the US, it is more commonly chosen by non-Hispanic white males than by women or people of other races.&lt;ref name="frost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21394956" /&gt;

'''Thalidomide''', sold under the brand name '''Immunoprin''', among others, is an [[immunotherapy|immunomodulatory drug]] and the prototype of the [[Discovery and development of thalidomide and its analogs|thalidomide class of drugs]]. Today, thalidomide is used mainly as a treatment of certain cancers ([[multiple myeloma]]) and of a complication of [[leprosy]].

&lt;!-- History --&gt;
Thalidomide was first marketed in 1957 in [[West Germany]] under the trade name '''Contergan'''. The German drug company [[Grünenthal|Chemie Grünenthal]] developed and sold the drug. Primarily prescribed as a [[sedative]] or [[hypnotic]], thalidomide also claimed to cure "[[anxiety]], [[insomnia]], [[gastritis]], and tension".&lt;ref name="miller"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Miller | first = Marylin T. | title = Thalidomide Embryopathy: A Model for the Study of Congenital Incomitant Horizontal Strabismus | journal = Transactions of the American Ophthalmological Society | year = 1991 | volume = 81 | pages = 623–674 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, it was used against [[nausea]] and to alleviate [[morning sickness]] in pregnant women. Thalidomide became an [[over the counter|over-the-counter]] drug in West Germany on October 1, 1957. Shortly after the drug was sold in West Germany, between 5,000 and 7,000 infants were born with [[phocomelia]] (malformation of the limbs). Only 40% of these children survived.&lt;ref name="oncozine.com"&gt;{{cite web | first = Peter | last = Hofland | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://oncozine.com/reversal-of-fortune-how-a-vilified-drug-became-a-life-saving-agent-in-the-war-against-cancer/ | title = Reversal of Fortune: How a Vilified Drug Became a Life-saving Agent in the "War" Against Cancer | work = Onco'Zine }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the world, about 10,000 cases were reported of infants with phocomelia due to thalidomide; only 50% of the 10,000 survived. Those subjected to thalidomide while in the womb experienced limb deficiencies in a way that the long limbs either were not developed or presented themselves as stumps. Other effects included deformed eyes and hearts, deformed alimentary and urinary tracts, blindness and deafness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Oxford Companion to the Body | last = Cuthbert | first = Alan | year = 2003 | publisher = Oxford University Press | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198524038.001.0001/acref-9780198524038 | doi = 10.1093/acref/9780198524038.001.0001 | isbn = 9780198524038}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negative effects of thalidomide led to the development of more structured drug regulations and control over drug use and development.&lt;ref name="The chemical industry"&gt;{{cite book | last = Heaton | first = C.

Thalidomide may be helpful in some cases where [[Tuberculosis management|standard TB drugs]] and [[corticosteroid]]s are not sufficient to resolve severe inflammation in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Buonsenso D, Serranti D, Valentini P | title = Management of central nervous system tuberculosis in children: light and shade | journal = European Review for Medical and Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 14 | issue = 10 | pages = 845–53 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 21222370 | url = http://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/827.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160818223324/http://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/827.pdf | archive-date = 2016-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Toorn R, Solomons R | title = Update on the diagnosis and management of tuberculous meningitis in children | journal = Seminars in Pediatric Neurology | volume = 21 | issue = 1 | pages = 12–8 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24655399 | doi = 10.1016/j.spen.2014.01.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used as a second-line treatment to manage [[graft versus host]] disease and [[aphthous stomatitis]] in children and has been prescribed for other conditions in children including [[actinic prurigo]] and [[epidermolysis bullosa]]; the evidence for these uses is weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang CS, Kim C, Antaya RJ | title = Review of thalidomide use in the pediatric population | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 72 | issue = 4 | pages = 703–11 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25617013 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2015.01.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is recommended only as a third line treatment in [[graft versus host]] disease in adults, based on lack of efficacy and side effects observed in clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff D, Gerbitz A, Ayuk F, Kiani A, Hildebrandt GC, Vogelsang GB, Elad S, Lawitschka A, Socie G, Pavletic SZ, Holler E, Greinix H | title = Consensus conference on clinical practice in chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD): first-line and topical treatment of chronic GVHD | journal = Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation | volume = 16 | issue = 12 | pages = 1611–28 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20601036 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.06.015 | url = http://www.bbmt.org/article/S1083-8791(10)00275-2/fulltext }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff D, Schleuning M, von Harsdorf S, Bacher U, Gerbitz A, Stadler M, Ayuk F, Kiani A, Schwerdtfeger R, Vogelsang GB, Kobbe G, Gramatzki M, Lawitschka A, Mohty M, Pavletic SZ, Greinix H, Holler E | title = Consensus Conference on Clinical Practice in Chronic GVHD: Second-Line Treatment of Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease | journal = Biology of Blood and Marrow Transplantation | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–17 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 20685255 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbmt.2010.05.011 | url = http://www.bbmt.org/article/S1083-8791(10)00223-5/fulltext }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contraindications==
Thalidomide should not be used by people who are breast feeding or pregnant, trying to conceive a child, or cannot or will not follow the risk management program to prevent pregnancies. The prescribing doctor is required to ensure that contraception is being used, and regular pregnancy tests must be administered.   Some people are allergic to thalidomide and should not take it.  It should be used with caution in people with chronic infections like HIV or hepatitis B.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

==Adverse effects==
{{See also|List of thalidomide side effects}}
Thalidomide [[Teratogen|causes birth defects]].&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=toxmech2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith SW | title = Chiral toxicology: it's the same thing...only different | journal = Toxicological Sciences | volume = 110 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–30 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19414517 | doi = 10.1093/toxsci/kfp097 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The FDA and other regulatory agencies have approved marketing of the drug only with an auditable  [[risk evaluation and mitigation strategy]] that ensures that people using the drug are aware of the risks and avoid pregnancy; this applies to men and women both, as the drug can be transmitted in sperm.&lt;ref name=toxmech2009/&gt;

There is a high risk that thalidomide can cause excessive [[Thrombosis|blood clots]]. There is also a high risk that thalidomide can interfere with formation of various kinds of new blood cells, creating a risk of infection via [[neutropenia]], [[leukopenia]], and [[lymphopenia]], and risks that blood will not clot via [[thrombocytopenia]].  There is also a risk of [[anemia]] via lack of red blood cells.  The drug can also damage nerves, causing [[peripheral neuropathy]] that may be irreversible.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

Thalidomide has several cardiovascular adverse effects, including risk of [[heart attack]]s, [[pulmonary hypertension]], and changes in heart rhythm including [[syncope (medicine)|syncope]], [[bradycardia]] and [[atrioventricular block]].&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

It can cause [[liver damage]] and severe skin reactions like [[Stevens-Johnson Syndrome]].  It tends to make people sleepy, which creates risk for driving and operating other machinery.   As it kills cancer cells, it can cause [[tumor lysis syndrome]]. Thalidomide can [[Amenorrhea|prevent menstruation]].&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

Other than the above, very common (reported in more than 10% of people) adverse effects include tremor, dizziness, tingling, numbness, constipation, and peripheral edema.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

Common (reported by 1-10% of people) adverse effects include confusion, depressed mood, reduced coordination, heart failure, difficulty breathing, interstitial lung disease, lung inflammation, vomiting, dry mouth, rashes, dry skin, fever, weakness, and a sense of unwellness.&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

=== Interactions ===
There are no expected [[Pharmacokinetics|pharmacokinetic]] interactions between thalidomide and other medicines due to its neutral effects on p-glycoprotein and P450 cytochromes.  It may interact with sedatives due to its sedative action. It may also interact with bradycardic agents due to its bradycardia-inducing effects. The risk of peripheral neuropathy may be increased by concomitant treatment with other agents known to cause peripheral neuropathy.&lt;ref name = TGA&gt;{{cite web|title=THALOMID® CAPSULES|work=TGA eBusiness Services|publisher=Celgene Pty Limited|date=21 June 2013|access-date=17 January 2014|url=https://www.ebs.tga.gov.au/ebs/picmi/picmirepository.nsf/pdf?OpenAgent&amp;id=CP-2010-PI-03581-3|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of venous thromboembolisms with thalidomide seems to be increased when patients are treated with oral contraceptives or other cytotoxic agents (including doxorubicin and melphalan) concurrently. Thalidomide may interfere with the contraceptive effects of various contraceptives and hence it is advised that women of reproductive age use at least two different means of contraception to ensure that no child will be conceived while they are receiving thalidomide.&lt;ref name = TGA/&gt;&lt;ref name=USlabel2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=UKlabel2017/&gt;

===Overdose===

==Pharmacology==
The precise mechanism of action for thalidomide is unknown although efforts to identify thalidomide's [[Teratology|teratogenic]] action generated 2000 research papers and the proposal of 15 or 16 plausible mechanisms by 2000.&lt;ref name=Stephens2000&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stephens TD, Bunde CJ, Fillmore BJ | title = Mechanism of action in thalidomide teratogenesis | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 59 | issue = 12 | pages = 1489–99 | date = June 2000 | pmid = 10799645 | doi = 10.1016/S0006-2952(99)00388-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015 the main theories were inhibition of the process of [[angiogenesis]], its inhibition of [[cereblon]], a [[ubiquitin ligase]], and its ability to generate [[reactive oxygen species]] which in turn kill cells.&lt;ref name=Vargesson2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vargesson N | title = Thalidomide-induced teratogenesis: history and mechanisms | journal = Birth Defects Research.

Thalidomide also binds to and acts as an [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]] of the [[androgen receptor]] (AR) and hence is a [[nonsteroidal antiandrogen]] (NSAA) of some capacity.&lt;ref name="LiuSu2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu B, Su L, Geng J, Liu J, Zhao G | title = Developments in nonsteroidal antiandrogens targeting the androgen receptor | journal = ChemMedChem | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = 1651–61 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20853390 | doi = 10.1002/cmdc.201000259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In accordance, it can produce [[gynecomastia]] and [[sexual dysfunction]] as side effects in men.&lt;ref name="NuttallWarrier2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nuttall FQ, Warrier RS, Gannon MC | title = Gynecomastia and drugs: a critical evaluation of the literature | journal = European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 569–78 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25827472 | doi = 10.1007/s00228-015-1835-x | pmc=4412434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thalidomide is provided as a racemic mixture of two [[enantiomer]]s; while there are reports that only one of the enantiomers may cause birth defects, the body converts each enantiomer into the other through mechanisms that are not well understood.&lt;ref name=toxmech2009/&gt;

Thalidomide is [[Racemic mixture|racemic]]; while the S-thalidomide is the bioactive form of the molecule, the individual enantiomers can [[Racemization|racemize]] to each other due to the acidic hydrogen at the [[chiral centre]], which is the carbon of the glutarimide ring bonded to the phthalimide substituent.

==History ==
Thalidomide was [[drug discovery|discovered]] by scientists at the German pharmaceutical company Chemie Grünenthal (now [[Grünenthal GmbH]]) around 1953.   The company had been set up as a soap maker just after WWII ended, to address the urgent market need for antibiotics. Heinrich Mueckter was appointed to head the discovery program based on his experience working with the German army's antiviral research program. In the course of preparing [[reagents]] for the work, Mueckter's assistant Wilhelm Kunz isolated a by-product, that was in turn recognized by pharmacologist Herbert Keller as an analog of [[glutethimide]], a [[sedative]], and the medicinal chemistry work turned to improving the lead compound into a suitable drug; the result was thalidomide.  The toxicity was examined in several animals, and the drug was introduced in 1956 as a sedative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sneader|first1=Walter|title=Drug discovery : a history|date=2005|publisher=Wiley|location=Chichester|isbn=978-0-471-89979-2|page=367|edition=Rev. and updated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at Chemie Grünenthal also found that thalidomide was a particularly effective [[antiemetic]] that had an inhibitory effect on [[morning sickness]].&lt;ref name=pmid15172781&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Franks ME, Macpherson GR, Figg WD | title = Thalidomide | journal = Lancet | volume = 363 | issue = 9423 | pages = 1802–11 | date = May 2004 | pmid = 15172781 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(04)16308-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, on October 1, 1957, the company launched thalidomide and began marketing it under the trade name Contergan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.grunenthal.com/about-us/history Grünenthal: Where we come from].

During this time period, the use of medications during pregnancy was not strictly controlled, and drugs were not thoroughly tested for potential harm to the [[fetus]].&lt;ref name=pmid15172781/&gt; Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. At the time of the drug's development, scientists did not believe any drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the [[placental barrier]] and harm the developing fetus,&lt;ref name="The chemical industry"/&gt; even though the effect of alcohol on fetal development had been documented by case studies on alcoholic mothers since at least 1957.&lt;ref&gt;See Rouquette (1957) cited by {{cite journal | vauthors = Landesman-Dwyer S | title = Maternal drinking and pregnancy outcome | journal = Applied Research in Mental Retardation | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 241–63 | year = 1982 | pmid = 7149705 | doi = 10.1016/0270-3092(82)90018-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There soon appeared reports of findings of abnormalities in children being born, traced back to the use of the drug thalidomide. In late 1959, it was noticed that [[peripheral neuritis]] developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time, and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over the counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelsey FO | title = Events after thalidomide | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 46 | issue = 6 | pages = 1201–5 | year = 1967 | pmid = 5235007 | doi = 10.1177/00220345670460061201 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence, while initially considered safe, the drug was responsible for [[Teratology|teratogenic]] deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester. In November 1961, thalidomide was taken off the market due to massive pressure from the press and public.&lt;ref name="50year"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thalidomide: The Fifty Year Fight (no longer available)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NLbhOyLLMY|access-date=13 September 2015|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=15 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, about 5,000 of them in [[West Germany]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The regulatory authorities in [[East Germany]] did not approve thalidomide.&lt;ref name="oncozine.com"/&gt; One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in West Germany was that at that time drugs did not have to be tested for [[teratogenic]] effects. They had been tested on rodents only, as was usual at the time.&lt;ref name="VFA"&gt;[http://www.vfa.de/de/arzneimittel-forschung/artikel-arzneimittel-forschung/teratogenitaet.html VFA: teratogenic effects] 6.

In the UK, the British pharmaceutical company The Distillers Company (Biochemicals) Ltd, a subsidiary of Distillers Co. Ltd (now part of [[Diageo plc]]), marketed thalidomide under the brand name Distaval as a remedy for [[morning sickness]] throughout the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Their advertisement claimed that "Distaval can be given with complete safety to pregnant women and nursing mothers without adverse effect on mother or child...Outstandingly safe Distaval has been prescribed for nearly three years in this country."&lt;ref name="oncozine.com"/&gt; Around the world, more and more pharmaceutical companies started to produce and market the drug under license from Chemie Grünenthal. By the mid-1950s, 14 pharmaceutical companies were marketing thalidomide in 46 countries under at least 37 different trade names.

In the U.S., representatives from ''Chemie Grünenthal'' approached ''[[Smith, Kline &amp; French]]'' (SKF), now [[GlaxoSmithKline]] (GSK) with a request to market and distribute the drug in North America. A memorandum rediscovered in 2010 in the archives of the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) shows that, as part of its in-licensing approach, ''Smith, Kline and French'' conducted animal tests and ran a clinical trial of the drug in the United States involving 875 people, including pregnant women, in 1956–57.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In 1956, researchers at SKF involved in clinical trials noted that even when used in very high doses, thalidomide could not induce sleep in mice.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} And when administered at doses 50 to 650 times larger than that claimed by ''Chemie Grünenthal'' to be "sleep inducing", the researchers could still not achieve the hypnotic effect in animals that it had on humans.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} After completion of the trial, and based on reasons kept hidden for decades, SKF declined to commercialize the drug. Later, ''Chemie Grünenthal'', in 1958, reached an agreement with ''William S Merrell Company'' in Cincinnati, Ohio, ([[Marion Merrell Dow#Richardson-Merrell|later Richardson-Merrell]], now part of [[Sanofi]]), to market and distribute thalidomide throughout the United States.&lt;ref name="oncozine.com"/&gt;

The U.S. FDA refused to approve thalidomide for marketing and distribution. However, the drug was distributed in large quantities for testing purposes, after the American distributor and manufacturer [[Marion Merrell Dow#Richardson-Merrell|Richardson-Merrell]] had applied for its approval in September 1960.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The official in charge of the FDA review, [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]], did not rely on information from the company, which did not include any test results. Richardson-Merrell was called on to perform tests and report the results. The company demanded approval six times, and was refused each time. Nevertheless, a total of 17 children with thalidomide-induced malformations were born in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | title = Report | publisher = U.S. Food and Drug Administration | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090512235601/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | archive-date = 12 May 2009 | date = May 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, the history of the drug thalidomide dates back to April 1, 1961. There were many different forms sold, with the most common variant being Talimol.&lt;ref name=pmid14076167&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Webb JF | title = Canadian Thalidomide Experience | journal = Canadian Medical Association Journal | volume = 89 | issue =  | pages = 987–92 | date = November 1963 | pmid = 14076167 | pmc = 1921912 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months after Talimol went on sale, pharmaceutical companies sent physicians letters warning about the risk of birth defects.&lt;ref name=pmid14076167/&gt; It was not until March 2, 1962, that both drugs were banned from the Canadian market by the FDD, and soon afterward physicians were warned to destroy their supplies.&lt;ref name=pmid14076167/&gt;

===Leprosy treatment===
In 1964, Israeli physician [[Jacob Sheskin]] administered thalidomide to a patient critically ill with leprosy. The patient exhibited [[Erythema nodosum|erythema nodosum leprosum&amp;nbsp;(ENL)]], a painful skin condition, one of the complications of [[leprosy]]. This was attempted despite the ban on thalidomide's use, but results were favourable: the patient slept for hours and was able to get out of bed without aid upon awakening.

Thalidomide has been used by Brazilian physicians as the drug of choice for the treatment of severe ENL since 1965, and by 1996, at least 33 cases of thalidomide embryopathy were recorded in people born in Brazil after 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Castilla EE, Ashton-Prolla P, Barreda-Mejia E, Brunoni D, Cavalcanti DP, Correa-Neto J, Delgadillo JL, Dutra MG, Felix T, Giraldo A, Juarez N, Lopez-Camelo JS, Nazer J, Orioli IM, Paz JE, Pessoto MA, Pina-Neto JM, Quadrelli R, Rittler M, Rueda S, Saltos M, Sánchez O, Schüler L | title = Thalidomide, a current teratogen in South America | journal = Teratology | volume = 54 | issue = 6 | pages = 273–7 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 9098920 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1096-9926(199702)55:2&lt;156::AID-TERA6&gt;3.0.CO;2-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1994, the production, dispensing, and prescription of thalidomide have been strictly controlled, requiring women to use two forms of birth control and submit to regular pregnancy tests.

In 1998 the FDA approved the drug's use in the treatment of ENL.&lt;ref name="nyt-fda"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/17/us/thalidomide-approved-to-treat-leprosy-with-other-uses-seen.html | title = Thalidomide Approved to Treat Leprosy, With Other Uses Seen | newspaper = New York Times | first = Sheryl Gay | last = Stolberg | name-list-format = vanc | access-date=8 January 2012|date=17 July 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of thalidomide's potential for causing birth defects, the drug may be distributed only under tightly controlled conditions. The FDA required that [[Celgene Corporation]], which planned to market thalidomide under the brand name ''Thalomid'', establish a system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety (STEPS) oversight program. The conditions required under the program include limiting prescription and dispensing rights to authorized prescribers and pharmacies only, keeping a registry of all patients prescribed thalidomide, providing extensive patient education about the risks associated with the drug, and providing periodic pregnancy tests for women who take the drug.&lt;ref name="nyt-fda"/&gt;

In 2010, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) stated that it did not recommend thalidomide due the difficulty of adequately controlling its use, and due to the availability of [[clofazimine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.who.int/lep/research/thalidomide/en/index.html |title=Use of thalidomide in leprosy|last=Anon|work=WHO:leprosy elimination |publisher=WHO |access-date=22 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer treatment===
Shortly after the teratogenic properties of thalidomide were recognized in the mid-1960s, its anti-cancer potential was explored and two clinical trials were conducted in people with advanced cancer, including some people with multiple myeloma; the trials were inconclusive.&lt;ref name=Kyle&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kyle RA, Rajkumar SV | title = Multiple myeloma | journal = Blood | volume = 111 | issue = 6 | pages = 2962–72 | date = March 2008 | pmid = 18332230 | pmc = 2265446 | doi = 10.1182/blood-2007-10-078022 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little further work was done with thalidomide in cancer until the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Kyle/&gt;

[[Judah Folkman]] pioneered studies into the role of [[angiogenesis]] (the proliferation and growth of blood vessels) in the development of cancer, and in the early 1970s had shown that [[solid tumors]] could not expand without it.&lt;ref name=NASbio&gt;{{cite web | first = Patricia K | last = Donahoe | name-list-format = vanc | url = http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/folkman-judah.pdf | title = Judah Folkman: 1933–2008.

After further work was done by Celgene and others, in 2006 the U.S.&amp;nbsp;Food and Drug Administration granted accelerated approval for thalidomide in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of newly diagnosed [[multiple myeloma]] patients.&lt;ref name=Beilenberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/druginfo/fda-thalidomide|publisher=National Cancer Institute|access-date=8 January 2012|title=FDA Approval for Thalidomide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==

===Birth defects crisis===
[[Image:NCP14053.jpg|thumb|Baby born to a mother who had taken thalidomide while pregnant]]
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, more than 10,000 children in 46 countries were born with [[deformities]] such as [[phocomelia]] as a consequence of thalidomide use.&lt;ref name="Bren"&gt;{{cite news | author = Bren L | title =Frances Oldham Kelsey: FDA Medical Reviewer Leaves Her Mark on History | url =http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1609/www.fda.gov/fdac/features/2001/201_kelsey.html | work =FDA Consumer|publisher =U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] | date =2001-02-28 | access-date =2009-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The severity and location of the deformities depended on how many days into the pregnancy the mother was before beginning treatment; thalidomide taken on the 20th day of pregnancy caused central brain damage, day 21 would damage the eyes, day 22 the ears and face, day 24 the arms, and leg damage would occur if taken up to day 28. Thalidomide did not damage the fetus if taken after 42 days gestation.&lt;ref name="50year"/&gt;

It is not known exactly how many worldwide victims of the drug there have been, although estimates range from 10,000 to 20,000&lt;ref name="nyt-answers"&gt;{{cite news|author = Zimmer C | title = Answers Begin to Emerge on How Thalidomide Caused Defects | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/16/science/16limb.html?ref=science&amp;pagewanted=all | quote = As they report in the current issue of Science, a protein known as cereblon latched on tightly to the thalidomide | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = March 15, 2010|access-date = 2010-03-21 | authorlink = Carl Zimmer }}&lt;/ref&gt;  to 100,000.&lt;ref name="50year"/&gt; Despite the side effects, thalidomide was sold in pharmacies in Canada until 1962.&lt;ref name=pmid14076167/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=21267 |title=Turning Points of History–Prescription for Disaster |publisher=History Television |access-date=24 February 2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929135332/http://www.history.ca/ontv/titledetails.aspx?titleid=21267 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the drug was licensed in 1958 and withdrawn in 1961. Of the approximately 2,000 babies born with defects, around half died within a few months and 466 survived to at least 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/8458855.stm|title=Apology for thalidomide survivors|date=14 January 2010  |publisher=BBC News|access-date=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, thalidomide was widely available throughout the 1970s, perhaps even into the 1980s. There were two reasons for this. First, state controls and safeguarding were poor; indeed, it was not until 2008 that the government even admitted the country had ever imported thalidomide. Second, Grünenthal failed to insist that its sister company in Madrid warn Spanish doctors, and permitted it to not warn them. The Spanish advocacy group for victims of thalidomide estimates that in 2015, there were 250–300 living victims of thalidomide in Spain.&lt;ref name ="SundayTimesMag Spain"&gt;{{cite news | last1 = Scott | first1 = Caroline | last2 = Haupt | first2 = Oliver | name-list-format = vanc | date = 3 May 2015 | title = The forgotten victims | url = http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/article1551306.ece | newspaper = [[The Sunday Times Magazine]] | pages = 12–19 | access-date = 8 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Australian obstetrician [[William McBride (doctor)|William McBride]] took credit for raising the alarm about thalidomide it was a [[midwife]] who first suspected the drug was causing birth defects in the babies of patients under his care at [[Crown Street Women's Hospital]] in Sydney.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2018-06-29/thalidomide-william-mcbride-flawed-character-norman-swan/9920608&lt;/ref&gt; German [[paediatrician]] [[Widukind Lenz]], who also suspected the link, is credited with conducting the scientific research that proved thalidomide was causing birth defects in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1002.html|title=Widukind Lenz|last=Anon|work=who name it?|publisher= Ole Daniel Enersen|access-date=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="40 years on"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2031459.stm|title=Thalidomide:40 years on|last=Anon|work=BBC news|publisher=BBC|access-date=2009-05-01 | date=2002-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; McBride was later awarded a number of honors, including a medal and prize money by L'Institut de la Vie in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/Defect/page5i.htm |title=Report of Thalidomide at University of New South Wales |publisher=Embryology.med.unsw.edu.au |access-date=2012-12-30 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028204857/http://embryology.med.unsw.edu.au/Defect/page5i.htm |archive-date=2012-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was eventually struck off the Australian medical register in 1993 for scientific fraud.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/thalidomide-doctor-guilty-of-medical-fraud-william-mcbride-who-exposed-the-danger-of-one-anti-nausea-1474190.html&lt;/ref&gt; Further animal tests were conducted by Dr George Somers, Chief Pharmacologist of [[Distillers Company]] in Britain, which showed foetal abnormalities in rabbits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Somers GF | date = 1963 | title = The foetal toxicity of thalidomide | journal = Proc.

In [[East Germany]], the head of the central pharmacy control commission, Friedrich Jung, suspected an antivitaminic effect of thalidomide as derivative of [[glutamic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.neues-deutschland.de/artikel/120351.html |title=DDR-Bürger schliefen ohne Contergan |trans-title=East German citizens slept without thalidomide |language=German |work=[[Neues Deutschland]] |date=4 November 2007 |accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in [[West Germany]], it took some time before the increase in [[dysmelia]] at the end of the 1950s was connected with thalidomide. In 1958, Karl Beck, a former pediatric doctor in [[Bayreuth]], wrote an article in a local newspaper claiming a relationship between nuclear weapons testing and cases of dysmelia in children.&lt;ref name=daeb/&gt; Based on this, [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]] [[Whip (politics)|whip]] [[Erich Mende]] requested an official statement from the federal government.&lt;ref name=daeb/&gt; For statistical reasons, the main data series used to research dysmelia cases started by chance at the same time as the approval date for thalidomide.&lt;ref name=daeb&gt;{{cite journal |archive-url=http://www.contergan-ag50.de/Seiten/presse/20111125-27_artikel/2007_Die_Contergan-Katastrophe_Die_truegerische_Sicherheit_der_harten_Daten-Deutsches_Aerzteblatt.pdf |archive-date=December 6, 2011|dead-url=no|url=http://www.aerzteblatt.de/archiv/57224/ |access-date=June 6, 2013 |first=Klaus-Dieter |last=Thomann | name-list-format = vanc |title=Die Contergan-Katastrophe: Die trügerische Sicherheit der "harten" Daten |trans-title=The thalidomide disaster: The false security of 'hard' data|language=German|journal=Deutsches Ärzteblatt |year=2007 |volume=104 |issue=41 |pages=A–2778 / B–2454 / C–2382}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Nazi regime with its [[Law for the Prevention of Hereditarily Diseased Offspring]] used mandatory statistical monitoring to commit various [[Action T4|crimes]], western Germany had been very reluctant to monitor [[congenital disorder]]s in a similarly strict way.&lt;ref Name ="th"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors =  Zichner L, Rauschmann MA, Thomann KD | title = Die Contergankatastrophe eine Bilanz nach 40 Jahren | trans-title = The thalidomide catastrophe takes stock after 40 years | language = German | date = 2005 | publisher = Steinkopff | location = Darmstadt | isbn = 978-3-7985-1479-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentary report rejected any relation with radioactivity and the abnormal increase of dysmelia.&lt;ref name=daeb/&gt; Also the DFG research project installed after the Mende request was not helpful.

Several countries either restricted the drug's use or never approved it. Ingeborg Eichler, a member of the [[Austria]]n pharmaceutical admission conference, enforced thalidomide (tradename Softenon) being sold under the rules of [[prescription medication]] and as a result relatively few affected children were born in Austria and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orf.at/070930-17124/index.html|title=10.000 Fälle von Missbildungen|trans-title=10,000 cases of malformations|language=German|publisher=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]|access-date=June 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814144428/http://orf.at/070930-17124/index.html|archive-date=2009-08-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, [[pharmacologist]] [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] [[M.D.]] withstood pressure from the [[Marion Merrell Dow|Richardson-Merrell]] company and refused [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval to market thalidomide, saying further studies were needed.&lt;ref name="Bren" /&gt; This reduced the impact of thalidomide in United States patients. Although thalidomide was never approved for sale in the United States at the time, over 2.5 million tablets had been distributed to over 1,000 physicians during a clinical testing program. It is estimated that nearly 20,000 patients, several hundred of whom were pregnant women, were given the drug to help alleviate morning sickness or as a sedative, and at least 17 children were consequently born in America with thalidomide-associated deformities.&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/whitny-braun/thalidomide-the-connectio_b_8881702.html|title=Thalidomide: The Connection Between a Statue in Trafalgar Square, a 1960s Children's Show Host and the Abortion Debate|last=Braun|first=Whitny | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2015-12-29 | website = Huffington Post | access-date = 2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birthdefects.org/research/bendectin_1.php |title=Bendectin Part 1: How a Commonly Used Drug Caused Birth Defects |last=Mekdeci |first=Betty| name-list-format = vanc | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218004638/http://www.birthdefects.org/research/bendectin_1.php |archive-date=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A woman named [[Sherri Finkbine]] publicized the serious problems of thalidomide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cliohistory.org/click/body-health/reproduction/|title=Click - Debating Reproductive Rights - Reproductive Rights and Feminism, History of Abortion Battle, History of Abortion Debate, Roe v.

She had later learned that thalidomide was causing fetal deformities. She wanted to abort her pregnancy, but the laws of Arizona allowed abortion only if the mother's life was in danger. Finkbine traveled to [[Sweden]] to have the abortion, which was expensive for her. Thalidomide was found to have deformed the fetus.&lt;ref name="Braun"/&gt;

===Aftermath of scandal===
The numerous reports of malformations in babies brought about the awareness of the side effects of the drug on pregnant women. The birth defects caused by the drug thalidomide can range from moderate malformation to more severe forms. Possible birth defects include phocomelia, dysmelia, amelia, bone hypoplasticity, and other congenital defects affecting the ear, heart, or internal organs.&lt;ref name=pmid15172781/&gt; Franks et al. looked at how the drug affected newborn babies, the severity of their deformities, and reviewed the drug in its early years. Webb in 1963 also reviewed the history of the drug and the different forms of birth defects it had caused. "The most common form of birth defects from thalidomide is shortened limbs, with the arms being more frequently affected. This syndrome is the presence of deformities of the long bones of the limbs resulting in shortening and other abnormalities."&lt;ref name=pmid14076167/&gt;

====Germany====
In 1968, a large criminal trial began in Germany, charging several Grünenthal officials with negligent homicide and injury. 
After Grünenthal settled with the victims in April 1970, the trial ended in December 1970 with no finding of guilt. As part of the settlement, Grünenthal paid 100 million [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] into a special foundation; the German government added 320 million DM. The foundation paid victims a one-time sum of 2,500-25,000 DM (depending on severity of disability) and a monthly stipend of 100-450 DM. The monthly stipends have since been raised substantially and are now paid entirely by the government (as the foundation had run out of money). Grünenthal paid another 50 million Euros into the foundation in 2008.

On 31 August 2012, Grünenthal chief executive Harald F. Stock who served as the Chief Executive Officer of Grünenthal [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] from January 2009 to May 28, 2013 and was also a Member of Executive Board until 28 May 2013, apologized for the first time for producing the drug and remaining silent about the birth defects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speech on the occasion of the inauguration of Thalidomide-Memorial|url=http://www.contergan.grunenthal.info/grt-ctg/GRT-CTG/Stellungnahme/Rede_anlaesslich_Einweihung_des_Contergan-Denkmals/224600963.jsp|website=Grünenthal GmbH Website|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901184544/http://www.contergan.grunenthal.info/grt-ctg/GRT-CTG/Stellungnahme/Rede_anlaesslich_Einweihung_des_Contergan-Denkmals/224600963.jsp|archive-date=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a ceremony, Stock unveiled a statue of a disabled child to symbolize those harmed by thalidomide and apologized for not trying to reach out to victims for over 50&amp;nbsp;years. At the time of the apology, there were 5,000 to 6,000 sufferers still alive. Victim advocates called the apology "insulting" and "too little, too late", and criticized the company for not compensating victims.

====Australia====
Melbourne woman Lynette Rowe, who was born without limbs, led an Australian [[class action]] lawsuit against the drug's manufacturer, Grünenthal, which fought to have the case heard in Germany. The [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] dismissed Grünenthal's application in 2012, and the case was heard in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-12-19/australian-thalidomide-victims-win-hearing-bid/3738116|title=Australian thalidomide victims win right for hearing|date=19 December 2011|newspaper=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 July 2012, Rowe was awarded an out-of-court settlement, believed to be in the millions of dollars and paving the way for class action victims to receive further compensation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Petrie |first=Andrea | name-list-format = vanc |date=19 July 2012 |title=Landmark thalidomide payout offers hope for thousands |url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/landmark-thalidomide-payout-offers-hope-for-thousands-20120718-22apa.html |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |access-date=14 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014, the Supreme Court of Victoria endorsed the settlement of $89 million AUD to 107 victims of the drug in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Farnsworth|first=Sarah| name-list-format = vanc |title=Supreme Court formally approves $89m compensation payout for Thalidomide victims|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-07/supreme-court-formally-approves-2489m-class-action-for-thalido/5245034|access-date=14 February 2017|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Australian Associated Press]]|title=Thalidomide survivors' compensation approved|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/health/9698482/Thalidomide-survivors-compensation-approved|access-date=14 February 2017|work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]]|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
The drug thalidomide's birth defects in children affected many people's lives, and from these events came the formation of the group called [[The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada]], a group of 120 Canadian survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren R | title = Living in a world with thalidomide: a dose of reality | journal = FDA Consumer | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 40 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11444250 | url = http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps1609/www.fda.gov/fdac/departs/2001/201_word.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090624192258/http://www.thalidomide.ca/tvac-mission/ The Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to prevent future usage of drugs that could be of potential harm to mothers and babies. The members from the thalidomide victims association were involved in the STEPS program, which aimed to prevent teratogenicity.&lt;ref name=pmid15172781/&gt;

The effects of thalidomide increased fears regarding the safety of pharmaceutical drugs. The Society of Toxicology of Canada was formed after the effects of thalidomide were made public, focusing on toxicology as a discipline separate from pharmacology.&lt;ref name=pmid12909394&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Racz WJ, Ecobichon DJ, Baril M | title = On-line sources of toxicological information in Canada | journal = Toxicology | volume = 190 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 3–14 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12909394 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-483X(03)00192-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for the testing and approval of the toxins in certain pharmaceutical drugs became more important after the disaster. The Society of Toxicology of Canada is responsible for the Conservation Environment Protection Act, focusing on researching the impact to human health of chemical substances.&lt;ref name=pmid12909394/&gt; Thalidomide brought on changes in the way drugs are tested, what type of drugs are used during pregnancy, and increased the awareness of potential side effects of drugs.

According to [[W5 (TV series)|Canadian news magazine program ''W5'']], most, but not all, victims  of thalidomide receive annual benefits as compensation from the [[Government of Canada]]. Excluded are those who cannot provide the documentation the government requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The plight of the thalidomide 'sample babies' who don't qualify for gov't compensation |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/w5/the-plight-of-the-thalidomide-sample-babies-who-don-t-qualify-for-gov-t-compensation-1.3176590 |work=W5 |access-date=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
[[Image:Frances Oldham Kelsey and John F. Kennedy.jpg|thumb|upright|1962: FDA pharmacologist [[Frances Oldham Kelsey]] receives the [[President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service]] from President [[John F. Kennedy]] for blocking sale of thalidomide in the United States.]]
For denying the application despite the pressure from Richardson-Merrell, Kelsey eventually received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service at a 1962 ceremony with President [[John F. Kennedy]]. In September 2010, the FDA honored Kelsey with the first Kelsey award, given annually to an FDA staff member. This came 50 years after Kelsey, then a new medical officer at the agency, first reviewed the application from the William S. Merrell Company of Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Gardiner | last = Harris | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/14/health/14kelsey.html?_r=1&amp;8dpc|title=The Public's Quiet Savior From Harmful Medicines|date=13 September 2010|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cardiologist [[Helen B. Taussig]] learned of the damaging effects of the drug thalidomide on newborns and in 1967, testified before Congress on this matter after a trip to Germany where she worked with infants with [[phocomelia]] (severe limb deformities). As a result of her efforts, thalidomide was banned in the United States and Europe.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Change in drug regulations===
The disaster prompted many countries to introduce tougher rules for the testing and licensing of drugs, such as the [[Kefauver Harris Amendment]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=50 Years: The Kefauver-Harris Amendments|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/NewsEvents/ucm320924.htm|publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]]|access-date=6 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (U.S.), [[Directive 65/65/EEC1]] (E.U.),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thalidomide |url=http://www.crncc.nihr.ac.uk/workforce_development/learning_and_development/gcp/gcp_resource/research_standards/history/thalidomide |publisher=[[National Health Service (England)]] |access-date=6 June 2013 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020225/http://www.crncc.nihr.ac.uk/workforce_development/learning_and_development/gcp/gcp_resource/research_standards/history/thalidomide |archive-date=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Medicines Act 1968]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Conroy S, McIntyre J, Choonara I | title = Unlicensed and off label drug use in neonates | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = F142–4; discussion F144–5 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10325794 | doi = 10.1136/fn.80.2.F142 | pmc=1720896}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Royal Pharmaceutical Society | title = The  evolution of pharmacy, Theme E, Level 3 Thalidomide and its aftermath | url = https://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/e3a-thalidomide-and-its-aftermath-2011.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111014114005/https://www.rpharms.com/museum-pdfs/e3a-thalidomide-and-its-aftermath-2011.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 14 October 2011 | date = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the new regulations strengthened the FDA, among other ways, by requiring applicants to prove efficacy and to disclose all side effects encountered in testing.&lt;ref name=Bren /&gt; The FDA subsequently initiated the [[Drug Efficacy Study Implementation]] to reclassify drugs already on the market.

==Research==
Research efforts have been focused on determining how thalidomide causes birth defects and its other activities in the human body, efforts to develop safer analogs, and efforts to find further uses for thalidomide.

===Thalidomide analogs===
{{Main|Development of analogs of thalidomide}}
The exploration of the [[antiangiogenic]] and immunomodulatory activities of thalidomide has led to the study and creation of thalidomide [[Analog (chemistry)|analog]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid10447943"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shah JH, Swartz GM, Papathanassiu AE, Treston AM, Fogler WE, Madsen JW, Green SJ | title = Synthesis and enantiomeric separation of 2-phthalimidino-glutaric acid analogues: potent inhibitors of tumor metastasis | journal = Journal of Medicinal Chemistry | volume = 42 | issue = 16 | pages = 3014–7 | date = August 1999 | pmid = 10447943 | doi = 10.1021/jm990083y }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid11740816&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = D'Amato RJ, Lentzsch S, Anderson KC, Rogers MS | title = Mechanism of action of thalidomide and 3-aminothalidomide in multiple myeloma | journal = Seminars in Oncology | volume = 28 | issue = 6 | pages = 597–601 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11740816 | doi = 10.1016/S0093-7754(01)90031-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Celgene has sponsored numerous clinical trials with analogues to thalidomide, such as [[lenalidomide]], that are substantially more powerful and have fewer side effects&amp;nbsp;— except for greater [[myelosuppression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rao KV | title = Lenalidomide in the treatment of multiple myeloma | journal = American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy | volume = 64 | issue = 17 | pages = 1799–807 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17724360 | doi = 10.2146/ajhp070029 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Celgene received FDA approval for [[lenalidomide]] (Revlimid) as the first commercially useful derivative. Revlimid is available only in a restricted distribution setting to avoid its use during pregnancy. Further studies are being conducted to find safer compounds with useful qualities. Another more potent analog, [[pomalidomide]], is now FDA approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct/search?term=pomalidomide&amp;submit=Search |title=Search of: pomalidomide|publisher=Clinicaltrials.gov|access-date=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[apremilast]] was approved by the FDA in March 2014. These [[Discovery and development of thalidomide and its analogs|thalidomide analogs]] can be used to treat different diseases, or used in a regimen to fight two conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raghupathy R, Billett HH | title = Promising therapies in sickle cell disease | journal = Cardiovascular &amp; Hematological Disorders Drug Targets | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19275572 | doi = 10.2174/187152909787581354 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest turned to [[pomalidomide]], a [[derivative (chemistry)|derivative]] of thalidomide marketed by [[Celgene Corporation|Celgene]]. It is a very active anti-angiogenic agent &lt;ref name=pmid11740816/&gt;  and also acts as an [[immunomodulator]].

'''''The Nest''''' is an American creature feature horror film, based on the novel by Eli Cantor (under the pseudonym of Gregory A Douglas), from [[Roger Corman]]'s Concorde Pictures and producer [[Julie Corman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cinefantastique, Volume 27, Issues 2-12|year=1995|publisher=F.S. Clarke|pages=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=EyvKUKiGJens0QGwqICIAg&amp;id=NSAnAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22the+Nest%22+Winkless&amp;q=%22the+Nest%22#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tagline is "''Roaches have never tasted flesh... until now.''" Flesh-eating [[zombie]]-like mutant [[cockroach]]es terrorize a peaceful island community presented as a New England fishing village. However, the film was created on location at Bronson Caves, Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park in Los Angeles, as well as Malibu, Leo Carillo Beach, and Catalina Island.

==Plot summary==
The sheriff of this small island town called North Port has a roach problem in his house. According to the local exterminator Homer (played by Stephen Davies), it turns out the whole town is about to have a big roach problem. Pets, and then people, begin to disappear.

Although Sheriff Richard Tarbell (played by Frank Luz) is dating Lillian, the owner of the local eatery, his high school sweetheart Elizabeth Johnson returns to the island after a four-year absence and their romance blooms again. Elizabeth (played by Lisa Langlois) happens to be the daughter of the town's mayor, Elias Johnson (played by [[Robert Lansing (actor)|Robert Lansing]]), who is in cahoots with an [[evil corporation]] called INTEC that has been secretly breeding mutant roaches that are immune to normal insect repellants. They also seem to have the ability to assume the form of anything they kill, leading to some animal/roach hybrids and even a roach/human combo.

== Release ==
''The Nest'' received a [[limited release]] theatrically from Concorde Films the United States in May 1988.  It was released later that year on [[VHS]] by [[MGM Home Entertainment|MGM/UA Home Video]].

[[New Concorde|New Concorde Home Entertainment]] released the film on DVD in 2001 and [[Shout! Factory]] released a Blu-ray/DVD combo pack in 2013.

A class of [[warm-blooded|endotherm]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;ic organisms known as [[homeotherms]] maintain internal temperatures, with minimal metabolic regulation, within a range of ambient temperatures called The '''thermal neutral zone (TNZ)'''. Within the TNZ the [[basal rate]] of heat production is equal to the rate of heat loss to the environment. Homeothermic organisms adjust to the temperatures within the TNZ through different responses requiring little energy.

Environmental temperatures can cause fluctuations in a homeothermic organism’s metabolic rate. This response is due to the energy required to maintain relatively constant body temperature above ambient temperature by controlling heat loss and heat gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/resources/highschool/chemmatters/past-issues/archive-2013-2014/animal-survival-in-extreme-temperatures.html|title=Chilling Out, Warming Up: How Animals Survive Temperature Extremes|last=Rohrig|first=Brian|date=October 2013|website=American Chemical Society|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The degree of this response depends not only on the species, but also on the levels of insulative and metabolic adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1113/jphysiol.1971.sp009573|title=Metabolic rate and thermal insulation in albino and hairless mice|last=Mount|first=L.E.|date=September 1971|website=The Journal of Physiology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental temperatures below the TNZ, the lower critical temperature (LCT), require an organism to increase its metabolic rate to meet the environmental demands for heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sora.unm.edu/sites/default/files/journals/wilson/v085n02/p0223-p0229.pdf|title=Standard Metabolic Rate and Lower Critical Temperature for the Ruffed Grouse|last=Rasmussen and Brander|first=|date=1972|website=Searchable Ornithological Research Archive|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regulation about the TNZ requires metabolic heat production when the LCT is reached, as heat is lost to the environment. The organism reaches the '''LCT''' when the T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (ambient temp.) decreases.

When an organism reaches this stage the [[Metabolism|metabolic rate]] increases significantly and [[thermogenesis]] increases the T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; (body temp.) If the Ta continues to decrease far below the LCT hypothermia occurs. Alternatively, evaporative heat loss for cooling when temperatures above the TNZ, the upper critical zone (UCT), are realized  Speakman and Keijer 2013). When the T&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; reaches too far out of the UCT the rate heat gain and heat production become higher than the rate of heat dissipation (heat loss through [[evaporative cooling]]), resulting in hyperthermia.

It can show postural changes where it changes its body shape or moves and exposes different areas to the sun/shade, and through radiation, convection and conduction, [[heat transfer|heat exchange]] occurs. Vasomotor responses allow control of the flow of blood between the periphery and the core to control heat loss from the surface of the body. Lastly, the organism can show insulation adjustments; a common example being “goosebumps” in humans where [[hair follicle]]s are raised by pilomotor muscles, also shown in animals’ pelage and plumage.&lt;ref&gt;D. Randall, W. Burggren, K. French. Eckert [[Physiology|animal physiology]] 2001 W.H Freeman&lt;/ref&gt;

==In humans==

The thermoneutral zone describes a range of temperatures of the immediate environment in which a standard healthy adult can maintain normal body temperature without needing to use energy above and beyond normal basal metabolic rate. Its value is 25 - 30 degrees Celsius (77 - 86 degrees Fahrenheit) for a naked man, standing upright, in still air. Note this is for a resting human and does not allow for shivering, sweating or exercising. Even with light clothing, radiation and convection losses are dramatically reduced, effectively reducing the TNZ. Hence, a comfortable temperature in a heated building may be 18 - 22 degrees Celsius (64.4 - 71.6 degrees Fahrenheit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kingma, Frijns, Schellen, van Marken Lichtenbelt|title=Beyond the classic thermoneutral zone|journal=Temperature|date=2014-06-08|volume=2|issue=1|pages=142–149|doi=10.4161/temp.29702|pmc=4977175|pmid=27583296}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kingma, Frijns, van Marken Lichtenbelt|title=The thermoneutral zone: implications for metabolic studies|journal=Frontiers in Bioscience|doi=10.2741/E518|volume=E4|year=2012|pages=1975–1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human]]s produce an obligatory ~100 watts of heat energy as a by-product from basic processes like pumping blood, digesting, breathing, biochemical synthesis and catabolism etc. This is comparable to a common incandescent light-bulb. Hence, if the body were perfectly insulated, core temperature would continue to increase until lethal core temperatures were achieved. Conversely, we are normally in surroundings that are considerably colder than body core temperature (37 degrees Celsius or 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit) and hence there is a large gradient for thermal energy flow from the core to the surroundings. Therefore, the body must ensure it can also minimize the loss of heat to around 100 watts, if it is to maintain core temperature. In short, the skin must be able to get rid of 100 watts of heat in relatively warm environments, but also ensure that it does not lose too much more than this in relatively cold environments.

The human outer or peripheral shell (skin, subcutaneous fat etc.) acts as an adjustable insulator/radiator with the main mechanism of adjustment being blood flow to this compartment. If the surroundings are warm then heat loss is less, so the body directs more blood to the periphery to maintain the gradient for energy flow. Conversely, if the surroundings are cool, blood flow can be profoundly reduced to the skin, so that heat loss is reduced significantly.

These passive processes determine the TNZ, as negligible work is done to redirect blood to the peripheries or the core.

Physiological mechanisms:

The skin has a huge capacity to accept blood flow resulting in a range of 1ml/100g of skin/min, to 150ml/100g/min. Its metabolic requirements are very low and hence it only requires a very small fraction of the heart's output to maintain its own growth and metabolism. In temperate environments the blood flow to the skin is much higher than required for metabolism, the determining factor is the need for the body to get rid of its heat. In fact, skin can survive for long periods of time (hours) with sub-physiological blood flow and oxygenation, and, as long as this is followed by a period of good perfusion, necrosis will not occur.

In temperate environments there is room to increase or decrease blood flow to the skin dramatically. This is achieved by way of special arrangements in the vascular beds of the skin. There are significant numbers of extra vessels, especially in the extremities with their large surface areas (hands, ears, toes etc.). These are direct connections between artery and vein which bypass nourishing capillaries, and are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. These shunts are normally mostly closed, but opening them up allows the skin to become engorged with blood, and because these vessels have low resistance, the blood flow through them is brisk. Conversely, when blood supply to the skin must be reduced these shunts can be closed and furthermore, the normal mechanism of vasoconstriction of arterioles, can dramatically reduce perfusion of the skin.

'''Tillson Lever Harrison''' (January 7, 1881 – January 10, 1947) was a Canadian physician, army officer and adventurer. Moving to New York and enlisting in the United States Army at an early age, he later returned to Canada to attend the University of Toronto before practising as a physician in a number of dangerous positions, such as the Chief of Medical Staff to [[Pancho Villa]] and the doctor for the [[Chinese Labour Corps]], a workforce of over 200,000 men. After World War I, he traveled throughout the Middle East, treating [[sexually transmitted disease|venereal disease]] and operating an [[X-ray]] facility in [[Lod|Lod, Israel]].

After attempting to elope with one of his Middle East hospital patients, Harrison was deported to Canada but managed to jump ship in Morocco and join the [[Irish Free State|Free State Army]]. In the 1930s, he traveled through 15 countries and dependencies performing medical duties, and served as a ship's doctor on a liner that crossed the Indian Ocean during World War II . From 1946 until his death, he assisted in the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA) in China, saving many lives.

By the end of his life, Harrison could speak six languages, had participated in seven wars, and was married to four women at the same time. His daughter Rosalind said that the character [[Indiana Jones]] was based on him. According to Rosalind, film producers [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] contacted her after her father's death and conducted a series of interviews, during which she provided an account of his life.&lt;ref name=indiana&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levine|first1=Allan |date=November 6, 2007|title="I dare do all...": The saga of Dr. Tillson Lever Harrison |journal=[[Canadian Medical Association]] Journal |volume=177 |issue=10 |pages=1237–1239|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/177/10/1237.pdf |doi=10.1503/cmaj.071468 |pmc=2043073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Harrison was born on January 7, 1881, in [[Tillsonburg]], [[Ontario]], a town named for his great-grandfather George. His grandfather, Edwin Delevan Tillson, was the builder of what is now the [[Annandale National Historic Site]]. As a child, Harrison was considered a troublemaker. On one occasion he locked his grandmother in her bedroom and on another became a local newspaper sensation after his attempt to travel to Cuba was discovered.&lt;ref name=indiana /&gt; In 1894, he was enrolled at the [[Upper Canada College]] in [[Toronto]], but left the next year.&lt;ref name=picrender /&gt; At the age of 14, he ran away to join the 22nd Oxford Rifles militia, headquartered in [[Oxford County, Ontario|Oxford County]], but was returned home when it was discovered that he was underage. Soon after, he moved to [[New York City]] to join the United States Army Engineers and serve as part of the peacekeeping force in the Philippines after [[Spanish–American War|the defeat of Spain in 1898]], and for a brief period to help put down the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China.&lt;ref name=picrender /&gt; Mostly involved in the running of labor gangs building supply roads to remote areas, Harrison was involved in only one firefight. However, when his maternal grandfather, Edwin "E.D." Tillson (whose company evolved into [[Quaker Oats Company|Quaker Oats]]), discovered what the 20-year-old was doing, he used his connections to influence General [[Adna Chaffee]] into issuing a general order for the recall of Harrison from the field.&lt;ref name=anb&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01890.html |title=Harrison, Tillson Lever |author=Levine, Allan E. |date=May 2008 |work=[[American National Biography]] Online |publisher= |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While serving with the US Army, Harrison contracted [[cholera]] and returned to Canada. Using the inheritance he had received from his recently deceased grandfather, Harrison began attending the [[University of Toronto]] medical school before marrying Sybil Wilkin, a lawyer's daughter, in 1905.&lt;ref name=indiana /&gt;&lt;ref name=picrender /&gt;&lt;ref name=canada&gt;{{cite book|title=Harrison, Tillson Lever|last=Levine|first=Allan|authorlink=|author2=|year=|publisher=''[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]''|location=|isbn=|page=|pages=|url=http://www.encyclopediecanadienne.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0010360|accessdate=January 7, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706180259/http://www.encyclopediecanadienne.ca/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0010360|archivedate=July 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tourism&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tourismoxford.ca/Heritage/ColourfulCharacters.aspx|title=Dr. Tillson Lever Harrison|author=|date=|work=|publisher=Tourism Oxford|accessdate=January 7, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426034953/http://www.tourismoxford.ca/Heritage/ColourfulCharacters.aspx|archivedate=April 26, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his graduation from medical school in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Roll of Service, 1914–1918 |last=University of Toronto |first= |authorlink= |author2= |year=2009 |publisher=BiblioLife |location=Toronto |isbn=978-1-110-30627-5 |page=302 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W1jMjVVI2cMC |accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison gained employment with the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and began treating the [[Cree]] community of [[Alberta]] and acting as the local postmaster.&lt;ref name=anb /&gt; Soon after, Harrison again moved his family to [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]] and finally [[Drewsey, Oregon]], where he became a doctor, pharmacist, mayor, developer and rancher. In 1909, Harrison fathered a daughter, Rosalind, with his wife Sybil. In 1912, the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] published an article written by Harrison, titled "Cesarean Section Under Difficulties", which documented a [[caesarean section]] he performed in a remote ranch-house lit by an oil lamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harrison |first1=Tillson |year=1912 |title=Cesarean Section Under Difficulties |journal=[[Journal of the American Medical Association]] |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages= 37|url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/LIX/1/37.short |doi= 10.1001/jama.1912.04270070039015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his restless nature, Harrison left his family in Oregon and traveled to London in 1913 to undergo postgraduate work in [[gynecology]] and [[obstetrics]]. When [[World War I]] began in 1914, Harrison assisted in the war effort in [[Belgium]]. While there, he met a Turkish woman named Eva, and married her without divorcing his first wife. In 1915, Harrison and his new wife traveled to [[El Paso, Texas]], to settle down.&lt;ref name=indiana /&gt;&lt;ref name=canada /&gt;&lt;ref name=tourism /&gt;

== North American conflict and World War I ==

Shortly after arriving in Texas, Harrison took the dangerous job of Chief of Medical Staff to Mexican revolutionary general [[Pancho Villa]]. In one situation, Harrison was captured by Villa's foe [[Venustiano Carranza]], later the [[President of Mexico]]. The doctor was sentenced to death, but when Carranza became ill, Harrison was spared as he was the only qualified physician available. Harrison kept the general in a state of near-recovery, enabling him to escape and deliver military information to US forces stationed along the border.&lt;ref name=indiana /&gt;&lt;ref name=canada /&gt;&lt;ref name=tourism /&gt;

After a brief stay among the [[Mormon]] community of southern [[Utah]], Harrison enlisted in the [[Canadian Forces Land Force Command|Canadian Army]] Medical Corps in 1917 and was stationed at a French hospital, where he tended to the needs of the Chinese Labour Corps. Quickly learning the language and customs of this group of some 200,000 men, Harrison successfully treated many [[schistosomiasis|bilharzia]], [[catarrh]] and [[tuberculosis]] cases, significantly reducing the number of sick members of the Corps during the winter of 1917–18.&lt;ref name=indiana /&gt;&lt;ref name=canada /&gt;&lt;ref name=tourism /&gt;

== Interwar period ==

After [[World War I]], Harrison traveled the [[Middle East]] performing medical duties such as treating prostitutes afflicted with [[sexually transmitted disease|venereal disease]] in [[Constantinople]] and operating an [[X-ray]] facility in [[Lod|Lod, Israel]].&lt;ref name=anb /&gt; Although still not legally divorced from his first two wives, Harrison married Filomena Abela, a [[Malta|Maltese]] woman at [[Alexandria]] in 1920. However, the newlyweds could not find escape from the adventure that had followed Harrison all his life. Harrison and his new wife's train was ambushed by a band of [[Syria]]ns disillusioned with a group of politicians. The quick thinking of the recently thrice-married physician prevented his new wife's broken leg from developing into [[gangrene]].&lt;ref name=indiana /&gt;&lt;ref name=canada /&gt;&lt;ref name=tourism /&gt;

Still in charge of the Constantinople hospital, he attempted to elope with one of his patients, but was captured and tried for breach of conduct, as the female patient was in fact the wife of a [[Turkey|Turkish]] officer. While being deported to Canada, Harrison escaped while his ship was docked in [[Morocco]]. Making his way to [[Ireland]], Harrison posed as a [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] and joined the [[Irish Free State|Free State Army]]. After he was discovered, he quickly crossed to Wales to treat the coal miners there for [[silicosis]].&lt;ref name=canada/&gt; In 1923 Harrison married his fourth wife, Eva Olwen Bowen in [[Cardiff]], still without divorcing his three previous wives, and set off with her on an adventure in the [[Caribbean]]. It is thought that Harrison deserted her sometime in the mid-1920s.&lt;ref name=anb /&gt; During the 1930s Harrison worked in 15 countries and dependencies across Latin America and the Middle East. For one year, he served as the physician for a guerrilla army fighting the Japanese, who were then engaged in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] with China.&lt;ref name=indiana /&gt;&lt;ref name=canada/&gt;&lt;ref name=tourism /&gt; After 1938, Harrison traveled to [[Shanghai]] using borrowed funds from a medical school classmate in [[Jamaica]] and from his own brother in [[Ontario]], and set up a private medical practice, assisting the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Chinese Red Cross]] wherever possible.&lt;ref name=anb /&gt;

== World War II and beyond ==
Between 1941 and 1946, Harrison was the ship's doctor on board the ''Demodocus'', a steam liner ferrying supplies to Allied forces across the Indian Ocean. After the war, Harrison wanted to assist the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] (UNRRA), but had to falsify his records by subtracting seven years off his age to qualify for service. During this time, he served in China delivering much-needed supplies to a country devastated by the long Second Sino-Japanese War and once even saved the lives of 90&amp;nbsp;students by sheltering them from a [[Kuomintang]] officer. By donning an [[United States armed forces|American army]] officer's uniform, Harrison was able to convince the Kuomintang officer to not check a barge which held the students hidden inside.&lt;ref name=indiana/&gt;&lt;ref name=anb /&gt;&lt;ref name=tourism /&gt;

[[File:Tillson Harrison last journey map.svg|thumb|left|Last journey from [[Shanghai]] to [[Kaifeng]] in train then to [[Zhangqiu]] by truck]]
On December 4, 1946, Harrison set out from [[Shanghai]] with approximately 50 [[tonne]]s of supplies. On this train journey, he was to be accompanied by a Russian UNRRA worker and Chinese welfare representatives. Due to repeated [[Kuomintang]] inspections, the train journey constantly suffered from delays. The first such delay occurred at [[Nanjing]] and lasted four days; the second such delay, at [[Xuzhou]], was of equal duration. At one station, the medical supplies were unhooked from the train's engine car and left on a bleak plain. The two UNRRA workers did not have clean water to drink and were forced to boil ditch water which was polluted with human waste. To add to the dire situation, Harrison's blanket and shoes were stolen, and due to the cold, he began to suffer from frostbite. Two weeks after Harrison left Shanghai, his train was permitted to move again, but there were problems still ahead. At each one of the 20 stations en route to [[Kaifeng]], the train was delayed for up to three hours. Upon arrival at Kaifeng, the journey had to be completed by truck and ox cart. After completing one delivery, he returned to Kaifeng to pick up a second load, but could not continue past the [[Zhangqiu]] branch of the receiving hospital.&lt;ref name=picrender /&gt; Harrison died of [[Hypothermia|exposure]] on January 10, 1947, near [[Kaifeng]] in China, aged 66.&lt;ref name=anb /&gt;&lt;ref name=canada /&gt;&lt;ref name=tourism /&gt;

By the end of his life, Tillson Harrison could speak no less than six different languages, had participated in seven wars and, although this was not discovered for several years after his death, was married to four women at the same time.&lt;ref name=indiana /&gt;&lt;ref name=anb /&gt;

While he is virtually unknown in Canada, Harrison is widely honored in China. A statue in his likeness stands tall in [[Shanghai]], his burial site at an Anglican compound in Kaifeng is home to the Dr. Tillson Harrison Memorial School, and the Harrison International Peace Hospital in [[Hengshui]] treats approximately 800&amp;nbsp;outpatients every day.&lt;ref name=indiana /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transformingfaces.org/partners-projects/asia/#2 |title=Partners and Projects: Hengshui, China |author=Transforming Faces Worldwide |year=2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=February 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231033136/http://www.transformingfaces.org/partners-projects/asia#2 |archivedate=December 31, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of Tillsonburg, Ontario (named for Harrison's great-grandfather) maintains a lasting relationship with the hospital, which was renamed as such from the previous name of Handan International Peace Hospital in 1947.&lt;ref name=picrender /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Brian Mulroney]], sent a commemorative letter to the Chinese ambassador to mark the centenary of Harrison's birth. However at that time it was not made clear that Harrison had falsified his age when enlisting in the UNRRA, and the celebrations took place seven years after the actual centenary.&lt;ref name=canada /&gt; The same year, Harrison's remains were re-interred in a large tomb in a public ceremony, which many Canadians were invited to attend.&lt;ref name=picrender&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purden|first1=Carolyn|date=August 15, 1988|title=Another Canadian MD joins Bethune as Chinese hero|journal=[[Canadian Medical Association]] Journal|volume=139|pages=336–337|url=http://ukpmc.ac.uk/picrender.cgi?artid=570369&amp;blobtype=pdf|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224001606/http://ukpmc.ac.uk/picrender.cgi?artid=570369&amp;blobtype=pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 24, 2012|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Harrison's daughter, Rosalind, several decades after her father's death, film producers [[George Lucas]] and [[Steven Spielberg]] contacted her, and in a series of interviews, Rosalind provided an account of her father's illustrious life. This, she claims, became the inspiration for the highly successful ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' film series.&lt;ref name=indiana /&gt; In recent times, Harrison was the subject of a five-part [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]] [[Morningside (radio program)|Morningside]] dramatization of his life, written by [[Antanas Sileika]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:Turmite-120121010011-8342.png|frame|right|204px|A 2-state 2-color turmite on a square grid. Starting from an empty grid, after 8342 steps the turmite (a red pixel) has exhibited both chaotic and regular movement phases.]]

In [[computer science]], a '''turmite''' is a [[Turing machine]] which has an orientation as well as a current state and a "tape" that consists of an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells. The terms '''ant''' and '''vant''' are also used. [[Langton's ant]] is a well-known type of turmite defined on the cells of a square grid. [[Paterson's worms]] are a type of turmite defined on the edges of an [[Triangular tiling|isometric grid]].

It has been shown that turmites in general are exactly equivalent in power to one-dimensional Turing machines with an infinite tape, as either can simulate the other.

== History ==

[[Langton's ant]]s were invented in 1986 and declared "equivalent to Turing machines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0167-2789(86)90237-X | last = Langton | first = Chris G. | title = Studying artificial life with cellular automata | year = 1986 | journal = Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena | volume = 22 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 120–149 | hdl = 2027.42/26022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independently, in 1988, Allen H. Brady considered the idea of two-dimensional Turing machines with an orientation and called them "TurNing machines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Universal Turing Machine: A Half-Century Survey | last=Brady | first=Allen H. | chapter=The Busy Beaver Game and the Meaning of Life | editor=Rolf Herken | year=1988 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | isbn=0-19-853741-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brady95"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Universal Turing Machine: A Half-Century Survey | edition=2nd | last=Brady | first=Allen H. | chapter=The Busy Beaver Game and the Meaning of Life | editor=Rolf Herken|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=YafIDVd1Z68C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=MZUbd8ijxj&amp;dq=universal%20turing%20machine%20herken&amp;pg=PA237#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false | year=1995 | pages=237–254 | publisher=Springer-Verlag | isbn=3-211-82637-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently independently of both of these,&lt;ref name="rucker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rucker|first=Rudy|title=Artificial Life Lab|url=http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~rucker/bopbook.htm|accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greg Turk]] investigated the same kind of system and wrote to [[Alexander Dewdney|A. K. Dewdney]] about them. A. K. Dewdney named them "tur-mites" in his "Computer Recreations" column in [[Scientific American]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dewdney|first=A. K. | title=Computer Recreations: Two-dimensional Turing machines and Turmites make tracks on a plane | journal = Scientific American |date=September 1989 | pages=180–183 |volume=261 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-180}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rudy Rucker]] relates the story as follows:

{{quote|Dewdney reports that, casting about for a name for Turk's creatures, he thought, "Well, they're Turing machines studied by Turk, so they should be tur-something. And they're like little insects, or mites, so I'll call them tur-mites! And that sounds like termites!" With the kind permission of Turk and Dewdney, I'm going to leave out the hyphen, and call them turmites.|Rudy Rucker|Artificial Life Lab&lt;ref name="rucker" /&gt;}}

== Relative vs. absolute turmites ==

Turmites can be categorised as being either ''relative'' or ''absolute''. Relative turmites, alternatively known as "Turning machines", have an internal orientation. [[Langton's Ant]] is such an example. Relative turmites are, by definition, [[isotropic]]; rotating the turmite does not affect its outcome. Relative turmites are so named because the directions are encoded ''relative'' to the current orientation, equivalent to using the words "left" or "backwards". Absolute turmites, by comparison, encode their directions in absolute terms: a particular instruction may direct the turmite to move "North". Absolute turmites are two-dimensional analogues of conventional Turing machines, so are occasionally referred to as simply "Two-dimensional Turing machines". The remainder of this article is concerned with the relative case.

== Specification ==
The following specification is specific to turmites on a two-dimensional square grid, the most studied type of turmite. Turmites on other grids can be specified in a similar fashion.

As with Langton's ant, turmites perform the following operations each timestep:

# turn on the spot (by some multiple of 90°)
# change the color of the square
# move forward one square.

As with Turing machines, the actions are specified by a [[state transition table]] listing the current internal state of the turmite and the color of the cell it is currently standing on. For example, the turmite shown in the image at the top of this page is specified by the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
! rowspan="3" colspan="2" |
! colspan="6" | Current color
|-
! colspan="3" | 0
! colspan="3" | 1
|- style="font-size:9pt"
! Write color
! Turn
! Next state
! Write color
! Turn
! Next state
|-
! rowspan="2" | Current state
! 0
| 1
| R
| 0
| 1
| R
| 1
|-
! 1
| 0
| N
| 0
| 0
| N
| 1
|}

The direction to turn is one of '''L''' (90° left), '''R''' (90° right), '''N''' (no turn) and '''U''' (180° [[U-turn]]).

== Examples ==

&lt;gallery caption="Examples of 2-state 2-color turmites and one 3-state turmite on a [[square tiling|square grid]], all starting from an empty configuration:"&gt;

File:Turmite_Snowflake.jpg|3-state turmite producing a snowflake-like [[fractal]] pattern.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Starting from an empty grid or other configurations, the most commonly observed behaviours are chaotic growth, spiral growth and 'highway' construction. Rare examples become periodic after a certain number of steps.

== Busy Beaver game ==

Allen H. Brady searched for terminating turmites (the equivalent of [[Busy Beaver|busy beavers]]) and found a 2-state 2-color machine that printed 37 1's before halting, and another that took 121 steps before halting.&lt;ref name="Brady95" /&gt; He also considered turmites that move on a [[Triangular tiling|triangular grid]], finding several busy beavers here too.

[[Ed Pegg, Jr.]] considered another approach to the busy beaver game. He suggested turmites that can turn for example ''both'' left and right, splitting in two. Turmites that later meet annihilate each other. In this system, a Busy Beaver is one that from a starting pattern of a single turmite lasts the longest before all the turmites annihilate each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Pegg, Jr. | first = Ed | title = Math Puzzle | url=http://www.mathpuzzle.com/26Mar03.html | accessdate = 15 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other grids ==

Following Allen H. Brady's initial work of turmites on a triangular grid, [[hexagonal tiling]]s have also been explored. Much of this work is due to Tim Hutton, and his results are on the Rule Table Repository. He has also considered Turmites in three dimensions, and collected some preliminary results. Allen H. Brady and Tim Hutton have also investigated one-dimensional relative turmites on the [[integer lattice]], which Brady termed ''flippers''. (One-dimensional ''absolute'' turmites are of course simply known as Turing machines.)

'''The UN Counter-Terrorism Office''' was approved in a resolution on June 15, 2017 with the consensus of the 193-nation [[UN General Assembly]]. The creation of the office was also welcomed by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] [[António Guterres]]' initiative to transfer relevant functions out of the UN [[Department of Political Affairs]] (DPA) and into the new United Nations Office of [[Counter-Terrorism]].&lt;ref name="un"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/counterterrorism/ctitf/en/general-assembly-approves-creation-new-un-counter-terrorism-office|title=General Assembly approves creation of new UN Counter-Terrorism Office &amp;#124; Counter-Terrorism Implementation Task Force|website=un.org|accessdate=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Chief UN spokesman [[Stephane Dujarric]], the secretary-general welcomed the adoption of the General Assembly resolution "which endorsed his proposal to establish a new UN Office of Counter-Terrorism."
"The Secretary-General considers counter-terrorism and prevention of [[violent extremism]] to be one of the highest priorities of the [[United Nations]] to address a growing threat to international peace and security," Dujarric said.
"He therefore hopes that this reform of the UN Counter-Terrorism architecture will contribute to the UN's broader efforts to promote conflict prevention, sustainable peace and development”, he added.&lt;ref name="un2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/counterterrorism/|website=un.org|title=United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism|accessdate=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vaginal melanoma''' is a rare [[malignancy]] that originates from [[Melanocyte|melanocytes]] in the [[vaginal epithelium]]. It is also known as a [[melanocytic tumor]] or as a malignant [[melanoma]].&lt;ref name="atlas"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vulva and Vagina tumors: an overview|url=http://atlasgeneticsoncology.org/Tumors/VulVaginaCarcID5274.html|website=atlasgeneticsoncology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is aggressive and infrequently cured. The five year survival rate is approximately 21%.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  It was first described in  1887 and only 500 cases are found in current literature.  Vaginal melanoma is 3% of all [[Vaginal cancer|vaginal cancers]] and only 0.3% of all melanomas. When the neoplasm is discovered it has already become invasive and prognosis is poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kalampokas E, Kalampokas T, Damaskos C | title = Primary Vaginal Melanoma, A Rare and Aggressive Entity.

==Presentation==
This cancer most often develops on the lowest third of the vagina. It is darkly pigmented and of an irregular shape. Melanoma of the vagina can be as large as severally centimeters in size.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
==Histology==
When the tissue is assessed, the histological characteristics include: 
* the shape of the cells appear similar to epithelial and spindle-shaped
* the growth occurs in the shapes of sheets and nests
* the presence of [[melanin]] in the cells
* the nucleus of the cells is large and abnormal&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

{{War}}

'''War''' is a state of armed conflict between [[State (polity)|states]], [[government]]s, [[Society|societies]] and informal [[paramilitary]] groups, such as [[mercenaries]], [[insurgent]]s and [[militia]]s. It is generally characterized by extreme [[violence]], [[aggression]], destruction, and mortality, using [[Regular army|regular]] or [[Irregular military|irregular]] [[military forces]]. '''Warfare''' refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Warfare|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/warfare|website=Cambridge Dictionary|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Total war]] is warfare that is not restricted to purely [[legitimate military target]]s, and can result in massive [[civilian casualties|civilian]] or other [[non-combatant]] suffering and [[Casualty (person)|casualties]].

The [[war studies|scholarly study of war]] is sometimes called polemology ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɒ|l|ə|ˈ|m|ɒ|l|ə|dʒ|i}} {{Respell|POL|ə|MOL|ə|jee}}), from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''polemos'', meaning "war", and ''[[-logy]]'', meaning "the study of".

While some scholars see war as a universal and ancestral aspect of [[human nature]],&lt;ref&gt;Šmihula, Daniel (2013): ''The Use of Force in International Relations'',  p. 67, {{ISBN|978-80-224-1341-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural or ecological circumstances.&lt;ref name="Sage Publications"&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2006 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Friedman | first2= Jonathan | title= Globalization and Violence, Vol. 3: Globalizing War and Intervention | url= https://www.academia.edu/3587732 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Gari-Melchers-War-Highsmith.jpeg|thumb|right|upright=1.6|Mural of War (1896), by [[Gari Melchers]]]]
The English word ''war'' derives from the late [[Old English]] (circa.1050) words ''wyrre'' and ''werre'', from [[Old French]] ''werre'' (also ''guerre'' as in modern French), in turn from the [[Franks|Frankish]] *''werra'', ultimately deriving from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *''werzō'' 'mixture, confusion'. The word is related to the [[Old Saxon]] ''werran'', [[Old High German]] ''werran'', and the German ''verwirren'', meaning “to confuse”, “to perplex”, and “to bring into confusion”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=war |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=war |year=2010 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
{{Main|Outline of war#Types of war|l1=Types of war}}

War must entail some degree of confrontation using weapons and other [[military technology and equipment]] by armed forces employing [[military tactics]] and [[operational art]] within a broad [[military strategy]] subject to [[military logistics]]. Studies of war by military theorists throughout [[military history]] have sought to identify the [[philosophy of war]], and to reduce it to a [[military science]]. Modern military science considers several factors before a [[Defence policy|national defence policy]] is created to allow a war to commence: the environment in the area(s) of combat operations, the posture national forces will adopt on the commencement of a war, and the type of warfare troops will be engaged in.
* [[Asymmetric warfare]] is a conflict between [[belligerent]]s of drastically different levels of military capability and/or size.
* [[Biological warfare]], or germ warfare, is the use of weaponized biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi.
* [[Chemical warfare]] involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat. Poison gas as a [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapon]] was principally used during [[World War I]], and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more than 100,000 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents, Second Edition |author=D. Hank Ellison |date=August 24, 2007 |pages=567–70 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-0-8493-1434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Guernica]] (1937). The [[Spanish Civil War]] was one of Europe's bloodiest and most brutal civil wars.]]
* [[Civil war]] is a war between forces belonging to the same nation or political entity.
* [[Conventional warfare]] is declared war between states in which [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]], [[biological weapon|biological]], or [[chemical weapons]] are not used or see limited deployment.
* [[Cyberwarfare]] involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's information systems.
* [[Insurgency]] is a rebellion against authority, when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents (lawful combatants). An insurgency can be fought via counter-insurgency warfare, and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population, and by political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents' claims against the incumbent regime.
* [[Information warfare]] is the application of destructive force on a large scale against information assets and systems, against the [[computer]]s and [[Computer network|networks]] that support the four critical infrastructures (the power grid, communications, financial, and transportation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/eprint/snyder/infowarfare.htm |title=Information Warfare |last=Lewis |first=Brian C. |date= |website=Federation of American Scientist |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970617035106/http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/snyder/infowarfare.htm |archive-date=17 June 1997 |dead-url=yes |access-date=27 Feb 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nuclear warfare]] is warfare in which [[nuclear weapon]]s are the primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation.
* [[Total war]] is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the [[laws of war]], placing no limits on [[legitimate military target]]s, using [[weapon]]s and [[Military tactics|tactics]] resulting in significant [[civilian casualties]], or demanding a [[war effort]] requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian population.
* [[Unconventional warfare]], the opposite of conventional warfare, is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict.
* [[War of aggression]] is a war for conquest or gain rather than self-defense; this can be the basis of [[war crime]]s under [[customary international law]].
* [[War of liberation]], Wars of national liberation or national liberation revolutions are conflicts fought by nations to gain independence. The term is used in conjunction with wars against foreign powers (or at least those perceived as foreign) to establish separate sovereign states for the rebelling nationality. From a different point of view, these wars are called insurgencies, rebellions, or wars of independence.

[[File:War deaths caused by warfare.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|The percentages of men killed in war in eight tribal societies, and Europe and the U.S. in the 20th century. (Lawrence H. Keeley, archeologist)]]
The earliest recorded evidence of war belongs to the Mesolithic cemetery [[Site 117]], which has been determined to be approximately 14,000 years old. About forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent death.&lt;ref name="Keeley page 37"&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H: ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage''. p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the rise of the [[State (polity)|state]] some 5,000 years ago,&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared, ''Guns, Germs and Steel''&lt;/ref&gt; military activity has occurred over much of the globe. The advent of [[gunpowder]] and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare. According to Conway W. Henderson, ''"One source claims that 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3.5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20)."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conway W. Henderson|title=Understanding International Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AwMovLqKw2oC&amp;pg=PA212|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=9 February 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-9764-9|pages=212–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An unfavorable review of this estimate&lt;ref&gt;B. Jongman &amp; J.M.G. van der Dennen, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150415132823/http://rint.rechten.rug.nl/rth/dennen/hoax.htm 'The Great "War Figures" Hoax: an investigation in polemomythology']&lt;/ref&gt; mentions the following regarding one of the proponents of this estimate: "In addition, perhaps feeling that the war casualties figure was improbably high, he changed "approximately 3,640,000,000 human beings have been killed by war or the diseases produced by war" to "approximately 1,240,000,000 human beings...&amp;c."" The lower figure is more plausible,&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Muehlenkamp, [http://holocaustcontroversies.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/germs-vs-guns-or-death-from-mass.html 'Germs vs. guns, or death from mass violence in perspective']&lt;/ref&gt; but could also be on the high side, considering that the 100 deadliest acts of mass violence between 480 BCE and 2002 CE (wars and other man-made disasters with at least 300,000 and up to 66 million victims) claimed about 455 million human lives in total.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew White, ''Atrocitology: Humanity's 100 Deadliest Achievements'', Canongate Books Ltd. (20 October 2011), {{ISBN|0857861220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primitive warfare is estimated to have accounted for 15.1 % of deaths and claimed 400 million victims.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew White, [http://necrometrics.com/pre1700b.htm#Primitive 'Primitive War']&lt;/ref&gt; Added to the aforementioned (and perhaps too high) figure of 1,240 million between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, this would mean a total of 1,640,000,000 people killed by war (including deaths from famine and disease caused by war) throughout the history and pre-history of mankind. For comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died from infectious diseases in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;David McCandless, [http://www.informationisbeautiful.net/visualizations/20th-century-death '20th Century Death']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nuclear warfare]] breaking out in August 1988, when nuclear arsenals were at peak level, and the aftermath thereof, could have reduced human population from 5,150,000,000 by 1,850,000,000 to 3,300,000,000 within a period of about one year, according to a projection that did not consider "the most severe predictions concerning [[nuclear winter]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wm. Robert Johnston, [http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/nuclear/nuclearwar1.html 'The Effects of a Global Thermonuclear War']&lt;/ref&gt; This would have been a proportional reduction of the world’s population exceeding the reduction caused in the 14th century by the [[Black Death]], and comparable in proportional terms with the plague’s impact on Europe's population in 1346–53.

In ''[[War Before Civilization]]'', Lawrence H. Keeley, a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]], says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |title=Review: War Before Civilization |publisher=Brneurosci.org |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=2011-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121021158/http://brneurosci.org/reviews/war.html |archivedate=21 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and many fought constantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/HG04Aa02.html|title=The fraud of primitive authenticity|last=Spengler|date=4 July 2006|work=Asia Times Online|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres. All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Debra L., Ryan P. Harrod, and Ventura R. Pérez, eds. 2012. ''The Bioarchaeology of Violence''. Gainesville: University Press of Florida. http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=MARTI002&lt;/ref&gt; Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training. Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids.&lt;ref name="Keeley page 55"&gt;Keeley, Lawrence H: ''War Before Civilization: The Myth of the Peaceful Savage''. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Rubinstein]] wrote "Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty...'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [i.e., after the coming of the Europeans].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=W. D. Rubinstein|title=Genocide: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nMMAk4VwLLwC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2004|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=978-0-582-50601-5|pages=22–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MokoShuraiE-Kotoba IV.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|Japanese [[samurai]] attacking a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ship, 13th century]]
In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place.&lt;ref name="War"&gt;[http://www.ralphmag.org/CG/world-war-one2.html World War One – A New Kind of War | Part II], From ''14 – 18 Understanding the Great War'', by Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;/ref&gt; During the 20th century, war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of the Left as a force to be reckoned with.&lt;ref name = "Kolko 1994 xviitoxviii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Kolko|1994|p=xvii–xviii}}: "War in this century became an essential precondition for the emergence of a numerically powerful Left, moving it from the margins to the very center of European politics during 1917–18 and of all world affairs after 1941".&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent rapid increases in the technologies of war, and therefore in its destructiveness (see [[mutual assured destruction]]), have caused widespread public concern, and have in all probability forestalled, and may altogether prevent the outbreak of a nuclear [[World War III]]. At the end of each of the last two World Wars, concerted and popular efforts were made to come to a greater understanding of the underlying dynamics of war and to thereby hopefully reduce or even eliminate it altogether. These efforts materialized in the forms of the [[League of Nations]], and its successor, the United Nations.

In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed [[atom bomb]], [[Albert Einstein]] famously stated, "I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."&lt;ref name="EinsteinWWIV"&gt;{{cite web|year=1947 |url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/action/urgent-actions/einstein/ |title=Albert Einstein: Man of Imagination |accessdate=2010-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604080636/http://www.wagingpeace.org/menu/action/urgent-actions/einstein/ |archivedate=4 June 2010 }} Nuclear Age Peace Foundation paper
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mao Zedong]] urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if "half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Instant Wisdom: Beyond the Little Red Book |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946612-2,00.html |date= 20 September 1976 |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate= 14 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Human Security Report 2005]] documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the [[Cold War]] in the early 1990s. However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's "Peace and Conflict" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts had stalled.&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, Joseph, J.

Human history had numerous wars coming and going, but the average number of people dying from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people dying per 100,000. However, major wars over shorter periods have resulted in much higher casualty rates, with 100-200 casualties per 100,000 over a few years. While conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not generally true. For instance, the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648) had about the same number of casualties per capita as [[World War I]], although it was higher during [[World War II]] (WWII). That said, overall the number of casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times. Quite to the contrary, on a global scale the time since WWII has been unusually peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ourworldindata.org/war-and-peace/|title=War and Peace|work=Our World in Data|access-date=2017-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Largest by death toll===
{{Main|List of wars by death toll|Outline of war#Wars}}
The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is [[World War II]], from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the [[Mongol conquests]]&lt;ref&gt;*The Cambridge History of China: Alien regimes and border states, 907–1368, 1994, p. 622, cited by White

As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in [[modern history]] may have been the [[Paraguayan War]] (see [[Paraguayan War casualties]]).

Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century. These are the two World Wars, followed by the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (which is sometimes considered part of [[World War II]], or as overlapping). Most of the others involved China or neighboring peoples. The death toll of World War II, being over 60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls.&lt;ref name="users.erols"&gt;McFarlane, Alan: ''The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap'', Blackwell 2003, {{ISBN|0-631-18117-2}},

===On military personnel===
[[Military personnel]] subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], disease, injury, and death.

{{Quote|In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire.|''No More Heroes'', Richard Gabriel&lt;ref name="War"/&gt;}}

During World War II, research conducted by [[US Army]] [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[S.L.A. Marshall]] found, on average, 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lt. Col. Dave Grossman|title=On Killing – The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War &amp; Society|publisher= Little, Brown &amp; Co., |year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Civil War Collector’s Encyclopedia, F.A. Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times. These studies suggest most military personnel resist firing their weapons in combat, that – as some theorists argue – human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt; Swank and Marchand’s WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties. Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;

{{Quote|One-tenth of mobilised American men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees.|''14–18: Understanding the Great War'', Stéphane Audoin-Rouzeau, Annette Becker&lt;ref name="War"/&gt;}}

[[File:800px-Apotheosis.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[The Apotheosis of War]]'' (1871) by [[Vasily Vereshchagin]]]]
Additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam war veterans suffered from [[Post Traumatic Stress Disorder]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"/&gt;

Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43 died in the [[American Civil War]], including about 6% in the North and approximately 18% in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maris Vinovskis|title=Toward a Social History of the American Civil War: Exploratory Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9D4TAwc93VoC|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=28 September 1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39559-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 military personnel. [[United States military casualties of war]] since 1775 have totaled over two million. Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilized in [[World War I]], 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, Martin (2000), ''[http://www.jimmyatkinson.com/papers/versaillestreaty.html#endnotes The Treaty of Versailles and its Consequences] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512224100/http://www.jimmyatkinson.com/papers/versaillestreaty.html |date=12 May 2008 }}'', New York: Longman&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DeadCrowIndians1874.jpg|thumb|left|The remains of dead [[Crow Indians]] killed and scalped by Sioux c. 1874]]
During [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]]'s retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died of [[typhus]] than were killed by the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5lHkenkBs?url=http://entomology.montana.edu/historybug/TYPHUS-Conlon.pdf The Historical Impact of Epidemic Typhus]. Joseph M. Conlon.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 450,000 soldiers who crossed the [[Neman River|Neman]] on 25 June 1812, less than 40,000 returned. More military personnel were killed from 1500–1914 by typhus than from military action.&lt;ref name="TIME Magazine 1940"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,794989,00.html War and Pestilence]. ''TIME''.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, if it were not for modern medical advances there would be thousands more dead from disease and infection. For instance, during the [[Seven Years' War]], the [[Royal Navy]] reported it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 died of disease or were 'missing'.&lt;ref&gt;A. S. Turberville (2006). ''Johnson's England: An Account of the Life &amp; Manners of His Age''. p. 53. {{ISBN|1-4067-2726-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that between 1985 and 1994, 378,000 people per year died due to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Obermeyer Z, Murray CJ, Gakidou E |title=Fifty years of violent war deaths from Vietnam to Bosnia: analysis of data from the world health survey programme |journal=BMJ |volume=336 |issue=7659 |pages=1482–86 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18566045 |pmc=2440905 |doi=10.1136/bmj.a137 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On civilians===
{{see also|Civilian casualties}}
[[File:The Hanging by Jacques Callot.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Les Grandes Misères de la guerre]]'' depict the destruction unleashed on civilians during the [[Thirty Years' War]].]]
Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to [[famine]], disease, and death in the [[civilian]] [[population]]). During the [[Thirty Years' War]] in Europe, the population of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was reduced by 15 to 40 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://necrometrics.com/pre1700a.htm#30YrW The Thirty Years War (1618–48)], Alan McFarlane, The Savage Wars of Peace: England, Japan and the Malthusian Trap (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe – Demographics]. Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as [[genocide]], while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war.

Most estimates of [[World War II casualties]] indicate around 60 million people died, 40 million of which were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World War II Fatalities|url=http://www.secondworldwar.co.uk/casualty.html|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deaths in the [[Soviet Union]] were around [[World War II casualties of the Soviet Union|27 million]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4530565.stm|title=Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead | date=9 May 2005 | accessdate=6 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Geoffrey A. |last=Hosking|title=Rulers And Victims: The Russians in the Soviet Union|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDMVMqDvp4QC&amp;pg=PA242|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2006|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-02178-5|pages=242–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the economy===
{{see also|Military Keynesianism}}

Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay [[war reparations]] to the victorious nations. In certain cases, land is ceded to the victorious nations. For example, the territory of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons. Some economists{{who|date=July 2016}} believe war can stimulate a country's economy (high government spending for World War II is often credited with bringing the U.S. out of the [[Great Depression]] by most [[Keynesian]] economists) but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the [[Franco-Prussian War]], and [[World War I]], warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved. For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gatrell|first1=Peter|title=Russia's First World War : A Social and Economic History|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|location=Hoboken, N.J.|isbn=9781317881391|page=270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
[[File:Cyprian War.jpg|thumb|upright=.75|Ruins of [[Warsaw]]'s Napoleon Square in the aftermath of [[World War II]]]]
[[World War II]] was the most financially costly conflict in history; its belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.S. dollars on the [[war effort]] (as adjusted to 1940 prices).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mayer |first=E. |date=2000 |url= http://emayzine.com/lectures/WWII.html |title=World War II course lecture notes|website=Emayzine.com |location=Victorville, California |publisher=Victor Valley College |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301155526/http://emayzine.com/lectures/WWII.html |archivedate=1 March 2009 |accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, P.

The [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/depwwii/depwar.html |title= Great Depression and World War II, 1929–1945 |publisher=Library of Congress |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012023043/http://memory.loc.gov/learn/features/timeline/depwwii/depwar.html |archivedate=12 October 2007 |accessdate=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the war, 70% of European industrial infrastructure was destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink1=Marc Pilisuk|author1=Marc Pilisuk|author2=Jennifer Achord Rountree|title=Who Benefits from Global Violence and War: Uncovering a Destructive System|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9kNZrmG0E8C&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=31 May 2012|year=2008|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99435-8|pages=136–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Axis invasion]] was estimated at a value of 679 billion rubles. The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, {{convert|40000|mi|0|abbr=on}} of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1946, Volume 95, Number 32158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===On the arts===
War leads to [[forced migration]] causing potentially large displacements of population. Among forced migrants there are usually relatively large shares of artists and other types of creative people, causing so the war effects to be particularly harmful for the country’s creative potential in the long-run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jan Borowiecki | first1 = Karol | year = 2012 | title = Are composers different?

In war, cultural institutions, such as libraries, can become "targets in themselves; their elimination was a way to denigrate and demoralize the enemy population." The impact such destruction can have on a society is important because "in an era in which competing ideologies fuel internal and international conflict, the destruction of libraries and other items of cultural significance is neither random nor irrelevant. Preserving the world’s repositories of knowledge is crucial to ensuring that the darkest moments of history do not endlessly repeat themselves."&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, K. (2007). [Burning Books and Leveling Libraries]. Harvard Human Rights Journal, 203 51-353&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==

Entities deliberately contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate ''war aims'' as an evaluation/propaganda tool. War aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Classification ===

Tangible/intangible aims:
* Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of territory (as in the German goal of [[Lebensraum]] in the first half of the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]]).
* Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or reputation&lt;ref&gt;
Welch distinguishes: "tangible goods such as arms, wealth, and – provided they are strategically or economically valuable – territory and resources" from "intangible goods such as credibility and reputation" – {{cite book

==Limiting and stopping==

{{main|Anti-war movement}}
{{See also|Aestheticization of violence}}

Religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the [[Second Vatican Council]] document ''Gaudiem et Spes'': "Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against God and man himself. It merits unequivocal and unhesitating condemnation."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_cons_19651207_gaudium-et-spes_en.html PASTORAL CONSTITUTION ON THE CHURCH IN THE MODERN WORLD GAUDIUM ET SPES PROMULGATED BY HIS HOLINESS, POPE PAUL VI ON DECEMBER 7, 1965]"&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the United States [[War in Afghanistan (2001–14)|invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq War|Iraq]]. Protests [[Opposition to the War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|opposing the War in Afghanistan]] occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Organizations like [[Stop the War Coalition]], based in the United Kingdom, worked on campaigning against the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stop the War Coalition: Timeline of Events 2001–2011 |url=http://stopwar.org.uk/index.php/about/timeline-of-stop-the-war-events-2001-2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530053507/http://www.stopwar.org.uk/index.php/about/timeline-of-stop-the-war-events-2001-2011 |archivedate=30 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mexican Drug War]], with estimated casualties of 40,000 since December 2006, has recently faced fundamental opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How many have died in Mexico's drug war? |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/laplaza/2011/06/mexico-war-dead-update-figures-40000.html|date=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the movement for peace and justice has started a popular middle-class movement against the war. It won the recognition of President Calderon, who began war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Calderon apologizes to drug war victims |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2011/06/20116244495608277.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of motivation==
[[File:Szigetvar 1566.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[List of campaigns of Suleiman the Magnificent|Ottoman campaign]] for territorial [[Ottoman wars in Europe|expansion in Europe]] in 1566]]
There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus about which are most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levy |first=Jack S. |year=1989 |title=The Causes of War: A Review of Theories and Evidence |journal=Behavior, Society and Nuclear War |volume=I |page=295 |editor1-first=Philip E. |editor1-last=Tetlock |editor2-first=Jo L. |editor2-last=Husbands |editor3-first=Robert |editor3-last=Jervis |editor4-first=Paul C. |editor4-last=Stern |editor5-first=Charles |editor5-last=Tilly |accessdate=4 May 2012 |url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1989%20Causes%20of%20War.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922150721/http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1989%20Causes%20of%20War.pdf |archivedate=22 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl von Clausewitz]] said, 'Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions.'&lt;ref&gt;Clausewitz, Carl Von (1976), ''On War'' (Princeton University Press) p. 593&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychoanalytic===
Dutch psychoanalyst [[Joost Meerloo]] held that, "War is often...a mass discharge of accumulated internal rage (where)...the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction."&lt;ref name = "meerloo"&gt;
| A. M. Meerloo, M.D. ''The Rape of the Mind'' (2009) p. 134, Progressive Press, {{ISBN|978-1-61577-376-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Thus war can sometimes be a means by which man's own frustration at his inability to master his own self is expressed and temporarily relieved via his unleashing of destructive behavior upon ''others.'' In this destructive scenario, these ''others'' are made to serve as the scapegoat of unspoken and subconscious frustrations and fears.

Other psychoanalysts such as E.F.M. Durban and [[John Bowlby]] have argued human beings are [[Inheritance|inherently]] violent.&lt;ref&gt;Durbin, E.F.L. and John Bowlby. ''Personal Aggressiveness and War'' 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; This aggressiveness is fueled by [[displacement (psychology)|displacement]] and [[Psychological projection|projection]] where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other [[race (human classification)|races]], religions, nations or [[Ideology|ideologies]]. By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.

The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of [[Melanie Klein]], thought war was the paranoid or projective “elaboration” of mourning.&lt;ref&gt;(Fornari 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our “love need”: our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her. For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare. Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.

Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace.&lt;ref&gt;Blanning, T.C.W. "The Origin of Great Wars." ''The Origins of the French Revolutionary Wars.'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers. One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Maurice N. ''War and the Human Race.'' 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power. War is caused by leaders who seek war such as [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.

{{Quotation|Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood. But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship. ... the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.|

===Evolutionary===

[[File:Aftermath Battle of Triboltingen.jpg|thumb|Women and priests retrieve the dead bodies of Swabian soldiers just outside the city gates of Constance after the [[battle of Schwaderloh]]. ''([[Luzerner Schilling]])'']]
Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare. There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and [[competition]] over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Meyer. Social Evolution in Franz M. Wuketits and Christoph Antweiler (eds.) Handbook of Evolution The Evolution of Human Societies and Cultures Wiley-VCH Verlag&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as [[chimpanzee]]s,&lt;ref name = "ApesWar"&gt;{{cite news

Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states.&lt;ref&gt;Johan M.G. van der Dennen. 1995. ''The Origin of War: Evolution of a Male-Coalitional Reproductive Strategy''. Origin Press, Groningen, 1995 chapters 1 &amp; 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and linguist [[Steven Pinker]] argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Pinker |url=http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |title=Steven Pinker – Books – The Blank Slate |publisher=Pinker.wjh.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510091413/http://pinker.wjh.harvard.edu/books/tbs/index.html |archivedate=2011-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=July 2016}}  He also argued that in order to have credible [[deterrence theory|deterrence]] against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for [[revenge]] as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation ("[[honor]]").{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which "coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups", is a characteristic of most human societies. Those in which it has been lacking "tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors".&lt;ref name="HumanPrimateAggression"&gt;''Mind the Gap: Tracing the Origins of Human Universals'' By Peter M. Kappeler, Joan B. Silk, 2009, Chapter 8, "Intergroup Aggression in Primates and Humans; The Case for a Unified Theory", Margaret C. Crofoot and Richard W. Wrangham&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ashley Montagu]] strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare. Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.&lt;ref&gt;Montagu, Ashley (1976), ''The Nature of Human Aggression'' (Oxford University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.g. the [[Chewong]] and [[Semai people|Semai]] of the Malay peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Signe and Roy Willis, eds. (1989) ''Societies at Peace: Anthropological Perspectives''. London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Bobbi S. Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sitemaker.umich.edu/eugene.burnstein/files/35._low_93_evolutionaryperspective_war.pdf "An Evolutionary Perspective on War"], Bobbi S.

===Economic===
[[File:Disabled Iraqi T-54A, T-55, Type 59 or Type 69 tank and burning Kuwaiti oil field.jpg|thumb|Kuwaiti [[oil well]]s on fire, during the [[Gulf War]], 1 March 1991]]
War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system. In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for [[natural resource]]s and for wealth. War has also been linked to [[economic development]] by economic historians and development economists studying [[state-building]] and [[fiscal capacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Noel D.|last2=Koyama|first2=Mark|date=2015|title=States and Economic Growth: Capacity and Constraints|url=https://www.dropbox.com/s/md0bpim4r69d5eq/State%20Capacity%20Survey%2010-5-15%20Draft.pdf?dl=0|journal=George Mason University WORKING PAPER|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars. There are those on the extreme [[right (politics)|right]] of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Griffin]] and Matthew Feldman, eds., ''Fascism: Fascism and Culture'', New York: [[Routledge]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Mike. ''[[Social Darwinism]] in European and American Thought, 1860–1945: Nature as Model and Nature as Threat'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including [[Presidents of the United States]] and U.S. [[General officer|Generals]], expressed support for an economic view of war.

===Marxist===
The [[Marxism|Marxist]] theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great ([[Imperialism|imperialist]]) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the [[free market]] and [[Social class|class system]]. Part of the theory is that war will disappear once a [[world revolution]], over-throwing free markets and class systems, has occurred. Marxist philosopher [[Rosa Luxemburg]] theorized that [[imperialism]] was the result of capitalist countries needing new [[Market (economics)|markets]]. Expansion of the [[means of production]] is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in [[consumer demand]]. Since the workers in a [[capitalist economy]] would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/mandel/1955/08/imp-crit.html |title=The Marxist Theory of Imperialism and its Critics |first=Einde |last=O'Callaghan |publisher=[[Marxists Internet Archive]] |date=25 October 2007 |accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic===
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[The Clash of Civilizations|Clash of Civilizations]] --&gt;

Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth bulge theories:

====Malthusian====
[[File:Aerial view of a US helicopter as it flies over a Mogadishu residential area.JPEG|thumb|right|U.S. Marine helicopter on patrol in Somalia as part of the [[Unified Task Force]], 1992]]
[[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian theories]] see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.

[[Pope Urban II]] in 1095, on the eve of the [[First Crusade]], spoke:
{{quote|For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators. Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife. Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end. Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lend me your ears: great speeches in history |first=William |last=Safire |publisher=[[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]] |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-393-05931-1 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources. [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or [[famine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geography: an integrated approach |first=David |last=Waugh |publisher=[[Nelson Thornes]] |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-17-444706-1 |page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Youth bulge====
[[File:2017 world map, median age by country.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Population pyramid|Median age]] by country. War reduces life expectancy. A youth bulge is evident for [[Demographics of Africa|Africa]], and to a lesser extent in some countries in West Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia and Central America.]]

According to Heinsohn, who proposed [[youth bulge]] theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the "fighting age" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age. It will follow periods with [[total fertility rate]]s as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.&lt;ref&gt;Helgerson, John L. (2002): "The National Security Implications of Global Demographic Trends"[http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/cia/helgerson2.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G. (2006): "Demography and War" [https://de.scribd.com/doc/310263543/Gunnar-Heinsohn-Demography-and-War (online)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heinsohn saw both past "Christianist" European colonialism and imperialism, as well as today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.&lt;ref&gt;Heinsohn, G. (2005): "Population, Conquest and Terror in the 21st Century" [https://de.scribd.com/doc/310265022/Gunnar-Heinsohn-Population-Conquest-and-Terror-in-the-21st-Century (online)]&lt;/ref&gt; Among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the [[French Revolution]] of 1789,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack A. Goldstone|title=Revolution and Rebellion in the Early Modern World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-T9dR7nWDUC|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=4 March 1993|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-08267-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effect of economic depression upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Moller, Herbert (1968): ‘Youth as a Force in the Modern World’, ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 10: 238–60; 240–44&lt;/ref&gt; The 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge.&lt;ref&gt;Diessenbacher, Hartmut (1994): ''Kriege der Zukunft: Die Bevölkerungsexplosion gefährdet den Frieden''.

===Rationalist===
[[File:LRPs directing artillery.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. soldiers directing artillery on enemy trucks in A Shau Valley, April 1968]]
[[Rationalism (international relations)|Rationalism]] is an [[international relations theory]] or framework. Rationalism (and [[Neorealism (international relations)]]) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Rationalist Explanations for War|last = Fearon|first = James D.|date = Summer 1995|journal = International Organization |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=379–414|doi = 10.1017/s0020818300033324|pmid = |jstor=2706903}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under a [[game theory]] approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs. In "Rationalist Explanations for War", [[James Fearon]] examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:
* Issue indivisibilities
* Incentives to misrepresent or [[information asymmetry]]
* Commitment problems&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

"Issue indivisibility" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other.

[[File:U.S. Marines in Operation Allen Brook (Vietnam War) 001.jpg|thumb|left|U.S. Marines direct a concentration of fire at the enemy, Vietnam, 8 May 1968]]
"[[Information asymmetry]] with incentives to misrepresent" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state's victory or loss. For instance, [[Geoffrey Blainey]] argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength. He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, "war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Blainey|title=Causes of War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mcknp3tt0LMC&amp;pg=PA114|year=1988|edition=3rd|page=114|accessdate=2016-03-19|isbn=9780029035917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Powell | first1 = Robert | year = 2002 | title = Bargaining Theory and International Conflict | url = | journal = Annual Review of Political Science | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of [[cognitive bias]],&lt;ref&gt;Chris Cramer, 'Civil War is Not a Stupid Thing', {{ISBN|978-1850658214}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are still "as rational as you and me".&lt;ref&gt;From point 10 of [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think (article)], accessed 16 December 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to philosopher [[Iain King]], "Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury...."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from [[Iain King]], in [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think]&lt;/ref&gt;  King asserts that "Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in [[GroupThink]]" which is faulty, but still rational.&lt;ref&gt;Point 6 in [http://asiafoundation.org/in-asia/2014/12/10/modern-conflict-is-not-what-you-think/ Modern Conflict is Not What You Think]&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate. The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lake|first1=David A.|title=Two Cheers for Bargaining Theory: Assessing Rationalist Explanations of the Iraq War|journal=International Security|date=November 2010|pages=7–52|doi=10.1162/isec_a_00029|volume=35|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political science===
The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] following [[World War I]]. More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the [[Correlates of War]] Project, Peter Brecke and the [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis. This kind of division was first proposed by [[Kenneth Waltz]] in ''[[Man, the State, and War]]'' and has been often used by political scientists since then.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|143}}

====System-level====

There are several different [[international relations theory]] schools. Supporters of [[realism in international relations]] argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the [[security dilemma]].&lt;ref name=Levy1998&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Jack S.|title=The Causes of War and the Conditions of Peace|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|date=Jun 1998|volume=1|pages=139–65|doi=10.1146/annurev.polisci.1.1.139|url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1998%20causes%20of%20war%20%26%20conditions%20of%20peace.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TXiBeznJ?url=http://fas-polisci.rutgers.edu/levy/1998%20causes%20of%20war%20%26%20conditions%20of%20peace.pdf|archivedate=2014-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|145}}

Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Hans Morgenthau]], and the [[neorealism (international relations)|neorealist]] school represented by scholars such as [[Kenneth Waltz]] and [[John Mearsheimer]], two main sub-theories are:
# [[Balance of power (international relations)|Balance of power]] theory: States have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition. In this view, an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable, and "movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing."&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|147}} However, evidence has shown power [[Polarity (international relations)|polarity]] is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|147–48}}
# [[Power transition theory]]: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to preemptively suppress them.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}} On this view, unlike for balance-of-power theory, wars become ''more'' probable when power is more equally distributed. This "power preponderance" hypothesis has empirical support.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}}
The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|148}}

[[Liberalism (international relations)|Liberalism]] as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations.  Realists{{who|date=July 2016}} respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|149}} Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|150}} Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war don't necessarily trade less with each other.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|150}}

====Societal-level====
* [[Diversionary foreign policy|Diversionary theory]], also known as the "scapegoat hypothesis", suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152}} This is supported by literature showing out-group hostility [[Realistic conflict theory|enhances]] in-group [[Group cohesiveness|bonding]], and a significant domestic "rally effect" has been demonstrated when conflicts begin.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152–13}} However, studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|152–53}} U.S. war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent U.S. leaders have supported diversionary theory.&lt;ref name="MilitaryAdventurism"&gt;{{cite web| year = 2001| url = http://www.bepress.com/peps/vol7/iss3/3/| title = Peace Economics, Peace Science and Public Policy (p. 19)| accessdate = 2010-02-07| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110707224412/http://www.bepress.com/peps/vol7/iss3/3/| archivedate = 7 July 2011| df = dmy-all}} More recently studies (Lebow 2008, Lindemann 2010) demonstrated that striving for self-esteem (i.e. virile self images), and recognition as a Great Power or non-recognition (exclusion and punishment of great powers, denying traumatic historical events) is a principal cause of international conflict and war.
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Individual-level====

These theories suggest differences in people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand.&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|157}} For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by [[bounded rationality]] and various [[cognitive biases]],&lt;ref name=Levy1998 /&gt;{{rp|157}} such as [[prospect theory]].&lt;ref name=Levy1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levy|first1=Jack S.|title=Prospect Theory, Rational Choice, and International Relations|journal=International Studies Quarterly|date=Mar 1997|volume=41|issue=1|pages=87–112|url=http://www.ou.edu/uschina/texts/Levy.97.ISQ.ProspectTheory.pdf|doi=10.1111/0020-8833.00034|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075824/http://www.ou.edu/uschina/texts/Levy.97.ISQ.ProspectTheory.pdf|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics==
[[File:Morgen nach der Schlacht967b.jpg|thumb|''Morning after the [[Battle of Waterloo]]'', by [[John Heaviside Clark]], 1816]]

The [[morality]] of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="DeForrest"&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest |first=Mark Edward |title=Conclusion |url=http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26/ |website=JUST WAR THEORY AND THE RECENT U.S. AIR STRIKES AGAINST IRAQ |publisher=Gonzaga Journal of International Law |accessdate=August 1, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402204812/http://www.gonzagajil.org/content/view/72/26 |archivedate=2 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the [[just war theory]], are ''[[jus ad bellum]]'' and ''[[Jus in bello]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeForrest |first=Mark Edward |title=GENERALLY RECOGNIZED PRINCIPLES OF JUST WAR THEORY |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Jus ad bellum'' (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation. There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Aquinas|first=Thomas|title=Part II, Question 40|url=http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020212080058/http://ethics.sandiego.edu/Books/Texts/Aquinas/JustWar.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=February 12, 2002|website=The Summa Theologica|publisher=Benziger Bros. edition, 1947|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosley|first=Alexander|title=The Jus Ad Bellum Convention|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|website=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Jus in bello]]'' (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war. The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination. Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.&lt;ref name="Moseley"&gt;{{cite web|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|title=The Principles Of Jus In Bello|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|website=Just War Theory|publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=August 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.&lt;ref name="Moseley"/&gt; Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.&lt;ref name="Codevilla, Seabury 1989 304"&gt;{{cite book|last=Codevilla, Seabury|first=Angelo, Paul|title=War: Ends and Means|year=1989|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-465-09067-9|page=304|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/157488610X/ref=pd_lpo_k2_dp_sr_1?pf_rd_p=486539851&amp;pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1&amp;pf_rd_t=201&amp;pf_rd_i=0465090672&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_r=0144DHEVCX1XCVMJXAZQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RIAN archive 324 In besieged Leningrad.jpg|thumb|In besieged [[Leningrad]]. "Hitler ordered that Moscow and Leningrad were to be razed to the ground; their inhabitants were to be annihilated or driven out by starvation. These intentions were part of the '[[General Plan East]]'."  – ''The Oxford Companion to World War II.''&lt;ref&gt;[[I.C.B. Dear|Ian Dear]], [[M.R.D. Foot|Michael Richard Daniell Foot]] (2001). ''The Oxford Companion to World War II.'' Oxford University Press. p. 88. {{ISBN|0-19-860446-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in [[International Law]]'s regulations on legitimate war.&lt;ref name="DeForrest"/&gt;

Fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as [[Pragmatism]], racism, and [[social Darwinism]], hold that violence is good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffin and Feldman, eds|first=Roger and Matthew|title=Fascism: Fascism and Culture|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodley|first=Daniel|title=Fascism and political theory critical perspectives on fascist ideology|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-87157-7|page=276|url=http://wxy.seu.edu.cn/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20100724/20100724163537707.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112104606/http://wxy.seu.edu.cn/humanities/sociology/htmledit/uploadfile/system/20100724/20100724163537707.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality. Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both. Social Darwinism asserts that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so civilization can flourish. These are broad [[archetypes]] for the general position that [[the ends justify the means]]. Lewis Coser, U.S. conflict theorist and sociologist, argued conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created. Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society.&lt;ref&gt;Ankony, Robert C., "Sociological and Criminological Theory: Brief of Theorists, Theories, and Terms," ''CFM Research'', Jul. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was born in Upper Canada, the son of William Bruce and Mary Alguire. Bruce was educated by [[John Strachan]] in [[Cornwall, Ontario|Cornwall]] and went on to study medicine. He lived in Cornwall. Bruce served in the Stormont militia during the [[War of 1812]], later reaching the rank of lieutenant. He was named a [[justice of the peace]] for the [[Eastern District, Upper Canada|Eastern District]] in 1833 and was appointed [[coroner]] in 1835. He died in Cornwall.
