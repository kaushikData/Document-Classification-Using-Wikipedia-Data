'''''Acacia confusa''''' is a perennial tree native to South-East Asia. Some common names for it are '''acacia petit feuille''', '''small Philippine acacia''', '''Formosa acacia''' (Taiwan acacia) and '''Formosan koa'''. It grows to a height of 15m. The tree has become very common in many tropical Pacific areas, including Hawaii, where the species is considered invasive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hear.org/Pier/wra/pacific/acacia_confusa_htmlwra.htm Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk (PIER)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Its uses include chemical products, environmental management and food and drink. The bark may be ground into a powder and saturated into water to create a tea, or may be spread onto various foods as a spice and taste enhancer. The wood has a density of about 0.75 g/cm³.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/W4095E/w4095e0c.htm FAO Appendix 1]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Taiwan]], its wood is used to make support beams for [[Underground mining|underground mines]].  The wood is also converted to [[charcoal]] for family use. The plant is used in traditional medicine&lt;ref&gt;Li, Thomas S. C.

[[File:Zodiac in The Sky, pp. 40–41.jpg|thumb|360px|The twelve signs of the zodiac, miniatures from a [[book of hours]]. (''The Sky: Order and Chaos'' by [[Jean-Pierre Verdet]], from the '[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]' series)]]
In [[Western astrology]], '''astrological signs''' are the twelve 30° sectors of the [[ecliptic]], starting at the [[vernal equinox]] (one of the intersections of the ecliptic with the [[celestial equator]]), also known as the First Point of Aries. The order of the astrological signs is [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]].

The concept of the [[zodiac]] originated in [[Babylonian astrology]], and was later influenced by [[Hellenistic astrology|Hellenistic]] culture. According to [[astrology]], celestial phenomena relate to human activity on the principle of "[[Macrocosm and microcosm|as above, so below]]", so that the signs are held to represent characteristic modes of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo (1979), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Modern discoveries about the true nature of celestial objects has undermined the theoretical basis for assigning meaning to astrological signs, and empirical scientific investigation has shown that predictions and recommendations based on these systems are not accurate.&lt;ref name="Cosmic"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jeffrey Bennett |author2=Megan Donohue |author3=Nicholas Schneider |author4=Mark Voit |title=The cosmic perspective |year=2007 |publisher=Pearson/Addison-Wesley |location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=0-8053-9283-1 |pages=82–84 |edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85;}}&lt;ref name=Zarka&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zarka |first=Philippe |title=Astronomy and astrology |journal=Proceedings of the International Astronomical Union |year=2011 |volume=5 |issue=S260 |pages=420–425 |doi=10.1017/S1743921311002602}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|424}} Astrology is generally regarded as [[pseudoscience]].

The twelve sector division of the ecliptic constitutes astrology's primary frame of reference when considering the positions of celestial bodies, from a geocentric point of view, so that we may find, for instance, the Sun in 23° ''Aries'' (23° longitude), the Moon in 7° ''Scorpio'' (217° longitude), or Jupiter in 29° ''Pisces'' (359° longitude). Beyond the celestial bodies, other astrological points that are dependent on geographical location and time (namely, the [[Ascendant]], the [[Midheaven]], the Vertex and the [[astrological houses|houses]]' cusps) are also referenced within this [[ecliptic coordinate system]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Various approaches to measuring and dividing the sky are currently used by differing systems of astrology, although the tradition of the Zodiac's names and symbols remain consistent. Western astrology measures from [[Equinox]] and [[Solstice]] points (points relating to equal, longest and shortest days of the [[tropical year]]), while [[Jyotiṣa]] or [[Vedic astrology]] measures along the equatorial plane ([[sidereal year]]). [[Precession]] results in Western astrology's zodiacal divisions not corresponding in the current era to the [[constellations]] that carry similar names,&lt;ref&gt;Bobrick (2005), pp. 10, 23.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Jyotiṣa]] measurements still correspond with the background constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Johnsen (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western and Indian astrology, the emphasis is on space, and the movement of the Sun, Moon and [[Planets in astrology|planets]] in the sky through each of the zodiac signs. In Chinese astrology, by contrast, the emphasis is on time, with the zodiac operating on cycles of years, months, and hours of the day.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

A common feature of all three traditions however, is the significance of the Ascendant – the zodiac sign that is rising (due to the rotation of the earth) on the eastern horizon at the moment of a person's birth.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Image:Sign cusps.png|250px|thumb|right|The twelve ecliptic signs. Each dot marks the start of a sign and they are separated by 30°. The intersection of the celestial equator and the ecliptic define the equinoctial points: First Point of Aries ([[Image:Aries.svg|11px]]) and First Point of Libra ([[Image:Libra.svg|11px]]). The [[great circle]] containing the celestial poles and the ecliptic poles (P and P'), intersect the ecliptic at 0° Cancer ([[Image:Cancer.svg|11px]]) and 0° Capricorn ([[Image:Capricorn.svg|12px]]). In this illustration, the Sun is schematically positioned at the start of Aquarius ([[Image:Aquarius.svg|11px]]).]]

While Western astrology is essentially a product of Greco-Roman culture, some of its more basic concepts originated in Babylonia. Isolated references to celestial "signs" in Sumerian sources are insufficient to speak of a Sumerian zodiac.&lt;ref&gt;Rochberg (1998), p. ''ix''.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs (1948), p. 289.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 4th century BC, [[Babylonia]]n astronomy and its system of celestial omens had an influence on the culture of [[ancient Greece]], as did the astrology of [[ancient Egypt]] by late 2nd century BC. This resulted, unlike the Mesopotamian tradition, in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and in the creation of [[horoscopic astrology]], employing the use of the [[Ascendant]] (the rising degree of the ecliptic, at the time of birth), and of the twelve [[House (astrology)|houses]]. Association of the astrological signs with [[Empedocles]]' four classical [[Classical element|elements]] was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs.

The body of astrological knowledge by the 2nd century AD is described in Ptolemy's ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', a work that was responsible for astrology's successful spread across Europe and the Middle East, and remained a reference for almost seventeen centuries as later traditions made few substantial changes to its core teachings.

The following table enumerates the twelve divisions of celestial longitude, with the Latin names (still widely used) and the English translation (gloss). The longitude [[Interval (mathematics)#Notations for intervals|intervals]], being a mathematical division, are closed for the first endpoint (''a'') and open for the second (''b'') – for instance, 30° of longitude is the first point of Taurus, not part of Aries. Association of calendar dates with astrological signs only makes sense when referring to [[Sun sign astrology]].

[[Image:Sign position example.svg|220px|thumb|right|A simple diagram displaying the planets' sign positions on May 16th, 2012. The signs are colored according to the associated element. Each planet is represented by a [[Astrological symbols|glyph]] next to its longitude within the sign. Additional symbols may be added to represent [[apparent retrograde motion]] ([[File:Retrograde-symbol.svg|11px]]), or apparent stationary moment (shift from retrograde to direct, or vice versa: S).]]

[[Empedocles]], a fifth-century BC Greek philosopher, identified Fire, Earth, Air, and Water as [[classical element|elements]]. He explained the nature of the universe as an interaction of two opposing principles called love and strife manipulating the four elements, and stated that these four elements were all equal, of the same age, that each rules its own province, and each possesses its own individual character. Different mixtures of these elements produced the different natures of things. Empedocles said that those who were born with near equal proportions of the four elements are more intelligent and have the most exact perceptions.&lt;ref name="Charlie Higgins"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://accessnewage.com/Articles/astro/HIGELEMS.HTM |title=Astrology and The Four Elements |author=Charlie Higgins |year=1997 |accessdate=2009-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103102752/http://accessnewage.com/articles/astro/HIGELEMS.HTM |archivedate=2010-01-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each sign is associated with one of the [[classical element]]s,&lt;ref name="RobLeo"&gt;Robert Pelletier &amp; Leonard Cataldo ''Ibid'' p 43-44, 1984; Maritha Pottenger, ''Ibid'', pp. 383–93, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and these can also be grouped according to polarity: Fire and Air signs are considered [[Positive sign|positive]] or [[extrovert]], masculine signs; while Water and Earth signs are considered [[Negative sign|negative]] or [[introvert]], feminine signs. The four astrological elements are also considered as a direct equivalent to [[Four temperaments|Hippocrates' personality types]] (sanguine = air; choleric = fire; melancholic = earth; phlegmatic = water). A modern approach looks at elements as "''the energy substance of experience''"&lt;ref name="Arroyo27"&gt;Arroyo (1989), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and the next table tries to summarize their description through keywords.&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo (1989), pp. 30–34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1978), p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

Classification according to element has gained such importance, that some astrologers start their interpretation of a [[natal chart]], by studying the balance of elements shown by the position of [[Planets in astrology|planets]] and [[Angle (astrology)|angles]]&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo (1975). pp.&amp;nbsp;131–140.&lt;/ref&gt; (especially the Sun, the Moon and the Ascendant).

=== The three modalities ===

--&gt;
Each of the four elements manifests in three modalities: Cardinal, Fixed and Mutable.&lt;ref&gt;Arroyo (1989), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; As each modality comprehends four signs, these are also known as Quadruplicities.&lt;ref name="RobLeo"/&gt; They are occasionally referred to as crosses because each modality forms a cross when drawn across the zodiac. Christian astrology relates the three qualities to the three aspects of God in the trinity{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

The combination of element and modality provides a basic sign characterization. For instance, Capricorn is a cardinal earth sign, meaning that it is associated with action (cardinal modality) in the material world (earth element). That can translate into ambition or practical application to the concrete, everyday necessities of life.&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1978), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Rulership is the connection between [[Planets in astrology|planet]] and correlated sign and [[House (astrology)|house]].&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1978), p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional [[history of astrology|Western astrology]], each sign is ruled by one and only one of the seven visible planets (note that in [[astrology]], the Sun and Moon are termed The Lights, while the other bodies are called planets, which literally means ''wanderers'', i.e. wandering stars as opposed to the fixed stars). The traditional rulerships are as follows: [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] ([[Mars]]), [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] ([[Venus]]), [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] ([[Moon]]), [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]] ([[Sun]]), [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] ([[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]), [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] ([[Venus]]), [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] ([[Pluto]]), [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]] ([[Jupiter]]), [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]] ([[Saturn]]), [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] ([[Uranus]]), and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] ([[Neptune]]).&lt;ref name="astrologynow.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrologynow.com/carolwillis/Rulerships.txt |title=Rulerships |author=Carol Wills |year=2007 |website=astrologynow.com |accessdate=2007-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127194954/http://www.astrologynow.com/carolwillis/Rulerships.txt |archivedate=2007-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shamos|first1=Geoffery|title=Astrology as a Social Framework: The 'Children of Planets', 1400–1600|journal=Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature &amp; Culture|date=2013|volume=7|issue=4|pages=434–460|doi=10.1558/jsrnc.v7i4.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Psychological astrology|Psychologically-oriented]] astrologers often believe that [[Saturn]] is the ruler or co-ruler of Aquarius instead of Uranus; [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] is the ruler or co-ruler of Pisces instead of Jupiter, and that [[Pluto (mythology)|Pluto]] is the ruler or co-ruler of Scorpio instead of Mars. Some astrologers&lt;ref name="Planet Waves"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chiron as True Ruler of Virgo?|accessdate= July 18, 2014|url= http://www.planetwaves.net/cainer/archive/003530.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the planetoid [[Chiron]] may be the ruler of Virgo, while other group of modern astrologers claim that [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is the ruler of Taurus instead.  Other astrologers, still, use the former planets [[Asteroids in astrology|Pallas, Vesta, Juno and Hygiea]] in their delineations and rulerships, for example Vesta to Taurus and Pallas to Virgo.

Debate continues between those who consider the newly discovered planets as rulers or co-rulers of certain signs and those that do not. Some astrologers do not even use the astrological signs at all (mostly Cosmobiologists and Uranian Astrologers/Hamburg School). Therefore, they do not take into account planetary rulerships and the essential dignities when interpreting an astrological chart.

Note that, if one starts from Leo and Cancer, the traditional planetary rulers are arrayed outward in the same order from the sun as they occur in the natural [[solar system]]. The Lights ruling Leo and Cancer, Mercury ruling Virgo and Gemini, Venus ruling Libra and Taurus, Mars ruling Scorpio and Aries, Jupiter ruling Sagittarius and Pisces, Saturn ruling Capricorn and Aquarius. The result is a symmetry of traditional rulerships across the 0° Leo/Aquarius axis. Note that modern rulerships, which attribute Pluto as ruler of Scorpio, break this symmetry.

The following table shows both, traditional&lt;ref name="astrologynow.com"/&gt; and modern,&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1978), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; rulerships.

Signs can also be listed by opposite, resulting in six couples who are:

* Aries is opposite to Libra
* Taurus is opposite to Scorpio
* Gemini is opposite to Sagittarius
* Cancer is opposite to Capricorn
* Leo is opposite to Aquarius
* Virgo is opposite to Pisces

To note that Fire and Air (light elements) signs are opposited between them, like happens for Earth and Water ones (heavy elements).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dichesegnosei.it/opposizione|title=Opposition|website=dichesegnosei.it|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spring signs are opposite to autumn ones, and winter signs are related to summer ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dichesegnosei.it/elementi/2994-aria|title=The element of Air|website=dichesegnosei.it|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dichesegnosei.it/elementi/2992-fuoco|title=The element of Fire|website=dichesegnosei.it|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dichesegnosei.it/elementi/2993-acqua|title=The element of Water|website=dichesegnosei.it|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dichesegnosei.it/elementi/2995-terra|title=The element of Earth|website=dichesegnosei.it|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dignity and detriment, exaltation and fall ===
&lt;!--

--&gt;
A traditional belief of astrology, known as [[essential dignity]], is the idea that the Sun, Moon and planets are more powerful and effective in some signs than others, because the basic nature of both is held to be in harmony. By contrast, they are held to find some signs to be weak or difficult to operate in because their natures are thought to be in conflict. The most important of these categories are Dignity, Detriment, Exaltation and Fall.

* '''[[Essential dignity|Dignity]]''' and '''[[Detriment (astrology)|Detriment]]''' : A [[Planets in astrology|planet]] is strengthened or '''dignified''' if it falls within the sign that it rules. In other words, it is said to exercise ''[[Domicile (astrology)|Rulership]]'' of the sign. For example, the Moon in Cancer is considered "strong" (well-dignified). Seventeenth century astrologer [[William Lilly]] compared rulership to a king on his throne, with considerable dignity. If a planet is in the sign opposite that which it rules (or is dignified), it is said to be weakened or in '''Detriment''' (for example, the Moon in Capricorn).&lt;ref name="glossary"&gt;"Glossary of Astrological Terms". Logos, Asaa 1998–2004. 26 Nov 2007. {{cite web|url=http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122142135/http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |archivedate=2008-01-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In traditional astrology, other levels of Dignity are recognised in addition to Rulership. These are known as Exaltation (see below), [[Triplicity]], [[Terms or bounds]], and Face or [[Decans|Decan]], which together are known as describing a planet's ''[[Essential dignity]]'', the quality or ability to give of one's true nature. Contemporary traditional astrologers like [[John Frawley (astrologer)|John Frawley]] or [[J Lee Lehman]] explain further on the concept of Essential Dignity.&lt;ref name="glossary" /&gt;

* '''[[Exaltation (astrology)|Exaltation]]''' and '''[[Astrological fall|Fall]]''' : In addition, a planet is also strengthened when it is in its sign of '''Exaltation'''. In traditional horary astrology, Exaltation denotes a level of dignity somewhat exaggerated compared to rulership. Exaltation was considered to give the planet (or what it signified in a horary chart) dignity, with the metaphor of an honoured guest – who is the centre of attention but the extent of their ability to act is limited. Examples of planets in their Exaltation are: Saturn (Libra), Sun (Aries), Venus (Pisces), Moon (Taurus), Mercury (Virgo, although some disagree to this classification), Mars (Capricorn), Jupiter (Cancer). A planet in the opposite sign of its Exaltation is said to be in its '''Fall''', and thus weakened, perhaps seemingly more so than Detriment. The Planet in fall is passively rejected or ignored by the sign that it's in. It can be likened to a mayor of a rival city trying to make suggestions to the hosting mayor for how he should run his city: The host mayor finds it difficult to trust him and cannot see how his input could have relevancy to his city. The people of the city feel the same as their ruler. The result is impasse and failure on behalf of both mayors and the city.&lt;ref name="glossary" /&gt; There is no agreement as to the signs in which the three extra-Saturnian planets may be considered to be exalted.&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1978), p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The following table summarizes the positions described above:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|-
! Planet (Symbol) !! Dignity !! Detriment !! Exaltation !! Fall
|-
| '''Sun''' ([[File:Sun symbol.svg|15px|Sol]]) || Leo || Aquarius || Aries || Libra
|-
| '''Moon''' ([[File:Moon symbol crescent.svg|15px|First quarter moon]]) || Cancer || Capricorn || Taurus || Scorpio

|}

In addition to essential dignity, the traditional astrologer considers ''[[Accidental dignity]]'' of planets. This is placement by [[astrological house|house]] in the chart under examination. Accidental dignity is the planet's "ability to act." So we might have, for example, Moon in Cancer, dignified by rulership, is placed in the 12th house it would have little scope to express its good nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accidental Dignity|publisher= Astrological Dictionary 1998–2007|website= www.gotohoroscope.com|date= 26 November 2007|url= http://www.gotohoroscope.com/dictionary/astrological/5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 12th is a cadent house as are the 3rd, 6th and 9th and planets in these houses are considered weak or afflicted. On the other hand, Moon in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th would be more able to act as these are Angular houses. Planets in Succedent houses of the chart (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th) are generally considered to be of medium ability to act. Besides Accidental Dignity, there are a range of ''Accidental Debilities'', such as retrogradation, Under the Sun's Beams, Combust, and so forth.

{{Details|Decans}}
Each sign can be divided into three 10° sectors known as decans or decanates, though these have fallen into disuse. The first decanate is said to be most emphatically of its own nature and is ruled by the sign ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1978), p.&amp;nbsp;87&lt;/ref&gt; The next decanate is sub-ruled by the planet ruling the next sign in the same triplicity. The last decanate is sub-ruled by the next in order in the same triplicity.&lt;ref&gt;Hone (1978), p.&amp;nbsp;88&lt;/ref&gt;

While the element and modality of a sign are together sufficient to define it, they can be grouped to indicate their symbolism. The first four signs, Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer, form the group of personal signs. The next four signs, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio form the group of interpersonal signs. The last four signs of the zodiac, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces, form the group of transpersonal signs.&lt;ref name="spiritsingles.com"&gt;"An Introduction to Astrology."

Dane Rudhyar presented the tropical zodiac primary factors,&lt;ref&gt;Rudhyar (1943)&lt;/ref&gt; used in the curriculum of the RASA School of Astrology. The tropical zodiac is the zodiac of seasonal factors as opposed to the sidereal zodiac (constellation factors). The primary seasonal factors are based on the changing ratio of sunlight and darkness across the year. The first factor is whether the chosen time falls in the half of the year when daylight is increasing, or the half of the year when darkness is increasing. The second factor is whether the chosen time falls in the half of the year when there is more daylight than darkness, or the half when there is more darkness than daylight. The third factor is which of the four seasons the chosen time falls in, defined by the first two factors.

== Indian astrology ==
{{further|Hindu astrology}}
In Indian astrology, there are four elements: fire, earth, air, and water. The master of fire is Mars, while Mercury is of earth, Saturn of air, and Venus of water.

[[Jyotish]] astrology recognises twelve zodiac signs (Rāśi),&lt;ref&gt;Sutton (1999) pp. 74–92.&lt;/ref&gt; that correspond to those in Western astrology. The relation of the signs to the elements is the same in the two systems.

A '''nakshatra''' ([[Devanagari]]: नक्षत्र, [[Sanskrit]] ''{{IAST|nakshatra}}'', from ''{{IAST|naksha-}}'' 'approach', and ''{{IAST|tra-}}'' 'guard') or '''lunar mansion''' is one of the 27 divisions of the sky, identified by the prominent star(s) in them, as used in [[Hindu astronomy]] and [[Jyotisha|astrology]] ([[Jyotisha]]).&lt;ref&gt;Sutton (1999), p.&amp;nbsp;168.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chinese zodiac signs ==
{{main|Chinese zodiac}}

Unlike the [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] and Indian zodiacs, the Chinese zodiac signs are not derived from constellations, and are not assigned to sections of the ecliptic. Instead, Chinese astrological signs operate on cycles of years, lunar months, and two-hour periods of the day (also known as ''shichen''). A particular feature of the Chinese zodiac is its operation in a [[Sexagenary cycle|60-year cycle]] in combination with the [[Wu Xing|Five Phases]] of [[Chinese astrology]] ([[Wood (Wu Xing)|Wood]], [[Fire (Wu Xing)|Fire]], [[Metal (Wu Xing)|Metal]], [[Water (Wu Xing)|Water]] and [[Earth (Wu Xing)|Earth]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://big5.china.com.cn/culture/txt/2009-02/16/content_17286701.htm |title='Almanac' 'lunar' zodiac beginning of spring as the boundary dislocation? – China Network |date=16 February 2009 |accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, some researches say that there is an obvious relationship between the Chinese 12-year cycle and zodiac constellations: each year of the cycle corresponds to a certain disposal of Jupiter. For example, in the year of [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]] Jupiter is in the Sign of Gemini, in the year of [[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]] Jupiter is in the Sign of Cancer and so on. So the Chinese 12-year calendar is a solar-lunar-jovian calendar.

In [[Chinese astrology]], the zodiac of twelve animal sign represents twelve different types of personality. The zodiac traditionally begins with the sign of the [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]], and there are many stories about the [[Origins of the Chinese Zodiac]] which explain why this is so. When the twelve zodiac signs are part of the 60-year calendar in combination with the four elements, they are traditionally called the twelve [[Earthly Branches]]. The Chinese zodiac follows the [[Lunisolar calendar|lunisolar]] [[Chinese calendar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novak|first1=Sarah|title=The Chinese Zodiac|journal=Faces|volume=34|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus the "changeover" days in a month (when one sign changes to another sign) vary each year. The following are the twelve zodiac signs in order.&lt;ref name=Lau&gt;Theodora Lau, ''Ibid'', pp. 2–8, 30–5, 60–4, 88–94, 118–24, 148–53, 178–84, 208–13, 238–44, 270–78, 306–12, 338–44, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Atar ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˈətər/]]''' ([[Avestan language|Avestan]] 𐬁𐬙𐬀𐬭 ''ātar'') is the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] concept of [[fire worship|holy fire]], sometimes described in abstract terms as "burning and unburning fire" or "visible and invisible fire" (Mirza, 1987:389). It is considered to be the visible presence of [[Ahura Mazda]] and his [[aša]]. The rituals for purifying a fire are performed 1,128 times a year.

In the [[Avestan language]], ''ātar'' is an attribute of sources of heat and light, of which the nominative singular form is ''ātarš'', source of [[Persian language|Persian]] ''ātaš'' (fire). It is etymologically related to the [[Avestan]] ''𐬁𐬚𐬭𐬀𐬎𐬎𐬀𐬥‎‎ āθrauuan'' / ''aθaurun'' ([[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] अथर्वन् ''atharvan''), a type of priest. It was later copied by the [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:ater#Latin|ater]]'' (black) and possibly a cognate of the Slavic ''[[wikt:vatër#Albanian|vatra]]'' (fire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ots=wVn2X8839E&amp;dq=mallory%20indo-european&amp;pg=PA202#v=onepage&amp;q=atars&amp;f=false |title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture - James Mallory - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later Zoroastrianism, ''ātar'' ([[Persian language|Middle Persian]]: 𐭠𐭲𐭥𐭥𐭩 ''ādar'' or ''ādur'') is iconographically conflated with fire itself, which in Middle Persian is 𐭠𐭲𐭧𐭱 ''ātaxsh'', one of the primary objects of Zoroastrian symbolism.

==In scripture==

===In the Gathic texts===
''Atar'' is already evident in the [[Gathas]], the oldest texts of the compendium of the [[Avesta]] and believed to have been composed by [[Zoroaster]] himself. At this juncture, as in the ''[[Yasna Haptanghaiti]]'' (the seven-chapter [[Yasna]] that structurally interrupts the Gathas and is linguistically as old as the Gathas themselves), ''atar'' is still—with only one exception—an abstract concept simply an instrument, a medium, of the Creator and is not yet the divinity (''[[yazata]]'') of heat and light that ''atar'' was to become in the later texts.

In the most ancient texts, ''atar'' is a medium, a faculty, through which judgement is passed and reflects the pre-Zoroastrian institution of [[Trial by ordeal|ordeal by heat]] (Avestan: ''garmo-varah'', heat ordeal; ''cf.'' Boyce 1996:ch. 6). So, for example, justice is administered through ''atar'' (''Yasna'' 31.3, 34.4, 36.2, 47.2), the blazing ''atar'' (31.19, 51.9), through the heat of ''atar'' (43.4), through the blazing, shining, molten metal (''ayangha Khshushta'', 30.7, 32.7, 51.9). An individual who has passed the fiery test, has attained physical and spiritual strength, wisdom, truth and love with serenity (30.7). However, among all the references to ''atar'' in the oldest texts, it is only once  addressed independently of [[Ahura Mazda]]. In this exception, ''atar'' is spoken of in the third person masculine singular: "He detects sinners by hand-grasping" (''Yasna'' 34.4). Altogether, "there are said to have been some 30 kinds of fiery tests in all." (Boyce, 2002:1)

Also in the early texts, tangential to its role in establishing guilt, ''atar'' is the light of revelation through which Zoroaster is selected for prophet-hood, the ''Zarathushtra Mainyu Athra'' (''Yasna'' 31.3), radiated by Wisdom/Mazda (43.9), bearing the conviction of "Good Purpose"  (''Vohu Manah'', 43.4; see also [[Amesha Spenta]]), and enlightening one’s inner-self (46.7). Within this framework of the concept of divine illumination, ''atar'' radiates the "other lights" (31.7), the essence (of Mazda) from which insight and wisdom permeate the universe. So also Zoroaster's injunction to always pray in the presence of ''atar''—either towards the sun, or towards their own hearths—so as to better concentrate their devotions on ''[[asha]]'', righteousness, and the virtue that should be striven for (''Yasna'' 43.9, see also Boyce, 1975:455).

===In later texts===
The Gathic role of ''atar'' as the medium for detecting guilt is not directly evident in the later texts of the Avesta, but reappears in modified form as an allegory of burning and annihilating the [[Angra Mainyu]] through righteousness, "where Asha Vahishta is identified at times with the household fire on the hearth." There, "identification in the realms of matter and of spirit serves only to bring more into prominence the main tenets of Zoroaster's teachings in regard to Asha" (Dhalla, 1938:170). A vestige of the ancient institution of ordeal by heat is nonetheless present in ''Vendidad'' 4.54–55, where speaking against the truth and violating the sanctity of promise is punishable by flogging and is detected by the consumption of "water, blazing, of golden color, having the power to detect guilt." The ''Zend'' translation/commentary on this passage translates "blazing" as having brimstone and sulphur, and notes that innocence or guilt was established by the consumption of this "guilt-detecting liquid". Similarly, in the ''Denkard'', Adharbad Maraspand—the Sassanid era high-priest to whom the collation of the Avesta texts is attributed—is purported to have nine measures of "unburning molten zinc" applied to his chest as proof of accuracy of the sacred texts.

Seen chronologically, the transition from ''atar'' as a vehicle of judgement to ''Atar [[Yazata]]'' the divinity presiding over blazing fire is abrupt. While the older Gathic Avestan texts have heat (and thus fire) associated with harsh judgement, the Younger Avestan texts have the divinity ''Atar'' completely representing and being represented by fire itself; and associated with warmth and light and essential for growth. ''Asha Vahishta''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s association with ''atar'' is however carried forward, and they are often mentioned together (''Yasna'' 62.3, ''Nyashes'' 5.9, etc.). So also in their roles as protectors, for "when the Evil Spirit assailed the creation of Good Truth, Good Thought and Fire intervened" (''Yasht'' 13.77)

It is in the later texts that ''Atar''  is personified as "the son" of Ahura Mazda (standard appellation, ''Yasna'' 25.7 et al.) and is addressed as "full of glory and full of healing remedies" (''Nyash'' 5.6). In ''Yasna'' 17.11, ''Atar'' is "master of the house", recalling the role of the hearth fire in the Gathas. The same passage enumerates the "five kinds of fire":
# ''atar berezi-savah'', "the highly beneficent ''atar''" (compare "[[oxygen]]"), qualified in ''Zend'' texts as "the fire that eats food but drinks no water", and the kind of fire that burns in an ''[[Atash Behram|Atash-Behram]]'', the highest grade of [[fire temple]].
# ''atar vohu-fryana'', "the ''atar'' of good affection" (compare "[[fire]]", cognate with [[bhaga]] and [[Friendship|friend]]), later qualified as "the fire diffusing goodness", and "the  fire that consumes both water and food".
# ''atar urvazishta'', "the ''atar'' of greatest bliss" (compare "[[Heat|warmth]]), later qualified as "the fire of happy life", and "the fire that drinks water but eats no food".
# ''atar vazishta'', "the ''atar'' most swift" (compare "[[electric spark]]s"), later qualified as the fire in clouds, i.e. lightning, and as "the fire that neither drinks water nor eats food".
# ''atar spenishta'', "the ''atar'' most holy",&lt;ref name="Boyce_AmeshaSpenta"&gt;{{citation|chapter = Aməša Spənta|last = Boyce|first = Mary|title = Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume = 1|year = 1983|location = New York|publisher = Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|pages = 933–936}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (compare  "[[Aether (mythology)|Aether]]", cognate Balto-Slavic ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Slavic/svętъ|šventas]]'' "holy") ( described in "Zend" texts as "the fire of prosperity" and as the spiritual fire burning before [[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmuzd]].
The description of the fires in the Sassanid era commentaries (the ''Zend'' texts) differs slightly from those described in the ''Bundahishn'' ("Original Creation", completed in the 11th or 12th century). In the latter, the description of the first and last kind of fire is reversed.

==In culture and tradition==
[[Image:Parsi-jashan-ceremony-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A [[Parsi people|Parsi]]-Zoroastrian ''Jashan'' ceremony (here the blessing of a home in [[Pune]], India)]]

===As a divinity===
During the late [[Achaemenid dynasty|Achaemenid era]], ''adar''—as the quintessence of the [[Yazata]] ''Adar''—was incorporated in the Zoroastrian hierarchy of angels. In that position, ''Adar'' is a helper of ''Asha Vahishta'' (Avestan, middle Persian: ''Ardvahisht''), the [[Amesha Spenta]] responsible for the luminaries. From among the flowers associated with the Zoroastrian angels, ''Adar''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s is the [[Calendula|marigold (''calendula'')]] (''Bundahishn'' 27.24).

The importance of the divinity ''Adar'' is evident from a dedication to the entity in the [[Zoroastrian calendar]]: ''Adar'' is one of the only five lower-ranking divinities that have a month-name dedication. Additionally, ''Adar'' is the name of the ninth day of the month in the Zoroastrian religious calendar, and the ninth month of the year of the civil Iranian calendar of 1925 (modern Persian: ''Azar'') which has month-names derived from those used by the Zoroastrian calendar. 

In Zoroastrian cosmogony, ''Adar'' was the seventh of the seven creations of the material universe. It is only with ''Adar''s assistance, who serves as the life-force, that the other six creations begin their work (''Bundahishn'' 3.7–8; more logically explained in ''Zatspram'' 3.77–83).

===The cult of fire===
Although Zoroastrians revere fire in any form, the temple fire is not literally for the reverence of fire, but together with clean water (see [[Aban]]), is an agent of ritual purity. Clean, white "ash for the purification ceremonies [is] regarded as the basis of ritual life", which "are essentially the rites proper to the tending of a domestic fire, for the temple cult is that of the hearth fire raised to a new solemnity" (Boyce, 1975:455). For, "the man who sacrifices unto fire with fuel in his hand, with the ''Baresman'' in his hand, with milk in his hand, with the mortar for crushing the branches of the sacred [[Haoma]] in his hand, is given happiness" (''Yasna'' 62.1; ''Nyashes'' 5.7) &lt;!-- All the above are also reasons why natural fires such as those fed by natural gas, surface oil or tar—although honored—are/were inappropriate for use as temple fires. Moreover, a sacred fire must be readily transferrable from one site to another (for instance, to protect it during times of war), which would not be possible for a fire bound by topographical constraints. --&gt;

The Zoroastrian cult of fire is apparently much younger than Zoroastrianism itself and appears at approximately the same time as the shrine cult, first evident in the 4th century BCE (roughly contemporaneous with the introduction of ''Adar'' as a divinity). There is no allusion to a temple cult of fire in the Avesta proper, nor is there any [[old Persian language]] word for one. Moreover, Boyce suggests that the temple cult of fire was instituted in opposition to the image/shrine cult, an alien form of worship, and "no actual ruins of a fire temple have been identified from before the Parthian period" (Boyce, 1975:454).

That the cult of fire was a doctrinal modification and absent from early Zoroastrianism is still evident in the later ''Atash Nyash'': in the oldest passages of that liturgy, it is the hearth fire that speaks to "all those for whom it cooks the evening and morning meal", which Boyce observes is not consistent with sanctified fire. The temple cult is an even later development: From [[Herodotus]] it is known that in the mid-5th century BCE the Zoroastrians worshipped to the open sky, ascending mounds to light their fires (''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', i.131). [[Strabo]] confirms this, noting that in the 6th century, the sanctuary at Zela in [[Cappadocia]] was an artificial mound, walled in, but open to the sky (''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geographica]]'' XI.8.4.512).

By the [[Parthia|Parthian era]] (250 BCE–226 CE), Zoroastrianism had in fact two kinds of places of worship: One, apparently called ''bagin'' or ''ayazan'', sanctuaries dedicated to a specific divinity, constructed in honor of the patron saint/angel of an individual or family and included an icon or effigy of the honored.  The second were the ''atroshan'', the "places of burning fire", which as Boyce (1997:ch. 3) notes, became more and more prevalent as the iconoclastic movement gained support. Following the rise of the Sassanid dynasty, the shrines to the [[Yazatas]] continued to exist, with the statues—by law—either being abandoned as empty sanctuaries, or being replaced by fire altars (so also the popular shrines to Meher/[[Mithra]] which retained the name ''Darb-e Mehr''—Mithra's Gate—that is today one of the Zoroastrian technical terms for a fire temple).

Also, as Schippman observed (''loc. Cit.'' Boyce, 1975:462), even during the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid era]] (226–650 CE) there is no evidence that the fires were categorized according to their sanctity. "It seems probable that there were virtually only two, namely the ''Atash-i Vahram'' [literally: "victorious fire", later misunderstood to be the Fire of Bahram, see Gnoli, 2002:512] and the lesser ''Atash-i Adaran'', or 'Fire of Fires', a parish fire, as it were, serving a village or town quarter" (Boyce, 1975:462; Boyce 1966:63). Apparently, it was only in the ''Atash-i Vahram'' that fire was kept continuously burning, with the ''Adaran'' fires being annually relit. While the fires themselves had special names, the structures did not, and it has been suggested that "the prosaic nature of the middle Persian names (''kadag'', ''man'', and ''xanag'' are all words for an ordinary house) perhaps reflect a desire on the part of those who fostered the temple-cult [...] to keep it as close as possible in character to the age-old cult of the hearth-fire, and to discourage elaboration" (Boyce, 2002:9).

The Indian [[Parsi people|Parsi]]-Zoroastrian practice of rendering the term ''athornan'' (derived from the Avestan language "athravan") as "fire-priest" in the English language is based on the mistaken assumption that the ''athra*'' prefix derives from ''atar'' (Boyce, 2002:16–17). The term ''athravan'' does not appear in the Gathas, where a priest is a ''zaotar'', and in its oldest attested use (''Yasna'' 42.6) the term appears to be synonymous with "missionary". In the later ''Yasht'' 13.94, Zoroaster himself is said to have been an ''athravan'', which in this context could not be a reference to ''atar'' if a cult of fire and its associated priesthood did not yet exist in Zoroaster's time. Thus, in all probability, "the word athravan has a different derivation" (Boyce, 2002:17) Compare this however with the Sanskrit [[wikt:अथर्वन्#Sanskrit|अथर्वन्]] (''atharvan''), and the content of [[Atharvaveda|Atharva-véda]].  &lt;!-- NEED HELP: need *citable* parallels between Vedic ''atharvan'' == Avestan ''ashavan''. XXX ''Asron'', the name of the social class of priests during the Sassanid era is derived from middle Persian ''ashava'', "the righteous" or "the just" which is in turn the MP equivalent of Avestan ashavan; see also relationship (in texts) between Atar to Asha Vahishta --&gt;

===In mythology and folklore===
In ''Vendidad'' 1, ''Adar'' battles [[Zahhak|Aži Dahāka]], the great dragon of the sky.

In [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnameh]], Hoshang, the grandson of the first man ''Gayomard'', discovers fire in a rock. He recognizes it as the divine glory of God, offers homage to it, and instructs his people to so as well. Also in the Shahnameh is the legend of Sevavash, who passes through "the unburning fire" as proof of his innocence.

===As a royal symbol===
[[Image:Silver coin of Ardashir I.jpg|300px|thumb|Silver coin of [[Ardashir I]] with a fire altar on its verso.]]
During the Sassanid era (226–650 CE), the symbol of Fire plays much the same role that the winged sun [[Faravahar]] did during the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid period]] (648–330 BCE). Beginning with Ardashir I, the founder of the Sassanid Empire, many of the kings of the dynasty issued one or more coins with a symbol of Fire on the verso, and seals and bullae with the fire symbol were common. &lt;!-- for a summary, see Unvala:44–74 --&gt;

[[Image:YazdII.jpg|300px|thumb|Silver coin of [[Yazdegerd II]] with a fire with two attendants.]]
The first silver coins of the empire have helmeted busts of [[Ardashir I]] (''r.'' 226–241) or his father Papak on the obverse (a figure of the ruling monarch on the obverse is consistent throughout the dynasty), with a representation of a fire altar, accompanied by the legend ''atash i artakhshir'', "Fire of Ardeshir", on the reverse. Ardashir's son, [[Shapur I]] (''r.'' 241–272), has much the same image but adds two attendants at the fire altar. On the coins of [[Hormizd I]] (also known as Ardashir II, ''r.'' 272–273), the emperor himself tends the fire with the help of an attendant. [[Bahram II]] (276–293) also appears himself, accompanied by what may be his queen and son. [[Narseh]] (''r.'' 293–303) also attends the fire himself, this time alone.  On the coins of [[Shapur III]] (''r.'' 283–388), a divinity appears to be emerging from the fire. The shape of the fire altar in the coins of [[Yazdegerd II]] (''r.'' 438–457) are similar to those in present-day fire temples. The legend introduced under Ardeshir yields to a mint mark and year of issue under [[Peroz I|Peroz]] (''r.'' 457–484), a feature evident in all the coins of the remaining dynasty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="40091">'''Christian vegetarianism''' is a [[Christianity|Christian]] practice based on effecting the compassionate teachings of [[Jesus]], the [[twelve apostles]], and the [[early church]] to all sentient or living beings through [[vegetarianism]] or [[veganism]]. Alternatively, Christians may be vegetarian for ethical, environmental, nutritional, or other spiritual reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911171934/http://www.caninestyle.co.uk/cvauk/pdf/sgwk1.PDF |title=Why a Vegetarian Diet? |author=Christian Vegetarian Association UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christian-ecology.org.uk/vegetarianism.htm |title=Vegetarianism |author=Christian Ecology Link }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various church founders have recommended vegetarianism, such as [[John Wesley]] the founder of the [[Methodist Church]]es, [[William Cowherd]] from the [[Bible Christian Church (vegetarian)|Bible Christian Church]] and [[Ellen G.

==Origins==

===Old Testament===
{{See also|Jewish vegetarianism}}
[[File:Sixth Commandment (Temple Church, London).jpg|right|thumb|[[Thou shalt not kill]], a [[moral imperative]] included as one of the [[Ten Commandments]].]]
While vegetarianism is not a common practice in current western Christian thought and culture, the concept and practice has scriptural and historical support. According to the [[Bible]], in the beginning, before the [[Fall of Man|Fall]], human and nonhuman animals, who are beings who have or are an ''ānima'', Latin for ''[[soul]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=animal|accessdate=11 August 2011|author=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soul&gt;{{cite web|title=Animals Are Also Living Souls|url=http://bewaredeception.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:animals-are-also-living-souls&amp;catid=1:articles&amp;Itemid=3|accessdate=23 September 2011|author=John Vujicic}}&lt;/ref&gt; were completely vegan, and "it was very good".&lt;sup&gt;[{{Bibleverse||Genesis|1:29-31|}}]&lt;/sup&gt; According to some interpretations of the Bible, [[raw veganism]] was the original diet of humankind in the form given to [[Adam and Eve]] by [[God]] in Genesis 1:29, "And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food".

Immediately after the Flood, God permitted the eating of meat,&lt;sup&gt;[{{bibleref|Genesis|9:3}}]&lt;/sup&gt; but forbade consuming "blood, which is life".&lt;sup&gt;[{{bibleref|Genesis|9:4}}]&lt;/sup&gt; However, some maintain that God permitted the consumption of meat only ''temporarily'' because all plants had been destroyed as a result of the flood,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishveg.com/torah.html&lt;/ref&gt; despite the lack of any reference to this in Genesis itself. Christian vegetarians interpret that passage not as a free pass to kill for eating if the blood is supposedly excluded from alimentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Lost Religion of Jesus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7LfL6E50ZWgC&amp;pg=PA240|author=Keith Akers|page=240|quote=[[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], ''Ecclesiastical History'' 5.1.26, reports an early Christian martyr who interpreted the prohibition of the blood of animals to imply vegetarianism. [[Marcus Minucius Felix|Minucius Felix]] refers to bloodshed in the arena and the blood of animals in the same breath (''Octavius'' 29.6). [[Tertullian]] points out that Christians are forbidden both human and animal blood (Apology 9). Sandmel states that blood could refer either to the blood of a sacrificed animal or to human violence: ''Judaism and Christian Beginnings'', p. 408.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as an invitation (rhetoric or not) to [[Necrophagy#As a human behaviour|necrophagy]]. "The biological fact is: no matter what you do you can never remove all the blood from the flesh of a slaughtered animal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did God allow Noah to eat meat?|url=http://bewaredeception.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12:did-god-really-allow-noah-to-eat-meat&amp;catid=1:articles&amp;Itemid=3|author=John Vujicic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commentary on Genesis 9:2-4 - : Comments and Discussions|url=http://www.all-creatures.org/discuss/genesis9.2-4-jv.html|author=All-creatures.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the [[Ten Commandments]] says categorically, "[[Thou shalt not kill]]" — without specifying that some animals are allowed to be killed. Isaiah states "He that killeth an ox [is as if] he slew a man."&lt;sup&gt;[{{bibleref|Isaiah|66:3}}]&lt;/sup&gt; However, specific sacrifices of animals for the atonement of sin were also mandated, by [[Moses#Mosaic law|Moses]], what may be inconsistent with the principle of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] or that one cannot force God to forgive. When the Moabite king [[Mesha Stele|Mesha]] [[Human sacrifice#Prohibition in major religions|offered]] in a [[Holocaust (sacrifice)|holocaust]] "his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead" in order that his army were spared in a war against Israel, the Israelites felt so outraged, that they decided to stop the battle "and returned to their own land".&lt;sup&gt;[{{Bibleverse|2Kings|3:27}}]&lt;/sup&gt;

Centuries after Noah, {{Bibleverse||Leviticus|11}} records God giving the Israelites rules about what types of meat may be eaten, suggesting that certain meats were acceptable. The Old Testament says that God commanded the Israelites to eat meat on some occasions. During the Exodus out of Egypt and the first Passover, God commanded that all of the Israelites to slaughter a Passover lamb and eat it. This was to be a lasting tradition.&lt;sup&gt;[{{bibleref|Exodus|12:24}}]&lt;/sup&gt; The sacrifices (including the [[Passover#Korban Pesach|Paschal Lamb]]), however, are considered as [[Typology (theology)|types]] of the [[Agnus Dei|Lamb of God]], an ''innocent'' victim, tortured and murdered.

The Israelites tired of [[manna]], a food of which "The Rabbis of the [[Talmud]] held that […] had whatever taste and flavor the eater desired at the time of eating"&lt;ref name=manna&gt;{{cite book|title=Judaism and vegetarianism|year=2001|publisher=Lantern Books|isbn=978-1-930051-24-9|pages=6, 7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zo5TqKQVcEgC&amp;pg=PA6|author=Richard H. Schwartz|edition=3, revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which probably was not an animal product&lt;ref name=soul/&gt; and was offered to them by God during [[The Exodus]].&lt;sup&gt;[{{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:4-10|}}]&lt;/sup&gt; They preferred meat, and were condemned for it.&lt;sup&gt;[{{Bibleverse||Numbers|11:32-34|}}]&lt;/sup&gt; Because of that lust, the place where the incident happened became known as ''[[Kibroth Hattaavah]]''.&lt;ref name=manna/&gt;

A donkey temporarily given the ability to speak showed [[Balaam#Balaam and the donkey|Balaam]] more than signs of [[Sentience#Animal rights and sentience|sentience]].&lt;sup&gt;[{{Bibleverse||Numbers|22:21-33|}}]&lt;/sup&gt;

Some Christians believe that the ''Bible'' explains that, in the future, human and nonhuman animals will return to veganism, regarded by [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|animal abolitionists]] as the moral baseline of [[Animal rights#Gary Francione: Abolitionism|animal rights]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About {{!}} Animal Rights: The Abolitionist Approach|url=http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/about/|accessdate=22 May 2011|author=Gary Francione}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|[…] The cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. […] They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the {{smallcaps|Lord}}|{{Bibleverse||Isaiah|11:6-9|kjv}}}}

Some people believe that the [[Book of Daniel]] also specifically promotes veganism as empowering. Daniel specifically refuses the king's "meat" (''paṯbaḡ'', [[Strong's Concordance|Strong]]'s #5698&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/hebrewenglishlex00browuoft#page/834/mode/1up {{smallcaps|bdb}}], p. 834.&lt;/ref&gt;) and instead requests vegetables (''zērōʿîm'', Strong's #2235&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/hebrewenglishlex00browuoft#page/283/mode/1up {{smallcaps|bdb}}], p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;sup&gt;[{{bibleref|Daniel|1:8–16}}]&lt;/sup&gt; However, current common theology argues that in this instance Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah are rejecting food that is considered to be unholy by their faith (eating food that had been sacrificed to pagan gods), and not meat ''per se'', despite that "at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king's meat".&lt;sup&gt;[{{Bibleverse||Daniel|1:15|}}]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Philo]] says that the [[Essenes]], “being more scrupulous than any in the worship of God […] do not [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice animals]] […], but hold it right to dedicate their own hearts as a worthy offering”. They maintained that the sacrifices "polluted" the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]].&lt;ref name=Lightfoot&gt;{{cite book|title=St. Paul's epistles to the Colossians and to Philemon : a revised text with introductions, notes, and dissertations|publisher=Macmillan|author=J.B.

===New Testament===
According to {{bibleref|Luke|24:41-43}}, Jesus ate fish himself after his resurrection, what could be explained by the so-called "[[Synoptic Gospels#Composition|synoptic]] principle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Jesus Eat Fish? (Luke 24:41-43)|url=http://www.all-creatures.org/discuss/didjesuseatfish-jv.html|accessdate=20 January 2011|author=John Vujicic}} Also available on the author's [http://bewaredeception.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=11:did-jesus-eat-fish&amp;catid=1:articles&amp;Itemid=3 website]; retrieved 2011-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Christian / Vegetarian Dialogue|url= http://www.compassionatespirit.com/wpblog/?s=%22Christian+%2F+Vegetarian+Dialogue%22 |accessdate= 2016-08-11 |author=Keith Akers|quote=The central issue for the vegetarian community is what has been called the "ethical" issue […] ''ethical vegetarianism is incompatible with the orthodox view of a meat-eating Jesus''}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to {{bibleref|Proverbs|12:10|kjv}}, "A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel."

Luke's [[Acts of the Apostles]] portrays a story where the [[Apostle Peter]] [[Peter's vision of a sheet with animals|has a vision]] where God declares previously unclean meat as "clean"&lt;sup&gt;[{{bibleref|Acts|10:7-16}}]&lt;/sup&gt; and orders Peter to "kill and eat". Christian vegetarians maintain that "Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the dream might mean".&lt;sup&gt;[{{Bibleverse||Acts|10:17|}}]&lt;/sup&gt; John Vujicic argues that "In the sheet were also so called CLEAN animals. Peter could have at least selected some sheep or cattle and killed but he didn’t. Simply because he considered all flesh defiled and unclean. Peter was vegetarian as he himself states in [[Clementine literature|Clementine Homilies]]. […] Peter would not kill any of them because he knew that this vision had another meaning […]. Any animal which is slaughtered is defiled and its meat defiles. Peter explains this in Clementine Homilies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Jesus Eat Fish? (Luke 24:41-43) Comments|url=http://www.all-creatures.org/discuss/didjesuseatfish-20090917-jv.html|accessdate=20 January 2011|author=John Vujicic|date=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recognized its meaning when the [[gentile]] [[Cornelius the Centurion|Cornelius]] invited him to dinner. Peter realized that the dream was instructing him not to go out and eat meat, but to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles. The [[Unclean animals#Judaism|Jewish dietary laws]] should not prevent the spread of Christianity, and, at Cornelius' dinner, Peter related to his hosts, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit any one of another nation; but God has shown me that I should not call any man common or unclean."&lt;sup&gt;[{{Bibleverse||Acts|10:28|}}]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=cva&gt;{{cite web|author=Christian Vegetarian Association|title=Honoring God’s Creation -- Replies|url=http://www.all-creatures.org/cva/hgc-replies.htm|accessdate=31 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Christian leaders, both ancient and modern, observe that vegetarianism was and is a sincere part of Christian faith. The Reverend [[Andrew Linzey]] has supported the historical view that Jesus was a vegetarian. In his book, ''The Lost Religion of Jesus'', author Keith Akers presents evidence that the [[historical Jesus]] was vegetarian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compassionatespirit.com/was_jesus_a_vegetarian.htm |title=Was Jesus a vegetarian?|author=Keith Akers |accessdate=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Christianity==

===New Testament===
In the Acts of the Apostles, the author recounts that the [[Council of Jerusalem|Jerusalem Council]] recommended (at least for Gentile Christians) abstention "from things strangled, and from blood".&lt;sup&gt;[{{bibleref|Acts|15:19–20}}]&lt;/sup&gt; Vegetarianism appears to have been a point of contention within [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] circles. Within the Bible's [[New Testament]], the [[Apostle Paul]] appears to ridicule vegetarians, arguing that people of "weak faith" "eat only vegetables",&lt;sup&gt;[{{bibleref|Romans|14:1–4}}]&lt;/sup&gt; although he also warns believers to "stop passing judgment on one another" when it comes to food in verse 13 and "[It is] good neither to eat flesh" in verse 21. Paul also said, "The Spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons. Such teachings come through hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron. They […] order […] to abstain from certain foods".&lt;sup&gt;[{{bibleref|1Timothy|4:1–3|NIV}}]&lt;/sup&gt; According to the [[Christian Vegetarian Association]], Paul was not referring to vegetarianism, which was not an issue in those times, but to the practice of not eating meat from the meat market because of fear that (like the above issue involving Daniel) it were sacrificed to an idol.&lt;sup&gt;[{{bibleref|1Corinthians|10:19-29}}]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=cva/&gt; "Wherefore, if meat [''brōma'', Strong's #1033,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BibleLexicon.org|url=http://biblelexicon.org/1_corinthians/8-13.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'anything used as food'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greek-English lexicon of the New Testament|year=1887|url=https://archive.org/stream/greekenglishlex00grimuoft#page/106/mode/1up}} Translated by [[Joseph Henry Thayer]].&lt;/ref&gt;] make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend."&lt;sup&gt;{{bibleref|1Corinthians|8:13|KJV}}&lt;/sup&gt;

===Patristic evidence===
In the 4th Century some [[Jewish Christian]] groups maintained that Jesus was himself a vegetarian. [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] quotes the [[Gospel of the Ebionites]] where Jesus has a confrontation with the high priest. Jesus chastises the leadership saying, "I am come to end the sacrifices and feasts of blood; and if ye cease not offering and eating of flesh and blood, the wrath of God shall not cease from you; even as it came to your fathers [[Kibroth Hattaavah|in the wilderness]], who lusted for flesh, and did sat to their content, and were filled with rottenness, and the plague consumed them."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gabriel Cousens|title=Conscious Eating|date=2000|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=9781556432859|pages=385–386|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XsBJnpCwWLYC&amp;pg=PA385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Joseph Barber Lightfoot|Lightfoot]], "the Christianized Essennes […] condemned the slaughter of victims on grounds very different from those alleged in the [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Epistle of Hebrews]], not because they have been superseded by the [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]], but because they are in their very nature repulsive to God; not because they have ceased to be right, but because they never were right from the beginning".&lt;ref name=Lightfoot/&gt;

Other early Christian historical documents observe that many influential Christians during the formative centuries of Christianity were vegetarian, though certainly not all. The ''Clementine homilies'', a second-century work purportedly based on the teachings of the [[Apostle Peter]], states, "The unnatural eating of flesh meats is as polluting as the heathen worship of devils, with its sacrifices and its impure feasts, through participation in it a man becomes a fellow eater with devils."&lt;ref&gt;Homily XII&lt;/ref&gt;

Although early Christian vegetarianism appears to have been downplayed in favor of more "modern" Christian culture, the practice of vegetarianism appears to have been very widespread in early Christianity, both in the leadership and among the laity. [[Origen]]'s work ''[[Contra Celsum]]'' quotes [[Celsus]] commenting vegetarian practices among &lt;!--some?--&gt; Christians he had contact with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celsus' view of Christians and Christianity |url=http://www.bluffton.edu/~humanities/1/celsus.htm |accessdate=5 November 2011 |author=Gerald Schlabach |quote=If in obedience to the traditions of their fathers they abstain from such victims, they must also abstain from all animal food, in accordance with the opinions of Pythagoras, who thus showed his respect for the soul and its bodily organs. But if, as they say, they abstain that they may not eat along with demons, I admire their wisdom, in having at length discovered, that whenever they eat they eat with demons, although they only refuse to do so when they are looking upon a slain victim; for when they eat bread, or drink wine, or taste fruits, do they not receive these things, as well as the water they drink and the air they breathe, from certain demons, to whom have been assigned these different provinces of nature? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080126101021/http://www.bluffton.edu/~humanities/1/celsus.htm |archivedate=26 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not vegetarian himself and vehemently against the idea that Christians must be vegetarians, [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] nevertheless wrote that those Christians who "abstain both from flesh and from wine" are "without number".&lt;ref&gt;''On the Morals of the Catholic Church'' 33.

==Churches and movements==
The [[Bible Christian Church (vegetarian)|Bible Christian Church]] founded by Reverend [[William Cowherd]] in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref name="desc"/&gt; Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the [[Vegetarian Society]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of [[Temperance (virtue)|temperance]].&lt;ref name=oxford&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/101006496/|title=William Cowherd (brief information)|publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cowherd emphasized that vegetarianism was good for health, whilst eating meat was unnatural and likely to cause aggression. Later he is reputed to have said "If God had meant us to eat meat, then it would have come to us in edible form [as is the ripened fruit]."&lt;ref name=history /&gt;
[[File:Egw1899.jpg|thumb|[[Ellen G. White]], vegetarian and co-founder of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].]]
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] present a health message that recommends vegetarianism and expects abstinence from pork, shellfish and other foods proscribed as "unclean" in [[Leviticus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/statements/main_stat5.html Caring for Creation - A Statement on the Environment&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of the founders of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, including [[Joseph Bates (Adventist)|Joseph Bates]] and [[Ellen White]] adopted a vegetarian diet during the nineteenth century, and Ellen White reportedly received visions regarding the health benefits of a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref&gt;White, Arthur. ''Ellen G. White Volume 2: The Progressive Years 1862–1876'', Review &amp; Herald Publishing, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in California have been involved in research into longevity due to their healthy lifestyle, which includes maintaining a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.llu.edu/llu/health/mortality.html Loma Linda University Adventist Health Study: Mortality&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This research has been included within a ''National Geographic'' article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0511/feature1/index.html Longevity, The Secrets of Long Life - ''National Geographic'' Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Another denomination with common origin, the [[Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement]] recommends vegetarianism as a part of fellowship, with many of its members being practicing vegans as well.  Typically, however, these sabbatarian pro-vegetarian Christian fellowships do not "require vegetarianism as a test of fellowship."{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The [[Word of Wisdom]] is a dietary law given to adherents of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] (also known as [[Mormonism]]), which states that "flesh also of beasts and of fowls of the air... are to be used sparingly," and that "it is pleasing unto [God] that they should not be used, only in times of winter, or of cold, or famine".&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|89|12|13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike injunctions against tobacco and alcohol, compliance with this part of the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] has never been made mandatory by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the largest Latter Day Saint denomination. Many LDS Church leaders have expressed their views on the subject of meat, but since [[Joseph F. Smith]] became church president in 1901, emphasis on refraining from meat has largely been dropped.&lt;ref name = Alexander&gt;[[Thomas G.

Some members of the [[Religious Society of Friends]] (also known as Quakers) practice vegetarianism or veganism as a reflection of the [[Peace Testimony]], extending non-violence towards animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vegetarianfriends.net/ |title=Vegetarian Friends |author=VegetarianFriends.net }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the early vegetarian movement had many Quaker promoters. Some [[Ranter]] sects back in the mid-17th century are known to have been vegetarian as well.

[[Roman Catholic]] monastic orders such as the [[Carthusians]] and [[Cistercians]] follow a strict vegetarian diet. [[Carmelites]] and others following the Rule of St. Albert also maintain a vegetarian diet, although the old and sick are permitted to eat meat according to this rule of life. [[St. Francis of Paola]] became a vegan, and veganism was a rule of the order he founded, the [[Order of Minims]]. However, [[Pope John III]] declared an [[anathema]] against the [[Priscillian]] vegetarian priests at the [[First Council of Braga]] in Portugal. (Not necessarily against vegetarianism but because it was related to the Priscillian heresy).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02729a.htm "Catholic Encyclopaedia - Councils of Braga"]. ''New Advent''. Quote: "That all priests who abstained from eating meat should be obliged to eat vegetables cooked in meat, to avoid all suspicion of the taint of [[Priscillianism]], and that if they refused they should be excommunicated."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.benedictus.mgh.de/quellen/chga/chga_057t.htm "Synodus Bracarensis prima"]. ''Benedictus Levita''. Quote: "XIII.

[[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]], such as [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], and [[Théodore Monod]], extend the Christian principles of compassion and [[nonviolence]] through following a vegetarian diet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/tolstoy/|title=History of Vegetarianism - Leo Tolstoy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Book of Ammon |last=Hennacy |first=Ammon |authorlink=Ammon Hennacy |year=1965 |publisher=Hennacy |location= |page=125 |pages= |url= |quote=I had been vegetarian since 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olMgmIYuMPYC&amp;pg=PA192|title=Four centuries of geological travel|author=Geological Society of London|year=2007|quote=Monod became a vegetarian and an ardent pacifist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Rastafari movement|Rastafaris]] abstain from all flesh whatsoever, asserting that to touch meat is to touch death, and is therefore a violation of the [[Nazirite]] vow.

The [[Christian Vegetarian Association]] (CVA) is an international, non-denominational Christian vegetarian organization that promotes responsible stewardship of God's creation through plant-based eating.&lt;ref name=calvert&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Taste of Eden: Modern Christianity and Vegetarianism|author=Samantha Jane Calvert|journal=The Journal of Ecclesiastical History|volume=58|issue=3|pages=461–481|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1218156|quote=Christian Vegetarian Association|doi=10.1017/s0022046906008906}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CVA produced the 2006 film ''Honoring God’s Creation''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.godtube.com/watch/?v=J2BE2JNU Honoring God's Creation]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partial fasting and temporary abstinence==
During [[Lent]] some Christian communities, such as [[Orthodoxy by country|Orthodox]] [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christians in the Middle East]], undertake partial [[fasting]] eating only one light meal per day.&lt;ref name=mezze&gt;{{cite book|title=Mezze to Milk Tart|author=Cecile Yazbek|year=2011|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Ksz4ci9hlEC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; For strict [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] Christians and [[Fasting and abstinence of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Copts]], all meals during this 40-day period are prepared without animal products and are essentially vegan.&lt;ref name=mezze /&gt; Unlike veganism however, abstaining from animal products during Lent is intended to be only temporary and not a permanent way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Goodlife: Egyptian Christians (Copts) on Lenten fasting and penance|author=Noel James Debien|date=February 26, 2012 |publisher=[[ABC Local Radio]]|url=http://www.abc.net.au/sundaynights/stories/s3440723.htm|quote=The vegan lenten fast of Egypt's native Christian community}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastern Orthodox laity traditionally abstains from animal products on Wednesdays (because, according to Christian tradition, Judas betrayed Jesus on the [[Holy Wednesday|Wednesday prior to the Crucifixion of Jesus]]) and Fridays (because Jesus is thought to have been crucified on the subsequent Friday), as well as during the four major fasting periods of the year: [[Great Lent]], the [[Apostles' Fast]], the [[Dormition Fast]] and the [[Nativity Fast]]. Catholic laity traditionally abstain from animal flesh on Fridays and through the Lenten season leading up to [[Easter]] (sometimes being required to do so by law, see [[fasting and abstinence in the Roman Catholic Church]]), some also, as a matter of private piety, observe Wednesday abstinence. ''Fish'' is not considered proper meat in any case (see [[pescetarianism]], though the Eastern Orthodox allow fish only on days on which the fasting is lessened but meat still not allowed). For these practices, "animal rights" are no motivation and positive environmental or individual-health effects only a surplus benefit; the actual reason is to practice [[mortification of the flesh|mortification]] and some marginal [[asceticism]].

[[Oriental Orthodox Church|Oriental Orthodox]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and [[Eastern Catholic]] monastics abstain from meat year-round, and many abstain from dairy and seafood as well. Through obedience to the Orthodox Church and its ascetic practices,&lt;ref&gt;Disclaimer: "The meaning of asceticism discourses is complex." The word, however, is frequently used in a derogatory way against the veg(etari)an movement. ''Characterizing veganism as asceticism'', pp. 141–142. In: {{cite journal|author=Matthew Cole|author2=Karen Morgan|title=[[Vegaphobia]]: derogatory discourses of veganism and the reproduction of speciesism in UK national newspapers|journal=The British Journal of Sociology|year=2011|volume=62|issue=1|doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2010.01348.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Orthodox Christian seeks to rid himself or herself of the ''passions'', or the disposition to sin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]] rules concerning fasting go from full abstinence to meat on every Friday and Wednesday to only Fridays during Lent.
In the Eastern Churches of India such as the Indian Orthodox Church, Jacobite Church and Marthoma Church, the bishops and metrapolitans take the vow to remain vegetarian throughout their life.

'''Christianity and other religions''' documents [[Christianity]]'s relationship with other world religions, and the differences and similarities.

==Christian views on religious pluralism==

===Classical Christian view ===
Evangelical Christians believe that [[religious pluralism]] is heresy and contradicts the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegospelcoalition.org/about/foundation-documents/confessional/ Foundation Documents: Confessional Statement] By [[The Gospel Coalition]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some Christians have argued that religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept. Maximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others. Some, but by no means all, Christians hold such pluralism to be logically impossible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianministriesintl.org/articles/12.html Defending Salvation Through Christ Alone] By Jason Carlson, Christian Ministries International&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman Catholicism]] believes that while it is the fullest and most complete revelation of God to Man, other Christian denominations have also received genuine revelation from God, although partial and incomplete.{{Clarify|date=July 2011}}

===Calvinist Christian views===
Although [[Calvinist]]s believe God and the truth of God cannot be plural, they also believe that those civil ordinances of man which restrain man from evil and encourage toward good, are ordinances of God (regardless of the religion, or lack of it, of those who wield that power). Christians are obligated to be at peace with all men, as far as it is up to them, and to submit to governments for the Lord's sake, and to pray for enemies.

Calvinism is not pacifistic and Calvinists have been involved in religious wars, notably the [[French Wars of Religion]] and the [[English Civil War]]. Some of the first parts of modern Europe to practice religious tolerance had Calvinistic populations, notably the Netherlands.

===Eastern Orthodox views===
{{See also|Eastern Orthodoxy and Judaism}}

===Modern (post-Enlightenment) Christian views===
In recent years, some Christian groups have become more open to religious pluralism; this has led to many cases of reconciliation between Christians and people of other faiths. The liberalization of many Seminaries and theological institutions, particularly in regards to the rejection of the notion that the Bible is an infallible document, has led to a much more human-centered and secular movement within Mainline Christian denominations, particularly in the United States. Some Mainline churches no longer hold to [[exclusivist]] views on salvation.

In recent years there has been much to note in the way of reconciliation between some Christian groups and the Jewish people. Many modern day Christians, including many Catholics and some liberal Protestants, have developed a view of the New Testament as an extended covenant; they believe that [[Jew]]s are still in a valid relationship with God, and that Jews can avoid damnation and earn a heavenly reward. For these Christians, the New Testament extended God's original covenant to cover non-Jews. The article [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]] deals with this issue in detail.

Multiple smaller Christian groups in the US and Canada have come into being over the last 40 years, such as "Christians for Israel". Their website says that they exist in order to "expand Christian-Jewish dialogue in the broadest sense in order to improve the relationship between Christians and Jews, but also between Church and Synagogue, emphasizing Christian repentance, the purging of anti-Jewish preliminary attitudes and the false 'Replacement' theology rampant throughout Christian teachings."

A number of large Christian groups, including the Catholic Church and several large Protestant churches, have publicly declared that they will no longer [[proselytize]] Jews.

Other Modern Christian views, including some conservative [[Protestantism|Protestants]], reject the idea of the New Testament as an extended covenant, and retain the classical Christian view as described earlier.

===Modern views specific to Catholicism===
{{Main|Catholic Church and ecumenism}}
For the Catholic Church, there has been a move at reconciliation not only with Judaism, but also [[Islam]].  The [[Second Vatican Council]] states that salvation includes others who acknowledge the same creator, and explicitly lists Muslims among those (using the term [[Mohammedanism|Mohammedans]], which was the word commonly used among non-Muslims at the time).  The official Catholic position is therefore that Jews, Muslims and Christians (including churches outside of Rome's authority) all acknowledge the same God, though Jews and Muslims have not yet received the gospel while other churches are generally considered deviant to a greater or lesser degree.

The most prominent event in the way of dialogue between religions has arguably been the 1986 Peace Prayer in [[Assisi]] to which Pope [[John Paul II]], against considerable resistance also from within the [[Roman Catholic]] church, invited representatives of all world religions. John Paul II’s remarks regarding Christian denominations were found in his [[Ut unum sint]] address. This initiative was taken up by the [[Community of Sant'Egidio]], who, with the support of John Paul II, organized yearly peace meetings of religious representatives. These meetings, consisting of round tables on different issues and of a common time of prayer has done much to further understanding and friendship between religious leaders and to further concrete peace initiatives. In order to avoid the reproaches of [[syncretism]] that were leveled at the 1986 Assisi meeting where the representatives of all religions held one common prayer, the follow-up meetings saw the representatives of the different religions pray in different places according to their respective traditions.

The question of whether traditional Chinese ancestor veneration, consists of worshipping a God or veneration of a saint was important to the [[Roman Catholic]] church during the [[Chinese Rites controversy]] of the early 18th century. This dispute was between the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s who argued that Confucianism and Chinese folk religion was worship, and therefore incompatible with Catholicism, and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] who argued the reverse. The [[pope]] ultimately ruled in favor of the Dominicans, a decision which greatly reduced the role of Catholic missionaries in China. However, this decision was partially reversed by Pope [[Pius XII]] in 1939; after this, Chinese customs were no longer considered superstition or idolatry, but a way of honoring esteemed relatives (not entirely dissimilar to the Catholic practice of praying for the dead).

==Relationship with [[Sikhism]]==
Sikhs also believe in one God and follow the Ten Sikh Gurus, unlike Christians who believe in one Almighty God made up of three distinct persons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Known as the Trinity). However, there is no heaven or hell in the Sikh religion.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

==Relationship with [[Judaism]]==
{{See also|Christianity and Judaism|Judeo-Christian|Responsibility for the death of Jesus}}

Historically, the relationship between Christianity and Judaism has been strained. In the past, Christians were often taught that "the Jews" killed Christ, for which "murder" they bear a [[collective guilt]] (an interpretation which most major [[Christian denominations|denominations]] now reject). Jews meanwhile have tended to associate Christianity with various [[pogrom]]s, or in better times, with the dangers of [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. [[Anti-Semitism]] has a long history in Christianity (see [[Christianity and anti-Semitism]]), and indeed is far from dead (for example, in contemporary Russia). However, since the [[Holocaust]], much dialogue aimed at [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]] has taken place, and relations have greatly improved. Today, many conservative evangelicals support [[Christian Zionism]], much to the irritation of [[Arab Christians]], based partly on the [[Millennialism|Millennialist]] belief that the modern state of [[Israel]] represents the fulfillment of [[Bible prophecy|Biblical prophecy]].

The phenomenon of [[Messianic Judaism]] has become something of an irritant to Jewish / Christian relations{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}. Messianic Jews—who generally seek to combine a Jewish identity with the recognition of Jesus—are rejected by mainstream Jewish groups{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}, who dismiss Messianic Judaism as little more than Christianity with Jewish undertones.

The Jewish conception of the [[Jewish eschatology|messiah]] (משיח ''mashiach'' in Hebrew) holds certain similarities to that of Christians, yet there are substantial differences. According to [[Jew]]s, the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Scriptures]] contain a small number of prophecies concerning a future descendant of King [[David]], who will be anointed (Hebrew: moshiach) as the Jewish people's new leader and will establish the throne of David in Jerusalem forever. In the Jewish view, this fully human and mortal leader will rebuild the land of [[Israel]] and restore the Davidic Kingdom. This subject is covered in the section on [[Jewish eschatology]]. Some Christians have a different understanding of the term ''messiah'', and believe that Jesus is the messiah referred to in the [[Old Testament]] prophecies; that the kingdom in these prophecies was to be a [[Kingdom of God|heavenly kingdom]], not an earthly one; and that Jesus' words and actions in the New Testament provide evidence of his identity as messiah and that the remainder of [[messianic prophecy]] will be fulfilled in the [[Second Coming]]. Other Christians acknowledge the Jewish definition of ''messiah'', and hold that Jesus fulfills this, being 'fully man' (in addition to being 'fully God'), and believe that the Second Coming will establish the Kingdom of God on earth, where Jesus, as messiah and descendant from David, will reign from Jerusalem.

==Relationship with [[Islam]]==
{{See also|Christianity and Islam|Christian view of Muhammad|Christian influences in Islam}}

[[Islam]] shares a number of beliefs with Christianity. They share similar views on [[Last judgment|judgment]], heaven, hell, spirits, angels, and a [[Resurrection of the Dead|future resurrection]].  Jesus is acknowledged and respected by Muslims as a great prophet. However, while Islam relegates Jesus to a lesser status than God — "in the company of those nearest to God" in the [[Qur'an]], mainstream ([[Trinitarianism|Trinitarian]]) Christianity teaches without question that Jesus is [[God the Son]], one of the three [[Hypostases]] (common English: persons) of Christianity's [[Trinity]], divinely co-equal with the [[God the Father|Father]] and the [[Holy Spirit]].

The religions both share a belief in the [[virgin birth of Jesus]], his [[Miracles of Jesus|miracles]] and healings, and that he [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended bodily into heaven]]. However, Jesus is not accepted as the son by Muslims, who strictly maintain that he was a [[human being]] who was loved by God and exalted by God to ranks of the most righteous. They believe in God as a single entity, not as the Trinity accepted by the vast majority of Christians. Neither do Muslims accept Jesus' [[crucifixion]]. Since Muslims believe only in the worship of a strictly monotheistic God who never [[Incarnation|assumed human flesh]], they do not accept the use of [[icon]]s, and see this as [[shirk (idolatry)]]. Muslim influence played a part in the initiation of [[iconoclasm]] and their conquests caused the [[iconoclasm]] in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. For the same reason, they do not worship or pray to [[Muhammad]], [[Jesus]], or any other prophets; only to [[God]].

Adherents of Islam have historically referred to themselves, Jews, and Christians (among others) as [[People of the Book]] since they all base their religion on books that are considered to have a divine origin. Christians however neither recognize the [[Qur'an]] as a genuine book of divine revelation, nor agree with its assessment of Jesus as a mere prophet, on par with [[Muhammad]], nor for that matter accept that Muhammad was a genuine prophet.

Muslims, for their part, believe that parts of the Gospels, Torah and Jewish prophetic books have been forgotten, misinterpreted, or distorted by their followers. Based on that perspective, Muslims view the Qur'an as correcting the errors of Christianity. For example, Muslims reject belief in the [[Trinity]], or any other expression of the divinity of Jesus, as incompatible with monotheism.

Not surprisingly, the two faiths have often experienced controversy and conflict (an example being the [[Crusades]]). At the same time, much fruitful dialogue has occurred as well. The writings of Catholic theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] frequently cite those of the Jewish philosopher [[Moses Maimonides]], as well as Muslim thinker [[Averroes]] ('Ibn-Rushd).

On May 6, 2001 [[Pope John Paul II]], the first pope to pray in a [[mosque]], delivered an address at Umayyad Mosque in [[Damascus]], saying: "It is important that Muslims and Christians continue to explore philosophical and theological questions together, in order to come to a more objective and comprehensive knowledge of each other's religious beliefs. Better mutual understanding will surely lead, at the practical level, to a new way of presenting our two religions not in opposition, as has happened too often in the past, but in partnership for the good of the human family." This Mosque of Damascus is famous for containing the head of John the Baptist.

==Relations with Hinduism==
{{main|Christianity and Hinduism}}
Buddhism, Hinduism and Christianity differ on fundamental beliefs on [[heaven]], [[hell]] and [[reincarnation]], to name a few. From the Hindu perspective, heaven ([[Sanskrit]] ''[[svarga]]'') and hell (''[[Naraka (Hinduism)|Naraka]]'') are temporary places, where every [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] has to live, either for the good deeds done or for their [[sin]]s committed.

There also exist significant similarities in Christian and Hindu theology, most notably in that both religions present a trinitarian view of God. The Holy [[Trinity]] of Christianity, consisting of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, is sometimes seen as roughly analogous to the [[Trimurti]] of Hinduism, whose members -- [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]]—are seen as the three principal manifestations of [[Brahman]], or Godhead.

Christian-Hindu relations are a mixed affair. On one hand, Hinduism's natural tendency has been to recognize the divine basis of various other religions, and to revere their founders and saintly practitioners. In Western countries, [[Vedanta]] has influenced some Christian thinkers, while others in the anti-[[cult]] movement have reacted against the activities of immigrant [[gurus]] and their followers. (See also: [[Pierre Johanns]], [[Abhishiktananda]], [[Bede Griffiths]], [[Dalit theology]].)

The [[Christian Ashram Movement]], a movement within [[Christianity]] in [[India]], embraces [[Vedanta]] and the teachings of the East, attempting to combine the Christian faith with the Hindu [[ashram]] model and [[Christian monasticism]] with the Hindu ''[[sannyasa]]'' tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christian Ashram Movement]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations with [[Buddhism]]==
{{main|Buddhism and Christianity}}

In the 19th century, some scholars began to perceive similarities between Buddhist and Christian practices, e.g. in 1878 [[T.W. Rhys Davids]] wrote that the earliest missionaries to Tibet observed that similarities have been seen since the first known contact.&lt;ref name=Davids&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 1878 edition, article ''Buddhism'' by T.W. Rhys Davids&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 Ernest De Bunsen made similar observations in that with the exception of the death of Jesus on the cross, and of the Christian doctrine of atonement, the most ancient Buddhist records had similarities with the Christian traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Bunsen|first=Ernest|title=The Angel-Messiah of Buddhists, Essenes, and Christians|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tq4oAAAAYAAJ|year=1880|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Company|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] and [[Protestantism]] came into political conflict in 19th century [[Sri Lanka]] and in Tibet c. 1904 (the Francis Younghusband Expedition). Various events have cooperated to introduce various strains of Buddhist theology and meditation to several generations of Western spiritual seekers (including some Catholic religious). Relations are generally good between both religions, except perhaps in [[South Korea]] where Christians have damaged [[Korean Buddhist temples|Buddhist temples]] and engaged in other forms of [[Religious fanaticism|Christian extremism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 1390412|title = Questions for Buddhist and Christian Cooperation in Korea|journal = Buddhist-Christian Studies|volume = 17|pages = 179–195|last1 = Tedesco|first1 = Frank|year = 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian republic of [[Kalmykia]] recognizes both [[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]]/Lamaist Buddhism and Russian Orthodoxy as its official religions.

==Possible relationship with [[Zoroastrianism]] through Judaism==
&lt;!-- This section has been discussed at great length on the talk page and a vote &amp; consensus was reached; please do not edit before reviewing the discussions and talking with the community...thanks --&gt;
Many scholars{{ref|ZoroastrianismScholars}} believe the [[eschatology]] of [[Judaism]] and possibly the idea of [[monotheism]] originated in [[Zoroastrianism]], and may have been transferred to Judaism during the [[Babylonian captivity]], thus eventually influencing Christian theology. Bible scholar P.R. Ackroyd states: "the whole eschatological scheme, however, of the Last Judgment, rewards and punishments, etc., within which immortality is achieved, is manifestly Zoroastrian in origin and inspiration." {{ref|PeakesCommentary}} However, the theory is questioned by other mainstream historians and scholars. ''The Oxford History of the Biblical World'' states "There is little if any effect of Zoroastrian elements on Judaism in the Persian period."{{ref|OxfordHistoryOnZoroastrianism}}. Nevertheless, scholars such as Soloman Nigosian contend, in regarding the similar ideas of Zoroaster and later Jewish writers, that "the ideas were indigenous to Iran...it is hardly conceivable that some of the characteristic ideas and practices in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam came into being without Zoroastrian influence."{{ref|Nigosian}} The new faith (Zoroastrianism) emerged in larger Persian empires. " Zoroastrianism reflected the cosmopolitan society of the empires". During this time Zoroastrianism profoundly effected the beliefs and values of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam ("Traditions &amp; Encounters: A brief global History", Jerry H. Bentley. pg. 93). It is also possible that Zoroastrianism and later Jewish theology came from a common source.

''For more on this theory, see [[Jewish history]], [[Judaism]], and [[Zoroastrianism]].''

In the Younger [[Avesta]], three divinities of the Zoroastrian pantheon are repeatedly identified as ahuric, meaning that each, as [[Ahura]], act together in both representing and protecting [[Asha]], or the divine truth governing the universe. These three are [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Mithra]] and [[Burz]], and hence known as the "Ahuric triad."  Similarities with the Christian Trinity can be seen between Ahura Mazda and God the Father, Mithra and Christ the Logos, as well as between Burz and the Holy Spirit, both of which are associated symbolically with water.  Both Zoroastrianism and Christianity consider themselves to be monotheistic, but like all other monotheisms they have highlighted certain aspects or energies of the divine to emphasize, and these are not meant to be interpreted as separate divinities.  In both religions there are guardian [[angels]], or [[fravashi]], which are considered to be created beings and are distinct from the [[Energies of God]] or divine emanations.  The Zoroastrian term [[yazata]], however, has variously been interpreted as meaning emanations or "sparks" of the divine, or as being roughly synonymous with the term "angels."  There have been various theories on the possible relationship between these aspects of Zoroastrianism and ideas of divine emanation in [[esoteric Christianity]], Jewish [[Kabbalah]], Islamic mysticism ([[Sufism]]), and other religious systems, such as [[Gnosticism]], [[Yazidism]], and the [[Druze]], among others.

==Relationship with Paganism==
{{Main|Christianity and paganism}}

==Relationship with [[Mithraism]] and [[Sol Invictus]]==
&lt;!-- {{Contradict|section|about=whether or not Mithraism was known about before 100AD|date=March 2009}} There can be many arguments of a thing which does not make them contradictions as they are just that; arguments. Please see discussion page.--&gt;
There are many parallels between [[Mithraism]], the religion of [[Sol Invictus]], and Christianity. [[Aurelian]] is believed to have established the ''Dies Natalis Solis Invicti'' (Day of the Birth of Sol Invictus) as an annual festival{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} held on the day when the sun's daily [[declination]] visibly starts rising again after the [[winter solstice]], namely on December 25; the birth of the central figure was thus celebrated on the day which Christians later used to celebrate Jesus' birth (having always celebrated this at [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crivoice.org/cyepiph.html ] [http://www.religionfacts.com/christianity/holidays/epiphany.htm ] [http://www.navidadlatina.com/historia/ ] [https://navidad.es/la-historia-de-la-fiesta-de-navidad/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Other similarities include the stories of Christ and Mithra as children being visited by shepherds, the [[trinity]], and the immortal soul{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. Sunday itself was imposed as the official day of rest by [[Constantine I|Constantine]], who referred to it as the ''Day of the venerable Sun''{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. (Although Christians worshiped on Sunday from at least 150 years before Constantine)&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr, ''First Apology'', 67.3&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest attestation of Mithraism is [[Plutarch]]'s record of it being practised in 68BC by [[Cilician pirates]], the first mithraists.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pompey*.html Life of Pompey]'', 24.5&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tertullian]], a Christian writer who lived between the 2nd and 3rd centuries, admitted there was a strong similarity between the practises of the two faiths:
:''the devil, ... mimics even the essential portions of the divine sacraments...he baptises some, that is his own believers, ... he promises the forgiveness of sins... Mithraism, .... also celebrates the [[oblation]] of bread, and introduces a symbol of the resurrection...'' - Tertullian,&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:De praescriptione haereticorum|The Prescription Against Heretics]]'', 40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Martyr]], an earlier 2nd century [[Church Father]], agreed that the similarities existed, claiming that Mithraism had copied the [[Eucharist]].&lt;ref name="First Apology"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm First Apology], 66.4&lt;/ref&gt; Justin argued that the devil had invented Mithraism to mock Christianity.&lt;ref name="First Apology"/&gt; Christian apologist [[Ronald H. Nash]] stated:
:''allegations of an early Christian dependence on Mithraism have been rejected on many grounds. Mithraism had no concept of the death and resurrection of its god and no place for any concept of rebirth -- at least during its early stages...During the early stages of the cult, the notion of rebirth would have been foreign to its basic outlook...Moreover, Mithraism was basically a military cult. Therefore, one must be skeptical about suggestions that it appealed to nonmilitary people like the early Christians''. {{ref|Nash}}

==Relationship with the [[Bahá'í Faith]]==
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] believes that there is one God who sends [[Manifestation of God|divine messengers]] to guide humanity throughout time, which is called [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)]]—and is different from the Christian belief of [[Progressive revelation (Christian)]]. They believe in the divine knowledge and essence of [[Jesus]], among other messengers such as [[Muhammad]], [[Zoroaster]], [[Moses]], [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], and others. Interpretations vary, but the Bahá'í Faith is sometimes considered an [[Abrahamic faith]]. The followers of the Bahá'í Faith believe in God, as do Christians, and recognize Jesus' teachings, but they have different views of the [[Trinity]] and divinity of Jesus. The Bahá'í view of prophets is that although they have both human and divine characteristics, they are not themselves God, but rather "divine manifestations."  They also see the Trinity as symbolic where Jesus and the Holy Spirit are polished mirrors that reflect the pure light from God.  Although Bahá'ís affirm the Bible as sacred scripture, they do not consider the Bible to be wholly authentic as [[Shoghi Effendi]], the [[Guardian (Bahá'í Faith)|Guardian of the Bahá'í Faith]], affirmed that "The Bible is not wholly authentic, and in this respect not to be compared with the Qur’án, and should be wholly subordinated to the authentic Sayings of Bahá’u’lláh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Effendi  |first= Shoghi| authorlink = Shoghi Effendi |date= 1973 |title= Directives from the Guardian | chapter= 32: BIBLE (Authenticity of the)| chapter-url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/dg-32.html| url= http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/DG/  |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bahai-library.com/uhj_old_new_testaments|title= The Bible: Extracts on the Old and New Testaments |last1= Bahá'u'lláh,  Abdu'l-Bahá,  Shoghi Effendi, and  Universal House of Justice |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= Bahá'í Library Online |publisher= |access-date= November 6, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'ís share some views with Christianity regarding moral and immoral behavior. Bahá'ís condemn [[polygamy]], [[premarital sex]], and [[Homosexuality|homosexual acts]] while treating everyone, including homosexuals, with love, respect, and dignity. (See [[Homosexuality and Bahá'í Faith]].)

==Sociological aspects==
The spread of Christianity has been international, in some cases entirely displacing the religions and altering the customs encountered among those people to whom it has come. This centuries-long process has been met with violent opposition at times, and likewise the spread of Christianity has in some cases been carried out with martial force. The relationship of Christianity to other faiths is encumbered to some extent by this history, with modern Christians, particularly in the West, expressing embarrassment over the violence in Christianity's past.

[[Conversion to Christianity|Converting adherents of other religions]] is widely accepted within Christianity. Many Christian organizations believe that they have a duty to make converts among every people. In recent years, [[ecumenism]] and dialogue between different religions has been endorsed by many official representatives of the Christian churches, as a way of effecting reconciliation between Christian people and people of other faiths, leading to many cases of reconciliation. In some cases, this endorsement is accompanied by a complete disavowal of all proselytizing efforts under the banner of [[religious pluralism]].

This is specially marked by the inauguration, or installation, of Archbishop of York Dr [[John Sentamu]] from Uganda, on November 29, 2005. Dr Sentamu is the first black African archbishop of the Church of England. He is also the first archbishop to beat bongo drums in the cathedral at his own inauguration. The newspaper Guardian, which dedicated its double middle page of the following day to a full picture of the grinning archbishop in full apparel at the porch of the cathedral, says that:
"Dr Sentamu's sermon was a stern lecture to the Church of England to grow out of being a 'judgmental and moralising' congregation of 'pew-fillers, sermon-taters, Bible readers, even born-again believers and Spirit-filled charismatics' and go out to make friends in the world. 'We have lost the joy and power that makes real disciples and we've become consumers of religion, not disciples of Jesus-Christ', he said. 'Christians, go and make friends among Buddhists, Hindus, Jews, Muslims, Sikhs, agnostics, atheists, not for the purpose of converting them to your beliefs but for friendship, understanding, listening, hearing.' His remarks were greeted with applause, not with silence as the order of the service instructed."

A special case is the issue of [[Christian–Jewish reconciliation]], in which significant reconciliation has been reached.

===Syncretism===
{{main|Christian syncretism}}
Christian converts have often carried some of their previous customs to their new faith. This on occasion has led to [[religious syncretism|syncretism]]s, that are often not accepted by mainstream Christians:
*In Cuban [[Santería]], the West African [[orisha]]s are venerated in the shape of Catholic saints.
*The Chinese [[Taiping Rebellion]] put the Bible in the place of the [[Confucian classics]].
*The [[God's Army (revolutionary group)|God's Army]] of [[Myanmar]] mixed [[Karen people|Karen]] traditions with Protestantism.

Criticism of [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]] dates from the initial rift between the two primary denominations of Islam, the [[Sunni]] and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]]. The question of succession to [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], the nature of the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]], the status of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|twelfth Shia Imam]], and other areas in which Shia Islam differ from Sunni Islam have been criticized by Sunni scholars, even though there is no disagreement between the two regarding the centrality of the [[Quran]], [[Muhammad]], and many other doctrinal, theological and ritual matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiite commentators such as [[Musa al-Musawi]] and [[Ali Shariati]] have themselves, in their attempts to reform the faith, criticized practices and beliefs which have become prevalent in the Shiite community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Brunner|editor1-first=Rainer|editor2-last=Ende|editor2-first=Werner|title=The Twelver Shia in Modern Times: Religious Culture and Political History|date=2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004118034|page=178|quote=The intellectual history of Twelver Shia Islam in the 20th century has witnessed quite a few attempts by religious scholars and lay intellectuals at religious reform, which nearly inevitably meant criticism of existing practices. The reformers have concentrated on various aspects of Shia popular religion with a high symbolic value which determine the outward appearance of Shia Islam and its relation to mainstream Sunni Islam. Not least because of that strong symbolism they have deemed these practices to be against the true spirit of Shia Islam, even against the spirit of Islam itself.}}&lt;!--|accessdate=1 July 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Occultation==
{{main|Ghaybah}}
In the tradition of Twelver Shia Islam, the twelfth and final Shia Imam, [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who is also considered by Twelver Shia to be the prophesied redeemer of Islam known as the [[Mahdi]], went into [[Ghaybah|''ghaybah'' ("occultation")]] in 873. However, this belief has long been criticized by Sunni scholars who “often speculate that the twelfth Imam never existed, but was a myth designed to keep the Shia cause alive.”&lt;ref&gt;The Routledge Handbook of Religion and Security, by Chris Seiple, Dennis R. Hoover, Pauletta Otis, 2012, page 60&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, western scholars have also cast doubt upon the existence of an occulted Imam. According to Robert Gleave, the occultation of the 12th Imam “became subsequent orthodox doctrine” after none of the competing theories that sought to explain the succession to a childless [[Hasan al-Askari|11th Imam]] “seemed satisfactory”.&lt;ref&gt;A Companion To The History Of The Middle East, edited by Youssef M.Choueiri, page 93&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Bernard Lewis]], the occultation and subsequent return of the Imam became a characteristic Shia doctrine following the “suppression of many risings and the disappearance of their leaders”; where the leader disappears and “his followers say that he is not dead; he has gone into concealment”. With each new leader “who disappeared and did not return”, this belief was “enriched” and became more detailed and “essential” as a “feature of Shia Islam.”&lt;ref&gt;Islam and the West, by Bernard Lewis, 1993, page 163&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MasjideJamkaran.jpeg|thumb|[[Jamkaran]], supposed site of a historical appearance of al-Mahdi.]]
However, according to [[Wilferd Madelung]] in [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], the doctrine of the Occultation was well-documented by traditions of the Imams before the occultation of the Twelfth Imam whom the majority of the Imamiyya came to consider as the Mahdi after the death of the eleventh. As an example he mentions that "the pattern was already set in regard to [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah|Muḥammad b. al-Ḥanafiyya]], whose death was denied by the Kaysāniyya [q.v.]. They believed that he was hidden in the mountains of Raḍwā and would return to rule the world. Similar beliefs arose around Muḥammad b. al-Ḥanafiyya’s son [[Abu Hashim|Abū Hashim]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/al-mahdi-COM_0618 al-Mahdī. Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Brill Online, 2012. Reference. University of Southern California. 18 June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Madelung names several Sunni scholars who have similar beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=Testimony in support of the Mahdīship of the Twelfth Imām by these Sunnī authors, as also of later ones like the Mālikī scholar Ibn al-Ṣabbāg̲h̲ al-Isfāḳusī al-Makkī (d. 855/1451), a [[Maghreb|Mag̲h̲ribī]] resident in Mecca, and, more recently, the Ḥanafī [[Naqshbandi|Naḳs̲h̲bandī]] S̲h̲ayk̲h̲ Sulaymān b. Ibrāhīm al-Ḳundūzī al-Balk̲h̲ī (d. 1294/1877 in Istanbul), was regularly noted by Imāmī apologists. The works of al-Gand̲j̲i and Kamāl al-Dīn Ibn Ṭalḥa were extensively quoted already by ʿAlī b. ʿĪsā al-Irbilī (d. 692/1293) in his Kas̲h̲f al-g̲h̲umma fī maʿrifat al-aʾimma, which in turn won positive comment from Sunnī authors because of its extensive reliance on Sunnī sources. Further support for the Mahdīship of the Twelfth Imām came from Ṣūfī circles. Already [[Al-Bayhaqi|Abū Bakr al-Bayhaḳī]] (d. 458/1066) had noted that some Ṣūfī [[Gnosticism|gnostics]] (d̲j̲amāʿa min ahl al-kas̲h̲f) agreed with the Imāmī doctrine about the identity of the Mahdī and his g̲h̲ayba. The Persian Ṣūfī Ṣadr al-Dīn Ibrāhīm al-Ḥammūyī (late 7th/13th century) supported Imāmī doctrine on the Mahdī in his Farāʾid al-simṭayn. The Egyptian Ṣūfī al-S̲h̲aʿrānī, while generally showing no sympathy for S̲h̲īʿism. affirmed in his al-Yawāḳīt wa ’l-d̲j̲awāhir (written in 958/1551) that the Mahdīwas a son of Imām al-Ḥasan al-ʿAskarī born in the year 255/869 and would remain alive until his meeting with Jesus. His advent could be expected after the year 1030/1621. He based his assertion on the testimony of the Ṣūfī S̲h̲ayk̲h̲ Ḥasan al-ʿIrāḳī, who claimed to have met the Mahdī, and on a spurious quotation from [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn al-ʿArabī’s]] al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyya identifying the Expected Mahdī with the Twelfth Imām. This quotation of Ibn al-ʿArabī was noted and accepted by both Imāmī and Sunnī scholars. The Egyptian S̲h̲ayk̲h̲ al-Ṣabbān (d. 1206/1792), in his Isʿāf al-rāg̲h̲ibīn fī sīrat al-Muṣṭafā wa-faḍāʾil ahl baytih al-ṭāhirīn, censured Ibn al-ʿArabī for supporting such a view against the clear evidence of the traditions accepted by Sunnī scholars.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Hadith]] upon whose authenticity Shiites and Sunnis agree, [[Muhammad]] had said, "If there were to remain in the life of the world but one day, God would prolong that day until He sends in it a man from my community and my household. His name will be the same as my name. He will fill the earth with equity and justice as it was filled with oppression and tyranny." {{efn| For more hadiths see Sahih of Tirmidhi. Cairo, 1350-52. vol.

== Usuli versus Akhbari ==
Twelvers of the [[Akhbari]] and [[Usuli]] branches have for centuries debated over the interpretation of religious texts and the responsibilities of Twelver scholars in the absence of the [[Hujjat al-Mahdi|Hidden 12th Imam]]. This culminated during the latter half of the 18th century with the violent suppression of Akhbari’s, especially under the direction of Usuli scholar [[Muhammad Baqir Behbahani]].&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophers and Religious Leaders'', edited by Christian D. Von Dehsen &amp; Scott L. Harris, page 29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cole, J. R. I. ''Roots of North Indian Shi'ism in Iran and Iraq: Religion and State in Awadh'', 1722-1859. Berkeley: University of California Press, pages 33 &amp; 164&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', by Cyril Glassé, page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand, Akhbaris (nowadays a small minority) reject the use of reasoning in deriving religious laws and verdicts. They believe the Qur'an and Sunnah (traditions of Muhammad and the Imams) provide all the laws necessary for their followers, and that reasoning is open to errors from imperfect scholars in the absence of an infallible Imam. They also criticise what they see as [[Akhbari#History|the transgressions of Twelver scholars]], in gradually acquiring for themselves the powers and responsibilities of the Hidden Imam. Some Akhbaris have reported their belief this was, among others explanations, a result of the greed for power and wealth of Usuli scholars over laymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Roots of North Indian Shi'ism in Iran and Iraq: Religion and State in Awadh|year=1989|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520056411|pages=165–166|author=J. R. I. Cole|chapter=3.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Usulis criticise the rigidity and narrow-mindedness of the Akhbaris and interpret the religious texts and take on much of the roles of the 12th Imam in accordance with the naturally evolving requirements of the Twelver Shia community.

==Nikah mut‘ah==
[[Nikah mut‘ah]] (lit. "pleasure marriage"), is a fixed-term marriage practiced in Twelver Shia Islam. The duration of this type of marriage is fixed at its inception and is then automatically dissolved upon completion of its term. For this reason, nikah mut‘ah has been widely criticised as the religious cover and legalization of [[prostitution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6714885.stm Iran talks up temporary marriages], by [[Frances Harrison]], BBC News, Last Updated: 2 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/19/AR2007011901850.html Temporary 'Enjoyment Marriages' In Vogue Again With Some Iraqis], by Nancy Trejos, The Washington Post, 20 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f1CzcNX-nVgC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=temporary+marriage+prostitution&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Law of desire: temporary marriage in Shi'i Iran], by Shahla Haeri, pg.6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zPXu561ZpvgC&amp;pg=PT192&amp;dq=temporary+marriage+prostitution&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=false Islam For Dummies], by Malcolm Clark.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lq2fxfbb0i4C&amp;pg=PT85&amp;dq=temporary+marriage+prostitution&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=false Islam: a very short introduction], by [[Malise Ruthven]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Christian]] [[missionary]] [[Thomas Patrick Hughes]] criticized Mut'ah as allowing the continuation of "one of the abominable practices of ancient Arabia." &lt;ref&gt;"In permitting these usufructuary marriages Muḥammad appears but to have given Divine (?) sanction to one of the abominable practices of ancient Arabia, for Burckhardt (vol. ii. p. 378) says, it was a custom of their forefathers to assign to a traveller who became their guest for the night, some female of the family, most commonly the host’s own wife!"

"Outside of the religious establishment and the ongoing disputes between Shi'i and Sunni scholars, the attitude toward temporary marriage has been primarily one of ambivalence and disdain. Before the revolution of 1979, the secular Iranian middle classes dismissed temporary marriage as a form of prostitution that had been legitimized by the religious establishment, who, to use a popular Persian expression, 'put a religious hat on it.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikah mut‘ah was practiced at the time of [[Muhammad]] and [[Abu Bakr]], but was outlawed by the second Caliph, [[Umar ibn Khattab]]. Therefore, it is forbidden among Sunnis, but Shia consider Umar's account as legally and religiously invalid, as they argue it's legitimated by Quran 4:24.&lt;ref name=Iranica&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/mota Temporary marriage, ''Encyclopedia Iranica'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, ''Discipline and punish: The birth of Prison, Trans Alan Sheridan'' (New York: Vantage, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Friedl&gt;[[Mahnaz Afkhami]], Erika Friedl - 1994 In the eye of the storm: women in post-revolutionary Iran - Page 105&lt;/ref&gt; Shia have systematically contested the criticism that it is a cover for prostitution, and argue their rationales regarding the legal uniqueness of temporary marriage, which distinguishes Mut'ah ideologically from prostitution.&lt;ref name=Iranica/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-islam.org/al-serat/muta/ Sachiko Murata, ''Temporary Marriage in Islamic Law'']&lt;/ref&gt; Children born of temporary marriages are considered legitimate, and have equal status in law with their siblings born of permanent marriages, and do inherit from both parents. Women must observe a period of celibacy ([[idda]]) to allow for the identification of a child’s legitimate father, and a woman can only be married to one person at a time, be it temporary or permanent. Some Shia scholars also view Mut'ah as a means of eradicating prostitution from society.&lt;ref&gt;Said Amir Arjomand (1984), ''From nationalism to revolutionary Islam'', page 171&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, when an incipient ecumenical movement called for the unification of Shia and Sunni Islam, religious writers cited this "disrespect" for the [[Sahabah]] as a barrier to unification. In 1980s and 1990s, three major religious writers in [[Egypt]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Pakistan]] again cited this argument, noting that until all "profanity" against the Sahabah was abandoned, dialogue with Shia scholars could not begin.&lt;ref name=Iranand&gt;Jamal S.

In the presence of hundreds of scholars, students of knowledge, and believers, then went on to say: "It is therefore the duty of every single Muslim now to dig up the graves of these two men (i.e. Abu Bakr and Umar), and to exhume what remains of their corpses. In fact, the ruling of burial in usurped property is the obligation of exhumation according to legal consensus. This is the principle and this is the conclusion."

==Mourning Husayn and self-flagellation during Ashura==
[[File:Annual_ritual_observed_on_the_10th_day_of_Muharram_in_Al_Manama_Bahrain.jpg|thumb|Tatbir during [[Mourning of Muharram|Moharram]], [[Bahrain]], 2011]]
Twelvers have been criticised for the practice of ''[[Tatbir]]'' (a form of [[self-flagellation]]) during [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], the observation of the martyrdom of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] traditionally accompanied by acts of ritual self-harm, which is often described as barbaric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thinking of Answers: Questions in the Philosophy of Everyday Life|date=1 Mar 2010|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781408810538|author=A.C.

The practice is contested among Shi'a clerics: while traditionalist clerics allow believers to indulge in Tatbir, modernist clerics deem it not to be permissible because it is considered as self-damage and haram in Islam.&lt;ref name="MonsuttiNaef2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Monsutti|first1=Alessandro|last2=Naef|first2=Silvia|last3=Sabahi|first3=Farian|title=The Other Shiites: From the Mediterranean to Central Asia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_62A00tLaygC&amp;pg=PA146|year=2007|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-03911-289-0|pages=146–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suffering and cutting the body with knives or chains was banned by the Shiite [[List of current Maraji|marja]] [[Ali Khamenei]], Supreme Leader of [[Iran]] and by [[Hezbollah]] in Lebanon.&lt;ref name="Edith Szanto 2012"&gt;Edith Szanto, “Sayyida Zaynab in the State of Exception: Shi‘i Sainthood as ‘Qualified Life’ in Contemporary Syria,” International Journal of Middle East Studies 44 no. 2 (2012): 285-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Khamenei issued a fatwa on 14 June 1994 banning this practice. He considered it irreligious and not suitable for good Muslims.&lt;ref name=Iranand/&gt;

According to Salafi Sunni scholars such as [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] and [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz]], the celebration of Ashura is itself a blatant and primary example of the propensity of the Shia to indulge in ''[[Bid‘ah]]'' (religious innovation). They argue that the annual mourning occasion for Husayn (or any other individual) was never instituted or practiced by Muhammad—not even for his closest family members—and hence has no validity in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Raihan Ismail|title=The Saudi Ulema and the Shi'a of Saudi Arabia|journal=Journal of Shi'a Islamic Studies|date=Autumn 2012|volume=5|issue=4|page=418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Iqtida' as-Sirat al-Mustaqim'' (Following The Straight Path), by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], p. 300-301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah]]'', by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], vol. 4, p. 554-556.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fataawa al-Shaykh ‘Abd al-‘Azeez ibn Baaz'' (8/320).&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Ibn Rajab]] in his ''Kitab al-Iata'if'' argued against Ashura: "Neither God..., nor His Messenger...have ordered that days on which prophets met with calamities and the day of their death be instituted as a day of mourning. How much more is this true for a person lesser than they?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=N. J. G.

==Child Imams==
Three of the [[The Twelve Imams|Twelve Imams]], held by the Shia to be God's representatives on Earth, were less than ten years old when they assumed the undisputed and exclusive leadership of the Twelver Shia community. The 9th Imam, [[Muhammad al-Taqi]], was 7 and a half years old at the time he assumed the Imamate; the 10th Imam, [[Ali al-Hadi]], was between 6.5 and 8.5 years, and the 12th and final Imam, [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], was 4 and a half years old. Pakistani Islamic scholar and polemicist [[Ehsan Elahi Zaheer]] argues against the possibility of these personalities assuming the leadership of the [[Imamah (Shi'a Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]] at such young ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kr-hcy.com/shia/books/ehsanzaheer/index.shtml ''Shia's and Shiaism, there Genesis and Evolution: Shia Sects''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228185246/http://www.kr-hcy.com/shia/books/ehsanzaheer/index.shtml |date=2013-12-28 }}, by Allama Ehsan Elahi Zaheer. Text quotation: "''If God had commanded us to obey an adolescent, He would have also ordered the adolescent to obey His injunctions. Just as it is unlawful to declare a non-adult as "Mukallaf", similarly he is not legally empowered to arbitrate among people. He can not grasp the subtleties and intricacies involved in the solution of problems; he is not fully conversant with religious injunctions and the rules and regulations of Sharia. The Sharia introduced by the holy Prophet (peace be upon him) which is the basic need of the Ummah till the arrival of the doomsday is obviously beyond the range of an adolescent's comprehension. If a non-adolescent can handle these complicated and sensitive issues, then we can also excpet a child who is in his cradle and swings to the rhythms and melodies of nursery rhymes, to show an awareness of these issues and to suggest solutions to dis-entangle their knots. But it all sounds absurd because adolescence is not the same things as non-adolescence and a child can not rationally be expected to behave like a grown-up person. The perceptions and reflections of the former do not operate at the same wave lengts as those of the latter.''"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilferd Madelung]] notes, however, that in Shia belief the knowledge of an Imam comes from "inspiration, not acquisition", and thus that even a young Imam is not considered unprepared, receiving revelation upon the death of his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;An Ismaili heresiography, by [[Wilferd Madelung]], Paul Ernest Walker, [https://books.google.com/books?id=yvGtIQQ_v7QC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=An+Ismaili+heresiography,+by+Wilferd+Madelung,&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=f4D7TMu1JtDoOYz82dQK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCkQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pg.114-115]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shias further claim that [[Muhammad al-Jawad|ninth Imam]] the Shiite could not help asking from his father, the [[Ali al-Ridha|eighth Imam]] whether a child at that age could take on such a responsibility if something happened to Imam [[Ali al-Ridha]]; and al-Ridha used to illustrate the story of the Jesus who was even younger when he had become the prophet of his time however Sunnis state ascribing prophetic values to Shia Imams is another example of Shirk.{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#5:110 Quran, 5:110]}}&lt;ref name="Donaldson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sharif al-Qarashi|first= Bāqir|year=2005|title=The Life of Imam Muhammad Al-Jawad|others=Translated by Abdullah al-Shahin|location=Qum|publisher=Ansariyan Publications|pp=53,205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John the Baptist]] was also a child when he was given wisdom. His reading and understanding of the scriptures, surpassed even that of the greatest scholars of the time.{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#19:12 Quran, 19:12]}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''A–Z of Prophets in Islam and Judaism'', B. M. Wheeler, ''John the Baptist''&lt;/ref&gt;

Shias claim that the Shiite account of [[al-Ma'mun]]'s first meeting with [[Muhammad al-Jawad]] shows that wisdom is given to the Twelve Imams.{{efn|Once when al-Ma'mun was out hunting with his hunting birds he passed through a road where boys were playing. Among them was Muhammad al-Jawad. When al-Ma'mun's horsemen approached the boys ran away except al-Jawad who remained there. Noting this al-Ma'mun stopped his carriage and asked, "Boy, what kept you from running away with the others?" Al-Jawad replied, "The road was not so narrow that I should fear there would not be room for you to pass, and I have not been guilty of any offence that I should be afraid, and I considered that you were the sort of man who would not injure one who had done no wrong." The [[Caliphate|Caliph]] was very delighted, after he had gone on a short distance one of his hunting birds brought him a small fish, which he hid in his fist and returned and asked the boy, who was still standing there "What have I in my hand?" The young Imam answered that the "creator of living things has created in the sea a small fish that is fished by the falcons of the kings and caliphs to try with it the progeny of [[Muhammad|al-Mustafa]].&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt; Al-Ma'mun was much pleased and asked the child about his lineage, to which Imam al-Jawad responded accordingly.}} After which the Caliph called together a great gathering in which all kinds of questions were asked from the young Imam, who astonished them all with his judgment and learning. Then al-Ma'mun declared formally that he gave him his daughter in marriage thereby.&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

Other criticisms include the fact that Imamah is not mentioned in the Quran and the absence of such a crucial pillar in Shia Islam brings into question the validity of such claims. The Twelver Imamah doctrine is not shared by the majority of Sunni Muslims. The Syrian mufti [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (d. 728 AH/1328 AD) composed a long refutation of it in his ''[[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See "Ibn Taymiyya’s Critique of Shia Imamology. Translation of Three Sections of his "Minhāj al-Sunna", by Yahya Michot, ''The Muslim World'', 104/1-2 (2014), pp. 109-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infallibility of Imams==
Twelver Shi'ism has been criticized for exaggerating the holiness and infallibility of its Imams. Al-Kulayni in al-Kafi claims that the Imams know when they die and they do not die unless by their own choice, they know everything in the past and in the future and every time when God informs Muhammad, He orders him to inform Ali too. In ''Islamic Government'' Khomeini writes: "Amongst the necessities in our doctrine is that our Imams have a dignity which no favored angel nor sent prophet could ever reach. As it has been narrated, the Imams were lights under the shadow of the throne before creating this world”.&lt;ref&gt;I. M. N. Al-Jubouri. Islamic Thought. page 314&lt;/ref&gt; According to critics this purity is close to that of the prophet Muhammad, if not quite on the same level, and reflects excessiveness of view.&lt;ref&gt;I. M. N. Al-Jubouri. Islamic Thought.[https://books.google.com/books?id=owqY-90imMIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=islamic+thought+al-jubouri&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=UqK4T-yLKYOWhQevxPT9CA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=islamic%20thought%20al-jubouri&amp;f=false page 107]&lt;/ref&gt; Shia Islam has been criticised for magnifying the role of the Imams alongside, or even above, that of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=SHMUEL BAR|title=Sunnis and Shiites—Between Rapprochement and Conflict|url=https://hudson.org/content/researchattachments/attachment/1370/bar_vol2.pdf|accessdate=19 May 2015|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

Both Shiite and Sunni are in agreement over the two functions of prophet hood: to reveal God's law to men, and to guide men toward God. However, while Sunnis believe that both have come to an end with the death of [[Muhammad]], Shiites believe that whereas legislation ended, the function of guiding and "explaining divine law continued through the line of Imams."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Shiite theology, thus, God does not guide via authoritative texts (i.e. the Qur'an and Hadith) only but also guides through some specially equipped individuals known as Imams.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Daniel|title=Rethinking Tradition in Modern Islamic Thought|date=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|p=60|isbn=978-0-521-65394-7|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
This constitution, Shiite says, is not limited to Islam, but each great messenger of God had two covenants, one concerning the next prophet who would eventually come, and one regarding the immediate successor, the Imam.&lt;ref name="Momen"/&gt; For example, Sam was an imam for [[Noah in Islam|Noah]], [[Ishmael]] was an Imam for [[Abraham]], [[Aaron]] or [[Joshua]] for Moses, Simon, John and all the disciples for Jesus, and [[Ali]] and his descendants for [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Amir-Moezzi|first1=Mohammad Ali|title=SHIʿITE DOCTRINE|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|website=Encyclopedia Iranica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is narrated from the sixth imam, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] who had said "where there to remain on the earth but two men, one of them would be the proof of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The difference between apostles (Rasuls), the prophets(Nabi) and the Imams, thus, is described as follows:
Rasul sees and hears the angel in awakness and sleep. Nabi hears the angel and sees him while asleep, but does not see him while awake though hears the speech. Imam (muhaddith) is the one who hears the angel in awakness while does not see him in awakness or sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project Team|title=A Shi'ite Encyclopedia|url=http://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Shiite, the status and authority attributed to Imams will be senseless if they are prone to the same weakness found in general people.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt; God must assign someone similar to prophet in his attributes and [[Ismah]] as his successor to guide the people and to interpret the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dabashi | first=Hamid |pp=103–104| authorlink=Hamid Dabashi | title= Theology of Discontent: The Ideological Foundation of the Islamic Revolution in Iran| publisher=Transaction Publishers | year=2006 | isbn=1-4128-0516-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tabatabaei|first1=Muhammad Husayn|title=Islamic Teachings in Brief|date=2008|publisher=Ansariyan Publications|url=http://www.al-islam.org/islamic-teachings-in-brief-allamah-tabatabai}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shias claim their sources state that the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] which are described pure of sin in the verse of purification are [[Ahl al-Kisa]] involved only specific members of the Prophet's family,{{efn|According to Madelung the majority of the Sunnite reports quoted by al-Tabari do

==Fatimah's divine revelations==
According to some Twelver Shia scholars, Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]] received divine revelations after her father's death. During the 75 days that Fatimah had contact and communication with Gabriel, her husband Ali wrote down and recorded the revelations that were made to Fatimah which she dictated to him, to form the [[Book of Fatimah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-shia.org/html/eng/books/hadith/al-kafi/part4/part4-ch40.htm Kitab Al-Kafi, Chapter 40 (Statements about al-Jafr, al-Jami‘ and the Book of Fatima (a.s.))] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720165047/http://www.al-shia.org/html/eng/books/hadith/al-kafi/part4/part4-ch40.htm |date=July 20, 2011 }}, H 639, Ch. 40, h 5, translated by Muhammad Sarwar. A sound [[Hadith|tradition]] according to Grand Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Khomeini]] in: “THE POSITION OF WOMEN FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF IMAM KHOMEINI”, pg.10-11. This tradition quotes Imam [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], as saying: “After the death of her father, Fatima, upon whom be peace, lived for 75 days. She was in this world and she was overcome with grief. Gabriel, the Trusted Spirit, came to her regularly to console her and tell her of future events.”&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunnis argue that [[Fatimah]] never received divine revelations from Allah.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Patrick Hughes. ''Dictionary of Islam: being a cyclopædia of the doctrines, rites, ceremonies, and customs, together with the technical and theological terms, of the Muhammadan religion''. W. H. Allen, 1885. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rDtbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA573&amp;dq=sunnis+deny+revelation+fatimah&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qr72TKSHHIG78gabn6y5Bw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Pg 573]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Shia [[Muhammad al-Baqir|fifth Imam]], however, this kind of revelation is not the revelation of prophethood but rather like the inspiration (ilham)  which came to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)]],{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#3:45 Quran, 3:45]}} the mother of Moses{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#28:7 Quran, 28:7]}} and to the bee.{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#16:68 Quran, 16:68]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Khums==
According to Twelver religious practice, [[Khums]] is an annual taxation on 20% of all profits. This wealth is collected and managed by Shia religious leaders. However, according to scholars such as [[Musa al-Musawi]], the modern development of the practice of collecting khums exclusively by Shia religious leaders, especially the [[sayyid]] clerical elite, is simply a case of the usurpation of the place of the hidden Imam Mahdi and as a way of enriching the clerical class.&lt;ref&gt;al-Shra wa-l-taskih, [[Musa al-Musawi]], pp. 65-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Just Ruler in Shi'ite Islam, [[Abdulaziz Sachedina]], pp. 237-45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shi'a Islam: From Religion to Revolution, [[Heinz Halm]], pp. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Khums, according to Shiite, is divided into two portions. One portion went to the descendants of Muhammad, the other portion was divided equally and one part given to Imam and clergy, while the other part went to the orphaned and poor Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;John L. Esposito (2004), The Oxford Dictionary of Islam, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195125597}}, pp. 174&lt;/ref&gt; Khums became a major source of income and financial independence of the clergy in Shia regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shias justify the practice of khums by the fact that unlike Sunni religious leaders, non-Iranian Shia ones, aren't state sponsored and supported in their mission. For example, Turkish "[[Presidency of Religious Affairs]]" only trains and employs all of Turkey’s Sunni imams, as well as administers only Sunni worshiping places, despite the fact that [[Islam in Turkey|Shias make up 25-30% of Turkish citizens]] and on non-voluntary basis participate in the financing of the Sunni mosques and the salaries of Sunni imams, while their places of worship, which are not officially recognized by the State, don't receive any funding.

==Three prayer times per day==
While Sunnis have 5 [[salat]] (prayer) sessions per day, Twelvers can opt to pray only 3 times per day by doubling their prayers on 2 occasions&lt;ref&gt;''2017? How to Survive: Road-Testing the Options, Looking for Loopholes'', by Kevin Staffa, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic Customs and Culture'', by Jason Porterfield, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Textbook on Muslim Law'', by Rakesh Kumar Singh, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;—combining the 2nd prayer with the 3rd and the 4th prayer with the 5th.&lt;ref&gt;''Muslim Cultures Today: A Reference Guide'', edited by Kathryn M. Coughlin, p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Islam: A Concise Introduction'', by Neal Robinson, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sunnis argue this very practice defeats the purpose of having 5 distinct prayers, since God ordered 5 prayers for 5 separate times of the day rather than 3 prayers for 3 separate times of the day and that Shia have misrepresented the ambiguity of the issue in the Quran for their own convenience.&lt;ref&gt;''Muslims: Bio-cultural Perspective'', by S. H. M. Rizvi, Shibani Roy, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''World Criminal Justice Systems: A Comparative Survey'', by Richard J. Terrill, p. 605.&lt;/ref&gt; Twelvers extract this ruling from the two most important sources of jurisprudence which are the Quran&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite quran|17|78|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sunnah of the Messenger Muhammad who was praying this way, as it is also reported by Sunni sources,&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|4|1515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|4|1516}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|4|1520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|4|1522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|4|1523}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|4|1524}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus they believe this backs their claims accepted within a Sunni point of view. It is even reported from the hadith that the Messenger did this so that ''no one among his Ummah should be put to [unnecessary] hardship'' however this can also be interpreted for people in long journey or ill health, Shias believe this is enough to reject any accusation of not basing their actions from Quran and Traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team/joining-prayers-and-other-related-issues|title=Joining Prayers and Other related Issues|work=Al-Islam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However many Hadiths exist which support the practice of 5 prayers per day.

==Rejection of predestination==
Twelvers reject [[Predestination in Islam|predestination]].&lt;ref&gt;''Need of Religion'', by Sayyid [[Sa'id Akhtar Rizvi]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic Beliefs, Practices, and Cultures'', by Marshall Cavendish Corporation, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Religions of Man'', by Charles Douglas Greer, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Muslims'', by S. H. M. Rizvi, Shibani Roy, B. B. Dutta, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to Sunni criticism of Twelvers, along with their associated belief in [[Bada']] (change in God's will), as being deniers of God's complete [[sovereignty]] and as being imitators of the [[Mu'tazila]] school of Islamic theology.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethnic Composition and Crisis in South Asia: Pakistan'', by Haraprasad Chattopadhyaya, Sanat K. Sarkar, pp. 766-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Sunni-Shia Conflict in Pakistan'', by Mūsá Ḵẖān Jalālzaʼī, pp. 279-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

To show that there is no contradiction between being predestined, and free will, Shiite states that matters relating to the human destiny is of two kinds: definite and indefinite; to explain the definitive one, Shiite argues that God has definite power over the whole of existence, however, whenever He wills, He can replace a given destiny with another one; and that is what is called indefinite destiny. some of these changes of destiny, thus, are brought about by man himself, who can through his free will, his decisions, and his way of life—lay the groundwork for a change in his destiny as been pointed out in the verses: ''Truly, God will not change the condition of a people as long as they do not change Their state themselves.''{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#13:11 Quran, 13:11]}} Both types of destinies, however, are contained within God's foreknowledge, Shiite argues, so that there could be no sort of change (Bada)concerning His knowledge. So the first type of destiny does not mean a limitation of God’s power; since God, in contrast to the belief of Jews who says ''the hand of God is tied’'' asserts: ''Nay, His hands are spread out wide ...''.{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#5:64 Quran, 5:64]}} So God has the power to change everything he wills and God's creativity is continuous. Accordingly, as Sobhani puts it, "all groups in Islam regard "bada" as a tenet of the faith, even if not all actually use the term."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sobhani|first1=Ja'far|title=Doctrines of Shi'i Islam|publisher=I.B.Tauris in association with The Institute of Ismaili Studies|others=Translated and Edited by Reza Shah-Kazemi|location=London - New York|pages=159–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corruption of the Quran==
{{main|Shia view of the Quran}}
Twelvers are often criticised by Sunnis for believing that the Quran was altered by the Sahaba (companions of Muhammad). Groups such as the [[Deobandis]] accuse Twelvers of believing that the complete version of the original Quran is in the possession of their 12th Imam. Twelvers are also accused of believing that the present Quran is omitted of the verses which support the Imamate of Ali because Caliph Uthman removed them during the Qurans compilation—noting the incompatibility of the belief that the codification and propagation of the Quran was truthfully undertaken by the Sahaba, who, in Shi'a tradition, represent the earliest people to take the Caliphate from its rightful claimants and to have corrupted the religion of Islam. As a result, such Sunni groups reject the Shia defense that they believe in the same Quran as Sunnis, accusing Shiites of lying in line with their practice of taqiyya so as not to expose themselves to the certain Sunni backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Muhammad Moj|title=The Deoband Madrassah Movement: Countercultural Trends and Tendencies|date=1 Mar 2015|publisher=Anthem Press|location=Appendix I: The Deobandi Stance vis-a-vis Muslim Groups Other Than The Barelwis: B.

Most of Shiites nowadays believe that nothing have been omitted or added to the [[Quran]], however, traces of earlier views can be find in some Hadith books like [[Bihar al-Anwar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Shiite scholar [[Abu al-Qasim al-Khoei]] states that even if The Book of Ali (a copy of [[Quran]] written by [[Ali]] containing Ali's commentary, which sometimes is called the Book of Ali)&lt;ref name= "Moojan"&gt;{{harvnb|Momen|1985|p=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; incorporated additions that are not part of the existing Quran, this does not mean that these additions comprised parts of the Quran and have been dropped from it due to alteration. Rather, these additions were interpretations or explanations of what God was saying, or were in the form of revelations from God, explaining the intention of the verses in the Quran. These additions were not part of the Quran and not part of what the [[Muhammad|Messenger of God]] was commanded to convey to the Muslim community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Khu'i|first=Al-Sayyid|title=The Prolegomena to the Qur'an|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-511675-5|pages=154–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Karbala==
[[Image:Kerbela Hussein Moschee.jpg|thumb|right|Shia pilgrims gather around the shrine of Husayn in Karbala.]]
Twelvers have been accused of raising [[Karbala]] to holiness and prominence—which in itself is "frowned upon by Sunnis"—above even [[Makka]], [[Medina]] and [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Barry Rubin|title=The Middle East: A Guide to Politics, Economics, Society and Culture|date=17 Mar 2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317455783|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ingvar Svanberg|author2=David Westerlund|editor1-last=Svanberg|editor1-first=Ingvar|editor2-last=Westerlund|editor2-first=David|title=Islam Outside the Arab World|date=6 Dec 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136113222|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is exemplified by the attribution of the title ''Karbala-i'' for one who has performed pilgrimage there (just as one who makes the [[Hajj]] is titled [[Hajji]]), its annual attraction of more pilgrims for [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]] and [[Arba'een]] than the Hajj (seen as "a counterweight and a challenge to the annual haj taking place in Mecca"), prostrating during [[salat]] on [[turbah]] commonly made from the clay of Karbala and to numerous [[hadith]] attributed to the Imams which are interpreted by critics as placing the land of Karbala above the [[Kaaba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gilles Kepel|title=The War for Muslim Minds: Islam and the West|date=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674015753|page=225|edition=illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mahmoud M.

==Violence and persecution==

However, Twelvers have themselves often been victims of [[Anti-Shi'ism|Anti-Shia]] violence.

{{italic title}}
The '''''Discourses of Epictetus''''' ({{lang-el|Ἐπικτήτου διατριβαί}}, ''Epiktētou diatribai'') are a series of informal lectures by the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Epictetus]] written down by his pupil [[Arrian]] around 108 AD. Four books out of an original eight are still extant. The philosophy of Epictetus is intensely practical. He directs his students to focus attention on their opinions, anxieties, passions and desires, so that "they may never fail to get what they desire, nor fall into what they avoid." True education lies in learning to distinguish what is our own from what does not belong to us, and in learning to correctly assent or dissent to external impressions. The purpose of his teaching was to make people free and happy.

The ''Discourses'' have been influential since they were written. They are referred to and quoted by [[Marcus Aurelius]]. Since the 16th-century they have been translated into multiple languages and reprinted many times.

==Title and dating==
The books did not have a formal title in ancient times.  Although [[Simplicius of Cilicia|Simplicius]] called them ''Diatribai'' (Διατριβαί, Discourses),&lt;ref&gt;Simplicius, ''Commentary on Epictetus' Enchiridion''.&lt;/ref&gt; other writers gave them titles such as ''Dialexis'' (Διαλέξεις, Talks),&lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius, ''Attic Nights'', xix. 1&lt;/ref&gt; ''Apomnêmoneumata'' (Ἀπομνημονεύματα, Records),&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus, i. 3. 50; iii. 6. 57, 58; iii. 29. 84&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Homiliai'' (Ὁμιλίαι, Conversations).&lt;ref&gt;Stobaeus, iv. 33. 28; Photius, ''Biblioth.'' 58&lt;/ref&gt;  The modern name comes from the titles given in the earliest medieval manuscript: "Arrian's ''Diatribai'' of Epictetus" ({{lang-el|Ἀρριανοῦ τῶν Ἐπικτήτου Διατριβῶν}}).&lt;ref name="long42"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2003|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek word ''Diatribai'' literally means "informal talks".&lt;ref name="long42"/&gt;

As to the date, it is generally agreed that the ''Discourses'' were composed sometime in the years around 108 AD. Epictetus himself refers to the coins of [[Trajan]],&lt;ref&gt;''Discourses'', iv. 5. 17&lt;/ref&gt; which shows he was teaching during that reign.&lt;ref name="millar108"&gt;{{Harvnb|Millar|2004|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrian was [[suffect consul]] in around 130, and since forty-two was the standard age for that position, he would have been at the right age of around twenty in 108.&lt;ref name="millar108"/&gt; Furthermore the "commissioner" of the "free cities" to whom ''Discourse'' iii.&amp;nbsp;7 is addressed is thought to be the same man [[Pliny the Younger]] addresses his ''Letter'' viii.&amp;nbsp;24&amp;mdash;a letter which has been dated to around 108.&lt;ref name="millar108"/&gt;

==Writing==
There were originally eight books, but only four now remain in their entirety, along with a few fragments of the others.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a preface attached to the Discourses, Arrian explains how he came to write them:
{{Quote|I neither wrote these Discourses of Epictetus in the way in which a man might write such things; nor did I make them public myself, inasmuch as I declare that I did not even write them. But whatever I heard him say, the same I attempted to write down in his own words as nearly as possible, for the purpose of preserving them as memorials to myself afterwards of the thoughts and the freedom of speech of Epictetus.|Arrian, ''Prefatory Letter''.&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, [http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/discourses.html ''Discourses''].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''Discourses'' purport to be the actual words of Epictetus.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xiii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are written in [[Koine Greek]] unlike the [[Attic Greek]] Arrian uses in his own compositions.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xiii"/&gt; The differences in style are very marked, and they portray a vivid and separate personality.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xiii"/&gt; The precise method Arrian used to write the ''Discourses'' has long been a matter of vigorous debate. Extreme positions have been held ranging from the view that they are largely Arrian's own compositions to the view that Epictetus actually wrote them himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2003|p=64}}. The first position Long ascribes to Theo Wirth, the second position is ascribed to Robert Dobbin.&lt;/ref&gt; The mainstream opinion is that the ''Discourses'' report the actual words of Epictetus, even if they cannot be a pure ''verbatim'' record.&lt;ref name="long40"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2003|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[A. A. Long]] writes:
{{Quote|More likely, perhaps, he [Arrian] made his own detailed notes, and used his memory to fill them out. No doubt he worked up the material into a more finished form. In some cases he may have relied on others' reports, or checked his own record with Epictetus himself. However Arrian actually compiled the discourses, there are numerous reasons, internal to the text, for taking the gist of his record to be completely authentic to Epictetus' own style and language. These include a distinctive vocabulary, repetition of key points throughout, [and] a strikingly urgent and vivid voice quite distinct from Arrian's authorial persona in his other works.&lt;ref name="long40"/&gt;}}

==Setting==
The ''Discourses'' are set in Epictetus' own classroom in [[Nicopolis]] and they show him conversing with visitors, and reproving, exhorting, and encouraging his pupils.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xiii"/&gt; These pupils appear to have been young men like Arrian, of high social position and contemplating entering the public service.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xiv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Discourses'' are neither formal lectures nor are they part of the curriculum proper.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xv"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regular classes involved reading and interpreting characteristic portions of Stoic philosophical works,&lt;ref name="oldfart_xiv"/&gt; which, as well as ethics, must have included instruction in the [[Stoic logic|logic]] and [[Stoic physics|physics]] which were part of the Stoic system.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xv"/&gt; The ''Discourses'' instead record conversations which followed the formal instruction.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xv"/&gt; They dwell on points which Epictetus regarded as of special importance, and which gave him an opportunity for friendly discourse with his pupils and to discuss their personal affairs.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xv"/&gt; They are not, therefore, a formal presentation of Stoic philosophy.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xv"/&gt; Instead the ''Discourses'' are intensely practical.&lt;ref name="braveheart"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wallace|1911|p=683}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are concerned with the conscious moral problem of right living, and how life is to be carried out well.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xiv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt;

==Themes==
===Three parts of philosophy===
Epictetus divides philosophy into three fields of training, with especial application to ethics.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three fields, according to Epictetus, are, (1) desire (ὄρεξις); (2) choice (ὁρμή); (3) assent (συγκατάθεσις):&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|There are three fields of study in which people who are going to be good and excellent must first have been trained. The first has to do with desires and aversions, that they may never fail to get what they desire, nor fall into what they avoid; the second with cases of choice and of refusal, and, in general, with duty, that they may act in an orderly fashion, upon good reasons, and not carelessly; the third with the avoidance of error and rashness in judgement, and, in general, about cases of assent.|''Discourses'', iii. 2. 1}}

The first and most essential practice is directed towards our passions and desires, which are themselves only types of impression, and as such they press and compel us.&lt;ref name="brandy33"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brandis|1870|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; A continued practice is thus required to oppose them.&lt;ref name="brandy33"/&gt; To this first practice must be added a second, which is directed towards that which is appropriate (duty), and a third, the object of which is certainty and truth; but the latter must not pretend to supplant the former.&lt;ref name="brandy33"/&gt; Avoidance of the bad, desire for the good, direction towards the appropriate, and the ability to assent or dissent, this is the mark of the philosopher.&lt;ref name="brandy33"/&gt;

Scholars disagree on whether these three fields relate to the traditional Stoic division of philosophy into Logic, Physics, and Ethics.&lt;ref name="long1178"&gt;{{Harvnb|Long|2003|pp=117-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third field unambiguously refers to logic since it concerns valid reasoning and certainty in judgment. The second field relates to ethics, and the first field, on desires and aversions, appears to be preliminary to ethics.&lt;ref name="long1178"/&gt; However [[Pierre Hadot]] has argued that this first field relates to physics since for the Stoics the study of human nature was part of the wider subject of the nature of things.&lt;ref name="long1178"/&gt;

===What is 'up to us'===
True education lies in learning to distinguish what is our own from what does not belong to us.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; But there is only one thing which is fully our own,—that is, our will or choice  ([[prohairesis]]).&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; The use which we make of the external impressions is our one chief concern, and upon the right kind of use depends exclusively our happiness.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxi"/&gt;

Although we are not responsible for the ideas that present themselves to our consciousness, we are absolutely responsible for the way in which we use them.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; In the realm of judgement the truth or falsity of the external impression is to be decided.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxi"/&gt; Here our concern is to assent to the true impression, reject the false, and suspend judgement regarding the uncertain. This is the act of choice.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxi"/&gt; Only that which is subject to our choice is good or evil; all the rest is neither good nor evil; it concerns us not, it is beyond our reach; it is something external, merely a subject for our choice: in itself it is indifferent, but its application is not indifferent, and its application is either consistent with or contrary to nature.&lt;ref name="brandy32"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brandis|1870|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; This choice, and consequently our opinion upon it, is in our power; in our choice we are free; nothing that is external of us, not even Zeus, can overcome our choice: it alone can control itself.&lt;ref name="brandy32"/&gt; Nothing external, neither death nor exile nor pain nor any such thing, can ever force us to act against our will.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt;
 
===Universal nature===
We are bound up by the law of nature with the whole fabric of the world.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; In the world the true position of a human is that of a member of a great system.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; Each human being is in the first instance a citizen of one's own nation or commonwealth; but we are also a member of the great city of gods and people.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; Nature places us in certain relations to other persons, and these determine our obligations to parents, siblings, children, relatives, friends, fellow-citizens, and humankind in general.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxiii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shortcomings of our fellow people are to be met with patience and charity, and we should not allow ourselves to grow indignant over them, for they too are a necessary element in the universal system.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxiii"/&gt;

===Providence===
The universe is wholly governed by an all-wise, divine Providence.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxiii"/&gt; All things, even apparent evils, are the will of God, and good from the point of view of the whole.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxiii"/&gt; In virtue of our rationality we are neither less nor worse than the gods, for the magnitude of reason is estimated not by length nor by height but by its judgments.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; The aim of the philosopher therefore is to reach the position of a mind which embraces the whole world.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; The person who recognizes that every event is necessary and reasonable for the best interest of the whole, feels no discontent with anything outside the control of moral purpose.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxiii"/&gt;

===The Cynic sage===
The historical models to which Epictetus refers to are [[Socrates]] and [[Diogenes of Sinope|Diogenes]].&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; But he describes an ideal character of a missionary sage, the perfect Stoic—or, as he calls him, the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]].&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; This philosopher has neither country nor home nor land nor slave; his bed is the ground; he is without wife or child; his only home is the earth and sky and a cloak.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; He must suffer beatings, and must love those who beat him.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt; The ideal human thus described will not be angry with the wrong-doer; he will only pity his erring.&lt;ref name="braveheart"/&gt;

==Manuscript editions==
[[File:Codex Bodleianus (Cod graec Misc 251 Auct T 4 13) Kopie.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Codex Bodleianus'' of the ''Discourses of Epictetus''. Note the large stain on the manuscript which has made this passage (Book 1. 18. 8-11) partially illegible.]]
The earliest [[manuscript]] of the ''Discourses'' is a twelfth-century manuscript kept at the [[Bodleian Library]], Oxford as MS Auct. T. 4. 13.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Philosophy Faculty Library - [http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/philosophy/collections/manuscripts ''Manuscripts and rare books''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302214520/http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/philosophy/collections/manuscripts |date=March 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Bodleian manuscript, a blot or stain has fallen onto one of the pages, and has made a series of words illegible;&lt;ref&gt;''Discourses'', i. 18. 8-11&lt;/ref&gt; in all the other known manuscripts these words (or sometimes the entire passage) are omitted,&lt;ref&gt;W. M. Lindsay (1896), ''An Introduction to Latin Textual Emendation'', page 44.&lt;/ref&gt; thus all the other manuscripts are derived from this one archetype.&lt;ref&gt;Aston et al., (1984), ''The History of the University of Oxford'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the Bodleian manuscript may be a copy of one owned by [[Arethas of Caesarea]] in the early 10th century.&lt;ref name="sellars137"&gt;{{Harvnb|Sellars|2006|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bodleian manuscript contains marginal notes which have been identified as by Arethas.&lt;ref name="sellars137"/&gt; Arethas was an important collector of manuscripts and he is also responsible for transmitting a copy of Marcus Aurelius' ''[[Meditations]]''.&lt;ref name="sellars137"/&gt;

The manuscript is however "full of errors of all kinds".&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxxviii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xxxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many corrections were made by medieval scholars themselves, and many emendations have been made by modern scholars to produce a clean text.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxxviii"/&gt;

==Publication history==
The ''Discourses'' were first printed (in Greek) by [[Vettore Trincavelli]], at [[Venice]] in 1535, although the manuscript used was very faulty.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxxi"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xxxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by editions by [[Jakob Schegk]] (1554) and [[Hieronymus Wolf]] (1560).&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxxi"/&gt; [[John Upton (Spenser editor)|John Upton]]'s edition published 1739–41 was an improvement on these since he had some knowledge of several manuscripts.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxxi"/&gt; This in turn was improved upon by the five volume edition by [[Johann Schweighäuser]], 1799–1800.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxxii"&gt;{{Harvnb|Oldfather|1925|p=xxxii}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critical edition was produced by [[Heinrich Schenkl]] in 1894 (second edition 1916) which was based upon the Bodleian manuscript.&lt;ref name="oldfart_xxxii"/&gt;

==English translations==
The first [[English language|English]] translation did not appear until 1758 with the appearance of [[Elizabeth Carter]]'s translation. This proved to be very successful, with a second edition appearing a year later (1759), a third edition in 1768, and a fourth edition published posthumously in 1807. It influenced later translations: e.g. those of Higginson and [[George Long (scholar)|George Long]] (see his Introduction for comments, some critical of Carter).

A complete list of English translations is as follows:

* [[Elizabeth Carter]], (1758), ''All the works of Epictetus, which are now extant; consisting of his [https://archive.org/stream/moraldiscoursest12epic#page/n7/mode/2up ''Discourses''], preserved by Arrian, in four books, the Enchiridion, and fragments.'' (Richardson)
* [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], (1865), ''The Works of Epictetus. Consisting of His Discourses, in Four Books, The Enchiridion, and Fragments.'' (Little, Brown, and Co.)
* [[George Long (scholar)|George Long]], (1877), ''The Discourses of Epictetus, with the Encheridion and Fragments.'' (George Bell)
*[[Percy Ewing Matheson]], (1916), ''Epictetus: The Discourses and Manual together with Fragments of his Writings''. (Oxford University Press)
* [[William Abbott Oldfather]], (1925-8), ''Discourses.'' (Loeb Classical Library) {{ISBN|0-674-99145-1}} and {{ISBN|0-674-99240-7}}
* [[Robin Hard]] (translation reviser), [[Christopher Gill (historian)|Christopher Gill]] (editor), (1995), ''The Discourses of Epictetus.'' (Everyman) {{ISBN|0-460-87312-1}}
* [[Robert Dobbin]], (2008), ''Discourses, Fragments, Handbook.'' (Penguin Classics) {{ISBN|0-14-044946-9}}
* [[Robin Hard]], (2014), ''Discourses, Fragments, Handbook.'' (Oxford University Press) {{ISBN|0-199-59518-6}}

All of these are complete translations with the exception of Robert Dobbin's book which only contains 64 out of the 95 Discourses. Robin Hard has produced two translations: the first (for Everyman in 1995) was just a revision of Elizabeth Carter's version, however his 2014 edition (for Oxford University Press) is the first complete original translation since the 1920s.

'''Eight of Wands''' is a [[Minor Arcana]] [[Tarot]] card. In the Rider-Waite deck, the card shows eight diagonal [[Quarterstaff|staves]] of staggered length angled across an open landscape with river, as designed by artist [[Pamela Colman Smith]].

Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divinatory purposes==
A card of action; swiftness. Conveys immediate information or action. News swiftly travelling. Because the suit of Wands relates to information, look for new communication and unexpected news. Depending on surrounding cards in the draw, may indicate the speed of these events.

{{refimprove|date=January 2017}}
In the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] tradition, '''Erinle''' was a great hunter who became an ''[[orisha]]''. He is said to have conducted the first Olobu of Ilobu to the site of the town of [[Ilobu]], and to have protected the people of the town from [[Fula people|Fulani]] invasions.{{sfn|Drewal|Pemberton|Abiodun|Wardwell|1989|p=167}}
He is usually described as a hunter but sometimes as a herbalist or a farmer. It is said that one day he sank into the earth near Ilobu and became a river.
He is known all over [[Yorùbáland]].{{sfn|Witte|1982|p=161}}
The cult of Erinle is found in towns throughout the former [[Oyo Empire]].
His shrines contain smooth, round stones from the Erinle River. {{sfn|Drewal|Pemberton|Abiodun|Wardwell|1989|p=167}}
The name may be derived from ''erin'' (elephant) and ''ilẹ'' (earth), or from ''erin'' and ''ile'' (house).{{sfn|Witte|1982|p=161}}
known as '''[[Inle (Santería)|Inle]]''' by the Lukumi in Cuba and as Ode Inle, sometimes Oxossi Ibualamo in Brazilian Candomble. The [[Erinle River]], a tributary of the [[Osun River|Oshun River]], takes his name.

[[File:Everybody Draw Mohammed Day.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Cartoon, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!"]]

'''Everybody Draw Mohammed Day''' (or '''Draw Mohammed Day''') was a 2010 event in support of artists threatened with violence for drawing [[Depictions of Muhammad|representations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad]]. It stemmed from a protest against [[censorship]] of the American television show ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", led by the show's distributor [[Comedy Central]], in response to death threats that had been made against some of those responsible for two segments broadcast in April 2010. A drawing representing [[Mohammed]] was posted on the Internet on April 20, 2010, with a message suggesting that "everybody" create a drawing depicting Mohammad on May 20 in support of free speech.

U.S. [[cartoon]]ist Molly Norris of [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] created the artwork in reaction to Internet death threats that had been made against animators [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] for depicting Muhammad in an episode of ''[[South Park]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4674864.stm |title =Q&amp;A: Depicting the Prophet Muhammad |publisher =BBC News |date =February 2, 2006 |accessdate=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Postings on RevolutionMuslim.com (under the pen name  Abu Talha al-Amrikee; later identified as [[Zachary Adam Chesser]]) had said that Parker and Stone could wind up like [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], a Dutch filmmaker who was stabbed and shot to death.&lt;ref name="Theo van Gogh murder"&gt;{{cite news|title=Life of slain Dutch film-maker|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3975211.stm|accessdate=May 22, 2012|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=November 2, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norris claimed that, if people draw pictures of Muhammad, [[Islamic terrorism|radical Islamist terrorists]] would not be able to murder them all, and threats to do so would become unrealistic. Within a week, Norris' idea became popular on [[Facebook]], was supported by numerous [[bloggers]], and generated coverage on the blog websites of major U.S. newspapers. As the publicity mounted, Norris and the man who created the first Facebook page promoting the May 20 event disassociated themselves from it. Nonetheless, planning for the protest continued with others "taking up the cause".&lt;ref name="erases"/&gt; Facebook had an "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" page, which grew to over 100,000 participants (101,870 members by May 20). A protest page on Facebook against the initiative named "Against ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'" attracted slightly more supporters (106,000 by May 20).&lt;ref name=figure/&gt; Subsequently, Facebook was temporarily blocked by Pakistan; the ban was lifted after Facebook agreed to block the page for users in India and Pakistan.

In the media, Everybody Draw Mohammed Day attracted support from commentators who felt that the campaign represented important issues of freedom of speech, and the need to stand up for this freedom.

{{Criticism of religion sidebar}}

===Background===
''[[South Park]]'' episodes "[[200 (South Park)|200]]" and "[[201 (South Park)|201]]", broadcast in April 2010, featured a character in a bear costume, who various other characters stated was Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =James | first = Frank |author2=Mark Memmott | title = Facebook Blocked By Pakistani Court For 'Draw Muhammad' Day | work =[[National Public Radio]]: The two-way | publisher = www.npr.org | date = May 19, 2010 | url = https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/05/facebook_blocked_by_pakistani.html | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''South Park'' episode sparked statements from the extremist website [[Revolution Muslim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bates | first = Theunis | title = Pakistan Bans Facebook Over Muhammad Cartoons | work = AOL News | language =  | publisher = www.aolnews.com | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/pakistan-bans-facebook-over-muhammad-cartoons/19483123 | accessdate = May 19, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100520033044/http://www.aolnews.com/world/article/pakistan-bans-facebook-over-muhammad-cartoons/19483123 | archivedate = May 20, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Rodriguez | first =Alex | title = Facebook dark in Pakistan amid uproar over Muhammad caricatures|work=Los Angeles Times | publisher = www.latimes.com | date = May 19, 2010 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-pakistan-facebook-20100520,0,4071401.story | accessdate =May 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which posted a picture of the partially decapitated body of the Dutch filmmaker, [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]], with a statement declaring that Parker and Stone could meet a similar fate. The group running the website said it was not threatening Parker and Stone, however, it also posted the addresses of Comedy Central's New York office and the California production studio where ''South Park'' is made.&lt;ref name=jgscl&gt;{{Cite news| last = Griswold | first =Jamie ([[Associated Press]]) | title =Seattle cartoonist launches 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' | work =MyNorthwest.com | publisher = Bonneville International | date = April 25, 2010 | url = http://www.mynorthwest.com/?nid=11&amp;sid=313170# | accessdate =May 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Comedy Central]] [[self-censored]] the episode when it was broadcast by removing the word "Muhammad" and a speech about intimidation and fear from the ''South Park'' episode.&lt;ref name=jgscl/&gt;

===Molly Norris cartoon===
Molly Norris drew the original, poster-like cartoon on April 20, 2010, which declared May 20, 2010, to be the first annual "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day". The drawing showed various [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] objects, including a coffee cup, a cherry and a box of pasta, each claiming to be the likeness of Muhammad. Norris used an alternate [[transliteration]] of "Mohammed" on her poster.&lt;ref name=jotcoelat&gt;Orr, Jimmy, [http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2010/04/creators-of-everybody-draw-muhammad-day-abandon-effort-after-it-becomes-controversial.html "Creators of 'Everybody Draw Muhammad Day' drop gag after everybody gets angry"], April 26, 2010, "Top of the Ticket" blog, ''Los Angeles Times''. Retrieved April 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Across the top of the illustration she wrote: {{quote|text=In light of the recent veiled (ha!) threats aimed at the creators of the television show South Park ... by bloggers on Revolution Muslim's website, we hereby deem May 20, 2010 as the first 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!'

Comedy Central cooperated with terrorists and pulled the episode) the first amendment.|sign=Molly Norris (April 20, 2010)|source=Molly.Norris.com}} The poster included a claim of sponsorship by an organization named "Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor or CACAH (pronounced ca-ca)", which Norris later said was purely fictional.&lt;ref name=posterdescribed&gt;[http://www.mollynorris.com/posterdescribed.html Poster described] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514103827/http://www.mollynorris.com/posterdescribed.html# |date=May 14, 2010 }}, MollyNorris.com, May 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Norris dedicated the cartoon to the creators of ''[[South Park]]'', [[Matt Stone]] and [[Trey Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = South Park Generates Anger over M | journal = The Layalina Review | volume = VI | issue = 9 | publisher = Layalina Productions, Inc | date = May 6, 2010 | url = http://www.layalina.tv/publications/review/PR_VI.9/article1.html | accessdate = May 6, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100510225548/http://www.layalina.tv/publications/review/PR_VI.9/article1.html | archivedate = May 10, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late April, after she had rejected the idea for the May 20 protest, Norris stated on her website: "This was always a drawing about rights, never MEANT to disrespect religion. Alas – if we don't have rights, we will not be able to practice the religion of our choice. [...] None of these little characters ARE the likeness of Mohammed, they are just CLAIMING to be!" She also wrote, "I, the cartoonist, NEVER launched a draw Mohammed day. It is, in this FICTIONAL poster sponsored by this FICTIONAL GROUP", referring to the "Citizens Against Citizens Against Humor" wording in the cartoon. "SATIRE about a CURRENT EVENT, people!!! (That's what {{sic|cartoonist|'s}} do!)"&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Mollie, Web page titled [http://www.mollynorris.com/posterdescribed.html "Lighten up!

===Early publicity===
Norris circulated the cartoon to bloggers based in [[Seattle, Washington]].&lt;ref name="gosalvez"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Gosalvez | first = Patricia | title =La 'bloguera', el profeta y Facebook – El temor obliga a una dibujante a retirar una campaña para pintar a Mahoma | work =[[El País]] |language=Spanish| publisher =www.elpais.com | date = May 3, 2010 | url = http://www.elpais.com/articulo/Pantallas/bloguera/profeta/Facebook/elpepirtv/20100504elpepirtv_4/Tes| accessdate =May 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She sent a copy of her illustration to [[Dan Savage]], who posted it on his blog on April 22. On April 23, she was interviewed by Dave Ross of [[KIRO-FM|KIRO]], a local Seattle radio station. Norris responded to a question "Are you sure you want to do this?", and said "Yeah, I want to water down the targets ... as a cartoonist I just felt so much passion about what had happened, I wanted to counter Comedy Central’s message about feeling afraid."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Perkins| first = Mary | title = Seattle Cartoonist’s "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" Goes Viral | work =[[Seattlest]] | location = [[Seattle, Washington]] | publisher =[[Gothamist]] | date = April 27, 2010 | url = http://seattlest.com/2010/04/27/seattle_cartoonists_everybody_draw.php | accessdate = May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The motivation for the protest was not simply to defend the ''South Park'' creators, but also to support the right to [[free speech]] under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Pries | first =Steve | title ='Everyone draw Mohammed day' challenges South Park censorship | work =The Depaulia | publisher =media.www.depauliaonline.com, [[DePaul University]] | date =May 17, 2010 | url =http://media.www.depauliaonline.com/media/storage/paper1414/news/2010/05/17/News/everyone.Draw.Mohammed.Day.Challenges.South.Park.Censorship-3919751.shtml | accessdate =May 17, 2010 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100521235514/http://media.www.depauliaonline.com/media/storage/paper1414/news/2010/05/17/News/everyone.Draw.Mohammed.Day.Challenges.South.Park.Censorship-3919751.shtml | archivedate =May 21, 2010 | df =mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said, "it's a cartoonist's job to be [[Political correctness|non-PC]]."&lt;ref name=ross&gt;[http://www.mynorthwest.com/resources/audio_headlines/audio_player.php?a=16801&amp;f=/kiro/2010/04/04232010140224.mp3 Dave Ross Interviews Molly Norris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428224744/http://www.mynorthwest.com/resources/audio_headlines/audio_player.php?a=16801&amp;f=%2Fkiro%2F2010%2F04%2F04232010140224.mp3 |date=April 28, 2010 }}, MyNorthwest.com, April 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On her website, Norris stated that the idea was not to disrespect Islam, but to support everybody's freedom of expression.&lt;ref name=mnwco&gt;{{Cite web| author = [[Associated Press]] | title = Cartoonist overwhelmed by response to "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" | date = April 27, 2010 | url = http://www.mynorthwest.com/?sid=313601&amp;nid=11 | work = MyNorthwest.com | accessdate = May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" Facebook page was created by Jon Wellington. By the morning of April 26, the page had almost 6,000 confirmed guests. By April 25, someone (whose identity is unknown) had started a "Ban Everybody Draw Muhammad Day" counter-protest page on Facebook, which had 800 confirmed guests.&lt;ref name=mcpspc&gt;Cavna, Michael, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/04/everybody_draw_mohammed_day_ga.html "Post-'South Park': Cartoonist retreats from 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!'

===Cartoonist and Facebook page creator end involvement===
On April 25, Norris wrote on her website that the response to her idea had surprised and shocked her: "I did not intend for my cartoon to go [[Viral phenomenon|viral]]. I did not intend to be the focus of any 'group'. I practice the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] by drawing what I wish. This particular cartoon of a 'poster' seems to have struck a gigantic nerve, something I was totally unprepared for. I am going back to the drawing table now!"&lt;ref name=mnwco/&gt;&lt;ref name="howardfriedman" /&gt; On April 26, she wrote on her website: "I am NOT involved in "Everybody Draw Mohammd [''[[sic]]'' ] Day! I made a cartoon that went viral and I am not going with it. Many other folks have used my cartoon to start sites, etc. Please go to them as I am a private person who draws stuff".&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt; She also asked Savage to replace the original illustration she had given him with another one she drew that was tamer, but Savage refused. Asked why she initially publicized it, she replied, "Because I'm an idiot."&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;

Norris said the campaign had grown much bigger than she initially intended, and that her cartoon was being used in ways she couldn't control. "I just want to go back to my quiet life", she told the writer of a blog about comics at ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;ref name=mcpspc/&gt; Wellington announced on April 26 that he, too, was dropping out of the movement. "I am aghast that so many people are posting deeply offensive pictures of the Prophet," he wrote.&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;&lt;ref name="rickmoran" /&gt; "Y'all go ahead if that's your bag, but count me out."&lt;ref name=jotcoelat/&gt;&lt;ref name="rickmoran"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Moran | first =Rick | title = A Lesson for our Post-Modern Media Environment | work = The Moderate Voice | publisher = Newstex | date = April 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Norris acknowledged, "I said that I wanted to counter fear and then I got afraid."&lt;ref name="erases" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =The PM wrestles with greatest non-core moral issue of the election after next |work=The Australian | publisher = www.theaustralian.com.au | date = April 27, 2010 | url =http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/opinion/the-pm-wrestles-with-greatest-non-core-moral-issue-of-the-election-after-next/story-e6frg6zo-1225859056591 | accessdate =May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 29, Norris suggested that "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" be called off: "Let's call off 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day' by changing it to 'Everybody Draw Al Gore Day' instead. Enough Mohammed drawings have already been made to get the point across. At this juncture, such drawings are only hurtful to more liberal and moderate Muslims who have not done anything to endanger our first amendment rights."&lt;ref&gt;Cavna, Michael, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/04/apologetic_draw_muhammad_carto.html "Apologetic 'Draw Muhammad' cartoonist urges 'Draw Al Gore' instead [VIDEO&amp;#93;"], 8:38 a.m. update of a 1 a.m. post, April 30, 2010, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, Norris posted a marked up version of her original cartoon, apologizing to Muslims.&lt;ref name=posterdescribed/&gt;

Norris' change in position received varying reactions from commentators. [[Kathleen Parker]], an opinion columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', wrote, "Norris's cartoon was a fine idea, but she should be relieved of further duty or responsibility."&lt;ref name=kpfos&gt;Parker, Kathleen, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/04/27/AR2010042703813.html?hpid=opinionsbox1 "Freedom of sketch"], opinion article, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', April 27, 2010. Retrieved April 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Alex Spillius commented, "No one should blame Norris for withdrawing from the fray, for this kind of case throws up lingering and insidious uncertainties. Any threat could blow over quickly or endure, [[The Satanic Verses controversy|Rushdie-style]], for decades. The row over the cartoons depicting Mohammed in the Danish paper Jyllands-Posten percolated for months before bubbling over into violent protests."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Spillius | first = Alex | title =America's disappointing reaction to South Park censorship |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | publisher = Telegraph Media Group Limited | date = May 1, 2010| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/7663598/Americas-disappointing-reaction-to-South-Park-censorship.html| accessdate = May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Wei of ''[[The Business Insider]]'' was more critical of the decision by the cartoonist to withdraw from the protest movement, with an article titled, "Artist Who Proposed 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day!'

In a May 17, 2010 article in ''[[The Daily Bruin]]'', writer Tyler Dosaj noted that numbers of both supporters and critics of the protest movement were increasing: "The Facebook group is 35,000 strong. To compare, the anti-Draw Mohammed Day group is almost 30,000 strong.

First, they consciously call into question the nature of representation, no small matter in fights over whether it is allowed under Islamic law to depict Mohammed ... Second, each of the images forces the viewer to actively participate not simply in the creation of meaning but of actually constructing the image itself."&lt;ref name="andthewinneris" /&gt; There were two images in the position of [[runner-up]] – one was an artistic rendition of a [[Smoking pipe (tobacco)|tobacco smoking pipe]].&lt;ref name="andthewinneris"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Gillespie | first =Nick|authorlink=Nick Gillespie |author2=[[Matt Welch]]  | title =And The Winner of The Everybody Draw Mohammad Contest is... | work =[[Reason (magazine)|Reason.com]]| publisher = Reason Magazine | date = May 20, 2010 | url =http://reason-contest.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html | accessdate = May 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The depiction references [[surrealist]] artist [[René Magritte]], and includes the text, "This is not a pipe.

==Reception==

===Support===
The idea for the May 20 protest received support from [[Kathleen Parker]], an opinion columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "Americans love their free speech and have had enough of those who think they can dictate the limits of that fundamental right. [...] Draw to any heart's discontent. It's a free country. For now."&lt;ref name=kpfos/&gt; The idea also received support from prominent bloggers and bloggers on prominent websites, such as [[Michael C. Moynihan]] at ''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]'' magazine's "Hit &amp; Run" blog, who encouraged his readers to send him their drawings.&lt;ref name="moynihan423"&gt;Moynihan, Michael C., [http://reason.com/blog/2010/04/23/first-annual-everybody-draw-mo "First Annual Everybody Draw Mohammad Day"], blog post, April 23, 2010, "Hit &amp; Run" blog, ''Reason'' magazine website.

Yet there is one religious figure we can't make fun of. The point of the episode that started the controversy is that celebrities wanted Muhammad's power not to be ridiculed. How come non-Muslims aren't allowed to make jokes?"&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt; Moynihan posited that the decision of Comedy Central to enact [[self-censorship]] of the ''South Park'' episode would have the impact of worsening the situation.&lt;ref name="moye" /&gt;

"Indignation from those who claim the right to engage in criticism of religion is as important as the indignation that comes from the Muslim side," he told the  [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]] (Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation). "I think that this is an attitude that goes deeper than whether these drawings are blasphemous or not." [[Vebjørn Selbekk]], a Norwegian editor who was threatened in 2006 after he reprinted [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Danish cartoons of Mohammed]] in his publication, supported the May 20 protest. "I think maybe this is the right way to react—with humor, and also to spread this number, so it isn't only a few who sit with all the threats and all the discomfort associated with defending our freedom of speech in this area," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Vold, Henrik Brattli, [http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/kultur/1.7097202 "Alle skal tegne Muhammed"], article, NRK (Norsk Rikskringkasting AS—[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]), April 26, 2010, in Norwegian (Selbekk: "og jeg synes kanskje dette er den riktige måten å reagere på – med humor, og også å spre dette på flere, så det ikke bare er noen få som blir sittende med alle truslene "; Rønning: "Jeg mener nok at indignasjonen fra dem som hevder retten til å drive religionskritikk er like viktig som den indignasjonen som kommer fra den muslimske siden.

Franz Kruger, writing for the ''[[Mail &amp; Guardian]]'', called Everybody Draw Mohammed Day a "silly Facebook initiative" and found "the undertone of a 'clash of civilisations'" in it "disturbing", noting that "it is clear that some feel great satisfaction at what they see as 'sticking it to the Muslims'."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =  Kruger| first =Franz | title = Why draw the Prophet? | work =  [[Mail &amp; Guardian]] | date =May 28, 2010  | url =http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-05-28-why-draw-the-prophet | accessdate = May 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mail &amp; Guardian'', which had itself published a controversial cartoon of Mohammed in its pages, distanced itself from the group, noting that it "claimed to be a protest against restrictions on freedom of speech and religious fanaticism, but had seemingly become a forum for venting Islamophobic sentiment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Sapa | title = M&amp;G regrets cartoon offence over prophet | work = [[The Daily Dispatch]] | date = May 31, 2010 | url = http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=405490 | accessdate = June 11, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110615142819/http://www.dispatch.co.za/article.aspx?id=405490 | archivedate = June 15, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugo Rifkind]], writing for ''[[The Times]]'', called the Facebook initiative a "grubby project": "... there’s something here that makes me twitch.

In Pakistan, an editorial in ''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'', the country's oldest English-language newspaper, said that there was no doubt that the Facebook initiative "was in poor taste and deserving of strong condemnation," adding that it was "debatable whether freedom of expression should extend to material that is offensive to the sensibilities, traditions and beliefs of religious, ethnic or other communities." However, the editorial called the Lahore High Court's decision to block Facebook a "knee-jerk reaction," saying that, "many users feel, and rightly so, that they can decide for themselves what is or is not offensive, and choose not to access material that is repugnant to their beliefs," and that the block might "have played right into the hands of those who think nothing of displaying or publishing material that denigrates their beliefs. By reacting the way we do we only harm ourselves and, in the process, even become a subject of derision."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Staff |title=Facebook furore |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]] |date=May 21, 2010 |url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/19-facebook-furore-150-hh-09 |accessdate=May 30, 2010 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524012334/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/the-newspaper/editorial/19-facebook-furore-150-hh-09 |archivedate=May 24, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis===
The protest movement and incidents surrounding the [[censorship]] of the ''South Park'' episode were discussed on the [[National Public Radio]] program, ''[[Talk of the Nation]]'', where commentators including [[Ross Douthat]] analyzed the phenomenon of Norris withdrawing from the cartoon.&lt;ref name="douthat"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Douthat  | first = Ross |authorlink=Ross Douthat | title =  You Can't Portray Muhammad On TV| work = [[Talk of the Nation]]  | publisher = [[National Public Radio]] | date =April 26, 2010  | url =https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126283217  | accessdate = May 2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephanie Gutmann of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote that she had joined the Facebook group, and commented that if the [[2010 Times Square car bomb attempt]] was found to be related to the ''[[South Park]]'' episode "[[200 (South Park)|200]]", "this sort of protest will be more important than ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Gutmann | first =  Stephanie   | title = Facebook group says make May 20 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'  |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date = May 3, 2010 | url = http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/stephaniegutmann/100037736/facebook-group-says-make-may-20-everybody-draw-mohammed-day/ | accessdate = May 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Faster Times]]'', journalist Noah Lederman noted that Norris' cartoon, "was her way of supporting the show’s creators and the First Amendment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Lederman | first = Noah  | title =South Park, Mohammed, and the First Amendment  | work =[[The Faster Times]] | publisher = thefastertimes.com | date = May 4, 2010 | url =http://www.isisiraq.com/south-park-mohammed-and-the-first-amendment/  | accessdate =May 5, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing for ''[[Financial Times]]'', John Lloyd commented on the decision by Norris to withdraw from the protest movement and noted, "Molly Norris proposed a 'let’s everyone draw Mohammed day' – then, apparently appalled by her own audacity, backed quickly away."&lt;ref name="johnlloyd"&gt;{{Cite news| last =  Lloyd| first =John | title = Hard men and high drama: life imitating art? | work =  [[Financial Times]] | date =May 8, 2010  | url =http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bbd083d6-595c-11df-99ba-00144feab49a.html  | accessdate = May 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'', Austin Dacey compared the protest movement to [[Martin Luther]], stating, "Forget the ''South Park'' dust up; forget Everybody Draw Muhammad Day. If you want to see truly shocking anti-religious cartoons, you have to go back to the sixteenth century. Near the end of Luther’s life, his propaganda campaign against Rome grew increasingly vitriolic and his language grotesquely pungent."&lt;ref name="austindacey"&gt;{{Cite news| last =Dacey  | first = Austin  | title =  Satire is Religion – The debate over cartoons and prophets is not just about free of speech; it’s about freedom of religion.| work = Religion Dispatches | publisher =www.religiondispatches.org | date = May 12, 2010 | url = http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/culture/2561/satire_is_religion/ | accessdate = May 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dacey argued, "The debate over cartoon depictions of the Prophet Muhammad is often framed as a clash between free speech and religious attitudes. But it is just as much a clash between ''conflicting'' religious attitudes, and the freedom at stake is not only freedom of expression but freedom of religion. For while Luther was surely engaging in offensive speech, he was also exercising a right of freedom of conscience, which included the right to dissent from Catholic orthodoxy."&lt;ref name="austindacey" /&gt;

In an analysis of the protest movement for the ''[[Daily Bruin]]'', journalist Jordan Manalastas commented, "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day is a chance to reinstate offense and sincerity to their proper place, freed from terror or silence. ... The proper (and, at the risk of looking [[jingoistic]], American) way to combat bad speech is with better speech. To silence and be silenced are the refuge of cowards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Manalastas | first = Jordan  | title =Cartoonist criticized for creating ‘Everybody Draw Mohammed Day’ should have defended her right to First Amendment  | work = [[Daily Bruin]]  |publisher = www.dailybruin.com, [[University of California, Los Angeles]] | date = May 17, 2010 | url =http://www.dailybruin.com/articles/2010/5/17/cartoonist-criticized-creating-everybody-draw-moha/  | accessdate = May 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an analysis of the protest movement for ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]] was critical of the concept of "mocking Muhammad," writing, "... these two camps – the Muhammad-knockers and the Muslim offence-takers – are locked in a deadly embrace. Islamic extremists need Western depictions of Muhammad as evidence that there is a new crusade against Islam, while the Muhammad-knockers need the [[flag-burning]], street-stomping antics of the extremists as evidence that their defence of the Enlightenment is a risky, important business."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = O'Neill | first = Brendan | title =Mocking Muhammad: a shallow Enlightenment  | work =[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked magazine]] | publisher = www.spiked-online.com | date =May 19, 2010  | url = http://www.spiked-online.com/newsite/article/8894#.WDk70orQeUk | accessdate = November 26, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[editorial cartoonist]]s quoted by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blogger Michael Cavna were critical of the Draw Mohammed Day idea or declined to participate, although all supported the right of cartoonists to depict Mohammed if they chose to.&lt;ref name=Cavna20May&gt;Michael Cavna, [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/05/their_turn_12_top_cartoonists.html THEIR TURN: 12 top cartoonists offer their take on 'Draw Muhammad Day'], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blog ''Comics Riff'' (May 20, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;  The president of the [[Association of American Editorial Cartoonists]] opposed involvement because, "something like that can be too easily co-opted by interest groups who, I suspect, have an agenda that goes beyond a simple defense of free expression."&lt;ref name=Cavna20May/&gt;  Other cartoonists quoted in the article called the event, "childish and needlessly provocative," or demurred because they dislike, "choreographed punditry."&lt;ref name=Cavna20May/&gt;

He also defended [[The First Amendment|the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution]] in the way that it's an important right of all Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theglobalexperts.org/comment-analysis/drawing-the-prophet-muhammad-should-not-be-an-issue|title=Drawing the Prophet Muhammad is not the issue|author=Tarek Kahlaoui|date=May 17, 2010|publisher=Global Expert Finder|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threat on Molly Norris's life, forced into hiding==
On July 11, 2010, it was reported that the Yemeni-American al-Qaeda cleric [[Anwar al-Awlaki]] had put Molly Norris on a hitlist. In the English version of the [[al-Qaeda]] magazine  ''[[Inspire (magazine)|Inspire]],'' Al-Awlaki wrote, "The medicine prescribed by the Messenger of Allah is the execution of those involved," and was quoted as saying, &lt;blockquote&gt;The large number of participants makes it easier for us because there are more targets to choose from in addition to the difficulty of the government offering all of them special protection ...

[[FBI]] officials reportedly notified Norris warning her that they considered it a "very serious threat."&lt;ref name="hitlist" /&gt;&lt;ref name="threat" /&gt;

Norris has since changed her name and gone into hiding.

The '''First Satanic Church''' is an organization founded by [[Karla LaVey]] on October 31, 1997 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], that is dedicated to [[LaVeyan Satanism]] as codified by [[Anton LaVey]] in ''[[The Satanic Bible]]''. The church's stated mission is to carry on the legacy of Anton LaVey through "the study of Satanism and the occult sciences".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satanicchurch.com/content/about.aspx About the Church]&lt;/ref&gt; The church operates '''''The 600 Club''''', an internet forum dedicated to discussions of Satanism.{{sfn|Controversial New Religions|James R. Lewis, Jesper Aagaard Petersen|2005|page=453}}

The church's website claims the organization to have been founded in 1966, and the 1999 date to be a "re-establishment" of the Church of Satan, claiming direct continuity with Anton LaVey. Karla asserts that she is re-representing the original teachings of her father from which the current administration of the Church of Satan has departed, and maintains an elitist stance of her fathers original organization. Anton LaVey's book, ''The Satanic Bible'' is stated as required reading prior to joining the First Satanic Church.{{sfn|Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America|Eugene V. Gallagher, W. Michael Ashcraft|2006|page=162}}

==History==
[[File:Karla LaVey.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Karla LaVey during a "Black X-Mass" celebration.]]
On [[Walpurgisnacht]], April 30, 1966, Anton LaVey founded the "Satanic Church" (which he would later rename the "[[Church of Satan]]"). On October 29, 1997, Anton LaVey died of [[pulmonary edema]]. On November 7, 1997, Karla held a press conference to announce Anton's death. It was at this time that [[Blanche Barton]] and Karla LaVey announced that they would run the [[Church of Satan]] as co-High Priestesses. Several days later, Barton produced a hand written will claiming that LaVey had left all of his belongings, property, writings, and royalties, including the Church of Satan, to be put in a trust managed by Barton. Karla contested this will, which was later found to be invalid{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}. A settlement was later reached in which Anton’s belongings, writings, and royalties would be split among his three children and that Barton would receive the “corporation known as Church of Satan.” 

Blanche Barton, LaVey's partner and confidant, assumed the administrative role of the Church. Shortly thereafter, Barton appointed [[Peter H. Gilmore]] and his wife [[Peggy Nadramia]] to the positions of High Priest and Priestess, and the Church's headquarters were subsequently moved to [[New York City]]. Karla was critical of Barton's administration of the Church, as she felt the Church's move to New York to be a disservice to her father's legacy.{{sfn|Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America|Eugene V. Gallagher, W. Michael Ashcraft|2006|p=162}} Ms. LaVey and Barton's parting of ways was primarily due to legal disputes regarding Anton LaVey's will and inheritance.{{sfn|Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices|J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann|2010|page=701}} Consequently, Karla founded the "First Satanic Church" to carry on the legacy of her father, and continues to run it out of San Francisco, California.

==Activities==

The organization maintains only a modest internet presence.{{sfn|Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America|Eugene V. Gallagher, W. Michael Ashcraft|2006|page=162}} The church held a Walpurgisnacht Show in April 2005 at the 12 Galaxies [[nightclub]] in San Francisco, as well as a pre-[[Halloween]] benefit show in October 2005 at Edinburgh Castle (also in San Francisco) to help the victims of [[Hurricanes]] [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]] and [[Hurricane Rita|Rita]]. Since 1998, the Satanic Church has been presenting its Annual Black X-Mass Show every December. These events are open to the public, although membership is not open to the public.

Karla LaVey hosts a [[LaVeyan Satanism|Satanic]] [[radio show]] every week in San Francisco in which she talks and plays the music that she grew up enjoying with her father.  Listeners are encouraged to send in their CDs for playing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/first-satanic-church First Satanic Church] Answers.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The constitution of Sri Lanka states under Chapter II, Article 9, "The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana, while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Articles 10 and 14(1)(e)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Chapter_02_Amd.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221202/http://www.priu.gov.lk/Cons/1978Constitution/Chapter_02_Amd.html |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles 10 and 14(1)(e) provide all citizens the freedom to adopt, practice and teach any religion of their choice.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/new-constitution-state-religion-buddhism/&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently in 1978, Buddhism was declared as the [[State religion]] by President [[J. R. Jayawardene]]. This preferential treatment to Buddhism is therefore highly controversial in Sri Lanka,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/new-constitution-state-religion-buddhism/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/south-asia/Foremost-place-for-Buddhism-in-new-Constitution-says-Ranil/article16069387.ece&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen as the prime factor in the rise of [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Tamil separatism]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Matters related to family law, e.g., divorce, child custody and inheritance are adjudicated under customary law of the applicable ethnic or religious group.  For example, the minimum age of marriage for women is 18 years, except in the case of Muslims, who continued to follow their customary religious practices of girls attaining marrying age with the onset of puberty and men when they are financially capable of supporting a family.&lt;ref name="StateDpt2011"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2011religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|website=US State Department International Religious Freedom Report 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At times, local police and government officials appeared to be acting in concert with Buddhist nationalist organizations. In addition, in 2013 NGOs allege that government officials provided assistance, or at least tacitly supported the actions of societal groups targeting religious minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2013religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|website=US State Department Religious Freedom Report 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the government established a special religious police unit to deal with religious complaints. The new unit reports to the Ministry of Law and Order, although it is housed in the Buddhist Division of the Ministry of Buddhist Sasana and Religious Affairs. Critics argue that it will bolster and strengthen the violent Buddhist groups.eg:-BBS (srilankan buddhist terror group) &lt;ref name="StateDpt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/religiousfreedom/index.htm#wrapper|website=US State Department International Religious Freedom Report 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no existing legislation which restricts the right of individuals to proselytize members of one faith to convert them to another religion. Foreign clergy may work in the country, but for the last three decades, the government has limited the issuance of temporary work permits. Work permits for foreign clergy are issued for one year (rather than five years as in the past). It is possible to obtain extensions of work permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka|url=http://www.religlaw.org/index.php?blurbId=22271&amp;table=Blurb|website=ReligLaw – International Center for Law and Religious Studies,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coexistence has been recently marred by isolated incidents and attacks on religious places by Buddhist terrorists [[wiktionary:mob|mobs]] and by LTTE. Similarly Sri Lankan air force particularly has air raided Hindu, Christian shrines during the peak of war thinking that LTTE is taking shelter in there. 

Several Hindu temples were attacked in the riots of 1983 in [[Colombo]] and South of Sri Lanka.

Two of the holiest sites for Buddhists in Sri Lanka, the Sri Maha Bodhi Tree and the [[Temple of the Tooth]], have been attacked and bombed by the [[LTTE]]. In recent times, the LTTE have also attacked several Muslim [[mosques]] in the North-Eastern parts of the country. 

[[Navaly church bombing]] is one instance where the bombing of a church was blamed on the Sri Lankan air force, although there was no adequate evidence to clearly establish whether the Sri Lankan air force or the LTTE terrorists were responsible for this bombing incident.

'''Freedom of religion in [[Sri Lanka]]''' is however claimed to have been historically upheld through [[Freedom of religion|religious tolerance]] {{citation needed|reason=Sri Lanka is a home to ethnic religious riots. Provide citation to prove it|date=April 2016}}. The practice of [[Hinduism]] was allowed under [[Sinhala people|Sinhala]] kings since the Anuradhapura era. [[Buddhist]] Sinhala kings gave protection to [[Muslims]] fleeing from Portuguese persecution and to [[Catholics]] fleeing from persecution by the Dutch after having been defeated by the Portuguese.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13327">{{Tenrikyo sidebar}}
In [[Tenrikyo]], '''God''' is a [[monotheism|single]] divine being and [[creator deity|creator]] of the entire universe. The first two characters in the Japanese [[kanji]] for Tenri-O-no-Mikoto are 天理, where 天 refers to heaven or divinity, and 理 refers to reason or knowledge, thus "Tenri" (天理) refers to divine or heavenly knowledge, and in a sense adds a divine nature to truth itself whereas "天理" also means "natural law" or its pseudonym, "divine law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Breen|first1=Jim|title=天理|url=http://www.yamasa.cc/ocjs/kanjidic.nsf/3384af83adcc72a349256a54001329f6/299df1f1f53018b949256cd4000a5902?OpenDocument|website=The Yamasa Institute - オンライン日本語学習 - Online Kanji Dictionary|publisher=The Yamasa Institute|accessdate=9 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English name most frequently used to refer to Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto outside of ritual is "God the Parent"; in Japanese, the equivalent common name is ''Oyagamisama''. In Tenrikyo, God has no [[gender]].

Tenrikyo followers vary in their understanding of this creator, from the early understanding of spirit (''[[kami]]'', god/deity) through the underlying natural causality (''Tsukihi'', moon-sun) and eventually to an understanding of a parental relationship between the creator and themselves (''oya'', parent). This progression of understanding is a key teaching of Tenrikyo, where it is accepted that everything must proceed "step by step" &amp;mdash; by small stages of understanding instead of by great leaps of faith.

==Names==
[[File:Kokan in Osaka.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Nakayama Kokan spreading the divine name ''Tenri-O-no-Mikoto'' (天理王命) in [[Osaka]].]]
In historical documents and scriptures related to Tenrikyo, a number of different appellations are ascribed to God.{{sfn|Ellwood|1982|p=81}} 

In the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'', God identified as three different entities. In 1869, when the first verses were composed, God initially identified as ''[[kami]]'' (神), a [[spirit]] in the Japanese [[Shinto]] tradition. The designation ''kami'' was broader than the [[Abrahamic religions|Abrahamic]] notion of God, as it could be applied to any object that possessed divine power or inspired awe, such as animals, trees, places, and people. However, the ''[[Ofudesaki]]'' stressed the uniqueness of the ''kami'' by adding various qualifiers such as ''moto no kami'' (God ''of origin''), ''shinjitsu no kami'' (God ''of truth''), and ''kono yō o hajimeta kami'' (God ''who began this world'').{{sfn|Becker|1979|p=2}} From 1874, God began to identify as ''tsukihi'' (月日), or moon-sun, and from 1879, God began to identify as ''oya'' (をや), or parent, though ''kami'' and ''tsukihi'' continued to be used until the last part of the scripture.{{sfn|Becker|1979|pp=3–4}} 

In Tenrikyo's creation story, outlined in the ''Ofudesaki'' and elaborated upon in various notes on her talks known collectively as ''kōki'', there are ten figures credited with the creation of human beings. Some Tenrikyo authorities suggest that two of these figures, ''Kunitokotachi-no-Mikoto'' and ''Omotari-no-Mikoto'', represent ''tsukihi'', or more precisely the duality ''tsuki-sama'' and ''hi-sama''. The other eight figures are tools subordinate to ''tsukihi'' that were drawn in, consulted, and trained in the creation of human beings.{{sfn|Becker|1979|p=9}} 

In the ''[[Mikagura-uta]],'' the songs of Tenrikyo's [[liturgy]], God is commonly referred to as ''[[kami]].'' At the end of most of the songs, God is invoked with the name ''Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto,'' (てんりおうのみこと or 天理王命) or "absolute ruler of divine reason."

The historical sources written during Nakayama Miki's lifetime and in the years following her death suggest a number of other appellations of God. In Nakayama Shinnosuke's ''Oyasama gyoden,'' the source on which ''[[The Life of Oyasama]]'' is primarily based, Miki refers to God as ''ten no shōgun'' ([[Shōgun]] of [[Heaven]]) in the initial revelation. In early attempts to obtain religious sanctions from the Yoshida Administrative Office of Shinto and a Shingon Buddhist temple, the name of God was recorded as ''Tenrin-Ō-Myōjin'' (天輪王明神) and ''Tenrin-Ō-Kōsha'' (転輪王講社) respectively. An early doctrine of the Tenrikyo church, written to conform to the State Shinto doctrine at the time, records the name as ''Tenri-Ōkami''.

Tenrikyo's current doctrine maintains that ''Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto'' is the divine name to be used in the context of prayer.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|p=29}} The doctrine frequently refers to God as God the Parent (親神様 ''oyagamisama''), emphasizing the parental nature of God revealed toward the end of the ''Ofudesaki''.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|p=10}} The doctrine claims that the changes in God's names in the ''Ofudesaki'', from ''kami'' to ''tsukihi'' to ''oya'', were made in accordance with the spiritual growth of the early followers.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|pp=8–10}}

==Attributes==
A number of qualities have been ascribed to God as understood in Tenrikyo, by both Tenrikyo and [[religious studies]] scholars.

===Healer===
Out of a fundamental desire to see people thrive, God, through [[Nakayama Miki]], showed followers several ways by which they could receive God's healing power. At first, Miki administered the grant of safe childbirth, where she would lay her hands and breathe on the hands of pregnant women and would assure them of easy delivery if they relied on God. Later, Miki taught a [[faith healing|healing prayer]] called the ''[[Sazuke]]'' and a [[liturgy]] called the [[Service (Tenrikyo)|Service]], intended as specific rituals followers could perform to heal people physically and spiritually. In addition, Miki gave sacred [[amulets]] to those who had visited her residence, which she said would protect her followers from disease and decay. However, Miki asserted that, for God's healing to be effective, the participants must have full faith in God and the desire to purify their hearts (Ofudesaki X:20–24, XII:91–94).{{sfn|Becker|1979|pp=18–20}}

===Immanence===
In Tenrikyo, God is [[Immanence|immanent]] in the sense that God provides for all matter in the [[universe]], such as human bodies, living organisms and inanimate objects, and sustains all of the physical processes behind them. In the ''Ofudesaki'', the universe is referred to as the "body of God" (Ofudesaki III:40, 135).{{sfn|Iida|1986|pp=56–58}} In Tenrikyo's doctrine, God's providence over the universe explained as the  "ten aspects of God's complete providence" (十全の守護 ''jūzen no shugō''; see section on Providences).

===Omnipotence===
A frequently appearing term in the ''Ofudesaki'' is ''jūyō'' or ''jūyōjizai'', translated as "[[omnipotence]]" or "free and unlimited workings." This omnipotence permeates the physical world and its laws, for example, the God of Tenrikyo is the cause of natural disasters such as rainstorms and earthquakes (Ofudesaki VI:91), and of events in one's personal life, such as dreams and diseases (Ofudesaki VIII:58). However the physical laws of the world can be superseded at times in order to produce miracles, which suggests that God's power is not purely mechanical or rigid.{{sfn|Becker|1979|pp=12–14}}{{sfn|Ellwood|1982|p=82}}

===Omniscience===
The ''Ofudesaki'' imply God's [[omniscience]] by asserting that there is nothing that God does not know (Ofudesaki VIII:11, XVI:42) and that God scrutinizes the hearts of all people (VIII:52–3, XVII:29). With this omniscience, God gives appropriate returns to each individual depending on how close his or her mind is in accordance with God's intention.{{sfn|Becker|1979|pp=15}}

===Personhood===
In Tenrikyo, God is a [[personal god]] who acts as an idealized parent. Just as parents conceive and raise their children, God took part in the conception of human beings and continues to be involved in their upbringing. God moves, plans, acts, and expresses emotions such as love and regret in order to guide human beings toward greater spiritual maturity and joy.{{sfn|Ellwood|1982|p=82}}{{sfn|Iida|1986|p=58–62}}

===Transcendence===
The God of Tenrikyo [[Transcendence (religion)|transcends]] time and space and rejects systematic classification. Because of this quality, God has the ability to become finite and limited so that God's teachings could be understood by human beings, i.e. through the life and writings of [[Nakayama Miki]].{{sfn|Iida|1986|p=54–8}}

==Revelation==
Tenrikyo's doctrine claims that God was revealed through [[Nakayama Miki]] on the lunar calendar date of 26 October 1838, in order to clarify the means of humankind's [[salvation]]. Because God was hidden before that time, God's teachings could not be fully understood by human beings. &lt;ref&gt;"God the Parent, Tenri-O-no-Mikoto," ''Kaitei Tenrikyo jiten,'' pp. 141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Verses in the ''Ofudesaki'' acknowledge the revealed nature of God (e.g. I:3, XI:67), and the ''[[Osashizu]]'' makes a number of references to the time when God became revealed.{{sfn|Sawai|1986|pp=23–5}}

==Providences==
The immanent providence of God in Tenrikyo is distinguished into ten aspects, each endowed with a sacred name, a function in the human body, and a function in the world.{{sfn|Tenrikyo Church Headquarters|1993|pp=30–1}} These aspects are represented by dancers in the portion of Tenrikyo's [[liturgy]] known as the [[Service (Tenrikyo)#Kagura Service|Kagura Service]].

==History==
In 1880, in order to evade continuous persecution by the government, Tenrikyo placed itself under the administration of a [[Shugendo]] temple named Jifukuji. During this time ''Tenri-Ō-no-Mikoto'' was officially called ''Tenrin-Ō-[[Nyorai]]'' and the ''[[kanji]]'' of various other deities were changed, but by 1890 Tenrikyo was given approval by the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji]] government and the original names were restored.&lt;ref&gt;Henry van Straelen.

'''Gut''', '''kut''' or '''goot''' ({{lang|ko-Hang|굿}}) are the [[rite]]s performed by [[Korean shamans]], involving offerings and sacrifices to gods and ancestors.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=27}} They are characterised by rhythmic movements, songs, oracles and prayers.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=40}} These rites are meant to create welfare, promoting commitment between the spirits and mankind.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=27}} The major categories of rites are the ''naerim-gut'', the ''dodang-gut'' and the ''ssitgim-gut''.

Through song and dance, the shaman begs the gods to intervene in the fortune of men. The shaman wears a very colourful costume and normally speaks in [[ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]]. During a rite, the shaman changes his or her costume several times. Rituals consist of various phases, called ''gori''.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=31}}

==Importance of threefoldness==
The ''gut'' is meant as a crossroads where three participants met: The gods, the believers, and the shamans who mediate between them. The communion between spirits and mankind is believed to take place through a cup of purified [[wine]], called ''bokjan'' or "cup of blessings".{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=38}} There are different types of ''gut'', which vary from region to region. The procedure and style of these rites largely depends on the purpose of the ceremony, and on the character and abilities of the performing shaman. However, the rites generally show threefold structures—for instance, dances and songs repeated three times.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=38}} 

Threefold repetition has an important symbolic meaning in Korean shamanism, being considered the best way to complete an action.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=38}} Its meaning is grounded in the theological conception of the threefoldness of God—''Hwanin'', ''[[Hwanung]]'', ''[[Dangun]]''—, the three stages of manifestation of ''[[Haneullim]]''.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=39}}

==Importance of purification==
Purity of both the body and the mind is a state that is required for taking part in rituals.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=38}} Purification is considered necessary for an efficacious communion between living people and ancestral forms.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=38}} Before any ''gut'' is performed, the altar is always purified by fire and water, as part of the first ''gori'' of the ritual itself.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=38}} The colour white, extensively used in rituals, is regarded as a symbol of purity.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=38}} The purification of the body is performed by burning white paper.{{sfnb|Lee|1981|p=38}} Of course these specifics depend upon the Korean shaman's spiritual lineage/house.

==Typology of ''gut'' rites==
[[File:Hyewon-Munyeo.sinmu.jpg|thumb|''Munyeo sinmu'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|무녀신무}}, {{lang|ko-Hant|巫女神舞}}), painted by [[Hyewon|Shin Yunbok]] in the late [[Joseon]] (1805).]]

===Main types===

====''Naerim-gut'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|내림굿}})====
This gut is an initiation rite. As part of the rite, someone becomes a shaman by being possessed by spirits who are officiated by Heaven  to become gods. This rite is only able to be done through another Korean shaman and cannot be held on one's own. This ritual causes the ''shinbyeong'', a temporary acute psychotic manic episode, to disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|1998|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Dodang-gut'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|도당굿}})====
This communal rite is common in central provinces in [[South Korea]]. Its aim is to wish for the well-being and prosperity of a particular village or hamlet. This rite is normally held annually or once every few years. It is always held either around the New Year or in spring or autumn. The ''dodang-gut'' is distinguished by giving prominent roles to the female ''mudang''.

====''Ssitgim-gut'' ({{lang|ko-Hang|씻김굿}})====
This rite is used to cleanse the spirit of a deceased person. Since ancient times there is a Korean belief that when somebody dies, their body cannot enter the world of the dead because of the impurity of their spirit. The ''ssitgim-gunt'' washes away this impurity. It is observed mainly in the provinces in the south west of [[South Korea]].

====''Chaesu-gut'' (재수굿)====
During the sequential performance of the twelve segments that comprise a typical ''chaesugut'', more than half of the costumes the ''mansin'' wears are male. The most interactive and dynamic portions of the ''gut'' usually occur during the ''mansin's'' possession by the ''pyolsang'' (spirits of the other world) and the greedy ''taegam'' (the overseer), which require male costumes. This [[cross-dressing]] serves several purposes. First, since the ''mansin'' is often possessed by both male and female spirits and can thus become an icon of the opposite sex, it is reasonable that she use the attire of both sexes. But in a context in which women are publicly demeaned, where their symbolic value is reduced by strong [[Confucianism|Confucian]] ideology, the female ''mansin's'' cross-dressing becomes complex and multi-functional.&lt;ref name="heinzinsufenkl"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fenkl|first=Heinz Insu|title=Dancing on Knives: An Introduction to the Politics of Sexuality and Gender in Korean Shamanism|url=http://heinzinsufenkl.net/knives.html|date=1980s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In semiotic terms, the costume is an icon for the person or the spirit it represents. The mansin in the costume assumes the role of that icon, thereby becoming a female signifying a male; she is a cross-sex icon about 75% of the time during a typical ''gut''. In the context of the ''gut'', the ''mansin'' is a sexually liminal being; by signifying a man, she not only has access to the male authority in the Confucian order, she provides the female audience an opportunity to interact with that authority in ways that would, in a public context, be unthinkable. Her performance is often a parody of the male authority figures; she often makes off-color jokes and ribald comments, and argues with the audience.&lt;ref name="heinzinsufenkl" /&gt;

===Regional types===
The traditional rites are not linked to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. They are linked either to a particular event, such as a death, or the [[lunar calendar]].

{{God |isms}}
'''Ignosticism''' or '''igtheism''' is the idea that the question of the existence of God is meaningless because the term {{em|god}} has no coherent and unambiguous definition. It may also be described as the theological position that every other theological position (including [[agnosticism]]) assumes too much about the concept of god and many other theological concepts.

==Terminology==
The term ''ignosticism'' was coined in the 1960s by [[Sherwin Wine]], a [[rabbi]] and a founding figure of [[Humanistic Judaism]].

==Distinction from theological noncognitivism==
Ignosticism and [[theological noncognitivism]] are similar although whereas the ignostic says "every theological position assumes too much about the concept of God", the theological noncognitivist claims to have no concept whatever to label as "a concept of God",&lt;ref&gt;Conifer, ''Theological Noncognitivism'': "Theological noncognitivism is usually taken to be the view that the sentence 'God exists' is cognitively meaningless."&lt;/ref&gt; but the relationship of ignosticism to other nontheistic views is less clear. While [[Paul Kurtz]] finds the view to be compatible with both [[weak atheism]] and agnosticism,&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, ''New Skepticism'', 220: "Both [atheism and agnosticism] are consistent with igtheism, which finds the belief in a metaphysical, transcendent being basically incoherent and unintelligible."&lt;/ref&gt; other philosophers{{Who|date=March 2018}} consider ignosticism to be distinct.

==Historical overview==

===Islamic arrival on the Swahili Coast===
{{islam by country}}

Pioneer Muslim traders arrived on the [[Swahili Coast]] around the eighth century. The tension surrounding the succession of Muhammad, the prophet of Islam, and the already established trade links between the [[Persian Gulf]] and the Swahili Coast were some of the factors leading to this development.

Archaeological evidence attests to a thriving Muslim town on Manda Island by the Tenth Century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Salim:1973&lt;/ref&gt; The Moroccan Muslim traveller, Ibn Battuta, visiting the Swahili Coast in 1331 AD, reported a strong Muslim presence. Ibn Battuta said:
The inhabitants are pious, honourable, and upright, and they have well-built wooden mosques.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Batuta:5&lt;/ref&gt;

On arrival, the Muslims settled along the coast, engaging in trade. The [[Shirazi (ethnic group)|Shirazi]] intermarried with the local Bantu people resulting in the [[Swahili people]], most of who converted to Islam. Swahili, structurally a Bantu Language with heavy borrowings from Arabic, was born.&lt;ref&gt;Quraishy:1987:154&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily, Islam spread through the interactions of individuals, with the [[Arab Muslims]] who had settled in small groups maintaining their culture, and religious practices. Despite encountering local communities, Islam was not ‘indigenized’ along the patterns of the local Bantu communities. Nevertheless, Islam grew through absorption of individuals into the newly established Afro-Arabic Muslim communities. This resulted in more ‘Swahilization’ than Islamization.&lt;ref name="Trimingham:1983:53"&gt;Trimingham:1983:53&lt;/ref&gt;

There was strong resistance toward Islam by the majority of communities living in the interior. The resistance was because conversion was an individual act, leading to detribalization and integration into the Muslim community going against the socially acceptable communal life.&lt;ref name="Trimingham:1983:53"/&gt;

Islam on the Swahili Coast was different from the rest of Africa. Unlike West Africa where Islam was integrated to the local communities, the local Islam was ‘foreign’; the Arab-Muslims lived as if they were in the Middle East.

The primary concern for the early Muslims was trade with a few interested in propagating Islam. The arrival of the Portuguese in the 15th Century interrupted the small work in progress. On the other hand, the interstate quarrels that ensued meant that much effort was now directed towards restoring normality and not Islamization.&lt;ref&gt;Lodhi:1994:1&lt;/ref&gt;

===The spread of Islam into the interior===
Islam remained an urban and coastal phenomenon. The Spread of Islam was low-keyed with no impact amongst the local non-Swahili African Community. There were no intermediary Africans to demonstrate that, adoption of a few Islamic institutions would not disrupt society.&lt;ref&gt;Trimingham:1983:54&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of Islam to the interior was hampered by several factors: for instance, the nature of the Bantu society’s varied beliefs, and scattered settlements affected interior advancement. Other factors included, harsh climatic conditions, the fierce tribes like the Maasai, tribal laws restricting passage through their land, health factors, and the lack of easy mode of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Holway:1970:25&lt;/ref&gt; For Trimingham, the brand of Islam introduced to the region was equally to blame.

Muslim traders were not welcome in the social structures thereby impeding any meaningful progress until the beginning of European occupation.

Other factors affecting Islamic movement into the interior included; atrocities committed during slave trading, as these unfavourably affected the spread of Islam.&lt;ref name="Trimingham:1983:57"&gt;Trimingham:1983:57&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the embracing of Islam by large portions of coastal tribes in the Nineteenth Century aided in its spread.

Besides, local Muslim preachers and teachers played major roles in teaching religion (Ar. dīn) and the Qur’ān at the Qur’ān Schools (Swa. vyuo) and Madrasa attached to the Mosques.&lt;ref&gt;Quraishy:1987:174-275&lt;/ref&gt;

The coming of the second wave of Europeans, in the Nineteenth Century, brought mixed fortunes to the coastal Muslims, their strong sense of pride and belonging was greatly diminished, with efforts being redirected to self adjustments.&lt;ref&gt;Lacunza-Balda:1989:94&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fredagsmosken shella.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Mosque, in [[Lamu Island]].]]

Nonetheless, Muslim agents deployed by Europeans as subordinate labourers to assist in the establishment of Colonial administration centres, were advantageously placed throughout the country, bringing the Islamic influence to the interior.Each place where a European installed himself, military camp, government centre, or plantation, was a centre for Muslim influence.&lt;ref name="Trimingham:1983:57"/&gt;

In the interior, the Muslims neither integrated nor mingled with the local communities, yet, non-Swahili Africans began joining the Swahili trends in trade with some returning as Muslims. Swahili became the trade and religious language. Alongside the interpersonal contacts, intermarriages also yielded some conversions.

Although coastal rulers did not send missionaries to the interior, local Africans embraced Islam freely through attraction to the religious life of the Muslims. Close integration with the local population helped to foster good relations resulting in Islam gaining a few converts, based on individual efforts.&lt;ref name="Quraishy:1987:182"&gt;Quraishy:1987:182&lt;/ref&gt;

Subjectively, most of the surrounding Bantu communities had a close-knit religious heritage, requiring strong force to penetrate. The pacification and consolidation by European powers provided the much-needed force to open up the communities for new structures of power and religious expression (Trimingham:1983:58).

Basically, progress in the spread of Islam in Kenya came between 1880 and 1930. This was when most social structures and the African worldviews were shattered, leaving them requiring a new, wider worldview encompassing or addressing the changes experienced.

Consequently, Islam introduced new religious values through external ceremonial and ritualistic expressions, some of which could be followed with no difficulty.

Socio-culturally, Muslims presented themselves with a sense of pride and a feeling of superiority. Islamic civilization was identified with the Arab way of life (Ustaarabu), as opposed to ‘barbarianism’ (Ushenzi) hence the domination of a form of Arabism over the local variety of Islam.&lt;ref name="Trimingham:1983:59"&gt;Trimingham:1983:59&lt;/ref&gt;

The ease, with which Islam could be adopted, meant adding to the indigenous practices, new religious rites and ceremonies to the African ways, with new ways of defining one’s identity by new forms of expression. Mingling with Muslims led to conversion meaning returning home as Muslims and not aliens.&lt;ref name="Trimingham:1983:59"/&gt; Lacunza-Balda shows that Islam could be adopted easily.

Although most of the conversions were of individuals, there were communities that embraced Islam en-masse. Some of these included the Digo and Pokomo of the Lower Tana region. From these communities Islam slowly penetrated inland.

===Organized Missionary activities===
Pioneer Muslim missionaries to the interior were largely Tanganyikans, who coupled their missionary work with trade, along the centres began along the railway line, such as, Kibwezi, Makindu and Nairobi.

Outstanding amongst them was Maalim Mtondo, a Tanganyikan credited with being the first Muslim missionary to Nairobi. Reaching Nairobi at the close of the Nineteenth Century, he led a group of other Muslims, and enthusiastic missionaries from the coast to establish a ‘Swahili village’ in the present day Pumwani.

A small mosque was built to serve as a starting point and he began preaching Islam in earnest. He soon attracted several Kikuyus and Wakambas, who became his disciples.&lt;ref name="Quraishy:1987:182"/&gt;

Local men converted and having learned from their teachers took up the leadership of religious matters. Khamis Ngige was a prominent local convert of the early outreach. Having learned from Maalim Mtondo, he later became the Imam of the Pumwani Mosque.
Different preachers scattered in the countryside from 1900 to 1920, introducing Islam to areas around, Mt. Kenya, Murang’a, Embu, Meru, Nyeri and Kitui. This serious missionary move interior was out of personal enthusiasm with the influence being highly localized. Only a few Africans were converted, and the impact was short lived.&lt;ref&gt;Quraishy:1987:193&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam in Western Kenya==

Muslim traders introduced Islam to the western region between 1870 and 1885. The chief Mumia of Nabongo accorded the Swahili traders warm welcome. During an intertribal war, the Muslims assisted Chief Mumia to overcome his enemies. In return, one Idd day, Chief Mumia, his family and officials of his court converted to Islam. Henceforth, Islam spread to the surrounding areas of Kakamega, Kisumu, Kisii and Bungoma.

'''The Influence and the new trends in Islamic outreach'''
Although the struggle for independence in Kenya was a very crucial time for all Kenyans, very little is documented on Muslim’s participation. Given that there were Muslims involved in the negotiation for the inclusion of the Kadhi courts in the Independent Kenya’s constitution, points to key Muslim involvement.

Events in the Muslim world from the nineteen-nineties, the experiences of crises and failures, power and success served as catalysts for the reassertion of Islam in public and private world, through a call for a return to true Islam. John Esposito sees the goal for the revivalisms as transformation of the society through Islamic formation of individuals at the grass roots (1999:20).

The growing religious revivalism in personal and public Islamic life, created awareness on Islamic beliefs, culminating to increased religious observance, building of mosques, prayer and fasting, proliferation of religious programming, publications, and emphasis on Islamic dress and values. Lately, Islamic reassertion in public life, like the quest for the upgrading of the Kadhi Courts in Kenya have not gone unnoticed (Esposito:1999:9).

Contemporary Islamic activisms are indebted to the ideology and organizational model of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhoods (Ikhwhan) led by Hassan al-Banna and Sayyid Qutb; and the Islamic Society [[Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan|Jamaat-I-Islami]] led by Mawlana Abul ala Mawdudi. Their ideas and methods of revivalism are observed in different parts of the world today. They blamed the west for misleading the Muslim leaders and the Muslim leaders for blindly following the European ways.

Whereas the [[Qur’ān]] and [[Hadith]] are fundamental, in responding to the demands and challenges of modernity, revival movements are crucial in spreading and restoring true Islam. Prolonged Muslim awareness has led to attraction to Islam, giving the converted a sense of pride.

Methods used in recent trends of Islamization, are twofold, some directed to the Muslims, and others reaching to non-Muslims. There has been increased social action, building of schools, health facilities, and relief food distribution. Moreover, proselytization is carried out through print media, broadcasting, increased formation of Missionary organizations, and organization of public debates (Mihadhara).

There is a small community of [[Muslims]] in [[Moldova]],  numbering several thousand.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2001/5635.htm US department of state ]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Spiritual Organisation of Muslims in Moldova headed by Talgat Masaev was denied registration despite the appeal of the Mission to Moldova of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=616 Forum 18 Search/Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--and this is not WikiNews--&gt;

In March 2011, the [[Islamic League of Moldova]] (Liga Islamica din Moldova), an [[NGO]] representing Moldova's Muslims, was registered by the Moldovan Justice Ministry as the first legally recognized Muslim association in Moldova. It had applied for registration in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/moldovan_muslims_orthodox_church/16797096.html Moldovan Muslim Leader 'Disappointed' By Anti-Islamic Remarks]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Moldovan Orthodox Church]] opposed the recognition of Islam and joined protests with conservative groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/content/moldova_recognition_of_muslims_angers_conservatives/24177283.html Conservatives Angered By Moldova's Recognition Of Muslims]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, officially there were just 2,000 Muslims in Moldova. But the Islamic League of Moldova  head [[Sergiu Sochirca]] said the number was closer to 17,000, though not all of them were registered as Muslims due to suppression of Islam in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.islamtoday.net/artshow-229-4087.htm Moldova's Government Considers Revoking its Formal Recognition of Islam]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
There are 2,009 Muslims living in Moldova, according to the [[2014 Moldovan Census | 2014 Republic of Moldova Census]], up from 1,667 Muslims according to the [[2004 Moldovan Census | 2004 Census]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://pop-stat.mashke.org/moldova-religion2014.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the [[Muslims]] live in [[Chişinău]] (985 people), followed by [[Găgăuzia]] (176 people), [[Bălţi]] (76 people), [[Anenii Noi]] (68 people) and [[Cahul]] (54 people).

JInsider was cofounded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/09/prweb1368214.htm |title=JInsider Launches Cutting-Edge Jewish Portal |publisher=PRWeb.com |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/jinsider-team/ |title=Jinsider Team |publisher=TimesofIsrael.com |date=2017-07-26 |accessdate=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Yaakov (Jeffrey) Greenman and [[Mark Pearlman]]. Pearlman was vice president of corporate development at [[CBS]] from 1988 to 1995,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/28/business/cbs-rejected-on-takeover.html CBS Rejected on Takeover], New York Times, published 9/28/2004&lt;/ref&gt; and Fox News executive vice president of finance and operations from 1995 to 1997. He was part of the original management team that launched the [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]] under [[Roger Ailes]] in 1996. Pearlman is also the former Chairman of the [[Children's Museum of Manhattan]] and has funded and directed other Jewish community initiatives including the website [http://sinailive.com/ Sinai Live] and the [http://myhatikvah.com/ MyHatikva] initiative for the [[Israel|State of Israel]].

==Documentary Projects==
JInsider frequently interviews prominent members of the Jewish community such as [[Neal Shapiro]], [[Malcolm Hoenlein]] and [[Joseph Telushkin]] and showcases them in a Top Jew series.  Their largest project to date involved the production and airing of the [http://www.jinsider.com/films.html Traveler's Guide for Uncertain Times] - a documentary offering wisdom for navigating the economic crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clal.org/sp175.html New Documentary Offers Wisdom for Today's "Uncertain Times"], Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis Projects and Think Tanks==
JInsider has completed three metric studies on the Jewish community: "The Jewish [[GDP]]," "The Jewish Internet Metric Study" and "The Jewish Day School Study."

The Jewish GDP study&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/creating_jewish_gdp Creating A Jewish GDP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615042155/http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/creating_jewish_gdp |date=2011-06-15 }}, The Jewish Week, published 4/22/2009&lt;/ref&gt; focused on the basic economics of the Jewish community, specifically the distribution and balance of funds throughout Jewish [[non-profit organization]]s. The study, completed in the first quarter of 2009, presented the following results:

* The Jewish GDP is $10billion ($6.7billion if the two main financial intermediaries - [[Jewish Federation]] and the Jewish Communal Fund - are excluded). This is not an exact number because many large Jewish organizations such as Chabad and the Orthodox Union are not required to file public financial information.
* Looking at the net GDP of $6.7 billion, most funds go to social welfare (36 percent), followed by education (32 percent). Seventeen percent of services provided go for communal life, with 4 percent for advocacy, 2 percent for the arts, and less than 1 percent for Arab-Israel relations.
* More than 25 percent of all funds come through the Jewish federation system, and 30 percent of all revenue is concentrated among the top 10 nonprofits, including UJA-Federation of New York, the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]], [[Hadassah]], [[American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee]], [[Yeshiva University]], FEGS Health and Human Service System, and the Jewish Geriatric Center.

The Jewish Internet Metric Study&lt;ref&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article-ambush/2009/08/31/1007518/op-ed-cooperation-and-consolidation-needed-on-jewish-web Cooperation and Consolidation Need on the Jewish Web] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516013020/http://www.jta.org/news/article-ambush/2009/08/31/1007518/op-ed-cooperation-and-consolidation-needed-on-jewish-web |date=2012-05-16 }}, The Jewish Telegraphic Agency&lt;/ref&gt; looked at three major aspects of the Jewish Web: News sites, Information/Education sites, and Search. The study, completed June 2009, presented the following results:

* Overall traffic to major Jewish news and educational/information sites is rising.
* In the news category, there is no dominant U.S. site, though together the six major U.S. news sites in this study attract roughly 800,000 unique visitors per month. This is above the approximately 700,000 unique visitors the Israeli site [http://www.haaretz.com haaretz.com] receives per month, but below the 1.45 million [http://www.jpost.com jpost.com] receives.
* In the education/information category there are a number of strong sites, with [[Chabad]] emerging as a brand leader
* Overall search traffic for Jewish terms is steadily declining

The report also included a recommendation to the Jewish news industry that the industry coordinate their assets in an online consortium to boost efficiency and sustainability.

In addition, JInsider has organized and sponsored a think-tank discussion with Jewish community leaders on the direction and goals of the community&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/toward_visioning_model_community Toward Visioning A Model Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615042330/http://www.thejewishweek.com/features/toward_visioning_model_community |date=2011-06-15 }}, The Jewish Week, published 1/28/2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jewish dance''' refers to [[dance]] associated with [[Jews]] and [[Judaism]]. Dance has long been used by Jews as a medium for the expression of joy and other communal emotions. Dancing was a favorite pastime and played a role in religious observance.&lt;ref&gt;Landa, M. J. (1926). ''The Jew in Drama'', p. 17. New York: Ktav Publishing House (1969). Each [[Jewish diaspora|Jewish diasporic]] community developed its own dance traditions for wedding celebrations and other distinguished events.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dances associated with [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] traditions, especially [[Jewish wedding]] dances, are an integral part of Jewish life in [[United States|America]] and around the world. Folk dances associated with [[Zionism]] and the formation of the State of [[Israel]] became popular in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=2680 |title=Jewish Dance in America |publisher=Jewish-theatre.com |date=2009-02-03 |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127110539/http://www.jewish-theatre.com/visitor/article_display.aspx?articleID=2680 |archivedate=2013-01-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hasidic-style dance==
Among [[Ashkenazi Jews]] dancing to [[klezmer]] music was an integral part of weddings in the [[shtetl]]. Jewish dance was influenced by local non-Jewish dance traditions, but there were clear differences, mainly in hand and arm motions, with more intricate legwork by the younger men.&lt;ref&gt;[http://borzykowska.users.ch/EnglYidDance.htm Yiddish, Klezmer, Ashkenazic or 'shtetl' dances], Le Site Genevois de la Musique Klezmer. Accessed 12 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The religious community frowned on mixed dancing, dictating separate circles for men and women.

In [[Hasidic Judaism]], dance is a tool for expressing joy and is believed to have a therapeutic effect: It purifies the soul, promotes spiritual elation and unifies the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Hasidism/Dance |title=Hasidism: Dance |publisher=Yivoencyclopedia.org |date=2008-03-09 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Horah===

The [[Hora (dance)|Horah]] is a Jewish circle dance typically danced to the music of ''[[Hava Nagila]]''. It is traditionally danced at [[Jewish wedding]]s and other joyous occasions in the Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweddingtraditions.com/ethnic_wedding_traditions/jewish_traditions.html |title=Wedding traditions |publisher=Worldweddingtraditions.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hora was introduced in Israel by the Romanian Jewish dancer [[Baruch Agadati]]. In 1924, he worked together with a composer and songwriter to choreograph a show performed by the Ohel Theater Company, which toured the pioneer settlements of the [[Jezreel Valley]]. "Horah Agadati," as the dance was known, became an instant success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/12226/ |title=Hora History |publisher=Forward.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yemenite step (Tza'ad Temani)===

==Etymology==
The word ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kāfir}}'' is the active participle of the [[triliteral|root]] [[K-P-R|K-F-R]]. As a pre-Islamic term it described farmers burying seeds in the ground. One of its applications in the Quran is also the same meaning as farmer.&lt;ref&gt;(أَعْجَبَ الْكُفَّارَ نَبَاتُهُ) [https://archive.is/20120723132603/http://www.bookstree.com/books/2/k4/k_p4_p314.htm Surah 57 Al-Hadid (Iron) Ayah 20]&lt;/ref&gt; Since farmers cover the seeds with soil while planting, the word ''{{transl|ar|DIN|kāfir}}'' implies a person who hides or covers. Ideologically, it implies a person who hides or covers the truth.  Poets personify the darkness of night as kâfir, perhaps as a survival of pre-Islamic religious or mythological usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldziher|first1=Ignác|title=Mythology among the Hebrews|date=1877|accessdate=2015-06-28|page=193|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/48967/48967-h/48967-h.htm#Page_193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noun for disbelief,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Islamic terminology|url=http://islamic-dictionary.tumblr.com/post/10098203002/kufr-arabic-is-the-term-which-describes|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "blasphemy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mansour|first1=Ahmed|title=Ahl al-Quran|url=http://www.ahl-alquran.com/English/show_article.php?main_id=6306|accessdate=11 June 2015|date=24 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; "impiety"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLvTNk75hUoC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=definition+kufr+impiety&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vBDz07KPT4&amp;sig=nJM9v0ra0YtI-_mZ90y1c3lVxEY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBGoVChMIxbL6ma2GxgIVIiSMCh2PFArk#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20kufr%20impiety&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the person who disbelieves, is ''kufr''.

The [[Hebrew]] words "''kipper''" and "''kofer''" share the same root as "''kafir''" כִּפֵּר, or [[K-F-R]]. "Kipper" has many meanings including, to "deny", "atone for", "cover", "purge", "represent", or "transfer". The last two meanings involve "[[kofer]]" that mean "ransom". "Kipper" and "kofer" are mostly likely used together in the [[Judaism|Jewish]] faith to indicate God's [[Scapegoat#The Bible|transfer of guilt from innocent parties using guilty parties]] as "ransom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2587511157/kipper.html |title="Kipper" Encyclopaedia Judaica|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|location=Detroit|pages=180–83|edition=2nd|editor=Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik |accessdate=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The practice of declaring another Muslim as a ''kafir'' is ''[[takfir]]''.&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"/&gt;   ''Kufr'' (unbelief) and ''shirk'' (polytheism) are used throughout the Quran and sometimes used interchangeably by Muslims.&lt;ref name=IQA/&gt;&lt;ref name=QSEP&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ibn Baaz|title=What is the Difference between Kufr and Shirk? [Fatawa Ibn Baaz]|url=http://qsep.com/modules.php?name=ilm&amp;d_op=article&amp;sid=888|website=Quran Sunnah Educational Programs|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Salafist scholars, ''Kufr'' is the "denial of the Truth" (truth in the form of articles of faith in Islam), and ''shirk'' means devoting "acts of worship to anything beside God"&lt;ref name=QSEP/&gt; or "the worship of idols and other created beings".&lt;ref name=IQA/&gt; So a mushrik may worship other things while also "acknowledging God".&lt;ref name=IQA/&gt;

==In the Quran==

The distinction between those who believe in Islam and those who do not is an essential one in the Quran, the book of Islam. ''Kafir'', and its plural ''kuffaar'', is used directly 134 times in Quran, its verbal noun "''kufr''" is used 37 times, and the verbal cognates of ''kafir'' are used about 250 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campo |first1= Juan Eduardo |year=2009 |title=Encyclopedia of Islam |publisher=Infobase Publishing| ISBN=9781438126968| pages=420–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;pg=PA420&amp;dq=encyclopedia+of+islam+kafir&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAGoVChMI6sPd96-IxgIVj3ySCh031QCU#v=onepage&amp;q=encyclopedia%20of%20islam%20kafir&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension of the basic meaning of the root, "to cover", the term is used in the Quran in the senses of ignore/fail to acknowledge and to spurn/be ungrateful.&lt;ref name=EoQ-Belief&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Adang, Camilla | year= 2006 | title=Belief and Unbelief|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-the-quran/belief-and-unbelief-EQCOM_00025|publisher=Brill|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meaning of "disbelief", which has come to be regarded as primary, retains all of these connotations in the Quranic usage.&lt;ref name=EoQ-Belief/&gt; In the Quranic discourse, the term typifies all things that are unacceptable and offensive to the Islamic God.&lt;ref name=adams&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Charles Adams (rev. by A. Kevin Reinhart)|title=Kufr|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001/acref-9780195305135-e-0467|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Adams writes that the most fundamental sense of ''kufr'' in the Quran is "ingratitude", the willful refusal to acknowledge or appreciate the benefits that the Islamic God bestows on humankind, including clear signs and revealed scriptures.&lt;ref name=adams/&gt;

According to the ''E. J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1913–1936, Volume 4'', the term first applied in the Quran to unbelieving Meccans, who endeavoured "to refute and revile the Prophet". A waiting attitude towards the ''kafir'' was recommended at first for Muslims; later, Muslims were ordered to keep apart from unbelievers and defend themselves against their attacks and even take the offensive.&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619/&gt; Most passages in the Quran referring to unbelievers in general talk about their fate on the [[Islamic eschatology|day of judgement]] and destination in [[Jahannam|hell]].&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619/&gt;

According to scholar Marilyn Waldman, as the Quran "progresses" (as the reader goes from the verses revealed first to later ones), the meaning behind the term ''kafir'' does not change but  "progresses", i.e. "accumulates meaning over time".  As the [[Prophet Muhammad|Islamic Prophet Muhammad]]'s views of his opponents change, his use of ''kafir'' "undergoes a development". ''Kafir'' moves from being ''one'' description of Muhammad's opponents to the primary one. Later in the Quran, ''kafir'' becomes more and more connected with ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]''.  Finally, towards the end of the [[Quran]], ''kafir'' begins to also signify the group of people to be fought by the ''mu'minīn'' (believers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Waldman|first=Marilyn|title=The Development of the Concept of Kufr in the Qur'an|journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society|date=Jul–Sep 1968|volume=88|issue=3|pages=442–55|doi=10.2307/596869|jstor=596869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of unbelievers==

===People of the Book===
The status of the [[People of the Book]] (''ahl al-kitab''), particularly Jews and Christians, with respect to the Islamic notions of unbelief is not clearcut. Charles Adams writes that the Quran reproaches the People of the Book with ''kufr'' for rejecting Muhammad's message when they should have been the first to accept it as possessors of earlier revelations, and singles out Christians for disregarding the evidence of God's unity.&lt;ref name=adams/&gt; The Quranic verse 5:73 ("Certainly they disbelieve [''kafara''] who say: God is the third of three"), among other verses, has been traditionally understood in Islam as [[Islamic view of the Trinity|rejection of the Christian Trinity doctrine]],&lt;ref name=EoQ-Trinity&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Thomas, David | year= 2006 | title=Trinity|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of the Qurʾān|editor=Jane Dammen McAuliffe|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-the-quran/trinity-EQSIM_00428|publisher=Brill|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; though modern scholarship has suggested alternative interpretations.{{refn|group=note|That this verse criticizes a deviant form of Trinitarian belief which overstressed distinctiveness of the three persons at the expense of their unity. Modern scholars have also interpreted it as a reference to Jesus, who was often called "the third of three" in Syriac literature and as an intentional over-simplification of Christian doctrine intended to highlight its weakness from a strictly monotheistic perspective.&lt;ref name=EoQ-Trinity/&gt;}} Other Quranic verses strongly deny the [[Hypostatic union|deity of Jesus Christ]], son of Mary and reproach the people who treat Jesus as equal with God as disbelievers who will be doomed to eternal punishment in [[Hell]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Jojo, ''[http://theolibrary.shc.edu/resources/Quran-Gospel.pdf Qur’an-Gospel Convergence: The Qur’an’s Message To Christians]'', ''Journal of Dharma'', 1 (January–March 2010), pp. 55-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mazuz, Haggai (2012) [https://journal.fi/store/article/download/9525/6759 ''Christians in the Qurʾān: Some Insights Derived from the Classical Exegetic Approach''], Journal of Dharma 35, 1 (January–March 2010), 55-76&lt;/ref&gt; While the Quran does not recognize the attribute of Jesus as the Son of God or God himself, it respects Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God sent to children of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Schirrmacher, Christine, ''The Islamic view of Christians: Qur’an and Hadith'', http://www.worldevangelicals.org&lt;/ref&gt; Some Muslim thinkers such as [[Mohamed Talbi]] have viewed the most extreme Quranic presentations of the dogmas of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus (5:19, 5:75-76, 5:119) as non-Christian formulas that were rejected by the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Carré, Olivier|year=2003|title=Mysticism and Politics: A Critical Reading of Fī Ẓilāl Al-Qurʼān by Sayyid Quṭb|location=Boston|publisher=Brill|pages=63–64|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N85UaTV-0VoC&amp;pg=PA63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyril Glasse criticizes the use of ''kafirun'' [pl. of ''kafir''] to describe Christians as "loose usage".&lt;ref name=Glasse-2001-247/&gt; According to the ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]'', in traditional [[Fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], ''ahl al-kitab'' are "usually regarded more leniently than other ''kuffar'' [pl. of ''kafir'']..." and "in theory" a Muslim commits a punishable offense if he says to a Jew or a Christian: "Thou unbeliever".&lt;ref name=EI2&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Björkman, W. | year= 2012 | title=Kāfir |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P.

Historically, People of the Book permanently residing under Islamic rule were entitled to a special status known as ''[[dhimmi]]'', while those visiting Muslim lands received a different status known as ''[[musta'min]]''.&lt;ref name=EI2/&gt;

===''Mushrikun''===

''Mushrikun'' (pl. of ''mushrik'') are those who practice ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'', which literally means "association" and refers to accepting other gods and divinities alongside the god of the Muslims - Allah (as God's "associates").&lt;ref name=EI2-shirk&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Gimaret, D. | year= 2012 | title=S̲h̲irk |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam| edition=2nd|publisher=Brill |editors=P.

Heinrichs|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1163/1573-3912_islam_SIM_6965|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is often translated as polytheism.&lt;ref name=EI2-shirk/&gt; The Quran distinguishes between ''mushrikun'' and People of the Book, reserving the former term for idol worshipers, although some classical commentators considered Christian doctrine to be a form of ''shirk''.&lt;ref name=EI2-shirk/&gt; ''Shirk'' is held to be the worst form of disbelief, and it is identified in the Quran as the only sin that God cannot pardon (4:48, 4:116).&lt;ref name=EI2-shirk/&gt;

Accusations of ''shirk'' have been common in religious polemics within Islam.&lt;ref name=EI2-shirk/&gt; Thus, in the early Islamic debates on free will and [[theodicy]], Sunni theologians charged their [[Mu'tazila]] adversaries  with ''shirk'', accusing them of attributing to man creative powers comparable to those of God in both originating and executing his own actions.&lt;ref name=EI2-shirk/&gt; Mu'tazila theologians, in turn, charged the Sunnis with ''shirk'' on the grounds that under their doctrine a voluntary human act would result from an "association" between God, who creates the act, and the individual who appropriates it by carrying it out.&lt;ref name=EI2-shirk/&gt;

In classical jurisprudence, Islamic religious tolerance applied only to the People of the Book, while ''mushrikun'', based on the [[Sword Verse]], faced a choice between conversion to Islam and fight to the death,&lt;ref name=hallaq&gt;{{cite book|author=Wael B. Hallaq|authorlink = Wael Hallaq|title=Sharī'a: Theory, Practice, Transformations|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press (Kindle edition)|page=327 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which may be substituted by enslavement.&lt;ref name=lewis-1995-230&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=The Middle East, A Brief History of the Last 2000 Years|date=1995|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0684832801|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the designation of People of the Book and the ''dhimmi'' status was extended even to non-monotheistic religions of conquered peoples, such as Hinduism.&lt;ref name=hallaq/&gt; Following destruction of major Hindu temples during the [[Muslim conquests of the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquests in South Asia]], Hindus and Muslims on the subcontinent came to share a number of popular religious practices and beliefs, such as veneration of [[Wali|Sufi saints]] and worship at Hindu shrines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Lapidus | first = Ira M. | authorlink=Ira M.

===Sinners===
Whether a Muslim could commit a sin great enough to become a ''kafir'' was disputed by jurists in the early centuries of Islam. The most tolerant view (that of the ''Murdji'a'') was that even those who had committed a major sin (''kabira'') were still believers and "their fate was left to God".&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619/&gt; The most strict view (that of Kharidji Ibadis, descended from the [[Kharijites]]) was that every Muslim who dies having not repented of his sins was considered a ''kafir''. In between these two positions, the ''Mu'tazila'' believed that there was a status between believer and unbeliever called "rejected" or ''[[fasiq]]''.&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619/&gt;

===''Takfir''===
The [[Kharijites]] view that the self-proclaimed Muslim who had sinned and "failed to repent had ipso facto excluded himself from the community, and was hence a kafir" (a practice known as ''takfir'') was considered so extreme by the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] majority that they in turn declared the  [[Kharijites]] ''kafir'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruthven|first=Malise|title=The Eleventh of September and the Sudanese mahdiya in the Context of Ibn Khaldun's Theory of Islamic History|journal=International Affairs|date=April 2002|volume=78|issue=2|pages=344–45|doi=10.1111/1468-2346.00254}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2 December 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
following the hadith that declared, "If a Muslim charges a fellow Muslim with ''kufr'', he is himself a ''kafir'' if the accusation should prove untrue".&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619/&gt;

Nevertheless, in Islamic theological polemics ''kafir'' was "a frequent term for the Muslim protagonist" holding the opposite view, according to ''Brill's Islamic Encyclopedia''.&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Houtsma|editor1-first=M.

Another group that are "distinguished from the mass of kafirun"&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619/&gt; are the ''[[Apostasy in Islam|murtad]]'', or apostate ex-Muslims, who are considered renegades and traitors, the concept of [[freedom of religion]] not being accepted.&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619/&gt;  Their traditional punishment is death, even, according to some scholars, if they recant their abandonment of Islam.&lt;ref name=lewis-1995-230q&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=The Middle East, A Brief History of the Last 2000 Years|date=1995|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0684832801|page=230|quote=Tolerance may in no circumstances be extended to the apostate, the renegade Muslim, whose punishment is death.

According to the [[Salafi]] scholar [[Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali]], "''kufr'' is basically disbelief in any of the articles of faith. He also lists several different types of major disbelief, (disbelief so severe it excludes those who practice it completely from the fold of Islam):

# ''Kufr-at-Takdhib'': disbelief in divine truth or the denial of any of the articles of Faith (quran 39:32)&lt;ref name=q-trans/&gt;

===In proper sense===
{{further|Islam and other religions}}

When the Islamic empire expanded, the word "''kafir''" was used broadly for all [[pagan]]s and anyone who disbelieved in Islam.&lt;ref name=HMP/&gt;&lt;ref name=HoI/&gt;
Historically, the attitude toward unbelievers in Islam was determined more by socio-political conditions than by religious doctrine.&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619/&gt; A tolerance toward unbelievers "impossible to imagine in contemporary Christendom" prevailed even to the time of the [[Crusades]], particularly with respect to the People of the Book.&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619/&gt; However, animosity was nourished by repeated wars with unbelievers, and warfare between [[Safavid]] Persia and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turkey]] brought about application of the term ''kafir'' even to Persians in Turkish [[fatwa]]s.&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619/&gt; During the era of European colonialism, the political decline of Islam impeded organized state action against the pressure from Western nations, and the resulting feeling of impotence contributed to a rise of hatred against unbelievers and its periodic manifestations, such as massacres.&lt;ref name=EJBFEI-619/&gt;

However, there was extensive [[religious violence in India]] between Muslims and non-Muslims during the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Mughal Empire]] (before the political decline of Islam).&lt;ref name=mgat&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gaborieau |first=Marc |date=June 1985 |title=From Al-Beruni to Jinnah: Idiom, Ritual and Ideology of the Hindu-Muslim Confrontation in South Asia |journal=Anthropology Today |publisher=Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=7–14 |doi=10.2307/3033123 |jstor=3033123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holt et al., The Cambridge History of Islam - The Indian sub-continent, south-east Asia, Africa and the Muslim west, {{ISBN|978-0521291378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott Levi (2002), Hindu beyond Hindu Kush: Indians in Central Asian Slave Trade, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, Vol 12, Part 3, pp. 281–83&lt;/ref&gt;

Raziuddin Aquil states that "non-Muslims were often condemned as ''kafirs'', in medieval Indian Islamic literature, including court chronicles, Sufi texts and literary compositions" and fatwas were issued that justified persecution of the non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Raziuddin Aquil (2008), On Islam and Kufr in the Delhi Sultanate, in Rethinking a Millennium: Perspectives on Indian History (Editor: Rajat Datta), {{ISBN|978-8189833367}}, Chapter 7, pp. 168–85&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between [[Judaism|Jews]] and Muslims in the Arab world and use of the word "kafir" were equally as complex, and over the last century, issues regarding "kafir" have arisen over the conflict in [[Israel]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="Taji-Farouki2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Taji-Farouki |first=Suha |date=October 2000 |title=Islamists and the Threat of Jihad: Hizb al-Tahrir and al-Muhajiroun on Israel and the Jews|journal=Middle Eastern Studies |volume=36 |issue=4 |page=26 |doi=10.1080/00263200008701330 |jstor=4284112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calling the Jews of Israel, "the usurping kafir", [[Yasser Arafat]] turned on the Muslim resistance and "allegedly set a precedent for preventing Muslims from mobilizing against 'aggressor disbelievers' in other Muslim lands, and enabled 'the cowardly, alien kafir' to achieve new levels of intervention in Muslim affairs."&lt;ref name="Taji-Farouki2000" /&gt;

==== Muhammad's parents ====

A hadith in which Muhammad states that his father was in hell has become a source of disagreement about the status of Muhammad's parents. Over the centuries, Sunni scholars have dismissed this hadith despite its appearance in the authoritative ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'' collection. It passed through a single chain of transmission for three generations, so that its authenticity was not considered certain enough to supersede a theological consensus which stated that people who died before a prophetic message reached them—as Muhammad's father had done—could not be held accountable for not embracing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Jonathan A.C. |last=Brown| authorlink = Jonathan A.C.

By the 15th century, the word Kaffir was used by Muslims in Africa to refer to the non-Muslim African natives. Many of those ''kufari'' were [[Slavery|enslaved]] and sold by their Muslims captors to European and Asian merchants, mainly from Portugal, who by that time had established trading outposts along the coast of West Africa. These European traders adopted that Arabic word and its derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Campo|first=Juan Eduardo|title=Encyclopedia of Islam|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=0-8160-5454-1 |page=422|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OZbyz_Hr-eIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
Khat goes by various traditional names, such as ''kat'', ''qat'', ''qaad'', ''ghat'', ''chat'', ''Abyssinian Tea'', ''Somali Tea'', ''Miraa'', ''Arabian Tea'', and ''Kafta'' in its endemic regions of the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Tooea"/&gt;&lt;ref name=AlZarouni&gt;{{cite book|last=Al Zarouni|first=Yousif|title=The Effects of Khat (Catha Edulis)|year=2015|publisher=Yousif Al Zarouni|location=London|isbn=978-1-326-24867-3|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|4–5}}&lt;ref name="Adfkf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Khat facts |url=http://www.druginfo.adf.org.au/drug-facts/khat |publisher=ADF |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[African Great Lakes region]], where ''Catha edulis'' is in some areas cultivated, it is known as ''miraa'', ''muhulo'' and ''muirungi''.&lt;ref name="GRIN"&gt;{{GRIN | accessdate = 10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rätsch|first=Christian|title=The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and Its Applications|year=2004|publisher=Park Street Press, U.S.|isbn=978-0892819782}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, the plant is known as ''Bushman's Tea''.&lt;ref name="dwaf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.dwaf.gov.za/dwaf/cmsdocs/4116___poster%20protected%20trees.pdf |title=Protected Trees |date=3 May 2013 |publisher=Department of Water Affairs and Forestry, Republic of South Africa |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705085122/http://www2.dwaf.gov.za/dwaf/cmsdocs/4116___poster%20protected%20trees.pdf |archivedate= 5 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other names for khat include ''Chat Tree'' and ''Flower of Paradise''.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Description==
Khat is a slow-growing [[shrub]] or tree that typically attains a height of {{convert|1-5|m|abbr=on}}. However, it can reach heights of up to {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} in equatorial areas. The plant usually grows in [[Desert climate|arid]] environments, at a temperature range of {{convert|5|-|35|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="Pfgce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Growing Catha edulis |url=http://www.plot55.com/growing/c.edulis.html |publisher=Plot55 |accessdate=26 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130826115643/http://www.plot55.com/growing/c.edulis.html |archivedate=26 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has [[evergreen]] [[Leaf|leaves]], which are {{convert|5–10|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} long and {{convert|1-4|cm|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} broad. The shrub's flowers are produced on short axillary [[Cyme (botany)#Determinate or Cymose|cymes]] that are {{convert|4-8|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Each flower is small, with five white petals. The [[Samara (fruit)|samara]] fruit is an oblong, three-valved capsule, which contains one to three seeds.

==Cultivation and uses==
[[File:Khat fields in western yemen.jpg|thumb|Khat cultivation in western Yemen near [[At Tawilah]]]]
[[File:Qat tree,yemen.jpg|thumb|Qat tree, Yemen]]
[[File:Yemeni eating qat.jpg|thumb|Yemeni eating qat]]
The khat plant is known by a variety of names, such as ''qat'' and ''gat'' in Yemen, ''qaat'' and ''jaad'' in [[Somalia]], and ''chat'' in [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name="Kciy" /&gt; It is also known as ''jimaa'' in the [[Oromo language|Oromo]] language and mayirungi in  [[Luganda]] Language. Khat has been grown for use as a stimulant for centuries in the Horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. There, chewing khat predates the use of coffee and is used in a similar social context. In Uganda it is grown in the central region, Kasenge Nakawuka Road, Nkugulutale, Nisozi, Nsaggu and some parts of the western region of the country .&lt;ref name="Kciy"/&gt; In Kenya it is grown in Meru County.
 
Although the practice of khat-chewing is still primarily restricted to its original area of cultivation in the [[Red Sea]] area,&lt;ref name="Kciy"/&gt; the khat plant has over the years found its way to [[Southern Africa]] as well as tropical areas, where it grows on rocky outcrops and in woodlands. The shrub is today scattered in the [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[Eastern Cape]], [[Western Cape]] and [[Mpumalanga]] provinces of [[South Africa]], in addition to [[Swaziland]] and [[Mozambique]].&lt;ref name="Pzce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Catha edulis |url=http://www.plantzafrica.com/plantcd/cathedulis.htm |publisher=Plantzafrica |accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its fresh leaves and tops are chewed or, less frequently, dried and consumed as tea, to achieve a state of euphoria and stimulation; it also has [[anorectic]] (appetite-reducing) side effects. The leaves or the soft part of the stem can be chewed with either chewing gum or fried peanuts to make it easier to chew. In recent years, however, improved roads, off-road motor vehicles, and air transportation have increased the global distribution of this perishable commodity, and as a result, the plant has been reported in England, Wales, Rome, [[Amsterdam]], Canada, Israel, Australia, New Zealand,&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10415187"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10415187 |title=Concerns over African methamphetamine-like drug in Hamilton |first=O'Rourke |last=Simon |date=13 December 2006 |newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States. In the United-States, freshly packed khat leaves are sold on the markets of New York, Los Angeles, Boston, and Dallas, where the demand is most high.&lt;ref&gt;Zecharia Madar, "The Khat Phenomenon in Yemen and the Dangers it Poses", in: ''Ascending the Palm Tree – An Anthology of the Yemenite Jewish Heritage'', Rachel Yedid &amp; Danny Bar-Maoz (ed.), E'ele BeTamar: Rehovot 2018, p. 144 {{OCLC|1041776317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, khat is used as a socialising drug as in Yemen where khat-chewing is predominantly a male habit.&lt;ref name="Sanaa"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/6530453.stm |title=Yemen's khat habit soaks up water |first=Alex |last=Kirby |newspaper=BBC News |date=7 April 2007 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Deakhat.jpg|thumb|right|Bundles of khat, seized by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] in July 2006]]

Khat is so popular in Yemen that its cultivation consumes much of the country's agricultural resources. An estimated 40% of the country's water supply goes towards irrigating it,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/story/752130/yemen-legal-high-is-fueling-extremism |title=Sky News report on Yemen's Qat |first=Tim |last=Marshall |newspaper=[[Sky News]] |date=15 January 2010 |access-date=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with production increasing by about 10% to 15% every year. One "daily bag" of khat requires an estimated {{convert|500|L|gal}} of water to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/04/11/110411fa_fact_filkins?currentPage=all |title=After the Uprising |first=Dexter |last=Filkins |newspaper=[[The New Yorker]] |date=11 April 2011 |accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water consumption is high and [[groundwater]] levels in the Sanaa basin are diminishing, so government officials have proposed relocating large portions of the population of [[Sana'a]] to the coast of the [[Red Sea]].&lt;ref name="Sanaa" /&gt;

One reason for khat being cultivated in Yemen so widely is the high income it provides for farmers. Some studies done in 2001 estimated that the income from cultivating khat was about 2.5&amp;nbsp;million [[Yemeni rial]]s per hectare, while fruits brought only 0.57&amp;nbsp;million rials per hectare. Between 1970 and 2000, the area on which khat was cultivated was estimated to have grown from 8,000 to 103,000 hectares.&lt;ref name="encyemen"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Yemen |edition=2nd |publisher=Alafif Cultural Foundation |pages=2309–2314 |year=2003 |language=Arabic}}{{full citation needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;!-- Title of entry, original/transliterated titles of the book, and ISBN, please. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, according to a [[World Bank]] estimate, khat accounted for 30% of Yemen’s economy.&lt;ref name="ec" /&gt;

In other countries, outside of its core area of growth and consumption, khat is sometimes chewed at parties or social functions. It may also be used by farmers and labourers for reducing physical fatigue or hunger, and by drivers and students for improving attention.

It takes seven to eight years for the khat plant to reach its full height. Other than access to sun and water, khat requires little maintenance. Ground water is often pumped from deep wells by diesel engines to irrigate the crops, or brought in by water trucks. The plants are watered heavily starting around a month before they are harvested to make the leaves and stems soft and moist. A good khat plant can be harvested four times a year, providing a year-long source of income for the farmer.

Khat consumption induces mild [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]] and excitement, similar to that conferred by strong coffee.&lt;ref name="Kciy" /&gt;   Individuals become very talkative under the influence of the plant. The effects of oral administration of cathinone occur more rapidly than the effects of amphetamine pills; roughly 15 minutes as compared to 30 minutes in amphetamine.{{medcn|date=May 2018}} Khat can induce [[mania|manic]] behaviours and [[hyperactivity]], similar in effects to those produced by amphetamine.&lt;ref name="Kalix"&gt;{{citation|last=Peter |first=Kalix |chapter=The Pharmacology of Khat and of the Khat Alkaloid Cathinone |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Randrianame |editor2-first=K. |editor2-last=Szendrei |editor3-first=A. |editor3-last=Tongue |title=The Health and Socioeconomic Aspects of Khat Use |year=1983 |location=Lausanne, Switzerland |publisher=Intl. Council on Drug and Addictions |pages=140–143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--can't tell what format this is supposed to be (conference or book) so used {{Citation}}--&gt;

The use of khat results in [[constipation]]. [[Pupillary response|Dilated pupil]]s ([[mydriasis]]) are prominent during khat consumption, reflecting the [[sympathomimetic]] effects of the drug, which are also reflected in increased heart rate and blood pressure.  Long-term use can precipitate permanent [[tooth]] darkening (of a greenish tinge), susceptibility to [[peptic ulcer|ulcer]]s, and diminished [[Libido|sex drive]].

Khat is an effective [[anorectic]], causing loss of appetite.{{medcn|date=May 2018}}

It is unclear if the consumption of khat directly affects the mental health of the user or not.&lt;ref name="drugs"/&gt; Occasionally, a psychotic episode can result, resembling a [[hypomanic]] state in presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Giannini |first1=A.J. |last2=Castellani |first2=S. |title=A manic-like psychosis due to khat (Catha edulis Forsk.) |journal=Journal of Toxicology.

==Chemistry and pharmacology==
[[Image:S-Cathinone.svg|thumb|right|Cathinone structure]]
The stimulant effect of the plant was originally attributed to "katin", [[cathine]], a [[phenethylamine]]-type substance isolated from the plant. However, the attribution was disputed by reports showing the plant extracts from fresh leaves contained another substance more behaviourally active than cathine. In 1975, the related alkaloid [[cathinone]] was isolated, and its [[absolute configuration]] was established in 1978. Cathinone is not very stable and breaks down to produce cathine and [[norephedrine]]. These chemicals belong to the [[phenylpropanolamine|PPA (phenylpropanolamine)]] family, a subset of the [[Substituted phenethylamine|phenethylamines]] related to [[amfetamine|amphetamines]] and the [[catecholamine]]s [[epinephrine]] and [[norepinephrine]].&lt;ref name="drugs"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.drugs.com/npp/khat.html |title=Complete Khat Info |author=Drugs.com |date=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, cathinone and cathine have a very similar molecular structure to amphetamine.&lt;ref name="cox2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1192/apt.9.6.456 |title=Adverse effects of khat: a review |year=2003 |last1=Cox |first1=G. |journal=Advances in Psychiatric Treatment |volume=9 |issue=6 |pages=456–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Khat is sometimes confused with [[methcathinone]] (also known as ''cat''), a [[Convention_on_Psychotropic_Substances#Schedules_of_Controlled_Substances|Schedule I]] substance that possesses a similar chemical structure to the khat plant's cathinone active component. However, both the side effects and the addictive properties of methcathinone are much stronger than those associated with khat use.&lt;ref name="Dfk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugfree.org/drug-guide/khat |title=DF - Khat |website=Drugfree.org |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When khat leaves dry, the more potent chemical, cathinone, decomposes within 48 hours, leaving behind the milder chemical, cathine. Thus, harvesters transport khat by packaging the fresh leaves and stems in plastic bags or wrapping them in banana leaves to preserve their moisture and keep the cathinone potent. It is also common for them to sprinkle the plant with water frequently or use refrigeration during transportation.

When the khat leaves are chewed, cathine and cathinone are released and absorbed through the mucous membranes of the mouth as well as the lining of the stomach. The action of cathine and cathinone on the [[reuptake]] of [[epinephrine]] and norepinephrine has been demonstrated in lab animals, showing that one or both of these chemicals cause(s) the body to recycle these neurotransmitters more slowly, resulting in the wakefulness and insomnia associated with khat use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Ahmed |first1=M.B. |last2=El-Qirbi |first2=A.B. |title=Biochemical effects of Catha edulis, cathine and cathinone on adrenocortical functions |journal=J Ethnopharmacol |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=213–6 |date=August 1993 |pmid=7903110 |doi=10.1016/0378-8741(93)90039-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Receptors for [[serotonin]] show a high affinity for cathinone, suggesting this chemical is responsible for feelings of euphoria associated with chewing khat. In mice, cathinone produces the same types of nervous pacing or repetitive scratching behaviours associated with amphetamines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970615054349/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=15 June 1997 |title=Behavioral Effects of Cathinone |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of cathinone peak after 15 to 30 minutes, with nearly 98% of the substance metabolised into norephedrine by the liver.&lt;ref name="cox2003" /&gt;

Cathine is somewhat less understood, being believed to act upon the [[adrenergic receptors]] causing the release of epinephrine and norepinephrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Adeoya-Osiguwa |first1=S.A. |last2=Fraser |first2=L.R. |title=Cathine, an amphetamine-related compound, acts on mammalian spermatozoa via beta1- and alpha2A-adrenergic receptors in a capacitation state-dependent manner |journal=Hum.

According to some sources, khat was first grown in Ethiopia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chevalier |first=A. |title=Les Cat's d'Arabie, d'Abyssinie et d'Afrique orientale |journal=Revue de Botanique Appliquée |year=1949 |volume=29 |page=413}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the explorer [[Richard Francis Burton|Sir Richard Burton]] suggesting the plant was later introduced to [[Yemen]] from Ethiopia in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Richard |last=Burton |authorlink=Richard Francis Burton |title=First Footsteps in East Africa |year=1856 |isbn=978-1-4191-1982-8}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He specifically mentions the eastern city of [[Harar]] as the birthplace of the plant.&lt;ref name="LANGUAGE RELATIONSHIPS: FAMILIES, GRAFTS, PRISONS"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libermn |first=Mark |title=LANGUAGE RELATIONSHIPS: FAMILIES, GRAFTS, PRISONS |journal=Basic Reference |volume=28 |issue= |pages=217–229 |year=2003 |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/000217.html |access-date=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, amongst communities in the [[Horn of Africa]] ([[Djibouti]], Ethiopia, [[Somalia]]) and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], khat-chewing has a long history as a social custom dating back thousands of years.&lt;ref name="Kciy" /&gt;

[[Ancient Egypt]]ian imperial cults considered the khat plant a sacred substance, which was capable of realizing a user's [[Deity|divinity]]. These early Egyptians consumed the plant ceremoniously in attempts to transcend into "[[apotheosis]]" and or garner and manifest [[mysticism|mystical experiences]], [[trance|systemic trances]], and other [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] experiences rather than habitual recreational use or abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Giannini |first1=A.J. |last2=Burge |first2=H. |last3=Shaheen |first3=J.M. |last4=Price |first4=W.A. |title=Khat: another drug of abuse? |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=155–8 |year=1986 |pmid=3734955|doi=10.1080/02791072.1986.10471395|doi-broken-date=2018-08-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sufism|Sufis]] also used it to intensify their [[Mysticism#Mystical experience and union with the Divine|mystical experience]] and to facilitate a sense of union with God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idosi.org/wjms/7%284%2912/2.pdf The Green Leaf: Khat] ''World Journal of Medical Sciences' 7 (4): 210-223, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://oceanindien.revues.org/851 Khat in the Western Indian Ocean - Regional Linkages and Disjunctures] Neil Carrier et Lisa Gezon, 42-43 | 2009 : Plantes et Sociétés, p. 271-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known documented description of khat is found in the ''Kitab al-Saidala fi al-Tibb'' {{lang|ar|كتاب الصيدلة في الطب}}, an 11th-century work on [[pharmacy]] and [[materia medica]] written by [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī]], a [[Islamic science|Persian scientist]] and [[Islamic medicine|biologist]]. Unaware of its origins, al-Bīrūnī wrote that khat is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Kenneth F. |last1=Kiple |first2=Kriemhild Coneè |last2=Ornelas |year=2001 |title=The Cambridge World History of Food |pages=672–3 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0-521-40216-3 |oclc=174647831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[A] commodity from [[Turkestan]]. It is sour to taste and slenderly made in the manner of ''batan-alu''. But ''khat'' is reddish with a slight blackish tinge. It is believed that ''batan-alu'' is red, coolant, relieves biliousness, and is a refrigerant for the stomach and the liver.}}

In 1854, [[Malaysia|Malay]] author [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir]] noted that the custom of chewing khat was prevalent in [[Al Hudaydah]] in Yemen:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/713672763 |title=Munshi Abdullah's voyage to Mecca: A preliminary introduction and annotated translation |year=2000 |last1=Ché-Ross |first1=Raimy |journal=Indonesia and the Malay World |volume=28 |issue=81 |pages=173–213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|You observed a new peculiarity in this city&amp;nbsp;– everyone chewed leaves as goats chew the [[cud]]. There is a type of leaf, rather wide and about two fingers in length, which is widely sold, as people would consume these leaves just as they are; unlike [[betel]] leaves, which need certain condiments to go with them, these leaves were just stuffed fully into the mouth and munched. Thus when people gathered around, the remnants from these leaves would pile up in front of them. When they spat, their [[saliva]] was green. I then queried them on this matter: ‘What benefits are there to be gained from eating these leaves?’ To which they replied, ‘None whatsoever, it’s just another expense for us as we’ve grown accustomed to it’. Those who consume these leaves have to eat lots of [[ghee]] and [[honey]], for they would fall ill otherwise. The leaves are known as ''Kad''."}}

In 1856, English writer [[Charles Dickens]] also described the custom of khat chewing in the Horn region and the adjacent Gulf territories, likening it to drinking strong [[green tea]]:&lt;ref name="Tooea"/&gt;

{{quote|And one may sleep well if, during the day, too much kat has not been chewed. The leaves of the drug called kat are the chief source of pleasurable excitement in these districts of East Africa. Botanists, taking the native name for the plant, turn it into Catha edulis, eatable kat. It is much used by the Arabs, to whom it is sent in camel loads, consisting of a number of small parcels, each containing about forty slender twigs, with the leaves attached, carefully, wrapped so as to avoid exposure to the air. These leaves are chewed, and act upon the spirits of those using them, much as a strong dose of green tea acts upon us in Europe, when it acts agreeably. Europeans used to stronger stimulants, are little affected by the use of kat, but among the more temperate Arabs it is so welcome a provocative to good humour, that about two hundred and eighty camel-loads of it are used every year in Aden only.}}

[[File:HarariMen.jpg|thumb|[[Harari people|Harari]] men consuming khat in the street of [[Harar]], [[Ethiopia]]]]
Nowadays khat consumption is limited to [[East Africa]] and South Western [[Arabia]]. These countries include [[Djibouti]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Somalia]] (includes [[Somaliland]]), [[Uganda]], and [[Yemen]]. The author Yousif Al Zarouni writes in his book:&lt;ref name=AlZarouni /&gt;{{rp|4}}

{{quote|The plant is native to the [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the [[Horn of Africa]], despite its native grounds it is only legal in one of the several countries of the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Yemen]].

The plant is mostly used by East Africans and South West Arabians, rarely by people from other places.}}

Following a ban on khat in the British-governed [[Aden Protectorate]], the [[Qāt Commission of Inquiry in Aden]] concluded: "Qāt does not create an addiction, like opium or hashish, in that those who are suddenly deprived of it, do not suffer physical consequences."&lt;ref name="HehmeyerSchönig2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ingrid Hehmeyer|author2=Hannelore Schönig|author3=Hanne Schönig|title=Herbal Medicine in Yemen: Traditional Knowledge and Practice, and Their Value for Today's World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gm-bCFRcMHoC&amp;pg=PA92|date=27 August 2012|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-22150-5|pages=92–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
In 1965, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) Expert Committee on Dependence-producing Drugs' ''Fourteenth Report'' noted, "The Committee was pleased to note the resolution of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] with respect to khat, confirming the view that the abuse of this substance is a regional problem and may best be controlled at that level."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/bulletin/bulletin_1965-01-01_4_page007.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030830160515/http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/bulletin/bulletin_1965-01-01_4_page007.html |archivedate=30 August 2003 |title=World Health Organization Expert Committee on Dependence-producing Drugs: Fourteenth Report |publisher=United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, khat was not scheduled under the [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]]. In 1980, the WHO classified the plant as a [[drug of abuse]] that can produce mild to moderate [[Substance dependence|psychological dependence]] (less than tobacco or alcohol),&lt;ref name="King" /&gt; although the WHO does not consider khat to be seriously addictive.&lt;ref name="Kciy" /&gt; It is a controlled or illegal substance in some countries, but is legal for sale and production in others.&lt;ref&gt;''see'' Law Library of Congress (May 2015) [https://www.loc.gov/law/help/legal-status-of-khat/legal-status-khat.pdf ''Legal status of khat in selected jurisdictions'']&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Culture of Yemen}}
Khat is legal in Yemen.&lt;ref name="Hafmc" /&gt; However, cultivation of the crop and the selling of its leaves are governed by a series of regulations. In 2007, the Yemeni government passed a law that restricted the cultivation of khat in a number of agricultural flatlands and basins with high water stress. The Law Concerning the General Sales Tax in 2005 also set the tax rate on khat at 20% of its [[Suggested retail price|retail price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gatter |first=Peer |year=2012 |title=Politics of Qat - The Role of a Drug in Ruling Yemen |publisher=Ludwig Reichert Verlag, Wiesbaden |isbn=978-3-89500-910-5 |pages=260, 335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A questionnaire with 848 respondents was used. The responses indicated that 48% of Somali males and 16% of females used the narcotic on a monthly basis and that 29% of males and 6% of females used it two times or more a week.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.sst.dk/da/udgivelser/2009/~/media/06B82985E17B41C4B8605D870153F8FC.ashx|title=Brug af khat blandt dansk-somaliere - undersøgelse af omfang og holdninger|last=|first=|publisher=[[Danish Health Authority]]|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=1–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Half the respondents had never used khat.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The responses indicated that Somalis constituted the great majority of users in Denmark.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In total 2 out of 3 state that khat is a problem for [[social integration]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; into Danish society, while 1 of 3 users state this.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Responses indicated that 2 out of 3 considered khat to be part of Somali culture, although 2 out of 3 stated that they agree that khat should be banned in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

====Finland====
Khat is classified as an illegal drug in Finland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Khat+use+on+the+increase+in+Finland/1135233645151 |title=Khat use on the increase in Finland |publisher=HELSINGIN SANOMAT |accessdate=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and possession, use and sale of the substance is prohibited and punishable. As with all illegal drugs, operating a motor vehicle with detectable levels of Khat or its metabolites in one's system can also lead to a conviction for [[driving under the influence]], even if the driver does not appear intoxicated.

====France====
Khat is prohibited in France as a stimulant.&lt;ref name="drugs"/&gt;

====Germany====
In Germany, cathinone is listed as a "non-trafficable substance", which makes the possession, sale and purchase of fresh khat illegal. The derivative cathine is only available on prescription, while norephedrine is not listed.

====Iceland====
In August 2010 the Icelandic police intercepted khat smuggling for the first time. 37&amp;nbsp;kg were confiscated. The drugs were most likely intended for sale in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/innlent/2010/08/18/hald_lagt_a_fikniefnid_khat_i_fyrsta_sinn/ |title=Hald lagt á fíkniefnið Khat í fyrsta sinn |date=2010-08-19 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again in May 2011 the police intercepted around 60&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mbl.is/frettir/innlent/2011/05/18/60_kilo_af_fikniefnum/ |title=60 kíló af fíkniefnum |date=2011-05-18 |language=Icelandic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study concluded that most of the participants who were using khat were using it moderately in terms of both the quantity used and the frequency and duration of chewing sessions, and that khat use was typically a social activity. Only a small minority of the study participants' khat use was judged to be excessive.&lt;ref name="Home Office khat study"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/rdsolr4705.pdf|title=Khat use among Somalis in four English cities|first1=Shilpa L.|last1=Patel|first2=Sam|last2=Wright|first3=Alex|last3=Gammampila|publisher=[[Home Office]]|work=Online Report 47/05|year=2005|accessdate=7 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705045707/http://rds.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/rdsolr4705.pdf|archivedate=5 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a careful review of the evidence, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs recommended in January 2006 that the status of khat as a legal substance should remain for the time being.&lt;ref name=Klein/&gt;

In 2008,  [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician [[Sayeeda Warsi]] stated that a future Conservative government would ban khat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/jun/15/drugspolicy.somalia |title=Conservatives will ban khat |first=Sayeeda |last=Warsi |work=Comment is free |publisher=The Guardian |date=15 June 2008 |accessdate=21 August 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website of the Conservative Party, which in 2010 became the larger party in a [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|UK coalition government]], previously stated that a Conservative government would "Tackle unacceptable cultural practices by", amongst other measures, "classifying Khat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conservatives.com/Policy/Where_we_stand/Community_Relations.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930064304/http://www.conservatives.com/Policy/Where_we_stand/Community_Relations.aspx |archivedate=30 September 2008 |title=Where we stand: Community relations |publisher=Conservative Party |website=Conservatives.com |accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Home Office commissioned two new studies in the effects of khat use and in June 2010, a Home Office spokesperson stated: "The Government is committed to addressing any form of substance misuse and will keep the issue of khat use under close scrutiny".&lt;ref name="Sky"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News/The-Legal-Drug-Khat-Is-Causing-Social-Problems-Among-The-East-African-Community-In-The-UK/Article/201006315650862?lpos=UK_News_Top_Stories_Header_2&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15650862_The_Legal_Drug_Khat_Is_Causing_Social_Problems_Among_The_East_African_Community_In_The_UK |title=Call for new controls on legal drug khat |newspaper=Sky News |date=19 June 2010 |accessdate=2 May 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603192103/http://news.sky.com/story/786736/call-for-new-controls-on-legal-drug-khat |archivedate= June 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a parliamentary debate on the legality issue on 11 January 2012, [[Mark Lancaster]], the Conservative Member of Parliament for Milton Keynes, stated that the importation of Khat into the UK stands at 10 tonnes every week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201212/cmhansrd/cm120111/debtext/120111-0004.htm#12011187000608 |title=Hansard 11 Jan 2012 |publisher=Hansard |date=11 January 2012 |accessdate=12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January 2013, the [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] (ACMD) said there was "insufficient evidence" that khat caused health problems. The ACMD said there was "no evidence" khat was directly linked with serious or organised crime, and was chewed to obtain a "mild stimulant effect much less potent than stimulant drugs, such as amphetamine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/144120/report-2013.pdf |title=Khat: A review of its potential harms to the individual and communities in the UK |publisher=Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs |date=23 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 July 2013, the [[British Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] announced that khat was to be banned in Britain, designating it a Class C substance under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/khat |title=Written statement to Parliament: Khat |publisher=HM Government |date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-23163017 |title=Herbal stimulant khat to be banned |newspaper=BBC News |date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alex Miller, a journalist from the Montreal, Canada-based magazine and television channel [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]], looked into the use of the substance and the potential impact of the ban for BBC nightly current affairs programme Newsnight&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25854577 |title=BBC News - Khat: What impact will UK herb stimulant ban have? |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for a Vice documentary.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JntqpqDTvjs |title=YouTube - Khat Power: The Latest War On Drugs |publisher=Youtube.com |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenyan MPs appealed to the UK not to "condemn people" by banning the herbal stimulant khat&lt;ref name="bbc3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-25120302|title=BBC News - Kenya appeals to UK not to ban khat|publisher=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the United Kingdom House of Commons' Home Affairs Select Committee announced that it would continue to lobby for the UK government not to go through with its intended ban on khat. The committee had shortly before also completed an inquiry and a report recommending that the British authorities refrain from banning the plant.&lt;ref name="Sultpflbomr"&gt;{{cite news|title=UK legislators to press for lifting ban on Miraa Read|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/thecounties/article/2000106268/uk-legislators-to-press-for-lifting-ban-on-miraa|accessdate=17 March 2014|newspaper=Standard Digital|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 May 2014, the House of Lords passed a Motion to Approve the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (Designation)(Amendment) (No. 2)(England, Wales and Scotland) Order 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1376/contents/made|title=The Misuse of Drugs (Designation) (Amendment) (No. 2) (England, Wales and Scotland) Order 2014|work=legislation.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to control ''Catha edulis'' as a Class C drug. An amendment was proposed stating that, "this House regrets that Her Majesty’s Government’s plans for the introduction of the Order do not include provisions for a 12-month review of the impact of the reclassification of khat in view of the highly unusual community focus of its use, for putting a detailed policing strategy in place before a ban takes effect, or for a health strategy to prevent a transfer of addiction to other substances; and do not commit the Department for International Development to do more work with the government of Kenya to alleviate the effect of the reclassification on the Kenyan economy."

In January 2015, the ''[[Bristol Post]]'' reported that most khat houses in the city had closed down, "forcing users to take the drug in their homes instead". The local police had initially not sought to enforce the ban, giving users a grace period, but according to the ''Bristol Post'' had recently started to take action against khat use and had issued three warnings and a [[Police caution|caution]]. Additionally, in September 2014 the police had seized 24 bags of dried khat from a property in [[Easton, Bristol|Easton]], but no arrests were made. Additionally, the Somali Resource Centre indicated that the ban seemed to have been effective, and that the prohibition had all but destroyed the import market since the plant has to be fresh in order to be consumed.&lt;ref name="Kibbdsh"&gt;{{cite news|title=Khat in Bristol: Banned drug's still here – it's just moved underground|url=http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Khat-Bristol-Banned-drug-s-ndash-s-just-moved/story-25815789-detail/story.html|accessdate=20 February 2015|work=Bristol Post|date=10 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220230137/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Khat-Bristol-Banned-drug-s-ndash-s-just-moved/story-25815789-detail/story.html|archivedate=20 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consultation with Somalis in [[Glasgow]] undertaken by the national voluntary organisation Fast Forward at the request of the Somali Association in Glasgow in October 2014 suggested that khat continues to be used in both fresh and dried forms by some Somalis in the city, and that the ban has also led some users to seek out other substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fastforward.org.uk/documents/Somali%20Community%20Consultation%20Report.pdf|title=Consultation on khat use within Glasgow's Somali community|publisher=Fast Forward|date=19 January 2015|accessdate=24 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624155833/http://www.fastforward.org.uk/documents/Somali%20Community%20Consultation%20Report.pdf|archive-date=24 June 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban has reportedly served to increase the price of khat in the UK. [[Channel 4 News]] reported in September 2014 that prior to the ban, 20 tonnes of khat arrived at [[Heathrow Airport]] daily, and it would sell for £3 per bundle. After the ban, it was reportedly selling at £30 per bundle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/news/khat-amphetamine-east-africa-outlawed-illegal-drug-video|title=Joining the police crack-down on banned drug khat|publisher=Channel 4 News|date=27 September 2014|accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
In Canada, khat is a controlled substance under Schedule IV of the [[Controlled Drugs and Substances Act]] (CDSA), meaning it is illegal to seek or obtain unless approved by a [[medical practitioner]]. Possession of khat for personal use is not an indictable offense in Canada. The maximum punishment for trafficking or possession with the intent of trafficking is ten years in prison.&lt;ref name="justice"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-38.8/bo-ga:s_1::bo-ga:s_2?page=2 |title=Controlled Drugs and Substances Act |publisher=Laws.justice.gc.ca |date=29 March 2010 |accessdate=4 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063752/http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/C-38.8/bo-ga%3As_1%3A%3Abo-ga%3As_2?page=2 |archivedate= 5 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Canadian authorities reported that khat is the most common illegal drug being smuggled at airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1216/p06s01-wogn.html |title=Gangs infiltrate Canada's airports |newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor |date=16 December 2008 |accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 2012 the [[Ontario Court of Appeal]] upheld a 2011 absolute discharge of a young woman who brought 34 kilograms of khat into Canada in 2009. According to the defence, the ruling recognises that there is no empirical evidence that khat is harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Powell |first=Betsy |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2012/04/20/woman_who_brought_khat_to_canada_wins_appeal.html |title=Woman who brought khat to Canada wins appeal |newspaper=The Star |date=20 April 2012 |accessdate=26 January 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109034700/http://www.thestar.com/news/crime/2012/04/20/woman_who_brought_khat_to_canada_wins_appeal.html |archivedate=9 January 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--former URL:url=https://www.thestar.com/news/crime/article/1165236--woman-who-brought-khat-to-canada-wins-appeal--&gt; The courts in Quebec and Ontario continued to discharge the accused for bringing khat into Canada for the same reason (no evidence of harmfulness of khat) in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[CanLII]]|url=https://www.canlii.org/en/qc/qccq/doc/2014/2014qccq671/2014qccq671.html|title=R. c.

====United States====
In the United States, cathinone is a Schedule I drug, according to the US [[Controlled Substance Act]]. The 1993 [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] rule placing cathinone in Schedule I noted that it was effectively also banning khat:

{{quote|"Cathinone is the major psychoactive component of the plant ''Catha edulis'' (khat). The young leaves of khat are chewed for a stimulant effect. Enactment of this rule results in the placement of any material that contains cathinone into Schedule I."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/khat/khat_law1.shtml |title=Erowid Khat Vault : Law : Federal Register vol 58, no 9 |publisher=Erowid.org |date= |accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Catha edulis'' (khat) is a stimulant narcotic that is similar to that of amphetamine and its [[Congener (chemistry)|congeners]], not a drug as categorised by US FDA (United States Food &amp; Drug Administration) and FDA import Alert #66-23 (published date 03/18/2011) states that "Districts may detain, without physical examination, all entries of khat",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/cms_ia/importalert_180.html |title=Import Alert 66-23 |publisher=Food and Drug Administration |date=2011-03-18 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on section 801(a) (3) of the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] on the grounds that "its labeling fails to bear adequate directions for use."

As federal and local khat raids have often targeted immigrants from countries where khat is legal, issues of cultural misunderstanding have sometimes been raised.&lt;ref&gt;Verhovek, Sam Howe (2006). [http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/22/nation/na-khat22  ''DEA's Khat Sting Stirs Up Somali "Cultural Clash"'']. Los Angeles Times. August 22, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant itself is specifically banned in Missouri:
{{quote|"Khat, to include all parts of the plant presently classified botanically as catha edulis, whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; any extract from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seed or extracts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/mostatutes/stathtml/19500000172.html |title=Section 195-017 Substances, how placed in schedules-li |publisher=Moga.mo.gov |date=28 August 2009 |accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In California, both the plant itself as well as cathinone, its active component, are illegal.&lt;ref name="Group2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=LawTech Publishing Group|title=2016 California Penal Code Unabridged|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UIOSCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT3940|year=2016|publisher=LawTech Publishing Group|location=San Clemente|isbn=978-1-889315-22-5|pages=3940–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===

====Australia====
In Australia, the importation of khat is controlled under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. It is illegal to import khat into Australia for personal use. Khat can only be imported for medical or scientific use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|reg|cir1956432|Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956}} Reuglation 5 and Schedule 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Importing khat without a permit is subject to fines or prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://adf.org.au/drug-facts/khat/|title=ADF - Drug Facts - Khat|work=ADF - Alcohol &amp; Drug Foundation|access-date=2017-10-03|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the total number of khat annual permits was 294 and the total number of individual khat permits was 202 however as of 1 December 2013, permits for the use of khat by individuals for recreational/cultural purposes are no longer issued. There are currently no plans by the Australian Government to amend the regulations to allow the importation of khat for personal use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.odc.gov.au/import-restrictions-kava-and-khat|title=Import restrictions: Kava and Khat {{!}} Office of Drug Control|website=www.odc.gov.au|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khat is listed as a Schedule 2 dangerous drug in Queensland, in the same category as cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Qld|reg|dmr1987256/sch2.html|Drugs misuse Regulation 1987}} Schedule 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Legality in [[New South Wales]] is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.uq.edu.au/index.html?page=122977 |title=Associate Professor Heather Douglas, University of Queensland |publisher=Law.uq.edu.au |date=9 December 2009 |accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importation of Khat (Catha edulis) material (includes material that is fresh, dried, powdered, capsules or tablets) is prohibited under the Customs (Prohibited Import) Regulations 1956 unless the person importing the material is the holder of both a license to import and a permit to import granted by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA).

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, khat is listed as a Class C drug, in the same category as cannabis and [[codeine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1975/0116/latest/DLM436723.html |title=Misuse of Drugs Act 1975 No 116 | publisher=legislation.govt.nz |date=July 2014 |accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
In South America, there is no legislation regarding khat; the active ingredients in the plant can be found in several weight control compounds sold in the continent{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}.

==Research programs==
In 2009, the [[University of Minnesota]] launched the Khat Research Program (KRP), a multidisciplinary research and training program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease |url=http://www.med.umn.edu/duluth/NewsReleases/2009/alAbsiKhatUse/home.html |title=al'Absi Launches the Khat Research Program |publisher=Med.umn.edu |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208013854/http://www.med.umn.edu/duluth/NewsReleases/2009/alAbsiKhatUse/home.html |archivedate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the neurobehavioral and health effects of khat, led by Prof. Dr. [[Mustafa al'Absi]]. The program was funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] and the National Institute for Drug Abuse of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khatresearch.org |title=KRP |publisher=Khatresearch.org |date= |accessdate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural event for the KRP was held in [[Sharm El-Sheik]], [[Egypt]], in December, 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sona.ibro.info/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=4330 |title=KRP Symposium |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313155832/http://sona.ibro.info/Pub/Pub_Main_Display.asp?LC_Docs_ID=4330 |archivedate=13 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in collaboration with the [[International Brain Research Organization]] (IBRO) and its local affiliates.

A '''New Testament uncial''' is a section of the New Testament in [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Latin language|Latin]] [[majuscule]] letters, written on [[parchment]] or [[vellum]]. This style of writing is called ''Biblical Uncial'' or ''Biblical Majuscule''.

New Testament uncials are distinct from other ancient texts based on the following differences:
* [[List of New Testament papyri|New Testament papyri]]&amp;nbsp;– written on [[papyrus]] and generally more ancient
* [[List of New Testament minuscules|New Testament minuscules]]&amp;nbsp;– written in [[Minuscule cursive|minuscule]] letters and generally more recent
* [[List of New Testament lectionaries|New Testament lectionaries]]&amp;nbsp;– usually written minuscule (but some in uncial) letters and generally more recent
* New Testament uncials&amp;nbsp;– written in majuscule letters, on parchment or velum.

== Classification of uncials ==
In 1751, New Testament theologian [[Johann Jakob Wettstein]] knew of only 23 uncial [[codex|codices]] of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1859, [[Constantin von Tischendorf]] had increased that number to 64 uncials, and in 1909 [[Caspar René Gregory]] enumerated 161 uncial codices. By 1963, [[Kurt Aland]], in his ''Kurzgefasste Liste'', had enumerated 250, then in 1989, finally, 299 uncials.

Wettstein inaugurated the modern method of classification. He used capital Latin letters to identify the uncials. Codex Alexandrinus received the letter "A", Codex Vaticanus&amp;nbsp;– "B", Codex Ephraemi&amp;nbsp;– "C", Codex Bezae&amp;nbsp;– "D", until he arrived at the last letter used by him, "O". Succeeding generations used this pattern, but newly discovered manuscripts soon exhausted the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref name = Aland&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, letters of the Greek and Hebrew alphabets began to be used. Tischendorf, for example, assigned the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] the Hebrew letter &lt;big&gt;א&lt;/big&gt;. [[Uncial 047]] received [[siglum]] &lt;big&gt;ב&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Codex Vaticanus 2061|Uncial 048]] received &lt;big&gt;ב&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, [[Uncial 075]] received &lt;big&gt;ג&lt;/big&gt;, [[Codex Macedoniensis]]&amp;nbsp;– &lt;big&gt;ו&lt;/big&gt;, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;H.

C. Hinrichs'sche Buchhandlung|location=Leipzig|pages=172–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Greek and Hebrew letters ran out, Gregory assigned uncials numerals with an initial 0 (to distinguish them from the symbols of minuscule manuscripts). Codex Sinaiticus received the number 01, Alexandrinus&amp;nbsp;– 02, Vaticanus&amp;nbsp;– 03, Ephraemi&amp;nbsp;– 04, etc. The last uncial manuscript known by Gregory received number 0161.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.

{{as of|2012}} over 320 sigla for uncial codices have been catalogued by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institute for New Testament Textual Research (INTF)]] in Münster, Germany.&lt;ref name = INTF&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://intf.uni-muenster.de/vmr/NTVMR/ListeHandschriften.php|title=Liste Handschriften|publisher=Institute for New Testament Textual Research|accessdate=16 November 2010|location=Münster}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eberhard Nestle]], [[Erwin Nestle]], Barbara Aland and [[Kurt Aland]] (eds), ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'', 27th edition, (Stuttgart: ''[[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]]'', 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the 322 currently catalogued does not provide a precise count of all the New Testament Greek uncials. [[Uncial 0168]] has been lost and over thirty manuscripts are associated with a smaller set of designations.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;074, 084, 090, 0110, 0112, 0113, 0117, 0119, 0123, 0124, 0125, 0137, 0138, 0139, 0149, 0179, 0180, 0190, 0191, 0193, 0194, 0195, 0202, 0215, 0224, 0235, 0285, 0293.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes one number also applies to two separate manuscripts, as with uncial 092a and 092b, 0121a and 0121b, and 0278a and 0278b. Some other numerical designations should be reallocated to other lists: 055 (commentary), 0100 (lectionary), 0129 (lectionary), 0152 ([[Amulet|talisman]]), 0153 ([[ostracon]]), 0192 (lectionary), 0195 (lectionary), 0203 (lectionary).{{Elucidate|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Elliott, "The citation of manuscripts In recent printed editions of the Greek New Testament", ''Novum Testamentum'' XXV, 2 (1983), pp. 103–104; T.

== List of all registered New Testament uncial codices ==

* The numbers (#) are the now standard system of [[Biblical manuscripts#Gregory-Aland|Gregory-Aland]].
* Dates are estimated [[Palaeography|palaeographically]] by the INTF (except [[Codex Vaticanus 354]] where the scribe gave a date&amp;nbsp;— 949).
* Content generally only describes sections of the New Testament: [[Gospel]]s (Gosp), The [[Acts of the Apostles]] (Acts), [[Pauline Epistles]] (Paul), [[Catholic epistles]] (CE), and so on. Sometimes the surviving portion of a codex is so limited that specific books, chapters or even verses can be indicated. Linked articles, where they exist, generally specify content in detail, by verse.
* Digital images are referenced with direct links to the hosting web pages, with the exception of those at the [[INTF]]. The quality and accessibility of the images is as follows:

{| style="background:transparent"
|bgcolor="sandybrown"|Gold color indicates high resolution color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="tan"|Tan color indicates high resolution color images available locally, not online.
|-
|bgcolor="wheat"|Light tan color indicates only a small fraction of manuscript pages with color images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="lightgray"|Light gray color indicates black/white or microfilm images available online.
|-
|bgcolor="powderblue"|Light blue color indicates manuscript not imaged, and is currently lost or ownership unknown.
|-
|bgcolor="mistyrose"|Light pink color indicates manuscript destroyed, presumed destroyed, or deemed too fragile to digitize.
|-
|bgcolor="violet"|Violet color indicates high resolution ultraviolet images available online.
|}
&lt;br&gt;
† Indicates the manuscript has damaged or missing pages.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;K&lt;/sup&gt; Indicates manuscript also includes a commentary.&lt;br /&gt;
[ ] Brackets around Gregory-Aland number indicate the manuscript belongs to an already numbered manuscript, was found to not be a continuous text manuscript, is destroyed or presumed destroyed.

Only one uncial, [[Codex Sinaiticus]] has a complete text of the [[New Testament]]. [[Codex Alexandrinus]] has an almost complete text. It contains all books of the New Testament but lacks some leaves of Matthew (25), John (2), and Second Corinthians (3). [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] lacks the four last books, and the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] is not complete. Codex Ephraemi has approximately 66 per cent of the New Testament. Uncials with designations higher than 046 typically have only one or two leaves.

=== Uncials with sigla ===

The first 45 uncials have been assigned descriptive names as well as a single letter code called a ''[[siglum]]'', for usage in academic writing. Beginning with uncial 046 the assignment of ''sigla'' was dropped and only a few manuscripts thereafter received a descriptive name.

'''Léonce Rosenberg''' (12 September 1879 in [[Paris]] – 31 July 1947 in Neuilly-sur Seine) was an art historian, art collector, publisher and one of the most influential [[France|French]] [[art dealer]]s of the 20th century. The son of an antique dealer Alexander Rosenberg and brother of the gallery owner [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]] (21 rue de la Boétie, Paris), Léonce, a prominent gallery owner in [[Paris]] at the end of [[World War I]], would become one of the world's major dealers of [[Modern art]].

Leaving the family-owned gallery in 1910 Léonce opened his own business called ''Haute Epoque'' at 19 rue de La Baume, Paris. As an antiquarian Rosenberg began buying works by [[Cubist]] artists. By 1914 his collection included works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Auguste Herbin]], and [[Juan Gris]]. After serving in World War I (1916-1917) he pursued his interests and represented these and other artists, and by the end of the war opened a new show space, [[:fr:Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/learn/resources/archives/EAD/Rosenbergf Léonce Rosenberg Papers, Correspondence Relating to Cubism in The Museum of Modern Art Archives]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Léonce Rosenberg studied in London and Antwerp visiting galleries and museums in his free time.  After returning to Paris he worked with his brother Paul in the family business. In 1906 Léonce  and his brother inherited the family gallery on [[Avenue de l'Opéra]] which had been in existence for twenty years. His brother Paul was largely engaged in 19th- and early 20th-century art.

Léonce Rosenberg was an early advocate of [[Cubism]], and would remain so throughout the 1920s and 1930s. He discovered the works of [[avant-garde]] artists in 1911 through the [[Salon des Indépendants]], the art dealer [[Wilhelm Uhde]], and in 1912 at the gallery of [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]].

[[File:Jean Metzinger, invitation card, Léonce Rosenberg, Galerie de L'Effort Moderne, January 1919.jpg|thumb|230px|Jean Metzinger, invitation card for the exhibition at Léonce Rosenberg's [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]], January 1919]]
At the outset of [[World War I]] many German nationals living in France had their possessions sequestered by the French state. As a German citizen Kahnweiler took refuge in Switzerland and ran out of funds. With his art collection the hand of the French government he could no longer support his artists. Following the advice of [[Max Jacob]] and André Level (known for his well informed art investments), Léonce Rosenberg began amassing his collection. Just before the outbreak of [[World War I]] Rosenberg purchased 15 Cubist works by Picasso for 12,000 FF. His collection would soon include 20 works by Picasso, 10 by [[Georges Braque]], 5 by [[Juan Gris]] and 20 by [[Auguste Herbin]].&lt;ref name="Kubisme 1"&gt;[http://www.kubisme.info/kb107.html Léonce Rosenberg, Kubisme.info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franck"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3hYBzRzZ0kcC&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=%22André+Level%22,+Léonce+rosenberg&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_yT8iKJ_Fs&amp;sig=GKItuWScGloX_J8EFbwl5nLY4es&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4Ym0UejSH-rZ0QWR9IHICw&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22André%20Level%22%2C%20Léonce%20rosenberg&amp;f=false Dan Franck, ''Bohemian Paris: Picasso, Modigliani, Matisse, and the Birth of Modern Art'', Grove Press, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Very quickly and despite his lack of experience Rosenberg became the official dealer of the Cubists purchasing works, in addition to those he already owned, by artist such as [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Fernand Léger]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Henry Laurens]], [[Georges Valmier]] and [[:fr:Henri Hayden|Henri Hayden]]. Throughout [[World War I]] Rosenberg served as a moral and financial supporter of these artists. 'Without him' noted Max Jacob, 'a number of painters would be drivers or factory workers'.&lt;ref name="Franck" /&gt;

Picasso eventually switched over to his brother Paul Rosenberg's gallery, who would become his dealer [[Interwar period|Entre Deux Guerres]].

Rosenberg volunteered for military service in 1915. He moved into a house at rue Marthe Édouard in Meudon near the military base, but also retained his Paris apartment at 22 rue Lavoisier and his [[Hôtel particulier]] 19 Rue de la Baume in the [[8th arrondissement of Paris]]. During his periods of leave he continued to purchase Cubist works. From May, 1916, Rosenberg worked outside his unit as an English interpreter at the field headquarters of the Allied forces on the [[Somme (department)|Somme]] front. During leave at the end of 1916 Rosenberg, through the intermediary of [[Juan Gris]], went to [[Gino Severini]]'s studio and bought a large painting of Woman Reading; possibly Severini's 1916 ''Femme lisant (Jeanne dans l’atelier; La lecture n. 1)''. The death of [[Umberto Boccioni]] during the month of August 1916 marked Severini's rupture from [[Futurism]] and his move closer to the Cubists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fileadmin/mediatheque/integration_MO/PDF/DP/DP_Severini.pdf ''Gino Severini, Futuriste et néoclassique'', Musée d'Orsay, Musée de l'Orangerie – Jardin des Tuileries, exhibition catalogue, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1917, the second line of defense cleared Rosenberg's unit moved to [[Le Havre]]. In July of the same year Rosenberg returned to his old unit, now stationed at an airport in [[Nanterre]]. Closer to Paris, Rosenberg decided to reopen his gallery.&lt;ref name="Kubisme 1" /&gt;

With the support given by Léonce Rosenberg, Cubism reemerged as a central issue for artists after four years of war. Rosenberg found himself financially ruined but exhibited the works he owned at his newly opened Galerie de L'Effort Moderne (also known as ''Galerie Léonce Rosenberg'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.centrepompidou.fr/cpv/ressource.action?param.id=FR_R-cc931e156ad49248e214b3533147d3f5&amp;param.idSource=FR_CF-cc931e156ad49248e214b3533147d3f5 Galerie Léonce Rosenberg]&lt;/ref&gt; at 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and fashionable 8th arrondissement of Paris. The gallery was open to all forms of [[Cubism|Cubist]] and [[Abstract art]]. What followed would be a series of major [[Solo show (art exhibition)|one-man]] exhibitions—including works created between 1914 and 1918 by almost all the major Cubists.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916&amp;ndash;1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

The first solo exhibition was held in March 1918, featuring works by [[Auguste Herbin]].&lt;ref name="The Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/research/leonard-lauder-research-center/programs-and-resources/index-of-cubist-art-collectors/effort-moderne Effort Moderne, Galerie L, Paris], Index of Historic Collectors and Dealers of Cubism, 1918-1941, Leonard A. Lauder Research Center for Modern Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt; In December of the same year, Rosenberg launched a series of Cubist exhibitions, beginning with [[Henri Laurens]], followed in January 1919 with an exhibition of Cubist paintings by [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Fernand Léger]] in February, [[Georges Braque]] in March, [[Juan Gris]] April, [[Gino Severini]] May, and [[Pablo Picasso]] in June, marking the climax of the campaign. This well-orchestrated program showed that Cubism was still very much alive, despite claims by critics to the contrary,&lt;ref name="Gris"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=correspondence+Juan+Gris,+Maurice+Raynal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=omG4wHCpDC&amp;sig=jyC3HCXNGm4X7vTF98ybQOyk3Wc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeprVfHJBMz9Ur-NgLAI&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=correspondence%20Juan%20Gris%2C%20Maurice%20Raynal&amp;f=false Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin von Maur, Whitechapel Art Gallery, ''Juan Gris: Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 18 September -29 November 1992: Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 18 December 1992 - 14 February 1993: Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, 6 March - 2 May 1993'', Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 6, 22-60]&lt;/ref&gt; and it would remain so for at least a half-decade. Missing from this sequence of exhibitions were Jacques Lipchitz (who would exhibit in 1920), and those who had left France during the Great War: [[Robert Delaunay]] and [[Albert Gleizes]] most obviously. Nonetheless, according to art historian Christopher Green, "this was an astonishingly complete demonstration that Cubism had not only continued between 1914 and 1917, having survived the war, but was still developing in 1918 and 1919 in its "new collective form" marked by "intellectual rigor". In the face of such a display of vigour, it really was difficult to maintain convincingly that Cubism was even close to extinction".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Rosenberg also organized literary and musical events in his gallery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.metmuseum.org/search~S1/?searchtype=X&amp;searcharg=leonce+rosenberg&amp;searchscope=1&amp;sortdropdown=-&amp;SORT=DZ&amp;extended=0&amp;SUBMIT=Search&amp;searchlimits=&amp;searchorigarg=Xpaul+rosenberg Thomas J. Watson Library, The Catalog of the Libraries of The Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

The art collections of Kahnweiler and Uhde sequestered at the outset of World War I (which included works by Georges Braque, [[Raoul Dufy]], Juan Gris, Auguste Herbin, [[Marie Laurencin]], Fernand Léger, Jean Metzinger, Pablo Picasso, [[Jean Puy]] and [[Henri Rousseau]]) were sold by the government in a series of auctions at the [[Hôtel Drouot]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll18/id/5199/rec/6 The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries, ''Vente de biens allemands ayant fait l'objet d'une mesure de Séquestre de Guerre'': Collection Uhde.

From 1924 to 1927, Rosenberg made his activities known through his ''Bulletin de l'Effort moderne'' (Éditions de l'effort moderne), a publication featuring writings and illustrations by contributors such as Léonce Rosenberg, Albert Gleizes, Piet Mondrian, Gino Severini.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Bulletin_de_L_effort_Moderne.html?id=yTtDPgAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Bulletin de l'Effort moderne', Léonce Rosenberg, Albert Gleizes, Piet Mondrian, Gino Severini]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 Rosenberg moved his personal collection to his apartment rue de Longchamp, Paris, and commissioned the artists he championed to realize decorative panels. [[Giorgio de Chirico]] painted large panels for his living room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lesdiagonalesdutemps.com/article-de-l-homo-erotisme-chez-chirico-83382018.html Salon de Léonce Rosenberg, the gladiator series]&lt;/ref&gt; After 1928 exhibitions became sporadic, featuring solo exhibitions by de Chirico, Metzinger, and Valmier.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

Rosenberg commissioned [[Albert Gleizes]] (replacing [[Gino Severini]]) in 1929 to paint decorative panels for his Parisian residence. They were installed in 1931.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a%26r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881–1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 and 1932, the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne presented two large exhibitions of works by [[Francis Picabia]].&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

A veritable center of activity and interest during the rise of [[modern art]], the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne closed permanently in 1941, as a result of anti-Semitic laws and by the threat of the Nazi occupation of France. Eventually, the Nazi authorities looted some of his collection.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt; The gallery was not reopened following the war due primarily to Rosenberg’s death in July 1947.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

'''Saint Mateo Correa Magallanes''' (also known as Mateo Correa, Fr. Correa; 23 July 1866 – 6 February 1927) was a [[Knight of Columbus]], of Council 2140.&lt;ref name="knights"&gt;{{cite web

Correa was born at [[Tepechitlán]], [[Zacatecas]], [[Mexico]].  He attended the seminary at [[Zacatecas]] on a scholarship, in 1881. He was ordained as priest in 1893 at the age of 27. As a young priest, he gave first communion to [[Miguel Pro]] who also became a priest and was later martyred. Fr. Correa was assigned as a parish priest to [[Concepción del Oro]] in 1898, and then to [[Colotlán]] in 1908. Following the government's repression of the [[Catholic]] Church in 1910, he went into hiding. He was assigned to [[Valparaíso, Zacatecas|Valparaíso]] in 1926.

==Martyrdom==
In 1927, during the government’s continuing persecution of the Church, Fr. Correa was arrested by soldiers as he was bringing [[Viaticum]] to a woman invalid. Accused of being part of the armed [[Cristero]] defense, he was jailed in Zacatecas, and then in Durango. On 5 February 1927, Fr. Correa was asked by General Eulogio Ortiz, to hear the confessions of some imprisoned members of the [[Cristeros]], an uprising of Catholic men who decided to fight back against the persecution of the Church led by Mexico's president Plutarco Elias Calles. Father Correa agreed to administer the Sacrament of Confession to these prisoners, but afterward General Ortiz demanded to know what the condemned prisoners had confessed. Fr. Correa refused. General Ortiz then pointed a gun at Fr. Correa's head and threatened him with immediate death. Fr. Correa continued to refuse, and at dawn on February 6, 1927, he was taken to the cemetery on the outskirts of Durango and shot through the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{main|Ritual purity in Islam}}
In [[Sharia|Islamic law]], '''najis''' ({{lang-ar|{{large|نجس}}}}) are things or persons regarded as ritually unclean.&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Weinsinck |first=A.J. |editor=P.J. Bearman |editor2=Th. Bianquis |editor3=[[Clifford Edmund Bosworth|C.E. Bosworth]] |editor4=E. van Donzel |editor5=W.P. Heinrichs |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online |title=Nadjis |publisher=Brill Academic Publishers |issn= 1573-3912}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Islam, there are two kinds of najis: the essential najis which cannot be cleaned and the unessential najis which become najis while in contact with another najis.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Contact with ''najis'' things brings a Muslim into a state of ritual impurity ({{lang-ar|{{large|نجاسة}}}} ''najāsa'', in opposition to [[Taharah|ṭahārah]], ritual purity). Ritual purification is then required before religious duties such as regular prayers are performed.

==Islamic law==
According to the [[Shafi'i]] [[madhhab|school]] of [[Sunni]] [[fiqh|Islamic jurisprudence]], as systematised by [[Al-Nawawi]] in his book ''Minhadj'', the following things are ''najis'': wine and other spirituous drinks, dogs, swine, dead animals that were not ritually slaughtered, blood, excrements, and the milk of animals whose meat Muslims are not allowed to eat. [[Alcoholic beverage|Spirituous drink]]s are not impure according to the [[Hanafi]] school, while living swine and dogs are not impure according to the [[Maliki]]s.&lt;ref name="EI"/&gt; There is a difference of opinion as to whether alcoholic drinks are ''najis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t349/e0152?_hi=7&amp;_pos=2|title=Intoxicants - Oxford Islamic Studies Online|website=www.oxfordislamicstudies.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To the list of impure things enumerated by al-Nawawi, Shi’a jurists traditionally add dead bodies and non-believers.&lt;ref name="EI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis34"&gt;Lewis (1984), p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, meat of any animal which is killed in a manner other than that prescribed by Islam is najis.

''Najis'' things cannot be purified, in contrast to things which are defiled only (''mutanajis''), with the exception of wine, which becomes pure when made into vinegar, and of hides, which are purified by tanning.&lt;ref name="EI"/&gt;

==The Muṭahhirāt (The Purifying Agents)==
It is possible to purify a thing which has become ''najis''. These muṭahhirāt agents that can purify ''najis'' can be divided into three groups:

=== '''Nature''' ===

*Water
**The Qur'an says:
“He (Allah) is the one who sends the winds as good news before His mercy; and We send down pure water from the cloud." (25:48)
According to the shari'ah, water can be of two types: muṭlaq and muḍāf. Muṭlaq is pure water without putting it to a scientific test. The five forms of ''muṭlaq'' are the following: rain, well water, running or flowing water (river or stream), Kur water (lake, sea or ocean), and less than kur. Muḍāf is mixed water as in tea or kool aid. 
*the Earth
*the Sun

=== '''Physical Change''' ===

*istiḥālah (chemical change)
*inqilāb (change in properties)
*intiqāl (change in place)
*zawāl li-ʿayni n-najāsah (disappearance of the source of  najāsah)
*istibrāʾ (quarantining)

=== &lt;big&gt;'''Spiritual Change'''&lt;/big&gt; ===

* Islām
* tabaʿīyyah (following)
* ghaybat al-muslim (absence of a Muslim)

Not all of these agents can purify every ''najis''. However, among the agents water is the most universal purifying agent while the other agents are limited.

==Sources of law==
The notions of ritual impurity come mainly from the [[Qur'an]] and [[hadith]]. Swine and blood are declared forbidden food in the Qur'an.

The '''New Fire Ceremony''' (in [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] ''xiuhmolpilli''—the '''Binding of the Years''') was an [[Aztec]] [[ceremony]] performed once every 52 years — a full cycle of the [[Aztec calendar]]— in order to stave off the [[End times|end of the world]].

The first Aztec New Fire ceremony described in ethnohistorical sources was in 1090, according to the Mapa Sigüenza. But there is evidence of New Fire ceremonies having been celebrated in civilizations other and earlier than the Aztecs, for example at [[Xochicalco]] in the 6th century. According to [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], the last New Fire ceremony was held in 1507; the tradition ended with the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]] in 1519–1521.

The fact that New Fire ceremonies had been celebrated before the rise of the Aztec empire suggests that the Aztecs had inherited the ceremony from earlier civilizations of central Mexico and that it was not an original Aztec invention.&lt;ref&gt;Elson &amp; Smith 2001 p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anales de Tlatelolco]] mention that the Aztecs upon achieving independence of the [[Tepanec]] state celebrated a New Fire ceremony that marked the beginning of the calendric count of the Aztecs. This suggests that the ceremony was also used as a dynastic foundation rite.&lt;ref&gt;Elson &amp; Smith p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The celebration as described in ethnohistorical sources==
[[Image:New Fire.jpg|frame|left|The Aztec glyph for a New Fire ceremony, with the year Two Reed (''Ome Acatl'').]]
[[File:Codex Borbonicus (p. 34).jpg|thumb|Representation of a new fire ceremony (''[[Codex Borbonicus]]'', p.34).]]
The Celebration of the New Fire ceremony is described by Tovar. During the last five days (called [[nemontemi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nemontemi and the Month Quahuitlehua in the Aztec Solar Calendar|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/6743/zoom/#group=1&amp;page=1&amp;zoom=0.4064&amp;centerX=0.5000&amp;centerY=0.6885|work=World Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;) of the last year of the cycle, the preparations for the ceremony began. These preparations involved abstinence from work, fasting, ritual cleansing, ritual [[bloodletting]], destruction of old household items and observance of silence.&lt;ref&gt;Elson &amp; Smith 2001 p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that during these days the world was in grave danger because of the instability inherent in the shift from one cycle to another. It was feared that female stellar deities, the [[Tzitzimitl|Tzitzimime]], would descend and devour the earth.

At sunset on the last day of the year, which it always happened during the birth of [[Huitzilopochtli]], the day-sign "1 Tecpatl" of the year "2 Acatl,"&lt;ref&gt;Crónica Mexicayotl, Fernando Alvarado Tezozomoc p 36&lt;/ref&gt; a procession of priests from the fire cult of [[Huehueteotl]] walked from the ceremonial center of [[Tenochtitlan]] across the eastbound causeway towards a mountain called ''[[Cerro de la Estrella (archeological site)|Huixachtlan]]'' on the eastern bank of [[Lake Texcoco]] close to [[Pueblo Culhuacán|Colhuacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Elson &amp; Smith 2001 p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; The summit of Huizachtlan was visible from most of the Basin of Mexico. On this extinct [[volcano]] was a temple platform. At this time all fires in the Aztec realm were put out and everyone looked toward the mountain's summit. When the [[constellation]] called by the Aztecs "the fire drill" ([[Orion (constellation)|Orion's belt]]) rose above the horizon, a man was [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrificed]] on the top of Huizachtlan and a fire drill was placed on his chest. When the first sparks of fire sprung from the [[Firelighting#Friction|fire drill]], the New Calendar Round was declared begun and a huge bonfire was lit. From this bonfire torches were carried by runners to every ward of the city where the temple hearths would be lit. The first fires to be lit in this way were those at the twin temple [[Templo Mayor]] where the Tlatoani would participate, and later the fires at the [[Calmecac]] of Huitzilopochtli and subsequently the lesser temples and Calmecacs and [[Telpochcalli]]s and lastly private households.

==Archaeology==
[[File:NewFirePalacioCV.JPG|thumb|right|Stone etched with the symbol of the "new fire" or beginning of the 52-year cycle on the Aztec calendar. It is also inscribed with the dates 1 rabbit and 2 serpent. On display at the Palace of Cortes, Cuernavaca, Mexico]]
It has been proposed that archaeological evidence of New Fire ceremonies can be found in the shape of dumps of pottery and households utensils discarded in the initial stage of the celebration. The idea was first proposed by [[George Clapp Vaillant|George C. Vaillant]] in the 1930s but his model was criticized as theoretically unfounded and abandoned. In 2001 Elson and Smith rethought the proposal in light of the findings of several ceramic dumps that seemed to match the idea of what remains of New Fire ceremony would look like. They conclude that New Fire ceremonies were held throughout the Aztec sphere of influence and had a distinct importance at both the local level of each household and in the larger political level of the state religion.

The '''Okuyi''' (plural: '''Mekuyo''', also known as '''Ukuyi''', '''Ocuya''', '''Mokoi''', '''Mukudj''', '''Ikwara''', '''Okukwe''' and '''Mbwanda''', in Equatorial Guinea (Spanish): ''Mamarracho''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Milang: Part One |last=Fernandez Magaz |first=Manuel| publisher=Ministerio de Educación y Deportes, 1984 |isbn= 978-84-401-1217-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[rite of passage]] practised by several [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] [[Ethnic groups in Africa|ethnic groups]] in different countries mainly across the west coast of [[Central Africa]]. Some of the countries where the rite is exercised include [[Cameroon]] in West Central Africa, [[Gabon]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]]. Traditionally, the rite is performed at numerous special occasions including [[funerals]] and [[weddings]]. Usually when an [[infant]] reaches four months of age or when a [[child]] becomes an [[adolescent]], an Okuyi ritual is applied as well. Today, the Mekuyo rite is exercised by a range of ethnic peoples within the Bantu cluster. The coastal community known as [[Ndowe]], also known as ''playeros'', is a primary example, as peoples across Equatorial Guinea frequently perform the ritual in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Entre Dos Aguas |last=Fons |first=Virgínia| publisher=Ceiba Ediciones |isbn=84-933643-4-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabon has two chief ethnic groups that exercise the Okuyi rite including the [[Mpongwe]] and Galwa from [[Lambaréné]], Gabon. The man in the custome is usually the leader of the group.

The history of the Mekuyo can be traced back to Gabon. The dance is believed to have originated from the rites of passages initiated by western and southern ethnic groups like the Mpongwe and from the Galwa region. It was in the mid-nineteenth century when the [[Benga people]], who are both native to Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, introduced the ethnic performance to the island of [[Corisco]] and Cabo San Juan. At the end of the century, the coastal group of the [[Kombe people]] had extended the routine to [[Mbini]]. By the beginning of the twentieth century, several clans in [[Bata, Equatorial Guinea|Bata]] such as the ''Punta Mbonda'' had embraced the Mekuyo tradition. Throughout the Mekuyo’s history there have been several famous Ukuyi performers. Some of the most famous are from Equatorial Guinea such as ''Alonga'' from Corisco and ''Boso bua Ndondjo'' from Mbini. Well known Okuyi dancers from the [[Litoral Province (Equatorial Guinea)|Litoral Province]] include ''Kungulu'', ''Ngadi'', ''Aduma'' and ''Ngüende a limba'' from Ekuku.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Milang: Part One |last=Fernandez Magaz |first=Manuel| publisher=Ministerio de Educación y Deportes, 1984 |isbn=978-84-401-1217-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Costume==
The typical Okuyi performer wears a large, loose costume that supposedly resembles the spirit of the clan members’ ancestors. The ancestors are illustrated by the dancers as tranquil and serene and suggest that they were the people who safeguarded, counselled, and educated them from the residence of the deceased. Okuyi costumes are made either from the [[raffia palm]], a tree native to tropical African nations, or [[bamboo]]. In the process of manufacture, the underlying outfit is produced using the woven fabric [[hessian (cloth)|hessian]]. The thick textile forms the suit for the performer. After that design is complete, the material is covered by frills made from raffia palm which are woven into the hessian fabric. Performers usually wear black socks made of [[cotton]] on their feet as well as on their hands. Every dancer carries through his presentation wearing a mask made of a soft local wood known in Ndowe as  ''ikuka'' (''Alstonia congensis''), a species from the [[Evergreen|evergreen tree]] genus [[Alstonia]]. The man in the costume is usually the leader of the group.

In Gabon, the styles and colors generally remain the same throughout the country but in Equatorial Guinea, the types change depending on the location within the country. Hanging down from the mouth of the Okuyi is the skin of the [[servaline genet]] (''Genetta servalina''), a small forest cat. The skin has the role of protecting the Okuyi from bad spirits that threaten him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rites et Croyances des Peuples du Gabon |last= Raponda-Walker|first= André | publisher=Editions Raponda Walker |isbn=2-912776-57-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a relation with the Egyptian mythology of the feline type accompanying the journey of the soul of the dead, to the underworld. For the dead Okuyi who embodies the soul as well from the underworld simbolised by the genetta skin hanging from the mouth of the mask. The face masks on each performer is essential to identify the Okuyi. In Equatorial Guinea each mask differs from one another, however, in Gabon, the design has been kept constant since the nineteenth century. The design is basically a black chin and a black forehead with white covering the cheeks and upper face sides. The dark red eyes remain closed, as a sign that the person represented is dead. This contrasts with masks from Equatorial Guinea as the face masks range from geometrical forms to human faces. The majority of the masks have the eyes closed and very few have them open. Some masks that Mekuyo wear have a mirror attached on the forehead which also is used as a talisman. Mekuyo dancers also wear a cape known as an ''ecapa'' which is usually white and often features both the name of the Okuyi dancer, his birthplace and his birthdate.

[[File:Okuyi 5.JPG|thumb|left|Okuyi mask from Gabon]]

In Equatorial Guinea, there are commonly three principal colors painted on the wooden mask: white, red and black. These three colors represent diverse aspects which are illustrated to the audience but are mainly targeted to the initiated person who is the centre of the rite of passage. The colors on the mask aim to link in [[cosmogony]] to the ritual as the Mekuyo tradition is related to [[cosmos]] which are the customary dwellings of the spirits. The black on the mask typically symbolises darkness and death. The red displays the fight a person must perform during life, the strength needed to do so, the blood involved and the birth. The white demonstrates life, [[semen]] and the ancestors which the mask is supposed to portray.

==Rituals==
There are many types of Okuyi rituals exercised in several countries across Africa. In Equatorial Guinea, performances generally last approximately three hours, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. mostly on Sundays. Performances usually consist of the Ukuyi dancer dancing in short and fast episodes as he stomps his feet on the ground usually to a beat played by three drums and wooden sticks. At the same time, a female chorus sing in the background chanting greetings and welcomes to the Mekuyo. Usually the Okuyi holds palm leaves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-malanga.htm |title=What is a Malanga? |publisher=WiseGeek}}&lt;/ref&gt; or tall ''ibito'' branches or spears which gives them balance. The ''malanga'' leaves known as ''poto'' are used as a medium to plant the ''ibito''. Palm branches are used to bless the members of the audience. The ''ibito'' is traditionally planted into the ground by the Mekuyo at the beginning of the ceremony in front of the chorus. The base of the ''ibito'' plant has a sack held by several ''poto'' leaves holding numerous barks from a variety of trees. This is supposed to provide security for the Mekuyo as well as for the members of the crowd.

In all performances, the Mekuyo are assisted by the ''Mboni'', which are a group of initiated young men who have the responsibility to care and assist the Mekuyo and encourage the dancing and singing. The ''Mboni'' also have the job to groom and carry the masks. The Okuyi’s identity is strictly secret and nobody in the audience is meant to know who is under the costume. The ''Mboni'' might become an Okuyi in the future. They are typically meant to be very agile and skilful dancers and musicians as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Visions of Africa: Punu |last= Perrois |first= Louis | publisher=5 Continents Editions |isbn=978-88-7439-401-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For infants===
One of the most common types of rituals is for new mothers and their babies. When an infant reaches about four months of age, it is taken for a Mekuyo rite of passage where it enters another stage of his or her life. In the past, the Ukuyi used to take the baby from the mother and most of the time the baby didn't cry. As the baby was entering its new stage, a chorus chanted around the baby. Together they sang several songs, one of them being a tune about a [[black panther|panther]] taking the baby. However, in the present, the mother is permitted to hold the infant at all times in most of the rites.  The actual ritual involves the mother and child being placed in the centre of the ring surrounded by the chorus and the audience, the mother holds the baby and sits on a chair. The Okuyi points at the baby with the ''malanga'' or sometimes a spear as a way to bless them. Then, water which has been previously placed in a bucket is sprinkled on the baby. The Okuyi dances around the baby and mother as they sit.

===Funerals===
[[File:Okuyi 3.jpg|thumb|Ukuyi during a performance in Equatorial Guinea]]
The Mekuyo are known for their intermittent dances. In funeral performances the primary mourner traditionally sits on a chair in the middle of an open area and surrounding him or her is an Okuyi dancing in his normal method similar to the new mother's rite "djae". Like during most of the dances, the Mekuyo uses the palm, fern leaves or skins to bless both the mourner and the members of the audience.

==Music==
The songs featured in the Mekuyo presentations are normally in a [[polyrhythmic]] style. The instruments used are a certain type of drum known as [[Ngoma drums]] with the biggest kind being named the ''monduma''. Traditionally, these drums used to be buried in the trunk of various [[banana|banana trees]]. It is this that caused the sound to be heard as a deeper pitch. This was accompanied by the ''mosomba'' drum or, as it was called by the Kombe people, the ''ikubi''. However, substitutes for drums are often used. One of the most common alternatives is a metal bucket filled with stones.

Chants that are sung with the instruments are sometimes done in the old [[Benga language]], proving incomprehensible for the actual people who perform them and listen to them. Often however, the tunes are sung in the language of the people who chant them. The songs’ introductions are commenced by the males who give the first opening tones. Then the women follow. Women are the key voices of the chorus in Mekuyo dances as the Okuyi requires the female voice to dance appositely. The lyrics of the melodies the choir sings educate the listeners about everyday life possessions, experiences and traditional folklore. A common theme is reality of the Ndowe kinfolk or events that have happened to important people of the community in the past. The songs are an important way to communicate historical knowledge. This information is then passed to others through the singing and used as an expression to form a frame of the dances of the Mekuyo. In funerals, the Mekuyo music and dance is used to break the mourning period and bring hope to all the mourners for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Instrumentos musicales de las etnias de Guinea ecuatorial |last= Aranzadi |first=Isabela de| publisher=Apadena |isbn=978-84-612-0340-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Opiate'''" is a song by [[Tool (band)|Tool]] and the title track from their [[Opiate (EP)|debut EP]] recorded by producer [[Sylvia Massy]] at [[Sound City Studios]] in 1991. While never released as an official [[single (music)|single]], it is one of the best known songs among their early work. "Opiate" serves as the final track of the ''Opiate'' EP and contains the [[hidden track]], "The Gaping Lotus Experience."

The song's title and lyrics apparently elaborate on the [[Marxist]] concept that "[[Opium of the people|religion is the opium of the masses]]". Keenan's lyrics liken religion to rape and abuse by a person or group of people to another person or group of people. The lyric "deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow, what you need is someone strong to guide you" supports this notion. Sometimes when played live, Keenan sings "...what you need is someone strong to ''use'' you".

==Live performances==
"Opiate" has held a regular position on Tool's concert setlist since 1992. In 1994, it was often played back-to-back with "Flood," transitioning smoothly between songs and skipping the lengthy "Flood" intro. By 1996, "Opiate" would often serve as the [[wikt:penultimate|penultimate]] song of concerts, preceding "[[Ænema]]." Maynard James Keenan has dedicated the song to [[psychologist]] and author [[Timothy Leary]] on multiple occasions and to former Tool [[bass guitar|bassist]] [[Paul D'Amour]] on others, referring to him as "Paul of Love."&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|mRV1ud-rCyM|TOOL-Opiate 11.1.2001 Audio w/Tricky}}. Retrieved on August 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various musicians have collaborated with Tool in performing "Opiate" live. Examples include [[Layne Staley]] in 1993 and '94,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=12229 Metal News - Tool's Keenan 'Near Perfect' For Alice In Chains ( Metal Underground . com )&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;[http://toolshed.down.net/tour/fall01/011023.html The Tool Page: Tour Reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Heitham Al-Sayed]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=fr&amp;u=http://log.fleur.net/category/Sound&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3DHeitham%2BAl-Sayed%2Bopiate%2Btool%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26sa%3DG Heitham Al-Sayed with Tool]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nu metal]] band [[Limp Bizkit]] has also been known to have [[cover version|covered]] the song live.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|ycYnqwQlCMA|Limp Bizkit Opiate Cover}} (March 16, 2006).

{{Hinduism}}
'''Pratiyogitvam''', a [[Sanskrit]] term, means recognizing 'difference' by noting the 'otherness' in another thing; 'difference' means - 'the want of the total characteristic of one thing in another'. Differences are of three kinds – a) 'difference existing in oneself' (''svajātiya-bheda''), b) 'difference in species' (''svagata-bheda''), and c) 'difference of genus' (''vijātiya-bheda''). These differences do not exist in Brahman who is one without a second. The [[Upanishads]] negate these differences in Brahman who is self-revealing and can be experienced when all mentations cease, what is then experienced is not nothing, for there can be no knowledge of a thing that does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi |author=Sri Vidyaranya Swami |publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=39,49|url=http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/pancadasi-of-sri-vidyaranya-swami/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

After explaining that creation means the appearance of names and forms which cannot be parts of [[Brahman]], for before creation they did not arise, and that one object differs from another on account of its name and form whereas Brahman is absolutely without name and form, with regard to 'non-existence', [[Vidyaranya]] in his [[Panchadasi]] (Stanza II-25) tells us:

{{quote|{{lang|sa|विजातीयमसत्तत्तु न खल्वस्तीति गम्यते
नास्यातः प्रतियोगित्वं विजातीयाभ्दिदा कुतः}}

And about non-existence: we cannot say that it (is something that) exists. So it cannot serve as a ''pratiyogin''. If so, how can there be ''vijātiya'' difference.}}

In which context, [[Swami Swahananda]] explains that to speak of 'difference' from a thing which does not exist conveys no meaning. The world is not really real so it cannot stand on the same footing. ''Bheda'' means 'difference', or 'not itself or the same but another'. ''Pratiyogitvam'', a technical term, means recognizing 'difference' by noting the 'otherness' in another thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi |author=Sri Vidyaranya Swami |publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|page=40|url=http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/pancadasi-of-sri-vidyaranya-swami/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-existence==

'Non-existence' is something that appears and is later negated or contradicted; the falsehood of an appearance (''[[Mithyatva]]'') consists in the fact that its existence may be denied, in all the three temporal relations, in the locus or the entity where it is perceived. The illusory object is both, existent and non-existent; it appears as existent, but is yet not such an existent which remains un-contradicted in the past, present and future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Essays|author= Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|page=342|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x5CqteQdJaAC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;dq=pratiyogitvam#v=onepage&amp;q=pratiyogitvam&amp;f=false|isbn= 9788120807501|date= 1990-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mithya'', in [[Advaita Vedanta]],is not to be understood as illusion; ''mithya'' is that which is not unreal because it appears, but is not real since later it disappears; so too is it with [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]. [[Gaudapada]] tells us that the utility of the objects seen in the waking state is contradicted by the dream state; objects have to be regarded as ''mithya'' since they have a beginning and an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vivekacudamani with commentary of Candrasekhara Bharati of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=129|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J-U3twAACAAJ|year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pratiyogin==

The word ''Pratiyogin'' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|प्रतियोगिन्}}) means opposing, counteracting, impeding, related or corresponding to, being or forming a counterpart of anything, equally matched, an object dependent upon another, counter-entity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=Vaman Shivram Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of South Asia|page=178|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/contextualize.pl?p.4.apte.152810}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also means uninterrupted succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaivalya Pada|publisher=International Infopage for Ashtanga Yoga|url=http://www.ashtangayoga.info/source-texts/yoga-sutra-patanjali/chapter-4/item/kshana-pratiyogi-parinama-aparanta-nirgrahyah/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Madhvacharya]] the counter-correlate (''pratiyogi'') in the case of absolute negation, which is limitless, is the absolutely non-existent itself; non-existence is also called the negation whose counter-correlate is a myth. Being the counter-correlate is not an attribute which requires or presupposes the actual existence of a referent like other predications of attributes like colour; to be the counter-correlate of a negation is merely being the referent of such knowledge as would enable the formation of the idea of negation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophy of Sri Madhavacharya|author= B.N.Krishnamurti Sharma|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U8XVE0_TiLMC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=pratiyogitvam#v=onepage&amp;q=pratiyogitvam&amp;f=false|isbn= 9788120800687|year= 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the cognition of distinctness which gives rise to an expectation about a counter-positive i.e. to a counter-correlate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Classical Indian Metaphysics|author= Stephen H. Phillips|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|page=300|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMA2RQ61OgoC&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=pratiyogitvam#v=onepage&amp;q=pratiyogitvam&amp;f=false|isbn= 9788120814899|year= 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, 'being' is defined as that which at all times and in all places cannot be denied or which being different from non-being, is not a false imposition or as that which at some time or other is directly and rightly felt as existing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Indian Philosophy Vol.4|author=Surendranath Dasgupta|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ml2H_z0E7bAC&amp;pg=PA224&amp;lpg=PA224&amp;dq=pratiyogitvam#v=onepage&amp;q=pratiyogitvam&amp;f=false|isbn=9788120804159|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, difference between genera are apprehended along with counter-correlates, which are remote in space and time. Perception of ''Svarupa'' ('one’s own form') and ''Bheda'' ('difference') is immediate upon an encounter with the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visistadvaita|author=V.Krishnaraj|url=http://www.bhagavadgitausa.com/Visistadvaita-Satadusani.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==

In the context of [[Brahma Sutras]] (IV.1) which refers to the 'inferred entity' (''Pradhana'') of the ''[[Samkhya]]''s, [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] explains that the term, ''[[Avyakta]]'' (which is not manifest) can be applied equally to any other subtle and inscrutable thing, and does not conventionally mean any particular thing; the identity of a thing cannot be established merely from the similarity of the order of treatment unless the nature of the thing itself is recognized as identical. The Supreme Self is presented by [[Katha Upanishad]] (I.iii.10) as the master of the chariot, that is so because the experiencer can reasonably be superior to the objects of experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|pages=244–246|url=https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/8121|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224112052/https://advaitaashrama.org/Book/Detail/8121|archivedate=2013-12-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kena Upanishad]] (I.5) prohibits meditation on Brahman because Brahman is beyond the range of speech and mind, and because the attribute-less Brahman cannot be an object of knowledge. Swami Swahananda in the context of  'leading' error being potent enough to give correct results states that meditation on or worship of Brahman can lead to liberation even though the form of Brahman worshipped is illusory. As long as the delusion of identifying the body with Brahman prevails, a man will not realise identity of the individual self with the Supreme self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pancadasi |author=Sri Vidyaranya Swami |publisher=Sri Ramakrishna Math|pages=381, 383|url=http://www.chennaimath.org/istore/product/pancadasi-of-sri-vidyaranya-swami/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proselytism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|r|ɒ|s|əl|ᵻ|t|ɪ|z|əm}}) is the act of attempting to [[Religious conversion|convert]] people to another [[religion]] or opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Definition of proselytism| url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/proselytism|publisher=The Free Dictionary| accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Dictionary.com |proselytism | accessdate=2013-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''proselytize'' is derived from the [[Greek language]] prefix {{wikt-lang|grc|προσ-}} ({{transl|grc|pros-}}, "toward") and the verb {{wikt-lang|grc|ἔρχομαι}} ({{transl|grc|érchomai}}, "to come") in the form of {{lang|grc|προσήλυτος}} ({{transl|grc|prosélytos}}, "newcomer").&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|prosh/lutos|προσήλυτος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Historically in the [[Koine Greek]] [[Septuagint]] and [[New Testament]], the word [[proselyte]] denoted a [[Gentile]] who was considering [[conversion to Judaism]].  Though the word proselytism originally referred to [[Early Christianity]] (and earlier [[Gentiles]] such as [[God-fearer]]s), it now refers to the attempt of any religion or religious individuals to convert people to their beliefs, or any attempt to convert people to a different point of view, religious or not. Proselytism is illegal in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;Religion, Politics, and Globalization: Anthropological Approaches - Page 224, Galina Lindquist, Don Handelman - 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahá'í Faith==
In the writings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], the endeavour to attract people to the religion is strongly emphasized.&lt;ref name="EncyBah"&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = P. |year = 2000 |title = A Concise Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |publisher = Oneworld Publications |location = Oxford, UK |isbn = 1-85168-184-1 | pages = 334–335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of attracting people to the religion is referred to as teaching.&lt;ref name="EncyBah"/&gt;  The term proselytism is given the connotation of aggressively teaching the religion to others - as such, it is prohibited.&lt;ref name="hatcher"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Hatcher |first = W.S. |last2 = Martin |first2 = J.D. |year = 1998 |title = The Bahá'í Faith: The Emerging Global Religion |publisher = Harper &amp; Row |location = New York, NY |isbn = 0-06-065441-4 | ref = harv |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IZmkG1ASirgC | page = 220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every Bahá'í has the obligation of teaching their religion, as it is seen as the path toward bringing peace and justice to the world.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"&gt;{{cite book |last = Smith |first = Peter |year = 2008 |title = An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith |publisher = Cambridge University Press |place = Cambridge |url = https://books.google.com/?id=z7zdDFTzNr0C  |isbn = 0-521-86251-5 | ref = harv | pages = 198–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Bahá'ís move to other countries or cities where there are a small number of Bahá'ís to help spread the religion, and this is called [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneering]].&lt;ref name="EncyBah"/&gt;  Some other Bahá'ís move from place to place in a process called travel teaching.&lt;ref name="EncyBah"/&gt;  When moving or travelling to other countries Bahá'ís are encouraged to integrate into their new society and apply Bahá'ís principles in living and working with their neighbours.  In total, however, only a small minority of Bahá'ís are directly teaching their religion to others.&lt;ref name="hatcher" /&gt; Despite this, religion has [[Growth of religion|grown]] "at least twice as fast as the population of almost every UN region" over the last century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Johnson| first =Todd M. |author2=Brian J. Grim  | title =The World's Religions in Figures: An Introduction to International Religious Demography |chapter =Global Religious Populations, 1910–2010  |chapterurl =https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/9781118555767.ch1|publisher =John Wiley &amp; Sons| date =26 March 2013| pages =59–62| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=CkFVF8nFiqkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA59#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|doi =10.1002/9781118555767.ch1| isbn = 9781118555767}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, wrote that those who would be teaching his religion should emphasize the importance of ethics and wisdom, and he counselled Bahá'ís to be unrestrained and put their trust in God.  At the same time he stated that Bahá'ís should exercise moderation, tact and wisdom and not be too aggressive in their teaching.&lt;ref name="Smith2008"/&gt; In sharing their faith with others, Bahá'ís are cautioned to make sure the person they are proposing to teach is open to hearing what they have to say.  In most countries becoming a Bahá'í is a simple matter of filling out a card stating a declaration of belief. This includes acknowledgement of Bahá'u'llah as the [[Manifestation of God|messenger of God]] for this age, awareness and acceptance of his teachings, and intention to be obedient to the institutions and laws he established.  It does not involve negating one's previous beliefs, due to the Bahá'í belief in [[Progressive revelation (Bahá'í)|progressive revelation]].

==Christianity==
{{Main|Evangelism|List of converts to Christianity|Christianization|Forced conversion#Christianity|Mission (Christianity)}}
[[Image:Stpatrick.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[St. Patrick]] of the Celtic Church, who was famous for proselytizing]]

Many [[Christianity|Christians]] consider it their obligation to follow what is often termed the [[Great Commission]] of [[Jesus]], recorded in the final verses of the [[Gospel]] of [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]]: "Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit: Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you: and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world. Amen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Matthew|28:19-20|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Acts of the Apostles]] and other sources contain several accounts of early Christians following this directive by engaging in individual conversations and mass sermons to spread the [[Good News (Christianity)|Good News]]. [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christians]] often use the term ''witnessing'' to mean discussing one's faith with another person with the intent of proselytism.

Most self-described Christian groups have organizations devoted to [[missionary]] work which in whole or in part includes proselytism of the non-religious and people of other faiths (including sometimes other variants of Christianity).

Some Christians define ''proselytize'' more narrowly as the attempt to convert people from one Christian tradition to another; those who use the term in this way generally view the practice as illegitimate and in contrast to [[evangelism]], which is converting non-Christians to Christianity.  An [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] writer, Stephen Methodius Hayes, has written: "If people talk about the need for evangelism, they meet with the response, 'the Orthodox church does not proselytize' as if evangelizing and proselytism were the same thing."  However the boundary varies from group to group.
For instance the [[Moscow Patriarchate]] has repeatedly strongly condemned what it describes as [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] proselytism of Orthodox Christians within Russia and has therefore opposed a Catholic construction project in an area of [[Russia]] where the Catholic community is small.  The Catholic Church claims that it is supporting the existing Catholic community within Russia and is not proselytizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Kondrusiewicz  | first =Archbishop Tadeusz  | title =Moscow's Catholic Archbishop Responds to Alexy II's Accusations  | publisher =Innovative Media, Inc  | date =2002-02-15  | url =http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=16708  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20020307112311/http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=16708  | dead-url =yes  | archive-date =2002-03-07  | accessdate =2007-09-29  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Fagan  | first =Geraldine  | title =Altai officials prefer eyedrops and cattle to Catholics  | publisher =Forum 18 News Service  | date =2005-08-03  | url =http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=624  | accessdate =2007-09-29  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title =Russian patriarch renews complaints on Catholic "proselytism"  | publisher =Directions to Orthodoxy  | date =2005-06-05  | url =http://directionstoorthodoxy.org/mod/news/view.php?article_id=198  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20071016190204/http://directionstoorthodoxy.org/mod/news/view.php?article_id=198  | dead-url =yes  | archive-date =2007-10-16  | accessdate =2007-09-29  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the [[Balamand declaration]] on proselytism was released between the Roman Catholic Church and Orthodox Churches.

Buddhism does not have an accepted or strong proselytism tradition with the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] having taught his followers to respect other religions and the clergy.&lt;ref name="Source1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/proselytization-and-buddhism-449625 |title=Proselytization and Buddhism

Aggressive proselytizing is discouraged in the major Buddhist schools and Buddhists do not engage in the practice of proselytisation.&lt;ref name="Source1"/&gt;

Some adherents of [[Nichiren Buddhism]] proselytise in a process called [[Shakubuku]].

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Conversion to Hinduism|List of converts to Hinduism|Forced conversion#Hinduism}}
[[Hinduism]] lacks a proselytism tradition. Classical Hinduism represents diversity of views and theology. Its followers are free to follow any theistic, non-theistic or other ideas it discusses. Followers can pick or change to any philosophy or belief he or she fancies and worship any personal god or goddess in a manner they deem fit. In the modern era, religious conversion from and to Hinduism has been a controversial subject. Some state the concept of missionary activity and proselytism is anathema to the precepts of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=arvindmr&gt;Arvind Sharma (2011), Hinduism as a Missionary Religion, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438432113}}, pages 31-53&lt;/ref&gt;

While proselytism is not a part of the Hindu tradition, religious conversion to various traditions within Hinduism such as Vaishnavism, Shaivism and Shaktism has a long history.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jan Gonda]], The Indian Religions in Pre-Islamic Indonesia and their survival in Bali, in {{Google books|X7YfAAAAIAAJ|Handbook of Oriental Studies.

The debate on proselytization and religious conversion between Christianity, Islam and Hinduism is more recent, and started in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=rafiuddinahmed&gt;Rafiuddin Ahmed (1992), Muslim-Christian Polemics, in ''Religious Controversy in British India: Dialogues in South Asian Languages'' (Editor: Kenneth Jones), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791408278}}, pages 93-120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ayeshajalal&gt;Ayesha Jalal (2010), Partisans of Allah: Jihad in South Asia, Harvard University Press, {{ISBN|978-0674047365}}, pages 117-146&lt;/ref&gt; Religious leaders of some Hindu reform movements such as the [[Arya Samaj]] launched ''Shuddhi'' movement to proselytize and reconvert Muslims and Christians back to Hinduism,&lt;ref name=csadcock&gt;CS Adcock (2014), The Limits of Tolerance: Indian Secularism and the Politics of Religious Freedom, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199995448}}, pages 1-35, 115-168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Coward (1987), Modern Indian Responses to Religious Pluralism, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0887065729}}, pages 49-60&lt;/ref&gt; while those such as the [[Brahmo Samaj]] suggested Hinduism to be a non-missionary religion.&lt;ref name=arvindmr/&gt; All these sects of Hinduism have welcomed new members to their group, while other leaders of Hinduism's diverse schools have stated that given the intensive proselytization activities from missionary Islam and Christianity, this "there is no such thing as proselytism in Hinduism" view must be re-examined.&lt;ref name=arvindmr/&gt;&lt;ref name=csadcock/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gauri Viswanathan (1998), Outside the Fold: Conversion, Modernity, and Belief, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691058993}}, pages 153-176&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hare Krishna====

One group that takes in willing converts in Hinduism is the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness]] also known as Hare Krishnas.  Devotees of the [[Krishna Consciousness]] have no codified rituals of conversion, but promote recitation of the [[Hare Krishna mantra]] as a means to achieve a mature stage of love of God. ISKCON adherents view Krishna as the supreme deity that those of other faith traditions worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy|url=http://iskcon.org/philosophy|work=International Society for Krishna Consciousness|publisher=iskcon.org|accessdate=24 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920042816/http://iskcon.org/philosophy|archivedate=20 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A commonly accepted notion among Krisna Consciousness devotees is that ISKCON allows one to recognize the primacy of the supreme deity, Krishna, in the practices and traditions of other faiths.  Krishna Consciousness promotes the concept of [[Sanatana-Dharma]] (Hinduism), the 'eternal law' that other faiths can uncover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sebastian|first=Rodney|author2=Parmeswaran |title=Hare Krishnas in Singapore: Agency, State, and Hinduism|journal=Sojourn: Journal of Social Issues in Southeast Asia|date=April 2008|volume=23|issue=1|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
Mahavira (599–527 BC), the 24th Tirthankara of [[Jainism]], developed an early philosophy regarding relativism and subjectivism known as ''[[Anekantavada]]''.  As a result of this acceptance of alternate religious practices, the phenomenon of proselytisation is largely absent in these religions but not unknown. Converts are welcome to the Jain faith.

===Sikhism===
{{Main|List of converts to Sikhism}}
[[Sikhism]] is not a proselytizing religion and proselytism is largely discouraged "through force or inducement" out of the belief that each person has a fundamental right to practice their religion freely.&lt;ref name="Āhalūwālīā1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Āhalūwālīā|first=Jasabīra Siṅgha|title=The sovereignty of the Sikh doctrine: Sikhism in the perspective of modern thought|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u37XAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 September 2010|year=1983|publisher=Bahri|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main|Shahada|List of converts to Islam|Dawah|Islamic missionary activity|Islamization}}
[[File:Lies-IMG 7967.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Proselytizer distributing copies of the [[Qur'an]] in [[Switzerland]]. (''Lies!'' is German for ''Read!'') ]]
In [[Islam]], inviting people to the religion is a meritorious activity. The [[Qur'an]] states, "''There is no (permission) to force (anyone into following this) way of life.  The truth stands clear from error.  Whoever rejects falsehood and believes in Allah has grasped a firm hand-hold that will never break, for Allah hears and knows (all things). Al Baqarah'' ('The Cow', 2:256)". Muslim scholars consider this passage to mean that force is not to be used to convert someone to Islam. Muslims consider inviting others to Islam to be the mission originally carried out by the Prophets of Allah and is now a collective duty of Muslims. In the Qur'an Allah states, "''Invite (others) to the way of your Lord with wisdom and beautiful preaching, and reason with them in ways that are best. Your Lord knows best who is straying from His path and who is being guided (towards it). An Nahl'' ('The Bee', 16:125)"

==Judaism==
{{Further|Conversion to Judaism|Forced conversion#Judaism}}
Unlike in the [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic era]] ([[Second Temple Judaism]]), in the modern era [[Judaism]] generally does not proselytize non-Jews. Instead, non-Jews are encouraged to follow [[Noahide Law]], assuring a place in the [[world to come]]. In ancient times, these observant non-Jews could become ''[[Ger toshav|geirim toshvim]]'', a term still sometimes used informally to refer to those who strive to follow these laws and who will join the Jewish people in the world to come. A non-Jew who follows Noahide law is considered to believe in [[Noahidism]]; for this end, there is some minor outreach by Orthodox Jewish organizations.

Generally, Jews expect any convert to Judaism to come through their own accord. A common source of converts are those who have married a Jewish person, though there are also many people who join for spiritual or other personal reasons; these people are called "Jews by choice".&lt;ref name="KrauszTulea"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ernest Krausz|author2=Gitta Tulea|title=Jewish Survival: The Identity Problem at the Close of the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dnxv-Mlz0JIC&amp;pg=PA97|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-1-4128-2689-1|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rabbis will often discourage new members from joining, although they may provide guidance through seminars or personal meetings for those who are truly interested. [[Orthodox Judaism]] in theory neither encourages nor discourages conversion. Standards for conversion can be very challenging, but rabbis will acquiesce to persistent and sincere requests for conversion. Much emphasis is placed on gaining a [[Jewish identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moss|first=Aron|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=248165|title=Why Do Rabbis Discourage Conversions? - Jewish Identity|publisher=Chabad.org|accessdate=2012-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proselytization does occur among Jews, as they are an ethnoreligious group comprising a spectrum of beliefs that include forms of religious non-observance (such as [[Jewish atheism|atheism]]). Among the many groups that encourage nonobservant Jews to be observant include [[Aish HaTorah]] and [[Chabad]].

==Inherited membership==
{{See also|Ethnoreligious group}}
Sects of some religions, such as the [[Druze]] and [[Zoroastrians]], do not accept converts at all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/172195/Druze The Druze permit no conversion, either away from or to their religion.] retrieved 29 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/conversion-vii CONVERSION vii. Modern Zoroastrians disagree on whether it is permissible for outsiders to enter their religion.] retrieved 29 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits==
Proselytism is considered inappropriate, disrespectful, and offensive by some individuals. As such, it is not protected in certain environments open to the public or are owned privately: government buildings, public education (grade schools and college campuses), the workplace and private properties like ones' home or front yard. These environments, due to either their openness or privacy, are often where proselytism takes place and can come from a variety of sources depending on the environment (e.g., students or teachers in schools and colleges, coworkers or employers, office workers, family members, or neighbors in a community).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Some countries such as Greece&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= English translation of the Greek constitution - Article 13.2|url=http://www.hri.org/docs/syntagma/artcl25.html#A13}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibited all proselytism until 1994 when Jehovah's Witnesses were legally recognized as a religion and allowed to preach. Some countries such as Morocco prohibit it except for Islam.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Some restrict it in various ways such as prohibiting attempts to convert children{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} or prohibit offering physical benefits to new converts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Religious groups also draw lines between what they are willing to do or not do to convert people. For instance the [[Catholic Church]] in ''[[Ad gentes]]'' states that "The Church strictly forbids forcing anyone to embrace the Faith, or alluring or enticing people by worrisome wiles."{{cn|date=September 2018}}

The [[World Council of Churches]] in ''The Challenge of Proselytism and the Calling to Common Witness''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pu3uUd-csnIC&amp;pg=PA895 Growth in Agreement II], p. 895&lt;/ref&gt; states the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
19. Proselytism as described in this document stands in opposition to all ecumenical effort. It includes certain activities which often aim at having people change their church affiliation and which we believe must be avoided, such as the following:
*making unjust or uncharitable references to other churches’ beliefs and practices and even ridiculing them;
*comparing two Christian communities by emphasizing the achievements and ideals of one, and the weaknesses and practical problems of the other;
*employing any kind of physical violence, moral compulsion and psychological pressure e.g. the use of certain advertising techniques in mass media that might bring undue pressure on readers/viewers;
*using political, social and economic power as a means of winning new members for one’s own church;
*extending explicit or implicit offers of education, health care or material inducements or using financial resources with the intent of making converts;
*manipulative attitudes and practices that exploit people’s needs, weaknesses or lack of education especially in situations of distress, and fail to respect their freedom and human dignity.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Raul Hilberg''' (June 2, 1926 – August 4, 2007) was an [[Austrians|Austrian]]-born Jewish-American [[Political Science|political scientist]] and [[historian]]. He was widely considered to be the world's [[wiktionary:preeminent|preeminent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Joffe | first = Lawrence | title = Obituary: Raul Hilberg | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 2007-09-25 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/sep/25/guardianobituaries.obituaries | accessdate = 2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Wyman | first = David | author-link = David Wyman | title = Managing the Death Machine | newspaper = The New York Times | date = 1985-08-11 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/11/books/managing-the-death-machine.html | accessdate =2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Woo | first = Elaine | title = Raul Hilberg, 81; scholar was an authority on the Holocaust | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | date = 2007-08-07 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/07/local/me-hilberg7 | accessdate = 2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; scholar of the [[Nazi holocaust|Holocaust]], and his three-volume, 1,273-page ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'', is regarded as a seminal study of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Final Solution]].

== Life and career ==
Hilberg was born in [[Vienna]], [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]], to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family from [[Polish people|Poland]] and [[Romanian people|Romania]].

Hilberg was very much a loner, pursuing solitary hobbies such as geography, music and [[train spotting]].&lt;ref name=popper&gt;Popper, Nathaniel (March&amp;nbsp;31, 2010). "[https://www.thenation.com/article/conscious-pariah/ A Conscious Pariah]" [on Raul Hilberg]. ''[[The Nation]]''. Retrieved 2016-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; Though his parents attended [[synagogue]] on occasion, he personally found the irrationality of religion repellent and developed an allergy to it. He did however attend a [[Zionism|Zionist]] school in Vienna, which inculcated the necessity of defending against, rather than surrendering to, the rising menace of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name=popper /&gt; Following the March 1938 [[Anschluss]], his family was evicted from their home at gunpoint and his father was arrested by the Nazis, but he was later released because of his service record as a combatant during [[World War I]]. One year later, on April 1, 1939, at age 13, Hilberg fled Austria with his family; after reaching France, they embarked on a ship bound for [[Cuba]]. Following a four-month stay in Cuba, his family arrived in the United States on September 1, 1939, the day the [[World War II|Second World War]] broke out in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Raul Hilberg | url = http://www.rutlandherald.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070806/OBITUARIES/708060352/1010/OBITUARIES | date = 2007-08-06 | newspaper = Rutland Herald | accessdate = 2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing war in Europe, 26 members of Hilberg's family were killed in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Luc Ferry]] and S.Passquier, interview with Hilberg, 'Les fonctionnaires du génocide', in ''L'Express international'', May 27, 1988 pp.50-58, Cited Gie Van den Berghe, '[http://www.journalbelgianhistory.be/en/system/files/article_pdf/BTNG-RBHC%2C%2021%2C%201990%2C%201-2%2C%20pp%20110-124.pdf The Incompleteness of a Masterpiece: Raul Hilberg and the Destruction of European Jews]', [[BTNG-RBHC]], 1990, 1-2 pp.110-124 p.110 n.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hilbergs settled in [[Brooklyn, New York]], where Raul attended [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] and [[Brooklyn College]]. He intended to make a career in [[chemistry]], but he found that it did not suit him, and he left his studies to work in a factory. Having reached draft age, he was then called up for military service. As early as 1942, Hilberg, after reading scattered reports of what would later become known as the Nazi genocide, went so far as to ring [[Stephen Wise]] and ask him what he planned to do with regard to "the complete annihilation of European Jewry". According to Hilberg, Wise hung up.&lt;ref name=popper /&gt;

Hilberg served first in the [[45th Infantry Division (United States)]] during [[World War II]], but, given his native fluency and academic interests, he was soon attached to the ''War Documentation Department'', charged with examining archives throughout Europe. While quartered in the [[Brown House, Munich, Germany|Braunes Haus]], he stumbled upon Hitler's crated private library in Munich. This discovery prompted Hilberg's research into the Holocaust, a term which he personally disliked,&lt;ref name=Times&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2217692.ece "Raul Hilberg"], ''The Times'', (London), August 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; though in later years he himself used it.&lt;ref&gt;In a recent lecture in Vienna he is on record as saying,'We know perhaps 20 per cent about the Holocaust,' Times Obituary ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic career ===
After returning to civilian life, Hilberg chose to study [[political science]], earning his B.A. at [[Brooklyn College]] in 1948. He was deeply impressed by the importance of [[elite]]s and [[bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] while attending [[Hans Rosenberg]]'s lectures on the [[Prussia]]n [[civil service]]. At one particular point in Rosenberg's course, Hilberg was taken aback by a remark his teacher dropped:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most wicked atrocities perpetrated on a civilian population in modern times occurred during the Napoleonic occupation of Spain.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The young Hilberg interrupted the lecture to ask why the recent murder of 6 million Jews did not figure in Rosenberg's assessment. Rosenberg replied that it was a complicated matter, but that the lectures only dealt with history down to 1930, adding, "History doesn't reach down into the present age." Hilberg was amazed by this highly educated, German-Jewish emigrant passing over the [[genocide]] of European Jews in order to expound on [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and [[Peninsular War|the occupation of Spain]]. The episode served to strengthen his interest in the subject.&lt;ref name=GA&gt;[[:de:wiki|Götz Aly]], [http://www.nzz.ch/nachrichten/startseite/article8kag6_1.445521.html "Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg"], in [[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]], 10 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilberg went on to first complete an M.A. (1950), and then a Ph.D (1955), at [[Columbia University]],&lt;ref name=IHT&gt;[[Associated Press]], [http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/08/06/america/NA-GEN-US-Obit-Hilberg.php "Holocaust Scholar Raul Hilberg dies at 81"], ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', August 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; where he entered the graduate program in Public Law and Government. Meanwhile, in 1951, he obtained a temporary appointment to work on the ''War Documentation Project'' under the direction of [[Fritz T. Epstein]].

Hilberg was undecided under whom he should carry out his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] research. Having attended a course on [[International Law]], he was also attracted to the lectures of [[Salo Baron]], the leading authority on Jewish [[historiography]] at the time, with particular expertise in the field of laws pertaining to the Jewish people. According to Hilberg, to attend Baron's lectures was to enjoy the rare opportunity of observing "a walking library, a monument of incredible erudition", active before his classroom of students. Baron asked Hilberg whether he was interested in working under him on the annihilation of Europe's Jewish population. Hilberg demurred on the grounds that his interest lay in the ''perpetrators,'' and thus he would not begin with the Jews who were their victims, but rather with what was done to them.&lt;ref name=GA/&gt;

Hilberg decided to write the greater part of his Ph.D. under the supervision of [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]], the author of an influential wartime analysis of the [[Nazi Germany|German totalitarian state]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Franz Leopold Neumann]], [[Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism|Behemoth: ''The Structure and Practice of National Socialism, 1933 - 1944'',]] Octagon Books, New York 1944&lt;/ref&gt; Neumann was initially reluctant to take Hilberg on as his doctoral student. He had already read Hilberg's master's thesis, and found, as both a deeply patriotic German and a Jew, that certain themes sketched there were unbearably painful. In particular he had asked that the section on Jewish cooperation be removed, to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;"«Streichen Sie das!» – «Stimmt das nicht?», entgegnete ich. Darauf er: «Nein, too much to take – das ist zu viel." Götz Aly, "Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg", ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Neumann nonetheless relented, warning his student, however, that such a dissertation was professionally imprudent and might well prove to be his academic funeral.&lt;ref name=popper /&gt; Undeterred by the prospect, Hilberg pressed on without regard for the possible consequences.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Douglas Martin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/us/07hilberg.html "Raul Hilberg: Historian Who Wrote of the Holocaust as a Bureaucracy, Dies"], ''The New York Times'', August 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Neumann himself contacted [[Nuremberg Tribunal|Nuremberg]] prosecutor [[Telford Taylor]] directly, to facilitate Hilberg's access to the appropriate archives. After Neumann's death in a traffic accident in 1954, Hilberg completed his doctoral requirement under the supervision of Professor [[William T. R. Fox]]. His dissertation won him the university's prestigious Clark F. Ansley Award in 1955, which carried with it the right to have his thesis published by his [[alma mater]].&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J.Berger, ''Fathoming the Holocaust: A Social Problems Approach,'' Aldine Transaction, 2002 p.148.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught the first college-level course in the United States dedicated to the Holocaust, when the subject was finally introduced into his university's curriculum in 1974.&lt;ref name=popper /&gt;

Hilberg obtained his first academic position at the [[University of Vermont]] in [[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington]], in 1955, and took up residence there in January 1956. Most of his teaching career was spent at that university, where he was a member of the Department of [[political science|Political Science]]. He was appointed [[emeritus professor]] upon his retirement in 1991. In 2006, the university established the Raul Hilberg Distinguished Professorship of Holocaust Studies. Each year the University of Vermont's Carolyn and Leonard Miller Center for Holocaust Studies hosts the Raul Hilberg Memorial Lecture, which is made possible through a generous gift from Jerold D. Jacobson, Esquire, of New York City, UVM Class of 1962.[http://www.uvm.edu/~uvmchs/]

=== Personal life ===
Hilberg had two children, David and Deborah, by his first wife, Christine Hemenway. After his divorce, in 1980 he married Gwendolyn Montgomery. Deborah moved to Israel when she was 18, assumed dual citizenship, and became a specialist  teacher of children with [[Learning disability|learning disabilities]]. She has written memorably of her father's approach to rearing in an article composed on the occasion of the publication of the Hebrew translation of his masterpiece, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Hilberg, [http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/my-father-the-holocaust-scholar-the-man-whose-message-israelis-wouldn-t-hear.premium-1.483037 My father, the Holocaust scholar; the man whose message Israelis wouldn't hear,'] at [[Haaretz]] 6 December 2012
&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilberg was not religious, and he considered himself an [[atheism|atheist]]. In his autobiographical reflections he stated, "The fact is that I have had no God."&lt;ref&gt;Raul Hilberg, ''The Politics of Memory: The Journey of a Holocaust Historian,'' Chicago: Ivan R. Dee; 1996, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 interview that addressed the issue of [[Holocaust denial]], he said, "I am an atheist. But there is ultimately, if you don't want to surrender to nihilism entirely, the matter of a [historical] record."&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,4150203-101750,00.html "The war on truth"], by DD Guttenplan, ''[[The Guardian]]'', March 12, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; After his second wife's autonomous decision, 12 years into their marriage, to convert from [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalianism]] to [[Judaism]], in 1993, Hilberg began quietly to attend services at [[Ohavi Zedek]], a Conservative synagogue in Burlington.  What he most esteemed, and identified with in his own tradition, was the ideal of the Jew as 'pariah'. As he put it in a 1965 essay, "Jews are iconoclasts. They will not worship idols... The Jews are the conscience of the world. They are the father figures, stern, critical, and forbidding."&lt;ref name=popper /&gt;

Hilberg was the only scholar interviewed for [[Claude Lanzmann]]'s ''[[Shoah (film)|Shoah]]'', and according to Guy Austin he was "a key influence on Lanzmann" in depicting the logistics of the genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Guy. ''Contemporary French Cinema: An Introduction''. Manchester University Press, 1996. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a strong supporter of [[Norman Finkelstein]] during the latter's [[Dershowitz–Finkelstein affair|controversial tenure battle]], and of Finkelstein's book ''[[The Holocaust Industry]]'', which he endorsed "with specific regard" to Finkelstein's work showing that the money claimed to be owed by Swiss banks to Holocaust survivors was greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/5/9/it_takes_an_enormous_amount_of |title="It Takes an Enormous Amount of Courage to Speak the Truth When No One Else is Out There"—World-Renowned Holocaust, Israel Scholars Defend DePaul Professor Norman Finkelstein as He Fights for Tenure |author= |date=May 9, 2007 |work=Democracy Now! |publisher=Pacifica Radio |accessdate=6 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hilberg also made a posthumous appearance in the 2009 film, ''[[American Radical: The Trials of Norman Finkelstein]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Susan Ryan |year=2010 |title=American Radical: The Trials of Norman Finkelstein |journal=Cineaste |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=60–61 |publisher=Cineaste Publishers |url=http://www.americanradicalthefilm.com/documents/AmericanRadical_Cineaste_Review.pdf |accessdate=6 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707133129/http://www.americanradicalthefilm.com/documents/AmericanRadical_Cineaste_Review.pdf |archivedate=7 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Destruction of the European Jews'' ==
{{main|The Destruction of the European Jews}}

Hilberg is best known for his influential study of the Holocaust, ''The Destruction of the European Jews''. His approach assumed that the event of the Shoah was not "unique". He said in a late interview:&lt;blockquote&gt;'For me the Holocaust was a vast, single event,  but I am never going to use the word ''unique'', because I recognize that when one starts breaking it into pieces, which is my trade, one finds completely recognizable, ordinary ingredients.'&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brown, 'A Holocaust Historian and His "Thirty-year War": Hilberg's Controversial Persona,' in Adam Brown, [https://books.google.it/books?id=wXoKAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 Judging 'Privileged' Jews: Holocaust Ethics, Representation, and the 'Grey Zone','] Berghahn Books, 2013 pp.94-108, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;His final doctoral supervisor, Professor Fox, worried that the original study was far too long. Hilberg therefore suggested submitting a mere quarter of the research he had written up, and his proposal was accepted. His PhD dissertation was awarded the prestigious Clark F. Ansley prize, which entitled it to be published by [[Columbia University Press]] in a print run of 850 copies.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Berger, ''Fathoming the Holocaust: A Social Problems Approach,'' Aldine Transaction, 2002, p.148&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hilberg was firm in desiring that the whole work be published, not just the doctoral version. To obtain this, two opinions in favor of full publication were required. [[Yad Vashem]] as early as 1958, declined to participate in its projected publication, fearing that it would encounter "hostile criticism".&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brown, ibid.p.96.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was duly submitted to two additional academic authorities in the field, but both judgments were negative, viewing Hilberg's work as [[polemic]]al: one rejected it as anti-German, the other as anti-Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Götz Aly, 'Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg ', ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Struggle for publication ===

Hilberg, unwilling to compromise, submitted the complete manuscript to several major publishing houses over the following six years, without luck. [[Princeton University Press]] turned down the manuscript, on [[Hannah Arendt]]'s advice, after quickly vetting it in a mere two weeks. After successive rejections from five prominent publishers, it finally went to press in 1961 under a minor imprint, the Chicago-based publisher, [[Times Books|Quadrangle Books]]. By good fortune, a wealthy patron, Frank Petschek, a [[List of Czech and Slovak Jews|German-Czech Jew]] whose family coal business had suffered from the Nazi [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] program,&lt;ref&gt;Harold James, 'Schwere moralische Schuld,', in ''Die Zeit'' September, 1995 {{cite web |url=http://images.zeit.de/text/1995/09/Schwere_moralische_Schuld |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612203909/http://images.zeit.de/text/1995/09/Schwere_moralische_Schuld |archivedate=2008-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; laid out $15,000, a substantial sum at the time, to cover the costs of a print run of 5,500 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;Götz Aly, 'Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg ', ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; of which some 1,300 copies were set aside for distribution to libraries.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

Resistance to Hilberg's work, the difficulties he encountered in finding a U.S. editor, and subsequent delays with the German edition, owed much to the [[Cold War]] atmosphere of the times.  [[Norman Finkelstein]] observed,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is hard now to remember that the Nazi holocaust was once a taboo subject. During the early years of the Cold War, mention of the Nazi holocaust was seen as undermining the critical U.S.-West German alliance. It was airing the dirty laundry of the barely de-Nazified West German elites and thereby playing into the hands of the Soviet Union, which didn't tire of remembering the crimes of the West German "revanchists."&lt;ref name=CP&gt;[[Norman Finkelstein]], [http://www.counterpunch.org/finkelstein08222007.html "Remembering Raul Hilberg"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915040640/http://www.counterpunch.org/finkelstein08222007.html |date=2007-09-15 }}, ''[[CounterPunch]]'', August 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The German rights to the book were acquired by the German publishing firm, Droemer Knaur, in 1963. Droemer Knaur, however, after dithering over it for two years, decided against publication, due to the work's documentation of certain episodes of cooperation by Jewish authorities with the executors of the Holocaust — material which the editors said would only play into the hands of the [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[right wing]] in Germany. Hilberg dismissed this fear as "nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Götz Aly, 'Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg ', ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; Some two decades were to pass before it finally came out in a German edition in 1982, under the imprint of a Berlin publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;Raul Hilberg,''Die Vernichtung der europäischen Juden,'' ed. Ulf Wolter, tr. Christian Seeger, Olle &amp; Wolter, Berlin 1982&lt;/ref&gt; Hilberg, a lifelong [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] voter,&lt;ref name=neumann&gt;{{Citation|last=Neumann |first=Michael |author-link=Michael Neumann |title=In Memoriam: Raul Hilberg |newspaper=[[CounterPunch]] |date=2007-08-15 |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann08152007.html |accessdate=2010-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822060728/http://www.counterpunch.org/neumann08152007.html |archivedate=2009-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; seemed to be somewhat bemused by the prospect of being published under such an imprint, and asked its director, Ulf Wolter, what on earth his massive treatise on the Holocaust had in common with some of the firm's staple themes, [[socialism]] and [[women's rights]]. Wolter replied succinctly: "Injustice!"&lt;ref&gt;Götz Aly, 'Geschichte reicht in die Gegenwart Ein Gespräch mit dem Historiker Raul Hilberg ', ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter of July 14, 1982 Hilberg had written to Mr. Wolter/Olle &amp; Wolter, "Everything you said to me during this brief visit has impressed me very much and has given me a good feeling about our joint venture. I am glad that you are my publisher in Germany." He spoke about a "second edition" of his work, "solid enough for the next century".

=== Approach and structure of book ===
''The Destruction of the European Jews'' provided, in [[Hannah Arendt]]'s words, "the first clear description of (the) incredibly complicated machinery of destruction" set up under Nazism.&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Arendt,''Eichmann in Jerusalem''(1963) rev.ed.1964 p.71&lt;/ref&gt; For Hilberg there was deep irony in the judgment since Arendt, asked to give an opinion of his manuscript in 1959, had advised against publication.&lt;ref name=popper /&gt; Her judgement influenced the rejection slip he received from Princeton University Press following its submission, thus effectively denying him the prestigious auspices of a mainstream academic publishing house.

With a terse lucidity that ranged, with unsparing meticulousness, over the huge archives of Nazism, Hilberg delineated the history of the mechanisms, political, legal, administrative and organizational, whereby the Holocaust was perpetrated, as it was seen through German eyes, often by the anonymous clerks whose unquestioning dedication to their duties was central to the efficacy of the industrial project of genocide. To that end, Hilberg refrained from laying emphasis on the suffering of Jews, the victims, or their lives in the concentration camps. The Nazi program entailed the destruction of all peoples whose existence was deemed incompatible with the world-historical destiny of a pure master race – and to accomplish this project, they had to develop techniques, muster resources, make bureaucratic decisions, organize fields and camps of extermination and recruit cadres capable of executing the ''[[Final Solution]]''. It was enough to chase down each intricate strand of communication over how to conduct the operation efficiently through the enormous archival papertrail to show how this took place. Thus his discourse probed the bureaucratic means for implementing genocide, in order to let the implicit horror of the process speak for itself.&lt;ref&gt;Raul Hilberg, ''The Destruction of the European Jews'' (1961) 1973 Preface p.v&lt;/ref&gt; In this he differed radically from those who had focused heavily on final responsibilities, as for example in the case of predecessor [[Gerald Reitlinger]]'s groundbreaking history of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gerald Reitlinger]],''The Final Solution'',1953&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this layered departmentalized structure of the bureaucracy overseeing the intricate policies of classifying, mustering and deporting victims, individual functionaries saw their roles as distinct from the actual 'perpetration' of the Holocaust. Thus,'(f)or these reasons, an administrator, clerk or uniformed guard never referred to himself as a perpetrator.'&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Hilberg made it clear, however, that such functionaries were quite aware of their involvement in what was a process of destruction.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Hilberg's minute documentation thus constructed a functional analysis of the machinery of genocide, while leaving unaddressed any questions of historical antisemitism, and possible structural elements in Germany's historical-social tradition which might have conduced to the unparalleled industrialization of the European Jewish Catastrophe by that country. [[Yehuda Bauer]], a lifelong adversary and friend of Hilberg, who often clashed polemically with the man he considered 'without fault' over what Bauer saw as the latter's failure to deal with the complex dilemmas of Jews caught up in this machinery, recalls often prodding Hilberg on his exclusive focus on the ''how'' of the Holocaust rather than the ''why''. According to Bauer, Hilberg "did not ask the big questions for fear that the answers would be too little"&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Bauer  | first = Yehuda  | author-link = Yehuda Bauer  | title = A human being without fault  | newspaper = [[Haaretz]]  | date = 2007-10-02  | url = https://www.haaretz.com/1.4978625 | accessdate = 2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, as Hilberg himself says interviewed in Lanzmann's film, "I have never begun by asking the big questions, because I was always afraid that I would come up with small answers."

Hilberg's empirical, descriptive approach to the Holocaust, though it exercised a not fully acknowledged but pervasive influence on the far better-known work of [[Hannah Arendt]], ''[[Eichmann in Jerusalem]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hilberg counted up to 80 passages in Arendt's book taken verbatim or indirectly from his own work. In reviewing her book, [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] concluded that "behind the whole of Miss Arendt's book stands the overshadowing bulk of Mr. Hilberg's". See [https://www.thenation.com/article/conscious-pariah/ Nathaniel Popper, "A Conscious Pariah"], in [[The Nation]], March 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; in turn aroused considerable controversy, not least because of its details concerning the cooperation of Jewish councils in the actual procedures of evacuation to the camps.

=== Critical reception ===
At the time, most historians of the phenomenon subscribed to what would today be called the extreme intentionalist position, where sometime early in his career, Hitler developed a master plan for the [[genocide]] of the Jewish people and that everything that happened was the unfolding of the plan. This clashed with the lesson Hilberg had absorbed under Neumann, whose ''Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of National Socialism'' (1942) described the Nazi regime as a virtually stateless political order characterised by chronic bureaucratic infighting and turf disputes. The task Hilberg set for himself was to analyse the way the overall policies of genocide were engineered within the otherwise conflictual politics of Nazi factions. It helped that the Americans classifying the huge amount of Nazi documents used, precisely, the categories his future mentor Neumann had employed in his ''Behemoth'' study.&lt;ref name = neumann/&gt;

Hilberg came to be considered as the foremost representative of what a later generation has called the [[Functionalism versus intentionalism|functionalist]] school of Holocaust [[historiography]], of which [[Christopher Browning]], whose own life was changed by reading Hilberg's book,&lt;ref&gt;'He read it during a long convalescence from [[mononucleosis]], and it changed his life. "Some people have religious conversion experiences," Browning said at a memorial service for Hilberg; "upon reading Hilberg I had a life-changing academic conversion experience".' Cited [http://www.thenation.com/article/conscious-pariah Nathaniel Popper, 'A Conscious Pariah: On Raul Hilberg,'] April 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is a prominent member. The debate is that Intentionalists see "the Holocaust as Hitler's determined and premeditated plan, which he implemented as the opportunity arose",&lt;ref name="Indiana University Press"&gt;{{cite book| page=4 |title=The Holocaust and History: The Known, the Unknown, the Disputed, and the Reexamined | editor1-last=Berenbaum |editor1-first= Michael | editor2-last= Peck |editor2-first=Abraham J. |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana | year=1998 | isbn = 0-253-33374-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while functionalists see "the Final Solution as an evolution that occurred when other plans proved untenable".&lt;ref name="Indiana University Press"/&gt; Intentionalists argue that the initiative for the Holocaust came from above, while functionalists contend it came from lower ranks within the bureaucracy.

It has often been observed that Hilberg's ''magnum opus'' begins with an intentionalist thesis but gradually shifts towards a functionalist position. At the time, this approach raised a few eyebrows but only later did it actually attract pointed academic discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page=24 |chapter= The Holocaust: Where We Are, Where We Need to Go| last=Jäckel |first=Eberhard |title=The Holocaust and History: The Known, the Unknown, the Disputed, and the Reexamined | editor1-last=Berenbaum |editor1-first= Michael | editor2-last= Peck |editor2-first=Abraham J. |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana | year=1998 | isbn = 0-253-33374-1| quote=While in the 1960s and 1970s the stream of historical publications grew steadily, there was still almost no scholarly debate on the Holocaust.  Hilberg certainly had sparked a stormy controversy, which was particularly vehement in Israel but his interpretation, derived from Franz Neumann, was not discussed profoundly by his fellow historians}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A further move towards a functionalist interpretation occurred in the revised 1985 edition, in which Hitler is portrayed as a remote figure hardly involved in the machinery of destruction. The terms "functionalist" and "intentionalist" were coined in 1981 by [[Timothy Mason]] but the debate goes back to 1969 with the publication of [[Martin Broszat]]'s ''The Hitler State'' in 1969 and [[Karl Schleunes]]'s ''The Twisted Road to Auschwitz'' in 1970. Since most of the early functionalist historians were West German, it was often enough for intentionalist historians, especially for those outside Germany, to note that men such as Broszat and [[Hans Mommsen]] had spent their adolescence in the [[Hitler Youth]] and then to say that their work was an [[apologia]] for [[Nazism|National Socialism]]. Hilberg was Jewish and an Austrian who had fled to the United States to escape the Nazis and had no Nazi sympathies, which helps to explain the vehemence of the attacks by intentionalist historians that greeted the revised edition of ''The Destruction of the European Jews'' in 1985. &lt;!--Although I can see what's being said here, it's not clear to someone not familiar with these terms why intentionalists could attack the early functionalists as apologists for National Socialism. [It's because intentionalists are part of the propaganda of zionism].--&gt;

Hilberg's understanding of the relationship between the leadership of the [[Third Reich]] and the implementers of the genocide evolved from an interpretation based on orders to the [[RSHA]] originating with [[Adolf Hitler]] and proclaimed by [[Hermann Göring]], to a thesis consistent with [[Christopher Browning]]'s ''The Origins of the Final Solution'', an account in which initiatives were undertaken by mid-level officials in response to general orders from senior ones. Such initiatives were broadened by mandates from senior officials and propagated by increasingly informal channels. The experience gained in fulfilling the initiatives fed an understanding in the bureaucracy that radical goals were attainable, progressively reducing the need for direction. As Hilberg put it in a late interview:

{{quote|As the Nazi regime developed over the years, the whole structure of decision-making was changed. At first there were laws. Then there were decrees implementing laws. Then a law was made saying, "There shall be no laws." Then there were orders and directives that were written down, but still published in ministerial gazettes. Then there was government by announcement; orders appeared in newspapers. Then there were the quiet orders, the orders that were not published, that were within the bureaucracy, that were oral. Finally, there were no orders at all. Everybody knew what he had to do.&lt;ref&gt;Simone Schweber, Debbie Findling, [https://books.google.it/books?id=mco3ldVWNL8C&amp;pg=PT185  ''Teaching the Holocaust,''] Torah Aura Productions  2007 p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In earlier editions of ''Destruction'', in fact, Hilberg discussed an "order" given by Hitler to have Jews killed, while more recent editions do not refer to a direct command. Hilberg later commented that he "made this change in the interest of precision about the evidence [...]." Notwithstanding Hilberg's focus on bureaucratic momentum as an indispensable force behind the Holocaust, he maintained that extermination of Jews was one of Hitler's aims: "The primary notion in Germany is that Hitler did it. As it happens, this is also my notion, but I'm not wedded to it" (qtd. in Guttenplan, p.&amp;nbsp;303).

This contradicts the thesis advanced by [[Daniel Goldhagen]] that the ferocity of German [[anti-Semitism]] is sufficient as an explanation for the Holocaust; Hilberg noted that anti-Semitism was more virulent in Eastern Europe than in the [[Third Reich]] itself. Hilberg criticized Goldhagen's scholarship, which he called poor ("his scholarly standard is at the level of 1946") and he was even harsher concerning the lack of primary source or secondary literature competence at Harvard by those who oversaw the research for Goldhagen's book. Hilberg said, "This is the only reason why Goldhagen could obtain a PhD in political science at Harvard. There was nobody on the faculty who could have checked his work." This remark has been echoed by Yehuda Bauer.

What is most contentious about Hilberg's work, the controversial implications of which influenced the decision by Israeli authorities to deny him access to the [[Yad Vashem]]'s archives,&lt;ref name=Times/&gt; was his assessment that elements of Jewish society, such as the ''[[Judenräte]]'' (Jewish Councils), were complicit in the genocide.&lt;ref&gt;"The Germans controlled the Jewish leadership, and that leadership in turn controlled the Jewish community. This system was foolproof. Truly, the Jewish communal organizations had become a self-destructive machine." Raul Hilberg, ''The Destruction of the European Jews,'' (1961) 1973 pp 122-125, p.125&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In Amsterdam as in Warsaw, in Berlin as in Budapest, Jewish officials could be trusted to compile the lists of persons and of their property, to secure money from the deportees to defray the expenses of their deportation and extermination, to keep track of vacated apartments, to supply police forces to help seize Jews and get them on trains, until, as a last gesture, they handed over the assets of the Jewish community in good order for final confiscation." [[Hannah Arendt]], ''Eichmann in Jerusalem'' (1963) 1964 p.118&lt;/ref&gt; and that this was partly rooted in long-standing attitudes of European Jews, rather than attempts at survival or exploitation. In his own words:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I had to examine the Jewish tradition of trusting God, princes, laws and contracts [...] Ultimately I had to ponder the Jewish calculation that the persecutor would not destroy what he could economically exploit. It was precisely this Jewish strategy that dictated accommodation and precluded resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Raul Hilberg, ''The politics of memory'', pp. 126-127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This part of his work was criticized harshly by many Jews as impious, and a defamation of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald J. Berger, [https://books.google.it/books?id=WRFG-HKoBgEC&amp;pg=PA153  ''Fathoming the Holocaust: A Social Problems Approach,''] Aldine de Gruyter, New York 2002 p.153.&lt;/ref&gt; His master's thesis sponsor persuaded him to remove this idea from his thesis, though he was determined to restore it. Even his father, on reading his manuscript, was disconcerted.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brown, ibid. p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result of his approach, and the sharp criticism it aroused in certain quarters, was such, as he records in the same book, that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It has taken me some time to absorb what I should always have known, that in my whole approach to the study of the destruction of the Jews I was pitting myself against the main current of Jewish thought [...] that in my research and writing I was pursuing not merely another direction but one which was the exact opposite of a signal that pulsated endlessly through the Jewish community [...] The philistines in my field are everywhere. I am surrounded by the commonplace, platitudes, and clichés.&lt;ref name=Times/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adam Brown p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to various polls, the majority of [[Kazakhstan]]'s citizens, primarily ethnic [[Kazakhs]], identify as [[non-denominational Muslim]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewforum.org/2012/08/09/the-worlds-muslims-unity-and-diversity-1-religious-affiliation/#identity&lt;/ref&gt;, while others incline towards [[Sunni]] of the [[Hanafi]] school, traditionally including ethnic Kazakhs, who constitute about 63.6% of the population, as well as ethnic Uzbeks, Uighurs, and Tatars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.kz/p_perepis/Pages/n_04_02_10.aspx |title=Итоги переписи населения Республики Казахстан 2009 года |accessdate=2010-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628101359/http://www.stat.kz/p_perepis/Pages/n_04_02_10.aspx |archivedate=June 28, 2010 |df= }}. stat.kz. 4 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IRFR"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2010/148793.htm Kazakhstan – International Religious Freedom Report 2010] U.S. Department of State.

The country is multiethnic, with a long tradition of tolerance and secularism.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Since independence, the number of mosques and churches has increased greatly.&lt;ref name="IRFR" /&gt; However, the population is sometimes wary of minority religious groups and groups that proselytize.&lt;ref name="IRFR" /&gt; There were several reports of citizens filing complaints with authorities after their family members became involved with such groups.&lt;ref name="IRFR" /&gt; Leaders of the four religious groups the government considers "traditional" – Islam, Russian Orthodoxy, Catholicism, and Judaism – reported general acceptance and tolerance that other religious groups did not always enjoy.&lt;ref name="IRFR" /&gt;

==Religious history==

[[File:Church of the East in the Middle Ages.svg|thumb|right|[[Church of the East]] and its largest extent during the Middle Ages.]]

The country has historically hosted a wide variety of ethnic groups with varying religions. Intolerance to other societies has become an issue of the Kazakh culture. The foundation of an independent republic, following the disintegration of the USSR, has launched a great deal of changes in every aspect of people's lives. Religiosity of the population, as an essential part of any cultural identity, has undergone dynamic transformations as well.

Baptist Churches are often raided. This is due to the church members gathering without registering themselves, a requirement of the country. Anyone who does not register risk being raided by the police. However not only those that violate the law are treated harshly. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.opendoorsusa.org/take-action/pray/raids-churches-kazakhstan/&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 2, 2017, a court in the capital of Astana, Kazakhstan, sentenced a 61 year old husband and father of three sons, to a five-year prison sentence for performing peaceful Bible education work. Teymur Akhmedov, is a member of Jehovah's Witnesses. The court called his preaching and teaching efforts “inciting religious discord” and “advocating [religious] superiority.” In addition, the judge also imposed a three-year ban on Mr. Akhmedov’s participation in Bible education activities. Mr Akhmedo's medical issues were not considered, as he requires treatment for a bleeding tumor and has been denied the medical attention that he requires. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.jw.org/en/news/releases/by-region/kazakhstan/imprisons-ailing-jehovahs-witness-bans-his-worship/&lt;/ref&gt;

After decades of suppressed culture, the people were feeling a great need to exhibit their ethnic identity – in part through religion. Quantitative research shows that for the first years after the establishment of the new laws, waiving any restrictions on religious beliefs and proclaiming full freedom of confessions, the country experienced a huge spike in religious activity of its citizens. Hundreds of mosques, synagogues, churches, and other religious structures were built in a matter of years. All represented religions benefited from increased number of members and facilities. Many confessions that were absent before independence made their way into the country, appealing to hundreds of people. The government supported this activity, and has done its best to provide equality among all religious organizations and their followers. In the late 1990s, however, a slight decline in religiosity occurred.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The draft religion law being considered in June 2008 has raised international concern over whether there is an intention to meet general standards of freedom of religion and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=1141|title=KAZAKHSTAN: Restrictive draft Religion Law to reach full parliament tomorrow|last=Bayram|first=Mushfig|date=2008-06-10|publisher=Forum 18|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christianity in Kazakhstan is the second most practiced religion after [[Islam]]. Most Christian citizens are [[Russians]], and to a lesser extent [[Ukrainians]] and [[Belarusians]], who belong to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. According to a 2009 national census, approximately 26% of the population of Kazakhstan identifies as Christian.&lt;ref name="2009 Census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.stat.kz/news/Pages/n1_12_11_10.aspx|title=The results of the national population census in 2009|date=12 November 2010|publisher=Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan|accessdate=13 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722142449/http://www.eng.stat.kz/news/Pages/n1_12_11_10.aspx|archivedate=22 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1.5 percent of the population is [[Germans|German]], most of whom follow [[Catholicism]] or [[Lutheranism]].

===Bahá'í Faith===
{{main|Bahá'í Faith in Kazakhstan}}
The Bahá'í Faith in Kazakhstan began during the [[Religion in the Soviet Union#Policy toward religions in practice|policy of oppression]] of religion in the former [[Soviet Union]]. Before that time, [[Kazakhstan]], as part of the [[Russian Empire]], would have had indirect contact with the [[Bahá'í Faith]] as far back as 1847.&lt;ref name="russia"&gt;{{cite web | last = Momen | first = Moojan | title = Russia  | work = Draft for "A Short Encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith" | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | date =  | url = http://bahai-library.com/momen_encyclopedia_russia | accessdate = 2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the entrance of [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] the community grew to be the largest religious community after Islam and Christianity, though only a few percent of the nation.&lt;ref name="census"&gt;{{cite web

{{main|Kazakh Jews}}

[[File:Stamp of Kazakhstan 565.jpg|thumb|Chabad-Lubavitch synagogue in Almaty, depicted on a postage stamp from Kazakhstan in 2006.|184x184px]]
Kazakh Jews have a long history. There are approximately 12,000 to 30,000 [[Jew]]s in [[Kazakhstan]], less than 1% of the population. Most Kazakh Jews are [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and speak [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref name="REPORT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ORECK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Kazakhstan.html|title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour – Kazakhstan|last=Oreck|first=Alden|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{main|Hinduism in Kazakhstan}}

[[Hindus]] in [[Kazakhstan]] are mainly of the [[ISKCON]] sect and by Diaspora Hindus from India. The Indian community in Central Asia, which comprises Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, numbers only 2732 out of a total population of 55.5 million. It consists mainly of NRIs.

===Pagan ===
*[[Slavic Neopaganism]]

=== Tengrism ===
{{main article|Tengrism}}

Tengrism is a [[Central Asia]]n [[Central Asia#Religions|religion]] characterized by [[shamanism]], [[animism]], [[totemism]], [[Polytheism|poly-]] and [[monotheism]] and [[ancestor worship]]. It was the prevailing religion of the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Mongols]], [[Hungarians]], [[Xiongnu]] and [[Huns]], and the religion of the five ancient Turkic states: [[Turkic Khaganate|Göktürk Khaganate]], [[Western Turkic Khaganate]], [[Old Great Bulgaria|Great Bulgaria]], [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] and [[Khazaria|Eastern Tourkia (Khazaria)]]. In ''[[Irk Bitig]]'', Tengri is mentioned as ''Türük Tängrisi'' (God of Turks).

Tengrists view their existence as sustained by the eternal blue sky (Tengri), the fertile mother-earth spirit ([[Eje (goddess)|Eje]]) and a ruler regarded as the holy spirit of the sky. Heaven, earth, spirits of nature and ancestors provide for every need and protect all humans. By living an upright, respectful life, a human will keep his world in balance and perfect his personal [[Wind Horse]], or spirit. The Huns of the northern Caucasus reportedly believed in two gods: Tangri Han (or Tengri Khan), considered identical to the Persian [[Esfandiyār|Aspandiat]] and for whom horses were sacrificed, and Kuar (whose victims are struck by lightning). Tengrism is practised in [[Sakha Republic|Sakha]], [[Republic of Buryatia|Buryatia]], [[Tuva]] and [[Mongolia]] in parallel with [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Burkhanism]].

==Freedom of religion and religious tolerance==
{{main|Human rights in Kazakhstan}}
{{main|Irreligion in Kazakhstan}}
Kazakhstan has a very diverse and stable religious background. However, some reported occurrences of persecution against Hare Krishnas and Jehovah's Witnesses for proselytizing have raised concern in the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=939|title=KAZAKHSTAN: Officially-inspired intolerance of religious freedom steps up |last=Corley|first=Felix|date=2007-04-03|publisher=Forum 18|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forum18.org/Archive.php?article_id=895|title=KAZAKHSTAN: More Hare Krishna home demolitions planned?|last=Corley|first=Felix|date=2006-12-06|publisher=Forum 18|accessdate=2009-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaceofthesoul.com/news/index.php?article_id=38 Palace of the Soul: Project Updates&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320021128/http://www.palaceofthesoul.com/news/index.php?article_id=38 |date=2008-03-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Article 22 of the Constitution of the Republic of Kazakhstan states that "everyone has the right to a freedom of conscience.” On May 18, 2011, the President of Kazakhstan adopted a decree establishing the Agency for Religious Affairs. The mission of the Agency is to coordinate interaction between the government, religious groups and civil society in order to ensure religious freedom in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Affairs Agency Works to Protect Freedoms, Stop Extremist Ideologies|url=http://astanatimes.com/2013/07/religious-affairs-agency-works-to-protect-freedoms-stop-extremist-ideologies/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Kazakhstan established Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions that aims to facilitate religious dialogue ensuring inter-religious tolerance and freedom in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historic Potential of the Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional Religions|url=http://astanatimes.com/2013/09/historic-potential-of-the-congress-of-leaders-of-world-and-traditional-religions/|website=astanatimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first '''Shia theocracy''' in the 20th century was established in [[Iran]] following the [[Iranian Revolution]] that led to the fall of the [[Shah of Iran]].  The constitutional name of Iran was established as the Islamic Republic of Iran ({{lang-fa|جمهوری اسلامی ايران}} [[transliteration]]: ''Jomhuri-ye Eslāmi-ye Irān'').  [[Islam]] is the state religion of the country.

Under the post-revolution Iranian constitution of 1979, Iran is government first and foremost by the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]], who is responsible for the [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists|delineation and supervision]] of "the general policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran". The Supreme Leader is ''Commander-in-Chief'' of the armed forces, controls the military intelligence and security operations; and has sole power to declare war. The heads of the judiciary, state radio and television networks, the commanders of the police and military forces and six of the twelve members of the [[Council of Guardians]] are appointed by the Supreme Leader. The [[Assembly of Experts]] elects and dismisses the Supreme Leader on the basis of qualifications and popular esteem. [http://countrystudies.us/iran/81.htm] The Assembly of Experts is responsible for supervising the Supreme Leader in the performance of legal duties.

The Islamic government of Iran attempted to export its radical form of Shi`ite Islam to other Middle Eastern countries such as Lebanon which led to the creation of [[Hezbollah]].

The current Shi`ite controlled government in [[Iraq]] has been criticized for lacking a separation of religion and state. The current Shi`ite led government has also been criticized for being influenced by the Shi`ite clergy such as Grand [[Ayatollah Ali Sistani]].

The [[Ba'athist Iraq|Sunni dominated government]] of [[Saddam Hussein]] heavily suppressed the Shi`ite majority who was persecuted under his regime.

Critics have pointed out that some elements of the Shi`ite controlled government such as the current Iraqi Interior Ministry have actively persecuted Iraqi Sunni's much like Saddam Hussein's security forces did to the Shi`ite government. This Shi`ite vendeta has created an environment which has led to the growth of the Sunni insurgency leading to many civilian deaths.

'''Sister Abhaya''' (Born '''Beena Thomas''', Died: {{Death date and age|1992|03|27|1973|mf=yes}}), a [[Catholic]] [[Religious Sister|sister]], was found dead in a [[water well]] in [[Pope Pius X|St Pius X]] [[Convent]] in [[Kottayam]] on 27 March 1992.&lt;ref name="manorama-father-died"&gt;[http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/father-of-sister-abhaya-passes-away.html Father of Sister Abhaya passes away]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toi-confession"&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Abhaya-case-narco-tests-show-confession-of-priests-and-nun/articleshow/5011421.cms Abhaya case narco tests show confession of priests and nun]&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation into this death is by far the longest running murder investigation in the [[State of Kerala]].

The [[Kerala Police|local police]] which investigated the case initially closed it with a theory of [[suicide]]. The [[Crime Branch]] which took up the investigation later tried to strengthen the suicide theory, with claims of psychological illness of the deceased. On a writ petition, the [[High Court of Kerala]] transferred the investigation to the  [[Central Bureau of Investigation]]. The first team of [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] failed to find the reason of death. Upon the instruction of the court a second team was set up, which concluded that it was indeed a murder, but there were not enough evidence leading to the murderer(s). Court installed a third team of CBI, and they finally found two [[priest]]s and a sister responsible for the murder and arrested them on 19 November 2008.&lt;ref name="toi-confession" /&gt; On 17 July 2009, charges of murder, and destruction of evidence were filed against the three.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/Abhaya-case-Summons-to-three-accused/articleshow/55901746.cms Abhaya case: Summons to three accused]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/2017/03/28/sister-abhaya-murder-case-25-years-history.html Abhaya case: Wait for justice continues even after 25 years.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deccanchronicle.com/131219/news-current-affairs/article/kerala-hc-directs-cbi-conduct-further-investigation-sister Kerala HC directs CBI to conduct further investigation in Sister Abhaya case&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2009/mar/02sister-abhaya-case-haunts-investigators.htm Sister Abhaya case haunts investigators]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abhaya was a member of [[St. Joseph]]'s Congregation for [[Religious Sisters|religious sisters]] under the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam]], [[Kerala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kottayamad.org/sjc-congregation/|title=THE ARCHEPARCHY OF KOTTAYAM {{!}} Leading the Knanaya Community {{!}} SJC Congregation|website=kottayamad.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sister Abhaya was reported missing on the morning of 27 March 1992. She had woken at 4:00am to study for exams, and was last known to have gone to the kitchen for a drink. The refrigerator door was left ajar, a bottle of water was spilled on the floor and a single slipper sat under the fridge – its pair was found beside the convent hostel's well. After a brief search, Sister Abhaya's body was found in the convent hostel's well in the early hours of the same day. Kottayam West Police Station upgraded their investigation to that of an unnatural death.
At 10:00am the deceased was removed from the well by the fire force and an inquest was drawn up. A post-mortem conducted on the body by Dr Radhakrishnan of Kottayam Medical College found abrasions on the right shoulder and hip and two small lacerations above the right ear. There was no sign of sexual assault. Despite the potentially significant injuries, the death was ruled a drowning.

The series of inquiries by various investigating bodies that followed were lengthy, convoluted and unsatisfactory, plagued by internal conflict, bitter rivalries and allegations of corruption and bias, compounded by pressure from many quarters to bring the case to conclusion. In April 1992 the Crime Branch of the Criminal Investigation Department took up the case, and months later ruled Sister Abhaya's death a suicide. However, the Crime Branch was alleged to have destroyed crucial material evidence potentially implicating homicide as a cause of death.

In April 1995, forensic medical experts Dr S K Pathak, Dr Mahesh Verma and Dr. S R Singh conducted dummy experiments leading them to conclude that homicide could not be ruled out. Nevertheless, no arrests were made until November 2008. After years of failed investigations and internal struggles, two priests - Thomas Kottur, Jose Puthurukkayil and a nun - Sister Sephy - were arrested by the Crime Branch on 19 November 2008. All three suspects were granted bail in early January 2009. On 17 July 2009, the three were charged with murder, defamation and destruction of evidence. Prosecutors alleged that Sister Abhaya had stumbled upon the two priests and one sister in a "compromising position" and had subsequently been attacked with an axe and dumped in the well.

== Investigations ==

=== Action council ===
An Action Council was convened by [[Jomon Puthenpurackal]] in 1992 demanding prosecution of those responsible for the murder of Abhaya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/oct/26keral.htm |title=CBI bites dust in Sister Abhaya case |work=Redcliff On The Net |date=26 October 1998 |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1999/jul/13keral.htm?zcc=rl |title=CBI seeks closure of unresolved Sister Abhaya case |work=Redcliff On The Net |date=13 July 1999 |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

67 nuns belonging to Abhaya's congregation petitioned the Chief Minister of the Kerala State Government to investigate the case as a homicide.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 34"&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 34&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 April 1992, the Director General of Police of Kerala directed the [[Crime Branch]] of the [[Kerala Police]] to take over the investigation from the local police. The Kerala Government, on the basis of the petition, recommended a CBI enquiry. On 29 March 1993, CBI began a new investigation.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 34"/&gt;

=== Kerala Police ===
On 27 March 1992, Kottayam West Police Station ASI V V Augustine visited the crime scene and called the fire force to search for Abhaya's body in the well in the compound. The fire force took removed the body from the well. An inquest was prepared by ASI Augustine. Photographs of the body were also taken. Clothing of Abhaya was taken into custody. Later these items of physical evidence were destroyed. The post-mortem report indicated death by drowning but also reported on the possibility of homicide based on head injuries.

On 7 April 1992, the [[Director General of Police]] of Kerala directed the [[Crime Branch]] section of the Kerala police to take up the investigation. The Crime Branch submitted its report before the Revenue Divisional Officer (RDO) on 30 January 1993. The Crime Branch concluded that Abhaya had committed suicide.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} According to the post mortem report, she had died from drowning.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Though there were allegations that the Crime Branch had procured the evidence in the case from the court and destroyed it, this was subsequently disproved by the CBI.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

=== CBI ===
On 29 March 1993, the [[First Information Report]] (FIR) in the case was registered by the [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI).&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 34"/&gt; The CBI started investigating the death of Sister Abhaya under the direct supervision of its officer Varghese P. Thomas.

On 29 November 1996, the CBI issued the first final report.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 16"&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the report, A.K. Ohri, stated that he could not determine whether Abhaya's death was suicide or homicide.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 16"/&gt; The report was not accepted by the Chief Judicial Magistrate's Court.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 16"/&gt; On 9 July 1999, the CBI issued a second final report authored by Surinder Paul.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 17"&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Paul concluded that Abahya's death was a homicide, but he could not establish the identity of the perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 17"/&gt; Paul's report was also not accepted by the court.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 17"/&gt; On 25 August 2005, the CBI issued yet another report, authored by R.R. Sahay.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 18"&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Sahay concluded that there was no indication that anyone was involved in Abahya's death.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 18"/&gt; The report was again not accepted.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 18"/&gt; On 4 September 2008, the court turned the investigation over to the Kerala branch of the CBI.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 18"/&gt;

Some of the initial manipulations in the case by the local police and crime branch, alleged by CBI are:&lt;br /&gt;
-''The inquest report did not indicate the homicidal injuries on the body of Abhaya.''&lt;br /&gt;
-''The material evidence in the case was destroyed and the clothes were not subject to forensic examination''&lt;br /&gt;
-''The photographs showing injuries on the body were removed''.&lt;br /&gt;''
-''The crime scene was tampered with or material physical evidence was not collected from the crime scene. &lt;br /&gt;
During the initial inquiry, the post-mortem, chemical examination and [[laboratory]] report also had been erased and then rewritten due to other influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deccanherald.com/Content/Aug172007/national2007081619572.asp |title=Nun murder case: Narco tests in Blore |publisher=Deccan Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.webindia123.com/news/ar_showdetails.asp?id=710191062&amp;cat=&amp;n_date=20071019 |title=Plea on narco-analysis test report in Sister Abhaya case |publisher=WebIndia123.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://andhracafe.com/index.php?m=show&amp;id=21887 |title=Mystery over Kerala nun's death |publisher=Andhracafe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/070413/43/6ejev.html |title=Suicide or murder? Kerala nun's death in spotlight again  |publisher=Yahoo! India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 December 1993, Varghese P. Thomas resigned from the service of CBI and from the investigation of Abhaya's death. He had seven more years in service to retire. He had arrived at the conclusion that Abhaya's death was a case of murder and he had recorded it as such in the Case Diary. Subsequently, on 19 January 1994, he called a special press conference in [[Cochin]] and announced that he had resigned from CBI as his conscience did not permit him to comply with a strong directive given by his superior officer, V. Thyagarajan, the then Superintendent of CBI Cochin Unit, who had asked Varghese P. Thomas to record the death of Abhaya as suicide in the Case Diary. With this press conference, the case of Sr. Abhaya caught media attention all over [[India]] and the matter was strongly debated in the [[Parliament of India|parliament]] as well as in the Kerala state assembly on several occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/1998/oct/26keral.htm |title=CBI bites dust in Sister Abhaya case |publisher=Rediff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Writ Petition to Kerala High Court ===
The Action Council filed another Writ petition in the [[Kerala High Court]] asking the court to remove V. Thyagarajan from Cochin Unit of the CBI as well as from the investigation. Further on 3 June 1994 all the [[Member of Parliament|MP]]'s from Kerala State jointly submitted a passionate petition to K. Vijaya Rama Rao, the Director of the CBI requesting him to disallow Thyagarajan to continue in the Abhaya's murder case. As a result, M.L. Sharma, the Joint Director of the CBI, was given charge of the investigation into Abhaya's death.

== Cause of death ==
Dr C Radhakrishnan, the forensic surgeon and former Principal of Kottayam Medical College, who conducted the post-mortem on the body of the deceased Abhaya, had given the report as death by drowning. He later made a statement before the Magistrate on 1 January 2009. The crime branch did not allow him to visit the crime scene to form a definite opinion as to the cause of death. The explanation of the crime branch is that the case had been handed over to the state forensic chief Dr. Umadathan.
Dr. Radhakrishnan noted six homicidal injuries on the body of the deceased.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sr. Abhaya had the following ante-mortem injuries as per the post-mortem certificate issued by Dr. Radhakrishnan:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Lacerated    wound    1.8x0.5x0.2&amp;nbsp;cm., oblique, on the right side of the back of head, the upper end being 3&amp;nbsp;cm above end 3&amp;nbsp;cm behind the top of ear.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Lacerated  wound    1.5x0.5x0.3&amp;nbsp;cm, oblique, on the head 2.5&amp;nbsp;cm behind injury No.1.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Graze abrasion 4 x 3&amp;nbsp;cm., oblique on the right side of the back of trunk, 9&amp;nbsp;cm below the lower end of shoulder blade with an upward and inward direction.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Abrasion 1.5x1 cm., 2&amp;nbsp;cm below injury No.3.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Multiple graze abrasions over an area 12 x 6&amp;nbsp;cm on the outer aspect of right buttock, the upper border being 4&amp;nbsp;cm below iliac crest. The direction of the grazes were upwards and inwards.&lt;br /&gt;
6. On dissection the scale tissues over an area 2 x2 cm on middle of the top of head were found contused. The scalp tissues over an area 7 x 5&amp;nbsp;cm around injuries Nos.1 and 2 were also found contused.'''''  &lt;br /&gt;
The skull was intact.  '''Brain  showed    localised sub-arachnoid haemorrhage   underneath these contused regions.'''  No sign of increased intra-cranial tension.'''''"'''''

=== CBI's dummy test ===
On 7 April 1995, using a full-sized dummy of Sister Abhaya, the CBI made some experimental tests in the well where her corpse was found. Based on the post mortem report, On 17 April 1995 Dr. S.K. Pathak, the chief of the Forensic Department of [[SMS Medical College|Sawai Man Singh Medical college]], [[Jaipur]] and Dr. Mahesh Varma, former chairperson of Anatomy Section submitted their formal [[expert report]] to the CBI investigation team to the effect that homicide could not be ruled out. Subsequently, the CBI declared that the killers would soon be arrested.

=== Protests ===
After the dummy test, no arrests were made. The Action Council staged a protest in front of the CBI office at [[Cochin]] on 27 November 1995. Later, on 18 March 1996, another big rally was organised under the leadership of former chief minister of the state, [[E.K. Nayanar]], in front of the state secretariat at [[Thiruvananthapuram]], the state capital. Again, on 1 July 1996, the Action Council filed a petition in the High Court challenging the inaction of the CBI. On 20 August 1996, the High Court directed the CBI to complete its investigation in three months. In the meantime, the CBI advertised an award of [[Indian rupee|Rs]] 300,000 to anyone who could give dependable evidence in the case.

On 12 October 1996, all the [[Member of Parliament#India|MPs]] from Kerala visited the [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] and pleaded with him to expedite the CBI investigation. However, on 6 December 1996 the CBI filed a petition in the Chief Judicial Magistrate's court [[Ernakulam]] seeking to wind up its investigation in the matter for lack of evidence. The court rejected the request and directed the CBI to continue the investigation.

=== Court criticizing CBI ===
The Chief Judicial [[Magistrate]] (CJM) directed the CBI in its order dated 20 March 1997 to re-investigate the case. The court in its order strongly criticized the CBI for its loyalty and complicity to certain vested interests to defeat the ends of justice and the court observed that the CBI had not made party some very significant persons who otherwise emerged in the facts of the case quite evidently. The court also asserted its belief that the case could have easily been established had there been an honest and proper investigation. Further the court after seeing the video cassette of an Asianet interview, mentioned K.T. Michael by name for "influencing" the course of the investigation. This remark was later expunged by the High Court, after considering the reasons for the statements made during the interview. The CJM court observed that certain "invisible hands" were still trying to scuttle the Sister Abhaya murder case observing that these forces were trying to influence the investigating agencies and the government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indlawnews.com/086ad4df3b4246ac9ba123a7c60bb154 |title="Invisible hands" involved in Sister Abhaya Case: Court |publisher=IndLawNews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== High Court's new intervention ===
The Action Council, again on 30 May 1997 filed a [[Public Interest Litigation]] in the High Court of Kerala against the non-compliance of the CJM's directive for re-investigation. The High Court in its order directed the CBI to report back to the court the progress it had made in the investigation in ten days from the date of the order.

Having had enough of the failure and lack of interest on the part of the CBI, the High Court directed [[suo moto]] the Director of the CBI to appoint a special team from New Delhi to investigate the matter. Thus P.D. Meena, the Superintendent of the CBI from New Delhi and his team undertook a month-long investigation and reported to the High Court. The CBI was convinced that the death of Abhaya was in fact murder. However, the CBI report said that due to lack of evidence it was not possible to go further into the matter. The High Court again on 28 September 1998 directed the CBI to file its final report of the re-investigation on or before 12 October 1998.

The magistrate court later affirmed that there was clear evidence to show that some officers who took part in the investigation conducted by the local police and Crime Branch wanted to refer this case as a case of suicide. The remarks were later expunged by the High Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2006/08/22/stories/2006082210610500.htm |title=Court rejects CBI's final report in Abhaya case |publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Developments since 2007 ==
A report by B. Sreejan, senior reporter with the [[Thiruvananthapuram]] bureau of [[The New Indian Express]] (12 April 2007), stated that the original chemical examination report of the [[vaginal]] swab and vaginal smear of Abhaya has been found to have been tampered with. The manuscript of the workbook report from the Chemical Examination Laboratory shows over-writing in four places. Using a whitener and a different ink, the word ''not'' has been added to the word ''detected,'. The lab explained that it was quite normal to make corrections in the manuscript. Even Varghese P Thomas, the first investigating officer, said the post mortem and lab reports had ruled out rape, leaving no scope for suspicions on the veracity of the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=World_News&amp;subsection=India&amp;month=April2007&amp;file=World_News200704139595.xml |title=New twist in 15-year mystery over death of Kerala nun |publisher=The Peninsula}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Narco analysis tests ===

As part of its investigation in August 2007, the CBI conducted  [[Narco Analysis]] tests on Fr. [[Thomas Kottoor]], Fr. [[Jose Poothrikkayil]], Sr. Sephy and some others whom they believed had knowledge about the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/070714/43/6i1rt.html |title=CBI questions Christian priest to unravel murder mystery |publisher=Yahoo! India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/070707/43/6hsv9.html |title=CBI to conduct 'truth tests' in nun murder case |publisher=Yahoo! India}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Narco Analysis test report and CD were sent to the Chief Judicial Magistrate Court and to the High Court.

There were allegations that the CDs relating to the narco analysis tests were manipulated. Justice Ramkumar of the Kerala High Court  sent questionnaires to Dr. Malini, Assistant Director of the Bangalore centre where the narco analysis was conducted. The lab denied any manipulation.   But Justice Hema, who heard the bail petition of the accused,  based on Case Diaries, mentioned that the narco analysis CDs might have been manipulated and wanted the originals to be produced in court.
Dr. Malini has since been dismissed from service on the charge of forging her birth certificates.
CDAC Trivandrum, ordered by the Ernakulam CJM court to verify the Narco CDS submits that they are not equipped for the tests. CDs given to CDIT for tests. CDIT submits the finding that the CDs have been doctored more than 30 times. Court orders CBI to find out the original CDs. within 10 days. CBI questions the forensic lab officials including Dr. Malini. CBI makes a volte face and submits that the CDs were not edited. CDIT challenges the submission by CBI. Abhaya's father files contempt of court petition against CBI for not producing original CDs.

=== 2008 ===
On 11 January 2008, the Kerala High Court directed the CBI to produce the result of the Narco-analysis test conducted on the suspects in the case in a sealed cover before the court within two weeks. The court further directed that no third person had any right of disclosure of the content of the results till the appropriate stage, other than the High Court. In this regard, the CBI submitted it before the court on 21 January 2008. The results were submitted in a sealed cover as directed by the court.

==== Allegations regarding community leaders trying to sabotage the case ====
There was speculation that an influential Christian political leader from Central Kerala tried to sabotage the case by influencing the then Congress government in the centre.{{original research inline|date=December 2013}} Other allegations included the Catholic Church Council trying to influence the outcome of the investigations. Others also alleged that due to the constant pressure that the action council and their convener and his secret financial backers that a lot of real good leads were never followed up on or investigated.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==== Arrests ====
[[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] arrested two Catholic priests, Thomas Kottur (spelled Kottoor in another publication) and Jose Puthurukkayil, and a sister, Sister Sephy, on 19 November 2008.&lt;ref name="hindu081120"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/20/stories/2008112050270100.htm|title=Abhaya case: 2 priests, nun held |publisher=[[The Hindu]]|date=20 November 2008|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 2008 Archbishop [[Kuriakose Kunnacherry]], former head of the Archdiocese of Kottayam, was summoned for questioning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/24/stories/2008112454630400.htm Church head to be questioned-The Hindu]&lt;/ref&gt; The CBI  questioned Kottayam Archbishop [[Mathew Moolakkattu|Mathew Moolekkatt]] at its office in [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] on 24 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sify.com/news/fullstory.php?id=14804684 Sify News]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 November 2008 V.V. Augustine, the Assistant Sub Inspector who prepared the [[First Information Report]] during the initial case investigation, was found dead. Police said he committed suicide by cutting the artery on his wrist and taking poison. A suicide note cited mental torture by the CBI. The CBI had alleged that Augustine had destroyed evidence and closed the case as a suicide, but the case diary revealed it was Augustine who pointed to the possibility of homicide. He had recorded that Abhaya could have seen something objectionable in the dining room and could have been silenced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/11/26/stories/2008112661281000.htm Former Police Officer Dead-The Hindu]&lt;/ref&gt; In his personal diary, Augustine wrote about how he was pressured by CBI to say that senior police officers tried to influence him.

On 02 and 29 December 29, 2008, the CBI made a statement before P. D. Soman, Chief Judicial Magistrate Ernakulam. According to the CBI, their brain-mapping{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} and narco analysis investigations revealed that Abhaya woke up on 27 March 1992, early in the morning, descended the staircase and went to the hostel kitchen to get a drink of water from the refrigerator. Sephy hit Abhaya with an [[axe]] ('kodali') thrice on the back of the head. She then collapsed. Thinking that Abhaya was dead,  Kottoor and  Poothrikkayil, assisted by Sephy, lifted Abhaya's body, took it out of the kitchen and dumped it in a well behind the building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/03/stories/2008120350080100.htm Sr Abhaya hit with an axe.] The Hindu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2008/12/04/stories/2008120450060100.htm All accused admits to crime:CBI] The Hindu&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2009 ===
On 1 January 2009, [[Kerala High Court]] Justice K. Hema granted conditional bail to Catholic priests Thomas Kootoor and Jose Puthrukakyil and Sister Seffy.&lt;ref name="bail"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/hc-grants-bail-to-abhaya-case-accused-raps-cbi/405532|title=HC grants bail to Abhaya case accused, raps CBI|date=2 January 2009|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hema Order (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The CBI had pleaded with the Chief Justice that the bail application should be moved out of Hema's court as she was "prejudiced towards the case".&lt;ref name="bail" /&gt;

Hema found that the arguments of the CBI counsel were based on the stories appearing in the media rather than on the case diary.&lt;ref&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt; Counsel responded that the arguments had been accepted by the earlier courts.&lt;ref&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the case diary, Hema found that the CBI investigation was "only a chase for the shadow rather the object in this case. This chase is only a futile exercise. Investigation means to carefully examine the facts of a situation, an event, a crime, etc., to find out the truth about it or how it happened. It is not to fix the target first, without any evidence and then make a hunt for evidence."&lt;ref&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Hema also criticised the media and the public, which pronounced the verdict knowing very little about the facts of the case, including the 24 volumes of case diary, the medical reports and the statements from the doctors.&lt;ref&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 93-95&lt;/ref&gt; Hema also mentioned the accusations propagated by the media, public and the CBI against officers of the local police and crime branch without any incriminating evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Hema refuted the argument that ASI Augustine tried to suppress facts.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 24-25"&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; The case diary indicates that it was Augustine, who was in charge of the case for only two days, recorded the possibility of murder.&lt;ref name="Hema Order 2009, para. 24-25" /&gt; Hema also observed that nowhere in the case diary is there any mention that the church had tried to influence the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 32&lt;/ref&gt; Hema also made observations on the reliability of the narco analysis CDs and ordered production of the original CDs.&lt;ref&gt;Hema Order (2009), para. 54-56&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 December 2008, [[Kerala Kaumudi]] wrote an editorial criticizing Hema's conduct during the bail hearing. A Division Bench of the High Court initiated criminal [[contempt of court]] proceedings against the newspaper on the basis of the editorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expressbuzz.com/States/Kerala/criminal-contempt-case-against-kerala-kaumudi/34312.html|title=Criminal contempt case against Kerala Kaumudi|date=15 January 2009|publisher=expressbuzz - Indian Express Group|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Kerala Kaumudi apologized, which the High Court accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/03/04/stories/2009030455401000.htm|title=Order reserved in SME ragging case|date=4 March 2009|accessdate=26 November 2010|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2009/03/26/stories/2009032660000400.htm|title=Bench disapproves of talk shows on its orders|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=26 November 2010|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CBI filed chargesheet ====
On 17 July 2009, the CBI filed a chargesheet in the Court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Ernakulam, charging Fathers Kottoor and Poothrikkayil and Sister Sephy with murder, destruction of evidence, and defamation.&lt;ref name="ie090717"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/sister-abhaya-case-cbi-files-chargesheet-ag/490774|title=Sister Abhaya case: CBI files chargesheet against three|date=17 July 2009|publisher=[[Indian Express]]|accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Alleged confession ====
In September 2009, the tapes, which were claimed to be recordings of the narco tests conducted by CBI agents on the three accused were leaked to [[Kairali TV]], a local television station. These revealed the alleged confessions of Father Jose Poothrikkayil, Father Thomas M. Kottur and Sister Sephys, who were all in the state of sedation.&lt;ref name="toi-confession" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/news-archive/web/cpm-mouthpiece-airs-doubts-on-narco-test/|title=CPM mouthpiece airs doubts on narco test|date=2009-10-07|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The videos, which have been uploaded at Youtube,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=9999mig|title=Abhaya Case - Sister Sephy confessing at Narco Test - Part1|date=2009-09-16|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1ZyrhhgUWo|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=DAILY INDIAN HERALD|title=Abhaya Case   Sister Sephy confessing at Narco Test   Part2|date=2017-03-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUEpXJeHvlU|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed the suspects detailing what happened during the night of the murder after having been injected with the truth serum. It was not clear whether the tapes were authentic or if it were accepted as evidence by the court.  

==== Latest development ====
In January 2018, reports indicated that former superintendent of the police, K.T. Michael, was included in the list of the accused in the case based on an order of a special CBI court.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://india.ucanews.com/news/new-twist-to-26yearold-sister-abhaya-case-in-kerala/36427/daily|title=New twist to 26-year-old Sister Abhaya case in Kerala {{!}} UCAN India|website=india.ucanews.com|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael, who was part of the preliminary police investigation, was charged for allegedly destroying evidence such as the victim's robe and diary.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The loss of these materials is also said indicate a conspiracy. 

On March 2018, Father Jose Poothrukkayil was acquitted by the special CBI court, which cited a failure on the part of the prosecutors to find substantial evidence that prove the accused visited the convent on the day of the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/kerala/2018/mar/07/sister-abhaya-murder-case-fr-jose-poothrukkayil-acquitted-1783445.html|title=Sister Abhaya murder case: Fr Jose Poothrukkayil acquitted|work=The New Indian Express|access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discharge petitions of the other two were rejected.  

=== Motives ===
The CBI informed the Kerala High Court in late November 2008 and early December 2008 that Sister Abhaya had accidentally intruded upon Sr. Sephy and the other two accused priests in a "compromising position". Sr Sephy panicked and, on the spur of the moment, Sephy hit Abhaya with an axe meant for chopping firewood. The three accused together dumped Abhaya's body into the well.

CBI also informed the High Court about the remarkable degree of care the accused took to hide the crime. This allegedly included the bizarre claim of a hymen-restoration ([[hymenoplasty]] or [[hymenorrhaphy]]) procedure on Sr. Sephy which was discovered through gynaecological tests conducted on her in late 2008. This was strongly refuted by the accused. The counsel for the accused dared CBI to prove that such an operation has ever been conducted in India. Further, the building where the crime was allegedly committed was extensively remodelled.

'''''The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past''''', (Pimlico, 1999), is a book by [[Thomas L. Thompson]], Professor of Old Testament at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. Its US title is '''''The Mythic Past: Biblical Archaeology and the Myth of Israel'''''.

== Summary ==
The theme of ''The Bible in History'' is the need to treat the bible as literature rather than as history. Danny Yee cites a passage: "The Bible's language is not an historical language. It is a language of high literature, of story, of sermon and of song. It is a tool of philosophy and moral instruction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dannyreviews.com/h/Bible_History.html "The Bible in History", quoted in dannyreviews.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Part 1 deals with general historiographical issues, including the importance of understanding the types and purposes of different biblical stories, the dangers of treating myth and poetry as history, and the use of origin-myths as recurring motifs, concluding that the bible was intended to provide an ancient people with a common past, and thus was very different from our own tradition of critical history-writing. Part 2 is a history of ancient Palestine and the surrounding region from the earliest human settlement to the [[Hellenistic period]] drawing on the most recent archaeological and historical studies, and Part 3 concludes with a survey of the theological implications of the preceding study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dannyreviews.com/h/Bible_History.html dannyreviews.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The minimalist/maximalist debate ==
Thompson is a leading [[Biblical minimalism|biblical minimalist]], a group of like-minded scholars including [[Niels Peter Lemche]], Philip R. Davies, and Keith W. Whitelam among others who say that the [[Hebrew bible]] cannot be treated as history, because it was not intended as history. The minimalist argument has been received with emotions bordering on outrage by other scholars, somewhat inaccurately known as "maximalists"{{snd}} most of them do not in fact subscribe to a view that would take all or even most of the bible as being historically accurate, but object strongly to the minimalist contention that it is completely or almost completely ahistorical. The debate has been frequently framed in political terms, with the minimalists accused of subverting the existence of the modern state of Israel and worse. "The Bible in History", Thompson's attempt to summarise the minimalist thesis and set it before a wider public, was the immediate cause for [[William G. Dever]]'s rejoinder, ''[[What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?]]'', (2001), which then led into a long and frequently heated debate (in which Davies, rather than Thompson, championed the minimalist side) on the merits of the bible as history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://prophetess.lstc.edu/~rklein/Documents/history_of_israel.htm prophetess: See section "The Minimalism Debate" for links to papers from each side relating to the dispute]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''revaluation of all values''' or "'''transvaluation'''" is a [[concept]] from the [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|philosophy]] of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].

Elaborating the concept in ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]'', Nietzsche asserts that  [[Christianity]], not merely as a religion but also as the predominant moral system of the Western world, inverts nature, and is "hostile to life".  As "the religion of pity", it elevates the weak over the strong, exalting that which is "ill-constituted and weak" at the expense of that which is full of life and vitality.

Nietzsche compares Christianity to [[Buddhism]]. He posits that Christianity is "the struggle against sin", whereas Buddhism is "the struggle against suffering"; to Nietzsche, Christianity limits and lowers humankind by assailing its natural and inevitable instincts as depraved ("[[sin]]"), whereas Buddhism advises one merely to eschew [[dukkha|suffering]]. While Christianity is full of "revengefulness" and "antipathy" (e.g., the [[Last Judgment]]), Buddhism promotes "benevolence, being kind, as health-promoting."  Buddhism is also suggested to be the more "honest" of the two religions, for its being strictly "[[phenomenalism|phenomenalistic]]", and because "Christianity makes a thousand promises but ''keeps none''."  [[Martyrdom]], rather than being a moral high ground or position of strength, is indicative of an "''obtuseness'' to the question of truth."

Similarly, Nietzsche contrasts 19th-century European morality to that of pre-Christian Greek civilization. Because sex is, in Nietzsche's thought, a fundamental affirmation of life, for its being the very process by which human life is created, Christianity's elevation of chastity (including, for example, the story of [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]'s virginal pregnancy) is counter to the natural instincts of humanity, and therefore a contradiction of "natural values".{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Nietzsche's enthusiasm for what he called "transvaluation" stemmed from his contempt for Christianity and the entirety of the moral system that flowed from it: indeed, "contempt of man", as Nietzsche states near the end of ''The Antichrist''. Nietzsche perceived the moral framework of Christian civilization to be oppressive:  
* Reproduction derided as sinful
* Life as a mere investment for the hollow promise of an illustrious afterlife
* Death valued over life

Transvaluation would mean the exaltation of life rather than the exaltation of suffering, and an acceptance of every instinct or lust as organic and therefore valid{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}, and so beyond the scope of moral condemnation. What one desires would be merely what one desires, rather than either sinful or pious. What one desires would be the product of stimuli rather than the product of "will".

{{quote|I call Christianity the one great curse, the one great intrinsic depravity, the one great instinct for revenge for which no expedient&amp;nbsp;''(i.e. A means of attaining an end, especially one that is convenient but considered improper or immoral)''&amp;nbsp;is sufficiently poisonous, secret, subterranean, ''petty''&amp;nbsp;—I call it the one immortal blemish of mankind…&lt;br /&gt;

And one calculates time from the ''dies nefastus'' on which this fatality arose—from the ''first'' day of Christianity! ''Why not rather from its last? From today?'' Revaluation of all values!|sign=Nietzsche|source=Conclusion, ''[[The Antichrist (book)|The Antichrist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Nietzsche |first=Friedrich |authorlink=Friedrich Nietzsche |title=The Antichrist |chapter=Conclusion |edition=2005 Cosimo |date=1895 |isbn=978-1-59605-681-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''[[The Revaluation of All Values]]'' was also the working title of a series of four books Nietzsche was planning to write, only the first of which—''The Antichrist''—he ever completed. However, one of his schemas for ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'' used "The Revaluation of All Values" as a subtitle, and it was this scheme that his sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] used to assemble his notes into the final book with that title.
