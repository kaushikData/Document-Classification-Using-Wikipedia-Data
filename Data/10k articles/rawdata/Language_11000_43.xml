In medicine, '''compliance''' (also '''adherence''', '''capacitance''') describes the degree to which a patient correctly follows medical advice. Most commonly, it refers to medication or drug compliance, but it can also apply to other situations such as medical device use, [[self care]], self-directed exercises, or therapy sessions. Both patient and health-care provider affect compliance, and a positive physician-patient relationship is the most important factor in improving compliance,&lt;ref name=WhoReport&gt;{{cite book |author=World Health Organization |title=Adherence to long-term therapies: evidence for action |publisher=World Health Organisation |location=Geneva |year=2003 |isbn=92-4-154599-2 |format=PDF |url=http://www.who.int/chp/knowledge/publications/adherence_full_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of prescription medication also plays a major role.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt;

Compliance can be confused with '''concordance''', which is the process by which a patient and clinician make decisions together about treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence |date=3 March 2008 |title=Medicines concordance (involving patients in decisions about prescribed medicines) |url=http://guidance.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=267072 |access-date=2011-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070427195630/http://guidance.nice.org.uk/page.aspx?o=267072 |archive-date=2007-04-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, non-compliance is a major obstacle to the effective delivery of health care. 2003 estimates from the [[World Health Organization]] indicated that only about 50% of patients with chronic diseases living in [[developed countries]] follow treatment recommendations with particularly low rates of adherence to therapies for [[asthma]], [[diabetes]], and [[hypertension]].&lt;ref name="WhoReport"/&gt; Major barriers to compliance are thought to include the complexity of modern medication regimens, poor "health literacy" and not understanding treatment benefits, occurrence of undiscussed side effects, poor treatment satisfaction, cost of prescription medicine, and poor communication or lack of trust between a patient and his or her health-care provider.&lt;ref name=APA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ngoh/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elliott2009"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elliott RA, Marriott JL |title=Standardised assessment of patients' capacity to manage medications: a systematic review of published instruments |journal=BMC Geriatr |volume=9|pages=27 |year=2009 |pmid=19594913 |pmc=2719637 |doi=10.1186/1471-2318-9-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berhe DF, Taxis K, Haaijer-Ruskamp FM, Mulugeta A, Mengistu YT, Burgerhof JG, Mol PG | year = 2017 | title = Impact of adverse drug events and treatment satisfaction on patient adherence with antihypertensive medication – a study in ambulatory patients | url = | journal = Br J Clin Pharmacol | volume =  | issue = | page =  | doi = 10.1111/bcp.13312 | pmid = 28429533 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to improve compliance have been aimed at simplifying medication packaging, providing effective medication reminders, improving patient education, and limiting the number of medications prescribed simultaneously. Studies show a great variation in terms of characteristics and effects of interventions to improve medicine adherence.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nieuwlaat|first=Robby|last2=Wilczynski|first2=Nancy|last3=Navarro|first3=Tamara|last4=Hobson|first4=Nicholas|last5=Jeffery|first5=Rebecca|last6=Keepanasseril|first6=Arun|last7=Agoritsas|first7=Thomas|last8=Mistry|first8=Niraj|last9=Iorio|first9=Alfonso|date=2014-11-20|title=Interventions for enhancing medication adherence|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=11|pages=CD000011|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD000011.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25412402}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still unclear how adherence can consistently be improved in order to promote clinically important effects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Terminology==

In medicine, compliance (synonymous with adherence, capacitance) describes the degree to which a patient correctly follows medical advice. Most commonly, it refers to medication or drug compliance, but it can also apply to medical device use, [[self care]], self-directed exercises, or therapy sessions. Both patient and health-care provider affect compliance, and a positive physician-patient relationship is the most important factor in improving compliance,&lt;ref name=WhoReport&gt;{{cite book |author=World Health Organization |title=Adherence to long-term therapies: evidence for action |publisher=World Health Organisation |location=Geneva |year=2003 |isbn=92-4-154599-2 |format=PDF |url=http://www.who.int/chp/knowledge/publications/adherence_full_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2003, US health care professionals more commonly used the term "adherence" to a regimen rather than "compliance", because it has been thought to reflect better the diverse reasons for patients not following treatment directions in part or in full.&lt;ref name=Ngoh&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ngoh LN |title=Health literacy: a barrier to pharmacist-patient communication and medication adherence |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc (2003) |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=e132–46; quiz e147–9 |year=2009 |pmid=19748861 |doi=10.1331/JAPhA.2009.07075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tilson HH |title=Adherence or compliance? Changes in terminology |journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy |year=2004 |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=161–2 |pmid=14742813 |doi=10.1345/aph.1D207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the term adherence includes the ability of the patient to take medications as prescribed by their physician with regards to the correct drug, dose, route, timing, and frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Viswanathan M, Golin CE, Jones CD, Ashok M, Blalock S, Wines RCM, Coker-Schwimmer EJL, Grodensky CA, Rosen DL, Yuen A, Sista P, Lohr KN. [http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/reports/final.cfm. Medication Adherence Interventions: Comparative Effectiveness. Closing the Quality Gap: Revisiting the State of the Science.] Evidence Report No. 208. Prepared by RTI International–University of North Carolina Evidence-based Practice Center under Contract No. 290-2007-10056-I. AHRQ Publication No. 12-E010-EF. Rockville, MD: Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that compliance may only refer to passively following orders.&lt;ref name="Rifaat Nizar, Abdel-Hady Elham, Hasan Ali A 371–376"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rifaat Nizar |author2=Abdel-Hady Elham |author3=Hasan Ali A | year = 2013| title = The golden factor in adherence to inhaled corticosteroid in asthma patients | url = | journal = Egyptian Journal of Chest Diseases and Tuberculosis | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 371–376 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejcdt.2013.07.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term concordance has been used in the [[United Kingdom]] to involve a patient in the treatment process to improve compliance, and refers to a 2003 [[National Health Service|NHS]] initiative. In this context, the patient is informed about their condition and treatment options,involved in the decision as to which course of action to take, and partially responsible for monitoring and reporting back to the team.&lt;ref name="BMJ"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Not to be taken as directed - Putting concordance for taking medicines into practice |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=326 |issue=7385 |pages=348–9 |date=15 February 2003 |author=Marinker and Shaw |doi=10.1136/bmj.326.7385.348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2005, the preferred terminology remained a matter of debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1056/NEJMra050100 |vauthors=Osterberg L, Blaschke T |title=Adherence to Medication |journal=[[N Engl J Med]] |year=2005 |volume=353 |issue=5 |pages=487–97 |pmid=16079372}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2007, concordance has been used to refer specifically to patient adherence to a treatment regimen which the physician sets up collaboratively with the patient, to differentiate it from adherence to a physician-only prescribed treatment regimen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bell JS, Airaksinen MS, Lyles A, Chen TF, Aslani P |title=Concordance is not synonymous with compliance or adherence |journal=[[Br J Clin Pharmacol]] |year=2007 |volume=64 |issue=5 |pages=710–1 |pmid=17875196 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2007.02971_1.x |pmc=2203263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aronson JK |title=Compliance, concordance, adherence |journal=[[Br J Clin Pharmacol]] |year=2007 |volume=63 |issue=4 |pages=383–4 |pmid=17378797 |pmc=2203247 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2125.2007.02893.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=US NIH Office of Behavior and Social Sciences Research |url=http://obssr.od.nih.gov/pdf/Workshop_final_report.pdf |title=Framework for adherence research and translation: a blueprint for the next ten years |year=2008 |access-date=2010-05-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528015152/http://obssr.od.nih.gov/pdf/Workshop_final_report.pdf |archive-date=2010-05-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ongoing debate, adherence has been the preferred term for the [[World Health Organization]],&lt;ref name=WhoReport/&gt; The [[American Pharmacists Association]],&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web |work=APA Highlights Newsletter |title=Enhancing Patient Adherence: Proceedings of the Pinnacle Roundtable Discussion |date=October 2004 |volume=7 |issue=4 |url=http://www.pharmacist.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home2&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=11174 |access-date=2018-10-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615092834/http://www.pharmacist.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home2&amp;TEMPLATE=%2FCM%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=11174 |archive-date=2011-06-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] Adherence Research Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Office of Behavior and Social Sciences Research |publisher=U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] |title=Adherence Research Network |url=http://obssr.od.nih.gov/scientific_areas/health_behaviour/adherence/adherenceresearchnetwork.aspx |accessdate=12 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502064804/http://obssr.od.nih.gov/scientific_areas/health_behaviour/adherence/adherenceresearchnetwork.aspx |archive-date=2010-05-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compliance factors==
An estimated half of those for whom treatment regimens are prescribed do not follow them as directed.&lt;ref name=WhoReport/&gt;
Until recently,{{when|date=December 2017}} this was termed "non-compliance", which some regarded as meaning that someone did not follow the treatment directions due to irrational behavior or willful ignoring of instructions.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Health literacy===

Cost and poor understanding of the directions for the treatment, referred to as '[[health literacy]]' have been known to be major barriers to treatment adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enhancing Patient Adherence: Proceedings of the Pinnacle Roundtable Discussion|work=APA Highlights Newsletter|date=October 2004|url=http://www.pharmacist.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home2&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=11174|access-date=2018-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615092834/http://www.pharmacist.com/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home2&amp;TEMPLATE=%2FCM%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=11174|archive-date=2011-06-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ngoh LN |year=2003 |title=Health literacy: a barrier to pharmacist-patient communication and medication adherence |journal=J Am Pharm Assoc |volume=49 |issue=5 |pages=e132–46; quiz e147–9 |doi=10.1331/JAPhA.2009.07075 |pmid=19748861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Elliott RA, Marriott JL |year=2009 |title=Standardised assessment of patients' capacity to manage medications: a systematic review of published instruments |journal=BMC Geriatr |volume=9 |page=27 |doi=10.1186/1471-2318-9-27 |pmc=2719637 |pmid=19594913}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is robust evidence that education and physical health are correlated. Poor educational attainment is a key factor in the cycle of health inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Donald Acheson |year=1998 |title=Independent inquiry into inequalities in health}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |publisher=HM Government |year=2002 |title=Tackling health inequalities}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Park DC, Hertzog C, Leventhal H, Morrell RW, Leventhal E, Birchmore D, Martin M, Bennett J |year=1999 |title=Medication adherence in rheumatoid arthritis patients: older is wiser |journal=Journal of the American Geriatrics Society |volume=47 |issue=2 |pages=172–183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational qualifications help to determine an individual's position in the labour market, their level of income and therefore their access to resources.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Literacy===

In 1999 one fifth of UK adults, nearly seven million people, had problems with basic skills, especially [[Functional illiteracy|functional literacy]] and functional numeracy, described as: "The ability to read, write and speak in English, and to use mathematics at a level necessary to function at work and in society in general." This made it impossible for them to effectively take medication, read labels, follow drug regimes, and find out more. This was&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationengland.org.uk/documents/pdfs/1999-moser-summary.pdf Moser Report Summary] educationengland.org, 14 pages (1999)retrieved 28. 12. 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, 20% of adults in the UK had a long-standing illness or disability and a national study for the UK [[Department of Health]], found more than one-third of people with poor or very poor health had literary skills of Entry Level 3 or below.&lt;ref name=DOH&gt;{{cite web|vauthors=Williams J, Clemens S, Oleinikova K, Tarvin K |year=2003 |title=The skills for life survey. A national needs and impact survey of literacy, numeracy and ICT skills |location=London |publisher=Department for Education and Skills |url=https://www.education.gov.uk/publications/RSG/BasicSkills/Page3/RB490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low levels of literacy and numeracy were found to be associated with socio-economic deprivation.&lt;ref name=DOH/&gt; Adults in more deprived areas, such as the North East of England, performed at a lower level than those in less deprived areas such as the South East. Local authority tenants and those in poor health were particularly likely to lack basic skills.&lt;ref name=DOH/&gt;

A 2000 analysis of over 100 UK [[local education authority]] areas found educational attainment at 15–16 years of age to be strongly associated with coronary heart disease and subsequent infant mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |publisher=Department of Health and Treasury |year=2000 |title=Cross-cutting government review, Tackling health inequalities |postscript={{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of the relationship of literacy to asthma knowledge revealed that 31% of asthma patients with a reading level of a ten-year-old knew they needed to see the doctors, even when they were not having an asthma attack, compared to 90% with a high school graduate reading level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1998-10-01|title=Inadequate Literacy Is a Barrier to Asthma Knowledge and Self-Care|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012369216329981|journal=Chest|language=en|volume=114|issue=4|pages=1008–1015|doi=10.1378/chest.114.4.1008|issn=0012-3692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment cost===
In 2013 the US National Community Pharmacists Association sampled for one month 1,020 Americans above age 40 for with an ongoing prescription to take medication for a chronic condition and gave a grade C+ on adherence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmacytimes.com/association-news/new-report-card-on-medication-use-gives-americans-a-c New Report Card on Medication Use Gives Americans a C+] Pharmacy Times. JUNE 25, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2017}} In 2009, this contributed to an estimated cost of $290 billion annually.&lt;ref&gt;Thinking Outside the Pillbox: A System-wide Approach to Improving Patient Adherence for Chronic Disease." NEHI. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, increase in patient medication cost share was found to be associated with low adherence to medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eaddy MT, Cook CL, O'Day K, Burch SP, Cantrell CR | year = 2012 | title = How Patient Cost-Sharing Trends Affect Adherence and Outcomes: A Literature Review | url = | journal = Pharmacy and Therapeutics | volume = 37 | issue = 1| pages = 45–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States is among the countries with the highest prices of prescription drugs mainly attributed to the government's lack of negotiating lower prices with monopolies in the pharmaceutical industry especially with brand name drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kesselheim AS, Avorn J, Sarpatwari A | year = 2016 | title = The High Cost of Prescription Drugs in the United States Origins and Prospects for Reform | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 316 | issue = 8| pages = 858–871 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2016.11237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to manage medication costs, many US patients on long term therapies fail to fill their prescription, skip or reduce doses. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey in 2015, about three quarters (73%) of the public think drug prices are unreasonable and blame pharmaceutical companies for setting prices so high.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation: Poll Finds Nearly Three Quarters of Americans Say Prescription Drug Costs Are Unreasonable, and Most Blame Drug Makers Rather Than Insurers for the Problem&lt;/ref&gt; In the same report, half of the public reported that they are taking prescription drugs and a "quarter (25%) of those currently taking prescription medicine report they or a family member have not filled a prescription in the past 12 months due to cost, and 18 percent report cutting pills in half or skipping doses".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In a 2009 comparison to Canada, only 8% of adults reported to have skipped their doses or not filling their prescriptions due to the cost of their prescribed medications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kennedy J, Morgan S | year = | title = Cost-related prescription nonadherence in the united states and Canada: A system-level comparison using the 2007 international health policy survey in seven countries | url = | journal = Clinical Therapeutics | volume = 31 | issue = 1| pages = 213–219 | doi = 10.1016/j.clinthera.2009.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age===
Both young and elderly status have been associated with non-adherence.

The elderly often have multiple health conditions, and around half of all [[National Health Service (England)|NHS]] medicines are prescribed for people over retirement age, despite representing only about 20% of the UK population.&lt;ref&gt;UK Department of Health (2001): National Service Framework for Older People, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UK Office of Health Economics (2000): Compendium of Health Statistics, 12th Edition, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The recent [[National Service Framework]] on the care of older people highlighted the importance of taking and effectively managing medicines in this population. However, elderly individuals may face challenges, including multiple medications with frequent dosing, and potentially decreased dexterity or cognitive functioning. Patient knowledge is a concern that has been observed.

In 1999 Cline et al. identified several gaps in knowledge about medication in elderly patients discharged from hospital.&lt;ref name="Cline1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cline CM, Bjorck-Linne AK, Israelsson BY, Willenheimer RB, Erhardt LR |year=1999 |title=Non-adherence and knowledge of prescribed medication in elderly patients with heart failure |journal=European Journal of Heart Failure |volume=1 |pages=145–149 |doi=10.1016/S1388-9842(99)00014-8 |pmid=10937924 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite receiving written and verbal information, 27% of older people discharged after heart failure were classed as non-adherent within 30 days. Half the patients surveyed could not recall the dose of their medication and nearly two-thirds did not know what time of day to take them. A 2001 study by Barat et al. evaluated the medical knowledge and factors of adherence in a population of 75-year-olds living at home. They found that 40% of elderly patients do not know the purpose of their regimen and only 20% knew the consequences of non-adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barat I, Andreasen F, Damsgaard EM |year=2001 |title=Drug therapy in the elderly: what doctors believe and patients actually do |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=615–622 |doi=10.1046/j.0306-5251.2001.01401.x |pmid=11422022 |pmc=2014493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comprehension, [[polypharmacy]], living arrangement, multiple doctors, and use of compliance aids was correlated with adherence. According to a conservative estimate 10% of all hospital admissions{{where|date=December 2017}} are through patients not managing their medication.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In children with asthma self-management compliance is critical and co-morbidites have been noted to affect outcomes; in 2013 it has been suggested that electronic monitoring may help adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exploring the impact of elevated depressive symptoms on the ability of a tailored asthma intervention to improve medication adherence among urban adolescents with asthma.|date = Nov 2013|journal = Allergy, Asthma &amp; Clinical Immunology |doi = 10.1186/1710-1492-9-45|pmid = 24479403 |volume=9 |pages=45 |pmc=3832221 |vauthors=Guglani L, Havstad SL, Ownby DR, Saltzgaber J, Johnson DA, Johnson CC, Joseph CL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social factors of treatment adherence have been studied in children and adolescent psychiatric disorders:

===Ethnicity===
People of different ethnic backgrounds have unique adherence issues through literacy, physiology, culture or poverty.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} There are few published studies on adherence in medicine taking in ethnic minority communities. Ethnicity and culture influence some health-determining behaviour, such as participation in screening programmes and attendance at follow-up appointments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Courtenay WH, McCreary DR, Merighi JR |year=2002 |title=Gender and ethnic differences in health beliefs and behaviours |journal=Journal of Health Psychology |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=219–231 |doi=10.1177/1359105302007003216 |pmid=22114246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Meyerowitz BE, Richardson J, Hudson S, Leedham B |year=1998 |title=Ethnicity and cancer outcomes: behavioural and psychosocial considerations |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=123 |issue=1 |pages=47–70 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.123.1.47 |pmid=9461853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prieto ''et al'' emphasised the influence of ethnic and cultural factors on adherence. They pointed out that groups differ in their attitudes, values and beliefs about health and illness. This view could affect adherence, particularly with preventive treatments and medication for asymptomatic conditions. Additionally, some cultures fatalistically attribute their good or poor health to their god(s), and attach less importance to self-care than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1997 |title=Multicultural issues in organ transplantation: the influence of patients' cultural perspectives on adherence with treatment |journal=Clinical Transplantation |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=529–535 |vauthors=Prieto LR, Miller DS, Gayowski T, Marino IR |pmid=9408680}}&lt;/ref&gt; also

Measures of adherence may need to be modified for different ethnic or cultural groups. In some cases, it may be advisable to assess patients from a cultural perspective before making decisions about their individual treatment.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Prescription fill rates===
Not all patients will fill the prescription at a pharmacy. In a 2010 U.S. study, 20–30% of prescriptions were never filled at the pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fischer MA, Stedman MR, Lii J |title=Primary medication non-adherence: analysis of 195,930 electronic prescriptions |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=284–90 |date=April 2010 |pmid=20131023 |doi=10.1007/s11606-010-1253-9 |pmc=2842539 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Norton M |publisher=Reuters Health |title=Many patients may not fill their prescriptions |year=2010 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61G3QX20100217 |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons people do not fill prescriptions include the cost of the medication,&lt;ref name=Harris&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Harris Interactive |title=Out-of-pocket costs may be a substantial barrier to prescription drug compliance |url=http://www.harrisinteractive.com/news/newsletters/healthnews/HI_HealthCareNews2001Vol1_iss32.pdf |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=APA/&gt; A US nationwide survey of 1,010 adults in 2001 found that 22% chose not to fill prescriptions because of the price, which is similar to the 20–30% overall rate of unfilled prescriptions.&lt;ref name=Harris/&gt; Other factors are doubting the need for medication, or preference for self-care measures other than medication.&lt;ref name=Shah&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shah NR, Hirsch AG, Zacker C, Taylor S, Wood GC, Stewart WF |title=Factors associated with first-fill adherence rates for diabetic medications: a cohort study |journal=J Gen Intern Med |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=233–7 |date=February 2009 |pmid=19093157 |pmc=2629003 |doi=10.1007/s11606-008-0870-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shah NR, Hirsch AG, Zacker C |title=Predictors of first-fill adherence for patients with hypertension |journal=Am.

==== Medication Possession Ratio ====
Prescription medical claims records can be used to estimate medication adherence based on fill rate. Patients can be routinely defined as being 'Adherent Patients' if the amount of medication furnished is at least 80% based on days' supply of medication divided by the number of days patient should be consuming the medication. This percentage is called the medication possession ratio (MPR). 2013 work has suggested that a medication possession ratio of 90% or above may be a better threshold for deeming consumption as 'Adherent'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Watanabe JH, Bounthavong M, Chen T | date = Mar 2013 | title = Revisiting the medication possession ratio threshold for adherence in lipid management | url = | journal = Curr Med Res Opin | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 175–80 | doi = 10.1185/03007995.2013.766164 | pmid = 23320610 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two forms of MPR can be calculated, fixed and variable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kozma CM, Dickson M, Phillips AL, Meletiche D | year = 2013 | title = Medication possession ratio: implications of using fixed and variable observation periods in assessing adherence with disease-modifying drugs in patients with multiple sclerosis | url = | journal = Patient Prefer Adherence | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 509–516 | doi = 10.2147/PPA.S40736}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculating either is relatively straightforward, for Variable MPR (VMPR) it is calculated as the number of days' supply divided by the number of elapsed days including the last prescription.

&lt;math&gt;
VMPR = \dfrac{\text{All days' supply}}{\text{Elapsed days (inclusive of last prescription)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

For the Fixed MPR (FMPR) the calculation is similar but the denominator is the number of days in a year whilst the numerator is constrained to be the number of days' supply within the year that the patient has been prescribed.

&lt;math&gt;
FMPR = \dfrac{\text{All days' supply} \le 365}{365}
&lt;/math&gt;

For medication in tablet form it is relatively straightforward to calculate the number of days' supply based on a prescription. Some medications are less straightforward though because a prescription of a given number of doses may have a variable number of days' supply because the number of doses to be taken per day varies, for example with preventative corticosteroid inhalers prescribed for asthma where the number of inhalations to be taken daily may vary between individuals based on the severity of the disease.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Course completion===
Once started, patients seldom follow treatment regimens as directed, and seldom complete the course of treatment.&lt;ref name=APA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ngoh/&gt; In respect of hypertension, 50% of patients completely drop out of care within a year of diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mapes RE |year=1977 |title=Physicians' drug innovation and relinquishment |journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine |volume=11 |pages=619–24 |doi=10.1016/0037-7856(77)90044-0 |issue=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Persistence with first-line single antihypertensive drugs is extremely low during the first year of treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Mazzaglia G, Mantovani LG, Sturkenboom M, Filippi A, Trifiro G, Cricelli C, Brignoli O, Caputi AP, |title=Patterns of persistence with antihypertensive medications in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients in Italy: a retrospective cohort study in primary care|journal=Hypertens|volume=23 |issue=11 |pages=2093–100|date= November 2005 |pmid= |doi=10.1097/01.hjh.0000186832.41125.8a}}&lt;/ref&gt; As far as lipid-lowering treatment is concerned, only one third of patients are compliant with at least 90% of their treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sung JC |date=Oct 1998 |title=Factors affecting patient compliance with antihyperlipidemic medications in an HMO population |journal=Am J Manag Care |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=1421–30 |pmid=10338735|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intensification of patient care interventions (e.g. electronic reminders, pharmacist-led interventions, healthcare professional &lt;abbr&gt;education&lt;/abbr&gt; of patients) improves patient adherence rates to lipid-lowering medicines, as well as total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Driel|first=Mieke L.|last2=Morledge|first2=Michael D.|last3=Ulep|first3=Robin|last4=Shaffer|first4=Johnathon P.|last5=Davies|first5=Philippa|last6=Deichmann|first6=Richard|date=2016-12-21|title=Interventions to improve adherence to lipid-lowering medication|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=12|pages=CD004371|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004371.pub4|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28000212|pmc=4163627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated in 2003 that only 50% of people complete long-term therapy for chronic illnesses as they were prescribed, which puts patient health at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=World Health Organization |year=2003 |title=Adherence to long-term therapies: evidence for action |location=Geneva |publisher=World Health Organisation |isbn=92-4-154599-2 |url=http://www.who.int/chp/knowledge/publications/adherence_full_report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2002 [[statin]] compliance dropped to between 25–40% after two years of treatment, with patients taking statins for what they perceive to be preventative reasons being unusually poor compliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jackevicius CA |year=2002 |title=Adherence with statin therapy in elderly patients with and without acute coronary syndromes |journal=JAMA |volume=288 |issue=4 |pages=462–467 |doi=10.1001/jama.288.4.462 |pmid=12132976 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of packaging approaches have been proposed to help patients complete prescribed treatments. These approaches include formats that increase the ease of remembering the dosage regimen as well as different labels for increasing patient understanding of directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shrank W, Avorn J, Rolon C, Shekelle P |title=Effect of content and format of prescription drug labels on readability, understanding, and medication use: a systematic review |journal=Annals of Pharmacotherapy |volume=41 |issue=5 |pages=783–801 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17426075 |doi=10.1345/aph.1H582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mahtani|first=Kamal R.|last2=Heneghan|first2=Carl J.|last3=Glasziou|first3=Paul P.|last4=Perera| first4=Rafael|date=2011-09-07|title=Reminder packaging for improving adherence to self-administered long-term medications| journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews| issue=9| pages=CD005025| doi=10.1002/14651858.CD005025.pub3| issn=1469-493X|pmid=21901694}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, medications are sometimes packed with reminder systems for the day and/or time of the week to take the medicine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some evidence shows that reminder packaging may improve clinical outcomes such as blood pressure.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A not-for-profit organisation called the Healthcare Compliance Packaging Council of Europe] (HCPC-Europe) was set up{{when|date=December 2017}} between the pharmaceutical industry, the packaging industry with representatives of European patients organisations. The mission of HCPC-Europe is to assist and to educate the healthcare sector in the improvement of patient compliance through the use of packaging solutions. A variety of packaging solutions have been developed by this collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081019100628/http://www.hcpc-europe.org/cms/front_content.php?idcat=94 Healthcare Compliance Packaging Council of Europe] www.hcpc-europe.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Health Organization Barriers to Adherence ==
The World Health Organization (WHO) groups barriers to medication adherence into five categories; health care team and system-related factors, social and economic factors, condition-related factors, therapy-related factors, and patient-related factors. Common barriers include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js4883e/7.2.html|title=Adherence to Long-Term Therapies - Evidence for Action: Section II - Improving adherence rates: guidance for countries: Chapter V - Towards the solution: 1.

==Improving compliance rates==

===Role of health care providers===
Health care providers play a great role in improving adherence issues. Providers can improve patient interactions through motivational interviewing and active listening.&lt;ref&gt;Stefanacci, Richard G., DO, MGH, MBA, AGSF, CMD, and Scott Guerin, PhD. "Why Medication Adherence Matters To Patients, Payers, Providers." Managed Care Jan. 2013. Accessed Nov 2, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Health care providers should work with patients to devise a plan that is meaningful for the patient's needs. A relationship that offers trust, cooperation, and mutual responsibility can greatly improve the connection between provider and patient for a positive impact.&lt;ref name="Rifaat Nizar, Abdel-Hady Elham, Hasan Ali A 371–376"/&gt;

===Technology===
In 2012 it was predicted that as telemedicine technology improves, physicians will have better capabilities to remotely monitor patients in real-time and to communicate recommendations and medication adjustments using personal mobile devices, such as smartphones, rather than waiting until the next office visit.&lt;ref&gt;Marisa Torrieri, [http://www.physicianspractice.com/technology/content/article/1462168/2099609 "Patient compliance: technology tools for physicians"] ''Physicians Practice'', September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medication Event Monitoring Systems, as in the form of smart medicine bottle tops, smart pharmacy vials or smart blister packages as used in clinical trials and other applications where exact compliance data are required, work without any patient input, and record the time and date the bottle or vial was accessed, or the medication removed from a blister package. The data can be read via proprietary readers, or NFC enabled devices, such as smartphones or tablets. A 2009 study stated that such devices can help improve adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Santschi|first=V|author2=Chiolero, A |author3=Burnier, M |title=Electronic monitors of drug adherence: tools to make rational therapeutic decisions.|journal=Journal of Hypertension|date=Nov 2009|volume=27|issue=11|pages=2294–5; author reply 2295|pmid=20724871|doi=10.1097/hjh.0b013e328332a501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and disease management==
A [[WHO]] study estimates that only 50% of patients suffering from chronic diseases in developed countries follow treatment recommendations.&lt;ref name=WhoReport/&gt; The

Asthma non-compliance (28–70% worldwide) increases the risk of severe asthma attacks requiring preventable ER visits and hospitalisations; compliance issues with asthma can be caused by a variety of reasons including: difficult inhaler use, side effects of medications, and cost of the treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bender BG, Bender SE | year = 2005 | title = Patient-identified barriers to asthma treatment adherence: responses to interviews, focus groups, and questionnaires | url = | journal = Immunol Allergy Clin North Am | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 107–130 | doi=10.1016/j.iac.2004.09.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
200,000 new cases of cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK. One in three adults in the UK will develop cancer that can be life-threatening, and 120,000 people will be killed by their cancer each year. This accounts for 25% of all deaths in the UK. However while 90% of cancer pain can be effectively treated, only 40% of patients adhere to their medicines due to poor understanding.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The reasons for non-adherence have been given by patients as follows:
* The poor quality of information available to them about their treatment{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* A lack of knowledge as to how to raise concerns whilst on medication{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* Concerns about unwanted effects{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}
* Issues about remembering to take medication{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Partridge ''et al'' (2002) identified evidence to show that adherence rates in cancer treatment are variable, and sometimes surprisingly poor. The following table is a summary of their findings:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Partridge AH, Avorn J, Wang PS, Winer EP |year=2002 |title=Adherence to therapy with oral antineoplastic agents |journal=Journal of the National Cancer Institute |volume=94 |issue=9 |pages=652–61 |doi=10.1093/jnci/94.9.652 |pmid=11983753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 90% after one year
* 83% after two years
* 74% after four years

===Diabetes===
Patients with diabetes are at high risk of developing coronary heart disease and usually have related conditions that make their treatment regimens even more complex, such as hypertension, obesity and depression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Lustman PJ, Griffiths LS, Clouse RE |year=1997 |title=Depression in adults with diabetes |journal=Seminars in Clinical Neuropsychiatry |volume=2 |pages=15–23|pmid=10320439|issue=1|doi=10.1053/SCNP00200015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are also characterised by poor rates of adherence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ciechanowski PS, Katon WJ, Russo JE |year=2000 |title=Depression and diabetes: impact of depression symptoms pn adherence, function, and costs |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=27 |pages=3278–85 |doi=10.1001/archinte.160.21.3278 |issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypertension===
* Hypertension non-compliance (93% in US, 70% in UK){{citation needed|date=December 2017}} is the main cause of uncontrolled hypertension-associated heart attack and stroke.

As a result of poor compliance,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} 75% of patients with a diagnosis of hypertension do not achieve optimum blood-pressure control.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Mental illness===
A 2003 review found that 41–59% of mentally ill patients took their medication infrequently or not at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Dolder CR, Lacro JP, Leckband S, Jeste DV |year=2003 |title=Interventions to improve antipsychotic medication adherence: Review of recent literature |journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=389–399|doi=10.1097/01.jcp.0000085413.08426.41|pmid=12920416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alternative frequency''' (or '''AF''') is an option that allows a receiver to re-tune to a different [[frequency]] that provides the same station, when the first [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] becomes too weak (e.g. when moving out of range). This is often used in car [[Receiver (home stereo)|stereo system]]s, enabled by [[Radio Data System]] (RDS), or the [[United States|U.S.]]-based [[Radio Broadcast Data System]] ([[RBDS]]).

'''Alu''' (Chinese: 阿鲁) is an unclassified [[Loloish language]] of [[Yunnan]], [[China]]. It is spoken in [[Jinping Miao, Yao, and Dai Autonomous County]], [[Lüchun County]], [[Jiangcheng Hani and Yi Autonomous County]], and [[Yuanyang County, Yunnan]]. The Alu are also referred to by other ethnic groups as Luwu 鲁乌 or Luowu 倮乌.&lt;ref name="wanmin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wanmin.org/minzu/alu|title=阿鲁民族 - 万民网|website=wanmin.org|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also 500 to 600 Alu people in two villages of Ou Tay District, Phongsali province.&lt;ref name&gt;Schliesinger, Joachim. 2003. Ethnic Groups of Laos. Vol. 4: Sino-Tibetan-Speaking Peoples. Bangkok: White Lotus Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alu also have a [[mouth organ]] with five pipes that they play during the "Abei festival 阿卑节" ("maiden festival").&lt;ref name="yixueyanjiu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yixueyanjiu.com/news/13/z_13_24201.html|website=yixueyanjiu.com|title=红河金平"姑娘节" 彝族阿鲁人的情人节_彝学研究网|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[https://www.academia.edu/35542553/The_Lawu_languages_footprints_along_the_Red_River_valley_corridor The Lawu languages: footprints along the Red River valley corridor]''.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that Awu may be related to [[Lalo language|Lalo]], but that this is uncertain due to the lack of data.

'''Anna Ovena Hoyer''' (born: Anke Hanß, aka Anna Ovena Hoyers, [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Anna Orena Höijer'') ([[Koldenbüttel]] on [[Eiderstedt|Ejdersted]] peninsula 1584 – 27 November 1655) was a writer and [[poet]], originally German; active in [[Sweden]] from 1632. She belonged to the [[anabaptist]]s and was a critic of [[Lutheranism]].

== Biography ==

Hoyer was the only child of the wealthy Hans Owens (aka Johann Oven) and his wife Wennecke Hunnens was educated in [[astronomy]], literature and the Classics. She married Hermann Hoyer, [[stadtholder]] in Ejdersted, with whom she had at least nine children. With her [[dowry]], amounting to 100,000 [[rixdollar]] of [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck]] fineness, she helped to repay debts charged on her spouse's estates. She inherited the manor Hoyersworth (a part of today's [[Oldenswort]]) in the North Sea coastal [[marsh]]es at Hermann Hoyer's death on 13 September 1622.

She was influenced by Indian religion in her reluctance to kill anything living, and became influenced by the [[sectarians]] [[Nicolaus Knutzen Teting]] and [[Hartvig Lehmann]], religious refugees from [[Flensborg]], whom she gave asylum. She refused to participate in the church services and held her own. She ruined herself on [[charity (practice)|charity]]. In 1632, she sold her estate to [[Augusta of Denmark]] and fled to Sweden, where she became a protégée of the queen, [[Maria Eleonora of Brandenburg]]. In 1634 she visited Hoyersworth and experienced in October the devastating [[Burchardi flood]]. In Sweden she resided in [[Västervik]] and thereafter at a little property outside Stockholm until her death.

'''Arutani''' (''Orotani, Urutani,'' also known as ''Awake, Auake, Auaqué, Aoaqui, Oewaku,'' ethnonym ''Uruak'') is a nearly extinct language spoken by only 17 individuals in [[Roraima]], [[Brazil]] and two others in the Karum River area of [[Bolivar State]], [[Venezuela]].

{{Evidence law}}
In [[law]], '''cross-examination''' is the interrogation of a [[witness]] called by one's opponent. It is preceded by [[direct examination]] (in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] known as [[examination-in-chief]]) and may be followed by a [[Redirect examination|redirect]] ([[re-examination]] in [[England]], [[Scotland]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]], [[India]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Pakistan]]).

== Variations by jurisdiction ==
In the [[Federal judiciary of the United States|United States federal Courts]], a cross-examining [[lawyer|attorney]] is typically not permitted to ask questions that do not pertain to the testimony offered during direct examination, but most [[State court (United States)|state courts]] do permit a lawyer to cross-examine a witness on matters not raised during direct examination. Similarly, courts in England, South Africa, Australia, and Canada allow a cross-examiner to exceed the scope of direct examination.

Since a witness called by the opposing party is presumed to be [[hostile witness|hostile]], cross-examination does permit [[leading question]]s. A witness called by the direct examiner, on the other hand, may only be treated as hostile by that examiner after being permitted to do so by the judge, at the request of that examiner and as a result of the witness being openly antagonistic and/or prejudiced against the opposing party.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrhardt, Charles W. and Stephanie J. Young, [http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/issues/232/ehrhardt.html "Using Leading Questions During Direct Examination"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081103082145/http://www.law.fsu.edu/journals/lawreview/issues/232/ehrhardt.html |date=2008-11-03 }}, Florida State University Law Review, 1996. Accessed November 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Affecting the outcome of jury trials ==
Cross-examination is a key component in a trial and the topic is given substantial attention during courses on [[Trial Advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Lubet, Steven; ''Modern Trial Advocacy'', NITA, New York, NY 2004 pp. 83 et. seq. {{ISBN|1556818866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinions by a jury or judge are often changed during cross examination if doubt is cast on the witness. In other times a credible witness affirms the belief in their original statements or in some cases enhances the judge's or jury's belief. Though the closing argument is often considered the deciding moment of a trial, effective cross-examination wins trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Relentless Criminal Cross-Examination| last=Mahoney| first=Kevin J| location=Costa Mesa, California| publisher=James Publishing| year=2008| isbn=158012125X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorneys anticipate [[hostile witness]]' responses during pretrial planning, and often attempt to shape the witnesses' perception of the questions to draw out information helpful to the attorney's case.&lt;ref&gt;Dreier, A.S.; ''Strategy, Planning &amp; Litigating to Win''; Conatus, Boston, MA, 2012, pp. 79-85; {{ISBN|0615676952}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically during an attorney's [[closing argument]] he will repeat any admissions made by witnesses that favor their case. Indeed, in the United States, cross-examination is seen as a core part of the entire [[adversarial system]] of justice, in that it "is the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the truth of his testimony are tested."&lt;ref&gt;''Davis v. Alaska'', {{ussc|415|308|1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another key component affecting a trial outcome is the [[jury selection]], in which attorneys will attempt to include jurors from whom they feel they can get a favorable response or at the least unbiased fair decision. So while there are many factors affecting the outcome of a trial, the cross-examination of a witness will often influence an open-minded unbiased jury searching for the certainty of facts upon which to base their decision.

Formally, the reference [[context-free grammar]] of the language is [[ambiguous grammar|ambiguous]], meaning there is more than one correct [[parse tree]].

In many [[programming language]]s one may write conditionally executed code in two forms: the if-then form, and the if-then-else form – the else clause is optional:
 '''if''' a '''then''' s
 '''if''' b '''then''' s1 '''else''' s2

This gives rise to an ambiguity in interpretation when there are nested statements, specifically whenever an if-then form appears as &lt;code&gt;s1&lt;/code&gt; in an if-then-else form:

 '''if''' a '''then''' '''if''' b '''then''' s '''else''' s2
In this example, &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; is unambiguously executed when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is true and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is true, but one may interpret &lt;code&gt;s2&lt;/code&gt; as being executed when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is false (thus attaching the else to the first if) or when &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is true and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is false (thus attaching the else to the second if). In other words, one may see the previous statement as either of the following expressions:
 '''if''' a '''then''' ('''if''' b '''then''' s) '''else''' s2
 '''if''' a '''then''' ('''if''' b '''then''' s '''else''' s2)

The dangling else problem dates to [[ALGOL 60]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Abrahams |first1= P. W. |title= A final solution to the Dangling else of ALGOL 60 and related languages |doi= 10.1145/365813.365821 |journal= Communications of the ACM |volume= 9 |issue= 9 |pages= 679 |year= 1966 |pmid= |pmc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been resolved in various ways in subsequent languages. In [[LR parser]]s, the dangling else is the archetypal example of a [[shift-reduce conflict]].

==Avoiding ambiguity while keeping the syntax==

This is a problem that often comes up in [[compiler design|compiler construction]], especially [[scannerless parsing]]. The convention when dealing with the dangling else is to attach the else to the nearby if statement,&lt;ref name="Bison Manual"&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Shift_002fReduce.html#Shift_002fReduce 5.2 Shift/Reduce Conflicts] from [[GNU Operating System]] web site&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for unambiguous context-free grammars, in particular. Programming languages like Pascal&lt;ref&gt;ISO 7185:1990 (Pascal) 6.8.3.4: ''An if-statement without an else-part shall not be immediately followed by the token else.''&lt;/ref&gt;, C&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/standards ISO 9899]:1999 (C): 6.8.4.1(3): "An else is associated with the lexically nearest preceding if that is allowed by the syntax.", available at [http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf WG14 N1256], p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; and Java&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Java Language Specification, Java SE 9 Edition, 14.5. Statements|url=https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se9/html/jls-14.html|ref=jls-14.5}}&lt;/ref&gt; follow this convention, so there is no ambiguity in the semantics of the ''language'', though the use of a parser generator may lead to ambiguous ''grammars''. In these cases alternative grouping is accomplished by explicit blocks, such as &lt;code&gt;begin...end&lt;/code&gt; in Pascal&lt;ref&gt;''Pascal,'' Nell Dale and Chip Weems, "Dangling Else", [https://books.google.com/books?id=5x2k4vWwn1wC&amp;pg=PA160 p. 160–161]&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{...}&lt;/code&gt; in C.

Depending on the compiler construction approach, one may take different corrective actions to avoid ambiguity:

*If the parser is produced by an SLR, LR(1) or LALR [[LR parser]] generator, the programmer will often rely on the generated parser feature of preferring shift over reduce whenever there is a conflict.&lt;ref name="Bison Manual"/&gt; Alternatively, the grammar can be rewritten to remove the conflict, at the expense of an increase in grammar size (see [[#Avoiding the conflict in LR parsers|below]]).
*If the parser is produced by a Pruning and Deep Pruning LR generator, one can issue directives that prune away the ambiguities completely.&lt;ref name="Pruning in Wormhole"&gt;http://www.mightyheave.com/blog/?p=17#more-17&lt;/ref&gt;
*If the parser is hand written, the programmer may use a ''non-ambiguous'' context-free grammar. Alternatively, one may rely on a non-context-free grammar or a [[parsing expression grammar]].

==Avoiding ambiguity by changing the syntax==
The problem can also be solved by making explicit the link between an else and its if, within the syntax. This usually helps avoid human errors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://code.google.com/p/copute/issues/detail?id=21#c2 Ambiguity of dangling else: non-context-free grammars are semantically opaque]&lt;/ref&gt;

Possible solutions are:
*Having an "end if" statement. Examples of such languages are [[ALGOL 68]], [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[PL/SQL]], [[Visual Basic]], and [[Modula-2]].
*Disallowing the statement following a "then" to be an "if" itself (it may however be a pair of statement brackets containing only an if-then-clause). This approach is followed by [[ALGOL 60]].&lt;ref&gt;''4.5.1 Conditional Statements — Syntax'' in P. Nauer (ed.), ''Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language ALGOL 60'', CACM 6,1, 1963 pp. 1-17&lt;/ref&gt;
*Requiring braces (parenthesizing) when an "else" follows an "if".&lt;ref&gt;[https://code.google.com/p/copute/issues/detail?id=21#c1 Ambiguity of dangling else: require braces when else follows if]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is effectively true in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] as its indentation rules delimit every block, not just those in "if" statements.
*Requiring every "if" to be paired with an "else".
*Using different keywords for the one-alternative and two-alternative "if" statements. [[S-algol]] uses &lt;code&gt;if e do s&lt;/code&gt; for the one-alternative case and &lt;code&gt;if e1 then e2 else e3&lt;/code&gt; for the general case.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Davie|first=Antony J. T.|author2=Ronald Morrison |editor=Brian Meek|title=Recursive Descent Compiling|series=Ellis Horwood series in computers and their applications|year=1981|publisher=Ellis Horwood|location=Chichester, West Sussex|isbn=0-470-27270-8|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Require braces unconditionally, like [[Swift (programming language)|Swift]].

==Examples==
Concrete examples follow.

===C===
In [[C_(programming_language)|C]], the grammar reads, in part:
&lt;pre&gt;
 statement = ...
    | selection-statement

 selection-statement = ...
    | IF ( expression ) statement
    | IF ( expression ) statement ELSE statement&lt;/pre&gt;

Thus, without further rules, the statement
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C"&gt;
if (a) if (b) s; else s2;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
could ambiguously be parsed as if it were either:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C"&gt;
if (a)
{
  if (b)
    s;
  else
    s2;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
or:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="C"&gt;
if (a)
{
  if (b)
    s;
}
else
  s2;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
In practice in C the first tree is chosen, by associating the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; with the nearest &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;.

==Avoiding the conflict in LR parsers==
The above example could be rewritten in the following way to remove the ambiguity:
&lt;pre&gt;
statement: open_statement
         | closed_statement
         ;

open_statement: IF '(' expression ')' statement
              | IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE open_statement
              ;

closed_statement: non_if_statement
                | IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE closed_statement
                ;

non_if_statement: ...
                ;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Any other statement-related grammar rules may also have to be duplicated in this way if they may directly or indirectly end with a &lt;code&gt;statement&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;selection-statement&lt;/code&gt; non-terminal.

However, we give grammar that includes both of if and while statements.

&lt;pre&gt;
statement: open_statement
         | closed_statement
         ;

open_statement: IF '(' expression ')' statement
              | IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE open_statement
              | WHILE '(' expression ')' open_statement
              ;

closed_statement: simple_statement
                | IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE closed_statement
                | WHILE '(' expression ')' closed_statement
                ;

simple_statement: ...
                ;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, we give the grammar that forbids ambiguous IF statements.

&lt;pre&gt;
statement: open_statement
         | closed_statement
         ;

open_statement: IF '(' expression ')' simple_statement
              | IF '(' expression ')' open_statement
              | IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE open_statement
              | WHILE '(' expression ')' open_statement
              ;

closed_statement: simple_statement
                | IF '(' expression ')' closed_statement ELSE closed_statement
                | WHILE '(' expression ')' closed_statement
                ;

simple_statement: ...
                ;
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:Lincoln Beer Stamp 1871.JPG|thumb|1871 Beer excise stamp]]
An '''excise stamp''' is a type of [[revenue stamp]] affixed to some exciseable goods to indicate that the required [[excise]] tax has been paid by the manufacturer. They are [[Security (finance)|securities]] printed by the finance ministry of the relevant country.

== Security measures ==
Excise stamps are often as detailed in their design as banknotes - usually made from the same [[Cotton paper|type]] of paper and containing [[holograms]] and other [[Counterfeit#Anti-counterfeiting measures|anti-counterfeit]] devices. The reason for such measures is that excise duty is extremely expensive, in most [[European Union|EU]] countries accounting for around half the [[market price]] of the product.

== Usage ==
Excise stamps are most commonly found on [[tobacco]] and [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] products, which reach the consumer in neatly packaged units (namely packets and bottles) to which the adhesive stamp is easily affixed.&lt;ref&gt;Unlike petrol, for example, which, despite being subject to excise, has no packaging to which a stamp may be affixed, nor is it exposed to the same dangers of counterfeiting as are alcohol and tobacco.&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[counterfeit]] alcohol and cigarettes are extremely common in many countries, the presence of a genuine excise stamp also goes some way towards guaranteeing the genuineness of the product, as only certified producers may legally buy excise stamps. (However, illegally obtained or counterfeit stamps are common in some countries.)

Manufacturers will buy a certain quantity of excise stamps from the government at their excise value which they are then obliged to affix to every packet of [[cigarettes]] or bottle of [[Distilled beverage|spirits]] produced. The excise stamps are ideally affixed with strong glue over the cap of a bottle or across the lid of a box of cigarettes (and underneath the plastic/foil wrapper on the bottleneck or the cellophane of the cigarette-box) in such a way that they are destroyed when the product is opened. This is so that they cannot be reused, since this would constitute [[contraband]].

In countries where excise stamps are required, all cigarettes and alcohol produced legally will bear a stamp. Some countries have separate stamps for [[wikt:domestic|domestically]]-produced and [[import]]ed excisable goods; others require separate stamps for products destined for [[duty-free]] sale, which are still subject to excise but not [[VAT]]; some countries do not require stamps for [[wine]]s, while others do.

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the [[UK]], excise stamps have been in use for spirits since 2006.&lt;sup&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090326180921/http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/stellent/groups/internet/%40inter/documents/publicnotice/~export/HMCE_PROD1_025107~10~ENG_TOC~PORTALSPILAYOUT/78051-3.jpg (view image)]&lt;/sup&gt; While these are usually printed on the back label of the bottle by the manufacturer rather than being a special security bought from the government, they still have to adhere to strict specifications, such as containing [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-visible inks.&lt;ref name="duty"&gt;[http://customs.hmrc.gov.uk/channelsPortalWebApp/channelsPortalWebApp.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pageExcise_ShowContent&amp;id=HMCE_PROD1_025107&amp;propertyType=document UK Duty Stamps Scheme], June 2006, retrieved Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[UK law]] does not require such physical stamps for cigarettes, either - instead, the words "UK Duty Paid" are printed in bold on all packs as part of the manufacturing process, while other forms of control are implemented by [[HM Revenue &amp; Customs]] to verify that this is indeed the case. Meanwhile, foreign-bought cigarette packets bearing revenue stamps can be widely seen across the UK, mainly due to the comparatively high price of British cigarettes, leading people to (often illegally) import them from abroad.

{{Wiktionary|feck|feckless}}
'''''Feck''''' (or, in some senses, '''''fek''''' or '''''feic''''') has several [[vernacular]] meanings and variations in [[Hiberno-English]], [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Middle English]].

==Modern English==
* Slang [[Profanity|expletive]] employed as an attenuated alternative ([[minced oath]]) to ''[[fuck]]'' to express disbelief, pain, anger, or contempt in a given situation. However, it does not mean to have sex with in the same way that fuck does, and those aware of this use consider it a lesser expletive than fuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/feck?q=feck |title=feck - definition of feck in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Verb]] meaning 'to steal' (e.g., 'They had fecked cash out of the rector's room.'&lt;ref&gt;[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man|''Portrait of the Artist'']], [[James Joyce]], (1964) p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0voNAAAAQAAJ&amp;lpg=PA310&amp;dq=feck%20slang&amp;lr=&amp;pg=PA310#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=The Routledge Dictionary of Historical Slang - Eric Partridge |publisher=Books.google.ie |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Verb]] meaning in Irish slang 'to throw' (e.g., 'He's got no manners at all. I asked him nicely for the remote control, and he fecked it across the table at me.')

==Scots and Late Middle English==
'''''Feck''''' (or '''''fek''''' or '''''feic''''') is a form of ''effeck'', which is in turn the Scots cognate of the modern English word [[wikt:en:Effect|effect]]. However, this Scots noun has additional significance:
# Efficacy; force; value; [[Return on investment|return]]
# Amount; quantity (or a large amount/quantity)
# The greater or larger part (when used with a [[Article (grammar)|definite article]])

From the first sense we derive ''[[wikt:feckless|feckless]]'', meaning witless, weak or ineffective; worthless; irresponsible; indifferent; lazy. ''Feckless'' remains a part of the [[Modern English]] and [[Scottish English]] [[lexicon]]s; it appears in a number of Scottish [[adage]]s:

:"Feckless folk are aye fain o ane anither."

:"Feckless fools should keep canny tongues."

In his 1881 short story ''[[Thrawn Janet]]'', [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] invokes the second sense of ''feck'' as cited above:

:"He had a feck o' books wi' him—mair than had ever been seen before in a' that presbytery..."

[[Robert Burns]] uses the third sense of ''feck'' in the final [[stanza]] of his 1792 poem "Kellyburn Braes":

:I hae been a Devil the feck o' my life,
:Hey, and the rue grows bonie wi' thyme;
:"But ne'er was in hell till I met wi' a wife,"
:And the thyme it is wither'd, and rue is in prime

==Debate about the word's level of offensiveness==
[[Magners|Magners Irish Cider]] have received complaints relating to an advert in which a man tells bees to "feck off": members of the public were concerned that young children could be badly influenced by seeing this advert. [[Magners]] claimed that the "feck off" mention in the advert was a "mild rebuff" to the bees, rather than an [[Profanity|expletive]]. The [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)]] has ruled that the poster is suitable for display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.scotsman.com/latestnews/What-the-feck-Ad-gets.4777178.jp |title=What the feck! Ad gets the all-clear - The Scotsman |publisher=News.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1998 interview on [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]], Irish girl group ''[[B*Witched]]'' landed in hot water when a viewer made a complaint alleging that one of the teenagers had used the phrase "fuck off". Although Nickelodeon maintained that the singer had in fact said "feck off", which they described "a phrase made popular by the Channel 4 sitcom ''[[Father Ted]]''," the item was found to be in breach of the ITC Programme Code and the complaint was thus upheld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/itc/itc_publications/complaints_reports/programme_complaints/show_complaint.asp-prog_complaint_id=78.html |title=Programme Complaints &amp; Interventions Report |publisher=Ofcom.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The [[Channel 4]] situation comedy ''[[Father Ted]]'' helped to export and popularise this use of ''feck'' through its [[Fictional character|characters]]' liberal use of the word, especially by the drunk priest [[Father Jack Hackett|Father Jack]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

In 2004 [[FCUK|French Connection UK]], sellers of the popular "FCUK" [[T-shirt]], won a legal injunction in [[Dublin]] that barred a local business from printing and selling a T-shirt marked "FCEK The Irish Connection".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090502173838/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/article393415.ece] &lt;/ref&gt;

A system of [[grammatical gender]], whereby every [[noun]] was treated as either masculine, feminine or neuter, existed in [[Old English]], but fell out of use during the [[Middle English]] period. [[Modern English]] retains features relating to [[natural gender]], namely the use of certain nouns and [[pronoun]]s (such as ''he'' and ''she'') to refer specifically to persons or animals of one or other genders  and certain others (such as ''it'') for sexless objects – although [[#Personal pronouns|feminine pronouns]] are sometimes used when referring to ships (and more uncommonly some airplanes and analogous machinery) and nation states.

Some aspects of gender usage in English have been influenced by the movement towards a preference for [[gender-neutral language]]. This applies in particular to avoidance of the default use of the masculine ''he'' when referring to a person of unknown gender, usually using the neuter ''they'' as a third-person singular, and avoidance of the use of certain feminine forms of nouns (such as ''authoress'' and ''poetess''). Increasingly, the "male" form of such nouns is used for both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Angus (ed.) (2010). ''Oxford Dictionary of English'', 3rd Ed., Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York, p. 598. {{ISBN|978-0-19-957112-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender in Old English==
[[Old English]] had a system of grammatical gender similar to that of modern [[German language|German]], with three genders: masculine, feminine, neuter. [[determiner (class)|Determiner]]s and [[attributive adjective]]s showed gender inflection in [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the noun they modified. Also the nouns themselves followed different declension patterns depending on their gender. Moreover, the third-person [[personal pronouns]], as well as [[interrogative word|interrogative]] and [[relative pronoun]]s, were chosen according to the grammatical gender of their [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]].

Old English grammatical gender was, as in other [[Germanic languages]], remarkably opaque, that is, one often could not know the gender of a noun by its meaning or by the form of the word; this was especially true for nouns referencing inanimate objects.

Old English had multiple generic nouns for "woman" stretching across all 3 genders: for example, in addition to the neuter ''wif'' and the masculine ''wifmann'' listed above, there was also the feminine ''frowe''.&lt;ref name=jones /&gt;{{rp|6}} For the gender-neutral nouns for "child", there was the feminine ''byren'' in addition to the neuter ''bearn'' and the neuter ''cild'' (compare English ''child''). And even with nouns referring to persons, one could not always determine gender by meaning or form: for example, with 2 words ending in ''-mæg'', there was the female-specific '''neuter''' noun ''wynmæg'', meaning "winsome maid" or attractive woman; as well as the gender-neutral noun meaning "paternal kindred" or member of father's side of the family, but which was grammatically '''feminine''': ''fædernmæg''.&lt;ref name=jones /&gt;{{rp|7-8}}

For details of the declension patterns and pronoun systems, see [[Old English grammar]].

==Decline of grammatical gender==
By the 11th century, the role of grammatical gender in Old English was beginning to decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curzan|2003|pp=84, 86}}: "[T]he major gender shift for inanimate nouns in written texts occurs in late Old English/early Middle English, but {{Nowrap|[...]}} the seeds of change are already present in Old English before 1000 AD."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Middle English]] of the 13th century was in transition to the loss of a gender system.&lt;ref name=lass/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curzan|2003|p=86}}: "[G]rammatical gender remained healthy in the personal pronouns through late Old English; it is not until early Middle English that the balance of gender concord in the pronouns tips towards natural gender, at least in the written language."&lt;/ref&gt; One element of this process was the change in the functions of the words ''the'' and ''that'' (then spelt ''þe'' and ''þat''; see also [[Old English determiners]]): previously these had been non-neuter and neuter forms respectively of a single [[determiner]], but in this period ''the'' came to be used generally as a definite article and ''that'' as a [[demonstrative]]; both thus ceased to manifest any gender differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shinkawa|first=Seiji|title=Unhistorical Gender Assignment in Laʒamon's Brut|year=2012|publisher=Peter Lang|location=Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of gender classes was part of a general decay of [[Inflection#Examples in English|inflectional endings]] and [[Old English declension|declensional classes]] by the end of the 14th century.&lt;ref name=hellinger/&gt; While inflectional reduction seems to have been incipient in the English language itself, some theories suggest that it was accelerated by contact with Old Norse, especially in midland and northern dialects.&lt;ref name = "Curzan 2003 53"&gt;{{Harvnb|Curzan|2003|p=53}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender loss began in the north of England; the south-east and the south-west Midlands were the most linguistically conservative regions, and Kent retained traces of gender in the 1340s.&lt;ref name=lass&gt;{{cite book|last=Lass|first=Roger|editor=Richard M. Hogg, David Denison|title=A history of the English language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5FDi8WksqYC&amp;pg=PA70|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-66227-3|page=70|chapter=Phonology and morphology}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Middle English#Chancery Standard|Late 14th-century London English]] had almost completed the shift away from grammatical gender,&lt;ref name=lass/&gt; and Modern English retains no [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] agreement of words with grammatical gender.&lt;ref name=hellinger&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hellinger|first1=Marlis|last2=Bussmann|first2=Hadumod|title=Gender across languages: the linguistic representation of women and men|chapter=English — Gender in a global language|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBMX57viyRwC&amp;pg=PA107|volume=1|year=2001|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=90-272-1841-2|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern English==
Gender is no longer an inflectional category in [[Modern English]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum, ''[[The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]]'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; The only traces of the Old English gender system are found in the system of pronoun–antecedent [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]], although this is now based on natural gender&lt;ref&gt;
[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564210_2/English_Language.html 'English Language',] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwpdH4jo?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564210_2/English_Language.html |date=2009-11-01 }} ''Encarta'',
(Microsoft Corporation, 2007). "The distinctions of grammatical gender in English were replaced by those of natural gender.".  2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; – the [[sex]], gender identity, or perceived sexual characteristics, of the pronoun's [[reference|referent]]. Another manifestation of natural gender that continues to function in English is the use of certain nouns to refer specifically to persons or animals of a particular sex: ''widow/widower'', ''actor/actress'', etc.

[[Benjamin Whorf]] described grammatical gender in English as a [[Covert (linguistics)|covert]] grammatical category.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Lee Whorf, 'Grammatical Categories', ''Language'' 21 (1945): 1–11. See also Robert A. Hall Jr,
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/453074 'Sex Reference and Grammatical Gender in English'], ''American Speech'' 26 (1951): 170–172.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that gender as a property inherent in nouns (rather than in their referents) is not entirely absent from modern English: different pronouns may be appropriate for the same referent depending on what noun has been used.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Personal pronouns===
The third-person singular [[English personal pronouns|personal pronouns]] are chosen according to the natural gender of their [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] or [[reference|referent]]. As a general rule:
*''[[he]]'' (and its related forms ''him'', ''himself'', ''his'') is used when the referent is male, or something to which male characteristics are attributed;
*''[[she]]'' (and ''her'', ''herself'', ''hers'') is used when the referent is female, or something to which female characteristics are attributed – this is common especially with vessels such as [[ship]]s and airplanes, and sometimes with countries. An example is in ''[[God Bless America]]'': "Stand beside her, and guide her through the night with a light from above."
*''[[it (pronoun)|it]]'' (and ''itself'', ''its'') is used when the referent is something inanimate or intangible, a non-animal life-form such as a plant, an animal of unknown sex, or, less often, a child when the sex is unspecified or deemed unimportant.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} ''It'' is also used in the interrogative for people in some phrases such as, "Who is it?".

Pronoun agreement is often with the natural gender of the referent (the person or thing denoted) rather than simply the antecedent (a noun or [[noun phrase]] which the pronoun replaces). For example, one might say either ''the doctor and his patients'' or ''the doctor and her patients'', depending on one's knowledge or assumptions about the sex of the doctor in question, as the phrase ''the doctor'' (the antecedent) does not itself have any specific natural gender. Also, pronouns are sometimes used without any explicit antecedent. However, as noted above (the example with ''child'' and ''daughter''), the choice of pronoun may also be affected by the particular noun used in the antecedent.

(When the antecedent is a collective noun, such as ''family'' or ''team'', and the pronoun refers to the members of the group denoted rather than the group as a single entity, a [[plural]] pronoun may be chosen: compare ''the family and its origins''; ''the family and their breakfast-time arguments''. See also [[synesis]].)

Because there is no third-person singular gender-neutral pronoun for animate referents, problems arise when the referent is a person of unknown or unspecified sex. Traditionally the male forms ''he'' etc. or the singular ''they'' have been used in such situations, but in contemporary English (partly because of the movement towards gender-neutral language) the male forms are often avoided in this context, although they are still considered proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bernstein |first1=Theodore |title=The Careful Writer |date=1977 |publisher=Atheneum |location=New York |isbn=0689705557 |page=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible alternatives include:
*use of ''he or she'', ''he/she'', ''s/he'', etc.
*alternation or random mixture of use of ''she'' and ''he''
*use of [[singular they|singular ''they'']] (common especially in informal language)
*use of ''it'' (normally only considered when the referent is a young child)

Although the use of ''she'' and ''he'' for inanimate objects is not very frequent in Standard Modern English, it is in fact fairly widespread in some varieties of English.&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt; Gender assignment to inanimate nouns in these dialects is sometimes fairly systematic. For example, in some dialects of southwest England, masculine pronouns are used for individuated or countable matter, such as iron tools, while the neuter form is used for non-individuated matter, such as liquids, fire and other substances.&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Compare the similar Early Modern English formation which is typified in the prose of the [[King James Bible]] (or [[Authorized Version]]), here shewed in the Gospel of St Matthew, v,13: Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost '''his''' savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Animals====

In principle, animals are triple-gender nouns, being able to take masculine, feminine and neuter pronouns. However, animals viewed as less important to humans, also known as ‘lower animals’, are generally referred to using ''it''; higher (domestic) animals may more often be referred to using ''he'' and ''she'', when their sex is known.&lt;ref name=Siemund&gt;{{cite book |last=Siemund |first=Peter |title=Pronominal Gender in English: A Study of English Varieties form a Cross-Linguistic Perspective |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the sex of the animal is not known, the masculine pronoun is often used with a sex-neutral meaning.&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt; For example,

''Person A: Ah there’s an ant''

''Person B: Well put '''him''' outside''&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt;

Animate pronouns ''he'' and ''she'' are usually applied to animals when personification and/or individuation occurs.&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt; Personification occurs whenever human attributes are applied to the noun.&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt; For example:

	''A widow bird sat mourning for '''her''' love.''&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt;

Specifically named animals are an example of individuation, such as ''Peter Rabbit'' or ''Blob the Whale''.&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt; In these instances, it is more likely that animate pronouns ''he'' or ''she'' will be used to represent them.&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt;

These rules also apply to other triple-gender nouns, including ideas, inanimate objects, and words like ''infant'' and ''child''.&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt;

====Ships====
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Grammatical gender]] --&gt;
Traditionally, oceans, [[countries]], and [[ship]]s, even those named after men such as [[DDG-52|USS ''Barry'']],  have been referred to using the feminine pronouns. This usage is currently in decline (though still more common for ships, particularly in nautical usage, than for countries); in [[American English]] it is advised against by ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]''.&lt;ref name="Grossman 2003"&gt;{{citation |mode=cs1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EBMlLYwqmjYC&amp;q=%22it%20(rather%20than%20she%20or%20her)%20is%20generally%20preferred%22 |title=The Chicago Manual of Style |year=2003 |page=356 |editor-last=Grossman |editor-first=John |publisher=University of Chicago Press |edition=15th |isbn=978-0-226-10403-4 |lccn=2003001860 |oclc=51553085 |ol=15979229W |quote=When a pronoun is used to refer to a vessel, the neuter ''it'' (rather than ''she'' or ''her'') is generally preferred.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transgender persons====
Some [[genderqueer]] or similarly-identified people prefer not to use either ''he'' or ''she'', but a different pronoun such as [[singular they|they]], ''zie'', or so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Binkley |first1= Collin |title= Pick your own pronoun at university. |url= http://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20150919/281913066905634 |accessdate=24 April 2016 |work=Toronto Star |agency= Associated Press |publisher= Toronto Star |date=19 September 2015 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170218010206/http://www.pressreader.com/canada/toronto-star/20150919/281913066905634 |archivedate=2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other pronouns===
Other English pronouns are not subject to male/female distinctions, although in some cases a distinction between [[animacy|animate]] and inanimate referents is made. For example, the word ''[[who (pronoun)|who]]'' (as an [[interrogative word|interrogative]] or [[relative pronoun]]) refers to a person or people, and rarely to animals (although the possessive form ''whose'' can be used as a relative pronoun even when the antecedent is inanimate), while ''which'' and ''what'' refer to inanimate things (and non-human animals). Since these pronouns function on a binary gender system, distinguishing only between animate and inanimate entities, this suggests that English has a second gender system which contrasts with the primary gender system.&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt;
It should also be noted that relative and interrogative pronouns do not encode number. This is shown in the following example:

''The man '''who''' lost his head ''vs.'' the men '''who''' lost their heads''&lt;ref name=Siemund/&gt;

Other pronouns which show a similar distinction include ''everyone/everybody'' vs. ''everything'', ''no one/nobody'' vs. ''nothing'', etc.

===Gender-specific words===
Many words in modern English refer specifically to people or animals of a particular sex, although sometimes the specificity is being lost (for example, ''duck'' need not refer exclusively to a female bird; cf. [[Donald Duck]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Likewise, many feminine and masculine job titles (steward/stewardess, waiter/waitress) have undergone a process of becoming gender-neutralised in recent decades (see below).

An example of an English word that has retained gender-specific spellings is the noun-form of blond/blonde, with the former being masculine and the latter being feminine.

==Gender neutrality in English==
{{main article|Gender neutrality in English}}
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
Gender neutrality in English became a growing area of interest among academics during [[Second Wave Feminism]], when the work of [[structural linguistics|structuralist]] linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], and his theories on [[semiotics]], became more well known in academic circles. By the 1960s and 1970s, [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] theorists, particularly in France, brought wider attention to gender-neutrality theory, and the concept of supporting gender equality through conscious changes to language. Feminists analyzing the English language put forward their own theories about the power of language to create and enforce gender determinism and the marginalization of the feminine. Debates touched on such issues as changing the term "stewardess" to the gender-neutral "flight attendant", "fireman" to "fire fighter", "mailman" to "mail carrier", and so on. At the root of this contentiousness may have been feminists' backlash{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} against the English language's shift from "grammatical gender" to "natural gender" during the early Modern era&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meyer|first=Charles F.|title=Introducing English Linguistics International Student Edition|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521152211|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; coinciding with the spread of institutional prescriptive grammar rules in English schools. These theories have been challenged by some researchers, with attention given to additional possible social, ethnic, economic, and cultural influences on language and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Curzan|2003|pp=39, 151, 156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact on mainstream language has been limited,&lt;ref name = "Cameron 1992 29"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cameron|1992|p=29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; yet has led to lasting changes in practice.

Features of gender-neutral language in English may include:
*Avoidance of [[gender-specific job title]]s, or caution in their use;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lessons-gender-usage/|title=English Grammar Lessons - Gender Usage - ELC|date=2017-06-07|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Avoidance of the use of ''man'' and ''mankind'' to refer to humans in general;
*Avoidance of the use of ''he'', ''him'' and ''his'' when referring to a person of unspecified sex (see under {{slink||Personal pronouns}} above).

Certain naming practices (such as the use of ''Mrs'' and ''Miss'' to distinguish married and unmarried women) may also be discouraged on similar grounds. For more details and examples, see [[Gender neutrality in English]].

[[Philipp Franz von Siebold]] at [[Dejima]] with his Japanese wife Kusumoto Otaki and their baby-daughter [[Kusumoto Ine]] observing a Dutch ship towed into Nagasaki harbour using a ''teresukoppu'' ([[telescope]]).]]

'''Japanese words of Dutch origin''' started to develop when the [[Dutch East India Company]] initiated trading in Japan from the [[factory (trading post)|factory]] of [[Hirado]] in 1609. In 1640, the Dutch were transferred to [[Dejima]], and from then on until 1854 remained the only Westerners allowed access to Japan, during Japan's ''"[[sakoku]]"'' seclusion period.

Numerous exchanges occurred, leading to a branch of Western learning in Japan known as ''[[rangaku]]'' (蘭学), or "Dutch learning" where the "ran" (蘭) in ''rangaku'' comes from "Oranda" the Japanese word for [[Holland]], and means Dutch while "gaku" (学) is of Sino-Japanese origin and means "Learning".&lt;ref name="Loveday"/&gt; In the process, a number of terms were adopted from Dutch into the Japanese language. At one point, some 3,000 words are thought to have been used, especially in the areas of technical and scientific vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Loveday"/&gt; About 160 such words of Dutch origin remain in use today in standard Japanese.&lt;ref name="Loveday"/&gt;

'''Gwynfor Richard Evans''' (1 September 1912 – 21 April 2005) was a Welsh politician, lawyer and author. He was President of the Welsh political party [[Plaid Cymru]] for thirty six years and was the first [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] to represent it at [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Westminster]], which he did twice, from 1966 to 1970, and again from 1974 to 1979.

==Early life==
Gwynfor Evans was born in [[Barry, Wales|Barry]], near [[Cardiff]], to Dan Evans and Catherine Richard. He had a brother named Alcwyn, and a sister named Ceridwen. His father ran a chain of shops in Barry, and his mother a china shop. His mother was a fluent Welsh speaker. As a boy, he was educated at Gladstone Road School. Later on he was educated at Barry County School, where he was captain of the school's cricket and hockey teams. At the school he began learning the [[Welsh language]], but did not become fully fluent until the age of seventeen.

Evans studied at the [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]] and at [[St John's College, Oxford]], from where he qualified as a lawyer. During his time at St John's, he became a member of the [[Dafydd ap Gwilym]] society there. He was also a [[Market gardening|market garden]]er. He was a teenager when the Welsh nationalist party [[Plaid Cymru]] was founded in 1925, and he founded a branch of the party while he was at Oxford.  He became the party's president in 1945 and retained the office until 1981.

A [[pacifism|pacifist]], he became active in Heddychwyr Cymru, a Welsh organisation closely associated with the [[Peace Pledge Union]], serving as secretary and editor of a series of pamphlets throughout the [[Second World War]]. A committed Christian also, he declared himself a [[conscientious objector]], and was required to appear before a tribunal which, recognising the firmness of his beliefs, registered him unconditionally.

Evans is credited with keeping Plaid Cymru going through the lean years of the 1940s and 1950s. In the 1950s, he campaigned unsuccessfully for a [[Welsh parliament]], and failed to prevent the damming of the [[Tryweryn]] River and consequent inundation of the Welsh-speaking community of [[Capel Celyn]] to supply the city of [[Liverpool]] with water, a ''cause célèbre'' in Wales in the early 1960s.

In 1962, [[Wales West and North Television]], a group in which Evans was one of the leading figures, won the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchise for western and northern Wales, but the venture failed because of financial difficulties, and the company was merged with [[Television Wales and the West]], with western and northern Wales merged with the rest of Wales and the West of England,
as a separate sub-region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Jeremy|title=WWN History|url=http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/itw/WWN/history.html|work=Independent TeleWeb|accessdate=25 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Electoral record==

===Local Government and first parliamentary contests===
[[File:1959 Election in Merioneth.jpg|right|thumb|Evans speaking in Merioneth, during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 UK Election]]]]
Evans was elected to [[Carmarthenshire]] County Council in 1949, keeping his seat for the next 25 years, usually as the lone Plaid Cymru representative, acquiring the nickname "Evans dual carriageway" for his emphasis on improving transport links. In [[1973 Dyfed County Council election|1973]], following the abolition of Carmarthenshire County Council, Evans failed to be elected to the new Dyfed County Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Western Mail|date=13 April 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evans contested [[Merioneth (UK Parliament constituency)|Merioneth]] at the general elections of [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945]], [[United Kingdom general election, 1950|1950]], [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959]], and the [[Aberdare by-election, 1954]].

===Carmarthen by-election, 1966===

In 1964 Evans transferred his candidature to Carmarthen. On 14 July 1966, Evans won the parliamentary seat of [[Carmarthen (UK Parliament constituency)|Carmarthen]] from [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] in a by-election caused by the death of Lady [[Megan Lloyd George]], daughter of the former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] Prime Minister, [[David Lloyd George]], having come third in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|general election]] just a few weeks before. He had also contested the seat at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]]. His by-election victory is regarded as a seminal moment for Plaid Cymru. He was shown around the House of Commons by fellow pacifist [[Emrys Hughes]], the son-in-law of [[Keir Hardie]]; on pointing out the Welsh Labour table in the Commons' tea room, Hughes warned him, "You'd better not sit down there, your name's mud among that lot."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-1579591,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later electoral record===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]] Evans lost his Carmarthen seat to [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]'s [[Gwynoro Jones]] and failed to regain it in the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]] by only three votes. He regained the seat, with a majority of 3,640 votes, in the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 general election]], when he returned to Parliament accompanied by two other Plaid Cymru MPs, [[Dafydd Wigley]] and [[Dafydd Elis Thomas]].

Evans lost Carmarthen once more at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], to [[Roger Thomas (British politician)|Dr Roger Thomas]] (also Labour). He was unsuccessful in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], and did not contest any further elections.

==Career as an MP==
In the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], Evans was true to his pacifist principles in being one of the few MPs to oppose the British government's support of the Nigerian federal government with supplies of weapons in the civil war against [[Biafra]] (1967–1970). He also opposed the [[Vietnam War]]: after being denied entry to the country as part of an inspection group, he instead protested outside a US air base in [[Thailand]].

Evans was the first (and last) president of the [[Celtic League (political organisation)|Celtic League]] 1961–71. Dr. [[Robert McIntyre]] of the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] was vice-president at the time.

==Later life==
In 1980, his threat to go on [[hunger strike]], after the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government reneged on its election promise of a [[Welsh language]] television channel, was instrumental in bringing about an early U-turn on the part of [[Margaret Thatcher]], and [[S4C]] began broadcasting on 1 November 1982.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12062288&lt;/ref&gt;

In his political retirement he became a prolific writer, mainly on Welsh subjects and writing in Welsh with simultaneous or later English editions. His work ''Aros Mae'' (''It Endures'') (published 1971), a comprehensive history of Wales, and the English-language version ''Land of my Fathers: 2000 Years of Welsh History'' (published 1974), had already become best-sellers.

==Personal life==
In 1941 Evans married Rhiannon Prys Thomas, who survived him by nine months, dying on 13 January 2006. They had seven children.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/mid/4610138.stm&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter, [[Meinir Ffransis|Meinir]], became a prominent Welsh-language activist, and married [[Ffred Ffransis]].

==Death==
On 21 April 2005, Evans died at his home in [[Pencarreg]], at the age of 92.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/2002565.stm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/gwynfor-evans-495883.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/obituaries/story/0,,1465990,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,60-1579591,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/04/22/db2201.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2005/04/22/ixportal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On his death the Welsh political establishment united in paying its respects to Gwynfor Evans:
*''"Without Gwynfor Evans at the helm Plaid Cymru may not have survived to see electoral success in later years. His influence was felt beyond the confines of party politics. Wales would not be the nation it is today — perhaps would not be counted as a nation at all — if not for Gwynfor Evans."'' — [[Dafydd Iwan]], President of Plaid Cymru.
*''"Although his relationships with Labour MPs were not always positive, there is no gainsaying his massive contribution to Welsh public life, and particularly in raising the profile of Wales and Welsh issues throughout his long career in Welsh and British politics."'' – [[Rhodri Morgan]], [[First Minister of Wales|First Minister]] of the [[Welsh Government]] ([[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]).
*''"Gwynfor Evans made a distinguished contribution to Welsh public life and will be remembered particularly for his advancement of the Welsh language."'' – [[Peter Hain]], [[Secretary of State for Wales]] (Labour).
*''"Wales has lost one of its most significant figures of modern times. Gwynfor Evans was a highly respected figure who made a major contribution to Welsh politics. His record on delivering Welsh language broadcasting for Wales is of particular importance."'' – [[Nick Bourne]], Leader of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Welsh Conservative Party]].
*''"Gwynfor served his party well and was able to bring them into electoral success. He earned respect from across the political spectrum. His passing marks the end of a chapter in Welsh political history".'' – [[Mike German, Baron German|Mike German]], Leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Welsh Liberal Democrats]].
*A campaign has been launched to build a permanent monument to Gwynfor Evans in Carmarthen. In 2005 it was suggested that a statue be erected in Nott Square in the town, replacing that of [[William Nott (British general)|Sir William Nott]].&lt;ref&gt;''Icons of Wales'', 2012 booklet published jointly by the [[Open University]] and [[BBC Wales]]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A campaign by local primary school teacher Gwenno Hughes to establish a permanent memorial to Gwynfor Evans in the town of his birth culminated in the unveiling of a bronze bust created by the sculptor John Meirion Morris at [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]] Library in 2010. The cost of the memorial was raised by the staff of the local school [[Baruc|Ysgol Gymraeg Sant Baruc]].

'''Hermogenes Ilagan''' (19 April 1873 in [[Balagtas, Bulacan|Bigaa, Bulacan]] – 27 February 1943) was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[tenor]], writer, stage actor, and playwright. He was a [[Lineal descendant|descendant]] of [[Francisco Baltazar]]. His talent in singing made him popular in the field of [[theater arts]]. He became known as the Father of [[Tagalog Zarzuela]] and the Father of [[Philippine Zarzuela]].&lt;ref name=Panitikan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://panitikan.com.ph/authors/i/hilagan.htm|title=Hermogenes Ilagan|publisher=panitikan.com.ph|accessdate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Ilagan was a ''[[tiple]]'' ([[boy soprano|treble]] or [[soprano]]) and lead singer for a church in Bigaa, Bulacan. Because of Ilagan's talent, a [[parish priest]] in Bigaa, Bulacan brought Ilagan and his family to [[Manila]]. He became the singer for the [[Santa Cruz Church (Manila)|Santa Cruz Church]]. In return, Ilagan was able to study at the [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo Municipal de Manila]] (now known as Ateneo de Manila University). Although not able to finish schooling, Ilagan became a member of a [[zarzuela]] troupe (theater performers) from Spain. During the [[Spanish–American War]], the Spanish performers went back to Spain, but Ilagan maintained his liking for the zarzuela, and later pioneered productions of stage drama in the form of Philippine zarzuelas. His forty years of involvement in the field of zarzuela created the period known as the Golden Age of Philippine Theater.&lt;ref name=Panitikan /&gt; In 1902, Ilagan established the Compania Lirico-Dramatica Tagala de Gatchalian y Ilagan, also known as Compania Ilagan, the first zarzuela troupe in the Philippines. Ilagan's zarzuelas have melodramatic, comic, romantic, and political qualities.&lt;ref name=Panitikan /&gt;

==Works==
Among the zarzuelas that Ilagan wrote and produced were:&lt;ref name=Panitikan/&gt;

*''Ang Buhay nga Naman'' (That's How Life Is)
*''Ang Buwan ng Oktubre'' (The Month of October)
*''Bill de Divorcio'' (Divorce Bill)
*''Dahil kay Ina'' (Because of Mother)
*''Dalagang Bukid'' (Country Maiden)

'''Joaquim de Sousa Andrade''', better known by his pseudonym '''Sousândrade'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sousândrade|url=http://enciclopedia.itaucultural.org.br/pessoa3098/sousandrade|website=Enciclopédia Itaú Cultural de Arte e Cultura Brasileiras|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (July 9, 1833 – April 20, 1902), was a [[Brazil]]ian poet, adept of the "[[Condorism|Condorist]]" movement. His poetry, exceedingly innovative for the time it was published, is now considered an early example of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Modernist poetry|Modernism]] in Brazil.

He also designed the flag of the Brazilian State of Maranhão.

==Biography==
Sousândrade was born in the city of [[Guimarães, Maranhão|Guimarães]], in the Brazilian State of [[Maranhão]], in 1833. He published his first poetry book, ''Harpas Selvagens'' (''Wild Harps''), in 1857. He travelled to many countries, such as [[France]] (where he graduated in [[Linguistics]] and [[mining engineering]] at [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]) and the [[United States]], where he settled in 1871. It was while in the U.S.A. that he wrote ''Guesa'', an [[epic poetry|epic poem]] based on a [[Quechua people|Quechua]] legend about a teenager [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] who is going to be sacrificed to the Sun God. ''Guesa'' is characterized by the employment of [[neologism]]s and vertiginous [[metaphor]]s; thus, it is considered by some critics a precursor work of [[Modernist poetry|Modernism]], however this was only acknowledged decades after his death. From 1871 to 1879 he was secretary and collaborator for the periodical ''O Novo Mundo'', directed by [[José Carlos Rodrigues]] in [[New York City]].

Returning to Maranhão, in order to commemorate the [[First Brazilian Republic|proclamation of the republic in Brazil]], he became president of the mayor's office of [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]] in 1890. He founded many schools, realized reforms in the education and idealized the [[flag of Maranhão]]. He also planned to be a senator in 1890, but quit before the elections were held.

[[File:Bandeira do Maranhão.svg|thumb|right|The flag of Maranhão, designed by Andrade]]

Sousândrade died poor, forgotten and allegedly [[mental disorder|mentally ill]] in São Luís, in 1902. His works, forgotten for decades, were only rediscovered in the 1960s and the 1970s, thanks to the efforts of [[Augusto de Campos|Augusto]] and [[Haroldo de Campos]]. Ironically, he has said once of his poem ''Guesa'', in 1877:

{{quote|People said to me more than once that my ''Guesa Errante'' will be read only 50 years later [after its publication]. I got sad — a deception of who wrote it 50 years before.}}

'''Johannes Anyuru'''  (born 23 March 1979) is a Swedish poet and author.

==Biography==
Anyuru was born in [[Borås]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svt.se/nyheter/regionalt/smalandsnytt/vaxjo-johannes-anyuru-sommarvard-i-p1&lt;/ref&gt;  His father is from [[Uganda]] and his mother is Swedish.&lt;ref&gt;SVT 1: ''Babel'' 9 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

He debuted in 2003 with ''Det är bara gudarna som är nya'' (Only The Gods Are New), a poetry collection. In this collection of poems used [[Homer]]'s epic [[Iliad]] as a background and inspiration for the portrayal of [[immigrant]] neighborhoods. A place that is often mentioned in his poetry is the area around ''Mörners road'' in [[Växjö]], where Anyuru lived as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fanny Söderbäck |url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/gamla-gudar-och-nya-1.194714 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120731182705/http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/gamla-gudar-och-nya-1.194714 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 July 2012 |title=Gamla gudar och nya |language=sv |publisher=DN.se |date=7 July 2003 |accessdate=28 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of this book linked his style to both older contemporary Swedish poets as [[Göran Sonnevi]] or [[Tomas Tranströmer]], and hip hop band [[The Latin Kings (hip hop group)|The Latin Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tidningenkulturen.se/index.php/13-litteratur/litteratur-kritik/5079-litteratur-johannes-anyuru-staederna-inuti-hall |title= Litteratur: Johannes Anyuru, Städerna inuti Hall |last=Fries |first=Jonna |date=22 September 2009 |website=tidningenkulturen.se |language=Swedish |access-date=1 June 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyurus second poetry collection, ''Omega'', is a much more downbeat since it deals with the loss of a close friend to cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/kulturnoje/litteratur/varifran-och-varthan_31361.svd |title=Recension: Anyuru, Johannes - Omega (Övrigt) &amp;#124; Litteratur &amp;#124; SvD |language=sv |publisher=Svd.se |date= |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyurus third collection, ''Städerna inuti Hall'' (The Cities Inside Hall)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Johannes Anyuru  |url=http://www.dn.se/dnbok/utdrag-ur-staderna-inuti-hall-s-27-30/ |title=Utdrag ur "Städerna inuti Hall" s. 27-30 |language=sv |publisher=DN.se |date=16 January 2010 |accessdate=28 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2009 and describes sad socio-political landscape.

His fourth book ''Skulle jag dö under andra himlar'' (If I Were to Die Under Other Skies)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bokus.com/bok/9789113022086/skulle-jag-do-under-andra-himlar/ |title=Skulle jag dö under andra himlar - Johannes Anyuru - Bokus bokhandel |publisher=Bokus.com |date=12 August 2010 |accessdate=28 August 2010|language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not a poetry book, but [[prose]].

He has also worked with [[spoken word]] as part of the group ''Broken Word'' and a touring performance with [[Riksteatern|National Theatre Company]] called Abstrakt rap.

Dallas, Texas: SIL International&lt;/ref&gt; is an endangered [[Munda language]] of India and Bangladesh. There were 1,300 speakers in [[Rajshahi Division]], Bangladesh in 2005, but many said that [[Bengali language|Bengali]] was their best language. Koda is closely related to the [[Kol language (Bangladesh)|Kol language]].

Kim (2010)&lt;ref&gt;http://www-01.sil.org/SILESR/2010/silesr2010-006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; considers Koda and Kol to be Mundari cluster languages. Koda-speaking villages include Kundang and Krishnupur in [[Rajshahi Division]], Bangladesh, while [[Kol language (Bangladesh)|Kol]] villages include Babudaing village.

Most Kodas are adherents of the Sonaton religion or are mainstream [[Hindu]]s.

[[File:Popov A. Ktatkoj permskoj slovar 1785.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The first Permian Dictionary (1785)]]

'''Komi-Permyak language''' (перем коми кыв {{ipa|/ˈperem ˈkomi kɨv/}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://fulib.ru/books.php?action=viewKomiPermyakKiv Финно-угорская электронная библиотека] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or коми-пермяцкӧй кыв {{ipa|/ˈkomi perˈmʲatskəj kɨv/}}) is one of two regional varieties of the pluricentrical [[Komi language]], the other variety being [[Komi-Zyrian language|Komi-Zyrian]].

Komi is a [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language closely related to [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]].

The Komi-Permyak language, spoken in [[Perm Krai]] of [[Russia]] and written using the Komi [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic alphabet]], was co-official with [[Russian language|Russian]] in the [[Komi-Permyak Okrug|Komi Okrug]] of the Perm Krai.

==Glottonym==

The original name of the Komi-Permyak language is ''коми кыв'' "Komi language", identical with the native name of the Komi-Zyrian language.

In the 1920s, the soviet authorities introduced the new name for the Komi language in Perm Region as ''коми-пермяцкий язык'', combining the native name of the language with the Russian one. The new name was transliterated in Komi as ''коми-пермяцкöй кыв'' 'Komi-Permyak language'. In this way the local language was nominally separated from the Komi-Zyrian language, that officially received the original name ''коми кыв''. The Komis of Region Perm had to officially use the new name, even though it has negative connotations for the speakers, continuing in their colloquial speech to use exclusively the original name of their language as ''коми кыв''.

Only in the early 2000s (decade) has started a controversial process of replacing the offensive official name by a more correct one. The term ''перем коми кыв'' 'Permian Komi language' was proposed and it is used nowadays (alongside the old term) in local mass-media, in scientific papers and in the Komi-Permyak Wikipedia.

==Dialects==

All of the Komi-Permyak dialects are easily intelligible with one another and to some extent with the Komi-Zyrian dialects.

The Komi-Permyak dialects might be divided geographically into Northern and Southern groups, and phonemically into /l/ and /v/ groups:&lt;ref&gt;Коми-пермяцкий язык / Под ред. проф. В. И. Лыткина. — Кудымкар: Коми-пермяцкое книжное издательство, 1962. — С. 27—34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier there was a southern group too, in the [[Obva]] river basin, but now it is nearly extinct. Its only remaining member, the Nerdva dialect, is usually considered together with the central group, which in this way became "southern".

The central (new southern) and northern groups of Komi-Permyak are spoken in [[Komi-Permyak Okrug|Komi Okrug]] of [[Perm Krai]], where the language was standardized in the 1920s. The modern standard is based on Kudymkar dialect of the central group, but many elements of northern dialects were included as well, so that the "literary language" has significant differences in its morphological system from the "main" dialect.

The central dialects, spoken in the [[Inva River|Ińva]] river basin, differ considerably from the other Komi-Permyak dialects due to the general shift of etymological /'''l'''/ to /'''v'''/, then to /'''w'''/, and finally to the disappearance of the  consonant, which has triggered significant changes in morphology.

The differences between the Kudymkar and Uliś Ińva dialects are mainly in accentuation: the Uliś Ińva has a phonological stress (the Öń too), whereas the Kudymkar dialect (like as Ńerdva) has a morphological one. The Ńerdva dialect retains the etymological /'''l'''/. The same can be said about the Öń dialect (recently extinct), that had connections with the eastern Permian.&lt;ref&gt;Raisa M. Batalova (1990). Унифицированное описание диалектов уральских языков. Оньковский диалект коми-пермяцкого языка. Hamburg.&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern group of the Permian dialects (upon [[Kosa River|Kösva]], [[Kama River|Kama]] and [[Lup River|Lup]] rivers) was under a strong Zyrian influence on all the levels. The Köć and Kös dialects are closely related with some Syktyv dialects of Zyrian, whereas the Lup dialect for a long time was in tenuous connections with the [[Upper Ezhva dialect]].

The Komi-Permyak standard language refers only to the central and northern groups of the Komi-Permyak dialects. They can be called as '''proper Permian dialects'''. The other two groups are marginal.

An only relic of the eastern Permian is the '''[[Komi-Yodzyak language|Yaźva dialect]]''', ca. 200 speakers of the ca. 900 ethnical Komis in [[Krasnovishersky District]] of Perm Krai. In the early 2000s (decade) it was standardized by authority of the krai. The dialect has archaic system of [[vowel]]s (including /'''ö'''/, /'''ü'''/ and /'''ʌ'''/), while its accentuation is similar to Uliś Ińva's and its lexical system likes the Northern Permian one.

The Western Permian group is presented by another marginal dialect, Źuźdin (ca. 1000 person living in [[Kirov Oblast]] near the border of Komi Okrug).

==Phonology==
In the Komi-Permyak standard language there are the same 26 main consonants and 7 vowels as in Komi-Zyrian.

===Consonants===
Komi-Permyak's modern consonant system includes 26 native ones, and the additional consonants /'''ts'''/, /'''f'''/, /'''x'''/ in Russian loanwords. In traditional speech the "foreign sounds" were replaced with respectively /t͡ɕ/, /p/, and /k/, respectively.

===Vowels===

The Komi-Permyak vowel system can be considered as being three-dimensional, where vowels are characterised by three features: front and back, rounded and unrounded and vowel height.

Komi-Permyak does not distinguish between long and short vowels and does not have vowel harmony. There are no diphthongs; when two vowels come together, which occurs at some morpheme boundaries, each vowel retains its individual sound.

==Writing system==
The both regional standards of the Komi language have an identical alphabet, introduced in 1938. The alphabet (анбур) includes all the Russian letters plus two additional graphemes: '''і''' and '''ӧ'''.

==Grammar==
Komi is an agglutinating language. It uses affixes to express possession, to specify mode, time, and so on.

===Nouns===
All Permian Komi nouns are declined for number, case and possession, adding special suffixes to word stem.

====Number====

In Permian Komi there are two [[grammatical number]]s: singular and [[plural]]. The singular is the unmarked form of a word, and the plural is obtained by inflecting the singular.

The plural marker of nouns is /'''ez'''/ (orthographically '''''эз''''' or '''''ез''''') immediately following a word stem before any case or other affixes. The last consonant of the stem before the plural suffix has to be duplicated.

| '''керку&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;эз&lt;/span&gt;''' /kerkuez/

|-
| '''морт'''
| '''мортт&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;эз&lt;/span&gt;''' /morttez/
| human&amp;nbsp;– humans
|-
| '''нянь'''
| '''нянн&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;ез&lt;/span&gt;''' /ɲaɲɲez/

|-
| '''джыдж'''
| '''джыджж&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;ез&lt;/span&gt;''' /d͡ʒɨd͡ʒd͡ʒez/
| martlet&amp;nbsp;– martlets
|-
| '''кай'''
| '''кай&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;ез&lt;/span&gt;''' /kajjez/
|bird&amp;nbsp;– birds
|}

The plural suffix has also a reduced variant (a "weak form") /'''е'''/ (orth. '''''э''''' or '''''е'''''), that is used combining with some weak forms of possessive suffixes, e.g. '''ки&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;э&lt;/span&gt;т''' 'your (Sg.) hands ' versa  '''ки&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;эз&lt;/span&gt;''' 'hands'.

====Possession====

The Permian Komi possessive suffixes are added to the end of nouns either before or after a case suffix depending of case. The three suffixes of singular possession have in addition to their main forms  the weak variants used combining with a weak form of plural suffix,  weak forms of some cases or forming the suffixes of plural possession.

# &lt;small&gt;The element '''ны''' is a marker of plural possession&lt;/small&gt;

The possessive suffix of 3Sg is widely used also as a definite article. In colloquial speech it is the main meaning of this suffix.

It is assumed, that the Permian Komi standard language has eighteen noun [[Declension|cases]]: ten grammatical cases and eight locative cases. The disputes continue about the status of some monosyllabic postpositions and a set of dialectal reduced forms of postpositions that can be treated as case suffixes too. The maximal amount of all possible cases reaches 30.

The case suffixes are added to the end of nouns either before or after a possessive suffix depending of case. Some cases have weak variants of their suffixes combining with the weak variants of possessive suffixes.

===Adjectives===
Used attributively, Permian Komi adjectives precede the nouns they modify, and are not declined: '''басöк нывка''' 'beautiful girl' → '''басöк нывкаэслö''' 'to the beautiful girls'.

However most adjectives can also be used as nouns and sometimes as appositions, in which case they are declined: e.g. '''ыджыт''' ("big") → '''ыджыттэзісь''' ("out of the bigs"). The declensional paradigma is the same as by nouns, except the main accusative form, that became by adjectives suffix '''ö''' instead of '''öс''' or a null morpheme by nouns: '''адззи басöк нывкаöс''' 'I have found a beautiful girl' → '''адззи басöкö''' 'I have found a beautiful [girl]'.

Being predicative an adjective agrees with the subject for number. The plural marker of the predicative is '''öсь''': '''керкуыс ыджыт''' 'the house is big ' → '''керкуэc ыджытöсь''' 'the houses are big'.

The adjective in Permian Komi have five degrees of comparison

| -'''ыник''' / '''-ик'''
| '''том&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;ыник&lt;/span&gt; '''

|}

The comparative and the superlative compare the intensity of an object's quality with the other object's one. The sative, excessive and diminutive compare the intensity of the quality with its basic degree.

===Personal pronouns===
Komi personal pronouns inflect in all the cases. The language makes no distinction between ''he'','' she'' and ''it''. The nominative case of personal pronouns are listed in the following table:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="2" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Personal pronouns
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! P. Komi !! English
|-

|-
|'''мe''' || I
|-
|'''тэ''' || you
|-
|'''ciя''' || he/she/it
|-
! colspan="2" style="background:#efefef;" | Plural
|-
|'''мийö''' || we
|-
|'''тiйö''' || you
|-
|'''нія''' || they
|}

===Verb===

Permian Komi verbs show tense ([[present]], [[future]], [[past]]), mood ([[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]], [[evidential]], [[optative]], [[Conditional mood|conditional]] and [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunctive]]), [[voice]] and [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]].

The verbal stem is a 2ed person singular of imperative mode: '''мун''' 'go', '''кер''' 'make'. All the other forms are formed by adding suffixes to the stem.

Some verbal stems having a consonant cluster at the end become expanded with a so-called "voyelle de soutien" '''ы''' which is dropped before the suffixes beginning with a vowel: '''кывзы''' = '''кывз+ы''' 'hear', '''видчы''' 'swear' = '''видч+ы''', e. g. '''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;кывзы&lt;/span&gt;ны''' 'to hear', '''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;кывзы&lt;/span&gt;тöн''' 'by hearing' but '''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;кывз&lt;/span&gt;і''' 'I heard', '''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;кывз&lt;/span&gt;ö''' 'he hears', '''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;кывз&lt;/span&gt;ан''' 'you hear'. Thus, these stems with a consonant cluster have their full und reduced variants.

Permian [[infinitive]]s are marked with '''-ны''' added to a stem as in '''мyн&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;ны&lt;/span&gt;''' 'to go',  '''кывзы&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;ны&lt;/span&gt;''' 'hear'

All Permian Komi verbs are conjugated in the same way, except for the defective verb '''вöвны''' 'to be'.

Negation is mostly expressed by a conjugated negator preceding the stem, e. g. '''&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;эг&lt;/span&gt; мун''' 'I didn't go'.

The indicative mood has three tenses: present, future and past. The main marker of the present and future tense is '''а''' (negat. '''о'''), the marker of the past tense is''' и''' (negat. '''э''').

Here is conjugation of verb '''керны''' 'make, do':

'''Likbez''' ({{lang-ru|ликбе́з}}, {{IPA-ru|lʲɪɡˈbʲɛs}}; from a Russian abbreviation for "'''lik'''vidatsiya '''bez'''gramotnosti", ликвида́ция безгра́мотности, {{IPA|[lʲɪkvʲɪˈdatsɨjə bʲɪzˈɡramətnəsʲtʲɪ]}}, meaning "elimination of illiteracy") was a campaign of eradication of illiteracy in [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] and [[Soviet Union]] in the 1920s and 1930s. The term was also used for various schools and courses established during the campaign. Nowadays this term is sometimes used in Russian as a slang for answers on common questions.

== Background ==
In 1897, the overall [[literacy rate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] was an estimated 24%, with the rural literacy rate at 19.7%.{{sfn|Grenoble|p=46}} There were few schools available to the population, particularly in rural areas. Until the early 20th century, there were still no specific curricular plans or guidelines in the [[zemstvo]] schools.{{sfn|Brooks|pp=48–49}} In 1891, the literacy schools came under church administration, and maintained a largely religious curriculum, which emphasized the teaching of old [[Church Slavonic]].{{sfn|Brooks|p=47}} The peasantry was largely self-educated, and often relied on schools run by political dissidents for the latter period of tsarist rule. Facing a growing opposition from the general populace, [[Tsar Alexander II]] announced a decree that would raise the tuition fee for schools, thus preventing further social mobility for [[serfs]] who were allowed free mobility.{{sfn|Trotsky|p=33}} During the reign of [[Tsar Nicholas II]] (1894–1917) liberals pushed for a universal education system, which scholars predict may have expanded if it were not for [[World War I]].{{sfn|Clark|p=16}}

== The Bolshevik literacy campaign ==
[[File:LikbezCheboksary.jpg|thumb|Learning to reading and writing of the population. [[Cheboksary]], 1930s.]]
[[File:LikbezShorkasy.jpg|thumb|Learning to reading and writing of the population. Shorkasy ([[Chuvash Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|CASSR]]), 1930s.]]
When the [[Bolshevik Party]] came to power in 1917, they faced a crumbling empire infamous for its perceived backwardness and poor education system. In 1917, within the remaining Tsarist territories, an estimated 37.9% of the male population above seven years old was literate and only 12.5% of the female population was literate.{{sfn|Foley}}
Lenin's views on literacy were rooted in its economic and political benefits. "Without literacy," he declared, "There can be no politics, there can only be rumors, gossip and prejudice."{{sfn|Roucek|p=481}} The Likbez campaign was started on December 26, 1919, when [[Vladimir Lenin]] signed the [[Soviet Decrees|Decree]] of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] "On eradication of illiteracy among the population of RSFSR" ("О ликвидации безграмотности среди населения РСФСР"). According to this decree, all people from 8 to 50 years old were required to become literate in their native language. 40,000 liquidation points (ликпункты) were arranged to serve as centers for education, and achieving literacy.{{sfn|Nar|p=140}}

Fighting for time and funding during the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]] of 1917–23, [[Narkompros]], the Soviet Ministry of Education, quickly assembled the Cheka Likbez (an acronym for the "Extraordinary Commission for the Liquidation of Illiteracy") which was to be responsible for the training of literacy teachers as well as organizing and propagating the literacy campaign.{{sfn|Clark|page=23}} From the peasantry to trade unions, specific literacy percentage quotas were made for different sectors of Soviet society. For example, the [[Trade unions in the Soviet Union|trade union]] campaign aimed for 100% literacy for its workers by 1923.{{sfn|Clark|pages=72–73}} The Bolsheviks also believed that through literary campaigns they could easily promote Party ideology and shape the population's outlook. Women, given their low literacy rate, were regarded as having the highest potential for becoming the "modernizers" of Soviet society. Through the education of peasant women, the [[Bolsheviks]] hoped to break down the patriarchal domination of rural society. Lenin had written in [[Russian Revolution and the Emancipation of Women|The Emancipation of Women]] that a woman's illiteracy would impair the "fighting spirit" of male party members and prevent wives from grasping their husbands' ideals.{{sfn|Clark|page=115}} In the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]], the women's literacy campaign was largely carried out by members of the [[Ali Bayramov Club]], a women's organization founded by Azeri Bolshevik women in Baku in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Heyat, F. 2002. Azeri women in transition. London: Routledge. 89-94.&lt;/ref&gt;

To further extend their reach to the peasant community, the Bolsheviks built reading rooms in villages across the country. Serving as a [[Soviet propaganda|propaganda]] center rather than library, a literate peasant would act as the room's "Red Reader" and lead discussions on texts sent by the Party directive with members of the local community. Attendance was most often mandatory, as the reading rooms proved to be one of the Party's most successful propaganda tools, where campaigns would take shape and the locals would hear about happenings in the outside world.{{sfn|Kenez|pp=137–138}}

By 1923, however, it was clear that the campaign had its shortcomings. For one thing, Narkompros was having difficulty competing for funding from the [[Politburo]].{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|p=248}} The Narkompros budget for literacy education dropped from 2.8% in 1924-5 to 1.6% in 1927–8.{{sfn|Kenez|p=160}} Likbez literary schools were not established locally by order of [[Nomenklatura|Party elites]]—instead, they relied heavily on grassroots demand.{{sfn|Clark|pages=98–99}} Narkompros also found it hard to find educated teachers actually willing to live in the isolated conditions of the countryside.

In many cases, peasant and proletariat students met their educators and literacy teachers with hostility due to their "petty bourgeois" backgrounds.{{sfn|Fitzpatrick|pp=248–249}} To solve this problem, local governments established a system of rewards for workers who attended class, granting special privileges to those who did.{{sfn|Clark|page=19}} In some extreme cases, during the [[1921–1922 famine in Tatarstan|1922 famine]], many districts required their illiterate male and female populations to attend literacy school in order to earn their food points.{{sfn|Clark|p=172}} Fearing they were not reaching out to the population and making the popular reading frenzy that they had hoped, the Politburo decided to heavily fund and promote clubs and societies such as the "Down with Illiteracy" society.{{sfn|Clark|p=172}}

==History   ==
=== Early spread ===
[[File:‘Ploughman works. Teacher works. Children work. – Labour is a good cause’.jpg|thumb|Early Likbez-era schoolhouse scene invoking the help of God.]]
Pro-literacy propaganda came into popular Soviet culture with the government's policy of ''likbez'' rooted in the Bolshevik push for mass literacy directly following the Bolshevik rise to power. After the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the Soviet [[People's Commissariat for Education]] made a conscious effort to introduce political propaganda into Soviet schools, particularly the labour schools that had been established in 1918 with the ''Statutniihge of the Uniform Labour School'' decree.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.socionauki.ru/journal/articles/137487/|title=All-Russian Primary Education (1894–1917):  Developmental Milestones|website=www.socionauki.ru|language=ru|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These propaganda pamphlets, required texts, and posters artistically embodied the core values&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isreview.org/issue/82/education-literacy-and-russian-revolution|title=Education, literacy, and the Russian Revolution {{!}} International Socialist Review|website=isreview.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Soviet push for literacy in both rural and urban settings, namely the concept espoused by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] that "Without literacy, there can be no politics, there can only be rumors, gossip and prejudice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/910370690|title=The challenge of science education,|last=1902-|first=Roucek, Joseph Slabey,|publisher=Books for Libraries Press|isbn=9780836920703|oclc=910370690}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept, the Soviet valuing of literacy, was later echoed in works like [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky's]] 1924 [[Literature and Revolution]], in which Trotsky describes literature and reading as driving forces in the forging of a [[NEPman|new Communist man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1924/lit_revo/ch08.htm|title=Leon Trotsky: Literature and Revolution (8. Revolutionary and Socialist Art)|last=Trotsky|first=Leon|website=www.marxists.org|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the Likbez campaign, the State compulsarily enrolled millions of illiterate Soviets from both town and country in [[literacy school]]s, requiring these citizens to engage with the Leninist ideology of pro-literacy. In this period, [[Komsomol]] members and [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneer]] detachments were also commissioned to spread pro-literacy propaganda in the form of pamphlets and word of mouth to [[Types of inhabited localities in Russia|village]] illiterates.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Initial pro-literacy propaganda efforts included instituting spaces in villages, particularly, that would facilitate the spread of literacy through the countryside. For example, in the early 1920s, Bolsheviks built "Red Rooms," reading rooms in villages across Russia, to serve as [[Soviet propaganda|propaganda]] centers by which texts sent by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Party]] were disseminated to local communities.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/967414861|title=The birth of the propaganda state : Soviet methods of mass mobilization, 1917-1929|last=Peter|first=Kenez,|isbn=9780521306362|oclc=967414861}}&lt;/ref&gt; In children's education, particularly, inoculation of illiteracy was presented by the State as a means by which children could most fully develop desirable qualities such as curiosity and patience.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For children, the most widely used books in the early Likbez campaign to promote literacy were the [[Bible]], ''Kniga Svyashchennogo Chtenia'' (Book of Holy Reading), ''Detsky Mir'' (Children's World) and ''Rodnoe Slovo'' (Native Word) by Konstantin D. Ushinsky.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; God and divine will were a common pro-literacy motif in propaganda throughout the Likbez campaign, but were especially present in its pre-1920 phase.

===  1920-1930 ===
[[File:"Night of the Books".jpg|thumb|1924 advertisement by Varvara Stepanova for "Night of the Books"]]
In the early 1920s, the Bolshevik government emphasized local initiatives and de-emphasized centralized State control to parallel [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] [[New Economic Policy]] that had been instituted in 1921. It was in this atmosphere that the Soviet government's Commissariat of Enlightenment most heavily launched its methodical literacy campaign by the Spring of 1923.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uprooting Otherness|last=Clark|first=Charles|publisher=Princeton University|year=2000|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The height of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic's (RSFR) People's Commissariat of Enlightenment (''Narkompros'') literacy campaign lasted until the tenth anniversary of the October Revolution, 7 November 1927.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

From 1923-1927, Soviet pro-literacy propaganda became especially pushed by the [[Cheka|Cheka's]] ''likbez'' agencies among [[Trade unions in the Soviet Union|Russian Trade Unions]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the pro-literacy propaganda campaigns within trade Unions, the Party-line contained in pamphlets and other pieces of propaganda focused on "true literacy" as the ideal literacy level for workers, a commitment that would require 6–8 months of additional enrollment in Union-sponsored literacy schools after a worker had initially achieved "semi literacy."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In the mid-1920s, [[Cheka]] likbez commissions would routinely seek and publish reports of literacy rates from Unions as a means of spreading a competitive desire for literacy between towns and factories.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In these reports, illiteracy was painted as a "weak opponent" to be overcome in a short period of time by reading State literature in libraries and "Red Rooms" or red corners.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Charles E.|date=1995|title=Literacy and Labour: The Russian Literacy Campaign within the Trade Unions, 1923-27|jstor=153300|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1327–1341}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Transport Union, with its educational administration's 40-50 million ruble annual spending capacity, was largely in charge of seeing to the promulgation of literacy initiatives, transmission of pro-literacy pamphlets, and dissemination of books and reading materials to Union-sponsored schools.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Throughout the 1920s, spreading literacy in the Soviet transportation sector through the building of Union schools held symbolic importance for the State as a means of propaganda in and of itself. By promoting literacy in transport workers, specifically, the [[Komsomol]] and Cheka likbez units hoped to achieve symbolic victories in signaling the Likbez campaign's overall success.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Even in the early Likbez campaign, the transportation sector already experienced relatively low illiteracy rates in workers due to the reading necessary to operate modes of transportation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As such, achieving high literacy in this population was a relatively easy goal and would show the Likbez campaign's success in a widespread and visible industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clark|first=Charles E.|date=1995|title=Literacy and Labour: The Russian Literacy Campaign within the Trade Unions, 1923-27|jstor=153300|journal=Europe-Asia Studies|volume=47|issue=8|pages=1327–1341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State-sponsored prescriptive materials in the 1920s concerning the plight of the domestic worker had a specific focus on literacy stemming from Union membership. These short stories, [[Chastushka|chastushki]], poems, cartoons, and plays were spread through pamphlets, journals, and [[wall newspaper]]s and were usually tales about young, single, illiterate women from the countryside.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pulsearch.princeton.edu/catalog/7112241|title=Everyday life in early Soviet Russia [electronic resource] : taking the Revolution inside / edited by Christina Kiaer and Eric Naiman. - Princeton University Library Catalog|website=pulsearch.princeton.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these pieces of propaganda, it was when the downtrodden women became acquainted with local Soviet officials that the women's luck began to change. In the plot lines of most of these works, the main characters, who had usually fled their countryside homes after being taken advantage of sexually, experienced reversals of fortunes after meeting Soviet officials in their new, urban homes.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; These officials would rescue the women from the abuses they were suffering as ill-paid and ill-respected domestic servants by encouraging the women to join a Union. At this point in the story, the women would receive not only Union protection but also an education as a result of Union membership and access to Union schools and reading materials.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Ultimately, the story's heroine, the domestic worker, would become fully literate as well as active in her local worker's committee (''mestkom'').&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Often, the women in these works of pro-literacy propaganda were portrayed as using their new literacy and subsequent heightened foothold in Union society to become Soviet delegates themselves and help second generations of downtrodden women by teaching them to read and write.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=acls;cc=acls;idno=heb08933.0001.001;node=heb08933.0001.001:16;view=image;seq=247;size=100;page=root|title=ACLS Humanities E-Book - Accessoptions|website=quod.lib.umich.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these rags to riches propaganda tales, literacy was the vehicle by which women were able to lift up their status as workers within Unions and Soviet society.     [[File:"If you will not read books, you will forget the grammar.".jpg|thumb|1925 propaganda poster: "If you will not read books, you will forget the grammar."]]In 1924, 90% of domestic workers coming from villages were illiterate and were referred to in Soviet literature and propaganda as the "third front," a subset of the population which needed to be raised up through literacy.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The focus on spreading the desire for literacy among trade unions through pamphlets, building of schools, and the dissemination of state-approved literature largely petered out by 1925 when Cheka likbez realized it could not achieve its high literary goals by 1933, the date of the Narkompros deadline for compulsory secondary education throughout the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After 1925, greater flexibility in literacy class structures and attendance within Soviet trade unions was gradually introduced.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In the mid-1920s, posters had become a "quintessential form of propaganda" in Likbez. Throughout the 1920s, though pro-literacy propaganda was still taking on its earlier forms, it was increasingly contained in propaganda posters.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== 1930-1936 ===
As [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|consolidated his power]] through the late 1920s, Soviet propaganda largely shifted its focus to center on rapid industrialization and centralized, State control of the economy.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; By the 1930s, the dissemination of pro-literacy propaganda had slowed throughout the Soviet Union. The bodies for promoting literacy whose establishment Likbez had catalyzed throughout the Soviet Union remained in place, but the push for pro-literacy propaganda was not occurring with the same fervor as it had in the previous decade. Indeed, throughout the 1930s, [[Propaganda in the Soviet Union|propaganda]] became increasingly focused on glorifying the Soviet State, particularly its leader [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reeec.illinois.edu/teachers/lesson/documents/soviet_posters.pdf|title=Soviet Posters|last=Bryan|first=Anna|date=|website=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820192724/http://www.reeec.illinois.edu/teachers/lesson/documents/soviet_posters.pdf|archive-date=2014-08-20|dead-url=yes|access-date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pro-literacy posters  ==
[[File:"Peasant woman, consolidate the unity of workers and peasants.".jpg|thumb|1925 propaganda poster: "Peasant woman, consolidate the unity of workers and peasants."]]Pro-literacy propaganda posters were a cheap way for the State Publishing House in [[Leningrad]] and other Soviet State bodies to reach a wide audience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Moreover, [[Propaganda|posters]] could be understood even by illiterate citizens.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth of the Propaganda State: Soviet Methods of Mass Mobilization 1917-1929|last=Kenez|first=Peter|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda posters had been an important weapon for the [[Bolsheviks]] during the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] 1918-1921, but they remained in use even after the war's conclusion. After the Civil War and Lenin's institution of the [[New Economic Policy|NEP]] Policy, propaganda posters began increasingly depicting the reforging of Soviet everyday life or ''[[wiktionary:быть|byt]]''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;''.''

Propaganda posters of the 1920s focused on the need to build a new world and way of life after the destruction of the Civil War. While the Bolsheviks were experienced in the use of print media to spread ideas, they recognized that print media could not work to imprint Soviet [[ideology]] on the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] as a whole, since most Soviets were illiterate and could not even understand Soviet staple texts such as those of [[Karl Marx|Marx]] or [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reeec.illinois.edu/teachers/lesson/documents/soviet_posters.pdf|title=Soviet Posters|last=Bryan|first=Anna|date=|website=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820192724/http://www.reeec.illinois.edu/teachers/lesson/documents/soviet_posters.pdf|archive-date=2014-08-20|dead-url=yes|access-date=May 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the prevalence of religion in mass Russian pre-revolutionary culture, Soviet citizens were used to looking at religious icons and learning from the images and symbolism that they saw.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Much like the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] had done with icons, the Soviet State used propaganda posters to "present symbols in a simple and easily identifiable way, even to barely literate peasants".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Munitions of the Mind: A history of propaganda from the ancient world to the present day.|last=Taylor|first=Phillip|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=119–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-literacy propaganda posters sold Communist ideology to the population by portraying the benefits of literacy to individuals, specifically.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the early years of the Soviet Union, particularly in the early-mid 1920s, propaganda posters were used to spread literacy while at the same time indoctrinating the masses in Marxist–Leninist thought.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Women and pro-literacy propaganda ==
Women, particularly, became motifs in Soviet pro-literacy propaganda.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In pro-literacy propaganda, the Bolshevik commitment to female literacy was used to underscore the party's commitment to improving women's station in Soviet society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uprooting Otherness|last=Clark|first=Charles|publisher=Princeton University|year=2000|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Zhenotdel]]'', the Russian Soviet Party's women's section, was a particular force in disseminating pro-literacy pamphlets and posters during the height of the Likbez campaign.

The use of women as main characters was a key element of Likbez-era propaganda literature. The plot line of women improving their stations in Soviet society through literacy was first introduced in the widely disseminated rags-to-riches tales of domestic workers in the early 1920s. For example, on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the Russian decree on literacy (December 1924), the State commissioning body of [[Ivanovo-Voznesensk]] (the ''guberniia'') published a pamphlet which linked women's lag in reaching full equality to their husbands with women's ignorance and illiteracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uprooting Otherness|last=Clark|first=Charles|publisher=Princeton University|year=2000|isbn=|location=Princeton, NJ|pages=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; By achieving literacy, the pamphlet's main character Riabnkova is able to gain autonomy and escape the clutches of her overbearing husband to become a contributing member of Soviet society.

Moreover, images of women became central to Soviet pro-literacy propaganda posters during the Likbez campaign.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In these posters, women were shown distributing books, teaching children how to read, and generally engaging with the Soviet ideals of education and literacy. Prior to 1920, women's representation in political posters was mostly allegorical.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonnell|first=Victoria E.|date=1991|title=The Representation of Women in Early Soviet Political Art|jstor=131074|journal=The Russian Review|volume=50|issue=3|pages=267–288|doi=10.2307/131074}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1920 that Soviet artists generated a female counterpart for the commonly-used imagery of the male worker or blacksmith that had come into widespread use in post-Civil War propaganda.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After 1920, the imagery of women in propaganda posters began to shift to that of the woman worker, a new Soviet woman. Though some allegorical representations of women subsisted in propaganda posters and art through the early 1920s, the new depictions of women found in Likbez-era posters were of women in plain dress, "industrious women workers and peasant women, building socialism alongside their male counterparts."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Throughout the Likbez campaign, the building of socialism in which women were depicted as taking part was the spread of literacy. Though representation of the woman worker waned in its prevalence in political propaganda during the [[New Economic Policy|NEP]]-era, the representation of women and books remained a mainstay in pro-literacy Likbez-era propaganda through the 1920s and into the 1930s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Women, given their low literacy rate, were regarded by the State as having the highest potential for becoming the "modernizers" of Soviet society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Reports of success in the education and literacy of women, the largest demographic group in the illiterate segment of Soviet society, were used as propaganda in reports by the Soviet State as symbols of the State's power to improve the lot of even the most vulnerable and needy of its society.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Results ==
With the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Revolution]], governmental standards regarding what was considered "literate" also changed. Although all army personnel in the [[tsarist period]] eligible for conscription were required to be functionally literate, most men who could simply read the alphabet and their own name were deemed as fully literate. Although census takers were given rather strict orders on what was deemed fully literate and even semi-literate, in remote provinces and parts of [[Central Asia]] standards were somewhat laxer than in locations with a closer proximity to [[Moscow]].{{sfn|Grenoble|p=142}} The campaign was not the success the Bolsheviks had originally envisioned mainly because it lacked teacher volunteers, funding, and organization.
The likbez campaign was most effective for people between the ages of 9 and 35. For anyone over 35, the Bolsheviks believed they were utterly unreachable.

In 1926, however, only 51% of the population over the age of 10 had achieved literacy. Male literacy was at 66.5 while female literacy lagged behind at 37.2. By 1939, however, male literacy was at 90.8 and female literacy had increased to 72.5%.{{sfn|Grenoble|p=56}} According to the [[Soviet Census (1939)|1939 Soviet Census]], literate people were 89.7% ([[RSFSR]], ages 9–49). During the 1950s, the [[Soviet Union]] had become a country of nearly 100% [[literacy]].

There is speculation that had the peasant tradition of self-education been able to continue, the peasantry may have reached the level of education that it did by the mid-1930s, independent of government efforts.{{sfn|Clark|page=109}} By the 1950s, with a stable education system and an entire generation that had at least completed some form of lower level education, the Soviet Union had reached a literacy rate of 100%.

== Campaign for non-Russian speakers ==
In non-Russian speaking areas of the Soviet population, Narkompros promoted the policy of [[Korenizatsiya]] (literally "putting down the roots") within the separate autonomous regions and republics to the extent that teaching [[Russian language|Russian]] was considered a [[counter-revolutionary]] crime.{{sfn|Grenoble|p=46}} For the separate nationalities, the ABCD Hierarchy, a system which ranked the 120 languages of the Soviet Union according their communicable significance, charted out a specific plan for each nationality's achievement of literacy. In 1924 textbooks were printed in only 25 languages of the Soviet Union. However, by 1934 they were printed in 104 languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10613">The Syriac version of the New Testament is one of the earliest and most important versions. Over 350 Syriac manuscripts of the New Testament have survived into the present. The majority of them represent the [[Peshitta]] version. Only a very few manuscripts represent Old Syriac versions. Some manuscripts represent a mixed or eclectic text.

'''Mirza Fatali Akhundzade''' ({{lang-az|Mirzə Fətəli Axundov}} میرزا فتحعلی آخوندزاده) or '''Mirza Fath-Ali Akhundzade''', also known as '''Akhundov''' (12 July 1812 – 9 March 1878), was a celebrated [[Iran]]ian ethnic [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]]&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Azerbaijan (1905-1920): the shaping of a national identity in a Muslim community''. Cambridge University Press, Boston, 1985.

For example, Mirza Fath cAli Akhundov, the Azerbaijani best known in the West, will be referred to as Akhundzada, the form of his name that has been used for a century in publications outside of Russia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/akundzada-playwright ĀḴŪNDZĀDA] ĀḴŪNDZĀDA (in Soviet usage, AKHUNDOV), MĪRZĀ FATḤ-ʿALĪ (1812-78), Azerbaijani playwright and propagator of alphabet reform; also, one of the earliest and most outspoken atheists to appear in the Islamic world. According to his own autobiographical account (first published in Kaškūl, Baku, 1887, nos. 43-45, and reprinted in M. F. Akhundov, Alefbā-ye ǰadīd va maktūbāt, ed. H. Moḥammadzāda and Ḥ. Ārāslī, Baku, 1963, pp. 349-55), Āḵūndzāda was born in 1812 (other documents give 1811 and 1814) in the town of Nūḵa, in the part of Azerbaijan that was annexed by Russia in 1828. His father, Mīrzā Moḥammad-Taqī, had been kadḵodā of Ḵāmena, a small town about fifty kilometers to the west of Tabrīz, but he later turned to trade and, crossing the Aras river, settled in Nūḵa, where in 1811 he took a second wife. One year later, she gave birth to Mīrzā Fatḥ-ʿAlī. Āḵūndzāda’s mother was descended from an African who had been in the service of Nāder Shah, and consciousness of this African element in his ancestry served to give Āḵūndzāda a feeling of affinity with his great Russian contemporary, Pushkin.&lt;/ref&gt; author, playwright, philosopher, and founder of modern literary criticism,&lt;ref&gt;Parsinejad, Iraj. A History of Literary Criticism in Iran (1866-1951). He lived in the Russian Empire. Bethesda, MD: Ibex, 2003. p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; "who acquired fame primarily as the writer of European-inspired plays in the Azeri Turkic language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Russian History |last=Millar |first=James R. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher=MacMillan Reference USA |location= |isbn=0-02-865694-6 |page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Akhundzade singlehandedly opened a new stage of development of [[Azerbaijani literature]]. He was also the founder of materialism and atheism movement in Azerbaijan&lt;ref&gt;M. Iovchuk (ed.) et el. [The Philosophical and Sociological Thought of the Peoples of the USSR in the 19th Century http://www.biografia.ru/about/filosofia46.html]. Moscow: ''Mysl'', 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; and one of forerunners of modern [[Iranian nationalism]].&lt;ref name="Tadeusz"&gt;[[Tadeusz Swietochowski]], ''Russia and Azerbaijan: A Borderland in Transition'' (New York: Columbia University Press), 1995, page 27-28:&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Akhundzade was born in 1812 in [[Shaki, Azerbaijan|Nukha]] (present-day Shaki, [[Azerbaijan (country)|Azerbaijan]]) to a wealthy land owning family from [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]. His parents, and especially his uncle Haji Alaskar, who was Fatali's first teacher, prepared young Fatali for a career in Shi'a clergy, but the young man was attracted to the literature. In 1832, while in [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], Akhundzade came into contact with the poet [[Mirza Shafi Vazeh]], who introduced him to a Western secular thought and discouraged him from pursuing a religious career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Between Two Empires: Ahmet Agaoglu and the New Turkey |last=Shissler |first=A. Holly |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=I.B. Tauris |location= |isbn=1-86064-855-X |page=104 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1834 Akhundzade moved to [[Tiflis]] (present-day [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), and spent the rest of his life working as a translator of Oriental languages in the service of the Russian Empire's Viceroyalty. Concurrently, from 1837 onwards he worked as a teacher in Tbilisi [[uezd]] [[Armenia]]n school, then in Nersisyan school{{ref|title=Из истории русско-армянских отношений, 1956, стр. 275}}. In Tiflis his acquaintance and friendship with the exiled Russian Decembrists [[Alexander Bestuzhev|Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky]], [[Vladimir Odoyevsky]], poet [[Yakov Polonsky]], Armenian writers [[Khachatur Abovian]],{{ref|title=Из истории русско-армянских отношений, 1956, стр. 275}} [[Gabriel Sundukyan]] and others played some part in formation of Akhundzade's Europeanized outlook.

[[File:Grave of Mirza Fatali Akhundov.jpg|170px|thumbnail|left|Grave monument of Akhundzade in Tbilisi]]
Akhundzade's first published work was [[Eastern poem on the death of Pushkin|''The Oriental Poem'']] (1837), written to lament the death of the great Russian poet [[Alexander Pushkin]]. But the rise of Akhundzade's literary activity comes in the 1850s. In the first half of the 1850s, Akhundzade wrote six comedies – the first comedies in Azerbaijani literature as well as the first samples of the national dramaturgy. The comedies by Akhundzade are unique in their critical pathos, analysis of the  realities in Azerbaijan of the first half of the 19th century. These comedies found numerous responses in the Russian other foreign periodical press. The German ''Magazine of Foreign Literature'' called Akhundzade "dramatic genius", "the Azerbaijani Molière" [http://literature.aznet.org/literature/makhundov/makhundov_en.htm 1]. Akhundzade's sharp pen was directed against everything that he believed hindered the advance of the Russian Empire, which for Akhundzadeh was a force for modernisation, in spite of the atrocities it committed in its southern advance against Akhundzadeh's own kin.&lt;ref name="Zia-Ebrahimi Emergence of Iranian nationalism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zia-Ebrahimi|first1=Reza|title=The emergence of Iranian nationalism: Race and the politics of dislocation|date=2016|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780231541114|pages=141–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Walter Kolarz:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The greatest Azerbaidzhani poet of the nineteenth century, Mirza Fathali Akhundov (1812-78), who is called the "Molière of the Orient", was so completely devoted to the Russian cause that he urged his compatriots to fight Turkey during the [[Crimean War]].&lt;ref&gt;Kolarz W. Russian and Her Colonies. London. 1953.  pp 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1859 Akhundzade published his short but famous novel ''The Deceived Stars''. In this novel he laid the foundation of Azerbaijani realistic historical prose, giving the models of a new genre in Azerbaijani literature. By his comedies and dramas Akhundzade established realism as the leading trend in Azerbaijani literature.

According to [[Ronald Grigor Suny]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Turkish nationalism, which developed in part as a reaction to the nationalism of the Christian minorities [of the Ottoman Empire], was, like Armenian nationalism, heavily influenced by thinkers who lived and were educated in the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] [[Ismail Gasprinski|Ismail Bey Gasprinski]] and the Azerbaijani writer Mirza Fath Ali Akhundzade inspired Turkish intellectuals in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Grigor Suny Looking Toward Ararat: Armenia in Modern History. Bloomington and Indianapolis: Indiana State University, 1993. page 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Tadeusz Swietochowski]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In his glorification of the pre-Islamic greatness of Iran, before it was destroyed at the hands of the "hungry, naked and savage Arabs, "Akhundzada was one of the forerunners of modern Iranian nationalism, and of its militant manifestations at that. Nor was he devoid of anti-Ottoman sentiments, and in his spirit of the age-long Iranian Ottoman confrontation he ventured into his writing on the victory of Shah Abbas I over the Turks at Baghdad. Akhundzade is counted as one of the founders of modern Iranian literature, and his formative influence is visible in such major Persian-language writers as [[Mirza Malkom Khan|Malkum Khan]], [[Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani|Mirza Agha Khan]] and [[Mirza Abdul'Rahim Talibov Tabrizi|Mirza Abd ul-Rahim Talibov Tabrizi]]. All of them were advocates of reforms in Iran.  If Akhundzade had no doubt that his spiritual homeland was Iran, Azerbaijan was the land he grew up and whose language was his native tongue. His lyrical poetry was written in Persian, but his work that carry messages of social importance as written in the language of the people of his native land, azari. With no indication of split-personality, he combined larger Iranian identity with Azerbaijani – he used the term vatan (fatherland) in reference to both.&lt;ref name="Tadeusz"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reza Zia-Ebrahimi too considers Akhundzade as the founding-father of what he calls 'dislocative nationalism' in Iran. According to Zia-Ebrahimi, Akhundzade found inspiration in Orientalist templates to construct a vision of ancient Iran, which offered intellectuals disgruntled with the pace of modernist reform in Iran, a self-serving narrative where all of Iran's shortcomings are blamed on a monolithic and otherized 'other': the Arab. For Zia-Ebrahimi, Akhundzade must be credit with the introduction of ethno-racial ideas, particularly the opposition between the Iranian Aryan and the Arab Semite, into Iran's intellectual debates. Zia-Ebrahimi disputes that Akhundzade had any influence on modernist intellectuals such as [[Mirza Malkom Khan|Malkum Khan]] (beyond a common project to reform the Alphabet used to write Persian) or [[Mirza Abdul'Rahim Talibov Tabrizi|Talibov Tabrizi]]. His real heir was [[Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani|Kermani]], and these two intellectuals' legacy is to be found in the ethnic nationalism of the Pahlavi state, rather than the civic nationalism of the Constitutional movement.&lt;ref name="zia-ebrahimi book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zia-Ebrahimi|first1=Reza|title=The emergence of Iranian nationalism: Race and the politics of dislocation|date=2016|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, the [[Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre]] was named after Akhundzade.

== Iranian nationalism ==
Akhundzade identified himself as belonging to the nation of Iran (mellat-e Irān) and to the Iranian homeland (waṭan). He corresponded with Jālāl-al-Din Mirzā (a minor Qajar prince, son of [[Bahman Mirza Qajar]],1826–70) and admired this latter's epic Nāmeh-ye Khosrovān ('Book of Sovereigns'), which was an attempt to offer the modern reader a biography of Iran's ancient kings, real and mythical, without recourse to any Arabic loanword. The Nāmeh presented the pre-Islamic past as one of grandeur, and the advent of Islam as a radical rupture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zia-Ebrahimi|first1=Reza|title=The emergence of Iranian nationalism: Race and the politics of dislocation|date=2016|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=36–38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Zia-Ebrahimi, Akhundzade is the founder of what he refers to as 'dislocative nationalism'. Zia-Ebrahimi defines dislocative nationalism as

'an operation that takes place in the realm of the imagination, an operation whereby the Iranian nation is dislodged   from its empirical reality as a majority-Muslim society situated - broadly - in the "East". Iran is presented as an Aryan nation adrift, by accident, as it were, from the rest of its fellow Aryans (read: Europeans).'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zia-Ebrahimi|first1=Reza|title=The emergence of Iranian nationalism: Race and the politics of dislocation|date=2016|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dislocative nationalism is thus predicated on more than a total distinction between supposedly Aryan Iranians and Semitic Arabs, as it is suggested that the two races are incompatible and in opposition to each other. These ideas are directly indebted to nineteenth-century racial thought, particularly the Aryan race hypothesis developed by European comparative philologists (a hypothesis that Zia-Ebrahimi discusses at length &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zia-Ebrahimi|first1=Reza|title=Self-Orientalization and dislocation: The uses and abuses of the "Aryan discourse" in Iran|journal=Iranian Studies|date=2011|volume=44|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Dislocative nationalism presents the pre-Islamic past as the site of a timeless Iranian essence, dismisses the Islamic period as one of decay, and blames all of Iran's shortcomings in the nineteenth and later twentieth century on Arabs and the adoption of Islam. The advent of Islam is thus ethnicised into an 'Arab invasion' and perceived as a case of racial contamination or miscegenation. According to Zia-Ebrahimi, dislocative nationalism does not, in itself, offer a blueprint for reforming the state beyond calls to eliminate what it arbitrarily defines as the legacy of Arabs: Islam and Arabic loanwords.

[[Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani]] (1854–96) was one of Akhundzades disciples, and three decades later will endeavour to disseminate Akhundzade's thought while also significantly strengthening its racial content (Zia-Ebrahimi argues that Kermani was the first to retrieve the idea of 'the Aryan race' from European texts and refer to it as such, the modern idea of race here being different to the various cognates of the term 'Ariya' that one finds in ancient sources). Mirza Aqa Khan Kermani also followed Jalāl-al-Din Mirzā in producing a national history of Iran, Āʾine-ye sekandari (The Alexandrian Mirror), extending from the mythological past to the Qajar era, again to contrast a mythified and fantasised pre-Islamic past with a present that falls short of nationalist expectations.&lt;ref name=AshrafIdentity&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Ashraf |first=AHMAD | title= IRANIAN IDENTITY iv. 19TH-20TH CENTURIES | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Iranica | accessdate=18 September 2011|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/iranian-identity-iv-19th-20th-centuries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zia-Ebrahimi sees dislocative nationalism as the dominant paradigm of identity in modern Iran, as it became part and parcel of the official ideology of the Pahlavi State (1925–79) and thus disseminated through mass-schooling, propaganda, and the state's symbolic repertoire.

== Alphabet Reform ==
Well ahead of his time, Akhundzade was a keen advocate for alphabet reform, recognizing deficiencies of [[Perso-Arabic script]] with regards to [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] sounds.  He began his work regarding alphabet reform in 1850.  His first efforts focused on modifying the Perso-Arabic script so that it would more adequately satisfy the phonetic requirements of the [[Azerbaijani language]]. First, he insisted that each sound be represented by a separate symbol - no duplications or omissions.  The Perso-Arabic script expresses only three vowel sounds, whereas Azeri needs to identify nine vowels.  Later, he openly advocated the change from Perso-Arabic to a modified Latin alphabet.  The Latin script which was used in [[Azerbaijan SSR|Azerbaijan]] between 1922 and 1939, and the Latin script which is used now, were based on Akhundzade's third version.

==Legacy==

Beside of his role in [[Azerbaijani literature]] and [[Iranian nationalism]], Akhundzadeh was also known for his harsh criticisms of religions (mainly [[Islam]]) and stays as the most iconic Azerbaijani atheist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atheism.su/axundov-m-f/ Ахундов М. Ф. - Великие люди - Атеисты]&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Library of Azerbaijan]] and [[Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre]] as well as couple of streets, parks and libraries are also named after Akhundzade in Azerbaijan. A cultural museum in [[Tbilisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] that focuses on Georgian-Azerbaijani cultural relations is also named after him.

[[Punik]], town in [[Armenia]] was also named in the honour of Akhundzade until very recently. [[TURKSOY]] hosted a groundbreaking ceremony to declare 2012 as year of Mirza Fatali Akhundzade.

He published many works on literary criticism:
* ''Qirītīkah'' ("Criticism")
* ''Risālah-i īrād'' ("Fault-finding treatise")

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10574">'''Mizrahi Hebrew''', or '''Eastern Hebrew''', refers to any of the pronunciation systems for [[Biblical Hebrew]] used liturgically by [[Mizrahi Jews]]: [[Jews]] from [[Arab world|Arab countries]] or east of them and with a background of [[Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]] or other languages of the [[Middle East]] and [[Asia]]. As such, Mizrahi Hebrew is actually a blanket term for many dialects.

[[Sephardi Hebrew]] is not considered one of these, even if it has been spoken in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. The Sephardim were expellees from [[Spain]] and settled among the Mizrahim, but in countries such as Syria and Morocco, there was a fairly high degree of convergence between the Sephardi and the local pronunciations of Hebrew. [[Yemenite Hebrew]] is also considered quite separate, as it has a wholly different system for the pronunciation of vowels.

The same terms are sometimes used for the pronunciation of [[Modern Hebrew]] by Jews of Mizrahi origins. It is generally a compromise between Modern Standard Hebrew and the traditional liturgical pronunciation as described in this article. A common form of such compromise is the use of {{IPAblink|ħ}} and {{IPAblink|ʕ}} for {{hebrew|ח}} and {{hebrew|ע}}, respectively, with most or all other sounds pronounced as in Standard Israeli Hebrew.

==Features==

The following features are generally found in the pronunciation of Jews from Arabic-speaking countries, and the variations tend to follow the [[Arabic dialect]] of the country in question:
*The stress tends to fall on the last [[syllable]] wherever that is the case in [[Biblical Hebrew]].
*{{hebrew|א}} (''Aleph'') is pronounced with a clear glottal stop {{IPAblink|ʔ}} except when it is used as a [[mater lectionis]].
*{{hebrew|ב}} (''Bet'' without ''dagesh'') is pronounced {{IPAblink|b}} in some countries (such as Iraq) and {{IPAblink|v}} ([[voiced labiodental fricative]]) in others (such as Morocco).&lt;ref&gt;The {{IPAblink|b}} presumably reflects the influence of Arabic, which has no {{IPAblink|v}}. The {{IPAblink|v}} pronunciation may reflect the influence of Sephardic immigrants from and after 1492, as it is also found in the pronunciation of Ottoman Sephardim (but not all Sephardim: see [[Sephardi Hebrew#Variants|Sephardi Hebrew]]). The pronunciation before 1492, both in Spain and in Arabic-speaking countries, is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{hebrew|ג}} (''Gimel'' without ''dagesh'') is pronounced {{IPA|[ɣ]}} ([[voiced velar fricative]]) like Arabic غ.
*{{hebrew|ד}} (''Dalet'' without ''dagesh'') is normally pronounced {{IPA|[d]}}, but occasionally (such as in the Iraqi pronunciation of the words ''adonai'' and, in the [[Shema]] only, ''eḥad'') {{IPAblink|ð}}, like Arabic ذ ([[voiced dental fricative]]).
*{{hebrew|ו}} (''Vav'') is pronounced {{IPAblink|v}} in some countries and {{IPAblink|w}} in others (such Iraq).
*{{hebrew|ח}} (''Ḥet'') is pronounced {{IPA|[ħ]}}, like Arabic ح ([[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]]).
*{{hebrew|ט}} (''Tet'') is pronounced {{IPA|[tˤ]}}, like Arabic ط ([[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] [[voiceless dental and alveolar stops|voiceless alveolar stops]]).
*{{hebrew|כ}} (''Kaph'') is pronounced {{IPA|[x]}}, ([[voiceless velar fricative]]).
*{{hebrew|ע}} (''Ayin'') is pronounced {{IPA|[ʕ]}}, like Arabic ع ([[voiced pharyngeal fricative]]).
*{{hebrew|צ}} (''Tsade'') is pronounced {{IPA|[sˤ]}}, like Arabic ص (pharyngealized [[voiceless alveolar fricative]]).
*{{hebrew|ק}} (''Qof'') is usually pronounced {{IPAblink|q}} like Arabic ق ([[voiceless uvular stop]]), but other sounds occur such as {{IPAblink|k}}, {{IPAblink|ɡ}} or {{IPAblink|ʔ}} ([[glottal stop]]).
*{{hebrew|ר}} (''Resh'') is invariably [[dental, alveolar and postalveolar trills|trilled]] {{IPAblink|r}}, even among [[Baghdadi Jews]], who pronounced the equivalent letter in [[Judaeo-Arabic]] as a uvular {{IPAblink|ʀ}}, close to Arabic غ.&lt;ref&gt;Baghdad Jews traditionally used the uvular sound in Judaeo-Arabic. The peculiarity has been present for centuries, as old manuscript translations of the Bible into Iraqi Judaeo-Arabic often confuse ''ra'' with ''ghayn'', but that mistake is not found in translations into other dialects (Avishur, Yitzhak, ''Studies in Judaeo-Arabic Translations of the Bible'').&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{hebrew|ת}} (''Tav'' without ''dagesh'') is pronounced {{IPA|[t]}} in some countries and {{IPAblink|θ}}, like Arabic ث ([[voiceless dental fricative]]), in others (such as Iraq).&lt;ref&gt;The difference usually follows differences in the local dialect of Arabic; however, Sephardim are divided on the pronunciation of this letter, with {{IPAblink|t}} predominating.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Vowels generally have the same sounds as in [[Sephardi Hebrew]]:
**[[Niqqud|Tsere]] is pronounced {{IPA|[eː]}}.
**[[Niqqud|Holam]] is pronounced {{IPA|[oː]}}.
**[[Niqqud|Kamatz gadol]] is pronounced {{IPA|[aː]}}.

The pronunciation of Mizrahi Jews from non-Arab countries differs in some respects.  For example, among [[Persian Jews]], distinctively Arabic sounds such as ح {{IPA|[ħ]}} and ط {{IPA|[tˤ]}} do not occur, and [[Niqqud|Kamatz gadol]] is pronounced {{IPAblink|ɒ}}, like the long ''a'' in Persian.

==History==

In [[Talmud|Talmudic]] times, it was noted that the Galilean (and maybe Syrian) pronunciation of Hebrew and Aramaic differed from those of both Judaea and Babylonia, principally by the loss of distinct sounds for the guttural letters ''he'', ''ḥet'' and ''ʿayin''. That feature is still found in [[Samaritan Hebrew]].

After the Arab conquest of Palestine and Mesopotamia, much work was done by the [[Masoretes]] in standardising and refining the pronunciation of Biblical Hebrew, under the influence of the Arabic grammarians of the time. That included establishing the pronunciation of the guttural letters by reference to their Arabic equivalents. Three distinct notations for the vowels were devised: the [[Palestinian vocalization|Palestinian]], the [[Babylonian vocalization|Babylonian]] and the [[Tiberian vocalization|Tiberian]], the last of which eventually superseded the others.

The distinctive Babylonian pronunciation of [[Geonim|Geonic]] times is still preserved by [[Yemenite Jews]], but they do not retain the Babylonian notation. In Iraq, it appears to have been superseded by the Palestinian pronunciation (similar to today's [[Sephardi Hebrew]]) in or around the 11th century, when the Tiberian notation was adopted: both [[Saadia Gaon]] and [[Jacob Qirqisani]] report that in their time the Palestinian pronunciation had come to be regarded as standard.&lt;ref&gt;S. Morag, article on "Pronunciations of Hebrew" in ''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', vol. 3 pp. 1120-1145; ''The Hebrew Language Tradition of the Baghdadi Community'' (1977), ed. S. Morag (Hebrew), pp 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in their reading of unvocalised texts such as the [[Mishnah]], Baghdadi Jews preserve certain peculiarities of the old Babylonian pronunciation, particularly with their choices between ''dagesh'' and ''rafe'' and between silent and vocal ''sheva''.&lt;ref&gt;Morag (above), throughout.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of assimilation to Arabic went the furthest with the Babylonian Jews. For example, in [[Classical Arabic]] and in some spoken dialects including [[Mesopotamian Arabic]], there is no phonemic distinction between ''a'' and ''e'', but a phonetic difference is made by the presence of an adjacent emphatic or guttural consonant. Accordingly, the Babylonian notation does not distinguish between ''[[patach]]'' (in other pronunciations {{IPA|[a]}}), ''[[segol]]'' (in other pronunciations {{IPA|[e]}} or {{IPA|[ɛ]}}) and ''[[Shva|sheva na']]'', and the three vowels are still pronounced alike (as {{IPA|[æ]}}) bu [[Yemenite Jews]]. In [[Levantine Arabic]], by contrast, there are distinct "a" and "e" sounds, and both vowels are distinguished in both the Palestinian and the Tiberian notations.&lt;ref&gt;However, the distinction is differently applied in Tiberian Hebrew and Levantine Arabic. For example, the feminine ending is "-ah" in Tiberian Hebrew and "-é" in Levantine Arabic.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the expulsion of the [[Sephardi Jews]] from Spain in 1492, the exiles took the leading position in most Arab and Ottoman countries, and the local pronunciation of Hebrew assimilated to Sephardi Hebrew in many respects, particularly for pronouncing the vowels.  Today's Iraqi Jews distinguish between ''patach'' ({{IPA|/a/}}) and ''segol'' ({{IPA|/e/}}) in the same way as most other Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews. However, distinct sounds for the guttural and emphatic letters and the {{IPA|[b]}} sound for ''bet rafe'' were retained in many Arab countries, probably under the influence of Arabic.

Iraqi Jews, like Yemenite Jews, retain the [[Classical Arabic]] sounds of ''waw'' ({{IPA|[w]}}) and ''tav raphe'' ({{IPA|[θ]}}). In other Arab countries, ''tav raphe'' is pronounced {{IPA|[t]}}, which is equally consistent with the pronunciation of both Sephardi Hebrew and of colloquial Arabic. The pronunciation of ''waw'' as {{IPA|[v]}}, in countries other than Iraq and Yemen, is more clearly Sephardic in origin.&lt;ref&gt;However, Arabic /w/ becomes {{IPA|[v]}} in some North African dialects, in [[Persian language|Persian]] and in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mundurukú''' is a [[Tupian languages|Tupi language]] spoken by 10,000 people in the Tapajós River basin in north central [[Brazil]], of which most of the women and children are monolingual.

== Phonology ==

=== Phoneme inventory ===

==== Consonants ====
* Voiceless stops {{IPA|/p, t, tʃ, k, ʔ/}}
* Voiced stops {{IPA|/b, dʒ/}}
* Flap {{IPA|/ɾ/}}
* Voiceless fricatives {{IPA|/s, ʃ, h/}}
* Nasals {{IPA|/m, n, ŋ/}}
* Semi-vowels {{IPA|/w, j/}}

==== Vowels ====
* High vowels: {{IPA|/ɨ, ɨ̃, i, ĩ, u, ũ /}}
* High-mid vowels: {{IPA|/e, ẽ/}}
* Mid vowels  {{IPA|/ə̃, ə/}}
* Low vowels {{IPA|/ã, a/}}

=== Syllable structure ===
The syllable in Munduruku is made up of an obligatory vocalic nucleus and one of four phonemic accents (three of [[Pitch accent|pitch]] and one of laryngealization). It may also have an [[Syllable onset|onset]] or [[Syllable coda|coda]]. No [[consonant cluster]]s are permitted. Thus, the permissible syllables are CV, CVC, V, and VC (with V being the most rare).

==== Onset ====

The onset in this language may be any one of the 16 consonant phonemes which contrast as to the manner and [[point of articulation]]: (1) voiceless stops /p, t, k, tʃ, k, ʔ/; (2) Voiced stops /b, [[Voiced postalveolar affricate|dʒ]]/; (3) Fricatives /s, ʃ, h/, (4) nasals /m, n, ŋ/, (5) Sonorants /w, y, r/

==== Coda ====
The only segment not allowed in the coda is /tʃ/. Observe that CVj and CVw are considered CVC syllables, and not CV.V ones for a variety of reasons; one is that it would require positing a new syllable pattern limited to CVu and CVi with no other vowels occurring in coda position.  There is also phonetic contrast between /i, u/ as vowel nuclei and /y, w/ as codas. The former being distinctly vocalic and the latter consonantal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Anthropological Linguistics|volume=7|issue=7|jstor= 30013071|last=Braun |first=Ilse |author2=Marjorie Crofts |title=Mundruku phonology|pages=25|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nucleus ====
The syllabic nucleus is limited to only one vowel.

=== Accent ===
Accent is considered a feature of the entire syllable rather than of the nucleus only. One accent occurs with each syllable. Note that the functional load of accent is light—only some 40 lexical pairs with contrastive accents have been found and few grammatical contrasts are marked by accent alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Anthropological Linguistics|volume=7|issue=7|jstor= 30013071|last=Braun |first=Ilse |author2=Marjorie Crofts |title=Mundruku phonology|pages=27|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Northern Qiang''' is a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language]] of the [[Qiangic languages|Qiangic branch]] spoken by approximately 60,000 people in north-central [[Sichuan Province]], [[China]].

Unlike its close relative [[Southern Qiang language|Southern Qiang]], Northern Qiang is not a [[tonal language]].

== Northern Qiang dialects ==

Northern Qiang is composed of several different dialects, many of which are easily mutually intelligible. [[Sun Hongkai]] in his book on Qiang in 1981 divides Northern Qiang into the following dialects: Luhua, Mawo, Zhimulin, Weigu, and Yadu. These dialects are located in [[Heishui County]] as well as the northern part of [[Mao County]]. The Luhua, Mawo, Zhimulin, and Weigu varieties of Northern Qiang are spoken by the Heishui Tibetans. The Mawo dialect is considered to be the prestige dialect by the Heishui Tibetans.

Names seen in the older literature for Northern Qiang dialects include ''Dzorgai (Sifan), Kortsè (Sifan), Krehchuh,'' and ''Thóchú/Thotcu/Thotśu.'' The last is a place name.&lt;ref&gt;UC Berkeley, 1992, ''Linguistics of the Tibeto-Burman Area'', vol. 15, pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
As with many of the [[Qiangic languages]], Northern Qiang is becoming increasingly threatened. Because the education system largely uses [[Standard Chinese]] as a medium of instruction for the Qiang people, and as a result of the universal access to schooling and TV, most Qiang children are fluent or even monolingual in Chinese while an increasing percentage cannot speak Qiang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d5Nvuh7MQlYC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A Grammar of Qiang: With annotated texts and glossary |author= Randy J.

{{Norwegian-people}}
'''Norwegian''' ({{lang|no|norsk}}) is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] [[language]] spoken mainly in [[Norway]], where it is the official language. Along with [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], Norwegian forms a [[dialect continuum]] of more or less [[mutually intelligible]] local and regional varieties, and some Norwegian and Swedish dialects, in particular, are very close. These [[Scandinavia]]n languages, together with [[Faroese language|Faroese]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] as well as some extinct languages, constitute the North Germanic languages. Faroese and Icelandic are hardly mutually intelligible with Norwegian in their spoken form because continental Scandinavian has diverged from them. While the two Germanic languages with the greatest numbers of speakers, [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], have close similarities with Norwegian, neither is mutually intelligible with it.

There are two official forms of {{em|written}} Norwegian, ''[[Bokmål]]'' (literally "book tongue") and ''[[Nynorsk]]'' ("new Norwegian"), each with its own variants. Norwegian is one of the two official languages in Norway.  The other is [[Sami language|Sami]], spoken by some members of the Sami people, mostly in the Northern part of Norway.  Norwegian and Sami are not mutually intelligible, as Sami belongs to the Finno-Ugric group of languages.  Sami is spoken by less than one percent of people in Norway.

Norwegian is one of the working languages of the [[Nordic Council]]. Under the [[Nordic Language Convention]], citizens of the [[Nordic countries]] who speak Norwegian have the opportunity to use their native language when interacting with official bodies in other Nordic countries without being liable to any [[interpreting|interpretation]] or [[translation]] costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/avtal/utbildning/sk/sprak.asp |title=Konvention mellan Sverige, Danmark, Finland, Island och Norge om nordiska medborgares rätt att använda sitt eget språk i annat nordiskt land |trans-title=Convention between Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway on the right of Nordic citizens to use their own language in another Nordic country |date=2 May 2007 |website=[[Nordic Council]] |language=no |access-date=4 May 2008 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220234459/http://www.norden.org/avtal/utbildning/sk/sprak.asp |archive-date=20 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6777&amp;lang=6 |title=20th anniversary of the Nordic Language Convention |date=22 February 2007 |website=Nordic Council |access-date=25 April 2007 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227013320/http://www.norden.org/webb/news/news.asp?id=6777&amp;lang=6 |archive-date=27 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
{{Old Norse language map}}

Like most of the languages in Europe, the Norwegian language descends from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] spoken about 5500 years ago on the [[Pontic–Caspian steppe]] north of the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anthony |first1=David W. |title=The Horse, the Wheel, and Language : How bronze-age riders from the Eurasian steppes shaped the modern world |date=2007 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |isbn=0-691-05887-3 |edition=8th reprint.}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early Indo-Europeans spread across Europe, they became isolated and new languages evolved. In the northwest of Europe, the [[West Germanic languages]] evolved, which would eventually become [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], and the [[North Germanic languages]], of which Norwegian is one.
 
[[Proto-Norse]] is thought to have evolved as a northern dialect of [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] during the first centuries AD. It is the earliest stage of a characteristically North Germanic language, and the language [[Attested language|attested]] in the [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions, the oldest form of the [[runic alphabets]]. A number of inscriptions are memorials to the dead, while others are magical in content. The oldest are carved on loose objects, while later ones are chiseled in [[runestone]]s.&lt;ref name="scan-langs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Scandinavian-languages |title=Scandinavian languages |first1=Jan Terje |last1=Faarlund |first2=Einar |last2=Haugen |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |accessdate=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the oldest written record of any Germanic language.

Around 800 AD, the script was simplified to the [[Younger Futhark]], and inscriptions became more abundant. At the same time, the beginning of the [[Viking Age]] led to the spread of [[Old Norse]] to [[Iceland]], [[Greenland]], and the [[Faroe Islands]]. Viking colonies also existed in parts of the [[British Isles]], France ([[Normandy]]), and [[Russia]]. In all of these places except Iceland and the Faroes, Old Norse speakers went extinct or were absorbed into the local population.&lt;ref name="scan-langs"/&gt;

===The Roman alphabet===
Around 1030, Christianity came to Scandinavia, bringing with it an influx of [[Latin]] borrowings and the [[Roman alphabet]]. These new words were related to [[Catholic church|church]] practices and ceremonies, although many other loanwords related to general culture also entered the language.

The Scandinavian languages at this time are not considered to be separate languages, although there were minor differences among what are customarily called Old Icelandic, [[Old Norwegian]], [[Old Gutnish]], Old Danish, and [[Old Swedish]].

===Low German influence===
The economic and political dominance of the [[Hanseatic League]] between 1250 and 1450 in the main Scandinavian cities brought large [[Middle Low German]]-speaking populations to Norway. The influence of their language on Scandinavian is similar to that of [[French language|French]] on English after the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]].&lt;ref name="scan-langs"/&gt;

===Dano-Norwegian===
In the late Middle Ages, dialects began to develop in Scandinavia because the population was rural and little travel occurred. When the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] came from Germany, [[Martin Luther]]'s [[Upper German|High German]] translation of the Bible was quickly translated into Swedish, Danish, and Icelandic. Norway entered a union with Denmark in 1397. Danish was the language of the elite, the church, literature, and the law. When the union with Denmark ended in 1814, the [[Dano-Norwegian]] [[koiné language|''koiné'']] had become the mother tongue of many Norwegians.&lt;ref name="now"&gt;{{cite web  |url=https://www.ntnu.edu/now/intro/background-norwegian |title=The Norwegian language |first=Olaf |last=Husby |date=October 2010 |website=Norwegian on the Web |accessdate=11 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Danish to Norwegian===
{{Main|Norwegian language struggle}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
{{split|Samnorsk|date=January 2017}}
From the 1840s, some writers experimented with a Norwegianised Danish by incorporating words that were descriptive of Norwegian scenery and folk life, and adopting a more Norwegian syntax. [[Knud Knudsen (linguist)|Knud Knudsen]] proposed to change spelling and inflection in accordance with the Dano-Norwegian ''koiné'', known as "cultivated everyday speech." A small adjustment in this direction was implemented in the first official reform of the Danish language in Norway in 1862 and more extensively after his death in two official reforms in 1907 and 1917.

Meanwhile, a nationalistic movement strove for the development of a new written Norwegian. [[Ivar Aasen]], a botanist and self-taught linguist, began his work to create a new Norwegian language at the age of 22. He traveled around the country collecting words and examples of grammar from the dialects and comparing the dialects among the different regions. He examined the development of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which had largely escaped the influences under which Norwegian had come. He called his work, which was published in several books from 1848 to 1873, [[Landsmål]], meaning "national language". The name "Landsmål" is sometimes interpreted as "rural language" or "country language", but this was clearly not Aasen's intended meaning.

The name of the Danish language in Norway was a topic of hot dispute through the 19th century. Its proponents claimed that it was a language common to Norway and Denmark, and no more Danish than Norwegian. The proponents of Landsmål thought that the Danish character of the language should not be concealed. In 1899, [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] proposed the neutral name [[Riksmål]], meaning national language like Landsmål, and this was officially adopted along with the 1907 spelling reform. The name "Riksmål" is sometimes interpreted as "state language", but this meaning is secondary at best. (Compare to [[Danish language|Danish rigsmål]] from where the name was borrowed.)

After the personal union with Sweden was dissolved in 1905, both languages were developed further and reached what is now considered their classic forms after a reform in 1917. Riksmål was in 1929 officially renamed ''Bokmål'' (literally "book language"), and Landsmål to ''Nynorsk'' (literally "new Norwegian"). A proposition to substitute Danish-Norwegian (''dansk-norsk'') for ''Bokmål'' lost in parliament by a single vote. The name ''Nynorsk'', the linguistic term for [[modern Norwegian]], was chosen to contrast with Danish and emphasis on the historical connection to Old Norwegian. Today, this meaning is often lost, and it is commonly mistaken as a "new" Norwegian in contrast to the "real" Norwegian Bokmål.

Bokmål and Nynorsk were made closer by a reform in 1938. This was a result of a state policy to merge Nynorsk and Bokmål into a single language, to be called ''Samnorsk''. A 1946 poll showed that this policy was supported by 79% of Norwegians at the time. However, opponents of the official policy still managed to create a massive protest movement against ''Samnorsk'' in the 1950s, fighting in particular the use of "radical" forms in Bokmål text books in schools. In the reform in 1959, the 1938 reform was partially reversed in Bokmål, but Nynorsk was changed further towards Bokmål. Since then Bokmål has reverted even further toward traditional Riksmål, while Nynorsk still adheres to the 1959 standard. Therefore, a small minority of Nynorsk enthusiasts use a more conservative standard called [[Høgnorsk]]. The Samnorsk policy had little influence after 1960, and was officially abandoned in 2002.

The retroflex consonants only appear in East Norwegian dialects as a result of [[sandhi]], combining {{IPA|/ɾ/}} with {{IPA|/d/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/n/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, and {{IPA|/t/}}.

The realization of the rhotic {{IPA|/ɾ/}} depends on the dialect. In Eastern, Central, and Northern Norwegian dialects, it is a tap {{IPA|[ɾ]}}, whereas in Western and Southern Norway, and for some speakers also in Eastern Norway, it is rendered more gutturally as {{IPA|[χ]}} or {{IPA|[ʁ]}}. And in the dialects of North-Western Norway, it is realized as {{IPA|[r]}}, much like the trilled R of Spanish.

===Accent===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Tone (linguistics)]] --&gt;
Norwegian is a [[pitch-accent language]] with two distinct pitch patterns, like Swedish. They are used to differentiate two-syllable words with otherwise identical pronunciation. For example, in many East Norwegian dialects, the word "{{lang|no|bønder}}" (farmers) is pronounced using tone 1, while "{{lang|no|bønner}}" (beans or prayers) uses tone 2. Though spelling differences occasionally differentiate written words, in most cases the minimal pairs are written alike, since written Norwegian has no explicit accent marks. In most eastern low-tone dialects, accent 1 uses a low flat pitch in the first syllable, while accent 2 uses a high, sharply falling pitch in the first syllable and a low pitch in the beginning of the second syllable. In both accents, these pitch movements are followed by a rise of [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]al nature (phrase accent)—the size (and presence) of which signals emphasis or focus, and corresponds in function to the normal accent in languages that lack [[tone (linguistics)|lexical tone]], such as English. That rise culminates in the final syllable of an accentual phrase, while the utterance-final fall common in most languages is either very small or absent.

There are significant variations in pitch accent between dialects. Thus, in most of western and northern Norway (the so-called high-pitch dialects) accent 1 is falling, while accent 2 is rising in the first syllable and falling in the second syllable or somewhere around the syllable boundary. The pitch accents (as well as the peculiar phrase accent in the low-tone dialects) give the Norwegian language a "singing" quality that makes it easy to distinguish from other languages. Accent 1 generally occurs in words that were monosyllabic in [[Old Norse]], and accent 2 in words that were polysyllabic.

===Alphabet===
{{Main|Danish and Norwegian alphabet}}
The Norwegian alphabet has 29 letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sprakradet.no/Vi-og-vart/Publikasjoner/Spraaknytt/Arkivet/Spraaknytt_2001/Spraaknytt_2001_4/Bokstaver_og_alfabet/ |title=Bokstaver og alfabet |trans-title=Letters and alphabet |last=Torp |first=Arne |number=4 |date=2001 |journal=Språknytt |language=no |publisher=[[Language Council of Norway|Språkrådet]] |pages=1–4 |access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

The letters ''c'', ''q'', ''w'', ''x'' and ''z'' are only used in [[loanword]]s. As loanwords are assimilated into Norwegian, their spelling might change to reflect Norwegian pronunciation and the principles of Norwegian orthography, e.g. ''[[zebra]]'' in Norwegian is written ''sebra''. Due to historical reasons, some otherwise Norwegian family names are also written using these letters.

Some letters may be modified by [[diacritic]]s: ''é'', ''è'', ''ê'', ''ó'', ''ò'', and ''ô''. In Nynorsk, ''ì'' and ''ù'' and ''ỳ'' are occasionally seen as well. The diacritics are not compulsory, but may in a few cases distinguish between different meanings of the word, e.g.: for (for/to), fór (went), fòr (furrow) and fôr (fodder). Loanwords may be spelled with other diacritics, most notably ''ü'', ''á'' and ''à''.

===Bokmål and Nynorsk===
{{Main|Bokmål|Nynorsk}}
As established by law and government policy, the two official forms of ''written'' Norwegian are ''[[Bokmål]]'' (literally "book tongue") and ''[[Nynorsk]]'' ("new Norwegian"). The official [[Norwegian Language Council]] (''Språkrådet'') is responsible for regulating the two forms, and recommends the terms "Norwegian Bokmål" and "Norwegian Nynorsk" in English.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} Two other written forms without official status also exist, one, called ''[[Riksmål]]'' ("national language"), is today to a large extent the same language as Bokmål though somewhat closer to the Danish language. It is regulated by the unofficial [[Norwegian Academy]], which translates the name as "Standard Norwegian". The other is ''[[Høgnorsk]]'' ("High Norwegian"), a more [[Linguistic purism|purist]] form of Nynorsk, which maintains the language in an original form as given by [[Ivar Aasen]] and rejects most of the reforms from the 20th century; this form has limited use.

Nynorsk and Bokmål provide standards for how to write Norwegian, but not for how to speak the language. No standard of spoken Norwegian is officially sanctioned, and most [[Norwegian dialects|Norwegians speak their own dialects]] in all circumstances. Thus, unlike in many other countries, the use of any Norwegian dialect, whether it coincides with the written norms or not, is accepted as correct ''spoken'' Norwegian. However, in areas where [[Norwegian dialects|East Norwegian dialects]] are used, a tendency exists to accept a ''de facto'' spoken standard for this particular regional dialect, ''[[Urban East Norwegian]]'' or ''Standard East Norwegian'' ({{lang-no|Standard Østnorsk| links=no}}), in which the vocabulary coincides with Bokmål.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/sin/article/viewFile/17027/14789 |title=Om begrepene språklig standard og språklig standardisering |trans-title=About the terms linguistic standard and linguistic standardization |last=Vannebo |first=Kjell Ivar |journal=Sprog i Norden |language=no |date=2001 |pages=119–128 |access-date=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kristoffersen"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kristoffersen |first=Gjert |authorlink=Gjert Kristoffersen |title=The Phonology of Norwegian |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |pages=6–11 |isbn=978-0-19-823765-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside [[Eastern Norway]], this spoken variation is not used.

From the 16th to the 19th centuries, Danish was the standard written language of Norway. As a result, the development of modern written Norwegian has been subject to strong controversy related to [[nationalism]], rural versus urban discourse, and Norway's literary history. Historically, Bokmål is a Norwegianised variety of Danish, while Nynorsk is a language form based on Norwegian dialects and puristic opposition to Danish. The now-abandoned official policy to merge Bokmål and Nynorsk into one common language called ''Samnorsk'' through a series of spelling reforms has created a wide spectrum of varieties of both Bokmål and Nynorsk. The unofficial form known as ''Riksmål'' is considered more [[conservative (language)|conservative]] than Bokmål and is far closer to Danish while the unofficial ''Høgnorsk'' is more conservative than Nynorsk and is far closer to [[Faroese language|Faroese]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Old Norse]].

Norwegians are educated in both Bokmål and Nynorsk. The language form that is not registered as the main language form of a Norwegian student will be a mandatory school subject in both high school and elementary school for the student, which is called Sidemål.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.udir.no/kl06/NOR1-05|title=Læreplan i norsk (NOR1-05)|website=www.udir.no|language=nb|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a Norwegian with Bokmål as its main language form has Nynorsk as a mandatory school subject throughout both high school and elementary school. A 2005 poll indicates that 86.3% use primarily Bokmål as their daily written language, 5.5% use both Bokmål and Nynorsk, and 7.5% use primarily Nynorsk.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} Thus, 13% are frequently ''writing'' Nynorsk, though the majority ''speak'' dialects that resemble Nynorsk more closely than Bokmål.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.apollon.uio.no/vis/art/1998/1/dialekt |last=Venås |first=Kjell |year=1994 |title=Dialekt og normaltalemålet |trans-title=Dialect and normal speech |journal=Apollon |language=no |volume=1 |issn=0803-6926 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724185459/http://www.apollon.uio.no/vis/art/1998/1/dialekt |archivedate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broadly speaking, Nynorsk writing is widespread in western Norway, though not in major urban areas, and also in the upper parts of mountain valleys in the southern and eastern parts of Norway. Examples are [[Setesdal]], the western part of [[Telemark]] county (''fylke'') and several municipalities in [[Hallingdal]], [[Valdres]], and [[Gudbrandsdalen]]. It is little used elsewhere, but 30–40 years ago, it also had strongholds in many rural parts of [[Trøndelag]] (mid-Norway) and the southern part of northern Norway ([[Nordland]] county). Today, not only is Nynorsk the official language of four of the 19 Norwegian counties, but also of many municipalities in five other counties. [[NRK]], the Norwegian broadcasting corporation, broadcasts in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, and all governmental agencies are required to support both written languages. Bokmål is used in 92% of all written publications, and Nynorsk in 8% (2000).{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Like some other European countries, Norway has an official "advisory board"{{mdash}} [[Norwegian Language Council|Språkrådet]] (Norwegian Language Council){{mdash}} that determines, after approval from the Ministry of Culture, official spelling, grammar, and vocabulary for the Norwegian language. The board's work has been subject to considerable controversy throughout the years.

Both Nynorsk and Bokmål have a great variety of optional forms. The Bokmål that uses the forms that are close to Riksmål is called ''moderate'' or ''conservative'', depending on one's viewpoint, while the Bokmål that uses the forms that are close to Nynorsk is called ''radical''. Nynorsk has forms that are close to the original Landsmål and forms that are close to Bokmål.

===Riksmål===
{{Main|Riksmål}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
[[File:Målformer i Norge.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Map of the official language forms of Norwegian municipalities. Red is Bokmål, blue is [[Nynorsk]] and gray depicts neutral areas.]]
Opponents of the spelling reforms aimed at bringing Bokmål closer to Nynorsk have retained the name Riksmål and employ spelling and grammar that predate the Samnorsk movement. Riksmål and conservative versions of Bokmål have been the ''de facto'' standard written language of Norway for most of the 20th century, being used by large newspapers, encyclopedias, and a significant proportion of the population of the capital Oslo, surrounding areas, and other urban areas, as well as much of the literary tradition. Since the reforms of 1981 and 2003 (effective in 2005), the official Bokmål can be adapted to be almost identical with modern Riksmål. The differences between written Riksmål and Bokmål are comparable to [[American and British English differences]].

Riksmål is regulated by the [[Norwegian Academy]], which determines acceptable spelling, grammar, and vocabulary.

===Høgnorsk===
{{Main|Høgnorsk}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
There is also an unofficial form of Nynorsk, called ''Høgnorsk'', discarding the post-1917 reforms, and thus close to Ivar Aasen's original Landsmål. It is supported by [[Ivar Aasen-sambandet]], but has found no widespread use.

===Current usage===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
In 2010 86.5% of the pupils in the primary and lower secondary schools in Norway receive education in Bokmål, while 13.0% receive education in Nynorsk. From the eighth grade onwards pupils are required to learn both. Out of the 431 municipalities in Norway, 161 have declared that they wish to communicate with the central authorities in Bokmål, 116 (representing 12% of the population) in Nynorsk, while 156 are neutral. Of 4,549 state publications in 2000 8% were in Nynorsk, and 92% in Bokmål. The large national newspapers ([[Aftenposten]], [[Dagbladet]], and [[Verdens Gang|VG]]) are published in Bokmål or Riksmål. Some major regional newspapers (including ''[[Bergens Tidende]]'' and ''[[Stavanger Aftenblad]]''), many political journals, and many local newspapers use both Bokmål and Nynorsk.

A newer trend is to write in dialect for informal use. When writing an SMS, Facebook update, or fridge note, most younger people write the way they talk rather than using Bokmål or Nynorsk.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Dialects==
{{Main|Norwegian dialects}}
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
There is general agreement that a wide range of differences makes it difficult to estimate the number of different Norwegian dialects. Variations in grammar, syntax, vocabulary, and pronunciation cut across geographical boundaries and can create a distinct dialect at the level of farm clusters. Dialects are in some cases so dissimilar as to be unintelligible to unfamiliar listeners. Many linguists note a trend toward regionalization of dialects that diminishes the differences at such local levels; there is, however, a renewed interest in preserving distinct dialects.

==Examples==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
Below are a few sentences giving an indication of the differences between Bokmål and Nynorsk, compared to the conservative (closer to Danish) form Riksmål, Danish, as well as Old Norse, Swedish, Faroese, Icelandic (the living language grammatically closest to Old Norse), Old English and some modern West Germanic languages:

===Nouns===
{{See also|Nynorsk#Nouns}}
Norwegian [[noun]]s are [[inflection|inflected]] for [[grammatical number|number]] (singular/plural) and [[declension|declined]] for [[definiteness]] (indefinite/definite) and [[Grammatical case|case]] ([[nominative case|nominative]]/[[Genitive case|genitive]]). In some dialects, definite nouns are also in the [[dative case|dative]].

Norwegian nouns belong to three [[noun class]]es: masculine, feminine and neuter. [[Adjective]]s and [[Determiner (class)|determiner]]s agree in gender with the noun they modifiy. Riksmål and conservative Bokmål traditionally have two genders like Danish, but Nynorsk and most speakers of Norwegian regional dialects use three genders to different extents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Skjekkeland|first=Martin|title=dialekter i Bergen|date=2016-09-16|url=http://snl.no/dialekter_i_Bergen|work=Store norske leksikon|language=no|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inflection of feminine words like ''jente'' using morphemes from the masculine noun class is common in the Bergen and Oslo areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hanssen|first=Eskil|title=dialekter og språk i Oslo|date=2016-09-13|url=http://snl.no/dialekter_og_spr%C3%A5k_i_Oslo|work=Store norske leksikon|language=no|access-date=2018-07-14|last2=Kjærheim|first2=Harald|last3=Skjekkeland|first3=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, feminine noun class morphology tends to be restricted in most Eastern and Northern dialects to the uses of the definite article{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

In general, almost all nouns in Bokmål follow these patterns&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ressurssidene.no/web/PageND.aspx?id=99149|title=Bøying|website=www.ressurssidene.no|language=nb-NO|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (like the words in the examples above):

Unlike in Bokmål, in Nynorsk feminine nouns cannot be inflected using masculine noun class morphology. Feminine nouns must be written using the prescribed inflection patterns.

There is no way in general to infer what gender a specific noun has, but there some patterns of nouns where the gender can be inferred. For instance, all nouns ending in -''nad'' will be masculine in both Bokmål and Nynorsk (for instance the noun ''jobbsøknad'', which means job application). Most nouns ending in -''ing'' will be feminine, like the noun ''forventning'' (expectation).

There are some common irregular nouns, many of which are irregular in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, like the following:
{| class="wikitable"
|+Irregular noun, fot (foot)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ordbok.uib.no/perl/ordbok.cgi?OPP=fot&amp;ant_bokmaal=5&amp;ant_nynorsk=5&amp;begge=+&amp;ordbok=begge|title=Bokmålsordboka {{!}} Nynorskordboka|website=ordbok.uib.no|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nynorsk, even though the irregular word ''fot'' is masculine, it is inflected like a feminine word in the plural. Another word with the same irregular inflection is ''son - søner'' (son - sons).

In Nynorsk, nouns ending in -''ing'' typically have masculine plural inflections, like the word ''dronning'' in the following table. But they are treated as feminine nouns in every other way.&lt;ref name="Språkrådet"/&gt;

==== Genitive of nouns ====
In general, the [[genitive case]] has died out in modern Norwegian and there are only some remnants of it in certain expressions: ''til fjells'' (to the mountains), ''til sjøs'' (to the sea). To show ownership, there is an enclitic -''s'' similar to English -{{'}}''s''; ''Sondres flotte bil'' (Sondre's nice car, Sondre being a personal name). There are also reflexive possessive pronouns, ''sin'', ''si'', ''sitt'', ''sine''; ''Det er Sondre sitt'' (It is Sondre's). In both Bokmål and modern Nynorsk, there is often a mix of both of these to mark possession, though it is more common in Nynorsk to use the reflexive pronouns; in Nynorsk use of the reflexive possessive pronouns is generally encouraged to avoid mixing the enclitic -''s'' with the historical grammatical case remnants of the language. The reflexive pronouns agree in gender and number with the noun.

The enclitic -''s'' in Norwegian evolved as a shorthand expression for the possessive pronouns ''sin'', ''si'', ''sitt'' and ''sine''.

===Adjectives===
{{See also|Nynorsk#Adjectives}}
Norwegian [[adjective]]s inflect for gender, number, definiteness and for [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] (positive/comparative/superlative). Most adjectives in all Norwegian dialects and written forms follow the pattern below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elevrom.sprakradet.no/skolen/minigrammatikk/tema/samsvarsboying_adjektiv|title=Språkrådet|website=elevrom.sprakradet.no|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|+
Adjective agreement inflection
|-
!masculine/feminine
!neuter
!plural/definite
|-

|  -t
|  -e
|}
In most dialects, some verb participles used as adjectives have a separate form in both definite and plural uses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4033534|title=Norwegian grammar|last=1906-1970.|first=Berulfsen, Bjarne,|date=1977|publisher=Aschehoug|isbn=8203043127|edition=4. impression|location=Oslo|oclc=4033534}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes also in the masculine-feminine singular:

*''en stjålet/stjålen bil -'' "a stolen car"
*''den stjålne bilen'' -  "that stolen car"
*''stjålne biler er et stort problem''  -"stolen cars are a big issue"

In some Southwestern dialects, the definite adjective is also declined in gender and number with one form for feminine and plural, and one form for masculine and neuter.

In Norwegian, a definite noun has a suffixed article (cf. above). However, when a definitive noun is preceded by an adjective (or a numeral), an additional definite article is placed in front of the adjective in the beginning of the [[noun phrase]], so that definiteness is marked twice &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntnu.edu/now2/4/grammatikk/1|title=1 Repetisjon|last=Fossen|first=Christian|website=www.ntnu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the adjective is inflected as definite as well. In Bokmål, though, the suffixed noun article may be dropped in formal or literary styles.

Definiteness is also signaled by using possessive pronouns or any uses of a noun in its genitive form in either Nynorsk or Bokmål: ''mitt grønne hus'' ("my green house"), ''min grønne bil'' ("my green car"), ''mitt tilbaketrukne tannkjøtt'' ("my pulled gums"), ''presidentens gamle hus'' ("the president's old house").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elevrom.sprakradet.no/skolen/minigrammatikk/tema/samsvarsboying_adjektiv|title=Språkrådet|website=elevrom.sprakradet.no|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of comparative and superlative inflections in Bokmål: "et hvitere hus" (a whiter house), "den grønneste bilen" (the greenest car); "hvitere hus" (whiter house), "grønnest bil" (greenest car).

==== [[Adjective#Predicative adjective|Predicative agreement]] ====
In all dialects of Norwegian and in the written languages, unlike related languages like German, there is also predicative agreement of adjectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ressurssidene.pedit.no/web/PageND.aspx?id=99235|title=Predikativ|website=ressurssidene.pedit.no|language=nb-NO|access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This means that nouns will have to agree with the adjective when there is a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula verb]] involved, like in Bokmål: «være» (to be), «bli» (become), «ser ut» (looks like), «kjennes» (feels like) etc.

===Verbs===
{{See also|Nynorsk#Verb_conjugation}}
Norwegian [[finite verb|finite]] [[verb]]s are inflected or [[grammatical conjugation|conjugated]] according to [[grammatical mood|mood]]: indicative/imperative/subjunctive. The [[subjunctive mood]] is constrained to only a handful of verbs. Indicative verbs are conjugated for [[grammatical tense|tense]]: [[present tense|present]] / [[past tense|past]] / future. The infinitive, present and past tense also have a [[passive voice|passive]] form. In a few dialects, indicative verbs are also conjugated according to [[grammatical number|number]]. Agreement with [[grammatical person|person]] is lost in Norwegian.

There are four [[non-finite verb]] forms: [[infinitive]], [[passive voice|passive]] infinitive, and the two [[participle]]s [[perfective]]/past participle and [[imperfective]]/present participle.

The participles are [[verbal adjective]]s. The imperfective participle is not declined, whereas the perfect participle is declined for [[grammatical gender|gender]] (though not in Bokmål) and [[grammatical number|number]] like strong, positive adjectives. The [[definiteness|definite]] form of the participle is identical to the plural form.

As with other Germanic languages, Norwegian verbs can be either [[germanic weak verb|weak]] or [[germanic strong verb|strong]].

==== Ergative verbs ====
{{See also|Nynorsk#Ergative_verbs}}
There are [[ergative verb]]s in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, where there is two different conjugation patterns depending on if the verb takes an object or not. In Bokmål, there are only two different conjugations for the [[Preterite Tense|preterite tense]] for the strong verbs, while Nynorsk has different conjugations for all tenses, like Swedish and a majority of Norwegian dialects. Some weak verbs are also ergative and are differentiated for all tenses in both Bokmål and Nynorsk, like «ligge»/«legge» that both means to lie down, but «ligge» does not take an object while «legge» requires an object. «legge» corresponds to the English verb «lay», while «ligge» corresponds to the English verb «lie». There are however many verbs that do not have this direct translation to English verbs.

|Jeg '''ligger'''

|-

|}

===Pronouns===
{{See also|Nynorsk#Personal_pronouns}}
Norwegian personal [[pronoun]]s are declined according to [[grammatical case|case]]: [[nominative case|nominative]] / [[accusative case|accusative]]. Like English, pronouns in Bokmål and Nynorsk are the only class that has case declension. Some of the dialects that have preserved the [[dative case|dative]] in nouns, also have a dative case instead of the accusative case in personal pronouns, while others have accusative in pronouns and dative in nouns, effectively giving these dialects three distinct cases.

In the most comprehensive Norwegian grammar, [[Norsk referansegrammatikk]], the categorization of personal pronouns by [[grammatical person|person]], [[grammatical gender|gender]], and [[grammatical number|number]] is not regarded as inflection. Pronouns are a [[closed class]].

The words for «mine», «yours» etc. are dependent on the gender of the noun it describes. Just like adjectives, they have to agree in gender with the noun.

Bokmål has two sets of 3rd person pronouns. ''Han'' and ''hun'' refer to male and female individuals respectively, ''den'' and ''det'' refer to impersonal or inanimate nouns, of masculine/feminine or neutral gender respectively. In contrast, Nynorsk and most dialects use the same set of pronouns ''han'' (he), ''ho'' (she) and ''det'' (it) for both personal and impersonal references, just like in [[German language|German]]. ''Det'' also has [[Syntactic expletive|expletive]] and [[cataphora|cataphoric]] uses like in the English examples '''''it''' rains'' and '''''it''' was known by everyone '''(that) he had travelled the world'''''.

==== Ordering of possessive pronouns ====
Unlike Swedish and Danish, the ordering of possessive pronouns are a bit more free. When there is no adjective, the most common word order is the one used in the examples in the table above, where the possessive comes after the noun, while the noun is in its definite form; «boka mi» (my book). If one wishes to emphasize the owner of the noun, the possessive pronoun usually come first. In Bokmål however, due to its Danish origins, one could choose to always write the possessive first «min bil» (my car), but this may sound very formal. Some dialects that have been very influenced by Danish do this too, some speakers in [[Bærum]] and the [[Oslo West|west of Oslo]] may always use this word order. When there is an adjective describing the noun, the possessive pronoun will always come first; «min egen bil» (my own car).

!English
|-
|Det er ''mi'' bok!
|It is ''my'' book! (owner emphasized)
|-
|Kona mi er vakker
|My wife is beautiful
|- din, di, ditt (yours)
|}

===Determiners===
{{See also|Nynorsk#Determiners}}
The [[closed class]] of Norwegian [[Determiner (class)|determiner]]s are declined in [[grammatical gender|gender]] and [[grammatical number|number]] in agreement with their argument. Not all determiners are inflected.

===Particle classes===
Norwegian has five [[closed class]]es without inflection, i.e. [[lexical category|lexical categories]] with grammatical function and a finite number of members that may not be distinguished by morphological criteria. These are [[interjection]]s, [[grammatical conjunction|conjunctions]], [[grammatical conjunction|subjunctions]], [[preposition]]s, and [[adverbs]]. The inclusion of adverbs here requires that traditional adverbs that are inflected in [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] be classified as adjectives, as is sometimes done.

===Compound words===
In Norwegian [[compound (linguistics)|compound words]], the [[head (linguistics)|head]], i.e. the part determining the compound's class, is the last part. If the compound word is constructed from many different nouns, the last noun in the compound noun will determine the gender of the compound noun. Only the first part has primary stress. For instance, the compound ''tenketank'' (think tank) has primary stress on the first syllable and is a masculine noun since the noun «tank» is masculine.

Compound words are written together in Norwegian, which can cause words to become very long, for example ''{{lang|no|sannsynlighetsmaksimeringsestimator}}'' ([[maximum likelihood]] [[estimator]]) and ''{{lang|no|menneskerettighetsorganisasjoner}}'' (human rights organizations). Other examples are the title ''høyesterettsjustitiarius'' (Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, originally a combination of [[supreme court]] and the actual title, [[justiciar]]) and the translation ''En midtsommernattsdrøm'' for ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''.

If they are not written together, each part is naturally read with primary stress, and the meaning of the compound is lost. Examples of this in English are the difference between a green house and a greenhouse or a black board and a blackboard.

This is sometimes forgotten, occasionally with humorous results. Instead of writing, for example, ''{{lang|no|lammekoteletter}}'' (lamb chops), people make the mistake of writing ''{{lang|no|lamme koteletter}}'' (lame, or paralyzed, chops). The original message can even be reversed, as when ''{{lang|no|røykfritt}}'' (lit. "smoke-free" meaning no smoking) becomes ''{{lang|no|røyk fritt}}'' (smoke freely).

Other examples include:
* ''Terrasse dør'' ("Terrace dies") instead of ''Terrassedør'' ("Terrace door")
* ''Tunfisk biter'' ("Tuna bites", verb) instead of ''Tunfiskbiter'' ("Tuna bits", noun)
* ''Smult ringer'' ("Lard calls", verb) instead of ''Smultringer'' ("Doughnuts")
* ''Tyveri sikret'' ("Theft guaranteed") instead of ''Tyverisikret'' ("Theft proof")
* ''Stekt kylling lever'' ("Fried chicken lives", verb) instead of ''Stekt kyllinglever'' ("Fried chicken liver", noun)
* ''Smør brød'' ("Butter bread", verb) instead of ''Smørbrød'' ("Sandwich")
* ''Klipp fisk'' ("Cut fish", verb) instead of ''Klippfisk'' ("Clipfish")
* ''På hytte taket'' ("On cottage the roof") instead of ''På hyttetaket'' ("On the cottage roof")
* ''Altfor Norge'' ("Too Norway") instead of ''Alt for Norge'' ("Everything for Norway", the royal motto of Norway)
These misunderstandings occur because most nouns can be interpreted as verbs or other types of words.
Similar misunderstandings can be achieved in English too. The following are examples of phrases that both in Norwegian and English mean one thing as a compound word, and something different when regarded as separate words:
* ''stavekontroll'' (spellchecker) or ''stave kontroll'' (spell checker)
* ''kokebok'' (cookbook) or ''koke bok'' (cook book)
* ''ekte håndlagde vafler'' (real handmade waffles) or ''ekte hånd lagde vafler'' (real hand made waffles)

=== Syntax ===
Norwegian syntax is predominantly [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] with the subject of the sentence coming first, then the verb coming second and finally the object. However, like many other Germanic languages such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], it has a [[V2 word order|V2 rule]], which means that the finite verb will be placed as the second element within a sentence. No matter what, the finite/conjugated verb will always be the second element of a sentence. E.g.:

•"&lt;u&gt;Jeg&lt;/u&gt; '''spiser''' fisk ''i dag''" (&lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt; '''eat''' fish ''today'')

•"''I dag'' '''spiser''' &lt;u&gt;jeg&lt;/u&gt; fisk" (''Today'', &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt; '''eat''' fish)

•"&lt;u&gt;Jeg&lt;/u&gt; '''vil''' drikke kaffe ''i dag''" (&lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt; '''want''' to drink coffee ''today'')

•"''I dag'' '''vil''' &lt;u&gt;jeg&lt;/u&gt; drikke kaffe" (''Today'', &lt;u&gt;I&lt;/u&gt; '''want''' to drink coffee)

Any piece of the sentence could be placed first to highlight its importance, but the finite verb must &lt;u&gt;''always''&lt;/u&gt; follow its subject.

Adjectives always precede the noun that they modify.

==Vocabulary==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
[[File:Ambulanse Oslo Akershus 18jun2005.jpg|thumb|Norwegian ambulances changed their markings in 2005. This is the old appearance, with the Norwegian ''{{lang|no|ambulanse}}'', "Ambulance."]]
By far the largest part of the modern vocabulary of Norwegian dates back to Old Norse. The largest source of loanwords is [[Middle Low German]], which had a huge influence on Norwegian vocabulary from the late Middle Ages onwards partially even influencing grammatical structures, such as genitive constructions. Bokmål and many dialects have these loanwords, while Nynorsk is more puristic and has many of these words replaced with words that are derived from Old Norse, Nynorsk thus shares more vocabulary with Icelandic and Faroese. There are Middle Low German vocabulary in Nynorsk too, but to a lesser extent than Bokmål. At present, the main source of new loanwords is English e.g. ''rapper'', ''e-mail'', ''catering'', ''juice'', ''bag'' (originally a loan word to English from Old Norse).

Some loanwords have their spelling changed to reflect Norwegian pronunciation rules, but in general Norwegianised spellings of these words tend to take a long time to sink in: e.g. ''{{lang|no|sjåfør}}'' (from [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|chauffeur}}'') and ''{{lang|no|revansj}}'' (from French ''{{lang|fr|revanche}}'') are now the common Norwegian spellings, but ''juice'' is more often used than the Norwegianised form ''{{lang|no|jus}}'', ''catering'' more often than ''{{lang|no|keitering}}'', ''service'' more often than ''{{lang|no|sørvis}}'', etc.

Norwegian has also and continues to borrow words and phrases from both Danish and Swedish to a relatively large extent. And though there are very often related, similar- or identical-sounding words in those languages, the spelling in Norwegian is often less conservative and, arguably, closer to the pronunciation, and thus different from the others, and four of the letters most shunned in Norwegian in comparison to the other Scandinavian languages are "c", "d", "j" and "x". Norwegian ''{{lang|no|hei}}'' is ''{{lang|sv|hej}}'' in Swedish and Danish; the words "sex" and "six" are ''{{lang|no|sex}}'' and ''{{lang|no|seks}}'' in Norwegian, but in Swedish they are both ''{{lang|sv|sex}}''; Danish words ending in ''{{lang|da|-tion}}'' end in ''{{lang|no|-sjon}}'' to reflect pronunciation and many traditional Danish spellings with ''d'' preceded by another consonant are changed to double consonants, such as in the Danish for water, ''{{lang|da|vand}}'', versus Norwegian (Bokmål) spelling ''{{lang|nb|vann}}'', but "sand" is spelled ''{{lang|no|sand}}'' in both languages (Norwegian was standardized this way because in some dialects a "d" was pronounced in ''{{lang|no|sand}}'', whereas Norwegian speakers pronounced ''{{lang|no|vann}}'' without a "d"-sound). (The word for water in Nynorsk is ''{{lang|nn|vatn}}''.)

[[File:NWFusionPaquitaPas2.jpg|thumb|right|Dancers performing ''[[Paquita]]'' grand pas de deux entrée]]

In [[ballet]], a '''pas de deux''' {{IPA-fr|pɑ d(ə) dø|}} ([[French language|French]], literally "step of two") is a dance [[duet]] in which two dancers, typically a male and a female, perform ballet steps together.&lt;ref name="Bedinghaus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greskovic" /&gt; The pas de deux is characteristic of classical ballet and can be found in many well-known ballets, including ''[[Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', ''[[Swan Lake]]'', and ''[[Giselle]]''.&lt;ref name="Bedinghaus" /&gt; It is most often performed by a male and a female (a ''danseur'' and a ''ballerina'') though there are exceptions, such as in the film ''[[White Nights (1985 film)|White Nights]]'', in which a pas de deux is performed by [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] and [[Gregory Hines]].&lt;ref name="Bedinghaus" /&gt;

==Grand pas de deux==

A '''grand pas de deux''' is a structured pas de deux that typically has five parts, consisting of an ''entrée'' (introduction), an ''adagio'', two variations (a solo for each dancer), and a ''coda'' (conclusion).&lt;ref name="Bedinghaus" /&gt; It is effectively a suite of dances that share a common theme, often symbolic of a love story or the partnership inherent in love, with the dancers portraying expressions of affectionate feelings and thoughts between romantic partners.&lt;ref name="Bedinghaus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Greskovic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; It is often considered to be the [[pièce de résistance]] and bravura highlight of a ballet and is usually performed by a leading pair of [[principal dancer]]s.&lt;ref name="Greskovic" /&gt;

===Entrée===
A grand pas de deux usually begins with an entrée (literally "entrance"), which serves as a short prelude to and also unequivocally denotes the beginning of the dance suite. During the entrée, the dancers first appear on the [[stage (theatre)|stage]] and, typically with great pageantry, acknowledge each other and position themselves near each other in preparation for the subsequent adagio. Depending on the [[choreography (dance)|choreography]], the ballerina and danseur may enter the stage simultaneously or at different times.

===Adagio===
The  ''adagio'' or ''adage'' (meaning "slowly") part of a grand pas de deux features graceful and elaborate [[dance partnering|partnering]] by the dancing pair. In the adagio, the ballerina performs elegant, often slow and sustained movements while the danseur supports her. The danseur, in turn, strives to maintain a display of poise and seemingly effortless strength while providing support for the ballerina. The danseur may support the ballerina in a variety of common ways, including lifting her, holding and steadying her during [[dance turns|turns]], and offering a steady arm or hand for her to use as a "virtual [[barre (ballet)|barre]]" when she performs balancing feats that would be difficult or impossible without assistance.&lt;ref name="Bedinghaus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kersley" /&gt; Because of this support the adagio is sometimes called ''supported adagio''.

File:Pirouette .gif|[[Pirouette]]s
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Variations===
Upon completion of the adagio, the dancers separate and each dancer, in turn, takes center stage and performs a ''variation'' (a [[solo dance]]).&lt;ref name="Greskovic" /&gt; In general, the variations are intended to showcase spectacular, [[acrobatics|acrobatic]] leaps and turns, as well as the skills and athleticism of the individual dancers. The danseur's variation is usually performed first, followed by the ballerina's variation.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Coda===
The ''coda'' (literally "tail") is the concluding segment of a grand pas de deux. Typically, it is a recapitulation of earlier segments of the grand pas de deux, consisting of elements that are characteristic of the adagio, variations, or both, and ends during a grand musical climax.&lt;ref name="Greskovic" /&gt;

==History==

Elements of the grand pas de deux first appeared in the early 18th century as opening acts of operas and ballets in which a couple would perform identical dance steps, sometimes while holding hands. At that time and throughout the [[Baroque]] period, ballet partner dancing was evolving to show more dramatic content. For example, in ''[[The Loves of Mars and Venus]]'' ballet of 1717, Mars (the male dancer) strove to portray gallantry, respect, ardent love and adoration, while Venus showed bashfulness, reciprocal love, and wishful looks.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;

In the late 18th and early 19th centuries a romantic pas de deux emerged that involved closer physical contact, with ballerinas dancing on their toes in the hands of their partners. As the 19th century progressed, the form became a showcase for the skills of the increasingly sophisticated ballerina.

The ballets of the late 19th Century&amp;mdash;particularly of those of [[Marius Petipa]]&amp;mdash;introduced the concept of the grand pas de deux, which often served as the climax of a scene or an entire performance. This involved a consistent format of entrée and adagio by a pair of leading male and female dancers, followed by virtuosic solos (first by the male and then the female) and a finale.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; During the 20th century, the grand pas de deux became more integrated with the story of the ballet, with increasingly acrobatic content.&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;

==Early life==
{{confusing|date=February 2014}}
Califia was born in [[Corpus Christi, Texas]] in 1954 and grew up in Utah in a [[Mormon]] family.&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt; His father was a construction worker and his mother was a housewife. Califia was the oldest of six children.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite book | last = Prono | first = Luca | title = Encyclopedia of gay and lesbian popular culture | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Connecticut | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780313335990 }} [https://books.google.com/?id=Y3FYzMPH2OwC&amp;pg=PA49 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Decter | first = Ann | title = Click: Becoming Feminist | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160301150608/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-625243371.html | archive-date = March 1, 2016 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-625243371.html | date = July 1, 1998 | work = [[Herizons]] | location = Manitoba, Canada | accessdate = May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Califia has said he did not have a good childhood, claimed that his father was an angry and violent man and his mother a pious woman.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"&gt;{{cite web | title = Patrick Califia | url = http://www.glbtq.com/literature/califia_p.html | website = glbtq.com | publisher = Encyclopedia of GLBTQ Culture | accessdate = November 14, 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141008112738/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/califia_p.html | archivedate = October 8, 2014 }} [http://www.glbtqarchive.com/literature/califia_p_L.pdf Pdf version.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Califia believed in the Mormon religion, and there were elements of [[Mormonism]] in his approach to life.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; One primary tenet of Mormonism Califia tended to follow was, "if the truth has been revealed to you and you don't speak out, you are culpable for any wrongs that are committed in those realms of life."&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; Califia's sense of difference began when he was a child. He had dreams of becoming a [[train engineer]] which his parents shot down because he was born female.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; He started [[trans man|transitioning]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt;

In the 1970s, Califia's parents had him admitted to a [[psychiatric hospital]], and he dropped out of college (the [[University of Utah]] in [[Salt Lake City]]) due to his mental state. Califia came out as lesbian in 1971 while attending college.&lt;ref name="Patrick Califia" /&gt; He began using the last name ''[[Califia]],''{{citation needed |date=May 2015}} after the mythical female warrior [[Amazons|Amazon]].&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Patrick Califia"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Califia2010"&gt;{{citation | last = Califia | first = Patrick | contribution = Introduction | editor-last = Califia | editor-first = Patrick | title = Macho sluts | page = 35 | publisher = Arsenal Pulp Press | location = Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781551523521 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=gjgsAQAAIAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Introduction Details.]&lt;/ref&gt; Califia began to evade his parents, and became involved in the [[women's liberation]] and [[anti-war movement]]s.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; After getting involved in [[consciousness raising]] in the area, he moved to San Francisco in 1973, bringing an interest in [[sex education]] to work on the [[San Francisco Sex Information]] switchboard.&lt;ref name="Sides2009"&gt;{{citation | last = Sides | first = Josh | contribution = When the streets went gay | editor-last = Sides | editor-first = Josh | title = Erotic city: sexual revolutions and the making of modern San Francisco | page = 119 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York Oxford | year = 2012 | isbn = 9780199874064 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=WYJezSP8fMoC&amp;pg=PA119 Details.]&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to San Francisco he began writing for a magazine and joined a lesbian [[separatist]] movement. In 1975 he spoke in favor of [[sadomasochism]] and found himself excluded from the [[lesbian feminist]] community.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; He was not only excluded from his nuclear family by coming out as a lesbian but also lost his gay family when speaking his opinions.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; Califia became increasingly involved in [[Sadomasochism|S/M]] activities not only with lesbians but also with gay men. He co-founded the first lesbian S/M group, [[Samois]], in 1978.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt;

==Education==
Califia began attending the [[University of Utah]] in [[Salt Lake City]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="books.google" /&gt; In 1981, he graduated from [[San Francisco State University]] (SFSU) with a [[bachelor of arts]] degree in psychology.&lt;ref name="nndb.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/patrick.califia |title=Patrick Califia |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=October 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also said he has a master's degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Califia | first = Patrick | title = Sex changes: the politics of transgenderism | publisher = Cleis Press | location = San Francisco, California | year = 1997 | isbn = 9781573440721 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=V_mHAAAAIAAJ Details.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Califia published his first book—''Sapphistry: The Book of Lesbian Sexuality'', a non-fiction work for lesbians which described, in a non-judgmental tone, [[Butch and Femme|butch-femme]] sexuality, and [[BDSM]] safety and practice.&lt;ref name="Sapphistry"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Califia | first1 = Patrick | last2 = Corinne | first2 = Tee | author-link2 = Tee Corinne | title = Sapphistry: the book of lesbian sexuality | publisher = Naiad Press | location = Tallahassee, Florida | year = 1983 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780930044473 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=AuxRAQAAIAAJ Details.]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he published work in lesbian, gay and [[feminism|feminist]] magazines, including a long-running sex advice column in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Fitting | first = Peter | title = Violence and utopia: John Norman and Pat Califia | journal = [[Utopian Studies]] | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 91–108 | publisher = [[Penn State University Press]] | date = 2000 | jstor = 25702459 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Califia is "one of earliest champions of lesbian sadomasochistic sex" whose "work has been taught on college campuses across the country and abroad."&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt; He has a long history of [[Relational transgression|transgression]], identifying as a [[feminist]], lesbian, and [[transgender]] while also at times finding rejection from those communities "for various infractions."&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt; He played what some observers termed a "notable role" in the [[Feminist Sex Wars]] of the 1970s/1980s.&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt; The sides were characterized by [[Feminist views on pornography#anti-pornography feminism|anti-porn feminist]] and [[Sex-positive feminism|sex-positive feminist]] groups with disagreements regarding [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], pornography and other forms of sexual representation, prostitution, the role of [[trans woman|trans women]] in the lesbian community, [[lesbian sexual practices]], [[sadomasochism]], and other sexual issues. Califia rejected the "essentialist, feminist ideology – that women are better, more nurturing, more peaceful, more loving, more relationship-oriented and less raunchy in bed," instead advocating for [[BDSM]], "the consensual integration of power, pain, domination and submission into sex."&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt; According to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', many feminists were won over to Califia's views on S/M not from his arguments, but from his erotic fiction: "they read Califia-Rice's S/M fantasies, got turned on and got over it."&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt;

In 1979, as a student in [[psychology]] at [[San Francisco State University]], his research was published in the ''[[Journal of Homosexuality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Califia | first = Pat | title = Lesbian sexuality | journal = [[Journal of Homosexuality]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 255–266 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1300/J082v04n03_04 | pmid = 264129 | date = 1979 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1300/J082v04n03_04 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Califia co-founded [[Samois]], a lesbian-feminist BDSM organization based in San Francisco that existed from 1978 to 1983, and shifted his focus to the lesbian experience of [[BDSM]].&lt;ref name="Bronstein2011"&gt;{{citation | last = Bronstein | first = Carolyn | contribution = Anti-pornography comes undone: the rise of the feminist pro-sex countermovement | editor-last = Bronstein | editor-first = Carolyn | title = Battling pornography: the American feminist anti-pornography movement, 1976-1986 | page = 288 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781107400399 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/?id=EYheMTwz2qIC Details.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Samois Collective produced, with Califia's contributions, the book, ''[[Coming to Power]]'', published by [[Alyson Publications]].&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart1998"&gt;{{citation | last = Hart | first = Lynda | contribution = Notes: Notes to chapter 5 - Bearing (to) Witness | editor-last = Hart | editor-first = Lynda | title = Between the body and the flesh: performing sadomasochism | page = 237 | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780231084031 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7RFB0NB4fscC Details.]
:''Quote:''
::It is interesting to note that after I had written this chapter, Califia and Sweeney's sequel to ''Coming to Power'' was published, entitled ''The Second Coming''. This title's reference to the earlier volume is obvious. But it also strikes me that the theological connotation it carries of a "resurrection" is a concept that is deeply inscribed in s/m practice. Such a "redemptive" grammar, which is pervasive in the literature, could be perceived as pastoralizing in tone, and indeed must be in part. But it also campy and ironic, parodic in one sense and, like all parody carrying with it a certain ambivalent reverence for the model that it both mocks and imitates.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Coming To Power'', according to editor in chief Heather Findlay of lesbian magazine ''[[Girlfriends (U.S. TV series)|Girlfriends]]'', was "one of the most transformative lesbian books, [foretelling] the end of a certain puritanism that had dominated the community. It was the first articulate defense of lesbian S/M, and that was the end of it."&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt; Another book, the ''Lesbian S/M Safety Manual'', won the 1990 [[Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Burkardt | first = John | title = The Oddest Book Titles | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160810000940/http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/fun/wordplay/title_oddest.html | archive-date = August 10, 2016 | url = http://people.scs.fsu.edu/~burkardt/fun/wordplay/title_oddest.html | website = people.scs.fsu.edu  |publisher= The Department of Scientific Computing, [[Florida State University]] |date=June 1, 2007|accessdate= February 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Califia founded the leatherwomen's quarterly ''Venus Infers'', and published "Feminism, Paedophilia, and Children's Rights" in Vol. 2, No. 4, a special women's issue, of the pro-pedophile scholarly journal ''Paidika''. In 1996 he was co-editor, with Robin Sweeney, of ''The Second Coming: A Leatherdyke Reader'', a sequel to ''Coming to Power''.&lt;ref name=Hart1998/&gt; Califia was writing about [[queer studies]] and [[gender identity]], and coming to terms with these issues on a personal level. At age 45, Califia [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioned]], taking the name Patrick.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Califia | first = Patrick | contribution = Manliness | editor-last1 = Stryker | editor-first1 = Susan | editor-last2 = Whittle | editor-first2 = Stephen | editor-link1 = Susan Stryker | editor-link2 = Stephen Whittle | title = The transgender studies reader | pages = 434–438 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780415947091 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2000 interview, Califia explained that the inspiration for his erotic writings varies; sometimes it is just about having fun, or it can be satire, or exploring a sexuality issue like HIV-positive people [[barebacking]] with the intention of infecting the other person with the virus.&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt; In the interview with Rona Marech, Califia is quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's about me trying to put a human face on that and understand that from the inside out. ...It's about being thought-provoking, hopefully. And I like (presenting issues) that challenge the reader; that are maybe a little scary, maybe hard to think about. ...It's also a way to top a lot of people. In some ways, I get to do a scene with everyone who reads one [sic] my books.&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Janet Hardy, of [[Greenery Press]], admires Califia's tenacity, stating, "He's got a phenomenal mind. ...He's willing to get a hold of a thought and follow it through to the end, even if it doesn't feel comfortable."&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt;

Califia was nominated for the [[Lambda Literary Awards]] for his short-story collection, ''[[Macho Sluts]]'' (1988), his novel, ''Doc and Fluff: The Dystopian Tale of a Girl and Her Biker'' (1990), and a compilation of his columns, ''The Advocate Adviser'' (1991).&lt;ref name="glbtq.com" /&gt;  He is working on a book that discusses the topic of FTM sexuality,{{When|date=May 2015}} and is working on a new set of essays surrounding the topic of BDSM.{{When|date=February 2016}} He has also written vampire books.&lt;ref name="vampire"&gt;{{cite book | last = Califia | first = Patrick | title = Mortal companion | publisher = Suspect Thoughts Press | location = San Francisco | year = 2004 | isbn = 9780739448236 }} [https://www.amazon.com/Mortal-Companion-Patrick-Califia/dp/0739448234/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1455797319&amp;sr=8-9&amp;keywords=patrick+califia Details.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Califia presented a paper for the [[American Academy of Religion]] conference in Montréal, November 19–22, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kraemer | first = Christine | title = Eros and touch from a pagan perspective: divided for love's sake | publisher = Routledge | location = New York, New York | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780415820189 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on the gay marriage debate, and how arguments about [[monogamy]] and S/M have been used to try and control the argument.

When Califia would travel to Canada, his pornographic works were often seized by Canadian customs, until he fought a court case to allow them to be accepted.&lt;ref name="prog"&gt;{{cite news | last = Cusac | first = Anne-Marie  |title=Profile of a sex radical | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150329060002/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18710719.html | archive-date = March 29, 2015 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18710719.html |work= [[The Progressive]] | date = October 1, 1996 | accessdate = May 10, 2012}} {{subscription required|date=February 2016|text=partial text|s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he wrote of his amusement at finding that anti-porn feminist [[Catherine Itzin]]'s book, ''Pornography: Women, Violence and Civil Liberties'', was seized under the very law she had helped to establish, while Califia's books were recognized as acceptable by that law. Califia fought against anti-pornography legislation co-authored by [[Catharine MacKinnon]].&lt;ref name="SFGate" /&gt;

In 2013, he was named by Equality Forum as one of their 31 Icons of the [[LGBT History Month]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2013 Icons Announced: LGBT History Month 2013 Now Online | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160310023401/http://equalityforum.com/lgbt-history-month-2013-icons-announced | archive-date = March 10, 2016 | url = http://www.equalityforum.com/lgbt-history-month-2013-icons-announced | website = equalityforum.com | publisher = Equality Forum | date = 2013 |access-date = 1 February 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 to 2011, Califia was licensed in California as a [[family therapy|marriage and family therapist]] (MFT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = License verification of Pat Califia| url = https://www.breeze.ca.gov/datamart/detailsCADCA.do?selector=false&amp;selectorType=&amp;selectorReturnUrl=&amp;anchor=e010b0d.0.0 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150526070508/https://www.breeze.ca.gov/datamart/detailsCADCA.do?selector=false&amp;selectorType=&amp;selectorReturnUrl=&amp;anchor=e010b0d.0.0 | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2015-05-26 | website = Breeze.ca.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Califia has a son, Blake Califia-Rice (born October 1999), to whom his ex-partner, Matt Rice (now a [[trans man]]), gave birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Alvear | first = Michael | title = Gender-bending | url = http://www.salon.com/2003/02/19/califia/ | date = February 19, 2003 | website = [[Salon (website)|Salon]] |accessdate=November 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Califia has said that since the 1990s, he has had [[fibromyalgia]].&lt;ref name="Sadie2003"&gt;{{cite book | last = Sensuous | first = Sadie | title = It's not about the whip: my explorations into love, sex and spirituality in the BDSM scene | page = 157 | publisher = Trafford | location = Victoria, British Columbia, Canada | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781412001830 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=XK2mLUdxzNcC&amp;pg=PT157 Details.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition===
In 1999, Califia decided to begin [[Hormone replacement therapy (female-to-male)|hormone replacement therapy]] as a part of his transition.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; Califia had considered [[Sex reassignment surgery|sex reassignment]] in his twenties, but had been hesitant, for one reason, because there were many dangers to the surgery at that time.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; He also hesitated because his career had been built around a reputation as a lesbian writer and activist. Califia had entered age-related [[menopause|perimenopause]] when he began his transition.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt; He has stated that being a man or a woman was never a good fit for him but sex reassignment seemed to be the most reasonable option.&lt;ref name="glbtq.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5829">'''Raciolinguistics''' examines how [[language]] is used to construct [[Race (human categorization)|race]] and how ideas of race influence language and language use.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qt4oDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=raciolinguistics#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Raciolinguistics: How Language Shapes Our Ideas About Race|last=Alim|first=H.

A central concern of raciolinguistics is to understand the complex meanings and implications of speech coming from a racialized subject.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The field also explores how the relationship between race and language impacts domains like [[politics]] and [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/2016/12/27/link-language-race-new-book/|title=Stanford experts highlight link between language and race in new book|last=University|first=Stanford|date=2016-12-27|website=Stanford News|access-date=2017-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sociolinguists and linguistic anthropologists have previously studied the intersections of language, race, and culture, raciolinguistics is a relatively new focus for scholars trying to theorize race throughout language studies. [[Nelson Flores]] and [[Jonathan Rosa]] first popularized the term in their 2015 discussion of "appropriateness" in American language and education.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flores|first=Nelson|last2=Rosa|first2=Jonathan|date=2015-06-10|title=Undoing Appropriateness: Raciolinguistic Ideologies and Language Diversity in Education|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.17763/0017-8055.85.2.149|journal=Harvard Educational Review|language=EN|volume=85|issue=2|pages=149–171|doi=10.17763/0017-8055.85.2.149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[H. Samy Alim]], [[John R. Rickford]] and [[Arnetha F. Ball]] published a book compiling raciolinguistic research.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In their work, raciolinguists incorporate [[intersectionality]] in theorizing how various identities (e.g. gender, ethnicity, nationality) within a group and/or an individual influence lived experiences of race.

== Race and language ==

=== Languaging race ===
''Languaging race'' focuses on how race can be constructed or deconstructed "through the lens of language"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through and by language, one can take on, discard, or impose affiliations made with a certain race; such as education level, economic status, etc.

''Languaging race'' also encompasses the theory of [[Transracial (identity)|transracialization]], made popular in the United States by the case of [[Rachel Dolezal]]. However, within raciolinguistics, the emphasis of transracialization is put on how individuals both resist racial categorization and use such categorization in order to achieve racial justice, as in the case of [[Black Lives Matter]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Racing language ===
''Racing language'' uses race theory to understand how sociolinguistic variation relates to social and political processes. This includes the development of [[African American Vernacular English|African American Language]] (AAL) in the United States, the generational linguistic shifts of Punjabi communities in London, and the significance of [[Pharyngealization|pharyngeal]] versus depharyngealized Hebrew in Israel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Association with a racial group may be related to the use of [[ethnolect]]s or [[Ethnolinguistics|ethnolinguistic]] repertoires,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benor|first=Sarah Bunin|date=2010-04-01|title=Ethnolinguistic repertoire: Shifting the analytic focus in language and ethnicity1|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9841.2010.00440.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Sociolinguistics|language=en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=159–183|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9841.2010.00440.x|issn=1467-9841}}&lt;/ref&gt; influencing the language used among a racial group and/or an individual seeking to identify with the group. This area explores the historic and systematic reasons linguistic features are associated with certain racial groups.

== In education ==

=== Appropriateness ===
In their critique of American language education, Nelson Flores and Jonathan Rosa argued that the standardization of "appropriate" language in American schooling creates different experiences for racialized students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; "Appropriate" language, defined by the language of the dominant culture, is a construction of raciolinguistic ideologies that uphold certain linguistic practices as normative and others as deficient. These ideologies are defined by the White listening/speaking subject in that "[[minoritized language|language-minoritized]] students [are expected] to mimic the white speaking subject while ignoring the raciolinguistic ideologies that the white listening subject uses to position them as racial Others".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In her LangCrit framework, Alison Crump also explored Whiteness within the construction and education of a standard English and how language scholars may further address language, race, and identity in language education.&lt;ref&gt;Crump, Alison (2014) Introducing [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15427587.2014.936243?journalCode=hcil20 LangCrit: Critical Language and Race Theory, Critical Inquiry in Language Studies], 11/3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Oehring''' (16 June 1891 – 14 May 1940) was a German economist, writer and poet who became a political activist.&lt;ref name=ROlautARB&gt;{{cite web|title=Richard Oehring|author=Anni Rosemarie Becker|url=http://www.lit-nrw.de/dateien/pdf-Dateien/GedenktageOehring.pdf| publisher=Gesellschaft für Literatur in Nordrhein-Westfalen e.V., Münster|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ROlautRD&gt;{{cite web|title=... welch eine Flamme war verloht – Richard Oehring| url=http://www.dehmlow.de/index.php/de/observations/152-welch-eine-flamme-war-verloht-richard-oehring|date=10 July 2015| publisher=Raimund Dehmlow|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Otto Hermann Richard Oehring was born in [[Düsseldorf]].   His father was a senior official with the post office.   While he was growing up he attended schools successively in [[Düsseldorf]], Hamburg and [[Berlin]].&lt;ref name=ROlautARB/&gt; He successfully [[Abitur|completed his schooling]] in 1909 in Berlin.  By this time he was a member of the circle of youthful left wing intellectuals surrounding the poet [[Henriette Hardenberg]] and her brother Hans.&lt;ref name=ROlautRD/&gt; A period of study in [[Munich]] followed and Richard Oehring, along with his brother Fritz joined the informal so-called "Tat" (''"Deed[s]"'') group of left-leaning politically aware liberal writers and artists:  fellow members included [[Oskar Maria Graf]], [[Franz Jung]] and [[Georg Schrimpf]].   Following his return to Berlin, Richard Oehring took to contributing as a business and economics journalist to the "Buchwald Börsenberichte" newspaper.&lt;ref name=ROlautRD/&gt; From 1912 he was providing pieces for "[[Die Aktion]]", a newly launched magazine with its focus on literature and left-wing politics in which he also published some of his poetic and lyrical creations.   One of these was his essay "Der Käfig" which appeared in 1913/1914.   During 1913/1914 he actively promoted "[[Die Aktion]] Authors' Evenings" at the magazine, together with the likes of [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Paul Boldt]], [[Alfred Lichtenstein (writer)|Alfred Lichtenstein]] and [[Franz Pfemfert]].&lt;ref name=ROlautRD/&gt;

His brother Fritz was an early victim of the [[First World War|war]] which broke out in July 1914.   Richard Oehring took part in the war, being stationed in [[Brussels]] where he undertook medical work.   Falling ill, he returned home to [[Berlin]], but was re-assessed and declared fit for military service.   He was reconscripted and deserted, eventually achieving his dismissal by refusing to accept either food or wages.   In March 1915 he married [[Cläre Jung|Cläre Otto]],&lt;ref name=HaiGisFJ/&gt; later described by {{Interlanguage link multi|Fritz Mierau|de}} as "the soul and muse of their little [Berlin based artists' and writers'] circle".&lt;ref&gt;"...die Seele und die Muse des kleinen Kreises."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FriMieVerschwFJ&gt;{{cite book |author=[[:de:Fritz Mierau|Fritz Mierau]]|title= Das Verschwinden von Franz Jung|place=Hamburg|date= 1998|publisher= Nautilus |isbn=978-3894012946|page= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1915 they produced "{{Interlanguage link multi|Die freie Straße|de}}" ''(The Free Street)'', an [[Anarchism|Anarchist]]-[[Dada]]ist journal appearing at irregular intervals and of which, by the end of 1917, six editions had been produced.   Other members of the production team were [[Franz Jung]], [[Otto Gross]] and [[Georg Schrimpf]].   A feature of "Die freie Straße" was that the team took turns to take responsibility for production.   Richard Oehring was the producer for editions 3 and 4.

Oehring's marriage to [[Cläre Jung|Cläre Otto]] ended in divorce in 1917, and by 1918 she was living with [[Franz Jung]], although it was only in 1924 that the two of them married.&lt;ref name=HaiGisFJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://othes.univie.ac.at/13223/1/2011-02-02_0247271.pdf |title=Franz Jung als Außenseiter |work=Diplomarbeit bei Universität Wien|author=Gisela Hairer Mag.phil.|publisher=Universität Wien Bibliotheks- und Archivwesen |date=February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The affair put an end to the friendship between Richard Oehring and Franz Jung.&lt;ref name=HaiGisFJ/&gt; Following the divorce Oehring traveled to [[Vienna]] to visit [[Otto Gross]].  In Vienna he met Margarethe Kuh, a sister of Gross's friend, the writer [[Anton Kuh]]:  Margarethe became Oehring's second wife.&lt;ref name=ROlautRD/&gt; Their daughter, Aurora Miriam "Mimi" Oehring, was born in Berlin&lt;ref name=AMOGeblautRD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://de3.netpure.de/cgi-bin/baseportal.pl?htx=/RDehmlow/Otto_Gross_Daten&amp;localparams=1&amp;db=Otto_Gross_Daten&amp;cmd=list&amp;range=1050,30&amp;cmd=all&amp;Id=1550|title=Lebenslinien: Otto Gross &amp; Zeitgenossen – Eine Chronologie:  Die Datenbank versteht sich als eine – aus Briefen und anderen Dokumenten erschlossene – Chronologie nachprüfbarer Tagesereignisse, die das Leben des österreichischen Arztes und Revolutionärs Otto Gross (1877–1920) und seiner Zeitgenossinnen und -genossen illustrieren will.|date=8 August 2015|author= Raimund Dehmlow (author &amp; publisher)|work=Other sources state that Aurora Miriam Oehring was born in Russia, but a birth location of Berlin in Germany appears to be more persuasively sourced, and is more consistent with the time lines implicit in other sources on Richard Oehring|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in March 1918.&lt;ref name=MOgen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geni.com/people/Miriam-Oehring/6000000026285709181|author= Corin Alexander Nicholls Stone (compiler)|title=Miriam Oehring|publisher=Geni / My Heritage|date=10 March 2015|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Oehring now took work with [[Alfons Goldschmidt]] on the Berlin-based "Räte-Zeitung" (newspaper).&lt;ref name=ROlautRS&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cHSnrMbNzm8C&amp;pg=PA199&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=%22Richard+Oehring%22+%22R%C3%A4te-Zeitung%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=e5uMyJkLLe&amp;sig=sy8oibXGA3awxmsw0C-HQ_i3a8A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjVwcSktpjLAhWMORoKHVHfDf4Q6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Richard%20Oehring%22%20%22R%C3%A4te-Zeitung%22&amp;f=false|title=Artists, Intellectuals and the USPD 1917–1922  |work=Literaturwissenschaftliches Jahrbuch.

Minck, to the so-called "Co-operative Council for Economic Reconstruction" (''"Rätegenossenschaft für wirtschaftlichen Aufbau"'').&lt;ref name=ROlautRD/&gt;

In 1922 Oehring moved to the [[Soviet Union]]. By May 1923 he was back in [[Berlin]], possibly on account of his wife's health.   That month he wrote in a letter to "Comrade" {{Interlanguage link multi|Oskar Wöhrle|de}}, then in Konstanz, describing Margarethe's illness which he believed would be cured by plenty of rest and good food.&lt;ref name=ROlautRD/&gt; In Berlin he worked as a trade representative for the Soviet Union, also participating in the film production unit of the Soviet sponsored [[Workers International Relief|Workers' International Relief (''IAH – Internationale Arbeiter-Hilfe / Международная рабочая помощь'')]] organisation in Berlin. In 1931 he became a member of the "Arplan".&lt;ref&gt;Arplan = "Arbeitsgemeinschaft zum Studium der Planwirtschaft" (''"Working Study Group on Planned Economies"'')&lt;/ref&gt; Fellow members included [[Arvid Harnack]], [[Georg Lukács]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Friedrich Lenz|de|3=Friedrich Lenz (Nationalökonom)}} and [[Karl August Wittfogel]].   The commentator {{Interlanguage link multi|Igor Cornelissen|nl}} believes that Oehring probably accompanied the "Arplan" delegation that travelled to the Soviet Union in 1932, although his name is not included in the official list of delegates.&lt;ref name=ROlautRD/&gt;

January 1933 brought [[Machtergreifung|régime change]] [[Gleichschaltung|to]] [[Nazi Germany|Germany]].   Richard Oehrling and his family left the country the same year, relocating to the [[Netherlands]] where he worked for "Exportchleb", the Soviet trade organisation in the Netherlands, and at the same time undertaking work for the [[Russian Intelligence Community|Soviet security services]].   While in the Netherlands he was in close contact with [[Ignace Reiss]], a Soviet spy who fell foul of Moscow's shifting power structures and was shot by an [[NKVD]] [[Vladimir Pravdin|assassin]] in [[Lausanne]] a few weeks after sending a letter to [[Stalin|Party general secretary Stalin]] in which he announced his "defection", and support for [[Trotsky]] (who by this time had become a high-profile opponent of the Soviet dictator).   While in the Netherlands Oehring recruited {{Interlanguage link multi|Johan Huijts|nl}}, the foreign correspondent of the "[[Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant|Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant (NRC)]]" (newspaper), to work for Soviet intelligence.   It is not clear whether Oehring's resignation from "Exportchleb" in 1939 was connected with the killing of [[Ignace Reiss|Reiss]].   As an Economics advisor for the [[Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant|NRC]], he provided the Rotterdam newspaper with Economics reports from the Soviet Union that were published in its business section.   Huijts later recalled that Oehring was much troubled by his failure to obtain Soviet citizenship during the count-down to the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name=ROlautRD/&gt;

In May 1940 the [[Wehrmacht|German army]] [[Battle of the Netherlands|invaded the Netherlands]] and Richard Oehrling responded by committing suicide on 14 May, the day on which the Netherlands formally surrendered.   During the [[Netherlands in World War II|German occupation]] Margarethe Oehrling was arrested and imprisoned, but both she and their daughter survived the war.   Margarethe was still alive in 1977.&lt;ref name=ROlautRD/&gt;

==Philosophy==

===Quantified modal logic===
Ruth Barcan Marcus' earliest published work was the publication of the first axiomatic study of modal logic with quantifiers. These three ground-breaking articles were "A Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication", ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'' (JSL, 1946), "The Deduction Theorem in a Functional Calculus of First Order Based on Strict Implication" (JSL, 1946), "The Identity of Individuals in a Strict Functional Calculus of Second Order", (JSL, 1947). The three articles are published under Marcus' maiden name: Ruth C. Barcan. The widely discussed [[Barcan formula]] is introduced as an axiom in QML. The papers of 1946 and 1947, were the first systems of quantified modal logic, which extended some propositional modal systems of [[Clarence Irving Lewis]] to first and second order; a major accomplishment in the development of 20th century logic. Lewis gives Marcus special recognition in his "Notes on the Logic of Intension", originally printed in ''Structure, Method, and Meaning: Essays in Honor of Henry M. Sheffer'' (New York, 1951). Here Lewis recognizes Barcan Marcus as the first logician to extend propositional logic as a higher order intensional logic.

===Direct reference&lt;!--'Tag theory of names' redirects here--&gt;===
Ruth Barcan Marcus proposed the view in the [[philosophy of language]] according to which proper names are what Marcus termed mere "tags" ("Modalities and Intensional Languages" (''Synthese'', 1961) and elsewhere). According to her '''tag theory of names'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (a [[direct reference theory]]), these "tags" are used to refer to an object, which is the bearer of the name. The meaning of the name is regarded as exhausted by this referential function. This view contrasts for example with late [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[description theory of proper names]] as well as [[John Searle]]'s [[cluster description theory of names]] which prevailed at the time. This view of proper names (presented in 1962 with [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] as commentator) has been identified by [[Quentin Smith]] with the theory of reference given in [[Saul Kripke]]'s ''[[Naming and Necessity]]''. However, in a recent laudatio to Ruth Barcan Marcus, Professor [[Timothy Williamson]] says:

{{quote|One of the ideas in them that resonates most with current philosophy of language is that of proper names as mere tags, without descriptive content. This is not Kripke's idea of names as [[rigid designators]], designating the same object with respect to all relevant worlds, for ‘rigidified’ [[definite description]]s are rigid designators but still have descriptive content. Rather, it is the idea, later developed by [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]] and others, that proper names are directly referential, in the sense that they contribute only their bearer to the propositions expressed by sentences in which they occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2008/10/timothy-william.html Timothy Williamson's Tribute to Ruth Barcan Marcus on the Occasion of Her Receipt of the Lauener Prize], Leiter Reports: A Philosophical Blog, October 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The philosopher of language [[Stephen Neale]] has also argued against Professor Smith's claim in the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''.&lt;ref name="academia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/6546412/Neale_Kripke|title=Neale Kripke &amp;#124; Stephen Neale - Academia.edu|publisher=academia.edu|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Necessity of identity===
Marcus formally proved the necessity of identity in 1946 and informally argued for it in 1961 and thereafter thus rejecting the possibility of contingent identity. See ''Journal of Symbolic Logic'', (1947) 12: pp 12–15

===Semantics of QML===
Marcus prefers an interpretation where the domain of the interpretation comprises individual entities in the actual world. She also suggests that for some uses an alternative substitutional semantics is warranted. She provides arguments against possibilia. See  "Dispensing with Possibilia" (Proceedings of the American Philosophical Association, 1975–76); "Possibilia and Possible Worlds" (''Grazer Philosophische Studien'', 1985–86).

===Moral conflict===
Marcus defines a consistent set of moral principles as one in which there is some "possible world " in which they are all obeyable. That they may conflict in the actual world is not a mark of inconsistency. As in the case of necessity of identity, there was a resistance to this interpretation of moral conflict. Her argument counts against a widely received view that systems of moral rules are inevitably inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;See "Moral Dilemmas and Consistency" (Journal of Philosophy, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief===
It is proposed that believing is a relationship of an agent to a possible state of affairs under specified internal and external circumstances. Assenting to a quoted sentence (the disquotation account of belief) is only one behavioral marker of believing. Betting behavior is another. The wholly language-centered account of belief (e.g. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]]) is rejected. Where an agent would traditionally be described as believing an impossibility until its impossibility was disclosed, Marcus proposes that under those circumstances the agent should say that she only claimed to believe an impossibility. In much the same way, when a mathematician discovers that one of his conjectures is false, and since if it is mathematically false it is impossible, he would say he only claimed that the conjecture was true. Odd as this proposal is, it is analogous to the widely accepted principle about knowing: if we claim to know P, and P turns out false, we do not say we used to know it, we say we were mistaken in so claiming.&lt;ref&gt;See "A Proposed Solution to a Puzzle About Belief" (Foundations of Analytic Philosophy in Midwest Studies, 1981) and "Rationality and Believing the Impossible" (The Journal of Philosophy, 1983 and elsewhere).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Essentialism===
Aristotelian Essentialism is concerned with properties which Marcus defines in the context of a modal framework. One proposal is that a property is essential if something has it, not everything has it, if something has it then it has it necessarily, and it is not wholly individuating ''e.g.'' a natural kind property. It is otherwise claimed by Quine and others that modal logic or semantics is committed to essentialist truths. Marcus argues informally that there are interpretations of some modal systems in which all essentialist claims are false. [[Terence Parsons]] later formally proved this result.&lt;ref&gt;Philosophical Review, 78 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substitutional quantification===
An alternative to Tarskian  (model theoretic) semantics is proposed for some uses where "the truth conditions for quantified formuli are given purely in terms of truth with no appeal to domains of interpretation". (Later called by others "[[truth value]] semantics".)  She shows that the claim that such a semantics leads to contradictions is false. Such a semantics may be of interest for mathematics ''e.g.'' Hartry Field, or for fictional discourse. Objectual quantification is required for interpretation of identity and other metaphysical categories.

{{C. S. Peirce articles}}
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] began writing on [[semiotics]], which he also called semeiotics, meaning the philosophical study of [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]], in the 1860s, around the time that he devised his system of [[Categories (Peirce)|three categories]]. During the 20th century, the term "semiotics" was adopted to cover all tendencies of sign researches, including [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s [[semiology]], which began in linguistics as a completely separate tradition. 

Peirce adopted the term ''[[semiosis]]'' (or ''semeiosis'') and defined it to mean an "action, or influence, which is, or involves, a cooperation of ''three'' subjects, such as a sign, its object, and its interpretant, this trirelative influence not being in any way resolvable into actions between pairs".&lt;ref&gt;1906, EP 2:411 and CP 5.484. Peirce went on to say: "''Σημείωσις'' [Sêmeíôsis] in Greek of the Roman period, as early as Cicero's time, if I remember rightly, meant the action of almost any kind of sign; and my definition confers on anything that so acts the title of a 'sign.'" See [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dshmei%2Fwsis ''Σημείωσις'' in the Liddell &amp; Scott Ancient Greek lexicon] at the Perseus Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;  This specific type of [[triadic relation]] is fundamental to Peirce's understanding of "logic as formal semiotic". By "logic" he meant philosophical logic. He [[Classification of the sciences (Peirce)|eventually divided]] (philosophical) logic, or formal semiotics, into (1) speculative grammar, or stechiology on the elements of semiosis (sign, object, interpretant), how signs can signify and, in relation to that, what kinds of signs, objects, and interpretants there are, how signs combine, and how some signs embody or incorporate others; (2) logical critic, or logic proper, on the modes of inference; and (3) speculative rhetoric, or methodeutic, the philosophical theory of inquiry, including [[Pragmaticism|his form of pragmatism]]. His speculative grammar, or stechiology, is this article's subject.

Peirce conceives of and discusses things like representations, interpretations, and assertions broadly and in terms of philosophical logic, rather than in terms of psychology, linguistics, or social studies. He places philosophy at a level of generality between mathematics and the special sciences of nature and mind, such that it draws principles from mathematics and supplies principles to special sciences.&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of philosophy, see for instance "A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", CP 1.183-186, 1903 and "Minute Logic", CP 1.239-241, 1902. See Peirce's definitions of philosophy at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/cenoscopy.html Cenoscopy]" and "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/philosophy.html Philosophy]".&lt;/ref&gt; On the one hand, his semiotic theory does not resort to special experiences or special experiments in order to settle its questions. On the other hand, he draws continually on examples from common experience, and his semiotics is not contained in a mathematical or deductive system and does not proceed chiefly by drawing necessary conclusions about purely hypothetical objects or cases. As philosophical logic, it is ''about'' the drawing of conclusions deductive, inductive, or hypothetically explanatory. Peirce's semiotics, in its classifications, its critical analysis of kinds of inference, and its theory of inquiry, is philosophical logic studied in terms of signs and their triadic relations as positive phenomena in general.

==Semiotic elements==
{{Semiotics}}
Here is Peirce's definition of the triadic sign relation that formed the core of his definition of logic.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Namely, a sign is something, ''A'', which brings something, ''B'', its ''interpretant'' sign determined or created by it, into the same sort of correspondence with something, ''C'', its ''object'', as that in which itself stands to ''C''. (Peirce 1902, NEM 4, 20–21).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition, together with Peirce's definitions of ''correspondence'' and ''determination'', is sufficient to derive all of the statements that are necessarily true for all sign relations. Yet, there is much more to the theory of signs than simply proving universal theorems about generic sign relations. There is also the task of classifying the various species and subspecies of sign relations. As a practical matter, of course, familiarity with the full range of concrete examples is indispensable to theory and application both.

In Peirce's theory of signs, a ''sign'' is something that stands in a well-defined kind of relation to two other things, its ''object'' and its ''interpretant sign''. Although Peirce's definition of a sign is independent of psychological subject matter and his theory of signs covers more ground than linguistics alone, it is nevertheless the case that many of the more familiar examples and illustrations of sign relations will naturally be drawn from [[linguistics]] and [[psychology]], along with our ordinary experience of their subject matters.

For example, one way to approach the concept of an interpretant is to think of a psycholinguistic process. In this context, an interpretant can be understood as a sign's effect on the mind, or on anything that acts like a mind, what Peirce calls a ''quasi-mind''. An interpretant is what results from a process of interpretation, one of the types of activity that falls under the heading of ''semiosis''. One usually says that a sign stands ''for'' an object ''to'' an agent, an interpreter. In the upshot, however, it is the sign's effect on the agent that is paramount. This effect is what Peirce called the ''interpretant sign'', or the ''interpretant'' for short. An interpretant in its barest form is a sign's meaning, implication, or ramification, and especial interest attaches to the types of semiosis that proceed from obscure signs to relatively clear interpretants. In logic and mathematics the most clarified and most succinct signs for an object are called ''[[canonical form]]s'' or ''[[Normal form (abstract rewriting)|normal forms]]''.

Peirce argued that logic is the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are [[Indexicality|indexical]] such as reactions. Peirce held that "all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., CP 5.448 footnote, from "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; along with their representational and inferential relations. He argued that, since all thought takes time, all thought is in signs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs. (Peirce, 1868&lt;ref&gt;"Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed for Man" (''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint]), ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' vol. 2 (1868), pp. 103-114. Reprinted (CP 5.213-263, the quote is from para. 253).&lt;/ref&gt;)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thought is not necessarily connected with a brain. It appears in the work of bees, of crystals, and throughout the purely physical world; and one can no more deny that it is really there, than that the colors, the shapes, etc., of objects are really there. Consistently adhere to that unwarrantable denial, and you will be driven to some form of idealistic nominalism akin to Fichte's. Not only is thought in the organic world, but it develops there. But as there cannot be a General without Instances embodying it, so there cannot be thought without Signs. We must here give "Sign" a very wide sense, no doubt, but not too wide a sense to come within our definition. Admitting that connected Signs must have a Quasi-mind, it may further be declared that there can be no isolated sign. Moreover, signs require at least two Quasi-minds; a Quasi-utterer and a Quasi-interpreter; and although these two are at one (i.e., are one mind) in the sign itself, they must nevertheless be distinct. In the Sign they are, so to say, welded. Accordingly, it is not merely a fact of human Psychology, but a necessity of Logic, that every logical evolution of thought should be dialogic.

===Sign relation===

Signhood is a way of being in relation, not a way of being in itself. Anything is a sign — not as itself, but in some relation to another. The role of sign is constituted as one role among three: object, sign, and interpretant sign. It is an irreducible triadic relation; the roles are distinct even when the things that fill them are not. The roles are but three: a sign of an object leads to interpretants, which, as signs, lead to further interpretants. In various relations, the same thing may be sign or semiotic object. The question of what a sign is depends on the concept of a ''[[sign relation]]'', which depends on the concept of a ''[[triadic relation]]''. This, in turn, depends on the concept of a ''[[Relation (mathematics)|relation]]'' itself. Peirce depended on mathematical ideas about the [[Relation reduction|reducibility]] of relations — dyadic, triadic, tetradic, and so forth. According to Peirce's Reduction Thesis,&lt;ref&gt;See "The Logic of Relatives", The ''Monist'', Vol. 7, 1897, pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;#PPA161,M1 161]-217, see [https://books.google.com/books?id=pa0LAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA554&amp;#PPA183,M1 p. 183] (via Google Books with registration apparently not required). Reprinted in the ''Collected Papers'', vol. 3, paragraphs 456-552, see paragraph 483.&lt;/ref&gt; (a) triads are necessary because genuinely triadic relations cannot be completely analyzed in terms of monadic and dyadic predicates, and (b) triads are sufficient because there are no genuinely tetradic or larger polyadic relations—all higher-[[arity]] ''n''-adic relations can be analyzed in terms of triadic and lower-arity relations and are reducible to them. Peirce and others, notably Robert Burch (1991) and Joachim Hereth Correia and Reinhard Pöschel (2006), have offered proofs of the Reduction Thesis.&lt;ref&gt;* Burch, Robert (1991), ''A Peircean Reduction Thesis: The Foundations of Topological Logic'', Texas Tech University Press, Lubbock, Texas

* In 1954 [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W. V. O. Quine]] claimed to prove the reducibility of larger predicates to dyadic predicates, in Quine, W.V.O., "Reduction to a dyadic predicate", ''Selected Logic Papers''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Peirce, a genuinely monadic predicate characteristically expresses quality. A genuinely dyadic predicate — reaction or resistance. A genuinely triadic predicate — representation or mediation. Thus Peirce's theory of relations underpins his philosophical theory of three basic categories ([[#Classes of signs|see below]]).

''Extension × intension = information.'' {{Citation needed|reason=Interpretative claim, needs backing|date=January 2018}} Two traditional approaches to sign relation, necessary though insufficient, are the way of ''[[Extension (semantics)|extension]]'' (a sign's objects, also called breadth, denotation, or application) and the way of ''[[intension]]'' (the objects' characteristics, qualities, attributes referenced by the sign, also called depth, [[Comprehension (logic)|comprehension]], significance, or connotation). Peirce adds a third, the way of ''[[Logic of information|information]]'', including change of information, in order to integrate the other two approaches into a unified whole.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1867), "Upon Logical Comprehension and Extension" (CP 2.391-426), (W 2:70-86, PEP [http://www.iupui.edu/~peirce/writings/v2/w2/w2_06/v2_06.htm Eprint]).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, because of the equation above, if a term's total amount of information stays the same, then the more that the term 'intends' or signifies about objects, the fewer are the objects to which the term 'extends' or applies. A proposition's comprehension consists in its implications.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S and Ladd-Franklin, Christine, "Signification (and Application, in logic)", ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'' v. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA528 p. 528]. Reprinted CP 2.431-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Determination.'' A sign depends on its object in such a way as to represent its object — the object enables and, in a sense, determines the sign. A physically causal sense of this stands out especially when a sign consists in an indicative reaction. The interpretant depends likewise on both the sign and the object — the object determines the sign to determine the interpretant. But this determination is not a succession of dyadic events, like a row of toppling dominoes; sign determination is triadic. For example, an interpretant does not merely represent something which represented an object; instead an interpretant represents something ''as'' a sign representing an object. It is an informational kind of determination, a rendering of something more determinately representative.&lt;ref name=determined&gt;Peirce, letter to William James, dated 1909, see EP 2:492.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce used the word "determine" not in strictly deterministic sense, but in a sense of "specializes", ''bestimmt'',&lt;ref name=determined /&gt; involving variation in measure, like an influence. Peirce came to define sign, object, and interpretant by their (triadic) mode of determination, not by the idea of representation, since that is part of what is being defined.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., "A Letter to Lady Welby" (1908), ''Semiotic and Significs'', pp. 80-81: &lt;blockquote style="font-size:100%;"&gt;I define a Sign as anything which is so determined by something else, called its Object, and so determines an effect upon a person, which effect I call its Interpretant, that the latter is thereby mediately determined by the former. My insertion of "upon a person" is a sop to Cerberus, because I despair of making my own broader conception understood.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The object determines the sign to determine another sign — the interpretant — to be related to the object ''as the sign is related to the object'', hence the interpretant, fulfilling its function as sign of the object, determines a further interpretant sign. The process is logically structured to perpetuate itself, and is definitive of sign, object, and interpretant in general.&lt;ref name=Marty&gt;See "[http://perso.numericable.fr/robert.marty/semiotique/access.htm 76 definitions of the sign by C.S.Peirce]", collected by Professor Robert Marty (University of Perpignan, France).&lt;/ref&gt; In semiosis, every sign is an interpretant in a chain stretching both fore and aft. The relation of informational or logical determination which constrains object, sign, and interpretant is more general than the special cases of causal or physical determination. In general terms, any information about one of the items in the sign relation tells you something about the others, although the actual amount of this information may be nil in some species of sign relations.

===Sign, object, interpretant===

Peirce held that there are exactly three basic semiotic elements, the sign, object, and interpretant, as outlined above and fleshed out here in a bit more detail:
*A ''sign'' (or ''representamen'') represents, in the broadest possible sense of "represents". It is something interpretable as saying something about something. It is not necessarily symbolic, linguistic, or artificial.
*An ''object'' (or ''semiotic object'') is a subject matter of a sign and an interpretant. It can be anything discussable or thinkable, a thing, event, relationship, quality, law, argument, etc., and can even be fictional, for instance Hamlet.&lt;ref name=fictive&gt;A Letter to William James, EP 2:498, 1909, viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/dynamicalobject.html Dynamical Object]&lt;/ref&gt; All of those are special or partial objects. The object most accurately is the [[universe of discourse]] to which the partial or special object belongs.&lt;ref&gt;A Letter to William James, EP 2:492, 1909, viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/object.html Object]".&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a perturbation of Pluto's orbit is a sign about Pluto but ultimately not only about Pluto.
*An ''interpretant'' (or ''interpretant sign'') is the sign's more or less clarified meaning or ramification, a kind of form or idea of the difference which the sign's being true or undeceptive would make. (Peirce's sign theory concerns meaning in the broadest sense, including logical implication, not just the meanings of words as properly clarified by a dictionary.) The interpretant is a sign (a) of the object and (b) of the interpretant's "predecessor" (the interpreted sign) as being a sign of the same object. The interpretant is an ''interpretation'' in the sense of a ''product'' of an interpretive process or a ''content'' in which an interpretive relation culminates, though this product or content may itself be an act, a state of agitation, a conduct, etc. Such is what is summed up in saying that the sign stands ''for'' the object ''to'' the interpretant.

Some of the understanding needed by the mind depends on familiarity with the object. In order to know what a given sign denotes, the mind needs some experience of that sign's object collaterally to that sign or sign system, and in this context Peirce speaks of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.&lt;ref&gt;See pp. 404-409 in "Pragmatism", EP 2.  Ten quotes on collateral observation from Peirce provided by Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101#57101 here]. Note: Ransdell's quotes from CP 8.178-179, are also in EP 2:493-4, which gives their date as 1909; and his quote from CP 8.183, is also in EP 2:495-6, which gives its date as 1909.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;span id=representamen&gt;"''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/representamen.html Representamen]''"&lt;/span&gt; (properly with the "a" long and stressed: {{IPAc-en|r|ɛ|p|r|ᵻ|z|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|m|ən}}) was adopted ([[wiktionary:representamen|not coined]]) by Peirce as his blanket technical term for any and every sign or sign-like thing covered by his theory. It is a question of whether the theoretically defined "representamen" covers only the cases covered by the popular word "sign." The word "representamen" is there in case a divergence should emerge. Peirce's example was this: Sign action always involves a mind. If a sunflower, by doing nothing more than turning toward the sun, were thereby to become fully able to reproduce a sunflower turning in just the same way toward the sun, then the first sunflower's turning would be a representamen of the sun yet not a sign of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;"A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", EP 2:272-3, 1903&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce eventually stopped using the word "representamen."&lt;ref&gt;A Draft of a Letter to Lady Welby, ''Semiotic and Significs'', p. 193, 1905&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce made various classifications of his semiotic elements, especially of the sign and the interpretant. Of particular concern in understanding the sign-object-interpretant triad is this: In relation to a sign, its object and its interpretant are either immediate (present in the sign) or mediate.
{{Ordered list|
|''Sign'', always immediate to itself — that is, in a tautologous sense, present in or at itself, even if it is not immediate to a mind or immediately accomplished without processing or is a general apprehended only in its instances.
|''Object'' {{Ordered list|list-style-type=lower-roman
|''Immediate object'', the object as represented in the sign.
|''Dynamic object'', the object as it really is, on which the idea which is the immediate object is "founded, as on bedrock"&lt;ref&gt;In EP 2:407, viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/realobject.html Real Object]"&lt;/ref&gt; Also called the dynamoid object, the dynamical object.}}
|''Interpretant'' {{Ordered list|list-style-type=lower-roman
|''Immediate interpretant'', the quality of the impression which a sign is fit to produce, not any actual reaction, and which the sign carries with it even before there is an interpreter or quasi-interpreter. It is what is ordinarily called the sign's meaning.
|''Dynamic interpretant'', the actual effect (apart from the feeling) of the sign on a mind or quasi-mind, for instance the agitation of the feeling.
|''Final interpretant'', the effect which the sign ''would'' have on the conduct of any mind or quasi-mind if circumstances allowed that effect to be fully achieved. It is the sign's end or purpose. The final interpretant of one's inquiry about the weather is the inquiry's purpose, the effect which the response would have on the plans for the day of anybody in one's shoes. The final interpretant of a line of investigation as such is the truth as the ideal final opinion and ''would'' be reached sooner or later but still inevitably by investigation adequately prolonged, though the truth remains independent of that which you or I or any finite community of investigators believe.}}
}}

The immediate object is, from the viewpoint of a theorist, really a kind of sign of the dynamic object; but phenomenologically it ''is'' the object until there is reason to go beyond it, and somebody analyzing (critically but not theoretically) a given semiosis will consider the immediate object to be ''the'' object until there is reason to do otherwise.&lt;ref name=RansdellIO&gt;See Ransdell, Joseph, "On the Use and Abuse of the Immediate/Dynamical Object Distinction" draft 2007, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/ransdell/useabuse.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce preferred phrases like ''dynamic object'' over ''real object'' since the object might be fictive — Hamlet, for instance, to whom one grants a fictive reality, a reality within the universe of discourse of the play ''Hamlet''.&lt;ref name=fictive /&gt;

It is initially tempting to regard immediate, dynamic, and final interpretants as forming a temporal succession in an actual process of semiosis, especially since their conceptions refer to beginning, midstages, and end of a semiotic process. But instead their distinctions from each other are modal or categorial. The immediate interpretant is a quality of impression which a sign is fitted to produce, a special potentiality. The dynamic interpretant is an actuality. The final interpretant is a kind of norm or necessity unaffected by actual trends of opinion or interpretation. One does not actually obtain a final interpretant per se; instead one may successfully ''coincide'' with it.&lt;ref&gt;See Peirce's 1909 letter (or letters) to William James, CP 8.314 and 8.315, and ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 496-7, and a 1909 letter to [[Victoria, Lady Welby|Lady Welby]], ''Semiotic and Significs'' pp. 110-1, all under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/finalinterpretant.html Final Interpretant]" at CDPT. Also see 1873, MS 218 (Robin 379) in ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' v. 3, p. 79, on the final opinion, and CP 8.184, on final opinion as final interpretant, in a review of a book by Lady Welby.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce, a [[fallibilism|fallibilist]], holds that one has no guarantees that one has done so, but only compelling reasons, sometimes very compelling, to think so and, in practical matters, must sometimes act with complete confidence of having done so. (Peirce said that it is often better in practical matters to rely on instinct, sentiment, and tradition, than on theoretical inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", 1898, Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published CP 1.616-48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., comm.), pp. 105-22, reprinted in ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 27-41.&lt;/ref&gt;) In any case, insofar as truth is the final interpretant of a pursuit of truth, one believes, in effect, that one coincides with a final interpretant of some question about what is true, whenever and to whatever extent that one believes that one reaches a truth.

==Classes of signs&lt;!--linked from 'Rheme'--&gt;==

Peirce proposes several typologies and definitions of the signs. More than 76 definitions of what a sign is have been collected throughout Peirce's work.&lt;ref name=76defs&gt;See "76 Definitions of The Sign by C. S. Peirce" collected and analyzed by Robert Marty, Department of Mathematics, University of Perpignan, Perpignan, France, With an Appendix of 12 Further Definitions or Equivalents proposed by Alfred Lang,
Dept of Psychology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/rsources/76defs/76defs.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; Some canonical typologies can nonetheless be observed, one crucial one being the distinction between "icons", "indices" and "[[Symbol (semiotics)|symbols]]" (CP 2.228, CP 2.229 and CP 5.473). The icon-index-symbol typology is chronologically the first but structurally the second of three that fit together as a trio of three-valued parameters in regular scheme of nine kinds of sign. (The three "parameters" (not Peirce's term) are not independent of one another, and the result is a system of ten classes of sign, which are shown further down in this article.)

Peirce's three basic phenomenological [[Categories (Peirce)|categories]] come into central play in these classifications. The 1-2-3 numerations used further below in the exposition of sign classes represents Peirce's associations of sign classes with the categories. The categories are as follows:
{{C. S. Peirce categorial table}}

The three sign typologies depend respectively on (I) the sign itself, (II) how the sign stands for its denoted object, and (III) how the signs stands for its object to its interpretant. Each of the three typologies is a three-way division, a [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomy]], via Peirce's three phenomenological categories.

# ''Qualisigns'', ''sinsigns'', and ''legisigns'' . Every sign is either (qualisign) a quality or possibility, or (sinsign) an actual individual thing, fact, event, state, etc., or (legisign) a norm, habit, rule, law. (Also called ''tones'', ''tokens'', and ''types'', also ''potisigns'', ''actisigns'', and ''famisigns''.)
# ''Icons'', ''indices'', and ''symbols''. Every sign refers either (icon) through similarity to its object, or (index) through factual connection to its object, or (symbol) through interpretive habit or norm of reference to its object.
# ''Rhemes'', ''dicisigns'', and ''arguments'' . Every sign is interpreted either as (rheme) term-like, standing for its object in respect of quality, or as (dicisign) proposition-like, standing for its object in respect of fact, or as (argument) argumentative, standing for its object in respect of habit or law. This is the trichotomy of all signs as building blocks of inference. (Also called ''sumisigns'', ''dicent signs'', and ''suadisigns'', also ''semes'', ''phemes'', and ''delomes''.)

Every sign falls under one class or another within (I) ''and'' within (II) &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;' within (III). Thus each of the three typologies is a three-valued parameter for every sign. The three parameters are not independent of each other; many co-classifications aren't found.&lt;ref name=OnlyTen&gt;For the reasons why, see  CP 2.254-263, reprinted in the ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=ClSjXRIbxAMC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;sig=ACfU3U2LRBoPVu0drFP5F5yV1_Z6sP4dfA pp. 115]-118, and in EP 2:294-296.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is not 27 but instead ten classes of signs fully specified at this level of analysis.

In later years, Peirce attempted a finer level of analysis, defining sign classes in terms of relations not just to sign, object, and interpretant, but to sign, immediate object, dynamic object, immediate interpretant, dynamic interpretant, and final or normal interpretant. He aimed at 10 trichotomies of signs, with the above three trichotomies interspersed among them, and issuing in 66 classes of signs. He did not bring that system into a finished form. In any case, in that system, icon, index, and symbol were classed by category of how they stood for the dynamic object, while rheme, dicisign, and argument were classed by the category of how they stood to the final or normal interpretant.&lt;ref&gt;See CP 8.343-75, from a 1908 partial draft of a letter to Lady Welby.&lt;/ref&gt;

These conceptions are specific to Peirce's theory of signs and are not exactly equivalent to general uses of the notions of "icon", "index", "symbol", "tone", "token", "type", "term" (or "rheme"), "proposition" (or "dicisign), "argument".

===I. Qualisign, sinsign, legisign===
Also called ''tone, token, type''; and also called ''potisign, actisign, famisign''.

This is the typology of the sign as distinguished by ''sign's own'' phenomenological category (set forth in 1903, 1904, etc.).

#A ''qualisign'' (also called ''tone'', ''potisign'', and ''mark'') is a sign which consists in a quality of feeling, a possibility, a "First."
#A ''sinsign'' (also called ''token'' and ''actisign'') is a sign which consists in a reaction/resistance, an actual singular thing, an actual occurrence or fact, a "Second."
#A ''legisign'' (also called ''type'' and ''famisign'') is a sign which consists in a (general) idea, a norm or law or habit, a representational relation, a "Third."

A ''replica'' (also called ''instance'') of a legisign is a sign, often an actual individual one (a sinsign), which embodies that legisign. A replica is a sign for the associated legisign, and therefore is also a sign for the legisign's object. All legisigns need sinsigns as replicas, for expression. Some but not all legisigns are symbols. All symbols are legisigns. Different words with the same meaning are symbols which are replicas of that symbol which consists in their meaning but doesn't prescribe qualities of its replicas.&lt;ref name=replicasymbol&gt;"New Elements (Kaina Stoicheia") MS 517 (1904); EP 2:300-324, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/stoicheia/stoicheia.htm Eprint], scroll down to /317/, then first new paragraph&lt;/ref&gt;

===II. Icon, index, symbol===
This is the typology of the sign as distinguished by phenomenological category of its way of denoting the ''object'' (set forth in 1867 and many times in later years). This typology emphasizes the different ways in which the sign refers to its object — the icon by a quality of its own, the index by real connection to its object, and the symbol by a habit or rule for its interpretant. The modes may be compounded, for instance, in a sign that displays a forking line iconically for a fork in the road and stands indicatively near a fork in the road.

#An ''icon'' (also called ''likeness'' and ''semblance'') is a sign that denotes its object by virtue of a quality which is shared by them but which the icon has irrespectively of the object. The icon (for instance, a portrait or a diagram) ''resembles or imitates'' its object. The icon has, of itself, a certain character or aspect, one which the object also has (or is supposed to have) and which lets the icon be interpreted as a sign even if the object does not exist. The icon signifies essentially on the basis of its "ground." (Peirce defined the ground as the pure abstraction of a quality, and the sign's ground as the pure abstraction of the quality in ''respect'' of which the sign refers to its object, whether by resemblance or, as a symbol, by imputing the quality to the object.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the Scholastic conception of a relation's foundation, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fSzt6_-ce-gC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=%22Introducing+Semiotic%22+foundation+ground&amp;sig=kgh62kOzOoFrCOYyAV04YxJ0SOo#PPA61,M1 Deely 1982, p. 61] (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt;). Peirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a "hypoicon", and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the ''image'', which depends on a simple quality; (b) the ''diagram'', whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the ''metaphor'', which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else.&lt;ref&gt;On image, diagram, and metaphor, see "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/hypoicon.html Hypoicon]" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form "All __ is ___" which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations. Peirce held that mathematics is done by diagrammatic thinking — observation of, and experimentation on, diagrams.
#An ''index''&lt;span title="Note appears directly after the current 3 paragraphs on icon, index, and symbol"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; is a sign that denotes its object by virtue of an ''actual connection'' involving them, one that he also calls a ''real relation'' in virtue of its being irrespective of interpretation. It is in any case a relation which is ''in fact'', in contrast to the icon, which has only a ''ground'' for denotation of its object, and in contrast to the symbol, which denotes by an interpretive ''habit or law''. An index which compels attention without conveying any information about its object is a ''pure'' index, though that may be an ideal limit never actually reached. If an indexical relation is a resistance or reaction physically or causally connecting an index to its object, then the index is a ''reagent'' (for example smoke coming from a building is a reagent index of fire). Such an index is really affected or modified by the object, and is the only kind of index which can be used in order to ascertain facts about its object. Peirce also usually held that an index does not have to be an actual individual fact or thing, but can be a general; a disease symptom is general, its occurrence singular; and he usually considered a ''designation'' to be an index, e.g., a pronoun, a proper name, a label on a diagram, etc. (In 1903 Peirce said that only an individual is an index,&lt;ref name=index&gt;In 'A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic', EP 2:274, 1903, and viewable under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/index2.html Index]" at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT].&lt;/ref&gt; gave "seme" as an alternate expression for "index", and called designations "subindices or hyposemes,&lt;ref&gt;In "A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", EP 2:274, 1903, and viewable under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/subindex.html Subindex, Hyposeme]" at the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT].&lt;/ref&gt; which were a kind of symbol; he allowed of a "degenerate index" indicating a non-individual object, as exemplified by an individual thing indicating its own characteristics. But by 1904 he allowed indices to be generals and returned to classing designations as indices. In 1906 he changed the meaning of "seme" to that of the [[#III. Rheme.2C dicisign.2C argument|earlier "sumisign" and "rheme"]].)
#A ''symbol''&lt;span title="Note appears directly after the current 3 paragraphs on icon, index, and symbol"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; is a sign that denotes its object solely by virtue of the fact that it will be interpreted to do so. The symbol consists in a natural or conventional or logical rule, norm, or habit, a habit that lacks (or has shed) dependence on the symbolic sign's having a resemblance or real connection to the denoted object. Thus, a symbol denotes by virtue of its interpretant. Its sign-action (semeiosis) is ruled by a habit, a more or less systematic set of associations that ensures its interpretation. For Peirce, every symbol is a general, and that which we call an actual individual symbol (e.g., on the page) is called by Peirce a ''replica'' or ''instance'' of the symbol. Symbols, like all other legisigns (also called "types"), need actual, individual replicas for expression. The ''proposition'' is an example of a symbol which is irrespective of language and of any form of expression and does not prescribe qualities of its replicas.&lt;ref name=proposition&gt;MS599 c.1902 "Reason's Rules", relevant quote viewable under "MS 599" in "Role of Icons In Predication", Joseph Ransdell, ed. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/rsources/quotes/iconrole.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; A ''word'' that is symbolic (rather than indexical like "this" or iconic like "whoosh!") is an example of a symbol that prescribes qualities (especially looks or sound) of its replicas.&lt;ref name="words"&gt;"A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", EP 2:274, 1903, and "Logical Tracts, No. 2", CP 4.447, c. 1903. Relevant quotes viewable at the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT], under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/symbol.html "Symbol"].&lt;/ref&gt; Not every replica is actual and individual. Two word-symbols with the same meaning (such as English "horse" and Spanish ''{{lang|es|caballo}}'') are symbols which are replicas of that symbol which consists in their shared meaning.&lt;ref name="replicasymbol" /&gt; A book, a theory, a person, each is a complex symbol.

&lt;span id="sign_note"&gt;&amp;nbsp;* ''Note:''&lt;/span&gt; in "On a New List of Categories" (1867) Peirce gave the unqualified term "sign" as an alternate expression for "index", and gave "general sign" as an alternate expression for "symbol". [[#representamen|"Representamen"]] was his blanket technical term for any and every sign or signlike thing covered by his theory.&lt;ref name=representamen&gt;"A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", EP 2:272-3. Relevant quote viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT], under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/representamen.html "Representamen"]&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce soon reserved "sign" to its broadest sense, for index, icon, and symbol alike. He also eventually decided that the symbol is not the only sign which can be called a "general sign" in some sense, and that indices and icons can be generals, generalities, too. The general sign, as such, the generality as a sign, he eventually called, at various times, the "legisign" (1903, 1904), the "type" (1906, 1908), and the "famisign" (1908)&lt;span title="End of note"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;

===III. Rheme, dicisign, argument===

This is the typology of the sign as distinguished by the phenomenological category which the sign's  interpretant attributes to the sign's way of denoting the object (set forth in 1902, 1903, etc.):

#A ''rheme'' (also called ''sumisign'' and ''seme''&lt;span title="Note appears directly after the current 3 paragraphs on rheme, dicisign, and argument"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;) is a sign that represents its object in respect of quality and so, in its signified interpretant, is represented as a character or mark,&lt;ref&gt;A Letter to Lady Welby, ''Semiotic and Significs'' pp. 33-34, 1904, viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/rhema.html "Rhema, Rheme"].&lt;/ref&gt; though it actually may be icon, index, or symbol. The rheme&lt;span title="Note appears directly after the current 3 paragraphs on rheme, dicisign, and argument"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; (seme) stands as its object for some purpose.&lt;ref name=induce&gt;Peirce, 1906, "Prolegomena To an Apology For Pragmaticism", pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA506 506]-507 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA492 492]-546, ''The Monist'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA479 v. XVI, n. 4] (mislabeled "VI"), Oct. 1906, reprinted in CP 4.538&lt;/ref&gt; A proposition with the subject places left blank is a rheme; but subject terms by themselves are also rhemes. A proposition, said Peirce, can be considered a zero-place rheme, a zero-place predicate.
#A ''dicisign'' (also called ''dicent sign'' and ''pheme'' ) is a sign that represents its object in respect of actual existence and so, in its signified interpretant, is represented as indexical,&lt;ref&gt;A Letter to Lady Welby, ''Semiotic and Significs'', pp. 33-34, 1904; also "A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic', EP 2:275-276 and 292, 1903; all three quotes viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/dicent.html Dicent, Dicent Sign, Dicisign]".&lt;/ref&gt; though it actually may be either index or symbol. The dicisign separately indicates its object (as subject of the predicate).&lt;ref name=separately&gt;"New Elements (Kaina Stoicheia)", Manuscript 517 (1904), and EP 2:300-324, see 308, viewable in ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/stoicheia/stoicheia.htm Eprint], scroll down to /308/&lt;/ref&gt; The dicisign "is intended to have some compulsive effect on the interpreter of it".&lt;ref name=induce /&gt; Peirce had generalized the idea of proposition to where a weathercock, photograph, etc., could be considered propositions (or "dicisigns", as he came to call them). A proposition in the conventional sense is a dicent symbol (also called symbolic dicisign). Assertions are also dicisigns.
#An ''argument'' (also called ''suadisign'' and ''delome'') is a sign that represents its object in respect of law or habit and so, in its signified interpretant, is represented as symbolic (and was indeed a symbol in the first place).&lt;ref&gt;"A Syllabus of Certain Topics of Logic", EP 2:296, 1903, quote viewable at [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html CDPT] under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/argument.html Argument]".&lt;/ref&gt; The argument separately "monstrates" its signified interpretant (the argument's conclusion); an argument stripped of all signs of such monstrative relationship is, or becomes, a dicisign.&lt;ref name=separately /&gt; It represents "a process of change in thoughts or signs, as if to induce this change in the Interpreter" through the interpreter's own self-control.&lt;ref name=induce /&gt; A novel, a work of art, the universe, can be a delome in Peirce's terms.

&amp;nbsp;*''Note:'' In his "Prolegomena To an Apology For Pragmaticism" (The ''Monist'', v. XVI, no. 4, Oct. 1906), Peirce uses the words "seme", "pheme", and "delome" (pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA506 506], 507, etc.) for the rheme-dicisign-argument typology, but retains the word "rheme" for the predicate ([https://books.google.com/books?id=3KoLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA530 p. 530]) in his system of Existential Graphs. Also note that Peirce once offered "seme" as an alternate expression for "index" in 1903.&lt;ref name=index /&gt;

===The three sign typologies together: ten classes of sign===
The three typologies, labeled "I.", "II.", and "III.",  are shown together in the table below. As parameters, they are not independent of one another. As previously said, many co-classifications aren't found.&lt;ref name="OnlyTen" /&gt; The slanting and vertical lines show the options for co-classification of a given sign (and appear in MS 339, August 7, 1904, viewable [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/attachment/220287/2-2/moz-screenshot-1.jpg here] at the Lyris peirce-l archive&lt;ref&gt;the image was provided by [http://www.iutc3.unicaen.fr/~moranb/ Bernard Morand] of the Institut Universitaire de Technologie (France), D&amp;#233;partement Informatique.&lt;/ref&gt;).

&amp;nbsp;*''Note:'' As noted above, in "On a New List of Categories" (1867) Peirce gave the unqualified word "sign" as an alternate expression for "index", and gave "general sign" as an alternate expression for "symbol." Peirce soon reserved "sign" to its broadest sense, for index, icon, and symbol alike, and eventually decided that symbols are not the only signs which can be called "general signs" in some sense.

'''Tye Leung Schulze''' became the first [[Chinese American]] woman to vote when she cast a ballot in San Francisco on May 19, 1912. The ''San Francisco Call'' stated that she was "the first Chinese woman in the history of the world to exercise the electoral franchise." Schulze was also the first Chinese woman hired to work at [[United States Immigration Station, Angel Island|Angel Island]].&lt;ref name="NWHM"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year= | title=Voting | work=Chinese American Women: A History of Resilience and Resistance | publisher=National Women's History Museum | url=http://www.nwhm.org/online-exhibits/chinese/25.html | accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a designated [[Women's History Month]] Honoree by the [[National Women's History Project]].&lt;ref name="WHM"&gt;{{cite web | author= | year=2007 | title=Monique Mehta  | work=Women's History Month | publisher=[[National Women's History Project]] | url=http://nwhp.org/whm/mehta_bio.php | accessdate=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

Tye Leung was born in [[San Francisco, California]] in 1887. She was one of eight children and her father was a Chinese [[Shoemaking|cobbler]] while her mother ran a [[boarding house]]. As a teenager she was placed in an [[arranged marriage]] to a man in [[Butte, Montana]]. At 14 she was saved from the arranged marriage by [[Donaldina Cameron]] of the [[Presbyterian]] Mission Home. At the Mission she learned to speak English, studied Christianity, and helped Cameron rescue Chinese slaves by acting as an [[interpreter]].&lt;ref name="LeeStefanowska1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lily Xiao Hong Lee|author2=A.

Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-0043-1|pages=185–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Back in the Bay Area==

Leung was the first Chinese American to pass the civil service examinations&lt;ref name="Berson1994"/&gt; and she was hired to work as an assistant to the matron at the [[United States Immigration Station, Angel Island|Angel Island Immigration Station]]. There she would work with Chinese immigrants who were detained for physical examinations and [[interrogation]] upon their arrival.

In 1912 Leung was the first Chinese woman to vote in a [[primary election]].&lt;ref name="LeeStefanowska1998"/&gt; After voting the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' called the vote "the last word in the modern movement for the complete enfranchisement of women...It was the latest achievement in the great American work of amalgamating and lifting up all the races of the earth."&lt;ref name="Berson1994"/&gt;

At Angel Island she would meet immigration inspector Charles Schulze. Intermarriage of Chinese and white Americans was illegal in California so the couple went to [[Vancouver, Washington]] to be legally married.&lt;ref name="LeeStefanowska1998"/&gt; They were married in October 1913.&lt;ref name="Berson1994"/&gt; They had to quit their government jobs after the marriage due to racial prejudice. Schulze went to work for the [[Southern Pacific Company]] as an "inspector of office machines", and then as a superintendent of service for the Columbia Gramaphone Company.&lt;ref&gt;Original business cards of Charles Schulze&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had four children.&lt;ref name="LeeStefanowska1998"/&gt; Schulze died in 1935 and Leung served as a bookkeeper at the [[San Francisco Chinese Hospital]] to support her family.&lt;ref name="Berson1994"/&gt; Leung went to work as a night-shift PBX operator at the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] telephone exchange.&lt;ref name="LeeStefanowska1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Berson1994"/&gt; She spent many years providing interpretation and social services to San Francisco's Chinatown residents. She passed at the approximate age of 85.&lt;ref name="LeeStefanowska1998"/&gt;

==Legacy==

In October 2011 the story of Tye Leung Schulze was told through a play starring actress Lily Tung.&lt;ref name="Play1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Lovelie Faustino | year=2011 | title=Lily Tung Crystal portrays first Chinese American woman vote | work=Daily Dose: 10/13/11 | publisher=[[AsianWeek]] | url=http://www.asianweek.com/2011/10/13/daily-dose-101311/ | accessdate=14 November 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018031434/http://www.asianweek.com/2011/10/13/daily-dose-101311/ | archivedate=18 October 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="80072">This article deals with the [[grammar]] of the [[Udmurt language]].

==Pronouns==
Udmurt [[pronoun]]s are inflected much in the same way that their referent nouns are. However, personal pronouns are only inflected in the grammatical cases and cannot be inflected in the locative cases.

===Personal pronouns===
Somewhat like in English, Udmurt [[personal pronoun]]s are used to refer to human beings only. However, the third person singular can be referred to ''it''. Udmurt personal pronouns only inflect in the grammatical cases and the approximative case. The nominative case of personal pronouns are listed in the following table:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="2" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Personal pronouns
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Udmurt !! English
|-
! colspan="2"  style="background:#efefef;" | Singular
|-
|мон ''(mon)'' || I
|-
|тон ''(ton)'' || you
|-
|со ''(so)'' || she or he or it
|-
! colspan="2" style="background:#efefef;" | Plural
|-
|ми ''(mi)'' || we
|-
|тӥ ''(ti)'' || you
|-
|соос ''(soos)'' || they
|}

===Reflexive pronouns===
Udmurt [[reflexive pronouns]] only inflect in the grammatical cases and the approximative case. The nominative case of reflexive pronouns are listed in the following table:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="2" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Reflexive pronouns
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Udmurt !! English
|-
! colspan="2"  style="background:#efefef;" | Singular
|-
| аслам ''(aslam)'' || me myself
|-
| аслад ''(aslad)'' || you yourself
|-
| аслаз ''(aslaz)'' || she herself/he himself/it itself
|-
! colspan="2" style="background:#efefef;" | Plural
|-
| асьмеос ''(as'meos)'' || we ourselves
|-
| асьтэос ''(as'teos)'' || you yourselves
|-
| асьсэос ''(as'seos)'' || they themselves
|}

===Interrogative pronouns===
Udmurt [[interrogative pronouns]] inflect in all cases. However, the inanimate interrogative pronouns 'what' in the locative cases have the base form ''кыт-''. The nominative case of interrogative pronouns are listed in the following table:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="2" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Interrogative pronouns (nominative case)
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |

|-

|-
! colspan="2" style="background:#efefef;" | Plural
|-
| маос ''(maos)'' || what
|-
| кинъëс ''(ki'nos)'' || who
|}

The following table shows Udmurt interrogative pronouns in all the cases:

| Prolative || – || – || кытӥ ''(kyti)'' || along where
|-
| Approximative || кинлань ''(kinlan')'' || towards whom || малань ''(malan')'' || towards where
|}

==Noun forms==
Udmurt does not distinguish gender in [[noun]]s or even in personal pronouns: 'со' = 'he' or 'she' depending on the referent.

===Cases===
Udmurt has fifteen noun [[Declension|cases]]: eight grammatical cases and seven locative cases. Notice that the word in a given locative case modifies the verb, not a noun. The locative cases can only be used with [[inanimate]] references with the exception of the approximative case.

Udmurt case endings affix directly to nouns quite regularly with the exception of a few lexemes of Uralic origin. These lexemes have stem changes when declining in the locative cases whose endings begin with a vowel:

===Plural===

There are two types of nominal plurals in Udmurt. One is the plural for nouns ''-ос/-ëс'' and the other is the plural for adjectives ''-эсь/-есь''.

====Nominal plural====
The noun is always in plural. In attributive plural phrases, the adjective is not required to be in the plural:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="2" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Attributive plural
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Udmurt !! English
|-
| чебер(есь) ''нылъ'''ëс''''' || (the) beautiful ''girls''
|}

The plural marker always comes before other endings (i.e. cases and possessive suffixes) in the morphological structure of plural nominal.

|-
! colspan="2" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Morphological order
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Udmurt !! English
|-
| ныл'''ъëс'''лы || to the girls
|-
| гурт'''ъëс'''азы || to/in their villages
|}

====Predicative plural====
As in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], if the subject is plural, the adjective is always plural when it functions as the sentence's [[Predicative expression|predicative]]:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="2" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Attributive plural

! Udmurt !! English
|-
| нылъëс ''чебер'''есь''''' || the girls are ''beautiful''
|-
| толъёс ''куз'''есь''''' || the winters are ''cold''
|}

====Following numerals====
Nouns are ordinarily in the singular when following [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]]. However, a living being as the sentence's subject may be in the plural. In this case, the predicate verb must be in congruency with the subject.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Udmurt !! English
|-
| Та гуртын ''витьтон куать корка'' || There are ''fifty-six houses'' in this village
|-
| Аудиториын ''дас студент'' пуке ~ Аудиториын ''дас студент'''ъëс''''' пук'''о''' || There are ''ten students'' sitting in the lecture hall
|}

===Possessive suffixes===

====Nominal possessive suffixes====
Udmurt [[possessive suffix]]es are added to the end of nouns either before or after a case ending. The possessive suffixes vary in the nominative and accusative cases and with case endings. The consonant of the second and third person plural depends on if the last [[phoneme]] of the word is [[voiced]] or [[unvoiced]].

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="3" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Nominative possessive suffix
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Suffix ending !! Udmurt !! English

| -е/-э || эш'''е''' || my friend
|-

|-
| -мы || эш'''мы''' || our friend
|-
| -ды/-ты || эш'''ты''' || your (pl) friend
|-
| -зы/-сы || эш'''сы''' || their friend
|}

Certain [[lexeme]]s of Finno-Ugric origin (especially those ending with a vowel or meaning an [[Inalienable possession|inalienable]] object) contain the vowel ''-ы-'' in the first, second and third person singular nominative possessive suffixes:

|-

|-
| -ыз || ки'''ыз''' || kätensä || his/her hand
|}

====Accusative possessive suffixes====
Accusative possessive suffixes are shown in the following table. The consonant of the second and third person singular and plural depends on if the last phoneme of the word is voiced or unvoiced.

|-

|-
| -мес || эш'''мес''' || our friend
|-
| -дэс/-тэс || эш'''тэс''' || your (pl) friend
|-
| -зэс/-сэс || эш'''сэс''' || their friend
|}

====Possessive suffixes with case endings, singular====
The morphological placement of possessive suffixes with other endings depends on the case. Possessive suffixes are the same as nominative suffixes after which the genitive, ablative, dative, abessive, adverbial and approximative cases agglutinates.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="4" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Possessive suffixes with case endings
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Case !! Udmurt (first person singular) !! English
|-
| nominative || гуртэ || my village
|-
| genitive || гурт'''э'''лэн || my village's/of my village
|-
| ablative || гурт'''э'''лэсь || from my village
|-
| dative || гурт'''э'''лы ||  for my village
|-
| abessive || гурт'''э'''тэк || without my village
|-
| adverbial || гурт'''э'''я || across my village
|-
| approximative || гурт'''э'''лань || towards my village
|}

The possessive suffix follows the instrumental, inessive, illative, elative egressive, terminative and prolative cases and the vowel reduces to ''ы'' in the singular persons. An ''м'', an old Uralic first person singular marker, appears in the first person singular. When adding a possessive suffix, the inessive and illative forms change to ''-а-'' and the elative form changes to ''-ысьт-''. The ''ы'' does not appear in the inessive, illative, terminative and prolative cases where the case ends with a vowel.

|}

====Possessive suffixes with case endings, plural====
As in the singular, possessive suffixes precede the genitive, ablative, dative, abessive, adverbial and approximative cases. However, the vowel of the singular persons reduce to ''ы'':

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="4" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Possessive suffixes with case endings
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Case !! Udmurt (first person singular) !! English
|-
| nominative || гуртъëс'''ы''' || my villages
|-
| genitive || гуртъëс'''ы'''лэн || my villages'/of my villages
|-
| ablative || гуртъëс'''ы'''лэсь || from my villages
|-
| dative || гуртъëс'''ы'''лы ||  for my villages
|-
| abessive || гуртъëс'''ы'''тэк || without my villages
|-
| adverbial || гуртъëс'''ы'''я || across my villages
|-
| approximative || гуртъëс'''ы'''лань || towards my villages
|}

As in the singular, possessive suffixes follow the instrumental, inessive, illative, elative, egressive, terminative and prolative cases. The suffix forms follow the same structure as in the singular. The same exceptions appear in the plural as in the singular with the added exception of the instrumental ''э/е'' reducing to ''ы'' and the prolative ''э/е'' not used.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="4" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Possessive suffixes with case endings
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Case !! Udmurt (first person singular) !! English
|-
| instrumental || гуртъëсын'''ым''' || by means of my villages
|-
| inessive || гуртъëса'''м''' || in my villages
|-
| illative || гуртъëса'''м''' || to my villages
|-
| elative || гуртъëсысьты'''м''' ||  from my villages
|-
| egressive || гуртъëсысен'''ым''' || starting from my villages
|-
| terminative 	|| гуртъëсозя'''м''' || ending up at my villages
|-
| prolative || гуртъëстӥ'''м''' || along my villages
|}

Some words can be used as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs without a change in form. For example,  '''чылкыт''' ''{{lang|udm-Latn|čilkit}}'' means "cleanliness", "clean", and "clearly".

The third person singular possessive suffix also acts as a definite article: удмурт кыл(ыз) чебер udmurt kyliz č´eber ("the Udmurt language is nice" – literally "Udmurt language's nice").

==Adjectives==
There is no congruency between [[adjectives]] and [[nouns]] in neutral Udmurt [[noun phrases]], i.e. there is no adjective declension as in the inessive noun phrase ''бадӟым гурт'''ын''''', 'in a large/big village' (cf. [[Finnish grammar|Finnish]] inessive phrase ''iso'''ssa''' kylä'''ssä''''' 'in a large/big village', in which ''iso'' 'big/large' is inflected according to the head noun). However, as stated earlier, Udmurt adjectives in neutral attributive (non-predicative) noun phrases may have a [[Udmurt grammar#Plural|plural marker]] when the noun is pluralised.

===Determinative===
Udmurt does have an emphasising [[determinative]] suffix. Its function is to place emphasis on the features of the referent, defining and separating it from a group of other similar referents. The third person singular possessive suffix ''-ез/-эз'' and ''-из'' and plural ''-ыз'' acts as the determinative suffix. The determinative adjective conjugates as in the third person singular or plural and the noun conjugates without any other marker.

|-
| elative || бадӟым(есь) гуртъëсысь || from a big village || бадӟым'''ъëсысьтыз''' гуртъëсысь || from the (specifically) big village
|}

===Comparative===
[[Comparison (grammar)|Comparative]] is used when two referents are compared to each other but the subject of comparison does not necessarily need to be expressed.

The comparative suffix in Udmurt is ''-гес''. The subject of comparison can be expressed either in the ablative case or with the [[postposition]] ''сярысь'' structure.  If the subject of comparison it is shown the comparative suffix can be left out.

! Udmurt !! English
|-
| Скал ыжлэсь бадӟым(гес) ~ Скал ыж сярысь бадӟым(гес) || A cow is larger than a sheep
|}

===Superlative===
There is no [[superlative]] suffix in Udmurt. Superlative is expressed with the [[Russian language|Russian]] [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''самой'' or indefinitive expressions ''ваньмызлэсь'', ''котькинлэсь'' or ''котьмалэсь''.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="4" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Superlative
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Udmurt !! English
|-

|-
| самой ~ ваньмызлэсь ~ котькинлэсь ~ котьмалэсь выль || newest (of them all)
|-
| самой ~ ваньмызлэсь ~ котькинлэсь ~ котьмалэсь дун  || cleanest (of them all)
|}

==Postpositions==
Udmurt makes use of [[postpositions]] rather than [[prepositions]]. A large percentage of the stems of Udmurt postpositions have a locative meaning and can conjugate in the local cases. For example, ''выл'' means 'top' and also 'surface' and can inflect in all the locative cases: (inessive) ''вылын'', (elative) ''вылысь'', (illative) ''вылэ'', (prolative) ''вылтӥ'', (eggressive) ''вылысен'', (termanitive) ''вылозь'' and (approximative) ''выллань''.

However less than the seven locative cases are included in [[paradigm]] inflection of many of the postpositions. The paradigm usually consists of the inessive, elative and illative cases. Like nominals of foreign Uralic origin, some postpositions have a consonant in their stem. such as ''вис(к-)'', 'between'.

Some common postpositions are:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="4" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Postpositions
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Stem !! Example (inessive) !! English
|-
| азь || азь'''ын''' || in front of
|-
| выл || выл'''ын''' || on top of
|-
| дор || дор'''ын''' || next to, at
|-
| бӧрсьы || бӧрсьы'''ын''' || in back of/behind
|-
| пум || пум'''ын''' || at the end of
|-
| ул || ул'''ын''' || under
|}

The illative case can vary between ''-э/-е'' and ''-ы''. The illative form of the postposition ''пал'' 'side' is ''пала'' 'to the side of'.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="4" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Postpositions
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |

|-

|-
| ул || улы'''э''' || under
|-
! colspan="4" style="background:#efefef" | ''-ы''

|-
| шор || шор'''ы''' || to the centre of
|-
| сьӧр || сьӧр'''ы''' || to the behind of
|-
| вис(к-) || виск'''ы''' || between
|}

There is also a small group of non-inflecting postpositions in addition to those inflecting in the locative cases (cf. Finnish ''kanssa'' "with (a person)" that always takes the genitive case: ''ystävän kanssa'' "with a friend"). A few examples of these are:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Postposition !! English
|-
| артэ || next to
|-
| бере || after

|-
| кузя || along
|-
| сямен || in the way of/ -wise
|-
| сярысь || about
|-
| ӵоже || within
|-
| ӵош || together
|}

Most of the nouns in Udmurt postposition phrases are inflected in the nominative but there are a few postpositions that require the noun to be in the dative, ablative or instrumental cases:

|-
| со'''ин''' валче || because of it
|-
| мон'''эн''' артэ || next to me
|}

==Verbs==
Udmurt [[verb]]s are divided into two groups or two [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]], both having the [[infinitive]] marker ''-ны''. The conjugation I type verb is structured with ''ы'' as in ''мын'''ыны''''', 'to go'. The conjugation II type verb features an ''-а-'' in the infinitive as in ''уж'''аны''''', 'to work'. The conjugation I verb can also have two stems, a full stem as in ''мыны-'' and a short stem as in ''мын-''.

There are three [[verbal moods]] in Udmurt: [[indicative]], [[Conditional mood|conditional]] and [[Imperative mood|imperative]]. There is also an [[optative]] mood used in certain [[dialects]]. The indicative mood has four tenses: present, future, and two past tenses. In addition there are four past tense structures which include [[auxiliary verbs]]. Verbs are negated by use of an auxiliary [[negative verb]] that conjugates with personal endings. Separate personal pronouns are not required in [[verb phrase]]s.

The basic verbal personal markers in Udmurt are (with some exceptions):

===Past tense===
The conventionally used designations ''[[preterite]]'' and ''[[perfect]]'' are used with denotations which are divergent from their usual meanings in the grammar of other languages.

====Preterite I====
The first preterite can be compared with the [[simple past]] in English. Preterite I is marked with ''ӥ/и'' in conjugation I. There is no past tense marker in conjugation II verbs with the exception of ''й'' in the first person singular.

|-
| 3rd || тод'''ӥзы'''  || they knew || кырӟа'''зы'''  || they sang
|}

The negative preterite I is formed by the auxiliary ''ӧ-'' negative verb and the stem of the main verb in singular persons. The plural persons are marked either with ''-э/-е'' (conjugation I) or ''-лэ'' (conjugation II)

The negative verb conjugates with the ending ''-й'' in first person singular. Third person singular and third person plural have the ending ''-з'' and the remaining are as in present negative.

|-
| 3rd || '''ӧз''' тод'''э'''  || they did not know || '''ӧз''' кырӟа'''лэ'''  || they did not sing
|}

====Preterite II====
The second preterite is a past tense with an [[evidentiality]] distinction. It can be compared to the English [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]] in which the speaker did not personally observe the past event. The preterite II is marked with ''(э)м/(е)м'', which is historically related to the [[Finnish grammar#Third infinitive|third infinitive]] in [[Finnish language|Finnish]].

In addition to the normal personal endings, the present indicative marker ''-(ӥ)ськ-/-(и)ськ-'' is featured in first persons and a [[frequentive]] verbal marker ''-лля-'' is present in the second and third person plural. There is no personal ending in the third person singular and sometimes featured in the third person plural.

|-
| 3rd || тод'''ӥллям(зы)'''  || they have evidently known || кырӟа'''ллям(зы)'''  || they evidently sung
|}

The negative preterite II is formed either by including the auxiliary copular negative verb ''ӧвӧл'' 'is not' or with the negation marker ''-мтэ-''.

|}

====Auxiliary past tenses====
There are four past tenses in Udmurt which use a preterite form of the main verb and a preterite form of the [[auxiliary verb]] 'to be'.

=====Pluperfect I=====
The Udmurt [[pluperfect]] makes use of the preterite I main verb and the auxiliary ''вал'', 'was' in third person singular, also in simple past. The pluperfect I tense expresses a process of action that has happened in the (distant) past.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-

|-
| 3rd || тодӥзы вал || they had known || кырӟазы вал  || they had sung
|}

The negative Pluperfect I is formed by the negative preterite I negative plus the auxiliary ''вал''.

|-

|-
| 3rd || ӧз тодэ вал || they had not known || ӧз кырӟалэ вал || they had not sung
|}

=====Pluperfect II=====
There are two structures of the pluperfect II tense. One uses the preterite II third person singular form of the main verb inflected with a personal possessive suffix and the auxiliary ''вал''. The other is the preterite II of the main verb (with normal personal inflection) and the preterite I form of the 'to' be verb ''вылэм''. The pluperfect II tense expresses the result of an action that has been completed, but no one had seen.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-

|-
| 1st || тодэме вал || тодӥськем вылэм || I had evidently known
|-
| 2nd || тодэмед вал || тодэмед вылэм || you had evidently known
|-
| 3rd || тодэм вал ||тодэм вылэм || he/she had evidently known
|-
! colspan="4" style="background:#efefef" | Plural
|-

| 2nd || тодэмды вал || тодӥллямды вылэм || you had evidently known
|-
| 3rd || тодэмзы вал || тодӥллям(зы) вылэм || they had evidently known
|}

The negative pluperfect II is formed either by with the preterite II third person singular of the main verb in the negative (marked with ''-мтэ-'') with a personal possessive suffix and the auxiliary verb ''вал'' (pluperfect II a) or with the negative preterite II of the main verb marked with ''-мтэ-'' with the preterite II auxiliary verb ''вылэм''.

|-
| 3rd || тодымтэзы вал || тодӥллямтэ вылэм || they had evidently not known
|}

=====Durative preterite=====
The durative preterite in Udmurt can be compared to the [[past progressive]] in English "was doing". Its function can be described as expressing a process in the past. The structure is the present tense of the main verb with either preterite of the auxiliary verb. The structure of the negative durative preterite is the negative present tense of the main verb with either preterite of the auxiliary verb.

|-
| 3rd || кырӟало вал/вылэм || they were singing || уг кырӟало вал/вылэм  || they were not singing
|}

=====Frequentative preterite=====
The [[frequentative]] preterite in Udmurt expresses a repeated action in the past. The structure is the future tense of the main verb with either preterite of the auxiliary verb. The structure of the negative frequentative preterite is the negative future tense of the main verb with either preterite of the auxiliary verb.

|-
| 3rd || кырӟалозы вал/вылэм || they sang (always) || уз кырӟалэ вал/вылэм  || they did not sing (always)
|}

===Passive voice===
Udmurt does not have a separate affix to express a [[passive voice]]. The plural third person of the verb is used as a personal form to express an unknown, non-determinative actor.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="4" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Passive voice

|-
| Соос ӟуч сямен уг верасько || They do not speak Russian || Татын ӟуч сямен уг верасько || Russian is not spoken here
|}

===Moods===

====Conditional====
The [[conditional mood]] expresses an unrealistic action which the speaker considers to be supposed, possible or hopeful. The conditional marker is ''-сал'' and is attached to the stem of the verb (i.e. full stem of conjugation I verbs) along with personal endings. The third person singular, however, can function without a personal ending. The first person singular preterite I negative verb ''ӧй'' is used in the negative conditional.

|-
| 3rd || кары'''салзы''' || they would do || ӧй карысалзы || they would not do
|}

====Imperative====
The stem of the verb is used for the second person singular [[Imperative mood|imperative]] in Udmurt. If the stem of a conjugation I verb ends in one consonant or is one [[syllable]] and ends in a vowel, the short stem is the imperative. If the stem of a conjugation I verb ends in two consonants, the full stem is used.

The second person plural infinitive is marked with ''-е(лэ)/-э(лэ)'' in conjugation I verbs and ''-лэ'' in conjugation I verbs.

The imperative negative auxiliary is ''эн'' which precedes the infinitive form.

====Optative====
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

===Modals===
Udmurt makes use of the [[morphosyntactic]] structure of inflected nominals and verbs with an auxiliary for [[Linguistic modality|modal]] expressions.

To express ability, the verb ''луынын'', 'to be' is inflected in the third person singular (in all tenses) with the subject in the genitive case. The verb to which the subject directs ability is inflected with the [[past participle]] ''(э)м/(е)м'' (preterite II, third person singular) with a personal possessive suffix.

|-
| Кышномуртлэн магазинэ мын'''емез''' ӧз луы || The woman could not go to the store || "woman's to the store her went was not"
|}

====Desiderative====
The [[desiderative]] modal expresses desire. The verb ''потынын'', 'to want' is inflected in the third person singular (in all tenses) with the subject in the genitive case. The verb to which the subject directs the desire is inflected with the [[past participle]] ''(э)м/(е)м'' (preterite II, third person singular) with a personal possessive suffix.

|}

===Participles===
Udmurt verbs have past, present and future [[participles]]. Participles can be used in different ways than ordinary adjectives. In addition to affirmative participles, Udmurt also has [[caritive]] participles.

====Present====
The present participle is ''-(ӥ)сь/-(и)сь''. It is a participle which expresses continuous action. It is affixed to short stems in conjugation I verbs. The present participle caritive is ''-(ӥ)сьтэм/-(и)сьтэм''

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Affirmative !! English !! Caritive !! English
|-
| лыдӟ'''ись''' ныл || a girl that reads || лыдӟ'''исьтэм''' ныл || a girl that does not read
|-
| кырӟ'''ась''' пи || a boy that sings || кырӟ'''асьтэм''' пи || a boy that does not sing
|}

In addition to functioning as regular attributive participles, the present participle also functions as a nominalising [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivational suffix]].

|-
| кырӟ'''ась''' ныл || a girl that sings || кырӟ'''ась''' || singer
|}

====Past====
The [[past participle]] is ''-(э)м/-(е)м''. It is an attributive participle which expresses completed action. It is affixed to short stems in conjugation I verbs. The past participle caritive is ''-(э)мтэ/-(е)мтэ''.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Affirmative !! English !! Caritive !! English
|-

|-
| лыӟ'''ем''' книга || a book that has been read || лыӟ'''емтэ''' книга || a book that has not been read
|}

The past participle can also be inflected with the inessive ending ''-(э)мын/-(е)мын''. This is a [[Predicative verb|predicative]] participle which expresses completed action.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |

|-
| Куно лыкт'''эмын'''.  || The guest has arrived.
|-
| Писпу погра'''мын'''.  || The tree had fallen.
|-
| Книга лыӟ'''емын'''.  || The book has been read.
|}

====Future====
The modal-future participle is ''-(о)но''. It is affixed to short stems in conjugation I verbs. The future participle caritive is ''-(о)нтэм'' and expresses that which is unable to be done.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Affirmative !! English !! Caritive !! English

|-
| лыӟ'''оно''' книга || a book that will be read || лыӟ'''онтэм''' книга || a book that is not able to be read
|}

There is also a modal participle similar to [[gerunds]] in function. It expresses the ability to do some action or that it is possible to do the action. The marker is ''-мон'' and it is affixed to short stems in conjugation I verbs.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Udmurt !! English
|-
| лэсьты'''мон''' уж || a job (work) which is possible to do
|-
| улы'''мон''' корка || a house in which one can live
|}

===Gerunds===
There are four  [[gerunds]] in Udmurt, one being a caritive. that are affixed to the verb's full stem. One gerund, which also has a caritive, is formed by the past participle ''(э)м/(е)м'' (preterite II, third person singular) with the instrumental or elative case.

The "basic" ''-са'' gerund (and its caritive ''-тэк'') can be compared to the English [[present active participle]] ''-ing'' and Finnish [[Finnish grammar#Second infinitive|second]] or [[Finnish grammar#Third infinitive|third infinitives]], however having more functions. They can express a way of doing something, a reason for the action or a certain condition.

The temporal ''-ку'' gerund (''-кы'' in southern dialects) expresses action or state of being which happens simultaneously with the action of the main verb of the clause.

The fourth gerund is ''-тозь'' which can express an action or an event that lasts to the starting or ending limit of the action expressed by the predicate verb of the sentence. The gerund also expresses the structure "instead of". In addition, possessive suffixes can be affixed after the ''-тозь'' gerund.

|-
| Вуы'''тозям''' та ужез быдэсты ~ Mон вуы'''тозь''', та ужез быдэсты || Finish this work by the time I get there (lit. until the time when I arrive)
|}

The past participle gerund is inflected with either the instrumental ''-(э)мен/-(е)мен'' (caritive ''-мтэен'') or elative ''-(э)мысь/-(е)мысь'' (caritive ''-мтэысь'') case, both having the basic same meaning of "because". In [[literary language|literary]] Udmurt, the gerund in the instrumental case is preferred. However, the gerund in the eleative case is used with some verbs such as ''дугдыны'' 'to cease/stop'.

Personal possessive suffixes can also be affixed to ''-(э)м-/-(е)ме-'' gerunds:

|}

===Interrogative suffix===
If there are no [[interrogative]] (question) words (who, what, when etc.), an interrogative phrase is formed by the suffix ''-а''. The interrogative suffix is affixed to the constituent to which the question is concerned. The suffix's placement can also vary according to dialect. Both southern and northern dialect forms are used in literary Udmurt.

==Word formation==
There are a few main derivational suffixes in Udmurt [[word formation]].

===Nouns===
Udmurt has the [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] deverbalising nominal suffix ''-(о)н/-(ë)н''. ''-(о)н/-(ë)н'' is affixed to the short stem of conjugation I verbs and ''-н'' affixes directly to the stem of conjugation II verbs The function of this suffix is quite diverse. With this deverbalising affix, the nominal usually:

1. expresses the action (deverbalised noun) set out by the base verb:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
! Verb !! English !! Noun !! English
|-
| сылыны || to stand || сыл'''он''' || (a) standing
|-
| ӝуаны || to burn || ӝуа'''н''' || (a) burning
|-
| куасьмыны || to dry || куасьм'''он''' || (a) drying
|}

2. expresses the result of action:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
! Verb !! English !! Noun !! English
|-
| вормыны || to win || ворм'''он''' || a victory
|-
| кырӟаны || to sing || кырӟа'''н''' || a song
|}

3. expresses an instrument or tool denoted by an action:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
! Verb !! English !! Noun !! English
|-
| портыны || to drill || порт'''он''' || a drill
|}

4. expresses the focus of action:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
! Verb !! English !! Noun !! English
|-
| сиыны || to eat || си'''ëн''' || food
|-
| юыны || to drink || ю'''он''' || drink
|}

Most of these derivations have both abstract and concrete meanings. The derivation can expresses both the action set out by the base verb or result or instrument:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
! Verb !! English !! Noun !! English
|-
| пукыны || to sit || пуко'''ны''' || (a) sitting, a seat, a chair
|-
| висьыны || to become ill || вис'''ëн''' || getting ill, a disease, an illness
|-
| шудыны || to play || шуд'''он''' || playing, play, a toy, a plaything
|}

Deverbalised nominal derivations can function as [[qualifiers]] of [[collocations]], such as ''лыдӟ'''он''' книга'' 'reader, digest' or ''ю'''он''' ву'' 'drinking water'.

===Adjectives===
Udmurt has the denominalising [[adjective|adjectival]] suffixes ''-о/-ë'' and carritive ''-тэм''. The adjectives formed by the suffix ''-о/-ë'' express the condition of a quality, feature or phenomenon of the base word or possession of the referent. The adjectives formed by the suffix ''-тэм'' express the lack of quality, feature, phenomenon or referent. This suffix can be compared to the [[prefix]] ''un-'' or suffix ''-less'' in English.

|-
| нылпи || child || нылпи'''тэм''' семъя || a childless family (a family with no children)
|}

Adjectives formed by the ''-ӧ'' suffix can also have a qualifier:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
! Nominal !! English !! Example !! English
|-
| чагыр син || blue eye || чагыр син'''о''' ныл || a blue-eyed girl
|-
| кузь ки || long  arm || кузь ки'''ë''' адями || a long-armed person (a person with long arms)
|}

Udmurt also has moderative adjectival suffixes (''-алэс'', ''-мыт'' and ''-пыр(ъем)'') which express a somewhat large, but not complete, amount of quality of an adjective base, usually a colour or flavour.  They can be compared to the English suffix ''-ish''. The suffix ''-мыт'' does not normally associate with flavour, but Southern dialect variant ''-пыр(ъем)'' does.

|-
| курыт || bitter || курыт'''алэс''' ~ курыт'''пыръем''' кияр || a rather bitter cucumber
|}

===Verbs===
In Udmurt grammar, the [[lexical aspect]] (aktionsart) of verbs is called verbal aspect. Udmurt verbs can be divided into two categories: [[momentane|momentane verbs]] and [[frequentative|frequentative verbs]]. The [[Transitive verb|transitivity]] or of a verb mainly relies on if the verb is frequentative or not.

In Udmurt [[word formation]], verbs can be derived by frequentative or [[causative]] deverbalising suffixes.

====Momentane====

The momentane aspect of Udmurt verbs expresses action (state of being or process) that happens only once. There is no transparent base momentane marker (cf. Finnish momentane verbs). For example, ''лыӟыны'' 'to read (once)'. However a causative ''-т-'' denotes momentanity and those verbs can be derived into frequentative verbs.

====Frequentative====

The frequentative aspect expresses that the action (state of being or process) does not happen just one time. The action is continuous or frequent. There are various frequentative markers, usually containing an ''л'', for example ''лыӟы'''лы'''ны'' 'to read (frequently/often)'. The frequentative aspect, however, does not denote continuous repetitiveness as in e.g.some Finnish frequentative derivations.

The frequentative deverbalising affixes in Udmurt are ''-лы-'' (conjugation I), ''-лля-'' (conjugation II) (both historically related to the Finnish frequentative derivational suffix ''[[Frequentative#Finnish|-ele-]]'') and ''-а-/-я-'' (conjugation I) which precede the infinitive marker ''ны''.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
! colspan="5" style="background:#cfcfcf;" | Frequentative derivation
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Base !! English !! !! Derivation !! English
|-
! colspan="5" style="background:#efefef" | ''-л-''
|-
| лыдӟыны || to read || → || лыдӟы'''лы'''ны || to read (often)
|-
| лыктыны || to come || → || лыкты'''лы'''ны || to come (often)
|-
| юыны || to drink || → || юы'''л'''ыны || to drink (often)
|-
! colspan="5" style="background:#efefef" | ''-лля-''
|-
| ужаны || to work || → || ужа'''лля'''ны || to work (often)
|-
| кораны || to chop || → || кора'''лля'''ны || to chop (often)
|-
! colspan="5" style="background:#efefef" | ''-а-/-я-''
|-
| пырыны || to step inside || → || пыр'''а'''ны || to step inside (often)
|-
| потыны || to step outside || → || пот'''а'''ны || to step outside (often)
|-
| гожтыны || to write || → || гожт'''ъя'''ыны || to write (often)
|}

Some verbal derivations, that follow the pattern ''потыны'' → ''пот'''а'''ны'', have parallel frequentative derivations, and ''-лля-'' can be affixed to an already frequentatised derivation:

''тубыны'' 'to rise' → ''тубы'''лы'''ны'' 'to rise (often)'

''тубыны'' 'to rise' → ''туб'''а'''ны'' → ''туба'''лля'''ны'' 'to rise (often)'

Another frequentative verb affix is ''-иськы-/-ӥськы-'', which is historically related to the Finnish frequentative derivational suffix ''[[Frequentative#Finnish|-skele-]]''. ''-иськы-/-ӥськы-'' frequentative verbs can be considered different from the above-mentioned derivations. ''-иськы-/-ӥськы-'' verbs do not semantically denote frequency in the same way; their "ofteness" is related to objective or non-objective relation. For example, the verb ''лыдӟыны'' ('to read') requires an object and the verb ''лыдӟ'''иськ'''ыны'' does not.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Udmurt !! English
|-
| мон лыдӟ'''иськы'''ны яратӥсько || I like to read (generally)
|-
| мон книга лыдӟӥсько || I am reading a book
|}

==Syntax==
Udmurt is an [[SOV language]].

===Nominal sentence===

The [[copula (linguistics)|copula]]r verb ('''вань''' ''{{lang|udm-Latn|vań}}'', – "to be") is omitted if the sentence is in the present tense: '''туннэ кыӵе нунал?''' ''{{lang|udm-Latn|tunne kiče nunal?}}'' ("What day is it today?"). If the sentence expresses possession, the ''{{lang|udm-Latn|vań}}'' can be part of the predicate: '''тӥ палан нюлэсъёс вань-а''?''' ''{{lang|udm-Latn|ti palan ńulesjos vań-a?}}'' ("At you (plur.), are there forests?")

===Existential sentences===
These are sentences which introduce a new subject – they often begin with 'there is' or 'there are' in English.
{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Udmurt !! English !! Literal translation
|-
| Финляндиын трос нюлэсъëс || there are many forests in Finland || "in Finland many forests (is/are)"
|}

===Possessive sentences===
As in most Uralic languages, ownership in Udmurt is expressed by inflection and sentence structure, rather than with a separate verb 'have'. The owner of the object and the possessed object are both inflected with a possessive suffix and used with the copula verb to express ownership.

{| class="wikitable" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2"
|- style="background:#dfdfdf;" |
! Udmurt !! English !! Literal translation
|-
| мынам книгае вань|| I have a book || "mine my book is"

|-
| мынам книгае вал || I had a book || "mine my book was"
|-
| мынам книгае ӧй вал || I did not have a book || "mine my book was not"
|}

A '''unicase''' or '''unicameral''' [[alphabet]] is one that has no [[Letter case|case]] for its letters.  [[Kannada alphabet|Kannada]], [[Tamil alphabet|Tamil]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Old_Hungarian_script|Old Hungarian]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2018|reason=Wikipedia articles on [[Letter case]] and Unicase differ in their view of whether [[Old Hungarian alphabet]] actually has letter case distinction.}} [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Georgian alphabet|Georgian]], and [[Hangul]] are unicase alphabets, while (modern) [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]] are ''bicameral'', as they have two cases for each letter, e.g., B/b, Β/β, Б/б, Բ/բ. Individual characters can also be called unicameral if they are used as letters with a generally bicameral alphabet but have only one form for both cases; for example, [[ʻokina]] ('''{{okina}}'''), used in Polynesian languages, and [[glottal stop (letter)|glottal stop]] ('''ʔ''') as used in [[Nootka language|Nuu-chah-nuulth]].

All alphabets with case were once unicase.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Latin, for example, used to be written with a unicase alphabet in [[Roman Empire|imperial Roman times]]; it was only later that scribes developed new sets of symbols for running text, which became the lower case of the Latin alphabet, while the letterforms of Ancient Rome came to be called capitals or upper case.

The [[Georgian alphabet]], on the other hand, has developed in the other direction: in the medieval period, Georgian also had two sets of letters available for bicameral writing, but the use of two cases later gave way to a unicameral system. The ecclesiastical form of the Georgian alphabet, [[Khutsuri]], had an upper case called [[Asomtavruli]] (like the Ancient Roman capitals) and a lower case called [[Nuskhuri]] (like the medieval Latin scribal forms). Out of Nuskhuri came a secular alphabet called [[Georgian alphabet#Mkhedruli|Mkhedruli]], which is the unicase Georgian alphabet in use today.

A unicase version of the Latin alphabet was proposed by Michael Mann and David Dalby in 1982 as a variation of the Niamey [[African reference alphabet#1982 version|African Reference Alphabet]]. This version has apparently never been actively used. Another example of unicase Latin alphabet is the [[Initial Teaching Alphabet]]. Occasionally some fonts use unicase designs to create an unusual effect; this was particularly popular in the 1960s.

The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] only uses lowercase Latin (and Greek) letters and some scaled upper-case letters ([[small caps]]), effectively making it a unicase alphabet, although it is not used for actual writing of any language.
