==Life and career==
Harper attributes her initial interest in practicing veganism to the influence of the work of [[Dick Gregory]] in connecting diet to the liberation struggle of marginalized groups, and to [[Afrocentric]], [[raw foodism|raw foodist]] [[Queen Afua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=A. Breeze Harper|title=Sistah Vegan: Black Female Vegans Speak on Food, Identity, Health and Society|url=https://lanternbooks.presswarehouse.com/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=235010|date=March 1, 2009|accessdate=October 25, 2016|publisher=[[Lantern Books]]|isbn=978-1590561454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Harper's master's thesis at [[Harvard Extension School]], ''Cyberterritories of Whiteness: Language, 'Colorblind' Utopias, and 'Sistah Vegan' Consciousness'', won the Dean's Prize for Outstanding A.L.M. Thesis in Educational Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extension School awards|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/06/extension-school-awards/|website=Harvard Gazette|publisher=[[Harvard University]]|accessdate=June 10, 2016|date=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Harper's PhD dissertation for the [[University of California, Davis]] contrasted the framing of ethical veganism by [[neoliberal]] white, [[Afrocentric]], and [[decolonization|decolonial]] organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Amie Louise|title=Vegan Consciousness and the Commodity Chain: On the Neoliberal, Afrocentric,  and Decolonial Politics of "Cruelty - Free"|date=2013|url=http://gradworks.umi.com/35/65/3565515.html|website=[[ProQuest]]|accessdate=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Harper organized a conference, ''The Vegan Praxis of Black Lives Matters'', to discuss [[intersectional]] issues concerning veganism and the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Plaid|first1=Andrea|title=Vegan Praxis, Black Lives Matter, and Water Rationing: A Conversation with Dr. A.

Harper was the [[Humane Party]]'s vice-presidential nominee for the [[2016 U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breaking: Humane Party announces Dr. Breeze Harper as Vice Presidential nominee|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_-r8xkeGc0|website=The Onion Knight Show|accessdate=June 10, 2016|date=June 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abdul Hafeez Pirzada''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq| عبدالحفیظ  پیرزادہ}}}}; 24 February 1935 – 1 September 2015) was a Pakistani lawyer, legal theorist, and politician, who served variously as [[Minister of Information and Broadcasting (Pakistan)|Minister for Information]], [[Minister for Law, Justice and Human Rights (Pakistan)|Minister for Law]], [[Pakistan Minister of Finance|Minister for Finance]], and [[Minister for Education (Pakistan)|Minister for Education]] under [[President of Pakistan|President]] and later [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] from 1971 to 1977. As Law Minister, he is credited as a principal draftsman of the [[Constitution of Pakistan]], passed in 1973.

Trained as a barrister at [[Lincoln's Inn]], Pirzada was a founding member of the [[Pakistan People's Party]]. He was elected to the [[Pakistan National Assembly|National Assembly]] in the [[Pakistani general election, 1970|elections of 1970]], holding several ministerial portfolios in the Bhutto government. After the [[Operation Fair Play|government was deposed]] by General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] in 1977, Pirzada unsuccessfully assisted with Bhutto's defence in his [[criminal trial]] for murder. He briefly led the PPP before being imprisoned by the Zia regime, eventually leaving the party over differences with [[Benazir Bhutto]], and retiring from politics.

Returning to [[Private practice of law|private practice]], Pirzada rose to [[Advocate (Pakistan)#Senior Advocate Supreme Court|Senior Advocate of the Supreme Court]], becoming one of the country's leading lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Regional/Islamabad/09-Jun-2011/Govt-on-collision-course-with-SC |title=Govt on collision course with SC |date=9 June 2011 |work=The Nation |accessdate=3 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927165946/http://nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Regional/Islamabad/09-Jun-2011/Govt-on-collision-course-with-SC |archivedate=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He died of medical complications in [[Royal Berkshire Hospital]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], on 1 September 2015. He is cited as the 'Father of the Pakistani Constitution'.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mansoor|first1=Hasan|title=Profile: Abdul Hafeez Pirzada — a lawyer par excellence|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1204625|website=DAWN.com|publisher=Dawn News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and family==
Born in [[Sukkur]], [[Sindh]], [[British India]], Abdul Hafeez Pirzada belonged to a prominent [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] family, the son of former [[Chief Minister of Sindh|Chief Minister]] of [[Sindh]] Pirzada Abdus Sattar. His family remains active in politics: his brother Abdul Mujeeb is a member of the [[Pakistan Muslim League (F)]].

Pirzada obtained his LLB degree from [[Karachi University]], before gaining his LLM from [[Sindh University]]. He was also awarded an MSc. in [[Political Science]] from the university, after focusing his thesis on the [[Soviet Union]] and the rise of [[communism]]. He then trained as a barrister at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in [[London]], as his father and grandfather had.

Pirzada began his legal career at the [[Sindh High Court]], known then as the [[West Pakistan]] High Court. He first met fellow lawyer [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] when both were associates at Dingomal Ramchandani's law chambers in Karachi.

==PPP co-founder and federal minister==
Pirzada was one of 30 members that co-founded the [[Pakistan People's Party]] on 30 November 1967, led by Bhutto. As Bhutto's legal counsel in cases instituted by the military regime of [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]], Pirzada successfully defended the cases, and rose to play a greater role in the party.

In the [[Pakistani general election, 1970|general elections of 1970]], Pirzada was elected a Member of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] from [[Malir]], polling 64,000 votes.&lt;ref name="profile" /&gt; After Bhutto was handed the presidency in 1971, he sacked incumbent [[Minister of Information and Broadcasting (Pakistan)|Minister for Information]] Roedad Khan, appointing Pirzada instead. Pirzada also gained the Ministry of Education a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Father of the Constitution===
In 1973, Pirzada assumed the control of the Ministry of Law and Justice, after [[Mahmud Ali Kasuri]] resigned from the post over differences with Bhutto. Pirzada played an integral role in the drafting, and ultimate passing of the [[Constitution of Pakistan|Constitution of 1973]].

===Government negotiation team member===
In 1977, Pirzada was made Finance Minister. Elected an MNA again in 1977, Pirzada was a key member of the three-member government team that negotiated, unsuccessfully, a deal with the PNA opposition grouping. During that time, he was the [[Finance Minister of Pakistan]] for a little over three months, before the PPP-led government was overthrown by military coup by (see [[Operation Fair Play|''Fair Play'']]) [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|General Zia-ul-Haq]], then-[[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]].&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"&gt;{{Cite web

==Coup d'état and arrest ==
On 17 September 1977, Pirzada, along with Dr. Hassan and Bhutto, was arrested by the [[Military Police]], but was released in 1978.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; Upon his release, Pirzada filed a petition in the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan|Supreme Court]] requesting to review the petition.  He then also filed a petition for the release of Dr. [[Mubashir Hassan]] but the petition was denied as the Military Police were holding Dr. Hassan on unknown criminal charges.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt;

===Fighting Bhutto's case===
On 24 February, the Supreme Court denied the request of review, and so the court upheld its original decision.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; Pirzada then attempted to attain a commutation of Bhutto's sentence on the basis of split decision.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; This time, the Court decided to hear the arguments.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; On 28 February, the Army banned all the college text books of Dr. Hassan and forcefully lifted the books from major bookstores.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; On 12 March, the Supreme Court started to review the petition, and did so for the next 12 days.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; On 24 March, Pirzada informed Bhutto in jail that the President of Pakistan was able to change a death sentence into one of life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; Undaunted, Pirzada filed a petition to President General Zia-ul-Haq, who was serving at the time as Chief Martial Law Administrator.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; Pirzada asked the President to use "Section 45 of the Constitution", to commute the sentence to one of life imprisonment.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; However, General Zia-ul-Haq denied the application, saying the application had gone missing.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; Pirzada immediately went to meet Bhutto in his cell where he notified Bhutto about the application's status. After that, Pirzada held a press conference and told the media that Bhutto was prepared for death and would not file another application for mercy.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt;

==Pro-democracy activism==
On 1 October 1982, Pirzada was arrested for demonstrating against [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization]], where he also demanded the citizen basic rights.&lt;ref name="Fakhar Zaman and Pakistan Peoples Party's Media Research Cell Directorate"/&gt; Following the ouster of the PPP Government and the imposition of martial law by General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]], Pirzada developed differences with [[Nusrat Bhutto|Nusrat]] and [[Benazir Bhutto]]. During the military rule in Pakistan he remained in exile in the United Kingdom.

==Return to private practice==
On his return to [[Pakistan]] in the late 1980s, Pirzada withdrew from active politics and fully concentrated on his legal career. Pirzada was one of the most successful advocates in Pakistan.

==Death==
On September 1, 2015, Pirzada died in [[Royal Berkshire Hospital]] in [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[United Kingdom]]. He was buried in Sukkur, the Pirzada family's ancestral homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesindhtimes.com/pak/prominent-law-expert-abdul-hafeez-pirzado-passes-away/|access-date=2016-05-14|date=2015-09-02|publisher=[[The Sindh Times]]|title=Prominent law expert Abdul Hafeez Pirzado passes away}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1943">'''Anna Motz''' (born 1964) is a Consultant Clinical and Forensic Psychologist with extensive clinical experience with women as perpetrators of violence and with the staff teams who work with them. Formerly president of the [[International Association for Forensic Psychotherapy]] (IAFP), she is the author of ''The Psychology of Female Violence: Crimes Against the Body''.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Motz ''The Psychology of Female Violence: Crimes Against the Body'' (Routledge, 2001) {{ISBN|978-0-415-12675-5}}, 2nd edition January 2008 {{ISBN|978-0-415-40387-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book deals with the causes of violence in women, what can be done to help them and their victims and explores why society denies the fact of female violence.

This book explores the nature and causes of female violence from the perspectives of psychodynamic theory and forensic psychology. The book explores recent high-profile cases of female violence, including the case of [[Murder of Victoria Climbié|Victoria Climbié]], the controversy related to the diagnosis of [[Münchausen syndrome by proxy]], [[Dangerous and severe personality disorder]] in women, and the impact of pro-[[Anorexia nervosa|anorexia]] and pro-[[bulimia]] websites. 

The book also explores other major topics, including the sexual and physical abuse of children by women, [[infanticide]], fabricated and induced illness, and [[self-harm]].

==Military career==
As a young student, the future chief had considered becoming a doctor. He was an exceptional student of Zoology and Biology. But the wars of 1962 and 1965 motivated him to join the NDA in 1968. When asked whether he ever regrets the choice made, Bikram said, "If I were ever to be born again, I would only join the Indian Army."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

A graduate of the 40th course at the [[National Defence Academy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nda.nic.in/chief-of-staff.html |title=Chiefs of Staff |publisher=National Defence Academy |accessdate=10 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh was commissioned into the [[Sikh Light Infantry]] on 31 March 1972. He was adjudged the 'Best Young Officer' at the Young Officer's course at the Infantry School and was also awarded both the Commando Dagger for being the best commando and the 'Best in Tactics' trophy. He later was an instructor at the Commando and Weapons Wings of the Infantry School.&lt;ref name="NDTV"/&gt;

After completing the Higher Command Course, he served his first tenure as a Director in the Military Operations (MO) Directorate. The tenure coincided with the [[Kargil War]] and he was the official spokesperson of the Army during that period. He went on to serve four important tenures at Army HQ: an additional tenure in the MO Directorate as the Deputy Director General, two tenures in the Perspective Planning Directorate, as the Deputy Director General of Perspective Planning (Strategy) and later, as the Additional Director General. He was posted back to the Army HQ as a Lieutenant General to serve as the Director General Staff Duties (DGSD) before taking over as Eastern Army Commander.&lt;ref name="NDTV"/&gt;Colleagues remember him for being a 'soldier's soldier' for spending time and working hard with his troops on the ground. 

He has held positions of [[General Officer Commanding|General Officer Commanding-in-Chief]], [[Eastern Command (India)|Eastern Command]], [[XV Corps (India)|XV Corps]], GOC [[10th Indian Infantry Division|10th Infantry Division]], Commander of Rashtriya Rifles Sector and GOC of the Multi-National Eastern Division in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].&lt;ref name="NDTV"/&gt; He was wounded while posted as a [[Brigadier]] in [[Jammu &amp; Kashmir]], where he has spent much of his service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.indianexpress.com/news/i-have-shed-my-blood-in-kashmir-valley-army-chief/972128/| title= I have shed my blood in Kashmir Valley: Army Chief| date= 9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Bikram Singh retired as Chief of Army Staff on 31 July 2014. He was succeeded by General [[Dalbir Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.gov.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=105072 |title=Lt Gen Dalbir Singh Will be the Next Chief of Army Staff |publisher=Ministry of Defence |accessdate=14 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Bridget'''|ブリジット|Burijitto|lead=yes}} is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] in [[Arc System Works]]'s ''[[Guilty Gear]]'' video game series. Bridget first appeared in the [[2002 in video gaming|2002]] video game ''[[Guilty Gear X2]]''. In the series, the androgynous character was born male with a twin brother in a village where the birth of same-gender twins is considered bad luck; therefore, his family named and raised him as a girl. When Bridget grew up, he decided to prove himself as a bounty hunter.

Bridget was created as "a cute character" by [[Daisuke Ishiwatari]], who wanted to vary the games' cast. Due to the character's appearance, he was initially described as female by [[video game journalism|video game sources]]. When they became aware of his sex, reviewers included Bridget on lists of best androgynous and cross-dressing characters, as well as debated his [[sexual orientation]]. Bridget has become a popular character among gamers, and critics have described him as "a memorable character" in the series.

==Concept and design==
Ishiwatari created Bridget as "a cute character" and to vary the games' cast, since "there were already other good looking and tough characters". As many fighting games already had this type of character, and "it would be too boring if the character was just cute", Ishiwatari "wanted something unconventional"; he and his staff decided it "would be interesting to make the character a guy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Games/Features/AX_09/4.html | title=Anime Expo 2009 |author1=Sung, Lydia |author2=Vega, Gabriel | date=July 22, 2009 | publisher=Neoseeker | accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=110450 | title=Anime Expo 2009: interview with Daisuke Ishiwatari and Toshimichi Mori | author=Asia Pacif Arts Staff | date=July 17, 2009 | publisher=[[University of California, Los Angeles]] | accessdate=July 24, 2013 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713103610/http://asiaarts.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=110450 | archivedate=July 13, 2010 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series' creator also said that Bridget was a difficult character to animate; he "has double the [[film frame|frames]] of animation" due to his [[yo-yo]] movements. He spent "a very long, very frustrating time trying to get the animation to work", rejecting many versions before studio staff made Bridget "look natural".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2011/05/06/all-about-guilty-gear-with-creator-daisuke-ishiwatari/ | title=All About Guilty Gear With Creator Daisuke Ishiwatari | date=May 6, 2011 | publisher=Siliconera | accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==

Bridget was introduced in the third installment of the series, ''Guilty Gear X2'' (2002), and appears to be a girl since he wears a [[nun]]'s [[Religious habit|habit]].&lt;ref name="destructoid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pikigeek"/&gt; However, according to his backstory Bridget is a boy, one of twin brothers named and raised by his parents as a girl in a British&lt;!-- NOTE: Do not change to English as the official site (cited as a source) states he was born in イギリス that is translated as United Kingdom.

As Bridget grows up, he is determined to prove he is not unlucky and becomes a bounty hunter who fights with a yo-yo and {{nihongo|Roger|ロジャー|Rojā}}, his mechanical, oversized teddy bear.&lt;ref name="destructoid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="official"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gaygamer"/&gt; His journey begins when [[I-No]] gives him a fake bounty list.&lt;ref name="destructoid"/&gt; In ''[[Guilty Gear XX#Accent Core Plus|Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus]]'' (2008), since Bridget feels he has proven his [[masculinity]] by defeating several opponents he decides to become an [[entertainer]]. Although he tries to recruit [[List of Guilty Gear characters#Venom|Venom]] for his talent at [[pool (cue sports)|pool]] and I-No for her ability to play [[electric guitar]], both refuse his suggestion. Without money, in one ending Bridget works as a [[waiter]] in [[List of Guilty Gear characters#Jam Kuradoberi|Jam Kuradoberi]]'s restaurant. In an alternate ending he returns to his birth village, finds that his twin brother has disappeared and begins searching for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|developer=[[Arc System Works]]|title=[[Guilty Gear XX#Accent Core Plus|Guilty Gear XX Accent Core Plus]]|publisher=[[Aksys Games]]|date=2008|platform=[[PlayStation 2]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bridget was described as a woman in early reports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-x-button/2012-08-08 | title=Remnants of the Day | author=Ciolek, Todd | date=August 8, 2012 | publisher=[[Anime News Network]] | accessdate=July 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been the subject of discussion about his gender identity.

'''Carlos Castaño Gil''' (May 16, 1965 – April 16, 2004) was the founder of the [[Peasant Self-Defenders of Córdoba and Urabá]] (ACCU), a [[far-right]] [[Paramilitarism in Colombia|paramilitary]] organization in [[Colombia]]. Castaño and his brothers [[Fidel Castaño|Fidel]] and [[Vicente Castaño|Vicente]] founded this group (and its previous incarnations) after their father was kidnapped and killed by the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC), in association with other enemies or victims of the guerrillas. The ACCU later became one of the founding members of the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]] (AUC).

== First years ==
Carlos Castaño Gil was the youngest son of the family Castaño Gil, which mainly raised livestock. Like his brothers, he experienced firsthand the murder of his father and Jesus Castaño. Led by his older brother Fidel, he became a member of self-defense groups, which were among the first of their kind.

He was introduced to Medellin Cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar by his brother Fidel, and their friendship became close. Castaño received combat training from his brother, from army officers and employees of the paramilitary group as well as from the Israeli mercenary [[Yair Klein]].

Castaño opposed financing paramilitary groups through drug trafficking. The friendship between the Castaño brothers and Pablo Escobar broke when the latter sent assassins against the Castaño while being detained inside his personal prison "[[La Catedral]]". Castaño and his brothers then became founders of the group "[[Los Pepes]]" (an acronym for "people persecuted by Pablo Escobar"). During this time Carlos was known by the aliases of "the Phantom" or "the Kid". Contacts between Los Pepes and the Colombian National Police [[Search Bloc]] allegedly resulted in Escobar's demise and killing.

Two months after the death of Escobar, Fidel Castaño was killed in a battle against the EPL guerrilla. However, it is believed that Carlos may have had a role in Fidel's death in retaliation for the alleged rape and murder (or possible suicide) of Rumalda Castaño, a woman alleged to have been a lover of both brothers. After Fidel's death, Carlos Castaño assumed leadership of [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]], a paramilitary federation.

In a 1996 interview with writer [[Robin Kirk]], later published in ''More Terrible Than Death: Massacres, Drugs and America's War in Colombia'' (PublicAffairs: New York, 2003), Castaño acknowledged that the men under his command committed "excesses", but defended them as necessary in Colombia's conflict. "Look, the [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] hide themselves within the civilian population, they manipulate the population".  In a September 1997 interview in ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'' newspaper, Castaño admitted responsibility for the [[Mapiripán massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;US Department of State, [https://www.state.gov/www/global/human_rights/1998_hrp_report/colombia.html Annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices], Washington DC, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Castaño later founded an [[umbrella organization]] of paramilitaries operating in Colombia known as the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia]] (AUC).  The AUC demobilized in 2006 admitting to several brutal murders to the Colombian population.  The AUC was accused by [[human rights]] organizations of committing atrocities, and it has openly admitted to its involvement in the drug trade. The AUC was listed by the [[US Department of State]] as a [[U.S. State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|Foreign Terrorist Organization]]. AUC was disbanded after then Colombian President [[Álvaro Uribe|Alvaro Uribe Vélez]] reached a peace agreement with reduced terms for its members.

Castaño was convicted in absentia of the murder of journalist [[Jaime Garzón]], and sentenced to 38 years in [[prison]].

==Accusations of narcotrafficking==
On September 24, 2002, the [[United States Department of Justice]] unsealed an indictment against Castaño which accused him of trafficking over 17 tons of [[cocaine]] into the [[United States]].  Castaño announced that he would give himself up for trial in the United States and would accept his participation in numerous crimes, though he resented his being personally linked to the drug trade.

Castaño had become isolated from the organization according to some observers, as he seemed to become relatively critical of the AUC's increasing association with narcotraffickers in recent years and was more willing to compromise with the Colombian Government. Allegedly this caused some AUC commanders to turn their backs on him.

Castaño stated on Colombian television in 2000 that 70 percent of AUC funds came from narcotrafficking.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/auc.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disappearance and death==

Castaño was killed on April 16, 2004.  Acting AUC commanders claimed initially that there was an accidental exchange of gunfire between his bodyguards and a separate group of paramilitary fighters.

Other sources within the group and among its dissident factions claimed that he and his men were captured and tortured before being executed and then buried by order of other AUC top leaders (perhaps his own brother [[Vicente Castaño]] and Diego Murillo AKA "[[Don Berna]]"), who had become increasingly close to narcotraffickers and their trade. Colombian investigators found a makeshift grave and an unidentified body (yet apparently not Castaño's) near the supposed area of the events. Those same sources alleged that the bodies of Castaño and his other companions were dug up and taken to other locations before the investigators could arrive.

The possible death of the AUC co-founder remained in the air and was the subject of wild and rampant speculation. One of the rumours, dating from June 1, 2004, stated that unidentified diplomatic sources told the AFP agency that Castaño may have been spirited away to either [[Israel]] or [[Egypt]], via [[Panama]], allegedly with U.S. assistance. No specific reasoning or details regarding this claim were produced and the parties allegedly involved separately denied their participation.

Sources from the AUC and other local militant factions continued to dispute the exact whereabouts of Carlos Castaño. His personal and financial connections between narcotraffickers and other sectors of society could have allowed for their possible collaboration in his conspicuous disappearance or murder. Despite these claims, the truth regarding Castaño's exact condition remained unknown.

On August 23, 2006, Colombia's Attorney General publicly ordered the capture of his brother Vicente Castaño and seven other individuals, accusing them of being involved in Carlos Castaño's apparent death. Alleged witnesses to the crime stated that Castaño's body was apparently dismembered and incinerated.&lt;ref&gt;El Tiempo.  "Fiscalía ordenó captura de José Vicente Castaño por la muerte de su hermano Carlos". August 23, 2006.  [http://www.eltiempo.com/justicia/2006-08-23/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3187438.html Available online]. Accessed October 23, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;El Pais.  "Vicente Castaño habría matado a su hermano". [http://historico.elpais.com.co/paisonline/notas/Agosto232006/vicentecas.html Available online]. Accessed October 23, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Castaño's skeleton was recovered from a shallow grave on September 1, 2006, and identified through [[DNA testing]] by the Colombian government authorities. His brother's second lieutenant named Jesús Roldán AKA "MonoLeche", a former [[Popular Liberation Army]] (Ejército Popular de Liberación) guerrilla who later joined the paramilitaries, confessed to his murder and led authorities to the grave.

==Popular culture==
Castaño is portrayed by the actor [[Mauricio Mejía]] as the character of Adolfo Aguilar "El Halcón" in TV series ''[[El Cartel (TV series)|El Cartel]]'', Mejía also portrays Castaño in the [[Netflix]] original television series ''[[Narcos]]''. [[David Noreña]] portrays Castaño as the character of Lucio Moreno in the TV series ''[[Escobar, el patrón del mal]]''. Castaño is also portrayed by the actor [[Julián Román]] in TV series ''[[Los Tres Caínes]]''.

'''Saint Catherine de' Ricci,''' [[Third Order of St. Dominic|O.S.D.]] ({{lang-it|Caterina de' Ricci}}) (23 April 1522 – 2 February 1590), was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Third Order of St. Dominic|Dominican Tertiary]] [[Religious Sister|sister]]. She is believed to have had miraculous visions and corporeal encounters with Jesus, both with the infant Jesus and with the adult Jesus.&lt;ref name="Classen2012p86"&gt;{{cite book|author=Constance Classen|title=The Deepest Sense: A Cultural History of Touch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1RC8kSUfgEC&amp;pg=PA86 |year=2012|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-09440-8|pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is said to have spontaneously bled with the wounds of the crucified Christ. She is venerated for her [[Christian mysticism|mystic]] visions and is honored as a saint by the Catholic Church.

==Life==
She was born '''Alessandra Lucrezia Romola de' Ricci''' in [[Florence]] to Pier Francesco de' Ricci, of a [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] family, and his wife, Caterina Bonza, who died soon after. At age 6 or 7, her father enrolled her in a school run by a monastery of [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] nuns in the Monticelli quarter of the city, near their home, where her aunt, Luisa de' Ricci, was the [[abbess]]. She was a very prayerful person from a very young age. There she developed a lifelong devotion to the [[Passion of Christ]]. After a short time outside the monastery she entered the [[Santi Vicenzo e Caterina de' Ricci, Prato|Convent of St Vincent]] in [[Prato]], [[Tuscany]], a [[enclosed religious order|cloistered]] community of religious sisters of the [[Third Order of St. Dominic]], disciples of the noted Dominican friar [[Girolamo Savonarola]], who followed the strict regimen of life she desired. In May 1535 she received the [[religious habit]] from her uncle, Friar Timoteo de' Ricci, [[Dominican Order|O.P.]], who was [[confessor]] to the convent, and the [[religious name]] of Catherine, after the Dominican tertiary, [[Catherine of Siena]].&lt;ref name=DS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://willingshepherds.org/Dominican%20Saint%20February.html#Catherine%20Ricci|work=Dominican Saints|title=Saint Catherine of Ricci}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De' Ricci's period of [[novitiate]] was a time of trial. She would experience ecstasies during her routine, which caused her to seem asleep during community prayer services, dropping plates and food, so much so that the community began to question her competence, if not her sanity. Eventually the other Sisters became aware of the spiritual basis for her behavior. By the age of 30 she had risen to the post of [[prioress]].

She is reported to have been a nun with visions, states Constance Classen, who miraculously held baby Jesus dressed in swaddling clothes, and was mystically married and united with adult Jesus.&lt;ref name="Classen2012p86"/&gt;

As the prioress, De' Ricci developed into an effective and greatly admired administrator. She was an advisor on various topics to princes, bishops and cardinals. She corresponded with three figures who were destined to become popes: [[Pope Marcellus II]], [[Pope Clement VIII]], and [[Pope Leo XI]]. An expert on religion, management and [[Administration (business)|administration]], her advice was widely sought. She gave counsel both in person and through exchanging letters. It is reported that she was extremely effective and efficient in her work, managing her priorities very well.

It is claimed that De' Ricci's meditation on the Passion of Christ was so deep that she spontaneously bled, as if [[scourge]]d. She also bore the [[Stigmata]]. During times of deep prayer, like [[Catherine of Siena]], her [[patron saint]], a coral ring representing her marriage to Christ, appeared on her finger.

It is reported that De' Ricci wore an [[Mortification of the flesh|iron chain]] around her neck, engaged in extreme fasting and other forms of penance and sacrifice, especially for souls in [[Purgatory]].

One of the miracles that was documented for her canonization was her appearance many [[Bilocation|hundreds of miles away from where she was physically located]]. This involved appearing in a vision St [[Philip Neri]], a resident of [[Rome]], with whom she had maintained a long-term correspondence. Neri, who was otherwise very reluctant to discuss miraculous events, confirmed the event.&lt;ref name=DS /&gt;

De' Ricci lived in the convent until her death in 1590 after a prolonged illness. Her remains are visible under the altar of the Minor Basilica of [[Santi Vicenzo e Caterina de' Ricci, Prato]], which is next to the convent associated with her life.

==Veneration==
De' Ricci was [[beatified]] by [[Pope Clement XII]] in 1732, and [[canonized]] by [[Pope Benedict XIV]] in 1746. Her [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] falls on 4 February.

'''Conall Cernach''' (modern spelling: '''Conall Cearnach''') is a hero of the [[Ulaid]] in the [[Ulster Cycle]] of [[Irish mythology]]. He is said to have always slept with the head of a [[Connachta|Connachtman]] under his knee. His epithet is normally translated as "victorious" or "triumphant", although it is an obscure word, and some texts struggle to explain it. Alternative meanings include "angular, having corners", "swollen", or "possessing a dish or receptacle".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dictionary of the Irish Language]]'', Compact Edition, [[Royal Irish Academy]], 1990, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legendary biography==

===Physical description===
In the destruction of Da Derga's Hostel, Conall Cernach is described as follows:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I saw a man there in an ornamented dining compartment, who was the fairest of the warriors of Ireland. A fleecy crimson cloak about him. As white as the snow one of the cheeks on him, as freckled-red as the foxglove the other cheek. One of his two eyes is as blue as a hyacinth, as black as a beetle’s back the other eye. The measure of a reaping basket his bushy tree (of) fair, very blond (hair) that is on him. It strikes the edge of his two hips. It is as fleecy as a tufted ram. Though a sack of bountiful (?) red nuts were poured out over the top of his head, not a nut of them would fall to the ground. A goldhilted sword in his hand. A blood-red shield, dotted with rivets of white metal (tincopper alloy) between plates of gold. A long, three-ridged spear, as thick as an outer yoke (of a miller’s team?) the shaft that is on it."&lt;ref&gt;http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~alvismal/2heimdal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Birth===
His father was [[Amairgin mac Echit]] and his mother was [[Findchoem]]. His parents' marriage was barren, until Findchoem visited a [[druid]] and was advised to drink from a certain well. She took a drink from the well, swallowing a worm with it, and became pregnant. Findchoem's brother [[Cet mac Mágach]], a Connachtman, protected his sister until she gave birth to a son, Conall. Druids came to initiate the child into their religion, and prophesied that he would kill more than half of the men of Connacht, and that he would always have a Connachtman's head on his belt. Cet took the child, put him under his heel and tried to break his neck, but only damaged it, leaving Conall with a crooked neck.&lt;ref&gt;Whitley Stokes (ed. &amp; trans.), "''Cóir Anmann''", ''Irische Texte'' series 3 vol. 2, 1897, p. 393-395&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mac Da Thó's Pig===
{{main|The Tale of Mac Da Thó's Pig}}
Conall would have a fierce rivalry with Cet for the rest of his life. He shamed Cet at a feast at the house of Mac Dá Thó, a hospitaller of [[Leinster]], when the warriors of [[Connacht]] and Ulster competed for the [[champion's portion]] by boasting of their deeds. Cet reminded all comers how he had bested them in combat, including emasculating [[Celtchar]] with his [[spear]]. However, just as Cet was about to carve, Conall arrived, and his boasts topped even Cet's. Cet admitted defeat, but claimed that if his brother Anlúan were present, his feats would top even Conall's. Conall responded by tossing him Anlúan's freshly severed head.&lt;ref&gt;N. Kershaw Chadwick (ed. &amp; trans.), [http://adminstaff.vassar.edu/sttaylor/MacDatho/ "The Story of Mac Dathó's Pig"], ''An Early Irish Reader, Cambridge University Press, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bricriu's Feast===
He also competed for the champion's portion at a feast held by the troublemaker [[Bricriu]], albeit with less success. Bricriu went in turn to Conall, [[Lóegaire Búadach]] and [[Cúchulainn]], and promised each of them the champion's portion. When the feast started each of the three warriors' charioteers stood up and claimed the champion's portion for his master. A fight broke out between Conall, Láegare and Cúchulainn, until King [[Conchobar mac Nessa|Conchobar]], [[Fergus mac Róich|Fergus]] and [[Sencha mac Ailella|Sencha]] intervened to separate them. Meanwhile, Bricriu went to each of the three heroes' wives - Conall's wife Lendabair, Lóegaire's wife Fedelm, and Cúchulainn's wife [[Emer]] - and promised them precedence at the feast, and when the women approached, Conall, Lóegaire and Cúchulainn were almost set to violence again. Emer was the first to enter, as Cúchulainn lifted the side of the house up to let her in, tipping Bricriu into a ditch. The Ulstermen asked first [[Ailill mac Máta|Ailill]] and [[Medb]], king and queen of Connacht, then [[Cú Roí]], king of [[Munster]], to adjudicate the dispute. In every test set, Cúchulainn came out on top, but neither Conall nor Lóegaire would accept the result. Finally, a hideous, giant churl, carrying a huge axe, appeared at [[Emain Macha]]. He challenged each of the three heroes to cut off his head, and then allow him to return the next day to cut off the hero's head. Lóegaire accepted the challenge and cut off the churl's head, and the churl picked up his head and left. He returned the next day, but Lóegaire was nowhere to be seen. Conall was the next to take up the challenge, but he too did not fulfil his side of the bargain. Finally Cúchulainn cut off the churl's head, and submitted himself to the churl's axe the following day as promised. The churl spared him, revealed himself as Cú Roí, and declared that Cúchulainn should have the champion's portion undisputed at any feast held by the Ulstermen.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Peete Cross]] &amp; Clark Harris Slover (eds.), [http://web.ncf.ca/dc920/bricriu.html "Bricriu's Feast"], ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt &amp; Company, 1936, pp. 254-280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fráech's Cattle Raid===
He helped the Connacht hero [[Fráech]] recover his abducted wife and sons and stolen cattle. They tracked them to [[Alba]] ([[Scotland]]), southwards through [[Great Britain|Britain]], across the [[English Channel]], through [[Lombardy]], to the [[Alps]], where they met an Irish girl herding sheep. She told them the land was ruled by warriors who stole cattle from far and near, and had recently brought back Fráech's cattle and family. She advised them to go to the woman who tended the cows, who warned them that the fort where Fráech's wife was kept was guarded by a serpent, but promised to leave the gate open for them. When they attacked the fort, the serpent leaped into Conall's belt, and did him no harm. They liberated Fráech's family, took all the cattle and treasure, and went back to Ireland the way they came.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Leahy (ed. &amp; trans), [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/fraech.html "The Cattle Raid of Fraech"], ''Heroic Romances of Ireland'' vol. II, David Nutt, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Battle of Howth===
He fought [[Mes Gedra]], king of Leinster, in single combat following a battle provoked by the Ulster poet [[Athirne]]. Mes Gedra had lost a hand in an earlier fight, so Conall fought him with one hand tucked into his belt. He won, taking his opponent's head as a trophy. When he put Mes Gedra's head on his shoulder, it straightened his neck. Conall's charioteer couldn't carry the head, so he cut out the brain and preserved it by mixing it with [[Calcium oxide|lime]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Whitley Stokes]], "The Siege of Howth", ''Revue Celtique'' 8, 1871, pp. 47-63&lt;/ref&gt; The calcified brain was later stolen by Cet and used to kill [[Conchobar mac Nessa]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kuno Meyer]] (ed. &amp; trans.), [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/conchobar3.html "The Death of Conchobar"], ''The Death-Tales of the Ulster Heroes'', Todd Lecture Series, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

===The death of Cúchulainn===
Conall and Cúchulainn had sworn to each other that whoever was killed first, the other would avenge him before nightfall. When [[Lugaid mac Con Roí]] and [[Erc mac Cairpri]] killed Cúchulainn, Conall pursued them. Lugaid had also lost a hand, and Conall again fought one-handed, but this time he only won after his horse took a bite out of Lugaid's side. He took both their heads, and when he took Erc's head back to [[Tara, Ireland|Tara]] his sister, [[Achall]], died of grief.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Peete Cross &amp; Clark Harris Slover (eds.), [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/cuchulain3.html "The Death of Cu Chulainn"], ''Ancient Irish Tales'', Henry Holt &amp; Company, 1936, pp. 333-340&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final showdown with Cet===
Conall pursued Cet after he had made a raid on Ulster, killing twenty-seven men and taking their heads. It had snowed, so he was able to follow his trail. He caught up with him, but was reluctant to face him until his charioteer chided him for cowardice. They met at a ford, and Conall killed Cet in a ferocious combat that left Conall near to death himself. He was found by [[Bélchú]] of [[Breifne]], a Connachtman, who took him home, tended to his wounds, and planned to fight him when he was fit. But Bélchú soon regretted his honourable behaviour and asked his three sons to kill Conall as he lay in his sickbed. Conall overheard and forced Bélchú to take his place in the bed, and when his sons arrived they killed him instead. Conall then killed the three of them and took all four heads home.&lt;ref&gt;Kuno Meyer (ed. &amp; trans), [http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/cet.html "The Death of Cet mac Mágach"], ''The Death-Tales of the Ulster Heroes'', Todd Lecture Series, 1906&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
After Conchobor and his son, [[Cormac Cond Longas]], had been killed, Conall was offered the kingship of Ulster, but he refused it, putting forward instead his foster-son, Conchobar's younger son [[Cúscraid]], who was proclaimed king.&lt;ref&gt;R.I. Best, "The Battle of Airtech", ''Ériu'' 8, 1916, pp. 170-190&lt;/ref&gt; In his declining years he contracted leprosy and went to stay with Ailill and Medb of Connacht, who were best placed to look after him, since they had the resources to satisfy his enormous appetite. Ailill was seeing another woman behind Medb's back, so Medb incited Conall to kill Ailill, something he was happy to do as Ailill had killed [[Fergus mac Róich]]. Ailill was killed on 1 May, [[Lá Bealtaine]], which was on a Tuesday.&lt;ref&gt;'Flannacán mac Cellaig rí Breg hoc carmen. His poem on the death of some Irish heroes', by Kathleen Mulchrone, in "Journal of Celtic Studies", Vol I (1949-50), pp. 80-93, stanza 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Conall fled, but the men of Connacht pursued and killed him at a ford on the following Monday, 7 May.&lt;ref&gt;Kuno Meyer (ed. &amp; trans.), "The Cherishing of Conall Cernach and the Deaths of Ailill and of Conall Cernach", ''Zeitschrift für celtische Philologie'' 1, 1897, pp. 102-111&lt;/ref&gt; Both oral tradition and old textual sources place this at the town of [[Ballyconnell]], [[County Cavan]].&lt;ref&gt;James MacKillop, ''Dictionary of Celtic Mythology'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.academia.edu/13072981/The_Death_Of_Conall_Cernach_At_Ballyconnell_County_Cavan The Death of Conall Cernach at Ballyconnell, Co. Cavan]",  by Tom Smith in ''Breifne Journal'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and Genealogy==

Conall's wife was Lendabair, daughter of Eogain mac Durthacht. He also had other wives, including 1. Aifi, daughter of Bélcu Bréifne whom Conall had slain; 2. Niamh, daughter of Cealtair; 3. Feibe, daughter of Concubur and her son by Conall was Fiaca Fir Feibe; 4. [[Fedelm Noíchrothach]], daughter of [[Conchobar mac Nessa]]. She was also the wife of [[Cairbre Nia Fer]], whom she left to go to Conall; 5. Londcaidhe, daughter of Eatach Eachbeoil. Her son by Conall was Irial Glunmar. Unusually for a character from the Ulster Cycle, Conall appears in [[medieval]] Irish [[genealogies]] as the ancestor of the kings of the [[Dál nAraidi]]&lt;ref&gt;T. F. O'Rahilly, ''Early Irish History and Mythology'', Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1946, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Uí Echach Cobo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The legendary [[High King of Ireland|High King]] [[Mal mac Rochride]] was also said to be descended from him.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Keating]], ''Foras Feasa ar Éirinn'' [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T100054/text050.html 1.40]&lt;/ref&gt;

She was with ABC News from 1994 to 2014 and joined NBC News in March 2014.&lt;ref name="variety-2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|title=NBC News Lures 'Nightline' Anchor Cynthia McFadden From ABC|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=March 27, 2014|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/nbc-news-lures-nightline-anchor-cynthia-mcfadden-from-abc-1201149002/|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Education===
Born in [[Lewiston, Maine]], McFadden graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and [[summa cum laude]] from [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine]], in 1978.  Afterward, she received her [[Juris Doctorate]] degree from [[Columbia Law School]] in [[New York City]] in 1984.

===Career===

====Early career and time as ABC News correspondent====
From 1984 to 1991, McFadden was the executive producer of [[Fred Friendly]]'s Media and Society seminars based at Columbia, many of which were broadcast on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]].&lt;ref name="variety-2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/cynthia-mcfadden/story?id=128458|title=Cynthia McFadden's Biography|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=19 June 2013|website=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She then joined the [[Courtroom Television Network]] as an anchor and producer in 1991, its inaugural year.&lt;ref name="variety-2014"/&gt;  After working there for several years, she joined ABC News in 1994 as the network's legal correspondent, covering amongst other subjects the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O. J. Simpson trial]].

====Promotion to anchor====
McFadden became an anchor of ''Primetime'' in 2004 and, having previously substituted for [[Ted Koppel]] on several occasions, an anchor of ''Nightline'' on November 28, 2005, along with [[Martin Bashir]] and [[Terry Moran]], following the longtime anchor's final broadcast. Bashir left the program due to fallout from credibility problems from the disputed and controversial reports on singer Michael Jackson and was replaced by [[Bill Weir]] in 2010. The three tended to anchor in shifts, leading the show by themselves every third night. While ''Nightline'' was threatened with cancellation in 2002 under Koppel's long form journalism format, it saw a resurgence in its ratings and prominence after switching to more celebrity topics, pop culture and entertainment news, often competing for higher numbers with the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ABC denies Kimmel slot shift | publisher=The Live Feed: THR | url=http://www.thrfeed.com/2009/01/abc-denies-kimmel-slot-shift.html | accessdate=2009-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As anchor, McFadden conducted a number of significant interviews including ones with celebrities such as [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Paul McCartney]], past and present world leaders such as [[Pervez Musharraf]] and [[Tony Blair]], and five with [[Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]].

====Move from ABC to NBC====
On March 29, 2014, after two decades with ABC News, with the last nine years as a ''Nightline'' anchor, McFadden left and joined [[NBC News]].&lt;ref name="variety-2014"/&gt; She serves as the senior legal and investigative correspondent, contributing to NBC's investigative unit across all NBC News platforms.

====Other work====
McFadden is a contributor for [[wowOwow]].com, a web site launched in 2008 for women to discuss culture, politics and gossip.  She has additionally hosted or co-hosted a number of documentaries and specials on ABC.

She is co-chair of the board of [[IWMF]] (International Women's Media Foundation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Board Of Directors |url=http://www.iwmf.org/about-us/board-of-directors/ |publisher=IWMF |accessdate=17 May 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YbGT9rne?url=http://www.iwmf.org/about-us/board-of-directors/ |archivedate=17 May 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cyriac K. Pullapilly''' is a [[Royal Society of Arts|Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts]], a former priest of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] and an emeritus professor of history at [[Saint Mary's College (Indiana)|Saint Mary's College, Indiana]].

==Biography==
Cyriac Pullapilly was born in [[South India]]. He was ordained in 1948, and completed his undergraduate studies at the St. Joseph Apostolic seminary, which at its time, was the second-largest seminary in the world. While attending the seminary, he wrote for a missionary publication called ''Home Field''. He also was part of the anti-communist movement in his college and wrote various publications critical of the communist government which controlled the legislature in his state.&lt;ref name="suburbanite"&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Priest from India views East, West|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/54969033/|accessdate=2016-10-05|agency=Suburbanite Economist|date=August 3, 1960|page=15 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, he founded the Semester Around the World Program, where [[University of Notre Dame]] and Saint Mary's College, Indiana, students travelled the world and studied in India.

He has a multi-disciplinary approach to his studies and has published works on a broad range of subjects. His research has been supported by the [[Fulbright Foundation]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and in 2006 – the year in which he was admitted to the Royal Society of Arts – he held a visiting academic post at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He has also established his own publishing company and produced an "inclusive-language" edition of the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Queen to honor educator: Royal Society of Arts to induct SMC prof |first=Kim |last=Abeel |date=October 9, 2006 |publisher=The Observer |location=Notre Dame, IN |url=http://www.ndsmcobserver.com/2.2754/queen-to-honor-educator-1.264092#.UT5LZvnbBBl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |page=xxxv |title=Asia in the Making of Europe: East Asia |first1=Donald Frederick |last1=Lach |first2=Edwin J. |last2=Van Kley |publisher=University of Chicago Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-22646-765-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based upon his founding of the Semester Around the World program, Pullapilly received the Spes Unica Award from Saint Mary's College for his outstanding service to the College in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.saintmarys.edu/files/courier/issues/courier-07summer.pdf | title=Awards |  journal=Courier | publisher=St. Mary's College | volume=82 | number=2 | date=Summer 2007 | page=40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Pullapilly studied at St Thomas College in India and then at the [[University of Chicago]], where he earned his PhD. He and his wife are both Indian immigrants to the United States, raising their children in [[South Bend, Indiana]]. Pullapilly is the father of filmmaker [[Gita Pullapilly]].&lt;ref name="NYT2009"/&gt;

An only child, Pullapilly's parents were initially reluctant to let him become a priest. Around 1960, he expressed interest in missionary work but said that he did not have the time.&lt;ref name="suburbanite"/&gt;

'''David Xanatos''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the primary villains of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animated television series ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]''. In the series, he is the founder, owner and [[CEO]] of Xanatos Enterprises and a member of the [[Illuminati]].  Xanatos was voiced by (and his design inspired by) ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Jonathan Frakes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Gargoyles Has 'Star Trek' Ties  |work= [[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=|url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1997-06-22/entertainment/9706120333_1_gargoyles-sirtis-zoom|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xanatos' behavior is often ruthless and [[amorality|amoral]], although his personality is slightly softened later in the series by his affection for his wife [[Fox (Gargoyles)|Fox]] and their infant son, Alexander Fox Xanatos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gargwiki.net/Alexander_Fox_Xanatos |title=Gargwiki — Alexander Fox Xanatos |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=gargwiki.net |publisher= |accessdate=June 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His plans are often intricate and [[Machiavellian]] — however, he is notably not vindictive as he sees [[revenge]] as foolish and even tends to try to see the positive side of his defeats. In fact, Xanatos is notorious for his intricate plans that often have multiple interplaying goals to endeavor that some beneficial result is achieved in one way or another, despite the frequent intervention of [[Goliath (Gargoyles)|Goliath]], Xanatos' arch-rival, and his [[Manhattan Clan|clan of Gargoyles]]. He is obsessed with obtaining [[immortality]] for himself and his family. His loyal right-hand man is [[Owen Burnett]], a stoic man [[List of Gargoyles characters#Puck|with extraordinary hidden talents]] Xanatos gained through equally remarkable circumstances.

Xanatos is a formidable fighter in his own right. In addition to advanced [[karate]] and [[judo]] skills, he also has a specialized [[Powered exoskeleton|red armored suit]] modeled on his Steel Clan robots that he wears frequently, with both Xanatos' armored suit and Steel Clan robots  appearing to be partly modeled on Goliath's general appearance and size. He also has a highly advanced anthropomorphic [[AI]] device modeled after himself, designed to do his bidding; it impersonates and represents him whenever he needs it to. This robot became the leader of the criminal group [[Pack (Gargoyles)|The Pack]] under the name of Coyote, and on one occasion, he actually used it to try to capture the actual [[Coyote in mythology|Coyote spirit]].

==Fictional biography==
David Xanatos started life as the son of Petros Xanatos, a Greek immigrant who worked a fisherman from [[Bar Harbor, Maine]].  Young Xanatos received an anonymous letter that contained a set of valuable 10th-century coins. He sold the coins for $20,000 and invested the money in a series of successful ventures, thus pulling himself out of poverty during the process. He would later embark on a business career, the first steps toward building his own company, Xanatos Enterprises, which includes the technology subsidiaries cybernetics and [[genetics]] company Gen-U-Tech and the Scarab Corporation robotics firm; the Xanatos construction company, and the television franchise Pack Media Studios. Another technology investment venture that Xanatos Enterprises has expanded into is the arms industry (such as the particle beam accelerators which Tony Dracon stole during the series). Xanatos Enterprises also controls the lease of an oil rig located near Black Rock Point. Despite his father's belief that Xanatos did not deserve the gift that had launched his career, Xanatos continued to claim that he would one day prove himself a self-made man.

During this time, Xanatos took on Owen Burnett under his wing, a former employee of business rival Halcyon Renard, as his assistant. Eventually, Burnett revealed that he is actually [[Puck (mythology)|Puck]], a [[Oberon's children|Child of Oberon]],  and offered Xanatos a tempting choice: a single wish (which could grant the immortality he sought) or a lifetime of service as the mortal Owen Burnett.  Against Puck's expectations, Xanatos, confident that he could achieve immortality through other methods, chose Owen's service, and the decision deeply impressed Puck to keep his end of the bargain, with the inference that, should Xanatos achieve his goal, he will be guaranteed Puck/Owen's services for eternity.

Xanatos learned of Castle Wyvern from [[Demona]], the only gargoyle from the Wyvern Clan who had neither been destroyed nor put into stone sleep. He purchased the ruins, transported them to Manhattan, and had the structure rebuilt atop his New York skyscraper, the Eyrie Building.&lt;ref name="Hollywood"&gt;{{cite news|title=Six Cartoons That Should Be Movies |work=Hollywood.com |date= |url=http://www.hollywood.com/content/feature_detail.aspx?id=6973247&amp;p=5 |accessdate=2011-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004135255/http://www.hollywood.com/content/feature_detail.aspx?id=6973247&amp;p=5 |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the castle "above the clouds," Xanatos successfully released the [[Manhattan Clan]] from their frozen sleep.&lt;ref name="Hollywood" /&gt;

Xanatos initially posed as the Gargoyles' friend, convincing them to "acquire" technology from his rival Cyberbiotics for him and ultimately attempting to destroy the gargoyles once their replacements, the Steel Clan, came online. The Steel Clan was defeated, however, and Xanatos was convicted for receiving stolen property ("Awakening, Part V"). Xanatos continued to plot against the Gargoyles from prison, testing them and attempting to remove them from the castle. Upon his release, he became one of their greatest enemies, engaging in a particularly fierce rivalry with their leader, [[Goliath (Gargoyles)|Goliath]].

Xanatos also committed himself to getting his own clan of gargoyles that would be loyal and obedient to him. To that end, he tried several attempts throughout the series to do that such as resurrecting Goliath's brother [[Coldstone (Gargoyles)|Coldstone]] and some of the other dead gargoyles from the Wyvern Clan; enlisting the services of a "freelance geneticist" named Dr. Anton Sevarius to craft unwitting human subjects towards genetically creating his own clan of gargoyle-like [[Mutate (comics)|mutate]]s from humans, one of whom was [[Elisa Maza]]'s younger brother, Derek; [[Thailog|creating a clone of Goliath]], and perfecting the Steel Clan. It is also during this time he discovered the existence and joined the [[Illuminati]].

When his attempts to create his own gargoyle clan failed, Xanatos instead changed his goal to acquiring immortality through the use of [[Magic (paranormal)|sorcery]] and magic, even involving himself with [[Oberon's children|children of Oberon]], including Oberon himself — the formidable Lord of the mystical island of Avalon.

Xanatos would meet an equal in [[Fox (Gargoyles)|Fox]] and marry her. It was on this occasion that, by inviting Goliath to the wedding and luring him into seeking reconciliation with Demona, Xanatos was able to reconstruct the [[Phoenix Gate]]. The wedding party was brought back in time to the 10th century, where Xanatos arranged for the ancient coins to be delivered to himself a thousand years in the future, via Illuminati, as well as a message to himself describing what to do with them. In this way, Xanatos fulfilled his own history through a [[predestination paradox]], at the same time proving himself to his father as a "self-made man" ("[[Vows (Gargoyles)|Vows]]").

When Demona finally betrayed Xanatos to advance her own goals of destroying the human race, he was forced to call a truce with Goliath to stop her.&lt;ref&gt;"[[City of Stone|City of Stone, Part II]]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = 10 Villains Who Changed Sides (But Stayed Cool)  |work= [[io9.com]]|date=|url= http://io9.com/5823222/10-villains-who-changed-sides-but-stayed-cool|accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goliath was later instrumental in saving Xanatos's newborn son Alexander, something which Xanatos owed him a great debt, and pledged to pay back to him ("[[The Gathering (Gargoyles)|The Gathering, Part II]]"). He soon created new robotic bodies for Coldstone's other personalities to inhabit, which he named Coldfire and Coldsteel. Since these gargoyles were also created by magic, though, it was impossible for mind transfer to occur. While he and Fox were out to dinner, Puck and Alexander performed the transfer for him. When the existence of the gargoyles was revealed to the public, Xanatos puts an end to the feud between them and voluntarily allows the gargoyles to come back to live in their ancestral castle ("Hunter's Moon, Part III").

==Relationships==
Though at first Xanatos seems to have an on and off partnership with Demona when neither magic nor technology seem to be enough to accomplish what they plan to do, neither Xanatos nor Demona seem to truly trust one another. This proves to be a fatal flaw on their part, that tends to doom their future plans towards failure.

In general, Xanatos has an odd way of dealing with those he "loves". One example can be found in Thailog, Goliath's clone that he had Sevarius create. While the clone was being grown he had a program playing giving him information about the world and his beliefs. He seemed to have a paternal feeling towards Thailog as, when the gargoyle was kidnapped during his stone slumber, he would not let Owen fire on the kidnappers out of fear of hurting Thailog, and handed over $20,000,000 for his safe return without a second thought. He even showed pride in Thailog's manipulative abilities and genius when he found out the clone had engineered the entire plot to abscond with the money, referring to him as "a chip off the ole block". He even expressed to Thailog that if he wanted the money he would have given it to him if he would have asked for it. However his paternalism seems thin as, when he thinks Thailog died during battle with Goliath, he states that he knew the whole time that a copy (Thailog) couldn't match the original (Goliath), which infuriates Goliath as Xanatos was able to dehumanize a living being to such terms. Though arguably lacking romance, Xanatos asks Fox to marry him on the basis that "it makes sense" because they are genetically compatible, share the same interests, and "love each other" as much as two people such as themselves can.

Though he does love Fox, he is shown using her to get what he wants as well. In the Halloween episode, Xanatos gives Fox the Avalon-crafted Eye of Odin as an engagement gift. The necklace holds unfathomable occult powers that Fox cannot control. It turns her into a large red-haired beast, looking like a 'fox'-human hybrid bearing a resemblance to a [[werewolf]]. Though Xanatos suspects it has an effect on her, he does not fully understand, until he witnesses Fox transform in front of him. Terrified by what he has set into motion, he asks Goliath and Elisa for assistance, though they are initially reluctant. Goliath seems especially perturbed at how he has treated Fox and seemingly disregarded her life.

As Fox continues to go on rampages in search for food, Xanatos, Goliath, and Elisa scour the city for her. Eventually, they chase her to a rooftop and Goliath is able to free Fox from the Eye of Odin after electrocuting her with a neon sign. While preparing to leave and while holding Fox in his arms, Xanatos regretfully informs Goliath that now he knows his only weakness. Goliath turns to him, slightly disgusted and remarks, "Only you would regard love as a weakness." These words leave Xanatos speechless, but silently admits.

In the episodes of the Gathering, Xanatos seems instinctively protective of both Fox and Alexander, seemingly having come to terms with the idea of love not being a weakness.

== Appearance in media ==

===SLG Comic===
Soon after, Owen received a call from Mr. Duval from The Illuminati for Xanatos. Xanatos refused as he spent some time with his son that night. On Halloween Night, he's later visited by Martin Hacker (who ranks 32 in The Illuminati) who gives him an invitation to the [[White House]]. From there he meets another Illuminati member, Quincy Hemings (Chief Stewart at the White House who ranks 2 in The Illuminati). He hands Xanatos a mission from The Illuminati.

The mission is for him to obtain [[Stone of Scone|The Stone of Destiny]] which is being sent back to Scotland. To ensure success, he recruits Coldsteel and activates Coyote 5.0. He sends some Steel and Iron Clan robots to assist them.

===The Goliath Chronicles===
The third season of Gargoyles was called ''The Goliath Chronicles''. In this season, Xanatos was portrayed as a benefactor to the Gargoyles. Greg Weisman, the main writer behind ''Gargoyles'', disagreed with how Xanatos is portrayed in the Goliath Chronicles. Weisman has stated that he believes that if the feud with the clan ended, Xanatos would still seek to achieve his own goals (as according to Greg will be demonstrated in #4 or 5 of the SLG series). This is acknowledged by Brooklyn and Goliath in #1 of the [[Slave Labor Graphics]] [[Gargoyles (SLG comic)|comic book series continuation]] that while he isn't 100% trustworthy, they trust him not to smash them during the day. In the Goliath Chronicles, Xanatos must deal with pressure from The Illuminati in terms of turning the clan over to them.

{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}
In the  [[Western culture|Western]] tradition of [[surname]]s, there are several types of '''double surname''' (also '''double-barrelled surname'''&lt;ref&gt;The term "double-barrelled surname" was in origin used for British double names indicative of (partially) aristocratic background; so in [[Thomas Innes of Learney]], ''The Clans, Septs and Regiments of the Scottish Highlands'' (1970), p. 186.
Earlier usage prefers "double-barrelled name" in reference to the British double surnames, the more specific "double-barrelled surname" is a [[recharacterization]] after the recent tendency to use "double-barrelled name" for the fashion of hyphenated given names.
The term "double-barrelled (sur)name" appears to have been coined in the [[Victorian era]], originally with a sarcastic undertone implying pomposity; e.g.: 
*"It is looked on as a public blessing, a boon to the general good-humor, when a statesman is endowed with a double-barreled name. It brings on a perpetual feu de joie of squibs, and makes him so much the more agreeable to everybody but himself." ''Lippincott's Monthly Magazine, a Popular Journal of General Literature'', Volume 18, 1876, p. 385.
*"The hero, who was a prince, had a sort of double-barreled name, which would defy all sorts at pronunciation; and so had the heroine. They were names which, no doubt, would be instrumental in selling any fever and ague mixture should they be affixed to it." ''Puck'', Puck Publishing Company, 1878, p. 21.
*"an extravagant superfluity of new-coined phraseology and technical terms, which every distinguished person's illness elicits from some fashionable physician with a double-barreled surname and none denoting Christianity." Robert Joshua Leslie, John Leslie (bishop of Clogher), ''The life and times of ... John Leslie, bishop of the Isles, and of Raphoe and Clogher'', 1885, p. 157.
But it is now also used more generally of any double surname (an example for this is 
Azoulai, ''The Question of Competence in the European Union'' (2014:[https://books.google.com/books?id=lzHLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA180  180]) using "double-barrelled" to refer to a Danish double surname.&lt;/ref&gt;). If the two names are joined with a [[hyphen]], it may also be called a '''hyphenated surname'''.

*In [[United Kingdom|British]] tradition, a double surname is heritable, and mostly taken in order to preserve a family name which would have become extinct due to the absence of male descendants bearing the name, connected to the inheritance of a family estate.  Examples include [[Rolls family|Harding-Rolls]] and [[Drayton House|Stopford Sackville]]. 
*In [[Spanish naming customs|Hispanic tradition]], double surnames are the norm, and not an indication of social status. A person will take the (first) surname of their father, followed by the (first) surname of their mother (i.e. their maternal grandfather's surname). The double surname itself is not heritable. These names are combined without hyphen (but optionally combined using ''y'' "and"). In addition to this, there are heritable double surnames (''apellidos compuestos'') which are combined with a hyphen.
*In [[German name|German tradition]], double surnames are taken upon marriage, written with or without hyphen, combining the husband's surname with the wife's (more recently the sequence has become optional under some legislations). These double surnames are "alliance names" (''Allianznamen'') and as such not heritable.

==British tradition==
{{further information|English surname|Scottish surname|Name change#Historical usage}}
A few British upper-class families have "triple-barrelled" surnames (e.g. [[Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe baronets|Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe]]; [[Cave-Browne-Cave baronets|Cave-Browne-Cave]]; [[Earl of Minto|Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound]]; [[Baron Willoughby de Eresby|Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby]]; [[Thomas Algernon Smith-Dorrien-Smith|Smith-Dorrien-Smith]]; [[Marquess of Londonderry|Vane-Tempest-Stewart]]). Not all of those with multiple names were [[British peerage|of the peerage]]; [[landed gentry]] such as [[George Henry Lane-Fox Pitt-Rivers]] consolidated the estates and wealth of several families in their multiple names. These are sometimes created when one spouse has a double-barrelled name and the other has a single surname. Nowadays, such names are almost always abbreviated in everyday use to a single or double-barrelled version. There are even a few "quadruple-barrelled" surnames (e.g. [[Baron Clinton|Hepburn-Stuart-Forbes-Trefusis]], [[Baron Thurlow|Hovell-Thurlow-Cumming-Bruce]], [[Earl of Wharncliffe|Montagu-Stuart-Wortley-Mackenzie]], [[Plunkett-Ernle-Erle-Drax]] and Stirling-Home-Drummond-Moray). The surname of the extinct family of the [[Duke of Buckingham and Chandos|Dukes of Buckingham and Chandos]] was the quintuple-barrelled Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville.

[[Captain (OF-2)|Captain]] [[Leone Sextus Denys Oswolf Fraudatifilius Tollemache-Tollemache de Orellana Plantagenet Tollemache-Tollemache]] is sometimes quoted as the man with the most ever "barrels" in his surname (six), but in fact all but the last two of these (Tollemache-Tollemache) were forenames.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Many double-barrelled names are written without a hyphen, which can cause confusion as to whether the surname is double-barrelled or not. Notable persons with unhyphenated double-barrelled names include prime minister [[David Lloyd George]], the composer [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], astronomer [[Robert Hanbury Brown]], actors [[Kristin Scott Thomas]] and [[Helena Bonham Carter]] (although she has said the hyphen is optional)&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times Magazine'', November 1999&lt;/ref&gt; comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] (however, his cousin Professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] opted for the hyphen) and [[Sylvia Llewelyn Davies]].

==Iberian tradition==
{{further information|Iberian naming customs|Spanish naming customs|Portuguese name|Hispanic American naming customs}}
When a person is born, the custom is for them to take the first surname of the father and then the first surname of the mother. Thus, when D. [[Julio Iglesias|Julio Iglesias de la Cueva]] and Dª [[Isabel Preysler|Isabel Preysler Arrastía]] had a son called Enrique, he legally was [[Enrique Iglesias|Enrique Iglesias Preysler]]. Where the optional conjunction ''y'' (and) is used, the example would become "Enrique Iglesias y Preysler" (never used in the case of Enrique Iglesias; see for example [[José Ortega y Gasset]]). On the other hand, actual double-barrelled names exist (called ''apellidos compuestos''), such as García-Huidobro, Cruz-Coke. For example, [[Luciano Cruz-Coke|Luciano Cruz-Coke Carvallo]] is the son of Mr. Carlos Cruz-Coke Ossa and Ms. Lucía Carvallo Arriagada. In every day use Mr. Cruz-Coke Carvallo is Mr. Cruz-Coke, never Mr. Cruz.  Such names usually reflect the same case as in Anglo-Saxon tradition: the survival of a family name that would be lost without this practice.   
Another common case is to find double-barrelled names with the use of the conjunction "de" (of).  In Iberian tradition this commonly indicates a [[toponymic surname]] or a noble family name. 
Toponymic family such as the surnames García De las Heras, Pérez de Arce or the very common Ortiz de Zárate combine a regular family name with the place that family resides.   For example, the "Ortiz" resides in the Basque town of [[Zarate, Spain|Zarate]], in Euskal Herria.  
The least common double-barreled names that use the particle "de" are the nobiliary ones, such as the  [[Álvarez de Toledo]], [[Ramírez de Arellano]] or [[Fernández de Córdoba]].  In these cases, the first surname indicates the original name of the family, whereas the second surname denotes the nobiliary feud of that family.  In this case, the conjunction "de" (of) reflects that the family used to be the feudal lords of that place.  Thus, the Ramírez were the lords of the village of [[Arellano]], in [[Navarre]].

[[Álava]], Spain is notorious for its incidence of true compound surnames, known as "apellido compuesto alavés" (Álava compound surname).  Unlike other true compound surnames, which resulted from the merging of a previously paternal and maternal surname, the Álava compound surname is characterized for having the first portion of the surname as a patronymic, normally a Spanish patronymic (i.e. from the [[Castilian language]]) or more unusually a [[Basque language]] patronymic, followed by the [[preposition]] "de", with the second part of the surname being a local toponymic surname from Álava. While this form of compound surname can be found in other regions of Spain, albeit scarcely, it is only in Álava that it has persisted. These type of customary compound surnames used to be found throughout [[Guipúzcoa]], [[Navarra]], [[Soria]], [[Logroño]], and most of [[Green Spain]] generally (i.e. the Spanish northern maritime façade exposed to the Atlantic Ocean which runs along the coastal strip lying north of the Cantabrian and Basque mountains, along the Bay of Biscay.)

In [[Portugal]], where most of the population have two to four surnames (''apelidos de família''), the practice of using a double combination of surnames is very common. The person can either use a paternal and a maternal surname combined ([[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]]) or use a double last name that has been passed down through one of the parents ([[António Lobo Antunes]]). The last surname (normally the paternal one) is usually considered the "most important", but people may choose to use another one, often favouring the more sonant or less common of their surnames in their daily or professional life (such as [[Manuel Alegre]] or [[José Manuel Barroso]], who is known in Portugal by his double surname Durão Barroso). The use of more than two surnames in public life is less common, but not unusual (see [[Sophia de Mello Breyner Andresen]]).

One historic early aviator, [[Alberto Santos-Dumont]], is known to have not only often used an equals sign (=) between his two surnames in place of a hyphen, but also seems to have preferred that practice, to display equal respect for his father's French ethnicity and the Brazilian nationality of his mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Carroll F.|title=The 1906 Santos=Dumont No. 14bis |journal=World War I Aeroplanes |volume=194 |date=November 2006 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continental Germanic tradition==
{{further information|German surname}}
In [[Germany]] a double surname ({{lang-de|Doppelname}}) is generally joined with a single hyphen. Other types of double surnames are not accepted by German name law. However, exceptions are made for [[Immigration|immigrants]] and for marriages where the double surname already was the official name of one partner before marriage.{{citation needed|date=May 2009}}  A 1993 law forbids surnames with more than two components.&lt;ref name="time-ger-2009"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1896443,00.html |title=German Court Upholds Ban on Extra-Long Names |last=Kirchner |first=Stephanie |date=6 May 2009 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, it was permitted for adults (e.g., [[Simone Greiner-Petter-Memm]] and formerly [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann|Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann-Maier-Leibniz]]&lt;ref name="time-ger-2009" /&gt;) but their children would not inherit the name.&lt;ref name="time-ger-2009"/&gt; The 1993 ban was upheld by the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Constitutional Court]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="time-ger-2009" /&gt;  The crew members of the famous [[First World War]] [[light cruiser]] {{SMS|Emden|1908|6}} were allowed to add the name ''Emden'' with a hyphen to their surname as a special honour after World War I.

In [[Switzerland]] double surnames are traditionally written with a hyphen and combine the surnames of a married couple with the husband's surname in first place and the wife's second. This double name is called "alliance name" ({{lang-de|Allianzname}}). The first name as such, however, is the official family name, which will be inherited by their legitimate children. So, for example, if Werner Stauffacher is married to Gertrud Baumgarten, both can use the name Stauffacher-Baumgarten. Their children Heinrich and Verena, however, bear only the surname Stauffacher. Prominent bearers of an alliance name are [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]] (former Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs), [[Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf]] (former Federal Minister for Finance), and [[Johann Schneider-Ammann]] (Federal Minister for the Economy). Lately, based on feminist pressure, wives have been permitted by law to place their maiden name before the family name. This double name is written without a hyphen and is borne by the wife only. So, in the example above, the wife's name is Gertrud Baumgarten Stauffacher, while her husband's is Werner Stauffacher. Again, the children's names remain Heinrich and Verena Stauffacher.

Doubling of surnames is also practised by the Dutch. An example is the name of Dutch footballer [[Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink]]. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', his name derives from "the 17th century, when two farming families in the Enschede area of the Netherlands intermarried. Both the Vennegoor and Hesselink names carried equal social weight, and so – rather than choose between them – they chose to use both. 'Of' in Dutch translates to 'or', which means that a strict translation of his name reads Jan Vennegoor or Hesselink."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/aug/04/theknowledge.sport|title=Why is Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink so named?|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paolo Bandini|title=Lost and found in the international wilderness|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/theknowledge/story/0,,1860441,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=30 August 2006|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these Dutch surnames also survive in South Africa, for example, the rugby player [[Rohan Janse van Rensburg]]'s surname is Janse van Rensburg, not only van Rensburg (which is itself an existing surname).

==Scandinavia==
{{further information|Scandinavian surnames}}
[[Denmark]] has a tradition of double surnames originating in the 19th century. This was a result of two [[Naming law|naming acts]] obliging commoners to adopt heritable surnames, passed first for the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] in 1771, and then for [[Denmark proper]] in 1828. Most people chose their patronymic as their heritable surname, resulting in an overwhelming dominance of a few surnames.

In order to avoid the risk of mistaken identity, many Danes started using their mothers' [[maiden name]]s as a heritable [[middle name]] (similar to the Russian or [[Spanish naming customs|Hispanic system]]), rather than as a second [[given name]] (as in the [[English name|Anglo-Saxon system]]). One such case in point is the fact that three successive [[Prime Minister of Denmark|prime ministers of Denmark]] all share the same last name, [[Rasmussen]], and so they are usually referred to by their middle name, viz. [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen|Nyrup]], [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen|Fogh]] and [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen|Løkke]], respectively.

Today, however, the order of the names invariably places the patronymic ''-sen'' at the end, regardless of whether that name has been passed down by the father or mother, or adopted through marriage. Unlike in the Russian or Hispanic systems, this surname-style middle name is not considered a proper last name in official documents, unless [[hyphenated]] into one compound name.

==Poland==
{{further information|Polish name}}
In [[Poland]] a double surname ({{lang-pl|nazwisko złożone}}) is generally joined with a hyphen and by law includes only one hyphen. Polish surnames (''nazwisko'' (N. sg.)), like those in most of Europe, are hereditary and generally [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]], i.e., passed from the father on to his children. A married woman usually adopts her husband's name. However, other combinations are legally possible. The wife may keep her [[maiden name]] (''nazwisko panieńskie'') or add her husband's surname to hers, thus creating a double name (''nazwisko złożone''). A married man can also adopt his wife's surname, or add it to his. Polish triple-barreled surnames are known to exist; an example is the one borne by Ludwik Kos-Rabczewicz-Zubkowski, a university professor and writer, living in Canada.

==Russia==
In Russia, double-barreled surnames are somewhat uncommon, but normal and accepted practice, often associated with some families of note wishing to preserve both of their lineages. Federal law #143-FZ "On Civil State Acts" explicitly allows double-barreled names in its Article 28, but limits such compound surnames to two parts only.

==Turkish tradition==
Turkish tradition offers options to couples after the marriage for the naming conventions. Renewing the national identity card to reflect the naming changes has two options, one is to use man's surname for the newly formed family's surname, the second is to use two surnames for the family noting that one is the bride's maiden name, the latter is the groom's surname. This highlights the equal importance of men and women in Turkish history, by giving legal opportunity to use whichever is preferable for partners. 

Another double-barreled naming custom in [[Turkey]], is that the grandfather of a newborn to give the first name, while the father of the newborn issues a middle name which is known as "Göbek Adı" in Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.tdk.gov.tr/ |title=Göbek Adı | author=Turkish Language Institute |publisher=TDK |date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "Gobek Adi" is the name that's been given to newborn while his/her umbilical cord is being cut. In the surname section, the tradition is to use the paternal heritage surname. For example; 
[[Cahit Sıtkı Tarancı]], [[Melih Cevdet Anday]], [[Falih Rıfkı Atay]] and so on.

==Recent developments==
Since the late 20th century, increasingly liberal legislation on the inheritance of legal surnames in many Western countries has led to the emergence of various non-traditional or ''ad hoc'' coinages of combined surnames.{{clarify|date=July 2015}}
For example, Hispanic American politician [[Antonio Villaraigosa|Antonio Villar]] and his wife Corina Raigosa adopted the "blended" surname ''Villaraigosa'' upon their marriage in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/politics/p/villaraigosa.htm |title=Corina Raigosa and Antonio Villaraigosa Marriage Profile |author=Sheri &amp; Bob Stritof|publisher=Marriage.about.com |date=2007-07-26 |accessdate=2009-04-26|ref=refAboutDotCom| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090607225044/http://marriage.about.com/od/politics/p/villaraigosa.htm| archivedate= 7 June 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, courts in member states of the [[European Union]] have refused to register children under the surname given according to a foreign naming tradition.&lt;ref&gt;
"For instance, in ''Garcia Avello'', a case in which Belgium refused to register children of dual nationality with the surname of both parents following the Spanish tradition [...] in ''Grunkin and Paul'' [... a German court] refused to recognize a child's double-barrelled surname as determined and registered in Denmark, where he lived, because the child was a German national."
Loïc Azoulai, ''The Question of Competence in the European Union'', OUP Oxford, 2014, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lzHLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA180  p. 180].
&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[France]] a practice abolished in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/doublehyphen-surname-law-gets-both-barrels-1861421.html |title=Double-hyphen surname law gets both barrels |last=Lichfield |first=John |date=8 January 2010 |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; was to use two consecutive hyphens &lt;nowiki&gt;--&lt;/nowiki&gt; (not the same as a "long hyphen" or [[dash]], or with a [[double hyphen]]) to distinguish between recently formed double surnames and ancient hyphenated family names ({{lang-fr|nom composé}}). The use of double surnames is legal but not customary. Children traditionally take on their father's surname (or, more recently, optionally their mother's).

In Canada, especially [[Quebec]], it is common for children born since the 1970s to bear both parents' surnames, with no established rules as to whether the father's or mother's name should come first. (In Quebec, under the provisions of the [[Civil Code of Quebec|Civil Code]] enacted in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/ministere/dossiers/code/code-a.htm A Short History of the Civil Code] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218072812/http://justice.gouv.qc.ca/english/ministere/dossiers/code/code-a.htm |date=2005-12-18 }}, Government of Quebec&lt;/ref&gt; both spouses must retain [[Maiden and married names|their original surnames upon marriage]].) This situation was frequent enough that naming laws had to be amended in the early 1990s when those with double surnames began to marry, and wished themselves to give their children double surnames. In such cases, any combination involving at most two elements of the father's or the mother's surname is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccq.lexum.com/ccq/en#!fragment/sec51/KGhhc2g6KGNodW5rxIVhbsSHb3JUZXh0OnNlYzUxKSxsZWZ0UMSNZU5vdGVJZDonJyxuxKZlc1F1ZXJ5xKvErXNjcm9sbEPEiMSKOiFuLMSXYXLEh8SzxLXEt8SsxYZlxYjEh1PEkHRCxLdSRUxFVkFOQ0UsdGFiOnRvYykp Section 51 of the Civil Code of Quebec], in [[LexUM]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-Western surname traditions==

A [[Chinese compound surname]] is a [[Chinese surname]] using more than one character. Many of these surnames derive from noble and official titles, professions, place names and other areas, to serve for a purpose. Some are originally non-Han, while others were created by joining two one-character family names. Only a few of these names (e.g. Ouyang, Shangguan, Sima, Situ) survive in modern times. Many clans eventually took on a single-character surname for various reasons. A small minority of Koreans and Vietnamese also have compound surnames.
In 2007, PRC officials suggested that parents should be encouraged to create two-syllable (two-character)  surnames for  their children by combining their  parents' (one-syllable) surnames; this could make people's names more unique, and "could help solve the problem of widely recurring names".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2007-12/12/content_7234658.htm Name game: most Chinese use 3 characters, some use 10 or more], Xinhua, 2007-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], double surnames are comparatively common, especially in Bengal, examples including Roy Chaudhury (sometimes written as Chowdhury), Ghosh Dastidar, Das Gupta, Dutta Roy, etc.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. In recent years, a few notable married women have been keeping their maiden surnames resulting in a double-barred name such as [[Arati Ankalikar-Tikekar]], [[Padmaja Phenany Joglekar]]. 

The [[Filipino name|Filipino naming tradition]] is derived from the Hispanic system, but was influenced by the American (Anglo-Saxon) naming tradition when the Philippines became  a [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|United States colony]] in 1901.
A child customarily will carry the mother's maiden name as his middle name and carry the father's surname. When the female marries, she keeps her maiden surname and adds the husband's surname, but does not typically hyphenate it. So, when Maria Santos Aguon marries José Lujan Castro, her name becomes Maria Aguon Castro and their children will typically carry the middle name Aguon, and the surname Castro.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In [[Nigeria]], a double barrelled surname is adopted when an aristocratic woman marries a lower ranked man. It also occurs when a ruling family adopts the forename of their patriarch as part of their surname in order to distinguish themselves from others that might share their surname. An example of the former is that of the Vaughan-Richards family, a branch of the family of the American emancipated slave [[Scipio Vaughan]], who maintain their mother's last name as well as their father's. An example of the latter is that of the royal family of King [[Adeniji Adele]] of Lagos, who are distinguished from their numerous Adele cousins by the use of the double barrelled name ''Adeniji-Adele''.

'''Dorothea Elizabeth Irving, Lady Brunner''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]], [[Justice of the Peace|JP]] (14 April 1904 &amp;ndash; 9 January 2003) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] actress, the daughter of actors [[H. B. Irving]] and [[Dorothea Baird]], and the granddaughter of [[Victorian era]] stage star [[Henry Irving]]. Her older brother was the [[Hollywood]] [[Scenic design|set designer]] and [[art director]] [[Laurence Irving (set designer)|Laurence Irving]]. Elizabeth Irving was the Chairman of the National Federation of [[Women's Institute]]s (W.I.) and in 1955 founded the ''[[Keep Britain Tidy]]'' Group, acting as President of the Group for 19 years from 1966.
== Life ==
Born at 1 [[Upper Woburn Place]], London, in 1904, Dorothea Elizabeth Irving usually went by her middle name of Elizabeth. She was educated at home, at [[South Hampstead High School]] and, when the family moved to [[Oxford]] in 1916, at [[Oxford High School (Oxford)|Oxford High School]], before moving to [[Wycombe Abbey School]]. Irving left school at 16 to study acting in Oxford and London, making her stage debut aged 12 in ''[[The Bells (play)|The Bells]]'', in which her father had a leading role. Her early roles as an adult actress were as Titania in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[The Pretenders (play)|The Pretenders]]'' and in [[George du Maurier]]'s ''[[Trilby (novel)|Trilby]]''. She also had a role in  [[A. V. Bramble]]'s  silent film version of [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s ''[[Shirley (novel)|Shirley]]'' (1922).&lt;ref name=tele&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1420228/Elizabeth-Lady-Brunner.html Obituary in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' 28 January 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

She married Sir [[Felix John Morgan Brunner]], 3rd [[Baronet|Bt]]. (1897–1982), a businessman and the son of Sir John Fowler Brunner, 2nd Bt. and Lucy Marianne Vaughan Morgan, on 8 July 1926. They had five sons. After her marriage Irving gave up acting, and became Lady Brunner in 1929 on the death of her husband's father, the 2nd [[baronet]].&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; She held the office of [[Justice of the Peace]] (J.P.) for Oxfordshire in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage &amp; Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), volume 1, page 556&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 they bought [[Greys Court]] in [[Oxfordshire]], and donated the house to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in 1969 but continued to live there.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

From 1951 to 1956 she was the Chairman of the National Federation of [[Women's Institute]]s (W.I.) and in 1955 founded the [[Keep Britain Tidy]] Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keepbritaintidy.org/AboutUs/OurHistory/Default.aspx History of the ''Keep Britain Tidy'' Campaign]&lt;/ref&gt; She was President of the group for 19 years from 1966, after which she was its senior vice-president. She was appointed an [[Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (O.B.E.) in 1964 for her work with the [[Keep Britain Tidy]] Campaign.  She was the Chairman of the Women's Group on Public Welfare for ten years from 1960, and Chairman of the Henley and District Housing Trust.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Shirley Anglesey, ‘Brunner , (Dorothea) Elizabeth, Lady Brunner (1904–2003)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, online edn, Oxford University Press, Jan 2007; online edn, Jan 2009 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/88723, accessed 3 March 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1968 to 1971 she was a member of the General Advisory Council of the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name=tele/&gt; The Brunner Buildings at [[Denman College]], the [[Women's Institute]]'s own Residential Adult Education College near Oxford, are named after her.

Elizabeth Lady Brunner died of heart failure at her home, [[Greys Court]], in [[Rotherfield Greys]], [[Oxfordshire]] on 9 January 2003 aged 98.

One of her three surviving sons is Sir [[Hugo Brunner]] [[Royal Victorian Order|KCVO]] [[Justice of the Peace|JP]], [[Lord Lieutenant]] of [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]], between 1996 and 2008. He edited her posthumous account of her childhood to the point when she made her stage debut and published it, with a summary of the rest of her life, in 2010 as ''Child of the Theatre'' (Perpetua Press, Oxford).

While working on his accounts one evening in 1551, Hall heard a voice telling him that "the daye draweth nere", and saw a vision of the [[Five Wounds of Christ]]. He dismissed it as a dream until an angel appeared to him the following year when he was seriously ill in bed. The angel told Hall that he was "elect and chosen of God to declare and pronounce unto his people his worde",{{r|ODNB}} whereupon Hall found himself lifted from his sickbed and taken on a two-day visit to Heaven and Hell.{{sfnp|Glinert|2009|p=16|ps=none}} In about 1557–8 Hall began work on his ''The Visions of Elizeus Hall in Metre'', a collection of all his visions that he wrote while on his knees, along with a shorter work he referred to as "his booke of obedience"; there are no extant copies of either book.{{r|ODNB}}

Hall travelled from Manchester to London in 1562, where he proclaimed himself "a mesenger sente from godde to the Quene &amp; to all princes". He was interrogated and examined several times during his stay in London, and was denounced in a sermon given by James Pilkington, the Bishop of Durham. After delivering a warning and admonition from God to Edmund Grindel, the Bishop of London, Hall was examined by Grindel on 12 June 1562. For harbouring "popishe Judgement in religion", failing to receive communion, and for holding Catholic views on [[purgatory]] and [[transubstantiation]], Hall was [[pillory|pilloried]] in [[Cheapside]] on 26 June and subsequently incarcerated in [[Bridewell Palace|Bridewell Prison]], where he died in 1565.{{r|ODNB}}

'''Ghezo''' or '''Gezo''' was [[King of Dahomey|King]] of the [[Kingdom of Dahomey|Dahomey]], in present-day [[Benin]], from 1818 until 1858. Ghezo replaced his brother [[Adandozan]] (who ruled from 1797 to 1818) as king through a [[coup d'état|coup]] with the assistance of the [[Brazilians|Brazilian]] slave trader [[Francisco Félix de Sousa]]. He ruled over the kingdom during a tumultuous period, punctuated by the [[British Empire|British]] blockade of the ports of Dahomey in order to stop the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Ghezo finally ended Dahomey's [[tributary state|tributary]] status to the [[Oyo empire]] but also dealt with significant domestic dissent and pressure from the British to end the slave trade. He promised to end the slave trade in 1852, but resumed slave efforts in 1857 and 1858. Ghezo died in 1858, possibly assassinated, and his son [[Glele]] became the new king.

==Rise to power==
Ghezo was a son born with the name Gakpe to [[Agonglo|King Agonglo]] and was a younger brother to [[Adandozan]]. When Agonglo died, there was a succession struggle between his sons before Adandozan was enthroned.  An oral tradition which developed during Ghezo's rule to largely erase Adandozan from official history says that Adandozan was merely named regent and that he refused to step down for Ghezo when the latter was old enough, but this is generally doubted by historians.&lt;ref name=Bay&gt;{{cite book|title=Wives of the Leopard: Gender, Politics, and Culture in the Kingdom of Dahomey|first=Edna G.|last= Bay|publisher= University of Virginia Press|year= 1998|isbn=0-8139-1792-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Information about the final years of Adandozan's administration is very limited, providing only a partial understanding of the situation that resulted in Ghezo's rule. What is known is that around 1818, Adandozan imprisoned [[Francisco Félix de Sousa]], a powerful Afro-Brazilian slave trader, when the latter demanded repayment for money loaned to Adandozan. With the help, reportedly, of Nicola d'Olveira, the son of the Afro-Dutch wife of Agonglo, de Sousa escaped from imprisonment and relocated to [[Grand-Popo]].&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt; While in exile, de Sousa sent gifts and money to Ghezo that Ghezo used to establish support for a challenge to the throne.  In the 1818 [[Annual Customs of Dahomey|Annual Customs]], it is said that Ghezo appeared holding the war drum in the palace and upon seeing this the ''Migan'' and ''Mehu'' (prime ministers) removed the royal sandals from Adandozan and named Ghezo the king.&lt;ref name=Akinjogbin&gt;{{cite book|last=Akinjogbin|first=I.A.|title=Dahomey and Its Neighbors: 1708-1818|year=1967|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite likely that the initial struggle was more violent than this story relates.&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt; According to some versions, Ghezo was not named the ruler at this point, but instead the regent to rule until Adandozan's son Dakpo was old enough to rule. The story says that this lasted until 1838 when Ghezo instead named his son, the future king [[Glele]], as the crown prince, and at that point Dakpo and Adandozan led a brief fight within the palaces. The fight resulted in a fire that burned part of a palace and killed Dakpo, making Ghezo the clear king of Dahomey.&lt;ref name=Araujo&gt;{{cite book|last=Araujo|first=Ana Lucia|title=Public Memory of Slavery: Victims and Perpetrators in the South Atlantic|year=2010|publisher=Cambria Press|location=Amherst, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rule==
Ghezo's rule was defined by some important military victories, domestic dissent, and transformation of the slave trade economy. Ghezo's rule is often remembered as one of the most significant in terms of reform and change to the political order of the kingdom (although some of this is ascribing reforms that happened under Adandozan to Ghezo as part of the erasure of Adandozan's rule). In addition to the military victories, domestic dissent, and slave trade, Ghezo is also credited with expanding the arts significantly and giving royal status to many artisans to move to the capital of Abomey.&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt;

===Military expansion===
[[File:Dahomey amazon2.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Dahomey Amazons]] became a significant part of the military under Ghezo]]
His most significant military victory was over the depleted [[Oyo empire]] in 1823.&lt;ref name=Law-1986&gt;{{cite journal|last=Law|first=Robin|title=Dahomey and the Slave Trade: Reflections on the Historiography of the Rise of Dahomey|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1986|volume=27|issue=2|pages=237–267|doi=10.1017/s0021853700036665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1730, Dahomey had provided yearly tribute to the Oyo empire and some of its economic and military policy was controlled by Oyo interests. However, the Oyo empire had been significantly weakened over the previous 30 years and, with the rise of the Islamic jihad to the north in the [[Sokoto Caliphate]], the empire was unable to secure its tribute from Dahomey.&lt;ref name=Akinjogbin /&gt; In the early 1820s, Ghezo refused to pay the annual tribute to Oyo.&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt; Oyo and Dahomey fought a small war early in the 1820s but violence escalated in 1823 when Oyo sent an ambassador to demand tribute and Ghezo killed him.&lt;ref name=Law-1977&gt;{{cite book|last=Law|first=Robin|title=The Oyo Empire c. 1600-c. 1836: A West African Imperialism in the Era of the Atlantic Slave Trade|year=1977|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Oyo responded by organizing a force made up of the [[Mahi people|Mahi]] and other regional forces to attack Dahomey. Ghezo defeated these forces at a battle near [[Paouingnan]]. Oyo then sent a larger force that was 4,000 strong with a cavalry and camped near the village of Kpaloko.  Ghezo defeated this force by organizing a night raid which resulted in the death of the Oyo leader, Ajanaku, and caused the Oyo troops to retreat.&lt;ref name=Law-1977 /&gt;

Although the victory over the Oyo were important, other military engagements were less effective in the early years of Ghezo's reign. He suffered losses to the [[Mahi people]] to the north of Dahomey and was unable to secure enough individuals to meet slave demands, leading him to sell citizens of Dahomey, a quite unpopular decision.&lt;ref name=Law-1997&gt;{{cite journal|last=Law|first=Robin|title=The Politics of Commercial Transition: Factional Conflict in Dahomey in the Context of the Ending of the Atlantic Slave Trade|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1997|volume=38|issue=2|pages=213–233|doi=10.1017/s0021853796006846|url=http://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/280/1/politics-of-commercial-transition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the further reduction of Oyo power in the region, Ghezo was more able to expand militarily against the Mahi and the [[Gbe languages|Gbe]] people to the southwest of Dahomey after the mid-1820s.&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt; Following victories in these areas, Ghezo focused the military power on a region which had been between the Oyo empire and Dahomey and had been the target of significant slave raiding. After some significant victories in this area by Dahomey, the city of [[Abeokuta]] was founded as a safe-haven for people to be free of slave raiding in an easily defended location.&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt; By the 1840s, Abeokuta had become a major power in the area and wars between Abeokuta and Dahomey became regular.

In 1849-50, British naval officer Frederick E. Forbes went on two missions to the court of King Ghezo "in an unsuccessful attempt to convince him to end involvement in the slave trade."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1851, Ghezo organized a direct attack on the city of Abeokuta, but it did not succeed. Ghezo suspended large-scale military operations when he ended the slave trade (1852). However, by 1858 a conservative faction pressured Ghezo to begin large-scale military operations again with an assault on Abeokuta to follow.&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt; It is possible that this renewed warfare between the two states led to Ghezo's death, with some accounts claiming that Abeokuta paid for an assassination of Ghezo (other accounts disagree).&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt;

Ghezo is credited with the formation of the [[Dahomey Amazons]] as an actual war fighting force. Although the female bodyguard for the king had existed for many kings, Ghezo is claimed often as the king who transformed them into a force for battle.&lt;ref name=Alpern&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alpern|first=Stanley B.|title=On the Origins of the Amazons of Dahomey|journal=History in Africa|year=1998|volume=25|pages=9–25|doi=10.2307/3172178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Edna Bay contends that this may have been a result of a need to gain the support of the female palace guard after they had opposed Ghezo's coup against Adandozan. Ghezo did this by raising the status of the female guards, providing them uniforms, giving them additional weapons, and making them a crucial part of war policy.&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt;

===Domestic dissent===
Domestic dissent was a significant problem throughout Ghezo's reign with different forces contesting his rule. Initially, after the coup against Adandozan, Ghezo had to secure support from a number of different individuals who helped bring him to power. Although he had initially presented himself as able to restore militaristic practices to Dahomey, which he argued Adandozan was unable to do, the early losses in his reign to the Mahi made him very unpopular. It is even reported that in 1825, he offered to return Adandozan to power but that Adandozan refused, hoping for a popular uprising against Ghezo.&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt;

To secure the support of different powerful people, Ghezo provided many of them with important positions. To secure the support of other princes, he appointed two of his brothers as the ''Migan'' and ''Mehu'' and transformed these into hereditary positions which they could pass to their sons.&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt; Since de Sousa was of crucial importance in Ghezo's rise to power, he named de Sousa the ''Chacha'' at Whydah, a position which would be the principal trade official in that port (and would also be passed to de Sousa's son).&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt; As a symbolic strike against Adandozan's legacy, Ghezo appointed Agontime his ''Kpojito'' (or queen-mother, an important post in the Kingdom of Dahomey). Agontime was a wife of Agonglo, sometimes claimed to be the mother of Ghezo, who was sold into slavery when Adandozan came to power because she supported a rival to the throne.&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt; According to some versions, Ghezo was able to secure her release from Brazil and bring her back to the kingdom, although evidence of this is not clear.&lt;ref name=Araujo /&gt;

When ending the slave trade became the crucial issue in the 1840s and 1850s, there developed two distinct factions which historian John C. Yoder has called the ''Elephant'' and the ''Fly'' parties.&lt;ref name=Yoder&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yoder|first=John C.|title=Fly and Elephant Parties: Political Polarization in Dahomey, 1840-1870|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1974|volume=15|issue=3|pages=417–432|doi=10.1017/s0021853700013566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghezo was the head of the Elephant faction which supported opposition to the British demands to end the slave trade and was supported by key officials and the representatives of de Sousa. The Fly faction, in contrast, supported ending the slave trade and accommodating British demands.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt; The Fly faction grew more powerful with the British naval blockade of 1852 and Ghezo eventually agreed to end the slave trade; however, the Elephant faction and the interests of de Souza's family remained important for the rest of his reign.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt; Historian Robin Law largely believes that the elite factionalism to Ghezo developed in 1856 when he had reduced the slave trade.  In that year, a faction for the resumption of the slave trade formed, headed by the ''Migan'' and ''Yovogan'' (governor of Whydah) which pushed Ghezo toward resuming the slave trade in 1857.&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt;

One additional way that Ghezo maintained domestic support was by lengthening the ceremony cycle in the 1850s with additions to the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey|Annual Customs]] including a ceremony for the palm oil trade, one to celebrate ending tribute to the Oyo empire, and one dedicated to Ghezo himself (but to the time when he was a prince).&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt;

==Slave trade==
[[File:The Door of No Return in Ouidah, November 2007.jpg|thumbnail|right|[The [[Door of No Return, Ouidah]]]]
As part of the British campaign to [[Abolitionism|abolish]] slavery, the British government began putting significant pressure on Ghezo in the 1840s to end the slave trade in Dahomey. Ghezo responded to these requests by emphasizing that he was unable to end the slave trade because of domestic pressure and instead proposed an expansion of palm oil trade.&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt; His domestic support had shifted as well with the declining power of Francisco Felix de Sousa and his death in 1849. The attempt at compromise with the palm oil trade was unable to be maintained following the defeat of Dahomey against Abeokuta and the establishment of a British naval blockade on the ports of Dahomey in 1851. By January 1852, Ghezo signed an agreement (along with both the ''Migan'' and the ''Mehu'') with the British.  The agreement specified that Ghezo was to end the slave trade from Dahomey.&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt; The British believed that Ghezo never implemented the provisions of this treaty, although he believed he did comply by stopping slave trade through Dahomey's ports even though he allowed slaves to be traded from Dahomey to other ports and then sold into the slave trade.&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt;

The decrease in the slave trade resulted in additional reforms during the last years of Ghezo's rule. He significantly reduced the wars and slave raids by the kingdom and in 1853 told the British that he reduced the practice of human sacrifice at the [[Annual Customs of Dahomey|Annual Customs]] (possibly ending sacrifice of war captives completely and only sacrificing convicted criminals).&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt; However, these positions were reversed dramatically in 1857 and 1858 as Ghezo became hostile to the British; he revived slave trade through the port of Whydah, and in 1858 attacked Abeokuta. The attack on Abeokuta was apparently resisted by Ghezo, but there was such significant domestic pressure for the attack that he allowed it to happen.&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt;

==Death and succession==
The details of Ghezo's death are different depending on the historical source. It is claimed that there was a prophecy made in the early 1850s that if Ghezo attacked the city of Ekpo, under the control of [[Abeokuta]], he would die as a result.  This may explain his resistance to the war against them in 1858.&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt; Regardless, he died very soon after the campaign in 1858. Various causes of death have been suggested, including poisoning by Dahomey priests upset at the ending of human sacrifice,&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt; smallpox,&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt; death in battle,&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt; and assassination by a sniper hired by Abeokuta.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt;

During the last years of his life, his heir [[Glele]] became the leader of the conservative faction that wanted the resumption of the slave trade. Glele was the official heir, but he was not the oldest son;&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt; he was challenged in his attempt to rule but was supported by the conservative faction.&lt;ref name=Bay /&gt; Many of the reforms attempted by Ghezo were partially undermined by Glele, who began slave trading, warfare, and human sacrifice to some extent.&lt;ref name=Law-1997 /&gt;

News of his death was carried in American newspapers, with reports stating that 400 captives were murdered in honor of him.

==Popular culture==
Ghezo is featured in the novel ''[[Flash for Freedom!]]'' by [[George MacDonald Fraser]].
He is also mentioned in the historical novel Segu, which mentions a prophecy stating that he would die of smallpox.

'''Harriet Jane Hanson Robinson''' (February 8, 1825 – December 22, 1911), who worked as a bobbin [[doffer]] in a [[Massachusetts]] cotton mill as a child, was involved in a worker's strike, became a poet and author and played an important role in the [[women's suffrage]] movement in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Babitskaya|2012}}

==Early childhood==

Harriet was the daughter of Harriet Browne Hanson and William Hanson, a carpenter. Both parents were descended from early English settlers, but without distinguished ancestors. Her elder brother was [[John Wesley Hanson]] (1823–1901),{{efn|[[John Wesley Hanson]] was to become prominent in the [[Universalism]] movement and author of several books on the subject.{{sfn|Hanson|1885|pp=214ff}}}} and she had two surviving younger brothers, Benjamin and William. Harriet's father died when she was six, leaving his widow to support four young children.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=9}}

Harriet's mother was determined to keep her family together, despite the difficulty in doing so.  Harriet later recalled, in her autobiography ''Loom and Spindle'' {{harv|Hanson Robinson|1898}}, her mother's response when a neighbour offered to adopt Harriet so that her mother had one less mouth to feed: "No; while I have one meal of victuals a day, I will not part with my children."  She later wrote that her mother's words on that occasion stuck with her "because of the word '[[wikt:victuals#English|victuals]]{{'"}} whose meaning she wondered about for a long time thereafter.{{sfn|Gale|2006}}{{sfn|Hanson Robinson|1898|p=26}}

Initially, Mrs. Hanson ran a small store in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], which sold food, candy, and firewood.  The family lived in the back room of the shop, all sharing one bed "two at the foot and three at the head" as Harriet was later to recall.{{sfn|Hanson Robinson|1898|p=27}}{{sfn|Gale|2006}}
At the invitation of Harriet's maternal aunt, Angeline Cudworth, also a widow, the family moved to [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], a center of the textile industry.{{sfn|Hanson Robinson|1898|p=28}}{{sfn|Gale|2006}}
Lowell was a planned factory town.  Under the [[Lowell System]], the company recruited young farm girls to work in the mills, building dormitories where they could live at low rents, and hiring matrons to monitor the social conduct of the girls. The company arranged for cultural events, bible studies and other educational opportunities. Initially, the pay was appealing to the women, as the alternative employment, domestic work and teaching, paid only about one-sixth as much as the mills&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminism: The Essential Historical Writings|last=Schneir|first=Miriam|publisher=|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=49–57|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, working conditions were often poor and unsafe and wages low, leading to a strike in 1834.{{sfn|McNeese|2003|p=64}}
Mrs. Hanson obtained a job running a boarding house for a textile mill company in Lowell.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=xii}}

== Mill worker ==
[[File:Lowell, Massachusetts - Project Gutenberg eText 16960.png|thumb|300px|[[Lowell, Massachusetts]] in the early 1800s]]
At the age of ten, Harriet started to work in the Lowell mills.
By her own account, she wanted to work so she could earn money for herself, 
and the experience was good for her.  However, there may have been an element of necessity since her mother earned little money from running the boarding house.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=13}}
Her job, which paid $2 per week, was as a "doffer", replacing full bobbins with empty ones.
The job took only a quarter of each hour, and during the free periods the children could play or read or even go home for a while.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=14}}

In 1836, the [[Lowell Mill Girls]] organized their second strike, or "turn out" as they called them.  The first strike had been in 1834 over a 15% cut in wages.  This second strike was over an increase in board charges that was equivalent to a 12.5% cut in wages.  To Harriet, aged eleven, it was her first strike.{{sfn|Danzer|2006|p=243–244}}{{sfn|Gale|2006}}  In her autobiography, she recounted it with pride:{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=26}}{{sfn|Gale|2006}}

{{quote|text=When the day came on which the girls were to turn out, those in the upper rooms started first, and so many of them left that our mill was at once shut down.  Then, when the girls in my room stood irresolute, uncertain what to do, asking each other, "Would you?" or "Shall we turn out?" and not one of them having the courage to lead off, I, who began to think they would not go out, after all their talk, became impatient, and started on ahead, saying, with childish bravado, "I don't care what you do, I am going to turn out, whether any one else does or not"; and I marched out, and was followed by the others.|sign={{harvnb|Hanson Robinson|1898|pp=84–85}}{{efn|[[Claudia Lauper Bushman]] observes that Harriet's account of the strike she experienced when she was a child grew in the telling over the years.  Although it didn't differ in the facts, the story that Harriet told in her fifties of the same incident was less embellished than the account given in her later autobiography, and also less embellished than when she related it at the [[International Council of Women]] in Washington D.C. in 1888, impressing at least one newspaper reporter who interviewed her at the time.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=27}} Bushman comments that, through her linking the incident, in her autobiography, to the cause of women's suffrage that she didn't actually take up until much older, Harriet effectively wrote herself a place in history, where she has become credited as a pioneer and leader at an early age in the women's suffage movement.  However, Harriet's room was just one of over 200 such mill rooms — there being nearly two thousand strikers in all — in many of which girls and women who would have taken similar action in the face of indecisiveness; and, even by Harriet's own account, this act of "childish bravado" was all that she did of note in a month-long strike.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=26–27}}}}}}

[[File:Boott Boardinghouse Store.jpg|thumb|[[Boott Mills]] boardinghouse and storehouse, Lowell]]
Harriet was harming her own mother by striking, since her mother would have benefited from the increase in boarding charges. 
Harriet was not to realize this until she was older.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=26}}{{sfn|Gale|2006}}  
As a consequence of the strike, several of the mills reversed the increase in charges, and the boarding system was reviewed, on the grounds that — it being the principal inducement for young women and girls to come and work at the mills in the first place — if they were so dissatisfied with it as to strike then it was not having its desired effect.{{sfn|Danzer|2006|p=244}}{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=26}}  But the strike leaders were fired from their jobs, as was Harriet's mother, which Harriet depicted in her autobiography as an act of petty revenge for Harriet's own actions.{{sfn|Danzer|2006|p=244}}{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=28}}

Harriet continued to work in the mills after the strike was over, graduating to tending a spinning frame and then becoming a "drawing-in girl", one of the better jobs in the mill.{{sfn|Hanson Robinson|1898|p=39}}
The drawing room was relatively quiet, away from the spinning and weaving machinery.
The drawing-in girl took over after the warp threads had been wound onto the take-up beam, and drew each thread through the harness and reeds using a long metal hook.
She could sit on a stool or a chair as she worked.
Once this was complete, the beam would be delivered to the weaving room.{{sfn|Peterson|Miller|2003|p=189-190}}
The pay was on a piecework basis, so Harriet could work at her own pace, and during periods when the looms were operating could
find a quiet room away from the machinery where she could read.{{sfn|Gale|2006}}

==Education==
[[File:Lowell Offering 1.jpg|thumb|''Lowell Offering'' number 1, 1840. "Wholly written by females employed in the mills"]]
Harriet obtained an elementary education before starting work in the mill.
While working as a doffer, she also attended evening classes.
At the age of fifteen she left the mills for two years to study French, Latin and English grammar and composition at Lowell High School, 
studying in a wooden school room in a building that had a butcher's shop on the ground floor.
The titles of two of her compositions have survived: "Poverty Not Disgraceful" and "Indolence and Industry", 
reflecting her opinion that there was nothing wrong with the honest labor of poor people.
Harriet returned to the mills, working there until 1848, but in her spare time participated in literary groups in Lowell.{{sfn|Gale|2006}}

Lowell was rich in educational and cultural opportunities for women at that time.
There were libraries and bookstores, evening schools and lectures, concerts and balls.
Two of the first magazines written by women were published in the town, the ''[[Lowell Offering]]'' and ''The New England Offering''.  
[[Betsey Guppy Chamberlain]] (1797–1886), one of Harriet's companions in the mills, became a noted contributor of sketches and stories to the ''Lowell Offering''.{{sfn|Ranta|2003|p=xii}}
Harriet said that "the fame of ''The Lowell Offering'' caused the mill girls to be considered very desirable for wives; and that young men came from near and far to pick and choose for themselves, and generally with good success."{{sfn|Ranta|2003|p=53}}
Harriet also wrote and published poetry, and it was through this that she met her future husband William Robinson, who was working as an editor at the ''Lowell Journal'', which published some of her work.{{sfn|Gale|2006}}

==Marriage==

Harriet married [[William Stevens Robinson]] (1818–1876) on [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]] of 1848, when she was twenty-three.
Also from a poor background, Robinson was a writer for a newspaper and a supporter of the [[Free Soil Party]], 
which opposed the expansion of slavery into the western territories.  This made it hard for him to keep a job.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=xiii}}
During the early years of her marriage, Harriet was not interested in women's rights.
In her early writings she described the pleasure of having a husband to handle worldly problems, 
while her job was to take care of him, and said that for this reason she did not want to vote.   
Harriet later adopted the women's rights cause after her husband had taken it up.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=xiv}}
The couple were to have four children, one of whom died young, and also looked after Harriet's mother.
Often they struggled to make ends meet.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=xiii}}

In 1858 the couple moved to [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]], a new residential suburb five miles from [[Boston]], buying a house two blocks from the railway station.
This was to be Harriet's home for the rest of her life.
At first, Robinson struggled to earn a living as a journalist.{{sfn|Marsh|1990|p=44}}
They had a large garden where they grew fruit and vegetables, and made some money by raising chickens and selling the eggs.
After the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], for eleven years from 1862 Robinson held a well-paying job as clerk of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]].{{sfn|Marsh|1990|p=45}}
In 1868 Harriet joined the American Woman's Suffrage Organization led by [[Lucy Stone]], and founded the Malden women's club.{{sfn|Marsh|1990|p=48}}
Robinson was forced out of his job by the politician [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], and in 1876 died after a long illness.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=xiii}}

Her daughter [[Elizabeth Robinson Abbott|Elizabeth]] was considered to be a pioneer in introducing kindergarten to Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=zXEEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA2 |title=A Woman of the Century: Fourteen Hundred-seventy Biographical Sketches Accompanied by Portraits of Leading American Women in All Walks of Life |page=2 |last=Willard |first=Frances Elizabeth |author2=Livermore, Mary Ashton Rice |year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions in Later Years==

As a widow, Harriet Robinson rented out rooms to support herself, her three daughters and her aged mother. She wrote several books, including a biography of her husband, and became increasingly active in the women's suffrage movement.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=xiii}} 
Harriet's book ''Loom and Spindle'' (1898) portrayed the industrial town of Lowell in her childhood and youth as a time of great opportunity for mill girls, who learned the discipline of labor and gained broader ideas about the world from their experiences. The book continues to be read more than one hundred years after it was published.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|pp=xv–xvi}}

[[File:Susan Brownell Anthony older years.png|thumb|Susan B. Anthony]]
Harriet and her daughter Harriet Lucy Robinson Shattuck organized the National Woman Suffrage Association of Massachusetts, associated with [[Susan B. Anthony]]'s organization, and Harriet Robinson made the opening address at the 1881 Boston Convention of the organization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They also helped [[Julia Ward Howe]] to organize the [[New England Women's Club]].{{sfn|Emerson|Edwards|Knox|2000|p=82}} Harriet Robinson corresponded extensively with the suffrage movement leaders [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] and Susan B. Anthony.{{sfn|Stanton|Gordon|2006|pp=vii ff}} When the National Woman Suffrage Association opened on 26 May 1881 at the Tremont Temple in Boston, Harriet Robinson welcomed the delegates and guests.{{sfn|Stanton|Gordon|2006|p=68}} At this session she offered the following resolution: "''Whereas'', We believe that it is not safe to trust the great question of woman's political rights solely to the legislature, or to the voters of the state, therefore ''Resolved'', That it is the duty of the women of Massachusetts to organize an active work, to secure a sixteenth amendment to the United States Constitution."{{sfn|Stanton|Gordon|2006|p=70}} Harriet Robinson wrote enthusiastically in 1881,

{{quote|Never, in the history of civilization, has woman held the political, legal or social position that she does in Massachusetts today!  New avenues of employment for her capacity are constantly being opened, and in every department of public trust to which she has been promoted, she has shown her ability.  In this first hour of woman's triumph, it only remains for her to keep what she has gained and use faithfully the new privileges which have come into her life ... Trained leaders are needed—women strong of purpose, who are willing to confront the public as presiding officers, or as public speakers, and to guide wisely the large masses of their sex who have not yet learned to think for themselves ...{{sfn|Emerson|Edwards|Knox|2000|p=78-79}}}}

Harriet never took a theoretical position on women's rights, and may have been largely motivated by an ambition to advance in society, which the movement offered. However, she became a formidable advocate of suffrage in her writings and as a public speaker.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=xiv}}

The poet [[Lucy Larcom]], a friend of Harriet who had also worked in the mills as a child, wrote of her, "Mrs. Robinson is deeply interested in all the movements, which tend to the advancement of women, and uses her pen and her voice freely in their behalf. She was the first woman to speak before the Select Committee on Woman Suffrage in Congress, and has spoken for the cause before the legislature of her own State, where she is not only a citizen, but a vote as far as the law allows."{{sfn|Babitskaya|2012|p=5}}

Additionally, Harriet contributed to the fourteenth annual report of the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor (published in 1883).The following is an excerpt from this annual report, written by Harriet Robinson:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They [the mill girls] went forth from their ''Alma Mater'', the Lowell Factory, carrying with them the independence, the self-reliance taught in that hard school, and they have done their little part towards performing the useful labor of life. Into whatever vocation they entered they have made practical use of the habits of industry and perseverance learned during those early years. Skilled labor teaches something not to be found in books or in colleges. Their early experience developed their characters ... and helped them to fight well the battle of life.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Harriet lived to the age of eighty-six, dying at home in Malden on 22 December 1911.{{sfn|Bushman|1981|p=xiii}}

'''Ida Bagus Made Poleng''' (1915–1999) was a traditional Balinese painter. Known also as Ida Bagus Made Poleng or Ida Bagus Made Tebesaya or simply Gus Made.

== Biography ==

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:IBM Family Tree.jpg|thumb|right|Ida Bagus Made's Family Tree]] --&gt;
He was born in Tebasaya, [[Ubud]], [[Bali]] in 1915. Ida Bagus Made came from a Brahman family of accomplished artists in Tampaksiring, Bali. His Father, Ida Bagus kembeng (1897–1952), was a well-known painter who won the prestigious Silver Medal in 1937 at the International Colonial Art Exposition in Paris. Ida Bagus Made first learned painting and carving from his father. He later studied painting under the guidance of [[Rudolf Bonnet]]. Bonnet once wrote that Ida Bagus Made was one of the most talented artist in Bali.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Bonnet, ''Beeldende Kunst in Gianjar'', Djawa, Vol. 6, 1936&lt;/ref&gt; He was in his teens when the modernization of [[Balinese art]] began in the late 1920s, and only 21 years old when he joined the prestigious Pitamaha Artist Guild, founded in 1936 to preserve Balinese art from the threat of tourism and commercialism.

His father, Ida Bagus Kembeng had two wives: Jero Deblog and Ida Ayu Rai. Ida Bagus Made was a child from his second wife. From his marriage with Jero Deblog, Ida Bagus Kembeng had two sons: Ida Bagus Putu Wiri and Ida Bagus Made Belawa. With Ida Ayu Rai, Kembeng had a daughter, Ida Ayu Oka, and two sons: Ida Bagus Made Poleng and Ida Bagus Nyoman Raka. 

Ida Bagus Made was married to Gusti Niang and had one daughter, Ida Ayu Sadri. Since Ida Bagus Made did not have a son, he adopted Ida Bagus Pudja, a son of his half brother, Ida Bagus Belawa.

He was known by the Balinese as a ritual specialist for carving sacred masks imbued with magical powers for the surrounding temples of [[Ubud]]. As a traditional painter of the Pitamaha generation, he became known worldwide for his artistic mastery.

Ida Bagus Made was a prolific painter who had a profound distrust of art dealers and collectors.&lt;ref name="M"&gt;Moerdowo,'' Reflections on Balinese Traditional and Modern Arts'', Balai Pustaka (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Vickers, Hartanto and Dwikora, ''Ida Bagus Made: Mata Air Campuhan Masa Silam'', Darga Gallery (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; He scrutinized his admirers and only a handful of collectors passed his test. The late Indonesian President [[Sukarno]] was one of such collectors that Ida Bagus Made revered. His works are well sought after and are in the collection of many museums in the world.

He died after an illness in 1999. In 2000, following the artist’s last wish, the widow of Ida Bagus Made loaned over 100 paintings from the artist’s private collection to the [[Museum Puri Lukisan|Puri Lukisan Museum]] for safekeeping.&lt;ref name="HJ"&gt;Kaja McGowan, ''Suaranya Gong Kebyar: The Balinese Art of Ida Bagus Made'', Exhibition Catalog, Herbert Johnson Museum, Cornell University (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==
Ida Bagus Made's paintings are some of the best examples of the Ubud school from the Pitamaha generation, and have not been surpassed by younger painters.&lt;ref name="M"/&gt; His paintings have been acquired by prestigious institutions all over the world, including the United Nations, the Royal Tropical Institute Museum (Amsterdam) and the Royal Ethnographic Museum (Leiden). In Indonesia, his paintings are in the collections of former President Sukarno, the Museum Puri Lukisan, the Neka Museum, the Agung Rai Museum of Art, the Bentara Budaya Museum, and many others.&lt;ref name="McGowan-The_Art_of_Devotion"&gt;

== Exhibitions ==
Before the [[Second World War]], his paintings were included in many touring exhibitions organized by the Pitamaha Artist Guild. Exhibitions were held in the ''Kunst-ring'' (Art Circle) of Batavia (1936, 1937, 1939); Bandung (1936, 1938); Tegal (1938); Medan, Palembang and Surabaya (1939).&lt;ref name="JC"&gt;Jean Couteau, ''Museum Puri Lukisan'', Ratna Wartha Foundation (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1945, he stopped participating in any exhibitions. Not until 1998 that he gave a blessing to a solo exhibition organized by Darga Gallery (Sanur, Ubud). The exhibition (14 March - 14 April 1998) featured paintings from the Neka Museum, The Agung Rai Museum of Art and of a handful private collectors. Ida Bagus Made attended the opening of the exhibition. A short catalog, entitled ''Ida Bagus Made - Mata Air Campuhan Masa Silam'', accompanied the exhibition.

In 2001, a posthumous solo exhibition was held at the Herbert Johnson Museum of the [[Cornell University]], Ithaca, New York. The exhibition was curated by Prof. Kaja McGowan of Cornell University. Third teen paintings from three private collectors were shown from August 18 - October 28, 2001.

'''Joseph H. Burrows''' (October 5, 1953{{spaced ndash}}October 15, 2009&lt;ref name=gaz_obit /&gt;) was [[Miscarriage of justice|wrongfully convicted]] of the [[murder]] of [[farmer]] William E. Dulan at his home in [[Iroquois County, Illinois]], in 1988. After his conviction and sentence to death in 1989, Burrows was held for nearly five years on [[death row]].

Peter Rooney, a reporter for the ''[[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)|Champaign-Urbana News-Gazette]],'' obtained a recantation from a key witness against Burrows, and the case was reopened. Burrows' attorney, [[Kathleen Zellner]], persuaded the real killer, Gayle Potter, to confess at the post-conviction hearing.&lt;ref name="nw_sum"&gt;http://www.law.northwestern.edu/legalclinic/wrongfulconvictions/exonerations/il/joseph-burrows.html&lt;/ref&gt; Burrows was released in 1994.

==Chronology of events==
On November 8, 1988, the body of 88-year-old farmer William E. Dulan was found at his home.

Gayle Potter, a cocaine addict, was picked up for forging a check of Dulan's. Her blood was found at the murder scene.&lt;ref name="sumNW"&gt;[http://www.law.northwestern.edu/legalclinic/wrongfulconvictions/exonerations/il/joseph-burrows.html "Joseph Burrows"], Center for Wrongful Convictions, Northwestern University&lt;/ref&gt;

In a plea bargain, Potter admitted forging the check and taking part in the crime, but implicated two others. She claimed that Burrows, 32, had shot the older man, and also said that Ralph Frye, 22, a friend of Burrows who had slight cognitive disabilities, was involved. Potter and Frye were both sentenced to long prison terms, but Burrows was later sentenced to death.&lt;ref name="sumNW"/&gt;

There was no physical evidence linking either Burrows or Frye to the crime. Four witnesses placed Burrows 60 miles away at the time of the crime.&lt;ref name="sumNW"/&gt;

==Conviction==

Burrows' first trial for the 1988 first-degree murder of William Dulan ended in a hung jury. He was convicted in his second trial and sentenced to death on August 1, 1989.&lt;ref name="nw_chart"&gt;[http://www.law.northwestern.edu/legalclinic/wrongfulconvictions/exonerations/documents/ilBurrowsChart.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Burrows appealed his conviction and death sentence, but both were upheld in 1992 by the [[Supreme Court of Illinois]].&lt;ref name="nw_sum"/&gt;

==Exoneration==

When learning that the Illinois Supreme Court turned down Burrows' appeal, Frye contacted a reporter and recanted his testimony against Burrows. He said he had been coerced by police into a false confession and testimony. At a post-conviction hearing, Zellner persuaded the perpetrator Gayle Potter to confess to the murder. Burrows won a new trial, at which Potter and Frye both testified. The prosecution eventually dropped charges against Burrows, and he was released in 1994.

==Later life==

Burrows was bitter over his wrongful conviction and years on death row. He filed a civil suit against the police, and was awarded $100,000. Years later, in 2005, he was convicted and sentenced to six years in prison for the possession of chemicals allegedly used in the production of [[methamphetamine]].&lt;ref name="gaz_obit"/&gt; He was released in 2008 with day-for-day good time.&lt;ref name="nw_sum"/&gt;

==Death==

Burrows died at his home in [[Homer, Illinois]], on October 15, 2009.&lt;ref name=gaz_obit&gt;{{cite news |last=Wood |first=Paul |title=Exonerated man, Joe Burrows, finally at peace |url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/local/2009-10-23/exonerated-man-joe-burrows-finally-peace.html |work=[[The News-Gazette (Champaign-Urbana)]] |accessdate=16 September 2013 |date=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a proponent of [[natural selection]], and a leading figure in the mid-twentieth century [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]]. He was secretary of the [[Zoological Society of London]] (1935–1942), the first Director of [[UNESCO]], a founding member of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] and the first President of the [[British Humanist Association]].

Huxley was well known for his presentation of science in books and articles, and on radio and television. He directed an Oscar-winning wildlife film. He was awarded UNESCO's [[Kalinga Prize]] for the popularisation of science in 1953, the [[Darwin Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1956,&lt;ref name="frs" /&gt; and the [[Darwin–Wallace Medal]] of the [[Linnaean Society]] in 1958. He was also [[British honours system|knighted]] in that same year, 1958, a hundred years after [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] announced the theory of evolution by natural selection. In 1959 he received a Special Award of the [[Lasker Foundation]] in the category [[Planned Parenthood]] – [[World Population]]. Huxley was a prominent member of the [[British Eugenics Society]] and was its president from 1959–1962.

There is a public house named after Sir Julian in [[Selsdon]], Surrey, close to the [[Selsdon Wood Nature Reserve]] which he helped establish.

== Life ==
{{See also|Huxley family}}

=== Early life ===
Huxley came from the distinguished [[Huxley family]]. His brother was the writer [[Aldous Huxley]], and his half-brother a fellow biologist and Nobel laureate, [[Andrew Huxley]]; his father was writer and editor [[Leonard Huxley (writer)|Leonard Huxley]]; and his paternal grandfather was [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], a friend and supporter of [[Charles Darwin]] and proponent of evolution. His maternal grandfather was the academic [[Tom Arnold (academic)|Tom Arnold]], his great-uncle was poet [[Matthew Arnold]] and his great-grandfather was [[Thomas Arnold]] of [[Rugby School]].

[[File:Huxley-Arnold family tree.svg|thumb|right|Family tree]]
Huxley was born on 22 June 1887, at the London house of his aunt, the novelist [[Mary Augusta Ward]], while his father was attending the jubilee celebrations of [[Queen Victoria]]. Huxley grew up at the family home in [[Surrey]], England, where he showed an early interest in nature, as he was given lessons by his grandfather, [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. When he heard his grandfather talking at dinner about the lack of parental care in fish, Julian piped up with "What about the [[stickleback]], Gran'pater?" Also, according to Julian himself, his grandfather took him to visit [[J. D. Hooker]] at Kew.&lt;ref&gt;Personal communication, Julian Huxley to Ronald Clark, the biographer of the Huxley family.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tom&amp;julien-72.jpg|thumb|left|200px|T. H. Huxley with Julian in 1893]]

At the age of thirteen Huxley attended [[Eton College]] as a [[King's Scholar]], and continued to develop scientific interests; his grandfather had influenced the school to build science laboratories much earlier. At Eton he developed an interest in ornithology, guided by science master W. D. "Piggy" Hill. "Piggy was a genius as a teacher… I have always been grateful to him."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1970. ''Memories''. George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Huxley won a scholarship in [[Zoology]] to [[Balliol College, Oxford]].

In 1906, after a summer in Germany, Huxley took his place in [[Oxford]], where he developed a particular interest in [[embryology]] and [[protozoa]]. In the autumn term of his final year, 1908, his mother died from cancer at only 46: a terrible blow for her husband, three sons, and eight-year-old daughter Margaret. That same year he won the [[Newdigate Prize]] for his poem "Holyrood". In 1909 he graduated with first class honours, and spent that July at the international gathering for the centenary of Darwin's birth, held at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Also, it was the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of the ''[[Origin of species]]''.

While at Oxford, he developed a friendship with the ornithologist [[William Warde Fowler]].&lt;ref name="WWF"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Huxley |first1=Julian |title=Obituary. W. Warde-Fowler |journal=[[British Birds (magazine)|British Birds]] |volume=15 |issue=66 |pages=143-144 |url=http://www.britishbirds.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/article_files/V15/V15_N06/V15_N06_P143_144_OB031.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early career ===

Huxley was awarded a scholarship to spend a year at the Naples Marine Biological Station where he developed his interest in developmental biology by investigating [[sea squirts]] and [[sea urchins]]. In 1910 he was appointed as Demonstrator in the [[University of Oxford|Department of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy]] at [[Oxford University]], and started on the systematic observation of the courtship habits of water birds such as the [[common redshank]] (a wader) and [[grebes]] (which are divers). [[Bird watching]] in childhood had given Huxley his interest in [[ornithology]], and he helped devise systems for the surveying and conservation of birds. His particular interest was bird behaviour, especially the courtship of water birds. His 1914 paper on the [[great crested grebe]], later published as a book, was a landmark in avian [[ethology]]; his invention of vivid labels for the rituals (such as 'penguin dance', 'plesiosaurus race' etc.) made the ideas memorable and interesting to the general reader.&lt;ref&gt;For an assessment of Huxley's ethology see Burkhardt, Richard W. 1993. Huxley and the rise of ethology. In Waters C. K. and Van Helden A. (eds) ''Julian Huxley: biologist and statesman of science''. Rice University Press, Houston.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GreatCrestedGrebes.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Great crested grebes]]

In 1912 his life took a new turn. He was asked by [[Edgar Odell Lovett]] to take the lead in setting up the new Department of Biology at the newly created Rice Institute (now [[Rice University]]) in [[Houston]], Texas, which he accepted, planning to start the following year. Huxley made an exploratory trip to the United States in September 1912, visiting a number of leading universities as well as the Rice Institute. At [[T. H. Morgan]]'s fly lab ([[Columbia University]]) he invited [[H. J. Muller]] to join him at Rice. Muller agreed to be his deputy, hurried to complete his PhD and moved to Houston for the beginning of the 1915–1916 academic year. At Rice, Muller taught biology and continued ''Drosophila'' lab work.

[[File:Hux1918-72.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Julian Huxley&lt;br /&gt;[[British Army Intelligence Corps]] 1918&lt;/center&gt;]]

Before taking up the post of Assistant Professor at the [[Rice University|Rice Institute]], Huxley spent a year in Germany preparing for his demanding new job. Working in a laboratory just months before the outbreak of [[World War I]], Huxley overheard fellow academics comment on a passing aircraft "it will not be long before those planes are flying over England". In 1913 Huxley had a [[nervous breakdown]] after the break-up of his relationship with 'K',&lt;ref&gt;'K': so designated in ''Memories'' (1970), but now known to be Kathleen Fordham, whom he met when she was a pupil at his mother's school Prior's Field. Huxley suffered from a conflict between desire and guilt. (Dronamraju K. R. 1993. ''If I am to be remembered: the life &amp; work of Julian Huxley''. World Scientific, Singapore, pp&amp;nbsp;9–10).&lt;/ref&gt; and rested in a nursing home. His depression returned the next year, and he and his brother Trevelyan (two years his junior) ended up in the same nursing home. Sadly, Trevelyan [[hanging|hanged]] himself. Depressive illness had afflicted others in the [[Huxley family#Mental problems in the family|Huxley family]].

One pleasure of Huxley's life in Texas was the sight of his first [[hummingbird]], though his visit to [[Edward Avery McIlhenny]]'s estate on [[Avery Island]] in Louisiana was more significant. The McIlhennys and their Avery cousins owned the entire island, and the McIlhenny branch used it to produce their famous [[Tabasco sauce]]. Birds were one of McIlhenny's passions, however, and around 1895 he had set up a private sanctuary on the Island, called Bird City. There Huxley found [[egrets]], [[herons]] and [[bitterns]]. These water birds, like the grebes, exhibit mutual courtship, with the pairs displaying to each other, and with the secondary sexual characteristics equally developed in both sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Julian 1970. ''Memories'', chapters 7 and 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1916 Huxley returned to England from Texas to assist in the war effort. He was commissioned a temporary [[second lieutenant]] in the [[Royal Army Service Corps]] on 25 May 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30134 |date=15 June 1917 |page=5966 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was transferred to the General List, working in the [[British Army Intelligence Corps]] from 26 January 1918, first in [[Sussex]], and then in northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=30938 |date=4 October 1918 |page=11799 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was advanced in grade within the Intelligence Corps on 3 May 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31059 |date=10 December 1918 |page=14631 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; relinquished his intelligence appointment on 10 January 1919 and was demobilised five days later, retaining his rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=31285 |date=8 April 1919 |page=4720 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=32377 |date=1 July 1921 |page=5308 |supp=y|nolink=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war he became a [[University of Oxford|Fellow]] at [[New College, Oxford]], and was made Senior Demonstrator in the University Department of Zoology. In fact, Huxley took the place of his old tutor Geoffrey Smith, who had been killed in the [[battle of the Somme]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

In 1919 Huxley married Juliette Baillot (1896–1994). She was a French Swiss girl whom he had met at [[Garsington Manor]], the country house of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], a [[Bloomsbury Group]] socialite with a penchant for artists and intellectuals. The newly-weds' life together included students, faculty wives, grebes and, unfortunately, another depressive breakdown, this time rather serious. From his wife's autobiography it seems his mental illness took the form of a [[bipolar disorder]], with the depressive phases being of moderate to severe intensity. It took a long time for him to recover on this occasion, but despite this he left a legacy of students who admired him, and who became leaders in zoology for the next thirty or forty years. [[E. B. Ford]] always remembered his openness and encouragement at the start of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Juliette. 1986. ''Leaves of the tulip tree: autobiography''. Murray, London.

[[File:Julian Huxley and 2 sons.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Huxley with his two sons, [[Anthony Huxley|Anthony]] and [[Francis Huxley|Francis]].]]

In 1925 Huxley moved to [[King's College London]] as Professor of [[Zoology]], but in 1927, to the amazement of his colleagues and on the prodding of [[H. G. Wells]] whom he had promised 1,000 words a day,&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|title=Huxley, Sir Julian Sorell|first=Robert |last=Olby |publisher=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31271}}
&lt;/ref&gt; he resigned his chair to work full-time with Wells and his son [[G. P. Wells]] on ''[[The Science of Life]]'' ([[#Public life and popularisation|see below]]). For some time Huxley retained his room at King's College, and continued as Honorary Lecturer in the Zoology Department. From 1927 to 1931 he was also [[Royal Institution|Fullerian Professor of Physiology]] at the [[Royal Institution]], where he gave an annual lectures series. No one realised it at the time &lt;sup&gt;(why would they?)&lt;/sup&gt;, but he had come to the end of his life as a university academic.

[[File:Juliette-72.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Juliette Huxley, c.1929.]]

In 1929, after finishing work on ''The Science of Life'', Huxley visited East Africa to advise the [[Colonial Office]] on education in [[British East Africa]] (for the most part [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and [[Tanganyika]]). He discovered that the wildlife on the [[Serengeti]] plain was almost undisturbed because the [[tsetse fly]] (the vector for the [[Trypanosoma brucei|trypanosome]] parasite which causes [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] in humans) prevented human settlement there. He tells about these experiences in ''Africa view'' (1931), and so does his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Juliette 1986. ''Leaves of the tulip tree''. Murray, London, p. 130 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; She reveals that he fell in love with an 18-year-old American girl on board ship (when Juliette was not present), and then presented Juliette with his ideas for an open marriage: "What Julian really wanted was… a definite freedom from the conventional bonds of marriage." The couple separated for a while; Julian travelled to the US, hoping to land a suitable appointment and, in due course, to marry Miss Weldmeier. He left no account of what transpired, but he was evidently not successful, and returned to England to resume his marriage in 1931. For the next couple of years Huxley still angled for an appointment in the US, without success.&lt;ref&gt;Waters C. K. &amp; Van Helden A. (eds) 1993. ''Julian Huxley: biologist and statesman of science''. Houston. p. 285, notes 50 and 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mid career ===
As the 1930s started, Huxley travelled widely and took part in a variety of activities which were partly scientific and partly political. In 1931 Huxley visited the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] at the invitation of [[Intourist]], where initially he admired the results of social and economic planning on a large scale. Later, back in the United Kingdom, he became a founding member of the think tank [[Political and Economic Planning]].

In the 1930s Huxley visited [[Kenya]] and other East African countries to see the conservation work, including the creation of [[national parks]], which was happening in the few areas that remained uninhabited due to [[malaria]]. From 1933 to 1938 he was a member of the committee for Lord Hailey's African Survey.

[[File:Hux-cig-72.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Huxley lights a cigarette under his grandfather's portrait, c.1935.]]

In 1935 Huxley was appointed secretary to the [[Zoological Society of London]], and spent much of the next seven years running the society and its zoological gardens, the [[London Zoo]] and [[Whipsnade Park]], alongside his writing and research. The previous Director, [[Peter Chalmers Mitchell]], had been in post for many years, and had skillfully avoided conflict with the Fellows and Council. Things were rather different when Huxley arrived. Huxley was not a skilled administrator; his wife said "He was impatient… and lacked tact".&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Juliette 1986. ''Leaves of the Tulip Tree''. Murray, London, p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; He instituted a number of changes and innovations, more than some approved of. For example, Huxley introduced a whole range of ideas designed to make the Zoo child-friendly. Today, this would pass without comment; but then it was more controversial. He fenced off the Fellows' Lawn to establish Pets Corner; he appointed new assistant curators, encouraging them to talk to children; he initiated the Zoo Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles D. J. 1993. Huxley and the popularization of science. In Waters C. K. and Van Helden A. (eds) ''Julian Huxley: Biologist and Statesman of Science''. Houston.&lt;/ref&gt; Fellows and their guests had the privilege of free entry on Sundays, a closed day to the general public. Today, that would be unthinkable, and Sundays are now open to the public. Huxley's mild suggestion (that the guests should pay) encroached on territory the Fellows thought was theirs by right.

In 1941 Huxley was invited to the United States on a lecturing tour, and generated some controversy by saying that he thought the United States should join [[World War II]]: a few weeks later came the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. When the US joined the war, he found it difficult to get a passage back to the UK, and his lecture tour was extended. The Council of the Zoological Society—"a curious assemblage… of wealthy amateurs, self-perpetuating and autocratic"&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Julian. 1970. ''Memories''. George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;—uneasy with their secretary, used this as an opportunity to remove him. This they did by abolishing his post "to save expenses". Since Huxley had taken a half-salary cut at the start of the war, and no salary at all whilst he was in America, the Council's action was widely read as a personal attack on Huxley. A public controversy ensued, but eventually the Council got its way.

In 1943 he was asked by the British government to join the Colonial Commission on Higher Education. The Commission's remit was to survey the West African [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries for suitable locations for the creation of universities. There he acquired a disease, went down with [[hepatitis]], and had a serious mental breakdown. He was completely disabled, treated with [[Electroconvulsive therapy|ECT]], and took a full year to recover. He was 55.

=== Later career ===

Huxley, a lifelong internationalist with a concern for education, got involved in the creation of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), and became the organization's first director-general in 1946. His term of office, six years in the Charter, was cut down to two years at the behest of the American delegation.&lt;ref&gt;Armytage W. H. G. 1989. The first Director-General of UNESCO. In Keynes M. and Harrison G. A. (eds) 1989. ''Evolutionary studies: a centenary celebration of the life of Julian Huxley.'' Macmillan, London, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons are not known for sure, but his left-wing tendencies and humanism were likely factors. In a fortnight he dashed off a 60-page booklet on the purpose and philosophy of UNESCO, eventually printed and issued as an official document. There were, however, many conservative opponents of his scientific humanism. His idea of restraining population growth with birth control was anathema to both the [[Catholic Church]] and the [[Comintern]]/[[Cominform]]. In its first few years UNESCO was dynamic and broke new ground; since Huxley it has become larger, more bureaucratic and stable.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1947. ''UNESCO: its purpose and its philosophy''. UNESCO C/6 15 September 1947. Public Affairs Press, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Armytage W. H. G. 1989. The first Director-General of UNESCO. In Keynes M. and Harrison G. A. (eds) 1989. ''Evolutionary studies: a centenary celebration of the life of Julian Huxley.'' Macmillan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The personal and social side of the years in Paris are well described by his wife.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1986"&gt;Huxley, Juliette 1986. ''Leaves of the tulip tree''. Murray, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley's internationalist and conservation interests also led him, with [[Victor Stolan]], [[Peter Scott|Sir Peter Scott]], [[Max Nicholson]] and [[Guy Mountfort]], to set up the WWF ([[World Wide Fund for Nature]] under its former name of the [[World Wildlife Fund]]).

Another post-war activity was Huxley's attack on the Soviet politico-scientist [[Trofim Lysenko]], who had espoused a [[Lamarck]]ian heredity, made unscientific pronouncements on agriculture, used his influence to destroy classical genetics in Russia and to move genuine scientists from their posts. In 1940, the leading botanical geneticist [[Nikolai Vavilov]] was arrested, and Lysenko replaced him as director of the Institute of Genetics. In 1941, Vavilov was tried, found guilty of 'sabotage' and sentenced to death. Reprieved, he died in jail of malnutrition in 1943. Lysenko's machinations were the cause of his arrest. Worse still, [[Lysenkoism]] not only denied proven genetic facts, it stopped the [[artificial selection]] of crops on Darwinian principles. This may have contributed to the regular shortage of food from the Soviet agricultural system ([[Famines in Russia and USSR|Soviet famines]]). Huxley, who had twice visited the Soviet Union, was originally not anti-communist, but the ruthless adoption of Lysenkoism by [[Joseph Stalin]] ended his tolerant attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1949. ''Soviet genetics and World science: Lysenko and the meaning of heredity''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London. In the US as ''Heredity, East and West''. Schuman, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; Lysenko ended his days in a Soviet mental hospital, and Vavilov's reputation was posthumously restored in 1955.

In the 1950s Huxley played a role in bringing to the [[English-speaking]] public the work of the French [[Jesuit]]-[[palaeontologist]] [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], who he believed had been unfairly treated by the Catholic and Jesuit hierarchy. Both men believed in evolution, but differed in its interpretation as de Chardin was a Christian, whilst Huxley was an [[unbeliever]]. Huxley wrote the foreword to ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'' (1959) and was bitterly attacked by his rationalist friends for doing so.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Julian. 1972. ''Memories II''. George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Huxley's death at 87 in 1975, John Owen (Director of National Parks for [[Tanganyika]]) wrote "Julian Huxley was one of the world's great men… he played a seminal role in wild life conservation in [East] Africa in the early days… [and in] the far-reaching influence he exerted [on] the international community".&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Juliette 1986. ''Leaves of the tulip tree''. Murray, London. p. 204&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to his international and humanist concerns, his research interests covered evolution in all its aspects, [[ethology]], [[embryology]], [[genetics]], [[anthropology]] and to some extent the infant field of [[cell biology]]. Julian's eminence as an advocate for evolution, and especially his contribution to the modern evolutionary synthesis, led to his awards of the [[Darwin Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1956,&lt;ref name="frs" /&gt; and the Darwin–Wallace Medal of the [[Linnaean Society]] in 1958. 1958 was the centenary anniversary of the joint presentation ''On the tendency of species to form varieties; and the perpetuation of varieties and species by natural means of selection'' by Darwin and Wallace.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bowler, Peter J.]] 2003. ''Evolution: The History of an Idea'', 3rd ed. University of California Press. pp. 256–273 {{ISBN|0-520-23693-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was a friend and mentor of the biologists and [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates [[Konrad Lorenz]] and [[Niko Tinbergen]],&lt;ref&gt;Waters C. K. &amp; Van Helden A. (eds) 1992. ''Julian Huxley: biologist and statesman of science''. Rice, Houston TX. p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; and taught and encouraged many others. In general, he was more of an all-round naturalist than his famous grandfather,&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, Michael 1997. Thomas Henry Huxley and the status of evolution as science, in Barr, Alan P. (ed) ''Thomas Henry Huxley's place in science and letters: centenary essays''. Athens, Georgia.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed much to the acceptance of natural selection.

== Special themes ==

=== Evolution ===
Huxley and biologist [[August Weismann]] insisted on natural selection as the primary agent in [[evolution]]. Huxley was a major player in the mid-twentieth century modern evolutionary synthesis. He was a prominent [[populariser]] of [[biological]] science to the [[General public|public]], with a focus on three aspects in particular.

==== Personal influence ====
* In the early 20th century he was one of the minority of biologists&lt;ref&gt;Bowler P.J. 1983. ''The eclipse of Darwinism: anti-Darwinian evolutionary theories in the decades around 1900''. Johns Hopkins, Baltimore.&lt;/ref&gt; who believed that [[natural selection]] was the main driving force of evolution, and that evolution occurred by small steps and not by [[saltation (biology)|saltation]] (jumps). These opinions are now standard.&lt;ref&gt;Bowler P.J. 2003. ''Evolution: the history of an idea''. 3rd ed revised and expanded, University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though his time as an academic was quite brief, he taught and encouraged a number of evolutionary biologists at the University of Oxford in the 1920s. [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]] (ecology), [[Alister Hardy]] ([[marine biology]]) and [[John Baker (biologist)|John Baker]] ([[cell biology|cytology]]) all became highly successful, and Baker eventually wrote Huxley's Royal Society obituary memoir.&lt;ref name="frs" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baker, John R. 1978. ''Julian Huxley, scientist and world citizen, 1887–1975''. UNESCO, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the most significant was [[Edmund Brisco Ford]], who founded a field of research called [[ecological genetics]], which played a role in the evolutionary synthesis. Another important disciple was [[Gavin de Beer]], who wrote on [[evo-devo|evolution and development]], and became Director of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]. Both these fine scholars had attended Huxley's lectures on [[genetics]], experimental [[zoology]] (including [[embryology]]) and [[ethology]]. Later, they became his collaborators, and then leaders in their own right.
* In an era when scientists did not travel so frequently as today, Huxley was an exception, for he travelled widely in Europe, Africa and the United States. He was therefore able to learn from and influence other scientists, naturalists and administrators. In the US he was able to meet other evolutionists at a critical time in the reassessment of [[natural selection]]. In Africa he was able to influence colonial administrators about education and wildlife [[Conservation movement|conservation]]. In Europe, through [[UNESCO]], he was at the centre of the post-[[World War II]] revival of education. In Russia, however, his experiences were mixed. His initially favourable view was changed by his growing awareness of Stalin's murderous repression, and the [[Trofim Lysenko|Lysenko]] affair.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, J.S. 1949. ''Soviet genetics and world science: Lysenko and the meaning of heredity''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London. In the US as ''Heredity, East and West''. Schuman, N.Y. (1949).&lt;/ref&gt; There seems little evidence that he had any effect on the [[Soviet Union]], and the same could be said for some other Western scientists.&lt;br /&gt;"Marxist-Leninism had become a dogmatic religion… and like all dogmatic religions, it had turned from reform to persecution."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1970. ''Memories''. George Allen &amp; Unwin, London. Chapter XIX 'Russia 1945', p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Evolutionary synthesis ====
* Huxley was one of the main architects of the modern evolutionary synthesis which took place around the time of [[World War II]]. The synthesis of genetic and population ideas produced a consensus which reigned in biology from about 1940, and which is still broadly tenable.

: "The most informative episode in the history of evolutionary biology was the establishment of the 'neo-Darwinian synthesis'." Berry and Bradshaw, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Berry R.J. and Bradshaw A.D. 1992. Genes in the real world. In Berry R.J. et al. (eds) ''Genes in ecology''. Blackwell, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; The synthesis was brought about "not by one side being proved right and the others wrong, but by the exchange of the most viable components of the previously competing research strategies". Ernst Mayr, 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr E. 1980. Some thoughts on the history of the evolutionary synthesis. In Mayr E. and Provine W.B. ''The evolutionary synthesis''. Harvard. pp. 1–80&lt;/ref&gt;
* Huxley's first 'trial run' was the treatment of evolution in the ''Science of Life'' (1929–30), and in 1936 he published a long and significant paper for the [[British Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Huxley J.S.|year= 1936|title= Natural selection and evolutionary progress|url=https://archive.org/stream/reportofbritisha36adva/reportofbritisha36adva_djvu.txt|journal=Proceedings of the British Association|volume=106|pages=81–100}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 came three lengthy reviews on major evolutionary topics.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. (1938). "Threat and warning colouration with a general discussion of the biological function of colour". ''Proc Eighth Int Ornithological Congress,'' Oxford 1934 pp. 430–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/280795|jstor=2457442| title = Darwin's Theory of Sexual Selection and the Data Subsumed by it, in the Light of Recent Research| journal = The American Naturalist| volume = 72| issue = 742| pages = 416| year = 1938| last1 = Huxley | first1 = J. S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J.S. (1938). "The present standing of the theory of sexual selection". In G.R. de Beer (ed) ''Evolution: Essays on aspects of evolutionary biology'' pp. 11–42. Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of these papers were on the subject of [[sexual selection]], an idea of Darwin's whose standing has been revived in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Helena (1991). ''The ant and the peacock: altruism and sexual selection from Darwin to today''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson M. 1994. ''Sexual selection''. Princeton.&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley thought that sexual selection was "…merely an aspect of natural selection which… is concerned with characters which subserve mating, and are usually [[sex-limited]]". This rather grudging acceptance of sexual selection was influenced by his studies on the courtship of the [[great crested grebe]] (and other birds that pair for life): the courtship takes place mostly ''after'' mate selection, not before.
* Now it was time for Huxley to tackle the subject of evolution at full length, in what became the defining work of his life. His role was that of a synthesiser, and it helped that he had met many of the other participants. His book ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]'' was written whilst he was secretary to the Zoological Society, and made use of his remarkable collection of reprints covering the first part of the century. It was published in 1942. Reviews of the book in learned journals were little short of ecstatic; the American Naturalist called it "The outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade, perhaps of the century. The approach is thoroughly scientific; the command of basic information amazing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hubbs C. L. |year=1943|title=Evolution the new synthesis|journal=American Naturalist|volume=77|issue=771|pages=365–68|jstor=2457394|doi=10.1086/281134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/394682|jstor=2808828| title = The Great Biological Generalization:Evolution: The Modern Synthesis. Julian Huxley| journal = The Quarterly Review of Biology| volume = 18| issue = 4| pages = 364| year = 1943| last1 = Kimball | first1 = R. F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Huxley's main co-respondents in the modern evolutionary synthesis are usually listed as [[Ernst Mayr]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], [[George Gaylord Simpson]], [[Bernhard Rensch]], [[Ledyard Stebbins]] and the population geneticists [[J. B. S. Haldane]], [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Sewall Wright]].&lt;br /&gt; However, at the time of Huxley's book several of these had yet to make their distinctive contribution. Certainly, for Huxley, [[E. B. Ford]] and his co-workers in [[ecological genetics]] were at least as important; and [[Cyril Darlington]], the chromosome expert, was a notable source of facts and ideas.&lt;br /&gt;An analysis of the 'authorities cited' index of ''Evolution the modern synthesis'' shows indirectly those whom Huxley regarded as the most important contributors to the synthesis up to 1941 (the book was published in 1942, and references go up to 1941). The authorities cited 20 or more times are:&lt;br /&gt;[[Cyril Darlington|Darlington]], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], [[Theodosius Dobzhansky|Dobzhansky]], [[Ronald Fisher|Fisher]], [[E. B. Ford|Ford]], [[Richard Goldschmidt|Goldschmidt]], [[J. B. S. Haldane|Haldane]], J. S. Huxley, [[Hermann J. Muller|Muller]], [[Bernhard Rensch|Rensch]], [[W. B. Turrill|Turrill]], [[Sewall Wright|Wright]].&lt;br /&gt;This list contains a few surprises. Goldschmidt was an influential geneticist who advocated evolution by saltation, and was sometimes mentioned in disagreement. Turrill provided Huxley with botanical information. The list omits three key members of the synthesis who are listed above: [[Ernst Mayr|Mayr]], [[G. Ledyard Stebbins|Stebbins]] the botanist and [[George Gaylord Simpson|Simpson]] the palaeontologist. Mayr gets 16 citations and more in the two later editions; all three published outstanding and relevant books some years later, and their contribution to the synthesis is unquestionable. Their lesser weight in Huxley's citations was caused by the early publication date of his book. Huxley's book is not strong in palaeontology, which illustrates perfectly why Simpson's later works were such an important contribution.
* It was Huxley who coined the terms ''the new synthesis'' and ''evolutionary synthesis'';&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1942. ''[[Evolution: The Modern Synthesis]]'' (2nd ed 1963, 3rd ed 1974)&lt;/ref&gt; he also invented the term ''[[cline (population genetics)|cline]]'' in 1938 to refer to species whose members fall into a series of sub-species with continuous change in characters over a geographical area.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. (1938). "Clines: an auxiliary method in taxonomy". ''Bijdragen tot de Dierkunde'' (Leiden) '''27''', 491–520.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/142219a0| title = Clines: An Auxiliary Taxonomic Principle| journal = Nature| volume = 142| issue = 3587| pages = 219| year = 1938| last1 = Huxley | first1 = J. | bibcode = 1938Natur.142..219H}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classic example of a cline is the circle of subspecies of the gull ''[[Larus]]'' round the Arctic zone. This cline is an example of a ''[[ring species]]''.&lt;br /&gt;Some of Huxley's last contributions to the evolutionary synthesis were on the subject of [[ecological genetics]]. He noted how surprisingly widespread [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] is in nature, with visible morphism much more prevalent in some groups than others. The immense diversity of colour and pattern in small bivalve molluscs, brittlestars, sea-anemones, tubicular polychaetes and various grasshoppers is perhaps maintained by making recognition by predators more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/hdy.1955.1| title = Morphism and evolution| journal = Heredity| volume = 9| pages = 1| year = 1955| last1 = Huxley | first1 = J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1955.

==== Evolutionary progress ====
{{further|Orthogenesis}}

* Huxley always believed that on a broad view evolution led to advances in organisation. ''Progress without a goal'' was one of his phrases, to distinguish his point of view from classical [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[teleology]]. "The ordinary man, or at least the ordinary poet, philosopher and theologian, always was anxious to find purpose in the evolutionary process. I believe this reasoning to be totally false."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1942. ''Evolution: The Modern Synthesis'' Allen &amp; Unwin, London, p. 576.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of evolutionary progress was subjected to some fierce criticism in the latter part of the twentieth century. [[Cladism|Cladists]], for example, were (and are) strongly against any suggestion that a group could be scientifically described as 'advanced' and others as 'primitive.' For them, and especially for the radical group of ''transformed cladists'', there is no such thing as an advanced group, they are derived or [[apomorphic]]. Primitive groups are [[plesiomorphic]]. Ironically, it was Huxley who invented the terms [[clade]] and [[evolutionary grade|grades]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/180454a0| title = The Three Types of Evolutionary Process| journal = Nature| volume = 180| issue = 4584| pages = 454| year = 1957| bibcode = 1957Natur.180..454H| last1 = Huxley| first1 = Julian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1959. "Clades and grades." In Cain A. J. (ed) ''Function and Taxonomic Importance''. Systematics Association, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.000245| title = Willi Hennig's Impact on Taxonomic Thought| journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics| volume = 15| pages = 1| year = 1984| last1 = Dupuis | first1 = C. }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, to take a rather extreme case, it would seem strange to say that when man is compared to bacteria, that mankind is not a vastly more complex and advanced form of life; or that the invasion of the land by plants and animals was not a great advance in the history of life on this planet. On this issue Julian was at the opposite end of the spectrum from his grandfather, who was, at least for the first half of his career, a propagandist for 'persistent types', getting close to denying any advances at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Huxley T. H. |year=1859|title=On the persistent types of animal life|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Desmond|Desmond A.]] 1982. ''Archetypes and Ancestors: Palaeontology in Victorian London, 1850–1875''. Blond &amp; Briggs, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Huxley argued his case many times, even in his most important works. In the final chapter of his ''Evolution the modern synthesis'' he defines evolutionary progress as "a raising of the upper level of biological efficiency, this being defined as increased control over and independence of the environment,"&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, 1942. Chapter 10 "Evolutionary progress."&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;''Evolution in action'' discusses evolutionary progress at length: "Natural selection plus time produces biological improvement… 'Improvement' is not yet a recognised technical term in biology … however, living things are improved during evolution… Darwin was not afraid to use the word for the results of natural selection in general… I believe that improvement can become one of the key concepts in evolutionary biology."&lt;br /&gt;"Can it be scientifically defined? Improvements in biological machinery… the limbs and teeth of grazing horses… the increase in brain-power… The eyes of a dragon-fly, which can see all round [it] in every direction, are an improvement over the mere microscopic eye-spots of early forms of life."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1953. ''Evolution in Action''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London, pp. 62–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; "[Over] the whole range of evolutionary time we see general advance—improvement in all the main properties of life, including its general organization. 'Advance' is thus a useful term for long-term improvement in some general property of life. [But] improvement is not universal. Lower forms manage to survive alongside higher".&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, 1953. 'p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; These excerpts are much abbreviated, but give some idea of his way of thinking. He addresses the topic of 'persistent types' ([[living fossils]]) later in the same book (pp 126–28).
* The question of evolutionary advancement has quite a history. Of course, pre-Darwin, it was believed without question that Man stood at the head of a pyramid ([[scala naturae]]). The matter is not so simple with evolution by natural selection; Darwin's own opinion varied from time to time. In the ''Origin'' he wrote "And as natural selection works by and for the good of each being, all corporeal and mental endowments will tend to progress towards perfection".&lt;ref&gt;Darwin C. ''On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection''. Murray, London. p. 489&lt;/ref&gt; This was much too strong; as Sober remarks, there is nothing in the theory of natural selection which demands that selection must produce an increase in complexity or any other measure of advancement. It is merely compatible with the theory that this might happen.&lt;ref&gt;Sober E. 1984. ''The Nature of Selection: Evolutionary Theory in Philosophical Focus''. Chicago. p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere Darwin admits that "naturalists have not yet defined to each other's satisfaction what is meant by high and low forms" (p.&amp;nbsp;336); nor have they now – this is one of the problems. Other evolutionary biologists have had similar thoughts to Huxley: [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]]&lt;ref&gt;Stebbins, G. Ledyard 1969. ''The Basis of Progressive Evolution''. Chapel Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bernhard Rensch]],&lt;ref&gt;Rensch B. 1960. ''Evolution above the Species Level''. Columbia, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; for example. The term for progressive evolution is ''[[anagenesis]]'', though this does not necessarily include the idea of improvement.&lt;br /&gt;The objective description of complexity was one of the issues addressed by [[cybernetics]] in the 1950s. The idea that advanced machines (including living beings) could exert more control over their environments and operate in a wider range of situations perhaps serves as a basis for making the terms such as 'advanced' amenable to more exact definition.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, W. Ross. 1956. ''Introduction to Cybernetics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simon H.A. 1962. "The architecture of complexity." ''Proc Am Philos Soc'' '''106''', 467–82; reprinted in Simon H.A. 1981. ''The Sciences of the Artificial''. 2nd ed MIT, Cambridge MA.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a debate that continues today.

University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; and Dawkins.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins R. 1992. "Higher and lower animals: a diatribe." In Fox-Keller E. and Lloyd E. (eds) ''Keywords in Evolutionary Biology''. Harvard.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secular humanism ===
Huxley's [[secular humanism|humanism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Medawar]] chose the term ''evolutionary humanism'' to distinguish this from other uses of the term 'humanism'. Bullock, Alan et al. 1988. ''Fontana dictionary of modern thought''. 2nd ed. Fontana, London. p. 293&lt;/ref&gt; came from his appreciation that mankind was in charge of its own destiny (at least in principle), and this raised the need for a sense of direction and a system of ethics. His grandfather [[T. H. Huxley]], when faced with similar problems, had promoted agnosticism, but Julian chose humanism as being more directed to supplying a basis for ethics. Julian's thinking went along these lines: "The critical point in the evolution of man… was when he acquired the use of [language]… Man's development is potentially open… He has developed a new method of evolution: the transmission of organized experience by way of tradition, which… largely overrides the automatic process of natural selection as the agent of change".&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. S. 1953. ''Evolution in action''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Huxley and his grandfather gave [[Romanes Lectures]] on the possible connection between evolution and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley T. H. and Huxley J. 1947. ''Evolution and ethics 1893–1943''. Pilot, London. In the US as ''Touchstone for ethics'' Harper, N.Y. [includes text from the Romanes lectures of both T. H. Huxley and Julian Huxley]&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[evolutionary ethics]])  Huxley's views on god could be described as being that of an agnostic atheist.&lt;ref&gt;"Despite his atheism Huxley could appreciate Teilhard de Chardin's vision of evolution, and like his grandfather T. H. Huxley he believed progress could be described in biological terms." Robert Olby, 'Huxley, Sir Julian Sorell (1887–1975)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edition, May 2007 (accessed May 2, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marty, Martin E. Modern American Religion: Vol. 3, Under God, Indivisible, 1941-1960. Chicago: U of Chicago, 1996. Print. "the atheist Sir Julian Huxley, who was inspired by a line read long ago in Lord Morley"&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley had a close association with the British [[rationalist movement|rationalist]] and [[secular humanism|secular humanist]] movements. He was an Honorary Associate of the [[Rationalist Press Association]] from 1927 until his death, and on the formation of the [[British Humanist Association]] in 1963 became its first President, to be succeeded by [[Alfred Ayer|AJ Ayer]] in 1965. He was also closely involved with the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]. Many of Huxley's books address humanist themes. In 1962 Huxley accepted the [[American Humanist Association]]'s annual "Humanist of the Year" award.

Huxley also presided over the founding Congress of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and served with [[John Dewey]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Thomas Mann]] on the founding advisory board of the First Humanist Society of New York.

=== Religious naturalism ===
Huxley wrote that "There is no separate supernatural realm: all phenomena are part of one natural process of evolution. There is no basic cleavage between science and religion;… I believe that [a] drastic reorganization of our pattern of religious thought is now becoming necessary, from a god-centered to an evolutionary-centered pattern".&lt;ref name="Divinity"&gt;Huxley, Julian. 1969. The New Divinity in ''Essays of a Humanist'. Penguin, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe the appropriate label for these views is [[religious naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Barlow C. 2003.[http://www.thegreatstory.org/ReligiousNaturalism.html ''A Tribute to Julian Huxley'', and others], page 3, Retrieved 5 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Many people assert that this abandonment of the god hypothesis means the abandonment of all religion and all moral sanctions. This is simply not true. But it does mean, once our relief at jettisoning an outdated piece of ideological furniture is over, that we must construct something to take its place.&lt;ref name="Divinity" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Parapsychology ===

Huxley took interest in investigating the claims of [[parapsychology]] and [[spiritualism]]. He joined the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in 1928. After investigation he found the field to be unscientific and full of [[charlatan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, William T. (2002). ''H. G. Wells's World Reborn: The Outline of History and Its Companions''. [[Associated University Presses|Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp]]. pp. 24-25. {{ISBN|1-57591-057-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, he joined the [[International Institute for Psychical Research]] but resigned after a few months due to its members spiritualist bias and non-scientific approach to the subject.&lt;ref&gt;''Blow to Psychic Research Body. Distinguished Men Resign''. ''[[The Yorkshire Evening Post]]''. June 28, 1934. p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Julian S; Schiller, F. C. S; Macbride, E. W. (1934). [http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v134/n3386/pdf/134458a0.pdf "Science and Psychical Research"]. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 134: 458.&lt;/ref&gt;

After attending [[séance]]s, Huxley concluded that the phenomena could be explained "either by natural causes, or, more usually by fraud".&lt;ref&gt;Meckier, Jerome; Nugel, Bernfried. (2004). ''Aldous Huxley Annual''. Volume 4. [[LIT Verlag]]. p. 228. {{ISBN|3-8258-8272-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huxley, [[Harold Dearden]] and others were judges for a group formed by the ''[[Sunday Chronicle]]'' to investigate the [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialization]] medium Harold Evans. During a séance Evans was exposed as a fraud. He was caught masquerading as a spirit, in a white nightshirt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price|Price, Harry]]. (1939). ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research: A Critical Survey''. [[Longman|Longmans, Green and Co]]. p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, Huxley wrote the foreword to Donovan Rawcliffe's ''[[The Psychology of the Occult]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1959). ''The Psychology of the Occult''. ''[[Science Digest]]'' 46: 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eugenics and race ===
Huxley was a prominent member of the [[British Eugenics Society]],&lt;ref&gt;Mazumdar, Pauline 1992. ''Eugenics, Human Genetics and Human Failings: The Eugenics Society, Its Sources and Its Critics in Britain''. Routledge, London.&lt;/ref&gt; and was Vice-President (1937–1944) and President (1959–1962). He thought eugenics was important for removing undesirable variants from the human gene pool, though after [[World War II]] he believed [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] was a meaningless concept in biology, and its application to humans was highly inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Garland E. 1992. "Julian Huxley and the eugenical view of human evolution." In Waters C. K. &amp; Van Helden A. (eds) ''Julian Huxley: Biologist and Statesman of Science''. Rice, Houston TX. pp. 206–7&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was an outspoken critic of the most extreme eugenicism in the 1920s and 1930s (the stimulus for which was the greater fertility of the 'feckless' poor compared to the 'responsible' prosperous classes). He was, nevertheless, a leading figure in the eugenics movement (see, for example, [[Eugenics manifesto]]). He gave the [[Galton]] memorial lecture twice, in 1936 and 1962. In his writing he used this argument several times: ''no one doubts the wisdom of managing the germ plasm of agricultural stocks, so why not apply the same concept to human stocks?''   "The agricultural analogy appears over and over again as it did in the writings of many American eugenicists."&lt;ref&gt;Allen, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley was one of many intellectuals at the time who believed that the lowest class in society was genetically inferior.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} In this passage, from 1941, he investigates a hypothetical scenario where social darwinism, capitalism, nationalism and the class society is taken for granted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If so, then we must plan our eugenic policy along some such lines as the following:... The lowest strata, allegedly less well-endowed genetically, are reproducing relatively too fast. Therefore birth-control methods must be taught them; they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive; long unemployment should be a ground for sterilization, or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world; and so on. That is to say, much of our eugenic programme will be curative and remedial merely, instead of preventive and constructive.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J.S. 1947. ''Man in the Modern World''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London. Originally published in ''The Uniqueness of Man'', 1941, p.66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, he does not demean the working class in general, but aims for "the virtual elimination of the few lowest and most degenerate types".&lt;ref&gt;Hubback D. "Julian Huxley and eugenics." 1989. In Keynes M. and Harrison G. A. (eds) ''Evolutionary Studies: A Centenary Celebration of the Life of Julian Huxley''. Macmillan, London.&lt;/ref&gt; The sentiment is not at all atypical of the time, and similar views were held by many geneticists ([[William E. Castle]], [[C.B. Davenport]], [[H. J. Muller]] are examples), and by other prominent intellectuals.

However, Huxley advocated a completely different alternative, in which the lower classes are ensured a nutritious diet, education and facilities for recreation:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We must therefore concentrate on producing a single equalized environment; and this clearly should be one as favourable as possible to the expression of the genetic qualities that we think desirable. Equally clearly, this should include the following items. A marked raising of the standard of diet for the great majority of the population, until all should be provided both with adequate calories and adequate accessory factors; provision of facilities for healthy exercise and recreation; and upward equalization of educational opportunity. ... we know from various sources that raising the standard of life among the poorest classes almost invariably results in a lowering of their fertility. In so far, therefore, as differential class-fertility exists, raising the environmental level will reduce any dysgenic effects which it may now have.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J.S. 1947. ''Man in the Modern World''. Chatto &amp; Windus, London. Originally published in ''The Uniqueness of Man'', 1941, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Concerning a public health and racial policy in general, Huxley wrote that "…unless [civilised societies] invent and enforce adequate measures for regulating human reproduction, for controlling the quantity of population, and ''at least preventing the deterioration of quality of racial stock'', they are doomed to decay …"&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Julian. 1926. ''Essays in Popular Science''. London: Chatto &amp; Windus, ix.&lt;/ref&gt; and remarked how biology should be the chief tool for rendering social politics scientific.

In the opinion of Duvall, "His views fell well within the spectrum of opinion acceptable to the English liberal intellectual elite. He shared ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''{{'}}s enthusiasm for birth control, and 'voluntary' sterilization."&lt;ref&gt;Duvall C. 1992. From a Victorian to a modern: Julian Huxley and the English intellectual climate. In Waters C. K. and Van Helden A. (eds) ''Julian Huxley: Biologist and Statesman of Science''. Rice University Press, Houston. p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; However, the word 'English' in this passage is unnecessary: such views were widespread.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles D. J. 1995. ''In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity''. Harvard 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Duvall comments that Huxley's enthusiasm for centralised [[Social engineering (political science)|social]] and [[economic planning]] and [[Anti-industrialism|anti-industrial]] values was common to leftist [[Ideology|ideologists]] during the inter-war years. Towards the end of his life, Huxley himself must have recognised how unpopular these views became after the end of [[World War II]]. In the two volumes of his autobiography, there is no mention of eugenics in the index, nor is Galton mentioned; and the subject has also been omitted from many of the obituaries and biographies. An exception is the proceedings of a conference organised by the [[British Eugenics Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Milo and Harrison, G. Ainsworth (eds) 1989. ''Evolutionary Studies: A Centenary Celebration of the Life of Julian Huxley''. Proceedings of the 24th annual symposium of the Eugenics Society, London 1987. Macmillan, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the rise of European fascism in the 1930s, he was asked to write ''We Europeans'' with the ethnologist [[Alfred Cort Haddon|A. C. Haddon]], the zoologist [[Alexander Carr-Saunders]] and the historian of science [[Charles Singer]]. Huxley suggested the word 'race' be replaced with [[ethnic group]]. After the [[Second World War]], he was instrumental in producing the [[UNESCO]] statement ''[[The Race Question]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001282/128291eo.pdf The Race question; UNESCO and its programme; Vol.:3; 1950&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which asserted that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A race, from the biological standpoint, may therefore be defined as one of the group of populations constituting the species ''Homo sapiens''"… "National, religious, geographic, linguistic and cult groups do not necessary coincide with racial groups: the cultural traits of such groups have no demonstrated genetic connexion with racial traits. Because serious errors of this kind are habitually committed when the term 'race' is used in popular parlance, it would be better when speaking of human races to drop the term 'race' altogether and speak of ''ethnic groups''"… "Now what has the scientist to say about the groups of mankind which may be recognized at the present time? Human races can be and have been differently classified by different anthropologists, but at the present time most anthropologists agree on classifying the greater part of present-day mankind into three major divisions, as follows: The Mongoloid Division; The Negroid Division; The Caucasoid Division." … "Catholics, Protestants, Moslems and Jews are not races … The biological fact of race and the myth of 'race' should be distinguished. For all practical social purposes 'race' is not so much a biological phenomenon as a social myth. The myth 'race' has created an enormous amount of human and social damage. In recent years it has taken a heavy toll in human lives and caused untold suffering. It still prevents the normal development of millions of human beings and deprives civilization of the effective co-operation of productive minds. The biological differences between ethnic groups should be disregarded from the standpoint of social acceptance and social action. The unity of mankind from both the biological and social viewpoint is the main thing. To recognize this and to act accordingly is the first requirement of modern man …&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Huxley won the second [[Anisfield-Wolf Book Award]] for ''We Europeans'' in 1937.

In 1957, Huxley coined the term "[[transhumanism]]" for the view that humans should better themselves through science and technology, possibly including eugenics, but also, importantly, the improvement of the social environment.

=== Public life and popularisation ===
Huxley was always able to write well, and was ever willing to address the public on scientific topics. Well over half his books are addressed to an educated general audience, and he wrote often in periodicals and newspapers. The most extensive bibliography of Huxley lists some of these ephemeral articles, though there are others unrecorded.&lt;ref&gt;Baker J. R. and Green J.-P. 1978. ''Julian Huxley: Man of science and citizen of the world 1887–1975''. UNESCO, bibliography, especially pp 107–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

These articles, some reissued as ''Essays of a biologist'' (1923), probably led to the invitation from [[H. G. Wells]] to help write a comprehensive work on biology for a general readership, ''The Science of Life''.&lt;ref name="Huxley 1986" /&gt; This work was published in stages in 1929–30,&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Huxley]] (in Keynes M. and Harrison G. A. eds 1989. ''Evolutionary studies: a centenary celebration of the life of Julian Huxley''. Macmillan, London. p. 19) says it was originally published in 31 fortnightly parts in 1929–30; others (Waters C. K. &amp; Van Helden A. eds 1993. ''Julian Huxley: biologist and statesman of science''. Houston. bibliography) say it was published in three volumes 1929–30. Both may be correct: see publishing history of ''The Science of Life'' in [[#Works|Works]] section.&lt;/ref&gt; and in one volume in 1931. Of this [[Robert Olby]] said "Book IV ''The essence of the controversies about evolution'' offers perhaps the clearest, most readable, succinct and informative popular account of the subject ever penned. It was here that he first expounded his own version of what later developed into the evolutionary synthesis".&lt;ref&gt;Olby R. in Waters, C. Kenneth and Van Helden, Albert (eds) 1993. ''Julian Huxley: biologist and statesman of science''. Rice University Press, Houston.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olby R. 2004. Huxley, Sir Julian Sorell (1887–1975). ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography.''&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoirs, Huxley says that he made almost £10,000 from the book.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley J. 1970. ''Memories''. George Allen &amp; Unwin, London, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934 Huxley collaborated with the naturalist [[Ronald Lockley]] to create for [[Alexander Korda]] the world's first natural history documentary ''[[The Private Life of the Gannets]]''. For the film, shot with the support of the Royal Navy around Grassholm off the [[Pembrokeshire]] coast, they won an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] for best documentary.&lt;ref&gt;[[Academy Award for Live Action Short Film]] 1937 (One-Reel) Skibo Productions – The Private Life of the Gannets.&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley had given talks on the radio since the 1920s, followed by written versions in ''[[The Listener (magazine)|The Listener]]''. In later life, he became known to an even wider audience through television. In 1939 the [[BBC]] asked him to be a regular panelist on a [[BBC Home Service|Home Service]] general knowledge show, ''[[The Brains Trust]]'', in which he and other panelists were asked to discuss questions submitted by listeners. The show was commissioned to keep up war time morale, by preventing the war from "disrupting the normal discussion of interesting ideas". The audience was not large for this somewhat elite programme; however, listener research ranked Huxley the most popular member of the Brains Trust from 1941 to 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa. 1970. ''The history of broadcasting in the UK'', vol 3 ''The war of words''. Oxford. pp. 581–2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas H. 1944. ''Britain's Brains Trust''. Chapman &amp; Hall, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, he was a regular panelist on one of the [[BBC]]'s first quiz shows (1955) ''Animal, Vegetable, Mineral?'' in which participants were asked to talk about objects chosen from museum and university collections.

In 1937 Huxley was invited to deliver the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] on ''Rare Animals and the Disappearance of Wild Life''.

In his essay ''The Crowded World'' Huxley was openly critical of Communist and [[Catholic]] attitudes to [[birth control]], [[population control]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. Based on variable rates of [[compound interest]], Huxley predicted a probable [[world population]] of 6&amp;nbsp;billion by 2000. The [[United Nations Population Fund]] marked 12 October 1999 as [[The Day of Six Billion]].&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Thomas and Julian, and Osborn, F.R. 1958. ''Three essays on population''. Mentor.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Julian 1950. Population and human destiny. ''Harpers'', September 1950.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julie Doiron''' (born June 28, 1972 in [[Moncton]], [[New Brunswick]]) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] singer-songwriter of [[Acadian]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120524233207/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=131&amp;csid2=9&amp;fid1=37539 Exclaim – Eric's Trip: Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cba_2008award&gt;{{cite news|title=Feist leads nominees for Indie Music Awards|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2008/01/31/indie-noms.html|work=CBC.ca|accessdate=30 March 2011|date=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been the bass guitarist and co-vocalist for the Canadian indie rock band [[Eric's Trip]] since its formation in 1990. She has released ten solo albums, beginning with 1996's ''[[Broken Girl]]'', and is also the lead singer for the band Julie and the Wrong Guys.

==Career==
Doiron started playing guitar (later switching to bass) in [[Eric's Trip]] at the age of 18, having joined the band at the insistence of her then-boyfriend, Eric's Trip guitarist [[Rick White (musician)|Rick White]]. Shortly before the band's break-up in 1996, she released a solo album under the name '''Broken Girl''', which followed two previous 7" EPs ("Dog Love, Pt. 2" &amp; "Nora") also released under that name. All of her subsequent material has been released under her own name. Although most of her solo material has been written and performed in English, she also released an album of [[French language]] material, ''Désormais''.

[[File:JulieDoiron EricsTrip.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Julie Doiron playing with Eric's Trip in Saskatoon, 2001]]In 1999, Doiron performed at the 1999 Stardust Picnic festival at Historic Fort York, Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000204135613/http://chartattack.com:80/road/reviews/1999/19990721-stardust.html "Live Reviews: The Stardust Picnic"]. ''Chart Attack'', July 11, 1999, Howard Druckman&lt;/ref&gt; That year she recorded an album with the Ottawa band [[Wooden Stars]], which was the first time she had worked with a band since the end of Eric's Trip. She shared a [[Juno Award]] for ''Julie Doiron and the Wooden Stars'' in March 2000.

Eric's Trip reunited in 2001, and have played shows periodically ever since. She has also appeared as a guest musician on albums by [[The Tragically Hip]] (2000s ''[[Music at Work]]''), [[Gordon Downie]] (2001's ''[[Coke Machine Glow]]'', 2003's ''[[Battle of the Nudes (album)|Battle of the Nudes]]'' and 2010's ''[[The Grand Bounce]]''), and [[Herman Düne]]. She has also released a [[split record]] co-credited to the [[alternative country]] band [[Okkervil River (band)|Okkervil River]], and collaborated with [[Frederick Squire]] and American musician [[Phil Elverum]] on the 2008 [[Mount Eerie]] album ''[[Lost Wisdom]]''. She played with indie rock band [[Shotgun &amp; Jaybird]] until their demise in 2007. She also played drums as part of a short-lived duo with Fred Squire.  Initially called "Blue Heeler", they changed their name to "Calm Down Its Monday", and released a split 7" EP on K Records, with two solo Doiron songs on the flip side.

Apart from her musical career, Doiron is an avid photographer, having published a book of her photographs entitled ''The Longest Winter'' with words by Ottawa writer Ian Roy. She often does her own promotional photos and cover artwork along with her ex-husband, painter Jon Claytor.

Her album ''[[Woke Myself Up]]'' was shortlisted for the [[2007 Polaris Music Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/07/10/polaris-shortlist.html?ref=rss|title=Arcade Fire, Feist on Polaris short list |accessdate=July 10, 2007 | work=CBC News | date=July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2007/07/10/4328574-cp.html |title=Feist, Fire get Polaris noms |accessdate=July 11, 2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20071011225300/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2007/07/10/4328574-cp.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/43988/arcade-fire-feist-and-the-dears-among-polaris-nominees |title=Arcade Fire, Feist And The Dears Among Polaris Nominees |last=Love |first=Noah |date=2007-07-10 |publisher=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]] |accessdate=2008-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221221217/http://www.chartattack.com/news/43988/arcade-fire-feist-and-the-dears-among-polaris-nominees |archivedate=2008-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Doiron told a reporter from ''The Strand'', a college newspaper at the [[University of Toronto]], that she and [[Chad VanGaalen]] were exploring the possibility of collaborating on an album.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Bender, [http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2009/04/09/FilmMusic/Living.The.Life.Of.Dreams-3706730.shtml "Living the life of dreams"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416042855/http://media.www.thestrand.ca/media/storage/paper404/news/2009/04/09/FilmMusic/Living.The.Life.Of.Dreams-3706730.shtml |date=2009-04-16 }}. ''The Strand'', April 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She appeared on a track from VanGaalen's EP of ''[[Soft Airplane]]'' B-sides that year, but no further news pertaining to a potential album collaboration has been released.

During the tour to support the 2009 album ''[[I Can Wonder What You Did with Your Day]]'', the mayor of [[Bruno, Saskatchewan|Bruno]], [[Saskatchewan]] proclaimed June 7, 2009 as "Julie Doiron Day". Doiron performed at the local All Citizens arts centre on that day.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120524233209/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=133&amp;csid2=844&amp;fid1=39104 "June 7 Named Julie Doiron Day in Bruno, Saskatchewan"]. ''[[Exclaim!]]'', June 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the three-year period between ''I Can Wonder'' and her 2012 album ''[[So Many Days]]'', Doiron moved several times, residing at different times in [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]] and [[Sackville, New Brunswick|Sackville]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://exclaim.ca/MusicVideo/ClickHear/julie_doiron-so_many_days_album_stream "Julie Doiron, 'So Many Days' (album stream)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227091910/http://exclaim.ca/MusicVideo/ClickHear/julie_doiron-so_many_days_album_stream |date=2012-12-27 }}. ''[[Exclaim!]]'', October 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; While living in Toronto, she had difficulty making ends meet due to the city's high cost of living,&lt;ref name=savingjulie&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/music/saving-julie-doiron-one-small-show-at-a-time/article4085871/ "Saving Julie Doiron, one small show at a time"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', January 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and began teaching [[yoga]] classes, and performing a weekly residency at the Saving Gigi club, to help pay the bills.&lt;ref name=savingjulie /&gt; By the time ''So Many Days'' was released in the fall of 2012, she had moved back to Sackville.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timescolonist.com/entertainment/days-in-the-life-of-julie-doiron-1.12554 "Days in the life of Julie Doiron"]. ''[[Victoria Times Colonist]]'', November 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2014, Doiron's song "The Life of Dreams", from ''I Can Wonder What You Did with Your Day'', appeared in an [[iPhone]] commercial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/julie-doiron-strikes-deal-for-apple-ad-using-life-of-dreams-song-1.2708423 "Julie Doiron strikes deal for Apple ad using Life of Dreams song"]. [[CBC News]], July 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Doiron collaborated with musicians Jon McKiel, C.L. McLaughlin, Michael C. Duguay, James Anderson and Chris Meaney on the project Weird Lines, whose self-titled album was released on Sappy Futures in July.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exclaim.ca/music/article/weird_lines-weird_lines_album_stream "Weird Lines: Weird Lines (album stream)"]. ''[[Exclaim!]]'', July 4, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She then collaborated with [[Eamon McGrath]], Mike Peters and Jaye Schwarzer on the project Julie and the Wrong Guys, which released a self-titled album in 2017 on [[Dine Alone Records]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://exclaim.ca/music/article/julie_and_the_wrong_guys_detail_self-titled_debut_lp  "Julie Doiron &amp; the Wrong Guys Reveal Debut Album, Share New Song"].

He also serves as Chief Commissioner for [[The Kenya Scouts Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vice President Pres Service|title=Kalonzo hails scouts for supporting tourism|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/archives/InsidePage.php?id=2000015674&amp;cid=159&amp;|publisher=Standard Group Limited|accessdate=27 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He was born in Tseikuru, in a remote part of Mwingi District (then part of [[Kitui District]]) in Kenya's [[Eastern Province (Kenya)|Eastern Province]]. Between 1960 and 1967 he studied at Tseikuru Full Primary School to attain basic education. Then he went to Kitui High School in [[Kitui]] for the ordinary level and eventually to Meru School in [[Meru, Kenya|Meru]] from where he graduated in the advanced level in 1973. Kalonzo Musyoka graduated with a Bachelor of Law degree from the [[University of Nairobi]] in 1977. He continued further studies at the [[Kenya School of Law]] in 1978 where he was awarded a Post graduate diploma in Law. In 1979, he attended the Mediterranean Institute of Management in [[Cyprus]] where he earned a post graduate Diploma in Business.&lt;ref name="Nationprofile"&gt;Daily Nation [http://politics.nationmedia.com/kalonzo.asp Profile of Kalonzo Musyoka] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017041400/http://politics.nationmedia.com/kalonzo.asp |date=17 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in divinity among other 17 beneficiaries at the Charter hall in [[Nairobi]]. This was one the "honorary professorships and doctorate degrees" that were issued by Professor Clyde Rivers, the International Commissioner of the [[Latin University of Theology]], based in [[Inglewood, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=SAMUEL|first1=OTIENO|title=US varsity floods Kenya with PhDs|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/archives/print.php?id=2000013995&amp;cid=4|accessdate=26 April 2012|author2=JIBRIL ADAN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; On 19 December 2008, Kalonzo Musyoka was honoured with a Doctorate in Humane Letters ([[honoris causa]]) in recognition of his achievements in peace making, conflict resolution efforts, sustainable community development and humanistic ideals by [[Kenyatta University]] during its 25th graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=KU Honours Eminent Persons|url=http://www.ku.ac.ke/images/stories/docs/newsletters/vol4_issue15.pdf|publisher=Office of the Vice-Chancellor, Kenyatta University|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named African Dignitary Man of the year 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2000212765/wiper-party-celebrates-kalonzo-musyoka-s-prize|title=Wiper party celebrates Kalonzo Musyoka’s prize|last=Kajilwa|first=Graham|work=The Standard|access-date=2018-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Musyoka vied for the Kitui North Constituency parliamentary seat in 1983, but was defeated. At the time, Kenya was one-party state and the only party fielding candidates was [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU). However, only two years later, in 1985 the Kitui North seat was vacated and Musyoka won subsequent by-elections, thus becoming an MP at the age of 32. In 1986 he was appointed Assistant Minister for Works, Housing and Physical Planning, serving until 1988. He was re-elected at the 1988 parliamentary elections and served as Deputy Speaker of the National assembly from 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of the Vice President|url=http://www.information.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=396&amp;Itemid=524|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 1992. He was also KANU's National Organizing Secretary from 1988 to 2002.

===1992–1997 Kenyan Parliament===
Kenya's first multiparty elections were held in 1992. Musyoka stayed in KANU, renewed his parliamentary position and was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation. He also held couple of other ministerial positions while part of the KANU government.
In June 1993, he addressed the [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Austria which was the first human rights conference held since the end of the [[Cold War]]. He termed the illicit mineral trade which fuels and finances what he called 'the cause of incessant conflicts, environmental degradation but ultimately and sadly too, poverty'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deborah Eade and Morna Macleod|title=Women and armed conflict: from victims to activists|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/download.php?id=1017|publisher=State of the World's Minorities and Indigenous Peoples 2011|accessdate=26 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110185813/http://www.minorityrights.org/download.php?id=1017|archivedate=10 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] was the major result from this meeting after the participants reached a consensus.&lt;ref name="norchi-87"&gt;{{cite book | last=Norchi | first=Charles | chapter=Human Rights: A Global Common Interest | editor=Krasno, Jean E. | title=The United Nations: Confronting the Challenges of a Global Society | publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]] | year=2004 | isbn=1588262804 | page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1997–2002 Kenyan Parliament===
He was again elected to the parliament at the 1997 elections, but now from [[Mwingi North Constituency]], since his former constituency Kitui North was split into new constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Multiparty Democracy: [http://www.cmd.or.ke/images/Politics%20and%20Paliamenterians%20in%20Kenya.pdf Politics and Parliamentarians in Kenya 1944–2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028212845/http://www.cmd.or.ke/images/Politics%20and%20Paliamenterians%20in%20Kenya.pdf |date=28 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002–2007 Kenyan Parliament===
In the months leading up to the [[Kenyan general election, 2002|2002 general election]], under the leadership of then KANU secretary general, [[Raila Odinga]], he decamped from KANU to join the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Kenya)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) as a founding member under the banner of the [[National Rainbow Coalition]], which went on to win the general elections.

On 1 December 2003, as the Minister for home affairs and international co-operation for [[Kenya]], he welcomed the people to this meeting, whose theme was Strengthening the role of IGAD in regional peace initiatives and post conflict reconstruction on behalf of the republic of Kenya and thanked the Danish government, [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development|IGAD]] Secretariat and the ISS on behalf of the&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=STRENGTHENING THE ROLE OF IGAD IN REGIONAL PEACE INITIATIVES AND POST CONFLICT RECONSTRUCTION|url=http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/CReports/IGADDec03/IGAD.htm|work=Institute of Security Studies|accessdate=25 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012063755/http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/CReports/IGADDec03/IGAD.htm|archivedate=12 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Intergovernmental Authority on Development#Current member states|IGAD Member States]] for their preparations and funding of the meeting. Kalonzo Musyoka was involved in the Sudan peace process between 1993 and 1997 and he was part of the team that reconstituted the draft establishing IGAD in 1995.

Musyoka became Minister for Foreign Affairs for a second time under President [[Mwai Kibaki]], but in a cabinet reshuffle on 30 June 2004 he was moved to the post of Minister for the Environment. In late August 2004, he was additionally removed from his position as chairman of the Sudanese and Somali peace talks and was replaced by [[John Koech]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article5027 "Kenyan Kalonzo removed from Somali and Soudanese peace talks role"], ''The Nation'' (sudantribune.com), 27 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Musyoka was reportedly unhappy with President Kibaki's refusal to honour a pre-election ''Memorandum of understanding'' (MOU) which they had signed with the president's party [[National Alliance Party of Kenya|NAK]]. He was one of the leaders of the successful "No"-campaign in the [[2005 Kenyan constitutional referendum|November 2005 referendum on the proposed new constitution]]. Following the referendum, he was dismissed from the Cabinet.&lt;ref name=Miracle&gt;Patrick Nzioka, [http://allafrica.com/stories/200801080938.html "Kenya: Kalonzo Miracle Taking Shape"], ''The Nation'' (allAfrica.com), 9 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Kalonzo Musyoka decamped [[Liberal Democratic Party (Kenya)|Liberal Democratic Party]] (LDP) into the little-known Labor Party of Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=AMADALA|first=BENSON|title=Kenya: Rivals Now Plan to Register New ODM|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200708050015.html|publisher=All Africa News|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalonzo Musyoka was widely expected to vie for the presidency in the [[Kenyan presidential election, 2007|December 2007 election]]. Musyoka campaigned for the ODM-Kenya ticket, facing a number of other contenders. His rating for December 2007 election steadily dropped, and political analysts wondered whether he would make a significant impact. His relationship with fellow ODM-Kenya leader [[Raila Odinga]], who was also after the ODM-Kenya presidential ticket, was the subject of much speculation. Many observers questioned whether the presidential hopefuls of ODM-Kenya, particularly Raila and Musyoka, could unite to support one common candidate for the general election.

The ODM-Kenya split into two factions, one gathered around Musyoka and the other around Odinga, in August 2007. Musyoka was elected by his faction as its presidential candidate on 31 August 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Webb, [http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-08-31-voa34.cfm "Kenya's Opposition Chooses Presidential Candidate"], VOA News, 31 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hoist&gt;Eric Shimoli and Dave Opiyo, [http://allafrica.com/stories/200708311137.html "Kenya: Kalonzo Picked to Hoist ODM-K Flag"], ''The Nation'' (allAfrica.com), 1 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; receiving 2,835 votes in a secret ballot against Julia Ojiambo, who received 791 votes.&lt;ref name=Hoist/&gt;

Musyoka has been quoted as saying "... the war against poverty could not be won unless environmental issues were addressed."{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

Musyoka launched his [[Kenyan presidential election, 2007|presidential campaign]] at [[Uhuru Park]] in Nairobi on 14 October 2007. This move was criticised by those who saw him as a traitor to the ODM party of Raila Odinga. Kalonzo however said that "atapitia katikati" (passing between two people).

===After 2007===
[[File:Kalonzo Musyoka Greeting People in Mombasa.JPG|thumb|Musyoka greeting people in Mombasa]]
According to official results, Musyoka placed a distant third behind Kibaki and Odinga with 9% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communication.go.ke/elections/default.asp Page on 2007 results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405202149/http://www.communication.go.ke/elections/default.asp |date=5 April 2008 }} at Office of the Government Spokesman.&lt;/ref&gt; Amid a [[Kenyan crisis, 2007-2008|violent crisis]] over the results, with supporters of Kibaki and Odinga disputing the outcome, Kibaki appointed Musyoka as Vice-President and Minister of Home Affairs on 8 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200801080673.html "Kenya: Kibaki Names Cabinet"], ''The East African Standard'' (allAfrica.com), 8 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Musyoka expressed gratitude to Kibaki and, referring to the ongoing dispute and violence, said that he was "intensely aware that the appointment has come at a difficult time when our nation is going through a painful moment".&lt;ref name=Miracle/&gt; He took office as Vice-President on 9 January.&lt;ref&gt;Mutinda Mwanzia, [http://allafrica.com/stories/200801100789.html "Kenya: Awori Hands Over to Kalonzo"], ''The East African Standard'' (allAfrica.com), 10 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vice President of Kenya (7886399918).jpg|thumb|Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka meeting the British Foreign Secretary William Hague in London, 29 August 2012]]

The political crisis eventually led to the signing of a power-sharing agreement between Kibaki and Odinga. In the Grand Coalition Cabinet that was announced on 13 April 2008, Musyoka remained Vice-President and Minister of Home Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7345318.stm "Kenya unveils coalition cabinet"], BBC News, 13 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Kariuki, [http://politics.nationmedia.com/inner.asp?pcat=NEWS&amp;cat=TOP&amp;sid=1787 "Kibaki names Raila PM in new Cabinet"]{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, nationmedia.com, 13 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Musyoka supported the draft constitution in the campaign for [[Kenyan constitutional referendum, 2010|4 August referendum]] but Members of the campaign team opposing the draft constitution claimed that he was secretly opposing the draft leading to a satirical comparison of Musyoka to a watermelon which is naturally green outside and red inside, the team supporting the draft constitution was represented by color green while the team opposing the draft constitution was represented by the color red hence the "green team" and the "red team", Musyoka's nickname watermelon was because of his alleged open support for the green team and secret support for the red team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kikechi|first=Biketi|title='No' strategy rattles 'Yes'|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/business/article/2000013085/no-strategy-rattles-yes|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the opposition of the draft constitution were the clergy.

===2013 Elections===

In the race for the 4th president of Kenya, Kalonzo Musyoka joined his longtime political opponent [[Raila Odinga]] to form the [[Coalition for Reforms and Democracy]] (CORD) with Musyoka shelving his presidential ambition to run as Odinga's [[running mate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosoku|first=Geoffrey|title=Raila, Kalonzo seal deal as Mudavadi joins Uhuru, Ruto|url=http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/?articleID=2000072150|publisher=Standard Media Group|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=NAMUNANE|first=BERNARD|title=Raila and Kalonzo finally sign deal|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/Raila-and-Kalonzo-finally-sign-deal/-/1064/1635856/-/a3xmex/-/index.html|work=Daily Nation|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the first round of the presidential election took place on 4 March 2013, [[Uhuru Kenyatta]] was declared the [[president-elect]] of [[Kenya]] by the [[Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission]]. [[Raila Odinga]] challenged this in the [[Supreme Court of Kenya]]. Questions were raised why Musyoka was not a petitioner in the case.

After the Supreme Court dismissed the [[The Kenya Presidential Election Petition 2013|CORD Petition]], he left office when the President-elect, Uhuru Kenyatta, was sworn in.

===2017 Elections===

After 5 successive task wins, Edna was brought into the boardroom in Week 6 by Zoe Beresford, where she was accused of claiming credit for the successful ideas of others. When Lord Sugar asked why he should let Edna continue, she highlighted her academic qualifications, but this only resulted in her digging an even bigger hole for herself, and Lord Sugar fired her. She later that she should have brought up her professional experience. She was the only candidate that eventual winner Tom Pellereau didn't work with during the series.

== Zoe Beresford ==
Zoe Beresford, 26, was a pupil of [[Abbots Bromley School]], an [[independent school]] in the village of [[Abbots Bromley]] in [[Staffordshire]], and holds a master's degree in manufacturing, engineering and management from the [[University of Nottingham]],&lt;ref name="SGB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sgboutdoor.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/3878/AMG_appoints_Midlands_North_territory_manager.html |title=AMG appoints Midlands/North territory manager |work=SGB Outdoor |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=2013-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130505053206/http://www.sgboutdoor.co.uk/news/fullstory.php/aid/3878/AMG_appoints_Midlands_North_territory_manager.html |archivedate=5 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; where she was awarded a [[Rolls-Royce plc|Rolls-Royce]] Manufacturing Technology Prize for the School of Engineering's highest dissertation mark.

In week 4 she was placed in the role of Project manager for Venture in the beauty treatments task. She relied on industry expert Susan Ma's advice when choosing product quantities, but halved the size of the order after consideration; even the new quantity proved far too much, as Venture only made a little over £200, a poor figure for such a market. Zoe blamed this on Susan on the task, and on the ''You're Fired'' programme that followed, Felicity Jackson took the view Zoe had been setting Susan up as a potential scapegoat.

In week 6 Zoe took on the role of Project manager again, but on this occasion she lost the task after failing to secure both of the deals arranged by Lord Sugar for waste disposal. Although Zoe was tearful at the end of the first day over the failure, she rallied on the second and Venture made separate deals of their own, so the end result was a difference of only £6. Zoe brought Susan and Edna into the boardroom, and once again came into conflict with Susan, who perceived Zoe as unnecessarily negative and unpleasant, while Zoe considered Susan to be naive and immature. Zoe's survival was mostly a result of her admitting fault at the first opportunity. In week 9, Zoe became project manager for the biscuit-making task, something similar to her day job before the series. However, her decision to manage marketing rather than the factory led to a snap and share biscuit design that was deemed to be too poor a quality to warrant the price. This led to team Logic securing no orders and suffering the worst defeat in the show's history. Lord Sugar decided to fire Zoe for not showcasing her strengths.

== Alex Britez Cabral ==
Twenty-eight-year-old Alex is a manager of an estate agency. Alex was criticised in week 1 for selling only £8 worth on the task, spending most of the day cutting bread and serving soup. Edward Hunter's decision not to bring Alex back into the boardroom was a major reason he was fired. In the second week Alex, was the only member of Logic who did not put himself forward to be project manager, and once again had little presence on the task; the rest of the team declared him the weakest team member on both tasks, with Jim Eastwood going as far as to call him a "spectator". In the boardroom he mounted a vigorous defence, attacking Jim, although Jim countered by stating Alex's contribution had been "nada". Lord Sugar remained unimpressed, and Alex was fired for not showing any leadership potential and for staying in the background rather than stepping up.

In a clip shown on ''You're Fired!'' he was mocked by fellow contestant Glenn Ward who said "Alex? I always forget him." owing to him staying in the background.

== Vincent Disneur ==
Vincent Disneur was educated at [[St. Anselm's Catholic School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courier.co.uk/Apprentice-wind-just-wants-reaction/story-12020808-detail/story.html|title=Apprentice 'wind-up' just wants a reaction  2011|work=Kent and Sussex Courier|date=13 May 2011|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[voluntary aided school|voluntary aided]] Roman Catholic secondary school in [[Canterbury]] in [[Kent]].

Disneur stepped up to lead the team in the fifth week of the process, but was subsequently fired alongside Ellie Reed in a double firing. While on ''The Apprentice'', Vincent had never been on a winning team.

== Leon Doyle ==
Leon Doyle is a 26-year-old graduate who was educated at two [[independent school]]s in the town of [[Harrogate]] in [[Yorkshire]], at which he was a day boarder: at [[West End Preparatory School, Harrogate|West End Preparatory School]],&lt;ref name=HarInf&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.harrogate-news.co.uk/2011/06/23/youre-fired-leon-doyle-interviewed-following-his-exit-from-the-apprentice/|title=You’re fired! - Leon Doyle interviewed following his exit from the Apprentice|work=Harrogate Informer|date=23 June 2011|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a former boys' preparatory school and [[Ashville College]],&lt;ref name=HarInf/&gt; a co-educational senior school, followed by the [[University of Huddersfield]]. He lived in Leeds and founded the business 'The Master Menu'. He was fired on 22 June (week 8), during a task concerning taking British products into the French Market. He was accused of not contributing enough to the task and using the language barrier as an excuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/local-west-yorkshire-news/2011/05/06/huddersfield-takeaway-tycoon-leon-doyle-to-star-on-the-apprentice-86081-28643306/ |title=Huddersfield takeaway tycoon Leon Doyle to star on The Apprentice - Huddersfield Examiner |publisher=Examiner.co.uk |date=6 May 2011 |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jim Eastwood ==
{{Main|Jim Eastwood}}
Jim Eastwood is a 32-year-old Sales &amp; Marketing Manager from [[Northern Ireland]]. He was educated at [[St Mary's Grammar School]], a state grammar school in [[Magherafelt]], and went on to study at the [[University of Ulster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/ulsterman-aims-to-be-alan-sugars-next-apprentice-28613491.html|title=Ulsterman aims to be Sugar's next Apprentice|work=Belfast Telegraph|author=Sarah Rainey|date=4 May 2011|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eastwood started work in his father's fish &amp; chip shop chipping potatoes from the age of nine and went on to maintain top sales performances as a Sales and Marketing Manager. Jim, who was "All Ireland cycling champion" as a teenager, champions Richard Branson and describes himself as 'driven, self-motivated, resilient and an eternal optimist.' He said that "I'm not a show pony or a one-trick pony, I'm not a jack-ass or a stubborn mule, and I'm definitely not a wild stallion that needs to be tamed. I am the champion thoroughbred that this process requires."

Eastwood made it to the final, where he proposed an education business called "AMSmart" but was eventually fired. On ''[[The Apprentice: You're Fired!]]'', [[Dara Ó Briain]] nicknamed him "Jedi Jim" because of his uncanny ability to persuade and influence people.

== Melody Hossaini ==
{{Main|Melody Hossaini}}
Melody and her family fled from [[Iran]] when she was a child, and after living for a few years in [[Sweden]], they settled in the UK. Melody started school in the UK at the age of 13, and was educated at [[Great Wyrley High School]],&lt;ref name=E&amp;S&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.expressandstar.com/news/2011/07/15/business-blossoms-for-apprentice-star-melody-hossaini/|title=Business blossoms for Apprentice star Melody Hossaini|work=Express &amp; Star|date=15 July 2011|accessdate=20 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state comprehensive school in the large village of [[Great Wyrley]] in [[South Staffordshire]]. She says that she felt culturally different from the other pupils, some of whom "had not even visited London", while she had lived in several countries. Nevertheless, she performed well in her GCSEs and A-levels before going on to [[Oxford Brookes University]], where she obtained a 2:1 LLB Hons. Law degree. She has lived in four countries and speaks five different languages.&lt;ref name=E&amp;S/&gt;

Melody was the first ever Social Entrepreneur to compete on The Apprentice. Melody is the Founder and CEO of social enterprise, InspirEngage International.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inspirengage.com/ |title=InspirEngage International &amp;#124; transforming vision into reality |publisher=Inspirengage.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting her career aged 13, she now specialises in Skills Training to support individuals into employment and enterprise, through delivery of tailored 'InspirEngage Skills Bootcamps'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melodyhossaini.com/ |title=Founder &amp; Director, InspirEngage Ltd |publisher=Melody Hossaini |date= |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began the series confidently, coming up with the team name 'Venture' and winning as Project Manager on the first week and avoiding the boardroom for a number of tasks. She made it to week ten, before being fired by Lord Sugar 'with regret'.

== Edward Hunter ==
Edward is a 25-year-old accountant who was trained by one of the United Kingdom's leading accountancy firms. He was the first candidate to be fired in the seventh series of The Apprentice by Lord Sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityam.com/the-capitalist/harriet-dennys/big-four-hit-back-apprentice-put-down |title=Big Four Hit Back At Apprentice Put-Down &amp;#124; City A.M |publisher=City A.M. |date=13 May 2011 |accessdate=2013-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Felicity Jackson ==
Felicity attended [[St Albans High School for Girls]], an [[independent school]] in [[Hertfordshire]], followed by The Court Theatre Training Company. Felicity has set up Casting Days Ltd, and Surviving Actors Ltd - both aimed at actors, and offers different services to help within their career. After three consecutive victories on team Venture, Felicity was moved to Logic to be Project Manager for the Beauty Treatment task; Lord Sugar commented he had not seen much of her up to this point. Unfortunately, Logic's attempt at the task was a total disaster - Felicity later stated on ''You're Fired'' that several mistakes were not even included in the final cut of the episode. Logic were already disadvantaged before they had started selling, as they not only failed to secure the spray-tan system, but more crucially chose a bad location, with the single treatment room being three floors above their selling stall. Felicity then compounded this mistake by over-ordering on products and failing to drive customers upstairs, which was put down to her poor communication with her teammates. Logic thus made a loss of over £200, and Felicity was fired for extreme indecisiveness and poor decision-making. Felicity has since secured a contract with casting website StarNow for her company Casting Days Ltd. She works with casting directors, agents, directors, producers and many more industry professionals, connecting them with StarNow talent. {{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

== Susan Ma ==
Susan is a 21-year-old Managing Director of Tropic Skin Care Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tropicskincare.com |title=Welcome to Tropic - Pure Plant Skin Care}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was educated at [[Croydon High School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/susan-ma-from-poverty-in-shanghai-to-lord-sugars-boardroom-6425641.html|title=Susan Ma: from poverty in Shanghai to Lord Sugar's boardroom|work=[[London Evening Standard]]|author=Joshi Herrmann|date=25 July 2011|accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[independent school]] for girls in [[Croydon]] in South London, and graduated in 2010 from [[University College London]] with a 2:1 in Philosophy and Economics. She was described by [[Nick Hewer]] as "a little force to be reckoned with"...&amp;nbsp; At the beginning of the process, Susan had difficulty making herself heard, but in Week 3 led Venture to a narrow victory on the Discount Buying task - although her team only got small discounts, they managed to locate 9 of the 10 items, in contrast to Logic's 6. Her performance in week 4 on the Beauty Treatments task was less impressive - as the industry expert in cosmetics, she advised Zoe Beresford on key decisions at the start of the task, but was blamed for a massive overspend on products that left the team with a small profit. While Lord Sugar criticised this mistake, Susan was visibly angered by Zoe's attitude, particularly during the task when Zoe confronted her about the excess stock, which Susan saw as an attempt to make her a scapegoat. Tensions rose again in week 6 on the Rubbish task, as Zoe dismissed Susan's suggestion to secure clients set up by Lord Sugar for waste disposal by paying a small fee for valuable scrap, and insisted on charging for the team's services. Susan was vindicated when both clients opted for the deals offered by Logic, and Venture lost the task as a result. Zoe brought Susan into the boardroom for being a weak contributor and an annoying presence, but Susan acquitted herself well, and although she interrupted Lord Sugar's deliberations, she escaped with only a warning.

Susan was brought into the boardroom again the following week, this time by Jim Eastwood after the magazine task, and was branded the "mouse" of team Venture due to her consistent failure to make herself heard. She responded with an impassioned defence, and survived while Glenn Ward was fired. In week 8, she took on the role of project manager again to sell English products in Paris, and despite some rather bizarre questions about the French, made good choices with her products, while Helen Milligan secured a huge order from a major retailer, achieving the largest Apprentice victory in terms of cash margin at the time.

In the final, Susan offered up the best overall business plan of the four finalists, but was let down by her boasts about how much money could be generated in the first few years. Deciding that Susan needed more experience in the world of business, Lord Sugar fired her, along with fellow contestants Helen Milligan and Jim Eastwood, as inventor Tom Pellereau went on to win the series.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} In ''You're Hired!'', Lord Sugar said that he had always wished to be associated with skin care business, and that with Tom's nail filer on board, he would keep in touch with Susan to assemble a team.

== Helen Milligan ==
Helen was born in Stockport, Greater Manchester in October 1980.&lt;ref&gt;[http://helenmilligan.co.uk/about-me.aspx About Me] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128082202/http://www.helenmilligan.co.uk/about-me.aspx# |date=28 January 2013 }} from [http://helenmilligan.co.uk/ Helen Milligan homepage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128080718/http://www.helenmilligan.co.uk/# |date=28 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a degree from [[De Montfort University]] in Law (2:1), Helen worked as a Business Development Support Manager at BB's Coffee and Muffins. Most recently she has acted as an executive assistant to the CEO following a spell as a regional manager for Gregg's in the Midlands.&lt;ref name="investoo.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.investoo.co.uk/revealed-the-real-jobs-of-the-apprentice-stars/ |title=Revealed!

Previously, the record was held by James Max and Tre Azam, who won six consecutive tasks in Series 1 and 3 respectively. She also holds the record for the best performance in the series (10-1 win/lose ratio) and holds the joint record for success a project manager 3-0, with series five winner Yasmina Siadatan. In addition, she made the most money during the programme than anyone else, breaking the record for the most money ever won on a task in Week 8, and then breaking her own record again in Week 9. She was the Runner-Up of series 7 of the show.
She has now been promoted by Greggs to Head Of Retail in the South East.

== Tom Pellereau ==
Tom was educated at [[Twyford School]], a co-educational [[independent school]] in the village of Twyford in [[Hampshire]], before moving to [[St Edward's School, Oxford]] aged 13. He achieved a 1st class degree as well as a masters in Mechanical Engineering and Innovation from the [[University of Bath]]. His ambition has always been to be an inventor and this is reflected by his continued approach to product development. Some of his inventions to date have included: the Stylfile (a curved nail file), an Ethical Goods brand that connects brands with relevant charities, Mode Diagnostics (bowel cancer screening tool), Babisil (first collapsible silicon baby bottle) and the Amadeus acoustic screen for musicians.

Tom remained on team Logic for the entire series, and thus gained a win:loss ratio of 3:8, the worst of any UK Apprentice winner. In the first 5 weeks, where he lost every task, he gained a reputation for being a "hindsight man" and alongside fellow contestant [[Jim Eastwood]], his strategy of getting out of the last three for the first five weeks during Logic's losing streak was discussed on the spin-off special ''How to Get Hired''; there were several occasions where he identified key flaws in the team strategy, but lacked the force of character to persuade his fellow candidates to change course. A notable example was in the advertising task, when Tom unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Vincent Disneur and Jim Eastwood that their branding choice would make the product unsellable; Vincent was subsequently fired, while Jim had a narrow escape. Tom was later elected as Project Manager to sell in France, and although his instincts about the products were correct, he was persuaded otherwise by Melody Hossaini, and Logic suffered a catastrophic loss. Tom only avoided firing because Leon Doyle had even less presence in the team than he did. He then had another close call in Week 9, where his biscuit design was universally panned and earned no orders whatsoever. However, his third boardroom appearance happened more by default; Tom was responsible for half of Logic's revenue, while Melody and Helen Milligan had pursued a totally unsustainable strategy that saw them lose despite Venture earning a considerable fine.

In the final of the series, Tom came under fire for his poorly written up business plan for office equipment for back problems, but was praised for his creativity and business experience. He was subsequently declared the winner of The Apprentice from series seven.&lt;ref name="investoo.co.uk"/&gt;  Although Tom won the series, Sugar rejected the initial business plan and instead encouraged him to expand the Stylfile into a range of grooming products.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The X Factor'' finalists (Australia season 4)}}
The [[The X Factor (Australia season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[The X Factor (Australian TV series)|The X Factor Australia]]'' was broadcast on the [[Seven Network]]. It premiered on 20 August 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knox|first=David|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/08/returning-the-x-factor-2.html|title=Returning: The X Factor|publisher=[[TV Tonight]]|date=2012-08-05|accessdate=2012-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ended on 20 November 2012.&lt;ref name="finalresults"&gt;{{cite web|last=Knox|first=David|url=http://www.tvtonight.com.au/2012/11/samantha-jade-wins-the-x-factor-2012.html|title=Samantha Jade wins The X Factor 2012|publisher=TV Tonight|date=2012-11-20|accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show consisted of several stages: auditions, super bootcamp, home visits and live shows.

===Josh Brookes===
Josh Brookes was a 20-year-old contestant from [[Perth]], Western Australia,&lt;ref name="boyfactor"/&gt; who auditioned for ''The X Factor'' singing [[Eric Clapton]]'s "[[Tears in Heaven]]".&lt;ref name="joshbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/x-factor/contestants/josh-brookes/ |title=The X-Factor Australia Contestant – Josh Brookes |work=The X Factor Australia |publisher=Yahoo!7 |date=2012-09-13 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AdNFB3Q1?url=http://au.tv.yahoo.com/x-factor/contestants/josh-brookes/ |archivedate=12 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brookes began singing at age of ten as a way of coping with his [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]].&lt;ref name="hopefuls"/&gt; During high school, he attended [[Mindarie Senior College]].&lt;ref name="josh&amp;sam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Vanessa|url=http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/entertainment/access-all-areas/a/-/14881048/josh-sam-are-x-tra-special/|title=Josh &amp; Sam are X-tra special|work=The West Australian|publisher=Seven West Media Limited|date=2012-09-18|accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brookes originally auditioned for the [[The X Factor (Australia season 3)|third season]] of ''The X Factor'' in 2011, but was eliminated during the [[The X Factor (Australia season 3)#Bootcamp|bootcamp]] round to [[Johnny Ruffo]].&lt;ref name="joshbio"/&gt; He stated that his "failure" to make it past bootcamp inspired him to audition again.&lt;ref name="joshbio"/&gt; Brookes cites [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]] and [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]] as his musical influences.&lt;ref name="joshbio"/&gt;

== Biography ==
Ighilahriz was born in [[Oujda]] to a Berber family and her family moved to [[Algiers]] in 1948. Through born in Morocco, the Ighilhriz family originated from the [[Kabylie]] region of Algeria, whose Berber tribes had been some of the most fiercest opponents of French rule in Algeria. When hearing upon the beginning of the [[Algerian War]] on 1 November 1954, her father, who worked as a baker told her: "It is the end of the humiliation".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===FLN===
Strongly anti-French, Ighilahriz joined the FLN under the codename Lila to work as a courier, smuggling information, weapons and bombs across Algiers in bread baked by her father.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xi.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 September 1957 while traveling with a FLN party, Ighilahriz was ambushed by the French paratroopers at [[Chébli]], badly wounded and captured.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the hospital, Ighilahriz was given the "truth drug" Pentohal to make her talk, which failed to achieve its purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military prison===
At which point, Ighilahriz was taken to a military prison at Paradou Hydra where a French Army captain, Jean Graziani, cut her badges, prodded her wounds with a bayonet and then raped her in her words "with all sorts of objects" to make her talk.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xi.&lt;/ref&gt; For months, Ighilahriz was tortured and raped into attempts to make her reveal what she knew about the FLN before finally breaking down in December 1957, telling her captors everything she knew about the FLN.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 pages xi-xii.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Ighilahriz was not allowed to bath and spent months covered in her own blood, excrement and urine as she was held in a tiny cell.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, William "The Algerian War, the French State and Official Memory" pages 219-239 from ''Réflexions Historiques'', Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2002 page 233&lt;/ref&gt; Ighilahriz remembered: "''Mon urine s’infiltrait sous la bâche du lit de camp, mes excréments se mélangeaient à mes menstrues jusqu’à former une croûte puante''” ("My urine passed through the sheet covering the camp bed, my excrement mixed with my menstrual blood, forming a stinking crust").&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  To further degrade her, Ighilahriz was forced to live completely naked during her entire time at the military prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As soon as I heard the sound of their boots in the hallway, I began to tremble. Then time became endless. The minutes seemed like hours, and the hours like days. The hardest thing was handling the first days, to get used to the pain. Then one would be detached mentally, as if the body began to float.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Massu was brutal, awful. Bigeard was not better, but the worst was Graziani. It’s unspeakable, he was a pervert who took pleasure in torturing. It was not human. I often yelled at him: “You’re not a man if you do not finish me! ”  And he answered with a sneer: “Not yet, not yet!”  During these three months, I had one goal: to kill myself, but the worst suffering, is to want at all costs to erase oneself and to not find the means."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Il était toujours armé d’ustensiles pour s’acharner contre mon plâtre''” ("But he did not carry out most of his torture with his bare hands. He was always armed with implements to attack my plaster cast").&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ighilahriz's family also suffered as she recalled: "They arrested my parents and most of my siblings. My mother has undergone waterboarding for three weeks. One day, they brought before her the youngest of her nine children, my 3 years old little brother, and they hung him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"Richaud" told Ighilahriz that she reminded him of his daughter who was about her age, and to whom he was very close.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 109.&lt;/ref&gt; "Richaud" played something of a surrogate father to Ighilahriz as she remembered him telling her: "''Mon petit, vous êtes bien jeune pour le maquis. Je vous en prie, laissez ça aux autres. Aux hommes, par exemple!''" ("My child, you are too young for the resistance. I beg of you, leave that to others, to men, for example!")&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 109.&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar Mildred Mortimer wrote that "Richaud" for all his tenderness and compassion towards Ighilahriz ascribed to the traditional French macho viewpoint that war was entirely for men, seeing her involvement with the FLN as something unnatural for a woman, and noted by contrast that Ighilahriz's father had encouraged his daughters to join the FLN.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer also the irony that through "Richaud" saved Ighilahriz's life that he was a supporter of ''Algérie française'', approving of the goals through not the methods of the French Army in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 109.&lt;/ref&gt;      
      
After confessing, Ighilahriz was taken to France, where was held in prisons in [[Baumettes Prison|Baumettes]], [[La Roquette]], [[Amiens]], [[Fresnes Prison|Fresnes]], [[Toulouse]] and [[Bastia]]. In January 1962, Ighilariz escaped from prison, and was hidden by French Communists in Nice. Under the amnesty of May 1962, Ighilahriz was pardoned. Afterwards, Ighilahriz went to university where she obtained a degree in psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, William "The Algerian War, the French State and Official Memory" pages 219-239 from ''Réflexions Historiques'', Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2002 page 233&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim Algeria, a woman must be a virgin in order to be married, and the subject of rape is strictly taboo, and upon Ighilahriz's return to Algeria, her mother made her promise never to speak of her ordeal lest it shame the family.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; After independence, the official language of Algeria became Arabic, but French remains the preferred language for the educated classes in Algeria with Algerian university students still studying all subjects except politics, theology and law in French 
while even today cabinet meetings in Algeria are conducted in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Year 2000===
Ighilahriz's story was unknown until 15 June 2000 when '' Le Monde'' newspaper published an interview conducted by the journalist Florence Beaugé with her.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, William "The Algerian War, the French State and Official Memory" pages 219-239 from ''Réflexions Historiques'', Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2002 page 233&lt;/ref&gt; University-educated, secular, fluent in French and very fond of quoting Victor Hugo, Ighilahriz came across in her interview with Beaugé as more French than Algerian, which helped to make her a more appealing victim to the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2016-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ighilahriz stated her reason for going forward after remaining silent for decades as she was too ashamed of what had happened to her was she wanted to see "Richaud" one last time to thank him.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, William "The Algerian War, the French State and Official Memory" pages 219-239 from ''Réflexions Historiques'', Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2002 page 233&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interview===
In her interview, Ighilahriz stated that both General [[Marcel Bigeard]] and General [[Jacques Massu]] had been present when she was raped and tortured.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, William "The Algerian War, the French State and Official Memory" pages 219-239 from ''Réflexions Historiques'', Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2002 page 233&lt;/ref&gt; Bigeard stated in an interview that her story was a "tissue of lies" meant to "destroy all that is decent in France" and denied Richaud even existed.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, William "The Algerian War, the French State and Official Memory" pages 219-239 from ''Réflexions Historiques'', Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2002 page 234&lt;/ref&gt; Massu told the French media that he was not present when Ighilahriz was tortured and raped, saying he could not remember her, but expressed "regret" that the paras had engaged in torture and used rape as an interrogation tool, saying that there were things that had happened in Algeria that he wished had never happened.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, William "The Algerian War, the French State and Official Memory" pages 219-239 from ''Réflexions Historiques'', Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2002 page 234&lt;/ref&gt; Massu confirmed the existence of Richaud, saying that Ighilahriz must had been referring to Dr. François Richaud, who had been the doctor stationed at the prison in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, William "The Algerian War, the French State and Official Memory" pages 219-239 from ''Réflexions Historiques'', Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2002 page 234&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Richaud had died on 21 September 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, William "The Algerian War, the French State and Official Memory" pages 219-239 from ''Réflexions Historiques'', Vol. 28, No. 2, Summer 2002 page 234&lt;/ref&gt; A devout Catholic, Massu had written to Pope Pius XII in February 1957 to complain that the Catholic archbishop of Algiers was not giving his men sufficient spiritual support as they went about the business of torture, and in March 1957 his conscience was greatly eased when the Catholic chaplain attached to his unit told him that God approved of torture as the only way to defeat the FLN, who were all Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Douglas "Re-Viewing the Battle of Algiers with Germaine Tillion" pages 93-115 from ''History Workshop Journal'', Volume 60, Autumn 2005 page 107.&lt;/ref&gt; After Ighilarhiz had accused him of torturing her in 2000, General Massu visited his parish priest for confession, and afterwards announced that he changed his mind about torture, saying he now believed it was not necessary to win the Battle of Algiers.&lt;ref&gt;Reid, Douglas "Re-Viewing the Battle of Algiers with Germaine Tillion" pages 93-115 from ''History Workshop Journal'', Volume 60, Autumn 2005 page 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Year 2001===
After the interview, Ighilahriz dictated her life story to the French journalist [[Anne Nivat]] which was published in 2001 as ''Algérienne'', becoming a bestseller in France.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Nivat stated about her first impression of Ighilahriz: "''Dès la première seconde où j’ai croisé son regard, j’ai cru en cette femme...Je savais qu’elle parlerait, parce qu’elle avait beaucoup à raconter et souhaitait le raconter. Je n’ai pas été déçue''" (From the moment our eyes met, I believed in this woman. . . . I knew that she would speak, because she had a lot to say and wanted to speak out. I was not disappointed).&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 108.&lt;/ref&gt; As Algeria is a Muslim nation, the subject of rape is taboo, and Mortimer wrote that it was significant that Ighilahriz's story was published in French rather than her native Berber or Arabic as the story of a Berber woman being raped is unpublishable in Algeria, even today.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 107.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of ''Algérienne'', Ighilahriz stated that her decision to go forward with her story took place over the opposition of her family, her colleagues and the Algerian government, all of whom felt that the story of a Berber woman being raped was deeply shameful.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 108 &amp; 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer wrote through Ighilahriz suffered terribly, the purpose of her story is more to pay tribute to Dr. Richaud rather than to express rage at her torturers and rapists.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

A key moment in ''Algérienne'' was when Ighilarhriz and her sister Ouardia visited the grave of Dr. Richaud to place flowers before his tombstone.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 108.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 September 2000, the Ighilahriz sisters and Nivat visited the tomb of Dr. Richaud, where the sisters offered him a symbolic cup of coffee as a way of thanks.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 pages 108-109.&lt;/ref&gt; The ritual performed by the Ighilariz sisters at the grave of  Dr. Richaud was not Algerian at all, but rather Mexican as it is common in Mexico on 1 November, the ''Día de Muertos'' ("Day of the Dead"), for families to have picnics on the graves of deceased family members where drinks and food are symbolically offered to the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 pages 108-109.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer wrote the Ighilariz sisters were nominally Muslim, but the two women chose to adopt a barely veiled pagan ritual from Mexico as a way to form a connection with the deceased Dr. Richaud.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, the Ighilahriz sisters met with Richaud's daughter to give her their thanks for her father's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 108.&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 December 2000, Ouardia Ighilahriz returned alone to Richaud's grave to place a plaque reading ''"Où que tu sois, tu seras toujours parmi nous. Louisette''" ("Wherever you are, you will always be among us. Louisette").&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 pages 108-109.&lt;/ref&gt; Attached to the plaque was a handwritten note with a drawing of a dove carrying an olive branch reading: "''Avec toute ma gratitude.—Louisette''" ("With all my gratitude.–Louisette").&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 pages 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortimer noted that the university-educated and independent-minded Ighilahriz was fluent in French, but chose not to write down her own story, instead dictating it to Nivat, and had to be accompanied by Nivat and her sister to Dr. Richaud's tomb, which for her was evidence of the extraordinary difficult nature of Ighilahriz's experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer further noted how much emotional support Ighilariz drew from fellow women as her sister Ouardia and Nivat played a key role in helping her confront her past, suggesting the story of ''Algérienne'' is actually the story of three women rather than one.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer commented that it was striking that it came to dealing with the memory of almost unspeakable physical and sexual abuse that besides for Dr. Richuad, all of the emotional support that Ighilahriz drew upon came from other women.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Maurice Schmitt]] of the French Army accused Ighilahriz of fabricating her entire story in a 2003 essay, making much of the fact that she described Captain Jean Graziani as having green eyes when in fact he had brown eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian historian Barnett Singer came to Bigeard's defense, writing that Ighilahriz was a terrorist whose account was full of "fabrications" and Bigeard was off hunting the FLN in the ''bled'' at the time she was held by the 10th Parachute Division in late 1957.&lt;ref&gt;Singer Barnett ''The Americanization of France: Searching for Happiness after the Algerian War'', Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2013 page 231&lt;/ref&gt; More controversy has centered over the fact that in the first edition of ''Algérienne'', Ighilahriz denied being raped, saying “''Il ne pouvait pas non plus me violer, j’étais trop dégueulasse''!" ("He couldn’t think of raping me. I was too disgusting!"), but testified at the civil trial of General Schmitt that she had been raped.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Mortimer defended Ighilariz under the grounds that given her background in Berber culture where it is considered deeply shameful for an unmarried not to be a virgin that it was natural that she would not want to discuss being raped.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer, Mildred "Tortured Bodies, Resilient Souls: Algeria's Women Combatants Depicted by Danièèle Djamila, Amrane-Minne, Louisette Ighilahriz, and Assia Djebar" pages 101-127 from Research in ''African Literatures'', Volume 43, No. 1, Spring 2012 page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rather more unexpectedly, [[Saadi Yacef]], a leading FLN terrorist who is currently a senator in Algeria, attacked Ighilahriz in 2011, claiming she was never a member of the FLN and lied about being raped, stating she is "''excellent dans l'art de faire de la comédie''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Schmidt, Ighilariz stated that after the passage of almost 50 years, she may have misremembered small details and the way in which Schmidt obsessively tried to discredit her over small mistakes suggested the French Army on an institutional level was still not willing to admit that it engaged in torture and rape during the Algerian War. In response to Yacef, Ighilariz accused him of breaking under torture when he was captured by the French and stated that as a Berber Muslim man, he was angry at her for breaking the taboo surrounding rape in Berber culture.&lt;ref&gt;Rahal, Malika "Fused Together and Torn Apart: Stories and Violence in Contemporary Algeria" pages 118-151 from ''History and Memory'', Volume 24, No. 1, Spring/Summer 2012 page 146.&lt;/ref&gt; Ighilariz also suggested that Yacef was jealous of the way that her story had come to overshadow his in the popular memory of the Algerian War. Finally, Ighilariz wrote that it was time for the story of the Algerian War to be written in Algeria by professional historians instead of the current situation where the FLN government dictated to historians a version of history that glorified the FLN.&lt;ref&gt;Rahal, Malika "Fused Together and Torn Apart: Stories and Violence in Contemporary Algeria" pages 118-151 from ''History and Memory'', Volume 24, No. 1, Spring/Summer 2012 page 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British historian [[Martin Thomas (historian)|Martin Thomas]] wrote that Ighilahriz's interview and her book generated a major "media storm" in France in 2000-2001 as her account of physical and sexual abuse while in the custody for three months in late 1957 of the 10th Paratroop Division resonated with the French people, making her into the face of victims of torture in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page 462.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas further noted that at the same time that ''Algérienne'' was a bestseller, another book about the Algerian War, namely ''Services spéciaux Algérie 1955-1957'' by General [[Paul Aussaresses]], was an even bigger bestseller in France.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas also noted that ''Services spéciaux Algérie 1955-1957'' was translated into English as ''The Battle of the Casbah: Terrorism and Counter-Terrorism in Algeria, 1955-1957'' while ''Algérienne'' still awaits its translation.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas argued many people even today in the West still attach greater value to the lives of Westerners over non-Westerners, which explains why a book by a Frenchman, Aussaresses, describing and justifying torture as a legitimate counter-terrorism tactic in the [[Battle of Algiers (1956–57)|Battle of Algiers]] attracts more attention and better sales than does a book by an Algerian woman describing her experiences of the said torture that Aussaresses ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xii.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, Thomas noted in regards to the [[Kenya Emergency]], most people in Britain know of the 32 British settlers killed by the Mau Mau, but very few until recently have been aware of the thousands of Kikuyu killed by British security forces, suggesting there is a certain willful imperial amnesia in both France and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Martin ''Fight or Flight: Britain, France, and their Roads from Empire'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014 page xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marián Čalfa''' (born 7 May 1946, in [[Trebišov]]) is the former [[Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia]] during and after the [[Velvet Revolution]], as well as de facto acting [[President of Czechoslovakia|President]] for 19 days, and was a key facilitator of the smooth transfer of power from [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist]] rule to a new democratic representation.

A [[Slovaks|Slovak]], from 1985 he worked as the head of a legislative department of the Czechoslovak federal government. In April 1988, he became a minister - the chairman of the legislative committee. During the Velvet Revolution, on 10 December 1989, he was appointed Prime Minister in place of discredited [[Ladislav Adamec]].  Although he himself was a member of the KSČ, this government had a non-Communist majority.  He thus headed the first cabinet in 41 years that was not dominated by the KSČ. When President [[Gustáv Husák]] resigned from his office shortly after swearing in the government, Čalfa also took on most presidential duties until the election of [[Václav Havel]] on 29 December.

On 18 January 1990, he left the KSČ to join the [[Public Against Violence]] (VPN) party, the Slovak counterpart of Havel's [[Civic Forum]].  He thus became the first prime minister since before [[World War II]] who was not a Communist or a [[fellow traveler]].  The only non-Communist to hold the premiership before the start of Communist rule, [[Czech Social Democratic Party|Social Democrat]] [[Zdeněk Fierlinger]], was openly pro-Communist (and later led his party into a merger with the Communists).  He helped lead the Havel movement to a sweeping victory in the [[Czechoslovak parliamentary election, 1990|1990 elections]]--the first free elections held in the country in 44 years.  When VPN dissolved in April 1991, Čalfa followed most of the party into the Civic Democratic Union (ODU-VPN), of which he became a leading member.

Both cabinets headed by Čalfa succeeded in introducing significant political and economic reforms, facilitating the transition from Communism Party rule to a multi-party system and a market-oriented economy. Čalfa enjoyed strong support from all relevant political powers, including both President Václav Havel and an increasingly confident Finance Minister [[Václav Klaus]].

Čalfa resigned from the Federal Government after the defeat of the Public Against Violence in the elections of 1992.&lt;ref name=respekt95&gt;{{cite web|first=Vladimír|last=Mlynář|url=https://www.respekt.cz/tydenik/1995/35/zeman-do-vlady-nepatri|title=Zeman do vlády nepatří|language=cs|work=[[Respekt]]|date=28 August 1995|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]] [[Jan Stráský]], whose major task was the execution of [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia]]. In that year, Čalfa took up Czech citizenship and started working as a [[lawyer]] in [[Prague]], heading [[law firm]] Čalfa, Bartošík a Partneři.&lt;ref name=respekt95/&gt;

During his tenure as Prime Minister, Čalfa was occasionally a target of criticism for his Communist past. Some considered this as a proof that the Velvet Revolution was unfinished or even "stolen" by people belonging to the past [[nomenklatura]]. Presently, historians consider him as a "[[power behind the throne]]," who greatly contributed to the smoothness and speed of Velvet Revolution and the election of Václav Havel as President. He used his negotiation skills in critical moments against his fellow Communist Party members and talked them into compromises that were sometimes more radical the representatives of the Civic Forum had expected.

Many politicians of the subsequent democratic era, including Václav Klaus, said that they learned many things about real politics from Čalfa.

'''Mary Chudleigh''', Lady Chudleigh (August 1656 &amp;ndash; 1710) was an English poet who belonged to an intellectual circle that included [[Mary Astell]], [[Elizabeth Thomas (poet)|Elizabeth Thomas]], [[Judith Drake]], [[Elizabeth Elstob]], [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]], and [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/astell/ |title=Mary Astell (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |website=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her later years she published a volume of poetry and two volumes of essays, all dealing with feminist themes. Two of her books were published in four editions during the last ten years of her life. Her poetry on the subject of human relationships and reactions has appeared in several anthologies. Her feminist essays are still in print.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert,

==Literary works and critical reception==
{{Library resources box|by=yes|onlinebooksby=yes|lcheading= Chudleigh, Mary Lee, Lady, 1656-1710}}Critics have tended to read Chudleigh's work biographically; however that began to change by the 1990s as new evidence about her life was uncovered. In her early career she could be described as a Restoration poet of lyrics and satires while in her later career she became a philosophical essayist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Poems and Prose of Lady, Mary Chudleigh|last = |first = |publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1990|isbn = 0-19-508360-1|location = New York|pages = xxii-xxiii|editor-last = Ezell|editor-first = Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavily influenced by Mary Astell, Lady Mary Chudleigh was one of the first English women to recognize that as a social group, women faced unique challenges. She wrote overtly feminist works and argued strongly for marriage reform and women's education, believing that women should cultivate reason, virtue and stoic integrity despite living in a world full of misogyny. She also wrote significant poems in the retirement tradition combining Platonic and Christian contemplation as a retreat from the vanities of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Raising Their Voices British Women Writers. 1650-1750|last = Williamson|first = Marilyn|publisher = Wayne State University Press|year = 1990|isbn = 0-8143-2209-3|location = Detroit|pages = 90–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chudleigh is no longer thought to have written the prose work ''The Female Advocate'' (1700), but expressed in her poetry praise for the "ingenious Pen" of the unknown, pseudonymous [[Eugenia (Lady of Quality)|Eugenia]] who wrote it.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret J.

'''Maymie de Mena''' (December 10, 1879 – October 23, 1953, also known as '''Maymie Aiken''' or '''Madame DeMena Aiken''' in her later career) was an American-born activist who became one of the highest-ranking officers in the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|Universal Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA). She has been credited with keeping the organization alive after [[Marcus Garvey]]'s conviction for mail fraud and deportation from the United States.

De Mena was born into a Creole family in [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana]], and obtained her education in the United States before marrying a Nicaraguan and moving to Central America. After a decade in which she raised a daughter and taught school, she divorced, returned to the U.S., and joined the UNIA. Quickly rising in the ranks from a translator, because she was fluent in Spanish, de Mena became one of the leaders of the pan-African movement. She was responsible for increasing the membership of the organization in the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]]. When Garvey left the U.S. and relocated to [[Jamaica]], de Mena became Garvey's official representative in New York and was the first woman to carry such a high distinction in the organization.

After Garvey moved to London, de Mena, now remarried and styling herself as ''Madame Aiken'', directed her attentions to women's and children's issues in Jamaica. She fought for women's suffrage and birth control rights, while establishing trade organizations to assist working-class women in improving their economic status.

==Early life==
Leonie Turpeau was born on December 10, 1879, on a farm on the eastern banks of [[Bayou Teche]] near [[St. Martinville]], St. Martin Parish, [[Louisiana]], to Isabella Hill (née Regis or Reggis) and Michel Turpeau Jr.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=174}}{{sfn|Ohio Deaths|1947|p=141}}{{#tag:ref|In the papers of the Universal Negro Improvement Association de Mena's biographical notes are distorted. Her birth is shown as 1891; her birth place is shown as [[San Carlos, Nicaragua]]; her first husband, Francisco Hiberto Mena, is shown as her father; her mother's name is altered slightly—from Regis to Regist; and her father, Michel Turpeau, is shown as her first husband, among other misidentifications.{{sfn|Garvey|1989|pp=117–118}} This information has been repeated in other sources,{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow (OUP)|2016}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1953|p=2}} without confirmation from primary records. De Mena sometimes gave correct information in primary records, such as her passenger information in 1912 which gave her birth place as St. Martinville and her nationality as "Nicarguan by marriage"{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=176}} and sometimes gave incorrect information, such as documents which show her birth year as 1879, 1889 or 1891. After 1919, de Mena usually listed her birth year as 1891 or 1892.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=182}}|group="Notes"}} Her paternal grandfather, Michel Turpeau Sr. was a free man of color from [[Martinique]] who had worked as a ship hand and later on the Banker plantation, enabling him to buy a small parcel of land and bring his [[French Guiana|French Guianese]] wife, Odeline "Dina", to Louisiana.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=174}}{{sfn|U. S. Census|1870|p=23}} Turpaeu's mother was the daughter of Maturin Regis, who had been a slave in [[Virginia]], and Carrie Hill a [[Louisiana Creole people|Louisiana Creole]] woman. The marriage between Michael Jr. and Isabella caused disquiet from its beginnings, as Louisiana society typically did not approve of freedmen marrying former slaves.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=174}}

Turpeau was the seventh sibling in the family. Her biography in the Garvey collection shows that she was privately educated and also studied at the Metropolitan Business College of New York City, the Greensboro Commercial College at [[Greensboro, North Carolina]] and at the [[University of New Orleans]].{{sfn|Garvey|1989|p=117}} The University of New Orleans was not founded until 1956,{{snf|Lipinski|2014}} but Carrie, Turpeau's older sister studied at the Gilbert Academy, an agricultural/industrial college founded for freedmen which later became part of the distinct [[New Orleans University]].{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=177}} Records of the university show three alumni between 1895 and 1917 with the surname Turpeau: Carrie B. who graduated in 1899, Angella (a younger sister) who graduated in 1906 both from the College of Liberal Arts, and Mary L. (née Turpeau) Thompson, later Hammett who graduated in 1899 from the [[normal school]].{{sfn|New Orleans University Yearbook|1896|pp=12, 60}}{{sfn|New Orleans University Yearbook|1917|pp=42, 47}} Both Carrie and Mary L. Turpeau were from St. Martinville.{{sfn|''Journal of the Louisiana Annual Conference''|1900|p=403}}{{#tag:ref|It is unknown if Mary L. Turpeau is Maymie Leonie. The Mary who attended New Orleans University married Kershaw T. Thompson on December 10, 1900, in New Orleans and gave her father's name as Turpeau and mother's name as Belle Turpeau. The bride was 21 years old. One of the witnesses to the marriage was Belle Anderson.{{sfn|Louisiana Marriage Ledgers|1900|p=643}} A newspaper notice of the marriage shows that the bride's name was May Turpeau.{{sfn|''The Times-Picayune''|1900|p=14}} Maymie's sister Angella's death record shows that Angella's mother was Isabel Regis Anderson.{{sfn|Cook County Deaths|1955}} Yearbook references for New Orleans University show Mary L.

[[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and rioting, coupled with the implementation of [[Jim Crow laws]] in Louisiana led most of the Turpeau family to leave the area and become professionals in the north.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=176}} David DeWitt became a well-known preacher and a member of the [[Ohio House of Representatives]]{{sfn|''The Marysville Tribune''|1947|p=4}} and his daughter, [[Leontine T. Kelly]] born in [[Washington, D.C.]] was the first black woman bishop of the [[United Methodist Church]].{{sfn|Noland|2012}} George remained in Louisiana, living in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]],{{sfn|U. S. Census: Louisiana|1940|p=61A}} which was very near [[Jennings, Louisiana|Jennings]], the destination of several of Turpeau's future trips from [[Nicaragua]].{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=176}}{{sfn|New Orleans Passenger Lists|1917|p=723}}

Turpeau, rather than moving north, chose to go south to [[Bluefields, Nicaragua]], with her new husband Francisco Hiberto Mena (aka Francis or Frank in English sources), a [[Creole peoples|Creole]] planter, activist, and newspaperman. When or where they met or married is unknown. On May 12, 1912, Maymie Leona Turpeau de Mena, as she now styled herself, sailed on the ''S.S. Dictator'' from Bluefields, to New Orleans. Her passenger record showed she was heading to visit her sister in Jennings, Louisiana, was born in St. Martinville, and stated her nationality was "Nicaraguan by marriage".{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=176}}{{sfn|New Orleans Passenger Lists|1912|p=357}} By the time de Mena arrived in Bluefields, the [[Mosquito Coast]] had transitioned from a [[British protectorate]] to a [[Nicaraguan]] capital city of the [[Zelaya Department]] with strong commercial ties to the United States. The society was quite stratified with white North Americans at the highest social positions followed by [[Mestizo]]s and upper class Creoles, European mixed-race elites. Those with darker skins from Asia, the Caribbean, and indigenous people held lower status.{{sfn|Morris|2016|pp=177–178}} Though de Mena styled herself as Spanish American,{{sfn|New Orleans Passenger Lists|1912|p=357}} she would have been considered as part of the [[Afro-Caribbean]] diaspora.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=179}}

==Fluid identity==
At the time de Mena married Francisco Mena, U.S. law held that she lost her American citizenship and acquired her husband's. Until the [[Cable Act]] was passed in 1922, she would not have been able to reacquire American citizenship.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=1}} Thus, her statements that she was "Nicaraguan by marriage"{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=176}} were accurate, unless she had petitioned the Naturalization Bureau to regain her citizenship.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=2}} Since she used her Nicaraguan passport in 1926 to attain a Pullman berth, she had not re-nationalized at that time.{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow|2016|p=152}} In 1936, another U.S. law was passed which allowed women who had lost their citizenship by marrying a foreigner between 1907 and 1922 to forgo a petition of naturalization, only if their spouse had died or the couple had divorced and if the woman was willing to swear an oath of allegiance.{{sfn|Smith|1998|p=2}} But by this time, de Mena had already married a Cameroonian and a Jamaican.{{sfn|Morris|2016|pp=184, 187}} Though French law, under whose jurisdiction part of Cameroon fell, was amended in 1927 to allow women to maintain their citizenship upon marriage,{{sfn|Sonbol|2005|p=214}}{{sfn|Camiscioli|1999|p=53}} the laws of Nicaragua and Britain, under whose jurisdiction both the remainder of Cameroon and Jamaica fell, still held in 1933 that a woman lost her citizenship upon remarriage and became an alien with the citizenship of her spouse.{{sfn|League of Nations|1934|pp=2, 5}}

Though not native to Nicaragua, having lived in the stratified social order of a [[Hispanic]] country,{{sfn|Morris|2016|pp=177–178}} de Mena was able to empathize with Afro-Latina discontent in her travels through [[Latin America]] for UNIA and she spoke their language.{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow|2016|p=148}} De Mena's identity shifted as needed. When she was denied a berth on a [[Pullman car]], de Mena used her Nicaraguan passport to gain one.{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow|2016|p=152}} On ship passenger manifests, she claimed to be African, colored, Negro, Spanish American, West Indian, and white on various voyages{{sfn|Garvey|1989|p=118}} and was known to travel on both a Nicaraguan and British passport.{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=121}} On the other hand some men in the UNIA challenged her leadership as a foreigner. She was also investigated by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] for her activities and relationships with foreigners.{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow|2016|p=152}} De Mena, dedicated to the cause of improving her race, used her shifting identity for political expediency. Natanya Duncan, even observed that she chose her husbands based on whether they could advance the cause of racial improvement and disposed of them when they became either a liability or did not support her aims.{{sfn|Duncan|2009|pp=121–122}}

==Career==
===Nicaragua===
While de Mena may have been involved with the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League|Universal Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA) in Bluefields, as she later claimed, there is no documentation confirming her participation in the organization in Nicaragua.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=179}} UNIA, founded by [[Marcus Garvey]] in 1914, was a [[Pan-African]] movement with the dual goals of bringing self-authority to black people worldwide and taking possession of Africa as a [[Negro]] right.{{sfn|Matera|2005}}   De Mena's husband was a member of the Union Club, serving as its vice president for several terms in the 1920s, which would have granted her access to the Creole elite circles. He also was involved with the ''Bluefields Weekly'', a local English-language newspaper. Both served as mechanisms for political mobilization of the Creole populations and though women were not allowed to be members of the club, they were active in organizing political influence.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=179}} In 1913, de Mena listed her occupation on a trip home as nurse but in the four following years, she styled herself as a housewife.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=180}} She also made a trip that year to Panama, to give birth to her daughter Berniza I. Mena who was born in [[Panama City]] on February 26, 1913.{{sfn|Indiana Marriage Records|1935|p=305}}{{sfn|New Orleans Passenger Lists|1927|p=656}}{{#tag:ref|Berniza's marriage license shows her father's name to be Carlos Mena.{{sfn|Indiana Marriage Records|1935|p=305}} There was a C. Mena from Bluefields, who was employed by the Cristobal Coaling Station in 1919, but no other evidence of him is available nor is there any indication of ties to Berniza or her mother.{{sfn|Panama Canal Zone Employment Records|1919|p=669}} No records were found in a search to place Mayme de Mena or Francis H./Francisco Hiberto Mena in Panama at the time of Berniza's birth.|group="Notes"}} In 1917, de Mena showed her occupation as clerk and in 1919 ''La Información'' newspaper ran an advertisement for a school run by de Mena in which she taught English, French, bookkeeping, music, shorthand and typing.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=180}} In 1922, de Mena returned to the United States with her daughter. The passenger manifest showed she was divorced. She would settle near her family members in Chicago.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=181}}

===United States===
Around the time that de Mena returned to the U.S., a convention was taking place at Liberty Hall, the headquarters of UNIA in [[Harlem]].{{sfn|James|1998|pp=138–140}} The organization's structure was [[patriarchal]], with clear delineation of gendered roles. Women were meant to be virtuous married mothers, in need of protection and men their gallant protectors and warriors.{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow|2016|pp=143–144}} Though not on the 1922 agenda, the women's delegation raised a set of resolutions hoping to gain more autonomy, leadership positions and authority without male oversight. Marcus Garvey amended the resolutions so that they had little real effect, but the event marked a turning point and a rise in women in leadership in the organization.{{sfn|James|1998|pp=138–140}} By 1929 though the organization was in decline, 39.5% of the delegates were women, rising to 49.1% in 1938.{{sfn|James|1998|p=154}} In various ways, women begin to split with the UNIA philosophies on issues that they felt strongly about, such as a woman's right to control her own child-bearing and use of birth control, as well as women's opposition to their lack of political power.{{sfn|Bourbonnais|2016|p=72}} De Mena's leadership of the UNIA, as a single mother,{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow|2016|p=145}} "proved that [women] were intellectually equipped to be local leaders as well as transnational policy makers within the organization".{{sfn|Leeds|2013|p=5}} Soon after the convention, Garvey was arrested on charges of [[mail fraud]] involving the [[Black Star Line]]'s scheme to bring American Negros "home" to [[Liberia]]. He was imprisoned and given a five-year sentence,{{sfn|Mays|2011|p=306}} but appealed his conviction and was released on bond.{{sfn|''The Buffalo American''|1923|p=1}}

De Mena joined the UNIA in Chicago and in 1924 was sent as a delegate to the annual convention in Harlem.{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow|2016|p=146}} At the convention, she asked the leadership to recognize the Daughters of Ethiopia, an honorary group making contributions to racial improvement, as an official auxiliary of the UNIA. By gaining the organization's approval, women members of the UNIA gained recognition of their contributions.{{sfn|Duncan|2009|pp=27–28}} In 1925, [[Henrietta Vinton Davis]] organized a tour of the Caribbean and was accompanied by de Mena, who was to serve as both translator and organizer on the trip.{{sfn|Bair|1992|p=162}} De Mena proved successful in both fund raising and recruiting new members, and her language skills with Spanish were rewarded with a higher salary than Davis'. By the time the women returned, now enjoying a reputation as a motivational speaker, de Mena was asked to join Garvey on stage on July 5, 1925, to call for unity.{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow|2016|p=146}} Garvey lost his appeal on his fraud case that same year and was remanded to the Atlanta Penitentiary.{{sfn|''The Brooklyn Daily Eagle''|1925|p=2}} Throughout the summer and fall of that year, de Mena accompanied [[Amy Jacques Garvey|Amy Jacques-Garvey]] on a speaking tour covering many major cities in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], along the [[East Coast of the United States|Atlantic coast]] and to [[New Orleans]]. The tour solidified her place in Garvey's inner circle.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=183}}  At the emergency convention of 1926, de Mena was elected as assistant international organizer{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=181}} and the following year succeeded Davis as the fourth vice president general, becoming Garvey's official representative.{{sfn|Bair|1992|p=162}} She kept in close contact with him both through correspondence and visits despite her travel schedule.{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=121}} Upon Garvey's release from prison in 1927 and his deportation to [[Jamaica]], de Mena led a celebratory UNIA parade through [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. Perched on a horse and brandishing a sword, she was a visible symbol of the crusading woman.{{sfn|Bair|1992|p=162}}

In 1928, de Mena married a [[Cameroon]]ian medical student, Milton Tube Ebimber, who had studied in Germany, Japan and China and spoke several African, Asian, and European languages. He was studying medicine at [[Columbia University]] when they married.{{sfn|Garvey|1989|p=118}} Their opulent wedding, in which the bride was given away by her brother, David DeWitt Turpeau, was held at UNIA's Liberty Hall headquarters attracting wide coverage in the black newspapers.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=184}} Soon after the marriage, Ebimber was arrested and imprisoned in the New York State Penitentiary{{sfn|Garvey|1989|p=118}} on charges of bigamy.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=185}} In 1929, she once again used de Mena as her surname.{{sfn|Bair|1992|p=162}} Beginning in 1928 and until her shift to Father Divine's movement, de Mena was the most visible officer in the UNIA.{{sfn|Ewing|2014|p=157}} She was the key to increasing membership in the organization in the Spanish-speaking Caribbean and southern American regions.{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow (OUP)|2016}} When Garvey reorganized the movement in 1929, she became the international organizer and the officer in charge of the Americas.{{sfn|Bair|1992|p=162}} She was seated on the dais at the convention that year and on its conclusion returned to the United States as its official representative. The following year, Garvey appointed de Mena officer-in-charge of North America and his personal representative in the U.S., as he had formally split with UNIA, Inc. in New York and created the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League of the World operating out of Jamaica.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=185}} De Mena's "forceful, riveting and entrancing style" played a key role in keeping the movement alive after Garvey's deportation from the U.S.{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow (OUP)|2016}} When Davis left the movement in 1931, de Mena became the sole leader,{{sfn|Duncan|2009|p=101}} though many challenged her authority.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=186}} Around the same time, de Mena reorganized the [[Costa Rica]]n [[Port Limón]] branch of the UNIA,{{sfn|Leeds|2013|p=5}} after factionalism had created a local branch which vied for authority with the parent organization.{{sfn|Leeds|2010|pp=96–99}}

As director of the UNIA's newspaper ''[[Negro World]]'' from 1932,{{sfn|Bair|1992|p=162}}{{sfn|Ewing|2014|p=157}} de Mena worked with Jacques-Garvey to create a ladies' page, breaking new ground at the time. Jacques-Garvey had introduced "Our Women and What They Think", with articles focused on women's activism, rather than on fashion or household tips.{{sfn|Leeds|2013|p=7}} They used the voice of the ''Negro World'' to give members of the African diaspora a different narrative than the racially inferior images commonly presented in the press. In the racially charged environment of the 1930s, black women were often depicted as sexually immoral. Through the ladies' page articles, women were encouraged to uplift the race through motherhood; the articles helped to change the perception of Afro-Caribbean women by asserting the women's respectability. In Costa Rica, where they had been denied citizenship, West Indian women argued that they were fit to become citizens.{{sfn|Leeds|2013|pp=18–19}} Chapters of UNIA sprang up in countries from [[Brazil]] through [[Mexico]] and across the [[West Indies]]. Though Caribbean migrants to the areas accounted for some of the membership, not all of those interested in Garveyism were immigrants from the West Indies. The ''Negro World'' had a Spanish section which ran news about issues affecting [[Afro-Latin Americans|Afro-Latinos]].{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow|2016|p=148}} Under de Mena's leadership it was decidedly feminist. She exhorted members to fight for women's rights and throw off the restrictions of assigned roles.{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow|2016|p=145}}{{sfn|Ewing|2014|p=156}}

===Jamaica===
On 11 June 1932, de Mena married Percy Aiken,{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1935|p=39}} a Jamaican contractor and activist, who would become an officer in the island's [[Bahá'í Faith]].{{sfn|Garvey|1989|p=118}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1952|p=9}} Garvey tried to bring the UNIA back to its former status from Jamaica, continuing to write articles for the ''Negro World'' and developing two other short-lived papers, ''The Blackman'' and ''The New Jamaican'', but all had folded by 1933.{{sfn|Martin|1983|p=137}} In 1934, now adopting her new husband's surname and styled as "Madame Aiken"{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1935|p=39}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1946|p=7}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|March 24, 1939|p=18}} she began a newspaper using the presses of the ''Negro World'' called the ''World Echo''. While the paper ostensibly was to be another organ for UNIA, many of the articles were devoted to [[Father Divine's Peace Mission]]. Aiken used the paper to call for [[Anti-lynching movement|anti-lynching]] legislation and championed African-American civil rights, including liberation in "spiritual, economic, political and industrial emancipation".{{sfn|Watts|1992|p=114}} Father Divine's movement was in direct opposition to Garvey's, in that Garvey pressed for racial consciousness and purity, while Divine argued that race was unimportant and that blacks had to integrate into the larger society. The opposing voices of these two movements were difficult for Aiken and other members of the diaspora to reconcile.{{sfn|Watts|1992|pp=114–115}} She finally closed both the newspaper and UNIA's offices in New York, moving to Jamaica in 1935.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=187}} Though she continued some involvement with UNIA through the 1950s,{{sfn|Bair|1992|p=162}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1946|p=7}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1953|p=2}} the organization was in decline. Garvey's financial problems resulted in the foreclosure of his home, and by 1935, he permanently relocated to London.{{sfn|Martin|1983|p=137}} Around the same time, Aiken withdrew her support from Father Divine and restyled the ''World Echo'' into the ''Ethiopian World''.{{sfn|Watts|1992|p=125}} Though many deserted Garvey, Aiken maintained a good relationship with him until his death.{{sfn|Castillo-Garsow (OUP)|2016}}

Aiken was increasingly involved in social work,{{sfn|Bair|1992|p=162}} joining the Women's Liberal Club and the Trade Unions Council.{{sfn|Bourbonnais|2013|pp=80–81}}  She supported a variety of causes including the improvement of conditions for children and orphans,{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|February 13, 1940|p=9}} hygiene and licensing regulations for beauticians,{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|April 10, 1940|p=34}} care facilities for the elderly, better schools, and controlling government waste.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|October 21, 1947|p=9}} Aiken served as Secretary of the Save the Children organization and was a member of its executive board up to her death.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1953|p=2}} She was also involved in the [[birth control]] movement alongside other reformers like [[Amy Bailey]] and [[May Farquharson]].{{sfn|Bourbonnais|2016|pp=63–64}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|April 10, 1940|p=34}} She believed that until women could plan the size of their own families, they would not be able to improve the economic, educational, or moral status of the black community as they would be unable to devote quality support to large numbers of children.{{sfn|Bourbonnais|2016|p=64}} She joined the [[Bustamante Industrial Trade Union]] (BITU) and though the organization largely excluded women, she pressed for social and economic improvements for women. Aiken also helped establish a trade union for seamstresses, co-founded the Housecraft Training Center and was the only woman to serve on the Trade Unions Council.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=189}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1953|p=2}}

In 1939, when [[Mary Morris Knibb]] launched her bid for a seat on the Kingston/Saint Andrew Parish Council, Aiken was a staunch supporter and campaigner.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|March 3, 1939|p=18}} Upon Knibb's victory, Aiken rallied  UNIA and other organizations for a victory celebration for the first woman elected to any political office in Jamaica.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|March 24, 1939|p=18}} That same year, she made a trip back to the U.S., in part to console one of her sisters who was ailing,{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|April 25, 1939|p=18}} but also to visit the [[Clinical Research Bureau|Birth Control Research Bureau]], attend lectures at [[Howard University]] and participate in roundtable discussions with the [[National Woman's Party]].{{sfn|Bourbonnais|2016|p=101}} When Garvey died in 1940 and the following year the Commissioner of the UNIA in Jamaica resigned, Aiken was put forward as a replacement.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|May 20, 1940|p=19}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1942|p=5}} She continued to press for women's political participation, entering the local elections herself in 1947. Though she did not win, she encouraged others to vote for women candidates.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|October 21, 1947|p=9}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|October 22, 1947|pp=1, 12}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|October 24, 1947|p=18}}

In 1949, Aiken became president of the Garvey Division of the UNIA and served in that capacity until her resignation in July of the following year.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|March 15, 1950|p=2}}{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|July 14, 1950|p=21}} She was finally appointed by UNIA Inc. in New York as the Commissioner for Cuba, Central America and Jamaica in 1952. She was the current president of the Women's Liberal Club when she boarded a ship in September 1953 to see a doctor in the U.S.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1953|p=2}}

==Death and legacy==
Aiken died on October 23, 1953, from cancer and was buried in the [[Graceland Cemetery]] in Chicago.{{sfn|Morris|2016|p=172}}{{sfn|Cook County Deaths|1953}} The year after Aiken's death, a portrait of her was unveiled by Lady Foot, wife of [[Hugh Foot, Baron Caradon|Governor Foot]] and donated to the Housecraft Training Center, a facility co-founded by Aiken to teach domestic science.{{sfn|''The Daily Gleaner''|1954|p=16}}

In September 2011, Flynn was promoted to Lieutenant General and assigned as [[Director of National Intelligence|assistant director of national intelligence]] in the [[Office of the Director of National Intelligence]]. On April 17, 2012, President [[Barack Obama]] nominated Flynn to be the 18th [[director of the Defense Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flynn to head DIA; more general moves announced |url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2012/04/army-flynn-dia-general-moves-announced-041712w/|work=Army Times|accessdate=April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/2012/04/michael-flynn-dia/ |date=April 17, 2012 |publisher=Wired |title=Military Intelligence Gadfly Will Lead All Military Intelligence |first=Spencer |last=Ackerman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn took command of the DIA in July 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Panetta: Under Burgess, DIA Evolved Into Global Agency|url=http://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=117250|accessdate=April 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He simultaneously became commander of the [[Joint Functional Component Command for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance]], and chair of the [[Military Intelligence Board]].

In October 2012, Flynn announced plans to release his paper "VISION2020: Accelerating Change Through Integration", a look at changes he believes are necessary for the DIA in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIA maps out new structure to address 'persistent conflict|url=http://defensesystems.com/articles/2012/10/10/geoint-flynn-dia.aspx|publisher=Defense Systems|accessdate=October 17, 2012|first=Charles |last=Hoskinson|date=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Government Executive"&gt;[[Government Executive]], [http://www.govexec.com/defense/2012/11/intelligence-community-must-adapt-era-vast-data-study-says/59886/ Intelligence community must adapt to era of vast data, study says] (November 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2013, Michael Flynn became the first U.S. officer to be allowed inside the [[GRU|Russian military intelligence (GRU)]] headquarters in [[Moscow]], where he arrived at the invitation of the GRU chief Gen [[Igor Sergun]].&lt;ref name="zwack"&gt;Peter Zwack.

====Retirement from the military====
On April 30, 2014, Flynn announced his retirement effective later that year, about a year earlier than he had been scheduled to leave his position.

According to what Flynn had stated in one final interview as DIA director, he felt like a lone voice in thinking that the United States was less safe from the threat of [[Islamic terrorism]] in 2014 than it was prior to the [[9/11 attacks]]; he went on to believe that he was pressed into retirement for questioning the Obama administration's public narrative that [[Al Qaeda]] was close to defeat.&lt;ref name="Kitfield"&gt;James Kitfield, [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/how-mike-flynn-became-americas-angriest-general-214362 How Mike Flynn Became America's Angriest General], ''Politico Magazine'' (October 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Seymour Hersh]] wrote that "Flynn confirmed [to Hersh] that his agency had sent a constant stream of classified warnings&amp;nbsp;... about the dire consequences of toppling [Syrian President] [[Bashar al-Assad|Assad]]." Flynn recounted that his agency was producing intelligence reports indicating that radical Islamists were the main force in the Syrian insurgency and "that Turkey was looking the other way when it came to the growth of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] inside Syria". According to Flynn, these reports "got enormous pushback from the Obama administration," who he felt "did not want to hear the truth". According to former DIA official [[W.

Flynn retired from the U.S. Army with 33 years of service on August 7, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ccjsymposium.com/speaker/lt-gen-mike-flynn/|title=Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn |publisher=CCJ Symposium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, Flynn spoke at a meeting of [[ACT! for America]] at a point when the [[2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt]] against [[Turkey|Turkish]] President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] was still underway. He spoke favorably of the coup participants, saying that Erdoğan had been moving Turkey away from secularism and towards Islamism and that participants in the coup wanted Turkey to be and to be seen as a secular nation—a goal "worth clapping for."&lt;ref name="ACTspeech"&gt;{{cite AV media|title=Act!

On November 8 (election day in the United States), an op-ed written by Flynn was published by ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', calling for U.S. backing for Erdoğan's government and criticizing the regime's opponent, [[Fethullah Gülen]], alleging that Gülen headed a "vast global network" that fitted "the description of a dangerous sleeper terror network".&lt;ref name=FlynnHillEd&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/foreign-policy/305021-our-ally-turkey-is-in-crisis-and-needs-our-support|title=Our ally Turkey is in crisis and needs our support|last=Anonymous|date=November 8, 2016|work=The Hill|access-date=March 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schlberg1&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-flynn-turkey-coup_us_58324909e4b099512f8376d4|title=Trump's National Security Adviser Changed His Mind About Turkey Coup Attempt After His Firm Got Involved|author=Jessica Schulberg Foreign Affairs|date=November 21, 2016|publisher=The Huffington Post|access-date=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'' 'You don't haul somebody overseas': Ex CIA director says Michael Flynn may have gone too far in a meeting with Turkish officials'' http://uk.businessinsider.com/mike-flynn-turkey-lobbyist-james-woolsey-gulen-2017-3?r=US&amp;IR=T&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Flynn did not disclose that his consulting firm had received funds from a company with ties to the Turkish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/michael-rubin-trump-teams-first-ethics-scandal-521622?rm=eu|title=Michael Rubin: The Trump team's first ethics scandal|newspaper=Newsweek|access-date=November 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Flynn's ties had been disclosed by ''[[The Daily Caller]]'', [[Politico]], and others, the editor of ''The Hill'' added a note to Flynn's op-ed, stating that Flynn had failed to disclose that he had been engaged at the time in "consulting work that might have aided the government of Turkey," that his firm had received payments from a company with close ties to the Turkish government, or that the company had reviewed the draft of the op-ed before it was submitted to ''The Hill''.&lt;ref name=FlynnHillEd/&gt;

On March 8, 2017, Flynn registered with the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] as a [[Foreign Agents Registration Act|foreign agent]] for $530,000 worth of lobbying work before election day.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/former-trump-security-adviser-flynn-admits-turkey-lobbying |title=Former Trump aide Flynn says lobbying may have helped Turkey |work=The Big Story |access-date=March 9, 2017 |language=en-US |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308234613/http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/former-trump-security-adviser-flynn-admits-turkey-lobbying |archivedate=March 8, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was done on behalf of a Dutch-based company that may have been working for the Turkish government.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

On March 24, 2017, former [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Director of the CIA]] [[R. James Woolsey Jr.|James Woolsey]] said that in September 2016 Flynn, while working for the Trump presidential campaign, had attended a meeting in a New York hotel with Turkish officials including foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and energy minister Berat Albayrak, son-in-law of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and had discussed abducting [[Fethullah Gülen]] and sending him to Turkey, bypassing the U.S. extradition legal process.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-cia-director-mike-flynn-and-turkish-officials-discussed-removal-of-erdogan-foe-from-u-s-1490380426|title=Ex-CIA Director: Mike Flynn and Turkish Officials Discussed Removal of Erdogan Foe From U.S.|last=Grimaldi|first=James V.|date=March 24, 2017|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=March 25, 2017|last2=Nissenbaum|first2=Dion|issn=0099-9660|last3=Coker|first3=Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attendance at RT gala dinner===
On December 10, 2015, Flynn attended a gala dinner in [[Moscow]] in honor of [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (formerly "Russia Today"), a Russian government-owned English-language media outlet, on which he made semi-regular appearances as an analyst after he retired from U.S. government service.&lt;ref name="Emmarie"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/27/us/politics/michael-flynn-trump-investigation-defense-department.html|title=Pentagon Inquiry Seeks to Learn if Flynn Hid Foreign Payment|last1=Huetteman|first1=Emmarie|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Matthew|date=April 27, 2017|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn sat next to Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] at the dinner, leading journalist [[Michael Crowley (journalist)|Michael Crowley]] of ''[[Politico]]'' to report that "at a moment of semi-hostility between the U.S. and Russia, the presence of such an important figure at Putin's table startled" U.S. officials.&lt;ref name="Crowley"&gt;Michael Crowley, [http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/04/donald-trump-2016-russia-today-rt-kremlin-media-vladimir-putin-213833 The Kremlin's Candidate: In the 2016 election, Putin's propaganda network is picking sides], ''Politico Magazine'' (May/June 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Isikoff"&gt;Michael Isikoff, [https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-supporter-defends-payment-russian-175611942.html Top Trump adviser defends payment for Russian speaking engagement], Yahoo News (July 18, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT23may17/&gt; As part of the festivities, Flynn gave a talk on world affairs for which he was paid at least $45,000.&lt;ref name = "Emmarie"/&gt; Flynn defended the RT payment in an interview with [[Michael Isikoff]].&lt;ref name="Isikoff"/&gt;

On February 1, 2017, the [[Ranking member|ranking Democratic members]] on six House committees sent a letter to Secretary of Defense [[James Mattis]], requesting a [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] investigation into Flynn's connection to RT.&lt;ref name="DemsLetter"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The legislators expressed concern that Flynn had violated the [[Foreign Emoluments Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] by accepting money from RT.&lt;ref name="DemsLetter"/&gt;

A 2017 report by the [[United States Intelligence Community]] characterized RT as "The Kremlin's principal international propaganda outlet" and said that [[RT America]] is set up as an autonomous nonprofit organization "to avoid the [[Foreign Agents Registration Act]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/ICA_2017_01.pdf|title=Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections|publisher=United States Intelligence Community|date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Ewing, [https://www.npr.org/2017/02/10/514551968/5-things-on-michael-flynn-russia-and-donald-trump 5 Things On Michael Flynn, Russia and Donald Trump], NPR (February 10, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a retired military intelligence officer, Flynn was required to obtain prior permission from the Defense Department and the State Department before receiving any money from foreign governments. Flynn apparently did not seek that approval before the RT speech, and he did not report the payment when he applied for renewal of his security clearance two months later.&lt;ref name = "Emmarie" /&gt; 
[[Glenn A. Fine]], the acting [[Office of the Inspector General, U.S. Department of Defense|Defense Department Inspector General]], has confirmed he is investigating Flynn.&lt;ref name=NYT23may17/&gt;

The issue here was that the President got to the point where General Flynn's relationship – misleading the Vice President and others, or the possibility that he had forgotten critical details of this important conversation had created a critical mass and an unsustainable situation.

''Bloomberg'' reporter [[Eli Lake]] wrote in an [[opinion piece]] on December 1, 2017, that two former Trump transition team officials provided information indicating that [[Jared Kushner]] was the senior member of the team described in Flynn's plea documents as having directed Flynn to contact officials from foreign governments, including Russia, asking them to delay or vote against a [[United Nations]] resolution on the issue of [[Israeli settlements]], contrary to the still-incumbent Obama administration's position of support for the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-12-01/kushner-is-said-to-have-ordered-flynn-to-contact-russia|title=Kushner Is Said to Have Ordered Flynn to Contact Russia|date=December 1, 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Melissa Quinn | Washington Examiner, Jared Kushner directed Michael Flynn to contact Russian government in Dec. 2016: Report, http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/jared-kushner-directed-michael-flynn-to-contact-russian-government-in-dec-2016-report/article/2642306 , January 12, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  This was also confirmed by other news outlets, who cited multiple sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Santucci |first1=John |last2=Palmeri |first2=Tara |last3=Kelsey |first3=Adam |date=December 1, 2017 |title=Jared Kushner is 'very senior' official who directed Flynn to contact Russia in court documents: Sources |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/senior-trump-transition-official-directed-flynn-contact-russia/story?id=51515179 |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 1, 2017 |title=Kushner, McFarland talked to Flynn about Russia |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kushner-mcfarland-talked-to-flynn-about-russia/ |publisher=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
Flynn is a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], having grown up in a "very strong Democratic family".&lt;ref name=CNNjuly10&gt;{{cite news|last1=Diaz|first1=Daniella|title=Flynn voices abortion views at odds with Republican platform|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/10/politics/lt-gen-michael-flynn-donald-trump-vice-president-abc-this-week-dallas-shooting/|accessdate=July 10, 2016|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he was a keynote speaker during the first night of the [[2016 Republican National Convention]],&lt;ref name="LATimes convention speech"/&gt; and he was a surrogate and top national security adviser for President [[Donald Trump]].

During a July 10, 2016, interview on ABC News' ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'', when asked by host [[Martha Raddatz]] about the [[Abortion in the United States|issue of abortion]], Flynn stated, "women have to be able to choose."&lt;ref name=CNNjuly10/&gt;&lt;ref name=ABCjuly10&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelsey|first1=Adam|title=Possible Trump VP Pick Flynn Supports Abortion Rights: 'Women Have to Be Able to Choose'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-vp-pick-flynn-supports-abortion-rights-woman/story?id=40465180|accessdate=July 10, 2016|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=July 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Flynn said on [[Fox News]] that he is a "[[pro-life]] Democrat".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/07/11/trump-vp-short-lister-flynn-clarifies-abortion-stance-says-hes-pro-life.html|title=Trump VP short-lister Flynn clarifies abortion stance, says he's 'pro-life'|first=Jennifer|last=Griffin|date=July 11, 2016|publisher=[[Fox News]] |accessdate=July 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn is a supporter of current Israeli policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jerusalem said to welcome Trump's 'pro-Israel' security picks |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/jerusalem-said-to-welcome-trumps-pro-israel-security-picks/ |work=The Times of Israel |date=November 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Trump's Transition Team Colluded With Israel.

An officer of the [[National Border Patrol Council]] responded that the organization was not aware of any such signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/08/politics/kfile-michael-flynn-arabic-signs-on-border/index.html |title=Michael Flynn once claimed Arabic signs on southern border guide 'radicalized Muslims' into US |last=Kaczynski |first=Andrew |date=December 10, 2016 |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date= December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
Flynn co-authored a report in January 2010 through the [[Center for a New American Security]], entitled ''Fixing Intel: A Blueprint for Making Intelligence Relevant in Afghanistan''.&lt;ref name="Fixing Intel"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.cnas.org/documents/AfghanIntel_Flynn_Jan2010_code507_voices.pdf|title=Fixing Intel: A Blueprint for Making Intelligence Relevant in Afghanistan |publisher=Center for a New American Security |date=January 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2015 |author1=Michael T.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/asia/matthew-pottinger-trump-china.html?_r=0 "A Veteran and China Hand Advises Trump for Xi’s Visit"], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (April 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; argued that U.S. intelligence agencies "must open their doors to anyone who is willing to exchange information, including Afghans and NGOs (non-governmental organizations) as well as the US military and its allies".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Peter.  [http://www.news.com.au/world/breaking-news/top-trump-adviser-defends-aust-dealings/news-story/1c9b10b6d911b0ad49b1ed314ffc2848 "Top Trump adviser defends Aust dealings"], [[Australian Associated Press]] (November 21, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

Flynn is also an author of ''[[The Field of Fight|The Field of Fight: How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies]]'', co-authored with [[Michael Ledeen]], which was published by [[St. Martin's Press]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Flynn |first1=Michael T.|last2=Ledeen|first2=Michael

'''Moses Wilhelm Shapira''' ({{lang-he|מוזס וילהלם שפירא}}; 1830 – March 9, 1884) was a [[Jerusalem]] antiquities dealer and purveyor of allegedly forged [[Biblical artifact]]s.&lt;ref name="Allegro1965"&gt;{{cite book|first=John Marco |last=Allegro|title=The Shapira affair|year=1965|publisher=Doubleday}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vermès2010"&gt;{{cite book|first=Géza |last=Vermès|title=The story of the scrolls: the miraculous discovery and true significance of the Dead Sea scrolls|year=2010|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-104615-0|authorlink=Géza Vermes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shame brought about by accusations that  he was involved in the forging of ancient biblical texts drove him to suicide in 1884. The discovery of the [[Dead Sea scrolls]] in 1947, in approximately the same area he claimed his material was discovered, has cast some doubt on the original forgery charges.&lt;ref name="Allegro1965"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vermès2010"/&gt;

Moses Wilhelm Shapira was born in 1830 to [[Poland|Polish]]-[[Jew]]ish parents in [[Kamenets-Podolski]], which at the time was part of [[Russia]]n-annexed [[Poland]] (in modern-day [[Ukraine]]). Shapira's father emigrated to [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Ottoman Palestine]] and in 1856, at the age of 25, Moses Shapira followed. His grandfather, who accompanied him, died en route.

On the way, while in [[Bucharest]], Moses Shapira converted to Christianity and applied for [[Germany|German]] citizenship. Once in Jerusalem, he joined the community of [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] missionaries and converts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Singer|first=Isidore|author2=Joseph Jacobs|title=SHAPIRA, M. W.|encyclopedia=Jewish Encyclopedia|pages=232–233|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=556&amp;letter=S}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1861 opened a store&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|title=Shapira, M. W.|author=Unsigned|volume=24|page=803|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri24chisrich#page/802/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Street of the Christians, today's Christian Quarter Road. He sold the usual religious souvenirs enjoyed by pilgrims, as well as ancient pots he acquired from [[Arab]] farmers.

== Moabite forgeries ==
Shapira became interested in biblical artifacts after the appearance of the so-called Moabite Stone, also known as the [[Mesha Stele]]. He witnessed the huge interest around it and may have had a hand in negotiating on behalf of the German representatives. [[France]] eventually got the fragments of the original stone, leaving the [[England|British]] and the Germans rather frustrated.

The [[squeeze (copying method)|squeeze]] which helped reconstruct the shattered Mesha Stele was taken on behalf of the French scholar and diplomat [[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau|Charles Clermont-Ganneau]] by a [[Christian Arab]] painter and ''dragoman'' (tour-guide), Salim al-Khouri, better known as '''Salim al-Kari''', "the reader", a nickname apparently given to him by the [[Bedouin]] due to his work with ancient alphabets. Salim soon became Shapira's associate and provided connections to Arab craftsmen who, along with Salim himself, produced for Shapira's shop large amounts of fake Moabite artifacts – large stone-made human heads, but mainly clay objects: vessels, figurines and erotic pieces, generously covered with inscriptions based chiefly on the signs Salim had copied from the Mesha Stele.
To modern scholars, the products seem clumsy – inscriptions do not translate to anything legible, for one – but at the time there was little with which to compare them. Shapira even organized an expedition to Moab for potential buyers, to sites where he had Salim's [[Bedouin]] associates bury more forgeries. Some scholars began to base theories on these pieces  and the term Moabitica was coined for this entirely new category of "Moabite" artifacts.

Since German archaeologists had not gained possession of the Moabite Stone, they rushed to buy the Shapira Collection ahead of their rivals. Berlin's [[Altes Museum]] bought 1700 artifacts for the cost of 22,000 [[thaler]]s in 1873. Other private collectors followed suit. One of them was [[Horatio Kitchener]], a not yet famous British lieutenant, who bought eight pieces for the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]. Shapira was able to move to the luxurious [[Agha (Ottoman Empire)|Aga]] [[Nashashibi|Rashid]] property (modern-day [[Ticho House]]), outside Jerusalem's squalid [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]], with his wife and two daughters.

Still various people, including Charles Clermont-Ganneau, had their doubts. Clermont-Ganneau suspected Salim al-Kari, questioned him and in time found the man who supplied him with clay, a stonemason who worked for him, and other accomplices. He published his findings in the ''Athenaeum'' newspaper in [[London]] and declared all "Moabitica" to be forgeries, a conclusion with which even the German scholars eventually concurred (cf. [[Emil Friedrich Kautzsch]] and [[:de:Albert Socin|Albert Socin]], ''Die Echtheit der moabitischen Altertümer geprüft'', 1876). Shapira defended his collection vigorously until his rivals presented more evidence against them. He placed the entire blame on Salim al-Kari, convinced almost everyone that he was just an innocent victim, and continued to do a considerable trade especially in genuine old [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] manuscripts from [[Yemen]].

[[File:Punch 1883 Mr Sharp-Eye-Ra. Showing, in very fanciful portraiture, how Detective Ginsburg actually did Mr Sharp-Eye-Ra out of his skin.jpg|thumb|1883 [[Punch magazine]] cartoon of Shapira and Ginsburg]]

In 1883 Shapira presented what is now known as the ''Shapira Strips'', a supposedly ancient scroll written on leather strips which he claimed had been found near the [[Dead Sea]]. The Hebrew text hinted at a different version of [[Deuteronomy]], including a surprising [[Ten Commandments|eleventh commandment]] ("Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart: I am God, thy God"). Shapira sought to sell them to the [[British Museum]] for a million [[pound sterling|pound]]s, and allowed them to exhibit two of the 15 strips. The exhibition was attended by thousands.

However, Clermont-Ganneau also attended the exhibition; Shapira had denied him access to the other 13 strips. After close examination, Clermont-Ganneau declared them to be forgeries. Soon afterward British biblical scholar [[Christian David Ginsburg]] came to the same conclusion. Later Clermont-Ganneau showed that the leather of the Deuteronomy scroll was quite possibly cut from the margin of a genuine Yemenite scroll that Shapira had previously sold to the Museum.

Shapira fled London in despair, his name ruined and all of his hopes crushed. Six months later, on March 9, 1884, he shot himself in Hotel Bloemendaal in [[Rotterdam]].

The Shapira Strips disappeared and then reappeared a couple of years later in a [[Sotheby's]] auction, where they were sold for 10 [[guinea coin|guinea]]s. In 1899 they were probably destroyed in a fire at the house of the presumed final owner, Sir [[Charles Nicholson]].

===No new final evidence===
Despite the assessment of contemporary scholars - German ones from Halle, Leipzig and Berlin, Clermont-Ganneau from France, Christian David Ginsburg of London - declaring with good arguments either that the leather had only been recently processed, or that the Hebrew script and language used were flawed, and even leaving aside the fact that the peculiar "eleventh commandment" showed Christian leanings which could be connected to Shapira's own conversion, there have always been researchers claiming to have reasons to believe that the Deuteronomy scroll might be a genuine ancient artifact after all. The presumed but hard to prove physical loss of the strips in the 1899 fire leaves space for speculation, but none for actual research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paleojudaica.blogspot.co.il/2013_11_03_archive.html#810475699851573000 |title=The Shapira forgeries raise their moldering heads again |author=James R.

The fact is also that contemporary press articles which ridiculed Shapira using anti-Semitic stereotypes did not precede, but rather followed the rejection of the scroll by a large range of scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oskar K.

==Heritage==
Shapira "Moabitica" fakes still exist in museums and private collections around the world but are rarely displayed. By now they have become desirable collectibles in their own right.

The exact location of Shapira's shop on Christian Quarter Road in Jerusalem has now been identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guil|first=Shlomo|title=In the Footsteps of the Concealed Shop|journal=Et Mol|date=June 2012|volume=223}} Online reference https://www.academia.edu/2127379/In_Search_of_the_Shop_of_Moses_Wilhelm_Shapira_the_Leading_Figure_of_the_19TH_Century_Archaeological_Enigma&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael John Nigel Priestley''' {{post-nominals|country=NZL|ONZM|size=85%}} (21 July 1943 – 23 December 2014) was a New Zealand earthquake engineer. He made significant contributions to the design and retrofit of concrete structures, and developed the first displacement-based method of seismic design.

==Early life and education==
Born in [[Wellington]] in 1943,&lt;ref name="Calvi"&gt;{{cite book |last=Calvi |first=Gian Michele | chapter=Engineers understanding of earthquakes demand and structures response |authorlink= |title=Earthquake engineering in Europe |editor1-last=Garevski |editor1-first=Mihail |editor2-last=Ansal |editor2-first=Atilla |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=vtcnifItey4C&amp;pg=PA238 |accessdate=24 February 2015 |year=2010 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht |isbn=978-90-481-9544-2 |pages=238–239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley was educated at [[Wellington High School (New Zealand)|Wellington Technical College]] from 1956 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whs.school.nz/alumni/wall-of-high-achievers/4/ |title=Wall of high achievers |date= |website= |publisher=Wellington High School |accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When aged 16 he began studying civil engineering at the [[University of Canterbury]], completing a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] with first-class honours and, in 1966, a [[PhD]].&lt;ref name="NZSEE"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nzsee.org.nz/membership/distinguished-members/nigel-priestley/ |title=Nigel Priestley – life membership citation |date= |website= |publisher=New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering Inc. |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His thesis was titled ''Moment redistribution in prestressed concrete continuous beams''.

==Professional and academic career==
From 1967 to 1975 Priestley was the head of the structures laboratory at the [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Ministry of Works and Development]] central laboratories in [[Lower Hutt]], where he led structural studies of bridges and buildings. In 1976 he returned to the University of Canterbury where he was a senior lecturer and then [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in the Department of Civil Engineering. Over the next 10 years he conducted research into the seismic behaviour of masonry structures in collaboration with [[Thomas Paulay|Tom Paulay]], and reinforced concrete columns in collaboration with Bob Park. He was also the consulting proof engineer for many major rail bridges and industrial buildings in New Zealand. He served as president of the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering from 1985 to 1986.&lt;ref name="NZSEE"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canterbury.royalcommission.govt.nz/documents-by-key/20111128.1320/$File/WIT.PRI.0001.pdf |title=Curriculum vitae for Nigel Priestley |date=28 November 2011 |website= |publisher=Royal Commission of Inquiry into Building Failure Caused by the Canterbury Earthquakes |accessdate=24 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IAEE obit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iaee.or.jp/pdf/PriestleyObituary.pdf |title=Obituary for Professor Nigel Priestley |date= |website= |publisher=International Association for Earthquake Engineering |accessdate=26 February 2015 | first=Gregory | last= MacRae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley was then professor of structural engineering at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD) from 1987 until 2000. During this time his research focused on the seismic design of concrete bridges. In the wake of the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] and the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] he was a member of various [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans) committees and commissions reviewing the design of damaged bridges, and was also a member or chair of a number of Caltrans committees investigating the seismic strengthening of existing structures. He became professor emeritus of structural engineering at UCSD in 2001.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

He co-founded the European School for Advanced Studies in Reduction of Seismic Risk (ROSE School) in [[Pavia]], Italy, with Gian Michele Calvi, and served as its co-director from 2002 to 2008, and emeritus co-director from 2009.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roseschool.it/news/2014/12/93/professor-m-j-n-priestley-1943-2014.html |title=Professor M.J.N. Priestley (1943–2014) |date= |website= |publisher=ROSE School |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2010 Canterbury earthquake]] and [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]], Priestley was an expert witness before the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Building Failure Caused by the Canterbury Earthquakes, and chaired a panel that investigated the collapse of the [[CTV Building]] and PGC Building, and damage to the [[Hotel Grand Chancellor, Christchurch|Hotel Grand Chancellor]] and [[Forsyth Barr Building, Christchurch|Forsyth Barr Building]].&lt;ref name="Press obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/news/64515955/Nigel-Priestley-Luminary-engineer-dies | title=Nigel Priestley - 'Luminary' engineer dies | date= 29 December 2014 | work=The Press | accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley died in Christchurch of cancer on 23 December 2014.&lt;ref name="IAEE obit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Press obit"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Priestley was author or co-author of over 450 scientific papers and 250 research reports, and was the primary advisor for more than 25 doctoral students. His three books:
{{Bulleted list| ''Seismic Design of Concrete and Masonry Buildings'' with Tom Paulay (1992) |''Seismic Design and Retrofit of Bridges'' with [[Frieder Seible]] and Gian Michele Calvi (1996) |''Displacement-Based Seismic Design of Structures'' with Gian Michele Calvi and Mervyn Kowalsky (2007) }} are regarded as canonical texts in their particular areas.&lt;ref name="IAEE obit"/&gt;

His research at UCSD with Frieder Seible following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake into structural deficiencies in reinforced concrete columns supported bridges in California led to the development an economical retrofit solution involving the installation of a metal jacket to reduce the risk of column failure in seismic events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Priestley |first=M.

A team led by Priestley developed PRESSS (precast seismic structural system), a design methodology for earthquake-resistant buildings in which the building is designed as a collection of rocking blocks able to move independently of each other during a seismic event but are pulled back into their original position by unbonded post-tensioning cables within the precast concrete structure.&lt;ref name="Rebecca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manufacturerssuccessconnection.co.nz/mscnewswire/25373-new-zealand-civil-engineer-nigel-priestley-was-among-the-outstanding-seismic-constructors-of-his-era.html |title=New Zealander Nigel Priestley co-founded graduate earthquake engineer school in Pavia, Italy |date=30 January 2015 |website= |publisher=MSC NewsWire |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Priestley eschewed force-based design methods for earthquake-resistant buildings and developed the first method for displacement-based design, an approach that has been described as revolutionary.&lt;ref name="Calvi"/&gt; Traditional force-based methods could not adequately describe the expected damage, or performance, of a building subjected to seismic forces, whereas Priestley's displacement-based approach allows engineers to dictate the behaviour of a building in an earthquake.&lt;ref name="Calvi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rebecca"/&gt;

==Honours and awards==
Priestley was conferred honorary doctorates by [[ETH Zurich]] and the [[National University of Cuyo]], Argentina.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; He was a Fellow of the [[Institution of Professional Engineers New Zealand]] (IPENZ), the [[American Concrete Institute]] (ACI), and the New Zealand Society for Earthquake Engineering.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; In 1999 he was elected an honorary [[Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.royalsociety.org.nz/organisation/academy/fellowship/list-of-honorary-fellows-1870-present/p-r/ |title=The Academy: honorary fellows P–R |date= |website= |publisher=Royal Society of New Zealand |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won over 30 national and international awards for his research and technical papers, including the Fulton Gold Medal from IPENZ in 1973, the Raymond C. Reese Award from the ACI in 1984 and 1989, and the Freyssinet Medal from the [[International Federation for Structural Concrete|fib]] in 2010.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

In the [[2014 Birthday Honours (New Zealand)|2014 Queen's Birthday Honours]], Priestley was appointed an [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit]], for services to structural engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/queens-birthday-honours-list-2014 |title=Queen's Birthday honours list 2014 |date=2 June 2014 |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oliver Wellington "Billy" Sipple''' (November 20, 1941&amp;nbsp;– February 2, 1989) was a decorated U.S. [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] and [[Vietnam War]] veteran. On September 22, 1975, he grappled with [[Sara Jane Moore]] as she fired a pistol at [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Gerald Ford]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], causing her to miss. The subsequent public revelation that Sipple was [[gay]] turned the news story into a [[cause célèbre]] for [[LGBT]] rights activists, leading Sipple to unsuccessfully sue several publishers for [[Privacy laws of the United States|invasion of privacy]].

==Early life==
Oliver Wellington Sipple was born in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. He served in the [[United States Marine Corps]] and fought in [[Vietnam]]. [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|Shrapnel]] wounds suffered in December 1968 caused him to finish out his tour of duty in a [[Philadelphia]] veterans' hospital, from which he was released in March 1970. Sipple, who was [[closeted]] in his hometown of [[Detroit]], had met [[Harvey Milk]] in [[New York City]] and had participated in San Francisco's [[pride parade|gay pride parades]] and [[gay rights]] demonstrations.&lt;ref name="News And Sexuality: Medi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conduct Unbecoming: Ga"&gt;{{cite book |last=Shilts |first=Randy |authorlink=Randy Shilts |title=Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and Lesbians in the U.S. Military |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-312-34264-7 |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOAmL6JPCE0C&amp;dq=%22Oliver+Sipple%22+%22harvey+milk%22&amp;q=sipple#v=snippet&amp;q=sipple&amp;f=false |accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sipple was active in local causes, including the historic political campaigns of openly gay Board of Supervisors candidate Milk. The two were friends and Sipple would also be later described as a "prominent figure" in the gay community who had worked in a gay bar and was active in the [[Imperial Court System]].&lt;ref name="Electronic Media Law"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sadler |first=Roger L. |title=Electronic Media Law |publisher=Sage Publications Inc. |isbn=978-1-4129-0588-6 |year=2005 |url=https://books.google.com/booksd=i4egPXh4OoEC&amp;dq=%22Oliver+Sipple%22+%22harvey+milk%22&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 |accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Outing: Shattering the"&gt;{{cite book |last=Johansson |first=Warren |author2=William A.

He lived with a merchant seaman in a fourth-floor walk-up apartment located in San Francisco's [[Mission District, San Francisco, California|Mission District]]. He later spent six months in San Francisco's [[Veterans Health Administration|VA hospital]], and was frequently readmitted into the hospital in 1975, the year he saved Ford's life.

==Ford assassination attempt==
Sipple was part of a crowd of about 3,000 people who had gathered outside San Francisco's [[St. Francis Hotel]] to see President Ford on September 22, 1975. Ford, just emerging from the building, was vulnerable despite heavy security protection. Standing beside Sipple in the crowd, was [[Sara Jane Moore]]. She was about 40 feet (12&amp;nbsp;m) away from President Ford when she fired a single shot at him with a revolver, narrowly missing the President.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation|last=Radiolab Podcast|title=Radiolab - Oliver Sipple [Daryl Lembke, Daniel Luzer, Ken Maley, Sarah Jane Moore, Dan Morain]|date=2017-09-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkLy2P3_Q1g|accessdate=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; After realizing she had missed, she raised her arm again, and Sipple dived towards her; he grabbed her arm, possibly saving President Ford's life. Sipple said at the time, "I saw [her gun] pointed out there and I grabbed for it. [...] I lunged and grabbed the woman's arm and the gun went off."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes2/13/89" /&gt; The bullet ricocheted and hit John Ludwig, a 42-year-old taxi driver; he survived.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; The incident came just three weeks after [[Lynette Fromme]]'s [[Gerald Ford assassination attempt in Sacramento|assassination attempt]] on Ford. Reporters hounded Sipple who at first did not want his name used, nor his location known.&lt;ref name="News And Sexuality: Medi" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The police and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] immediately commended Sipple for his action at the scene, as did the media.&lt;ref name="News And Sexuality: Medi"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UrEIJ2MzMtYC|title=News And Sexuality: Media Portraits of Diversity|last=Castañeda|first=Laura|author2=Shannon B. Campbell|publisher=Sage Publications Inc|year=2006|isbn=978-1-4129-0999-0|location=|pages=|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lambda.net/~maximum/sipple.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070831033508/http://www.lambda.net/~maximum/sipple.html |archivedate=August 31, 2007 |df=mdy-all }} "Oliver Sipple 1941-1989". Accessed May 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The national news media portrayed Sipple as a hero, and noted his status as a former Marine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lambda.net/~maximum/sipple.html "Oliver Sipple 1941–1989"]. Accessed May 23, 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213022926/http://www.lambda.net/~maximum/sipple.html |date=February 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he was known to be homosexual among members of the San Francisco gay community, and had even participated in [[gay pride]] events, Sipple's sexual orientation was a secret from his family. He asked the press to keep such personal information off the record, making it clear that neither his mother nor his employer knew he was gay.&lt;ref name="Shilts"&gt;[[Randy Shilts|Shilts, Randy]] (1982). ''The Mayor of Castro Street: The Life and Times of Harvey Milk'', St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0-312-52330-0}} p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

The day after the incident, two [[answering machine]] messages [[outed]] Sipple to ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'s'' columnist [[Herb Caen]]. One was from Reverend Ray Broshears, the head of a gay activist group called the Lavender Panthers.&lt;ref name="radiolab"&gt;[http://www.radiolab.org/story/oliver-sipple/ Oliver Sipple - Radiolab] especially from around 16:30 to 20:00&lt;/ref&gt; The other message was from local gay activist [[Harvey Milk]], a friend of Sipple and on whose campaign for city council Sipple had worked.&lt;ref name="radiolab" /&gt; While discussing whether the truth about Sipple's sexuality should be disclosed, Milk told a friend, "It's too good an opportunity. For once we can show that gays do heroic things, not just all that caca about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms."&lt;ref name="Shilts"/&gt; Milk outed Sipple in order to portray him as a "gay hero" and so to "break the stereotype of homosexuals" being "timid, weak and unheroic figures".&lt;ref name="Conduct Unbecoming: Ga" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Electronic Media Law" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes2/13/89"&gt;Morain, Dan (February 13, 1989). [http://www.latimes.com/news/me-ford2,0,2563533,full.story "Sorrow Trailed a Veteran Who Saved a President and Then Was Cast in an Unwanted Spotlight"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;1. {{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Harold Evans, "[T]here was no invitation to the White House for Sipple, not even a commendation. Milk made a fuss about that. Finally, weeks later, Sipple received a brief note of thanks."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Evans, ''The Imperial Presidency: 1972–1980', Random House, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the thwarted assassination attempt, unable to reach Sipple,&lt;ref name="radiolab" /&gt; Caen wrote of Sipple as a gay man, and of a friend of Milk, speculating Ford offered praise "quietly" because of Sipple's sexual orientation. Sipple was besieged by reporters, as was his family. His mother refused to speak to him. [[Gay liberation]] groups petitioned local media to give Sipple his due as a gay hero. Caen published the private side of the Marine's story, as did a handful of other publications.&lt;ref name="Electronic Media Law" /&gt; Sipple then insisted to reporters that his sexuality was to be kept confidential.&lt;ref name="News And Sexuality: Medi" /&gt; Reporters labeled Sipple the "gay ex-Marine", and his mother disparaged and disowned him.&lt;ref name="Outing: Shattering the" /&gt; Later, when Sipple hid in a friend's apartment to avoid them, the reporters turned to Milk, arguably the most visible voice for the gay community.&lt;ref name="News And Sexuality: Medi" /&gt; Of President Ford's letter of thanks to Sipple, Milk suggested that Sipple's sexual orientation was the reason he received only a note, rather than an invitation to the [[White House]].&lt;ref name="latimes2/13/89" /&gt;

Sipple sued the ''Chronicle'',&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt; filing a $15-million [[Privacy law|invasion of privacy]] suit against Caen, seven named newspapers, and a number of unnamed publishers, for publishing the disclosures. The Superior Court in San Francisco dismissed the suit, and Sipple continued his legal battle until May 1984, when a state court of appeals held that Sipple had indeed become news, and that his sexual orientation was part of the story.&lt;ref name="latimes2/13/89" /&gt;

==Later years and death==
According to a 2006 article in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Sipple went through a period of estrangement with his parents, but the family later reconciled with him. Sipple's brother, George, told the newspaper, "[Our parents] accepted it. That was all. They didn't like it, but they still accepted. He was welcomed. Only thing was: Don't bring a lot of your friends."&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/30/AR2006123000160.html Caught in Fate's Trajectory, Along With Gerald Ford], Lynne Duke, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', December 30, 2006, p. D01.&lt;/ref&gt; However other sources indicate that Sipple's parents never fully accepted him. His mother, just after news broke of Sipple's sexual orientation, hung up on Sipple saying she never wished to speak to him again. His father is said to have told Sipple's brother to "forget [he had] a brother." Finally, when his mother died, his father did not allow him to attend her funeral.&lt;ref name="radiolab.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/oliver-sipple/|title=Oliver Sipple - Radiolab - WNYC Studios|publisher=|accessdate=September 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oliver W. Sipple headstone.JPG|thumb|Sipple's headstone at Golden Gate National Cemetery]]
Sipple's mental and physical health sharply declined over the years. He drank heavily, was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], fitted with a pacemaker, and gained weight.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-02-13/news/vw-1568_1_gay-big-deal-jerry-ford|title=Sorrow Trailed a Veteran Who Saved a President and Then Was Cast in an Unwanted Spotlight|journal=Los Angeles Times|first=DAN|last=MORAIN|date=February 13, 1989|accessdate=September 9, 2018|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/04/obituaries/ow-sipple-47-who-blocked-an-attempt-to-kill-ford-in-1975.html?mcubz=1|title=O.W.

On February 2, 1989, an acquaintance, Wayne Friday, found Sipple dead in his San Francisco apartment, with a bottle of [[Jack Daniel's]] next to him and the television still on.&lt;ref name="radiolab.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"/&gt; The San Francisco coroner estimated Sipple had been dead for approximately 10 days.&lt;ref name="radiolab.org"/&gt; He was 47 years old. Sipple's funeral was attended by about 30 people.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} President Ford and his wife sent a letter of sympathy to his family and friends. He was buried in [[Golden Gate National Cemetery]] south of San Francisco.

His $334 per month apartment near San Francisco's [[Tenderloin, San Francisco, California|Tenderloin District]] was found with many newspaper clippings of his actions on the fateful September afternoon in 1975, including a framed letter from the White House. A letter addressed to the friends of Oliver Sipple was on display for a short period after his death at the New Belle Saloon:

{{Quote|Mrs. Ford and I express our deepest sympathy in this time of sorrow involving your friend's passing...
–Former President Gerald Ford, February, 1989}}

In a 2001 interview with columnist Deb Price, Ford disputed the claim that Sipple was treated differently because of his sexual orientation, saying,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedomtoserve.blogspot.com/2006/12/president-committed-to-unity.html|title=The Frontlines: A President Committed to 'Unity'|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|As far as I was concerned, I had done the right thing and the matter was ended. I didn't learn until sometime later – I can't remember when – he was gay. I don't know where anyone got the crazy idea I was prejudiced and wanted to exclude gays.}}

==Legacy==
According to Castañeda and Campbell:

{{quote|The Sipple incident has been referred to, in passing, in a major motion picture and in a prime-time television program. Several law review articles and more than a dozen books and commentary pieces have also mentioned the perplexing ethical dimensions of the case.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Castañeda, Shannon B. Campbell, "News and Sexuality: Media Portraits of Diversity", SAGE, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4129-0999-6}}, page 66. The movie referenced (chapter notes in the book) is ''[[Absence of Malice]]'', and the TV program is an episode from ''[[L.A. Law]]'' from May 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A September 2017 episode of the radio program ''[[Radiolab]]'' covered Sipple's act of foiling the assassination of then President Ford. The episode goes into Sipple's act of heroism, his outing by [[Harvey Milk]] and [[Herb Caen]] and the news media, and the ethics of his outing in spite of his opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbez.org/shows/radiolab/oliver-sipple/3022e3dc-c854-493c-b26e-3dae0273a3bc|title=Radiolab, Oliver Sipple|last=|first=|date=September 22, 2017|website=[[WBEZ|WBEZ 91.5]] [[Chicago]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922232947/https://www.wbez.org/shows/radiolab/oliver-sipple/3022e3dc-c854-493c-b26e-3dae0273a3bc|archive-date=September 22, 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phil Klay''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|aɪ}}; born 1983) is an American writer.  He won the [[National Book Award]] for fiction in 2014 for his first book-length publication, a collection of short stories, ''[[Redeployment (book)|Redeployment]]''. In 2014 the National Book Foundation named him a 5 under 35 honoree. He was a [[United States Marine]] officer from 2005 to 2009.

==Early life==
Klay grew up in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester, New York]],&lt;ref name=nypost&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Keith J.|title=Phil Klay wins National Book Award for 'Redeployment'|url=https://nypost.com/2014/11/20/phil-klay-wins-national-book-award-for-redeployment/|accessdate=November 20, 2014|work=New York Post|date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of Marie-Therese F.

==Education and military career==
During the summer of 2004, while a student at [[Dartmouth College]], where he played rugby and boxed, Klay attended [[Officer Candidate School]] in [[Quantico, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=kane&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kane|first1=Alexander J.|title=An Interview With Phil Klay|url= http://www.dartreview.com/an-interview-with-phil-klay/| accessdate=November 21, 2014|work=The Dartmouth Review|date=May 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from Dartmouth College in 2005 and then joined the U.S. Marines, where he was commissioned as a second lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Powers|first1=John |title=''Redeployment'' Explores Iraq War's Physical And Psychic Costs|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/26/294811387/redeployment-explores-iraq-wars-physical-and-psychic-costs |accessdate=November 20, 2014|work=NPR|date=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later explained that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Asoulin|first1=Rebecca|title=Klay ’05 pens short stories about Iraq|url=http://thedartmouth.com/2014/03/30/arts/klay-05-pens-short-stories-about-iraq|accessdate=November 21, 2014|work=The Dartmouth|date=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|I knew we were going to war, and I joined for the reasons that many people serve. My family always had a strong respect for public service. I wanted to be part of a cause greater than myself. I was thinking of it as a historic moment, and I wanted to put myself in a position of responsibility so I could hopefully affect things for the better.}}
During the U.S. [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|troop surge in Iraq]], he served for thirteen months in [[Anbar province]]&lt;ref name=nypost/&gt; in Iraq from January 2007 to February 2008.&lt;ref name=regis/&gt; He left the military in 2009 and then earned an [[Master of Fine Arts|M.F.A.]] in creative writing from [[Hunter College]] in 2011.&lt;ref name=kane/&gt;

He described his time in the military as "a very mild deployment" as a Public Affairs Officer. He said that he wrote his collection of short stories based on his service and return to civilian life because:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reminder From A Marine: Civilians And Veterans Share Ownership Of War|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/03/06/286378088/reminder-from-a-marine-civilians-and-veterans-share-ownership-of-war|accessdate=November 21, 2014|work=NPR|date=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...what I really want — and I think what a lot of veterans want — is a sense of serious engagement with the wars, because it's important, because it matters, because lives are at stake, and it's something we did as a nation. That's something that deserves to be thought about very seriously and very honestly, without resorting to the sort of comforting stories that allow us to tie a bow on the experience and move on.}}

He has objected to the way civilians distance themselves from military experience:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Klay|first1=Phil|title=After War, a Failure of the Imagination|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/opinion/sunday/after-war-a-failure-of-the-imagination.html|accessdate=November 21, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|[V]eterans need an audience that is both receptive and critical. Believing war is beyond words is an abrogation of responsibility — it lets civilians off the hook from trying to understand, and veterans off the hook from needing to explain. You don't honor someone by telling them, "I can never imagine what you've been through." Instead, listen to their story and try to imagine being in it, no matter how hard or uncomfortable that feels.... [I]n the age of an all-volunteer military, it is far too easy for Americans to send soldiers on deployment after deployment without making a serious effort to imagine what that means.}}
He has described how "the gap between public mythology and lived experience" even affects both veteran-civilian dialogue and the veteran self-perception:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Rubenstein|first1=Rebecca|title=Interview with Phil Klay, 2014 National Book Award Finalist, Fiction |url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nba2014_f_klay_interv.html#.VHDTDGe9bPR|website=National Book Foundation|accessdate=November 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|[T]he mythologies are part of the experience of war. Often, we use them to try to make sense of what we've been through. We signed up with all those stories in our heads, after all, and then we came home to all the stories about war our culture was telling itself. Trying to have a conversation with someone (or even an honest conversation with yourself) about your war experience is an exercise in navigating through all the cultural garbage that's out there.}}
The culture, according to Klay, presents hurdles to communication and a shared understanding:&lt;ref name=kane/&gt; 
{{quote|One of the very strange things about coming home from the modern wars is you're coming home to a country where such a small percentage of the population is serving. You get a positive reception when people find out that you're a veteran, for the most part, but mostly what people feel very keenly is a kind of apathy: a disconnect from the fact that we're a nation at war. You come home and find out that the American people aren't really paying attention and that is profoundly strange. The ability to bridge that gap is important. Veterans don't want to feel isolated, and in order to do that you need to find some way of getting your memories and relationships to those memories across to someone whose notions of what you've been doing are very vague and defined frequently by a variety of clichés.}}

==Writing career==
Klay's collection of short stories, ''Redeployment'', was published in March 2014. Writing in the ''[[Daily Beast]]'', Brian Castner described the book "a clinic in the profanities of war". He wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castner|first1=Brian|title=The Profanity of War: Phil Klay’s ''Redeployment'' |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/01/the-profanity-of-war-phil-klay-s-redeployment.html|accessdate=November 23, 2014|work=The Daily Beast|date=March 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If there is a flaw to be found here it is only one of narrowness; all of these narrators are American men and most are Marines. But the voices are strong and varied, and we hear from enlisted men and officers, chaplains and lawyers, State Department do-gooders  and college students, and, of course, many grunts. The book contains plenty of blood-dead-hajji-fuck-kill-love, but also stories that violate innocence and faith itself. If obscenity scrapes just the skin then through the narrative arc of tragedy and suffering Klay has managed to dig down to the organs.}}

In the ''[[New York Times]]'', Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist [[Dexter Filkins]] wrote that "Klay succeeds brilliantly, capturing on an intimate scale the ways in which the war in Iraq evoked a unique array of emotion, predicament and heartbreak.... Iraq comes across not merely as a theater of war but as a laboratory for the human condition in extremis. ''Redeployment'' is ... the best thing written so far on what the war did to people’s souls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/books/review/redeployment-by-phil-klay.html | accessdate = November 13, 2018 | date= March 6, 2014 | title = The Long Road Home | first = Dexter | last= Filkins | author-link= Dexter Filkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, Klay won the National Book Award for fiction for his collection of short stories ''[[Redeployment (book)|Redeployment]]''. The judges described it as a "brutal, piercing sometimes darkly funny collection" that "stakes Klay's claim for consideration as the quintessential storyteller of America’s Iraq conflict."&lt;ref name=nypost/&gt; In his acceptance speech, he said: "I can't think of a more important conversation to be having — war's too strange to be processed alone. I want to thank everyone who picked up the book, who read it and decided to join the conversation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''Redeployment,'' ''Age Of Ambition'' Win National Book Awards|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/11/19/365288220/the-2014-national-book-awards|accessdate=November 20, 2014|work=NPR|date=November 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Catapano|first1=Peter|title=For Phil Klay, a National Book Award Winner, War Is ‘Too Strange’ to Process Alone|url=http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/for-phil-klay-a-national-book-award-winner-war-is-too-strange-to-process-alone/|accessdate=November 21, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first author to win the prize for his first book-length work of fiction since [[Julia Glass]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Italie |first1=Hillel |title=Phil Klay Wins National Book Award for Fiction|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/phil-klay-wins-national-book-award-fiction-27041346|accessdate=November 20, 2014|work=ABC News|date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been thought "something of a longshot" to win.&lt;ref name=ftrain&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alter|first1=Alexandra|title=Phil Klay's Literary Salon on the F Train|url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/phil-klays-literary-salon-on-the-f-train/|accessdate=November 20, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' included ''Redeployment'' on its list of the "Ten Best Books of 2014",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 10 Best Books of 2014 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/books/review/the-10-best-books-of-2014.html|accessdate=December 4, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it received the [[National Book Critics Circle]]'s 2014 [[National Book Critics Circle Award#John Leonard Award|John Leonard Award]] given for a best first book in any genre.&lt;ref name= nbcc2014&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookcritics.org/blog/archive/national-book-critics-circle-announces-its-finalists-for-publishing-year-20|title=National Book Critics Circle Announces Finalists for Publishing Year 2014|work=bookcritics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, he received the James Webb Award for fiction dealing with Marines or Marine Corps life from the [[Marine Corps Heritage Foundation]] for ''Redeployment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marineheritage.org/Awards_2015.asp | website = Marine Corps Heritage Foundation | accessdate = December 15, 2016 | title =  Awards }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, ''Redeployment'' received the [[W.Y.

Y. Boyd Literary Award 'for Excellence in Military Fiction'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has described [[Colum McCann]], author of ''[[Let the Great World Spin]]'', as his "mentor".&lt;ref name=ftrain/&gt; He describes himself as a Catholic and "a fan of a lot of ... the great Catholic literature–Flannery O'Connor, Francois Mauriac, Graham Greene, Evelyn Waugh." He has said that "religion and the tradition of Catholic thought ... helps you ask the right kinds of questions about these issues... There's a type of religious sentiment that is very certain of the answers and very certain about what should be proselytized. And then there's another type of religious tradition which is really much more about ... doubt and working your way towards more and more difficult questions. And I think that's the tradition that appeals to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In 'Redeployment,' Former Marine Explores The Challenges Of Coming Home|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/03/20/394280459/in-redeployment-former-marine-explores-the-challenges-of-coming-home|accessdate=March 21, 2015|work=Fresh Air|publisher=NPR|date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Charles Davidson''', [[Order of Canada|CM]], [[Order of British Columbia|OBC]] (born 4 November 1946 in [[Hydaburg, Alaska]]), is a [[Canada|Canadian]] artist of [[Haida people|Haida]] heritage. Davidson’s Haida name is ''Guud San Glans'', which means "Eagle of The Dawn". He is a leading figure in the renaissance of [[Haida art]] and culture.

==Life and work==

[[File:White Rock, BC - Haida totem pole 01.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Detail of "Gyaana", totem pole designed by Davidson and carved by him and others, Lions Lookout Park, [[White Rock, British Columbia]], Canada.]]

Davidson is known internationally as a carver of totem poles and masks, printmaker, painter and jeweller.  He lives near Vancouver, working out of a studio on [[Semiahmoo First Nation]] land and making annual return visits to [[Haida Gwaii]].

His parents are [[Claude Davidson (Haida artist)|Claude]] and Vivian Davidson. Through Claude, he is the grandson of the Haida artist and memoirist [[Florence Davidson]].  He is a member of the Eagle [[Moiety (kinship)|moiety]], Ts'ał'lanas lineage.  His younger brother and former apprentice, [[Reg Davidson]], is also a Haida carver.

In infancy, Robert Davidson moved with his family to the Haida village of [[Masset, British Columbia]], on [[Queen Charlotte Islands|Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands)]]. For high school, he moved to [[Vancouver]] to attend [[Point Grey Secondary School]] in 1965. In 1966 he became apprenticed to the master Haida carver [[Bill Reid]].  In 1967 he began studies at the [[Emily Carr Institute of Art and Design|Vancouver School of Art]].  In 1969 he carved and raised the first totem pole on Haida Gwaii in approximately ninety years.

His works are included in the collections of the [[National Gallery of Canada]], the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] and the [[Vancouver Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name=GG&gt;{{cite web|title=Eight remarkable Canadians win Governor General’s Awards in Visual and Media Arts from the Canada Council for the Arts|url=http://canadacouncil.ca/en/media-arts/news-room/news/2010/governor-generals-awards-in-visual-and-media-arts-%282010%29|work=news release|publisher=Canada Council for the Arts|accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant solo exhibition of his work, ''Robert Davidson: The Abstract Edge'', was organized by the [[Museum of Anthropology]] at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) for viewing at the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]] in 2007.

'''Rudi Schneider''' (July 27, 1908 – April 28, 1957), son of Josef Schneider and brother of [[Willi Schneider]], was an [[Austria]]n [[Spiritualism|Spiritualist]] and [[Mediumship#Physical_mediumship|physical medium]].&lt;ref name=underwood1&gt;[[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Underwood, Peter]].

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==

Schneider began participating in [[séance]]s with his elder brother [[Willi Schneider]] at age 11. Both Rudi and Willi claimed to channel a [[spirit]] entity called "Olga" who in the séance room claimed to be "Lola Montez" the nickname of Eliza Eosanna Gilbert (1821-1861) the mistress of [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]]. Schneider held his first solo séance in 1919 and is said to have been able to summon the ghostly image of a human hand, as well as a number of other manifestations that are traditionally associated with séances.&lt;ref name=jaspr1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fodor1/&gt; 

==Investigations==
Schneider began giving demonstrations to the Vienna ''Institut fur Radiumforschung der Academic der Wissenschaffen'' in 1923. In an investigation into the [[mediumship]] of Schneider in 1924 the physicists [[Stefan Meyer (physicist)|Stefan Meyer]] and Karl Przibram caught Schneider evading the controls in a series of séances. After Meyer and Przibram's accusations, the institute concluded that the abilities that Schneider had demonstrated up to that point were all, based on the balance of probability, the result of trickery and that he was no-longer of interest to them.&lt;ref name=jaspr1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price|Price, Harry]]. (1936). ''Confessions of a Ghost-Hunter''. Putnam. p. 233. "Rudi has been accused of producing spurious phenomena many times, by many persons. In 1924 Professors Meyer and Przibram, of Vienna, accused him of evading control. On April 28, 1933, Professor Przibram wrote me: "We know that Rudi evaded control at the [Vienna] séances and we have no reason to believe that any of the phenomena we saw were of supranormal character."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thruelsen, Richard. (1961). ''Adventures of the Mind''. Knopf. p. 325. "An analogous case was that of the Schneider brothers, Willy and Rudy, who performed a series of teleplastic manifestations that were carefully examined by Professor Przibram of the University of Vienna and discovered to be nothing but deceptions."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, Leslie. (1991). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism &amp; Parapsychology''. Gale Research Company. p. 1463. "In 1923-24, Prof. Dr. Stefan Meyer and Prof. Dr. Karl Przibram, of the Institut fur Radiumforschung der Academie der Wissenschaffen, Vienna, detected Rudi evading control. After that they had no reason to believe that any of the phenomena were of supernormal character."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, American journalist Warren Vinton attended séances with Schneider and came to the conclusion that the movement of objects were fraudulently produced by other members of the Schneider family concealed in the room.&lt;ref name=fodor1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vinton, Warren. (1927). ''The Famous Schneider Mediumship: A Critical Study of Alleged Supernormal Events''. No. 4 April in [[Charles Kay Ogden|Ogden, Charles]]. (1995). ''Psyche: An Annual General and Linguistic Psychology 1920-1952''. Routledge/Thoemmes Press. {{ISBN|0415127793}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1927, Vinton published an article in ''Psyche'' which accused Schneider of being a fraud and using a hidden accomplice. Another researcher, [[J. Malcolm Bird]] who attended a séance with Schneider also supported Vinton's accusations.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, William. (1941). ''An Objective Study in Extra-sensory Perception''. Temple University. p. 60. "In Rudi's home in Braunau, Vinton found that any of the phenomena were possible because of the cooperation of confederates both in the circle and in the cabinet, combined with the use of reaching rods."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Alfred. (1982). ''Extra-Sensory Powers: A Century of Psychical Research''. Overlook Press. p. 202. "In August 1926 Dr. E. J. Dingwall, accompanied by the American journalist W. J. Vinton, again visited Braunau for sittings with Willi and Rudi. They hoped to substantiate Dingwall's theory that the sittings in the Schneider Home were fraudulent, perpetrated by the various members of the family. Vinton wrote a report in which he concluded that the phenomena observed during the ten séances he had attended were caused by someone who had entered the séance room secretly, unknown to the sitters."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary]]. (1994). ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits''. Guinness World Records Limited. p. 293. {{ISBN|0-85112-748-7}} "The first major controversy erupted following publication in the metaphysical journal ''Psyche'' of a hypothesis of fraud that involved a confederate sneaking into the séance room unobserved. The article was written by an American journalist, W. J. Vinton, who had attended 10 séances along with Dingwall. Vinton's hypothesis was supported by Malcolm Bird of the American Society for Psychical Research (ASPR), who attended only a single séance during which he was supposed to have been guarding the door. Another skeptic was Walter Franklin Prince, who attended 10 sittings and saw only some curtains blowing, which he concluded could have been contrived."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franklyn, Julian. (2003). ''Dictionary of the Occult''. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 228. "In 1926 Mr. W. J. Vinton sat several times with Rudi at the latter's home in Braunau and came to the conclusion that the movements of objects were fraudulently produced by other members of the Schneider family concealed in the room. In 1927 Mr. Malcolm Bird, the editor of ''The Scientific American'', also had a sitting at Braunau and came to the same conclusion of a conspiracy of fraud."&lt;/ref&gt;

The parapsychologist [[Walter Franklin Prince]] attended a series of sittings with Schneider and no [[paranormal]] phenomena was observed. In his notes in the Bulletin VII of the Boston SPR published under ''Experiments with Physical Mediums in Europe'' (1928) he wrote "despite my studied and unremitting complaisance, no phenomena have occurred when I had any part in the control, save curtain movement which were capable of the simplest explanation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Spence|Spence, Lewis]]. (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology''. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 805&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst Prince did not detect any concrete evidence of fraud he found the red light too dim to observe the medium and suspected that Schneider's spirit guide "Olga" insisted the sitters talk loudly to act as a distraction and possible cover for an accomplice in the room.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Alfred. (1982). ''Extra-Sensory Powers: A Century of Psychical Research''. Overlook Press. p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]] it was discovered that Schneider had a "sexual climax" during some of his séances.&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Underwood, Peter]]. (1972). ''Into the Occult''. Harrap. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; Schneider had an [[orgasm]] during some of his mediumship practices.&lt;ref&gt;Devereux, George. (1974). ''Psychoanalysis and the Occult''. Souvenir Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[D. H. Rawcliffe]] wrote that Schneider "had been repeatedly and comprehensively exposed" as a fraudulent trickster.&lt;ref&gt;Rawcliffe, Donovan. (1988). ''Occult and Supernatural Phenomena''. Dover Publications. p. 313. "Rudi, and his brother Willi, had been repeatedly and comprehensively exposed as fraudulent tricksters, yet such is the faith of those imbued with a penchant for the mysterious that both spiritualists and psychical researchers alike continued to believe in the possibility of their supernatural powers. "Ectoplasm" and other "teleplastic manifestations" were their main specialities. These, however, were investigated by Professor Przibram of the University of Vienna and found to be nothing more than deceptions."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harry Price===
[[File:Rudi Schneider with Harry Price.png|thumb|left|Rudi Schneider (left) with [[Harry Price]] (right).]]
In 1929, Schneider took part in a number of experiments conducted by notable investigator/debunker [[Harry Price]] at the [[National Laboratory of Psychical Research]]. Price conducted a series of experiments in which Schneider was connected to a series of pressure switches that would alert observers if he moved his hands, feet or limbs in any significant way. Schneider was also physically restrained during some of the experiments.&lt;ref name=fodor1/&gt; Price recorded that during his experiments various phenomena were observed; including the movement of objects placed around the room and the apparent manifestation of mysterious hands and shapes.&lt;ref name=fodor1/&gt;

Schneider claimed he could [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitate]] objects but according to Price a photograph taken on April 28, 1932 showed that Schneider had managed to free his arm to move a handkerchief from the table. After this, many scientists considered Schneider to be exposed as a fraud, however there was a controversy over the photograph from the [[parapsychology]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price|Price, Harry]]. (2003). ''Fifty Years of Psychical Research''. Kessinger Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0766142428}} (reprint)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Stuart Holroyd| Holroyd, Stuart]]. (1976). ''Minds Without Boundaries''. Aldus Books. p. 63. Holroyd reprinted a large version of the photograph in his book and a zoom in on Schneider. The photograph depicts Schneider in a pajama jacket with a freed hand reaching out to move a handkerchief from the table.&lt;/ref&gt; Price wrote that the findings of the other experiments should be revised due to the evidence showing how Schneider could free himself from the controls.&lt;ref name="Spence, Lewis 2003 p. 806"&gt;[[Lewis Spence|Spence, Lewis]]. (2003). ''Encyclopedia of Occultism and Parapsychology''. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 806&lt;/ref&gt;

After Price had exposed Schneider, various scientists such as [[Karl Przibram]] and the magician [[Henry R. Evans|Henry Evans]] wrote to Price telling him that they agreed that Schneider evaded control during his séances and congratulated Price on the success of unmasking the fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Tabori, Paul. (1966). ''Harry Price: The Biography of a Ghosthunter''. Living Books. pp. 114-115&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition, SPR members who were highly critical of Price, supported Schneider's mediumship and promoted a [[conspiracy theory]] that the Price photograph was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilary Evans|Evans, Hilary]]. (1982). ''Intrusions: Society and the Paranormal''. Routledge Kegan &amp; Paul. p. 166. {{ISBN|978-0710009272}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPR member [[Anita Gregory]] claimed Price had deliberately faked the photograph to discredit SPR research and ruin Schneider's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anita Gregory|Gregory, Anita]]. (1977). ''Anatomy of a Fraud: Harry Price and the Medium Rudi Schneider''. Annals of Science 34: 449-549.&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologist [[Alan Gauld]] wrote that Gregory's analysis of the photograph was misconceived and there was no direct evidence the photograph taken by Price had been tampered with.&lt;ref&gt;Gauld, Alan. (1978). [http://www.harrypricewebsite.co.uk/Seance/Schneider/gregory-gauld.htm ''Review of Anita Gregory's Anatomy of a Fraud: Harry Price and the Medium Rudi Schneider'']. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research (Vol. 49, pp. 828-835).&lt;/ref&gt; In opposition to Gregory the photographic expert [[Vernon Harrison]] testified that the photograph was genuine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon Harrison|Harrison, Vernon]]. (1979). ''Letter to the Editor''. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. 50: 45-46.&lt;/ref&gt; Harrison suggested that instead of fraud the shock of the flash caused Schneider to jerk involuntarily breaking free from the control, and when the second flash went off, recorded him in that position.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vernon Harrison|Harrison, Vernon]]. (1987). [http://www.harrypricewebsite.co.uk/Seance/Schneider/schneider-harrison.htm ''The Mediumship of Willi and Rudi Schneider'']. Journal of the Unitarian Society for Psychical Studies. No. 38, Winter.&lt;/ref&gt; SPR member John L. Randall who reviewed the Price and Schneider case also came to the conclusion the photograph was genuine. However, Randall disagreed with Harrison that Schneider's movement was accidental and wrote the photograph was evidence for Price's claim that Schneider had freed his hand with fraudulent intent.&lt;ref&gt;Randall, John. (2000). [http://www.harrypricewebsite.co.uk/Biography/price-randall.htm ''Harry Price: The Case for the Defence'']. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research (Vol. 64.3, No. 860).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[V. J. Woolley]] criticized the electronic controls of Price's experiments. He noted they were liable to go wrong such as a broken wire and that they were not fraud proof like Price had claimed. According to Woolley one sitter alone could "free his feet by connecting his metal floor plates by a piece of wire... I do not feel that the electrical control excludes [fraud] any better than the older methods which Mr Price describes as obsolete".&lt;ref&gt;Woolley, V. J. (1930). ''Harry Price. Rudi Schneider: A Scientific Examination of His Mediumship''. Journal of the Society for Psychical Research 25: 125-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eugéne Osty===

In 1930, Schneider began working with French paranormal investigator [[Eugéne Osty]] at the ''Institut Metapsychique''.&lt;ref name=otsy1/&gt; Osty placed an object in the room with Schneider and targeted it with a camera that had an infrared trigger designed to take a picture if it detected movement around the object. The alarm was triggered several times though the photographs showed no evidence of Schneider having interfered with it.&lt;ref name=otsy1/&gt; Osty concluded that he was recording the passage of an [[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]] like substance that was indicative of telekinetic movement.&lt;ref name=otsy1/&gt; He wrote that the substance registered on sound recording equipment when it moved, and that it could pass through objects put in place to impede it.&lt;ref name=fodor1/&gt;&lt;ref name=otsy1/&gt;

Osty's experiments with Schneider have been criticized by skeptics. [[D. H. Rawcliffe]] for example noted that "various discrepancies have come to light which throw the whole of Osty's experiments into doubt. Price made a prolonged investigation of Rudi Schneider and proved conclusively that the medium resorted to trickery when he believed himself to be unobserved... Osty has too often shown in the past, despite some intellectual ability, evidence of an amateurish and uncritical approach to his subject."&lt;ref&gt;Rawcliffe, D. H. (1987). ''Occult and Supernatural Phenomena''. Dover Publications. p. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other tests===

[[File:Rudi Schneider being tested.png|thumb|Price testing Rudi Schneider.]]

In the 1920s [[Fritz Wittels]] who had attended séances with Schneider wrote that "With occult waves running high in Vienna, there was a famous medium named Rudi Schneider, a few of whose meetings I attended. Whenever I came, however, either nothing happened at all or the things which did happen were obvious frauds."&lt;ref&gt;[[Fritz Wittels|Wittels, Fritz]]. (1996). ''Freud and the Child Woman: The Memoirs of Fritz Wittels''. Yale University Press. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported by [[Stefan Meyer (physicist)|Stefan Meyer]] that Schneider was exposed as a fraud by Dr. Lothar Lenkei.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Besterman|Besterman, Theodore]]. (1968). ''Collected Papers on the Paranormal''. Garrett Publications. p. 377&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, [[E. R. Dodds]] and [[V. J. Woolley]] attended six séances in dim red light with Schneider and absolutely no phenomena occurred. Dodds wrote that [[semen]] was found after one of the séances.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. R. Dodds|Dodds, E. R]]. (2000). ''Missing Persons: An Autobiography''. Oxford University Press. pp. 101-102. {{ISBN|978-0198120865}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a series of [[mediumship]] sessions in 1932 which included the researchers and scientists Dr. [[William Brown (psychologist)|William Brown]], [[C. E. M. Joad]], Professor [[D. F. Fraser-Harris]], Professor [[John Alexander Gunn]] and [[Julian Huxley]], no paranormal phenomena was observed in the séance room with Schneider. Huxley wrote that there was "no proof of any communication with departed spirits".&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian Huxley|Huxley, Julian]]. (1970). ''Memories''. Allen &amp; Unwin. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Zoologist [[Solly Zuckerman]] also attended some séance sittings and wrote that the mediumship of Schneider had not passed any scientific tests.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solly Zuckerman|Zuckerman, Solly]]. (1979). ''From Apes to Warlords: The Autobiography (1904-1946) of Solly Zuckerman''. Hamilton. p. 49. {{ISBN|978-0241896594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Howard Livens]] on 15 November 1932 attended a séance with Schneider and no paranormal phenomenon was observed.&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Society for Psychical Research''. 1932. Volume 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between October 1933 and March 1934 Schneider was investigated by the [[Society for Psychical Research]] in fifty-five sittings and not a single paranormal phenomenon was observed. [[Infrared]] ray apparatus was installed by [[Oliver Gatty]] working with [[Theodore Besterman]]. The experiments proved negative, no telekinetic phenomena of any kind were observed or any absorption of the infrared rays. Every chance was given to Schneider to prove his alleged paranormal abilities but nothing paranormal occurred. Another researcher, [[Whately Carington]] had proven by tests that the spirit "Olga" which Schneider channeled in reality was indistinguishable in psychological make-up from himself.&lt;ref&gt;Franklyn, Julian. (2003). ''Dictionary of the Occult''. Kessinger Reprint Edition. p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oliver Gatty]] and [[Theodore Besterman]] communicated their results to ''Nature'', concluding that in their tests there was "no good evidence that Rudi Schneider possesses supernormal powers."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v134/n3399/abs/134965c0.html Further Tests of the Medium Rudi Schneider]. (1934). ''Nature'' 134, 965–966.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were no more investigations as in his later years Schneider gave up mediumship to become an [[auto mechanic]].&lt;ref name="Spence, Lewis 2003 p. 806"/&gt;

She was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[California State Senate|California State Senator]], who represented the [[California's 21st State Senate district|21st Senate District]] at the time of her death, and previously represented the [[California's 17th State Senate district|17th Senate District]] from 2011 to 2012. She was also a member of the [[California State Assembly]] from 2002 to 2008, representing the [[California's 36th State Assembly district|36th district]].   She was the wife of [[State Board of Equalization (California)|California State Board of Equalization Member]] [[George Runner]]. From 2004 to 2008, then-Senator George Runner and then-Assemblywoman Sharon Runner were the first husband and wife in California history to serve concurrently in the [[California State Legislature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assembly.ca.gov/clerk/billslegislature/documents/Asm_Handbook_2007-08.pdf|title=California Legislature Handbook 2007-2008|publisher=[[California State Legislature]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011025926/http://www.assembly.ca.gov/clerk/BILLSLEGISLATURE/documents/Asm_Handbook_2007-08.pdf|archivedate=2009-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born Sharon Yvonne Oden in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] and raised in the [[Antelope Valley]], Runner graduated from [[Antelope Valley High School]] and attended [[Antelope Valley College]].&lt;ref name="OfficialBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sharonrunner.com/about-sharon/|title=About Sharon Runner|publisher=Sharon Runner for State Senate|accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Runner was an officer for the Antelope Valley Republican Assembly and remained active in many Republican groups in the Antelope Valley, including the Palmdale and High Desert Republican Women's Clubs, until her death. She served on the board of California Women Lead, a bi-partisan organization that encourages and empowers women running for public office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cawomenlead.org/board.html|title=California Women Lead|publisher=California Women Lead|date=|accessdate=2011-01-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725145538/http://www.cawomenlead.org/board.html|archivedate=2011-07-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as President of the board of California's Women's Leadership Association for 2011-12.&lt;ref name="OfficialBio" /&gt;

She was chosen as a delegate to the 2000 and 2004 Republican National Conventions. She worked on several statewide campaigns including Governor [[Pete Wilson]], [[California gubernatorial recall election, 2003|California Gubernatorial Recall Election]], Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Meg Whitman]] for Governor 2010.&lt;ref name="OfficialBio" /&gt;

In 2009, Runner was appointed by Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board. She served on the board until December 22, 2010.&lt;ref name="CUIAB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cuiab.ca.gov/bio_runner.shtm|title=Sharon Runner, Board Member|publisher=State of California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board|accessdate=January 26, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104182600/http://www.cuiab.ca.gov/bio_runner.shtm|archivedate=November 4, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Runner began working part-time for the California State Senate Republican Caucus conducting community outreach events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://senate.ca.gov/sites/senate.ca.gov/files/senatepayrollbg_022814b.pdf|title=Senate Payroll - 2/28/2014|publisher=California State Senate|accessdate=2014-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also ran "The Runner Group," a public relations/marketing company she founded in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scdd.ca.gov/sharonrunner.htm|title=State Senator Sharon Runner - 17th Senate District|publisher=State Council on Developmental Disabilities|accessdate=2014-12-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101053857/http://www.scdd.ca.gov/sharonrunner.htm|archivedate=2015-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assembly career===
In 2002, Runner was elected to represent the 36th Assembly District and served in the State Assembly for three terms, from 2002 to 2008.&lt;ref name="OfficialBio" /&gt;

While in the Assembly she served on the Veteran's Committee; Housing Committee; Select Committees dealing with Foster Care; the Committee on Drug and Alcohol Abuse; as well as the Task Force on the Environment, Energy, and the Economy.  
She also held key fiscal leadership positions, serving as the Vice Chair of the Appropriations Committee and as a member of the Budget Committee and Budget Subcommittee on Education.&lt;ref name="OfficialBio" /&gt;

During her first term in office, Runner was appointed as Assistant Republican Leader by former Assembly Republican Leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]].&lt;ref name="OfficialBio" /&gt;

====Jessica's Law====
In 2006, along with her husband, Senator [[George Runner]], Sharon Runner authored [[Proposition 83]], California's version of [[Jessica's Law]]. The measure passed with the support of 71% of California voters, and passed in 57 of California's 58 counties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vote2006.sos.ca.gov/Returns/prop/mapR083.htm |title=CA Secretary of State - General Election |publisher=California Secretary of State |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721033701/http://vote2006.sos.ca.gov/Returns/prop/mapR083.htm |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessica's Law ensures that all sexual offenders who are convicted of activity with children under the age of 14 are put into a prison with a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years or 25 years to life. It eliminates all "first-offense" sexual offense provisions from California law.

It also eliminates all "good-time" credits for sexual offenders serving prison terms; under the authored provisions they are required to serve their entire sentence and will not be released for good behavior. The law requires that sex offenders who are released from prison wear a GPS bracelet for life.

It also creates a 2,000-foot (615 meter) zone around schools and parks in which registered sex offenders are prohibited from residing.

===Senate career===
Runner ran for election to the California State Senate, representing the 17th District.  The seat was left vacant by her husband, [[George Runner]], who was elected to the [[State Board of Equalization (California)|State Board of Equalization]] in November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2010-general/50-board-of-equalization.pdf|title=2010 General Elections Results - Board of Equalization|publisher=California Secretary of State|accessdate=2011-01-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110313182309/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2010-general/50-board-of-equalization.pdf|archivedate=2011-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary election took place on February 15, 2011, she defeated Democrat Darren Parker 66%-34% to avoid a runoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/Special/sd17/ |title=Senate District 17 - Special Election - Elections &amp; Voter Information - California Secretary of State |publisher=California Secretary of State |accessdate=2011-01-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805141738/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/Special/sd17/ |archivedate=2012-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To focus on her recover from a double lung transplant necessitated by her limited scleroderma, she chose to not seek re-election in 2012&lt;ref name="Antelope Valley Press"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theavtimes.com/2012/02/22/senator-sharon-runner-wont-seek-re-election/|title=Senator Sharon Runner won't seek re-election|publisher=[[Antelope Valley Press]]|accessdate=2012-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was succeeded by [[Steve Knight (politician)|Steve Knight]] in the renumbered 21st Senate District.

A special election for the 21st Senate District, vacated by [[Steve Knight (politician)|Steve Knight]] who was elected to Congress in November 2014, was held on March 17, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ca.gov/news.php?id=18837|title=Governor Brown Issues Proclamation Declaring Special Elections For 7th, 21st and 35th Senate Districts|publisher=Office of Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr.|accessdate=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a successful recruitment effort, Runner decided to enter the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scvnews.com/2015/01/14/runner-confirms-bid-for-knights-senate-seat/|title=Runner Confirms Bid for Knights Senate Seat|publisher=SCV News|accessdate=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the only candidate on the ballot, and easily won reelection to the Senate with 100% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-pol-state-senate-20150129-story.html|title=Sharon Runner only candidate for California's 21st Senate District|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2015-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Runner was sworn into the State Senate on March 19, 2015, where she would serve until her death the following year.

==Community involvement==
In 1977, Runner co-founded [[Desert Christian Schools (California)|Desert Christian Schools]] with her husband, [[George Runner]]. It has since grown to become one of the largest private schools in California with nearly 1,700 students on three separate campuses.&lt;ref name="OurHistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desertchristian.com/about-us/ourhistory.cfm|title=Our History|publisher=Desert Christian Schools|accessdate=January 26, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301163614/http://www.desertchristian.com/about-us/ourhistory.cfm|archivedate=March 1, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served on the Board until her death. Prior to Desert Christian Schools, Runner worked as a licensed realtor with Red Carpet Real Estate Company where she was named "Realtor of the Year."&lt;ref name="OfficialBio" /&gt;

She volunteered her time on several boards and committees including the United Way, Antelope Valley Hospital Gift Foundation, Antelope Valley Crime Task Force, Healthy Homes Advisory Council, and [[Care Net]], a pregnancy resource center. She also spent five years on the Board of Directors for the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce. In 1998, [[California Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]] appointed Runner to serve on the Antelope Valley Fair Board of Directors, where she oversaw the operations of the 50th Agriculture District and managed its multimillion dollar budget. She held this position until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avfair.com/aboutus/documents/PastDirectorsServiceRecord.pdf|title=Past Directors of Antelope Valley Fair|publisher=Antelope Valley Fair|accessdate=January 26, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212023957/http://avfair.com/aboutus/documents/PastDirectorsServiceRecord.pdf|archivedate=December 12, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was involved with her church, Grace Chapel Church in [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], for over 30 years.

==Awards and recognitions==
In 2013, Runner was awarded the Marian Bergeson Lifetime Achievement Award for her work helping women run for office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meetup.com/LNRWF2014/events/132234332/|title=Women of Character Awards Dinner|publisher=Laguna Niguel Republican Women Federated|accessdate=2014-12-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101150457/http://www.meetup.com/LNRWF2014/events/132234332/|archivedate=2015-01-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014 Runner received the Spirit of Leadership Award by the Scleroderma Foundation of Southern California for her advocacy in increasing funding to find a cure for Scleroderma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wherevent.com/detail/Scleroderma-Foundation-Southern-Scleroderma-Foundation-Key-to-a-Cure-Gala|title=Scleroderma Foundation Key to a Cure Gala|publisher=Scleroderma Foundation, Southern California Chapter|accessdate=2014-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They had a son, Micah, daughter-in-law, Sandy, daughter, Rebekah (who serves in the [[U.S. Coast Guard]]), son-in-law, James, and four grandchildren.&lt;ref name="OfficialBio" /&gt; Through her marriage, Runner was an aunt to [[Major League Baseball]] player [[Casey Fien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20081207/SPORTS02/812070457/1048/SPORTS|title=This pitcher has government backing|date=December 7, 2008|newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207232911/http://www.freep.com/article/20081207/SPORTS02/812070457/1048/SPORTS|archivedate=December 7, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and death==
Runner was diagnosed with "limited" [[scleroderma]], an [[autoimmune disease]] affecting her lungs, in 1984 at the age of 30. On February 24, 2012, Runner underwent a successful double-[[lung transplant]] at the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailynews.com/government-and-politics/20120227/state-sen-sharon-runner-has-double-lung-transplant-will-return-to-work-says-husband|title=State Sen.

Runner was a member of the Scleroderma Foundation's Legislative Committee, where she worked to obtain  [[federal funding]] for scleroderma research. She also sat on the Advisory Committee for Sierra Donor Services, a donor procurement organization in [[Sacramento, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donatelifefloat.org/prod/components/media_center/riders/srunner.html|title=Rose Parade Float - 2014 Rider - Sharon Runner|publisher=Donate Life|accessdate=2014-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Sing girls"''' ({{zh|c=星女郎|p=''xīng nǚ láng''}}) is a nickname for actresses who starred alongside [[Stephen Chow]], often as the main character's romantic interest.&lt;ref name=eastday&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enjoy.eastday.com/e/20071012/u1a3160012.html | title=张雨绮亲述一夜成名:30秒搞定周星驰 (Zhang Yuqi's overnight fame: 30 seconds to win over Stephen Chow) | author=邱致理 (Qiu Zhili) | publisher=南都周刊 | date=10 December 2007 | accessdate=28 June 2009|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are young, new actresses who go on to receive considerable media attention after appearing in one of Chow's films,&lt;ref name=dayoo&gt;{{cite web | publisher=大洋 (dayoo.com) | accessdate=28 June 2009 | url=http://life.dayoo.com/fashion/200906/09/33683_7956406_5.htm | title=从"翻版张柏芝"看女星整容是非 (From "New Cecilia Cheung", seeing if female stars are having makeovers or not) | editor=许慧健 (Xu Huijian) | date=9 June 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705203656/http://life.dayoo.com/fashion/200906/09/33683_7956406_5.htm | archivedate=5 July 2009 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their success is often attributed to the attention brought to them by Chow&amp;mdash;[[Zhang Yuqi]], for example, has been referred to as Chow's "[[:wikt:protégée|protégée]]" after appearing in the 2007 film ''[[CJ7]]''.&lt;ref name="ChowsPlay"&gt;&lt;!--This URL should not be linked, as it appears to be copyvio, but here it is for quick reference: http://www.wu-jing.org/happenings/archives/158-Stephen-Chows-Play-CJ7.html--&gt;{{cite news |work = [[Straits Times]]|author = Boon Cheng|title = Stephen Chow's Play: CJ7|date = 6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese word 星 ''xīng'' refers both to Chow's nickname 星爷 (''Sing Yeh'', "Grandmaster Sing")&lt;ref name=dayoo/&gt; and to [[:wikt:明星|明星]], the word for a star or [[celebrity]].

Chow has not always chosen newcomer actresses to co-star with him; for example, [[Zhao Wei|Vicki Zhao]] already had a successful music and film career when she appeared as the female lead in ''[[Shaolin Soccer]]'',&lt;ref name=eastday/&gt; and [[Gong Li]] was already famous as an "Yimou girl" ([[:zh:谋女郎|谋女郎]]) for her frequent collaboration with director [[Zhang Yimou]] before she starred in two Stephen Chow films in the early 1990s. Many times, though, starring with Chow has been a "Sing girl"'s first major role and has kick-started her career, as ''[[King of Comedy (film)|King of Comedy]]'' did for [[Cecilia Cheung]]. [[Eva Huang]] and [[Kitty Zhang]] both gained considerable attention from media and [[netizens]] after appearing in ''[[Kung Fu Hustle]]'' and ''[[CJ7]]'', respectively, even though their roles were relatively small (Huang's role had no lines at all).&lt;ref name=eastday/&gt;

[[Kingdom Yuen]] appeared in numerous 1990s Stephen Chow films not as a lead female or romantic interest, but rather in minor roles as a comedic [[stock character]].&lt;ref name=kingdom&gt;{{cite web | accessdate=4 July 2009 | url=http://www.brns.com/hkactors/pages/page48.html | title=Yuen King-tan/Kingdom Yuen | work=Hong Kong Cinema: View from the Brooklyn Bridge | first=Yves | last=Gendron | date=5 October 2004}} {{Unreliable source?|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The youngest "Sing girl" is 7 year old Zhang Yuwen, who appears in ''[[Journey to the West: Conquering the Demons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hunantv.com/c/20130218/0947217139.html|title=揭秘《西游》最小星女郎 张煜雯喊星爷哥哥|publisher=Hunan TV|accessdate=2013-03-28|date=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Venice Elphi anak Danny Kaya''' (born 10 September 1984) is a [[Malaysia]]n footballer plays for [[ATM FA|Angkatan Tentera Malaysia]] in [[Malaysia FAM League]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nst.com.my/sports/soccer/let-s-salute-venice-today-1.103560&lt;/ref&gt; Venice plays as a winger. As of 2016, he is the longest serving player in the current ATM FA squad.

==Career==

===ATM FA===
Venice football career started when his talent was spotted in 2007, two years after he joined the [[Malaysian Armed Forces]] in 2005. He was selected in [[ATM FA|the armed forces football team]] starting in 2008, when ATM FA was in the second-tier [[Malaysia Premier League]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atmfa.my/news/venice-mahu-nama-terus-disebut-di-pentas-bola-sepak-negara/&lt;/ref&gt; Venice turned full-time professional with ATM FA in 2011, having played before that as a semi-professional player, combining soccer with his army duties.

Venice has won the [[2012 Malaysia Premier League]] with ATM FA, and were in the team that finished runners-up to [[Kelantan FA]] in the [[2012 Malaysia Cup]] final, the first time ATM FA qualified for the Malaysia Cup final since 1966.

2014 There's a rumour circuling around that he will be signed to play for his native Sarawak state. But it seems to be far from happened since his full time duty with atm unable to let him play for another team. Since his career with atm granted him job security even if he got injured and no longer to play anymore.

==International career==
Venice received his first call-up to the [[Malaysia national football team]] in early 2012 under [[K. Rajagopal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.atmfa.my/news/daripada-ultra-ke-harimau-malaya-pembabitan-lewat-tidak-halang-venice-cipta-nama-dalam-skuad-malaysia/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waleed Mohammed al-Shehri''' ({{lang-ar|وليد الشهري}}, {{transl|ar|''Walīd ash-Shehrī''}}, also [[Romanization of Arabic|transliterated]] as '''Alshehri''') (December 20, 1978&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/waleed_al-shehri.htm&lt;/ref&gt; – September 11, 2001) was one of five hijackers of [[American Airlines Flight 11]], which was crashed into the North Tower of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] as part of the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001.

Born in [[Saudi Arabia]], Shehri had been a student until he accompanied his mentally ill brother to [[Medina]]. He later went to fight in [[Chechnya]] along with his brother [[Wail al-Shehri|Wail]], but was redirected to [[Afghanistan]], where he was recruited for the attacks.

Shehri arrived in the United States in April 2001 on a tourist visa. On September 11, 2001, Waleed along with his brother, Wail, boarded [[American Airlines Flight 11]] and was one of five that helped hijack it, so that [[Mohamed Atta]] could fly the plane into the North Tower of the World Trade Center.

==Early life and education==
Studying to become a teacher like his brother, [[Wail al-Shehri|Wail]], Waleed al-Shehri was from [['Asir]] [[Provinces of Saudi Arabia|province]], a poor region in southwestern [[Saudi Arabia]] that borders [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=9/11 Commission Report |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch7.htm |chapter=Chapter 7.3–The Attack Looms, Assembling the Teams |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |pages=231–240 |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Shehri's family adhered to the [[Wahhabi]] school of [[Islam]], he grew up in a very conservative household. His family did not have satellite television or internet and he was forbidden to play music or have contact with girls until he was old enough for an arranged marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5bTYljW3A?url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/driving_a_wedge/part1_side.shtml |archivedate=2008-10-10 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/driving_a_wedge/part1_side.shtml |title=Before oath to jihad, drifting and boredom |author=Sennott, Charles M. |publisher=''Boston Globe'' |date=2002-03-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early media accounts said that Waleed had earned his pilot's certificate at [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miami.com/herald/special/news/worldtrade/digdocs/046328.htm |title=Hijack plotters used S.

==Career==

===2000===
Waleed left his studies to accompany his brother's [[leave of absence]] after Wail complained of a mental symptom that had caused him grief, telling their father that he intended to seek aid from a [[Faith healing|religious healer]] in [[Medina]].

The brothers arrived at the [[Al Farouq training camp]] in [[Afghanistan]], where they met [[Ahmed al-Nami]] and [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]]. Before arriving at Al-Farouq, the four reportedly pledged themselves to [[jihad]] in Spring 2000, in a ceremony presided over by Wail, who had dubbed himself ''Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi'' after one of [[Muhammad]]'s [[Sahaba|companions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/driving_a_wedge/part1_side.shtml Before oath to jihad, drifting and boredom], Boston Globe, By Charles M. Sennott, Globe Staff, 3 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Waleed later served in the security forces at [[Kandahar International Airport]] with [[Saeed al-Ghamdi]]. After being selected for the operation, he trained with the other hijackers at al-Matar complex under [[Abu Turab al-Urduni]].

Waleed returned to Saudi Arabia with his brother in the fall of 2000 so they could obtain clean passports and U.S. visas, which they did on 3 October and 24 October 2000, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/FBI911Timeline.pdf|title=Hijackers' Timeline|author=Federal Bureau of Investigation|publisher=NEFA Foundation|date=4 February 2008|accessdate=6 October 2008|pages=93; 93|format=PDF|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012013300/http://www.nefafoundation.org/miscellaneous/FeaturedDocs/FBI911Timeline.pdf|archivedate=12 October 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Locals reported that he and his brother disappeared from [[Khamis Mushayt]] in the south of Saudi Arabia in December 2000.&lt;ref name=anews01&gt;{{cite news|last=Khashoggi|first=Jamal|title=Hijacker list raises more questions|url=http://space.crono911.net/EBook/086_ArabNews_20092001.pdf|accessdate=27 June 2012|newspaper=Arab News|date=1 October 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707175116/http://space.crono911.net/EBook/086_ArabNews_20092001.pdf|archivedate=7 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-November, 2000, the 9/11 Commission believes that three of the future muscle hijackers, Wail al Shehri, Waleed al Shehri, and [[Ahmed al-Nami]], all of whom had obtained their U.S. visas in late October, traveled in a group from Saudi Arabia to [[Beirut]] and then onward to [[Iran]] where they could travel through to Afghanistan without getting their passports stamped. This probably followed their return to Saudi Arabia to get "clean" passports. An associate of a senior Hezbollah operative is thought to have been on the same flight, although this may have been a coincidence.

===2001===
After training, he would have moved to a safehouse in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]] before travelling to the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE). From the UAE, the muscle hijackers came to the U.S. between April and June 2001. Waleed may have arrived in the U.S. on 23 April 2001. Some sources report that Shehri "at times" stayed at lead hijacker [[Mohamed Atta]]'s apartment in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] at some period between 1998 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/graphics/attack/hijackers.html Four Planes, Four Coordinated Teams], Washington Post&lt;/ref&gt; Others place him with [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] in [[London]].

[[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]] says that [[Osama bin Laden]] had given a message to Waleed al Shehri for conveyance to [[Mohamed Atta]] earlier that spring, indicating that bin Laden preferred to attack the [[White House]] instead of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]].

[[Image:Waleed alshehri pic2.jpg|left|368px|thumb|Waleed al-Shehri in an undated photograph]]
On May 4, 2001, he applied for and received a [[Florida]] [[driver's license]]. The next day, he filled out a change-of-address form to receive a duplicate license.  Five other suspected hijackers also received duplicate Florida licenses in 2001. Some have speculated that this was to allow multiple persons to use the same identity.&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, Mitch. {{cite web |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-worldtrade-suspectprofiles.story |title="Multiple identities of hijack suspects confound FBI" |accessdate=2012-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604015841/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/southflorida/sfl-worldtrade-suspectprofiles.story |archivedate=June 4, 2004 |df= }}. ''South Florida Sun-Sentinel''. 28 September 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 May 2001, Shehri and [[Satam al-Suqami]] flew from [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] to [[Freeport, Bahamas]], where they had reservations at the Bahamas Princess Resort where Shehri and Suqami rented two cars, a black Buick Regal and a gray Ford Taurus. The two were turned away by Bahamian officials on arrival, however, because they lacked [[Visa (document)|visas]]; they returned to Florida that same day. The [[9/11 Commission]] felt that they likely took this trip to renew Suqami's immigration status, as Suqami's legal stay in the United States ended on 21 May 2001.

He was one of nine hijackers to open a [[SunTrust Banks|SunTrust]] bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001. While living in Boynton, neighbors reported that he seemed to be an enthusiastic fan of the [[Florida Marlins]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/09/14/archive/main311329.shtml The FBI's Hijacker List], CBS News, 27 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2001, both Wail and Waleed were staying at a hotel in [[Salou, Spain|Salou]], [[Spain]] where they were visited by [[Mohamed Atta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/news/WABC_092701_njconnection.html |title=FBI Willing To 'Work' With Detainees With Terror Plot Info |accessdate=2005-09-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030415011752/http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/news/WABC_092701_njconnection.html |archivedate=April 15, 2003 |df= }}, Newark-AP, September 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; On July 30, Shehri traveled alone from Fort Lauderdale to Boston.  He flew to [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] the next day, where he stayed one night before returning via [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].

According to librarian Kathleen Hensmen, Wail and Waleed al-Shehri used the Internet access at Delray Beach Public Library in August 2001, where they may have been looking at information on [[Aerial application|crop dusting]]; they reportedly left the library with a third Middle Eastern man thought to be [[Marwan al-Shehhi]], who Hensmen said asked her for the name of a local restaurant. {{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

On September 5, 2001, Wail and Waleed al Shehri traveled together on Delta Air Lines Flight 2462 from [[Fort Lauderdale]] to [[Boston]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Wail checked in together with Waleed at the Park Inn Hotel in [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts]] on 5 September 2001, staying in room 432.&lt;ref name="remain"&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/11/september11/main521523.shtml?CMP=ILC-SearchStories Hijackers Remain Mysterious, A Window Into Their Daily Lives Leaves Dark Questions], CBS News, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]], may have also spent a night at the Park Inn before leaving with [[Mohamed Atta]] for [[Portland, Maine]] on 10 September 2001. When they checked out, the Shehri brothers may have left a discarded sheet of instructions on how to fly a transcontinental jetliner in their hotel room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=9/11 Reminder, Park Inn, Now Being Demolished |publisher=The Boston Globe |date=17 February 2005|author=Noonan, Erica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 11 attacks===
{{Main|American Airlines Flight 11}}

Waleed al-Shehri, his brother Wail, and [[Abdulaziz al-Omari]] arrived together at [[Logan Airport]] at 06:45 on the morning of September 11, 2001, having left their Ford Focus rental car in the airport parking facility.&lt;ref name="911-ch1"&gt;{{cite book |title=9/11 Commission Report |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report_Ch1.htm |chapter=Chapter 1.1 - "We Have Some Planes", Inside the Four Flights |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon check-in, Wail al-Shehri was selected by the [[Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System]] (CAPPS), as was his brother Waleed, and Flight&amp;nbsp;11 hijacker Satam al-Suqami. [[Mohamed Atta]], the pilot hijacker on Flight&amp;nbsp;11 had also been selected in Portland.  Being selected by CAPPS meant that their checked baggage were subject to extra screening.  As the CAPPS was only for luggage, the three hijackers did not undergo any extra scrutiny at the passenger security checkpoint.&lt;ref name="staff"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_3.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Aviation Security System and the 9/11 Attacks - Staff Statement No. 3 |publisher=9/11 Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

By 7:40&amp;nbsp;a.m., all five hijackers were aboard the flight, which was scheduled to depart at 7:45&amp;nbsp;a.m. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively.&lt;ref name="911-ch1"/&gt;  The aircraft taxied away from Gate&amp;nbsp;26 and departed Logan International Airport at 7:59&amp;nbsp;a.m. from runway&amp;nbsp;4R after a 14-minute delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/packages/underattack/news/planes_reconstruction.htm |title=Probe reconstructs horror, calculated attacks on planes |last=Johnson |first=Glen |date=2001-11-23 |work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/Flight_%20Path_%20Study_AA11.pdf |format=PDF| title=Flight Path Study - American Airlines Flight 11 |publisher=[[National Transportation Safety Board]] |date=2002-02-19 |accessdate=2008-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hijacking of Flight&amp;nbsp;11 began at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to [[air traffic control]].&lt;ref name="911-ch1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ntsb" /&gt;  Once the [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacking]] began, the brothers are suspected of having stabbed two flight attendants.&lt;ref name="911-ch1"/&gt;  At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed Flight&amp;nbsp;11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower&amp;nbsp;1) of the World Trade Center.&lt;ref name="ntsb" /&gt;  The damage caused to the North Tower destroyed any means of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name="102Mins"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Dwyer |first=Jim |author2=Lipton, Eric|title=102 Minutes: Last Words at the Trade Center; Fighting to Live as the Towers Die |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E6DC153BF935A15756C0A9649C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=4 |date=2002-05-26 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=2008-05-23|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The North Tower [[collapse of the World Trade Center|collapsed]] at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.&lt;ref name="nist-ncstar1-8-p37"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wtc.nist.gov/NISTNCSTAR1-8.pdf |title=NIST NCSTAR 1-8 - The Emergency Response |author=Lawson, J.

==Aftermath==

===Reports after September 11 attacks===
On September 23, 2001 ''[[BBC News]]'' reported that al-Shehri was "alive and well" in [[Casablanca, Morocco]], and was talking to multiple media organizations;&lt;ref name=ed&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Herrmann |title=The Editors: 9/11 conspiracy theory |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/theeditors/2006/10/911_conspiracy_theory_1.html |work=BBC News |date=27 October 2006 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hijack 'suspects' alive and well |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1559151.stm |work=BBC News |date=23 September 2001 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, due to confusion over the man's identity, and editorial concerns over [[conspiracy theories]], ''BBC News'' later modified the September 23 report by inserting "A man called ... "&lt;ref name=ed/&gt; ''BBC News'' considers the September 23 report superseded by an October 5, 2001 report that lists Waleed as one of the alleged hijackers believed by the FBI to be responsible for the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref name=ed/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The investigation and the evidence |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1581063.stm |work=BBC News |date=5 October 2001 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waleed and Wail were both reported to have been initially found, in error, by a Saudi newspaper editor as the sons of Ahmed Alshehri, a senior [[Saudi]] diplomat stationed in [[Bombay]], [[India]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}  On September 16, 2001, the diplomat Ahmed Alshehri denied that he was the father of the two hijackers.  Wail claims he ''did'' attend [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]] &amp;mdash; but was the victim of mistaken identity, since he used that training to secure his current position with a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] airline company. [[Saudi Arabia]] has confirmed his story, and suggested he was the victim of [[identity theft]].

Muhammad Ali al-Shehri, the Shehri brothers' true father, was identified prior to September 17, 2001, and told Arab News that he had not heard from his sons in ten months prior to September 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=9424&amp;ArY=2001&amp;ArM=9&amp;ArD=17 |title=al-Shehri says sons missing for 10 months |accessdate=2017-09-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020929001039/http://www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=9424&amp;ArY=2001&amp;ArM=9&amp;ArD=17 |archivedate=September 29, 2002 |df= }}, By Mutlaq Al-Buqami, Arab News Staff, 17 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; An ''ABC News'' story in March 2002 repeated this, and during a report entitled "A Saudi Apology" for ''[[Dateline NBC]]'' on August 25, 2002, ''NBC'' reporter [[John Hockenberry]] traveled to 'Asir, where he interviewed the third brother, Salah, who agreed that his two brothers were dead and claimed they had been "brainwashed".

Furthermore, another article explains that the pilot who lives in Casablanca was named Walid al-Shri (not Waleed M. al-Shehri) and that much of the ''BBC'' information regarding "alive" hijackers was incorrect according to the same sources used by ''BBC''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,265160-2,00.html Panoply of the Absurd (2)], Spiegel Online, September 8, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2007, a video recording of his last [[Will (law)|testament]] was released to mark the 6th anniversary of the attacks.

{{Chinese name|[[Wei (surname)|Wei]]}}

'''Wei Guoqing''' ({{zh|s=韦国清|t=韋國清|p=Wéi Guóqīng}}; [[Zhuang language|Zhuang:]] Veiz Gozcing) (2 September 1913 &amp;ndash; 14 June 1989) was a Chinese government official, military officer and political commissar. He served on the [[Communist Party of China]]'s [[Politburo]] (1973–1982) and as Director of the [[People's Liberation Army]]'s [[People's Liberation Army General Political Department|General Political Department]] (1977–1982). Wei was one of the few members of the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committees]] (1969–1987) and the 10th through 12th politburos not purged during the [[Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution]] (GPCR) or [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s backlash.&lt;ref&gt;The others were Marshall Ye Jianying, General Xu Shiyou, economist Li Xiannian, and "mass" representative Ni Zhifu&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a Vice Chair of the [[National People's Congress]] Standing Committee (1975–1989) and of the [[Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference]] (1964–1983).

Wei was born in [[Donglan]], [[Guangxi]], to a poor [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] minority family.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial Board, ''Who's Who in China Current Leaders'' (Foreign Languages Press: Beijing, 1989), {{ISBN|0-8351-2352-9}}), pp.728-729&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[Chinese Red Army]] at the age of 16 (1929) and the CPC in 1931. He rose to the rank of battalion commander in the Seventh Army under Deng Xiaoping and was a regimental commander on the [[Long March]]. After the Long March he served in the 344th Brigade, and then marched south under [[Huang Kecheng]]'s 5th Column in January 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Whitson, William and Huang Chen-hsia, ''The Chinese High Command: A History of Chinese Military Politics, 1927–71'' (Praeger Publishers: New York, 1973), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1944, he commanded the 4th Division of the [[New Fourth Army]], and later three columns (the 2nd, 10th and 12th) of the [[North Jiangsu Army]] in the [[Huai-Hai Campaign]]. In 1948, Wei held off the Nationalist 2nd Army Corps of Qiu Qingquan and  100 tanks of the 5th Corps under the command of Jiang Weiguo ([[Chiang Wei-kuo]], Chiang Kai-shek's son) in a decisive delaying action in the Huai-Hai Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Whitson, pp. 197-198.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Wei was deputy political commissar of General [[Ye Fei]]'s Tenth Army Group of the [[Third Field Army]].

==Vietnam==
Wei was deeply involved in China's relations with North Vietnam from 1950. In April of that year, [[Liu Shaoqi]] sent him to Vietnam as head of the Chinese Military Advisory Group, to advise  [[Ho Chi Minh]] on fighting the French;&lt;ref&gt;Li Xiaobing, ''A history of the modern Chinese Army'' (University Press of Kentucky, 2007), {{ISBN|0-8131-2438-7}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8131-2438-4}}  p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; Wei remained in Vietnam until September 1955. In this role he led a group of 281 experienced military officers from the [[Second Field Army|Second]], Third and [[Fourth Field Armies]] in a mission that began within days of the outbreak of the [[Korean War]]. Wei's work across Field Army lines would stand him in good stead later in his career. General [[Chen Geng]] joined the CMAG in July as the representative of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], but left for Korea in November, leaving Wei as the senior Chinese official in Vietnam.

In October 1953, Wei reportedly personally gave [[Ho Chi Minh]] a copy of the French Navarre plan.&lt;ref&gt;Qiang Zhai, ''China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950–1975'' (UNC Press, 2000) {{ISBN|0-8078-4842-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8078-4842-5}} p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Việt Minh pushed on to Lai Châu and toward northern Laos, rather than the [[Red River Delta]]. Some months later, in 1954, Wei is said to have advised General [[Võ Nguyên Giáp]] to surround and attack General Navarre at [[Dien Bien Phu]], a strategy that eventually led to complete French withdrawal from Indochina.

In June 1954, Wei attended the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina  with Premier [[Zhou Enlai]], USSR Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], Vietnamese representative [[Phạm Văn Đồng]], US State Department official [[Walter Bedell Smith|Bedell Smith]] and UK Deputy Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs for Administration [[Anthony Eden]]. Wei was specifically instructed to discuss military matters with the Vietnamese delegation when Molotov, Smith and Eden were not present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/index.cfm?topic_id=1409&amp;fuseaction=va2.document&amp;identifier=66FECF70-ACAE-E1F0-C2BF6B5E27E0487D&amp;sort=Collection&amp;item=1954+Geneva+Conference+on+Indochina|title=Cold War International History Project|date=31 March 2011|publisher=|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wei, Pham, Ho, General Giap and others went to Nanning, Guangxi, in late June 1954 to discuss strategy for Indochina.

When formal military ranks were introduced in 1955, Wei Guoqing was made a general, and in 1956 became an Alternate Member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]] at the [[Eighth National Party Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who'', p. 729.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guangxi and Guangdong==
After returning to China, Wei moved to Nanning, Guangxi, where he was the senior party (1961-GPCR) and government (1955-GPCR) official in Guangxi Autonomous Region for an unusually long period. It was from Guangxi and Yunnan that Chinese troops entered Vietnam in 1965–70.&lt;ref&gt;Li Xiaobing, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his role as the senior-most official in Guangxi, Wei hosted the January 1958 Nanning Conference, attended by Chairman [[Mao Zedong]] and most of the very top leadership.&lt;ref&gt;Teiwes, Frederick C. and Sun, Warren, ''China's road to disaster: Mao, central politicians, and provincial leaders in the unfolding of the great leap forward, 1955–1959'' (M.E. Sharpe, 1999) {{ISBN|0-7656-0201-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7656-0201-5}}, pp. 234-235.&lt;/ref&gt; While Wei was a junior among the heavyweights, he was present at one of the decisive [[Great Leap Forward]] discussions where outrageous targets were approved.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alfred L.,  ''Mao's crusade: politics and policy implementation in China's great leap forward'' (Oxford University Press, 2001), {{ISBN|0-19-924406-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-924406-5}}  p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

General Wei was named 1st Political Commissar of the [[Guangxi Military District]] (MD) in January 1964, a post he held until October 1975. He added the leadership of the CPC committee in February 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Malcolm, ''Directory of Officials and Organizations in China: 1968–83'' (M.E. Sharpe, Inc: Armonk, 1983) {{ISBN|0-87332-277-0}} ( pp. 502-503&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Cultural Revolution, Wei managed to keep control of Guangxi. In March 1967, Zhou Enlai ordered the establishment of the "Guangxi Revolutionary Preparatory Group", headed by incumbent CPC 1st Party Secretary Wei. However, Wei was beaten by a Guangxi-origin mob in August while visiting Beijing. In 1968, the "Guangxi April 22 Revolutionary Action Command" opposed  Wei Guoqing's leadership while the "Guangxi United Command of Proletarian Revolutionaries" supported him.&lt;ref&gt;MacFarquhar, Roderick and Schoenhals, Michael, ''Mao's last revolution'' (Harvard University Press, 2006), {{ISBN|0-674-02332-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-674-02332-1}},  p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; After the PLA backers of the former group were transferred to Beijing, Wei launched an artillery bombardment on parts of the city controlled by his opponents. The resulting conflict saw the destruction of some 166 boats on the Nanning river,  and dozens of buildings. The results were endorsed by the faction in charge in Beijing. He was named Chairman of the Guangxi Revolutionary Committee in August 1968, and remained in that post, and the province, until October 1975.

As concerns about Marshall [[Lin Biao]]'s loyalties began to arise, Mao Zedong in August 1971 met with regional leaders in Changsha, including [[Hua Guofeng]], and Wei to criticize Lin; and in Nanchang with Xu Shiyou and [[Han Xianchu]].

==Central Leadership==
In December 1973, Wei was named 1st Political Commissar of the [[Guangzhou Military Region]] (MR), a post he held until the end of 1978. The MR Commander, General [[Xu Shiyou]], was an old ally of Deng Xiaoping and together they sheltered him from the Gang of Four after the April 1976 Tiananmen Incident and Deng's third purge.

In the post-Mao reshuffle, General Wei took over the PLA [[People's Liberation Army General Political Department|General Political Department]] (GPD) from Gang of Four member Zhang Chunqiao, thus becoming the political commissar for the entire People's Liberation Army. He was also named to the 11th Central Committee Politburo, in 1977. Wei served in the GPD and Deputy Secretary-General and Standing Committee member of the CPC [[Military Affairs Commission]], 1977–82.

Wei's old Guangzhou MR partner, General Xu Shiyou, took overall commend (along with General Yang Dezhi) of the Chinese invasion of Vietnam in February 1979. However, General Wei does not appear to have had a direct role in the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]], possibly due to his close workings with the Vietnamese in the 1950s and 1960s.

In August 1982, Liberation Army Daily, the newspaper directly under General Political Department Director Wei's authority, published a broadside against "bourgeois liberalization" that was seen as an attack on Deng Xiaoping's policies just prior to the 12thParty Congress. As a result, Wei was dismissed, and replaced by General Yu Qiuli.&lt;ref&gt;Lampton, David M., Paths to Power: Elite Mobility in Contemporary China (Michigan Monographs in Chinese Studies, Volume 55, The University of Michigan Center for Chinese Studies, Ann Arbor 1986), {{ISBN|0-89264-064-2}}, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;
