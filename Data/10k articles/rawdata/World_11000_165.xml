      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1554">'''Alruna''' ([[Old Norse]] '''Ölrún''', [[Old High German]] '''Ailrun''', Modern German '''Alruna''', '''[[Alraune]]''') is a Germanic female personal name, from [[Proto Germanic]] ''*aliruna'' (or possibly ''*agilruna''), which is formed from ''[[rune|runa]]'' "secret, rune" and a debated prefix that may be ''ali-'', ''agil-'', or ''[[Alu (runic)|alu-]]''.

In German, ''Alruna'' was also used as a short form of ''Adelruna'', a different name with a first element ''*athal-'' "noble".

In [[Germanic mythology]], Ailrun is the wife of [[Agilaz]], the legendary archer. In the poem ''[[Völundarkviða]]'', '''Ölrun''' (possibly [[Old Norse]] "ale rune"&lt;ref name=SIMEK251&gt;Simek (2007:251).&lt;/ref&gt;) is identified as a [[valkyrie]], and as a daughter of [[Kiár]] of [[Valland]].

[[Alruna of Cham]] was an 11th-century [[Bavaria]]n recluse, the [[Roman Catholic]] patroness of pregnancy. It is also the name for the ''[[Mandragora (genus)|Mandragora]]'' or mandrake plant in a number of [[Germanic languages]], the name of the plant being '''alruna''' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], '''alrune''' in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] and '''[[Alraune]]''' in [[German language|German]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25659">The '''Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative''' ('''BFHI'''), also known as '''Baby Friendly Initiative''' ('''BFI'''), is a worldwide programme of the [[World Health Organization]] and [[UNICEF]], launched in 1991&lt;ref name="UNICEF"&gt;UNICEF.

[http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/bfhi/en/ Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative.] Accessed 4 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; following the adoption of the ''Innocenti Declaration'' on [[breastfeeding promotion]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. [http://www.unicef.org/programme/breastfeeding/innocenti.htm INNOCENTI DECLARATION on the Protection, Promotion and Support of Breastfeeding.] Adopted at the WHO/UNICEF meeting on "Breastfeeding in the 1990s: A Global Initiative", held at the Spedale degli Innocenti, Florence, Italy, 30 July-1 August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative is a global effort for improving the role of maternity services to enable mothers to [[breastfeeding|breastfeed]] babies for the best start in life. It aims at improving the care of pregnant women, mothers and newborns at [[health care provider|health facilities]] that provide maternity services for protecting, promoting and supporting breastfeeding, in accordance with the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes|International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlineprograms.sacredheart.edu/resource/nursing/nurses-on-breastfeeding-best-practices |title=Breastfeeding Initiation at BFI Hospitals

UNICEF, the World Health Organization, and many national government health agencies recommend that babies are [[Breastfeeding#Exclusive breastfeeding|breastfed exclusively]] for their first six months of life. Studies have shown that breastfed babies are less likely to suffer from serious illnesses, including [[gastroenteritis]], [[asthma]], [[eczema]], and respiratory and ear infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/tp/brfouttp.htm |title=Breastfeeding and Maternal and Infant Health Outcomes in Developed Countries |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research &amp; Quality |date=2012-12-06 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greer|first=F.

There are benefits for mothers too: women who don't breastfeed have increased risk of developing heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, [[breast cancer]], [[ovarian cancer]] and hip fractures in later life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Breastfeeding during infancy and the risk of cardiovascular disease in adulthood|journal=Epidemiology|date=1 September 2004|volume=15|issue=5|pages=550–556|pmid=15308954|doi=10.1097/01.ede.0000129513.69321.ba|author=Rich-Edwards JW, Stampfer MJ, Manson JE, Rosner B, Hu FB, Michels KB, Willett WC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard M.

==Criteria==
The criteria for a hospital's Baby Friendly accreditation include:
#Have a written breastfeeding [[health policy|policy]] that is routinely communicated to all health care staff. 
#Train all health care staff in skills necessary to implement this policy. 
#Inform all pregnant women about the benefits and management of breastfeeding. 
#Help mothers initiate breastfeeding within one half-hour of birth. 
#Show mothers how to breastfeed and maintain lactation, even if they should be separated from their infants. 
#Give newborn infants no food or drink other than breastmilk, not even sips of water, unless medically indicated. 
#Practice rooming in - that is, allow mothers and infants to remain together 24 hours a day. 
#Encourage breastfeeding on demand. 
#Give no artificial teats or pacifiers (also called dummies or soothers) to breastfeeding infants. 
#Foster the establishment of breastfeeding support groups and refer mothers to them on discharge from the hospital or clinic.

The program also restricts use by the hospital of free [[infant formula|formula]] or other infant care aids provided by formula companies and recommends that when formula is medically needed, it should be given in a small cup or spoon, rather than a bottle and should only be used to supplement breastfeeding.

Since the program's inception, approximately 15,000 facilities in more than 152 countries have been inspected and accredited as "Baby-Friendly."&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WHO"/&gt;

==Recommended alternatives==
The World Health Organization recommends that if a mother is unable to breastfeed, chooses not to breastfeed, or if her baby (often premature) shows signs that it isn't getting enough breast-milk, a healthy [[wet nurse]] or [[milk bank|milk from a donor]] is a healthy alternative to formula.&lt;ref name="Preterm"&gt;{{cite web|title=What if a baby is born preterm and cannot breastfeed? |url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/child/nutrition/hivif_qa/what_if/q66/en/|publisher=World Health Organisation |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A special formula is manufactured for premature babies, although the World Health Organization recommends it only if breast-milk is medically not an option such as if a premature baby has to be fed formula through a tube to maintain a healthy weight.&lt;ref name="Preterm" /&gt; The World Health Organization advocates the importance of a baby being close to its mother whenever possible even if the mother does not breastfeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Feeding in exceptionally difficult circumstances |url=http://www.who.int/maternal_child_adolescent/topics/child/nutrition/fiedc/en/ |publisher=World Health Organisation |accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regional schemes==

===Canada===
In Canada, the provinces of [[Quebec]] and [[New Brunswick]] have mandated the implementation of the BFHI. All public health units in Ontario have been required to work towards having BFI designation since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/push-on-for-more-baby-friendly-hospitals-support-for-breastfeeding-key-component/article10603863/ |title=Push on for more baby-friendly hospitals, support for breastfeeding key component |first=Sheryl |last=Ubelacker |work=Globe and Mail |date=1 April 2013 |accessdate=21 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care in Ontario added BFI status to their progress indicators for Public Health Units  thus requiring all Public Health Units in Ontario to begin implementation of BFI.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Document:Public Health Accountability Agreement Indicators 2011-13 Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care Public Health Division Health Promotion Division {{cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/performance/docs/technical_document.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203093114/http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/pro/programs/publichealth/performance/docs/technical_document.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other provinces and territories are implementing strategies at regional and local levels.&lt;ref&gt;Breastfeeding Committee for Canada.

Women’s Hospital and Health Centre has been recognized as a breast-feeding and “baby-friendly” hospital by the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF since 2008.

===China===
China, now has more than 6,000 Baby-Friendly Hospitals, exclusive breastfeeding in rural areas rose from 29 per cent in 1992 to 68 per cent in 1994; in urban areas, the increase was from 10 per cent to 48 per cent.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt;

===Cuba===
In Cuba, 49 of the country's 56 hospitals and maternity facilities have been designated as "baby-friendly". In the six years following the initiation of the BFHI program, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at four months almost tripled - from 25 per cent in 1990 to 72 per cent in 1996.&lt;ref name="UNICEF"/&gt;

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong several hospitals have shown interest in being designated  Baby Friendly. However, only [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital (Hong Kong)|Queen Elizabeth Hospital]] has advanced past the Award of Level 2 Participation stage and is well on its way to receiving BFHI accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Healthcare Facilities|url=http://www.babyfriendly.org.hk/en/to-become-baby-friendly/healthcare-facilities/|accessdate=3 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The BFHI started in Ireland in 1998 under the auspices of the Irish Health Promoting Hospitals Network (a WHO programme). The BFHI in Ireland became an independent registered charity in mid-2016 and changed their name to Baby Friendly Health Initiative. They offer two levels - a participation or membership level in which maternity facilities are encouraged to implement the standards and network with other maternity facilities but with no external assessment process, and the designation level where there is external assessment and on-going monitoring to ensure the standards are met and sustained.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.babyfriendly.ie/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
Sweden is considered the global leader in terms of BFHI implementation: four years after the programme was introduced in 1993, all of the then 65 maternity centres in the country had been designated "baby-friendly".&lt;ref&gt;Hofvander Y. [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb02038.x/abstract "Breastfeeding and the Baby Friendly Hospitals Initiative (BFHI): Organization, response and outcome in Sweden and other countries."] ''Acta Paediatrica'', 94(8): 1012–1016, August 2005. {{doi|10.1111/j.1651-2227.2005.tb02038.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
In 2014 78.60% of babies were born in BFHI hospitals. Between 2001 and 2013, the increase in certified hospitals  was from 38 to 176.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Gender Dimension of the MDGs in R. O. C. (Taiwan)|url=http://www.globalgender.org/en-global/status_page/index/8|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The [[UNICEF UK]] Baby Friendly Initiative was launched in the United Kingdom in 1995.&lt;ref name="UK history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org.uk/BabyFriendly/About-Baby-Friendly/What-is-the-Baby-Friendly-Initiative/History-of-Baby-Friendly-in-the-UK/ |title=About Baby Friendly: All about us: History of Baby Friendly in the UK |publisher=UNICEF UK |accessdate=24 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912005139/http://www.unicef.org.uk/BabyFriendly/About-Baby-Friendly/What-is-the-Baby-Friendly-Initiative/History-of-Baby-Friendly-in-the-UK/ |archivedate=12 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Initiative works with the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) to ensure a high standard of care for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers and babies in [[hospital]]s and community health settings. The Baby Friendly Initiative accredits health-care facilities that adopt internationally recognised best practice standards for breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-UK"&gt;UNICEF UK. [http://www.unicef.org.uk/BabyFriendly/About-Baby-Friendly/What-is-the-Baby-Friendly-Initiative/ What is the Baby Friendly Initiative?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727200512/http://www.unicef.org.uk/BabyFriendly/About-Baby-Friendly/What-is-the-Baby-Friendly-Initiative/ |date=2011-07-27 }} Accessed 4 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; During each stage of accreditation, the Initiative provides support as facilities implement standards relating to policies and procedures, staff education, effective auditing, educating pregnant women and mothers, and other relevant areas.

In 1998, its principles were extended to cover the work of community health-care services with the ''Seven Point Plan for the Promotion, Protection and Support of Breastfeeding in Community Health Care Settings''.&lt;ref name="UNICEF-UK"/&gt; In 2005, it introduced an accreditation programme for university departments responsible for midwifery, health visitor and [[nursing#Public health nursing|public health nurse]] education.  This ensures that newly qualified midwives and health visitors are equipped with the basic knowledge and skills they need to support breastfeeding effectively. The program's emphasis on applying the standards in post-natal and education settings makes it unique amongst the various Baby Friendly programmes in other countries.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

There are now 52 Baby Friendly-accredited maternity hospitals in the UK and ten accredited community health-care providers.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} It has been estimated that if all babies were breastfed, over £35m would be saved by the NHS in England and Wales each year in treating gastroenteritis alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babyfriendly.org.uk/pdfs/local_authority_approach.pdf |title=Local Authority Approach |work=UK Baby Friendly Initiative |publisher=UNICEF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, breastfeeding rates in the UK are amongst the lowest in Europe: 78 per cent of babies born in the UK are breastfed at birth, falling to 63 per cent at one week. Only one in five babies still receives breastmilk at six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/breastfeed2005 |title=Infant Feeding Survey - 2005, Early results |publisher=Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre |date=2006-05-19 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Department of Health awarded a total of £4 million to 40 [[NHS primary care trust|Primary Care Trust]]s in areas with low rates of breastfeeding to support them in seeking Baby Friendly accreditation.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

By the end of 2013 the success of the initiative in Scotland meant that 90% of Scottish mothers now give birth in a UNICEF-accredited Baby Friendly hospital. This compares with 30% of mothers in England, 58% for Wales and 57% in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.unicef.org.uk/Media-centre/Press-releases-archive/More-Scottish-women-give-birth-in-UNICEF-UK-accredited-hospitals-than-in-rest-of-UK-leading-to-more-mothers-successfully-starting-to-breastfeed-their-babies/ |title=More Scottish women give birth in UNICEF UK accredited hospitals than in rest of UK, leading to more mothers successfully starting to breastfeed their babies |publisher=UNICEF |date=27 November 2013 |accessdate=7 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420183341/http://www.unicef.org.uk/Media-centre/Press-releases-archive/More-Scottish-women-give-birth-in-UNICEF-UK-accredited-hospitals-than-in-rest-of-UK-leading-to-more-mothers-successfully-starting-to-breastfeed-their-babies/ |archivedate=20 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The first hospitals verified as Baby-Friendly in the USA were on the Pacific coast. Among the earliest, if not the first US hospital to receive this designation was Evergreen Hospital Medical Center, in Kirkland, WA, which was certified in September 1996. All of these early adopters were able to achieve 100% breastfeeding initiation rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/116/3/628.full.pdf+html |title=Breastfeeding Rates in US Baby-Friendly Hospitals: Results of a National Survey |journal=Pediatrics |date=September 2005 |volume=116 |issue=3 |doi=10.1542/peds.2004-1636 |pages=628–634 |pmid=16140702 |author=Merewood A, Mehta SD, Chamberlain LB, Philipp BL, Bauchner H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, the [[New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation#Awards and grants|Harlem Hospital Center]] was the first hospital to receive the "Baby Friendly" certification granted by Baby-Friendly USA for the city in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/hhc/html/newsletter/safety-200807-baby-friendly.shtml |title=Baby-Friendly Harlem Hospital |publisher=HHC Today |date=July 2008 |accessdate=2013-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203025256/http://www.nyc.gov/html/hhc/html/newsletter/safety-200807-baby-friendly.shtml |archivedate=2013-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, New York University Langone Medical Center became the second hospital to receive the Baby-Friendly Hospital designation in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nursing.med.nyu.edu/news/2011/nyu-langone-medical-center-awarded-official-baby-friendly-usa-designation |title=NYU Langone Medical Center Awarded Official Baby-Friendly USA Designation |publisher=NYU Langone Medical Center |year=2011 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of May 2, 2018, the United States only had 512 hospitals that hold the Baby-Friendly designation.  This translates to 24.57% of annual births occurring in a Baby-Friendly hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.babyfriendlyusa.org/|website=Baby-Friendly USA|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mothers in the United States face prejudice regarding breastfeeding their children.  The US Surgeon General reported in 2001 that 57% of U.S. adults believe that a woman should not be allowed to breastfeed in public places and not all states protect women from being charged with public indecency for breastfeeding in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danawi|first1=H|last2=Estrada|first2=L|last3=Hasbini|first3=T|last4=Wilson|first4=D|title=Health inequalities and breastfeeding in the united states of america|journal=International Journal of Childbirth Education|date=2016|volume=31|issue=1|pages=35-39}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A study conducted by Bartick and Reinhold, determined that $10.5 billion US dollars could be saved if 80% of families in the United States were able to meet current recommendations for exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, that cost-savings jumps to $13 billion saved if 90% of families comply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ma|first1=P|last2=Brewer-Asling|first2=M|last3=Magnus|first3=J.H.|title=A Case Study on the Economic Impact of Optimal Breastfeeding|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|date=2012|volume=17|issue=1|pages=9-13|doi=10.1007/s10995-011-0942-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lower income households are often eligible for Medicaid and WIC, by breastfeeding, these agencies have been estimated to save $478 during the first six months of the infant’s life for each infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Montgomery|first1=D.L.|last2=Splett|first2=P.L.|title=Economic Benefit of Breast-Feeding Infants Enrolled in WIC|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=1997|volume=97|issue=4|pages=379-385|doi=10.1016/s0002-8223(97)00094-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also shown a positive correlation of breastfeeding with increased professional education of care providers.&lt;ref name="CDC_Breatfeeeing_Guide"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Center for Disease Control and Prevention | date=2013 | title = Strategies to Prevent Obesity and Other Chronic Diseases: The CDC Guide to Strategies to Support Breastfeeding Mothers and Babies|url=https://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/pdf/bf-guide-508.pdf | journal=US Department of Health and Human Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; 86% of Americans rely on professional healthcare providers like doctors, midwives, and nurses for medical advice and recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fox|first=S|last2=Jones|first2=S | name-list-format = vanc |date=2009|title=The social life of health information|url=|journal=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project|location=Washington DC|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classes are then offered in group and individual settings as "low-intensity intervention" directed by trained medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/elena/bbc/breastfeeding_education/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Breastfeeding education for increased breastfeeding duration|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted at large healthcare institutions in Massachusetts has demonstrated a statistically significant increase in breastfeeding rates for mothers who participate in breastfeeding and lactation training.&lt;ref name="Grossman_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grossman X, Chaudhuri J, Feldman-Winter L, Abrams J, Newton KN, Philipp BL, Merewood A | title = Hospital Education in Lactation Practices (Project HELP): does clinician education affect breastfeeding initiation and exclusivity in the hospital? | journal = Birth | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–9 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19278384 | doi = 10.1111/j.1523-536X.2008.00295.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
One group of authors had concerns, published in October 2016. It questioned whether full compliance with the ten steps of the initiative might inadvertently lead to the promotion of potentially hazardous practices and/or counterproductive outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bass|first1=Joel L, et al.|title=Unintended Consequences of Current Breastfeeding Initiatives|url=http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2546142|journal=JAMA Pediatrics|accessdate=15 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Brīvā Latvija''''' (Free Latvia; {{ISSN|0934-6759}}) is a weekly newspaper for [[Latvian people|Latvians]] living outside [[Latvia]], aimed mainly at those residing in western Europe. It was founded in 1986 through the merger of two [[émigré]] newspapers: the UK-based ''Londonas Avīze'' (London News; founded 1942) and ''Latvija'' (Latvia; founded 1946 in postwar [[Displaced person|DP]] camps), based in [[West Germany]]. ''BL'' is co-owned by the Latvian communities of western Europe. The Latvian communities in Britain, Germany, and Sweden each provide members for the newspaper's board. In the mid-1990s, after Latvia regained its independence, the printing of ''BL'' was moved for economic reasons to [[Riga]], where the editorial office also later moved.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2270">The '''Chernobyl Shelter Fund''' (CSF) was set up in December 1997 with the purpose of funding the Shelter Implementation Plan (SIP). The aim of the fund is to create conditions for the dismantling and decomposition of the radiation contaminated structures. At the end of the eight- to nine-year project, estimated to cost US$768 million, the Shelter will be transformed into a stable and environmentally safe system for an estimated 100 years. The most visible aspect of this transformation will be the construction of the [[New Safe Confinement]]. The [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] (EBRD) was entrusted with managing the CSF.

==Foundation and Members==
The initiative for the establishment of the CSF has been led by G7 governments, the European Commission and Ukraine and was announced at the 1997 G7 summit in Denver. The following countries are contributors to CSF: [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Ireland]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Ukraine]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[United States]].&lt;ref name="EBRD web site"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebrd.com/what-we-do/sectors/nuclear-safety/chernobyl-shelter-fund.html|title=European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|publisher=European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides member countries, the following countries made donation: [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Croatia]], [[Estonia]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[South Korea]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Lithuania]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Slovak Republic]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Turkey]].

'''''Frühschoppen''''' (pronounced {{IPA|[fʁyːʃɔpm]}}, meaning: an alcoholic drink before midday in company) is the [[Germany|German]] and [[Austria]]n tradition of meeting up at a pub, inn or tavern in the late morning, usually on Sundays. The specific customs vary from region to region. ''Frühschoppen'' is often a kind of [[brunch]], but does not necessarily involve food. Frühschoppen is also often held at fun fairs, the most famous being [[Oktoberfest]] or [[Cannstatter Volksfest]].

In [[Lower Bavaria]] and most of [[Upper Bavaria]], ''Frühschoppen'' is understood to be a specific kind of brunch consisting of [[Weisswurst]], sweet mustard, [[pretzel]]s, and [[Weissbier]] (an unfiltered wheat beer). The Bavarian ''Frühschoppen'' began in rural areas and has originally taken place on Sundays in a tavern at the regulars' table (''[[Stammtisch]]''). During ''Frühschoppen'', folk may discuss everyday life and politics. In the corner of the tavern or festival tent (''Festzelt'') there is typically a band playing [[Volksmusik]]. (Nowadays some places have pop, rock, and jazz bands.)

In many other regions of Germany, ''Frühschoppen'' is understood more generally to be a gathering in a pub on Sunday morning, traditionally held after church service. This usually includes the consumption of alcoholic beverages, but not necessarily that of a meal. With the decline of [[church attendance]] in Germany this tradition has become somewhat less common, but is still held up in many places, especially in rural areas.

'''Halmahera''', formerly known as '''Jilolo''', '''Gilolo''', or '''Jailolo''', is the largest [[island]] in the [[Maluku Islands]].  It is part of the [[North Maluku]] [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Indonesia]] and [[Sofifi]], the capital of the province, is located on the west coast of the island.

Halmahera has a land area of {{cvt|17780|km2}}, it is the largest island of Indonesia outside the 5-main islands. It has population in 1995 of 162,728, it has increased to 449,938 for the island itself (excluding the tip which is considered part of the Joronga Islands, but including [[Gebe]] and Ju islands) and 667,161 for the island group (including all of South Halmahera and [[Tidore]], but not [[Ternate]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/indonesia-admin.php|title=Indonesia: Administrative Division (Provinces, Regencies and Cities) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map|author=|date=|website=www.citypopulation.de|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.halmaheraselatankab.go.id/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=152:penduduk-halsel&amp;catid=62:penduduk&amp;Itemid=41&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately half of the island's inhabitants are [[Islam in Indonesia|Muslim]] and half are [[Christianity in Indonesia|Christian]].

==History==
[[File:Natives of Halmahera Island.jpg|left|upright|thumb|A [[Togutil people|Togutil]] man of Halmahera island]]

Sparsely-populated Halmahera's fortunes have long been closely tied to those of the smaller islands of [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]], both off its west coast. These islands were both the sites of major kingdoms in the era before [[Dutch East India Company]] [[colonialism|colonized]] the entire archipelago.

During [[World War II]], Halmahera was the site of a [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] naval base at [[Kao, Indonesia|Kao]] Bay.

In 1999 and 2000 Halmahera was the site of violence that began as a purely ethnic dispute between residents of (mainly Christian) [[Kao, Indonesia|Kao]] and (entirely Muslim) Malifut sub-districts and then took on a religious nature as it spread through much of the North Moluccas, called the [[Maluku sectarian conflict]]. Thousands of people on Halmahera were killed in the fighting between religious militias. In June 2000, about five hundred people were killed when a [[ferry]] carrying [[refugee]]s from the fighting on Halmahera sank off the northeast tip of [[Sulawesi]] island. Conspiracy theories about this event abound. A memorial to this tragedy can be found in Duma village in North Halmahera district.

Today, much transportation to the rest of Indonesia is through connections on the provincial capital, [[Ternate]] island although [[Tobelo]], the largest town on Halmahera, also has direct ferry and cargo sea links to [[Surabaya]] and [[Manado]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Particularly since the inauguration of the first ever directly elected [[Bupati]] (Regent or District Head), Tobelo is undergoing rapid development and is aiming at rivaling Ternate's historical dominance.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} As it is surrounded by flat land, Tobelo has the potential for expansion.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} Ternate is limited by its size, being a small island which can be driven around in forty-five minutes. Also, in 2010 the provincial government has moved the provincial capital from Ternate City to [[Sofifi]], a small village on the Halmahera coast opposite [[Tidore]] island.

North Maluku Province consists of seven regencies and two municipalities, 6 of which include a part of Halmahera island. The regencies are: [[North Halmahera]], [[West Halmahera]], East Halmahera, Central Halmahera, South Hamahera, Ternate Municipality, Tidore City and Islands, [[Morotai]] and [[Sula Islands]]. Only Ternate Municipality, Morotai and Sula Islands do not include any part of Halmahera.

==Geology==
[[File:Halmahera Topography.png|thumb|upright]]

The volcanic island lies on an [[island arc]] that includes the [[Raja Ampat Islands]], all uplifted by the northward migration of the [[Australia (continent)|continent of Australia]] and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]]. [[Dukono]] is an active volcano at the north end of the island. [[Mount Ibu]] is an active volcano on the island's northwest coast.

==Natural history==
[[File:Semioptera wallacei by Bowdler Sharpe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''[[Semioptera wallacei]]'' by [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe]] (1847-1909)]]
The [[flightless]] [[invisible rail]] is [[endemic]] to the island.&lt;ref name=IUCN&gt;{{IUCN|id=22692781 |title=''Habroptila wallacii'' |assessor=BirdLife International |assessor-link=BirdLife International |version=2013.2 |year=2012 |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] visited Halmahera, as described in his 1869 book ''[[The Malay Archipelago]]''. He considered the [[standardwing]] [[Bird-of-paradise|bird of paradise]], ''Semioptera wallacei'', to be his greatest prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Halmahera and Wallace’s Greatest Prize: The Standardwing Bird of Paradise |url=http://wallacefund.info/halmahera-and-wallace-s-greatest-prize-standardwing-bird-paradise |publisher=Wallace Fund |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was here, in February &lt;!-- Was Wallace still alive in 1958? --&gt; between the bouts of fever, that a suffering Wallace came to the idea of the natural selection via the survival of the fittest. Wallace wrote his ideas during the next couple of days, and sent the historical letter to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]].

==Mining==
[[File:Rig Crew on Halmahera Island.jpg|right|thumb|A rig crew looking for minerals]]

Halmahera is the site of several [[mining]] projects.

PT Weda Bay Nickel operates a nickel and cobalt mining project in North and Central Halmahera Regencies. Backed by the [[Eramet]] corporation, the project is currently in the planning and exploration stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miga.org/documents/WedaBay_ESRS.pdf|title=MIGA Environmental and Social Review Summary: Weda Bay Nickel Mine Project – Exploration and Feasibility Phase|author=|date=|website=miga.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Harold E. "Tommy" Thompson''' (1921 &amp;ndash; October 29, 2003&lt;ref name=PT&gt;{{cite news |title=Hobart record setter |author=Ruth Ann Krause |newspaper=[[Post-Tribune]] |date=December 9, 2003 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1N1-1004023A90DD5A5A.html}} (Highbeam subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;) of [[Hobart, Indiana]], was a [[helicopter]] aviation pioneer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1949/05/07/archives/helicopter-sets-mark-averages-12275-miles-an-hour-over-a-100.html|title=HELICOPTER SETS MARK; Averages 122.75 Miles an Hour Over a 100 Kilometres|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-01-23|last=|first= | date=1949-05-07}} (''New York Times'' subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first man to intentionally loop a helicopter, set three international helicopter speed records, and was the first man to land a helicopter in the courtyard of [[The Pentagon]].  Thompson was a veteran of 3,500 hours in single-engine propeller fixed-wing [[aircraft]] and 3000 more in helicopters.

== Life ==
Having spent two years at [[Purdue University]], Thompson was called up into the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in 1943, a week after he had married his childhood sweetheart, Carolyn Kramer.&lt;ref name=PT/&gt; Thompson served as a [[P-47]] instructor at [[Moore Field]] in [[Mission, Texas]] until January 1945, when he earned an assignment to the Army's first helicopter class at [[Chanute Field]], Illinois. Later, he was assigned to the [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]], plant of [[Igor Sikorsky]], who pioneered helicopters in America.

After the war, "Tommy" as he was known, got a job as one – and with 28 the youngest – of [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky]]'s three test pilots&lt;ref name=PT/&gt;—in the trial and error days.  The plant produced six helicopters a month, mostly hand built.  Engineers tinkered with new designs, and the test pilots tried them out.  Most of the early models had slow, sluggish controls - some flew as expected, but others didn't.  Thompson was also Igor Sikorsky's personal pilot.  By 1949, Thompson was an experienced helicopter pilot.  He had been through some forced landings and crashes, but had not been seriously injured.

== Records set in the S-52-1 ==
Starting in late 1945 Sikorsky engineers developed the [[Sikorsky S-52]] helicopter, its prototype flew first in 1947.

"It was a sharp, responsive dream," Thompson recalls. "After trying some mild acrobatics, I figured it would loop." Until Thompson, no one had dared try to loop a helicopter. As Sikorsky's chief test pilot [[Jimmy Viner]] pointed out, "Any of 10 things can go wrong--all fatal, be sure you know what you're doing." Thompson did—erratically at first, then perfectly—10 loops in all, as a [[8 mm film|8 mm]] movie camera recorded the flight at [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]]&lt;ref&gt;Tomiata (Tom Pavluvcik) Comment of about December 2016, to video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_952857 Sikorsky S-52 First Helicopter Loop - 1949] youtube.com, Bill Thompson (son of the pilot), published 28 November 2008, retrieved 29 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; on May 9th, 1949 for history.&lt;ref&gt;

That year,&lt;!--1948 or 1949?--&gt; he went to the [[Cleveland]] air races with the S-52, where he set the first of three international speed records that he was to achieve in the helicopters: {{convert|129.616|mph|kph}} over {{convert|3|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wrightpattcap.org/pad/index.php?s=18a900bf21380a51875a90c8012d94bb&amp;showtopic=299&amp;pid=328&amp;st=0&amp;#entry328 |title=On This Day in Air and Space History - 27 April |publisher=Wright-Patterson Sq, Civil Air Patrol |accessdate=September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Flight instructor ==
Thompson also taught others how to fly helicopters.  His students included Admiral [[Arthur W. Radford]]; [[Pat Handy]], first woman to fly solo in a helicopter; and [[Rodman Wanamaker]], Eastern department store tycoon.

== Last flight ==
His career came to an abrupt halt on a spring day in 1950, when he took an admiral aloft at the Navy's [[Lakehurst, New Jersey]], base.  Suddenly, a shaft snapped, and the tail rotor came apart.

Thompson skillfully kept the craft from spinning around, the usual result of such an accident.  The helicopter landed hard, crushed the landing gear and tilted, while the spinning overhead rotor chewed up the ground and disintegrated.  Tommy crawled out with nothing worse than a cut cheek.  The admiral was shaken, but game:  "All in a day's work, eh, boy?" Thompson however had walked away from more than 20 forced landings and now his fifth helicopter crash.  Figuring he had stretched the law of averages too far, he replied, "Maybe for you, sir, but not for me". That night, when he got home he talked to his wife and refrained from flying again in a helicopter until 1979.

==Later life==
After his flying career came to a halt, he moved back to Hobart, Indiana, and began working with his father, delivering fuel oil for the Standard Oil Company. In 1979, Thompson visited the Tucson Convention Center where a large helicopter convention was taking place.  He immediately was recognized for his feats during the convention and given the opportunity to pilot one of Sikorsky's S-58s.

Currently he is honored at the [[Smithsonian]] [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] outside the entrance to the [[Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center]].  Thompson can be found on Panel #37, Tablet #1, Column #1.

Thompson died on October 29, 2003 in Hobart, Indiana. He was survived by his wife Carolyn, their two sons and two of his grandsons.
&lt;!--I'm writing part of this from memory and as Harold's Grandson, he has a book available that talks all about his adventures
it was written for the family, but I can get copies to those who are interested.  I also have videos showing the loop and 4 photo albums full of pictures.Thanks for everyones help-- Robtff--&gt;

'''Karel Anton Hošek''' was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]] adventurer and revolutionary, a [[Voivode|voivod]] (captain) in the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] who operated in the [[Tikveš]] region. He is known as ''Anton Cheha'' (Anton the Czech) in [[Bulgaria]].

==Biography==
Hošek was born in [[Prague]], then part of [[Austro-Hungary]]. He went to Bulgaria to participate in the uprising against the [[Ottoman Empire]], joining the [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonian]] [[chetnik]]. Later, together with Austrian revolutionary [[Rudolf Goliat]] he joined the [[Kriva Palanka]] [[cheta]], led by [[Petar Angelov (military officer)|Petar Angelov]]. In April 1906, Hošek joined the Tikveš cheta, led by voivod [[Dobri Daskalov]], where Hošek would later be promoted himself to voivod and form his own cheta. In February 1907, Daskalov's and Hošek's chetas fought a battle in [[Veles (city)|Veles]] against the Serbian [[Chetniks]]. On February of that same year, in conjunction with a cheta from the [[Prilep]] area they surrounded an 80-strong Serbian cheta near [[Vladilovci]], [[Azot (region)|Azot]]. In the resulting skirmish Hošek and 2 of his chetniks died.&lt;ref&gt;Николов, Борис Й. Вътрешна македоно-одринска революционна организация. Войводи и ръководители (1893-1934).

She returned to Earth in September 2017, having spent 289 days, 5 hours and 1 minute in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacefacts.de/bios/astronauts/english/whitson_peggy.htm|title=Peggy Whitson Astronaut Biography|publisher=Space Facts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2017/04/24/nasa-astronaut-peggy-whitson-clinches-space-record.html  American Astronaut Peggy Whitson Sets Record for Women in Space], James Rogers, Fox News Channel, Apr 24 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In third place is American astronaut [[Sunita Williams]] with 195 days&lt;ref name="Malik"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/070208_exp14_eva4wrap.html |title=Orbital Champ: ISS Astronaut Sets New U.S. Spacewalk Record |publisher=Space.com |year=2007 |author=Tariq Malik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sunita-Bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/williams-s.html|title=Astronaut Bio: Sunita Williams (5/2008)|publisher= NASA Logo National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the ISS, where she was a member of [[Expedition 14]]/[[Expedition 15]] (2006–2007).

===Longest continuous occupation of space===
An international partnership consisting of Russia, the United States, Canada, Japan and the member states of the [[European Space Agency]] have jointly maintained a continuous human presence in space since 31 October 2000, when [[Soyuz TM-31]] was launched. Two days later it docked with the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name=MostExtreme/&gt;&lt;ref name=10Year&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/living/10years.html|title=10 Years and Counting|date=28 October 2010|publisher=NASA|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then space has been continuously occupied for {{age in years and days|2000|10|31}}.&lt;ref name=MostExtreme/&gt;

===Longest continuous occupation of a spacecraft===
The [[International Space Station]] has been continuously occupied since 2 November 2000 ({{age in years and days|2000|11|2}}).&lt;ref name=MostExtreme/&gt;&lt;ref name=10Year/&gt; It broke the record of 9 years and 358 days of the Soviet/Russian Space Station [[Mir]] on 23 October 2010.&lt;ref name=10Year/&gt;

===Longest solo flight===
[[Valery Bykovsky]] flew solo for 4 days, 23 hours in [[Vostok 5]] from 14 to 19 June 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=9352|title=Astronautic World Records: Spacecraft with one astronaut – General category|publisher=Fédération Aéronautique Internationale|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924045409/http://www.fai.org/fai-record-file/?recordId=9352|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}} This only counts the duration of solo flight within a mission, so a longer mission ''with'' solo flight, such as [[Apollo 17]] at 12d+13h duration is surpassed because the solo undocked duration was only 3d+7h.)&lt;/ref&gt; The flight set a space endurance record which was broken in 1965 by the (non-solo) [[Gemini 5]] flight. The Apollo program included long solo spaceflight, and during the [[Apollo 16]] mission, [[Ken Mattingly|T.K. Mattingly]] orbited solo around the Moon for more than [[Apollo 16#Mission insignia|3 days and 9 hours]].

===Longest time on the lunar surface===
[[Eugene Cernan]] and [[Harrison Schmitt]] of the [[Apollo 17]] mission stayed for 74 hours 59 minutes and 40 seconds (over 3 days) on the lunar surface after they landed on 11 December 1972.&lt;ref name=NASAAP17&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/saturn_apollo/documents/apollo17_overview.pdf|title=Mission Report: Apollo 17 – The Most Productive Lunar Expedition|publisher=NASA|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They performed three [[Extra-vehicular activity|EVAs]] (extra-vehicular activity) totaling 22 hours 3 minutes, 57 seconds (as commanders were always the first one out of the LM and the last to get back in, Cernan's EVA time was slightly longer).&lt;ref name=NASAAP17/&gt;

===Longest time in lunar orbit===
[[Ronald Evans (astronaut)|Ronald Evans]] of [[Apollo 17]] mission stayed in lunar orbit for 6 days and 4 hours (148 hours);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/Bios/htmlbios/evans-re.html|title=Ronal Evans Biographical Data|date=April 1990|publisher=NASA|accessdate=21 June 2015|quote=longest time in lunar orbit, 147 hours, 48 minutes}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, for the solo portion of that flight around the Moon, [[Ken Mattingly|T.

The [[Apollo 13]] crew ([[Jim Lovell]], [[Fred Haise]], and [[Jack Swigert]]), while passing over the far side of the moon at an altitude of {{convert|254|km|abbr=on}} from the lunar surface, were {{convert|400171|km|abbr=on}} from Earth.&lt;ref name="Apollo13History"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029/Apollo_13a_Summary.htm | title=Apollo 13 The Seventh Mission: The Third Lunar Landing Attempt 11 April–17 April 1970 | publisher=NASA | accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This record-breaking distance was reached at 0:21 UTC on 15 April 1970.&lt;ref name="Apollo13History"/&gt;

===Highest altitude for manned non-lunar mission===
[[Gemini 11]] crew [[Pete Conrad|Charles Conrad, Jr.]] and [[Richard F. Gordon, Jr.]] fired their [[Agena Target Vehicle]] rocket engine on 14 September 1966, at 40 hours 30 minutes after liftoff and achieved a record apogee altitude of {{convert|739.2|nmi|km}}.&lt;ref&gt;

==Animal records==
{{Further information|Animals in space}}

===First living organisms in space===
The first living organisms of any kind to enter space were [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]] launched by the United States in 1947 aboard a [[V-2 rocket]] to an altitude of {{Convert|68|mi|}}.&lt;ref name=spaceanimals/&gt; They were also the first animals to safely return from space.&lt;ref name=spaceanimals&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/20648-animals-in-space-history-infographic.html|title=Cosmic Menagerie: A History of Animals in Space (Infographic)|last=Tate|first=Karl|publisher=Space.com|type=infographic|accessdate=June 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First animal in orbit===
[[Laika]] was a Soviet female [[Dog|canine]] launched on 3 November 1957 on [[Sputnik 2]]. The technology to de-orbit had not yet been developed, so there was no expectation for survival. She died several hours into flight. [[Soviet space dogs|Belka and Strelka]] became the first canines to safely return to Earth from orbit on 19 August 1960.

===Longest canine single flight===
Soviet space dogs {{lang|ru-Latn|[[Soviet space dogs#Veterok and Ugolyok|Veterok]]}} ({{lang|ru|Ветерок}}, "Light Wind") and {{lang|ru-Latn|Ugolyok}} ({{lang|ru|Уголёк}}, "Ember") were launched on 22 February 1966 on board [[Cosmos 110]] and spent 22 days in orbit before landing on 16 March.

===First animals beyond low-Earth orbit===
An assortment of animals including a pair of [[Russian tortoise]]s, as well as [[Piophila|wine flies]] and [[mealworm]]s launched with a number of other biological specimens including [[seed]]s and [[bacteria]] on a [[circumlunar trajectory|circumlunar]] mission aboard the Soviet [[Zond 5]] spacecraft on 15 September 1968.&lt;ref name=spaceanimals /&gt; It was launched by a [[Proton-K]] rocket.&lt;ref name=spaceanimals /&gt; The capsule came within {{convert|2000|km|mi}} of the Moon and later successfully returned to Earth, the first spacecraft in history to return safely to Earth from the Moon.&lt;ref name=spaceanimals /&gt;

"'''Mižerja'''" is a [[Croatia]]n song that was the [[Croatia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013|Croatian entry]] for the [[2013 Eurovision Song Contest]]. The song was written prior to finding a suitable artist to perform the song in [[Malmö]]. The song is a [[klapa]] song and can also be considered a [[Dalmatia]]n ballad for having influence from traditional Croatian music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mižerja to be the Croatian entry in Malmö|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=71563&amp;_t=mizerja_to_be_the_croatian_entry_in_malmoe|work=eurovision.tv|publisher=eurovision.tv|accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song is performed by [[Klapa s Mora]], a "super klapa" ensemble that includes six male klapa singers from five existing klapa groups in Croatia, Kampanel, Sinj, Crikvenica, Sebenico and Grdelin. They are

*Marko Škugor - First tenor (from klapa Kampanel)
*Ante Galić - Second tenor (from klapa Sinj)
*Nikša Antica - First baritone (from klapa Kampanel)
*Leon Bataljaku - Second baritone (from klapa Crikvenica)
*Ivica Vlaić - Bass (from klapa Sebenico)
*Bojan Kavedžija - Bass (from klapa Grdelin)

Maestro Mojmir Čačija selected the artists and was responsible for the vocal arrangement. Producer [[Nikša Bratoš]], along with Dragan Brnas, made the arrangement of the song.

"Mižerja" was eliminated in the semi-final.

The Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE (OSCE PA) is an institution of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]. The primary task of the 323-member Assembly is to facilitate inter-parliamentary dialogue, an important aspect of the overall effort to meet the challenges of democracy throughout the OSCE area. The Parliamentary Assembly pursues objectives which are stated in the preamble of the Assembly's Rules of Procedure: assess the implementation of OSCE objectives by participating States; discuss subjects addressed during meetings of the Ministerial Council and summit meetings of OSCE Heads of State or Government; develop and promote mechanisms for the prevention and resolution of conflicts; support the strengthening and consolidation of democratic institutions in OSCE participating States; contribute to the development of OSCE institutional structures and of relations and co-operation between existing OSCE institutions.

To pursue these objectives, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly employs a variety of means: a Final Declaration and a number of resolutions and recommendations are adopted each year at the Annual Session; committee work addresses important contemporary international issues; different programmes, including an extensive Election Observation Programme, and various seminars, have been designed to develop and strengthen democracy; and delegations are sent on special missions to areas of latent or active crisis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oscepa.org/about-osce-pa&lt;/ref&gt;

The Parliamentary Assembly was originally established by the 1990 Paris Summit to promote greater involvement in the OSCE by national parliaments of the participating States. By passing resolutions and issuing formal recommendations to the OSCE's governmental side and to parliaments, it aims to pursue the implementation of OSCE objectives by participating States, including through legislative action.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oscepa.org/about-osce-pa&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parliamentary Committees and Groups==

The three General Committees correspond to the three main sections of the Helsinki Final Act: the General Committee on Political Affairs and Security; the General Committee on Economic Affairs, Science, Technology and Environment; and the General Committee on Democracy, Human Rights and Humanitarian Questions.

The Standing Committee consists of Heads of National Delegations to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly and the Members of the Bureau. The Standing Committee and the Bureau prepare the work of the Assembly between sessions and ensure the efficient operation of the Assembly.

Several other committees and groups  address specific issues or areas that can benefit from parliamentary attention. The Standing Committee approved the creation of bodies to work on problems in Belarus and Moldova as well as to address the need for greater transparency and accountability in the OSCE.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oscepa.org/about-osce-pa/parliamentary-committees-groups&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election Observation==

At the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly's Annual Session in Helsinki (1993) the then Chairperson-in-Office, Swedish Foreign Minister Baroness Margaretha af Ugglas, urged parliamentarians to actively participate in election observation and monitoring. In response to this call, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly has developed a particularly active programme for observing elections in the OSCE area.

More than 5,000 parliamentarians from the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly have observed some 140 elections since 1993, using their experience as elected officials to enhance the credibility and visibility of the OSCE election observation work.

==President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OSCE==
[[File:IlkkaKanervaSpencerOliverOSCEPA.jpg|thumb|left|OSCE President Ilkka Kanerva (left) with Secretary General Spencer Oliver (right)]]
At each Annual Session the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly elects a president who acts as the highest representative of the Assembly, appoints Special Representatives on topics of concern, recommends to the OSCE Chairman-in-Office leaders of OSCE election observation missions, and presides over meetings of the Assembly. The president is elected for one year and can be re-elected for an additional one-year term.

In June 2014 [[Ilkka Kanerva]] from Finland was elected the new president of the Parliamentary Assembly. Kanerva is the former foreign minister of Finland who was sacked in 2008 after sending over 200 text messages to [[Johanna Tukiainen]] an erotic dancer. Then Prime Minister [[Jyrki Katainen]] had said that "Kanerva has shown a great lack of judgment ... he doesn't enjoy the full trust which a minister needs,".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/200-texts-to-an-erotic-dancer-finnish-foreign-minister-sacked-in-text-message-scandal-a-544755.html&lt;/ref&gt; Kanerva initially denied the reports &lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1583679/Finnish-minister-quits-over-saucy-texts.html&lt;/ref&gt; but later claimed the messages were work related.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbcnews.com/id/23902365/ns/world_news-europe/t/finn-minister-gets-boot-over-dancer-scandal/&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, in 2005, when Kanerva was deputy speaker of the parliament he had been rebuked for sending text messages to two nude models &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/03/29/us-finland-minister-idUSL2932433420080329&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

In 2010 the [[International Peace Institute]] called for the OSCE PA to update its election monitoring guidelines and procedures to ensure that its election reporting would be free from bias. The institute also criticized the OSCE PA’s way of conducting its election-monitoring by stating that “Parliamentarians parachuted in to read out headline-grabbing statements undercut the credibility of long-term and constructive election monitoring” &lt;ref&gt;International Peace Institute (October 2010). Issue Brief: Reaching the OSCE Summit in Astana pp. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the Parliamentary Assembly was criticized from within by the Latvian delegation for lacking transparency and democracy. OSCE PA Secretary General [[Robert Spencer Oliver]] (b. 1938), who had held the post since the organization's inception in 1992, faced a challenge from the Latvian [[Artis Pabriks]]. According to the rules of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly the incumbent could only be replaced with a full consensus minus one vote of the Standing Committee, which comprises 56 heads of delegations. A full consensus minus one vote would therefore require 55 votes. The incumbent Secretary General however only needed a simple majority to be re-appointed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/26560/#.UrQ4bRbdFUR&lt;/ref&gt; A rule change proposed by Pabriks, would also have required a consensus minus one vote. Pabriks called the rules "quite shocking from the perspective of an organization that's monitoring elections"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0710/An_election_in_Copenhagen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly sent election observers to the US presidential election. The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly’s president at the time was Democratic Congressman [[Alcee Hastings]]. Hastings had previously been impeached for corruption by the US Congress. The OSCE faced criticism of partisanship and double standards due to Hastings's past and the fact that the OSCE's mandate was to promote democracy and the values of civil society.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/americas/2004/vote_usa_2004/3987655.stm&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Protestant Church of Luxembourg''' ({{lang-lb|Protestantesch Kiirch vu Letzebuerg}}, {{lang-fr|Église Protestante de Luxembourg}}, {{lang-de|Evangelische Kirche von Luxemburg}}) is a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] [[Christian denomination|denomination]] that operates solely in [[Luxembourg]]. It is a [[united church]], unifying facets of [[Calvinism]] and [[Lutheranism]].

The church was founded by order of [[Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke]] [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Adolphe]] on 16 April 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.ce.etat.lu/html/43547.HTML Église Protestante du Luxembourg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927213308/http://www.ce.etat.lu/html/43547.HTML |date=2007-09-27 }}.  31 March 1998. Luxembourg Council of State; retrieved 24 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time, the state supported [[Roman Catholicism]], under the [[Concordat of 1801]], and Adolphe sought to redress the balance by recognising the country's Protestant minority. However, the Protestant population was divided into several denominations, including [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], and [[Waldensians]]. Adolphe decided to create a new church that synthesised the ''Augsburg and Helvetian creeds'' (i.e. Lutheranism and Calvinism), allowing him to recognise both traditions whilst supporting only one church.

The Protestant Church of Luxembourg has 1,300 registered members, and remains the biggest of several Protestant churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lkg.jalb.de/lkg/jsp/document1.jsp?news_id=610&amp;lang=en&amp;side_id=36 Luxembourg] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006125018/http://lkg.jalb.de/lkg/jsp/document1.jsp?news_id=610&amp;lang=en&amp;side_id=36 |date=2007-10-06 }}.  July 2005. Community of Protestant Churches in Europe; retrieved 24 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The general assembly of the church elects every three years half the members of the [[Consistory (Protestantism)|Consistory]], the executive body, each for a six-year term. The consistory was first constituted according to the statutes enacted to this end in 1894. The consistory runs the consistorial [[Secretariat (administrative office)|secretariat]]. The consistory is responsible to the general assembly. The latter and the consistory together elect one of the active pastors of the church to serve as the ecclesiastical president (Chef de culte; Kirchenpräsident). Other Protestant churches operating in Luxembourg include the [[Protestant Reformed Church of Luxembourg]], the [[Association Mennonite Luxembourgeoise]], the [[Evangelical Church in Germany]], the [[Church of England]], the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], the [[Church of Denmark]].

== Time code ==
Every 100 ms, synchronized to the UTC second, one bit is transmitted:
{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ RBU tenth second format&lt;ref name="betke"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://relax-sdr.3dn.ru/load/0-0-0-66-20 |format=PDF |title=Standard Frequency and Time Signal Stations on Longwave and Shortwave |author=Klaus Betke |date=1 August 2002 |accessdate=2011-09-20 |pages=16–17}}. Note that there is a modulation type error in this reference.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vniiftri"&gt;{{Citation|url=ftp://ftp.vniiftri.ru/BULLETINS/V/bull_b16_2018.pdf|format=PDF|title=Standard Time and Frequency Signals|pages=5-6, 18–20|accessdate=2018-07-15}} -- official signal specification, in russian.&lt;/ref&gt;
! Start || Duration || Signal
|-
| +0 ms || 10 ms ||align=left| Unmodulated carrier
|-
| +10 ms || 80 ms ||align=left| Carrier [[Phase modulation|PM]] modulated with 100&amp;nbsp;Hz or 312.5&amp;nbsp;Hz tone, modulation index 0.698
|-
| +90 ms || 5 ms ||align=left| Unmodulated carrier
|-
| +95 ms || 5 ms ||align=left| Carrier off
|}

100&amp;nbsp;Hz modulation encodes a binary 0, while 312.5&amp;nbsp;Hz modulation encodes a binary 1.

Each UTC second consists of 10 such bits.  6 of them are fixed, two encode minute boundaries, and two provide time code information:

{|class="wikitable" style="text-align:right"

|-
| 800 ms
|-
| 900 ms ||align=left| Always 1 (312.5&amp;nbsp;Hz tone)
|}

Each minute, the two bits of time code encode the local time of the following minute (like [[DCF77]]) and some additional information.  Because the time code starts with two 1 bits, the top of the minute is uniquely marked by 5 consecutive 1 bits.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://web.me.com/nils.schiffhauer/Website/Monitoring/Archiv.html Nils Schiffhauer's radio monitoring pages].  Under "Audio Clips - Medium Wave (&amp; Longwave)" are audio samples of several time signal stations, including both an audio clip and a spectrogram "[[waterfall diagram]]" of RBU at the top of the hour.  It clearly shows the 0.1 second bits producing [[sideband]]s straddling the carrier at ±100 Hz and ±312.5 Hz, and the 5 consecutive 1 bits marking the top of the minute.  The carrier has been shifted down by 66.0 kHz, so it shows up on the plot at 666⅔ Hz.&lt;/ref&gt;

dUT1 is an additional, higher-precision correction to DUT1.  UT1 = UTC + DUT1 + dUT1.
Bits with a weight of ± are 0 for positive, 1 for negative.  The time transmitted is Moscow local time; [[UTC]] can be computed by subtracting the value of the ΔUT field.

[[Ivory Coast]] (Côte d'Ivoire) has 660 kilometres of railway (1995 estimate).  The [[track gauge]] is {{RailGauge|1000mm}}.

This railway was built during the French colonial period, and links the port city of [[Abidjan]] with [[Ouagadougou]], the capital of [[Burkina Faso]].  

In October 2010, the government announced plans to build a 737&amp;nbsp;km line which would link the port of [[San Pédro, Côte d'Ivoire|San Pedro]] to mines in the west of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-10-05/ivory-coast-plans-to-build-railway-to-boost-output-from-its-western-mines.html

The '''Republic of the North Solomons''' was an [[list of states with limited recognition|unrecognised state]] that purported to exist for about six months in what is now the [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville]], [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG). It involved:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Bougainville independence referendum: Assessing the risks and challenges before, during and after the referendum by Jo Woodbury
January 2015; Commonwealth of Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other People's Wars: A History of Australian Peacekeeping; Peter Londey;
Allen &amp; Unwin, 2004; Laracy 'Bougainville secessionism'&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|a 'Unilateral Declaration of Independence of the Republic of North Solomons' and a failed bid for self-determination at the [[UN]]}}

Independence was [[Unilateralism|unilaterally]] declared on 1 September 1975,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Notholt|first1=Stuart A.|title=Fields of Fire - An Atlas of Ethnic Conflict|date=December 2009|page=6.27|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=r7SSlQJMsbsC&amp;pg=SA6-PA27&amp;lpg=SA6-PA27&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Australia]]n-administered [[territory of Papua and New Guinea]], which itself was due to become independent on 16 September.

Tensions soon escalated and by mid-1976, the Papua New Guinea riot police squad was sent to southern Bougainville to restore order.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[John Momis]], at the time Chairman of the putative Republic's ruling council denounced this action as an invasion.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Mutual concerns about security on the island and the Republic's failure to achieve any international recognition eventually led to talks between the PNG Government and the secessionist leader.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; A settlement was reached in August 1976 on the basis of increased decentralisation. Bougainville was renamed "''North Solomons Province''", in recognition of its geography, and re-absorbed politically into PNG with increased self-governance powers, a model later replicated to delineate provincial powers throughout PNG.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Reaction==
Papua New Guinea's Chief Minister, Mr [[Michael Somare]], initially showed no outward concern at Bougainville's stand. The [[Roman Catholic Church]], the most powerful organization in Bougainville, officially announced its support for the breakaway move.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} (Bougainvilleans have experienced [[German Colonial Empire|German]], [[British Empire|British]], and [[Australia]]n [[Colony|colonial administrations]] and [[Missionary|missionaries]].) Papua New Guinea, Australia and the [[United Nations]] did not recognize the [[secession]] and PNG government officials on the island simply ignored it. Through their district council, the Western Islands District of the [[British Solomon Islands Protectorate]]{{spaced ndash}}comprising a third of the population of the [[Solomon Islands]]{{spaced ndash}}asked to join independent Bougainville.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Context==
Many Bougainville islanders have always regarded themselves as a separate entity in Papua New Guinea.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The people have very dark skin in contrast to the lighter skin colour of Papuans.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The island is over 900 [[kilometre]]s east of the [[Geography of Papua New Guinea|mainland]] and, geographically, is nearer the [[Solomon Islands]], forming part of the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands archipelago]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The declaration of independence followed the discovery sometime previously of the world's largest [[Mineral|deposit]]s of [[copper]] in the region. The Papua New Guinea Government had then established the [[Bougainville Copper]] mine company in [[Panguna]], central Bougainville. Bougainville Copper was a subsidiary of [[Consolidated Zinc|Conzinc Rio Tinto of Australia]], which in turn was controlled by the British company [[Rio Tinto Group]]. When the [[mining]] started, the Australian administration, backed by [[Paramilitary|armed police]], gave access to [[Prospecting|prospectors]] while informing residents that their land was being taken over without discussion.

The '''Latin Archdiocese of Ispahan/Esfahan or Isfahan''' ({{lang-la|Archidioecesis Hispahanensis Latinorum}}) is the organization of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=GCathIspahan&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/ispa0.htm "Archdiocese of Isfahan"] ''GCatholic.org''. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CathHierIspahan&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dispa.html "Archdiocese of Ispahan"] ''[[Catholic-Hierarchy.org]]''. David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides a small number of [[Latin rite]] locals, most Roman Catholics in Iran are foreigners living in the country. The majority of Catholics in Iran belong to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]], and there is also a small [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] diocese.

==Predecessor in the 14th century==
Roman Catholic presence in Iran has always been a function of the relations between the Roman pope and the rulers of Iran. The first Roman Catholic diocese in Iran was founded by Dominicans in 1318 at [[Soltaniyeh]] which then was the capital of the Mongol [[Ilkhan]] rulers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irandoms.org/history/dominicans-in-iran&lt;/ref&gt; It lasted less than 100 years into the beginning of the 15th century and disappeared during the conquests of [[Timur Lenk]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/ds611.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The diocese was established by Italian Dominican friars on October 12, 1629 when [[Isfahan]] was the capital of the [[Safavid]] Empire. The cathedral was situated in the then Christian suburb of [[New Julfa]].&lt;ref&gt;In the modern city of Isfahan, of which New Jolfa nowadays is a quarter, here are twenty-five churches in the city, of which eleven are still functioning.&lt;/ref&gt; This diocese continued under the rule of Shah [[Safi of Persia|Safi I]].

The next appointments of bishops were only possible with longer interruptions from 1693 until 1708 (Elias Mutton) and from 1716 until 1731 (Barnabas Fedeli). The small Catholic community is Isfahan was devastated by the [[Siege of Isfahan|Afghan invasion of the city]] in 1722. In consequence the titular diocese was administered from the see of Baghdad with only a handful of Catholic families surviving in Isfahan.

In the 19th century Catholic missionaries were able to restart activities in Iran. From their center in [[Urmia]], apostolic administrators tried to reorganize the Latin Church in the country. In 1896, the Lazarist missionary François Lesné was made bishop of Isfahan. Like his successor, Jacques-Emile Sontag, he resided in Urmia in Western Iran which until the [[First World War]] held a sizeable Christian population of Assyrian and Chaldaean Christians. The diocese was elevated to an archdiocese on July 1, 1910.

After the devastation of the Christian population during and after the First World War the see of Isfahan fell vacant again.

It was not until 1974 that a new archbishop of Isfahan could be instituted. For this the Dominican priest [[Kevin William Barden]] at Tehran was chosen. Since then the see of the diocese has been at Tehran. When Barden was expelled from the country in the beginning of the Islamic revolution in 1980, it took another 9 years until the Salesian [[Ignazio Bedini]] was consecrated new archbishop. Since his retirement in 2014, the diocese has been administered by an apostolic administrator.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2781">'''Tage Carstensen''' was in charge of all international aspects of the [[2nd World Scout Jamboree]], held from August 9 to 17, 1924 at [[Ermelunden, Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 63, 82&lt;/ref&gt; He later served as a lawyer in [[Jutland]], International Commissioner of [[Fællesrådet for Danmarks Drengespejdere|Det Danske Spejderkorps]], and founder of the [[Scout Blood Transfusion Service]].

Even before the Scouts started the first Scout blood donor corps there were volunteer [[:da:Bloddonor|blood donors in Denmark]], but it was the young Scout leader, [[barrister]] Tage Carstensen who in 1930 brought the idea of a voluntary Scout blood donor corps to Denmark. During a trip to [[England]], he had made acquaintance with English Scouts who were blood donors, and he wrote to his Scout friends around Denmark to get them to start a donor corps. The first Scout donation took place on May 21, 1932. During the first year there were 53 blood donors in Denmark, who gave 33 units of blood. It was believed at the time that the 200 donors was enough to cover the future need for blood. On 17 April 1937, the banquet hall of [[:da:KFUM-borgen]] was used for the award of bronze plaques for the first 6 Danish [[blood donor]]s who had given blood 10 times. It was a feast for 300 donors, led by Scout Blood Transfusion Service chairman Tage Carstensen.

== 2nd World Scout Jamboree ==
Denmark has a comparatively small Scout population and doubts were expressed beforehand as to whether it would be possible for the [[Scouting and Guiding in Denmark|Danish Scouts]] to make a success of the undertaking. The main host was [[Christian Holm (Scouting)|Christian Holm]], President of [[Fællesrådet for Danmarks Drengespejdere|Det Danske Spejderkorps]], whose daughter became known as ''[[Kim, Friend of all the World]]''. The three Scouters responsible for the preparation, organization and administration were very young men, but they made a success of the Jamboree. [[Ove Holm]], later to become Chief Scout of Det Danske Spejderkorps, was the Organizing Secretary and Administrator, [[Jens Hvass]], later a state forester and Divisional Scout Commissioner in [[North Jutland County|North Jutland]], was the Camp Chief, and Tage Carstensen, later a lawyer in [[Jutland]], International Commissioner and founder of the Scout [[Blood Transfusion]] Service, was in charge of all international aspects.&lt;ref&gt;John S. Wilson (1959), Scouting Round the World. First edition, Blandford Press. p. 63, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Members ==
The band consists of:
*'''Aydos Saghat''' (Айдос Сағат): The [[vocals|vocalist]], [[Keyboard instrument|keyboardist]], and [[songwriter]] for Urker, he studied in a [[College or university school of music|conservatory]] in his youth, but initially dreamed of becoming a [[conductor (music)|conductor]] rather than a songwriter.&lt;ref name="KPravda"/&gt;
*'''Rustam Musin''' (Рустам Мусин): The [[guitar]]ist for Urker, he has no formal musical education, and originally trained as an [[engineer]].&lt;ref name="KPravda"/&gt;

==History and development==
Urker formed in 1994; lead vocalist and songwriter Aydos Saghat stated that he was inspired to form the group by the example of [[The Beatles]]. They recorded their first album in 1997; in 2001, their song "Nauryz" won the Golden Disk award, reflecting their rise to popularity.&lt;ref name="KPravda"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kazpravda.kz/index.php?uin=1152073573&amp;chapter=1002122980&amp;act=archive_date&amp;day=29&amp;month=12&amp;year=2002|date=2002-12-29|accessdate=2007-07-06|publisher=Kazakhstanskaya Pravda|title=Новые ритмы казахских песен (New rhythms of Kazakh songs)|last=Shulembaeva|first=Raushan|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927000841/http://www.kazpravda.kz/index.php?uin=1152073573&amp;chapter=1002122980&amp;act=archive_date&amp;day=29&amp;month=12&amp;year=2002|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their music combines traditional Kazakh folk melodies and modern pop rhythms. Of their fifteen music videos produced up until 2005, fourteen were filmed in Kazakhstan; only the remaining one, "Tugan Elim", was recorded abroad, in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]]. Their 2007 video "Arman", shot in cooperation with [[Tatars|Tatar]] musician [[Rezeda Galimova]], was also recorded in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="Nurgalieva"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Liter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.liter.kz/site.php?lan=russian&amp;id=129&amp;pub=2096 |last=Ten |first=Olga |date=2005-10-14 |accessdate=2007-07-06 |publisher=Liter Media |title=Видеопривет Питеру Гэбриэлу |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928121111/http://www.liter.kz/site.php?lan=russian&amp;id=129&amp;pub=2096 |archivedate=2007-09-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Saghat has stated that their visuals and cinematographic technique are highly influenced by [[United Kingdom|British]] musician [[Peter Gabriel]].&lt;ref name="Liter"/&gt; In April 2007, Urker travelled to [[New York City]] for a live performance at the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]] in celebration of the holiday of [[Nowruz|Nauryz]]; in an interview following his return to Kazakhstan, Saghat stated that Urker would be releasing a new album later in the year.&lt;ref name="Nurgalieva"/&gt;

'''Vanuatu''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|audio=en-us-Vanuatu.ogg|ˌ|v|ɑː|n|u|ˈ|ɑː|t|uː}} {{respell|VAH|noo|AH|too}} or {{IPAc-en|v|æ|n|ˈ|w|ɑː|t|uː}} {{respell|van|WAH|too}}; &lt;small&gt;[[Bislama]], French&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-xx|vanuatu}}), officially the '''Republic of Vanuatu''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|République de Vanuatu}}, [[Bislama]]: ''Ripablik blong Vanuatu''), is a Pacific [[island country]] located in the South Pacific Ocean. The [[archipelago]], which is of volcanic origin, is {{convert|1750|km|mi}} east of northern Australia, {{convert|540|km|mi}} northeast of [[New Caledonia]], east of [[New Guinea]], southeast of the [[Solomon Islands]], and west of [[Fiji]].

Vanuatu was first inhabited by [[Melanesians|Melanesian]] people. The first Europeans to visit the islands were a Spanish expedition led by Portuguese navigator [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós|Fernandes de Queirós]], who arrived on [[Espíritu Santo|the largest island]] in 1606. Since the Portuguese and Spanish monarchies had been unified under the king of Spain in 1580 (following the vacancy of the [[Portuguese throne]], which lasted for sixty years, until 1640, when the Portuguese monarchy was restored), Queirós claimed the archipelago for Spain, as part of the colonial [[Spanish East Indies]], and named it ''La Austrialia del Espíritu Santo''.

In the 1880s, France and the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] claimed parts of the archipelago, and in 1906, they agreed on a framework for jointly managing the archipelago as the [[New Hebrides]] through an Anglo–French [[condominium (international law)|condominium]]. An independence movement arose in the 1970s, and the Republic of Vanuatu was founded in 1980. Since independence, the country is a member of the [[United Nations]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie]] and the [[Pacific Islands Forum]].
{{toc limit}}

== Etymology ==
Vanuatu's name is derived from the word ''[[vanua]]'' ("land" or "home"),{{sfn|Hess|2009|p=115}} which occurs in several [[Austronesian languages]],{{efn|1=''Vanua'' in turns comes from the [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] ''banua'' – see {{harvnb|Reuter|2002|p=29}}; and {{harvnb|Reuter|2006|p=326}}}} and the word ''tu'' ("stand"). Together the two words indicated the independent status of the new country.{{sfn|Crowley|2004|p=3}}

==History==
{{Main|History of Vanuatu}}

The prehistory of Vanuatu is obscure; [[archaeological]] evidence supports the theory that people speaking Austronesian languages first came to the islands about 3,300 years ago.{{sfn|Bedford|Spriggs|2008}} Pottery fragments have been found dating to 1300–1100 BC.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2815.htm|title=Background Note: Vanuatu|publisher=[[US Department of State]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513225602/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2815.htm|archivedate=13 May 2008}}&lt;br /&gt;''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vanuatu group of islands first had contact with Europeans in 1606, when the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] explorer [[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], sailing for the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish Crown]], arrived on [[Espiritu Santo|the largest island]] and called the group of islands ''La [[Luís Vaz de Torres#The Queirós Voyage|Austrialia]] del Espiritu Santo'' or "The Southern Land of the Holy Spirit", believing he had arrived in [[Terra Australis]] (Australia). The Spanish established a short-lived settlement at Big Bay on the north side of the island. The name [[Espiritu Santo]] remains to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vanuatu and New Caledonia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FBllKxtYnNkC&amp;pg=PA29|year=2009|publisher=Lonely Planet|isbn=978-1-74104-792-9|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europeans did not return until 1768, when [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] rediscovered the islands on 22 May, naming them the Great [[Cyclades]].&lt;ref name="Anne"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salmond|first1=Anne|title=Aphrodite's Island|date=2010|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520261143|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1774, [[Captain Cook]] named the islands the New Hebrides, a name that would last until independence in 1980.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;
[[File:The Landing at Tana one of the New Hebrides, by William Hodges.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|[[James Cook]] landing at [[Tanna (island)|Tanna island]], c. 1774]]

In 1825, the trader [[Peter Dillon]]'s discovery of [[sandalwood]] on the island of [[Erromango]] began a rush of immigrants that ended in 1830 after a clash between immigrant Polynesian workers and indigenous Melanesians. During the 1860s, [[plantations|planters]] in Australia, Fiji, New Caledonia, and the Samoa Islands, in need of labourers, encouraged a long-term [[indentured labour]] trade called "[[blackbirding]]". At the height of the labour trade, more than one-half the adult male population of several of the islands worked abroad. Fragmentary evidence indicates that the current population of Vanuatu is greatly reduced compared to pre-contact times.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

In the 19th century, [[missionary|missionaries]], both [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Protestant]], arrived on the islands. Settlers also came, looking for land on which to establish [[cotton plantation]]s. When international cotton prices collapsed, they switched to coffee, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], bananas, and, most successfully, [[coconut]]s. Initially, British subjects from Australia made up the majority, but the establishment of the Caledonian Company of the New Hebrides in 1882 soon tipped the balance in favour of French subjects.&lt;ref name="UsaUSA2009"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vanuatu Country Study Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjuxcXTEJ_sC&amp;pg=PA26|date=30 March 2009|publisher=Int'l Business Publications|isbn=978-1-4387-5649-3|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By around the start of the 20th century, the French outnumbered the British two to one.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

[[File:F6F-3 Hellcats of VF-40 at Espiritu Santo 1944.jpg|thumb|left|US Navy [[Grumman F6F Hellcat|Hellcats]] on [[Espiritu Santo]] island in February 1944]]
The jumbling of French and British interests in the islands brought petitions for one or another of the two powers to annexe the territory. The Convention of 16 October 1887 established a [[Anglo-French Joint Naval Commission|joint naval commission]] for the sole purpose of protecting French and British citizens, with no claim to jurisdiction over internal native affairs.&lt;ref name="BresnihanWoodward2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bresnihan|first1=Brian J.|last2=Woodward|first2=Keith|title=Tufala Gavman: Reminiscences from the Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nhNmCiYYxucC&amp;pg=PA423|year=2002|publisher=editorips@usp.ac.fj|isbn=978-982-02-0342-6|page=423}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1906, however, France and the United Kingdom agreed to administer the islands jointly. Called the British-French [[Condominium (international law)|Condominium]], it was a unique form of government, with separate governmental systems that came together only in a joint court. The condominium's authority was extended in the Anglo-French Protocol of 1914, although this was not formally ratified until 1922. Melanesians were barred from acquiring the [[citizenship]] of either power and were officially stateless.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

In the 1920s, indentured workers from [[Annam (French protectorate)|French Annam]] (now part of [[Vietnam]]) came to work in the plantations in the New Hebrides. They were 437 in 1923, 5,413 in 1930, then after the crisis 1,630 in 1937. There was some social and political unrest among them in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Robequain, "[http://www.persee.fr/doc/geo_0003-4010_1950_num_59_317_13156Les Nouvelles-Hébrides et l'immigration annamite]", ''[[Annales de Géographie]]'', t. 59, n°317, 1950. pp. 391–392&lt;/ref&gt;

Challenges to the ''condominium'' government began in the early 1940s. The arrival of [[United States|Americans]] during the [[Second World War]], with their informal habits and relative wealth, contributed to the rise of nationalism in the islands. The belief in a mythical messianic figure named [[John Frum]] was the basis for an indigenous [[cargo cult]] (a movement attempting to obtain industrial goods through magic) promising Melanesian deliverance. Today, John Frum is both a religion and a political party with a member in Parliament.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

[[File:Flag of New Hebrides.svg|thumb|1966 flag of the colonial Anglo-French [[New Hebrides]]]]
The first political party, established in the early 1970s, was called the New Hebrides National Party. One of the founders was Father [[Walter Lini]], who later became Prime Minister. Renamed the [[Vanua'aku Pati]] in 1974, the party pushed for independence, which was gained amidst the brief [[Coconut War]].{{sfn|Shears|1980}}&lt;ref name=twsSEPzzx&gt;{{cite news

The independent Republic of Vanuatu was established in 1980.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

During the 1990s, Vanuatu experienced a period of political instability which resulted in a more decentralised government. The Vanuatu Mobile Force, a paramilitary group, attempted a coup in 1996 because of a pay dispute. There were allegations of corruption in the government of [[Maxime Carlot Korman]]. New elections have been held several times since 1997, most recently in 2016.

{{Main|Geography of Vanuatu}}&lt;!---forked article appears shorter than this "summary." should forked article be merged?---&gt;

Vanuatu is a Y-shaped archipelago consisting of about 82 relatively small, geologically newer islands of [[Volcano|volcanic origin]] (65 of them inhabited), with about {{convert|1300|km|mi}} between the most northern and southern islands.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; Two of these islands ([[Matthew and Hunter Islands|Matthew and Hunter]]) are also claimed and controlled by France as part of the French [[sui generis collectivity|collectivity]] of New Caledonia. The country lies between latitudes 13°S and 21°S and longitudes 166°E and 171°E.

The fourteen of Vanuatu's islands that have surface areas of more than {{convert|100|km2|sqmi}} are, from largest to smallest: [[Espiritu Santo]], [[Malakula]], [[Efate]], [[Erromango]], [[Ambrym]], [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]], [[Pentecost Island|Pentecost]], [[Epi (island)|Epi]], [[Ambae]] or Aoba, [[Gaua]], [[Vanua Lava]], [[Maewo]], [[Malo Island|Malo]] and [[Aneityum]] or Anatom.
The nation's largest towns are the capital [[Port Vila]], on Efate, and [[Luganville]] on Espiritu Santo.&lt;ref name="State"&gt;{{cite web| work = Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs| publisher = [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]]|date=April 2007| title = Background Note: Vanuatu| url = https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2815.htm| accessdate = 16 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highest point in Vanuatu is [[Mount Tabwemasana]], at {{convert|1879|m|ft}}, on the island of Espiritu Santo.

Vanuatu's total area is roughly {{convert|12274|km2|sqmi}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = SEDAC Socioeconomic Data and Applications Centre| year = 2000|url = http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/gpw/country.jsp?iso=VUT|title = Oceania&amp;nbsp;– Vanuatu Summary|accessdate = 26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which its land surface is very limited (roughly {{convert|4700|km2|sqmi}}). Most of the islands are steep, with unstable soils and little permanent fresh water.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; One estimate, made in 2005, is that only 9% of land is used for agriculture (7% with permanent crops, plus 2% considered arable).&lt;ref name="SOPAC"&gt;{{cite web| publisher = SOPAC| url = http://www.pacificwater.org/pages.cfm/country-information/vanuatu.html|title = Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (Pacific Islands Applied Geoscience Commission)|accessdate = 26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoreline is mostly rocky with fringing reefs and no [[continental shelf]], dropping rapidly into the ocean depths.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

There are several active [[volcanoes]] in Vanuatu, including [[Lopevi]], [[Mount Yasur]] and several underwater volcanoes. [[Volcanic activity]] is common, with an ever-present danger of a major eruption; a nearby undersea eruption of 6.4 magnitude occurred in November 2008 with no casualties, and an eruption occurred in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = indiaserver.com| date = 11 July 2008|url = http://www.india-server.com/news/major-earthquake-jolts-island-nation-4551.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110713025110/http://www.india-server.com/news/major-earthquake-jolts-island-nation-4551.html|archivedate = 13 July 2011|title = Major Earthquake Jolts Island Nation Vanuatu|accessdate = 26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vanuatu is recognised as a distinct [[terrestrial ecoregion]], known as the [[Vanuatu rain forests]]. It is part of the [[Australasia ecozone]], which includes New Caledonia, the Solomon Islands, Australia, New Guinea and [[New Zealand]].

Vanuatu's population (estimated in 2008 as growing 2.4% annually)&lt;ref&gt;Asia Development Bank Vanuatu Economic Report 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is placing increasing pressure on land and resources for agriculture, grazing, hunting, and fishing. 90% of Vanuatu households fish and consume fish, which has caused intense fishing pressure near villages and the depletion of near-shore fish species. While well-vegetated, most islands show signs of deforestation. The islands have been logged, particularly of high-value timber, subjected to wide-scale slash-and-burn agriculture, and converted to coconut plantations and cattle ranches, and now show evidence of increased soil erosion and landslides.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

Many upland watersheds are being deforested and degraded, and fresh water is becoming increasingly scarce. Proper waste disposal, as well as water and air pollution, are becoming troublesome issues around urban areas and large villages. Additionally, the lack of employment opportunities in industry and inaccessibility to markets have combined to lock rural families into a subsistence or self-reliance mode, putting tremendous pressure on local ecosystems.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

===Flora and fauna===
{{see also|List of birds of Vanuatu}}

Despite its tropical forests, Vanuatu has a limited number of plant and animal species. It has an indigenous flying fox, ''[[Pteropus anetianus]]''. Flying foxes are important rainforest and timber regenerators. They pollinate and seed disperse a wide variety of native trees. Their diet is nectar, pollen and fruit and they are commonly called "fruit bats". They are in decline across their South Pacific range. However, governments are increasingly aware of the economic and ecological value of flying foxes and there are calls to increase their protection. There are no indigenous large mammals. The nineteen species of native reptiles include the [[Ramphotyphlops braminus|flowerpot snake]], found only on Efate. The [[Fiji banded iguana]] (''Brachylophus fasciatus'') was introduced as a [[feral]] animal in the 1960s.{{sfn|Sprackland|1992}}&lt;ref name=lp/&gt; There are eleven species of bats (three unique to Vanuatu) and sixty-one species of land and water birds. While the small [[Polynesian rat]] is thought to be indigenous, the large species arrived with Europeans, as did domesticated hogs, dogs, and cattle. The ant species of some of the islands of Vanuatu were catalogued by [[E. O. Wilson]].{{sfn|Wilson|1994}}

The region is rich in sea life, with more than 4,000 species of marine molluscs and a large diversity of [[List of fishes of the Coral Sea|marine fishes]]. Cone snails and stonefish carry poison fatal to humans. The [[Achatina fulica|Giant East African land snail]] arrived only in the 1970s, but already has spread from the Port-Vila region to Luganville.

There are three or possibly four adult [[saltwater crocodile]]s living in Vanuatu's mangroves and no current breeding population.&lt;ref name = lp&gt;{{cite book |first=Jocelyn |last = Harewood |title=Vanuatu and New Caledonia |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2009 |page=47 |isbn=0-86622-634-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said the crocodiles reached the northern part of the islands after cyclones, given the island chain's proximity to the Solomon Islands and New Guinea where crocodiles are very common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bennett| first=Michelle|author2=Jocelyn Harewood |title=Vanuatu |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2003 |page=19 |isbn=978-1-74059-239-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
The climate is tropical, with about nine months of warm to hot rainy weather and the possibility of cyclones and three to four months of cooler, drier weather characterised by winds from the southeast. The water temperature ranges from {{convert|22|C}} in winter to {{convert|28|C}} in the summer. Cool between April and September, the days become hotter and more humid starting in October. The daily temperature ranges from {{convert|20|–|32|C}}. Southeasterly [[trade winds]] occur from May to October.&lt;ref name="pc"&gt;[http://www.peacecorps.gov/welcomebooks/vuwb461.pdf ''The Peace Corps Welcomes You to Vanuatu''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910005909/http://www.peacecorps.gov/welcomebooks/vuwb461.pdf |date=10 September 2008 }}. [[Peace Corps]] (May 2007).&lt;br /&gt;This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanuatu has a long rainy season, with significant rainfall almost every month. The wettest and hottest months are December through April, which also constitutes the cyclone season. The driest months are June through November.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; Rainfall averages about {{convert|2360|mm|in}} per year but can be as high as {{convert|4000|mm|in}} in the northern islands.&lt;ref name="SOPAC"/&gt; In 2015, the United Nations University gave Vanuatu the highest [[List of countries by natural disaster risk|natural disaster risk]] of all the countries it measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldriskreport.org/|title=WorldRiskIndex 2015|publisher=United Nations University|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tropical cyclones====
{{Details|Cyclone Pam#Effects in Vanuatu}}

In March 2015, [[Cyclone Pam]] impacted much of Vanuatu as a Category&amp;nbsp;5 severe tropical cyclone, causing extensive damage to all the islands and deaths. {{as of|2015|March|17}} the United Nations said the official death toll was 11 (six from [[Efate]] and five from [[Tanna (island)|Tanna]]), and 30&amp;nbsp;were reported injured; these numbers are expected to rise as more remote islands are reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Stephen Coates |agency=Reuters |date=17 March 2015 |accessdate=18 March 2015 |title=Rescue teams reach cyclone-hit Vanuatu islands, official toll lowered |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/17/us-weather-vanuatu-cyclone-idUSKBN0MC1ZY20150317}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cyclone devastates South Pacific islands of Vanuatu |url=http://bbc.com/news/world-asia-31883712 |date=14 March 2015 |work=BBC News|accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyclone Pam is possibly the worst [[natural disaster]] in Vanuatu's history. Vanuatu lands minister, [[Ralph Regenvanu]] said, "This is the worst disaster to affect Vanuatu ever as far as we know."&lt;ref name=guardian-worst&gt;{{cite web |author=Joshua Robertson |work=The Guardian |date=15 March 2015 |accessdate=18 March 2015 |title=Cyclone Pam: Vanuatu awaits first wave of relief and news from worst-hit islands |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/cyclone-pam-death-toll-may-reach-50-in-port-vila-alone-as-full-impact-still-unknown}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of Vanuatu}}
[[File:Vanuatu Parliament, Port Vila - Flickr - PhillipC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Vanuatu's parliament]]

The Republic of Vanuatu is a [[parliamentary democracy]] with a [[Constitution of Vanuatu|written constitution]], which declares that the "head of the Republic shall be known as the President and shall symbolise the unity of the nation." The powers of the [[President of Vanuatu]], who is elected for a five-year term by a two-thirds vote of an electoral college, are primarily ceremonial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Government of the Republic of Vanuatu| year = 1983|url = http://vanuatugovernment.gov.vu/government/library/constitution.html|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430172100/http://vanuatugovernment.gov.vu/government/library/constitution.html|archivedate = 30 April 2009|title = Constitution of the Republic of Vanuatu|accessdate = 26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electoral college consists of members of Parliament and the presidents of Regional Councils. The President may be removed by the electoral college for gross misconduct or incapacity.

The [[Prime Minister of Vanuatu|Prime Minister]], who is the [[head of government]], is elected by a majority vote of a three-quarters [[quorum]] of the Parliament. The Prime Minister, in turn, appoints the Council of Ministers, whose number may not exceed a quarter of the number of parliamentary representatives. The Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers constitute the executive government.

The [[Parliament of Vanuatu]] is [[unicameral]] and has 52 members,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paclii.org/cgi-bin/sinodisp/vu/legis/consol_sub/rotpcas654/rotpcas654.html?stem=&amp;synonyms=&amp;query=members%20of%20parliament Representation of the People (Parliamentary Constituencies and Seats)].&lt;/ref&gt; who are elected by popular vote every four years unless earlier dissolved by a majority vote of a three-quarters quorum or by a directive from the President on the advice of the Prime Minister. The national Council of Chiefs, called the ''[[Malvatu Mauri]]'' and elected by district councils of chiefs, advises the government on all matters concerning ni-Vanuatu culture and language.

Besides national authorities and figures, Vanuatu also has high-placed people at the village level. Chiefs continue to be the leading figures at the village level. It has been reported that even politicians need to oblige them.&lt;ref name="Lonely Planet:Vanuatu"&gt;Lonely Planet:Vanuatu&lt;/ref&gt; One becomes such a figure by holding a number of lavish feasts (each feast allowing them a higher ceremonial grade) or alternatively through inheritance (the latter only in Polynesian-influenced villages). In northern Vanuatu, feasts are graded through the nimangki-system.

Government and society in Vanuatu tend to divide along linguistic French and English lines. Forming [[coalition government]]s, however, has proved problematic at times due to differences between English and French speakers. Francophone politicians like those of the [[Union of Moderate Parties]] tend to be conservative and support neo-liberal policies, as well as closer relations with France and the West. The anglophone [[Vanua'aku Pati]] identifies as socialist and anti-colonial.

The [[Supreme Court of Vanuatu|Supreme Court]] consists of a chief justice and up to three other judges. Two or more members of this court may constitute a Court of Appeal. Magistrate courts handle most routine legal matters. The legal system is based on [[Common law|British common law]] and [[French civil law]]. The [[Constitution of Vanuatu|constitution]] also provides for the establishment of village or island courts presided over by chiefs to deal with questions of [[Custom (law)|customary law]].

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Vanuatu}}
Vanuatu has joined the [[Asian Development Bank]], the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]], the ''[[Agence de Coopération Culturelle et Technique]]'', ''la [[Francophonie]]'' and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

Since 1980, Australia, the United Kingdom, France and New Zealand have provided the bulk of Vanuatu's development aid. Direct aid from the UK to Vanuatu ceased in 2005 following the decision by the UK to no longer focus on the Pacific.

More recently, new donors such as the [[Millennium Challenge Account]] (MCA) of the United States and the [[China|People's Republic of China]] have been providing increased amounts of aid funding and loans. In 2005 the MCA announced that Vanuatu was one of the first 15 countries in the world selected to receive support — an amount of US$65&amp;nbsp;million was given for the provision and upgrading of key pieces of [[public infrastructure]].

In 2018, newspaper reports from Australia indicated growing concern about the level of Chinese investment in Vanuatu, with over 50% of the country's debt of $440 million owed to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/on-the-ground-in-vanuatu-monuments-to-china-s-growing-influence-are-everywhere-20180410-p4z8t0.html|title=On the ground in Vanuatu, monuments to China's growing influence are everywhere|last=Wroe|first=David|date=2018-04-10|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concern was focused on the possibility China would use Vanuatu's potential inability to repay debt as leverage to bargain for control of, or [[People's Liberation Army]] presence at, [[Luganville]] Wharf. China loaned and funded the $114 million redevelopment of the wharf which has already been constructed with capability to dock naval vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/china-eyes-vanuatu-military-base-in-plan-with-global-ramifications-20180409-p4z8j9.html|title=China eyes Vanuatu military base in plan with global ramifications|last=Wroe|first=David|date=2018-04-09|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanuatu retains strong economic and cultural ties to Australia, the [[European Union]] (in particular France and UK) and New Zealand. Australia now provides the bulk of external assistance, including the police force, which has a paramilitary wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationmaster.com/country/nh-vanuatu/mil-military |title=Military statistics&amp;nbsp;– How Vanuatu ranks |publisher=NationMaster |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no Vanuatu High Commission or other Vanuatu Government office in Britain, but the British Friends of Vanuatu,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-friends-of-vanuatu.com/index.html The British Friends of Vanuatu] website&lt;/ref&gt; based in London, provides support for Vanuatu visitors to the UK, and can often offer advice and contacts to persons seeking information about Vanuatu or wishing to visit, and welcomes new members (not necessarily resident in the UK) interested in Vanuatu. The association's Charitable Trust funds small scale assistance in the education and training sector.

Vanuatu is not a member of [[Interpol]], along with 11 other countries mainly in Oceania.

===Administrative divisions===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
{{Main|Provinces of Vanuatu}}
[[File:Vanuatu Provinces.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Provinces of Vanuatu]]

Vanuatu has been divided into six provinces since 1994. The names in English of all provinces are derived from the initial letters of their constituent islands:

* [[Malampa Province|Malampa]] ('''Mal'''akula, '''Am'''brym, '''Pa'''ama)
* [[Penama Province|Penama]] ('''Pen'''tecost, '''Am'''bae, '''Ma'''ewo&amp;nbsp;– in French: Pénama)
* [[Sanma Province|Sanma]] ('''San'''to, '''Ma'''lo)
* [[Shefa Province|Shefa]] ('''Sh'''epherds group, '''Efa'''te&amp;nbsp;– in French: Shéfa)
* [[Tafea Province|Tafea]] ('''T'''anna, '''A'''niwa, '''F'''utuna, '''E'''rromango, '''A'''neityum&amp;nbsp;– in French: Taféa)
* [[Torba Province|Torba]] ('''Tor'''res Islands, '''Ba'''nks Islands)

Provinces are autonomous units with their own popularly elected local parliaments known officially as provincial councils. They collect local taxes and make by-laws in local matters like tourism, the provincial budget or the provision of some basic services. They are headed by a chairman elected from among the members of the local parliaments and assisted by a secretary appointed by the [[Civil service commission|Public Service Commission]].

Their executive arm consists of a provincial government headed by an executive officer who is appointed by the Prime Minister with the advice of the minister of local government. The provincial government is usually formed by the party that has the majority in the provincial council and, like the national government, is advised in Ni-Vanuatu culture and language by the local council of chiefs. The provincial president is constitutionally a member of the electoral college that elects the President of Vanuatu.

The provinces are in turn divided into municipalities (usually consisting of an individual island) headed by a council and a mayor elected from among the members of the council.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Vanuatu}}
[[File:Vanuatu Exports Treemap (2009)..jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|A proportional representation of Vanuatu's exports]]
[[File:PortVilaMarketHall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|A market hall in Port Vila]]

The four mainstays of the economy are agriculture, tourism, offshore [[financial services]], and [[cattle raising|raising cattle]]. There is substantial fishing activity, although this industry does not bring in much foreign exchange. Exports include [[copra]], [[kava]], beef, cocoa and timber, and imports include machinery and equipment, foodstuffs and fuels. In contrast, mining activity is unsubstantial.

Although manganese mining halted in 1978, there was an agreement in 2006 to export manganese already mined but not yet exported. The country has no known petroleum deposits. A small light-industry sector caters to the local market. Tax revenues come mainly from import duties and a 15% [[Value Added Tax|VAT]] on goods and services. Economic development is hindered by dependence on relatively few commodity exports, vulnerability to natural disasters, and long distances between constituent islands and from main markets.

Agriculture is used for consumption as well as for export. It provides a living for 65% of the population. In particular, production of copra and kava create substantial revenue. Many farmers have been abandoning cultivation of food crops, and use earnings from kava cultivation to buy food.&lt;ref name="Lonely Planet:Vanuatu"/&gt; Kava has also been used in ceremonial exchanges between clans and villages.&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 33&amp;nbsp;– 5.2)&lt;/ref&gt; Cocoa is also grown for foreign exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 49&amp;nbsp;– 7.2)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the number of households engaged in fishing was 15,758, mainly for consumption (99%), and the average number of weekly fishing trips was 3.&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 77&amp;nbsp;– 13.1)&lt;/ref&gt; The tropical climate enables growing of a wide range of fruits and vegetables and spices, including banana, garlic, cabbage, peanuts, pineapples, sugarcane, taro, yams, watermelons, leaf spices, carrots, radishes, eggplants, vanilla (both green and cured), pepper, cucumber and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 114&amp;nbsp;– table 4.17)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the value (in terms of millions of [[vatu]]&amp;nbsp;– the official currency of Vanuatu), for agricultural products, was estimated for different products: kava (341 million vatu), copra (195), cattle (135), crop gardens (93), cocoa (59), forestry (56), fishing (24) and coffee (12).&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (various pages)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Tourism}}
Tourism brings in much-needed foreign exchange. Vanuatu is widely recognised as one of the premier vacation destinations for scuba divers wishing to explore coral reefs of the South Pacific region.{{sfn|Harris|2006}} A further significant attraction to scuba divers is the wreck of the US ocean liner and converted troop carrier ''[[SS President Coolidge]]'' on [[Espiritu Santo]] island. Sunk during World War II, it is one of the largest shipwrecks in the world that is accessible for recreational diving. Tourism increased 17% from 2007 to 2008 to reach 196,134 arrivals, according to one estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/documents/fact_sheets/van.asp|title=Asian Development Bank &amp; Vanuatu&amp;nbsp;– Fact Sheet (pdf file)|publisher=Asian Development Bank|date=31 December 2008|accessdate=26 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403190139/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Fact_Sheets/VAN.asp|archive-date=3 April 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008 total is a sharp increase from 2000, in which there were only 57,000 visitors (of these, 37,000 were from Australia, 8,000 from New Zealand, 6,000 from New Caledonia, 3,000 from Europe, 1,000 from North America, 1,000 from Japan. (Note: figures rounded to the nearest thousand)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Vanuatu Statistics Office |year=2001 |url=http://www.vanuatustatistics.gov.vu/About%20VNSO/Data/Social/Tour&amp;Mig.htm |title=Tourism and Migration Statistics&amp;nbsp;– Visitor Arrivals by Usual Country of Residence (1995–2001) |accessdate=26 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429004619/http://www.vanuatustatistics.gov.vu/About%20VNSO/Data/Social/Tour%26Mig.htm |archivedate=29 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourism has been promoted, in part, by Vanuatu being the site of several reality-TV shows. The ninth season of the reality TV series ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]'' was filmed on Vanuatu, entitled ''[[Survivor: Vanuatu]]—Islands of Fire''. Two years later, Australia's ''[[Celebrity Survivor]]'' was filmed at the same location used by the US version. In mid-2002, the government stepped up efforts to boost tourism.

Financial services are an important part of the economy. Vanuatu is a [[tax haven]] that until 2008 did not release account information to other governments or law-enforcement agencies. International pressure, mainly from Australia, influenced the Vanuatu government to begin adhering to international norms to improve transparency. In Vanuatu, there is no [[income tax]], [[withholding tax]], [[capital gains tax]], [[inheritance tax]], or exchange control. Many international ship-management companies choose to flag their ships under the Vanuatu flag, because of the tax benefits and favourable labour laws (Vanuatu is a full member of the [[International Maritime Organization]] and applies its international conventions). Vanuatu is recognised as a "[[flag of convenience]]" country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itfglobal.org/flags-convenience/flags-convenien-183.cfm |title=International Transport Workers' Federation: FOC Countries |publisher=Itfglobal.org |date=6 June 2005 |accessdate=29 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718210353/http://www.itfglobal.org/flags-convenience/flags-convenien-183.cfm |archivedate=18 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several file-sharing groups, such as the providers of the [[KaZaA]] network of [[Sharman Networks]] and the developers of [[WinMX]], have chosen to incorporate in Vanuatu to avoid regulation and legal challenges. In response to foreign concerns the government has promised to tighten regulation of its [[offshore financial centre]]. Vanuatu receives [[foreign aid]] mainly from Australia and New Zealand.

Vanuatu became the 185th member of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailypost.vu/content/vanuatu-185th-member-wipo |title=Vanuatu is 185th member of WIPO|first1=Len Garae| last1=Vanuatu Daily Post |date=22 December 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Commercial agriculture, North Efate.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Commercial agriculture]], North Efate]]
Raising cattle leads to beef production for export. One estimate in 2007 for the total value of cattle heads sold was 135 million vatu; cattle were first introduced into the area from Australia by British planter James Paddon.&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 67&amp;nbsp;– 11.1)&lt;/ref&gt; On average, each household has 5 pigs and 16 chickens, and while cattle are the "most important livestock", pigs and chickens are important for subsistence agriculture as well as playing a significant role in ceremonies and customs (especially pigs).&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 73&amp;nbsp;– 12.1)&lt;/ref&gt; There are 30 commercial farms (sole proprietorships (37%), partnerships (23%), corporations (17%)), with revenues of 533&amp;nbsp;million vatu and expenses of 329&amp;nbsp;million vatu in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 97&amp;nbsp;– 15.1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Earthquakes can negatively affect economic activity on the island nation. A severe earthquake in November 1999, followed by a [[tsunami]], caused extensive damage to the northern island of [[Pentecost Island|Pentecost]], leaving thousands homeless. Another powerful earthquake in January 2002 caused extensive damage in the capital, Port Vila, and surrounding areas, and was also followed by a tsunami. Another earthquake of 7.2 struck on 2 August 2007.&lt;ref name="USGS7.2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2007fmba.php |title=Magnitude 7.2&amp;nbsp;– Vanuatu |work=USGS Earthquake Hazards Program |accessdate=13 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810090904/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2007fmba.php |archivedate=10 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vanuatu National Statistics Office (VNSO) released their 2007 agricultural census in 2008. According to the study, agricultural exports make up about three-quarters (73%) of all exports; 80% of the population lives in rural areas where "agriculture is the main source of their livelihood"; and of these households, almost all (99%) engaged in agriculture, fisheries and forestry.&lt;ref name="spc.int"&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 18)&lt;/ref&gt; Total annual household income was 1,803 million [[vatu]]. Of this income, agriculture grown for their own household use was valued at 683 million vatu, agriculture for sale at 561, gifts received at 38, handicrafts at 33 and fisheries (for sale) at 18.&lt;ref name="spc.int"/&gt;

The largest expenditure by households was food (300&amp;nbsp;million vatu), followed by household appliances and other necessities (79&amp;nbsp;million vatu), transportation (59), education and services (56), housing (50), alcohol and tobacco (39), clothing and footwear (17).&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 19 table 2.5)&lt;/ref&gt; Exports were valued at 3,038&amp;nbsp;million vatu, and included copra (485), kava (442), cocoa (221), beef (fresh and chilled) (180), timber (80) and fish (live fish, aquarium, shell, button) (28).&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 19&amp;nbsp;– table 2.6)&lt;/ref&gt; Total imports of 20,472&amp;nbsp;million vatu included industrial materials (4,261), food and drink (3,984), machinery (3,087), consumer goods (2,767), transport equipment (2,125), fuels and lubricants (187) and other imports (4,060).&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 20&amp;nbsp;– Table 2.7)&lt;/ref&gt; There are substantial numbers of crop gardens&amp;nbsp;– 97,888 in 2007&amp;nbsp;– many on flat land (62%), slightly hilly slope (31%), and even on steep slopes (7%); there were 33,570 households with at least one crop garden, and of these, 10,788 households sold some of these crops over a twelve-month period.&lt;ref&gt;Census of Agriculture 2007 (page 27&amp;nbsp;– Table 4.1)&lt;/ref&gt;

The economy grew about 6% in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Asian Development Bank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.org/documents/fact_sheets/van.asp|title=Asian Development Bank &amp; Vanuatu&amp;nbsp;– Fact Sheet&amp;nbsp;– Operational Challenges (pdf file)|publisher=Asian Development Bank|date=31 December 2008|accessdate=26 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403190139/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Fact_Sheets/VAN.asp|archive-date=3 April 2007|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is higher than in the 1990s, when GDP rose less than 3%, on average.

One report from the [[Manila]]-based [[Asian Development Bank]] about Vanuatu's economy gave mixed reviews. It noted the economy was "expanding", noting that the economy grew at an impressive 5.9% rate from 2003 to 2007, and lauded "positive signals regarding reform initiatives from the government in some areas" but described certain binding constraints such as "poor infrastructure services". Since a private monopoly generates power, "electricity costs are among the highest in the Pacific" among developing countries. The report also cited "weak governance and intrusive interventions by the State" which reduced productivity.&lt;ref name="Asian Development Bank"/&gt;

Vanuatu was ranked the 173rd safest investment destination in the world in the March 2011 Euromoney Country Risk rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Euromoney Country Risk|url=http://www.euromoneycountryrisk.com/|work=Euromoney country Risk|publisher=Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Vanuatu was ranked the 84th most [[Index of Economic Freedom|economically free country]] by The Heritage Foundation and ''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref name="Economic Freedom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Rankings|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking|website=''heritage.org''|publisher=The Heritage Foundation|accessdate=20 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inhabitants of Vanuatu are called {{nobr|''[[ni-Vanuatu]]''}} in English, using a recent [[neologism|coinage]]. The ni-Vanuatu are primarily (98.5%) of [[Melanesia]]n descent, with the remainder made up of a mix of Europeans, Asians and other Pacific islanders. Three islands were historically colonised by [[Polynesian outlier|Polynesians]]. About 20,000 {{nobr|ni-Vanuatu}} live and work in New Zealand and Australia. In 2006 the [[New Economics Foundation]] and [[Friends of the Earth]] environmentalist group published the [[Happy Planet Index]], which analysed data on [[subjective life satisfaction|levels of reported happiness]], [[life expectancy]] and [[Ecological Footprint]], and they estimated Vanuatu to be the most ecologically efficient country in the world in achieving high well-being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Languages===
{{Main|Languages of Vanuatu}}

The national language of the Republic of Vanuatu is [[Bislama]]. The [[official language]]s are [[Bislama]], [[English language|English]] and French. The principal languages of education are English and French. The use of English or French as the formal language is split along political lines.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Bislama is a [[pidgin]] language, and now a [[creole language|creole]] in urban areas. Essentially combining a typically Melanesian grammar with a mostly English vocabulary, Bislama is now the [[lingua franca]] of the entire archipelago of Vanuatu, used by the majority of the population as a second language.

In addition, 113 [[languages of Vanuatu|indigenous languages]] are still actively spoken in Vanuatu.&lt;ref name="tourism" /&gt; The density of languages, per capita, is the highest of any nation in the world,{{sfn|Crowley|2000}} with an average of only 2,000 speakers per language. All [[vernacular]] languages of Vanuatu (i.e., excluding Bislama) belong to the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] branch of the Austronesian family.

In recent years, the use of Bislama as a first language has considerably encroached on indigenous languages, whose use in the population has receded from 73.1 to 63.2 percent between 1999 and 2009.{{sfn|François|2012|p=104}}

Christianity is the predominant [[religion in Vanuatu]], consisting of several denominations. The [[Presbyterian Church in Vanuatu]], adhered to by about one-third of the population, is the largest of them. [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] and [[Anglican]] are other common denominations, each claiming about 15% of the population.

Because of the modern goods that the military in the [[Second World War]] brought with them when they came to the islands, several [[cargo cult]]s developed.

Vanuatu culture retains a strong diversity through local regional variations and through foreign influence. Vanuatu may be divided into three major cultural regions. In the north, wealth is established by how much one can give away, through a [[grade-taking]] system. Pigs, particularly those with rounded [[tusk]]s, are considered a symbol of wealth throughout Vanuatu. In the centre, more traditional Melanesian cultural systems dominate. In the south, a system involving grants of title with associated privileges has developed.&lt;ref name="tourism"&gt;{{cite web| publisher = Vanuatu Tourism Office| url = http://www.vanuatutourism.com/vanuatu/export/sites/VTO/en/culture/culture.html| title = Culture of Vanuatu| accessdate = 16 July 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520205556/http://www.vanuatutourism.com/vanuatu/export/sites/VTO/en/culture/culture.html |archivedate = 20 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Young men undergo various coming-of-age ceremonies and rituals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elisabeth Hurtel |url=http://www.imagesud.com/photographie-art/?cat=21|title=Customs dances and ceremonies in Vanuatu|accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to initiate them into manhood, usually including [[circumcision]].

Most villages have a ''[[nakamal]]'' or village clubhouse which serves as a meeting point for men and as a place to drink ''[[kava]]''. Villages also have male- and female-only sections. These sections are situated all over the villages; in ''nakamals'', special spaces are provided for females when they are in their menstruation period.

There are few prominent ni-Vanuatu authors. [[Women's rights]] activist [[Grace Mera Molisa]], who died in 2002, achieved international notability as a descriptive poet.

The traditional [[music of Vanuatu]] is still thriving in the rural areas of Vanuatu. Musical instruments consist mostly of [[idiophone]]s: drums of various shape and size, [[slit gong]]s, [[Bamboo musical instruments|stamping tubes]], as well as [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattle]]s, among others. Another musical genre that has become widely popular during the 20th century in all areas of Vanuatu, is known as ''[[string band]]'' music. It combines guitars, [[ukulele]], and popular songs.

More recently the music of Vanuatu, as an industry, grew rapidly in the 1990s and several bands have forged a distinctive ni-Vanuatu identity. Popular genres of modern commercial music, which are currently being played in the urban areas include [[zouk]] music and [[reggaeton]]. Reggaeton, a variation of Dancehall Reggae spoken in the Spanish language, played alongside its own distinctive beat, is especially played in the local nightclubs of Port Vila with, mostly, an audience of Westerners and tourists.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Cuisine of Vanuatu}}

The [[cuisine of Vanuatu]] (''aelan kakae'') incorporates fish, root vegetables such as [[taro]] and [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s, fruits, and vegetables. Most island families grow food in their gardens, and food shortages are rare. Papayas, pineapples, mangoes, [[plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, and sweet potatoes are abundant through much of the year. Coconut milk and coconut cream are used to flavour many dishes. Most food is cooked using hot stones or through boiling and steaming; very little food is fried.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

The national dish of Vanuatu is the [[lap lap]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/correspondents/content/2008/s2528790.htm The secrets of Vanuatu's national dish, the Lap Lap]. Retrieved December 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
