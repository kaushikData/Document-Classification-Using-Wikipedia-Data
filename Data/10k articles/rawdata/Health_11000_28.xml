'''Aars water tower''' is a [[water tower]] located in [[Aars]] in [[Himmerland]], [[Denmark]]. The tower is built right in the middle of a very old water tank from where the city's original water supply went out. As it sounds, it was Aars's [[water tower]]. The building has many beautiful handicrafts. In the past the tower used to have a neon logo on top and the logo on top was the [[Cimbrian bull]] from Aars and [[Aars Municipality]] coat of arm/shild, but it was taken down. The tower was also a shop where you could buy yarn and many other things like tea cups. But the shop moved away from the tower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aars Vandtårn|url=http://www.aars.dk/aars-vandtaarn|website=Aars.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4032">'''Agar dilution''' is one of two methods (along with Broth Dilution) used by researchers to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of antibiotics. It is the dilution method most frequently used to test the effectiveness of new antibiotics when a few antibiotics are tested against a large panel of different bacteria.&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorian|first1=Victor|title=Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine|date=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HdA4dl8m_T4C&amp;pg=PA149}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|149}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wiegand|first1=Irith|last2=Hilpert|first2=Kai|last3=Hancock|first3=Robert E. W.|title=Agar and broth dilution methods to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antimicrobial substances|journal=Nature Protocols|date=17 January 2008 |volume=3|page=163|doi=10.1038/nprot.2007.521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
The antibiotic to be tested is diluted with water to produce a series of concentrations. An appropriate volume is then combined with melted agar to produce plates in which the final antibiotic concentrations represent a 2-fold dilution series.  After this, bacteria prepared to a standard concentration are added as a spot to each plate, with 10^4 colony forming units (CFU) per spot. This technique allows for replicate spots of one bacterial type to be tested &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=European Committee for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Disease|title=Determination of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of antibacterial agents by agar dilution|journal=Clinical Microbiology and Infection|date=September 2000|volume=6|issue=9|pages=509–515|doi=10.1046/j.1469-0691.2000.00142.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; or spots of different bacteria so that the MIC of the antibiotic against multiple types of bacteria can be tested. Necessary controls include a control plate that does not receive any antibiotics and bacterial spread plates demonstrating that the bacterial inocula are in the correct concentration range. The dilution plates are then incubated at a temperature of 37 degrees [[Celsius]].&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parija|title=Textbook of Microbiology &amp; Immunology|date=2009|publisher=Elsevier India|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HcgGLfxDJSQC&amp;pg=PA73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plates are then incubated for sixteen to eighteen hours, although incubation time may be less for bacteria populations that divide quickly.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;{{rp|374}} After incubation, the plates are examined to determine if bacterial growth has occurred in the inoculated spots. The lowest concentration of antibiotics that prevented bacterial growth is considered to be the minimum inhibitory concentration of that antibiotic against that bacterium.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;

==Advantages==
Agar dilution is considered to be the [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] of susceptibility testing, or the most accurate way to measure the resistance of bacteria to antibiotics. The results of agar dilution are easily reproduced and they can be monitored at a much cheaper cost than what is required of other dilution methods. Additionally, up to thirty pathogen samples (plus two controls) can be tested at once, so agar dilution is useful for batch tests.
&lt;ref name=c/&gt;{{rp|149}}

==Disadvantages==
Each dilution plate in agar testing has to be manually inoculated with the pathogen to be tested, so agar dilution testing is both labor-intensive and expensive.&lt;ref name=c/&gt;{{rp|149}} Unlike [[broth microdilution]] tests, agar dilution cannot be used to test more than one antibiotic at a time.

The '''Anglo-Russian Hospital''' was a hospital in [[Petrograd]] set up during the [[First World War]]. It was called 'The (British) Empire's Gift to Our Russian Allies' and was founded in 1915 and was closed in 1918.

Lady [[Muriel Paget]] and Lady Sybil Grey helped raise the funds to keep the hospital, located in what is now the [[Beloselsky-Belozersky Palace]], running and set up several [[field hospital]]s along the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. Pioneering [[neurosurgeon]] [[Geoffrey Jefferson]] served here for about 18 months between 1916-1918.
The hospital was visited by [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Tsarina Alexandra]] and her daughters, and [[Prince Felix Yusupov]] is reported to have had to have a fish bone removed from his throat here a few hours after the murder on [[Rasputin]].&lt;ref&gt;Harmer, Michael, ''The Forgotten Hospital'', Springwood Books, 1982, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital closed not long after the [[October Revolution]] and the staff were evacuated to [[England]].

The '''Atlantis Plastics shooting''' was an incident of [[mass murder]] that took place at an [[Atlantis Plastics]] [[factory]] in [[Henderson, Kentucky|Henderson]], [[Kentucky]], [[United States]] on June 25, 2008. The gunman, 25-year-old Wesley Neal Higdon, shot and killed five people and critically injured a sixth person before taking his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hCQpscfc_M8JtSecCWwa2c9zp7mQD91H5ONG0 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |first=Ryan |last=Lenz |title=6 dead in Henderson, Ky., plastics plant shooting|date=2008-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628081721/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hCQpscfc_M8JtSecCWwa2c9zp7mQD91H5ONG0 |archivedate=June 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The shooting is the worst in the history of [[Henderson County, Kentucky]] in terms of casualties, surpassing triple homicides occurring in 1799 and 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2008/jun/25/shooting-worst-homicide-here/?gleaner=1/|publisher=''[[Henderson Gleaner]]''|date=2008-06-26|first=Beth|last=Smith|title=Rampage at Atlantis Plastics ends with six dead}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
Henderson police said that the shooter, who had a reputation for being difficult, had argued with supervisor Kevin Taylor and was being escorted out of the factory by the supervisor. The shooter apparently retrieved a handgun, shot the supervisor, then went back into the factory and shot five co-workers before turning the gun on himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=5242853&amp;page=1|publisher=ABC News|date=2008-06-25|first=Russell|last=Goldman|title=Six Killed in Factory Shooting, Including Gunman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080625/NEWS01/80625001|publisher=''[[The Courier-Journal]]''|date=2008-06-25|title=Factory rampage that kills 6 may have been planned|first=Jason|last=Riley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/marketsNews/idUSN2542255220080625|publisher=[[Reuters]]|title=Six dead in Kentucky factory shooting|date=2008-06-25 | first=Michael | last=Conlon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent reports indicate that Taylor had reprimanded Higdon twice before the shooting, once for talking on his [[cell phone]] too much and for not wearing safety glasses, then later for an altercation with co-worker Joshua Hinojosa at a [[convenience store]] across the street from the factory.

The victims were all shot with a [[Hi-Point Model JHP]] [[.45 ACP|.45-caliber]] [[pistol]]. Taylor was apparently shot by Higdon outside the factory, then four more workers in the factory's break room, and finally Hinojosa from behind on the factory floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2008/jun/26/rampage-atlanits-plastics-ends-six-dead/|publisher=''[[Henderson Gleaner]]''|date=2008-06-26|first=Frank|last=Boyett|title=Shooting worst homicide here}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higdon then committed suicide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15957">'''Biological systems engineering''' or '''biosystems engineering''' is a broad-based [[engineering]] discipline with particular emphasis on [[biology]] and [[chemistry]]. It can be thought of as a subset of the broader notion of [[biological engineering]] or bio-technology though not in the respects that pertain to [[biomedical engineering]] as ''biosystems'' engineering tends to focus less on medical applications than on ''agriculture, ecosystems, and food science''. It involves aspects of [[genetic engineering]], particularly regarding the agricultural applications. The discipline focuses broadly on environmentally sound and sustainable engineering solutions to meet societies' ecologically-related needs. Biosystems engineering integrates the expertise of fundamental engineering fields with expertise from non-engineering disciplines.

==Background and organization==
Many college and university [[biological engineering]] departments have a history of being grounded in [[agricultural engineering]] and have only in the past two decades or so changed their names to reflect the movement towards more diverse biological based engineering programs.&lt;ref&gt;For example the [http://www.bse.vt.edu/department/ Department of Biological Systems Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040401231525/http://www.bse.vt.edu/department/ |date=2004-04-01 }} at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University was established as agricultural engineering in 1920, and renamed in 1992 to reflect new focus areas in the teaching, research and extension programs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Department of Biological Systems Engineering at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln began within Mechanical Engineering, awarded its first degree in Agricultural Engineering in 1908, and changed its name to Biological Systems Engineering in 1990.  http://engineering.unl.edu/bse/history/&lt;/ref&gt;  This major is sometimes called agricultural and biological engineering, biological and environmental engineering, etc., in different universities, generally reflecting interests of local employment opportunities.

Since biological engineering covers a wide spectrum, many departments now offer specialization options. Depending on the department and the specialization options offered within each program, curricula may overlap with other related fields. There are a number of different titles for BSE-related departments at various universities.  The professional societies commonly associated with many Biological Engineering programs include the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]] (ASABE)&lt;ref&gt;Website [http://www.asabe.org/ American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]&lt;/ref&gt; and the  [[Institute of Biological Engineering]] (IBE),&lt;ref&gt;Website [http://www.ibe.org/ Institute of Biological Engineers]&lt;/ref&gt; which generally encompasses BSE.  Some program also participate in the Biomedical Engineering Society (BMES) &lt;ref&gt;Website [http://bmes.org/ Biomedical Engineering Society],&lt;/ref&gt; and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE).&lt;ref&gt;Website [http://www.aiche.org/ American Institute of Chemical Engineers],&lt;/ref&gt;

A biological systems engineer has a background in what both environmental engineers and biologists do, thus bridging the gap between engineering and the (non-medical) biological sciences – although this is variable across academic institutions. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}  For this reason, biological systems engineers are becoming integral parts of many environmental engineering firms, federal agencies, and [[biotechnology]] industries.  A biological systems engineer will often address the solution to a problem from the perspective of employing living systems to enact change.  For example, biological treatment methodologies can be applied to provide access to clean drinking water &lt;ref&gt;Website http://www.jbioleng.org/content/5/1/2/ Biological approaches for addressing the grand challenge of providing access to clean drinking water&lt;/ref&gt; or for sequestration of carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;Website http://www.jbioleng.org/content/5/1/14/ Addressing the Grand Challenge of atmospheric carbon dioxide: geologic sequestration vs. biological recycling&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 28, 2018, a [[mass shooting]] occurred at the offices of ''[[The Capital]]'', a newspaper serving [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]], [[Maryland]]. The gunman, Jarrod Ramos, shot and killed five employees with a [[shotgun]]. Two others were injured while trying to escape. Ramos was arrested shortly after and is currently imprisoned while awaiting trial for the shooting.&lt;ref name="CNBC"/&gt;

The newspaper published an article in 2011 about Ramos being put on probation for harassing an acquaintance from high school through social media and email. Ramos, angered by the article, brought a [[defamation]] lawsuit against ''The Capital''; a judge later dismissed the suit. Ramos is alleged to have sent enraged letters and messages to the newspaper's offices about his threats to attack the office and its staff; no legal action was taken after the threats were received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/capital-gazette-shooting-suspect-sent-threatening-letters-newsroom-massacre-n888501|title=Capital Gazette shooting suspect sent chilling letters before newsroom massacre: police|publisher=NBC News|date=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Capital Gazette Communications, owned by [[Tronc]] through its subsidiary the Baltimore Sun Media Group, publishes the daily ''[[The Capital]]'' and the ''[[Maryland Gazette]]'' newspapers and the weeklies ''[[Bowie, Maryland|Bowie]] Blade-News'' and ''Crofton-West County Gazette''. Its offices are located at 888 Bestgate Road in [[Parole, Maryland|Parole]], an unincorporated area of [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]] just outside Annapolis (the place name assigned by the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]] for addresses in this area).&lt;ref name="Sun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-gazette-shooting-20180628-story.html|title=Shooting reported at Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, staff say|last=Rector|first=Kevin|date=June 28, 2018|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AboutUs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalgazette.com/about/cg-about-us-20140708-htmlstory.html|title=About Us|date=July 4, 2014|website=Capital Gazette|publisher=Capital Gazette Comunications|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Anne Arundel County Police Department]] reported that the shooting began around 2:34&amp;nbsp;pm ([[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]), resulting in five fatalities and the wounding of several other victims.&lt;ref name="WTOP"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hensley |first=Sarah Beth |date=June 28, 2018 |title=Injuries reported in active shooter incident at Capital Gazette building in Annapolis |url=https://wtop.com/anne-arundel-county/2018/06/active-shooting-incident-at-capital-gazette-building-in-annapolis/slide/1/ |publisher=[[WTOP-FM|WTOP]] |accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gunman barricaded the rear exit of the office to prevent people from escaping.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sources reported that the weapon was a "long gun" which would later be described as a 12-gauge pump-action [[shotgun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/annapolis-shooting-five-dead-in-shooting-at-capital-gazette-newspaper-in-maryland-suspect-in-custody-2018-06-28-live-updates/|title=5 dead in shooting at newspaper building in Maryland, suspect in custody|access-date=June 29, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/a21998213/annapolis-capital-gazette-shooting-jarod-ramos/|title=Every Newspaper Reporter Knows Jarrod Ramos|date=June 29, 2018|work=Esquire|access-date=June 29, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/gunman-kills-5-in-attack-targeting-maryland-newspaper/2018/06/28/7994d72c-7b33-11e8-ac4e-421ef7165923_story.html|title=Police called suspect in newsroom rampage no threat in 2013|last=Witte|first=Brian|date=June 29, 2018|work=Washington Post|access-date=June 30, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gunman used the weapon to shoot repeatedly after shooting out the office's glass door. Phil Davis, a courts and crime reporter at the site of the shooting for ''The Capital'', tweeted that the gunman "shot through the glass door to the office and opened fire on multiple employees".&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/maryland-newspaper-shooting/index.html|title=Shooting at Maryland newspaper|author1=Meg Wagner|author2=Veronica Rocha|date=June 28, 2018|publisher=CNN|accessdate=June 28, 2018|author3=Brian Ries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis also described the newspapers' offices as a "war zone" after the shooting and described hearing the gunman reload.&lt;ref name="Sun" /&gt; He said the male gunman was alone.&lt;ref name="Capital Gazette"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.capitalgazette.com/bs-md-gazette-shooting-20180628-story.html|title=Five dead, others 'gravely injured' in shooting at Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis|last1=Rector|first1=Kevin|date=June 28, 2018|work=Capital Gazette|accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal issues relating to the attack ===
Ramos has been charged with five counts of [[First-degree murder (United States law)|first-degree murder]], and ordered to be held without bail after he was determined to be a flight risk and a danger to the community.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; In July 2018, records showed Ramos was also charged with [[Attempted murder|attempted first-degree murder]] of the survivors of the attack along with first-degree murder.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/for_the_record/ac-cn-ramos-hearing-0730-story.html#|title=Capital Gazette homicide charges come to court Monday|last=Cook|first=Chase|work=capitalgazette.com|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also been placed on suicide watch while in custody of law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Suspect-in-Capital-Gazette-Shooting-to-Appear-in-Court-486922321.html|title=Gunman Was Methodical, Blocked Victims' Escape: Prosecutor|work=NBC4 Washington|access-date=June 30, 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his bail hearing, Ramos did not speak the entire time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In July 2018, the case was assigned to Circuit Court Judge Laura S. Kiessling.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; On August 20, 2018 Ramos was seen in court for a brief hearing, where he pled not guilty to all charges, with a deadline of October 24 for his lawyers to enter a revised plea of [[Insanity defense|not criminally responsible]]. The trial date was set for January 15, 2019,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/lawyers-for-capital-gazette-shooting-suspect-could-consider-insanity-plea|title=Lawyers for Capital Gazette shooting suspect could consider insanity plea|last=Rydell|first=John|work=WBFF|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later delayed to June 3, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/man-accused-in-newspaper-shootings-to-face-trial-next-june/|title=Man accused in newspaper shootings to face trial next June|publisher=The Seattle Times|date=November 15, 2018|accessdate=November 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Previous dispute with newspaper ===
In 2012, Ramos sued ''The Capital'' in a [[defamation]] case he brought over a 2011 newspaper article reporting on his guilty plea for [[Stalking|criminal harassment]].&lt;ref name="BaltSun" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ramossuit"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.capitalgazette.com/news/ph-ac-cn-jarrod-ramos-ruling-0923-20150922-story.html |title=Appellate court upholds ruling in favor of Capital-Gazette |last=Pratt |first=Tim |date=September 22, 2015 |work=Capital Gazette |access-date=June 28, 2018 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; After multiple appeals from Ramos, the defamation case against the newspaper was dismissed in 2015 by [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]] circuit court judge Maureen M. Lamasney, who ruled in favor of the paper because their reporting was based on publicly available records and Ramos had produced no evidence that the article was inaccurate.&lt;ref name="ramossuit" /&gt; Lamasney wrote in her court opinion that Ramos' complaint was "a fundamental failure to understand what defamation law is, and more particularly, what defamation law is not".&lt;ref name="ramossuit" /&gt; 

Former ''Capital'' editor and publisher Thomas Marquardt said Ramos began harassing the staff of the newspaper after the article on him was published in 2011.&lt;ref name="BaltSun"/&gt; In 2013, Marquardt contacted the Anne Arundel County Police Department about Ramos' behavior, but the department did not pursue the report.&lt;ref name="BaltSun"/&gt; Marquardt also consulted the newspaper's attorneys about filing a restraining order against Ramos, and recalled telling them, "This is a guy who is going to come in and shoot us."&lt;ref name="BaltSun"/&gt; After his lawsuit against the newspaper was dismissed, Ramos opened a [[Twitter]] account, which he used to attack the newspaper and taunt its owners and staff.&lt;ref name="BaltSun"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Becket |first1=Stefan |title=Jarrod Ramos, 38, identified as suspect in Annapolis shooting |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jarrod-ramos-annapolis-shooting-suspect-identified-maryland-shooting-capital-gazette-today-2018-06-28/ |website=CBS News |accessdate=June 29, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former FBI senior profiler speculated that Ramos was "an injustice collector", whom she described as "someone who goes through life...collect[ing] injustices, real or imagined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jarrod-ramos-annapolis-shooting-suspect-an-injustice-collector-former-fbi-profiler-says/|title=Annapolis shooting suspect "an injustice collector," former FBI profiler says|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramos reportedly previously sent threatening letters to the newspaper's former attorney, to the [[Maryland Court of Special Appeals]], and to Charles Moylan, Jr., the appellate judge who had ruled against Ramos in his defamation case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-ramos-letters-20180702-story.html |title=Capital Gazette suspect allegedly mailed threatening letters before Thursday's shooting |publisher=''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' |date=July 2, 2018 |first=Ian |last=Duncan |first2=Talia |last2=Richman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other lawsuits ===
Ramos' use of the criminal-justice system as a form of attempting to get his way was seen in at least two other cases. When he was dismissed from his job at the [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], over "suitability concerns", he sued the agency and won the case, yet was still dismissed from the agency. In 2009, a former classmate took out peace orders (used to prevent contact between people), followed by criminal harassment charges, which he lost.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In an affidavit, the harassment victim wrote, "I am physically afraid of Mr. Ramos, and that he may cause me serious physical injury and/or death."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== June 28 letters ===
On Thursday, June 28, police reported that Ramos sent letters to three people who had been involved in his defamation lawsuit, with a packet being received by ''The Capital's'' former attorney that included a letter addressed to Judge Moylan, who wrote the opinion upholding the dismissal of his defamation case. In it, he wrote, "Welcome, Mr. Moylan, to your unexpected legacy: YOU should have died...Friends forever, Jarrod W. Ramos."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The letter continues; "I further certify I then did proceed to the office of respondent Capital-Gazette Communications...with the objective of killing every person present."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/03/us/annapolis-capital-gazette-shooter-letter/index.html|title=Newspaper shooting suspect's letter says aim was 'killing every person present'|last=CNN|first=Mark Morales and Ray Sanchez,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the letters thought to have been written by the suspect was published by other news sources.

Police were also sent to the offices of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', which owns Capital Gazette Communications,&lt;ref name="Capital Gazette"/&gt; as a precaution, although no threat was registered there.&lt;ref name="Sun"/&gt; The [[New York City Police Department]] also deployed [[counter-terrorism]] units to the headquarters of major news outlets in New York City as a precaution against similar attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Steinberg |first=Brian |date=June 28, 2018 |title=NYPD Sends Officers to New York Media Outlets After Annapolis Shooting |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/annapolis-shooting-nypd-new-york-media-outlets-1202861115/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chicago Police Department]] took similar actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=June 28, 2018 |title=Police Sent To Media Outlets In Chicago After Maryland Newsroom Shooting |url=https://chicago.cbslocal.com/2018/06/28/police-sent-to-media-outlets-in-chicago-after-maryland-newsroom-shooting/ |publisher=[[WBBM-TV|CBS 2 Chicago]] |accessdate=June 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators have called the shooting an attack on the media, and framed it alongside comments by Trump that the "[[fake news]] media" (''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[CNN]], [[NBC News]]) are the "[[enemy of the people]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pope |first=Kyle |date=June 29, 2018 |title=The war against the press comes to the local newsroom |url=https://www.cjr.org/analysis/newspaper-shooting-maryland.php |work=[[Columbia Journalism Review]] |accessdate=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mayfield |first=Mandy |date=June 28, 2018 |title=Journalists call out Trump for anti-press rhetoric following Annapolis newsroom shooting |url=https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/journalists-call-out-trump-anti-press-rhetoric-annapolis-capital-gazette-shooting |work=[[Washington Examiner]] |accessdate=June 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kirell |first1=Andrew |last2=Arciga |first2=Julia |title=Trump Now Says Journalists Should Be ‘Free From Fear’ After Previously Calling Them ‘Enemies of the People’ |url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-now-says-journalists-should-be-free-from-fear-after-previously-calling-them-enemies-of-the-people |work=[[The Daily Beast]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monday before the shooting, Trump used the same "enemy" phrase to describe "fake newsers" journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baynes |first1=Chris |title=Maryland shooting: Trump ducks questions over Capital Gazette killings, as president's attacks on journalists come into focus |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/maryland-shooting-trump-reaction-video-questions-capital-gazette-fake-news-journalists-killed-a8422451.html |work=[[The Independent]] |accessdate=7 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunday after the shooting, the staff of the ''Capital Gazette'' wrote: "We won't forget being called an enemy of the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wise |first1=Justin |title=Capital Gazette staff: 'Keep reading, we've only just begun' |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/395051-capital-gazette-staff-keep-reading-weve-only-just-begun |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days before, right-wing commentator [[Milo Yiannopoulos]] wrote that he "can't wait for vigilante squads to start gunning journalists down on sight" in text messages to reporters.

Reporters for ''The Capital'' and ''Gazette'' began coverage of the shooting as it happened, from the newsroom and while returning from the field.

'''Cholesterol''' (from the [[Ancient Greek]] ''chole-'' ([[bile]]) and ''stereos'' (solid), followed by the [[chemical]] [[suffix]] ''-ol'' for an [[alcohol]]) is an [[organic compound|organic]] [[molecule]]. It is a [[sterol]] (or [[chemical modification|modified]] [[steroid]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{MeshName|Cholesterol|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a type of [[lipid]] molecule, and is [[biosynthesis|biosynthesized]] by all animal [[Cell (biology)#Eukaryotic cells|cells]], because it is an essential structural component of all [[animal]] [[cell membrane]]s.

In addition to its importance for animal cell structure, cholesterol also serves as a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]] for the biosynthesis of [[steroid hormone]]s, [[bile acid]]&lt;ref name="Hanukoglu_1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanukoglu I | title = Steroidogenic enzymes: structure, function, and role in regulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis | journal = J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol | volume = 43 | issue = 8 | pages = 779–804 | date = Dec 1992 | pmid = 22217824 | doi = 10.1016/0960-0760(92)90307-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[vitamin D]]. Cholesterol is the principal [[sterol]] synthesized by all animals. In [[vertebrate]]s, [[liver|hepatic]] cells typically produce the greatest amounts. It is absent among [[prokaryote]]s ([[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]), although there are some exceptions, such as ''[[Mycoplasma]]'', which require cholesterol for growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Razin S, Tully JG | title = Cholesterol Requirement of Mycoplasmas | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 102 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–310 | date = May 1970 | pmid = 4911537 | pmc = 247552 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Poulletier de la Salle]] first identified cholesterol in solid form in [[gallstone]]s in 1769. However, it was not until 1815 that chemist [[Michel Eugène Chevreul]] named the compound "cholesterine".&lt;ref&gt;Chevreul (1816) "Recherches chimiques sur les corps gras, et particulièrement sur leurs combinaisons avec les alcalis. Sixième mémoire. Examen des graisses d'homme, de mouton, de boeuf, de jaguar et d'oie" (Chemical researches on fatty substances, and particularly on their combinations o filippos ine kapios with alkalis. Sixth memoir. Study of human, sheep, beef, jaguar and goose fat), ''Annales de Chimie et de Physique'', '''2''' : 339–372. From [https://books.google.com/books?id=DHCz1nhhYL8C&amp;pg=PA346#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 346] : "Je nommerai ''cholesterine'', de χολη, bile, et στερεος, solide, la substance cristallisée des calculs biliares humains, ... " (I will name ''cholesterine'' — from χολη (bile) and στερεος (solid) — the crystalized substance from human gallstones ... )&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Olson_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olson RE | title = Discovery of the lipoproteins, their role in fat transport and their significance as risk factors | journal = J. Nutr. | volume = 128 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = 439S–443S | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9478044 | doi = 10.1093/jn/128.2.439S| url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9478044 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiology==
Since cholesterol is essential for all animal life, each cell is capable of synthesizing it by way of a complex 37-step process, beginning with the [[mevalonate pathway]] and ending with a 19-step conversion of [[lanosterol]] to cholesterol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}  Furthermore, it can be absorbed directly from animal-based foods.

A human male weighing 68&amp;nbsp;kg (150&amp;nbsp;lb) normally synthesizes about 1 gram (1,000&amp;nbsp;mg) per day, and his body contains about 35 g, mostly contained within the cell membranes. Typical daily cholesterol dietary intake for a man in the United States is 307&amp;nbsp;mg.&lt;ref name="cdc-calories"&gt;{{cite web | title = National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey | publisher = United States Center for Disease Control | url = https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhanes/databriefs/calories.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate = 2012-01-28}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Most ingested cholesterol is [[esterified]], and esterified cholesterol is poorly absorbed. The body also compensates for any absorption of additional cholesterol by reducing cholesterol synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Lecerf JM, de Lorgeril M | title = Dietary cholesterol: from physiology to cardiovascular risk | journal = Br J Nutr | volume = 106 | issue = 1 | pages = 6–14 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21385506 | doi = 10.1017/S0007114511000237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons, cholesterol in food, seven to ten hours after ingestion, has little, if any effect on concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. However, during the first seven hours after ingestion of cholesterol, as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various [[lipoprotein]]s (which transport all fats in the water outside cells), the concentrations increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dubois C, Armand M, Mekki N, Portugal H, Pauli AM, Bernard PM, Lafont H, Lairon D | title = Effects of increasing amounts of dietary cholesterol on postprandial lipemia and lipoproteins in human subjects | journal = Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 35 | issue = 1994 | pages = 1993–2007 | date = 1994 | pmid = 7868978 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also important to recognize, however, that the concentrations measured in the samples of blood plasma vary with the measurement methods used. Traditional, cheaper methods do not reflect (a) which lipoproteins are transporting the various fat molecules, nor (b) which cells are ingesting, burning or exporting the fat molecules being measured as totals from samples of blood plasma.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Cholesterol is [[Enterohepatic circulation|recycled]] in the body. The [[liver]] excretes it in a non-esterified form (via bile) into the digestive tract. Typically, about 95% of the excreted cholesterol is reabsorbed by the [[small intestine]] back into the bloodstream.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Plants make cholesterol in very small amounts.&lt;ref name="Plant cholesterol"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | last1 = Behrman | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Gopalan | first2 = Venkat | name-list-format = vanc | title=Cholesterol and Plants | editor-first= William M. | editor-last = Scovell | volume = 82 | number = 12 | year = 2005 | pages = 1791 | doi = 10.1021/ed082p1791|bibcode=2005JChEd..82.1791B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants manufacture [[phytosterol]]s (substances chemically similar to cholesterol), which can compete with cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption.&lt;ref name="John_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = John S, Sorokin AV, Thompson PD | title = Phytosterols and vascular disease | journal = Curr. Opin. Lipidol. | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–40 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17218830 | doi = 10.1097/MOL.0b013e328011e9e3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the [[GI tract]], an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant [[sterols]] and [[Stanol ester|stanols]], ranges between ~200–300&amp;nbsp;mg/day depending on eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jesch ED, Carr TP |title=Food Ingredients That Inhibit Cholesterol Absorption |journal=Prev Nutr Food Sci |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=67–80 |year=2017 |pmid=28702423 |pmc=5503415 |doi=10.3746/pnf.2017.22.2.67 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700&amp;nbsp;mg/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agren JJ, Tvrzicka E, Nenonen MT, Helve T, Hänninen O | title = Divergent changes in serum sterols during a strict uncooked vegan diet in patients with rheumatoid arthritis | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 85 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–9 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11242480 | doi = 10.1079/BJN2000234 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Function===
Cholesterol, given that it composes about 30% of all animal cell membranes, is required to build and maintain [[Cell membrane|membranes]] and modulates [[membrane fluidity]] over the range of physiological temperatures. The [[hydroxyl]] group on cholesterol interacts with the [[Polar molecules|polar]] heads of the [[lipid bilayer|membrane]] [[phospholipid]]s and [[sphingolipid]]s, while the bulky [[steroid]] and the [[hydrocarbon]] chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the [[Polar molecules#Nonpolar molecules|nonpolar]] [[Fatty acid|fatty-acid chain]] of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters membrane fluidity&lt;ref name="isbn1-4292-4646-4"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Sadava D, Hillis DM, Heller HC, Berenbaum MR | title = Life: The Science of Biology 9th Edition | publisher = Freeman | location = San Francisco | year = 2011 | pages = 105–114 | isbn = 978-1-4292-4646-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells do not need to build cell walls (like plants and most bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move.

The structure of the tetracyclic ring of cholesterol contributes to the fluidity of the cell membrane, as the molecule is in a ''trans'' conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and planar.&lt;ref name="Ohvo-Rekilä_2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ohvo-Rekilä H, Ramstedt B, Leppimäki P, Slotte JP | title = Cholesterol interactions with phospholipids in membranes | journal = Prog. Lipid Res. | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 66–97 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11694269 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-7827(01)00020-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this structural role, cholesterol also reduces the permeability of the plasma membrane to neutral solutes,&lt;ref name="Yeagle_1991"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeagle PL | title = Modulation of membrane function by cholesterol | journal = Biochimie | volume = 73 | issue = 10 | pages = 1303–10 | date = October 1991 | pmid = 1664240 | doi = 10.1016/0300-9084(91)90093-G }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hydrogen]] ions, and [[sodium]] ions.&lt;ref name="Haines_2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = [[Thomas H. Haines|Haines TH]] | title = Do sterols reduce proton and sodium leaks through lipid bilayers? | journal = Prog. Lipid Res. | volume = 40 | issue = 4 | pages = 299–324 | date = July 2001 | pmid = 11412894 | doi = 10.1016/S0163-7827(01)00009-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the cell membrane, cholesterol also functions in intracellular transport, cell signaling and nerve conduction. Cholesterol is essential for the structure and function of invaginated [[caveolae]] and [[clathrin]]-coated pits, including caveola-dependent and clathrin-dependent [[endocytosis]]. The role of cholesterol in endocytosis of these types can be investigated by using [[methyl beta cyclodextrin]] (MβCD) to remove cholesterol from the plasma membrane. Recent studies show that cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of [[lipid raft]]s in the [[plasma membrane]], which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules.&lt;ref name="Incardona_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Incardona JP, Eaton S | title = Cholesterol in signal transduction | journal = Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–203 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10712926 | doi = 10.1016/S0955-0674(99)00076-9 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a [[myelin]] sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of [[Schwann cell]] membrane, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-5056-3"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pawlina W, Ross MW | title = Histology: a text and atlas: with correlated cell and molecular biology | edition = | publisher = Lippincott Wiliams &amp; Wilkins | location = Philadelphia | year = 2006 | origyear = | pages = 230 | quote = | isbn = 978-0-7817-5056-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Demyelination]] (loss of some of these Schwann cells) is believed to be part of the basis for [[multiple sclerosis]].

Within cells, cholesterol is also a precursor molecule for several biochemical pathways. For example, it is the precursor molecule for the synthesis of [[vitamin D]] and all [[steroid hormones]], including the [[adrenal gland]] hormones [[cortisol]] and [[aldosterone]], as well as the sex hormones [[progesterone]], [[estrogen]]s, and [[testosterone]], and their derivatives.&lt;ref name="Hanukoglu_1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Payne_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Payne AH, Hales DB | title = Overview of steroidogenic enzymes in the pathway from cholesterol to active steroid hormones | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 947–70 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15583024 | doi = 10.1210/er.2003-0030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The liver excretes cholesterol into [[bile|biliary]] fluids, which is then stored in the [[gallbladder]]. Bile contains [[Bile acid|bile salts]], which solubilize fats in the digestive tract and aid in the intestinal absorption of fat molecules as well as the fat-soluble vitamins, [[Vitamin A|A]], [[Vitamin D|D]], [[Vitamin E|E]], and [[Vitamin K|K]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/liver/bile.html|title=Secretion of Bile and the Role of Bile Acids In Digestion|website=www.vivo.colostate.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosynthesis===
All animal cells manufacture cholesterol, for both membrane structure and other uses, with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function. About 80% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the [[liver]] and the [[intestines]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.health.harvard.edu/heart-health/how-its-made-cholesterol-production-in-your-body|title=How it’s made: Cholesterol production in your body  - Harvard Health|last=Publishing|first=Harvard Health|work=Harvard Health|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; other sites of higher synthesis rates include [[adrenal gland]]s, and [[reproductive organ]]s.

Synthesis within the body starts with the [[mevalonate pathway]] where two molecules of [[acetyl CoA]] condense to form [[acetoacetyl-CoA]]. This is followed by a second condensation between [[acetyl CoA]] and [[acetoacetyl-CoA]] to form [[3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA]] ([[HMG-CoA]]).&lt;ref name="Mehta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharmaxchange.info/press/2013/09/biosynthesis-and-regulation-of-cholesterol-animation/|title=Biosynthesis and Regulation of Cholesterol (with Animation)|website=PharmaXChange.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Condensation of Acetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

This molecule is then reduced to [[mevalonate]] by the enzyme [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. Production of [[mevalonate]] is the rate-limiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for [[statin]]s (a class of cholesterol lowering drugs).

[[File:Melavonic Acid Synthesis.gif|center|frameless|500px]]
Mevalonate is finally converted to [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (IPP) through two phosphorylation steps and one decarboxylation step that requires [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].

[[File:Melavonate pathway to IPP.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form [[farnesyl pyrophosphate]] through the action of geranyl transferase.

[[File:Cation formation from DMAPP.gif|center|frameless|500px]]
[[File:Formation of Farnasyl pyrophosphate.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form [[squalene]] by the action of [[squalene synthase]] in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref name="Mehta" /&gt; 
[[File:Squalene Synthesis.gif|center|frameless|500px]]
[[File:Squalene Synthesis 2.gif|center|frameless|500px]]

[[Oxidosqualene cyclase]] then cyclizes squalene to form [[lanosterol]]. Finally, lanosterol is converted to cholesterol through a 19-step process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Berg J |title = Biochemistry | year = 2002 | publisher = WH Freeman | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-7167-3051-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-2009-4"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Rhodes CM, Stryer L, Tasker R | title = Biochemistry | edition = 4th | publisher = W.H.

===Regulation of cholesterol synthesis===
Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present, though the [[homeostasis|homeostatic]] mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake from food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas lower intake from food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of [[intracellular]] cholesterol in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] by the [[protein]] [[sterol regulatory element binding protein|SREBP]] (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2).&lt;ref name="Espenshade_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Espenshade PJ, Hughes AL | title = Regulation of sterol synthesis in eukaryotes | journal = Annu. Rev. Genet. | volume = 41 | issue =  | pages = 401–27 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17666007 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.41.110306.130315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presence of cholesterol, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: [[SREBP cleavage-activating protein|SCAP]] (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) and [[INSIG-1]]. When cholesterol levels fall, INSIG-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the [[Golgi apparatus]]. Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 protease and site-2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low.

The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus, and acts as a [[transcription factor]] to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein ([[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]]) receptor and [[HMG-CoA reductase]]. The LDL receptor scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase of endogenous production of cholesterol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown MS, Goldstein JL | title = The SREBP pathway: regulation of cholesterol metabolism by proteolysis of a membrane-bound transcription factor | journal = Cell | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 331–40 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9150132 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80213-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. [[Michael S. Brown]] and Dr. [[Joseph L. Goldstein]] in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation.

Cholesterol synthesis can also be turned off when cholesterol levels are high. HMG-CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the [[proteosome]]. This enzyme's activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein [[kinase]]. Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-4955-6"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tymoczko | first1 = John L. | last2 = Berg | first2 = Tymoczko | last3 = Stryer | first3 = Lubert | last4 = Berg | first4 = Jeremy Mark | name-list-format = vanc | title = Biochemistry | edition = | publisher = W.H.

===Plasma transport and regulation of absorption===
{{See also|Blood lipids}}

[[File:MetabolismoLipidiE.png|thumb|Lipid logistics: transport of triglycerides and cholesterol in organisms in form of lipoproteins as chylomicrons, VLDL, LDL, IDL, HDL.]]
As an isolated molecule, cholesterol is only minimally soluble in [[water]]; it dissolves into the (water-based) bloodstream only at exceedingly small concentrations. Instead, cholesterol is transported within [[lipoprotein]]s, complex discoidal particles with exterior [[amphiphile|amphiphilic]] proteins and lipids, whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble; i.e. transport via [[emulsification]]. [[Triglyceride]]s and cholesterol esters are carried internally. Phospholipids and cholesterol, being amphipathic, are transported in the monolayer surface of the lipoprotein particle.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

There are several types of lipoproteins in the blood. In order of increasing density, they are [[chylomicron]]s, [[very-low-density lipoprotein]] (VLDL), [[intermediate-density lipoprotein]] (IDL), [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL), and [[high-density lipoprotein]] (HDL). Lower protein/lipid ratios make for less dense lipoproteins. Cholesterol within different lipoproteins is identical, although some is carried as its native "free" alcohol form (the cholesterol-OH group facing the water surrounding the particles), while others as fatty acyl esters, known also as cholesterol esters, within the particles.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Lipoprotein particles are organized by complex [[apolipoproteins]], typically 80–100 different proteins per particle, which can be recognized and bound by specific receptors on cell membranes, directing their lipid payload into specific cells and tissues currently ingesting these fat transport particles. Lipoprotein particles thus include a molecular addresses which play key roles in distribution and delivery of fats around the body in the water outside cells.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Chylomicrons, the least dense cholesterol transport molecules, contain [[apolipoprotein B-48]], [[apolipoprotein C]], and [[apolipoprotein E]] (the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27277824|year=2016|author1=Mahley|first1=R. W.|title=Apolipoprotein E: From cardiovascular disease to neurodegenerative disorders|journal=Journal of Molecular Medicine|volume=94|issue=7|pages=739–46|doi=10.1007/s00109-016-1427-y|pmc=4921111}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in their shells. Chylomicrons carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues in need of fatty acids for energy or fat production. Unused cholesterol remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants, and taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver.

VLDL molecules are produced by the liver from [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerol]] and cholesterol which was not used in the synthesis of bile acids. These molecules contain [[apolipoprotein B100]] and [[apolipoprotein E]] in their shells, and are degraded by [[lipoprotein lipase]] on the blood vessel wall to IDL.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Blood vessels cleave and absorb [[Triglyceride|triacylglycerol]] from IDL molecules, increasing the concentration of cholesterol. IDL molecules are then consumed in two processes: half is metabolized by [[HTGL]] and taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces, while the other half continues to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they become LDL molecules, with the highest concentration of cholesterol within them.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

LDL particles are the major blood cholesterol carriers. Each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. LDL molecule shells contain just one molecule of [[apolipoprotein B100]], recognized by [[LDL receptor]]s in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of [[apolipoprotein B100]], many LDL receptors concentrate in [[clathrin]]-coated pits. Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via [[endocytosis]]. These vesicles then fuse with a [[lysosome]], where the [[Lysosomal lipase|lysosomal acid lipase]] enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to not interfere with the cell membranes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

LDL receptors are used up during cholesterol absorption, and its synthesis is regulated by [[SREBP]], the same protein that controls the synthesis of cholesterol ''de novo'', according to its presence inside the cell. A cell with abundant cholesterol will have its LDL receptor synthesis blocked, to prevent new cholesterol in LDL molecules from being taken up. Conversely, LDL receptor synthesis proceeds when a cell is deficient in cholesterol.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

When this process becomes unregulated, LDL molecules without receptors begin to appear in the blood. These LDL molecules are oxidized and taken up by [[macrophages]], which become engorged and form foam cells. These foam cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to [[atheroma|atherosclerotic plaque]] formation. Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness).&lt;ref name="Weingärtner_2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weingärtner O, Pinsdorf T, Rogacev KS, Blömer L, Grenner Y, Gräber S, Ulrich C, Girndt M, Böhm M, Fliser D, Laufs U, Lütjohann D, Heine GH | title = The relationships of markers of cholesterol homeostasis with carotid intima-media thickness | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 10 | pages = e13467 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20976107 | pmc = 2956704 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0013467 | editor1-last = Federici | editor1-first = Massimo |bibcode = 2010PLoSO...513467W }}&lt;/ref&gt; These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a [[lipoprotein]]) with "bad" cholesterol.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-4955-6"/&gt;

===Metabolism, recycling and excretion===
Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives called [[oxysterol]]s. Three different mechanisms can form these: autoxidation, secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Kandutsch_1978"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kandutsch AA, Chen HW, Heiniger HJ | title = Biological activity of some oxygenated sterols | journal = Science | volume = 201 | issue = 4355 | pages = 498–501 | date = August 1978 | pmid = 663671 | doi = 10.1126/science.663671 |bibcode = 1978Sci...201..498K }}&lt;/ref&gt; This finding became known as the “oxysterol hypothesis”.

In biochemical experiments radiolabelled forms of cholesterol, such as tritiated-cholesterol are used.

Cholesterol binds to and affects the gating of a number of [[ion channel]]s such as the [[nicotinic acetylcholine receptor]], [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], and the [[inward-rectifier potassium ion channel]].&lt;ref name="LevitanSingh2014"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Levitan I, Singh DK, Rosenhouse-Dantsker A | title = Cholesterol binding to ion channels | journal = Frontiers in Physiology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 65 | year = 2014 | pmid = 24616704 | pmc = 3935357 | doi = 10.3389/fphys.2014.00065 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cholesterol also activates the [[estrogen-related receptor alpha]] (ERRα), and may be the [[endogenous]] [[ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]] for the [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]].&lt;ref name="WeiSchwaid2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei W, Schwaid AG, Wang X, Wang X, Chen S, Chu Q, Saghatelian A, Wan Y | title = Ligand Activation of ERRα by Cholesterol Mediates Statin and Bisphosphonate Effects | journal = Cell Metabolism | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 479–91 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26777690 | pmc = 4785078 | doi = 10.1016/j.cmet.2015.12.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsevier2017"&gt;{{cite book|title=Nuclear Receptors in Development and Disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvupDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|date=17 May 2017|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-0-12-802196-5|pages=88–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitutively active nature of the receptor may be explained by the fact that cholesterol is ubiquitous in the body.&lt;ref name="Elsevier2017" /&gt; Inhibition of ERRα signaling by reduction of cholesterol production has been identified as a key mediator of the effects of [[statin]]s and [[bisphosphonate]]s on [[bone]], [[muscle]], and [[macrophage]]s.&lt;ref name="WeiSchwaid2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsevier2017" /&gt; On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the ERRα should be de-orphanized and classified as a receptor for cholesterol.&lt;ref name="WeiSchwaid2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsevier2017" /&gt;

===Hypercholesterolemia===
{{Main|hypercholesterolemia|lipid hypothesis}}
[[File:ColesterolemiaMortalitaE.png|thumb|Cholesterolemia and mortality for men and women &lt;50 years and &gt;60 years]]
According to the [[lipid hypothesis]], since cholesterol (like all fat molecules) is transported around the body (in the [[Extracellular fluid|water outside cells]]) inside [[lipoprotein]] particles, elevated cholesterol concentrations ([[hypercholesterolemia]]) potentially offer a lower cost way to estimate concentrations of [[Low-density lipoprotein|LDL]] particles; possibly even low concentrations of functional [[High-density lipoprotein|HDL]] particles, both variations strongly associated with [[cardiovascular disease]] because LDL particles promote [[atheroma]] development in arteries ([[atherosclerosis]]).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

This atherosclerotic disease process, over decades, leads to [[myocardial infarction]] (heart attack), [[stroke]], and [[peripheral vascular disease]]. Since higher blood LDL, especially higher LDL particle concentrations and smaller LDL particle size, contribute to this process more than the cholesterol content of the HDL particles,&lt;ref name="Brunzell_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunzell JD, Davidson M, Furberg CD, Goldberg RB, Howard BV, Stein JH, Witztum JL | title = Lipoprotein management in patients with cardiometabolic risk: consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology Foundation | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 811–22 | date = April 2008 | pmid = 18375431 | doi = 10.2337/dc08-9018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; LDL particles are often termed "bad cholesterol" because they have been linked to atheroma formation. On the other hand, high concentrations of functional HDL, which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheroma, offer protection and are sometimes referred to as "good cholesterol". These balances are mostly genetically determined, but can be changed by body build, [[medication]]s, food choices,&lt;ref&gt;[http://heartuk.org.uk/cholesterol-and-diet/mediterranean-diet Department of Health (UK), NHS Choices, "''More evidence for Mediterranean diet''". 8 March 2011.] Access date: Nov 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and other factors.&lt;ref name="Durrington_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Durrington P | title = Dyslipidaemia | journal = Lancet | volume = 362 | issue = 9385 | pages = 717–31 | date = August 2003 | pmid = 12957096 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14234-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conditions with elevated concentrations of oxidized LDL particles, especially "small dense LDL" (sdLDL) particles, are associated with [[atheroma]] formation in the walls of [[artery|arteries]], a condition known as [[atherosclerosis]], which is the principal cause of [[coronary heart disease]] and other forms of [[cardiovascular disease]]. In contrast, HDL particles (especially large HDL) have been identified as a mechanism by which cholesterol and inflammatory mediators can be removed from atheroma. Increased concentrations of HDL correlate with lower rates of atheroma progressions and even regression. A 2007 study pooling data on almost 900,000 subjects in 61 cohorts demonstrated that blood total cholesterol levels have an exponential effect on cardiovascular and total mortality, with the association more pronounced in younger subjects. Still, because cardiovascular disease is relatively rare in the younger population, the impact of high cholesterol on health is still larger in older people.&lt;ref name="Lewington_2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lewington S, Whitlock G, Clarke R, Sherliker P, Emberson J, Halsey J, Qizilbash N, Peto R, Collins R | title = Blood cholesterol and vascular mortality by age, sex, and blood pressure: a meta-analysis of individual data from 61 prospective studies with 55,000 vascular deaths | journal = Lancet | volume = 370 | issue = 9602 | pages = 1829–39 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 18061058 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61778-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, the total cholesterol can be within normal limits, yet be made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles, under which conditions atheroma growth rates would still be high. Recently, a ''post hoc'' analysis of the IDEAL and the EPIC prospective studies found an association between high levels of HDL cholesterol (adjusted for apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, casting doubt on the cardioprotective role of "good cholesterol".&lt;ref name="van_der_Steeg_2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Steeg WA, Holme I, Boekholdt SM, Larsen ML, Lindahl C, Stroes ES, Tikkanen MJ, Wareham NJ, Faergeman O, Olsson AG, Pedersen TR, Khaw KT, Kastelein JJ | title = High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein particle size, and apolipoprotein A-I: significance for cardiovascular risk: the IDEAL and EPIC-Norfolk studies | journal = J.

The 1987 report of [[National Cholesterol Education Program]], Adult Treatment Panels suggests the total blood cholesterol level should be: &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;mg/dL normal blood cholesterol, 200–239&amp;nbsp;mg/dL borderline-high, &gt; 240&amp;nbsp;mg/dL high cholesterol.&lt;ref name="pmid3422148"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = | title = Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults.

However, as today's testing methods determine LDL ("bad") and HDL ("good") cholesterol separately, this simplistic view has become somewhat outdated. The desirable LDL level is considered to be less than 130&amp;nbsp;mg/dL (2.6 [[Mole (unit)|mmol]]/L),&lt;ref name=AHA&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011020231058/http://www.americanheart.org/cholesterol/about_diff.html |archive-date=20 October 2001 |url=http://www.americanheart.org/cholesterol/about.jsp |dead-url=yes |title=About cholesterol |publisher=American Heart Association |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; although a newer upper limit of 70&amp;nbsp;mg/dL (1.8&amp;nbsp;mmol/L) can be considered in higher-risk individuals based on some of the above-mentioned trials. A ratio of total cholesterol to HDL—another useful measure—of far less than 5:1 is thought to be healthier.

Total cholesterol is defined as the sum of HDL, LDL, and VLDL. Usually, only the total, HDL, and triglycerides are measured. For cost reasons, the VLDL is usually estimated as one-fifth of the triglycerides and the LDL is estimated using the Friedewald formula (or a [[Low-density lipoprotein#Estimation of LDL particles via cholesterol content|variant]]): estimated LDL = [total cholesterol] − [total HDL] − [estimated VLDL]. VLDL can be calculated by dividing total triglycerides by five. Direct LDL measures are used when triglycerides exceed 400&amp;nbsp;mg/dL. The estimated VLDL and LDL have more error when triglycerides are above 400&amp;nbsp;mg/dL.&lt;ref name="Warnick_1990"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warnick GR, Knopp RH, Fitzpatrick V, Branson L | title = Estimating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by the Friedewald equation is adequate for classifying patients on the basis of nationally recommended cutpoints | journal = Clin.

Given the well-recognized role of cholesterol in cardiovascular disease, some studies have shown an inverse correlation between cholesterol levels and mortality. A 2009 study of patients with acute coronary syndromes found an association of hypercholesterolemia with better mortality outcomes.&lt;ref name="Wang_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang TY, Newby LK, Chen AY, Mulgund J, Roe MT, Sonel AF, Bhatt DL, [[Elizabeth DeLong|DeLong ER]], Ohman EM, Gibler WB, Peterson ED | title = Hypercholesterolemia paradox in relation to mortality in acute coronary syndrome | journal = Clin Cardiol | volume = 32 | issue = 9 | pages = E22–8 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19645040 | doi = 10.1002/clc.20518 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Framingham Heart Study]], in subjects over 50 years of age, they found an 11% increase overall and 14% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality per 1&amp;nbsp;mg/dL per year drop in total cholesterol levels.

Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed ''[[hypocholesterolemia]]''. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[cancer]], and [[cerebral hemorrhage]]. In general, the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness.&lt;ref name="Lewington_2007" /&gt; A genetic defect in cholesterol synthesis causes [[Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome]], which is often associated with low plasma cholesterol levels.

A blood sample after 12-hour fasting is taken by a doctor, or a home cholesterol-monitoring device is used to determine a [[lipid profile|lipoprotein profile]]. This measures total cholesterol, LDL ("bad") cholesterol, HDL ("good") cholesterol, and triglycerides. It is recommended to test cholesterol at least every five years if a person has total cholesterol of 5.2&amp;nbsp;mmol/L or more (200+&amp;nbsp;mg/dL), or if a man over age 45 or a woman over age 50 has HDL ("good") cholesterol less than 1&amp;nbsp;mmol/L (40&amp;nbsp;mg/dL), or there are other risk factors for heart disease and stroke. Other risk factors for heart disease include [[diabetes mellitus]], [[hypertension]] (or use of [[anti-hypertensive drug|anti-hypertensive medication]]), low HDL level, family history of [[coronary artery disease]] (CAD) and [[hypercholesterolemia]], and [[tobacco smoking|cigarette smoking]].&lt;ref name="urlATP III Update 2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atp3upd04.htm |title=Implications of Recent Clinical Trials for the ATP III Guidelines |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lungs and Blood Institute |pages= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202053506/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/atp3upd04.htm |archivedate=2 February 2014 |quote= |accessdate=2014-01-27 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cholesteric liquid crystals==
Some cholesterol derivatives (among other simple cholesteric lipids) are known to generate the [[liquid crystal]]line "cholesteric phase". The cholesteric phase is, in fact, a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[Liquid crystal|nematic phase]], and it changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in [[liquid-crystal display]] [[thermometer]]s and in temperature-sensitive paints.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

==Stereoisomers==
Cholesterol has 256 [[stereoisomer]]s that arise from its 8 stereocenters, although only two of the stereoisomers are of biochemical significance (''nat''-cholesterol and ''ent''-cholesterol, for ''natural'' and ''enantiomer'', respectively),&lt;ref name="Westover_2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Westover EJ, Covey DF, Brockman HL, Brown RE, Pike LJ | title = Cholesterol depletion results in site-specific increases in epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation due to membrane level effects.

The '''Counties Manukau District Health Board''' (CM Health) is a [[district health board]] with the focus on providing healthcare to the Counties Manukau area in southern [[Auckland]], New Zealand. As of 2016, it is responsible for 534,750 residents; or 11% of New Zealand's population.&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countiesmanukau.health.nz/about-us/our-region/ |title=Our region &amp;#124; Counties Manukau Health |publisher=Countiesmanukau.health.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
[[Middlemore Hospital]] is the largest facility under the management of CM Health, however they manage multiple other facilities, which include Kidz First Children's Hospital, the Manukau Surgery Centre, Pukekohe Hospital, Franklin Memorial Hospital, Botany Downs Maternity Unit and Papakura Maternity Unit as well as dedicated mental health and rehabilitation units. There are also specialised smaller scale health centres referred to as SuperClinics, they are, Manukau SuperClinic and Botany SuperClinic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countiesmanukau.health.nz/our-services/a-z/middlemore-hospital/ |title=Middlemore Hospital &amp;#124; Counties Manukau Health |publisher=Countiesmanukau.health.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CM Health is divided into four divisions, Otara-Mangere, Manukau, Franklin , and Eastern. These divisions are called Localities.

===Franklin===
Franklin is the largest locality in CM Health and has a population of around 70,000 representing 14% of the CM population. The population of Franklin Locality is a European majority locality with only 27% of the population not being European (17% Maori, 4% Pacific peoples, and 6% Others). &lt;ref name="Franklin Locality"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countiesmanukau.health.nz/about-us/performance-and-planning/integrated-care/localities/franklin-locality/ |title=Franklin locality &amp;#124; Counties Manukau Health |publisher=Countiesmanukau.health.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of the Otara-Mangere Locality is 65% [[Pacific Islander]], 20% [[Māori people|Maori]], 8% [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]], and 7% other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countiesmanukau.health.nz/about-us/performance-and-planning/integrated-care/localities/otaramangere-locality/ |title=Otara/Mangere locality &amp;#124; Counties Manukau Health |publisher=Countiesmanukau.health.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern===
The Eastern Locality geographical area includes urban areas of [[Howick, New Zealand|Howick]], [[Pakuranga]], [[Dannemora, New Zealand|Dannemora]], [[East Tamaki]] and [[Flat Bush]] and extends to the rural areas of [[Beachlands, New Zealand|Beachlands]], [[Maraetai]], [[Clevedon]], Kawakawa Bay and [[Orere Point]]. With a population of 145,000, Eastern Locality holds around 28.5% of the CM Population. Of this 28.5%, 114,000 or 24% of CM Health's population are registered with a general practice within the Eastern Locality. The Easter Locality has the oldest age average of CM Health's jurisdiction with over 16,000 residents over the age of 65. The majority of Eastern Locality is persons of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and/or [[Indian people|Indian]] descent; it is estimated that over two-thirds of CM Health's Chinese population and one-third of its Indian population live within the Eastern Locality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countiesmanukau.health.nz/about-us/performance-and-planning/integrated-care/localities/eastern-locality/ |title=Eastern locality &amp;#124; Counties Manukau Health |publisher=Countiesmanukau.health.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Manukau===
Manukau Locality is the largest by population with 35% representing 187,000 people. Manukau has the largest concentration of people representing 56% of CM Health's total Maori, 37% of its total Pacific population, 53% of its total Indian population, and 24% of Other populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countiesmanukau.health.nz/about-us/performance-and-planning/integrated-care/localities/manukau-locality/ |title=Manukau locality &amp;#124; Counties Manukau Health |publisher=Countiesmanukau.health.nz |date= |accessdate=2016-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Current board (2016-2019)==
Elections for the board are held every three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aucklandcouncil.govt.nz/EN/ABOUTCOUNCIL/HOWCOUNCILWORKS/ELECTIONS/Pages/Electionresults2016.aspx#cmdhb |title=Election results 2016 |website=Aucklandcouncil.govt.nz |date= |accessdate=2017-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Department of Social and Preventive Medicine''' (popularly known as SPM) is one of 22 teaching departments in the Faculty of Medicine, [[University of Malaya]]. It was formed in 1964, one year after the founding of the Faculty of Medicine in the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur. The department are involved in both Undergraduate and Postgraduate teachings.

The [[Master of Public Health]] program was started in 1973 in response to an acute need of the Ministry of Health Malaysia for Medical Offices of Health to serve in the then fast expanding [[rural health services]]. Thus the program during the first decade of its existence was aimed at producing competent public health specialist to serve the rural areas

By 1987, the environment have so changed that at a meeting between the Director General of Health Services of Malaysia and senior staff of the Department of SPM, a new kind of public health officer was required by the Ministry of Health, namely "a multipurpose public health doctor equipped with the managerial skills and able to work in the general public health as well as hospital setting". By 1989, after a review of the curriculum, a new set of objectives were established for MPH programme.

The MPH Graduate should be

# Technically competent in the board field of Public Health;
# Equipped with managerial skills;
# Able to function as a leader in public services;
# Able to work in the Public Health as well as the hospital setting; and
# Able to work in the district, state as well as the national levels of the health services.

By 1992, many changes had already taken place in the country as well as in the national health services and it was felt that all these changes had an influence on the practice of public health. It was with this in ming that a concept paper to propose "a system of education or training at the postgraduate level and a career development channel in the field of Public Health in Malaysia" was produced by the Department of Social and Preventive Medicine. This culminated in the initiation of a 4-years training program, the program has further evolve with the addition of the [[Doctor of Public Health]] program. 

The graduates originate from the following countries,

# [[China]]  
# [[Germany]]   
# [[Indonesia]]   
# [[India]]   
# [[Iran]]   
# [[Libya]]   
# [[Malaysia]]   
# [[Mongolia]]   
# [[Myanmar]]   
# [[Pakistan]]   
# [[Papua New Guinea]]   
# [[Somalia]]   
# [[Sudan]]   
# [[United Kingdom]]   
# [[Yemen]]

They now serve with distinction in the Ministry of Health, universities and various National and International bodies (e.g. [[Malaysian Armed Forces]], WHO ([[World Health Organization]]), [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF), and in town and city councils) in [[Malaysia]] and around the world.

[[File:Arrest.jpg|thumb|right|A sobering-up cell in Norway. It is easy to clean with minimal features.]]
A '''drunk tank''' is a [[prison cell|jail cell]] or separate facility accommodating people who are [[drunkenness|intoxicated]], especially with [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]].&lt;ref name=independent&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/drunk-tanks-and-minimum-prices-to-help-britain-sober-up-6917683.html | title='Drunk tanks' and minimum prices to help Britain sober up | last1=Morris | first1= Nigel | date= 15 February 2012 | publisher=The Independent | accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some such facilities are mobile, and may be spoken of as "booze buses". 

Traditionally, and in some jurisdictions currently, the circumstances of drunk-tank occupants may vary widely, as to whether in fact intoxicated, whether willingly there, whether isolated to protect them from others, confined to protect others from them, or simply permitted to find shelter, and whether legally under arrest, charged with an offense, or neither. Those in need of more long-term treatment may be referred to a [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation center]].

==Europe==
In some countries of Europe, such modern institutions are known by names that may be translated as "[[sobriety|sobering]]-up station" or similar.

===Czech Republic===
In the [[Czech Republic]] the name is ''Protialkoholní záchytná stanice'', colloquially ''Záchytka''. The first such institution in [[Czechoslovakia]] was opened in 1951 by psychiatrist [[Jaroslav Skála]];&lt;ref name="British lists"&gt;[http://www.blisty.cz/art/28607.html British lists]&lt;/ref&gt; its first patient was a Russian naval engineer.&lt;ref name="British lists"/&gt; During its first 30 years of service, [[Prague]]'s sobering-up station treated over 180,000 people. Other facilities in the country treated over 1,000,000 people. During its peak in Czechoslovakia, there were over 63 such institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.czsk.net/svet/clanky/osobnosti/skalajaroslav.html Czechoslovak world]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Estonia===
In [[Estonia]], {{lang|et|kainestusmaja}} (sobering up house) exist in the biggest cities. Most of the clients there are brought forcefully by police to sober up if a person poses a threat to the public or themselves. One will not be released until sober (up to 24 hours).

===Poland===
In [[Poland]] a sobering-up chamber (''Izba wytrzeźwień'') exists in bigger cities.

===Russia===
{{Further|Alcohol consumption in Russia}}
[[File:Вытрезвитель при Московской части Петербурга.jpg|thumb|One of the early ones, [[St. Petersburg]], 1914. The newly delivered clients are piled up on the floor, while sobering men are sitting or standing up against the walls]]
Such institutions, known as ''Vytrezvitel'' ({{lang-ru|Вытрезвитель}}, literally a "''soberator''"), were introduced in 1904 in [[Tula, Russia|Tula]], Russia, by Fedor Archangelskiy, a surgeon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tounb.tula.net/Tula/Person_zdrav/arhangelskiy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825235359/http://tounb.tula.net/Tula/Person_zdrav/arhangelskiy.htm |archivedate=2006-08-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason that Tula pioneered the issue, not [[St. Petersburg]] or [[Moscow]], was because [[Tula Arms Plant]] weaponmakers were [[freezing to death]] in snowbanks on the backstreets of the city on a daily basis right after the salary was paid. The plant's management could not afford to lose their best and most skilled craftsmen, it took them a lot of time to substitute the departed, so they supported the effort. Back then the [[Tsar]]'s government didn't pay much attention to the Vytrezvitels, they were locally managed by municipal authorities and volunteers on their own discretion, because the unskilled workforce was so cheap that nobody really cared much about frozen and drowned drunks. It was the [[bolsheviks]], who didn't neglect their labour force and did pay much attention to institutionalize the sobering procedures and all the people involved, in order to prevent drunk workers from freezing or drowning somewhere unsupervised, or causing other troubles. In 1940 the Vytrezvitels became state-run facilities, they were detached as separate units within the [[NKVD]] and later [[MVD]] structure, [[police patrol]]s and [[Voluntary People's Druzhina|DNDs]], dispatched for their routine raids, collected drunks from the streets to [[police van]]s, moving them to Vytrezvitels and holding them in custody until they sober up, employing force if necessary. Rampant and disorderly drunks or otherwise inappropriately behaving persons, as well as [[DTs]] and [[Alcohol-related dementia|alcohol-]] or narcotics-triggered mental cases were handed over to medical authorities, who had then and have now [[Psychiatric technician|specially detailed medical personnel]], whose primary mission is to neutralize, or subdue into submission, and drag disorderly drunks into a ward, and forcibly administer medications if required.

The [[Awards of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia|Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia issued a medal]] to commemorate the 70th anniversary of state-run Vytrezvitels.

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]] the sobering-up units are located at police stations around the country. Colloquially known as "fyllecell" or drunk cell, the cell is for holding people who are too intoxicated to take care of themselves or when their intoxication poses a danger to themselves or other people. Being drunk in public is not an offense in Sweden and does not lead to any charges, but repeat "offenders" can have their driver's license revoked.{{Citation needed|reason=whole section on Sweden is without sources.|date=June 2017}}

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, intoxicated persons can be placed into a sobering-up cell when they pose a danger to themselves or society. While public intoxication is not a crime ''per se'', some police departments assess a fee for the use of their facilities and the related personnel costs incurred by the intoxicated party. For instance, the [[Zürich]] [[municipal police|Stadtpolizei]] charges 450-600 [[Swiss franc]]s for a night in the ''ZAB'', or "Zürich Sobering-up and Supervision Site" ({{lang-de|Zürcher Ausnüchterungs- und Betreuungsstelle}}), which is informally referred to as "Hotel Suff" ("Hotel Booze").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/zuerich/stadt/im-hotel-suff-landen-viele-auswaertige/story/10279665 |title=Im «Hotel Suff» übernachten viele Auswärtige |date=29 January 2017 |accessdate=July 20, 2018 |work=[[Tages-Anzeiger]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Intoxication in English law}}
In the [[United Kingdom]], the idea of privately run drunk tanks (or "welfare centres"), separate from police stations and funded by the penalties issued against those held there, was discussed in 2013 and gained support from the [[Association of Chief Police Officers]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24135219 "Acpo issues 'drunk tanks' call to tackle disorder"]. BBC News, 18 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Mobile drunk tanks, also known as "booze buses", and officially as "alcohol recovery centres", have since been introduced in some cities ([[Bristol]] being the first to do so).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/health-42506706 "Drunk tanks may become norm, NHS boss warns 'selfish' revellers"]. BBC News, 29 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Newcastle calls its bus a "safe haven van" and parks it next to [[St John Ambulance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Emergency services join forces to keep Christmas partygoers safe|url=http://www.itv.com/news/tyne-tees/2017-12-16/emergency-services-join-forces-to-keep-christmas-partygoers-safe/|accessdate=30 December 2017|work=ITV News|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is manifested by both physical [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] and a sense of feeling psychologically and emotionally "drained".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-1379(199703)18:2&lt;101::AID-JOB788&gt;3.0.CO;2-Y |author=Zohar D. |title=Predicting burnout with a hassle-based measure of role demands |journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=101–115 |year=1997 |jstor=3100244}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Burnout==
Most emotional exhaustion research has been guided by Maslach's and Jackson's three-component conceptualization of [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]]. This model suggests burnout consists of three interrelated parts: emotional exhaustion, [[depersonalization]], and diminished personal accomplishment. Diminished personal accomplishment refers to negative evaluations of the [[Self (psychology)|self]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Maslach C. |title=The Burnout: The Cost of Caring |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Engelwood Cliffs |year=1982 |isbn=0-13-091231-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maslach C. |author2=Jackson S.E. |title=The Maslach Burnout Inventory |publisher=Consulting Psychologists Press |location=Palo Alto, CA |year=1986 |edition=2nd |isbn=99963-45-77-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Maslach97&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maslach C. |author2=Leiter M.P. |title=The truth about burnout: How organizations cause personal stress and what to do about it |publisher=Jossey-Bass |location=San Francisco, CA |year=1997 |url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0787908746.html |isbn=0-7879-0874-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Determinants==

The level of emotional exhaustion which is experienced by an employee is influenced by a variety of determinants, such as: personal resources, [[coping strategies]], [[emotions and culture|emotional culture]], and supervisory regulation of [[emotional labor#display rules|display rules]].

===Personal resources===
Personal resources, such as status, social support, money or shelter, may reduce or prevent an employee's emotional exhaustion.

According to the [[Conservation of Resources theory]] (COR), people strive to obtain, retain and protect their personal [[Resource (economics)|resources]], either instrumental (e.g., money or shelter), [[social]] (e.g., social support or status) or [[psychological]] (e.g., self-esteem or sense of autonomy). The COR's theory suggest that people must invest resources in order to protect against resource loss, recover from losses, and regain resources. Therefore, those with greater resources are less vulnerable to resource loss and more capable of orchestrating resource gain, whereas, for those with fewer resources, ongoing resource loss may result in a rapid influential loss spiral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.44.3.513 |author=Hobfoll SE |title=Conservation of resources. A new attempt at conceptualizing stress |journal=Am Psychol |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=513–24 |date=March 1989 |pmid=2648906 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/amp/44/3/513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.4.307 |author=Hobfoll S.E. |title=Social and psychological resources and adaptation |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |pages=307–324 |year=2002 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/1464-0597.00062 |author=Hobfoll S.E. |title=The influence of culture, community and the nested-self in the stress process: Advancing conservation of resources theory |journal=Applied Psychology: An International Review |volume=50 |pages=337–421 |year=2001 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/apps/2001/00000050/00000003/art00001 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hobfoll S.E. |title=Stress, Culture, and Community |publisher=Plenum Press |location=New York |year=1998 |isbn=0-306-45942-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[field study]], those experiencing higher levels of job [[autonomy]] (the freedom to take initiative and exercise discretion in decision-making), low task complexity, supervisory support, and the [[internal locus of control]] (a tendency to attribute events to one's own control; such as the tendency to attribute a success to internal causes, like one's ability or effort, rather than external causes, such as good luck), tend to experience lower degrees of emotional exhaustion.&lt;ref name="ito"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0001-8791(02)00033-7 |author1=Ito J. |author2=Brotheridge C. |title=Resources, coping strategies, and emotional exhaustion: A conservation of resources perspective |journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior |volume=63 |pages=490–509 |year=2003 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/00018791/2003/00000063/00000003/art00033 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, researchers reveal that even though higher degree of using [[emotional labor#Emotion regulation|emotion regulation]] on the job is related to higher levels of employees' emotional exhaustion, when employees believe that they have autonomy in their job behaviors, emotion regulation, that is otherwise exhausting, is not associated with exhaustion at all.&lt;ref name="grandey_2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grandey AA, Fisk GM, Steiner DD |title=Must "service with a smile" be stressful? The moderating role of personal control for American and French employees |journal=J Appl Psychol |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=893–904 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16162062 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.90.5.893 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/apl/90/5/893}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another field study, basing on a [[sample (statistics)|sample]] of call-center workers in a large telecommunications corporation, indicate that employees who are highly identified with the service work, possess higher levels of [[self-efficacy]] (the belief in one's ability to succeed;&lt;ref&gt;see [[Albert Bandura]]&lt;/ref&gt;), and receive social support from their supervisors, are less likely to experience emotional exhaustion.&lt;ref name="wilk"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilk SL, Moynihan LM |title=Display rule "regulators": the relationship between supervisors and worker emotional exhaustion |journal=J Appl Psychol |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=917–27 |date=September 2005 |pmid=16162064 |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.90.5.917 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/apl/90/5/917}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coping strategies===
{{Main|Coping strategies}}
Researchers suggest that emotional exhaustion may be a result of using inadequate [[strategies]] in order to cope with problematic events on the job.

Accordingly, there are empirical evidences that employees who tend to use more [[control strategies]], which are considered more productive strategies (concerned with addressing the situation; such as direct action and help seeking) tend to experience lower levels of emotional exhaustion than do those who tend to use more [[escape strategies]], which are considered inadequate strategies (used to avoid problems; such as [[avoidance coping|avoidance]] and [[resignation]] with the problematic situation).&lt;ref name="ito"/&gt;

===Emotional culture===

Regional and national [[cultures]] have been shown to have different norms for [[emotional expression]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ekman P. |chapter=Universals and cultural differences in facial expressions of emotions |editor=Cole J. |title=Nebraska symposium on motivation 1971 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln |year=1972 |pages=207–283 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and vary in their expectations for regulating and expressing emotions in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, D., Doucet, L., &amp; Pratt, M. (2003, August). I'm not smiling because I like you:  Cultural differences in emotional displays at work. Paper presented at the Academy of Management, Seattle, Washington.&lt;/ref&gt; Such differences are part of the emotional culture of those cultures. For example, some cultures are more institutionally-oriented, with strong norms about regulating emotions to fulfill institutional roles and standards, whereas other cultures are more impulsively-oriented that value expressing unregulated emotions.&lt;ref name="gordon"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gordon S.L. |chapter=Institutional and impulsive orientations in selective appropriating emotions to self |editor1=Franks D.D. |editor2=McCarthy D. |title=The sociology of emotions:  Original essays and research papers |publisher=JAI Press |location=Greenwich, CT |year=1989 |pages=115–136 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a culture with a strong institutional-orientation toward emotions is the [[United States]], due to the strong American norm to act positively and hide negative [[feeling]]s ("the service with a smile" norm);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schneider D.J. |chapter=Tactical self-presentations: Toward a broader conception |editor=Tedeschi J.T. |title=Impression management theory and social psychological research |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |year=1981 |pages=23–40 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; whereas [[France]] can be used as an example of a country with a more [[impulsivity|impulsive]]-orientation toward emotions.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |author1=Hallowell R. |author2=Bowen D.E. |author3=Knoop C.I. |title=Four seasons goes to Paris |journal=Academy of Management Executive |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=7–24 |year=2002 |doi=10.5465/AME.2002.8951308 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People within cultures that tend to use an impulsive orientation to understand and evaluate social situations are likely to feel more personal control over their expressions than people within institutional-oriented cultures, resulting in more of a buffer against strain and emotional exhaustion.&lt;ref name="gordon" /&gt;

On the basis of those arguments, an organizational [[research]] investigated the influence of emotional culture on the degree of emotional exhaustion experienced by employees who work on jobs that include interaction with clients and [[emotional labor]] demands. In this study, among employees working at such jobs, those who belonged to more impulsive-oriented culture (France) showed lower degrees of emotional exhaustion, than those who belonged to more institutional-oriented culture (U.S.).&lt;ref name="grandey_2005" /&gt;

===Supervisory regulation of "display rules"===
Supervisors are likely to be important definers of interpersonal demands at the job level, given their direct influence on worker's beliefs about high-performance expectations. Moreover, supervisors' impressions of the importance of display rules (the rules about what kind of [[emotions]] are allowed to be expressed on the job) influence the employees' impressions of these display rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Recent study also suggests that employees who hold the same job (e.g., call center representatives) may experience the same "display rules" differently if they work for different supervisors, who vary in the emphasis they place on their subordinates' interpersonal role requirements, and by so, experience different levels of emotional exhaustion. Such that having a supervisor who places greater importance on interpersonal job demands results in greater emotional exhaustion (especially for those subordinates who have low [[career]] [[Identity (social science)|identity]]) .&lt;ref name="wilk" /&gt;

===Social interaction model of effects on work strain===
Current models of how emotion regulation impacts strain focus on ''intraindividual'' processes that operate within the mind and body of the person regulating the emotion, but these models have several limitations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cote S. |title=A social interaction model of the effects of emotion regulation on work strain |journal=Academy of Management Review |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=509–530 |year=2005 |doi=10.5465/AMR.2005.17293692 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#  Research indicates that emotion regulation is sometimes positively, sometimes negatively and sometimes not associated with strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Barsade S.G. |author2=Brief A.P. |author3=Spataro S.E. |chapter=The affective revolution in organizational behavior: The emergence of a paradigm |editor=Greenberg J. |title=Organizational Behavior: The state of the science |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale, NJ |year=2003 |pages=3–52 |edition=2nd }}&lt;/ref&gt; The intraindividual models do not predict when strain increases or decreases.
# The existing models do not distinguish between amplification and suppression of emotion, even though results tend to differ for them.
# These models do not refer to the social or ''interpersonal'' functions of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Frijda N.H. |author2=Mesquita B. |chapter=The social roles and functions of emotions |editor1=Kitayama S. |editor2=Markus H.R. |title=Emotion and culture: Empirical studies of mutual influence |publisher=American Psychological Association |location=Washington, DC |year=1994 |pages=51–87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#  They also do not explain the different effects that different discrete emotions have on strain (e.g. pleasant vs. unpleasant).

Cote (2005) suggests a social interaction model that takes into account these limitations. In this model, work strain is predicted according to:
# The type and authenticity of the emotion expressed by a sender in an interpersonal situation.
# Receiver's skill of decoding emotion display.
# Sender's response to receiver's reaction.

According to Cote (2005), interpersonal feedback is far more potent than intraindividual feedback, and dominates if the two processes are in opposition. The social interaction model suggests an alternate route by which to proceed with theory building and future research.

==Implications==
Researches have linked emotional exhaustion to a plethora of ailments, and a general breakdown in feelings of community.&lt;ref name=Maslach97/&gt; However, a growing body of research has begun to demonstrate that emotional exhaustion can have deleterious consequences for organizations as well; 

For example, Russell Cropanzano and his colleagues, in their two field studies, indicate that exhausted employees show lower [[organizational commitment]], lower [[job performance]], less [[organizational citizenship behavior]]s (OCB) directed toward the organization (OCBO) and their supervisors (OCBS), and higher [[Turnover (employment)|turnover]] intentions. They suggest that emotional exhaustion can be seen as a cost that qualifies the value of any benefits received through employment, and so that an organization, which overworks its employees to the point of emotional exhaustion, may be seen as unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0021-9010.88.1.160 |author1=Cropanzano R. |author2=Rupp D.E. |author3=Byrne Z.S. |title=The relationship of emotional exhaustion to work attitudes, job performance and organizational citizenship behaviors |journal=Journal of Applied Psychology |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=160–9 |year=2003 |url=http://www.ilir.uiuc.edu/rupp-papers/CropanzanoRuppByrneJAP2003.pdf |pmid=12675403 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215224016/http://www.ilir.uiuc.edu/rupp-papers/CropanzanoRuppByrneJAP2003.pdf |archivedate=2010-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[longitudinal study|longitudinal studies]] found that exhausted employees show not only lower job performance, but also more absences, and greater likelihood of seeking [[employment]] elsewhere (actual voluntary turnover).&lt;ref name=Wright98/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/job.252 |author1=Grandey A. |author2=Dickter D. |author3=Sin H.P. |title=The customer is not always right: Customer aggression and emotion regulation of service employees |journal=Journal of Organizational Behavior |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=397–418 |year=2004 |url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/aag6/JOB252.pdf |format=PDF}}

'''Engineering World Health''' ('''EWH''') is a [[non-profit organization]] that works with [[hospitals]] and [[clinics]] that serve resource-poor communities of the [[developing world]]. EWH's focus is on the repair and maintenance of [[medical equipment]] - rather than donation - and on building local capacity to manage and maintain the equipment without international aid.

Engineering professors [[Robert Malkin]] and Mohammad Kiani established EWH in Memphis in 2001. In 2004, Dr. Malkin and EWH relocated to [[Duke University]], which has been an active partner since that time. As a result of this partnership, EWH is headquartered in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham, NC]]. In 2008, EWH received a multi-year grant from the Wallace H. Coulter Foundation.

==Summer &amp; January Institutes==
Engineering World Health's signature program is the Summer &amp; January Institutes. These service abroad programs engage university-level science and engineering students to use their skills and knowledge to make a direct impact on hospitals in developing countries. Participants spend three to nine weeks in [[Nicaragua]], [[Rwanda]], [[Tanzania]], [[Guatemala]], [[Cambodia]], or [[Nepal]] learning hands-on technical skills and the local language, and then working in local hospitals to install, repair, and maintain medical equipment. Participants also train local staff, empowering them to use and maintain equipment, to create lasting improvements in partner hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewh.org/students/summer-institute/program|title=Overview|website=www.ewh.org|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2004, over 600 participants have repaired almost 5,800 pieces of hospital equipment, worth an estimated US$12 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewh.org/news/annual-reports|title=Annual Reports|website=www.ewh.org|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BMET Training Program==

Seeking a sustainable solution to hospital equipment repair, Engineering World Health started a [[biomedical equipment technician]] (BMET) training program in late 2009, in partnership with the [http://www.gefoundation.com/ GE Foundation]. Through a three to four year curriculum tailored to each country's needs, EWH works with a local educational institution and Ministry of Health to train BMETs to international standards, train local teachers to carry on the program in the long term, and establish a permanent, accredited BMET training program.

The first BMET Training program began in Rwanda, and has since placed trained BMETs in every district in the country. Thanks to further funding from the GE Foundation, EWH has completed a training program [[Honduras]] and turned it over to local leadership, and, as of 2016, is training BMETs in Cambodia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://1technation.com/cambodia-revisited-philip-camillocci-continues-to-help-developing-nation/|title=Cambodia Revisited: Philip Camillocci continues to help developing nation|date=2016-01-19|website=TechNation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigeria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20140507005817/en/GE-Foundation-Duke-University-World-Healthcare-Tech#.U71gYrHGDMI|title=GE Foundation, Duke University World Healthcare Tech Lab, and Engineering World Health Establish Biomedical Equipment Training Program in Nigeria to Build Skills and Improve Capacity {{!}} Business Wire|website=www.businesswire.com|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ethiopia]].

==Chapters==

Engineering World Health has student chapters at 45 universities around the world. These Chapters engage students in activities as design projects for the developing world, biomedical equipment repair and evaluation, and raising awareness of [[global health]] challenges. Chapters may also get involved in the EWH Design Competition in which teams of engineering students submit a design directed at the needs of developing country healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.engr.utexas.edu/news/8036-students-create-patient-monitor|title=Students Use Makerspace Resources to Create Award-Winning Patient Monitor - Cockrell School of Engineering|last=Lee|first=Adrienne|website=www.engr.utexas.edu|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The top three teams are selected by an independent panel of judges and are then rewarded with cash prizes, giving them a chance to implement their device.

==BMET Library==

In 2016, EWH launched an open-source [[digital library]] for BMETs, with the goal of facilitating and fostering information exchange among engineers and technicians around the world. This library is a collection of open source books and publications containing information useful for training (BMETs), particularly in the developing countries where EWH is working.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.ewh.org/|title=BMET Digital Library|website=library.ewh.org|access-date=2016-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''environmental hazard''' is a substance, a state or an event which has the potential to threaten the surrounding natural [[Environmental issue|environment]] / or adversely affect people's [[health]], including [[pollution]] and [[natural disasters]] such as storms and earthquakes.

Any single or combination of toxic chemical, biological, or physical agents in the environment, resulting from human activities or natural processes, that may impact the health of exposed subjects, including pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, biological contaminants, toxic waste, industrial and home chemicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://definedterm.com/environmental_hazard |title=Environmental hazard |work=Defined Term - A dictionary of legal, industry-specific, and uncommon terms. |accessdate=23 August 2017}} quoted from Code of Maryland, January 1, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Human-made [[hazard (risk)|hazards]] while not immediately health-threatening may turn out detrimental to man's well-being eventually, because deterioration in the environment can produce secondary, unwanted negative effects on the human [[Biosphere|ecosphere]]. The effects of [[water pollution]] may not be immediately visible because of a [[sewage system]] that helps drain off toxic substances. If those substances turn out to be persistent (e.g. [[persistent organic pollutant]]), however, they will literally be fed back to their producers via the [[food chain]]: plankton -&gt; edible fish -&gt; humans. In that respect, a considerable number of environmental hazards listed below are man-made [[anthropogenic hazard|(anthropogenic) hazards]].

Hazards can be categorized in four types:
# Chemical
# Physical (mechanical, etc.)
# Biological[[File:GHS-pictogram-pollu.svg|thumb|The [[Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals|international]] [[GHS hazard pictograms|pictogram]] for environmental hazard.]]
# Psychosocial.

==Chemical==
[[Chemical hazard]]s are defined in the [[Globally Harmonized System]] and in the [[European Union]] chemical regulations. They are caused by chemical substances causing significant [[environmental damage|damage to the environment]]. The label is particularly applicable towards substances with [[aquatic toxicity]]. An example is [[zinc oxide]], a common paint pigment, which is extremely toxic to aquatic life.

Toxicity or other hazards do not imply an environmental hazard, because elimination by sunlight ([[photolysis]]), water ([[hydrolysis]]) or organisms (biological elimination) neutralizes many reactive or poisonous substances. Persistence towards these elimination mechanisms combined with toxicity gives the substance the ability to do damage in the long term. Also, the lack of immediate human toxicity does not mean the substance is environmentally nonhazardous. For example, tanker truck-sized spills of substances such as [[milk]] can cause a lot of damage in the local aquatic ecosystems: the added [[biological oxygen demand]] causes rapid [[eutrophication]], leading to [[Anoxic waters|anoxic conditions]] in the water body.

All hazards in this category are mainly [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] although there exist a number of natural carcinogens and chemical elements like radon and lead may turn up in health-critical concentrations in the natural environment:
{{colbegin}}
*[[Anthrax]]
*[[Antibiotic]] agents in animals destined for human consumption
*[[Arsenic]] - a contaminant of fresh water sources (water wells)
*[[Asbestos]] - carcinogenic
*[[DDT]]
*[[Carcinogen]]s
*[[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]]
*[[Endocrine disruptor]]s
*[[Explosive material]]
*[[Fungicide]]s
*[[Furan]]s
*[[Haloalkane]]s
*[[Heavy metals]]
*[[Herbicide]]s
*[[Hormone]]s in animals destined for human consumption
*[[Lead]] in paint
*[[Marine debris]]
*[[Mercury (element)|mercury]]
*[[Mutagen]]s
*[[Pesticide]]s
*[[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s
*[[Radon]] and other natural sources of [[radioactivity]]
*[[Soil pollution]]
*[[Tobacco smoking]]
*[[Toxic waste]]
{{colend}}

==Physical==
A physical hazard is a type of occupational hazard that involves environmental hazards that can cause harm with or without contact. 
{{colbegin}}
*[[Cosmic rays]]
*[[Drought]]
*[[Earthquake]]
*[[Electromagnetic fields]]
*[[E-waste]]
*[[Flood]]s
*[[Fog]]
*[[Light pollution]]
*[[Lighting]]
*[[Lightning]]
*[[Noise pollution]]
*[[Quicksand]]
*[[Ultraviolet light]]
*[[Oscillation|vibration]]
*[[X-rays]]
{{colend}}

==Biological==
Biological hazards, also known as biohazards, refer to biological substances that pose a threat to the health of living organisms, primarily that of humans. This can include medical waste or samples of a microorganism, virus or toxin (from a biological source) that can affect human health. 
{{colbegin}}
*[[Allergies]]
*[[Arbovirus]]
*[[Avian influenza]]
*[[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy]] (BSE)
*[[Cholera]]
*[[Ebola]]
*[[Epidemic]]s
*[[Food poisoning]]
*[[Malaria]]
*[[Mold]]s
*[[Onchocerciasis]] (river blindness)
*[[Pandemic]]s
*[[Pathogen]]s
*[[Pollen]] for allergic people
*[[Rabies]]
*[[Severe acute respiratory syndrome]] (SARS)
*[[Sick building syndrome]]
{{colend}}
{{see also|Toxicology|List of allergies}}

== Psychosocial Hazards ==

Psychosocial hazards include but aren't limited to stress, violence and other [[workplace stress]]ors. Work is generally beneficial to mental health and personal wellbeing. It provides people with structure and purpose and a sense of identity.

== History ==
[[File:Raul Hestnes Fereira Faculdade de FarmáciaLisboa 3921.jpg|thumb|Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Lisbon]]
The Faculty of Pharmacy of the [[University of Lisbon]] was born in 1836 as a School of Pharmacy integrated in the Medical-Surgical School of [[Lisbon]], in which the teaching in the field of pharmacy was assumed by the apothecary of St Joseph's Hospital. With the establishment of the University of Lisbon in March 1911, the School of Pharmacy remained attached to the same institution, now known as Faculty of Medicine of the University of Lisbon.&lt;ref name="História"&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.monumentos.pt/site/app_pagesuser/sipa.aspx?id=30913|title=Facilities of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Lisbon|publisher=Information System for Architectural Heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By Decree No. 4653 of July 14, 1918, it gained autonomy and was named as the Pharmacy School of the University of Lisbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://dre.pt/application/dir/pdfgratis/1918/07/15702.pdf|title=Decree No. 4653 of July 14, 1918|publisher=Diary of the Portuguese Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued, however, to share the facilities of the Faculty of Medicine, in a precarious and inadequate situation. Quinta da Torrinha was bought in 1920 to resolve this situation and to build its own facilities. It would be from this former farm that later the Campus (Cidade Universitária) would be created.&lt;ref name="História"/&gt;

In 1921, by Decree No. 7238 of January 18, the School gets the status of the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Lisbon and assigns bachelor and doctoral degrees in pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=https://dre.pt/application/file/362576|title=Decree No. 7238 of January 18, 1921|publisher=Diary of the Portuguese Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, it was extinguished along with its counterpart of [[Coimbra]], giving way again to a Superior School of Pharmacy, which only granted a bachelor's degree; only in the [[University of Porto]] the Faculty of Pharmacy has remained, where were also given the degrees of graduate ("licenciado") and doctor. This would only be reversed in 1968, when it was restored the Pharmacy Faculties of Coimbra and Lisbon, placing them on an equal footing with the [[Porto]] academy.&lt;ref name="História"/&gt;

Today, the FFULisboa teaches various curricular units, some of them in hospital environment. Through these, and project curricular units, students are offered a direct relationship interaction with the pharmaceutical [[profession]] as well as with the scientific research that is carried out at the faculty's Research Units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.ff.ul.pt/faculdade/historia/|title=Faculty – History|publisher=FFULisboa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fritiof Stig Sjöstrand''' (November 5, 1912 – April 6, 2011)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=hHlmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Sj%C3%B6strand,+Fritiof+Stig%22+AND+%221912%22&amp;dq=%22Sj%C3%B6strand,+Fritiof+Stig%22+AND+%221912%22 | title = Leaders in American science | year = 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] physician and [[histology|histologist]] born in [[Stockholm]]. He started his medical education at [[Karolinska Institutet]] in 1933,&lt;ref name="KI Bio"&gt;[http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=22576&amp;l=sv Fritiof S. Sjöstrand - Biografi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718011200/http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=22576&amp;l=sv |date=2011-07-18 }}, Karolinska Institutet 200 years {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he received his Ph.D. [[Karolinska Institutet]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Sjöstrand, Fritiof S., ''Über die Eigenfluoreszenz tierischer Gewebe mit besonderer Berücksichtigung der Säugetierniere.'', Diss. Stockholm : Karol. inst., Stockholm, 1944&lt;/ref&gt; Sjöstrand worked as an assistant at the department of [[pharmacology]], where he first had used [[polarization microscopy]], he first heard about the new method of [[electron microscopy]] in 1938, within which he would become a pioneer. [[Manne Siegbahn]] at the Nobel Institute for Physics had planned to build an electron microscope in Sweden, and Sjöstrand got involved in the project to explore its use in medical research. The main challenge was to produce sufficiently thin samples, and Sjöstrand's method for producing ultrathin tissue samples was published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1943.&lt;ref name="KI Hur"&gt;[http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=22576&amp;a=55947&amp;l=sv Hur anatomiska institutionen blev internationellt centrum för elektronmikroskopi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718011345/http://ki.se/ki/jsp/polopoly.jsp?d=22576&amp;a=55947&amp;l=sv |date=2011-07-18 }}, Karolinska Institutet 200 years {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it seemed that research based on electron microscopy would be too time-consuming for a Ph.D. thesis, so his 1944 thesis was based on [[fluorescence]] spectroscopy. In 1947-1948, he received a scholarship to further study electron microscopy at  [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Department of Biology. Back in Sweden, he received funding to build up an electron microscopy research laboratory. In 1959, Sjöstrand was both offered a position as professor of histology at Karolinska Institutet, and as professor at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). He chose UCLA, because conditions for research and funding were better there.&lt;ref name="KI Hur"/&gt;

Sjöstrand founded the ''[[Journal of Ultrastructure Research]]'' in 1957. Since 1990, the journal has been called the ''[[Journal of Structural Biology]]''.

Sjöstrand died on April 6, 2011, at the age of 98.

In the recognition of Fritiof Sjöstrand's contribution to the development of electron microscopy, the Annual Sjöstrand Lecture series was set up in 2018 in Sweden&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scilifelab.se/events/inaugural-sjostrand-lecture-in-structural-biology-by-venki-ramakrishnan/&lt;/ref&gt;. A holder of the lectureship particularly commits to spend time with students and postdocs at [[SciLifeLab]]. The Inaugural Lecture is given by [[Venki Ramakrishnan]] on 27th August 2018 at the [[Karolinska Institute]] and entitled ’Termination of translation in bacteria and eukaryotes'. The 2019 lecture will be given by [[Jennifer Doudna]].

'''Glands of Zeis''' are unilobar [[sebaceous gland]]s located on the margin of the [[eyelid]]. The glands of Zeis service the [[eyelash]]. These glands produce an oily substance that is issued through the excretory ducts of the [[sebaceous]] lobule into the middle portion of the [[hair follicle]]. In the same area of the eyelid, near the base of the eyelashes are [[apocrine gland]]s called the "[[glands of Moll]]".

If eyelashes are not kept clean, conditions such as [[folliculitis]] may take place, and if the sebaceous gland becomes infected, it can lead to [[abscess]]es and [[stye]]s. The glands of Zeis are named after German [[ophthalmologist]] [[Eduard Zeis]] (1807–68).

'''Global Handwashing Day''' ('''GHD''') is a campaign to motivate and mobilize people around the [[world]] to improve their [[Hand washing|handwashing]] habits.  Washing hands at critical points during the day and washing with [[soap]] are both important. 

Global Handwashing Day occurs on 15 October of each year. The global campaign is dedicated to raising awareness of handwashing with soap as a key factor in [[Preventive healthcare|disease prevention]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=20091015004104007&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Lae Marks Global Handwashing Day|last = Rai|first = Frank|date = 12 August 2009|work = Post-Courier (Papua New Guinea)|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Respiratory and intestinal diseases can be reduced by 25-50%.

==Implementation and management==
The Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) (formerly called "[[Public-private partnership|Public Private Partnership]]&amp;nbsp;for Handwashing" (PPPHW)) established Global Handwashing Day in 2008 as a way to promote a global and local vision of handwashing with soap.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=12 October 2012|title=Global Handwashing Day|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=82513752&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=61|issue=40|page=821|doi=|pmid=|access-date=24 July 2015|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steering Committee members of the GHP include Colgate-Palmolive; FHI 360; The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine; Procter &amp; Gamble; UNICEF; Unilever; University at Buffalo; USAID; the Water and Sanitation Programme at the World Bank; and the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=The Global Handwashing Partnership|website=globalhandwashing.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continued research on handwashing habits and practices is commissioned in conjunction with GHD. In 2011, [[Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget]] (SCA), sponsored a study to assess the handwashing habits of American and Canadian adults, finding that many were not using soap when washing their hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=bizwire.c37268574&amp;site=ehost-live|title = New Research Reveals Poor Handwashing Practices|last = |first = |date = 14 October 2011|work = Business Wire|access-date = 10 August 2015|via = Regional Business News – EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aims===
The aims of Global Handwashing Day are to:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Foster and support a general culture of handwashing with soap in all societies
* Shine a spotlight on the state of handwashing in each country
* Raise awareness about the benefits of handwashing with soap.

==Activities==
Each year, over 200 million people celebrate Global Handwashing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://concern-universal.org/get-involved/campaigns-appeals/global-handwashing-day/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208100034/http://concern-universal.org/get-involved/campaigns-appeals/global-handwashing-day |archivedate=8 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
*On 15 October 2014, [[Madhya Pradesh]] won the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the most massive handwashing program.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/mp-creates-world-record-for-mass-hand-washing-initiative-guinness-book-acknowledges-feat/article1-1365615.aspx|title = MP Creates World Record for Mass Handwashing Initiative; Guinness Book Acknowledges Feat|last = |first = |date = 3 July 2015|work = Hindustan Times|access-date = 23 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 1,276,425 children in 51 different districts participating.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Sometimes, groups choose to celebrate GHD on other dates than 15 October. In [[Ethiopia]], 300 people celebrated Global Handwashing Day in [[Addis Ababa]] on 1 November in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://unicefethiopia.wordpress.com/2013/11/04/ethiopia-celebrates-global-handwashing-day/|title = Ethiopia Celebrates Global Handwashing Day|last = Bizuwork|first = Demissew|date = 4 November 2013|work = UNICEF Ethiopia|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 15 October 2015, Lupok Central Elementary School, Guiuan Eastern Samar, Philippines celebrated the Global Handwashing Day by doing the proper handwashing before starting classes.

==History==
Global Handwashing Day was initiated by the Global Handwashing Partnership (GHP) in August 2008 at the annual [[World Water Week]] in Stockholm, Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://globalhandwashing.org/about-us/our-history/|title = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing – Our History|date = |accessdate = 18 December 2015|website = The Global Public Private Partnership for Handwashing|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the first Global Handwashing Day took place on 15 October 2008. The date was appointed by the UN General Assembly. The year 2008 was also the [[International Year of Sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/gpsc/events/2008/15_10_08/en/index.html|title = Global Handwashing Day|date = 15 October 2008|accessdate = 24 July 2015|website = World Health Organization|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding bodies in 2008 included: FHI360 (a nonprofit human development organization based in the US),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fhi360.org/about-us|title=fhi360 About Us|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=fhi360|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], [[UNICEF]], [[Unilever]], [[Water and sanitation program|World Bank Water &amp; Sanitation Program]] and the [[United States Agency for International Development]].

===Themes===
*The focus for Global Handwashing Day's inaugural year in 2008 was school children. In that year, the members pledged to get the maximum number of school children handwashing with soap in more than 70 countries. In [[India]] in 2008, [[cricket]] legend [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and his teammates joined an estimated 100 million schoolchildren around the country in lathering up for better health and hygiene as part of the first Global Handwashing Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/india_45974.html|title = Star Cricketer Sachin Tendulkar Promotes Handwashing in India|last = Walker|first = Angela|date = 16 October 2008|work = UNICEF|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was initiated to reduce childhood mortality rates and related [[respiratory]] and [[Diarrhea|diarrheal diseases]] by introducing simple [[Behaviour change (public health)|behavioral changes]], such as [[handwashing]] with [[soap]]. This simple action can reduce the [[mortality rate]] of respiratory disease by 25%. Death from diarrheal diseases can be reduced by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Val|last2=Cairncross|first2=Sandy|date=May 2003|title=Effect of washing hands with soap on diarrhoea risk in the community: a systematic review|journal=The Lancet Infectious Diseases|volume=3|issue=5|pages=275–281|doi=10.1016/S1473-3099(03)00606-6|pmid=12726975}}&lt;/ref&gt; Across the world, more than 60 percent of health workers do not adhere to proper hand hygiene. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US health care providers, on average, wash their hands less than half of the time they should. On any given day, one in 25 US hospital patients has at least one health care-associated infection.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hand Hygiene in Healthcare Settings |url=https://www.cdc.gov/handhygiene/index.html |website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention |publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion (DHQP) |accessdate=23 October 2018 |date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Importance of handwashing ===
{{Main article|Handwashing}}
{{tone|section|date=April 2018}}
Handwashing with soap is very effective and the least expensive way to prevent [[diarrhea]] and [[acute respiratory infection]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=nfh&amp;AN=6FI3204107250&amp;site=ehost-live|title=MOH Celebrates Global Handwashing Day|last=|first=|date=15 October 2009|work=Arabia 2000|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Newspaper Source – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pneumonia]], a major ARI (acute respiratory infection), is the number one cause of mortality among children under five years old, killing an estimated 1.8&amp;nbsp;million children per year. [[Diarrhea]] and pneumonia together account for almost 3.5&amp;nbsp;million child deaths annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/publications/files/The_State_of_the_Worlds_Children_2008.pdf|title=The State of the World’s Children 2008. Child Survival. UNICEF|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Handwashing with soap is estimated to reduce cases of diarrhea by 30% and respiratory infections by 21% in children under the age of five.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It is important to make handwashing into a [[habit]]. Good handwashing with soap before [[eating]] and after using the toilet into a regular habit can save more lives than any single [[vaccine]] or medical intervention, cutting deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute [[respiratory infection]]s by one-quarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://foodpoisoningbulletin.com/2013/today-is-global-handwashing-day/|title=Today is Global Handwashing Day|last=Larsen|first=Linda|date=15 October 2013|work=Food Poisoning Bulletin|access-date=24 July 2015|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Handwashing is usually done together with other [[sanitation]] interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene [[WASH]] programmes.

The Global Handwashing Day helps raise awareness of the importance of washing with soap, but it also makes it fun for children to get involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=wapo.ea30fbe0-e86a-11e0-8a05-c10ec107dc66&amp;site=ehost-live|title=Getting All Lathered Up|last=Sawyer|first=Kem Knapp|date=10 October 2011|work=The Washington Post|access-date=24 July 2015|via=Regional Business News – EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proper hygiene requires that individuals know the importance of good hygiene and develop the habits to carry it out.  There are people with plenty of money but nonetheless, they lack the important habits of timely handwashing with soap, and thereby unknowingly endanger themselves and others around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/global-handwashing-day-in_b_5989280.html|title=Global Handwashing Day in the Time of Ebola|author=Jeffrey Sachs|author2=Myriam Sidibe|date=15 October 2014|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peer pressure|Peer influence]] is significant to seeing increased handwashing among students. In a study conducted in [[Kenya]], researchers found that students were much more likely to wash their hands when another student is present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickering|first=Amy J.|last2=Blum|first2=Annalise G.|last3=Breiman|first3=Robert F.|last4=Ram|first4=Pavani K.|last5=Davis|first5=Jennifer|date=27 March 2014|title=Video Surveillance Captures Student Hand Hygiene Behavior, Reactivity to Observation, and Peer Influence in Kenyan Primary Schools|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92571|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092571|pmc=3968003|pmid=24676389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer influence is only successful, however, when students know that handwashing is a desirable action.

=== Related awareness days ===
The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) celebrates a  World Hand Hygiene Day on 5 May. In 2018 the theme was prevention of [[sepsis]] in health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/infection-prevention/campaigns/clean-hands/5may2018/en/|title=Infection prevention and control|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme of the year before was to combat [[Antimicrobial resistance|antibiotic resistance]] (AMR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/infection-prevention/campaigns/clean-hands/2017/en/|title=Infection prevention and control|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=World Health Organization|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Health care ratings''' are ratings or [[evaluation]]s of [[health care]]. In the United States they have been an increasingly used tool to try to drive accountability among [[Health_care_in_the_United_States#Providers|health care providers]] and in the context of classic [[Supply (economics)|supply]]/[[demand]] view of [[Health economics]], to help health care consumers make better choices.&lt;ref name=Kolstad2009/&gt;

Reviews in 2008 and 2009 review of research on the effects of health care ratings found that there was evidence that public ratings drove hospitals to improve their performance, but there was limited evidence that they affected how consumers choose health care providers or insurance plans, or that they changed the performance of individual doctors or insurance companies.&lt;ref name=Kolstad2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kolstad|first1=JT|last2=Chernew|first2=ME|title=Quality and consumer decision making in the market for health insurance and health care services|journal=Medical Care Research and Review : MCRR|date=February 2009|volume=66|issue=1 Suppl|pages=28S–52S|doi=10.1177/1077558708325887|pmid=19029288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fung2008&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fung|first=C.H.|title=Systematic Review: The Evidence That Publishing Patient Care Performance Data Improved Quality of Care|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|year=2008|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-148-2-200801150-00006|pmid=18195336|volume=148|issue=2|pages=111–23|citeseerx=10.1.1.691.1541}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0026297/ DARE summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

In may cases it is difficult to create health care ratings that can meaningfully summarize any individual provider's performance in a way that be compared with others', and data is often lacking with which to generate ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sinaiko|first1=AD|last2=Eastman|first2=D|last3=Rosenthal|first3=MB|title=How report cards on physicians, physician groups, and hospitals can have greater impact on consumer choices|journal=Health Affairs (Project Hope)|date=March 2012|volume=31|issue=3|pages=602–11|doi=10.1377/hlthaff.2011.1197|pmid=22392672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Healthy Skepticism Inc''' is an international [[non-profit organisation]] whose main aim is to "improve health by reducing harm from misleading [[drug promotion]]".

Healthy Skepticism was founded in 1983 with the name Medical Lobby for Appropriate Marketing (MaLAM). It was begun by an [[Australia]]n medical student, Peter R. Mansfield,  who had the idea for the organization during his final year elective in [[Bangladesh]] in 1982. MaLAM initially focused on campaigning against questionable [[marketing]] practices in [[developing countries]]. These included the promotion of [[appetite]] stimulants, tonics and [[anabolic steroid]]s to parents of malnourished children. MaLAM was modelled on [[Amnesty International]] and wrote open letters to the international headquarters of [[pharmaceutical companies]] questioning them about specific advertisements.

'''Human nutrition''' deals with the provision of [[essential nutrient]]s in food that are necessary to support human [[life]] and [[health]]. Poor nutrition is a chronic problem often linked to poverty, [[food security]] or a poor understanding of nutrition and dietary practices.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children"&gt;Progress for Children: A Report Card on Nutrition (No. 4), UNICEF, May 2006, {{ISBN|978-92-806-3988-9}}. http://www.unicef.org/nutrition/index_33685.html&lt;/ref&gt; Malnutrition and its consequences are large contributors to deaths and [[Disability|disabilities]] worldwide.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions"&gt;World Health Organization.

== Overview ==
The human body contains chemical compounds, such as water, carbohydrates, [[amino acids]] (in [[proteins]]), [[fatty acids]] (in [[lipids]]), and [[nucleic acids]] ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]]). These compounds are composed of [[chemical element|elements]] such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus. Any study done to determine nutritional status must take into account the state of the body before and after experiments, as well as the chemical composition of the whole diet and of all the materials [[excreted]] and eliminated from the body (including [[urine]] and feces). Comparing food to waste material can help determine the specific compounds and elements absorbed and metabolized by the body.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} The effects of nutrients may only be discernible over an extended period of time, during which all food and waste must be analyzed. The number of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]] involved in such [[experiment]]s is high, making nutritional studies time-consuming and expensive, which explains why the science of human nutrition is still slowly evolving.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Nutrients==
{{Main article|Nutrient}}

The seven major classes of nutrients are [[carbohydrates]], [[fat]]s, [[dietary fiber|fiber]], [[dietary minerals|minerals]], [[protein]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[water]]. These nutrient classes are categorized as either [[macronutrients]] or [[micronutrients]] (needed in small quantities). The macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, fiber, proteins, and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.medicinejournal.co.uk/|title = Principles of Human Nutrition|last = Lean|first = Michael E.J.|date = 2015|journal = Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.mpmed.2014.11.009|pmid = |access-date = March 31, 2015|issue = 2|pages = 61–65|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The micronutrients are minerals and vitamins.&lt;ref name=WHO2004&gt;{{cite book|last1=World Health Organization, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations|title=Vitamin and mineral requirements in human nutrition|date=2004|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva [u.a.]|isbn=978-9241546126|edition=2.|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/9241546123/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built, and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built), and [[Bioenergetics|energy]]. Some of the structural material can also be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in [[Joule]]s or [[calorie|kilocalories]] (often called "Calories" and written with a capital 'C' to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17&amp;nbsp;kJ approximately (4&amp;nbsp;kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37&amp;nbsp;kJ (9&amp;nbsp;kcal) per gram,&lt;ref name=Stryer&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Berg J, Tymoczko JL, Stryer L | title = Biochemistry | publisher = W.H. Freeman | edition = 5th | location = San Francisco | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-7167-4684-3 |page= 603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance.

Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class of dietary material, fiber (i.e., nondigestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, though the exact reasons remain unclear. For all age groups, males need to consume higher amounts of macronutrients than females. In general, intakes increase with age until the second or third decade of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/95E87FE64B144FA3CA2568A9001393C0|title = National Nutrition Survey: Nutrient Intakes and Physical Measurements|date = 1995|accessdate = |website = Australian Bureau of Statistics|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple [[monosaccharides]] (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex [[polysaccharides]] (starch). Fats are [[triglyceride]]s, made of assorted [[fatty acid]] [[monomers]] bound to a [[glycerol]] backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body. Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Nelson2005&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Nelson DL, Cox MM |year=2005 |title=Lehninger's Principles of Biochemistry |edition=4th |publisher=W. H. Freeman and Company |location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental  components of protein are nitrogen-containing [[amino acids]], some of which are [[essential amino acids|essential]] in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded, primarily as urea in urine. This occurs naturally when [[atrophy]] takes place, or during periods of starvation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Carbohydrates===
{{Main article|Carbohydrate}}

[[Image:Wheat products.jpg|thumb|upright|[[cereal|Grain]] products: rich sources of complex and simple carbohydrates]]

Carbohydrates may be classified as [[monosaccharide]]s, [[disaccharide]]s or [[polysaccharide]]s depending on the number of monomer (sugar) units they contain. They are a diverse group of substances, with a range of chemical, physical and physiological properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/ejcn/journal/v61/n1s/pdf/1602936a.pdf|title = Carbohydrate terminology and classification|date = 2007|journal = European Journal of Clinical Nutrition|doi = 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602936|pmid = 17992187|access-date = |volume=61 |pages=S5–S18|last1 = Cummings|first1 = J H|last2 = Stephen|first2 = A M}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make up a large part of foods such as [[rice]], [[noodles]], [[bread]], and other [[grain]]-based products,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carb-counter.net/breads/2320|title=Grams of Carbohydrates in White Bread - Carb Counter|website=www.carb-counter.net|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amrice.com/6-4.cfm|title=American Rice, Inc.|website=www.amrice.com|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are not an essential nutrient, meaning a human does not need to eat carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Westman|first=EC|date=May 2002|title=Is dietary carbohydrate essential for human nutrition?|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|volume=75|issue=5|pages=951–3|pmid=11976176|doi=10.1093/ajcn/75.5.951a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monosaccharides contain one sugar unit, disaccharides two, and polysaccharides three or more. Monosaccharides  include [[glucose]], [[fructose]] and [[galactose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://healthyeating.sfgate.com/carbohydrates-contain-monosaccharides-1181.html|title = Carbohydrates That Contain Monosaccharides|date = |accessdate = |website = Healthy eating|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Disaccharides include [[sucrose]], [[lactose]], and [[maltose]]; purified [[sucrose]], for instance, is used as table sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1357303914003338#|title = Principles of human nutrition|date = 2015|journal = Medicine|doi = 10.1016/j.mpmed.2014.11.009|pmid = |access-date =|volume=43|issue = 2|pages=61–65|last1 = Lean|first1 = Michael E.J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polysaccharides, which include [[starch]] and [[glycogen]], are often referred to as 'complex' carbohydrates because they are typically long multiple-branched chains of sugar units. The difference is that complex carbohydrates take longer to digest and absorb since their sugar units must be separated from the chain before absorption. The spike in [[blood glucose]] levels after ingestion of simple sugars is thought to be related to some of the heart and vascular diseases, which have become more common in recent times. Simple sugars form a greater part of modern diets than in the past, perhaps leading to more cardiovascular disease. The degree of causation is still not clear.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Simple carbohydrates are absorbed quickly, and therefore raise blood-sugar levels more rapidly than other nutrients. However, the most important plant carbohydrate nutrient, starch, varies in its absorption. Gelatinized starch (starch heated for a few minutes in the presence of water) is far more digestible than plain starch, and starch which has been divided into fine particles is also more absorbable during digestion. The increased effort and decreased availability reduces the available energy from starchy foods substantially and can be seen experimentally in rats and anecdotally in humans. Additionally, up to a third of dietary starch may be unavailable due to mechanical or chemical difficulty.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Fat===
{{Main article|Fat|Nutrition#Fat}}

A molecule of dietary fat typically consists of several [[fatty acid]]s (containing long chains of carbon and hydrogen atoms), bonded to a [[glycerol]]. They are typically found as [[triglyceride]]s (three fatty acids attached to one glycerol backbone). Fats may be classified as [[saturated fat|saturated]] or [[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]] depending on the chemical structure of the fatty acids involved.{{mcn|date=December 2018}}  Saturated fats have all of the carbon atoms in their fatty acid chains bonded to hydrogen atoms, whereas unsaturated fats have some of these carbon atoms [[Double bond|double-bonded]], so their molecules have relatively fewer hydrogen atoms than a saturated fatty acid of the same length. Unsaturated fats may be further classified as monounsaturated (one double-bond) or polyunsaturated (many double-bonds). Furthermore, depending on the location of the double-bond in the fatty acid chain, unsaturated fatty acids are classified as [[omega-3]] or [[omega-6]] fatty acids. [[Trans fats]] are a type of unsaturated fat with ''trans''-isomer bonds; these are rare in nature and in foods from natural sources; they are typically created in an industrial process called (partial) [[hydrogenation]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Many studies have shown that consumption of unsaturated fats, particularly monounsaturated fats, is associated with better health in humans. Saturated fats, typically from animal sources, are next in order of preference, while trans fats are associated with a variety of disease and should be avoided.  Saturated and some trans fats are typically solid at room temperature (such as [[butter]] or [[lard]]), while unsaturated fats are typically liquids (such as [[olive oil]] or [[flaxseed oil]]). Trans fats are very rare in nature, but have properties useful in the [[food processing]] industry, such as rancidity resistance.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Most fatty acids are not essential, meaning the body can produce them as needed, generally from other fatty acids and always by expending energy to do so. However, in humans, at least two fatty acids are [[essential fatty acids|essential]] and must be included in the diet. An appropriate balance of essential fatty acids – [[omega-3]] and [[omega-6 fatty acid|omega-6]] fatty acids – seems also important for health, though definitive experimental demonstration has been elusive. Both of these "omega" long-chain [[unsaturated fat|polyunsaturated fatty acids]] are [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrates]] for a class of [[eicosanoids]] known as [[prostaglandins]], which have roles throughout the human body. They are [[hormone]]s, in some respects. The omega-3 [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), which can be made in the human body from the omega-3 essential fatty acid [[alpha-linolenic acid]] (LNA), or taken in through marine food sources, serves as a building block for series 3 prostaglandins (e.g. weakly [[inflammation|inflammatory]] PGE3). The omega-6 dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) serves as a building block for series 1 prostaglandins (e.g. anti-inflammatory PGE1), whereas arachidonic acid (AA) serves as a building block for series 2 prostaglandins (e.g., pro-inflammatory PGE 2). Both DGLA and AA can be made from the omega-6 [[linoleic acid]] (LA) in the human body, or can be taken in directly through food. An appropriately balanced intake of omega-3 and omega-6 partly determines the relative production of different prostaglandins: one reason a balance between omega-3 and omega-6 is believed important for cardiovascular health. In industrialized societies, people typically consume large amounts of processed vegetable oils, which have reduced amounts of the essential fatty acids along with too much of omega-6 fatty acids relative to omega-3 fatty acids.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Fiber===
{{Main article|Dietary fiber}}

Dietary fiber is a [[carbohydrate]], specifically a polysaccharide, which is incompletely absorbed in humans and in some animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized, it can produce four Calories (kilocalories) of energy per gram, but in most circumstances, it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. The two subcategories are insoluble and soluble fiber. Insoluble dietary fiber consists mainly of [[cellulose]], a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible by humans, because humans do not have the required enzymes to break it down, and the human digestive system does not harbor enough of the types of microbes that can do so.  Soluble dietary fiber comprises a variety of [[oligosaccharides]], [[waxes]], [[esters]], resistant starches, and other carbohydrates that dissolve or gelatinize in water. Many of these soluble fibers can be fermented or partially fermented by microbes in the human digestive system to produce short-chain fatty acids which are absorbed and therefore introduce some caloric content.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Whole grains, beans and other [[legumes]], fruits (especially [[plum]]s, [[prune]]s, and [[ficus|figs]]), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. Fiber is important to digestive health and is thought to reduce the risk of colon cancer.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} For mechanical  reasons, fiber can help in alleviating both [[constipation]] and [[diarrhea]]. Fiber provides bulk to the intestinal contents, and insoluble fiber especially stimulates [[peristalsis]] – the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move digesta along the digestive tract. Some soluble fibers produce a solution of high [[viscosity]]; this is essentially a gel, which slows the movement of food through the intestines. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, may help lessen insulin spikes and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

===Protein===
{{Main article|Protein (nutrient)}}

Proteins are the basis of many animal body structures (e.g. muscles, skin, and hair) and form the [[enzyme]]s which catalyse chemical reactions throughout the body. Each protein molecule is composed of [[amino acids]] which contain nitrogen and sometimes sulphur (these components are responsible for the distinctive smell of burning protein, such as the keratin in hair). The body requires amino acids to produce new proteins (protein retention) and to replace damaged proteins (maintenance).  Amino acids are soluble in the digestive juices within the small intestine, where they are absorbed into the blood. Once absorbed, they cannot be stored in the body, so they are either metabolized as required or excreted in the urine.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Proteins consist of amino acids in different proportions. The most important aspect and defining characteristic of protein from a nutritional standpoint is its [[amino acid]] composition.&lt;ref name="DRI"&gt;Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements, published by the Institute of Medicine's Food and Nutrition Board, currently available online at {{cite web|url=http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140705140516/http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/dietary-guidance/dietary-reference-intakes/dri-reports |archivedate=2014-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amino acids which an animal cannot synthesize on its own from smaller molecules are deemed essential. The synthesis of some amino acids can be limited under special pathophysiological conditions, such as prematurity in the infant or individuals in severe catabolic distress, and those are called conditionally essential.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt;

A [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] diet can adequately supply protein, support pregnancy, childhood and athletic endeavors,&lt;ref name="ada"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19562864|year=2009|author1=Craig|first1=W.

===Minerals===
{{Main article|Mineral (nutrient)}}

Dietary minerals are the [[chemical element]]s required by living organisms, other than the four elements [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], and [[oxygen]] that are present in nearly all [[organic chemistry|organic molecules]]. The term "mineral" is archaic, since the intent is to describe simply the less common elements in the diet. Some are heavier than the four just mentioned – including several [[metals]], which often occur as ions in the body. Some dietitians recommend that these be supplied from foods in which they occur naturally, or at least as complex compounds, or sometimes even from natural inorganic sources (such as [[calcium carbonate]] from ground [[oyster]] shells). Some are absorbed much more readily in the ionic forms found in such sources. On the other hand, minerals are often artificially added to the diet as supplements; the most well-known is likely iodine in [[iodized salt]] which prevents [[goiter]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

====Essential dietary minerals====
include the following:{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Chlorine]] as [[chloride]] ions; very common electrolyte; see sodium, below.
* [[Magnesium]], required for processing [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and related reactions (builds bone, causes strong peristalsis, increases flexibility, increases alkalinity). Approximately 50% is in bone, the remaining 50% is almost all inside body cells, with only about 1% located in extracellular fluid. Food sources include oats, buckwheat, tofu, nuts, caviar, green leafy vegetables, legumes, and chocolate.&lt;ref name="mahan"&gt;{{cite book | title= Krausw's Food and the Nutrition Care Process |edition=13th  |publisher=Elsevier |location=St. Louis | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4377-2233-8 |author1=L. Kathleen Mahan |author2=Janice L. Raymond |author3=Sylvia Escott-Stump }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USDA DB"&gt;[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, SR26, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Phosphorus]], required component of bones; essential for energy processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=D. E. C. Corbridge | title=Phosphorus: An Outline of its Chemistry, Biochemistry, and Technology | edition=5th | publisher=Elsevier | location=Amsterdam | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-444-89307-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 80% is found in inorganic portion of bones and teeth. Phosphorus is a component of every cell, as well as important metabolites, including DNA, RNA, ATP, and phospholipids. Also important in pH regulation. Food sources include cheese, egg yolk, milk, meat, fish, poultry, whole-grain cereals, and many others.&lt;ref name="mahan" /&gt;
* [[Potassium]], a very common electrolyte (heart and nerve health). With sodium, potassium is involved in maintaining normal water balance, osmotic equilibrium, and acid-base balance. In addition to calcium, it is important in the regulation of neuromuscular activity. Food sources include bananas, avocados, vegetables, potatoes, legumes, fish, and mushrooms.&lt;ref name="USDA DB" /&gt;
* [[Sodium]], a very common electrolyte; not generally found in dietary supplements, despite being needed in large quantities, because the ion is very common in food: typically as [[sodium chloride]], or common salt.

====Trace minerals====
Many elements are required in smaller amounts (microgram quantities), usually because they play a [[catalytic]] role in [[enzymes]].&lt;ref name=lipp&gt;{{cite book |author1=Lippard, S. J.  |author2=Berg, J. M. | title=Principles of Bioinorganic Chemistry | publisher=University Science Books | location=Mill Valley, CA | year=1994 | isbn=978-0-935702-73-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some trace mineral elements (RDA &lt; 200&amp;nbsp;mg/day) are, in alphabetical order:{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}
* [[Cobalt]] as a component of the [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] family of [[coenzyme]]s
* [[Copper]] required component of many redox enzymes, including [[cytochrome c oxidase]]
* [[Chromium]] required for sugar metabolism
* [[Iodine]] required not only for the biosynthesis of [[thyroxin]], but probably, for other important organs as breast, stomach, salivary glands, thymus etc. (see [[Iodine deficiency]]); for this reason iodine is needed in larger quantities than others in this list, and sometimes classified with the macrominerals;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kapil|first=Umesh|date=2016-11-22|title=Health Consequences of Iodine Deficiency|journal=Sultan Qaboos University Medical Journal|volume=7|issue=3|pages=267–272|issn=2075-051X|pmc=3074887|pmid=21748117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be found in iodized salt
* [[Iron]] required for many enzymes,  and for [[hemoglobin]] and some other proteins
* [[Manganese]] (processing of oxygen)
* [[Molybdenum]] required for [[xanthine oxidase]] and related oxidases
* [[Selenium]] required for [[peroxidase]] (antioxidant proteins)
* [[Zinc]] required for several enzymes such as [[carboxypeptidase]], [[Alcohol dehydrogenase#In humans|liver alcohol dehydrogenase]], [[carbonic anhydrase]]

===Vitamins===
{{Main article|Vitamin}}

As with the minerals discussed above, some vitamins are recognized as essential nutrients, necessary in the diet for good health. ([[Vitamin D]] is the exception: it can alternatively be synthesized in the skin, in the presence of [[UVB radiation]].) Certain vitamin-like compounds that are recommended in the diet, such as [[carnitine]], are thought useful for survival and health, but these are not "essential" dietary nutrients because the human body has some capacity to produce them from other compounds. Moreover, thousands of different [[phytochemicals]] have recently been discovered in food (particularly in fresh vegetables), which may have desirable properties including [[antioxidant]] activity (see below); experimental demonstration has been suggestive but inconclusive. Other essential nutrients not classed as vitamins include [[essential amino acid]]s (see [[#Protein|above]]), [[essential fatty acid]]s (see [[#Essential fatty acids|above]]), and the minerals discussed in the preceding section.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Vitamin deficiencies may result in disease conditions: [[goiter]], [[scurvy]], [[osteoporosis]], impaired [[immune system]], disorders of cell [[metabolism]], certain forms of cancer, symptoms of premature [[aging]], and poor [[psychology|psychological health]] (including [[eating disorders]]), among many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year=2005 | title=Modern Nutrition in Health and Disease | publisher=Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | isbn=978-0-7817-4133-0| author=Shils | displayauthors=etal   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malnutrition==
{{Main article|Malnutrition}}

Malnutrition refers to insufficient, excessive, or imbalanced consumption of nutrients. In developed countries, the diseases of malnutrition are most often associated with nutritional imbalances or excessive consumption.
Although there are more people in the world who are malnourished due to excessive consumption, according to the United Nations [[World Health Organization]], the greatest challenge in developing nations today is not starvation, but insufficient nutrition – the lack of nutrients necessary for the growth and maintenance of vital functions. The causes of malnutrition are directly linked to inadequate macronutrient consumption and disease, and are indirectly linked to factors like “household food security, maternal and child care, health services, and the environment.” &lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt;

===Mental disorders===

Nutritional supplement treatment may be appropriate for major [[Clinical depression|depression]], [[bipolar disorder]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], the four most common mental disorders in developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Lakhan SE, Vieira KF |title= Nutritional therapies for mental disorders |journal= Nutr J |volume=7 |page=2 |year=2008 |pmid=18208598 |pmc= 2248201 |doi=10.1186/1475-2891-7-2 |url=http://www.nutritionj.com/content/7/1/2 |issue=1|last2= Vieira }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because Lakhan and Vieira mentioned that the supplements possess amino acids that may change into neurotransmitters and improve mental disorders. Supplements that have been studied most for mood elevation and stabilization include [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] and [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (each of which are an [[omega-3 fatty acid]] contained in [[fish oil]], but not in [[flaxseed oil]]), [[vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[folic acid]], and [[inositol]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Cancer===

Cancer has become common in developing countries. According to a study by the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]], "In the developing world, cancers of the liver, stomach and esophagus were more common, often linked to consumption of carcinogenic preserved foods, such as smoked or salted food, and parasitic infections that attack organs." Lung cancer rates are rising rapidly in poorer nations because of increased use of tobacco. Developed countries "tended to have cancers linked to affluence or a 'Western lifestyle' – cancers of the colon, rectum, breast and prostate – that can be caused by obesity, lack of exercise, diet and age."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael |last=Coren| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/HEALTH/03/09/cancer.study/index.html | title=Study: Cancer no longer rare in poorer countries | publisher= CNN | date=2005-03-10 | accessdate=2007-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive worldwide report, "[[Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity and the Prevention of Cancer: a Global Perspective]]", compiled by the [[World Cancer Research Fund]] and the [[American Institute for Cancer Research]], reports that there is a significant relation between lifestyle (including food consumption) and [[cancer prevention]]. The same report recommends eating mostly foods of plant origin and aiming to meet [[nutritional needs]] through diet alone, while limiting consumption of [[energy]]-dense foods, [[red meat]], [[alcoholic drink]]s and [[salt]] and avoiding [[sugary drink]]s, [[processed meat]] and moldy [[cereals]] (grains) or [[Pulse (legume)|pulses]] (legumes). Protein consumption leads to an increase in [[IGF-1]], which plays a role in cancer development.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Metabolic syndrome and obesity===

Several lines of evidence indicate lifestyle-induced [[hyperinsulinemia]] and reduced insulin function (i.e. [[insulin resistance]]) as decisive factors in many disease states. For example, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance are strongly linked to chronic inflammation, which in turn is strongly linked to a variety of adverse developments such as arterial microinjuries and [[clot]] formation (i.e. heart disease) and exaggerated cell division (i.e. cancer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fernández-García JC |title=Inflammation, oxidative stress and metabolic syndrome: dietary modulation |url= |journal=Curr Vasc Pharmacol |year=2013 |volume= 11|issue=October |pages=1570–1611 |doi= |pmc= |pmid=24168441  |displayauthors=etal  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance (the so-called [[metabolic syndrome]]) are characterized by a combination of abdominal [[obesity]], elevated [[blood sugar]], elevated [[blood pressure]], elevated blood [[triglycerides]], and reduced HDL [[cholesterol]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Obesity can unfavourably alter hormonal and metabolic status via resistance to the hormone [[leptin]], and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin/[[leptin]] resistance and obesity aggravate one another. The vicious cycle is putatively fuelled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, as a result of high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the [[hypothalamus]] in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued overfeeding despite large body fat stores.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

There is a debate about how and to what extent different dietary factors – such as intake of processed carbohydrates, total protein, fat, and carbohydrate intake, intake of saturated and trans fatty acids, and low intake of vitamins/minerals – contribute to the development of insulin and leptin resistance. Evidence indicates that diets possibly protective against metabolic syndrome include low saturated and [[trans fat]] intake and foods rich in [[dietary fiber]], such as high consumption of fruits and vegetables and moderate intake of low-fat dairy products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Feldeisen SE, Tucker KL |year= 2007|title=Nutritional strategies in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome |url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/h06-101?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&amp;#.UnaZ2FPDIwA |journal=Applied Physiology, Nutrition, and Metabolism|volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=46–60 |doi=10.1139/h06-101 |pmc= |pmid=17332784 |accessdate=November 3, 2013|last2= Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global nutrition challenges==
The challenges facing global nutrition are disease, child malnutrition, obesity, and vitamin deficiency.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Disease===
The most common non-infectious diseases worldwide, that contribute most to the global mortality rate, are cardiovascular diseases, various cancers, diabetes, and chronic respiratory problems, all of which are linked to poor nutrition. Nutrition and diet are closely associated with the leading causes of death, including cardiovascular disease and cancer. Obesity and high sodium intake can contribute to ischemic heart disease, while consumption of fruits and vegetables can decrease the risk of developing cancer.&lt;ref name=" GNP " /&gt;

Foodborne and infectious diseases can result in malnutrition, and malnutrition exacerbates infectious disease. Poor nutrition leaves children and adults more susceptible to contracting life-threatening diseases such as diarrheal infections and respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; According to the WHO, in 2011, 6.9 million children died of infectious diseases like pneumonia, diarrhea, malaria, and neonatal conditions, of which at least one third were associated with undernutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNICEF 2012 Progress Report: Rapid progress in child survival|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/news/2012/20120913_unicef_childsurvivalreport/en/|accessdate=28 May 2016|publisher=World Health Organization|date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ENA4"&gt;WHO.

===Child malnutrition===
{{Main article|Child malnutrition}}
According to UNICEF, in 2011, 101 million children across the globe were underweight and one in four children, 165 million, were stunted in growth.&lt;ref name=ENA1&gt;UNICEF, WHO, World Bank. UNICEF-WHO-World Bank Joint child malnutrition estimates. New York, Geneva &amp; Washington DC, UNICEF, WHO &amp; World Bank, 2012 (http://www.who.int/nutgrowthdb/estimates/en/index.html, accessed 27 March 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, there are 43 million children under five who are overweight or obese.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Nearly 20 million children under 5 suffer from severe acute malnutrition, a life-threatening condition requiring urgent treatment.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; According to estimations at [[UNICEF]], [[hunger]] will be responsible for 5.6 million deaths of children under the age of five this year.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children"/&gt; These all represent significant public health emergencies.&lt;ref name="GNP"&gt;WHO (2013).

Geneva, World Health Organization. http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/84408/1/9789241505529_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This is because proper maternal and child nutrition has immense consequences for survival, acute and chronic disease incidence, normal growth, and economic productivity of individuals.&lt;ref name="Maternal undernutrition"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)60937-X |title=Maternal and child undernutrition and overweight in low-income and middle-income countries |year=2013 |last1=Black |first1=Robert E |last2=Victora |first2=Cesar G |last3=Walker |first3=Susan P |last4=Bhutta |first4=Zulfiqar A |last5=Christian |first5=Parul |last6=De Onis |first6=Mercedes |last7=Ezzati |first7=Majid |last8=Grantham-Mcgregor |first8=Sally |last9=Katz |first9=Joanne |last10=Martorell |first10=Reynaldo |last11=Uauy |first11=Ricardo |journal=The Lancet |volume=382 |issue=9890 |pages=427–51 |pmid=23746772 |author12=Maternal Child Nutrition Study Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Childhood [[malnutrition]] is common and contributes to the [[Disease burden|global burden of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Murray C, Lopez A | title = Global mortality, disability, and the contribution of risk factors: Global Burden of Disease Study | journal = Lancet | volume = 349 | issue = 9063 | pages = 1436–42 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9164317 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(96)07495-8| last2 = Lopez }}&lt;/ref&gt; Childhood is a particularly important time to achieve good nutrition status, because poor nutrition has the capability to lock a child in a vicious cycle of disease susceptibility and recurring sickness, which threatens cognitive and social development.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Undernutrition and bias in access to food and health services leaves children less likely to attend or perform well in school.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Undernutrition===
{{Main article|Undernutrition}}
UNICEF defines undernutrition “as the outcome of insufficient food intake (hunger) and repeated infectious diseases. Under nutrition includes being underweight for one’s age, too short for one’s age (stunted), dangerously thin (wasted), and deficient in vitamins and minerals (micronutrient malnutrient).&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Under nutrition causes 53% of deaths of children under five across the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; It has been estimated that undernutrition is the underlying cause for 35% of child deaths.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Black RE | year = 2008 | title = Maternal and child undernutrition: global and regional exposures and health consequences | url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 371 | issue = 9608| pages = 243–260 | doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(07)61690-0| pmid = 18207566 | author2 = and others | displayauthors = 1 | last3 = Bhutta | last4 = Caulfield | last5 = De Onis | last6 = Ezzati | last7 = Mathers | last8 = Rivera }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Maternal and Child Nutrition Study Group estimate that under nutrition, “including fetal growth restriction, stunting, wasting, deficiencies of vitamin A and zinc along with suboptimum breastfeeding- is a cause of 3.1 million child deaths and infant mortality, or 45% of all child deaths in 2011”.&lt;ref name="Maternal undernutrition" /&gt;

When humans are undernourished, they no longer maintain normal bodily functions, such as growth, resistance to infection, or have satisfactory performance in school or work.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Major causes of under nutrition in young children include lack of proper breast feeding for infants and illnesses such as diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, and HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; According to UNICEF 146 million children across the globe, that one out of four under the age of five, are underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The amount of underweight children has decreased since 1990, from 33 percent to 28 percent between 1990 and 2004.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Underweight and stunted children are more susceptible to infection, more likely to fall behind in school, more likely to become overweight and develop non-infectious diseases, and ultimately earn less than their non-stunted coworkers.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION"&gt;IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION &gt; UNICEF. (April 2013). IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION: The achievable imperative for global progress. http://www.unicef.org/publications/index_68661.html&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, undernutrition can accumulate deficiencies in health which results in less productive individuals and societies &lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Many children are born with the inherent disadvantage of low birth weight, often caused by intrauterine growth restriction and poor maternal nutrition, which results in worse growth, development, and health throughout the course of their lifetime.&lt;ref name="GNP" /&gt; Children born at low birthweight (less than 5.5 pounds or 2.5&amp;nbsp;kg), are less likely to be healthy and are more susceptible to disease and early death.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Those born at low birthweight also are likely to have a depressed immune system, which can increase their chances of heart disease and diabetes later on in life.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Because 96% of low birthweight occurs in the developing world, low birthweight is associated with being born to a mother in poverty with poor nutritional status that has had to perform demanding labor.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Stunting and other forms of undernutrition reduces a child’s chance of survival and hinders their optimal growth and health.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Stunting has demonstrated association with poor brain development, which reduces cognitive ability, academic performance, and eventually earning potential.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt;  Important determinants of stunting include the quality and frequency of infant and child feeding, infectious disease susceptibility, and the mother’s nutrition and health status.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Undernourished mothers are more likely to birth stunted children, perpetuating a cycle of undernutrition and poverty.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Stunted children are more likely to develop obesity and chronic diseases upon reaching adulthood.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Therefore, malnutrition resulting in stunting can further worsen the obesity epidemic, especially in low and middle income countries.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; This creates even new economic and social challenges for vulnerable impoverished groups.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt;

Data on global and regional food supply shows that consumption rose from 2011-2012 in all regions. Diets became more diverse, with a decrease in consumption of cereals and roots and an increase in fruits, vegetables, and meat products.&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;FAO (2012). The state of food insecurity in the world 2012: Economic growth is necessary but not sufficient to accelerate reduction of hunger and malnutrition. Rome, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations. http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/ (Accessed 7 December 2012.).&lt;/ref&gt; However, this increase masks the discrepancies between nations, where Africa, in particular, saw a decrease in food consumption over the same years.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; This information is derived from food balance sheets that reflect national food supplies, however, this does not necessarily reflect the distribution of micro and macronutrients.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; Often inequality in food access leaves distribution which uneven, resulting in undernourishment for some and obesity for others.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;

Undernourishment, or hunger, according to the FAO, is dietary intake below the minimum daily energy requirement.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; The amount of undernourishment is calculated utilizing the average amount of food available for consumption, the size of the population, the relative disparities in access to the food, and the minimum calories required for each individual.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; According to FAO, 868 million people (12% of the global population) were undernourished in 2012.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; This has decreased across the world since 1990, in all regions except for Africa, where undernourishment has steadily increased.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt;  However, the rates of decrease are not sufficient to meet the first Millennium Development Goal of halving hunger between 1990 and 2015.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; The global financial, economic, and food price crisis in 2008 drove many people to hunger, especially women and children. The spike in food prices prevented many people from escaping poverty, because the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on food and farmers are net consumers of food.&lt;ref name="UNSCN09"&gt;UNSCN (2009).

===Adult overweight and obesity===
{{main|Overnutrition|Obesity|Overweight}}
Malnutrition in industrialized nations is primarily due to excess calories and non-nutritious carbohydrates, which has contributed to the obesity epidemic affecting both developed and some developing nations.&lt;ref name=P4C48&gt;Darnton-Hill, Ian, C.

[[Vitamin A]] plays an essential role in developing the immune system in children, therefore, it is considered an essential micronutrient that can greatly affect health.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, because of the expense of testing for deficiencies, many developing nations have not been able to fully detect and address vitamin A deficiency, leaving vitamin A deficiency considered a silent hunger.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; According to estimates, subclinical vitamin A deficiency, characterized by low retinol levels, affects 190 million pre-school children and 19 million mothers worldwide.&lt;ref name="VitAWHO"&gt;WHO (2009).

===Infant and young child feeding===
Improvement of breast feeding practices, like early initiation and exclusive breast feeding for the first two years of life, could save the lives of 1.5 million children annually.&lt;ref name=ENA7&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)13811-1 |title=How many child deaths can we prevent this year? |year=2003 |last1=Jones |first1=Gareth |last2=Steketee |first2=Richard W |last3=Black |first3=Robert E |last4=Bhutta |first4=Zulfiqar A |last5=Morris |first5=Saul S |journal=The Lancet |volume=362 |issue=9377 |pages=65–71 |pmid=12853204 |author6=Bellagio Child Survival Study Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrition interventions targeted at infants aged 0–5 months first encourages early initiation of breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Though the relationship between early initiation of breast feeding and improved health outcomes has not been formally established, a recent study in [[Ghana]] suggests a causal relationship between early initiation and reduced infection-caused neo-natal deaths.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Also, experts promote exclusive breastfeeding, rather than using formula, which has shown to promote optimal growth, development, and health of infants.&lt;ref name=ENA2P7&gt;WHO. Report of the expert consultation on the optimal duration of exclusive breastfeeding. Geneva, WHO, 2001.{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exclusive breastfeeding often indicates nutritional status because infants that consume breast milk are more likely to receive all adequate nourishment and nutrients that will aid their developing body and immune system. This leaves children less likely to contract diarrheal diseases and respiratory infections.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Besides the quality and frequency of breastfeeding, the nutritional status of mothers affects infant health.

==International food insecurity and malnutrition==
{{further information|Underweight|Food security|Epidemiology of malnutrition}}
According to UNICEF, South Asia has the highest levels of underweight children under five, followed by sub-Saharan Africans nations, with Industrialized countries and Latin nations having the lowest rates.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

=== United States===
In the United States, 2% of children are underweight, with under 1% [[stunted growth|stunted]] and 6% are [[wasting]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

In the US, [[dietitian]]s are registered (RD) or licensed (LD) with the Commission for Dietetic Registration and the American Dietetic Association, and are only able to use the title "dietitian," as described by the business and professions codes of each respective state, when they have met specific educational and experiential prerequisites and passed a national registration or licensure examination, respectively. In California, registered dietitians must abide by the {{cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2585-2586.8|title=Business and Professions Code of Section 2585-2586.8|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111115758/http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=bpc&amp;group=02001-03000&amp;file=2585-2586.8|archivedate=2010-01-11|df=}}Anyone may call themselves a nutritionist, including unqualified dietitians, as this term is unregulated. Some states, such as the State of Florida, have begun to include the title "nutritionist" in state licensure requirements. Most governments provide guidance on nutrition, and some also impose [[mandatory labeling|mandatory disclosure/labeling]] requirements for processed food manufacturers and restaurants to assist consumers in complying with such guidance..{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In the US, nutritional standards and recommendations are established jointly by the [[USDA|US Department of Agriculture]] and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|US Department of Health and Human Services]]. Dietary and physical activity guidelines from the USDA are presented in the concept of a [[MyPlate|plate of food]] which in 2011 superseded the [[MyPyramid|MyPyramid food pyramid]] that had replaced the [[Four Food Groups]]. The Senate committee currently responsible for oversight of the USDA is the ''Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee''. Committee hearings are often televised on [[C-SPAN]]. The [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] provides a sample week-long menu which fulfills the nutritional recommendations of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308032337/http://www.mypyramid.gov/downloads/sample_menu.pdf |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Canada's Food Guide]] is another governmental recommendation..{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Industrialized countries===
According to [[UNICEF]], the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] has the lowest rates of [[stunted growth|stunting]] and [[wasting]], at 14 percent and 3 percent.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The nations of Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Lithuania and Sweden have the lowest prevalence of low [[birthweight]] children in the world- at 4%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Proper prenatal nutrition is responsible for this small prevalence of low birthweight infants.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, low birthweight rates are increasing, due to the use of [[fertility drugs]], resulting in multiple births, women bearing children at an older age, and the advancement of technology allowing more pre-term infants to survive.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  Industrialized nations more often face malnutrition in the form of over-nutrition from excess calories and non-nutritious carbohydrates, which has contributed greatly to the public health epidemic of obesity.&lt;ref name="P4C48"/&gt; Disparities, according to gender, geographic location and socio-economic position, both within and between countries, represent the biggest threat to child nutrition in industrialized countries. These disparities are a direct product of social inequalities and [[social inequalities]] are rising throughout the industrialized world, particularly in Europe.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===South Asia===
[[South Asia]] has the highest percentage and number of underweight children under five in the world, at approximately 78 million children.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Patterns of stunting and wasting are similar, where 44% have not reached optimal height and 15% are wasted, rates much higher than any other regions.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region of the world has extremely high rates of child underweight- 46% of its child population under five is underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan alone account for half the globe’s underweight child population.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; South Asian nations have made progress towards the [[MDGs]], considering the rate has decreased from 53% since 1990, however, a 1.7% decrease of underweight prevalence per year will not be sufficient to meet the 2015 goal.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Some nations, such as [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Sri Lanka]], on the other hand, have made significant improvements, all decreasing their prevalence by half in ten years.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; While [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] have made modest improvements, [[Nepal]] has made no significant improvement in underweight child prevalence.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Other forms of undernutrition have continued to persist with high resistance to improvement, such as the prevalence of stunting and wasting, which has not changed significantly in the past 10 years.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Causes of this poor nutrition include energy-insufficient diets, poor sanitation conditions, and the gender disparities in educational and social status.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Girls and women face discrimination especially in nutrition status, where South Asia is the only region in the world where girls are more likely to be underweight than boys.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In South Asia, 60% of children in the lowest quintile are underweight, compared to only 26% in the highest quintile, and the rate of reduction of underweight is slower amongst the poorest.&lt;ref name="UNMDG2011"&gt;UN (2011b). The Millennium Development Goals report 2011. New York, United Nations. http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/statistics/mdg-report-2011.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern/South Africa===

The Eastern and Southern African nations have shown no improvement since 1990 in the rate of underweight children under five.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; They have also made no progress in halving hunger by 2015, the most prevalent [[Millennium Development Goal]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This is due primarily to the prevalence of famine, declined agricultural productivity, food emergencies, drought, conflict, and increased poverty.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This, along with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], has inhibited the nutrition development of nations such as [[Lesotho]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Swaziland]], [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Botswana]] has made remarkable achievements in reducing underweight prevalence, dropping 4% in 4 years, despite its place as the second leader in HIV prevalence amongst adults in the globe.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[South Africa]], the wealthiest nation in this region, has the second lowest proportion of underweight children at 12%, but has been steadily increasing in underweight prevalence since 1995.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Almost half of [[Ethiopian]] children are underweight, and along with [[Nigeria]], they account for almost one-third of the underweight under five in all of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===West/Central Africa===
West/[[Central Africa]] has the highest rate of children under five underweight in the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Of the countries in this region, the Congo has the lowest rate at 14%, while the nations of [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]] and [[Togo]] are improving slowly.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In [[Gambia]], rates decreased from 26% to 17% in four years, and their coverage of vitamin A supplementation reaches 91% of vulnerable populations.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region has the next highest proportion of wasted children, with 10% of the population under five not at optimal weight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Little improvement has been made between the years of 1990 and 2004 in reducing the rates of underweight children under five, whose rate stayed approximately the same.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Sierra Leone]] has the highest child under five mortality rate in the world, due predominantly to its extreme infant mortality rate, at 238 deaths per 1000 live births.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Other contributing factors include the high rate of low birthweight children  (23%) and low levels of exclusive breast feeding  (4%).&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Anemia is prevalent in these nations, with unacceptable rates of iron deficient anemia.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The nutritional status of children is further indicated by its high rate of child wasting - 10%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  Wasting is a significant problem in Sahelian countries – [[Burkina Faso]], [[Chad]], [[Mali]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Niger]] – where rates fall between 11% and 19% of under fives, affecting more than 1 million children.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Middle East/North Africa===

Six countries in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] region are on target to meet goals for reducing underweight children by 2015, and 12 countries have prevalence rates below 10%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, the nutrition of children in the region as a whole has degraded for the past ten years due to the increasing portion of underweight children in three populous nations – [[Iraq]], [[Sudan]], and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Forty six percent of all children in [[Yemen]] are underweight, a percentage that has worsened by 4% since 1990.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In Yemen, 53% of children under five are stunted and 32% are born at low birth weight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Sudan has an underweight prevalence of 41%, and the highest proportion of wasted children in the region at 16%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; One percent of households in Sudan consume iodized salt.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Iraq has also seen an increase in child underweight since 1990.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Djibouti]], [[Jordan]], the [[Occupied Palestinian Territory]] (OPT), [[Oman]], the [[Syrian Arab Republic]] and [[Tunisia]] are all projected to meet minimum nutrition goals, with OPT, Syrian AR, and Tunisia the fastest improving regions.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This region demonstrates that undernutrition does not always improve with economic prosperity, where the [[United Arab Emirates]], for example, despite being a wealthy nation, has similar child death rates due to malnutrition to those seen in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

=== East Asia/Pacific===

The [[East Asia]]/Pacific region has reached its goals on nutrition, in part due to the improvements contributed by [[China]], the region’s most populous country.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; China has reduced its underweight prevalence from 19 percent to 8 percent between 1990 and 2002.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; China played the largest role in the world in decreasing the rate of children under five underweight between 1990 and 2004, halving the prevalence.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; This reduction of underweight prevalence has aided in the lowering of the under 5 mortality rate from 49 to 31 of 1000. They also have a low birthweight rate at 4%, a rate comparable to industrialized countries, and over 90% of households receive adequate iodized salts.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; However, large disparities exist between children in rural and urban areas, where 5 provinces in China leave 1.5 million children iodine deficient and susceptible to diseases.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Singapore]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Indonesia]] are all projected to reach nutrition MDGs.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Singapore]] has the lowest under five mortality rate of any nation, besides [[Iceland]], in the world, at 3%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Cambodia]] has the highest rate of child mortality in the region (141 per 1,000 live births), while still its proportion of underweight children increased by 5 percent to 45% in 2000. Further nutrient indicators show that only 12 per cent of Cambodian babies are exclusively breastfed and only 14 per cent of households consume [[iodized salt]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Latin America/Caribbean===

This region has undergone the fastest progress in decreasing poor nutrition status of children in the world.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;  The [[Latin American]] region has reduced underweight children prevalence by 3.8% every year between 1990 and 2004, with a current rate of 7% underweight.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; They also have the lowest rate of child mortality in the developing world, with only 31 per 1000 deaths, and the highest [[iodine]] consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Cuba]] has seen improvement from 9 to 4 percent underweight under 5 between 1996 and 2004.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The prevalence has also decreased in the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Jamaica]], [[Peru]], and [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Chile has a rate of underweight under 5, at merely 1%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; The most populous nations, [[Brazil]] and [[Mexico]], mostly have relatively low rates of underweight under 5, with only 6% and 8%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; [[Guatemala]] has the highest percentage of underweight and stunted children in the region, with rates above 45%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; There are disparities amongst different populations in this region. For example, children in rural areas have twice the prevalence of underweight at 13%, compared to urban areas at 5%.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

==Nutrition access disparities==

Occurring throughout the world, lack of proper nutrition is both a consequence and cause of poverty.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Impoverished individuals are less likely to have access to nutritious food and to escape from poverty than those who have healthy diets.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Disparities in [[socioeconomic]] status, both between and within nations, provide the largest threat to child nutrition in industrialized nations, where social inequality is on the rise.&lt;ref name=P4C43&gt;{{cite web|title=World Health Organization, European Health Report 2005: Public health action for healthier children and populations|publisher=WHO Regional Office for Europe, Copenhagen|date=2005|url=http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/82435/E87325.pdf?ua=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNICEF, children living in the poorest households are twice as likely to be [[underweight]] as those in the richest.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Those in the lowest wealth [[Household income in the United States#Quintiles|quintile]] and whose mothers have the least education demonstrate the highest rates of child mortality and [[stunted growth|stunting]].&lt;ref name="WHOstats"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO (2013b)|publisher=World health statistics. Geneva, World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/81965/1/9789241564588_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the developing world, socioeconomic inequality in childhood malnutrition is more severe than in upper income brackets, regardless of the general rate of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="VanP"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Van de Poel E|year=2008|title=Socioeconomic inequality in malnutrition in developing countries|journal=Bulletin of the World Health Organization|volume=86|issue=4|pages=241–320|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, the greatest increase in [[childhood obesity]] has been seen in the lower middle income bracket.&lt;ref name="WHOglobe"&gt;{{cite web|title=WHO (2011a). Global status report on noncommunicable diseases 2010|publisher=Geneva, World Health Organization|url=http://www.who.int/nmh/publications/ncd_report2010/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UNICEF, children in rural locations are more than twice as likely to be underweight as compared to children under five in urban areas.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; In Latin American/Caribbean nations, “Children living in rural areas in Bolivia, Honduras, Mexico and Nicaragua are more than twice as likely to be underweight as children living in urban areas. That likelihood doubles to four times in Peru.” &lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

In the United States, the incidence of low birthweight is on the rise among all populations, but particularly among [[minorities]].&lt;ref name=P4C45&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Polhamus B, etal |title=Pediatric Nutrition Surveillance 2003 Report, Table 18D|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta|date=2004|url=https://www.cdc.gov/pednss/pednss_tables/pdf/national_table18.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UNICEF, boys and girls have almost identical rates as underweight children under age 5 across the world, except in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

==Nutrition policy==

===Nutrition interventions===
Nutrition directly influences progress towards meeting the Millennium Goals of eradicating hunger and poverty through health and education.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, nutrition interventions take a multi-faceted approach to improve the nutrition status of various populations. Policy and programming must target both individual behavioral changes and policy approaches to public health. While most nutrition interventions focus on delivery through the health-sector, non-health sector interventions targeting agriculture, water and sanitation, and education are important as well.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Global nutrition micro-nutrient deficiencies often receive large-scale solution approaches by deploying large governmental and non-governmental organizations. For example, in 1990, iodine deficiency was particularly prevalent, with one in five households, or 1.7 billion people, not consuming adequate iodine, leaving them at risk to develop associated diseases.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, a global campaign to iodize salt to eliminate iodine deficiency successfully boosted the rate to 69% of households in the world consuming adequate amounts of iodine.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Emergencies and crises often exacerbate undernutrition, due to the aftermath of crises that include food insecurity, poor health resources, unhealthy environments, and poor healthcare practices.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Therefore, the repercussions of natural disasters and other emergencies can exponentially increase the rates of macro and micronutrient deficiencies in populations.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Disaster relief interventions often take a multi-faceted public health approach. UNICEF’s programming targeting nutrition services amongst disaster settings include nutrition assessments, measles immunization, vitamin A supplementation, provision of fortified foods and micronutrient supplements, support for breastfeeding and complementary feeding for infants and young children, and therapeutic and supplementary feeding.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; For example, during Nigeria’s food crisis of 2005, 300,000 children received therapeutic nutrition feeding programs through the collaboration of UNICEF, the Niger government, the World Food Programme, and 24 NGOs utilizing community and facility based feeding schemes.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

Interventions aimed at pregnant women, infants, and children take a behavioral and program-based approach. Behavioral intervention objectives include promoting proper breast-feeding, the immediate initiation of breastfeeding, and its continuation through 2 years and beyond.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; UNICEF recognizes that to promote these behaviors, healthful environments must be established conducive to promoting these behaviors, like healthy hospital environments, skilled health workers, support in the public and workplace, and removing negative influences.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Finally, other interventions include provisions of adequate micro and macro nutrients such as iron, anemia, and vitamin A supplements and vitamin-fortified foods and ready-to-use products.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt; Programs addressing micro-nutrient deficiencies, such as those aimed at anemia, have attempted to provide iron supplementation to pregnant and lactating women. However, because supplementation often occurs too late, these programs have had little effect.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Interventions such as women’s nutrition, early and exclusive breastfeeding, appropriate complementary food and micronutrient supplementation have proven to reduce stunting and other manifestations of undernutrition.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; A Cochrane review of community-based maternal health packages showed that this community-based approach improved the initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lassi|first=Zohra S.|last2=Bhutta|first2=Zulfiqar A.|date=2015-03-23|title=Community-based intervention packages for reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and improving neonatal outcomes|url=|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=3|pages=CD007754|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007754.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmid=25803792|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some programs have had adverse effects. One example is the “Formula for Oil” relief program in Iraq, which resulted in the replacement of breastfeeding for formula, which has negatively affected infant nutrition.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt;

===Implementation and delivery platforms===
In April 2010, the World Bank and the IMF released a policy briefing entitled “Scaling up Nutrition (SUN): A Framework for action” that represented a partnered effort to address the Lancet’s Series on under nutrition, and the goals it set out for improving under nutrition.&lt;ref name="SUN"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(13)61086-7 |title=Global child and maternal nutrition—the SUN rises |year=2013 |last1=Nabarro |first1=David |journal=The Lancet |volume=382 |issue=9893 |pages=666–7 |pmid=23746773}}&lt;/ref&gt; They emphasized the 1000 days after birth as the prime window for effective nutrition intervention, encouraging programming that was cost-effective and showed significant cognitive improvement in populations, as well as enhanced productivity and economic growth.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; This document was labeled the SUN framework, and was launched by the [[UN General Assembly]] in 2010 as a road map encouraging the coherence of stakeholders like governments, [[academia]], UN system organizations and foundations in working towards reducing under nutrition.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; The SUN framework has initiated a transformation in global nutrition- calling for country-based nutrition programs, increasing evidence based and cost–effective interventions, and “integrating nutrition within national strategies for [[gender equality]], agriculture, [[food security]], [[social protection]], education, water supply, sanitation, and health care”.&lt;ref name="SUN" /&gt; Government often plays a role in implementing nutrition programs through policy. For instance, several East Asian nations have enacted legislation to increase iodization of salt to increase household consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; Political commitment in the form of evidence-based effective national policies and programs, trained skilled community nutrition workers, and effective communication and advocacy can all work to decrease malnutrition.&lt;ref name="IMPROVING CHILD NUTRITION" /&gt; Market and industrial production can play a role as well. For example, in the [[Philippines]], improved production and market availability of iodized salt increased household consumption.&lt;ref name="Progress for Children" /&gt; While most nutrition interventions are delivered directly through governments and health services, other sectors, such as agriculture, water and sanitation, and education, are vital for nutrition promotion as well.&lt;ref name="Essential Nutrition Actions" /&gt;

====Nutrition Education====
{{Main article|Nutrition Education}}
{{Main article|Food_studies#Food_and_Education}}

Nutrition is [[Teaching|taught]] in schools in many countries. In [[England and Wales]] the [[Personal and Social Education]] and Food Technology curricula include nutrition, stressing the importance of a balanced diet and teaching how to read nutrition labels on packaging.  In many schools a Nutrition class will fall within the Family and Consumer Science or Health departments.  In some American schools, students are required to take a certain number of FCS or Health related classes.  Nutrition is offered at many schools, and if it is not a class of its own, nutrition is included in other FCS or Health classes such as: Life Skills, Independent Living, Single Survival, Freshmen Connection, Health etc.  In many Nutrition classes, students learn about the food groups, the food pyramid, Daily Recommended Allowances, calories, vitamins, minerals, malnutrition, physical activity, healthy food choices and how to live a healthy life.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

A 1985 US [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] report entitled ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'' concluded that nutrition education in medical schools was inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Life Sciences. (1985). ''Nutrition Education in US Medical Schools'', [http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=597&amp;page=4  p. 4]. National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Only 20% of the schools surveyed taught nutrition as a separate, required course. A 2006 survey found that this number had risen to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Adams KM, Lindell KC, Kohlmeier M, Zeisel SH |title=Status of nutrition education in medical schools, |journal=Am.

====Protein====
The protein requirement for each individual differs, as do opinions about whether and to what extent physically active people require more protein. The 2005 [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDA), aimed at the general healthy adult population, provide for an intake of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight.&lt;ref name="DRI" /&gt; A review panel stating that "no additional dietary protein is suggested for healthy adults undertaking resistance or endurance exercise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Di Pasquale|first=Mauro G.|title=Sports Nutrition: Energy metabolism and exercise|editor=Ira Wolinsky, Judy A.

====Carbohydrates====
The main fuel used by the body during exercise is carbohydrates, which is stored in muscle as glycogen – a form of sugar. During exercise, muscle glycogen reserves can be used up, especially when activities last longer than 90&amp;nbsp;min.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.extension.iastate.edu/humansciences/content/carbohydrate|title = Iowa State University: Extension and outreach|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the amount of glycogen stored in the body is limited, it is important for athletes participating in endurance sports such as marathons to consume carbohydrates during their events.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==History==
Humans have evolved as [[omnivore|omnivorous]] [[hunter-gatherer]]s over the past 250,000 years. The diet of early modern humans varied significantly depending on location and climate. The diet in the tropics tended to depend more heavily on plant foods, while the diet at higher latitudes tended more towards animal products. Analyses of postcranial and cranial remains of humans and animals from the Neolithic, along with detailed bone-modification studies, have shown that [[cannibalism]] also occurred among prehistoric humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.233.4762.431 |title=Cannibalism in the Neolithic |year=1986 |last1=Villa |first1=P. |last2=Bouville |first2=C. |last3=Courtin |first3=J. |last4=Helmer |first4=D. |last5=Mahieu |first5=E. |last6=Shipman |first6=P. |last7=Belluomini |first7=G. |last8= Branca |first8= M. |journal= Science |volume=233 |issue=4762 |pages=431–7 |pmid= 17794567|bibcode=1986Sci...233..431V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Agriculture]] developed about 10,000 years ago in multiple locations throughout the world, providing [[food grain|grain]]s (such as [[wheat]], [[rice]] and [[maize]]) and [[potatoes]]; and originating staples such as [[bread]] and pasta [[dough]]&lt;ref&gt;

===From antiquity to 1900===
[[Image:Anaxagoras.png|thumb|right|Anaxagoras]]
Around 3000 BC the [[Vedic texts]] made mention of scientific research on nutrition. The Bible's [[Book of Daniel]] recounts first recorded nutritional experiment.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} During an invasion of Judah, King [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] of [[Babylon]] captured Daniel and his friends. Selected as court servants, they were to share in the king's fine foods and wine. But they objected, preferring vegetables ([[Pulse (legume)|pulses]]) and water in accordance with their [[Jewish]] dietary restrictions. The king's chief steward reluctantly agreed to a trial.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Daniel and his friends received their diet for 10 days. On comparison with the king's men, they appeared healthier, and were allowed to continue with their diet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=dan#en-NIV-21743 Daniel 1:5-16] ([http://www.lolcatbible.com/index.php?title=Daniel_1#5 alternative translation])&lt;/ref&gt; Around 475 BC, [[Anaxagoras]] stated that food is absorbed by the human body and therefore contained "homeomerics" (generative components), suggesting the existence of nutrients.&lt;ref name=history /&gt;  Around 400 BC, [[Hippocrates]] said: "Let food be your medicine and medicine be your food."&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.328.7433.0-g |title='Let food be thy medicine…' |year=2004 |last1=Smith |first1=R. |journal=BMJ |volume=328 |issue=7433 |pages=0–g |pmc=318470}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th-century scientist and artist [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) compared [[metabolism]] to a burning candle.  In 1747 Dr. [[James Lind]], a physician in the British navy, performed the first attested [[science|scientific]] nutrition experiment, discovering that [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] juice saved sailors who had been at sea for years from [[scurvy]], a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. The discovery was ignored{{by whom|date=November 2014}} for forty years, but after about 1850 British sailors became known as "[[limey]]s". (Scientists would not identify the essential [[vitamin C]] within lime juice until the 1930s.){{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Around 1770 [[Antoine Lavoisier]], the "Father of Nutrition and Chemistry", discovered the details of metabolism, demonstrating that the [[oxidation]] of food is the source of body heat.  In 1790 [[George Fordyce]] recognized [[calcium]] as necessary for fowl survival.  In the early 19th century, the elements [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] were recognized{{by whom|date=November 2014}} as the primary components of food, and methods to measure their proportions were developed.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1816 [[François Magendie]] discovered that dogs fed only [[carbohydrates]] and [[fat]] lost their body [[protein]] and died in a few weeks, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein as an essential dietary component.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}  In 1840, [[Justus Liebig]] discovered the chemical makeup of carbohydrates ([[sugar]]s), fats ([[fatty acid]]s) and proteins ([[amino acid]]s).  In the 1860s [[Claude Bernard]] discovered that body fat can be synthesized from carbohydrate and protein, showing that the energy in blood [[glucose]] can be stored as fat or as [[glycogen]].{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}} In the early 1880s [[Kanehiro Takaki]] observed that Japanese sailors (whose diets consisted almost entirely of white rice) developed [[beriberi]] (or endemic neuritis, a disease causing heart problems and paralysis), but British sailors and Japanese naval officers did not. Adding various types of vegetables and meats to the diets of Japanese sailors prevented the disease.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1896 [[Eugen Baumann]] observed [[iodine]] in thyroid glands.  In 1897, [[Christiaan Eijkman]] worked with natives of [[Java (island)|Java]], who also suffered from beriberi. Eijkman observed that chickens fed the native diet of white rice developed the symptoms of beriberi, but remained healthy when fed unprocessed brown rice with the outer bran intact. Eijkman cured the natives by feeding them brown rice, demonstrating that food can cure disease. Over two decades later, nutritionists learned that the outer rice bran contains vitamin B.{{medical citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===From 1900 to the present===
In the early 20th century [[Carl von Voit]] and [[Max Rubner]] independently measured [[calorie|caloric]] energy expenditure in different species of animals, applying principles of physics in nutrition. In 1906, Wilcock and [[Frederick Gowland Hopkins|Hopkins]] showed that the amino acid [[tryptophan]] was necessary for the survival of rats. He{{who|date=November 2014}} fed them a special mixture of food containing all the nutrients he believed were essential for survival, but the rats died. A second group of rats to which he also fed an amount of milk containing [[vitamins]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinemann 2e Biology Activity Manual by Judith Brotherton and Kate Mundie{{page needed|date=November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gowland Hopkins]] recognized "accessory food factors" other than calories, protein and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]], as [[Organic compound|organic]] materials essential to health but which the body cannot synthesize. In 1907 [[Stephen M. Babcock]] and [[Edwin B. Hart]] conducted the [[single-grain experiment]]. This experiment ran through 1911.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1912 [[Casimir Funk]] coined the term [[vitamin]] to label a vital factor in the diet: from the words "vital" and "amine," because these unknown substances preventing scurvy, beriberi, and [[pellagra]], were thought then to derive from ammonia. The vitamins were studied{{by whom|date=November 2014}} in the first half of the 20th century. In 1913 [[Elmer McCollum]] discovered the first vitamins, fat-soluble [[vitamin A]] and water-soluble [[vitamin B]] (in 1915; later identified as a complex of several water-soluble vitamins) and named [[vitamin C]] as the then-unknown substance preventing scurvy. [[Lafayette Mendel]] (1872-1935) and [[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Osborne]] (1859–1929) also performed pioneering work on vitamins A and B. In 1919 Sir [[Edward Mellanby]] incorrectly identified [[rickets]] as a vitamin A deficiency, because he could cure it in dogs with [[cod-liver oil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 |title=Unraveling the Enigma of Vitamin D |publisher=United States National Academy of Sciences |date=April 29, 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204111737/http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.txt.asp?a=414 |archivedate=February 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 McCollum destroyed the vitamin A in cod liver oil but found it still cured rickets, thus identifying [[vitamin D]]. Also in 1922, H.M. Evans and L.S. Bishop discovered [[Tocopherol|vitamin E]] as essential for rat pregnancy, and originally called it "food factor X" until 1925.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

In 1925 Hart discovered that [[iron]] absorption requires trace amounts of [[copper]]. In 1927 [[Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus]] synthesized vitamin D, for which he won the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry in 1928. In 1928 [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] isolated [[ascorbic acid]], and in 1932 proved that it is vitamin C by preventing scurvy. In 1935 he synthesized it, and in 1937 won a Nobel Prize for his efforts. Szent-Györgyi concurrently elucidated much of the [[citric acid cycle]]. In the 1930s [[William Cumming Rose]] identified [[essential amino acid]]s, necessary protein components which the body cannot synthesize. In 1935 [[Eric Underwood]] and [[Hedley Marston]] independently discovered the necessity of [[cobalt]]. In 1936 [[Eugene Floyd Dubois]] showed that work and school performance relate to caloric intake. In 1938 [[Erhard Fernholz]] discovered the chemical structure of vitamin E. It was synthesised by [[Paul Karrer]] (1889–1971).{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

From 1940 [[rationing in the United Kingdom]] – during and after World War II – took place according to nutritional principles drawn up by [[Elsie Widdowson]] and others. In 1941 the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] established the first [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]]s (RDAs). In 1992 the U.S. Department of Agriculture introduced the [[Food Guide Pyramid]]. In 2002 a [[Natural Justice]] study showed a relation between nutrition and violent behavior. In 2005 a study found that in addition to bad nutrition, [[adenovirus]] may cause obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1152/ajpregu.00479.2005 |laysummary=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2006-01/aps-coi012506.php |laysource= The American Physiological Society |laydate= January 30, 2006 |title= Adipogenic potential of multiple human adenoviruses in vivo and in vitro in animals |year= 2006 |last1=Whigham |first1=Leah D. |last2 = Israel |first2= Barbara A. |last3=Atkinson |first3=Richard L. |journal= American Journal of Physiology |volume=290 |pages=R190–4 |pmid=16166204 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32587">The '''illegal drug trade in China''' is influenced by factors such as history, location, size, population, and current economic conditions. China has one-fifth of the world's population and a large and expanding economy while [[Opium]] has played an important role in the country's history since before the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s in the mid-19th century. China's large land mass, close proximity to the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]], [[Golden Crescent]], and numerous coastal cities with large and modern port facilities make it an attractive transit center for drug traffickers.

China's status in drug trafficking has changed significantly since the 1980s, when the country for the first time opened its borders to trade and tourism after 40 years of relative [[Isolationism|isolation]]. As trade with Southeast Asia and elsewhere increased, so did the flow of illicit drugs and [[precursor chemical]]s from, into, and through China.

==Overview==
China is a major source of [[precursor chemical]]s necessary for the production of [[cocaine]], heroin, [[MDMA]] and [[crystal methamphetamine]], which are used by many Southeast Asian and [[Pacific Rim]] nations. China produces over 100,000 metric tons of [[acetic anhydride]] each year, and imports an additional 20,000 metric tons from the United States and Singapore. Reports indicate that acetic anhydride is diverted from China to [[morphine]] and heroin refineries in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} China is also a leading exporter of bulk [[ephedrine]] and has been a source country for much of the ephedrine and [[pseudoephedrine]] imported into Mexico; these precursor chemicals are subsequently used to manufacture [[methamphetamine]] destined for the United States. China is developing a significant MDMA production, trafficking, and consumption problem. Although China has taken actions through legislation and regulation of production and exportation of precursor chemicals, extensive action is required to control the illicit diversion and smuggling of precursor chemicals.

China not only continues to be a major transit route for Southeast Asian heroin bound for international drug markets, but also for Southwest Asian heroin entering northwestern China from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. A majority of the Southeast Asian heroin that enters China from Burma transits southern China to various international markets by maritime transport. Drug traffickers take advantage of expanding port facilities in coastal cities, such as [[Qingdao]], Shanghai, [[Tianjin]], and [[Guangdong]], to ship heroin along maritime routes. Southwest Asian heroin (mainly from Afghanistan) represents as much as 22 percent of the heroin entering northwest China. Chinese authorities believe that these trends will increase and they attribute these increases to the continuing development of the infrastructure and economy in China. China is being forced to develop a complex counter-drug strategy that includes prevention, education, eradication, interdiction, and rehabilitation.

==Cultivation and processing==

===Cannabis===
The Dutch historian [[Frank Dikötter]] describes [[cannabis]], which failed to become part of narcotic culture in modern China, as "China's non-problem", despite having been widely grown and known as a medicinal herb for nearly 2,000 years.
&lt;blockquote&gt;[During the [[History of the Republic of China|Republican period]] (1912-1937)], government authorities claimed that smoking cannabis could cause nervous dysfunction and madness. Such official attitudes must have reflected popular beliefs, since very little concrete evidence exists concerning the use of cannabis even in the large coastal metropoles. In Shanghai not a single case of cannabis use was discovered during the 1930s. With the exception of the Uyghurs, the popular perception of the smell of smoked cannabis as 'foul' (''chou'') also impeded its spread. On the other hand, the extraction of hemp oil was widespread in Shanxi, Mongolia and Manchuria. Although most of it appears to have been used for lighting and to lubricate cart wheels, its narcotic powers may have been understood by the local farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Dikötter, Frank, Lars Laamann, and Zhou Xun (2004), '' Narcotic Culture: A History of Drugs in China'', University Of Chicago Press, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Cannabis grows naturally throughout southwestern China, and is legally cultivated in some areas of China for use in commercial [[rope]] manufacturing. Most of the illicit cultivation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis as a drug]] in China appears in [[Xinjiang]] and [[Yunnan]] and is primarily cultivated for domestic use. In 2002, approximately 1.3 metric tons of cannabis were seized in China.

===Ephedra===
The [[Government of China|Chinese Government]] owns and operates [[ephedra]] farms, where ephedra grass (''[[ephedra sinica]]'') is cultivated under strict government control. The active [[alkaloid]]s, [[pseudoephedrine]] and [[ephedrine]], are chemically extracted from the plant material and processed for pharmaceutical purposes. These chemicals are then sold domestically and for export. China and India are the major producers of these chemicals extracted from the ephedra plant. In addition to government-controlled farms, the ephedra plant grows wildly in many parts of the [[North China|northern areas]] of China.

===Opium===
{{hatnote|For the history of opium use within China and the Chinese diaspora, see [[History of opium in China]] and [[Opium den]].}}
Illicit cultivation of the [[opium poppy]] in China is negligible in provinces such as [[Yunnan]], Ningxia, [[Inner Mongolia]], and the remote regions of the northwest frontier. [[Opium]] produced in these areas is not converted into heroin, but is consumed locally by [[ethnic minority]] groups in these isolated areas. Chinese officials report that in the last several years{{when|date=March 2014}} no [[Clandestine chemistry|heroin laboratories]] have been seized in China.

Legal cultivation of the opium poppy occurs on farms controlled by the [[Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Agriculture]] and the National Drug Administration Bureau of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]]. According to United Nations (U.N.) [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) data, China produces approximately {{convert|14|MT|lb}} of legal opium per year for use in the domestic [[Pharmaceutical industry in China|pharmaceutical industry]]. China reports that none of this opium is exported.

The [[Mao Zedong]] government is generally credited with eradicating both consumption and production of opium during the 1950s using unrestrained repression and social reform.{{Citation needed| reason=who conducted a survey that concludes "generally credited"?| date=August 2013}} Ten million addicts were forced into compulsory treatment, dealers were executed, and opium-producing regions were planted with new crops. Remaining opium production shifted south of the Chinese border into the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] region.&lt;ref name="McCoy opium"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.a1b2c3.com/drugs/opi010.htm |title=Opium History, 1858 to 1940 |author=Alfred W. McCoy |accessdate=May 4, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404134938/http://www.a1b2c3.com/drugs/opi010.htm |archivedate=April 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remnant opium trade primarily served Southeast Asia, but spread to American soldiers during the [[Vietnam War]], with 20 percent of soldiers regarding themselves as addicted during the peak of the epidemic in 1971. In 2003, China was estimated to have four million regular drug users and one million registered drug addicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/FD29Ad01.html|title=Banned in China for sex, drugs, disaffection|author=Michael Mackey|date=April 29, 2004|accessdate=June 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic drugs===
Manufacture of [[crystal methamphetamine]] (''ice'', ''shabu'', ''bingdu'') is facilitated by the availability of [[precursor chemical]]s, such as [[pseudoephedrine]] and [[ephedrine]]. The unrestricted availability of these chemicals in the country facilitates the production of large quantities of crystal methamphetamine. Seizure information indicates that methamphetamine laboratories are located in provinces along the eastern and southeastern coastal areas. Many of the traffickers for the clandestine crystal methamphetamine laboratories are from [[organized crime]] groups based in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan.

Because of its increasing popularity with young party goers in Beijing, Shanghai, [[Nanjing]], [[Guangzhou]], and [[Shenzhen]], Chinese [[Law enforcement in China|law enforcement]] officials report significant increases in the domestic production of [[MDMA]] (''Ecstasy''). Most MDMA production in China is for domestic consumption.  MDMA tablets are also imported from the Netherlands into China to meet the demand.

Some laboratory operators in China mix MDMA powder, imported from Europe, with substances, such as [[caffeine]] and [[ketamine]], while making the Ecstasy tablets. Given the availability of the precursor chemicals needed, [[open source]] reporting in 2006 indicates that MDMA tablets in China cost only US$0.06 to produce, while the tablets sell for as much as US$36 in the city of Shanghai.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

===Trafficking groups===
Many of the individuals involved in the international trafficking of Southeast Asian heroin are ethnic [[Kokang]], [[Yunnanese]], [[Fujianese people|Fujianese]], [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]], or members of other [[Overseas Chinese|ethnic Chinese]] minority groups that reside outside of China. These groups reside, and are actively involved in drug trafficking in regions such as Burma, Cambodia, Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States.

Reporting on the activities of drug trafficking organizations in China is sparse. However, Chinese officials report that drug traffickers are dividing their large shipments into smaller ones in order to minimize losses in case of seizure. Chinese officials also report that drug traffickers are increasingly using women, children, and poor, uneducated farmers to body-carry drugs from the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]] area to [[Guangdong]] and other provinces in China.

In China many individuals and criminal organizations involved in drug trafficking are increasingly arming themselves with [[automatic weapon]]s and [[grenade]]s to protect their drug shipments from theft by rival organizations. Many firefights occur along the Burma–China border, where larger drug shipments are more prevalent. Traffickers also arm themselves to avoid being captured by the police, and some smugglers are better armed than the local police forces. Furthermore, many traffickers believe they have a better chance of surviving a firefight than the outcome of any legal proceedings. In China, sentencing for drug trafficking could include capital punishment. For example, the seizure of 50&amp;nbsp;grams or more of heroin or crystal methamphetamine could result in the use of the death penalty by the Government.

===Heroin===
[[Image:China pol01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|China's borders (click to enlarge)]]
China shares a 2000&amp;nbsp;km border with Burma, as well as smaller but significant borders with Laos and Vietnam. Chinese officials state that the majority of heroin entering China comes over the border from Burma. This heroin then transits southern China, through [[Yunnan]] or [[Guangxi]], to [[Guangdong]] or [[Fujian]] to the southeastern coastal areas, and then on to international markets. Heroin is transported by various overland methods to ports in China's southeastern provinces of Guangdong and Fujian.

Heroin is transported to Guangdong and to the cities of [[Xiamen]] and [[Fuzhou]] in Fujian for shipment to international drug markets. Traffickers take advantage of expanding port facilities in northeast cities, such as [[Qingdao]], Shanghai, and [[Tianjin]], to ship heroin via maritime routes. Increased Chinese [[interdiction]] efforts along the Burma–China border have forced some traffickers to send heroin from Burma to China's southeastern provinces by [[Commercial trawler|fishing trawler]]s.

In addition to Southeast Asian heroin entering into China, Southwest Asian heroin enters northwestern China from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. Chinese authorities state that Southwest Asian heroin (mainly originating from Afghanistan) represents as much as 20 percent of the heroin that enters the northwest [[Xinjiang]]. This trend is increasing, and is attributed to the continuing development of the infrastructure and economy in the [[West China|western parts]] of China.

===Synthetic drugs===
Due to the availability of the [[precursor chemical]]s, traffickers produce large amounts of [[crystal methamphetamine]]. Although much of the crystal methamphetamine is consumed locally, some is available for shipment to other markets throughout Southeast Asia. Several ports in [[Northern and southern China|southern China]] serve as transit points for crystal methamphetamine transported by [[containerized cargo]] to international drug markets.

Some MDMA traffickers in China are linked directly to the United States. In June 2001, tablets from seizures in two [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] San Francisco investigations were linked to the same source as a 300,000-tablet seizure in [[Shenzhen]], China that had occurred days before. Although the San Francisco seizures were much smaller than the Shenzhen seizure, the capabilities of these trafficking groups appear to be significant. Chinese officials seized over 3 million Ecstasy tablets in China in 2002.

===Precursor chemicals===
China is of paramount importance in global cooperative efforts to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals. With its large [[chemical industry]], China remains a source country for legitimately produced chemicals that are diverted for production of heroin and [[cocaine]], as well as many [[amphetamine]]-type [[stimulant]]s. China and its neighbor India are the leading exporters of [[Bulk cargo|bulk]] [[ephedrine]] in the world. China produces over 100,000 [[metric ton]]s of [[acetic anhydride]] each year, and imports an additional 20,000 metric tons from the United States and Singapore. China is also the second largest producer of [[potassium permanganate]] in the world.

To combat the diversion of precursor chemicals, China implemented several regulations on the control of precursor chemicals between 1992 and 1998, including adoption of the 1988 [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances|U.N. Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances]] in 1993. Additionally, the Government further improved regulations to strengthen control of [[ephedrine]] during 1999 and 2000.

China fully participates in the DEA's Operations TOPAZ and PURPLE, which are international monitoring initiatives that target [[acetic anhydride]] and [[potassium permanganate]], respectively. Acetic anhydride is used to synthesize [[morphine]] base into heroin, and potassium permanganate is used as an [[oxidizer]] in cocaine production. Both chemicals are targeted because they are the chemicals most often preferred, and most widely used, by illicit drug manufacturers. However, the effectiveness of Operation PURPLE has been declining recently, since participant nations are exporting significant amounts of potassium permanganate to non-participant countries.

Additionally, Chinese authorities further control the export of [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]] through the voluntary use of the [[Letter of Non-Objection]] (LONO) system. China will not allow exports of ephedrine or pseudoephedrine without a positive affirmation by authorities in the importing country as to the [[bona fide]]s of the consignee. For those countries that do not issue import permits, a letter of non-objection must be provided to Chinese authorities.

China is a source country for significant amounts of the [[ephedrine]] and [[pseudoephedrine]] exported to Mexico, and subsequently used to manufacture [[methamphetamine]] destined for the United States.

Increases in pseudoephedrine diversion were noted, beginning with the seizures in March and April 2003 of four shipments of product destined for Mexico. The seizures occurred in the United States and Panama, and totaled over 22 million, 60-milligram pseudoephedrine tablets. The source of supply has been identified as legitimate [[pharmaceutical companies]] in Hong Kong. Additional investigations have revealed other companies in Hong Kong that have been engaged in supplying substantial amounts of pseudoephedrine to firms, sometime fictitious, shells or fronts, in Mexico.

Also, reports indicate that acetic anhydride is diverted from China to morphine/heroin [[refineries]] found in the [[Golden Triangle (Southeast Asia)|Golden Triangle]]. Domestically, Chinese officials express concern over the increasing number of [[chemical synthesis|synthetic drug]] production operations in their country. Seizures of precursor chemicals in China increased from 50 metric tons in 1991 to 383 metric tons in 1997; only 300 metric tons were seized in 2002.

==Drug-related money laundering==
In the past [[money laundering]] was not considered a significant problem in China. However, with the booming economy promoting greater trade investment and the ever-increasing number of foreign bank branches opening throughout the country, it appears that China may become an emerging money laundering center.

China, however, has taken some initial steps to begin investigation of money laundering activities. An Economic Crimes Investigation Department was established in the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]] to focus on illicit activities. The [[People's Bank of China]] (China's central bank) began several structural reforms such as the establishment of two new divisions, the Payment Trade Supervisory Division and the Money Laundering Working Division. The People's Bank of China also prepared guidelines for use by financial institutions to report suspicious [[Financial transaction|transaction]]s, and to sensitize the public about new regulations on money laundering and [[terrorist financing]] issues.

The major drugs of choice are injectable heroin, [[morphine]], smokeable [[opium]], [[crystal methamphetamine]], [[nimetazepam]], [[temazepam]], and [[MDMA]]. Preferences between opium and heroin/morphine, and methods of administration, differ from region to region within China. The use of heroin and opium has increased among the younger population, as income has grown and the youth have more free time. China considers crystal methamphetamine abuse second to heroin/morphine as a major drug problem. The use of MDMA has only recently become popular in China's growing urban areas.

The ''South China Morning Post'' reports the rise in the use of ketamine, easy to mass-produce in illicit labs in southern China, particularly among the young. Because of its low cost, and low profit margin, drug peddlers rely on mass distribution to make money, thus increasing its penetrative power to all, including schoolchildren. The journal cites social workers saying that four people can get high by sharing just HK$20 worth of ketamine, and estimates 80 per cent of young drug addicts take 'K'.&lt;ref&gt;Yeung, Philip (9 April 2010), We have a way; where's the will to tackle drugs?, ''South China Morning Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addict population===
As of 2013, there were 2,475,000 registered  [[drug addiction|drug addicts]] in China, 1,326,000 of which where addicted to heroin, accounting for 53.6% of the addict population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/A-Peoples-War-final.pdf|title=A People’s War: China’s Struggle to Contain its Illicit Drug Problem|last=|first=|date=|website=Brookings|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some unofficial estimates range as high as 12 million drug addicts. Of the registered drug addicts, 83.7 percent are male and 73.9 percent are under the age of 35. 

In 2001, intravenous heroin users accounted for 70.9 percent of the confirmed 22,000 [[human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) and [[acquired immune deficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) cases. Chinese officials are becoming increasingly concerned about the abuse of [[methamphetamine]] and other [[amphetamine]]-type [[stimulant]]s.

===Treatment and demand reduction programs===
Both voluntary and compulsory [[Drug rehabilitation|drug treatment]] programs are provided in China, although the compulsory treatment is more common. Most addicts who attend these centers do so involuntarily upon orders from the Government. Voluntary treatment is provided at centers operated by [[Public Health]] Bureaus, but these programs are more expensive and many people cannot afford to attend them. Addicts, who return to drug use after having received treatment, and who cannot be cured by other means, may be sentenced to [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] at any one of the special centers for [[re-education through labor]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These centers are run under conditions similar to prisons, including isolation from the outside world, restricted patient movement and a paramilitary routine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Demand reduction efforts target individuals between the ages of 17 and 35, since this is the largest segment of drug users. These efforts include, but are not limited to, media campaigns and establishment of drug-free communities.

==Drug law enforcement agencies and legislation==
At the national level, the agencies specifically responsible for the control of legal and illicit drugs are the [[Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Health]], the [[Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Public Security]], and the [[Customs General Administration]]. The [[State Food and Drug Administration]] oversees implementation of the laws regulating the [[Pharmaceutical industry in China|pharmaceutical industry]]. In the Customs General Administration, the Smuggling Prevention Department plays the major role in intercepting illegal drug shipments. The Narcotics Control Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security handles all criminal investigations involving [[opium]], heroin, and [[methamphetamine]].

In 1990, the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] set up the {{ill|National Narcotics Control Commission|zh|国家禁毒委员会}} (NNCC), composed of 25 departments, including the Ministry of Public Security, Ministry of Health and General Administration of Customs. The NNCC leads the nation's drug control work in a unified way, and is responsible for international drug control cooperation, with an operational agency based in the Ministry of Public Security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/mzpkz/t36387.htm|title=Narcotics Control in China|website=www.china-embassy.org|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaties and conventions==
China is a party to the 1988 U.N. [[United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances|Drug Convention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=VI-19&amp;chapter=6&amp;clang=_en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 1961 U.N. [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]] as amended by the 1972 Protocol,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=VI-15&amp;chapter=6&amp;lang=en|title=United Nations Treaty Collection|language=EN|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 1971 U.N. [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unodc.org/pdf/convention_1971_en.pdf|title=CONVENTION ON PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES , 1971|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; China is a member of the [[International Criminal Police Organization]] (INTERPOL), and has been a member of the [[International Narcotics Control Board|INCB]] since 1984.

China also participates in a drug control program with Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Russia, and the United States. This program is designed to enhance information sharing and coordination of drug law enforcement activities by countries in and around the Central Asian Region.

In June 2000, China and the United States signed a Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement (MLAT). This treaty subsequently went into effect on March 8, 2001. In 1999, China and the United States signed a Bilateral Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement. However, this agreement has not yet been activated. A May 1997 United States and China [[Memorandum of Understanding]] on law enforcement cooperation allows the two countries to provide assistance on drug investigations and prosecutions on a case-by-case basis.

China has over 30 MLATs with 24 nations covering both civil and criminal matters. In 1996, China signed MLATs that gave specific attention to drug trafficking with Russia, Mexico, and Pakistan. China also signed a drug control cooperation agreement with India.

China and Burma continue dialogue on counter-drug issues, such as drug trafficking by the [[United Wa State Army]] along the China–Burma border. The Government of China encourages and provides assistance for alternative crop programs in Burma along the China–Burma border. China is also building on Memoranda of Understanding that are currently in place with Burma, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]].

'''Lago di Malciaussia''' is a [[reservoir]] situated at an elevation of 1,805 metres &lt;ref name=laghi&gt;{{cite book|title=Atlante dei laghi Piemontesi| author=Direzione Pianificazione delle Risorse Idriche |publisher=  Regione Piemonte | year= 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the upper [[Valle di Viù]] in the north-west [[Italy|Italian]] [[province of Turin]].

== History ==
[[File:Costruzione diga Malciaussia.jpg|thumb|Dam building]]
The reservoir was constructed in the 1920s and 1930s by damming the [[Stura di Viù]], a tributary of the [[Stura di Lanzo]], for the generation of [[hydropower]]. It is named after the locality Malciaussia—a ''[[frazione]]'' of the [[comune|commune]] of [[Usseglio]]—which was submerged when it was filled.

== Hiking ==
The valley road terminates at this lake which makes it a convenient starting point for walking and climbing in the high [[Alps]]. From here one can ascend [[Rocciamelone]] (3,538 m), via the [[Mountain hut|alpine hut]] “Ernesto Tazzetti”. The routes to Monte Lera, Punta Costan and [[Punta Sulè]] start as well from the lake.&lt;ref name=beru&gt;{{cite book|last= Berutto |first= Giulio |title= Valli di Lanzo e Moncenisio |year= 1983 |publisher= Istituto Geografico Centrale |location = Torino }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Latin Jam Workout''' is a [[Latin dance|Latin Dance]] Fitness Program created by professional athlete and choreographer JP Santana.  Founded in 2007 in [[Los Angeles, California]], Latin Jam Workout combines [[Techno music|techno]] and [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] with dance and [[aerobics|aerobic]] movements. It is a fusion of Latin dance steps such as [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]], [[Merengue (dance)|Merengue]], [[Raeggaeton]], [[Cumbia]], [[Samba]], [[Soca music|Soca]], [[Belly-Dancing]] and the faster-paced rhythms of [[Pop music|Pop]] and Techno. 

Latin Jam Workout is taught in fitness venues, gyms, dance studios, schools and community centers by certified instructors.

==Program==

Classes usually run one hour, divided into an initial 15-minute warm-up, a core segment and a final cool-down. Latin Jam classes use an exclusive musical mix. The warm-up features fast-paced pop and techno beats to raise body temperature and [[heart rate]], while the core part of the class features a mix of fast and slow rhythms to combine [[Aerobic exercise|aerobic]] and [[Endurance training|resistance training]].

==History==
Latin Jam Workout was created by JP Santana in Los Angeles, in 2009. Since then, this fitness program has been introduced to [[Northern California]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]] and [[Nevada]]. Santana created this concept to provide a complete body work-out designed to assist with [[weight loss]] with the entertainment of Latin Music that has proven to be successful in his native [[Colombia]] as well as other countries in [[Latin America]].

'''Mushbooh''' ({{lang-ar|مشبوه}}) is a [[Islamic dietary laws|food designation in Islam]]. Literally meaning "doubtful" or "suspect," foods are labeled mushbooh when it is unclear whether they are ''[[Halal]]'' (consumption is permitted) or [[Haraam]]([[haram]]) (consumption is prohibited).

The '''Narmada Kidney Foundation''' was established in [[Mumbai]], [[India]] in 1993,  by Dr. Bharat V. Shah. Its aim is to support patients with [[renal]] problems, and to aid their families.

Its foundation was named after its founder's mother, Narmadaben Shah. “Life shared, life lived” is the Foundation's guiding principle.
{{Citation needed|reason=citation needed to prove claim|date=May 2014}}

==Role==
Today, the Foundation is India's only [[Non-governmental organization]] that not only provides information about kidney diseases but also how they can be prevented from occurring.

The activities in which the organization is involved are prevention camps, regular educational programs, printing and publishing of education materials, subsidized rate medicines and cadaver transplantation promotion.

The Foundation's annual Transplant Games were first held in 2008;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hindu.com/holnus/007200812261240.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107155230/http://www.hindu.com/holnus/007200812261240.htm |archivedate=2012-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Donor’s Day has been celebrated every year since 1997, on November 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-11-30/mumbai/28110441_1_kidney-transplant-cadaver-organ-donation-organ-donors |title=India News, Latest Sports, Bollywood, World, Business &amp; Politics News - Times of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
In 2003, the Foundation was named in a story regarding the sale of donor kidneys. This is false. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By: |url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2004/jan/74640.htm |title=You are here: Home &amp;gt; News &amp;gt; |publisher=Mid-day.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3625">The National Ag Safety Database (NASD) was developed with funding from the [[United States]] [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH), the US [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], and the [[USDA]] [[Cooperative Extension Service]] (CES). The information contained in NASD was contributed by safety professionals and organizations from across the [[United States]]. Specifically, the objectives of the NASD project are: 1) to provide a national resource for the dissemination of information; 2) to educate workers and managers about occupational hazards associated with agriculture-related injuries, deaths and illnesses; 3) to provide prevention information; 4) to promote the consideration of safety and health issues in agricultural operations; and 5) to provide a convenient way for members of the agricultural safety and health community to share educational and research materials with their colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joe.org/joe/2004february/tt5.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of NASD==

The original concept of NASD was a deliverable collection of safety materials contained within CD-ROMs, where the updates on CD would be periodically released. In October 1993, NIOSH provided funding through its Agricultural Health Promotion System (AHPS) grant program to develop the first CD-ROM NASD through the University of Florida's Cooperative Extension Service(CES). The first prototype of the CD-ROM collection was delivered to a select group of reviewers in October 1994, containing materials from institutions participating in the AHPS grant and from elsewhere. Reviewers provided their suggestions in a March 1995 workshop, and the general release occurred in June of the same year.

The Information Technology program associated with Florida CES was developing tools to deliver Extension publications electronically through the internet, and in October 1996, NIOSH funded a three-year program to update the database and convert the database into HTML format for delivery on the World-Wide Web. By October 1997, the entire database had been converted and a web-site was established. Expansion of the database continued, and CD-ROMs of the content were also produced during 1997(NASD'97), 1998(NASD '98), and 1999(NASD '99). In 2001, NIOSH funded the program to expand and maintain NASD. In 2002, The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (USDA-CREES) added funding support for NASD.

In 2002-2006, NIOSH funded NASD through the Southern Coastal Ag Center (SCAC). Dr. Carol Lehtola directed the project. In 2007-2009, NIOSH funded NASD through the University of Florida – again, Dr. Lehtola directed the project. After a 4-year hiatus, in 2013 NIOSH resumed support for NASD with funding through the Central States Center for Agricultural Safety and Health (CSCASH), the Southeast Center for Agricultural Health and Injury Prevention (SCAHIP), and the High Plains Intermountain Center for Agricultural Health and Safety (HICAHS).&lt;ref name="NASD website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nasdonline.org/about6.html|title=National Ag Safety Database|publisher=National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=29 June 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The NIHR was established in April 2006 as part of the UK government’s health research strategy 'Best Research for Best Health' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568772/dh_4127152_v2.pdf|title=About the NIHR |publisher=[[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] |date=2006-01-25 |accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is funded by the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health and Social Care]]. It has five objectives:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cambridgenetwork.co.uk/news/nihr-cambridge-biomed-research-centre-clinical-trials-day/|title=About the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR): improving the health and wealth of the nation through research |publisher="Cambridge Network"|date=2017-05-15 |accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* to fund high quality research to improve health
* to train and support health researchers
* to provide world-class research facilities
* works with the life sciences industry and charities to benefit all
* involves patients and the public at every step

A 2016 assessment by the independent [[RAND Corporation]] [[think tank]] found that the NIHR had "transformed [[translational research|Research &amp; Development]] in and for the NHS and the patients it serves." &lt;ref name="RAND"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/randeurope/research/projects/nihr-ten-years.html|title=The National Institute of Health Research at Ten Years |publisher=[[RAND Corporation]] |date=2016-05-28 |accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research programmes==
The NIHR’s commissioned research programmes offer a focused source of funding for researchers within the health system in England. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also participate in some of these programmes. The programmes aim to improve patient health and care by providing evidence to inform clinical, social care and public health professionals, NHS managers and where appropriate, policy makers. The goal is to ensure that researchers from all parts of England, and from all areas of healthcare, are able to access appropriate funding to undertake clinical and applied health and social care research, focused on priority areas and topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/documents/3.01-Commissioned-research-programmes.pdf|title=Commissioned Research Programmes |publisher=National Institute of Health Research| accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIHR have an [[Open access|Open Access]] Policy and were one of the original funders of [[Europe PubMed Central]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nihr.ac.uk/funding-and-support/funding-for-research-studies/how-to-apply/support-for-study-teams/publishing-your-research/nihr-open-access-policy.htm|title=NIHR open access policy|website=www.nihr.ac.uk|language=EN|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NIHR programmes include:
* Health Technology Assessment: funds and delivers research information about the effectiveness, costs and broader impact of healthcare treatments and tests for those who plan, provide and receive care in the NHS.
* Efficacy and Mechanism Evaluation: bridges the gap between preclinical studies and evidence of clinical efficacy.

The NIHR has established three national research ‘Schools’ (the School for Primary Care Research, the School for Social Care Research, and the School for Public Health Research). Each national school is a research collaboration between academic centres in England. The three schools aim to:
* Increase and develop the evidence base for practice in the primary care, adult social care, and public health sectors.
* Contribute to ongoing efforts to build research capacity in their respective sectors.
* Improve research awareness in their respective sectors.
* Create a ‘critical mass’ of research expertise and funding through coordinated and collaborative working across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/documents/3.03-Research-Schools.pdf|title=Schools for Primary Care, Social Care and Public Health Research|publisher=National Institute of Health Research| accessdate=2017-05-31}}  [[File:UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg|30px]] This content is available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/  Open Government Licence v3.0]. © Crown copyright.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
The NIHR provides the support and facilities the NHS needs for delivery of research by funding a range of infrastructure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NIHR infrastructure|url=https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/how-we-are-managed/our-structure/infrastructure/|website=www.nihr.ac.uk|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt; including:
* '''Clinical Research Network''': supports clinical research infrastructure throughout England, working towards increased access for patients to new and better treatments in the NHS.
* '''Biomedical Research Centres''': conduct and support translational research to transform scientific breakthroughs into life-saving treatments for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-816-million-investment-in-health-research|title= New £816 million investment in health research |publisher=[[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] |date=2017-09-14 |accessdate=2017-05-31}} [[File:UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg|30px]] This content is available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/  Open Government Licence v3.0]. © Crown copyright.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Patient Safety Translational Research Centres''': conduct and support research to investigate ways to improve the safety, quality and effectiveness of the services that the NHS provides to its patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nihr.ac.uk/news/17-million-invested-in-nihr-patient-safety-translational-research-centres/5481|title=£17 million invested in NIHR Patient Safety Translational Research Centres |publisher=National Institute of Health Research |accessdate=2017-05-31}} [[File:UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg|30px]] This content is available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/  Open Government Licence v3.0]. © Crown copyright.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRC)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collaborations for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care (CLAHRCs)|url=https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/how-we-are-managed/our-structure/infrastructure/collaborations-for-leadership-in-applied-health-research-and-care.htm|website=www.nihr.ac.uk|language=EN}}&lt;/ref&gt;''': the 13 CLAHRCs in England bring together universities and their surrounding NHS organisations including primary care, to conduct applied health research that is transferable across the NHS to provide the highest quality patient care and outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/researchers-get-124m-funding-to-tackle-major-health-challenges| title=Researchers get £124m funding to tackle major health challenges |publisher=[[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] |accessdate=2013-08-09}} [[File:UKOpenGovernmentLicence.svg|30px]] This content is available under the [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/  Open Government Licence v3.0]. © Crown copyright.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty==
The purpose of the NIHR Faculty is to identify and bring together the people who are funded by the NIHR or by the Department of Health’s Policy Research Programme (DH PRP) to support clinical and applied health and social care research. The NIHR Faculty comprises three categories of membership:
* '''Investigators (including Senior Investigators)''':  members who are directly engaged in doing research
* '''Associates''':  members who support research led by others (e.g. Clinical and clinical support staff, scientific, laboratory and technical staff)
* '''Trainees''': the next generation of researchers, many are members on NIHR training schemes
The Faculty encompasses research, clinical and support staff from all professional backgrounds, including doctors, dentists, nurses, allied health professionals and pharmacists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/documents/2.01-NIHR-Faculty.pdf|title=The NIHR Faculty |publisher=National Institute of Health Research| accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current chair for the institute is [[Sallie Lamb]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/med/staff/lamb/|title=Prof Sallie Lamb|website=warwick.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global health research==
The NIHR funds research mainly in England. As a new departure, and in line with the UK Government’s aid strategy of diffusing Official Development Assistance spending across government departments, the Department of Health and Social Care has been allocated money for global health research for the direct benefit of patients and the public in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Using the research funding management experience of the NIHR, the Department will be supporting global health research units and groups comprising universities and research institutions from across the whole of the UK working with LMIC research partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-launches-60-million-call-for-global-health-research|title=Government launches £60 million call for global health research |publisher=[[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]]|date=2016-11-18 |accessdate=2017-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements==
Since its establishment, the NIHR has:
* Delivered benefits to patients. The NIHR is developing innovations that can be delivered throughout the health and social care system, such as more personalised and cost effective dementia care, the first ever implant of a fully synthetic trachea, new treatments for breast cancer and dedicated partnerships to support research in rare disease areas.
* Helped to improve the health of the public nationally and internationally. NIHR-supported public health research is leading to reductions in alcohol-related harm, improving smoking prevention strategies and increasing vaccination coverage for H1N1 and childhood immunisation. Worldwide, more than 1 million people stand to benefit from NIHR-funded research into the off-label use of tranexamic acid to aid clotting during traumatic bleeding.
* Helped to make the nation’s healthcare system more effective, cost-effective and safer. NIHR-funded research into patient safety has informed the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Surgical Safety Checklist, which is significantly reducing post-operative complications. Other research is identifying cost-effective solutions that save money in areas ranging from physical therapy, to dementia, to diabetes.
* Put patients and the public at the heart of research. The NIHR is a world leader in patient and public involvement, and there have been tangible improvements to how research is able to deliver patient benefit. INVOLVE, the NIHR-funded national public involvement centre and advisory group, helps ensure that patients and the public are effectively involved at all stages of research studies, making them more acceptable and meaningful for research users of all ages.
* Enabled and facilitated both research funded by NIHR itself and research funded through charities, industry and other government funders. In 2014/15, from an initial investment of £227.8 million, NIHR research infrastructure leveraged over £918 million in research funding from NIHR’s charity, industry and public research funding partners.
* Supported the training and development of a diverse research workforce in the NHS and academia.  In order to achieve clinical research excellence, research teams must possess technical knowledge and be skilled in working together to overcome difficulties, spark new ideas and inspire other researchers. NIHR is training a highly skilled workforce and developing and retaining the best clinical, health service and public health research professionals. It is also enabling leading clinicians to embark on, and successfully develop, their academic careers while continuing their clinical training. NIHR supports more than 5,000 trainees through a range of NIHR research funding or training awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1574.html|title=The National Institute for Health Research at 10 Years An impact synthesis: 100 Impact Case Studies |publisher=[[RAND Corporation]]|date=2016-05-28 |accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, NIHR commissioned RAND Europe and the Policy Institute at King’s College London to collate and synthesise 100 examples of positive change arising from NIHR’s support of health and care research in its first 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nihr.ac.uk/research-and-impact/nihr-achievements.htm|title=NIHR achievements |publisher=National Institute of Health Research |accessdate=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
NIHR’s work is led by Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Scientific Adviser at the [[Department of Health]], and directed by the Senior Management Team of the Science, Research and Evidence Directorate at the [[Department of Health]]. An Advisory Board and a Strategy Board advise on the strategic direction for NIHR’s work’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/how-we-are-managed/|title=How we are managed |publisher=National Institute of Health Research |accessdate=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delivery of NIHR responsibilities is mainly managed by a number of 'Coordinating Centres' contracted to the [[Department of Health]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/how-we-are-managed/managing-centres/|title=Managing Centres |publisher=National Institute of Health Research |accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Trainees Coordinating Centre''' (TCC) support NIHR objectives to train and develop our Faculty, the next generation of researchers.
* '''Central Commissioning Facility''' (CCF) and ''' NIHR Evaluation, Trials and Studies Coordinating Centre (NETSCC) ''' support NIHR objectives to commission, fund and disseminate research to improve patient care
* '''Clinical Research Network Coordinating Centre''' (CRNCC) support NIHR objectives to provide efficient and effective support for the initiation and delivery of funded research in the NHS.
* '''INVOLVE''' support NIHR objectives for active public involvement in NHS, public health and social care research.
* '''Office for Clinical Research Infrastructure''' (NOCRI) support NIHR objectives to help potential partners, including industry and charities, to navigate the NIHR's centres, facilities and expertise to work in collaboration

==History==
The NIHR was created in April 2006 under the government’s health research strategy, Best Research for Best Health, with the slogan "improving the health and wealth of the nation through research". This strategy outlined the direction that NHS research and development should take in order ‘to improve the health and wealth of the nation through research’. At its core were five strategic goals through which it would transform the research landscape:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/568772/dh_4127152_v2.pdf|title=About the NIHR |publisher=[[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] |date=2006-01-25 |accessdate=2017-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Establish the NHS as an internationally recognised centre of research excellence
* Attract, develop and retain the best research professionals to conduct people-based research
* Commission research focused on improving health and social care
* Manage our knowledge resources
* Act as sound custodians of public money for public good.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="52795">'''Native American reservation inequality''' underlies a range of societal issues that affect the lives of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] populations residing on reservations in the United States. About one third of the Native American population, about 700,000 persons, lives on an [[Indian Reservation]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;Barclay, Eliza. "Navajos Fight Their Food Desert With Junk Food And Soda Taxes." ''NPR''. NPR, 1 Apr. 2015. Web. 8 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reservation poverty]] and other discriminatory factors have led to persisting social inequality on Native American reservations. Disparities between many aspects of life at the national level and at the reservation level, such as quality of education, quality of healthcare, substance abuse, teenage pregnancy, violence, and suicide rates are significant in demonstrating the inequality of opportunities and situations between reservations and the rest of the country.

[[File:Bia-map-indian-reservations-usa.png|thumb|450px|[[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] map of reservations in the continental United States]]

==Historical discrimination==
Many contemporary disparities are rooted in the history of Indian reservations. The reservation system was created following the expansion of the United States into tribal lands throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, during [[United States territorial acquisitions]]. This effort started with the Indian Appropriations Act of 1887,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.docsteach.org/documents/document/indian-appropriations-act|title=Indian Appropriations Act {{!}} DocsTeach|website=www.docsteach.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which created the first reservations as Natives were forced to leave their homelands to make way for white settlers.&lt;ref name="Rez History"&gt;{{cite book|last=McCormick|first=Anita|title=Native Americans and the Reservation in American History|year=1996|publisher=Enslow Publishers|location=Berkeley Heights, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; As forced relocation progressed, many tribes lost aspects of their traditional lifestyles, which centered around community living and hunting and gathering.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=James|title=The Earth Shall Weep: A History of Native America|year=2000|publisher=Grove Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reservations were created on lands that were deemed worthless to white settlers, meaning they were often uncultivatable, resource deficient, and isolated from urban centers and transportation networks.&lt;ref name="Rez History" /&gt; The main result of this reservation system history is [[concentrated poverty]] on the reservations. Regardless of urbanness, areas of concentrated poverty tend to have higher [[crime rates]], underperforming schools, poor housing, poor health conditions, limited private services, and few job opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kneebone|first=Elizabeth|title=The Re-Emergence of Concentrated Poverty: Metropolitan Trends in the 2000s|date=November 2011|publisher=Brookings Institution|location=Washington, DC|url=https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/1103_poverty_kneebone_nadeau_berube.pdf |author2=Carey Nadeau |author3=Alan Berube}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is evidenced on many reservations.

==Education==

The [[Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act]] (ISDEAA) resulted from culminating civil rights movements and calls for increased attention on Native American Affairs. # According to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, (BIA), the act "gave authority to federally recognized tribes to contract with the BIA for the operation of Bureau-funded schools and to determine education programs suitable for their children." &lt;ref name=BIA&gt;"BIA Website." Indian Affairs. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Later federal educational amendments furthered the capabilities of reservation schools and "provided funds directly to tribally operated schools, empowered Indian school boards, permitted local hiring of teachers and staff," and more.&lt;ref name=BIA&gt;"BIA Website." Indian Affairs. N.p., n.d. Web. 20 Oct. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary reservation school situations===
Schools on Native American reservations are disproportionately underachieving compared to other schools. According to a report made to the U.S. Department of Education "only 17% of tribally controlled schools made Annual Yearly Progress under No Child Left Behind during the 2007-2008 school year." &lt;ref name=Gentry&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gentry |first1=M. |last2=Fugate |first2=C. M. |title=Gifted native American students: Underperforming, under-identified, and overlooked |journal=Psychology in the Schools |date=2012 |volume=49 |issue=7 |pages=631–646 |doi=10.1002/pits.21624}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the reasoning for this discrepancy is because of the widespread and disproportionate amount of [[reservation poverty]]. Consequently, "students from low socioeconomic families face unique academic challenges, as their families may lack access to the resources and socialization experiences necessary to adequately prepare and support student achievement in school" &lt;ref name=Gentry /&gt; Furthermore, "the lack of academically successful role models and the need to provide additional financial support to the family contributed to the high number of dropouts among Native American students who live in poverty." &lt;ref name=Gentry /&gt;

Both student and teacher attrition are major issues in reservation schools as well. Censuses have demonstrated the trend in reservation schools that, "despite a growth in population... enrollment in grades 1 through 12 has steadily declined..." &lt;ref name=Gentry /&gt; The High School dropout rate for Native Americans is high, much higher than the national average, and as quoted in a UCLA Civil Rights project report, "Native students "...have a dropout rate twice the national average; the highest dropout rate of any United States ethnic or racial group. About three out of every ten Native students drop out of school before graduating from high school both on reservations and in cities (p.&amp;nbsp;1).""&lt;ref name=faircloth&gt;Faircloth, Susan C., and John W. Tippeconnic III. "The Dropout/Graduation Crisis among American Indian and Alaska Native Students: Failure to Respond Places the Future of Native Peoples at Risk." Civil Rights Project/Proyecto Derechos Civiles (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers are also remarkably and especially difficult to retain at reservation schools, which creates problems with regularity in the classroom and many administrative difficulties as well.&lt;ref name=Cotton&gt;(Cotton, Kathleen. Reducing Teacher Turnover in Reservation Schools: A Guide for Administrators. Portland, Or.: Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory, 1987. Print.)&lt;/ref&gt; There are many reasons for poor teacher retention, mainly problems in "poverty, hunger, ignorance, and disease", as Reyhner's Teaching American Indian Students book argues, that discourage teachers when students are unable or unwilling to perform or even come to school.&lt;ref name=reyhner&gt;Reyhner, Jon, ed. Teaching American Indian students. University of Oklahoma Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the implications of high teacher turnover is the lack of administrative stability it causes. Administrative stability is very important to long-range planning and crucial to the success of the school and its students.&lt;ref name=reyhner&gt;Reyhner, Jon, ed. Teaching American Indian students. University of Oklahoma Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Healthcare==
Healthcare on Native American reservations faces many barriers to success. [[Genetic predisposition]] to many diseases as well as significant lack of government funding, lack of medical resources, and isolation from more populated areas with more medical resources, contribute to healthcare difficulties on reservations.&lt;ref name=Noren&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Noren |first1=J. |last2=Kindig |first2=D. |last3=Sprenger |first3=A. |title=Challenges to Native American health care. |journal=Public Health Reports |date=1998 |volume=113 |issue=1 |pages=22-33 |pmid=9885525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic predisposition===
Native Americans have a biological [[genetic predisposition]] to be especially susceptible to several diseases and ailments. According to a 1997 study, "with the exception of cardiovascular diseases and cancer, the risk of death from most causes are higher among Native Americans than the total US population."&lt;ref name="young"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=T. K. |title=Recent health trends in the Native American population |journal=Population Research and Policy Review |date=1997 |volume=16 |issue=1–2 |pages=147–167 |doi=10.1023/A:1005793131260|jstor=40230136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diabetes mellitus]] is an especially large factor in Native American healthcare. Studies show that "rates of diabetes and its complications…are substantially higher among Native Americans than among the US general population, and the frequency of diabetes among Native Americans is increasing."&lt;ref name=narayan&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Venkat Narayan |first1=K. M. |title=Diabetes mellitus in Native Americans: The problem and its implications |journal=Population Research and Policy Review |date=1997 |volume=16 |issue=1–2 |pages=169–192 |doi=10.1023/A:1005745215330|jstor=40230137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This increase is proposed to be based upon, as the same study states, "several potentially modifiable factors, including obesity, dietary composition, and physical inactivity."&lt;ref name=narayan /&gt; It is estimated that diabetes afflicts 40%-50% of adults in Native American communities,&lt;ref name= yvette&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roubideaux |first1=Y. |title=Perspectives on American Indian Health |journal=American Journal of Public Health |date=2002 |volume=92 |issue=9 |pages=1401–1403 |doi=10.2105/ajph.92.9.1401}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared with the national average of around 8%.&lt;ref name=diabetes&gt;"Diabetes Basics." Diabetes Statistics. N.p., n.d. Web. 06 Nov. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple studies, including one presented in the American Journal of Epidemiology, describe the incidence of diabetes in the [[Pima Indians]] to be 19 times greater than a comparable white majority population.&lt;ref name=pima&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Knowler |first1=W. C. |last2=Bennett |first2=P. H. |last3=Hamman |first3=R.

However, more than genetic predisposition plays a significant role the afflictions of Native American populations. According to the 1997 study, "genetic susceptibility plays a significant role in some diseases, such as diabetes, while for others, the generally lower socioeconomic status, higher prevalence of certain health risk behaviors and lower utilization of preventative services in the Native American population are important determinants."&lt;ref name=young /&gt; Also, before WWII, diabetes in Native American Communities was essentially non-existent.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin 272–277"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=Sue|date=2010|title=Traditions and Diabetes Prevention: A Healthy Path for Native Americans|url=http://spectrum.diabetesjournals.org/content/23/4/272|journal=Diabetes Spectrum|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=272–277|doi=10.2337/diaspect.23.4.272}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the traditional way of life had been taken away from the Native Americans, a domino effect of problems began to arise. During a normal day of hunting, gathering, and normal activities, the pre-reservation Indians expanded approximately 4,000 calories a day, while eating a high fiber, low fat diet.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin 272–277"/&gt; After the reservation system went into effect, Indians were no longer able to hunt or gather food, but expected to farm in a community that at certain places had no water source, or there was no money to buy supplies for a farm in the first place, which led to more poverty.&lt;ref name="Dawes Act {{!}} DocsTeach"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.docsteach.org/documents/document/dawes-act|title=Dawes Act {{!}} DocsTeach|website=www.docsteach.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty led to poor eating habits, which led to diseases such as diabetes mellitis.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin 272–277"/&gt;

After the Indian Removal Act of 1830, subsequent treaties arose such as the Dawes Act of 1887&lt;ref name="Dawes Act {{!}} DocsTeach"/&gt; which broke up reservations into smaller pieces. In 1868, the Federal Government  established the Indian Peace Commission which took thousands of acres of land promised to Indians in previous treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.docsteach.org/documents/document/fort-laramie-treaty|title=Fort Laramie Treaty|last=|first=|date=|website=Docs Teach|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the diminishing of their land, Indians had to deal with diminishing health as well.

===Lack of support===
The lack of [[preventative medicine]] knowledge and resources, specifically, contributes to and exacerbates the medical predispositions of many Native Americans. The lack of research done on, and the lack of attention paid to Native Americans and reservation healthcare is part of the problem. A study done by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality found that "only 42% of measures of health care quality and access tracked in the National Healthcare Disparities Report could be used to assess disparities among American Indians and Alaska Natives." The same source also argued that "data from American Indians and Alaska Natives need to be improved to allow better targeting of interventions to reduce health care disparities and monitoring the success of these activities."&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moy |first1=E. |last2=Smith |first2=C. R. |last3=Johansson |first3=P. |last4=Andrews |first4=R. |title=Gaps in data for American Indians and Alaska Natives in the National Healthcare Disparities Report. |journal=American Indian and Alaska Native Mental Health Research |date=2006 |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=52-69 |pmid=17602397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Health Service===
The [[Indian Health Service]] is a federal program whose purpose is to provide medical service and support to Native Americans. The service covers all members of federally recognized tribes, over 4 million people. While it receives significant federal funds in the billions of dollars, this is still several times less than what it should be, as estimated by tribal leaders.&lt;ref name= yvette /&gt;

Additionally, federal spending cuts have slashed the program down another $800,000 this year with sequestration cuts, further reducing the already under-funded program and further exacerbating the issues of healthcare for Native Americans.&lt;ref name=sequester&gt;Editorial Board (March 20, 2013). "The Sequester Hits the Reservation" (Editorial). The New York Times. Retrieved March 28, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obesity ==
American Indians of all ages and sexes have a generally high prevalence of obesity. Researchers have identified that issue has only come to light in the past few generations and much of it is linked to many individuals having a lack of healthy food options and an increased amount of time spent being sedentary. The overall health of Native Americans is considerably worse than the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schell |first1=L. M. |last2=Gallo |first2=M. V. |title=Overweight and obesity among North American Indian infants, children, and youth |journal=American Journal of Human Biology |date=2012 |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=302–313 |doi=10.1002/ajhb.22257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the early 1950s, the rate of mortality from infectious disease has decreased substantially. But mortality related to behavioral or lifestyle factors has increased, and chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and cancer are among the leading causes of death in adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhu |first1=Y. |last2=Yang |first2=J. |last3=Yeh |first3=F. |last4=Cole |first4=S.

Because the prevalence rates of obesity are higher in American Indians, studies have shown that the population will suffer from greater health complications later on in life as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harvey-Berino |first1=J. |last2=Rourke |first2=J. |title=Obesity Prevention in Preschool Native-American Children: A Pilot Study Using Home Visiting |journal=Obesity Research |date=2003 |volume=11 |issue=5 |pages=606–611 |doi=10.1038/oby.2003.87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===
[[File:Tableau 31 Indians hunting the bison by Karl Bodmer.jpg|thumb|Native Americans hunting bison, a staple of the diet]]
The problem of poor nutrition in Native American communities has a historical narrative. The traditional Native American diet consisted wholly of lean meats, protein, fruits and vegetables and low in fat, non-processed sugars and sodium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cordain |first1=L. |last2=Eaton |first2=S. B. |last3=Sebastian |first3=A. |last4=Mann |first4=N. |last5=Lindeberg |first5=S. |last6=Watkins |first6=B. A. |last7=O’Keefe |first7=J. H. |last8=Brand-Miller |first8=J. |title=Origins and evolution of the Western diet: health implications for the 21st century |journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |date=2005 |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=341–354 |doi=10.1093/ajcn.81.2.341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Native people also hunted and fished quite extensively. This lifestyle persevered until the 1830s through the 1840s, when under the [[Indian Removal Act]], Native American tribes signed treaties with the U.S. government that relocated the entire population to live on secluded land which became known as a reservation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Goetz, Gretchen. "Nutrition a Pressing Concern for American Indians | Food Safety News." ''Food Safety News''. Marler Clark, 04 Mar. 2012. Web. 8 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This relocation also removed the Native people from their usual sources of food and the active lifestyle that hunting and gathering required. The removal created a significant dissonance in the ability to nourish properly. In addition, in 1890, the government placed a ban on Native Americans which prevented them from leaving their lands to fish, hunt or gather in their usual territories. In exchange, they were given government rations of flour, lard and sugar.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These options were much cheaper but contained proportionally lower nutritional value. These foods became the new staple for American Indians as they developed a taste for the only foods available to them by law. Overtime, these foods were introduced to subsequent generations and the food became socialized into the household.

=== Access to food ===
Near many Indian reservations, the access to healthy food can be a big challenge. Areas surrounding many reservations are large food deserts, which are defined as communities without ready access to healthy and affordable food. Food deserts shift the consumer focus of eating healthier food to just merely securing enough food to feed individuals. The geographical isolation of many reservations create logistical and cost challenges, limiting people's ability to access affordable nutritious food because they live far from large grocery stores.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;USDA. "FDPIR." ''United States Department of Agriculture''. N.p., 30 Dec. 2015. Web&lt;/ref&gt; Many reservations also do not have adequate transportation in and out, so that increases the difficulty of being able to go to grocery stores in the area. In some studies, researchers have found that rural residence was positively associated with food insecurity for American Indian households without children. In addition, American Indians had significantly higher levels of food insecurity than the rest of the population, even after controlling for a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. In order to combat the issue of food insecurity in Native American communities, a sub-set of the food stamp program, known as the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations, or FDPIR, was started.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;USDA. "FDPIR." ''United States Department of Agriculture''. N.p., 30 Dec. 2015. Web&lt;/ref&gt; The program provides culturally appropriate food to Native American communities.&lt;ref&gt;Usher, Charles Lynn. "Evaluation of the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR)." (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; The logistical reality of the program is that it is a delivery system. The USDA purchases and ships FDPIR foods to the corresponding state agencies based on their orders from a list of available foods. These administering agencies store and distribute the food, determine applicant eligibility, and provide nutrition education to recipients. USDA provides the administering agencies with funds for program administrative costs. Individuals are eligible for the program if they  'qualify as American Indian or non-Indian households that reside on a reservation.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; You could also quality if you belong to a household in approved areas near a reservation or in Oklahoma that contain at least one person who is a member of a federally-recognized tribe.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Diabetes ===
Diabetes is a prevalent issue in the American Indian and Native American communities. Some of the issues that arise from diabetes are accelerated development of cardiovascular diseases, renal disease, and loss of visual acuity, all of which contribute to excess morbidity and mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lindberg |first1=S. M. |last2=Adams |first2=A. K. |last3=Prince |first3=R. J. |title=Early Predictors of Obesity and Cardiovascular Risk Among American Indian Children |journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal |date=2012 |volume=16 |issue=9 |pages=1879–1886 |doi=10.1007/s10995-012-1024-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akin to obesity, the increasing prevalence has been attributed to lifestyle changes in diet and physical activity. Among youth with Type II diabetes, an estimated 50 to 90 percent have a BMI ≥ 85th percentile for age. The prevalence of obesity among AI youth with Type II diabetes was 79.4 percent. Obesity prevalence was only 12.5 percent among youth with Type I diabetes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gordon|first=Anne|date=January 12, 2012|title=Addressing Child Hunger and Obesity in Indian Country:  Report to Congress|url=|journal=Mathematica|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other risk factors for Type II diabetes include family history and hypertension.The serious complications of diabetes are increasing in frequency among Native Americans. Of major concern are increasing rates of kidney failure, amputations, and blindness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Among people with diabetes, the rate of diabetic end-stage renal disease is six times higher among Native Americans. Diabetes is the most frequent cause of non-traumatic lower limb amputations.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Burrows |first1=N. R. |last2=Geiss |first2=L. S. |last3=Engelgau |first3=M.

Diabetic retinopathy is a term used for all abnormalities of the small blood vessels of the retina caused by diabetes, such as weakening of blood vessel walls or leakage from blood vessels. Diabetic retinopathy occurs in 18 percent of Pima Indians and 24.4 percent of Oklahoma Indians.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Obesity is a particularly important challenge to the health status of Native Americans because of a lack of resources and health interventions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lmic.ihs.gov/default/.../NAHealthChildhoodObesityResear.pdf|title=NIH Supported Native American Health and Childhood Obesity Research|last=|first=|date=2016|website=NIH|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most studies of Native American infants, preschool children, schoolchildren, and adults have confirmed a high prevalence of being overweight. Researchers have hypothesized that there is a genetic component to being overweight as well as a large amount of environmental factors that contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bloomgarden |first1=Z. T. |title=Type 2 Diabetes in the Young: The evolving epidemic |journal=Diabetes Care |date=2004 |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=998–1010 |doi=10.2337/diacare.27.4.998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intervention programs ===
Community-based interventions to modify diet and activity levels to prevent obesity in Native American communities are important steps in addressing obesity in Native American communities at an early age, but many of these programs are either grossly underfunded or do not exist in a capacity in which they are needed. Pilot school-based programs in the Southwestern United States suggest that Native American communities are actively receptive towards interventions within a school setting and that over time there is the potential of having a lower number of children meeting the BMI threshold of being obese.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The cultural diversity of the Native American community along with the geographic diversity of many reservations, makes one specific kind of policy difficult. In ideal circumstances, Native Americans with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] will have their disease under good control and be monitored frequently by a healthcare team knowledgeable in the care of diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Story |first1=M. |last2=Evans |first2=M. |last3=Fabsitz |first3=R. R. |last4=Clay |first4=T. E. |last5=Rock |first5=B.

A team approach to treating and monitoring this disease serves the best interests of the patient. Patient education is critical. People with diabetes can reduce their risk for complications if they are educated about their disease, learn, and practice the skills necessary to better control their blood glucose levels, and receive regular checkups from their healthcare team. People with diabetes, with the help of their healthcare providers, should set goals for better control of blood glucose levels, as close to the normal range as possible for them.

=== Junk-food tax ===
The largest Indian reservation in the United States, the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo nation]], approved a sales tax on junk-food sold within the reservation. The piece of legislation approved increased by 2% the sales tax on food with little to no nutritional value.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/04/08/398310036/the-navajo-nations-tax-on-junk-food-splits-reservation|title=The Navajo Nation's Tax On Junk Food Splits Reservation|last=Morales|first=Laurel|date=April 9, 2015|website=NPR|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax was placed until the year 2020, which the-Navajo nation council. Navajos in favor wanted to pass a bill that could serve as a model for [[Indian country]] to improve the rates of diabetes and obesity among tribal members.&lt;ref name="harvard" /&gt; Proposals targeting sugary drinks with proposed bans, size limits, tax hikes and warning labels haven't gained widespread traction across the country. The effort is really much more in the message of Navajo people making better choices for quality foods.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The obesity rate for some age groups is as high as 60%.&lt;ref name="harvard"&gt;Barclay, Eliza. "Navajos Fight Their Food Desert With Junk Food And Soda Taxes." ''NPR''. NPR, 1 Apr. 2015. Web. 8 Apr. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Diabetes was the fourth-leading cause of death in the Navajo area from 2003 to 2005, the health service said. With a junk-food tax, lawmakers looked to increase support among other neighboring reservations. The pilot project will last until 2020, after which the analysis of obesity and the health of Native Americans living in the Navajo nation will be assessed.&lt;ref name="harvard"/&gt;

==Substance abuse ==

==Teenage pregnancy==
[[Teenage pregnancy]] among the Native American population represents the third highest birth rate in the United States with 59 per 1,000 births in 2007.&lt;ref name=campaign&gt;The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. "[http://www.thenationalcampaign.org/resources/pdf/SS/SS39_NativeAmericans.pdf American Indian/Alaska Native Youth and Teen Pregnancy Prevention]".  (accessed February 20, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2005 and 2007 the birth rate among Native Indian teen girls increased 12%, more than twice the national increase in teenage pregnancy.&lt;ref name=campaign /&gt; Rates of teenage pregnancy however differ by geographic region and tribal affiliation. Teen pregnancy of 15- to 19-year-old women in the [[Navajo Tribe]] have among the highest rates of teenage pregnancy, 15.8% higher than the national average.&lt;ref name=Rochelle&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dalla |first1=R.

===Contraceptive use among Native American teenagers===
Native American populations show some of the lowest documented rates of [[contraceptive]] use in the United States.&lt;ref name=snagbag&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gilley |first1=B. J. |title='Snag bags': Adapting condoms to community values in Native American communities |journal=Culture, Health &amp; Sexuality |date=2006 |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=559–570 |doi=10.1080/13691050600891917}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent health study shows that 65% of males and 57% of females report having sexual intercourse by the 12th grade. Only 40% and 50% respectively report always using contraceptives and more than one third of males and one half of females had sex without contraceptives between the 7th and 9th grade. 7% of females in a study of Native American schools report incidences of pregnancy but rates are skewed due to school drop out rates.&lt;ref name=Among&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edwards |first1=S. |title=Among Native American Teenagers, Sex Without Contraceptives is Common |journal=Family Planning Perspectives |date=1992 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=189-191 |doi=10.2307/2136026}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from the ADD Health Survey conducted on students of [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] schools show that high school students from schools on Native American land are more likely to have had sexual intercourse when compared to the national rates of high school students. In general Native youth are more likely to have sexual intercourse at a younger age compared to their peers and are less likely to have used contraception the last time they had sex compared to their peers.&lt;ref name=campaign /&gt;

The low rates of contraceptive use are sometimes attributed to a historical disinclination of public discussions of sexuality and perceptions of shame associated with sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="snagbag" /&gt; Additionally access to sexual health organizations and family planning centers on Native American reservations remains limited.&lt;ref name=danforth&gt;Danforth, Jessica.

===Consequences of teenage pregnancy in Native youth===
The high concentration of poverty and [[extreme poverty]] on Native American reservations has potentially severe consequences for [[teenage pregnancy|pregnant teenagers]]. These negative consequences include educational deficits, economic strain, poor marital outcomes, as well as slowed cognitive, social, and physical development in children of adolescent parents.&lt;ref name="Rochelle" /&gt; In 2006, 90% of teenage pregnancies among Native teenagers aged 15 to 19 were to unmarried mothers.&lt;ref name="campaign" /&gt; Single parent, female headed households are at higher risk of impoverishment with almost 41% of all single parent female headed households in the United States residing below the national poverty line.&lt;ref name="nwlc"&gt;National Women's Law Center "POVERTY AMONG WOMEN AND FAMILIES, 2000-2010: EXTREME POVERTY REACHES RECORD LEVELS AS CONGRESS FACES CRITICAL CHOICE." Rep. National Women's Law Center, Sept. 2011. Web. 8 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recent rise in teenage pregnancy in Native Teen populations coupled with the already high rates of poverty on Native American Reservations has potentially detrimental consequences for Native families. A Study completed by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] found Native American young mothers on reservations show a tendency to begin prenatal care later than their peers. They were also found to have higher rates of [[substance abuse]] during pregnancy and are more likely to have diabetes during pregnancy.&lt;ref name="usda"&gt;United States Department of Agriculture. "[http://www.fns.usda.gov/ora/MENU/Published/WIC/FILES/CharNativeAmer_Summary.pdf THE CHARACTERISTICS OF NATIVE AMERICAN WIC PARTICIPANTS, ON AND OFF RESERVATIONS]." United States Department of Agriculture Food and Nutrition Service. (accessed February 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans on reservations in particular showed greater rates of participation in public assistance services and their children suffered higher rates of nutritional, dietary, and clinical risks than children not born on the reservation.&lt;ref name="usda" /&gt; Advocates suggest the implementation of policies and programs that will delay sexual initiation and improve contraceptive use among Native teenagers as a possible solution to the rising rates of teen pregnancy.&lt;ref name="usda" /&gt;

==Violence against Native women==
Native American women have the highest rates of violent crime [[victimization]], more than double that of other racial groups.&lt;ref name="revictimizing"&gt;Dreveskracht, Ryan.

(accessed February 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; In the violent acts committed against Native women, Native American women are more likely to have injuries that require medical attention than crimes committed against other races. They are also more likely to face an armed assailant than female victims of violent acts of other races.&lt;ref name="bachman"&gt;Bachman, Ronet, Heather Zaykowski, Rachel Kallmyer, Margarita Poteyeva, and Christina Lanier. U.S. Department of Justice, [https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/223691.pdf "Violence Against American Indian and Alaska Native Women and the Criminal Justice."] Last modified 2008. Accessed March 18, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; On a number of Native American reservations Native Women are murdered at a rate representing ten times the national average. Violent crime rates over all on Native American reservations are 2.5 times the national average while some individual reservations reach 20 times the national average of violent crime.&lt;ref name="bachman" /&gt;

===Historical factors===
Some scholars suggest that historically, physical and sexual violence in Native American communities was rare in Pre-Colonial society. [[Gender roles in First Nations and Native American tribes|Traditional gender roles]] advocated co-dependence, where women's contributions were honored and respected and where violence against Native women was heavily punished by Native justice systems.&lt;ref name="Nevada"&gt;"Violence Against Native Women." Network News. Nevada Network Against Domestic Violence, 2009. Web. 17 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Postcolonial feminism|Colonial and Post-colonial]] changes in Native American society spurred transformations in these traditional perceptions of [[gender role|gender norms]] and Native American societal structure. [[Dawes Act|The General Allotment Act of 1887]] allocated private lands to male heads of household that belied many traditions of maternal land inheritance.&lt;ref name="harper"&gt;Harper, Shelby S., and Christina M. Entrekin. Violence Against Native Women: A Guide for Practitioner Action. Publication. N.p.: n.p., 2006. Violence Against Native Women. Office on Violence Against Women and National Center of Full Faith and Credit, Fall 2006. Web. 8 Feb. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Women also were denied access to farming responsibilities that took away venues for accruing leadership and honor within the community.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt;

The conversion of traditional names to Christian names in the evangelical movement to Christianize Native populations also decreased female gender status. The historical tracing of lineage through maternal lines were changed to follow kinship ties through the father's last name.&lt;ref name="harper"/&gt; These changes in gender norms are suggested to contribute to the high rates of violent crimes against Native American women.

===Sexual assault and Native women===
According to the National Violence Against Women Survey, 34% of American Indian and [[Alaska Natives|Alaskan Native]] women have suffered attempted or completed rape within their lifetimes. This is greater than the 18% of white women, 19% of [[African American]] women and 7% of [[Asian and Pacific Islander]] women that completed the survey. In South Dakota, only 10% of the population is Native American but Native women make up 40% of all sexual assault cases in the state. Similarly, Alaska Natives make up only 15% of the population but represent 61% of victims of reported sexual assault cases.&lt;ref name=williams&gt;Williams, Timothy. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/us/native-americans-struggle-with-high-rate-of-rape.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "For Native American Women, Scourge of Rape, Rare Justice."] ''The New York Times'', May 22, 2012, New York edition. (accessed February 21, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

While nationwide most sexual offences are intra-racial or between members of the same race, the sexual offences against Native American women and Alaskan Native women are more often committed by white offenders.&lt;ref name="bachman" /&gt; 1/3 of sexual offences committed against Native women are intra-racial.&lt;ref name="bachman" /&gt;

===Obstructions to legal action===
Although violent crime and sexual assault rates are high in Native American reservations, prosecution for these crimes is relatively low. In 2007, on the [[Navajo Nation]], of the 329 rape cases reported among a population of 180,000 individuals, only 17 arrests were made in five years. In 2011, of all rape cases reported on Native American reservations the Justice Department only prosecuted 65%.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; Correspondingly, Native American reservations have a high proportion of sex offenders within the population.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt;

The low prosecution rates and rates of arrest result from numerous factors. Native American women have extremely low rates of reporting sexual assault. Some women's advocacy groups in Native American communities suggest that only 10% of all sexual offences are reported.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; Many Native women report feelings of betraying the community by coming forward, especially if the non-Native court systems are involved. Native Women also report a lack of faith in the local law enforcement to make arrests and prosecute offenders.&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt;

Even when sexual assaults are reported to the authorities, prosecution is not certain. According to a study by [[Amnesty International]] in 2006, the local police often either do not respond to a sexual assault case or take hours or days to respond to the victims reports.&lt;ref name="revictimizing" /&gt; Additionally due to the overlapping [[jurisdiction]] of tribal, state, and federal authorities, enforcement of [[restraining order|protection orders]] for victims remains largely unreliable. Tension between these three groups hinders responsiveness and efficiency in the prosecution of sexual offenders and the protection of the victims.&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt;

Tribal authorities also have limited jurisdiction over the prosecution of non-native offenders. 46% of the Native American reservation population are non-natives.&lt;ref name="harper" /&gt; As of 1978, under the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case [[Oliphant v. Suquamish Indian Tribe]], tribal courts are denied inherent jurisdiction to criminally prosecute non-natives.&lt;ref name="findlaw"&gt;"FindLaw | Cases and Codes." FindLaw | Cases and Codes. Thomson Reuters, 2013. Web. 18 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal governments therefore have limited powers of legal processes over a significant portion of the resident population. This has negative impacts due to the high rates of intra-racial sexual assaults against Native American women.

===Re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act ===
The re-authorization of the [[Violence Against Women Act]] (VAWA) spurred controversy among the Native American community in 2012. The act, having expired, lent itself to revisions in the [[United States House of Representatives]] and the [[United States Senate]]. The Senate's re-authorization worked to eliminate some of the limitations on criminal jurisdiction of the tribal courts. In the summer of 2012, the Republican majority in the House of Representatives proffered a separate re-authorization of VAWA. The House re-authorization stripped tribal protections from the jurisdiction of tribal courts.&lt;ref name=revictimizing /&gt; The House's Bill would disallow Indian tribal courts from accusing non-natives on the grounds of domestic violence within reservations.&lt;ref name="pear"&gt;Pear, Robert. [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/us/politics/house-passes-domestic-violence-bill.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1361423461-rbDFX8RfxR6/SWDPbGB5mQ "House Vote Sets Up Battle on Domestic Violence Bill."] ''The New York Times'', May 16, 2012, New York edition, sec. U.S. (accessed February 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

President Obama's White House administration vowed to [[veto]] any re-authorization of VAWA that failed to include the tribal protection clause. On February 28, 2013, President [[Barack Obama]] received the Senate's re-authorization of VAWA after a vote passing the act in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis, Susan. "Congress Sends Violence Against Women Act to Obama." USA Today. Gannett, 28 Feb. 2013. Web. 18 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suicide rates==
{{Main|Suicide among Native Americans in the United States}}
Native American and Alaskan Native populations have disproportionately high rates of [[homicide]] and [[suicide]], particularly among younger populations. Between 1979 -1992, 2,394 individuals who lived in or near a reservation committed suicide. This represents 1.5 times the national average during these 14 years.&lt;ref name="cdc"&gt;Centers for Disease Control. [https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/pub-res/natam.htm "Homicide and Suicide Among Native Americans, 1979-1992."] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (accessed February 21, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1950 the suicide rate among 15- to 24-year-old Native American youths has increased between 200% and 300%. This rate is higher than other racial groups, making Indian youth suicide rates 2 to 3 times the rates nationwide. Suicide rates are greatest especially among Native American males following the general trends of [[gender and suicide]].&lt;ref name="Strickland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strickland |first1=C. J. |title=Suicide Among American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Canadian Aboriginal Youth: Advancing the Research Agenda |journal=International Journal of Mental Health |date=1996–1997 |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=11–32 |doi=10.1080/00207411.1996.11449375}}&lt;/ref&gt;[

Suicide rates vary depending on region and tribal affiliation but rates are particularly high in the [[Southwestern United States]], the northern [[Rocky Mountains]] and [[Plains States|Great Plains]], and in [[Alaska]].&lt;ref name="cdc" /&gt; High suicide rates are often correlated with [[Substance abuse|drug use]], [[American Indian alcoholism|alcoholism]], [[Depression (mood)|depression]], and [[poverty]], widespread in many Native American reservations.&lt;ref name="wisconsin"&gt;[[Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism]]. [http://www.wisconsinwatch.org/2010/11/21/a-tribal-tragedy-state%E2%80%99s-native-peoples-have-alarmingly-high-suicide-rates/ "A Tribal Tragedy: High Native American suicide rates persist."] Wisconsin Watch September 21, 2010, sec. Health and Welfare. (accessed February 20, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that early substance abuse can lead to higher homicide and suicide rates among a population group.

[[Risk factors]] for suicide often include a sense of hopelessness, [[alcohol abuse]], depression, poverty and a triggering conflict or event which can include conflict or loss. Among 77% of males that attempted or completed suicide had incomes of less than 10,000 dollars and 79% were unemployed.&lt;ref name="Strickland" /&gt; Native American youth also report higher rates of exposure to violence and sexual and physical abuse, both correlated to suicide rates.&lt;ref name="Strickland" /&gt; Other possible contributing factors include the mother's age at delivery, family conflict, and financial instability.&lt;ref name=onset/&gt; Additionally 20% of all individuals who attempted or completed suicide had a parent who had also attempted or completed suicide.&lt;ref name="Strickland" /&gt;

Community-based programming has been shown to effectively alleviate some of the risk factors on Native American reservations associated with suicide. These programs have been proven to decrease substance abuse and increase communal connections and support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cheadle |first1=A. |last2=Pearson |first2=D. |last3=Wagner |first3=E. |last4=Psaty |first4=B.

'''Residual ovary syndrome''' or '''ovarian remnant syndrome'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John F. Steege, MD|title=What is ovarian remnant syndrome?|url=http://www.healthywomen.org/content/ask-expert/1761/ovarian-remnant-syndrome|work=HealthyWomen|publisher=National Women's Health Resource Center, Inc.|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a condition that occurs when [[Ovary|ovarian]] tissue is left behind following [[oophorectomy]], causing development of a pelvic mass, [[pelvic pain]], and occasionally [[dyspareunia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Venes | first = Donald | title = Taber's cyclopedic medical dictionary | publisher = F.A. Davis | location = Philadelphia | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780803629790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ovarian remnant syndrome (ORS) is characterized by the presence of residual ovarian tissue after a woman has had [[surgery]] to remove one ovary or both ovaries ([[oophorectomy]]).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Cause ==
The cause of ORS is the unintentional retention of ovarian tissue after the procedure to remove the ovaries. If a woman is receiving hormone replacement therapy, distinguishing from other disease process may be difficult. Other confounding conditions contributing to ORS are thick and profuse pelvic adhesions, inflammation, bleeding after surgery (peri-operative bleeding), and ovaries which are retroperitoneal, can all contribute to the unintentional preservation of ovarian fragments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
If ovarian hormones are present after the ovaries are removed can be a sign that ovarian tissue still remains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Signs and symptoms may include pelvic pain, a pelvic mass, or the absence of [[menopause]] after oophorectomy. Factors may include pelvic [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]] (limiting ability to see the ovary or causing it to adhere to other tissues); [[Human variability|anatomic variations;]] [[bleeding]] during surgery; or [[poor surgical technique.]] Treatment is indicated for people with symptoms and typically involves surgery to remove the residual tissue. [[Therapy]] for those who refuse surgery, cannot have surgery, or do not have a pelvic mass may include hormonal therapy to suppress ovarian function.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7297/ovarian-remnant-syndrome|title=Ovarian remnant syndrome |publisher = Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-19}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women have symptoms consistent with endometriosis, including difficult or [[Dyspareunia|painful intercourse]]; urinary symptoms; or bowel symptoms. It is likely that some women with ORS don't have any symptoms, but the rate of this is unknown.In most cases, symptoms occur within the first five years of the oophorectomy, although there are reports of ORS presenting 20 years after the initial surgery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[Surgical exploration]] and&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of possible ovarian&amp;nbsp;tissue&amp;nbsp;is required for the definitive diagnosis of ORS, and treatment by excision of the remnant ovarian tissue may be performed during the same procedure.&amp;nbsp;For women who are not candidates for surgery, a clinical diagnosis can be made based on the symptoms and&amp;nbsp;levels ([[follicle-stimulating hormone]] and [[estradiol]], after bilateral oophorectomy) and/or&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;findings consistent with the presence of residual ovarian tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Laparoscopy and histological assessment can aid in diagnosis.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rizk|first=B.|last2=Fischer|first2=A.S.|last3=Lotfy|first3=H.A.|last4=Turki|first4=R.|last5=Zahed|first5=H.A.|last6=Malik|first6=R.|last7=Holliday|first7=C.P.|last8=Glass|first8=A.|last9=Fishel|first9=H.|date=2014|title=Recurrence of endometriosis after hysterectomy|journal=Facts, Views &amp; Vision in ObGyn {review)|volume=6|issue=4|pages=219–227|issn=2032-0418|pmc=4286861|pmid=25593697|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
The [[risk]] of ovarian remnant&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(ORS) is increased by incomplete removal of the ovarian&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;at the time of oophorectomy. Surgical factors that contribute to incomplete removal include those that limit surgical exposure of the ovary, or compromise surgical technique. Factors may include:
*&amp;nbsp;adhesions – these can limit visualization of the ovary and may also cause it to adhere to surrounding tissues. Adhesions are often present due to preexisting conditions and/or prior surgeries. In the majority of cases reported since 2007, endometriosis was the most common indication for the initial oophorectomy in patients who subsequently had ORS. Endometriosis increases the risk for functional ovarian tissue being embedded into adjacent structures, making complete excision of tissue challenging.
* Anatomic variations - unusual location of ovarian tissue, for example
* Intraoperative bleeding
* Poor surgical technique – this may include failure to obtain adequate exposure or restore adequate anatomy, or imprecise choice of incision site&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
Ovarian remnant&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(ORS) may first be considered in women who have undergone oophorectomy and have suggestive symptoms, the presence of a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;mass, or evidence of persistent ovarian function (by symptoms or laboratory testing).&amp;nbsp;A history of oophorectomy is required, by definition, to make the diagnosis. Notes regarding the indication for the procedure and the procedure itself should be reviewed and may include prior abdominal or pelvic surgery, [[endometriosis]], and/or poor surgical visualization.&amp;nbsp;If ORS is possible, pelvic&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;should be performed to evaluate for a pelvic mass.[1]

==Treatment==
Treatment for ovarian remnant&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(ORS) is generally indicated for women with suspected ORS who have symptoms (such as&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;pain); have a pelvic mass; or need or desire complete removal of&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;to decrease the risk of ovarian&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(for example, BRCA&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;).&amp;nbsp;The mainstay of treatment is surgery to remove the residual ovarian tissue. Women with ORS with a pelvic mass should have appropriate evaluation for malignancy ([[cancer]]). [[Hormonal therapy (oncology)|Hormonal therapy]] to suppress ovarian function is an alternative treatment for those who refuse surgery, or those who are not candidates for surgery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Medications may be used to treat ORS and include GnRH agonists, danazol, or progesterone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
The incidence of ovarian remnant syndrome is difficult to determine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The available [[data]] are limited to&amp;nbsp;case reports or to retrospective case series. The best available data are from a study describing the frequency and outcome of laparoscopy in women with chronic pelvic pain and/or a pelvic mass who were found to have ovarian remnants. In 119 women who underwent [[hysterectomy]] and oophorectomy by [[laparoscopy]], ovarian remnants were known in 5 and were found during surgery in 21 patients (18%).[2]&amp;nbsp;However, this was a small study and the participants were only symptomatic women. Therefore, it is not known whether the data can be extrapolated to include all women who have undergone oophorectomy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Physical Quality of Life Index''' (PQLI) is an attempt to measure the [[quality of life]] or well-being of a country. The value is the average of three statistics: basic literacy rate, infant mortality, and life expectancy at age one, all equally weighted on a 0 to 100 scale.

It was developed for the [[Overseas Development Council]] in the mid-1970s by Morris David Morris, as one of a number of measures created due to dissatisfaction with the use of [[gross national product|GNP]] as an indicator of development. PQLI might be regarded as an improvement but shares the general problems of measuring quality of life in a quantitative way. It has also been criticized because there is considerable overlap between infant mortality and life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=MD|title=The Physical Quality of Life Index (PQLI).|journal=Development digest|date=1980|volume=18|issue=1|pages=95–109|pmid=12261723}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UN Human Development Index]] is a more widely used means of measuring well-being.

Steps to Calculate Physical Quality of Life:

1) Find percentage of the population that is literate (literacy rate).

2) Find the infant mortality rate. (out of 1000 births)
INDEXED Infant Mortality Rate = (166 - infant mortality) × 0.625

3) Find the Life Expectancy.
INDEXED Life Expectancy = (Life expectancy - 42) × 2.7

4) Physical Quality of Life =

                (Literacy Rate + INDEXED Infant Mortality Rate + INDEXED Life Expectancy)

The '''Ponseti method''' is a manipulative technique that corrects congenital [[clubfoot]] without invasive surgery. It was developed by [[Ignacio Ponseti|Ignacio V. Ponseti]] of the [[ University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics]], USA in the 1950s, and was repopularized in 2000 by John Herzenberg in the USA and Europe and in Africa by NHS surgeon Steve Mannion. It is a standard treatment for [[club foot]].

==Description==
Ponseti treatment was introduced in UK in the late 1990s and widely popularized around the country by NHS physiotherapist Steve Wildon.
The manipulative treatment of [[clubfoot]] deformity is based on the inherent properties of the connective tissue, cartilage, and bone, which respond to the proper mechanical stimuli created by the gradual reduction of the deformity. The ligaments, joint capsules, and tendons are stretched under gentle manipulations. A plaster cast is applied after each manipulation to retain the degree of correction and soften the ligaments. The displaced bones are thus gradually brought into the correct alignment with their joint surfaces progressively remodeled yet maintaining congruency. After two months of manipulation and casting the foot appears slightly over-corrected. After a few weeks in splints however, the foot looks normal.

Proper foot manipulations require a thorough understanding of the anatomy and kinematics of the normal foot and of the deviations of the tarsal bones in the clubfoot. Poorly conducted manipulations will further complicate the clubfoot deformity.

==Steps==

1. The [[calcaneal]] internal rotation (adduction) and [[plantar]] flexion is the key deformity. The foot is adducted and plantar-flexed at the subtalar joint, and the goal is to abduct the foot and dorsiflex it. In order to achieve correction of the clubfoot, the calcaneus should be allowed to rotate freely under the [[talus bone]], which also is free to rotate in the ankle mortise. The correction takes place through the normal arc of the subtalar joint. This is achieved by placing the index finger of the operator on the medial [[malleolus]] to stabilize the leg and levering on the thumb placed on the lateral aspect head of the talus while abducting the forefoot in supination. Forcible attempts at correcting the heel varus by abducting the forefoot while applying counter pressure at the [[calcaneocuboid]] joint prevents the calcaneus from abducting and therefore everting.

2. Foot cavus increases when the forefoot is pronated. If cavus is present, the first step in the manipulation process is to supinate the forefoot by gently lifting the dropped first [[metatarsal]] to correct the cavus. Once the cavus is corrected, the forefoot can be abducted as outlined in step 1.

3. Pronation of the foot also causes the calcaneus to jam under the talus. The calcaneum cannot rotate and stays in varus. The cavus increases as outlined in step 2. This results in a bean-shaped foot. At the end of step 1, the foot is maximally abducted but never pronated.

4. The manipulation is carried out in the cast room, with the baby having been fed just prior to the treatment or even during the treatment. After the foot is manipulated, a long leg cast is applied to hold the correction. Initially, the short leg component is applied. The cast should be snug with minimal but adequate padding. The authors paint or spray the limb with tincture of benzoin to allow adherence of the padding to the limb. The authors prefer to apply additional padding strips along the medial and lateral borders to facilitate safe removal of the cast with a cast saw. The cast must incorporate the toes right up to the tips but not squeeze the toes or obliterate the transverse arch. The cast is molded to contour around the heel while abducting the forefoot against counter pressure on the lateral aspect of the head of the talus. The knee is flexed to 90° for the long leg component of the cast. The parents can soak these casts for 30–45 minutes prior to removal with a plaster knife. The authors' preferred method is to use the oscillating plaster saw for cast removal. The cast is bivalved and removed. The cast then is reconstituted by coapting the two halves. This allows for monitoring of the progress of the forefoot abduction and, in the later stages, the amount of dorsiflexion or equinus correction.

5. Forcible correction of the equinus (and cavus) by dorsiflexion against a tight Achilles tendon results in a spurious correction through a break in the midfoot, resulting in a rocker-bottom foot. The cavus should be separately treated as outlined in step 2, and the equinus should be corrected without causing a midfoot break. It generally takes up to 4–7 casts to achieve maximum foot abduction. The casts are changed weekly. The foot abduction (correction) can be considered adequate when the thigh-foot axis is 60°. After maximal foot abduction is obtained, most cases require a percutaneous Achilles tenotomy. This is performed in the cast room under aseptic conditions. The local area is anesthetized with a combination of a topical lignocaine preparation (e.g. EMLA cream) and minimal local infiltration of lidocaine. The tenotomy is performed through a stab incision with a round tip (#6400) Beaver blade. The wound is closed with a single absorbable suture or with adhesive strips.The final cast is applied with the foot in maximum dorsiflexion, and the foot is held in the cast for 2–3 weeks.

6. Following the manipulation and casting phase, the feet are fitted with open-toed straight-laced shoes attached to a [[Denis Browne bar]]. The affected foot is abducted (externally rotated) to 70° with the unaffected foot set at 45° of abduction. The shoes also have a heel counter bumper to prevent the heel from slipping out of the shoe. The shoes are worn for 23 hours a day for three months and are worn at night and during naps for up to three years.

7. In 10–30% of cases, a tibialis anterior tendon transfer to the lateral cuneiform is performed when the child is approximately three years of age. This gives lasting correction of the forefoot, preventing metatarsus adductus and foot inversion. This procedure is indicated in a child aged 2–2.5 years with dynamic supination of the foot. Prior to surgery, cast the foot in a long leg cast for a few weeks to regain the correction.

'''''Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking''''' is a 2012 non-fiction book written by [[Susan Cain]].  Cain argues that modern [[Western culture]] misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of [[Extraversion and introversion|introverted]] people, leading to "a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness."&lt;ref name="CBSnews20120126"/&gt;

The book presents a history of how Western culture transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality in which an "extrovert ideal" dominates and introversion is viewed as inferior or even pathological. Adopting scientific definitions of introversion and extroversion as preferences for different levels of stimulation, ''Quiet'' outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each temperament, emphasizing the myth of the extrovert ideal that has dominated in the West since the early twentieth century.  Asserting that temperament is a core element of human identity, Cain cites research in biology, psychology, neuroscience and evolution to demonstrate that introversion is both common and normal, noting that many of humankind's most creative individuals and distinguished leaders were introverts.  Cain urges changes at the workplace, in schools, and in parenting; offers advice to introverts for functioning in an extrovert-dominated culture; and offers advice in communication, work, and relationships between people of differing temperament.

== Background ==
Cain graduated from [[Princeton University]]&lt;ref name="TechCrunch20120131"/&gt; and [[Harvard Law School]]&lt;ref name="TimeHealthland20120127"/&gt; and became a lawyer and negotiations consultant.&lt;ref name="Wired20120302"/&gt; Her interest in writing on the subject of introversion reportedly stemmed from her own difficulties with public speaking, which made Harvard Law School "a trial."&lt;ref name="NYTimes20120210"/&gt; She likened her tenure as a Wall Street lawyer to time spent in a foreign country.&lt;ref name="ChiTrib20120220"/&gt; Cain left her careers in corporate law and consulting, for a quieter life of writing at home with her family.&lt;ref name="NYTimes20120210"/&gt;

Seven years in the making,&lt;ref name="Wired20120302"/&gt; Cain's book, ''Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking'' was published January 24, 2012.&lt;ref name="openISBN0307352145"/&gt; Asked what inspired her to write the book, Cain likened introverts today to women at the dawn of the feminist movement—[[second-class citizen]]s with gigantic amounts of untapped talent.&lt;ref name="CBSnews20120126"/&gt; She said that our institutions are designed for extroverts, causing many introverts to believe that something is wrong with them and that they should try to 'pass' as extroverts.&lt;ref name="CBSnews20120126"/&gt;  She concluded that this bias against introversion leads to "a colossal waste of talent, energy, and happiness,"&lt;ref name="CBSnews20120126"/&gt; saying that it is "the next great diversity issue of our time."&lt;ref name=HarvGaz20130930/&gt;

== Content and concepts ==
Cain argues that modern [[Western world|Western]] culture misunderstands and undervalues the traits and capabilities of [[Extraversion and introversion|introverted]] people, employing academic research, supplemented with anecdotes, to describe how American culture got to this point.&lt;ref name="ChiTrib20120220"/&gt;

===The "Extrovert Ideal"===
Cain says [[Western world|Western]], and in particular, American, culture is dominated by what she calls the "Extrovert Ideal," described as "the omnipresent belief that the ideal self is [[wiktionary:gregarious|gregarious]], alpha and comfortable in the spotlight."&lt;ref name="ChiTrib20120220"/&gt; [[Western world|Western]] societies, being based on the Greco-Roman ideal which praises [[public speaking|oratory]],&lt;ref name="CTV20120315"/&gt; favor the man of action over the man of contemplation,&lt;ref name="TED20120228"/&gt; and view introversion as being between a disappointment and pathology.&lt;ref name="Forbes20120126"/&gt;  In contrast, traditional, pre-Americanized Asian culture is more inclined to value reticence and caution.&lt;ref name="ChiTrib20120220"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MgtToday201203328"/&gt;  ''[[The Harvard Independent]]'s'' Faith Zhang remarked that ''Quiet'' seems in part a gentle rebuke to a culture that values style over substance.&lt;ref name="HarvardIndep20120224"/&gt;

===Historical roots===
Cain traces the historical roots of the Extrovert Ideal to the rise of industrial America in the late 19th century, before which a culture of character dominated, and after which "a [[wiktionary:perfect storm|perfect storm]] of big business, urbanization and mass immigration" changed America into what historian Warren Susman called a culture of personality, in which perception trumps truth.&lt;ref name="ChiTrib20120220"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes20120126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarvardIndep20120224"/&gt;  ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'s'' Zosia Bielski described this transformation as being aligned with "the rise of the salesman" and "the move from morals to magnetism"—which Cain says has changed forever “who we are and whom we admire, how we act at job interviews and what we look for in an employee, how we court our mates and raise our children.”&lt;ref name="GlobeMail20120126"/&gt;

===Pitfalls of the Extrovert Ideal===
In general terms, Cain has stated that we can’t be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring each other, and groups follow the most charismatic person, even though there is no correlation between being a good speaker and having great ideas.&lt;ref name="TED20120228"/&gt; Cain says collective thinking approaches not only ''favor'' dominant extroverts,&lt;ref name="Guardian20120322"/&gt; but that relying on [[brainstorming]] is a mistake, arguing that serious original thought and the expertise that generates it are almost always individual.&lt;ref name="MgtToday201203328"/&gt; Cain cites physiological research showing that when people (not just introverts) oppose group consensus, their brains' [[amygdala]]e "light up"—signaling fear of rejection—thus discouraging potentially valuable individual contributions to the group.&lt;ref name="TIME20120202"/&gt; Cain cites research indicating that people are more creative when they enjoy privacy and freedom from interruption,&lt;ref name="NYTimes20120113"/&gt; the implication being that ''enforced'' teamwork can stifle creativity.&lt;ref name="TIME20120202"/&gt; As a concrete example of the risks of groupthink, Cain mentions juries, in which the desire for social cohesion can sometimes short-circuit justice.&lt;ref name="TIME20120202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Justia20120919"/&gt; She suggests that the predominantly extroverted temperament of management in the investment and banking industries—which temperament involves [[dopamine]]-related reward seeking tendencies—may have contributed to the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|2008 banking crisis]].&lt;ref name="MgtToday201203328"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME20120202"/&gt;

[[Image:ExtrovertIntrovertSpectrum.png|300px|thumb|right|'''The introvert-extrovert spectrum''': Cain defines introversion and extroversion in terms of preferences for different levels of stimulation.&lt;ref name="TimeHealthland20120127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SciAm20120124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSthisMorning20120126"/&gt;]]

===Defining introversion===
Various schools of psychology define introversion differently.&lt;ref name="HarvardIndep20120224"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wharton20120404"/&gt; Cain’s definition is that ''introverts have a preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating environment.''&lt;ref name="TimeHealthland20120127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SciAm20120124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSthisMorning20120126"/&gt; Introverts tend to enjoy quiet concentration, listen more than they talk, and think before they speak,&lt;ref name="Forbes20120126"/&gt; and have a more circumspect and cautious approach to risk.&lt;ref name="TimeHealthland20120127"/&gt; Introverts think more, are less reckless and focus on what really matters—relationships and meaningful work.&lt;ref name="WSJ20120208"/&gt; Conversely, extroverts are energized by social situations and tend to be assertive multi-taskers who think out loud and on their feet.&lt;ref name="Forbes20120126"/&gt;  Cain notes that between one-third and one-half of Americans may be classified as introverts,&lt;ref name="Forbes20120126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSthisMorning20120126"/&gt; though individuals fall at different places along an introvert-extrovert ''spectrum.''&lt;ref name="TED20120228"/&gt; People falling near the middle of the spectrum are called “ambiverts.”&lt;ref name="GlobeMail20120126"/&gt;

===Distinguishing introversion===
Cain distinguishes introversion from superficially similar personality traits, in particular charging the perceived identity between shyness and introversion to be a huge misconception.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail20120126"/&gt; She explains that shyness is inherently uncomfortable but introversion is not.&lt;ref name="SciAm20120124"/&gt; Crediting retired developmental psychologist [[Jerome Kagan]], ''Quiet'' recognizes that there is not a single cause for a given behavior; there are many routes to behaviors such as being slow to warm up, shyness, and impulsivity.&lt;ref name="WSJ20120208"/&gt; Cain distinguishes ''[[Extraversion and introversion|introversion]]''—characterized by her as a preference for a quiet, more minimally stimulating environment&lt;ref name="TimeHealthland20120127"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SciAm20120124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBSthisMorning20120126"/&gt;—from being ''[[shyness|shy]]'' (a fear of negative judgment)&lt;ref name="CBSthisMorning20120126"/&gt; and from being ''[[Anti-social behaviour|anti-social]]'' (introverts and extroverts being ''differently'' social),&lt;ref name="NPR20120130"/&gt; and from [[autism]] (inability to read social cues and understand other minds not being characteristic of introverts.)&lt;ref name="TimeHealthland20120127"/&gt;

===Core to our identities===
Cain asserts that whether one is outwardly oriented to the surrounding world, or inwardly oriented to the inner riches of the mind, has as profound an effect as one's gender.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail20120126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Forbes20120130"/&gt; Cain asserted that our lives are shaped as profoundly by personality as by gender or race, that the single most important aspect of personality is where we fall on the introvert-extrovert spectrum, and that one's place on this continuum "influences our choice of friends and mates, how we make conversation, resolve differences, and show love. It affects the careers we choose and whether or not we succeed at them."&lt;ref name="Guardian20120313"/&gt;

===Introverts acting as "pseudo-extroverts"===
According to Cain, in a culture that is biased against them, introverts are pressured to ''act'' like extroverts instead of embracing their serious, often quiet and reflective style.&lt;ref name="Forbes20120130"/&gt;  Cain's research included visits to what she termed three nerve centers of the Extrovert Ideal—a [[Tony Robbins]] self-help seminar, the [[Harvard Business School]], and a [[megachurch]]—noting the discomfort and struggles experienced by introverts in those environments&lt;ref name="WSJ20120208"/&gt; and "shining a light" on the bias against introversion.&lt;ref name="SciAm20120124"/&gt;  She said that people have to act out of our true character sometimes but that it’s not healthy to act out of one's true character most or all of the time:&lt;ref name="Forbes20120130"/&gt; "Whenever you try to pass as something you’re not, you lose a part of yourself along the way. You especially lose a sense of how to spend your time."&lt;ref name="SciAm20120124"/&gt;

However, Cain essentially adopts the "Free Trait Theory" of Dr. Brian Little, agreeing that introverts are capable of acting like extroverts for (core personal goals&lt;ref name="TIME20120202"/&gt;)—work they consider important, people they love, or anything they value highly&lt;ref name="BackRxn20120307"/&gt;—provided they also grant themselves ''restorative niches,'' which are places to go and time to be their real selves.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar20120130"/&gt; Also, in a February 2012 article, Cain listed six self-help strategies introverts may use to nourish their strengths, including "talking deeply," working alone, reading others' works ("a deeply social act"), listening well, taking mini-breaks from overstimulating environments, and practicing "quiet commitment."&lt;ref name="Oprah201202"/&gt;

===Physiology of temperament===
Cain maintains that there are introverts and extroverts in almost every species of the animal kingdom, each having a corresponding survival strategy.&lt;ref name="Wharton20120404"/&gt; She says that research indicates our own degree of introversion or extroversion is detectable in infants and likely to be [[Wiktionary:innate|innate]],&lt;ref name="MgtToday201203328"/&gt; and about 50% [[wiktionary:heritable|heritable]] (half by nature, half by nurture).&lt;ref name="TorontoStar20120130"/&gt; Babies who are more highly [[Jerome Kagan|reactive]] (more [[Highly sensitive person|sensitive]]) to stimulation are more likely to develop into introverts, while less reactive (less sensitive) babies generally become extroverts who actually draw on the energy around them.&lt;ref name="MgtToday201203328"/&gt; Introverts appear to be less responsive than extroverts to [[dopamine]] (a brain chemical linked to [[Reward (psychology)|reward]]-driven learning), and have a more circumspect and cautious approach to risk than do extroverts.&lt;ref name="TimeHealthland20120127"/&gt; Introverts are more governed by the [[neocortex]], the part of the brain responsible for thinking, planning, language and decision making.&lt;ref name="MgtToday201203328"/&gt;

Concerning the workplace, ''Quiet'' critiques today's perceived overemphasis on collaboration: brainstorming leading to [[groupthink]], and meetings leading to organizational inertia.&lt;ref name="WSJ20120208"/&gt; Cain urges changes to the workplace to make it less focused on what she terms "The New [[Groupthink]]"—the idea that creativity and productivity emerge from a necessarily [[wiktionary:gregarious|gregarious]] place—and more conducive to deep thought and solo reflection.&lt;ref name="CBSnews20120126"/&gt;  According to Cain, research shows that charismatic leaders earn bigger paychecks but do not have better corporate performance; that brainstorming results in lower quality ideas and the more vocally assertive extroverts are the most likely to be heard; that the amount of space allotted to each employee has shrunk 60% since the 1970s; and that open office plans are associated with reduced concentration and productivity, impaired memory, higher turnover and increased illness.&lt;ref name="Forbes20120126"/&gt;  Cain says that the more creative people tend to be “socially poised introverts,"&lt;ref name="HarvardIndep20120224"/&gt; solitude is a crucial and underrated ingredient for creativity,&lt;ref name="SciAm20120124"/&gt; and office designs and work plans should allow people to be alone as well as to socialize.&lt;ref name="WSJ20120208"/&gt;

===Personal relationships===
Cain has noted that people of different temperament who become involved in personal relationships—possibly drawn to one another by a sense that each completes the other&lt;ref name="DailyMail20120325"/&gt;—can encounter misunderstanding and conflict.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail20120126"/&gt;  After a day's work an introvert may need to quietly recharge, while the extrovert may find the introvert's withdrawal hurtful; conversely, the extrovert may want to jointly socialize with others, which the introvert may find exhausting.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail20120126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyMail20120325"/&gt;  Cain advises, first, a mutual understanding of where the other party is coming from; and second, balancing their respective needs for socializing and for solitude in a practical compromise in how the couple connects and how the couple jointly socializes with others.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail20120126"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyMail20120325"/&gt;

===Education and child development===
Cain describes how introversion in children is not a defect but instead may involve a careful, sensitive temperament that may bring stronger academics, enhanced creativity and a unique brand of leadership and empathy.  Cain says that introverts win a disproportionate number of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] keys and [[National Merit Scholarship]] finalist positions, cheat and break rules less, are more likely to be described by parents and caregivers as empathetic or conscientious, and are less likely to get into car accidents, participate in extreme sports and place large financial bets.&lt;ref name="Time20120126"/&gt; Cain advises that students need more privacy and autonomy, and should be taught to work together but also how to work alone.&lt;ref name="TED20120228"/&gt; [[Judith Warner]], an author of parenting books, approved of Cain's advice that parents should view introverted children’s social style with understanding rather than fear.&lt;ref name="NYTimes20120210"/&gt;

===Balance===
Cain is not seeking introvert domination but a better balance and inclusion of different work styles, acknowledging that big ideas and great leadership can come from either personality type.&lt;ref name="Forbes20120126"/&gt; Cain cites studies showing that introverts are better at leading proactive employees because they listen to and let them run with their ideas, while extroverts are better at leading passive employees because they have a knack for motivation and inspiration.&lt;ref name="Forbes20120126"/&gt;  Cain has emphasized that the key to maximizing talents is to put yourself into the zone of stimulation that’s right for you.&lt;ref name="TED20120228"/&gt; ''[[The Harvard Independent]]'s'' Faith Zhang closed her review of ''Quiet'' with the observation that Cain’s point is not that introverts are inherently superior or that we should all shroud ourselves in solitude, but that diversity provides balance and makes for a fuller, richer world.&lt;ref name="HarvardIndep20120224"/&gt;

===The future===
Cain asserts that introverts today are where women were in the 1950s and early 1960s—a population discounted for something that went to the core of who they were, but a population on the verge of coming into its own.&lt;ref name="Forbes20120130"/&gt; She adds that we’re at the [[wiktionary:cusp|cusp]] of a real [[wiktionary:sea change|sea change]] in the way we understand this personality type,&lt;ref name="Forbes20120130"/&gt; Cain's own website urging readers to "join the [[Quiet Revolution (company)|''Quiet'' Revolution]]."&lt;ref name="PowerOfIntrovertsCom"/&gt; Beyond urging consciousness-raising about the harmfulness of culture's bias against introversion, Cain urged companies to rethink hiring and promotion policies and office design, and encouraged educators to avoid constant group work and be trained in recognizing varieties of temperament to support quieter children to be functional and achieving for what they are rather than trying to "turn them into extroverts."&lt;ref name="Westword20130211"/&gt; Cain further urged research into determining which situations are best suited to introverts and extroverts and how they can most effectively partner with each other.&lt;ref name="Wharton20120404"/&gt;

Within three weeks of publication, ''[[InformationWeek]]'s'' Debra Donston-Miller had noted that the introversion and extroversion were being widely discussed due in large part to ''Quiet,''&lt;ref name="InfoWk20120209"/&gt; Cain's work being the focus of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's February 6, 2012 [[wiktionary:cover story|cover article]].&lt;ref name="TIME20120202"/&gt; Cain presented talks at the [[TED (conference)|TED2012]] Conference&lt;ref name="TED20120228"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TEDspeakers2012"/&gt; and TED 2014 (All-Stars).&lt;ref name=TEDallstars2014/&gt; In 2015 ''The New York Times''' Laura Holson wrote that Cain had "started, or at least was on the forefront of, a bona fide publishing trend" concerning introverts,&lt;ref name=NYTimes20150725/&gt; and in 2017 ''Harvard Magazine's'' Lydialyle Gibson noted retrospectively that in the aftermath of ''Quiet,'' "introversion came suddenly into vogue."&lt;ref name=Harvard201703/&gt;  Also in 2015, Cain formally co-founded [[Quiet Revolution (company)|Quiet Revolution]], a mission-based company based on the principles in ''Quiet.''&lt;ref name=NYTimes20150725/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harvard201703/&gt;

== Influence ==
Within one week of its publication, ''[[Forbes]]''' Jenna Goudreau noted that the book was featured by several major media outlets and was shared extensively across the Web, Goudreau observing that "readers said they felt [[wiktionary:validation|validated]] and seen for the first time."&lt;ref name="Forbes20120130"/&gt; By 2016, ''Quiet'' had been translated into over forty languages.&lt;ref name=Guardian20160604/&gt;&lt;!-- Number of countries in 2013 had been thirty, per &lt;ref name=DailyMail20130420/&gt; --&gt;

Elaine Aron, Ph.D., author of ''[[The Highly Sensitive Person (book)|The Highly Sensitive Person]]'' (1996), responded to ''Quiet'' and its related ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cover story&lt;ref name="TIME20120202"/&gt; by stating that Cain was in fact describing [[highly sensitive person]]s (HSPs, defined&lt;ref name="JoPaSP1997"/&gt; in terms of sensory processing sensitivity) and not introverts (which Aron says is recently becoming defined&lt;ref name="PsychologyToday20110721"/&gt; more narrowly in terms of ''social'' interaction).&lt;ref name="PsychologyToday20120202"/&gt;  Though Aron wrote that Cain and others blurred the lines between [[highly sensitive person|sensitivity]] and introversion, Aron called the ''Time'' article "a huge, huge step" for understanding HSPs, and that as more is learned, the 30% of [[highly sensitive person|HSPs]] who are social extroverts&lt;ref name="PsychologyToday20110721"/&gt; will be better understood.&lt;ref name="PsychologyToday20120202"/&gt;

Changes caused by ''Quiet'' include universities examining admissions policies to favor introverts, schools setting up clubs for introverted and quiet children, and businesses and office design firms rethinking how space is used in workplaces to benefit both introverts and extroverts, with [[Steelcase]] adjusting office space designs and [[Herman Miller (manufacturer)|Herman Miller]] commissioning an art school to create office furniture to favor privacy and comfort rather than teamwork and sharing.&lt;ref name=DailyMail20130420/&gt; The ''[[ABA Journal]]'' 's Leslie A. Gordon wrote in early 2016 that, "thanks largely to interest generated by Cain’s book," law schools and law firms were using introversion preferences to influence hiring, placement, and training of attorneys.&lt;ref name=ABAjournal20160101/&gt;

Psychologist [[Christopher Peterson (psychologist)|Christopher Peterson]] wrote that even professional [[positive psychology|positive psychologists]] may be implicitly perpetuating "The Extrovert Ideal," for example, by privileging activated feelings like happiness while undervaluing quiet feelings like contentment.&lt;ref name="PsychTodayPeterson20120525"/&gt; Writing that both views of psychological wellness—both the noisy and extroverted view, and a quiet and introverted view—deserve scientific attention, Peterson closed by calling for a "quiet [[positive psychology]]."&lt;ref name="PsychTodayPeterson20120525"/&gt;

''[[GigaOM]]'s'' Jessica Stillman extended the concepts of ''Quiet'' to analyze [[coworking]] (working independently but in the same environment as others), remote working ([[telecommuting]]), and other "workshifting" (non-traditional worksite) arrangements, noting that such arrangements pose both benefits and dangers for introverts.&lt;ref name="GigaOM20120503"/&gt;  While [[coworking|coworkers]] can "set their own level of contact," she also noted that "the ability to work from anywhere might enable more withdrawal than is healthy among introverts."&lt;ref name="GigaOM20120503"/&gt;  She also echoed the cautionary argument that "too often ... we choose our work environment on autopilot."&lt;ref name="GigaOM20120503"/&gt;

As the November 2012 U.S. Presidential election approached, ''Quiet's'' concepts&lt;ref name="NYTimes20120915"/&gt; were applied to contrast former President Clinton with 2012 candidates Obama and Romney.&lt;ref name="Forbes20120917"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyCaller20120914"/&gt; Concerning leadership in general, Cain was quoted as adopting [[Peter Drucker]]'s statement that effective leaders "had little or no ‘[[wiktionary:charisma|charisma]]’ and little use either for the term or what it signifies.”&lt;ref name="Forbes20120917"/&gt; Further, Cain was quoted as rejecting&lt;ref name="DailyCaller20120914"/&gt; [[John Heilemann]]'s assertion that introverts, in particular Barack Obama, “don’t like people,”&lt;ref name="DailyBeast20120910"/&gt; Cain noting that both candidates Obama and Mitt Romney were introverts.&lt;ref name="DailyCaller20120914"/&gt;

[[Cornell Law School]]'s Sherry Colb extended to the jury system ''Quiet's'' assertion that a successful "wisdom-of-crowds phenomenon" typically emerges when individuals in a group share their respective contributions ''after'' being separately and independently conceived.&lt;ref name="Justia20120919"/&gt; Colb proposed a jury system in which, after all evidence has been presented, respective jurors would compose written analyses of the facts and issues, and express a verdict; the jurors' various documents would be distributed and read by all other jurors before in-person deliberation would begin.&lt;ref name="Justia20120919"/&gt;

In the wake of the December 14, 2012 [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook Elementary School (Newtown) shooting]], ''Quiet's'' author was cited for the concern that introverted people, or people who are quiet for other reasons, receive unfair suspicion or stigmatization because of violent acts committed by a few solitary individuals.&lt;ref name="NYTimes20121217"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CBCnews20121218"/&gt; ''Quiet's'' critiques of groupwork and brainstorming were cited in the writings of such sources as [[Harvard Business School]]'s Professor Emeritus James Heskett&lt;ref name="HBS20130102"/&gt; and ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'s Co.Design'' senior editor Belinda Lanks.&lt;ref name="FastCo20130102"/&gt; In the wake of [[Yahoo!|Yahoo! Inc.]]'s February 2013 announcement of discontinuation of a telecommuting option for employees, ''Quiet'' was cited by [[NBC News]]' Isolde Raftery for its concern that creativity would be hindered,&lt;ref name="CNBC20130226"/&gt; and by ''[[The Miami Herald]]'s'' [[Leonard Pitts|Leonard Pitts, Jr.]] against the belief that synergy always produces the best results, and against the one-size-fits-all mentality that says productivity and creativity are found only when colleagues meet at the water cooler.&lt;ref name="MiamiHerald20130309"/&gt;

''Quiet'' was chosen as the common reading choice for Case Western Reserve University's 2013-2014 "[[First Year Experience]]" program which helps new students transition to university life and develop connections, the chair of the university's common reading committee explaining that the book will encourage students to reflect on what kinds of learners and professionals they will be, and how they fit in socially and relate to others.&lt;ref name=HudsonHubTimes20130723/&gt;

Three years after ''Quiet's'' publication, David DiSalvo wrote in ''Forbes'' that a "groundswell support for the book’s thesis" resulted in "a sort of cultish affinity for introversion," but cautioned that "as with all movement-making arguments," they’ve "fueled ... shallow conclusions" that were not made in the book itself.&lt;ref name=Forbes20150210/&gt; DiSalvo cited studies indicating that introverts' elevated sensitivity to personality traits can manifest as bias against extroverts in performance appraisals and reward giving.&lt;ref name=Forbes20150210/&gt;

==Reception==

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'s'' Philip Delves Broughton reviewed ''Quiet'' as "an earnest and enlightening 300-page inquiry into introversion and its uses," described examples of the research and investigations Cain undertook, and closed by stating "Ms. Cain's rich, intelligent book will probably have broad appeal."&lt;ref name="WSJ20120208"/&gt;

''[[The Harvard Independent]]'s'' Faith Zhang remarked that "though it draws on studies across a variety of fields, including psychology, sociology, and neurology, ''Quiet'' is not even a pop science book; it is part affirmation, part social commentary, part self-help primer, supported by but not primarily focused on science."&lt;ref name="HarvardIndep20120224"/&gt; Zhang found flaw in generalizations in ''Quiet's'' "Soft Power" chapter on East Asian culture, but found the book's most interesting chapter to be the one tracing the social history describing the shift from the “culture of character” to the “culture of personality.”&lt;ref name="HarvardIndep20120224"/&gt; Zhang concluded that "''Quiet'' has much to offer both introverts and the extroverts who would like to understand them."&lt;ref name="HarvardIndep20120224"/&gt;  Jenny Lee subsequently wrote in the Asian American magazine ''[[Hyphen (magazine)|Hyphen]]'' that Zhang's brief critique of ''Quiet's'' "Soft Power" chapter was the exception among reviews; Lee further asserted that despite its disclaimer about not encouraging ethno-cultural stereotypes, Cain's chapter overgeneralized about Asian and Asian American personality styles and reinforced the "model minority myth."&lt;ref name="Hyphen20130221"/&gt;

In ''[[Scientific American]],'' [[Gareth Cook]] described ''Quiet'' as "part book, part [[manifesto]]."&lt;ref name="SciAm20120124"/&gt;

The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' said that "''Quiet'' is not a scientific tract. But Cain ... draws from a wide array of academic research, enlivened with colorful anecdotes, to describe how American culture got to this point."&lt;ref name="ChiTrib20120220"/&gt;

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]],'' [[Judith Warner]] gave ''Quiet'' a mixed review,&lt;ref name="NYTimes20120210"/&gt; to which Cain blogged a response the same day.&lt;ref name="CainRebuttalNYT20120210"/&gt; Concerning ''Quiet's'' writing ''form,'' Warner commented that ''Quiet'' is "a long and ploddingly earnest book," and contains "go-go language" and "gratuitous sloganeering ... (that) offsets Cain’s serious research rather badly."&lt;ref name="NYTimes20120210"/&gt; Warner also stated that Cain "combines on-the-scenes reporting with a wide range of social science research and a fair bit of 'quiet power' cheerleading."&lt;ref name="NYTimes20120210"/&gt; Cain's response replied to Warner's critique of the book's ''content:'' Warner asserted that ''Quiet's'' definition of introversion expanded to include "all that is wise and good, (so) that (the definition) is largely meaningless except as yet another vehicle for promoting self-esteem";&lt;ref name="NYTimes20120210"/&gt; Cain replied that "Warner badly misunderstands" that the traits listed in ''Quiet's'' "Author's Note" were not descriptive of introversion "but that culturally these traits have always been bound together under the 'contemplation' rubric, and need to be addressed as such."&lt;ref name="CainRebuttalNYT20120210"/&gt; Warner hypothesized that, had Cain focused in "other sorts of places" than "Harvard Business School, corporate boardrooms, executive suites," that Cain "would undoubtedly have discovered a world of introverts quite contented with who they are";&lt;ref name="NYTimes20120210"/&gt; Cain replied that her research and feedback confirm introverts' "difficult experiences" even in fields that "Warner imagines are safe havens for introverts," Cain adding that Warner's response to ''Quiet'' "has an interesting precedent in the early years of [[feminism]]... (in which) a distinct minority felt proud and content as they were, and couldn’t see what all the fuss was about."&lt;ref name="CainRebuttalNYT20120210"/&gt;

Philosopher and author [[Damon Young]], writing in ''[[The Age]],'' wrote that "Cain is patient, meticulous and empathetic on the psychology. She outlines the problems clearly and gives workable solutions. She is less nimble with questions of history and society. For example, her use of a handful of quotes and [[wiktionary:aphorism|aphorisms]] to demonstrate Eastern and Western outlooks on speech is clumsy. Her prose is plain but warm and she distils research well, with the use of anecdotes and literary examples."&lt;ref name="TheAge20120505"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34160">In the United States, [[prison]]s are obligated to provide [[health care]] to [[prisoner]]s. Such health care is sometimes called ''[[correctional medicine]]''. In women's prisons, correctional medicine includes attention to [[reproductive health]].

The number of [[Incarceration of women in the United States|women incarcerated in the United States]] has increased greatly over the last few decades,{{specify|date=June 2016}} and at a faster rate than the number of incarcerated men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Many of the same factors that increase women's likelihood of incarceration also put them at a higher risk for contracting [[HIV/AIDS]] and other [[sexually transmitted infection]]s, and for having [[High-risk pregnancy|high-risk pregnancies]].&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Braithewaite|first=Ronald L.|last2=Treadwell|first2=Henrie M.|last3=Arriola|first3=Kimberly R J|date=2005|title=Health disparities and incarcerated women: a population ignored|pmc=1449417|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=95|issue=10|pages=1679–1681|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.065375|pmid=16186446}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The majority of incarcerated women are economically disadvantaged and poorly educated,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeve|first=M Katherine|date=1999|title=Adjudicated Health: Incarcerated Women and the Social Constructions of Health|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1008376229520|journal=Crime, Law and Social Change|volume=31|pages=49|doi=10.1023/A:1008376229520|pmid=|access-date=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have not had adequate access to [[preventive healthcare]] prior to their imprisonment,&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; such as [[Pap test]]s, [[STI test|STI screening]], and pregnancy counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Jennifer G.|last2=Hebert|first2=Megan R.|last3=Rosengard|first3=Cynthia|last4=Rose|first4=Jennifer S.|last5=DaSilva|first5=Kristen M.|last6=Stein|first6=Michael D.|date=2006|title=Reproductive Health Care and Family Flanning Feeds Among Incarcerated Women|pmc=1470599|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=96|issue=5|pages=834–839|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.060236|pmid=16571701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal standards for health care availability ==
=== Historical precedence ===

==== Estelle v. Gamble (1976) ====
[[Estelle v. Gamble]] obligates prisons to provide for the serious medical needs of their inmates.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8YdHAAAAMAAJ|title=The Incarcerated Woman: Rehabilitative Programming in Women's Prisons|last=Anderson|first=Tammy L.|date=2003|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780130940674|editor-last=Sharp|editor-first=Susan F.|pages=49–60|language=en|chapter=Issues in the availability of health care for women prisoners|editor-last2=Muraskin|editor-first2=Roslyn}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it also requires that an incarcerated person must demonstrate that they had a serious medical need, and that they didn't receive adequate medical care because officials showed "deliberate indifference."  Due to the difficulty inherent in proving that a prison official knew about a medical condition, yet failed to respond to it, this standard makes it difficult to hold correctional facilities accountable for their mistakes.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ekaWZJHfqMC|title=Our Bodies, Our Crimes: The Policing of Women’s Reproduction in America|last=Flavin|first=Jeanne|date=2008|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814727553|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Todaro v. Ward (1977) ====
Todaro v. Ward argued that women within a New York prison did not have adequate, constitutional access to healthcare.  Since Todaro v. Ward was the first major court case that called into question incarcerated women's actual access to health care, it spurred organizations such as the American Medical Association, American Correctional Association, and the American Public Health Association to start creating standards for health care within prisons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Brown v. Beck (1980) ====
With this ruling, the court determined that the medical care provided to prisoners must only be "reasonable,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; not necessarily "perfect, the best obtainable, or even very good."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Relevant federal legislation and standards ===
Currently, no national agency monitors the treatment of prisoners, although a few governmental and non-governmental agencies do provide monitoring standards that facilities may use if they wish to become accredited (about thirty percent of prisons are accredited), and some federal legislation has been passed regarding correctional health care.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Federal Prisoner Co-Payment Act (1999) ====
This legislation required that incarcerated individuals pay for some of their health care bill while in prison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Prison Litigation Reform Act (1996) ====
The [[Prison Litigation Reform Act]] made it much more difficult for prisoners to file class action and individual lawsuits against a prison.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barry|first=Ellen M|date=2001|title=Bad Medicine: Health Care Inadequacies in Women's Prisons|url=http://uu5bm5kq6z.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Bad+medicine%3A+Health+care+inadequacies+in+women%27s+prisons&amp;rft.jtitle=Criminal+Justice&amp;rft.au=Ellen+M+Barry&amp;rft.date=2001-04-01&amp;rft.pub=American+Bar+Association&amp;rft.issn=0887-7785&amp;rft.volume=16&amp;rft.issue=1&amp;rft.spage=38&amp;rft.externalDocID=73033132&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=Criminal Justice|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PRLA) requires that prisoners exhaust a facility's own administrative resources and solutions before attempting to file a lawsuit.  This can be detrimental because prisoners' health problems are often time-sensitive.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth|first=Rachel|date=2004|title=Searching for the State: Who Governs Prisoners' Reproductive Rights?|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/173809|journal=Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State and Society|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PRLA also includes a cap on attorney fees, which has made fewer attorneys willing to represent prisoners.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Although PRLA applies to all lawsuits filed by incarcerated people, it is particularly relevant for women's health because most lawsuits filed by incarcerated women concern substandard health care.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Correctional reproductive health care ==

=== Pregnancy and prenatal care ===
As of 2005, about five to ten percent of incarcerated women were pregnant (most upon intake), and about 2,000 incarcerated women give birth every year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Incarcerated women already tend to have more high-risk pregnancies, due to possible complications by drug and alcohol abuse and STIs, histories of victimization and abuse, and poor support networks, so they are particularly in need of quality [[prenatal care]] as compared to non-incarcerated women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Acoca|first=Leslie|date=January 1998|title=Defusing the Time Bomb: Understanding and Meeting the Growing Health Care Needs of Incarcerated Women in America|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=EAIM&amp;u=mnalmgl&amp;id=GALE&amp;#124;A20517103&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;sid=summon&amp;userGroup=mnalmgl&amp;authCount=1|journal=Crime and Delinquency|doi=|pmid=|access-date=April 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have found mixed results when it comes to the effects of incarceration on pregnancy outcomes. Some studies have found that incarceration correlates to lower [[birth weight]], and an increased chance of [[Complications of pregnancy|complications in the pregnancy]]; others have found the opposite: that incarceration is associated with higher birth weight and a decreased likelihood of [[Preterm birth|premature delivery]]. However, the latter finding may simply speak to the low level of medical care available to women in poverty in the free world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 1996 study conducted by the [[National Council on Crime and Delinquency]] (NCCD) on women in California, Connecticut, and Florida state prisons found a lack of adequate prenatal and postnatal medical care, [[prenatal nutrition]], level of [[methadone maintenance]] for opiate-dependent pregnant inmates, education regarding childbirth and parenting, and preparation for the mother's separation from her child.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Often, inmates report receiving no regular pelvic exams or sonograms, and little to no information about proper prenatal care and nutrition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Prison diets often lack proper nutrition, particularly for the changing and special dietary needs of pregnant women, and many women prisoners report not being allowed to alter their diets during their pregnancy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Despite the lack or low quality of prenatal care in most institutions, many correctional facilities have made strides to provide adequate care.  For example, Washington State has a program called the Birth Attendants Prison Doula project, which provides support to incarcerated pregnant and [[Postpartum period|postpartum]] women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When asked about her prison's response to pregnancy, Boo, an inmate in an Arizona correctional facility, said:

{{quote|text=They're real good people to me... I get taken care of in here very well. They give us three pregnancy bags a day which contain two cartons of milk, two orange juices, and two fruits, and you get three pills three times a day during breakfast, lunch, and dinner.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;}}

In general, pregnant inmates are transported to outside medical facilities to give birth, because most correctional facilities are not medically equipped to provide such services.  These transports often result in complications due to the risk of injury to both the mother and the child, and due to the additional stress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The practice of [[shackling]] inmates, both in transit to the hospital and during [[Childbirth|labor]], is also common at many facilities.  Forty-one states permit the use of restraints during transport to the hospital, and twenty-three states and the federal government permit the use of restraints during labor.  These restraints may include [[Belly chain (restraint)|belly chains]], shackles, handcuffs, or nylon "soft restraints."  The use of restraints on women so far into their pregnancy and during labor poses many health risks.  Restraints inhibit the movement of a woman, something that aids the progression of the labor and alleviates some of her discomfort.  They may also hinder the ability of health care professionals to respond quickly to emergencies during the labor.  Organizations such as [[Amnesty International]] have pressured correctional facilities to stop the use of shackles on pregnant women, pointing out the fact that most pregnant women are incarcerated for nonviolent offenses and pose no risk (especially during childbirth), so the restraints are unnecessary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Maria Jones, a pregnant inmate, described her experience being shackled during labor:

{{quote|text=Because I was shackled to the bed, they couldn't remove the lower part of the bed for the delivery, and they couldn't put my feet in the stirrups. My feet were still shackled together, and I couldn't get my legs apart. The doctor called for the [[Prison officer|officer]], but the officer had gone down the hall.

Incarcerated women are 15 times more likely to be infected with [[HIV]] than are women who are free,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and are also more than twice as likely than incarcerated men to be infected with HIV.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weatherhead|first=Kendra|date=2003|title=Cruel but not Unusual Punishment: The Failure to Provide Adequate Medical Treatment to Female Prisoners in the United States|url=http://uu5bm5kq6z.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Cruel+but+not+Unusual+Punishment%3A+The+Failure+to+Provide+Adequate+Medical+Treatment+to+Female+Prisoners+in+the+United+States&amp;rft.jtitle=Health+Matrix%3A+Journal+of+Law-Medicine&amp;rft.au=Kendra+Weatherhead&amp;rft.date=2003-07-01&amp;rft.pub=Case+Western+Reserve+University+Health+Matrix%3A+Journal+of+Law-Medicine&amp;rft.volume=13&amp;rft.spage=429&amp;rft.epage=429&amp;rft.externalDocID=13_Health_Matrix_429_srctype_smi_srcid_3B15_key_8f97eab4a9b73e1350b316e5e67dcf23|journal=Health Matrix: Journal of Law-Medicine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandler|first=Cynthia|date=2003|title=Death and Dying in America: The Prison Industrial Complex's Impact on Women's Health|url=http://uu5bm5kq6z.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Death+and+Dying+in+America%3A+The+Prison+Industrial+Complex%27s+Impact+on+Women%27s+Health&amp;rft.jtitle=Berkeley+Women%27s+Law+Journal&amp;rft.au=Cynthia+Chandler&amp;rft.date=2003-01-01&amp;rft.pub=The+Regents+of+the+University+of+California+on+behalf+of&amp;rft.volume=18&amp;rft.spage=40&amp;rft.epage=304&amp;rft.externalDocID=18_Berkeley_Women_s_L_J_40_srctype_smi_srcid_3B15_key_8549afa72665cf5fdaf04f403446adfb&amp;paramdict=en-US|journal=Berkeley Women's Law Journal|doi=|pmid=|access-date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in New York, a state which does [[blind testing]], 14.6% of incarcerated women and 7.3% of incarcerated men tested positive for HIV.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Public Health Behind Bars: From Prisons to Communities|last=Balis|first=Andrea F.|publisher=Springer New York|year=2007|isbn=|editor-last=Greifinger|editor-first=Robert B.|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=320–332|chapter=Female Prisoners and the Case for Gender-Specific Reentry Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1996 NCCD study found that female African American and Hispanic/Latina inmates were significantly more likely than their White counterparts to report testing positive for HIV.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Many of the same social factors that increase the likelihood of incarceration for women, such as poverty, race, gender, and a history of victimization, are also correlated to HIV infection.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2000 study by the [[American Correctional Association]] found that mandatory HIV testing is conducted upon intake in 23 states, and that a few also provide 6-month follow-up testing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Most prisons test inmates who either ask to be tested, or display symptoms of HIV (this is the policy in 44 out of 51 jurisdictions), and fifteen states also specifically test inmates that are in high-risk groups.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Three states, the District of Columbia, and the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] test inmates upon release.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The same American Correctional Association study also found that most prisons provide HIV-positive individuals with medications while they are in the prison, may provide them with a small supply after they are released, and may also direct them towards community resources where they can receive more medication.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Treatment of inmates who have tested positive for HIV varies greatly from state to state.  For example, in New Jersey, female HIV positive prisoners were shackled to their beds for up to six months after being diagnosed.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  However, Ohio and New York, among other states, have infirmaries specifically adapted to attend to the needs of inmates with HIV/AIDS, and allow some inmates to reside in a hospital for treatment.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  In addition to this, New York State's Division of Health Services department does regular evaluations of the state prisons' services for AIDS patients, and also provides space for support groups to meet, and patients to be counseled on their illness.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Women's symptoms and treatment needs for HIV infection are quite different from those of men, but the treatment resources for incarcerated women are often limited.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The treatment of HIV requires a specialist, and generally, prison doctors don't have adequate training to treat women effectively.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Or, prisons often do not have adequate facilities, staff, or a follow-up treatment system.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  For example, the 1996 NCCD study also found that within the entire California women's prison system, one of the largest in the nation, there was only one full-time specialist able to provide "gender-specific treatment" to women with HIV.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Male prisoners, however, did have access to gender-specific HIV treatment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Abortion ===
Federal courts have established, according to constitutional law, that prisoners retain the right to have an abortion once they are incarcerated.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  However, state standards regarding abortion for incarcerated women are unclear - actions are often left up to the discretion of prison officials on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Most state abortion policies are written and approved without going through the administrative process which other policies are generally subject to; thus, they are frequently incomplete.  In fact, fourteen state [[Department of Corrections|DOCs]] have no official written abortion policies, and others simply will not release or publish their policies.  Alaska has a provision which bans abortion funding in its policy on general medical services, but no specific policy guidelines on abortion.  Other states may not define the exact type of abortions they pay for.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Most states require that women pay for all of the costs of an abortion procedure, including transportation to the clinic (which is often far due to prisons' rural locations, and the urban locations of most abortion clinics), security, and the actual surgery. Minnesota and Wisconsin are the only two states which explicitly mention in their policies that they pay for abortions if a woman has been raped.  The policy of the Federal Bureau of Prisons since 1987 has been to pay for abortion only in the cases of rape or life endangerment (although they do pay for transportation to the clinic).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women's experiences and perceptions of their own access to abortion reflect these policies. In a nationwide survey of correctional health care and inmates' access to abortion, 68% of respondents said that women within their prison were allowed to have an abortion if they requested one.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sufrin|first=Carolyn B.|date=2009|title=Incarcerated Women and Abortion Provision: A Survey of Correctional Health Providers|jstor=20462705|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|doi=10.1363/4100609|pmid=|volume=41|pages=6–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many respondents also stated that although their prison did allow access to abortion, women receive little to no help with arranging an appointment, paying for the procedure, and getting themselves to the clinic.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Other reproductive health care ===

==== Cancer and general gynecological care ====
According to the U.S. Department of Justice [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], [[cancer]] is one of the leading causes of death for women (both inside and outside prison), and one-quarter of deaths of incarcerated women due to cancer are from [[Breast cancer|breast]], [[Cervical cancer|cervical]], [[Ovarian cancer|ovarian]], and [[uterine cancer]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In particular, women in prison are at a high risk for contracting cervical cancer due to their high rates of substance abuse and diseases such as [[hepatitis C]], HIV, and other STIs.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magee|first=Catherine G.|last2=Hult|first2=Jen R.|last3=Turalba|first3=Ruby|last4=McMillan|first4=Shelby|date=2005|title=Preventive Care for Women in Prison: A Qualitative Community Health Assessment of the Papanicolaou Test and Follow-Up Treatment at a California State Women's Prison|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/215091831?pq-origsite=summon|journal=American Journal of Public Health|doi=10.2105/ajph.2005.063677|pmid=|access-date=May 31, 2016|pmc=1449425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; However, reproductive health care reform in prisons generally focuses on pregnancy or HIV.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Incarcerated women have higher rates of STIs and gynecologic infections than non-incarcerated women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In fact, one study estimated that about 9% of incarcerated women tested positive for [[gonococcus]] infection, and between 11 and 17% of incarcerated women are infected with [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  However, not every infected woman will be diagnosed and given treatment, because many prisons only test women who request to be tested, or show symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

States often have their own legislation regarding correctional health care, but it doesn't always completely take into consideration the complexities of women's reproductive health.  For example, the [[New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision]] (DOCCS) has issued two main documents which outline their institutional health care policies: the Health Services Policy Manual, and the Women's Health Primary Care Practice Guideline (first published in 2000, and updated in 2008 and 2011).  Within these documents, the Patient Bill of Rights includes the right of a patient to respectful care, the right to refuse treatment, and the right to complete information regarding a diagnosis; the Professional Code of Ethics outlines the standards that staff must follow, including having a respect for [[human dignity]], and a [[Doctor–patient relationship|professional relationship with the patient]].  The DOCCS does not monitor how well facilities actually adhere to these standards, and there are no consequences for those who do not.  Also, many women are not informed of their patient's rights, so are unaware when standards have been breached.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraft-Stolar|first=Tamar|date=2015|title=Reproductive Injustice: The State of Reproductive Health Care for Women in New York State Prisons|url=http://www.correctionalassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Reproductive-Injustice-FULL-REPORT-FINAL-2-11-15.pdf|journal=Women in Prison Project of the Correctional Association of New York|doi=|pmid=|access-date=April 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DOCCS has no written policies on [[pregnancy test]]s, [[pregnancy options counseling]], [[abortion]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], [[miscarriage]], [[stillbirth]], nutrition for pregnant and nursing women, or [[Hysterectomy|hysterectomies]], and has incomplete policies regarding [[menopause]], vitamins, health care for pregnant women, women in labor, or women who have recently given birth.  The DOCCS policies stray from community standards in the areas of the starting age for yearly GYN check-ups, the frequency of breast exams and [[Pap smear]]s, follow-up for abnormal Pap smears, frequency of prenatal visits and [[Obstetric ultrasonography|ultrasounds]], and the time frame for postpartum check-ups for women who have a [[Caesarean section]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The Federal Bureau of Prisons' policy is to provide each inmate with a complete [[medical exam]] (which includes [[gynecological]] and [[obstetrical]] history) within 30 days of admission.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The BOP currently{{specify|date=June 2016}} adheres to the standards for yearly exams put forth by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  According to a 1997 survey, approximately 90 percent of the inmates in women's state prisons reported having received a gynecologic exam from their institution upon intake.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Additionally, an American Correctional Association study found that  most women's correctional institutions provided [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|OB/GYN]] services, [[Prenatal care|prenatal]] and postpartum care, [[mammography]], and Pap smears upon request.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Fewer provided counseling for inmates regarding their reproductive health,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; many correctional facilities do not provide follow-up exams, and screenings often do not continue on the recommended schedule.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a New York city juvenile detention facility, the 5,000 youth who went through the system annually were all served by a single physician.  Less than one-third of the inmates received a Pap smear test, and one in five were tested for [[gonorrhea]], chlamydia, and [[syphilis]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Women often report long delays and wait times in signing up for appointments with a GYN doctor, and in getting treated.   For example, more than half of respondents in a survey of incarcerated women in New York state prisons said that they were not able to see the GYN when necessary, and 47% of respondents stated that their problems became worse in the time that they had to wait.  In one extreme case, Sara, a woman incarcerated in New York, had to wait seven months before she was finally diagnosed with an aggressive cancer.  Another woman had to wait four months to receive a colposcopy, a follow-up to her Pap test.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Another woman at the same prison wrote:

{{quote|I’ve never seen the GYN. I dropped a tab [note to the doctor] explaining to them about being diagnosed with abnormal cells. . . and how I’d like to get a check-up, but no one answered. This was six months ago.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;}}

In a [[qualitative study]] on the experiences of incarcerated women with the [[Pap test|Papanicolaou test]] (a test which screens for cervical cancer) in California state prisons, researchers found a lack of communication between medical providers within the prison, which tended to result in long delays or cancellations of treatment, no standardized process for scheduling a Pap test, and a lack of education and explanation regarding both the test itself, and how to fill out the medical forms associated with it.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In addition to this, women who aren't called in for a Pap test are sometimes required to pay a $5 fee if they request one.  This can be a significant barrier to requesting a test, considering an average prisoner's wage is around 7 to 13 cents per hour.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

In the same study, women brought attention to the discomfort suffered by inmates with personal histories of sexual abuse and victimization when they were forced to be examined by a male physician.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Women interviewed in New York State prisons had similar complaints about their physicians' seeming lack of awareness of female prisoners' past traumas, and the lack of explanation of the procedures.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; One woman stated:

{{quote|text=Ninety-nine percent of the women have been abused or raped.  To have a man take us into an office the size of a closet... stripped down... [it's] rough and hurts us... it takes us right back to the beginning."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;}}

==== Perceptions of Medical Care ====
Another consideration in correctional reproductive health care is the relationship between the prisoner-patients and the physicians. Studies have shown that female inmates often report distrust of physicians and disappointment with their interactions with providers.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Researchers have found that most of the women interviewed in the 2005 California state prison study had negative perceptions of their gynecologic tests and treatment.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to the women interviewed, the prison doctors who performed their tests were often unprofessional and disrespectful.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  One woman described her experience, saying: "They expect us to give them respect, but they don't respect us. They treat us like we are animals just because we are incarcerated."&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The [[Prisons in California|California prison system]] employs [[corrections officer]]s who are also trained to be licensed nurses (called medical technical assistants).  Similarly, in Chicago, the county jails train corrections officers as [[doula]]s and [[birth attendant]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Inmates generally must request medical treatment through either these officers, or through other, non-medically trained correctional staff, and studies have shown that female patients' complaints and requests for medical assistance are often not taken as seriously as those of male patients.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The simultaneous positions that these officers hold as both security personnel and medical caretakers or advocates may contribute to female inmates' distrust of them.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A 1999 study found that female inmates were more likely than their male counterparts to think that their access to health care was inadequate and that their quality of care was low compared to the care male prisoners were given.  Women in this study also visited the health care facility more often than their male counterparts and reported being healthy less often than men did.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lindquist|first=Christine H|last2=Lindquist|first2=Charles A|date=2009|title=Health Behind Bars: Utilization and Evaluation of Medical Care Among Jail Inmates|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1018794305843|journal=Journal of Community Health|volume=24|issue=4|pages=285|doi=10.1023/A:1018794305843|pmid=10463472|access-date=April 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues in correctional reproductive health care ==

=== Lack of resources ===
A lack of resources, specifically of adequate staff, within facilities is largely what contributes to the substandard care of inmates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  For example, although California's prison system is the largest in the country, an obstetrician/gynecologist was not hired at the [[California Institution for Women]] (CIW) until pregnant prisoners in California filed a class action lawsuit (Harris v. McCarthy) against CIW. The [[Valley State Prison|Valley State Prison for Women]] (VSPW), another prison in California, had just two OB/GYN doctors on staff in 2000 (one of whom was indicted on four counts of sexual misconduct and eventually fired). Albion, a women's prison in New York State, has 1,000 prisoners, but only one GYN doctor, who works only 16 hours per week.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Taconic, another facility in New York, which holds about 370 women, has no GYN doctor on site.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In these cases, routine GYN care falls to the general nurse practitioner or Medical Director.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In addition to the lack of staff, medical doctors are often not on duty on the weekends and during evening hours.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  This can be dangerous if medical emergencies arise during non-business hours.  For example, a prisoner in CIW in 1997 went into labor over the weekend, when there was only one nurse on duty.  The nurse strapped the woman into a gurney, but refused to help with her labor.  When the baby was born not breathing, the nurse had to call paramedics, because she was unable to activate the breathing apparatus.  By the time the newborn was transported to the hospital, he was declared brain dead.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The difficulty with recruiting qualified staff can be attributed to both the physical isolation of women's prisons (often placed in areas that are considered undesirable to live in, where there are few available medical professionals), and to the relative lack of medical resources and low salaries that prisons offer to medical staff.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Dr. Valda Chijide, a former HIV doctor in an Alabama prison, for instance, resigned from her position due to inadequate support.  In this case, the HIV unit was rat-infested, with broken windows covered in plastic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Privatization of prison health care ===
There is also a trend towards privatizing health care by hiring outside, for-profit health care companies to provide medical care to inmates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  According to a 1996 survey by the [[National Institute of Corrections]] (NIC), forty-four state Departments of Corrections contract out at least some of their medical care to private vendors - in 1996 this amounted to $706 million.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This can result in a lack of accountability, as proper monitoring makes a contract more expensive.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Oversight is often lacking. In Alabama, the same official who previously held a high level position at Prison Health Services, one of the nation's largest private vendors, now works in a position within the Alabama Department of Corrections which requires her to oversee Prison Health's compliance to the contract.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Prison Health Services, which has cared for 237,000 inmates, has had to pay millions of dollars in fines and settlements due to inadequate care.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In another example, according to a former supervisory nurse of a jail operated by [[Corizon|Correctional Medical Services]]  (CMS), a large private contractor, the jail would often release pregnant women when they went into labor, and then arrest them again after they gave birth, in order to avoid having to pay for the inmates' medical expenses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Lack of accountability also results due to varying state and federal laws on private contractors' liability for medical abuse and neglect.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Private contractors can be challenged under the same federal civil rights law that applies to state and local governments, but these corporations cannot be sued for unconstitutional medical practices.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Since the first awards in 2009 there have been over 5,000 entries from [[design]] and [[architectural]] industries and [[hospitality]] organisations around the world.

Each year the awards are judged by a new panel of representatives from the fields of [[art]], [[architecture]], [[design]] and [[gastronomy]].  Notable judges have included [[Ian Callum]], [[Mark Hix]],&lt;ref name="Mark Hix"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hix|first1=Mark|title=Chicken and Steak|url=http://www.cntraveller.com/recommended/food/restaurant-and-bar-style-awards|website=Condé Nast Traveller|publisher=Condé Nast Traveller|accessdate=1 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerry Judah]], [[Yotam Ottolenghi]], [[Thomas Heatherwick]], [[Julia Peyton-Jones]] and [[Karim Rashid]]. The winners are awarded at annual ceremonies at a chosen host venue affiliated with the award. In 2012 the ceremony was held at The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA).

Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards organises a year-round programme of events based in the UK and most recently Internationally with an aim to build a network between entrants, judges, partners and sponsors.
 
In 2014 [[Taschen]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiedemann|first1=Julius|title=Restaurant &amp; bar design|date=2014|publisher=TASCHEN|location=Köln|isbn=978-3836546683|url=http://www.taschen.com/pages/en/catalogue/design/all/02882/facts.restaurant_bar_design.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; publications published a book, ''Restaurant &amp; Bar Design'' dedicated to the ongoing work of the Awards.

== Categories==
Each year the Restaurant &amp; Bar Design Awards acknowledges two overall winners under the categories of Best [[Bar (establishment)|Bar]] and Best [[Restaurant]].

The number of additional category winners varies each year. The inaugural award in 2008/2009 was open to entrants from UK and identified nine category winners. In 2009/10 the awards became International and introduced two more category winners under the titles International [[Restaurant]] and International [[Bar (establishment)|Bar]]. The awards also have a number of sub-categories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10862">'''Sleep onset''' is the transition from wakefulness into sleep. Sleep onset usually transmits into [[non-rapid eye movement sleep]] (NREM sleep) but under certain circumstances (e.g. [[narcolepsy]]) it is possible to transit from wakefulness directly into [[rapid eye movement sleep]] (REM sleep).

==History==
During the 1920s an obscure disorder that caused [[encephalitis]] and attacked the part of the brain that regulates sleep influenced Europe and North America. Although the virus that caused this disorder was never identified, the psychiatrist and neurologist [[Constantin von Economo]] decided to study this disease and identified a key component in the sleep-wake regulation. He identified the pathways that regulated wakefulness and sleep onset by studying the parts of the brain that were affected by the disease and the consequences it had on the [[circadian rhythm]]. He stated that the pathways that regulated sleep onset are located between the brain stem and the [[basal forebrain]]. His discoveries were not appreciated until the last two decades of the 20th century when the pathways of sleep onset were found to reside in the exact place that Constantin von Economo stated.&lt;ref name="Saper, Scammell, Lu 05"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Saper, C.B. |author2=Scammell, T.E. |author3=Lu, J. |title=Hypothalamic regulation of sleep and circadian rhythms |journal=Nature |volume=437 |pages=1257–1264 |year=2005 |doi=10.1038/nature04284 |pmid=16251950 |issue=7063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physiological overview{{anchor|Physiological Overview}}==
Sleep electrophysiological measurements can be made by attaching electrodes to the scalp to measure the electroencephalogram (EEG) and to the chin to monitor muscle activity, recorded as the electromyogram (EMG).  Electrodes attached around the eyes monitor eye movements, recorded as the electro-oculogram (EOG).&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 744"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil|title=Physiology of Behavior|year=2013|publisher=Pearson|location=University of Massachusetts, Amherst|isbn=978-0-205-23939-9|pages=744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Economo, in his studies, noticed that lesions in the connection between the midbrain and the diencephalon caused prolonged sleepiness and therefore proposed the idea of an ascending arousal system. During the past few decades major ascending pathways have been discovered with located neurons and respective [[neurotransmitters]]. This pathway divides into two branches: one that ascends to the thalamus and activates the thalamus relay neurons, and another one that activates neurons in the lateral part of the [[hypothalamus]] and the [[basal forebrain]], and throughout the [[cerebral cortex]]. The cell group involved in the first pathway is an [[acetylcholine]]-producing cell group called [[pedunculopontine]] and [[laterodorsal tegmental nucleus]](PPT/LDT). These neurons play a crucial role in bridging information in between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex. These neurons have high activation during wakefulness and during [[REM sleep]] and a low activation during [[NREM sleep]]. The second branch originates from monoaminorgenic neurons. These neurons are located in the [[locus coeruleus]], dorsal and median [[raphe nuclei]], ventral periaqueductal grey matter, and [[tuberomammillary nucleus]]. Each group produces a different neurotransmitter. The neurons in the [[locus coeruleus]] produce [[noradrenaline]], as fore the neurons in the dorsal and median [[raphe nuclei]], ventral periaqueductal grey matter, and [[tuberomammillary nucleus]] produce serotonin, dopamine and histamine respectively. They then project onto the hypothalamic peptidergic neurons, which contain melanin-concentrated hormones or [[orexin]], and basal forebrain neurons which contain [[GABA]] and [[acetylcholine]]. These neurons then project onto the [[cerebral cortex]]. It has also been discovered that lesions to this part of the brain cause prolonged sleep or may produce coma.&lt;ref name="Saper, Scammell, Lu 05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang, Urade, Hayaishi 09"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhi-Li Haung |author2=Yoshihiro Urade |author3=Osamu Hayaishi |title=Prostanglan and adenosine in the regulation of sleep and wakefulness |journal=Journal of Physiology |volume=437 |page=7:33–38 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McGinty, Szymusiak 08"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=McGinty, D |author2=Szymusiak, R |title= Hypothalamic regulation of sleep and arousal |journal=Frontiers in Bioscience |volume=8 |pages=1257–1264 |year=2008 |doi=10.2741/1159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallopin, et al. 05"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gallopin, T |author2=Luppi, PH |author3=Cauli, B |author4=Urade, Y |author5=Rossier, J |author6=Hayaishi, O |author7=Lambolez, B |author8=Fort, P |title=The endogenous somnogen adenosine excites a subset of sleep-promoting neurons via A2A receptors in the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus |journal=Neuroscience |volume=134 |pages=1377–90 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2005.05.045 |pmid=16039802 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sleep cycle is normally defined in stages.  When an individual first begins to sleep, stage 1 is entered, marked by the presence of some theta activity, which indicates that the firing of neurons in the neocortex is becoming more synchronized, as well as alpha wave activity (smooth electrical activity of 8–12&amp;nbsp;Hz recorded from the brain, generally associated with a state of relaxation).  This stage is a transition between sleep and wakefulness.  An individual's eyelids will from time to time slowly open and close and their eyes will roll upward and downward.  Before one reaches sound sleep, stage 2 is entered.  The EEG during this phase is normally irregular, but contains periods of theta activity, sleep spindles, and K complexes.  Sleep spindles are short bursts of waves of 12–14&amp;nbsp;Hz that occur between two and five times a minute during states 1-4 of sleep.  They appear to play a role in memory consolidation, and increased number of sleep spindles are correlated with increased scores on tests of intelligence. K complexes are sudden, sharp waveforms, which, unlike sleep spindles, are usually found only during stage 2 of sleep.  They spontaneously occur at the rate of approximately one per minute, but often can be triggered by unexpected noises.  It has been found that K complexes consist of isolated periods of inhibition.  They appear to be the precursor of delta waves, also known as slow wave sleep, which appear during the deepest levels of sleep.  Both these stages are classified as non-REM sleep.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 744"/&gt;

==Neural circuit==
Sleep onset is finally induced by sleep-promoting neurons, located in the [[ventrolateral preoptic nucleus]] (VLPO). The sleep-promoting neurons are believed to project [[GABA]] type A and [[galanin]], two known inhibitory neurotransmitters, to arousal-promoting neurons, such as histaminergic, serotonergic, orexinergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons (neurons mentioned above).  Levels of acetylcholine, norepinepherine, serotonin, and histamine decrease with the onset of sleep, for they are all wakefulness promoting neurotransmitters.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 744"/&gt; Therefore, it is believed that the activation of sleep-promoting neurons causes the inhibition of arousal-promoting neurons, which leads to sleep.  Evidence has shown that during the sleep-wake cycle, sleep-promoting neurons and the arousal-promoting neurons have reciprocal discharges, and that during [[NREM sleep]], [[GABA]] receptors increase in the arousal-promoting neurons. This had led some to believe that the increase of [[GABA]] receptors in the arousal-promoting neurons is another pathway of inducing sleep.&lt;ref name="Saper, Scammell, Lu 05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Huang, Urade, Hayaishi 09"/&gt;&lt;ref name="McGinty, Szymusiak 08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallopin, et al. 05"/&gt;

Specifically, Adenosine is known as the sleep promoting nucleoside neuromodulator.  Astrocytes maintain a small stock of nutrients in the form of glycogen.  In times of increased brain activity, such as during daytime, this glycogen is converted into fuel for neurons; thus, prolonged wakefulness causes a decrease in the level of glycogen in the brain.  A fall in the level of glycogen causes an increase in the level of extracellular adenosine, which has an inhibitory effect in neural activity.  This accumulation of adenosine serves as a sleep-promoting substance.  Additionally, the production of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine increases in the hippocampus as sleep continues, and also increases in the cortex until REM sleep is reached.&lt;ref name="Carlson 2013 744"/&gt;

The majority of sleep neurons are located in the ventrolateral preoptic area (vlPOA).  These sleep neurons are silent until an individual shows a transition from waking to sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=K|author2=JS Lin |author3=K Sakai |title=Characterization and mapping of sleep-waking specific neurons in the basal forebrain and preoptic hypothalamus in mice|journal=Neuroscience|date=June 16, 2009|volume=161|issue=1|pages=269–292|doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.02.075|pmid=19285545|url=http://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-00383292/document}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sleep neurons in the preoptic area receive inhibitory inputs from some of the same regions they inhibit, including the tubermammillary nucleus, raphe nuclei, and locus coeruleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chou|first=TC|author2=AA Bjorkum |author3=SE Gaus |author4=J Lu |title=Afferents to the Ventrolateral Preoptic Nucleus|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|year=2002|volume=22|issue=3|pages=977–990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, they are inhibited by histamine, serotonin, and norepinepherine.  This mutual inhibition may provide the basis for establishing periods of sleep and waking.  A reciprocal inhibition also characterizes an electronic circuit known as the flip-flop.  A flip-flop can assume one of two states, usually referred to as on or off.  Thus, either the sleep neurons are active and inhibit the wakefulness neurons, or the wakefulness neurons are active and inhibit the sleep neurons,  Because these regions are mutually inhibitory, it is impossible for neurons in both sets of regions to be active at the same time.  This flip-flop, switching from one state to another quickly, can be unstable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saper|first=CB|author2=TC Chou |author3=TE Scammell |title=The sleep twitch: Hypothalamic control of sleep and wakefulness|journal=Trends in Neurosciences|year=2001|volume=24|issue=12|pages=726–731|doi=10.1016/s0166-2236(00)02002-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Susan Erica Fear''' (18 March 1963&amp;nbsp;– 28 May 2006) was an Australian mountain climber, supporter of the [http://www.hollows.org Fred Hollows Foundation] and a 2005 recipient of the [[Order of Australia]] medal in the Queen's birthday honours. Her life and climbing career is illustrated in her biography ''Fear No Boundary: The Road to Everest and Beyond'', written by fellow climber [[Lincoln Hall (climber)|Lincoln Hall]] and Fear, published in 2005.

== Early life ==
Fear was born on 18 March 1963 in [[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]], [[New South Wales]], Australia, she was the middle child in her family, with two brothers Grahame and John.&lt;ref name=fear.org-bio&gt;{{cite web |title=Biography |url=http://www.suefear.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=2 |publisher=www.suefear.org |accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents were Ron and Joan Fear. Her mother Joan died from [[breast cancer]] in May 1988, and her father Ron died unexpectedly of a [[heart attack]] in June 2002.&lt;ref name=book-Fear-no /&gt;

Fear attended St Ives North Public School in her primary school years where she was the [[School Captain]], and later attended [[Abbotsleigh]] (7–10) where she was the softball captain, and [[Barker College]] (11–12) in Sydney's north where she was a prefect and the captain of both hockey and cricket. While at school she attained the Duke of Edinburgh's Gold Award.

== Career ==
After leaving school, Fear took an office job with Wilderness Expeditions, an adventure travel company founded by [[Tim Macartney-Snape]]. That company was later acquired by World Expeditions, and she moved out of the office and into the field. She became an adventure guide and led cross country ski trips in Australia as well as treks in [[Africa]], [[South America]] and [[Asia]]. She was recognized as one of the company's senior guides, leading many physically challenging mountaineering expeditions.

== Climbing career achievements ==
Between 1997 and 2006 Fear climbed five of the world's fourteen 8,000 metre peaks.  Her climbing career took off in 1997 when she led the first successful ascent by an Australian team of [[Makalu|Makalu II]] (7,680&amp;nbsp;m) in Nepal.  She followed this with ascents of [[Cho Oyu]] (8,201&amp;nbsp;m) in 1998 and [[Shishapangma]] (8,046&amp;nbsp;m) in 2002. In 2003, Fear climbed [[Mount Everest|Everest]] (8,848&amp;nbsp;m) from the more difficult Tibetan side on the [[North Col]]. She was the first Australian-born woman and the second Australian woman overall to do so. She then successfully summitted [[Gasherbrum II]] (8,035&amp;nbsp;m) in Pakistan the following year (2004). Her final climb was to [[Manaslu]] (8,156&amp;nbsp;m) in 2006, which she successfully summited.

== Recognition ==
Fear was awarded the [[Order of Australia Medal]] (OAM) in 2005 for her work as Ambassador for [[The Fred Hollows Foundation]] and for services to mountaineering, which will have an eye clinic named after her in [[Dhading Besi]], Nepal. Fear was also named the 2003 Adventurer of the Year by the [[Australian Geographic Society]]. She was an ambassador for the [[Australian Himalayan Foundation]], and also helped raise funds for [[Australian Nepalese Medical Group]].

== Book ==
Fears' life and climbing career is written about in the biographical book ''Fear No Boundary: The Road to Everest and Beyond'', written by fellow climber Lincoln Hall (with Sue Fear), and first published in Melbourne by Lothian Books in 2005.&lt;ref name=book-Fear-no&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hall|first1=Lincoln with |last2=Fear|first2=Sue |title=Fear No Boundary: The Road to Everest and Beyond |date=2005 |publisher=Lothian |location=South Melbourne |isbn=978-0-7344-0786-3 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=i97XAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=Fear+No+Boundary:+The+Road+to+Everest+and+Beyond&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Bvs9VaaXFaPsmAXmiIG4Bg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA |accessdate=27 April 2015 |via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final climb ==
Fear died on Sunday, 28 May 2006,&lt;ref name=fear.org-bio /&gt; when she fell into a crevasse (approx. 7,800&amp;nbsp;m) while descending from the summit of [[Manaslu]] in Nepal. Manaslu was her fifth climb of a mountain over 8,000 metres.  Her body remains on the mountain, honouring an earlier request if she were to die whilst climbing a mountain.&lt;ref name=ABC-diary/&gt; A plaque now lies in memory of her just above the town of [[Bandipur]] on a small hill facing Manaslu.&lt;ref name=ABC-diary&gt;{{cite news |last1=Baillie|first1=Rebecca |title=Sue Fear's video diary from Mount Manaslu |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2008/s2404914.htm |accessdate=27 April 2015 |work=[[The 7.30 Report]]|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |date=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Whitelies.tv''' was the adult brand for the anti-tobacco education campaign for the state of [[Indiana]] and was launched in 2001, by the Indiana Tobacco Prevention and Cessation (ITPC). The state agency is charged (by the 2000 Indiana General Assembly) with using [[Master Settlement Agreement]] funds for the purpose of decreasing the high rate of tobacco use in Indiana. Whitelies.tv brand is no longer being used for Indiana's anti-tobacco marketing program.

== History of WhiteLies.tv ==
The Indiana Tobacco Use Prevention and Cessation Executive Board was created to oversee funding from Indiana’s share of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement. The Board created a plan for the funds, which was set to include media components, special youth features, settlement enforcement, cessation initiatives and community programs. On July 1, 2011 Indiana Tobacco Prevention and Cessation became part of the State Health Department. Tobacco reduction and protection from secondhand smoke exposure will now be further integrated into many existing State health promotion programs, such as cancer prevention, oral health, asthma care, maternal/prenatal health, cardiovascular health, and minority, women’s, and children’s health. The Tobacco Prevention and Cessation Commission will continue to serve Hoosiers in the fight against tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure.

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[File:Ratpoisonad.jpg|thumb|left|300px|WhiteLies.tv Billboard.]] --&gt;The WhiteLies.tv brand was the first brand created for media outreach. WhiteLies.tv grew out of the need to educate and expose the tobacco industry's lies about the dangers of their products. In March 2002, advertising for the brand focused on the tobacco industry’s greed and the harmful effects of tobacco use on Hoosiers. The campaign was designed to educate consumers on the tobacco industry’s documented manipulative marketing tactics and the negative health consequences of tobacco use on Indiana.

The Whitelies.tv media campaign was present throughout Indiana and included television, radio, outdoor billboards, and newspaper ads and public relations. Today, the Quit Now Indiana brand is being promoted throughout state. Efforts are continuing to support the tobacco-free message. Examples of the current advertising can be found on the QuitNowIndiana.com website. There are currently over 65 community partners across Indiana trained to extend and maximize the state’s campaign budget.

==Quit 2 Win Contest==
Quit 2 Win is a statewide promotional contest designed to encourage Hoosiers using tobacco products to make an attempt to quit. This promotion is part of the larger statewide WhiteLies.tv cessation campaign. In 2008, Zachary Joley of Ft. Wayne, Indiana was awarded the grand prize of $2,500 for quitting tobacco use.&lt;ref&gt;"Quit 2 Win" Stop Smoking Contest Winners, http://www.munciefreepress.com/node/18465&lt;/ref&gt; The contest awarded another $2,500 winner in 2009 to a 20-year-old mother who had been smoking since she was 9.&lt;ref&gt;A Decision to Make, http://www.reporter-times.com/stories/2009/04/14/news.qp-1636246.sto&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indiana Quitline==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1800QuitNow 2c.jpg|thumb|right|200px]] --&gt;1-800-Quit-Now is the Indiana Tobacco Quitline and it is a free phone-based counseling service affiliated with WhiteLies.tv. 1-800-Quit-Now and WhiteLies.tv can be found on many of the same advertisements. The services include:
* One on one coaching for Tobacco Users who have decided to quit
* Resources for Healthcare Providers who want to improve patient outcomes
* Best Practices for Employers who want to implement smoke-free policies
* Support for Family and Friends who want to help loved ones stop smoking
* Tools for Tobacco Control partners to complement their current programs&lt;ref&gt;Indiana Tobacco Quitline, http://www.indianatobaccoquitline.net/&lt;/ref&gt; {{-}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2466">'''Women's Health Action and Mobilization''' (WHAM!) was an [[United States|American]] [[activist]] organization based in [[New York City]], established in 1989 in response to the U.S. [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services that states may bar the use of public money and public facilities for [[abortion]]s. 

WHAM! used [[direct action]] tactics such as draping the [[Statue of Liberty]] with a protest banner and disrupting the confirmation hearings of [[Supreme Court Justice]] [[David Souter]].

In 1989 members of WHAM! and [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]] took part in a  [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power#Criticism and controversy|controversial action]] at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|Saint Patrick's Cathedral]] to protest the church’s position on [[homosexuality]], [[Safe sex|safe-sex education]] and the use of [[condoms]]. WHAM! helped to form two additional activist groups, the [[New York Clinic Defense Task Force]] and the [[Church Ladies for Choice]].

==Notes and references==
{{reflist}} 

As of 2007 there were approximately 40 boxes of WHAM! materials, categorized but not indexed, at the Tamiment Library, which is a sub-library at the Bobst Library of New York University. In addition, interviews of past WHAM! participants were conducted in 2005 by Tamar W. Carroll, a doctoral candidate in History at the University of Michigan, for a dissertation concerning WHAM!, ACT UP, The [[National Congress of Neighborhood Women]], and Mobilization For Youth. The resulting dissertation was titled ''Grassroots Feminism: Direct Action Organizing and Coalition Building in New York City, 1955-1995''. As part of her oral history research a forum on WHAM! was held at the Tamiment Library on October 15, 2005, with panel members, and most of the audience, consisting of former WHAM! activists.

'''Zheng Ji''' ({{zh|c=郑集}}) (6 May 1900 &amp;ndash; 29 July 2010) was a [[nutritionist]] and a pioneering [[biochemist]] from [[Nanxi District, Yibin|Nanxi]], [[Sichuan]] province, China. He was reputed to be the world's oldest professor and the founder of modern nutrition science in [[China]]. He lived to the [[supercentenarian|age of 110]].

== Career ==
In 1924 Zheng Ji passed the entrance exam for the Southeast National University (originally known as the Nanjing Advanced Normal School, moving in 1928 to the National Central University, and then to the [[Nanjing University]]) biology department in 1929.  In 1930 he went to [[United States|America]] to study, majoring in biochemistry at [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]].  He also attended [[Yale]] and [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]], and in 1936 he obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]].

Upon returning to China he successively served as a research fellow at the Scientific Research Institute of China; as a professor at the Central Medical School; as both a biochemistry professor and department head, simultaneously, at the Eastern China Military Medical School; as a professor at the Number 4 Military Medical College; and as both a biology professor and the head of the biochemistry teaching and research department at the Nanjing Medical School.

In 1945, at the Central Medical School, he established a biochemistry research institute to train graduate students.  This was the first formal organization in China to teach biochemistry to graduate students, training a large number of students who went on to work in a variety of fields.  After turning 70 he began to study the biochemistry of old age, proposing a theory of metabolic imbalance, forming the basis of geriatric biochemistry in China.

He participated in the establishment of the Chinese Nutrition Society and, later on, the Biochemistry Society.  He was a past chairman of the Central University Professors Association and the first council chair of the Chinese Nutrition Society.

Zheng Ji turned 110 in May 2010 and at the time was claimed to be the oldest professor living in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World's oldest professor turns 109 |url=http://www.cctv.com/program/cultureexpress/20090507/107284.shtml |publisher=[[China Central Television]] |date=7 May 2009 |accessdate=6 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent the greater part of his life teaching at the medical school and biology department of Nanjing University.

==Personal life==

In recent years prior to his death he sold off family property, such as his family home, using the proceeds to make donations both to the university and to society at large, and to set up both a scholarship for needy students and a scientific endowment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Zheng Ji died on 29 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nanjing: World's oldest professor, who kept working after 100, passes away | date = 2010-07-30 | url = http://news.xinhuanet.com/edu/2010-07/30/c_12389597.htm | work = www.news.cn | accessdate = 2010-08-15 | language = Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;
