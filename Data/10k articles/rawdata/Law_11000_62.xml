==Background==
Hamza was born in [[Alexandria]], Egypt, as '''Mustafa Kamel Mustafa''' in 1958, the son of a middle-class army [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]. In 1979, he entered Britain on a [[student visa]].&lt;ref name="graun1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://society.guardian.co.uk/asylumseekers/story/0,7991,946966,00.html|title=5 tough questions about asylum-part 2|last=Brooks|first=Libby|date=1 May 2003|work=The Guardian|accessdate=18 March 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His initial reaction to life in Britain was to describe it as "a paradise, where you could do anything you wanted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/profile/abu-hamza.shtml|title=BBC Four&amp;nbsp;– Storyville|publisher=BBC|date=25 November 2011|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied civil engineering at [[University of Brighton|Brighton Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1081&amp;id=77202003|title=As a fundamentalist cleric reviled and revered for his preaches of hate|last=Lawson|first=Tracy|date=21 January 2003|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to his conversion to Islamism in Malta, 1999, Hamza was known as a "gentle giant" and a "womaniser".&lt;ref name="GadSTAug18"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gadher |first1=Dipesh |title=Ladies' man Abu Hamza plunged hook, line and sinker into Soho sleaze |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/ladies-man-abu-hamza-plunged-hook-line-and-sinker-into-soho-sleaze-nnsb2p7q7 |accessdate=27 August 2018 |work=The Sunday Times |date=26 August 2018 |subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamza gained employment as a bouncer in the strip bars of Soho in the under his original name from 1980 until 1983, when club baron Jean Agius was arrested and charged for conspiring to be a [[pimp]]. Agius alleges that Hamza may have also co-owned a club during this time.&lt;ref name="GadSTAug18"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, Hamza lived in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] under another name, and fought alongside [[Bosniaks]] against [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]] during the [[Bosnian War]].&lt;ref name="rfe"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2006/02/585e69f9-0847-4e76-9750-14d31a46bd81.html|title=U.K.: Muslim Extremist Preacher Gets Seven Years in Jail|last=Nun|first=Jan|date=8 February 2006|publisher=Radio Free Europe|accessdate=21 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tol"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article728227.ece|title=Profile: Abu Hamza|last=Naughton|first=Philippe|date=7 February 2006|work=Times Online edition|accessdate=21 March 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Family===
On 16 May 1980, Hamza married British citizen Valerie Fleming, a [[Roman Catholic]] [[religious conversion|convert]] to Islam,&lt;ref name="bbcfeb06"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4694218.stm|title=Hamza's ex-wife life threatened|date=8 February 2006|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon after they had a son, Mohammed Mustafa Kamel born in October 1981. In 1984, their relationship came under increasing strain and later in that year Hamza took three-year-old Mohammed with him to Egypt, effectively breaking contact with Valerie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Syal|first1=Rajeev|title=Hooked on Hamza|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hooked-on-hamza-39lzhng27ff|date=18 February 2006|publisher=The Times|location=London|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually they divorced and he married Najat Mustafa, with whom he has seven children: five sons followed by two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Casciani|first=Dominic|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4644960.stm|title=Profile: Abu Hamza|publisher=BBC|date=7 February 2006|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamza's stepdaughter, Donna Traverso, told ''[[The Times]]'' in 2006 that she was convinced Hamza had duped her mother into marrying him in order to gain the right to stay in the UK (see "Arrests, charges and imprisonment" below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Syal |first1=Rajeev |title=Dad is a coward, a hypocrite and he deserves to rot in jail |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dad-is-a-coward-a-hypocrite-and-he-deserves-to-rot-in-jail-8hfj38jt6f8 |accessdate=27 August 2018 |work=The Times |date=27 July 2006 |subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Hamza's son Mohammed, then 17 years old, was arrested in [[Yemen]] with Hamza's stepson Mohssin Ghalain and eight other men. All were tried and convicted of planning a terrorist bombing campaign that the prosecution alleged Hamza had sent the men to carry out.

==Religious life==
Hamza was the imam of [[North London Central Mosque|Finsbury Park Mosque]] from 1997, and a leader of the [[Supporters of Sharia]], a group that believed in a strict interpretation of [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. On 14 September 1999, he sent an article to ''[[Al-Hayat]]'', one of the largest pan-Arab newspapers, supporting the [[Russian apartment bombings]], claiming that while "in a war, no one targets women and children in a war", these attacks were necessary as "a Muslim revenge for the Russian criminal policies in [[Chechnya]]". In 2003, he addressed a rally in [[central London]] called by the Islamic [[al-Muhajiroun]], where members spoke of their support for [[Islamist]] goals such as the creation of a new Islamic [[caliphate]] and replacing the Western-backed Middle Eastern regimes. On 4 February 2003 (after being suspended since April 2002), Hamza was dismissed from his position at the Finsbury Park Mosque by the [[Charity Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4689816.stm|work=BBC News|title=Mosque raid findings revealed|date=7 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4639074.stm|work=BBC News|title=The battle for the mosque|date=7 February 2006|first1=Dominic|last1=Casciani|first2=Sharif|last2=Sakr}}&lt;/ref&gt; the government department that regulates charities in England and [[Wales]]. After his exclusion from the mosque, he preached outside the gates until May 2004, when he was arrested at the start of US extradition proceedings against him (see below).&lt;ref name="bbc270504"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3752517.stm|title=Profile: Abu Hamza al-Masri|last=Casciani|first=Dominic|date=27 May 2004|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamza publicly expressed support for Islamist goals such as creating a caliphate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article787810.ece|location=London|work=The Times|title=Abu Hamzas video call to arms|first=Sean|last=Oneill|date=13 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[Osama bin Laden]]. He wrote a paper entitled ''El Ansar'' (''The Victor'') in which he expressed support for the actions of the [[Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) in [[Algeria]], but he later rejected them when they started killing civilians.&lt;ref name=john&gt;"The Algerian Question", ''Algeria: Anger of the Dispossessed'', [[Yale University Press]], John Phillips and Martin Evans, 2007, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt; In one sermon relating to the necessity of Jihad, he said: "Allah likes those who believe in Him who kill those who do not believe in Him. Allah likes that. So if you Muslims don't like that because you hate the blood, there is something wrong with you."&lt;ref&gt;Salafimedia.com "Join the Victorious Party (Part l)".&lt;/ref&gt; He allegedly associated with [[Abdullah el-Faisal]], a Jamaican Muslim convert cleric who preached in the UK until he was imprisoned for urging his followers to murder Jews, Hindus, Christians and Americans, subsequently being deported to Jamaica in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iVDDl6xfgfMC&amp;pg=PT163&amp;dq=Abdullah+el-Faisal&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Abdullah%20el-Faisal&amp;f=false |title=Dictionary of terrorism|page=145|first=John Richard|last=Thackrah|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-29820-9|year=2004|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests, charges and imprisonment==
Hamza was arrested in December 1980 during a raid on a Soho strip club for overstaying his tourist visa, which allowed him to stay in the UK for one month. He pleaded guilty to overstay but was allowed to remain in the UK as he was married to a British citizen, Valerie Fleming.&lt;ref name="GadSTAug18"/&gt;

On 26 August 2004, Hamza was arrested by British police under section 41 of the [[Terrorism Act 2000]], which covers the instigation of acts of terrorism. Charges against him were dropped on 31 August 2004, but he was kept in jail whilst a US extradition case was developed and British authorities drew up further criminal charges of their own.&lt;ref name="bbc310804"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/3616524.stm|title=Muslim cleric Hamza de-arrested|date=31 August 2004|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost two months later, on 19 October 2004, Hamza was charged with fifteen&amp;nbsp;offences under the provisions of various British statutes, including encouraging the killing of non-Muslims, and intent to stir up [[racism|racial hatred]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/01/06/britain.hamza/index.html|title=Cleric faces trial on 16 charges |publisher=CNN|date=1 August 2006|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trial commenced on 5 July 2005, but was adjourned, and not resumed until 9 January 2006. On 7 February 2006, he was found guilty on eleven charges and not guilty on four:
* Guilty of six charges of soliciting murder under the [[Offences against the Person Act 1861]]; not guilty on three further such charges.
* Guilty of three charges related to "using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent to stir up racial hatred, contrary to section 18 (1) of the [[Public Order Act 1986]]",&lt;ref name=Crown /&gt; not guilty on one further such charge.
* Guilty of one charge of "possession of threatening, abusive or insulting recordings of sound, with intent to stir up racial hatred, contrary to section 23 of the Public Order Act 1986".&lt;ref name=Crown /&gt;
* Guilty of one charge of "possessing a document containing information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism",&lt;ref name=Crown&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/press_releases/105_06/|title=Abu Hamza convicted of eleven charges|date=2 July 2006|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the Terrorism Act 2000, s58. This charge under the Terrorism Act of 2000 related to his possession of an ''[[Encyclopedia of Afghan Jihad]]'', an ''[[Al Qaeda Handbook]]'' and other propaganda materials produced by Abu Hamza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author =Vikram Dodd |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jan/12/terrorism.islam?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|title=Islamic cleric had terror handbook, court told|work=The Guardian|date=12 January 2006|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In sentencing, [[Anthony Hughes, Lord Hughes of Ombersley|Mr Justice Hughes]] said Hamza had "helped to create an atmosphere in which to kill has become regarded by some as not only a legitimate course but a moral and religious duty in pursuit of perceived justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/preacher-of-hate-jailed-in-britain/2006/02/08/1139379570546.html |title='Preacher of hate' jailed in Britain|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=9 February 2006|accessdate=10 April 2012|first1=Duncan|last1=Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Hamza was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.

In September 2012, [[Frank Gardner (journalist)|Frank Gardner]] revealed that Queen [[Elizabeth II]] had been upset some years earlier that Abu Hamza al-Masri could not be arrested.&lt;ref name=bbc-bbc-apology&gt;{{cite news

==Costs==
On 18 January 2007, Lord Justice Hughes made an order for the recovery of the full costs of the court-appointed defence of the race-hate charges, estimated in excess of £1 million. This judgement was based on his view that "the story I have been told today (by Abu Hamza) is simply not true" that he [Abu Hamza] had no share in a £220,000 house in Greenford, west London. Hamza had claimed it belonged to his sister. The court also found that Abu Hamza was contributing £9000 a year for private education for his children.&lt;ref name="bbc180107"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6276209.stm|title=Abu Hamza must pay £1m for trial|date=18 January 2007|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extradition to the United States==
On 27 May 2004, Hamza was detained on [[Detention of suspect|remand]] by British authorities and appeared before [[magistrate]]s at the start of a process to try to [[extradition|extradite]] him to the United States. Yemen also requested his extradition. The United States wanted Hamza to stand trial for eleven counts relating to the taking of sixteen hostages in Yemen in 1998, advocating jihad in Afghanistan in 2001, supporting [[James Ujaama]] in an alleged attempt to establish a "terrorist training camp" in late 1999 and early 2000 near [[Bly, Oregon|Bly]], Oregon, and of providing aid to al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Whitehead |first=Tom |title=Abu Hamza could be out of Britain in days after losing extradition appeal|date=24 September 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/9563658/Abu-Hamza-could-be-out-of-Britain-in-dots-after-losing-extradition-appeal.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925031522/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/9563658/Abu-Hamza-could-be-out-of-Britain-in-days-after-losing-extradition-appeal.html|archivedate=25 September 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2004/May/04_crm_371.htm |title=Abu Hamza arrested in London on terrorism charges files in the United States.|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|date=27 May 2004|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ujaama is a US citizen who had met Abu Hamza in England in 1999 and was indicted in the US for providing aid to al-Qaeda, attempting to establish a terrorist training camp, and for running a website advocating global jihad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/08/29/ujaama.background/index.html|work=CNN|title=From community activist to alleged terror conspirator|date=29 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Hamza was in Britain throughout the relevant period.

Hamza could not face the death penalty if extradited to the United States because the UK is a signatory to the [[European Convention of Human Rights|European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR). On 15 November 2007, British courts gave permission for Hamza's extradition to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7096244.stm|title=Abu Hamza could face extradition |publisher=BBC|date=15 November 2007|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article1322245.ece|title=Abu Hamza will be sent packing to America straight after serving his jail sentence in Britain|work=The Sun|date=20 June 2008|accessdate=10 April 2012|first=Simon |last=Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abu Hamza appealed against this decision to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECtHR). In the meantime, Hamza was kept in prison after the completion of his sentence.

On 8 July 2010, the [[ECtHR]] temporarily blocked Hamza's extradition to the United States to face terrorism charges until the court was satisfied that he would not be treated inhumanely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jul/08/abu-hamza-human-rights-ruling|location=London|work=The Guardian|title=Abu Hamza extradition to US blocked by European court|first=Vikram|last=Dodd|date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court based its judgement on ECHR, which applies to British law. It is an absolute prohibition for a signatory to the ECHR to remove anyone to a place where they would be subject to inhumane or degrading treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/philipjohnston/100046585/abu-hamza-extradition-to-us-blocked-on-human-rights-grounds|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Abu Hamza extradition to US blocked on human rights grounds|date=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In past cases, the ECtHR has prevented the UK from deporting suspected foreign terrorists to places where they might be tortured. In Hamza's case, this has been extended to refusing extradition to a country where he might be jailed for life, and where the prison regime is judged too harsh. The court said there should be further legal argument on whether life without parole would be a breach of human rights. The court asked for fresh submissions on whether Hamza, and other prisoners awaiting extradition, would face inhumane treatment in the US if they were sent there to stand trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7075492_ITM|work=UPI News|title=Yemen seeks Abu Hamza's extradition.(UPI Top Stories)|date=29 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2012, the court said he could be extradited to the US to face terrorism charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hue|first=Sylvia|title=UK TO EXTRADITE RADICAL MUSLIM CLERIC TO US|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/uk-extradite-radical-muslim-cleric-us|work=Associated Press|accessdate=25 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After considering all evidence, statements by officials at [[ADX Florence]], the court held that "conditions at ADX would not amount to ill-treatment" and also stated that "not all inmates convicted of international terrorism were housed at ADX and, even if they were, sufficient procedural safeguards were in place, such as holding a hearing before deciding on such a transfer" and that "if the transfer process had been unsatisfactory, there was the possibility of bringing a claim to both the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]' administrative remedy programme and the US federal courts",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court rejects claims that extraditing Abu Hamza to the US would breach his human rights|first=John|last=Hall|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=10 April 2012|accessdate=23 February 2013|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/court-rejects-claims-that-extraditing-abu-hamza-to-the-us-would-breach-his-human-rights-7630209.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the {{USCFR|28|542}} Administrative Remedy Program. On 26 September 2012, a High Court judge halted the extradition of Hamza to the US on terror charges after the cleric launched a last-ditch appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19730438|title=Abu Hamza: High Court judge halts extradition to the US |publisher=BBC|date=26 September 2012|accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2012, the High Court granted the UK's government's request to extradite Hamza to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Casciani|first=Dominic|date=5 October 2012|title=Abu Hamza to be extradited to US|newspaper=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19842941}}&lt;/ref&gt; The removal process took place that same evening, when Hamza was taken from [[Long Lartin]] jail to [[RAF Mildenhall]] in Suffolk, where he was placed into the hands of the [[United States Marshals Service|US Marshals]].

Abu Hamza arrived in the US on the morning of 6 October 2012 to face eleven charges relating to hostage taking, conspiracy to establish a militant training camp and calling for holy war in [[Afghanistan]]. He appeared in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] on 6 October and was then taken into custody. He appeared in court again on 9 October and pleaded not guilty to eleven charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Roth, Richard  |author2=Smith, Olivia|date=9 October 2012|title=Radical Islamist Abu Hamza al-Masri pleads not guilty|newspaper=CNN|url= http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/09/justice/us-abu-hamza-case/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010085514/http://edition.cnn.com/2012/10/09/justice/us-abu-hamza-case/index.html|archivedate=10 October 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Abu Hamza due in US court following extradition|publisher=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19855380|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006170512/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-19855380|archivedate=6 October 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author = Leithead, Alastair |title=Abu Hamza extradition: US court hears terror suspects |newspaper=BBC News|date=7 October 2012|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19857517|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324061912/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19857517|archivedate=24 March 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anonymous P2P''' communication system is a [[peer-to-peer]] [[distributed application]] in which the [[Node (networking)|nodes]], which are used to share resources, or participants are [[Anonymity|anonymous]] or [[Pseudonymity|pseudonymous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kobusińska|first=Anna|last2=Brzeziński|first2=Jerzy|last3=Boroń|first3=Michał|last4=Inatlewski|first4=Łukasz|last5=Jabczyński|first5=Michał|last6=Maciejewski|first6=Mateusz|date=2016-06-01|title=A branch hash function as a method of message synchronization in anonymous P2P conversations|url=https://content.sciendo.com/view/journals/amcs/26/2/article-p479.xml|journal=International Journal of Applied Mathematics and Computer Science|language=en|volume=26|issue=2|pages=479–493|doi=10.1515/amcs-2016-0034|issn=2083-8492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anonymity of participants is usually achieved by special routing [[overlay network]]s that hide the physical location of each node from other participants.

Interest in anonymous P2P systems has increased in recent years for many reasons, ranging from the desire to share files without revealing one's network identity and risking [[litigation]]&lt;ref name="eff"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation (2005). [https://www.eff.org/wp/riaa-v-people-five-years-later RIAA v. The People: Five Years Later]. Retrieved March 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; to distrust in governments, concerns over [[mass surveillance]] and [[data retention]], and [[lawsuit]]s against [[blog]]gers.&lt;ref name="rsf"&gt;Julien Pain, editor (2005). [http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542 Reporters Without Borders handbook for bloggers and cyber-dissidents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070215022127/http://www.rsf.org/rubrique.php3?id_rubrique=542 |date=2007-02-15 }}. Retrieved January 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation for anonymity==
There are many reasons to use anonymous P2P technology; most of them are generic to all forms of online anonymity.

P2P users who desire anonymity usually do so as they do not wish to be identified as a publisher (sender), or reader (receiver), of information. Common reasons include:
* [[Censorship]] at the local, organizational, or national level
* Personal privacy preferences such as preventing [[Website visitor tracking|tracking]] or [[data mining]] activities
* The material or its distribution is considered illegal or incriminating by possible [[eavesdropper]]s
* Material is legal but socially deplored, embarrassing or problematic in the individual's [[social world]]
* Fear of retribution (against [[whistleblower]]s, unofficial leaks, and [[activist]]s who do not believe in restrictions on information nor [[knowledge]])

A particularly open view on legal and illegal content is given in [https://web.archive.org/web/20090627205546/http://freenetproject.org/philosophy.html The Philosophy Behind Freenet].

Governments are also interested in anonymous P2P technology. The [[United States]] [[Navy]] funded the original [[onion routing]] research that led to the development of the [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] network, which was later funded by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and is now developed by the non-profit organization The Tor Project, Inc.

==Arguments for and against anonymous P2P communication==

===General===
While anonymous P2P systems may support the protection of unpopular speech, they may also protect illegal activities, such as [[fraud]], [[slander and libel|libel]], the exchange of illegal [[pornography]], the unauthorized copying of [[copyright]]ed works, or the planning of criminal activities. Critics{{Who|date=October 2009}} of anonymous P2P systems hold that these disadvantages outweigh the advantages offered by such systems, and that other communication channels are already sufficient for unpopular speech.

Some{{Who|date=October 2009}} proponents of anonymous P2P systems believe that all restrictions on free speech serve authoritarian interests. Others{{Who|date=October 2009}} argue that information itself is ethically neutral, and that it is the people acting upon the information that can be good or evil. Perceptions of good and evil can also change (see [[moral panic]]); for example, if anonymous peer-to-peer networks had existed in the 1950s or 1960s, they might have been targeted for carrying information about [[civil rights]] or [[anarchism]].

Easily accessible anonymous P2P networks are seen by some as a democratization of [[encryption]] technology, giving the general populace access to secure communications channels already used by governments. Supporters of this view, such as [[Phil Zimmermann]], argue that anti-surveillance technologies help to equalize power between governments and their people,&lt;ref name="Zimmermann_interview"&gt;Russell D. Hoffmann (1996). [http://www.animatedsoftware.com/hightech/philspgp.htm Interview with author of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy)]. Transcript of a radio interview, retrieved 2008-01-21.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the actual reason for banning them. [[John Pilger]] opines that  monitoring of the populace helps to contain threats to the "consensual view of established authority"&lt;ref name="pilger"&gt;John Pilger (2002). [http://www.zmag.org/znet/viewArticle/11340 Impartiality of British Journalism]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. ZNet article, retrieved 2008-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt; or threats to the continuity of power structures and privilege.

===Freedom of speech===
Some claim that true [[freedom of speech]], especially on controversial subjects, is difficult or impossible unless individuals can speak anonymously. If anonymity is not possible, one could be subjected to threats or reprisals for voicing an unpopular view. This is one reason why voting is done by secret [[ballot]] in many democracies. Controversial information which a party wants to keep hidden, such as details about corruption issues, is often published or leaked anonymously.

====Anonymous blogging====
{{main|Anonymous blogging}}
[[Anonymous blogging]] is one widespread use of anonymous networks. While anonymous blogging is possible on the non-anonymous internet to some degree too, a provider hosting the blog in question might be forced to disclose the blogger's [[IP address]] (as when Google revealed an anonymous blogger's identity&lt;ref&gt;Declan McCullagh (2007). [http://www.news.com/8301-13578_3-9824638-38.html Google: We had no choice in Israel ID request]. CNET News.com article, retrieved 2008-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;). Anonymous networks provide a better degree of anonymity. Flogs (anonymous blogs) in Freenet, [[Syndie]] and other blogging tools in [[I2P]] and [[Osiris (Serverless Portal System)|Osiris sps]] are some examples of anonymous blogging technologies.

One argument for anonymous blogging is a delicate nature of work situation. Sometimes a blogger writing under their real name faces a choice between either staying silent or causing a harm to themselves, their colleagues or the company they work for.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Vallicella (2004). [http://maverickphilosopher.blogspot.com/2004/07/reasons-for-anonyblogging.html Reasons for 'Anonyblogging']. Maverick Philosopher blog, retrieved 2008-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another reason is risk of lawsuits. Some bloggers have faced multimillion-dollar lawsuits&lt;ref&gt;Media Bloggers Association (2006). [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630182947/http://www.mediabloggers.org/mba-news/mba-member-hit-with-multi-million-dollar-federal-lawsuit MBA Member Hit With Multi-Million Dollar Federal Lawsuit]. Retrieved 2008-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt; (although they were later dropped completely&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press (2006). [http://www.boston.com/news/local/maine/articles/2006/05/06/ad_agency_drops_lawsuit_against_maine_blogger/ Ad agency drops lawsuit against Maine blogger]. Retrieved 2008-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;); anonymous blogging provides protection against such risks.

====Censorship via Internet domain names====
On the non-anonymous Internet, a [[domain name]] like "[[example.com]]" is a key to accessing information. The censorship of the Wikileaks website&lt;ref&gt;[https://wikileaks.org/wiki/WIKILEAKS.INFO_censored_by_eNom_and_Demand_Media WIKILEAKS.INFO censored by eNom and Demand Media]. Retrieved 2008-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt; shows that domain names are extremely vulnerable to censorship. Some domain registrars have suspended customers' domain names even in the absence of a court order.

For the affected customer, blocking of a domain name is a far bigger problem than a registrar refusing to provide a service; typically, the registrar keeps full control of the domain names in question. In the case of a European travel agency, more than 80 .com websites were shut down without any court process and held by the registrar since then. The travel agency had to rebuild the sites under the .net [[top-level domain]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;Adam Liptak (2008). [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/us/04bar.html A Wave of the Watch List, and Speech Disappears]. ''The New York Times'', 2008-03-04. Retrieved 2008-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, anonymous networks do not rely on [[domain name registrar]]s. For example, Freenet, [[I2P]] and Tor hidden services implement censorship-resistant URLs based on [[public-key cryptography]]: only a person having the correct private key can update the URL or take it down.

===Control over online tracking===
Anonymous P2P also has value in normal daily communication. When communication is anonymous, the decision to reveal the identities of the communicating parties is left up to the parties involved and is not available to a third party. Often there is no need or desire by the communicating parties to reveal their identities. As a matter of personal freedom, many people do not want processes in place by default which supply unnecessary data. In some cases, such data could be compiled into histories of their activities.

For example, most current phone systems transmit caller ID information by default to the called party (although this can be disabled either for a single call or for all calls). If a person calls to make an inquiry about a product or the time of a movie, the party called has a record of the calling phone number, and may be able to obtain the name, address and other information about the caller. This information is not available about someone who walks into a store and makes a similar inquiry.

===Effects of surveillance on lawful activity===
Online surveillance, such as recording and retaining details of web and e-mail traffic, may have effects on lawful activities.&lt;ref name="chilling"&gt;Dawinder S. Sidhu (2007). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1002145 The chilling effect of government surveillance programs on the use of the internet by Muslim-Americans]. University of Maryland Law Journal of Race, Religion, Gender and Class.&lt;/ref&gt; People may be deterred from accessing or communicating legal information because they know of possible surveillance and believe that such communication may be seen as suspicious. According to law professor [[Daniel J. Solove]], such effects "harm society because, among other things, they reduce the range of viewpoints being expressed and the degree of freedom with which to engage in political activity."&lt;ref name="solove1"&gt;Daniel J. Solove (2006). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565 "I've got nothing to hide" and other misunderstandings of privacy]. San Diego Law Review, Vol. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Access to censored and copyrighted material===
Most countries ban or censor the publication of certain [[List of books banned by governments|books]] and [[Banned films|movies]], and certain types of content. Other material is legal to possess but not to distribute; for example, copyright and [[software patent]] laws may forbid its distribution. These laws are difficult or impossible to enforce in anonymous P2P networks.

===Anonymous online money===
With [[anonymous money]], it becomes possible to arrange anonymous markets where one can buy and sell just about anything anonymously. Anonymous money could be used to avoid [[tax]] collection. However, any transfer of physical goods between two parties could compromise anonymity.&lt;ref name="cymru"&gt;Rob Thomas, Jerry Martin (2006). [http://www.usenix.org/publications/login/2006-12/openpdfs/cymru.pdf The underground economy: priceless]. Retrieved 2008-01-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{Who|date=April 2010}} argue that conventional [[cash]] provides a similar kind of anonymity, and that existing laws are adequate to combat crimes like [[tax evasion]] that might result from the use of anonymous cash, whether online or offline{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

==Functioning of anonymous P2P==

===Anonymity and pseudonymity===
Some of the networks commonly referred to as "anonymous P2P" are truly anonymous, in the sense that network nodes carry no identifiers. Others are actually pseudonymous: instead of being identified by their IP addresses, nodes are identified by pseudonyms such as cryptographic keys. For example, each node in the [[MUTE]] network has an overlay address that is derived from its public key. This overlay address functions as a pseudonym for the node, allowing messages to be addressed to it. In Freenet, on the other hand, messages are routed using keys that identify specific pieces of data rather than specific nodes; the nodes themselves are anonymous.

The term ''anonymous'' is used to describe both kinds of network because it is difficult—if not impossible—to determine whether a node that sends a message originated the message or is simply forwarding it on behalf of another node. Every node in an anonymous P2P network acts as a universal sender and universal receiver to maintain anonymity. If a node was only a receiver and did not send, then neighbouring nodes would know that the information it was requesting was for itself only, removing any [[plausible deniability]] that it was the recipient (and consumer) of the information. Thus, in order to remain anonymous, nodes must ferry information for others on the network.

===Spam and DoS attacks in anonymous networks===
Originally, anonymous networks were operated by small and friendly communities of developers. As interest in anonymous P2P increased and the user base grew, malicious users inevitably appeared and tried different attacks. This is similar to the Internet, where widespread use has been followed by waves of [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] and distributed DoS ([[denial-of-service attack|Denial of Service]]) attacks. Such attacks may require different solutions in anonymous networks. For example, blacklisting of originator network addresses does not work because anonymous networks conceal this information. These networks are more vulnerable to DoS attacks as well due to the smaller bandwidth, as has been shown in examples on the Tor network.

A conspiracy to attack an anonymous network could be considered criminal computer hacking, though the nature of the network makes this impossible to prosecute without compromising the anonymity of data in the network.

==Opennet and darknet network types==
{{Main|Friend-to-friend}}
Like conventional P2P networks, anonymous P2P networks can implement either opennet or [[darknet]] (often named friend-to-friend) network type. This describes how a node on the network selects peer nodes:

* In opennet network, peer nodes are discovered automatically. There is no configuration required but little control available over which nodes become peers.
* In a darknet network, users manually establish connections with nodes run by people they know. Darknet typically needs more effort to set up but a node only has trusted nodes as peers.

Some networks like Freenet support both network types simultaneously (a node can have some manually added darknet peer nodes and some automatically selected opennet peers) .

In a friend-to-friend (or F2F) network, users only make direct connections with people they know. Many F2F networks support indirect anonymous or pseudonymous communication between users who do not know or trust one another. For example, a node in a friend-to-friend overlay can automatically forward a file (or a request for a file) anonymously between two "friends", without telling either of them the other's name or IP address. These "friends" can in turn forward the same file (or request) to their own "friends", and so on. Users in a friend-to-friend network cannot find out who else is participating beyond their own circle of friends, so F2F networks can grow in size without compromising their users' anonymity.

Some friend-to-friend networks allow the user to control what kind of files can be exchanged with "friends" within the node, in order to stop them from exchanging files that user disapproves of.

Advantages and disadvantages of opennet compared to darknet are disputed, see friend-to-friend article for summary.

===Private P2P clients===
[[Private P2P]] networks are P2P networks that only allow some mutually trusted computers to share files. This can be achieved by using a central server or [[Direct Connect (file sharing)#Hubs|hub]] to authenticate clients, in which case the functionality is similar to a private [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] server, but with files transferred directly between the clients. Alternatively, users can exchange passwords or keys with their friends to form a decentralized network.

===Private F2F (friend-to-friend) clients===
[[Friend-to-friend]] networks are P2P networks that allows users only to make direct connections with people they know. Passwords or digital signatures can be used for authentication.

Examples include :
* [[Retroshare]] - filesharing, serverless email, instant messaging, VoIP, chatrooms, and decentralized forums.
* [[OneSwarm]] - a backwards compatible BitTorrent client with privacy-preserving sharing options, aims to create a large F2F network.

===Hypothetical or defunct networks===

====Hypothetical====
The following networks only exist as design or are in development
* [[anoNet]] - extensible IP anonymizer with steganography support (in development)
* [[Crowds]] - Reiter and Rubin's system for "blending into a crowd" has a known attack
* [[P2PRIV]] - Peer-to-Peer diRect and anonymous dIstribution oVerlay - anonymity via virtual links parallelization - currently in development and has significant, unsolved problems in a real world environment
* Phantom Anonymity Protocol - a fully decentralized high-throughput anonymization network (no longer in development)&lt;ref&gt;https://code.google.com/p/phantom/&lt;/ref&gt;{{third-party inline|date=March 2016}}

* Invisible IRC Project - anonymous [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], inspired by [[Freenet]], which later became [[I2P]] (Invisible Internet Project).
* [[Mnet (Computer program)|Mnet]] (formerly MojoNation) - a [[distributed file system]]

===Anonymous P2P in a wireless mesh network===
It is possible to implement anonymous P2P on a [[wireless mesh network]]; unlike fixed Internet connections, users don't need to sign up with an ISP to participate in such a network, and are only identifiable through their hardware.

Protocols for [[wireless mesh network]]s are [[Optimized Link State Routing Protocol]] (OLSR) and the follow-up protocol [[B.A.T.M.A.N.]], which is designed for decentralized auto-IP assignment. See also Netsukuku.

Even if a government were to outlaw the use of wireless P2P software, it would be difficult to enforce such a ban without a considerable infringement of personal freedoms. Alternatively, the government could outlaw the purchase of the wireless hardware itself.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

There are two main types of '''[[appeal]] in South African law''':

# appeals from lower courts of law to higher [[Courts of South Africa|courts of law]]; and
# administrative appeals.

The latter falls squarely within the province of [[administrative law]]. These internal or domestic remedies are an important adjunct to [[judicial review in South African law|judicial review]], which is a type of external check on the [[Public administration|administration]], but there can be a blurring of these internal and external safeguards, in that courts of law may be and sometimes are entrusted with the merits in their system. While administrative appeals normally lie from one administrative agency to another, they may lie to specialized [http://courts%20of%20law courts of law] and even to ordinary courts of law.

The '''Blue Eyed Six''' were a group of six men, all of them coincidentally blue-eyed, who were arrested and indicted on first degree [[murder]] charges in [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon County]], [[Pennsylvania]], in 1879.&lt;ref name="LDN"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stump|first1=Douglas|title=Revisiting the 'Blue-Eyed Six'|url=http://www.ldnews.com/story/life/2015/09/11/revisiting-blue-eyed-six/73569302/|accessdate=January 11, 2018|publisher=Lebanon Daily News|date=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Six were Charles Drews, Frank Stichler,    Henry F. Wise, Josiah Hummel, Israel Brandt and George Zechman. This group of friends and unsavory business associates conspired to murder their neighbor, Joseph Raber, for an insurance pay-off. Raber, age 65, lived in poverty with his housekeeper in a charcoal burner's hut in the [[Blue Mountain (Pennsylvania)|Blue Mountain]] area of northern Lebanon County. Raber had no steady employment and depended mainly on the charity of his equally impoverished neighbors.

In early July 1878, four of the conspirators met at Brandt's hotel at St. Joseph Spring and agreed to insure Raber for a total of $8,000. The men told the insurance agent that they had agreed to take care of Raber for the rest of his life and wanted the policy to cover his eventual burial expenses. Several assessment-type life insurance policies were sold on Joseph Raber, with his cooperation, with the men named as the [[beneficiary|beneficiaries]].

Later that year they enlisted two other men to drown Raber in Indiantown Creek. Without any evidence to the contrary, the [[coroner]] ruled the death accidental. Although the local citizenry suspected foul play, it wasn't until two months later, when Drews' son-in-law Joseph Peters reported to the [[constable]] that he was an eye-witness to the murder, that the six men were arrested and held over for trial.

==Trial==
In a highly unusual move, the Six were tried together. Due to this and, perhaps, to the fanciful nickname that the conspirators were given by the newspapers, the trial gained more than its share of attention. Reporters from throughout the east coast descended on the city of [[Lebanon, Pennsylvania|Lebanon]], the county seat of Lebanon County, and the story was carried worldwide. The trial began on 18 April. The Commonwealth's main witness was Drews' son-in-law, but he was only one of thirty-six witnesses called by the [[prosecutor|prosecution]].

The [[defense (legal)|defense]] called twenty-two witnesses. The witnesses on both sides were mainly friends, neighbors, and family members who contradicted each other at every turn. It became evident that there were many people who knew of, or suspected, the plot before and after Raber's death, but who did not come forward for fear of mortal retaliation. At 3:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. on 24 April 1879, the fate of the Blue Eyed Six was left in the hands of the twelve men of the [[jury]].

The wait was not long. Five hours later the courthouse bell rang out, announcing that they had reached their verdicts. The jury returned verdicts of guilty of first degree murder for all six of the defendants. Defense requested that the jury be polled, and so the word "Guilty" was uttered seventy-two times, once for each defendant from each juror.

The local newspaper noted that it was the first time in the recorded history of [[common law]] of the United States and England that six people were convicted of murder on a single indictment. On appeal, the judge awarded Zechman a new trial, based on the lack of direct evidence presented by the Commonwealth against him personally. He was acquitted in his second trial on essentially the same evidence. The other five defendants were sentenced to death by [[hanging]].

Drews and Stichler, who had committed the crime, were hanged first. After all other appeals were exhausted, the accomplices Wise, Hummel, and Brandt were hanged the following year. The acquitted Zechman died of natural causes within the decade. Apart from the actual murder trial, the whole proceeding turned out to be an indictment of the murky business of assessment life insurance, which led to major changes in insurance law, particularly with regard to the practice of insuring people in whom one had no legal interest.

==Misconceptions==
The Blue Eyed Six are sometimes reported to have been hanged and to be buried in the cemetery at Moonshine United Zion Church (Moonshine is the name of the family who donated the land the church and cemetery occupy) near the village of Green Point at Indiantown Gap, near the site of the murder. In actuality, the hangings all took place at the county prison in Lebanon. Although Joseph Raber, the victim, is buried at Moonshine Church, the six conspirators were all buried separately by their families elsewhere in the county.

Brandt and Drews are buried side by side in the veteran's section of Mt. Lebanon Cemetery in Lebanon. Hummel and Zechman are buried at Sattazahn Lutheran Church cemetery in Union Township, Lebanon County. Wise is buried at Evangelical United Brethren Church cemetery in the village of Green Point, Union Township, Lebanon County. Stichler is buried in the family plot on McLean Road, now within the bounds of Ft. Indiantown Gap.

Hummel was hanged May 13, 1880, along with Wise and Brandt. Zechman was acquitted and therefore escaped hanging. He was released from prison and died in 1887.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4084">[[File:Carwalking.jpg|right|290px|thumb|Carwalking]]
'''Carwalking''' is the act of stepping onto and [[walking]] across a stationary [[car]]. Depending on the technique and equipment used, carwalking can lead to [[Property damage|damage of private property]]. Carwalking is a [[protest]] against the negative impacts of high [[List of countries by vehicles per capita|motorization rates]] in urban areas. It often is a response to cars being [[parking violation|parked illegally]] in areas exclusively allocated to [[pedestrian]]s.

==Reported cases==

===Germany===
The most famous carwalker was Michael Hartmann&lt;ref name=MH&gt;[[:de:Carwalking]]&lt;/ref&gt; who performed the act in [[Munich]], Germany, in the 1980s. The peak of automobile friendly policies was around the seventies and the eighties in the western world, and such high number of motor vehicles in urban areas had as consequence a large number of cars illegally parked on side-walks and other pedestrian-reserved areas. Hartmann, in his book which describes his actions, states that once in 1988 he was walking with his girlfriend and due to many cars parked on the side-walk, they had to continuously [[zigzag]] between the cars so he decided to walk straightforward above the cars.&lt;ref name=MH /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projektwerkstatt.de/pwerk/weilburg/nanu/nanu396/carwal.htm|title=Carwalking - Der Mensch steht über dem Auto|website=projektwerkstatt.de|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
An initiative in [[Kings Heath]] ([[Birmingham]]) (Twitter: @pavements4ppl) distributes poster that warn drivers their cars will be "bonneted" if parked on pavement obstructing pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://twitter.com/pavements4ppl/media&lt;/ref&gt; 

===France===
Another reported case happened in [[Lyon]], France, in 2011 when Peter Wagner, a German engineer, decided to walk on top of a car that was illegally parked on the side-walk in such a manner that he could not squeeze past. At that moment the owner of the car arrived and later sued him for property damage, demanding 800 Euros for repairs. The carwalker was condemned to pay 300 Euros, but later appealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lyonmag.com/article/45364/une-affaire-de-car-walking-jugee-a-lyon|title=Une affaire de "car walking" jugée à Lyon|publisher=LyonMag| date=November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His appeal was denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L’homme qui marchait sur les voitures condamné en appel|url=http://www.leprogres.fr/faits-divers/2012/12/12/l-homme-qui-marchait-sur-les-voitures-condamne-en-appel|publisher=Le Progrés}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In [[Mexico City]], a pedestrian activist called Peatónito, a mix of the Spanish words for pedestrian(''peatón'') and astonished(''atónito''), is famous for walking over cars. He wears a Mexican wrestler mask, a cape and proclaims himself to be a superhero for pedestrians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-latin-america-22369377/meet-peatonito-mexico-city-s-masked-defender-of-pedestrian-rights|title=Mexico's defender of pedestrian rights|date=2 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.univision.com/noticias/noticias-de-mexico/peatonito-el-heroe-contra-la-pesadilla-vial-de-la-ciudad-de-mexico|title=Peatónito: el héroe de Ciudad de México|website=univision.com|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://actualidad.rt.com/sociedad/181125-peatonito-heroe-enmascarado-lucha-calles-mexico|title=Peatonito, el superhéroe enmascarado que lucha ferozmente por los peatones en México|website=rt.com|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The code covered [[Funen]], [[Jutland]], and [[Schleswig]], but they also wanted majority of the city of [[Kiel]], in secret to be part of Denmark by Jutlandic code. Prior to the adoption of the ''Jutlandic'', [[Zealandic Law|Zealandic]] and the [[Scanian Law|Scanian]] laws, there had been no uniformity of laws throughout settlements in Denmark. The difficulties in governing that arose from this led to the adoption of these three regional laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lauring |first=Palle |title=A History of Denmark |date=1986 |publisher=Høst &amp; Sons Forlag |page=89 |isbn=87-14-28695-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The king did not sign it in Jutland, but rather at the royal castle at [[Vordingborg_Castle|Vordingborg]] in early 1241.

{{cquote|With law shall the country be built but if all men were content with what is theirs and let others enjoy the same right, there would be no need for a law. But no law is as good as the truth, but if one wonders what the truth is, then shall the law show the truth. If the land had no law, then he would have the most who could grab the most by force.}}

{{cquote|The law must be honest, just, reasonable and according to the ways of the people. It must meet their needs and speak plainly, so that all men may know and understand, what the law is. It is not to be made in any man's favor, but for the needs of all them who live in the land. No man shall judge contrary to the law, which the king has given and the country chosen. [...] neither shall he [the king] take it back without the will of the people.}}

The Code was succeeded by Christian V's [[Danish Code]] of 1683; however in certain parts of [[Schleswig]] parts of the Code were used until the arrival of [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] in 1900.

{{Conscription}}
A '''conscientious objector'''  is an "individual who has claimed the right to refuse to perform [[military service]]"&lt;ref&gt;On July 30, 2001, explicit clarification of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] Article 18 was made in the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] general comment 22, Para. 11: {{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/Issues/FreedomReligion/Pages/IstandardsI3k.aspx|title=Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.

In some countries, conscientious objectors are assigned to an alternative [[civilian service]] as a substitute for conscription or military service. Some conscientious objectors consider themselves [[pacifism|pacifist]], [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]], [[nonresistance|non-resistant]], [[non-aggression principle|non-aggressionist]], [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] or [[antimilitarist]].

On March 8, 1995, the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] resolution 1995/83 stated that "persons performing military service should not be excluded from the right to have conscientious objections to military service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,4565c22523,4565c25f2c9,3b00f0d220,0.html |title=UN Commission on Human Rights, Conscientious objection to military service., 8 March 1995, E/CN.4/RES/1995/83 (See point #2)|author=UN Commission on Human Rights |date=March 8, 1995 |work=|publisher=UN Commission on Human Rights |accessdate=2009-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was re-affirmed in 1998, when resolution 1998/77 recognized that "persons [already] performing military service may ''develop'' conscientious objections."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/0/5bc5759a53f36ab380256671004b643a?Opendocument|title= Conscientious objection to military service; Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77; see preamble "Aware..."|author= United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|date=April 22, 1998|work=|publisher= United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=2009-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/refworld/rwmain?page=search&amp;amp;docid=3b00f0be10&amp;amp;skip=0&amp;amp;query=1998/77|title=Conscientious objection to military service; E/CN.4/RES/1998/77; See introductory paragraph|date=April 22, 1998|publisher=UN Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ap.ohchr.org/documents/sdpage_e.aspx?b=1&amp;se=10&amp;t=11|title= Conscientious objection to military service, Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/77, Navigation to document: press "next" four times, see bottom listing, and at the right choose letter for language ("E" for English) Document:  CHR 54th 4/22/1998E/CN.4/RES/1998/77 |year=1998|publisher= United Nations Human Rights, Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights| accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D.

==History==
Many conscientious objectors have been executed, imprisoned, or otherwise penalized when their beliefs led to actions conflicting with their society's legal system or government. The legal definition and status of conscientious objection has varied over the years and from nation to nation. Religious beliefs were a starting point in many nations for legally granting conscientious objector status.

The first recorded conscientious objector, [[Maximilian of Tebessa|Maximilianus]], was conscripted into the Roman army in the year 295, but "told the Proconsul in Numidia that because of his religious convictions he could not serve in the military." He was executed for this, and was later canonized as Saint Maximilian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Publications/ConscientiousObjection_en.pdf |title=Conscientious objection to military service |author=The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early recognition of conscientious objection was granted by [[William the Silent]] to the Dutch [[Mennonite]]s in 1575. They could refuse military service in exchange for a monetary payment.&lt;ref name="co"&gt;Robert Paul Churchill, "Conscientious Objection", in Donald K. Wells,
''An Encyclopedia of War and Ethics''. Greenwood Press 1996. {{ISBN|0313291160}} (p.99- 102).&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal legislation to exempt objectors from fighting was first granted in mid-18th century [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] following problems with attempting to force [[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] into military service. In 1757, when the first attempt was made to establish a [[Militia (Great Britain)|British Militia]] as a professional national military reserve, a clause in the Militia Ballot Act allowed Quakers exemption from military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.quakersintheworld.org/quakers-in-action/171|title=Conscientious Objection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], conscientious objection was permitted from the country's founding, although regulation was left to individual states prior to the introduction of [[conscription]].&lt;ref name="co" /&gt;

==International law==

===Universal Declaration of Human Rights===
In 1948, the issue of the right to "conscience" was dealt with by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. It reads:

{{Quote|Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.}}

The proclamation was [[ratified]] during the General Assembly on 10 December 1948 by a vote of 48 in favour, 0 against, with 8 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.unac.org/rights/question.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912162219/http://www.unac.org/rights/question.html |archivedate=2012-09-12 |df= }} under "Who are the signatories of the Declaration?"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|"I ain't got no quarrel with them [[Viet Cong]] ... They never called me [[nigger]]."&amp;nbsp;– [[Muhammad Ali]], 1966]]
In 1974, the Assistant [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Sean MacBride]] said, in his Nobel Lecture, "To the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights one more might, with relevance, be added. It is ' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights#"The Right to Refuse to Kill"|The Right to Refuse to Kill]].'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1974/macbride-lecture.html|title= The Imperatives of Survival|year=1974|publisher=Nobel Foundation|accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the United Nations [[treaty]] the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] [[coming into force|entered into force]]. It was based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and was originally created in 1966. Nations that have signed this treaty are bound by it. Its Article 18 begins: "Everyone shall have the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. ..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights |accessdate=2008-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705115024/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/ccpr.htm |archivedate=2008-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights left the issue of conscientious objection inexplicit, as we see in this quote from [[War Resisters International]]: "Article 18 of the Covenant does put some limits on the right [to freedom of thought, conscience and religion], stating that [its] manifestations must not infringe on public safety, order, health or morals. Some states argue that such limitations [on the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion] would [derivatively] permit them to make conscientious objection during time of war a threat to public safety, or mass conscientious objection a disruption to public order,...[Some states] even [argue] that it is a 'moral' duty to serve the state in its military."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wri-irg.org/books/co-guide-un.htm|title=A Conscientious Objector's Guide to the UN Human Rights System|publisher=War Resisters International|accessdate=2008-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 1993, explicit clarification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights Article 18 was made in the United Nations [[Human Rights Committee]] general comment 22, Paragraph 11: "The Covenant does not explicitly refer to a right to conscientious objection, but the Committee believes that such a right can be derived from article 18, inasmuch as the obligation to use lethal force may seriously conflict with the freedom of conscience and the right to manifest one's religion or belief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/religion/I3k.htm|title=Special Rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief.

In 1997, an announcement of [[Amnesty International]]'s forthcoming campaign and briefing for the [[UN Commission on Human Rights]] included this quote: "The right to conscientious objection to military service is not a marginal concern outside the mainstream of international human rights protection and promotion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur01/004/1997/en/ |title=Out of /http://asiapacific.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGEUR010041997?open&amp;of=ENG-2EU |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the Human Rights Commission reiterated previous statements and added "states should . . . refrain from subjecting conscientious objectors . . . to repeated punishment for failure to perform military service."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3b00f0be10.html|title=Conscientious objection to military service; E/CN.4/RES/1998/77; See Point #5|date=April 22, 1998|publisher=UN Commission on Human Rights|accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also encouraged states "to consider granting asylum to those conscientious objectors compelled to leave their country of origin because they fear persecution owing to their refusal to perform military service . . . ."&lt;ref name="D.

===Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status===
The Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (the Handbook) of the Office of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;171. Not every conviction, genuine though it may be, will constitute a sufficient reason for claiming [[refugee]] status after [[desertion]] or draft-evasion. It is not enough for a person to be in disagreement with his government regarding the political justification for a particular military action. Where, however, the type of military action, with which an individual does not wish to be associated, is condemned by the [[international community]] as contrary to basic rules of human conduct, punishment for desertion or draft-evasion could, in the light of all other requirements of the definition, in itself be regarded as persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/publ/PUBL/3d58e13b4.pdf Source: Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Selective conscientious objection==
[[Air Commodore]] [[Lionel Charlton]], of the British Royal Air Force (RAF), served in the military from 1898 to 1928. In 1923 he ''selectively'' refused to serve in the [[RAF Iraq Command]]. (He later went on to serve as [[Air Officer Commanding]] [[No. 3 Group RAF|No 3 Group]].)&lt;ref&gt;[[Sven Lindqvist]], "A History of Bombing" (''Nu dog du: bombernas århundrade''), 1999, relevant quotation at [http://www.columbia.edu/~lnp3/mydocs/culture/lawrence.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1967, [[John Courtney Murray]], an American [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] and theologian, delivered an address at [[Western Maryland College]] concerning a more specific type of conscientious objection: "the issue of selective conscientious objection, conscientious objection to particular wars, or as it is sometimes called, discretionary armed service."&lt;ref name="Murray"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://woodstock.georgetown.edu/library/Murray/1967L.htm|title = Selective Conscientious Objection; Editor Note: An address given at Western Maryland College, June 4, 1967.

On March 8, 1971, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in the case of ''[[Gillette v. United States]]'' that "the exemption for those who oppose "participation in war in any form" applies to those who oppose participating in all war and not to those who object to participation in a particular war only."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=401&amp;invol=437|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 25, 2005, journalist Jack Random wrote the following: "The case of Sergeant [[Kevin Benderman]] ([[List of Iraq War resisters|Iraq War Resister]]) raises the burning issue of selective conscientious objection: While it is universally accepted that an individual cannot be compelled against conscience to war in general, does the same hold for an individual who objects, in the depths of the soul, to a particular war?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Jack|last= Random|title= Just Say No: The Case for Selective Conscientious Objection|work= |page= |date= May 25, 2005|accessdate= 26 January 2009|quote= |url= http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/5-25-2005-70478.asp}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious motives==
{{main|List of pacifist faiths|Freedom of religion}}
Cases of behavior which could be considered as religiously motivated conscientious objection are historically attested long before the modern term appeared. For example, the Medieval ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'' mentions that [[Magnus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney]]&amp;nbsp;– the future Saint Magnus&amp;nbsp;– had a reputation for piety and gentleness, and because of his religious convictions refused to fight in a Viking raid on [[Anglesey]], [[Wales]], instead staying on board his ship singing [[psalm]]s.

The reasons for refusing to perform military service are varied. Many conscientious objectors cite religious reasons. [[Unitarian Universalists]] object to war in their sixth principle "The goal of world community with peace, liberty and justice for all". Members of the [[Peace Churches|Historic Peace Churches]] such as Quakers, Mennonites, [[Amish]], [[Old Order Mennonite]], [[Conservative Mennonites]], the [[Bruderhof Communities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gameo.org/index.php?title=Bruderhof_Communities|title=Bruderhof Communities - GAMEO|website=gameo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Church of the Brethren]] object to war from the conviction that [[Christian]] life is incompatible with military action, because [[Jesus]] enjoins his followers to love their enemies and to refuse violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the American Civil War, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] have been known as non-combatants, and have done work in hospitals or to give medical care rather than combat roles, and the church has upheld the non-combative position.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sidadventist.org/lead/index.php/resources/essent/89-leadership{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] and [[Christadelphians]], refuse to participate in the armed services on the grounds that they believe they should be neutral in worldly conflicts and often cite the latter portion of [http://bible.oremus.org/?passage=Isaiah+2:4%E2%80%932:4&amp;version=nrsv Isaiah 2:4] which states, "...neither shall they learn war anymore." Other objections can stem from a deep sense of responsibility toward humanity as a whole, or from simple denial that any government possesses the [[moral authority]] to command warlike behavior from its citizens.

The varied experiences of non-combatants are illustrated by those of Seventh-day Adventists when there was mandatory military service:  "Many Seventh-day Adventists refuse to enter the army as combatants, but participate as medics, ambulance drivers, etc. During World War II in Germany, many SDA conscientious objectors were sent to concentration camps or mental institutions; some were executed. Some Seventh-day Adventists volunteered for the US Army's [[Operation Whitecoat]], participating in research to help others. The Church preferred to call them "conscientious participants", because they were willing to risk their lives as test subjects in potentially life-threatening research. Over 2,200 Seventh-day Adventists volunteered in experiments involving various infectious agents during the 1950s through the 1970s in Fort Detrick, MD. "&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/sda3.htm "The Seventh-day Adventist Church: Controversies, books and other resources"],''religioustolerance.org,''Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance.&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier, a [[Schism (religion)|schism]] arose during and after World War I between Seventh-day Adventists in Germany who agreed to serve in the military if conscripted and those who rejected all participation in warfare&amp;nbsp;— the latter group eventually forming a separate church (the [[Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdarm.org/origin.htm "Origin of the Seventh Day Adventist Reform Movement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815073949/http://www.sdarm.org/origin.htm |date=2010-08-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Blessed are the Peacemakers.gif|alt=|thumb|''Blessed are the Peacemakers'' (1917) by [[George Bellows]].]]
In the [[early Christian Church]] followers of [[Christ]] refused to take up arms.

{{quote|In as much as they [Jesus' teachings] ruled out as illicit all use of violence and injury against others, clearly implied [was] the illegitimacy of participation in war... The early Christians took Jesus at his word, and understood his inculcations of gentleness and non-resistance in their literal sense. They closely identified their religion with peace; they strongly condemned war for the bloodshed which it involved.|{{cite book|title=The Early Christian Attitude to War}}}}

After the [[Roman Empire]] officially embraced [[Christianity]], the [[Just War]] theology was developed in order to reconcile warfare with Christian belief. After Theodosius I made Christianity an official religion of the Empire, this position slowly developed into the official position of the Western Church. In the 11th century, there was a further shift of opinion in the Latin-Christian tradition with the [[crusade]]s, strengthening the idea and acceptability of [[religious war|Holy War]]. Objectors became a minority. Some theologians see the [[Constantinian shift]] and the loss of  [[Christian pacifism]] as a great failing of the Church.

[[Ben Salmon]] was a Catholic conscientious objector during World War I and outspoken critic of Just War theology. The Catholic Church denounced him and ''The New York Times'' described him as a "spy suspect." The US military (in which he was never inducted) charged him with desertion and spreading propaganda, then sentenced him to death (this was later revised to 25 years hard labor).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Staff of the Catholic Peace Fellowship| year= 2007| title=The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon| journal = Sign of Peace | volume = 6.1| issue = Spring 2007| pages =| id =| url =http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/nextpage.asp?m=2524}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 5, 1917, Salmon wrote in a letter to President Wilson:

{{quote|Regardless of nationality, all men are brothers. God is "our Father who art in heaven." The commandment "Thou shalt not kill" is unconditional and inexorable. ... The lowly Nazarene taught us the doctrine of non-resistance, and so convinced was he of the soundness of that doctrine that he sealed his belief with death on the cross. When human law conflicts with Divine law, my duty is clear. Conscience, my infallible guide, impels me to tell you that prison, death, or both, are infinitely preferable to joining any branch of the Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Unsung Hero of the Great War: The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon|year=1989|author=Torin Finney|pages= 118 and 119}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of their conscientious objection to participation in military service, whether armed or unarmed, Jehovah's Witnesses have often faced imprisonment or other penalties. In [[Greece]], for example, before the introduction of alternative civilian service in 1997, hundreds of Witnesses were imprisoned, some for three years or even more for their refusal. In [[Armenia]], young Jehovah's Witnesses were imprisoned because of their conscientious objection to military service; this was discontinued in November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jw.org/en/news/by-region/europe/armenia/armenia-releases-imprisoned-jehovahs-witnesses/ Armenia Releases All Imprisoned Jehovah's Witnesses].&lt;/ref&gt; The government of South Korea also imprisons hundreds for refusing the draft. In [[Switzerland]], virtually every Jehovah's Witness is exempted from military service. The [[Finland|Finnish]] government exempts Jehovah's Witnesses from the draft completely.

For believers in [[Indian religions]], the opposition to warfare may be based on either the general idea of [[ahimsa]], [[nonviolence]], or on an explicit prohibition of violence by their religion, e.g., for a [[Buddhist]], one of the [[five precepts]] is "Pānātipātā veramaṇi sikkhāpadam samādiyāmi," or "I undertake the precept to refrain from destroying living creatures," which is in obvious opposition to the practice of warfare. The [[14th Dalai Lama]] has stated that war "should be relegated to the dustbin of history." On the other hand, many Buddhist sects, especially in Japan, have been thoroughly militarized, warrior monks (''yamabushi'' or ''[[sōhei]]'') participating in the civil wars. Hindu beliefs do not go against the concept of war, as seen in the [[Gita]]. Both Sikhs and Hindus believe war should be a last resort and should be fought to sustain life and morality in society.

[[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] are advised to do social service instead of active army service, but when this is not possible because of obligations in certain countries, the [[Bahá'í laws|Bahá'í law]] of ''loyalty to one's government'' is preferred and the individual should perform the army service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&amp;chapter=1 | title = Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Bahá'í Faith | accessdate = 13 September 2006 | first = Peter |last = Mazal | date = 21 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ud1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/UD/ud-136.html | first = Shoghi | last = Effendi |authorlink = Shoghi Effendi|title = Unfolding Destiny|pages = 134–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some practitioners of [[paganism|pagan religions]], particularly [[Wicca]], may object on the grounds of the [[Wiccan rede]], which states "An it harm none, do what ye will" (or variations). The [[threefold law]] may also be grounds for objection.

A notable example of a conscientious objector was the [[Austrians|Austrian]] devout [[Roman Catholic]] Christian [[Franz Jägerstätter]], who was executed on August 9, 1943 for openly refusing to serve in the Nazi [[Wehrmacht]], consciously accepting the penalty of death. He was [[Beatification|declared Blessed]] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2007 for dying for his beliefs, and is viewed as a symbol of self-sacrificing resistance.

==Alternatives for objectors==
Some conscientious objectors are unwilling to serve the military in any capacity, while others accept noncombatant roles. While conscientious objection is usually the refusal to collaborate with military organizations, as a combatant in war or in any supportive role, some advocate compromising forms of conscientious objection. One compromising form is to accept [[non-combatant]] roles during conscription or [[military service]]. Alternatives to military or civilian service include serving an imprisonment or other punishment for refusing conscription, falsely claiming unfitness for duty by feigning an allergy or a heart condition, delaying conscription until the maximum drafting age, or seeking refuge in a country which does not extradite those wanted for military conscription. Avoiding military service is sometimes labeled [[draft dodger|draft dodging]], particularly if the goal is accomplished through dishonesty or evasive maneuvers. However, many people who support conscription will distinguish between "[[bona fide]]" ''conscientious objection'' and ''draft dodging'', which they view as evasion of military service without a valid excuse.

Conservative Mennonites do not object to serving their country in peaceful alternatives ([[alternative service]]) such as hospital work, farming, forestry, road construction and similar occupations. Their objection is in being part in any military capacity whether noncombatant or regular service. During World War II and the Korean, Vietnam war eras they served in many such capacities in alternative I-W service programs initially through the Mennonite Central Committee and now through their own alternatives.

Despite the fact that international institutions such as the United Nations (UN) and the [[Council of Europe]] (CoE) regard and promote conscientious objection as a human right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/jilp/issues/33/pdf/33n.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122030613/http://www1.law.nyu.edu/journals/jilp/issues/33/pdf/33n.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 November 2011 |title=THE STATUS OF CONSCIENTIOUS OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE EUROPEAN CONVENTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS, 33 N.Y.U.

Among the roughly one-hundred countries that have conscription, only thirty countries have some legal provisions, 25 of them in Europe. In Europe, most countries with conscription more or less fulfill international guidelines on conscientious objection legislation (except for [[Conscription in Greece|Greece]], [[Conscription in Cyprus|Cyprus]], [[Conscription in Turkey|Turkey]], [[Conscription in Finland|Finland]] and [[Conscription in Russia|Russia]]) today. In many countries outside Europe, especially in armed conflict areas (e.g. [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), conscientious objection is punished severely.

While conscientious objectors used to be seen as deserters, traitors, cowards, slackers or simply un-patriotic, their image has changed drastically in the Western world in past decades.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Especially in Europe, where objectors usually serve an alternative civilian service, they are regarded as making an equally important contribution to society as conscripts.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Parallel to that, the number of objectors has risen significantly, too:{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} e.g., in [[Germany]], where conscientious objection is a constitutional right, from less than one percent of all eligible men to more than fifty percent in 2003.  In 1991, The Peace Abbey established the National Registry for Conscientious Objection where people can publicly state their refusal to participate in armed conflict.

==Conscientious objection around the world==

===Belgium===
Conscription was mandatory to all able-bodied [[Belgium|Belgian]] males until 1994, when it was suspended. Civilian service was possible since 1963. Objectors could apply for the status of conscience objector. When granted, they did an alternative service with the civil service or with a socio-cultural organisation. The former would last 1.5 times as long as the shortest military service, the latter twice as long.

After their service, objectors are not allowed to take jobs that require them to carry weapons, such as police jobs, until the age of 42.

Since conscription was suspended in 1994 and military service is voluntary, the status of conscience objector can not be granted anymore in Belgium.

===Canada===
{{see also|Canada and Iraq War resisters|War Resisters Support Campaign}}

Mennonites and other similar peace churches in Canada were automatically exempt from any type of service during [[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canada's involvement in World War I]] by provisions of the [[Order in Council]] of 1873 yet initially, many were imprisoned until the matter was again resettled. With pressure of public opinion, the Canadian government barred entry of additional [[Mennonite]] and [[Hutterite]] immigrants, rescinding the privileges of the Order in Council.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 321. The [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]] also barred immigrants and objectors from voting.

This bar on entry was overturned in the 1920s, allowing immigrants to escape Soviet repression.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Military history of Canada during the Second World War|Canada's involvement in World War II]], Canadian conscientious objectors were given the options of noncombatant military service, serving in the medical or dental corps under military control or working in parks and on roads under civilian supervision. Over 95% chose the latter and were placed in Alternative Service camps.&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich p. 420.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Peter Dueck |author2=Conrad Stoesz |author3=Grant Klassen |author4=Lynette Wiebe |author5=Elsie Rempel |author6=Lawrence Klippenstein |author7=Alf Redekopp |author8=Dan Dyck |author9=John C.

After May 1943, as the labour shortage developed within the nation and another [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|Conscription Crisis]] burgeoned, men were shifted into agriculture, education and industry. The 10,700 Canadian objectors were mostly Mennonites (63%) and [[Doukhobor|Dukhobors]] (20%).&lt;ref&gt;Krahn, pp. 76–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colombia===
Conscientious objection is not recognised in Colombia, which has occasionally resulted of the detention and forced recruitment of those who refuse the draft. This is despite the fact that the Colombia constitutional court has ruled that conscientious objection is protected by the constitution in 2012. [https://www.wri-irg.org/en/programmes/world_survey/country_report/en/Colombia War Resisters' International's report on conscientious objection in Colombia] Before being ruled unconstitutional by the court as illegal in Sentence T-455/14, people were at risk of ''batidas'' - raids in the street and public spaces - where young people were rounded up and forcibly recruited if they could not prove they had already undergone military service.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===Czechoslovakia===
In [[Czechoslovakia]], those not willing to enter mandatory military service could avoid it by signing a contract for work lasting years in unattractive occupations, such as mining. Those who didn't sign were imprisoned. Both numbers were tiny. After the [[Velvet Revolution|communist party lost its power]] in 1989, alternative civil service was established. As of 2006, both the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] have abolished conscription.

===Denmark===
Any male getting drafted, but unwilling to serve, has the ability to avoid military service by instead serving community service for the duration of the conscription.

===Eritrea===
There is no right to conscientious objection to military service in Eritrea - which is of an indefinite length - and those who refuse the draft are imprisoned. Some Jehovah's Witness conscientious objectors have been in jail since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wri-irg.org/en/programmes/world_survey/reports/Eritrea&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
{{See also|Siviilipalvelus}}
Finland introduced conscription in 1881, but its enforcement was suspended in 1903 as part of [[Russification]]. During the [[Finnish Civil War]] in 1918, conscription was reintroduced for all able-bodied men. In 1922, the option of noncombatant military service was introduced, but service in the military remained compulsory on pain of imprisonment. After the struggle of pacifist [[Arndt Pekurinen]] a law was passed providing for a peacetime-only alternative to military service, or civilian service (Finnish ''siviilipalvelus''). The law was dubbed "Lex Pekurinen" after him. During the [[Winter War]], Pekurinen and other conscientious objectors were imprisoned, and Pekurinen was eventually executed at the front in 1941, during the [[Continuation War]].

After the war, a conscientious objector's civilian service lasted 16 months, whereas military service was 8 months at its shortest. To qualify for civilian service, an objector had to explain his conviction before a board of inspection that included military officers and clergymen. In 1987, the duration of the service was shortened to 13 months and the board of inspection was abolished. In 2008, the term was further shortened to 12 months to match the duration of the longest military service (that of officer trainees and technical crew). Today, a person subject to conscription may apply for civilian service at any time before or during his military service, and the application is accepted as a matter of course. A female performing voluntary military service can quit her service anytime during the first 45 days, however, if she wants to quit after those 45 days she would be treated like a male and assigned to civilian service.

Persons who have completed their civilian service during peacetime have, according to the legislation enacted in 2008, the right to serve in non-military duties also during a crisis situation. They may be called to serve in various duties with the rescue services or other necessary work of a non-military nature. Persons who declare themselves to be conscientious objectors only after a crisis has started must, however, prove their conviction before a special board. Before the new legislation, the right to conscientious objection was acknowledged only in peacetime. The changes to the service term and to the legal status of objectors during a crisis situation were made as a response to human rights concerns voiced by several international bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|title=Suomi syrjii aseistakieltäytyjiä! - AKL|website=aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CCPR.CO.82.FIN.En?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=unhchr.ch|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are overseeing the implementation of human rights agreements. These organisations had demanded Finland to take measures to improve its legislation concerning conscientious objectors, which they considered discriminatory. None of these organisations have yet raised concerns on the current legislation.

There are a small number of total objectors who refuse even civilian service, and are imprisoned for six months. This is not registered into the person's criminal record.
&lt;!---Text from [[Conscientious objection throughout the world]] - needs merging into existing text -
For many decades, the civilian service remained unpopular and difficult to choose. Refusing military service would have been very strongly discouraged by all state officials, and getting accepted as a conscientious objector required a trial by an examination board, whose judgement was often very harsh and strongly biased towards military service. These boards included army officers and clergy. A typical hypothetical presented to the examinee was "If a group of men threatened to beat your girlfriend up, would you try to stop them?".

The examinations were abolished in the 1980s, and today a conscientious objector is only required to check a box in the draft form and state whether his reasons are religious or ethical. Severe social stigma attachs to conscientious objection, and the military, which is responsible for the draft, does not advertise the option beyond their legal obligation to mention the option to draftees.

The civilian service of conscientious objectors lasts 395 days, over twice as long as the shortest and most common military service (180 days) and thirty days longer than the longest and mostly voluntary service (365 days).

The first four weeks of the civilian service are spent in training, which mostly consists of general-purpose lectures on various topics. The first three weeks of the training are held at the [[Lapinjärvi Educational Center]], and the fourth week is a free vacation.

In Finland today, the right to conscientious objection is still acknowledged only in peacetime. In recent years several international bodies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi/ihmisoikeuselimet.html|title=Suomi syrjii aseistakieltäytyjiä! - AKL|website=aseistakieltaytyjaliitto.fi|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for example UN's Human Rights Committee&lt;ref name="unhchr.ch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/(Symbol)/CCPR.CO.82.FIN.En?Opendocument|title=unhchr.ch|website=unhchr.ch|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), who are overseeing the implementation of human rights agreements, have demanded Finland to take measures to improve its legislation concerning COs, since they have found it to be discriminatory. Sources of criticism have been the punitive length of the civilian alternative to military service, the release of conscientious objectors from military duty only during peace time and the negligence in arranging accommodation for the servicemen{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}. Since 1999, [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur20/001/1999/en/&lt;/ref&gt; has considered Finnish ''total objectors'', who have refused to carry out non-military service, as prisoners of conscience, because of the punitive length of civilian service.

The main 12-month period of service can be performed in any institution that is both non-profit and beneficial to the society. Examples include state bureaus, schools, universities, hospitals, libraries, theatres and independent non-profit organisations such as [[Amnesty International]]. Institutions wishing to accept conscientious objectors must comply with rules laid down by the Finnish Ministry of Labour.

From the state's point of view, conscientious objectors are subject to the same rights and obligations as military enlisted men. How the service is handled in practice depends on the place of service, but a typical service consists of a common 40-hour week in the institution.

Some 2,500 men opt for the civilian service every year, which is ca. 10% of the men drafted.

Men who refuse both the military and the civilian services are known as total objectors (Finnish ''totaalikieltäytyjä''). Total objectors are sentenced unconditionally to a prison term equal to half their remaining service. In 2002, some 80 men were convicted as total objectors. It is usual for total objectors to cite in their defence the Finnish Constitution, several international human rights bodies (for example UN's Human Rights Committee&lt;ref name="unhchr.ch"/&gt;), and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which bans forced labour except in emergencies and wartime, as well as the arguably discriminatory and unconstitutional exemption from military service granted to women, men living in demilitarised Åland and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

Since 1999, [[Amnesty International]]&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; have considered the excessive length, as compared to military service, of the civilian service to be punitive and accordingly classifies Finnish total objectors as [prisoners of conscience]. In one recent case (namely ''Case-Hermaja''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hermaja.org/&lt;/ref&gt;), a total objector Jussi Hermaja has sought asylum from another country, Belgium. While asylum was eventually not granted, he was not extradited because the state of Finland never filed a formal request.

Since some 80% of Finnish men undergo military service and since military training and rank are considered merits at the job market, conscientious objectors experience discrimination. A reserve officer's or NCO's rank is considered a more significant merit for management positions than university degrees or work experience (see [[management by perkele]]). However, in most cases employers legally have no defensible reason to favour or even ask about a candidate's military training.---&gt;

===France===
[[File:Objecteurs.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Stamp created by the ''Centre de défense des objecteurs de conscience'' (around 1936).]]
The creation of a legal status for conscientious objectors in France was the subject of a long struggle involving for instance or the much-publicised trials of Protestant activists [[Jacques Martin (pacifist)|Jacques Martin]], Philippe Vernier and Camille Rombault in 1932–1933&lt;ref name = JPC&gt;Jean-Paul Cahn, Françoise Knopper, Anne-Marie Saint-Gille, De la Guerre juste à la paix juste: Aspects confessionnels de la construction de la paix dans l'espace franco-allemand (XVIe-XXe siècle), Collection Histoire et civilisations, Presses Universitaires Septentrion, 2008, 313 pages, {{ISBN|9782757400388}}, p.168&lt;/ref&gt; or the hunger strike of [[anarchist]] [[Louis Lecoin]] in 1962.

The legal status law was passed in December 1963, 43 years (and many prison sentences) after the first requests.

In 1983, a new law passed by socialist Interior Minister [[Pierre Joxe]] considerably improved this status, simplifying the conditions under which the status would be granted. Conscientious objectors were then free to choose an activity in the social realm where they would spend their civil service time. However, in order to avoid too many applications for civil service at the expense of the military, the duration of the civil service is however kept twice as long as the military service.

The effect of these laws was suspended in 2001 when compulsory military service was abolished in France. The special prison at Strasbourg for Jehovah's Witnesses, who refuse to join any military, was also abolished.

Since 1986, the associations defending conscientious objection in France have chosen to celebrate their cause on 15 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wri-irg.org/fr/node/1394|title=15 mai – Journée internationale de l'objection de conscience - Internationale des Résistant(e)s à la Guerre|website=wri-irg.org|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{Main|Conscientious objection in East Germany|Conscription in Germany}}
Under the Nazis, conscientious objection was not recognized in the law. In theory, objectors would be drafted and then court-martialled for desertion. The practice was even harsher: going beyond the letter of an already extremely flexible law, conscientious objection was considered [[Wehrkraftzersetzung|subversion of military strength]], a crime normally punished with death. On September 15, 1939 August Dickmann, a Jehovah's Witness, and the first conscientious objector of the war to be executed, died by a firing squad at the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]].&lt;ref&gt;September 17, 1939 ''The New York Times'' See also:  ''A Teacher's Guide to the Holocaust'' by Florida Center for Instructional Technology [http://fcit.usf.edu/holocaust/people/JWTIMELN.HTM]&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, [[Franz Jägerstätter]] was executed after his conscientious objection, on the grounds that he could not fight in the forces of the evil side. He is now somewhat the patron saint of conscientious objectors.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

After World War II, there was no official right to conscientious objection in the [[German Democratic Republic]]. Nevertheless, and uniquely among the Eastern bloc, objections were accepted and the objectors assigned to construction units. They were however part of the military, so that a fully civilian alternative did not exist. Also, "[[w:de:Bausoldat|construction soldiers]]" were discriminated against in their later professional life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernd Eisenfeld]]: Das Verhältnis der Partei- und Staatsführung der DDR zu den Bausoldaten a) die agitatorische Diskriminierung der Bausoldaten b) die substantielle Diskriminierung der Bausoldaten. pp. 115–125. in: Kriegsdienstverweigerung in der DDR&amp;nbsp;– ein Friedensdienst?

''In German''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[    * Sergej Kaledin: Das Baubataillon.Übersetzung der russischen Originalausgabe "Strojbat" (1991). Verlag Volk &amp; Welt. Berlin 1992. {{ISBN|3-353-00927-2}}. ''In German''&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Article 4(3) of the German constitution ([[Grundgesetz]]): "No person may be forced against their conscience to perform armed military service. Details shall be regulated by a federal law."

According to Article 12a, a law may be passed to require every male from the age of 18 to military service called ''Wehrdienst''; also, a law can require conscientious objectors to perform non-military service instead called ''Wehrersatzdienst'', literally "military replacement service", or colloquially ''Zivildienst''. These laws were applicable and demanded compulsory service in the German [[Bundeswehr]] until the abolition of draft in 2011. Initially, conscientious objectors each had to appear in person to a panel hearing at the draft office (or contest a negative decision at the [[administrative court]]). The suspension of the procedure (1977), allowing to "object with a post card", was ruled unconstitutional in 1978. Beginning in 1983, competence was shifted to the ''Kreiswehrersatzamt'' (military replacement office), which had discretion to either approve or reject a conscientious objection, which had to consist of a detailed written statement by an applicant giving reasons as to why the applicant was conscientiously objecting. This was generally just a formality, and objections were not often rejected. In later years in particular however, with the rise of the Internet, conscientious objections fell into disrepute because of the ease of being able to simply download existing example objections. It earned some conscientious objections the suspicion of an applicant simply attempting an easy way out of military service. On the other hand, certain organizations within the German peace movement had been offering pamphlets for decades giving suggestions to applicants as to the proper wording and structure of an objection which would have the greatest chances of success.

Following a 1985 Federal Constitution Court decision, Wehrersatzdienst could be no simple choice of convenience for an applicant, but he had to cite veritable conflict of conscience which made him unable to perform any kind of military service at all. If there was doubt about the true nature of an objector's application, he could be summoned to appear before a panel at the Kreiswehrersatzamt to explain his reasons in person. An approved conscientious objection in any case then meant that an applicant was required by law to perform Wehrersatzdienst. Complete objection both to military and replacement service was known as ''Totalverweigerung''; it was illegal and could be punished with a fine or a suspended custodial sentence.

Nearly the only legal way to get both out of military service and replacement service was to be deemed physically unfit for military service. Both men who entered military service and those who wanted to go into replacement service had to pass a military physical examination at the military replacement office. Five categories/levels of physical fitness, or ''Tauglichkeitsstufen'', existed. ''Tauglichkeitsstufe 5'', in short ''T5'', meant that a person was rejected for military service and thus also did not need to enter replacement service. ''T5'' status was usually only granted if a person had physical or mental disabilities or was otherwise significantly impaired, such as due to very poor eyesight or debilitating chronic illnesses.

Another way to get out of service completely was the ''two brothers rule'', which stated that if two older brothers had already served in the military, any following male children of a family were exempt from service.

Due to [[West Berlin]]'s special status between the end of the Second World War and 1990 as a city governed by foreign military powers, draft did not apply within its borders. This made Berlin a safe haven for many young people who chose to move to the city to prevent criminal court repercussions for ''Totalverweigerung''. As ''Totalverweigerer'' were often part of the far-left political spectrum, this was one factor which spawned a politically active left-wing and left-wing radical scene in the city.

Wehrersatzdienst was for a long time considerably longer than military service, by up to a third, even when the duration of service was gradually reduced following reunification and the end of the Cold War. This was held by some as a violation of constitutional principles, but was upheld in several court decisions based on the reasoning that former service personnel could be redrafted for military exercises called ''Wehrübungen'', while somebody who had served out his replacement service could not. Moreover, work conditions under military service typically involved more hardship and inconvenience than Wehrersatzdienst. In 2004, military service and Wehrersatzdienst were then made to last equal lengths of time.

Military service and draft were controversial during much of their existence. Reasons included the consideration that Germans could be made to fight against their fellow Germans in East Germany. Moreover, draft only applied to men, which was seen as gender based discrimination by some, but was often countered by the argument that women usually gave up their careers either temporarily or permanently to raise their children. With the end of the Cold War and the German military's primary purpose of defending its home territory increasingly looking doubtful, draft also began to become more arbitrary, as only certain portions of a particular birth year were drafted (usually those in very healthy physcial condition), while others weren't. This was seen as a problem of ''Wehrgerechtigkeit'', or equal justice of military service.

Then-German President [[Roman Herzog]] said in a 1994 speech (which was frequently cited as an argument for draft abolition) that only the necessity for national defense, not any other arguments can justify draft. On the other hand, this logic tended to not be extended to men serving Wehrersatzdienst, as they usually worked in fields of public health, [[elderly care]], medical assistance or assistance for the disabled. Their relatively low-paid work was seen as an ever more important backbone of a health sector which was grappling with rapidly increasing costs of care.

Draft was finally abolished in Germany in 2011, mainly due to a perceived lack of aforementioned necessity. The German Bundeswehr now solely relies on service members who deliberately choose it as a career path. Neither Article 12a (establishing the possibility of draft) nor Article 4 (3) (permitting conscientious objection) have been removed from the German Constitution. In theory, this makes a full reversion to draft (and Wehrersatzdienst) possible if it is thought to be necessary.

===Israel===
{{main|Refusal to serve in the IDF}}
All Israeli citizens and permanent residents are liable to military service. However, the Ministry of Defense has used its discretion under article 36 of this law to automatically exempt all non-Jewish women and all Arab men, except for the Druze, from military service ever since Israel was established. Israeli Arabs may volunteer to perform military service, but very few do so (except among the Bedouin population of Israel).&lt;ref name="wri-irg.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wri-irg.org/co/co-isr-03.htm|title=Conscientious objection to military service in Israel: an unrecognised human right - War Resisters' International|website=wri-irg.org|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing the status of the armed forces shortly after the founding of the State of Israel, representatives of orthodox religious parties argued that yeshiva students should be exempt from military service. This derives from the Jewish tradition that if a man wants to dedicate his life to religious study, society must allow him to do so. The request of orthodox political parties to 'prevent neglect of studying the Torah' was granted by the authorities. But in recent years this exemption practice has become the subject of debate in Israeli society, as the absolute and the relative numbers of the men who received this exemption rose sharply.&lt;ref&gt;From the [[Torato Omanuto]] entry: "from 800 men in 1968 to 41,450 in 2005 compared to 7 million for the entire population of Israel. In percentage terms, 2.4% of the soldiers enlisting to the army in 1974 were benefiting from Torato Omanuto compared to 9.2% in 1999, when it was projected that the number would reach 15% by the year 2012."&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled in the case of ''Ressler et al. v. The Knesset et al.''.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elyon1.court.gov.il/files/07/980/062/n18/07062980.n18.htm|title=בבית המשפט העליון בשבתו כבית משפט גבוה לצדק|date=February 21, 2012|language=Hebrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the blanket exemption granted to ultra-Orthodox yeshiva students was ''ultra vires'' the authority of the Minister of Defence, and that it violated Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and was, therefore, unconstitutional.

As for conscientious objection, in 2002, in the case of ''David Zonschein et al. v. Military Advocate General et al.'',&lt;ref name="test"/&gt; the Supreme Court reiterated its position that selective conscientious objection was not permitted, adding that conscientious objection could only be recognized in cases of general objection to military service.

Women can claim exemption from military service on grounds of conscience under arts. 39 (c) and 40 of the Defense Service Law, according to which religious reasons can be grounds for exemption.&lt;ref name="wri-irg.org"/&gt;

===Italy===
Until 2004 conscription was mandatory to all able-bodied [[Italy|Italian]] males. Those who were born in the last months of the year typically used to serve in the Navy, unless judged unable for ship service (in this case they could be sent back to Army or Air Force). Until 1972, objectors were considered as [[Treason|traitors]] and tried by a military tribunal; after 1972, objectors could choose an alternative civilian service, which was eight months longer than standard military service (fifteen months, then twelve, as for Army and Air Force, 24 months, then eighteen, then twelve as for the Navy){{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}. Since such length was judged too punitive, an arrangement was made to make the civilian service as long as the military service. Since 2004, Italian males no longer need to object because military service has been turned into volunteer for both males and females.

===Marshall Islands===
In the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]] no person can be conscripted if, after being afforded a reasonable opportunity to do so, he has established that he is a conscientious objector to participation in war (Marshall Islands Constitution Article II Section 11).

===Romania===
In [[Romania]], as of 23 October 2006 conscription was suspended, therefore, the status of conscience objector does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/NewsTrack/view.php?StoryID=20061023-023126-3463r Romania drops compulsory military service], United Press International, 23 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; This came about due to a [[Constitution of Romania|2003 constitutional amendment]] which allowed the parliament to make military service optional. The [[Romanian Parliament]] voted to abolish conscription in October 2005, with the vote formalizing one of many military modernization and reform programs that Romania agreed to when it joined [[NATO]].

===Russia===
{{Main|Conscription in Russia}}
The [[Russian Empire]] allowed [[Russian Mennonite]]s to run and maintain [[Forestry service (Russia)|forestry service]] units in South Russia in lieu of their military obligation. The program was under church control from 1881 through 1918, reaching a peak of seven thousand conscientious objectors during World War I. An additional five thousand Mennonites formed complete hospital units and transport wounded from the battlefield to [[Moscow]] and [[Ekaterinoslav]] hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], [[Leon Trotsky]] issued a decree allowing alternative service for religious objectors whose sincerity was determined upon examination.&lt;ref&gt;The decree was issued in October 1918. Smith, p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vladimir Chertkov]], a follower of [[Leo Tolstoy]], chaired the ''United Council of Religious Fellowships and Groups'', which successfully freed 8000 conscientious objectors from military service during the [[Russian Civil War]]. The law was not applied uniformly and hundreds of objectors were imprisoned and over 200 were executed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}The United Council was forced to cease activity in December 1920, but alternative service was available under the [[New Economic Policy]] until it was abolished in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Braun, Abraham, Th.

In the present day,{{when|date=July 2015}} Russian draft legislation allows people to choose an alternative civilian service for religious or ideological reasons. Most objectors are employed in healthcare, construction, forestry and post industries, serving 18 to 21 months.

===South Africa===
{{Main|South African resistance to war|End Conscription Campaign}}

During the 1980s, hundreds&lt;ref&gt;The National Registry of Conscientious Objectors launched in 1989, listed some 700 plus objectors for that year alone. Source: Argus, Thursday, September 21, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; of South African white males dodged the draft, refused the call-up or objected to conscription in the [[South African Defence Force]]. Some simply deserted, or joined organisations such as the [[End Conscription Campaign]], an anti-war movement banned in 1988, while others fled into exile and joined the [[Committee on South African War Resistance]]. Most lived in a state of internal exile, forced to go underground within the borders of the country until a moratorium on conscription was declared in 1993. [[South African Border War|Opposition to the Angolan War]], "South Africa's Vietnam," was rife in English-speaking campuses, and later the war in the townships became the focus of these groupings.

===South Korea===
The terminology conscientious objector technically has not existed in Korean dictionary until recently. In fact, significant majority of Korean citizens simply associate conscientious objectors with draft dodging, and are unaware of the fact that conscientious objector draftees in other westernized countries are required to serve in alternative services. Since the establishment of the [[Republic of Korea]], thousands of conscientious objectors had no choice but to be imprisoned as criminals. Every year about 500 young men, mostly Jehovah's Witnesses,&lt;ref name="jw-media"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jw-media.org/kor/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525232027/http://www.jw-media.org/kor/index.htm |archivedate=2012-05-25 |df= }} Imprisonment of conscientious objectors to military service]&lt;/ref&gt; are arrested for refusing the draft.&lt;ref name="nojail"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-objectors-idUSSEO29904620080902|title=South Korea military objectors say don't jail pacifists|date=2 September 2008|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea's stance has drawn criticism from The U.N. Human Rights Committee, which argues that South Korea is violating article 18 of the ICCPR, which guarantees freedom of thought and conscience. In 2006, 2010, and again in 2011 the U.N. Human Rights Committee, after reviewing petitions from South Korean conscientious objectors, declared that the government was violating Article 18 of the ICCPR, the provision that guarantees the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.&lt;ref name="koreaherald.heraldm.com"&gt;http://koreaherald.heraldm.com/common/redirect.jsp?news_id=20110919000963&amp;category_id=020604000000&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's National Action Plan [https://web.archive.org/web/20120402150820/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/plan_actions/docs/Korea_Summary_NHRAP.doc (NAP)] for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights has not shown a clear stance on the pressing human rights issues such as, among other things, the rights of conscientious objectors to military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.peoplepower21.org/English/20784 Second Session of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726144917/http://blog.peoplepower21.org/English/20784 |date=2008-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007 the government announced a program to give conscientious objectors an opportunity to participate in alternative civilian service.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2007/09/205_10373.html Conscientious Objectors to Get Non-Armed Services for 36 Months]&lt;/ref&gt; The program stipulates three years of civilian service that is not connected with the military in any way. However, that program has been postponed indefinitely after the succeeding administration took office in 2008.&lt;ref name="koreaherald.heraldm.com"/&gt;

The government argues that introducing an alternative service would jeopardize national security and undermine social equality and cohesion. This is amid an increasing number of countries which retain compulsory service have introduced alternatives. In addition, some countries, including those with national security concerns have shown that alternative service can be successfully implemented.&lt;ref name="koreaherald.heraldm.com"/&gt;

On January 15, 2009, the Korean Presidential Commission on Suspicious Deaths in the Military released its decision acknowledging that the government was responsible for the deaths of five young men, who were Jehovah's Witnesses and had forcibly been conscripted into the army.
The deaths resulted from "the state's anti-human rights violence" and "its acts of brutality" during the 1970s that continued into the mid-1980s. This decision is significant since it is the first one recognizing the state's responsibility for deaths resulting from violence within the military.&lt;ref name="deaths"&gt;[http://www.jw-media.org/kor/20090126.htm Korean government held responsible for deaths of five conscientious objectors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111130234/http://www.jw-media.org/kor/20090126.htm |date=2010-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/NEWKHSITE/data/html_dir/2009/01/17/200901170008.aspAbuseblamed|title=The Korea Herald|first=The Korea|last=Herald|website=koreaherald.co.kr|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the Commission's decision, "the beatings and acts of brutality committed against them by military officials were attempts to compel and coerce them to act against their conscience (religion) and were unconstitutional, anti-human rights acts that infringed severely upon the freedom of conscience (religion) guaranteed in the Constitution."&lt;ref name="deaths"/&gt;

The records of conscientious objectors to military service are kept by a governmental investigative body as criminal files for five years. As a consequence, conscientious objectors are not allowed to enter a government office and apply for any type of national certification exam. It is also very unlikely that they will be employed by any company that inquires about criminal records.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jw-media.org/kor/20081231rpt.htm Restrictions on Religious Freedom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218010933/http://jw-media.org/kor/20081231rpt.htm |date=2010-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 to 2008, Korean Military Manpower Administration said that at least 4,958 men have objected to service in the military because of religious beliefs. Among those, 4,925 were Jehovah's Witnesses, 3 were Buddhists, and the other 30 refused the mandatory service because of conscientious objections other than religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/01/117_37552.htmlConscientious|title=Objectors Top 5,000|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Since 1950, there have been more than 16,000 Jehovah's Witnesses sentenced to a combined total of 31,256 years for refusing to perform military service. If alternative service is not provided, some 500 to 900 young men will continue to be added each year to the list of conscientious objectors criminalized in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jw-media.org/kor/20110902.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007145556/http://jw-media.org/kor/20110902.htm |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Lee Yeda was the first conscientious objector to be allowed to live in France via asylum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2015/05/a-korean-conscientious-objector-in-paris/|title=A Korean Conscientious Objector in Paris|first=Yena Lee, The|last=Diplomat|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnestyusa.org/news/news-item/south-korea-authorities-wrecking-lives-by-jailing-conscientious-objectors|title=News &amp; Stories – Amnesty International USA|publisher=|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2018, the Constitutional Court ruled 6-3 that Article 5 of the country's Military Service Act is unconstitutional because it fails to provide an alternative civilian national service for conscientious objectors. {{as of|2018}}, 19,300 South Korean conscientious objectors had gone to prison since 1953. The Defense Ministry said it would honor the ruling by introducing alternative services as soon as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/world/asia/south-korea-military-service-conscientious-objectors.html |title=South Korea Must Offer Civilian Alternatives to Military Service, Court Rules |last=Sang-Hun |first=Chloe |date=June 28, 2018 |website=The New York Times |access-date=June 29, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
Conscientious objection was not permitted in [[Francoist Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Brock (historian)|Peter Brock]] and Nigel Young,
''Pacifism in the Twentieth Century''. Syracuse University Press, New York, 1999 {{ISBN|0-8156-8125-9}} 
(pp. 96–7, 311).&lt;/ref&gt; Conscientious objectors usually refused to serve on religious grounds, such as being Jehovah's Witnesses, and were placed in prison for the duration of their sentences. The [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]] acknowledged conscientious objectors.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Spanish Constitution of 1978/Part I#Division 2. Rights and Duties of Citizens|Spanish Constitution section 30.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish parliament established a longer service (''Prestación Social Sustitutoria'') as an alternative to the Army. In spite of this, a strong movement appeared that refused both services. The [[Red Cross]] was the only important organisation employing objectors. Because of this, the waiting lists for the PSS were long, especially in areas like [[Navarre]], where pacifism, [[Basque nationalism]] and a low unemployment rate discouraged young males from the army{{Original research inline|date=January 2011}}. Thousands of ''insumisos'' (non-submittants) publicly refused the PSS, and hundreds were imprisoned. In addition a number of those in the military decided to refuse further duties. A number of people not liable for military service made declarations of self-incrimination, stating that they had encouraged ''insumisión''. The government, fearing popular reaction, reduced the length of service and instead of sentencing ''insumisos'' to prison declared them unfit for public service.

Fronting the decreasing birth rate and the popular opposition to the army, the Spanish government tried to modernise the model carried from the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] era, professionalizing it. The new army tried to provide an education for civilian life and participated in peace operations in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].

===Turkey===
{{update|section|date=July 2015}}
[[Conscription in Turkey#Conscientious objection|The issue]] is highly controversial in [[Turkey]]. Turkey, [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] are the only three countries refusing to recognize conscientious objection and sustain their membership in the Council of Europe. In January 2006, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) found Turkey had violated article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (prohibition of degrading treatment) in a case dealing with the conscientious objection of [[Osman Murat Ulke]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2006/Jan/Chamberjudgment%C3%9ClkevTurkey240106.htm "Chamber Judgement Ulke vs. Turkey"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009185413/http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2006/Jan/Chamberjudgment%C3%9ClkevTurkey240106.htm |date=2006-10-09 }}, Accessed June 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Mehmet Tarhan]] was sentenced to four years in a military prison as a conscientious objector (he was unexpectedly released in March 2006). Journalist [[Perihan Magden]] was tried by a Turkish court for supporting Tarhan and advocating conscientious objection as a human right; but later, she was acquitted.

{{as of|2011|March}}, there were 125 objectors including 25 female objectors in Turkey. Another 256 people of Kurdish origin also had announced their conscientious objection to military service.&lt;ref&gt;See the list on the [http://www.savaskarsitlari.org/arsiv.asp?ArsivTipID=2 pages of the "opponents to war"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604020211/http://www.savaskarsitlari.org/arsiv.asp?ArsivTipID=2 |date=2011-06-04 }}(tr:''savaş karşıtları''), accessed on 15 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Conscientious objector [[İnan Süver]] was named a [[prisoner of conscience]] by Amnesty International.&lt;ref name="AI"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/eur44/003/2011/en/ |title=Prisoner of conscience escapes and is rearrested |date=28 April 2011 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=2 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 November 2011, the [[Ministry of Justice (Turkey)|Ministry of Justice]] announced a draft proposal to legalise  conscientious objection in Turkey and that it was to take effect two weeks after approval by the President to the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25297170/|title=NTV Haber - Türkiye ve Dünya Gündemi Güncel Son Dakika Haberleri|website=ntvmsnbc.com|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision to legalize by the Turkish government was because of pressure from the European Court of Human Rights. The ECHR gave the Turkish government a deadline until the end of 2011 to legalize conscientious objection. The draft was withdrawn afterwards.

A commission was founded within the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|National Assembly of the Republic]] to write a new constitution in 2012. The commission is still in negotiations on various articles and conscientious objection is one of the most controversial issues.

===United Kingdom===
{{Further|Conscription in the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom recognised the right of individuals not to fight in the 18th century following problems with attempting to force Quakers into military service. The Militia Ballot Act of 1757 allowed Quakers to be excluded from service in the [[Militia (Great Britain)|Militia]]. It then ceased to be a major issue, since Britain's armed forces were generally all-volunteer. However, [[press gangs]] were used to beef up army and navy rolls on occasions from the 16th to the early 19th centuries. Pressed men did have the right of appeal, in the case of sailors, to the [[Admiralty]]. The [[Royal Navy]] last took pressed men in the [[Napoleonic War]].

[[File:Conscientious Objector memorial, Tavistock Sq Gardens.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Conscientious Objector memorial in [[Tavistock Square]] Gardens, London&amp;nbsp;— dedicated on [[May 15#Holidays and observances|15 May]] 1994]]

A more general right to refuse military service was not introduced until the [[First World War]]. Britain introduced conscription with the [[Military Service Act (United Kingdom)|Military Service Act]] of January 1916, which came into full effect on 2 March 1916. The Act allowed for objectors to be absolutely exempted, to perform alternative civilian service, or to serve as a non-combatant in the army's [[Non-Combatant Corps]], according to the extent to which they could convince a [[Military Service Tribunals|Military Service Tribunal]] of the quality of their objection.&lt;ref&gt;A.J.P. Taylor, ''English History, 1914–1945'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p116.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 16,000 men were recorded as conscientious objectors, with Quakers, traditionally pacifist, forming a large proportion: 4,500 objectors were exempted on condition of doing civilian 'work of national importance', such as farming, forestry or social service; and 7,000 were conscripted into the specially-created Non-Combatant Corps. However, 6,000 were refused any exemption and forced into main army regiments; if they then refused to obey orders, they were [[Court-martial#United Kingdom|court-martialled]] and sent to prison. Thus, the well-known pacifist and religious writer [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]] was called up in 1916: he and many other Quaker activists took the unconditionalist stand, refusing both military and alternative service, and on enforced enlistment were court-martialled and imprisoned for disobedience.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Peter,''These strange criminals: an anthology of prison memoirs by conscientious objectors to military service from the Great War to the Cold War'', p. 14, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0802087078}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conscientious objectors formed only a tiny proportion of Military Service Tribunals' cases over the whole conscription period, estimated at around 2%.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Gregory, 'Military Service Tribunals, 1916–1918' in J. Harris (ed.) ''Civil Society in British History''. (Oxford, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; Tribunals were notoriously harsh towards conscientious objectors, reflecting widespread public opinion that they were lazy, degenerate, ungrateful 'shirkers' seeking to benefit from the sacrifices of others.&lt;ref&gt;Lois Bibbings, ''Telling Tales About Men''(Manchester University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-five objectors, including the [[Richmond Sixteen]], were taken to France and formally sentenced to death by court-martial but immediately reprieved, with commutation to ten-years' penal servitude.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/10507058.Silence_in_castle_to_honour_First_World_War_conscientious_objectors/ Silence in castle to honour First World War conscientious objectors] dated 25 June 2013 at thenorthernecho.co.uk, accessed 19 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions were very hard for conscientious objector prisoners, many of whom were not used to manual work, lack of regular exercise, and the often cold, damp conditions; ten died in prison, and around seventy more died elsewhere as a result of their treatment.

Although a few objectors were accepted for non-combatant service in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]], acting as nursing/paramedic assistants, the majority of non-combatants served in the Non-Combatant Corps on non-lethal stores, road and railway building and general labouring in the UK and France. Conscientious objectors who were deemed not to have made any useful contribution to the state were formally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchised]] (through a clause inserted in the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]] at the insistence of back-bench MPs) for the five years 1 September 1921 - 31 August 1926, but as it was a last-minute amendment there was no administrative machinery to enforce such disfranchisement, which was admitted to be a "dead letter".&lt;ref&gt;[[A. J. P. Taylor]], ''English History, 1914–1945'' (Oxford University Press, 1990), p. 116; [http://www.spartacus-educational.com/FWWpacifists.htm FWW Pacifists] at spartacus-educational.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Britain's conscription legislation of 1916 did not apply to [[Ireland]], despite it being then all part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. However, in 1918 the Army's continuing demand for more troops led to passing a further act enabling conscription in Ireland if and when the government saw fit. In the event, the government never saw fit, although the legislation led to the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]]. Similarly, British conscription in the [[Second World War]] did not apply to [[Northern Ireland]]. Nevertheless, many [[Irishmen]] volunteered to fight in both world wars. The various parts of the [[British Empire]] and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] had their own laws: in general, all the larger countries of the Empire participated, and some were, in proportion to their population, major participants in the First World War.

In the Second World War, following the [[National Service (Armed Forces) Act 1939]], there were nearly 60,000 registered Conscientious Objectors. Testing by tribunals resumed, this time by special Conscientious Objection Tribunals chaired by a judge, and the effects were much less harsh. If you were not a member of the Quakers or some similar pacifist organisation, it was generally enough to say that you objected to "warfare as a means of settling international disputes", a phrase from the [[Kellogg-Briand Pact]] of 1928. The tribunals could grant full exemption, exemption conditional on alternative service, exemption only from combatant duties, or dismiss the application. Of the 61,000 who were registered, 3,000 were given complete exemption; 18,000 applications were initially dismissed, but a number of such applicants succeeded at the Appellate Tribunal, sometimes after a "qualifying" sentence of three-months' imprisonment for an offence deemed to have been committed on grounds of conscience. Of those directed to non-combatant military service almost 7,000 were allocated to the Non-Combatant Corps, re-activated in mid-1940; its companies worked in clothing and food stores, in transport, or any military project not requiring the handling of "material of an aggressive nature". In November 1940 it was decided to allow troops in the NCC to volunteer for work in [[bomb disposal]].&lt;ref name=UXB92 /&gt; In total over 350 volunteered.&lt;ref name=UXB92&gt;{{cite book |title= Danger UXB The Remarkable Story of the Disposal of Unexploded Bombs During the Second World War |last=Jappy |first=M.J |year=2001 |publisher=Channel 4 books |isbn=0-7522-1938-3 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other non-combatants worked in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. For conscientious objectors exempted conditional upon performing civil work, acceptable occupations were [[farm]] work, [[mining]], [[firefighting]] and the [[Emergency medical services|ambulance service]]. About 5,500 objectors were imprisoned, most charged with refusal to attend a medical examination as a necessary preliminary to call-up after being refused exemption, and some charged with non-compliance with the terms of conditional exemption. A further 1,000 were court-martialled by the armed forces and sent to military detention barracks or civil prisons. Differently from the First World War, most sentences were relatively short, and there was no pattern of continually repeated sentences. Nevertheless, the social stigma attached to 'conchies' (as they were called) was considerable; regardless of the genuineness of their motives, cowardice was often imputed.

[[Conscription in the United Kingdom]] was retained, with rights of conscientious objection, as [[National Service]] until the last call-up in 1960 and the last discharge in 1963. The use of all volunteer soldiers was hoped to remove the need to consider conscientious objectors. Ever since the First World War, however, there have been volunteer members of the armed forces who have developed a conscientious objection to continuing in service; a procedure was devised for them in the Second World War, and, with adaptations, it continues to this day.

===United States===
{{Main|Conscientious objection in the United States}}
{{see also|New York Draft Riots|Conscription in the United States}}
There are currently legal provisions in the United States for recognizing conscientious objection, both through the [[Selective Service System]] and through the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]. The United States recognizes religious and moral objections, but not selective objections. Conscientious objectors in the United States may perform either civilian work or noncombatant service in lieu of combatant military service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sss.gov/consobj |title=Conscientious Objection and Alternative Service |website=Selective Service System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, conscientious objectors have been persecuted in the United States. After the Selective Service System was founded during [[World War I]], such persecutions decreased in frequency, and recognition for conscientious objectors grew.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Other countries===
As of 2005, conscientious objectors in several countries may serve as field paramedics in the army (although some do not consider this a genuine alternative, as they feel it merely helps to make war more humane instead of preventing it). Alternatively, they may serve without arms, although this, too, has its problems. In certain European countries such as Austria, Germany, Greece and Switzerland, there is the option of performing civilian service, subject to the review of a written application or after a hearing about the state of conscience. In Germany, however, the draft was suspended in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/germany-to-suspend-compulsory-military-service/a-6315122|title=Germany to suspend compulsory military service - Germany - DW - 10.12.2010|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|website=DW.COM|accessdate=12 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Greece, civilian service is twice as long as the corresponding military service; the [[Swiss Civilian Service]] is one and one-half times longer. In 2005, the Swiss parliament considered whether willingness to serve one and a half times longer than an army recruit was sufficient proof of sincerity, citing that the cost of judging the state of conscience of a few thousand men per year was too great.

==Conscientious objection in professional forces==
Only three European Union countries&amp;nbsp;– Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom&amp;nbsp;– recognize the right to conscientious objection for contract and professional military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;War Resisters' International, ''Professional Soldiers and the Right to Conscientious Objection in the European Union'' October 2008, p. 6, downloadable from {{cite web |url=http://wri-irg.org/pdf/eu-rtba2008update-en.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118175710/http://wri-irg.org/pdf/eu-rtba2008update-en.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, military personnel who come to a conviction of conscientious objection during their tour of duty must appear in front of a panel of experts, which consists of psychiatrists, military chaplains and officers.

In Switzerland, the panel consists entirely of civilians, and military personnel have no authority whatsoever. In Germany, the draft has been suspended since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.faz.net/|title=Aktuelle Nachrichten online|last=GmbH|first=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung|website=FAZ.NET|access-date=2016-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common questions==

Investigators ask questions to determine the sincerity of an individual's convictions. Responses such as "the army is senseless," "it is not just to wage wars," or opposing participation in merely some wars, indicate sociological, philosophical, or political objections, which are not accepted alone.&lt;ref&gt;50 U.S.C. 3806(j)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6243">The '''Convention for the Preservation of Wild Animals, Birds and Fish in Africa''' (also known as the '''London Convention of 1900''') is a [[multilateral treaty]] on wildlife preservation that was signed by the European colonial powers in [[London]] in 1900. Although it never entered into force, it has nevertheless been recognised as one of history's earliest agreements on nature conservation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philippe Sands]], ''Principles of International Environmental Law'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003) at 524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[International Union for Conservation of Nature]], [http://www.sprep.org/attachments/Legal/IUCNApia.pdf ''An Introduction to the African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources''] (IUCN Environmental Policy and Law Paper No. 56, 2004) p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John M. MacKenzie, ''The Empire of Nature: Hunting, Conservation, and British Imperialism'' (Manchester University Press, 1997), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion and ratifications==
The convention was concluded and signed on 19 May 1900 by [[French Third Republic|France]], [[German Empire|Germany]], the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]], [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], [[Spain under the Restoration|Spain]], and the [[Congo Free State]]. The treaty required all signatory states to ratify it before entering into force; because most of the signatories did not ratify the agreement, it never entered into force. 

==Protective categories==
A key innovation of the convention—which is still used today in conservation treaties—was the inclusion of schedules which placed animals in different categories of protection.

===Schedule 1: Absolute prohibition on hunting or destruction===
The animals in Schedule 1 were to be protected from all hunting and destruction; this was done either because of the animals' perceived "usefulness" or "their rarity and threatened extermination":
{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|
*[[vulture]]s (usefulness)
*[[secretary-bird]]s (usefulness)
*[[owl]]s (usefulness)
*rhinoceros-birds or beef-eaters (''[[Buphagus|Buphaga]]'') (usefulness)
*[[giraffe]]s (rarity)
*[[gorilla]]s (rarity)
*[[chimpanzee]]s (rarity)
*[[mountain zebra]]s (rarity)
*[[African wild ass|wild asses]] (rarity)
*[[Wildebeest|white-tailed gnu]]s (''Connochaetes gnu'') (rarity)
*elands (''[[Taurotragus]]'') (rarity)
*[[Pygmy hippopotamus|little Liberian hippopotamus]]es (rarity)
}}

===Schedules 2 and 3: Prohibition on hunting or destruction while young or mothering===
The animals in Schedule 2 were to be protected from all hunting and destruction while the animals were young. Female animals in Schedule 3 were to be protected from all hunting and destruction when they were accompanied by their young. The lists of animals in Schedules 2 and 3 were identical:
{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|
*[[elephant]]s (tusks under 5 kg were to be confiscated)
*[[rhinoceros]]es
*[[hippopotamus]]es
*[[zebra]]s of species not mentioned in Schedule 1
*[[African buffalo|buffaloes]]
*[[ibex]]es
*[[chevrotain]]s (''[[Tragulus]]'')
*antelopes and gazelles (especially species of the genera ''[[Bubalis]]'', ''[[Damaliscus]]'', ''[[Connochaltes]]'', ''[[Cephalophus]]'', ''[[Oregtragus]]'', ''[[Oribia]]'',''[[ Rhaphiceros]]'', ''[[Nesolragus]]'', ''[[Madogna]]'', ''[[Cobus]]'', ''[[Cervicapra]]'', ''[[Grey rhebok|Pelea]]'', ''[[Epyceros]]'', ''[[Antidorcus]]'', ''[[Gazella]]'', ''[[Ammodorcus]]'', ''[[Lithcranius]]'', ''[[Docolragus]]'', ''[[Oryx]]'', ''[[Addox]]'', ''[[Hippotragus]]'', ''[[Taurotragus]]'', ''[[Strepsiceros]]'', ''[[Tragelaphus]]'')
}}

===Schedule 4: Animals that may be hunted or destroyed in limited numbers===
The animals in Schedule 4 were to be protected from hunting and destruction "except in limited numbers":
{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|
*all animals listed in Schedules 2 and 3
*the various pigs
*[[Black-and-white colobus|Colobi]] and all the fur-monkeys
*[[aardvark]]s (''Crycteropux'')
*[[gugong]]s (''Hulicore'')
*[[manatee]]s (''Manatus'')
*the small cats
*[[serval]]s
*[[Chital|cheetali]] (''Cynalurus'')
*[[jackal]]s
*[[aardwolf|aardwolves]] (''Proteles'')
*small monkeys
*[[ostrich]]es
*[[Marabou Stork|marabous]]
*[[egret]]s
*[[bustard]]s
*[[francolin]]s, [[guinea-fowl]], other "game" birds
*large [[tortoise]]s
}}

===Schedule 5: Harmful animals desirable to be reduced in number===
The animals in Schedule 5 were designated "harmful" and the treaty regarded them as desirable to be reduced in numbers "within sufficient limits":
{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|
*[[lion]]s
*[[leopard]]s
*[[hyaena]]s
*African hunting dog (''[[Lycaon pictus]]'')
*[[otter]]s (''[[Lutra]]'')
*[[baboon]]s (''[[Cynocephalus]]'') and other harmful monkeys
*[[crocodile]]s
*poisonous snakes
*[[python (genus)|pythons]]
*large birds of prey other than those mentioned in Schedule 1
}}

The convention encouraged the destruction of the eggs of crocodiles, poisonous snakes, and pythons.

==Other provisions==
The convention encouraged the creation of [[wildlife reserve]]s. It would have prohibited the use of nets and pitfalls in hunting and the use of explosives or poison on fish. The convention allowed for the creation of export duties on animal hides, tusks, and antlers.

==Replacement==
The treaty never entered into force and in 1933 was replaced by the [[Convention Relative to the Preservation of Fauna and Flora in their Natural State]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9481">'''''Decreței''''' (from the [[Romanian language]] word ''decret'', meaning "[[decree]]"; diminutive '''''decrețel''''') are [[Demographics of Romania|Romanian]]s born in the late 1960s and 1970s, shortly after the [[Socialist Republic of Romania|communist regime]] of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] issued '''Decree 770''', aimed at the creation of a new and large Romanian population by restricting [[Abortion in Romania|abortion]] and [[birth control|contraception]].
[[Image:BirthDeath 1950 RO.svg|thumb|right|The [[birth rate]] surged in 1967 and returned to its previous trend as people found ways to circumvent the decree.]]

== Origin of the decree ==
Before 1967, the Romanian [[abortion]] policy was one of the most liberal in Europe. Because the availability of [[contraceptive]] methods was poor, abortion was the most common means of family planning.

Through a combination of modernization of the Romanian community, the high participation of women in the labor market and a low standard of living, the number of births significantly decreased since the 1950s, reaching its lowest value in 1966. However, the leaders saw the decreasing number of births mainly as a result of the decree issued in 1957 that legalized abortion.

To counter this sharp decline of the population, the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]] decided that the Romanian population should be increased from 23 to 30 million inhabitants. In October 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legex.ro/Decretul-770-1966-363.aspx|title=Decretul 770/1966 - Legislatie gratuita|website=www.legex.ro|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decree 770 was authorized by Ceaușescu. Abortion and contraception were declared illegal, except for:
* women over 45 (later lowered to 40)
* women who had already borne four children (later raised to five)
* women whose life would be threatened by carrying to term, due to medical complications
* women who were pregnant through rape and/or [[incest]]

== Enforcement ==
To enforce the decree, society was strictly controlled. Contraceptives disappeared from the shelves and all women were forced to be monitored monthly by a [[gynecologist]].{{fact|date=August 2016}} Any detected pregnancies were followed until birth. [[Securitate|Secret police]] kept close eyes on operations in hospitals.

[[Sex education]] was refocused primarily on the benefits of motherhood, including the ostensible satisfaction of being a heroic mother who gives her homeland many children.

The direct consequence of the decree was a huge [[baby boom]]. Between 1966 and 1967 the number of births almost doubled, and the number of children per woman increased from 1.9 to 3.7. The generation born in 1967 and 1968 was the largest in Romanian history. Hastily, thousands of nursery schools were built.

== Circumvention and mortality ==
In the seventies, birth rates declined again. Economic pressure on families remained, and people began to seek ways to circumvent the decree. Wealthier women were able to obtain contraceptives illegally, or bribed doctors to give diagnoses which made abortion possible. Especially among the less educated and poorer women there were many unwanted pregnancies. These women could only utilize primitive methods of abortion, which led to infection, sterility or even their own death. The [[mortality rate|mortality]] among pregnant women became the highest of Europe during the reign of Ceaușescu. While the childbed mortality rate kept declining over the years in neighboring countries, in Romania it increased to more than ten times that of its neighbors.

Many children born in this period became malnourished, were severely physically handicapped, or ended up in [[Orphanage#Romania|care under grievous conditions]], which led to a rise in [[child mortality]].

==Romanian orphans==
{{Main|Romanian orphans}}
A consequence of Ceaușescu's natalist policy is that large numbers of children ended up living in [[orphanages]], because their parents could not cope. The vast majority of children who lived in the communist orphanages were not actually orphans, but were simply children whose parents could not afford to raise them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4629589.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - What happened to Romania's orphans?|website=news.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanian revolution==
In their book ''[[Freakonomics]]'', authors [[Steven Levitt]] and [[Stephen J. Dubner]] make the argument that [[Legalized abortion and crime effect|children that are born after their mothers are refused an abortion]] are much more likely to commit crimes or refuse to recognize authority when they reach adulthood. They further argue that the Decreței are exactly the same people who spearheaded the effort to [[Romanian Revolution|violently overthrow Ceaușescu's regime]] in 1989. In that year, the oldest Decreței would have been 22 years old, in the general age range of most revolutionaries. Levitt and Dubner note that Romania was the only east-European communist country with strict anti-abortion and anti-contraception laws at the time, and also the only country whose ruler was violently overthrown and killed at the [[Revolutions of 1989|end]] of the [[Cold War]]. Most other such countries experienced a tumultuous, but peaceful, transition. There were however{{original research?|date=May 2016}} other aspects of [[totalitarian]] rule that would promote violent reaction instead of peaceful transition, including a lack of associational life and legal gatherings, a more extensive system of informants and special police than any state other than [[East Germany]], and a [[Nicolae Ceausescu's cult of personality|cult of personality]]&lt;ref&gt;Gilberg, Trond. ''Nationalism and Communism in Romania: The Rise and Fall of Ceausescu's Personal Dictatorship'' Westview Press, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; built up around the supreme leader. The actual violence of the revolution can be attributed to divisions among the ruling and military/secret police and the vacuum of power that resulted. Revolutions are often observed to come in waves and it is likely that Romania would have experienced it no matter its demographic situation.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Mark. ''Revolutions and Revolutionary Waves''. St Martin's Press, 1999, p. xi, 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abortion after 1990==
Although in the early 1990s, shortly after abortion was legalized, the abortion rate was very high, it has gradually decreased, as more couples started using contraception, and the economy also started to improve after the instability of the transition. According to the [[National Institute of Statistics (Romania)|National Institute of Statistics]], the rate of abortions since 1990 is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/Anuar%20statistic/02/2.11.xls{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defend Innovation''' is a [[patent]] reform project started by [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) in June 2012. The project initially proposed seven changes to United States's patent system, including shortening the term for [[software patent]]s, requirement to provide the running software code along with patent application, and avoidance of liability of an infringer who independently arrives at the patented invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EFF Launches New Patent Reform Project to Defend Innovation|url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-launches-new-patent-reform-project-defend-innovation|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Proposals|url=https://defendinnovation.org/proposals|website=Defend Innovation|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222074452/https://defendinnovation.org/proposals|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Since June 2012, the project collected information about the patent system from lawyers, software engineers, court cases, and other sources. The information collected was combined with EFF's own expertise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patents|url=https://www.eff.org/patent|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and compiled in a whitepaper named ''How to Fix Our Broken Patent System'', which details the issues surrounding the patent system and proposes solutions that can be implemented by the Congress, Patent Office, and also the software companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Defend Innovation|url=https://defendinnovation.org/|website=Defend Innovation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whitepaper is available at the Defend Innovation website.

[[File:Front and back label of Amarone della Valpolicella.jpg|thumb|250px|Labels of the Italian wine ''Amarone Della Valpolicella Classico'' 2004 from the Pegrandi vineyard produced by Vaona. The label indicates that this is a DOC class wine from the Classico region of Valpolicella.]]
'''''Denominazione di origine controllata''''' ('''DOC'''; {{IPA-it|denominatˈtsjoːne di oˈriːdʒine kontrolˈlaːta|pron}}; [[English language|English]]: controlled designation of origin) is a [[quality assurance]] label for [[Italy|Italian]] [[wines]]. The system is modeled on the [[France|French]] ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC) designations. The Italian government introduced the system in 1963 and overhauled it in 1992 to comply with [[European Union]] law on [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union|protected geographical designations of origin]], which came into effect that year.

==Description==
[[File:DOCG.jpg|thumb|left|178px|DOCG seal on a bottle of ''[[Chianti]] Classico Riserva 1995''.]]
There are three levels of labels: '''DO''' — '''''D'''enominazione di '''O'''rigine'' (designation of origin, seldom used), '''DOC''' — '''''D'''enominazione di '''O'''rigine '''C'''ontrollata'' (controlled designation of origin), and '''DOCG''' — '''''D'''enominazione di '''O'''rigine '''C'''ontrollata e '''G'''arantita'' (controlled and guaranteed designation of origin). All three require that a food product be produced within the [[Geographical indication|specified region]] using defined methods and that it satisfy a defined quality standard.

The need for a DOCG identification arose when the DOC designation was, in the view of many Italian food industries, given too liberally to different products. A new, more restrictive identification was then created as similar as possible to the previous one so that buyers could still recognize it, but qualitatively different.

===Wines===
[[File:DOCG label.jpg|thumb|150px|A paper strip denoting DOCG on a bottle of 2012 [[Barbera d'Asti]]]]
A notable difference for wines is that DOCG labelled wines are analysed and tasted by government–licensed personnel before being bottled. To prevent later manipulation, DOCG wine bottles then are sealed with a numbered governmental seal across the cap or cork.

Italian legislation additionally regulates the use of the following qualifying terms for wines: ''Classico'' (classic): reserved for wines produced in the region where a particular type of wine has been produced "traditionally". For the [[Chianti#Chianti Classico|Chianti Classico]], this "traditional region" is defined by a decree from July 10, 1932, and ''[[Reserve wine|Riserva]]'' (reserve), which may be used only for wines that have been aged at least two years longer than normal for a particular type of wine. Wines labelled DOC or DOCG may only be sold in bottles holding 5 [[litre]]s or less.

For wines produced in [[Bolzano]], where [[German language|German]] is an official language, DOC may alternatively be written as ''Kontrollierte Ursprungsbezeichnung'' and DOCG may be written as ''Kontrollierte und garantierte Ursprungsbezeichnung''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:2002R0753:20071214:EN:PDF Commission Regulation (EC) No 753/2002 of 29 April 2002 laying down certain rules for applying Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 as regards the description, designation, presentation and protection of certain wine sector products], consolidated version up until Commission Regulation (EC) No 1471/2007 of 13 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=The final part (eschatocol) could include subscriptio: signatures (mata) of the parties or stamps, sometimes the name of the scribe is also mentioned; apprecatio: blessings (e. g., śrīh., śubham, “hail”), authoritative confirmations (e. g., pramān ̇a) ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also expresses the context of the documentation of the action described therein, i. e., [[enunciation]] of the means of validation and indication of who is responsible to document the act; and the final formulae.

Common in European medieval [[charter]]s, they have been relegated to [[Act (document)#Notorial Acts|notarial acts]], governmental acts, diplomatic [[treaty|treaties]], [[Certificate of authenticity|certificates]], and other formal [[document]]s.

==Contents==
Eschatocols usually contain a:
* '''Clause of corroboration''' that expresses the specific means by which the document is to be or was validated and guaranteed as to its [[Authentication|authenticity]], which means may be a:
** [[jurat (clause)|Jurat]], i. e., the [[oath]] of witnesses that the contents of the document were sworn to and that the witnesses witnessed its signing;
** [[testimony|Testimonium]] clause expressing the identities of the signatories and the time and place at which they signed it, e. g., "Sworn to and subscribed before me this 8th day of October, 2009 in the City of Dayton";
** [[Attestation clause]] attesting to the subscription on the document of a signature of attestation, e. g., "THUS DONE AND SIGNED ...";
** [[Self-proving|Self-proof clause]], typically present only in [[Will and testament|will]]s, and consisting of [[affidavit]]s of the testator and the witnesses that the document was duly executed, which affidavits permit the will to be legally proven without further [[testimony]] as to its [[Authentication|authenticity]];
* '''Dating clause''' that expresses the time and place of execution by means of stating the:
** [[venue (law)|Venue]], also denominated the "topical date", i. e., the location of the signing of the document; and
** (Chronological) date, i. e., the day, month, and year of the signing of the document;
* '''Subscription''', i. e., the signature block, specifically an:
** [[Attestation clause]] bearing the signature of the party, witness, or authenticator; or
** Qualification of signature, being a description of the function or office that the signatory exercised in so signing.

In notarial writings, the eschatocol is specifically a long form of notarial authentication, i. e. the notarization proper, and takes the form of the final clause of acts in public form or of the certificate at the end of acts in private form, typically to certify the document for use in foreign states. The words of an eschatocol are very formulaic and vary depending on the nature of the notarial act. At least in English, much of what was previously several sentences is condensed into one.

==Examples==
For acts in '''public form''', typical eschatocols read as follows:
*"THUS DONE AND PASSED in the City of (city) aforesaid on the day, month, and year first above written and in the presence of the Witnesses who have hereunto subscribed their names with said Appearer before me, Notary, after due reading of the whole." ([[Louisiana]], [[United States]])
*"THUS DONE, READ AND SIGNED before me, Notary, in the City and State aforesaid on the day of the date hereinabove set forth." ([[Louisiana]], [[United States]])
*"Thus done and signed at (city) on the (day) day of (month) in the year (year) in the presence of the undersigned witnesses." ([[South Africa]])
*"THUS THE APPEARERS STATE AND DECLARE and after I, Notary, had read over the instrument which I did with tacit agreement of the appearers, the latter ratified the contents hereof, as to all of which certify on this (ordinal day) day of (month) (year)." ([[England]], [[United Kingdom]])
*"Thus done, declared, and protested in due form of law, at the office of me, the said notary, at (location), the day and year first before written." ([[England]], [[United Kingdom]])
*"Thus done and protested, in the city of San Francisco, this fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine. In testimony whereof, as well as said appearers, as I, the said notary, have subscribed these presents, and I have also caused my seal of office to be hereunto affixed, the day and year last above written." ([[San Francisco]], [[California]], [[United States]])
*"Thus done and passed at [[London]] aforesaid in the presence of Captain John Tailor of London, merchant, and Mr. Nicholas Corsellis also of London, merchant, as witnesses hereunto required.  In Testimony of which, I, the Notary aforesaid, have hereunto set my hand and seal of office this 15th day of November, One thousand seven hundred and thirty nine." ([[London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]])

For those in '''private form''', the following are typical:
*"IN FAITH AND TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereto set and subscribed my name and affixed my seal of office at London this (ordinal day) day of (month), (year)." ([[London]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]])
*"IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto subscribed my name and affixed my seal Notarial at Ottawa this (ordinal day) day of (month), (year)." ([[Ottawa]], [[Canada]])
*"SWORN TO AND SUBSCRIBED before me, the undersigned authority, this (ordinal day) day of (month), (year). IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and official seal."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11687">[[File:Armistice of Villa Incisa.gif|thumb|Badoglio reading the armistice conditions to the French delegation]]
The '''Franco-Italian Armistice''', or '''Armistice of Villa Incisa''', signed on 24 June 1940, in effect from 25 June, ended the brief [[Italian invasion of France]] during the [[Second World War]].

On 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on France while the latter was already on the verge of defeat in its [[Battle of France|war with Germany]]. After the fall of Paris on 14 June, the French requested an armistice from Germany and, realising that the Germans would not allow them to continue the war against their Italian allies, also sent an armistice request to Italy, whose forces had not yet advanced. Fearing that the war would end before Italy had achieved any of its aims, Prime Minister [[Benito Mussolini]] ordered a full-scale invasion across the Alps to begin on 21 June. The [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|Franco-German armistice]] was signed on the evening of the 22 June, but would not come into force until the Italians signed their own armistice. Their troops unable to break through, the Italians abandoned their major war aims and signed the armistice on 24 June. It came into effect early the next morning. It established a small occupation zone and an [[Italian Armistice Commission with France]] (''Commissione Italiana d'Armistizio con la Francia'', CIAF) in [[Turin]] to oversee French compliance. Armistice commissions were also established for [[French North Africa]] and [[French Somaliland in World War II|French Somaliland]]. The armistice remained in force until November 1942, when during [[Case Anton]] the Italians [[Italian occupation of France during World War II|occupied most of southeastern France and Corsica]] and [[Battle of Tunisia|invaded Tunisia]].

==French request==
On 17 June, the day after he transmitted a formal request for an armistice to the German government, French Foreign Minister [[Paul Baudoin]] handed to the Papal nuncio Valerio Valeri a note that said: "The French government, headed by Marshal Pétain, requests that the Holy See transmit to the Italian government as quickly as possible the note it has also transmitted through the Spanish ambassador to the German government. It also requests that he convey to the Italian government its desire to find together the basis of a lasting peace between the two countries." That same morning, Mussolini received word from Hitler that France had asked Germany for an armistice, and he went to meet Hitler at Munich, charging General Roatta, Admiral [[Raffaele de Courten]] and Air Brigadier [[Egisto Perino]] with drafting Italy's demands.{{sfn|Corvaja|2001|p=116}} Ciano wrote in his diary about the ridiculous demand some of his staff suggested: the entire French fleet, all its colonies, all its locomotives, the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. The final list of demands actually presented to the French were mild.{{sfn|Corvaja|2001|p=118}} Italy dropped its claims to the [[Rhone|Rhône Valley]], [[Corsica]], [[French Tunisia|Tunisia]], and [[French Somaliland in World War II|French Somaliland]]. According to Romain Rainero, Mussolini still clung to the goals laid out in his meeting with Hitler on 18 June as late as 21 June, when the "Protocols of the Armistice Conditions between France and Italy" were officially published in Rome. It was his view that it was not German pressure that led him to back down. Indeed, Hitler had wanted the Italians to claim even more territory from the defeated French. Badoglio, however, had warned Mussolini that a larger occupation of southern France would require fifteen divisions.{{sfn|Sica|2012|p=374}}

==Negotiations==
On the evening of 21 June, Ambassador [[Dino Alfieri]] in Berlin transmitted the German armistice terms to Rome. According to Ciano, "under these [mild] conditions, Mussolini is not prepared to make territorial demands ... and [will] wait for the peace conference to make all our formal demands." He added that Mussolini wished to delay the meeting with the French in the hopes that General Gambara would take Nice.{{sfn|Corvaja|2001|p=124}} The French had tried to play the allies off against each other; they "flattered the Germans [and] belittled the Italian war effort".{{sfn|Sica|2012|p=372}} Unlike the Franco-German armistice talks, the Franco-Italian negotiations would be genuine.{{sfn|Knox|1999|p=133}}

At 1500 hours on 23 June, the French delegation, headed by General [[Charles Huntziger]], who had signed the [[Armistice with France (Second Compiègne)|German armistice]] the previous day, landed in Rome aboard three German aircraft. The French negotiators were the same who had met with the Germans: Huntziger, General Maurice Parisot, a peacetime friend of Badoglio's, General Jean Bergeret, Admiral Maurice Le Luc, Charles Rochat of the Foreign Ministry and Léon Nöel, former ambassador to Poland. Italy was represented by Badoglio, Cavagnari, Ciano, Roatta and [[Francesco Pricolo]]. The first meeting of the two delegations took place at 1930 hours at the Villa Incisa all'Olgiata on the Via Cassia. It lasted only twenty-five minutes, during which Roatta read out Italy's proposed terms, Huntziger requested a recess to confer with his government and Ciano adjourned the meeting until the next day.  During the adjournment, Hitler informed Mussolini that he thought the Italian demands too light, and he proposed linking up the German and Italian occupation zones. Roatta convinced Mussolini that it was too late to change the demands.{{sfn|Corvaja|2001|pp=125–26}}

At 1915 hours on 24 June, at the Villa Incisa, after receiving his government's permission, General Huntziger signed the armistice on behalf of the French and Marshal Badoglio for the Italians signed the armistice. Both armistices came into effect at thirty-five minutes past midnight (0035 hours){{efn|Some authorities say 0135 hours,{{sfn|Knox|1999|p=133}}{{sfn|Andreyev|1941|p=58}} which is more consistent with the six-hour delay between signing and coming into force reported by Auphan and Mordal.{{sfn|Auphan|Mordal|1959|p=112}}}} on 25 June.{{sfn|Auphan|Mordal|1959|p=112}} Just minutes before the signing, Huntziger had asked Badoglio to strike the clause calling for the repatriation to Italy of political refugees (like the socialist [[Pietro Nenni]]). Badoglio consulted Mussolini, he agreed.{{sfn|Corvaja|2001|pp=125–26}} After signing, Huntziger said to Badoglio, "Marshal, in the present, infinitely painful circumstances, the French delegation is comforted by the sincere hope that the peace which will follow shortly will allow France to begin the task of reconstruction and renewal and will create the basis for lasting relations between our two countries in the interest of Europe and of civilization." Badoglio responded, "I hope France will have a resurgence; it is a great nation with a great history, and I am certain that it will have a great future. From one soldier to another, I sincerely hope so."{{sfn|Corvaja|2001|pp=125–26}} Mussolini remarked that the agreement was "more a political than a military armistice after only fifteen days of war—but it gives us a good document in hand".{{sfn|Knox|1999|p=133}}

The armistice established a modest [[demilitarized zone]] {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep on the French side of the border, thus eliminating the Alpine Line. The actual [[Italian-occupied France|Italian occupation zone]] was no more than what had been occupied up to the armistice. It contained 832&amp;nbsp;km² and 28,500 inhabitants, which included the city of Menton and its 21,700 inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Rochat200827"&gt;[[#CITEREFRochat2008|Rochat 2008]], ¶27.&lt;/ref&gt; Italy retained the right to interfere in French territory as far as the Rhône, but it did not occupy this area until after the [[Operation Torch|Allied invasion of French North Africa]] in November 1942.&lt;ref name="Rochat200829"&gt;[[#CITEREFRochat2008|Rochat 2008]], ¶29.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, demilitarized zones were established in the French colonies in Africa. Italy was granted the right to use the [[Djibouti, Djibouti|port of Djibouti]] in Somaliland with all its equipment, along with the French section of the [[Ethio-Djibouti Railways|Djibouti–Addis Ababa railway]]. More importantly, the naval bases of Toulon, Bizerte, Ajaccio and Oran were also to be demilitarized.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1139">In [[property law]], the term '''free and clear''' refers to ownership without legal [[encumbrances]], such as a [[lien]] or [[Mortgage law|mortgage]].  So, for example: a person owns a house free and clear if he has paid off the mortgage and no [[creditor]] has filed a lien against it.

Lately there has been a resurgence in interest for free and clear properties despite being an investment form that has been prevalent from early on. Investing in free and clear properties removes the need for a bank loan entirely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.investsteps.com/loans/how-to-find-free-and-clear-properties-for-investment/|url=http://www.investsteps.com/loans/how-to-find-free-and-clear-properties-for-investment/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Over 35% of all properties in the United States are owned free and clear with no outstanding mortgages or liens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Buy Free and Clear Real Estate (Part 1) |url=http://www.creonline.com/how-to-buy-free-and-clear-real-estate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2677">The '''Grotius Lectures''' is a series of annual lectures sponsored by the [[American Society of International Law]] since 1999.  The lecture is named in honour of the famous [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[jurist]], [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583–1645), considered by many to be the 'father of international law.'  Over the past decade, the lecture has been delivered by a leading [[international law]] scholar or [[international lawyer]].  The lecture is customarily read at the opening of the annual meeting of the ASIL, usually held in late March or April each year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20494">Located in South America, Brazil is the fifth largest and fifth most populous nation in the world. First discovered by Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] on April 22, 1500, it remained a Portuguese colony until it declared its independence on September 7, 1822.

==Brazilian nationality prior to independence==
Brazil's economy was largely based on agriculture and mining; specifically the production of sugar and tobacco for export.  As a result, land was concentrated in the hands of relatively few wealthy, plantation owning families, and production was largely dependent on slave labor.  The intermixing of these Europeans and Blacks, as well as the native Indians of the territory, helped create a unique people and culture.&lt;ref&gt;Burns,6&lt;/ref&gt;

The social, economic, and political hierarchy of this period was largely based on race; with Europeans occupying the upper ranks and the non-whites subsequent ranks below them.  Despite these internal divisions, Brazil possessed a number of factors that aided in the formation of nationalist sentiments among the elite.

"[...]First its unity of territory. Brazil stretches unbroken from the Amazon in the north to the Rio de la Plata in the south, and from the Atlantic coast to the foothills of the Andes[...] The vast majority of the people speak Portuguese and are Roman Catholic.  Their language differentiates them from their Spanish speaking neighbors[...]" &lt;ref&gt;Burns, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing nationalistic trend in literature,&lt;ref&gt;Burns, 9&lt;/ref&gt; and the emergence of colonial born elites created a sense of pride and attachment to the territory of Brazil and a distancing from Portugal. The revolutions in [[American Revolution|America]], [[French Revolution|France]], and the [[Spanish America]] along with the maturation of Brazil as a colony furthered nationalist sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of the Napoleonic Wars in Brazilian independence===
Despite its natural geographic barriers and the distinct culture of its inhabitants, Brazilian independence would only be realized after a series of events set in motion by the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

In 1807, Portugal was invaded by [[Napoleon]] forcing prince regent Dom Joao to flee to Brazil along with other members of the royal family, and a number of notables and functionaries. This effectively making Brazil the seat of the Portuguese government.&lt;ref name="Britannica, 80"&gt;''Britannica'', 80&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Brazil, Dom Joao instituted a number of reforms and decrees, most notably the one on December 16, 1815, which designated the Portuguese dominions the "United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves", making Brazil coequal with Portugal.&lt;ref name="Britannica, 80"/&gt;

After the French withdrawal from Portugal, mounting pressure from the Cortes (Portuguese parliament) forced the return of Dom Joao (now King John VI) in 1821. He appointed his son, Dom Pedro, regent in his place. Looking to return Brazil to its formerly dependent colonial status, the Cortes repealed many of the decrees and reforms of King John VI, and demanded Dom Pedro's return to Europe.

Defying the Cortes, Dom Pedro formed a legislative and constituent assembly on June 3, 1822, and declared Brazil's independence on September 7, 1822. He was crowned Brazil's first emperor on December 1.&lt;ref name="Britannica, 80"/&gt;

===Recognition of Brazil as a nation===
*The United States recognized Brazil as a new nation in 1824.  Portugal followed a year later.&lt;ref name="Britannica, 80"/&gt;
*In 1827, a treaty between Brazil and Britain was signed.  By signing the treaty Brazil agreed to abolish the slave trade within three years, and grant Britain a favored position in its markets in return for Britain's recognition of its independence.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutions==

===Government===
Since its independence Brazil has been subject to a lot of internal unrest resulting in several years of military rule and the promulgation of several different constitutions, the most recent one being passed in 1988.  While political change has been frequent, the social and economic realities in Brazil have remained largely the same.

"Throughout modern Brazilian history every change of political regime-from the establishment of an independent empire in the early 1820s to the establishment of a modern representative democracy in the late 1980s- has demonstrated the extraordinary capacity of the Brazilian elites to defend the status quo and their own interests by controlling, co-opting and, if necessary, repressing the forces in favor of radical social change[...]",&lt;ref name="Bethell"&gt;Bethell&lt;/ref&gt;

While political and military developments in Europe helped lead to Brazilian independence, it was also partially a result of the Brazilian elites.  The plantation owners backed Pedro's declaration of independence because it granted them greater freedom to conduct trade and the opportunity to expand their overseas markets.  The emerging urban elite saw, who occupied an insecure position between plantation owners and slaves saw it as a way to improve their status.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, 30&lt;/ref&gt;  Once agreed upon, independence was secured quickly and peacefully, with no concessions being made to the underprivileged groups in society.  "The transition from colony to independent empire was characterized by political, economic, and social continuity." &lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethell&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent governments and constitutions were also largely the result of elite initiatives.

===Political incorporation and suffrage===

====Imperial Constitution====
Under the Imperial Constitution, power was concentrated in the hands of the hereditary emperor who had the power to appoint ministers, counselers of state, provincial presidents, and the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies was elected by a small segment of the population.  Though the government was only responsible to it in a limited extent.&lt;ref name="Bethell"/&gt;

Despite this, political participation of this period was surprisingly high.  Men who were twenty-five years old (twenty-one if married), Catholic, born free, with quite low annual income had the right to vote in the elections of the Chamber of Deputies.  These elections were however indirect.  They elected ''eleitores'', who were required to have a higher annual income, further restricting electoral participation.  And only the ''eleitores'' had the right to vote on the deputies.&lt;ref name="Bethell"/&gt;

The initial rates of high political participation were eventually restricted in the latter parts of the nineteenth century. A gradual shift from slave to free labor, made abolition seem inevitable.  This created a growing fear among  both rural and urban elites that emancipated slaves would acquire the property necessary to secure the right to vote.

To quell this fear, the ''Savaria Law'' was passed in 1881.  Under this law the Chamber of Deputies would be directly elected, the voting age was lowered to twenty-one, and the property/income qualification to vote was removed.  It also allowed non-Catholics and former slaves to become eligible voters.  Most importantly, it required people to pass a literacy test in order to gain the right to vote.

Rather than extend political participation, the literacy tests greatly restricted it because eighty to eighty-five percent of the population at this time was illiterate.  Therefore, this literacy requirement counteracted the other democratic advances of the ''Savaria Law''.&lt;ref name="Bethell"/&gt;

=====Abolition of slavery=====
The Constitution of the Empire and subsequent laws all failed to deem slaves as citizens.  Instead, slaves were still "excluded from the political community, from exercise of any political right, from all participation in national sovereignty of public authority." &lt;ref name="Chalhoub, 76"&gt;Chalhoub, 76&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Constitution did allow ''libertos''(freed slaves) to vote in elections, provided that they met the property income requirements.&lt;ref name="Chalhoub, 76"/&gt;

Despite its promise to Britain to abolish the slave trade within three years of its 1827 treaty, Brazil continued to import slaves up until the 1850s.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, 13&lt;/ref&gt;  It was only after economic and political conditions permitted, that government initiatives were undertaken to abolish the slavery

November 1866: immersed in the [[Paraguayan War]] and anxious to recruit troops, an Imperial Government decree permits slaves to serve in the [[Brazilian army]], and in return would be granted their freedom unconditionally.&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, the Law of the Free Womb was passed, which declared that all children subsequently born to slave mothers would be free.  A loop hole allowed the master to refuse the government indemnity payment offered for the child at age 8, and thus, retain the child until 21.&lt;ref&gt;Chalhoub, 81&lt;/ref&gt;  The children of slaves who were freed at the age of eight were turned over to the Imperial government and entitled to learn how to read and write in government institutions or through private tutors. However, the masters who opted to retain the children had no obligation to educate them.  This had the effect of excluding them from formal political participation, after their freedom, because of their illiteracy.&lt;ref&gt;Chalhoub, 82&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, the Sexagenarian Law was passed.  This unconditionally freed slaves over sixty.&lt;ref name="Skidmore, 38"&gt;Skidmore, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 1888, [[Isabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil|Princess Isabel]], acting in place of her ailing father [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]], signed the law that abolished slavery in Brazil, granting no compensation to slave owners.  This freed 700,000 slaves.&lt;ref name="Skidmore, 38"/&gt;

====Republican constitution====
The entire executive branch (president, state governor, and municipal prefeito) as well as the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, state assemblies and municipal councils were all elected.  However, fraud, intimidation, violence and the exercise of patronage by local landowners and agents of the grown was widespread. The presidential elections of this period were predetermined by state governors, and state elections were dominated by the Republican parties.  Despite this, and the limitations remaining of suffrage, the early years of the Republic did allow for a substantial advance in direct popular participation in comparison with the late empire.&lt;ref name="Bethell"/&gt;

====From Vargas to the military coup====
The revolution of 1930 effectively ended the Old Republic, and brought [[Getúlio Vargas]] to power.  He undertook a policy which sought to increase political incorporation within Brazil.  Rather than focus on extending political and economic rights, Vargas focused on the expansion of social rights in an attempt to control the process of economic growth and modernization.&lt;ref name="Reis"&gt;Reis&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1931 electoral law lowered the voting age to eighteen and granted woman the right to vote, making Brazil the second country in Americas to do so.  By 1933, the first woman had been elected to the Constituent Assembly.

The 1934 Social Charter in the Constitution guaranteed social rights to certain occupations, while neglecting rural labor and certain urban occupations.  This resulted in a hierarchy of citizenship categories based on occupational prestige, defined along the lines of unequal welfare benefits.&lt;ref name="Mitchell and Wood"&gt;Mitchell and Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

The social rights guaranteed in this charter were closely tied to the urban labor market.  In order to be entitled to health assistance, retirement funds and other welfare benefits it required one to be entered in a formal job contract. This form of regulated citizenship emerged from the government's need to control the process of economic growth and modernization. By granting these social rights the government increasingly drew people into the urban labor market, allowing for economic expansion and development.&lt;ref name="Reis"/&gt; As a result, the state, under Vargas took the lead in promoting nation-building and industrial growth in Brazil.

After a 1945 electoral law was passed, men and women who were formally employed were automatically registered to vote.  This was an attempt to expand political participation among the urban working class, while still largely neglected the rural population.  The same year voting is also made mandatory.

The Constitution of 1946 still restricted political participation on the basis of literacy, disenfranchising more than half of the population as a result.

An act of Congress in 1950 restored individual responsibility over voter registration.  This restricted the political participation of urban workers, who had previously been automatically registered as a result of their employment.&lt;ref name="Bethell"/&gt;

====Military coup of 1964====
One of the key factors responsible for this military coup was the political mobilization of the rural lower classes. This threatened to undermine a tenet central to the government led  modernization, the exclusion of the lower rural classes from citizenship. As a result, the military took power, inaugurating twenty-one years of military dictatorship, which would be marked by further involvement of the state in economic development and political repression.&lt;ref name="Reis"/&gt;

To extend political incorporation the regime tried to generalize access to social rights, first by unifying the welfare system, and also by partially extending social rights to rural laborers.  The continuous growth of the labor market helped incorporate people into the citizenship model based on social rights.

This increasing concentration of populations in urban centers created a strong demand on public goods and services, which was only exacerbated with the economic crisis of the 1980s.  Further adding to the situation, the growth of urban employment in the informal economy not only restricted access of social rights to this segment of the population, but weakened the tax basis for the welfare state.&lt;ref name="Reis"/&gt;  Under these circumstances, the minority with secured jobs and access to social rights essentially became a privileged segment of the population. This only increased the political, social, and economic inequality that characterized Brazil.

==Democracy==
1985 saw the return of civilian rule following the election of president [[José Sarney]].  Following his elections he passed a series of constitutional amendments which extended suffrage; most notably by removing the literacy requirement that restricted votership.  The municipal elections of 1985 were the first elections in Brazil based on universal suffrage.  The following years the elections of Congress and state governors were also based on universal suffrage. These developments represented an important step towards the institutionalization of democracy in Brazil.&lt;ref name="Mitchell and Wood"/&gt;

===Constitution of 1988===
The promulgation of a new constitution in 1988, marked the formal shift from a military dictatorship to a democracy in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler&lt;/ref&gt;  It was followed in 1989 by the first direct presidential elections in thirty years, and the first presidential elections to be based upon universal suffrage.

It lifted official barriers to political participation and formally protected political rights.  Like the constitutions before it, it denies status privileges and reaffirms the inviolability of private property and equality of all citizens before the law. It also strengthened the ''Afonso Arinos Law.'' Originally passed in 1951, it sought to punish racial discrimination by redefining racist practice as a crime rather than just a misdemeanor.  Under the new constitution it went further, denying bail to those convicted of racial or colour prejudice, and stipulating prison sentences.&lt;ref name="Bethell"/&gt;

The constitution also restricted the power of the military, bolstered individual rights, and implemented means to protect marginalized groups.

==Racial inequality in Brazil==
Poverty and inequality are persistent in Brazil, largely as a result the legacy of Portuguese colonialism and its dependence on slave labor. The social, economic and political development of Brazil only tended to increase inequality, primarily among the non-white population. "[It is] clear that the darker a Brazilian, the more likely he [is] to be found at the bottom of the socio-economic scale by every indicator- income, occupation, education [...] subtle but unmistakable discrimination in social relations remain[...] although it has never been codified since the colonial era."&lt;ref&gt;Skidmore&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the transition from military dictatorship to democracy in Brazil, there remains a discrepancy between formal principles of the state the actualities of democracy in practice.&lt;ref&gt;inequalities&lt;/ref&gt;  The effects of skin color exemplify this fact, often perpetuating the inequalities that universal citizenship claimed to remove.  Within Brazil, a large proportion of the population still lack basic citizenship rights, such as access to education. As a result, new forms of citizenship are developing independent of state control, like the situation in the [[favelas]].

There is a growing social, political, economic and spatial exclusion of people living in informal urban settlements like favelas.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, 36&lt;/ref&gt;  As the state withdraws from providing social services from these areas, family and social networks step in and fill the gap.  This caused a growing informalization of political activity among these groups, whereby these citizens identify their participation in the local community as the core feature of citizenship. They have moved them away from the national discourse of rights-based democratic practices as their definition of citizenship, towards one expressed through specific forms of community participation.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indians===
Since the time of European colonization, Indians have been marginalized spatially, politically, and economically.  During the colonial period, the policy towards Indians was to exterminate them or to contain them in church settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 149&lt;/ref&gt; From the establishment of the republic on, the state has actively pursued a policy aimed at assimilating these native groups, and integrating them into Brazilian society.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, 151&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of fair-use proposals in Australia''' is a series of Australian government enquiries into the introduction of a "flexible and open" [[Fair Use|''fair use'']] system into Australian copyright law. Between 1998 and 2016, eight enquiries examined, and in most cases recommended, the introduction of fair use in place of the current "[[fair dealing]]" system which allows copyrighted material to be used only if it meets one of four specific purposes as set out in the Act. 

A change to a fair-use system would allow copyright material to be used ''without'' the copyright owner's consent in any circumstances where the use is fair, as judged against four "fairness factors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/5-fair-use-exception/fairness-factors|title=Copyright and the Digital Economy: Chapter 5 The fair use exception|last=Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC)|first=|date=13 February 2014|website=Australian Law Reform Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A re-user need only address the four fairness factors proposed by the [[Australian Law Reform Commission]] and [[Productivity Commission|Productivity Commission,]] which are:
* The purpose and character of the use;
* The nature of the copyright material;
* The amount and substantiality of the part used; and
* The effect of the use on the potential market for, or value of, the copyright material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/our-public-institutions-need-fair-use-laws-20160607-gpdh86.html|title=Our public institutions need fair use laws|last=Bowrey|first=Kathy|date=8 June 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=9 March 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Proponents of the proposed fair-use system describe it as a system which would "...maximise the net benefit to the community",  reinforce that "user interests should also be recognised by Australia’s copyright system",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.org.au/content/47-organisations-agree-fair-use-critical-australia|title=47 Organisations Agree Fair Use is Critical for Australia|last=|first=|date=13 February 2017|website=|publisher=[[Australian Digital Alliance]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that without it, "...the Australian copyright system will always have gaps, always be trying to catch up with new technologies and behaviours."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.libcopyright.org.au/news/australias-libraries-and-archives-support-fair-use|title=Australia’s libraries and archives support fair use|last=|first=|date=21 December 2016|website=|publisher=Australian Libraries Copyright Committee|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further argue that fair dealing is "too limited and prescriptive in nature".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.claytonutz.com/knowledge/2014/february/the-alrc-report-on-copyright-and-the-digital-economy-recommends-broad-fair-use-exception|title=The ALRC report on Copyright and the Digital Economy recommends broad fair use exception|last=|first=|date=|website=www.claytonutz.com|publisher=[[Clayton Utz]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=18 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar fair use systems are also used in countries including Israel, Singapore, South Korea, and Poland.

Opponents of the proposed fair-use system say that it would introduce "significant and unnecessary uncertainty into Australian law”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/aussie-celebrities-join-campaign-to-oppose-fair-use-161205/|title=Aussie Celebrities Join Campaign to Oppose Fair Use|last=Andy|first=|date=5 December 2016|work=[[TorrentFreak]]|access-date=18 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it is "an American legal principle that has enabled large enterprises in the US to use copyright material for free".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copyright.com.au/fair-use/|title=Fair Use|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Copyright Agency Ltd]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] considers its potential introduction of in Australia to be a notable "foreign trade barrier"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://torrentfreak.com/images/mpaa-NTE_filing_-_Oct_25_2017.pdf|title=MPAA Comments Regarding the 2018 National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers|last=|first=|date=2017-10-25|website=|publisher=[[Motion Picture Association of America]]|page=13|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://torrentfreak.com/mpaa-warns-australia-not-mess-with-fair-use-and-geo-blocking-171107/|title=MPAA Warns Australia Not to 'Mess' With Fair Use and Geo-Blocking - TorrentFreak|date=2017-11-07|work=TorrentFreak|access-date=2018-01-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite proactively supporting the existence of the fair use doctrine in the USA through legal action as "...our members rely on the fair use doctrine every day when producing their movies and television shows".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpaa.org/mpaa-and-fair-use-a-quick-history/#.WmIhMZM-eMQ|title=MPAA and Fair Use: A Quick History|last=Sheffner|first=Ben|date=2013-10-23|website=MPAA.org|publisher=[[MPAA]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The copyright exception system – either fair use or fair dealing – is unrelated to [[parallel import|parallel import restrictions]], or the duration of the copyright term, although the three are often conflated in public debates.

== Current approach – "fair dealing" ==
Currently (2017) Australia has a purpose-based approach to exceptions, called "fair dealing". The system contains an explicit list of "technical bespoke copyright exceptions" which means the use of copyrighted material ''without'' the specific consent of the copyright-holder is only allowed if the proposed use is one of a number of specific purposes listed in the [[Australian Copyright Act 1968|Australian Copyright Act]]. The primary purpose-based exceptions are the fair dealing exceptions for:

== Government inquiries ==
From 1998 to 2017 there have been eight Australian government inquiries which have considered the question of whether fair use should be adopted in Australia. Six reviews have recommended Australia adopt a "fair use" model of copyright exceptions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/productivity-commission-to-say-fair-use-could-get-us-ahead-and-end-the-copyright-protection-racket-20161214-gtau3u.html|title=Our copyright laws are holding us back, and there's a way out|last=Martin|first=Peter|date=15 December 2016|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=6 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161214223301/http://www.smh.com.au/comment/productivity-commission-to-say-fair-use-could-get-us-ahead-and-end-the-copyright-protection-racket-20161214-gtau3u.html|archive-date=14 December 2016|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://digital.org.au/content/productivity-commission-draft-ip-report-breakdown|title=Productivity Commission Draft IP Report – the breakdown|last=|first=|date=16 June 2016|website=|publisher=[[Australian Digital Alliance]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; two inquiries specifically into the Copyright Act (1998, 2014); and four broader reviews (both 2004, 2013, 2016).

===AUSFTA===
Both reports from 2004 were in response to the signing of the [[Australia–United States Free Trade Agreement]] (AUSFTA). The AUSFTA's Intellectual Property chapter purported to align Australian copyright law with that of the United States. In doing so, it introduced a number of measures that extended the rights of copyright holders, or as some described them: "the harsher measures of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] 1998 (US) and the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Extension Act]] 1998 (US)". However, Australia did not simultaneously adopt "balancing" features of the United States law which provided rights to copyright users, "such as the higher standard of originality or the open-ended fair use defence of United States law".&lt;ref&gt;Dr Rimmer, quoted at §3.94, in {{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Former_Committees/freetrade/report/index|title=Chapter 3 – Intellectual Property; Final Report on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America|last=|first=|date=5 August 2004|website=Parliament of Australia|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving some media reports to wonder "Why did we gain the restrictions of US copyright law but not the rights?"&lt;ref name="US-style"/&gt;

In response, the two Parliamentary committees tasked with reviewing the AUSFTA implementation recommended that Australia should introduce fair use, "to counter the effects of the extension of copyright protection".&lt;ref&gt;''Recommendation 17'', in {{Cite web|url=http://www3.austlii.edu.au/au/other/jscot/reports/61/chapter16.html|title=Ch 16. Intellectual Property Rights and Electronic Commerce|last=|first=|date=June 2004|website=[[AustLII]]|publisher=Joint Standing Committee on Treaties|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They noted that "the application of a broad, open-ended 'fair use' doctrine, similar to that in the United States, may ... assist in legitimising several commonplace actions undertaken regularly by Australians perhaps unaware that they are infringing copyright."&lt;ref&gt;§3.117, in {{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/Senate/Former_Committees/freetrade/report/index|title=Chapter 3 – Intellectual Property; Final Report on the Free Trade Agreement between Australia and the United States of America|last=|first=|date=5 August 2004|website=Parliament of Australia|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Committees' recommendations on fair use were not adopted, new exceptions were introduced in the [[Copyright law of Australia#Copyright Amendment Act 2006|Copyright Amendment Act 2006]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/caa2006213/|title=COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT ACT 2006 (NO. 158, 2006)|date=|publisher=Austlii.edu.au|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to cover some of these "commonplace actions" such as [[time shifting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s111.html|title=COPYRIGHT ACT 1968 – SECT 111 Recording broadcasts for replaying at more convenient time|date=|publisher=Austlii.edu.au|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[format shifting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca1968133/s110aa.html|title=COPYRIGHT ACT 1968 – SECT 110AA Copying cinematograph film in different format for private use|date=|publisher=Austlii.edu.au|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a new fair dealing for "parody and satire". In introducing the bill to Parliament, the [[Attorney-General for Australia|Attorney-General]] [[Philip Ruddock]] stated that "This will provide some of the benefits that the fair use doctrine provides in the United States under their law."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:%22chamber/hansardr/2006-10-19/0005%22|title=COPYRIGHT AMENDMENT BILL 2006 : Second Reading|last=|first=|date=19 October 2006|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While noting that "Nothing in the AUSFTA would prevent Australia from implementing legislation to raise the level of originality and to introduce a 'fair use' defence to copyright infringement",&lt;ref&gt;§3.105, in ''Chapter 3, Final Report of the FTA''&lt;/ref&gt; the committee understood that IP [[collecting societies]] (including [[Viscopy]], [[Copyright Agency Ltd|CAL]], and [[ARIA]]&lt;ref name="societies"&gt;§3.111–113, in ''Chapter 3, Final Report of the FTA''&lt;/ref&gt;) "oppose any move to adopt a 'fair use' defence"&lt;ref&gt;§3.105, in ''Chapter 3, Final Report of the FTA''&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis that the introduction of a foreign legal concept would "have many additional implications for Australian law", was "an unjustified abrogation of the rights of copyright owners" and would "significantly increase enforcement difficulties".&lt;ref name="societies" /&gt;

In 2012 the Attorney-General of Australia, Hon. [[Nicola Roxon]] referred "the matter of whether the exceptions and statutory licences in the Copyright Act 1968, are adequate and appropriate in the digital environment" to the [[Australian Law Reform Commission]] (ALRC) for investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/inquiries/copyright/terms-reference |title=Terms of Reference |publisher=Australian Law Reform Commission |access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an 18-month review, it recommended the introduction of fair use as it "would streamline our current hotch-potch copyright laws, which aren't designed to cope with the rapid pace of technological change."&lt;ref name="US-style"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/computers/blog/gadgets-on-the-go/why-deny-usstyle-fair-use-copyright-laws-to-australians-20140219-32zx1.html|title=Why deny US-style Fair Use copyright laws to Australians?|last=Turner|first=Adam|date=19 February 2014|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=18 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the broad fair use exception, the ALRC proposed the inclusion of a "non-exhaustive list of illustrative uses or purposes that may qualify as fair use" arging that this, and that the fact that fair use has been in operation in the USA – the world's largest cultural-exporter – for 35 years, would alleviate concerns that Fair use would introduce too much uncertainty for copyright hoders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Australian University sector, in particular, expressed its support for this proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/unis-back-fair-use-copyright/news-story/d46f4718261415e32b203bf334f719ed|title=Unis back ‘fair use’ copyright|last=Trounson|first=Andrew|date=16 February 2014|work=[[The Australian]]|access-date=18 April 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A technology-neutral [[open standard]] such as fair use has the agility to respond to future and unanticipated technologies and business and consumer practices.

Separate but parallel to the review by the ALRC, in 2013 Greens Senator [[Scott Ludlam]] introduced a "catch-all" fair use bill to parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://delimiter.com.au/2013/06/28/ludlam-reveals-catch-all-fair-use-copyright-bill/|title=Ludlam reveals catch-all "fair use" copyright bill|last=LeMay|first=Renai|date=28 June 2013|website=Delimiter|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=0728104a-1948-4519-a88b-c53db213cd90|title=Giving copyright a fair go – the Greens’ way {{!}} Lexology|last=King &amp; Wood Mallesons – Anna Spies|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was not a government bill, and did not proceed to a vote, it lapsed in November of that year on the day of the installation of the new parliament following the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Bills_Legislation/Bills_Search_Results/Result?bId=s928|title=Copyright Legislation Amendment (Fair Go for Fair Use) Bill 2013|last=Commonwealth Parliament|first=|date=|website=|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer affairs organisation [[Choice (Australian consumer organisation)|Choice]] also ran a campaign in support of the ALRC recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://delimiter.com.au/2014/02/14/digital-rights-bodies-back-alrcs-fair-use-call/|title=Digital rights bodies back ALRC's Fair Use call|last=LeMay|first=Renai|date=2014-02-14|website=Delimiter|access-date=2017-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Productivity Commission ===
[[File:Productivity_Commission,_Intellectual_Property_Arrangements,_Inquiry_Report.pdf|thumb|The 2016 Productivity Commission Report ([[CC-by]])&lt;!-- The specific license is written here to clarify for readers that the image ITSELF is not fair use – it is free-licensed. --&gt;]]
In 2015, the Productivity Commission (PC) was tasked by the then Treasurer, Joe Hockey, with investigating whether the "current [Australian Intellectual Property] arrangements provide an appropriate balance between access to ideas and products, and encouraging innovation, investment and the production of creative works".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/intellectual-property|title=Intellectual Property Arrangements|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Productivity Commission; [[Commonwealth of Australia]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its conclusions, published in December 2016, "reignited the copyright wars" in Australia by recommending, among other things, the introduction of fair use and the removal of [[Parallel import|parallel import restrictions]] (PIRs), also referred to as "territorial copyright", on books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/productivity-commission-re-ignites-copyright-wars-by-recommending-fair-use-70708|title=Productivity Commission re-ignites copyright wars by recommending ‘fair use'|last=Suzor|first=Nicholas|last2=Parvez|first2=Shareen|date=21 December 2016|website=[[The Conversation]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/business/writers-and-publishers-voice-opposition-to-new-copyright-proposals-20160429-goias6.html|title=Writers and publishers voice their opposition to new copyright proposals|last=Steger|first=Jason|date=29 April 2016|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|access-date=7 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A formal response from the government to the report is expected in mid-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.greghunt.com.au/Media/MediaReleases/tabid/86/ID/4121/Report-on-Australias-intellectual-property-system-released-for-consultation.aspx|title=Report on Australia’s intellectual property system released for consultation|last=|first=|date=20 December 2016|website=www.greghunt.com.au|language=en-AU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the public debate, the PC's fair use recommendation has been conflated with a number of other aspects of the report. These include the parallel importation recommendation and references to the potential benefits of a significantly shorter copyright term of "15–25 years". Although the PC did not actually recommend such a reduction in either its draft or final reports, and acknowledged that it was not possible under Australia's international obligations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/intellectual-property/draft/intellectual-property-draft.pdf|title=Intellectual Property Arrangements Draft Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Productivity Commission; [[Commonwealth of Australia]]|page=117|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of celebrated Australian authors, including [[Jackie French]] and [[Anna Funder]], argued publicly against a reduction in the [[Copyright expiration in Australia|duration of copyright in Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/the-innovation-this-government-doesnt-want-20161219-gte2ds.html|title=Copyright is worth defending|last=Price|first=Jenna|date=19 December 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=7 March 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Keneally|Tom Keneally]], speaking at the Australian book industry awards in May 2016, stated "The federal government proposes to do something neither the Brits nor Americans propose to do [to] their writers: to slice Australian authors’ copyright to 15–25 years after publication."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/20/authors-condemn-book-copyright-and-import-proposal-as-massive-own-goal|title=Magda Szubanski may leave Australia if changes to book industry go ahead|last=Harmon|first=Steph|date=19 May 2016|work=The Guardian|access-date=7 March 2017|last2=Clark|first2=Lucy|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted the relevant Minister, [[Mitch Fifield]], to reject these claims stating that a reduction of the copyright term "is not something the Government has considered, proposed or intends to do", and moreover that due to its involvement in a range of free trade agreements, Australia "...has no unilateral capacity to alter copyright terms." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mitchfifield.com/Media/MediaReleases/tabid/70/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/1179/Conjecture-on-copyright-changes-unfounded.aspx|title=Conjecture on copyright changes unfounded  &gt; Mitch Fifield, Liberal Senator for Victoria|last=Victoria|first=Mitch Fifield, Liberal Senator for|website=www.mitchfifield.com|language=en-AU|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://publishingperspectives.com/2016/06/australia-copyright-pir-fair-use/|title=Australia's Debate on Book Imports, Copyright and Fair Use|last=Anderson|first=Porter|date=20 June 2016|work=Publishing Perspectives|access-date=7 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com.au/the-turnbull-government-just-killed-off-the-copyright-changes-that-were-freaking-out-authors-2016-5|title=The Turnbull government just killed off the copyright changes that were freaking out authors|last=Thomsen|first=Simon|date=24 May 2016|work=Business Insider Australia|access-date=7 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PC's fair use recommendation has, however, also been strongly objected to in its own rights. One major criticism raised by rights holder representatives is concerns about its potential to reduce royalties paid by Australian schools. Under the current model, a [[Statutory license|statutory licence]] is negotiated, resulting in a payment administered by [[Copyright Agency Ltd]] (CAL) that "equates to about $17 per school student per year or about $30 per tertiary student". Without this payment to authors CAL argues that "there would be less Australian content on our screens, on our bookshelves and in our schools and universities."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On the other hand, the National Copyright Unit representing schools and [[Technical and further education|TAFEs]] contend that a large portion of this payment relates either to material the author of which cannot be identified, or for materials for which royalty payments are not intended or appropriate. For example, in 2011 they noted that "openly available webpages&amp;nbsp;made up&amp;nbsp;81.4%&amp;nbsp;of the total web and non web digital materials that were paid for," (including [[Google Maps]] and [[dictionary.com]]) which resulted in the payment of millions of dollars for activities that would in other countries be considered as not appropriate for remuneration.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smartcopying.edu.au/law-reform/law-reform/yes-australian-schools-do-pay-to-use-free-online-content|title=Yes, Australian schools do pay to use free online content|last=|first=|date=|website=Smartcopying|publisher=National Copyright Unit on behalf of the Copyright Advisory Groups (Schools and TAFEs)|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017 [[Wikipedia]] displayed banners to Australian readers in support of the Productivity Commission's recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/fair-use-wikipedia-targets-australians-in-bid-to-change-the-law-20170521-gw9kzq.html|title=Fair Use: Wikipedia targets Australians in bid to change the law|last=Martin|first=Peter|date=2017-05-21|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=2017-06-11|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017 it was revealed that CAL had "been diverting payments" valued at $15.5 million AUD – obtained between 2013 and 2016 from [[orphan works]] under the educational licensing scheme – to a "fighting fund", which it called the Future Fund, to lobby against fair use, instead of distributing it to authors.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/copyright-agency-diverts-funds-meant-for-authors-to-15m-fighting-fund-20170420-gvol0w.html|title=Copyright Agency diverts funds meant for authors to $15m fighting fund|last=Martin|first=Peter|date=24 April 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=24 April 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20170426/02091437240/australias-copyright-agency-keeps-11-million-meant-authors-uses-it-to-fight-introduction-fair-use.shtml|title=Australia's Copyright Agency Keeps $11 Million Meant For Authors, Uses It To Fight Introduction Of Fair Use|last=Moody|first=Glyn|date=2017-04-27|work=Techdirt|access-date=2017-05-30|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.copyright.com.au/2017/05/quick-update-copyright/|title=A quick update on copyright - Copyright Agency|date=2017-05-10|work=Copyright Agency|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In acknowledging the existence of the fund, CAL stated it would be used to "...run any legal cases that would arise as a result of changes in legislation, and cover operating costs while the law remained unsettled and where there had been a reduction in licence fees".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Universities Australia argued it was "ironic" to fund a campaign against fair use with money obtained through orphan works: “This just goes to show that Australian authors wouldn’t be harmed if universities and schools could rely on a fair-use exception for copying orphan works...If Australia had a fair-use exception, this money would never have been collected in the first place.” [[Kim Williams (media executive)|Kim Williams]], chair of CAL, responded that “The reason for provisioning this money is simple: any board that does not prudently provision for the risk of a calamitous regulatory change … would be guilty of extreme negligence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/copyright-agency-uses-lost-dues-to-fight-fairuse-laws/news-story/b5d370c05d54fbc704bd561d72528d0e|title=Copyright Agency uses lost dues to fight fair-use laws|last=Hare|first=Julie|date=2017-05-27|website=www.theaustralian.com.au|publisher=[[The Australian]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-30|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use-cases ==
Over the course of the various public inquiries, many example use-cases for where fair use would be applicable have been proposed. In some circumstances (such as [[time shifting]]) the use-case has been incorporated as a new exception under fair dealing, but in most instances the situation remains unchanged. Some most commonly raised examples of currently-illegal or paid-for activities which would fall under fair use include:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/intellectual-property/draft/copyright-factsheet.pdf|title=Fact Sheet: Illustrative United States fair uses of copyright works that require a licence in Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Productivity Commission|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=May 2010}}
'''Independent media''' refers to any form of [[media (communication)|media]], such as [[radio]], [[television]], [[newspaper]]s or the [[Internet]], that is free of influence by government or corporate interests. The term has varied applications. Within the [[United States]] and other [[developed country|developed countries]], it is often used synonymously with [[alternative media]] to refer to media that specifically distinguish themselves in relation to the [[mainstream media]]. In international development, the term independent media is used in relation to the development of new media outlets, particularly in areas where there is little to no existing media presence.

==Alternative media==
{{Main|Alternative media}}
In developed countries, alternative media are media that are alternatives to the business or [[state media|government-owned]] [[mass media]]. Proponents of alternative media argue that the mainstream media are [[bias]]ed. While sources of alternative media can also be biased (sometimes proudly so), the bias tends to be significantly different than that of the mainstream media, hence "alternative". As such, [[advocacy journalism]] tends to be a component of many alternative outlets. Because the term "alternative" has connotations of self-marginalization, some media outlets now prefer the term "independent" over "alternative". An independent media means that no one should control and influence its coverage of news.

==In developing countries==
In many [[developing country|developing countries]], the only media available, particularly at the national level, are government-controlled radio and television stations and newspapers. Even if not overtly controlled by the state, outlets may have strong ties to or be influenced by the government. In such situations, it is often difficult to distinguish those outlets that are truly independent from those that are influenced by the government. For example, a newspaper may provide quality, unbiased coverage of the [[economy]], [[health]], and other issues, but still avoid reporting on the government. This issue is particularly compounded by issues of [[self-censorship]], soft censorship, and other subtle government influences.

===Self-censorship===
{{Main|Self-censorship}}
Self-censorship is the act of [[censorship|censoring]] or [[classified information|classifying]] one's own work out of fear of or deference to the sensibilities of others without an authority directly pressuring one to do so. Self-censorship is often practiced by [[film producer]]s, [[film director]]s, [[publisher]]s, [[news anchor]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[musician]]s, and other kinds of [[author]]s. In [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] countries, creators of artworks may remove material that their government might find controversial for fear of sanction by their governments. In [[cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] [[capitalism|capitalist]] countries, self-censorship can also occur, particularly in order to conform to the expectations of the [[Market (economics)|market]]. For example, the editor of a periodical may consciously or unconsciously avoid topics that will anger [[advertiser]]s or the publication's [[parent company]] in order to protect their livelihood.

===Soft censorship===
Soft, or indirect, censorship is the practice of influencing news coverage by applying financial pressure on media companies that are deemed critical of a government or its policies and rewarding media outlets and individual journalists who are seen as friendly to the government.&lt;ref&gt;Center for International Media Assistance, ''Soft Censorship: How Governments Around the Globe Use Money to Manipulate the Media'', http://cima.ned.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/cima-soft_censorship-report.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem goes largely unnoticed, yet can have a dramatic impact on the reporting of media outlets that can otherwise be considered independent.

==Development==
{{Main|Media development}}
Many organizations engage in efforts to help the development of free and independent media in countries around the world. These efforts can take many forms, from funding the establishment of an entirely new media outlet to assisting an existing outlet in improving its [[Journalism#Professional_and_ethical_standards|professional capacity]]. Common efforts at independent media development include: journalist training and education; improving the legal environment for media; efforts to improve the sustainability of existing outlets; [[media literacy]] training; [[digital media]] training and integration; [[Infrastructure#Communications infrastructure|infrastructure]] development; and monitoring and evaluation efforts.

===Media development vs. media for development===
Some development organizations and experts make a distinction between media development and media for development. "Media development" refers to efforts to directly improve the media in a society through the means mentioned above. "Media for development" refers to more indirect efforts at using existing media to convey messages about specific development issues. Such efforts include many [[ICT4D|ICT for Development (ICT4D)]] projects. Media for development has been applied to education, healthcare, business, disaster relief, corruption, minority empowerment, and local community engagement, among other development goals.

===Media development organizations===
While development of the media sector is a common activity of many development organizations, there are a small number that engage in direct media development as their primary purpose. In the U.S., the three main media development implementers are [[Internews]], [[International Center for Journalists]] (ICFJ), and [[International Research &amp; Exchanges Board]] (IREX). In addition, organizations like the [[Center for International Media Assistance]], [[Reporters Without Borders]], [[Article 19]], and others monitor media development efforts and [[freedom of the press]] around the world.

The '''Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1894''' was a piece of [[industrial relations]] legislation passed by the [[Parliament of New Zealand]] in 1894. Enacted by the [[Liberal Government of New Zealand]], it was the world's first compulsory system of state arbitration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monumentalstories.gen.nz/bio_93.html Monumental Stories | Landmark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It gave legal recognition to [[trade unions|unions]] and enabled them to take disputes to a Conciliation Board, consisting of members elected by employers and workers. If the Board's decision was unsatisfactory to either side, an appeal could be made to the [[Arbitration Court]], consisting of a [[High Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]] judge and two assessors, one elected by employers' associations and another by unions. The [[Encyclopedia of New Zealand (1966)|1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand]] stated that: "After some 70 years of operation, the industrial conciliation and arbitration system has become a firmly accepted – perhaps even a traditional – way of determining minimum wage rates and handling industrial disputes. It has been subject to many criticisms from time to time, and occasionally to heavier sectional attacks, but no suggestion for its abolition has ever succeeded in gaining any significant measure of support from the employers' and workers' organisations... or from the community generally."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/1966/L/LabourDepartmentOf/IndustrialRelations/en LABOUR, DEPARTMENT OF - INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS - 1966 Encyclopaedia of New Zealand&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Act remained in force until 1973, but the essential structure it established was current until the [[Fourth National Government of New Zealand|Fourth National Government]] introduced the [[Employment Contracts Act 1991]]

==Prelude to Arbitration==
The [[Origins of Industrial Arbitration in New Zealand|process]] by which the Act came into being needs study in its own right. It is based on a scheme devised by a South Australian politician, [[Charles Kingston]].

==Workings of the Act==
Registration of unions under the Act was voluntary, and unions could choose to remain outside the Act and negotiate directly with employers. If a union registered it was bound to comply with the rulings of the Arbitration Court and could not, for example, strike against terms laid down by it. As a result, in the early 20th century, some militant and/or strong unions chose not to register.  However most unions and their members benefitted from the Act, as few had the power to directly negotiate terms better than those laid down by the Court. The Act forbade the registration of unions where one already existed in the same industry and area. This prevented competition among unions. The Court was also able to make 'awards' which bound all employers and workers in a particular industry, and set down minimum conditions and rates of pay, although organisations not party to the original award could apply for a complete or partial exemption from the award.&lt;ref&gt;1966 Encyclopaedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

==1936 Amendment==
The [[First Labour Government of New Zealand|First Labour Government]]'s 1936 amendment had two major provisions: the 40-hour week and compulsory unionism. Awards could not require more than 40 hours work a week, not counting overtime, and this was to be arranged, where possible, so that no part of the working week fell on a Saturday. Exemptions could be made if a 40-hour week was impractical, but this rarely occurred. The amendment also made it illegal to employ a worker who was not a member of a union bound by the relevant award or agreement for that industry.

==1961 Amendment==
The 1961 amendment, passed by the [[Second National Government of New Zealand|Second National Government]] abolished compulsory unionism. However membership continued to be compulsory when unions and employers agreed that it should be, or if 50% of relevant workers voted for compulsory unionism in their industry. Even in cases where compulsory unionism did not remain in force, employers were still required to prefer union members if they were equally qualified to non-union workers. Hence the amendment had little practical impact.

Cases and controversies shall be heard and determined by a court or panel of not more than three judges (except that the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]] may sit in panels of more than three judges if its rules so provide), unless a hearing or rehearing before the court {{lang|fr|en banc}} is ordered by a majority of the circuit judges of the circuit who are in regular active service.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Most trials in the [[United States District Court]]s are held before a single judge, but there are some circumstances where the trial itself is required to be held before a three judge panel. For example, 28 U. S. C. § 2284(a) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A district court of three judges shall be convened when otherwise required by Act of Congress, or when an action is filed challenging the constitutionality of the apportionment of congressional districts or the apportionment of any statewide legislative body.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Until 1976, three-judge panels heard lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of state and federal statutes, but this practice has largely ended, the major exceptions being apportionment and redistricting cases.&lt;ref&gt;"In the early 1900s Congress began requiring such panels for all lawsuits contesting the constitutionality of state statutes. In 1937 the panels were extended to cases challenging the constitutionality of federal laws. . . . In 1976, however, Congress repealed those three-judge panel laws, finding the procedure too cumbersome and inefficient." [http://canons.sog.unc.edu/?p=7935]&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, if the [[chief judge]] is a member of the panel, that person will chair the panel and call hearings to order; if the chief judge is not on the panel, this duty falls to the senior-most judge. Following oral arguments, the judges will meet briefly to confer and determine what the likely majority opinion in the case will be. If the judge who chairs the panel is in the majority at this time, that judge may assign the writing of the opinion for that case.

Some bodies, such as the British [[leasehold valuation tribunal]], may have judicial functions carried out by a single member. Although most cases  consists of a panel of three; one with a background in property law (generally a solicitor); one with a background in property valuation generally a qualified surveyor; and a layman.

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Kenya]] on 4 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Kenya%20referendum%20date%20set/-/1056/918046/-/1gc3eiz/-/index.html "Kenya referendum date set"], Daily Nation, 14 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10856761 "Kenya votes in referendum on new constitution"], BBC, 4 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Voters were asked whether they approved of a [[Constitution of Kenya|proposed new constitution]], which had been passed by the [[National Assembly (Kenya)|National Assembly]] on 1 April 2010. The new constitution was seen as a vital step to avoid a repetition of the [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis|violent outbursts]] after the [[Kenyan general election, 2007|2007 general elections]].&lt;ref name="earth"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Earthtimes |url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/316931,us-kenya-needs-unified-effort-behind-draft-constitution.html |title=US: Kenya needs unified effort behind draft constitution &amp;#124; Earth Times News |publisher=Earthtimes.org |date=3 April 2010 |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was a victory for the "Yes" campaign, with 68.6% of voters approving the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iebc.or.ke/index.php/2015-01-15-11-10-10/election-results Election Results] IEBC&lt;/ref&gt; The "No" campaign's main spokesman, Higher Education Minister [[William Ruto]], conceded defeat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='No' camp concedes referendum defeat |author=Gekara, Emeka-Mayaka |author2=Menya, Walter |author3=Wanja, Joy |newspaper=Daily Nation |date=5 August 2010 |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/Kenya%20Referendum/-/926046/971494/-/fxedndz/-/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new constitution came into force on 27 August.&lt;ref&gt;Ottilia A. Maunganidze (2012) ''Pouvoir Et Poursuite, Défis Et Opportunités Pour la Justice Pénale Internationale en Afrique SubSaharienne'', Universitätsverlag Göttingen, p114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The [[Constitution of Kenya (1963)|1963 constitution]] was replaced by a [[Constitution of Kenya (1969)|new constitution]] in 1969. This was amended on several occasions, including a 1982 amendment that led to a [[1982 Kenyan coup d'état attempt|coup attempt]]. The amendment saw the addition of a section 2A to the constitution, making Kenya a single-party state under President [[Daniel arap Moi]]. Following protests in the late 1980s, section 2A was repealed in 1991, establishing the multi-party state, and the Constitution has existed unmodified since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Kenya  |last=Firestone |first=Matthew |year=2009 |publisher=Lonely Planet Publications |isbn=1-74104-773-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-r3g6OdLEUC&amp;printsec=frontcover |accessdate=2010-08-05|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was seen as a step forward, the country retained a reputation for [[Corruption in Kenya|corruption]] and many Kenyans desired a completely revised document. This came a step closer to reality in 1998 when a law was passed in [[Parliament of Kenya|parliament]] calling for a review of the constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Firestone p32&lt;/ref&gt; However, little was done to effect this during the remaining years of Moi's administration.

In the run-up to his victory in the [[Kenyan general election, 2002|2002 general elections]], President [[Mwai Kibaki]] made constitutional reform and the anti-corruption drive a key priority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenyan opposition 'to fight corruption' |newspaper=BBC News |date=23 October 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2352563.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite promises to conduct a review early in the parliament, the new government continued to drag its feet. This was due mainly to the presence of senior officials from the previous regime, whose defection had been vital to Kibaki's election success, but who were ultimately unwilling to risk upsetting the status quo.&lt;ref name="Firestone33"&gt;Firestone, p33&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in 2004, a proposed new constitution known as the [[Bomas draft]] was released. This proposed wide-reaching changes to the structure of government, including the transfer of some powers from the President to a newly created post of Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="BBCBomas"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenya's fight for a constitution |author=Matheson, Ishbel |newspaper=BBC News |date=22 July 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4707695.stm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing the loss of power, senior government figures watered down the Bomas draft, leading to widespread opposition, civil unrest and the resignation of several senior members of Kibaki's coalition.&lt;ref name="BBCBomas" /&gt; The revised document was presented to the people in the November [[Kenyan constitutional referendum, 2005|2005 constitutional referendum]], and was defeated.&lt;ref name="Firestone33" /&gt;

Following the referendum, politicians that had campaigned against the draft united to form a new party in opposition, known as the [[Orange Democratic Movement]], after the symbol of an orange, which had been present on the referendum ballot papers to signify a "no" vote. Despite splits, the party appeared to be in a strong position going into the [[Kenyan presidential election, 2007|2007 presidential election]], but was ultimately defeated in controversial circumstances, leading to the violence of the [[2007–2008 Kenyan crisis]].&lt;ref name="earth"/&gt; The peace deal that ended the crisis mandated that the constitutional question be revisited, which led in November 2009 to a new draft. After minor modifications and the passage of the draft through parliament, the referendum date was set for 4 August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenya referendum date set |author=Kariui, Anthony |newspaper=Daily Nation |date=14 May 2010 |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Kenya%20referendum%20date%20set/-/1056/918046/-/1gc3eiz/-/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Question==
The referendum question was announced on 13 May 2010:
{{quote|Do you approve the proposed new Constitution? &lt;br&gt; {{lang-sw|Je, unaikubali katiba mpya inayopendekezwa?}}}}

Voter's choices in response to this question were "Yes" or "No". Due to high rates of [[illiteracy]] in the country, the law required that each response was accompanied by a visual symbol to ensure voters were aware of which choice they were making.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Symbols for referendum out next week |author=Ngirachu, John |newspaper=Daily Nation |date=14 May 2010 |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/politics/Symbols%20for%20referendum%20out%20next%20week%20/-/1064/918614/-/bryvwc/-/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbols chosen for this referendum were colours: green for "Yes" and red for "No".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenya referendum: Its Green vs Red |author=Mathenge, Oliver |newspaper=Daily Nation |date=17 May 2010 |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Kenya%20referendum%20Its%20Green%20vs%20Red/-/1056/919930/-/97l8qpz/-/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be passed, the referendum required a [[Plurality (voting)|simple majority]] overall and at least 25% of votes in five of Kenya's eight provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=New Constitution Nears Approval in Kenya |author=Gettleman, Jeffrey |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=4 August 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/world/africa/05kenya.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campaign==
Most senior figures in the [[Grand Coalition (Kenya)|coalition government]] were supporters of the "Yes" campaign, including President [[Mwai Kibaki]], Prime Minister [[Raila Odinga]], Vice-President [[Kalonzo Musyoka]] and both deputy Prime Ministers, [[Musalia Mudavadi]] and [[Uhuru Kenyatta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Yes' camp unveils its plan for poll victory |author=Barasa, Lucas |newspaper=Daily Nation |date=28 June 2010 |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/Referendum/Yes%20camp%20unveils%20its%20plan%20for%20poll%20victory/-/926046/948558/-/dbguauz/-/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The notable exceptions to this were Minister for Higher Education, [[William Ruto]] and Minister for Information, [[Samuel Poghisio]], who led the "No" campaign along with former president [[Daniel arap Moi]]. These politicians felt the new law would not be good for Kenyans, arguing that the President would still retain excessive powers and that the provisions on land ownership were anti-capitalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Draft law bad for Kenyans, says Ruto |author=Odunga, Dennis |newspaper=Daily Nation |date=19 April 2010 |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Ruto%20says%20draft%20not%20good%20for%20Kenyans/-/1056/902088/-/cysnt3/-/&amp;usg=AFQjCNFSmBW96KAL1pl5guSpGhxhb_oDsg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other major source of opposition to the constitution came from the [[Christianity|Christian churches]], who feared it would lead to the legalisation of abortion, due to a clause permitting abortion for maternal health reasons. The other clause considered contentious by the church was the inclusion of [[Kadhi courts]] for settling some civil issues relating to [[Muslim]] citizens. Although these courts have been present since pre-colonial times, they were not previously enshrined in the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Fruit20100803"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-10849982 | title=Kenyan referendum vote brings out fruity colours | last=Ross | first=Will | date=3 August 2008 | work=BBC | accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conduct==
The run-up to the referendum was largely peaceful, although there were isolated incidents of violence, such as when six people were killed and many more injured in June 2010, in a bomb attack on a rally for the "No" campaign in [[Nairobi]].&lt;ref name="csm20100614"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stack |first=Liam |title = Kenya bomb attacks kill six at constitution rally |work=Christian Science Monitor |date=14 June 2010 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/terrorism-security/2010/0614/Kenya-bomb-attacks-kill-six-at-constitution-rally |accessdate=2010-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Uchaguzi]] organisation was established to monitor the referendum.

The vote took place amid tight security to avoid a repeat of the previous elections' aftermath. There were particular worries in the [[Rift Valley Province]], where tensions between [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]] and [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] populations had caused the worst of the 2007 violence. The vote eventually passed off peacefully, with no reports of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenya's Rift Valley relieved, anxieties remain |newspaper=Reuters Africa |date=6 August 2010 |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE67501Q20100806?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0 |accessdate = 2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion polls==
Opinion polls taken between April and July 2010 showed a consistent lead for the "Yes" campaign, with support ranging between 49% and 64%, compared to a range of 17% — 22% for the "No" campaign.

A '''leave of absence''' ('''LOA''') is a period of time that one must be away from one's primary [[Job (role)|job]], while maintaining the status of [[Employment|employee]]. The term may be used more restrictively to exclude other periods away from the workplace (e.g., [[vacation]]s, [[paid time off]], [[holiday]]s, hiatuses, [[sabbatical]]s, [[working from home]] programs), with LOA used for exceptional circumstances; generally, such an arrangement has a predefined termination at a particular date or after a certain event has occurred.

Generally, paid leaves of absence are given at the request of the employer, or per some statutory or contractual requirement.  Some examples of generally paid LOA include employee injury on the job, [[Grief|bereavement]], [[jury duty]], or if the employer is performing repairs or other activities in the building where the employee normally works which prevents them from performing their [[Duty|duties]].

===Unpaid leave===
Unpaid LOAs are generally at the request of the employee or as a result of suspected misconduct on the part of the employee. A leave of absence may be obtained for a variety of employee-requested reasons, including [[active duty]] call-ups for [[Military reserve force|reserve military]] personnel, or to attend to the health needs of the employee or of a family member of the employee.

In many jurisdictions, it is up to the employer's discretion as to whether or not an employee's request for a leave of absence is approved. In the United States, the [[Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993]] defines certain circumstances under which approval of a leave of absence is compulsory. Additionally, the [[Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act]] (USERRA) dictates certain circumstances under which a LOA must be granted.

During periods of time where the employer's market is sluggish, some employers offer certain classes of employees an opportunity to take an unpaid leave of absence as extra vacation time, in an effort to temporarily reduce [[operating expense]]s without the complications of performing a [[layoff]], and potentially losing critical employees permanently. Such a period is referred to as a ''leave of absence in lieu of layoff''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://webapps.dop.state.nj.us/camps/help/updates06/apr24/leaveofabsence.pdf NJ State CAMPS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614043803/https://webapps.dop.state.nj.us/camps/help/updates06/apr24/leaveofabsence.pdf |date=2007-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In academia, "unpaid leave of absence" has no negative connotation. It is used to give the opportunity to a [[professor]] or staff member to assume a non-conflicting position (e.g., political position) without losing his/her original affiliation.

==Continuation of benefits==
Generally, continuation of certain benefits, such as [[Health insurance|medical insurance]], is maintained. Other benefits such as [[Life insurance|Life Insurance]] normally require the employee to pay the premium in order to be continued during the LOA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wright.edu/wrightway/4203.html |title=Wright.edu |publisher=Wright.edu |date=1993-08-05 |accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those benefits that are based on an employee's time in his/ her job, the period of the absence may be included in the tallies of consecutive service for certain benefits. If the time is not included, it is simply omitted from the tally, but not considered a ''break'' in service.

===Types of leave of absence in India===
In India, a Government service holder under the Union Government or any Provincial (State) Government can avail the following types of leave of absence during the service period:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By gconnect team |url=http://www.gconnect.in/orders-in-brief/types-of-leave-available-to-central-govt-employees.html |title=gconnect.in |publisher=gconnect.in |date= |accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Earned Leave : Leave of absence which is earned by the employee by dint of period of duty in service but usually credited in advance to the leave account in two installments per year at a rate 2.5 days per month (30 days per year) . The leaves, if not availed, get accumulated up to 300 days, but no more and also the employee remains entitled to a cash equivalent of the 80 days of such leaves not availed on the day of retirement from service.
* Half Pay Leave: All Government servants are entitled to 20 days of HPL for every completed year of service with all kinds of availed leaves included in the concerned year. These leaves get accumulated, if not availed without limit and credited in advance in two installments per year. They are the basis of calculation of commuted leave available to the employee after completion of one year of service.
* Commuted Leave: Two half pay leaves due can be commuted  to one fully paid commuted leave. Commuted leave not exceeding half the amount of half-pay leave due at any point of time can be taken on certified medical ground. Whereas 90 days of commuted leave can be availed during the entire service period without any certified medical ground.
* Leave Not due: This leave of absence can be availed by an employee in the same manner as that of commuted leave but in advance under good faith on the part of the sanctioning authority that the employee shall clear the debt by accumulation of half pay leave through subsequent years of service till his retirement. Such leave is limited up to a maximum of 180 days at a stretch and 360 days in the entire service life.
* [[Parental leave]] (Maternity Leave, Paternity Leave)
* [[Study Leave]]: Maximum 03 years available after completion of at least 05 years of service.
* Extra Ordinary Leave: Leave when no salary is to be given to the employee because he will be or was absent. This leave is granted to regularize unexplained absence resulting into discontinuation of service or can be opted by an employee when he needs a break and takes time off from duty.
* [[Sick leave|Casual Leave:]] This leave is not strictly a leave because the employee is considered to be on duty and responsible.
* Child Care Leave
* Hospital Leave
* Vacation Department Staff Leave: Employees who work in departments where yearly seasonal vacation is admissible can't earn leave. Other leaves are applicable.
* Special Disability Leave
* Child Adoption Leave

{{Politics of China |expanded = Legislative }}

The '''legislative system of China''' may either refer to the system of laws and regulations generated in China's legal system or more narrowly the system of formulation of such codes by institutions, such as the main legislative body the [[National People's Congress]] (unicameral parliament). 

There are two main legislative-making organs, the National People's Congress and its [[Standing Committee of the National People's Congress|Standing Committee]].

'''The Memorandum of Understanding concerning Conservation Measures for the Eastern Atlantic Populations of the Mediterranean Monk Seal''' is a multilateral environmental [[memorandum of understanding]] (MoU) and entered into effect on 18 October 2007, under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals]] (CMS), also known as the [[Bonn Convention]]. It focuses on the protection of the eastern Atlantic populations of the Mediterranean monk seal. The MoU covers four range states (Mauritania, Morocco, Portugal and Spain), all of which have signed.

== Development of MoU ==

[[File:Monachus monachus distribution.png|thumb|290px|Monk seal distribution]]
Recalling that the [[Mediterranean monk seal]] (''Monachus monachus'') is included in both Appendix I and II of CMS, thus highlighting the need for concerted action and international cooperation among the range states and noting the important ecological role the monk seal plays, an Article IV agreement was signed in [[Adeje, Spain|Adeje, Tenerife, Spain]] on 18 October 2007, in the margins of the CMS meeting on Western African Talks on Cetaceans and their Habitats (WATCH) and came into effect immediately. The agreement is open for signature to all the Atlantic range states.&lt;ref&gt;CMS Press release: http://www.cms.int/news/PRESS/nwPR2007/10_Oct/CMS_Press_Release_Monk_Seal.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Signatories to the Mediterranean Monk Seal MoU:
* Mauritania (18 October 2007)
* Morocco (18 October 2007)
* Portugal (18 October 2007)
* Spain (18 October 2007)

In addition, the CMS Secretariat also signed the MoU (18 October 2007).

== Aim of MoU ==
The MoU is a significant step towards improving the conservation status and the habitat of the eastern Atlantic monk seal throughout its range in cooperation with the four signatories. It aims at providing a legal and institutional framework for the implementation of the Action Plan for the Recovery of the Mediterranean Monk Seal in the Eastern Atlantic.

== Species covered by MoU ==
The MoU covers the eastern Atlantic populations of the Mediterranean monk seal as one of the most threatened marine mammals in the world and listed as [[critically endangered]] on the [[IUCN Red List]]. It is estimated that only 500 specimens remain in the wild. The main threats to the seals are entanglement and mortality in fishing gear, overfishing and direct persecution form humans as well as natural factors like toxic phytoplankton and the deterioration of breeding sites, such as collapsing caves roofs. The isolation of the small remaining populations – experts believe that the two colonies (one on [[Madeira]] and the other on the Cabo Blanco peninsula) do not interbreed – means that the species’ survival is precariously balanced.

== Fundamental components ==
Recognizing that the Mediterranean monk seal is one of the most threatened animals in the world and understanding that the species performs long movements, which makes the survival of the individuals dependent upon the conservation of habitats in the coastal and marine area of all the range states, the signatories decide to work closely together to improve the conservation status of the species and its crucial habitat throughout its range. To this end they will, individually or collectively:&lt;ref&gt;Text of the Mediterranean Monk Seal Memorandum of Understanding: http://www.cms.int/species/monk_seal/Monk_Seal_MoU_with_signatures_En.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Take steps to conserve and, when and where appropriate, to strictly protect the monk seal and to conserve and promote the sustainable use of the habitats essential for its survival
# Take steps to ratify the most relevant international conventions addressing monk seal’s conservation, in order to reinforce the species’ protection
# Implement in their respective countries the provisions of the Action Plan annexed to the MoU as a basis for conserving all populations of the species in the eastern Atlantic
# Facilitate through the Atlantic Monk Seal Working Group, the rapid exchange of scientific, technical and legal information necessary to coordinate conservation measures and to cooperate with recognized experts and scientist, other international organizations and other range states so as to facilitate their work conducted in relation to the MoU and Action Plan
# Assess the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan at regular meetings
# Provide the CMS Secretariat at least every two years with a report on implementation of the MoU in each of their respective countries.

The MoU came into effect immediately (18 October 2007) and will remain in effect indefinitely subject to the right of any signatory to terminate its participation by providing one year’s written notice to all of the other signatories.

== Action Plan and Working Group ==
The text of the MoU states that the Action Plan will include measure to:
* Evaluate the status and threats of monk seals
* Maintain and increase monk seal populations
* Create a network of protected areas for the monk seal
* Promote the regional coordination of actions between the range states

The Action Plan was prepared by the Monk Seal Working Group and approved at the Eighth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties, held in [[Nairobi, Kenya]], November 2005. The plan provides a new focus for monk seal conservation by specifying the commitment of the countries in the species’ distribution range. It lays down the procedures to implement coordinated actions among the signatories, providing a means to combine programmes initiated by different national, local and private organizations. The immediate priority is to arrest the decline of the population and then move to promote the species’ recovery. One of the major features of the plan is the proposal to create a network of Special Areas of Conservation for the Monk Seal (SACMS) to help restore populations.

A Monk Seal Working Group composed of representatives of the four signatory states has been operational since the inception of the MoU and oversees and guides activities undertaken under the MoU and Action Plan. The operation of the Working Group has been financially supported by the Government of Spain, with technical support provided by the Spanish NGO Fundación CBD-Habitat. A meeting of the Working Group in Mauritania in November 2009 agreed some necessary actions, including the identification of relevant competent authorities for the implementation of the MoU, sources of technical advice and options for funding.

== Secretariat ==
The CMS Secretariat – located in [[Bonn, Germany]] – provides the secretary functions.

== Successes and news ==
In the framework of the Action Plan, a Nature Reserve was created in the [[Desertas Islands]] in the Madeira archipelago. This reserve was crucial in increasing the number of monk seals from 6–8 individuals in the 1980s to 25–30 in 2009. Furthermore, the establishment of a no-fishing zone and the elimination of disturbances in the vicinity of breeding grounds have helped raise the number of monk seals in the Cabo Blanco Peninsula from 100 to 200 in the 1997-2009 period.

In 2009 an event of great symbolic and conservation importance took place in the Cabo Blanco Mediterranean Mons seal colony. A pup was born on an open beach. The newborn pup was discovered by the reserve’s monk seal patrol of the CBD-Habitat Foundation. It is the first record of such an event since the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cms.int/news/PRESS/nwPR2009/10_october_09/Monk_seal_pup.pdf .&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, scientist found a colony of rare Mediterranean monk seals at an undisclosed location in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9317000/9317582.stm .&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, conservationists rescued a two-month-old Mediterranean monk seal.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9416000/9416895.stm&lt;/ref&gt; The seal was later on released in the region of the [[Alonnisos Marine Park]] of the Northern Sporades island complex, from where he will begin his journey through the Greek seas.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.athensnews.gr/portal/13/39203 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527160642/http://www.athensnews.gr/portal/13/39203 |archivedate=2011-05-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Daijō-kan}}
The {{nihongo|'''Ministry of Justice'''|刑部省|Gyōbu-shō|lit. "department of penal affairs"}} was a division of the eighth century [[Japan]]ese government of the [[Imperial Court in Kyoto]],&lt;ref&gt;Kawakami, Karl Kiyoshi. (1903). {{Google books|Tm0uAAAAYAAJ|''The Political Ideas of the Modern Japan,'' pp. 36-38.|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; instituted in the [[Asuka period]] and formalized during the [[Heian period]].  The Ministry was replaced in the [[Meiji period]].

==Overview==
The nature of the ministry was modified in response to changing times.  The ambit of the ''Gyōbu-shō'' activities encompassed, for example:
* administration and conduct of trials &lt;ref name="kawakami38"&gt;Kawakami, {{Google books|Tm0uAAAAYAAJ|p. 38 n1,|page=37}} citing [[Ito Hirobumi]], ''Commentaries on the Japanese Constitution,'' p. 87 (1889).&lt;/ref&gt;
* oversight of the determination of the severity of punishments&lt;ref name="kawakami38"/&gt; 
* regulation of the imposition of fines, imprisonments, and penal servitude&lt;ref name="kawakami38"/&gt;

==History==
The duties, responsibilities and focus of the ministry evolved over time. The ''[[ritsuryō]]'' system of laws were interpreted and applied by bureaucracies which distinguished punishment (''gyōbushō'') and censorship (''danjodai'').  These were merged in 1871 when the  {{nihongo|Ministry of Justice|司法省|shihōshō}} was established under the [[Constitution of the Empire of Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis Frédéric ''et al.'' (2005). "Shihōshō" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia,'' p. 855.|page=855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hierarchy==
The Ministry of Justice brought together a judiciary and penal system management.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.temcauley.staff.shef.ac.uk/justmin.shtml Ministry of Justice], Sheffield.&lt;/ref&gt;

The top ritsuryō officials within this ministry structure were:
* {{nihongo|chief administrator of the Ministry of Justice|刑部卿|Gyōbu-kyō}}&lt;ref name="titsingh431"&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|''Annales des empereurs du japon,'' p. 431.|page=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* {{nihongo|Second assistant to the chief of the Ministry of Justice|刑部少輔|Gyōbu-shō}}&lt;ref name="titsingh432"&gt;Titsingh, {{Google books|18oNAAAAIAAJ|p. 432.|page=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{nihongo|Senior Ministry of Justice undersecretary|刑部丞|Gyōbu-no-jō}}&lt;ref name="titsingh432"/&gt;

==Designer food==
'''Designer food''' is a type of novel food that has not existed on any regional or global consumer market before. Instead it has been "designed" using [[biotechnological]] / [[bioengineering]] methods (e.g. [[genetically modified food]]) or "enhanced" using engineered additives. Examples like designer egg, designer milk, designer grains, [[probiotic]]s, and enrichment with [[micronutrient|micro]]- and [[macronutrient]]s and [[designer protein]]s have been cited. The enhancement process is called [[food fortification]] or [[nutrification]].&lt;ref name="Rajasekaran Kalaivani pp. 1–16"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rajasekaran | first=A. | last2=Kalaivani | first2=M. | title=Designer foods and their benefits: A review | journal=Journal of Food Science and Technology | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=50 | issue=1 | date=2012-05-22 | issn=0022-1155 | doi=10.1007/s13197-012-0726-8 | pages=1–16| pmc=3550947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rajasekaran Kalaivani pp. 1–16"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Rajasekaran | first=A. | last2=Kalaivani | first2=M. | title=Designer foods and their benefits: A review | journal=Journal of Food Science and Technology | publisher=Springer Nature | volume=50 | issue=1 | date=2012-05-22 | issn=0022-1155 | doi=10.1007/s13197-012-0726-8 | pages=1–16| pmc=3550947 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finley 1996 pp. 213–220"&gt;{{cite book | last=Finley | first=John W. | title=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | chapter=Designer Foods | publisher=Springer US | publication-place=Boston, MA | year=1996 | isbn=978-1-4613-8034-4 | issn=0065-2598 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-0399-2_19 | pages=213–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designer novel food often comes with—sometimes unproven—[[health claim]]s ("[[superfood]]s").

Designer food must be distinguished from [[food design]], the aesthetic arrangement of food items for marketing purposes.

==European Union==

Novel foods or novel food [[ingredient]]s have no history of "significant" consumption in the [[European Union]] prior to 15 May 1997. Any food or food ingredient that falls within this definition must be authorised according to the Novel Food legislation, Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997R0258:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 258/97 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 January 1997 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients] – consolidated version of [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CONSLEG:1997R0258:20090807:EN:PDF 7.8.2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Applicants can consult the guidance document compiled by the [[European Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31997H0618:EN:NOT Commission Recommendation of 29 July 1997 concerning the scientific aspects and the presentation of information necessary to support applications for the placing on the market of novel foods and novel food ingredients and the preparation of initial assessment reports]&lt;/ref&gt; which highlights the scientific information and the safety assessment report required in each case.

The Novel Food regulation stipulates that foods and food ingredients falling within the scope of this regulation must not:
*present a danger for the consumer,
*mislead the consumer,
*differ from foods or food ingredients which they are intended to replace to such an extent that their normal consumption would be nutritionally disadvantageous for the consumer.

There are two possible routes for authorization under the Novel Food legislation: a full application and a simplified application. The simplified application route is only applicable where the EU member national competent authority, e.g. [[Food Standards Agency]] (FSA) in the UK, believes that the novel food in question is substantially equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biotechnology/novelfood/index_en.htm European Commission &gt; Directorate General for Health and Consumers &gt; Food and Feed Safety]&lt;/ref&gt;

The UK [[Food Standards Agency]] has provided guidance for companies that wish to submit a simplified novel food application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/seguidelines.pdf Guidelines for the presentation of data to demonstrate substantial equivalence between a novel food or food ingredient and an existing counterpart]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of products launched as a result of food or food ingredients authorised under the Novel Food legislation. [[Benecol]], containing phytostanols&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004D0333:EN:NOT Commission Decision of 31 March 2004 authorising the placing on the market of yellow fat spreads, salad dressings, milk type products, fermented milk type products, soya drinks and cheese type products with added phytosterols/phytostanols as novel foods or novel food ingredients]&lt;/ref&gt; and Flora ProActiv, containing [[phytosterol]]s &lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32000D0500:EN:NOT Commission Decision of 24 July 2000 on authorising the placing on the market of 'yellow fat spreads with added phytosterol esters' as a novel food or novel food ingredient]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004D0335:EN:NOT Commission Decision of 31 March 2004 authorising the placing on the market of milk type products and yoghurt type products with added phytosterol esters as novel food ingredients]&lt;/ref&gt; are commercially successful products that help to reduce [[cholesterol]] levels.

Originally, the Novel Food legislation was conceived by the European Commission in response to the arrival of food products derived from [[GM crop]]s. These types of GM derived food are now regulated by separate legislation, Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R1829:EN:NOT Regulation (EC) No 1829/2003 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 September 2003 on genetically modified food and feed]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its current format, exotic fruit and vegetables, which have a long history of safe use outside of the European Union, fall within the definition of a novel food. As a consequence, each of these food products must undergo a safety assessment prior to being marketed. This has long been an issue of contention for food manufacturers and producers outside the EU who view this as an economic trade barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hermann|first=Michael|title=The impact of the European Novel Food Regulation on trade and food innovation based on traditional plant foods from developing countries|journal=Food Policy|year=2009|volume=34|pages=499–507|doi=10.1016/j.foodpol.2009.08.005|url=http://www.biomega.eu/deutschland/plaintext/downloads/090815-the-impact-of-the-european-novel-food-r.pdf|accessdate=27 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426004959/http://www.biomega.eu/deutschland/plaintext/downloads/090815-the-impact-of-the-european-novel-food-r.pdf|archivedate=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biotrade.org/BTFP/btfp-novelfoods.htm biotrade.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301131729/http://www.biotrade.org/BTFP/btfp-novelfoods.htm |date=1 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this situation can be illustrated with baobab (''[[Adansonia digitata]]''). This fruit is wild-harvested across Southern Africa and has a long history of use as a food amongst the indigenous tribes in this continent. Nonetheless, Baobab Dried Fruit Pulp required authorisation under the Novel Food legislation before any food products containing this ingredient could be marketed in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080603122942/http://www.acnfp.gov.uk/assess/fullapplics/baobab Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes: Baobab dried fruit pulp]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baobab Dried Fruit Pulp novel food application, pioneered by [[John Wilkinson (scientist)|John Wilkinson]] of Herbal Sciences International, a botanical regulatory consultancy company, together with their client Phytotrade Africa, was also the first successful submission to demonstrate safety without the need for animal testing. Instead, this application used the history of use alongside detailed analyses of the nutritional and [[phytochemical]] components in Baobab to demonstrate safety.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/baobabapplicationfinal.pdf Baobab Dried Fruit Pulp – An application for Novel Foods Approval in the EU as a food ingredient] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605045936/http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/baobabapplicationfinal.pdf |date=5 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has lowered the costs for approval from an average of €10 million to less than €100,000 and thus opened the EU to access non-Western fruits, vegetables and [[nutraceutical]]s while at the same time saving unnecessary animal testing.

===Revision of the EU novel food regulation===

In 2008, the [[European Parliament]], [[European Commission]], and [[Council of the European Union]] began talks to revise the regulation because it was accepted that essential elements needed to be discussed and resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/food/food/biotechnology/novelfood/initiatives_en.htm Novel Foods - Review of Regulation (EC) 258/97]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the revision came to a standstill on 28 March 2011 when the three Institutions failed to reach agreement at a final conciliation meeting on the issue of cloning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodproductiondaily.com/Quality-Safety/Cloned-animal-row-wrecks-novel-foods-regulation News report on failure of novel foods talks]&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreement centred on the European Parliament being in favour of a total EU market ban on foods from clones and their offspring/descendants, while some members of the Council of the European Union were not in favour as they considered offspring to be bred using normal (or traditional) methods, therefore not falling under the definition of a novel food.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/en/pressroom/content/20110328IPR16525/html/Novel-Foods-talks-collapse-on-Council-refusal-to-label-clone-derived-products Statement from the Parliament on the collapse of the novel foods talks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402063011/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/en/pressroom/content/20110328IPR16525/html/Novel-Foods-talks-collapse-on-Council-refusal-to-label-clone-derived-products |date=2 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the European Parliament, it had tried to compromise, backing down on demands for a full ban on food from cloned animals and their descendants, to mandatory labelling of all food products from clones and their offspring as a bare minimum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/App/Search/searchMeta.aspx?id=1&amp;lang=EN&amp;searchterm=novel+food Statement from the Council on failure of conciliation on novel foods]&lt;/ref&gt; The Council of the European Union decided that the solution presented by the European Parliament could not be implemented in practice because it would not be in compliance with the international trade rules that the European Union has signed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/App/Search/searchMeta.aspx?id=1&amp;lang=EN&amp;searchterm=novel+food Council statement on the failure of conciliation on novel foods]&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to move things forward, the Commission gave up the revision process for the time being. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/novel-foods-review-stumbles-over-cloning/ Novel foods review stumbles over cloning]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 2011 standstill, the Commission decided to table a new proposal in December 2013, limiting its scope to the safety of novel foods, where a general agreement had already been reached in the previous dealing, while deferring the cloning issue to separate legislation. This time, negotiations eventually proved successful&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/parliament-vote-on-novel-foods-heats-up-cloned-animals-debate/ Parliament vote on novel foods heats up cloned animals debate]&lt;/ref&gt;, and the new '''Novel Food Regulation (EC) No. 2015/2283'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1449760581954&amp;uri=OJ:JOL_2015_327_R_0001 Regulation (EU) 2015/2283 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on novel foods]&lt;/ref&gt; was finally approved in November 2015, but will enter into force on January 1, 2018 at the latest, following the adoption by the Commission of required implementation acts. Therefore, as of mid-2017, the current novel food regulation, adopted in 1997, still remains in place.

==Canada==

In [[Canada]], novel foods are regulated under the Novel Foods Regulations. The regulations define novel food as

*Products that have never been used as food,
*Foods that result from a process that has not been previously used for food, or,
*Foods that have undergone genetic modification and have new traits.

The Novel Foods Regulation requires that a company wanting to sell a novel food notify Health Canada prior to marketing or advertising the product. Pre-market notification permits Health Canada to conduct a thorough safety assessment of all [[Genetically modified food|biotechnology-derived foods]] to demonstrate that a novel food is safe and nutritious before it is allowed in the Canadian marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/gmf-agm/fs-if/index-eng.php Health Canada Factsheets and Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;

To date, more than 90 novel foods have been approved for sale in Canada including a number of [[canola]], [[corn]], [[cottonseed]] and [[flax]] crop lines. Some of the novel traits include herbicide tolerance and pest and disease resistance. In spite of the benefits brought about by the development of novel foods, there are also a number of concerns that have been raised concerning their potential impact on the environment and on human health and safety.

===Novel Food startup===
In 2018 was born DL Novel Food the first startup for the automation of insects livestocks. &lt;ref&gt;[http://dlnovelfood.com/en/home-2/]&lt;/ref&gt;

As described in the ruling and media coverage, the firm's ''[[modus operandi]]'' was to threaten individual members of the public with litigation (hence public exposure) over allegations that they breached copyright during pornographic downloads (based, according to the court, on a "statistical guess").&lt;ref name="Wright ruling 06may2013"/&gt;{{rp|FOF.10 p.5}}&lt;ref name="boingboing" /&gt; The firm would then offer to settle the case (silently) for a little below the cost of an active legal defense,&lt;ref name="Wright ruling 06may2013"/&gt;{{rp|1–2}} in what was described by the court as an "extortion payment".&lt;ref name="keller"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140308055107/http://thekellerlawfirm.com/tales-of-the-trolls-a-four-part-series-on-internet-patent-and-copyright-trolling-part-4-copyright-trolls/ Tales of the Trolls: A Four-Part Series on Internet, Patent, and Copyright Trolling – Part 4: Copyright Trolls] - Keller Law Firm, Firm official blog, series on legal aspects of trolling (undated): "Prenda would send letters threatening suit to individuals who illegally downloaded porn, a threat magnified through the potential for 'negative publicity' (e.g. now everyone knows you as the person being sued for downloading porn).

The amount demanded was usually slightly less than a typical attorney would charge to defend the case on its merits (as alluded to in the ruling on ''Ingenuity 13'' (''[[#Ruling and subsequent events in the Ingenuity 13 case|below]]'')), so under the "[[American rule (attorney's fees)|American rule]]" for [[legal costs]] even the completely innocent would have a strong incentive to pay what Los Angeles-based U.S. District Judge [[Otis D.

It was later testified and ruled in various courts that many (although not all) of the firm's purported "clients" or "plaintiffs" only appeared to exist as [[shell company|shell companies]] or "[[Front organization|fronts]]" for the principals themselves, and that in effect the principals had been litigating on their own behalf.&lt;ref name="white11mar" /&gt; Signatures and representatives purported to be of clients, were ruled to be falsified, with at least one identity "stolen" and one purported "representative" excluded from court.

(Original creator: Morgan Pietz, defense attorney for Doe)]]

==="Ingenuity 13" case ===
In November 2012, Morgan Pietz was engaged as defense attorney against a case brought by Ingenuity 13, a Prenda "client". He stated that, in the course of case preparation, he noticed various anomalies within Prenda's past litigation. In one Florida case (''Sunlust vs. Nguyen'') decided November 2012, a Prenda employee, Mark Lutz, had also self-identified as the "representative" of pornography producer Sunlust Pictures but been unable to describe his principal or the client in any manner, nor state who paid him, and was ultimately excluded from the court case.&lt;ref name="Scriven transcript" /&gt;{{rp|p.14–18,20}} Additionally when Prenda attorney John Steele visited the court and Lutz kept whispering to him, causing the judge to eventually ask Steele to identify himself, Steele had answered evasively, not disclosing his connection to the firm or the case.&lt;ref name="Scriven transcript" /&gt;{{rp|p.11–14}} The case was [[Motion (legal)#Motion to dismiss|dismissed]] as an "attempted [[fraud upon the court|fraud on the court]]", with the court also inviting a motion against Prenda principal Paul Duffy for "lack of candor".&lt;ref name="Scriven transcript" /&gt;{{rp|p.20–21}} Pietz described these as "the first thing [he] started to wonder about".&lt;ref name="businessweek"&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-05-30/prenda-law-the-porn-copyright-trolls Bloomberg BusinessWeek feature: Prenda Law, the Porn Copyright Trolls], 2013-05-30]: "When the judge asked Steele to identify himself, he said, 'I no longer actively practice law.' [...] 'John Steele says he's just an interested member of the public?' Pietz asks. That was the first thing I started to wonder about."&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.3}} An attempt to investigate the [[offshore company|offshore-registered]] plaintiff in his case, Ingenuity 13, also suggested that "someone had something to hide", as its owners and even the source of its copyrights had been heavily obscured.&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt;{{rp|p.3}} Pietz further discovered a recent claim in a [[Minnesota]] court by a man called Alan Cooper, who stated that his name and signature had been falsely used as owner-of-record for Ingenuity 13 and another Prenda client&lt;ref name="godfread2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt;{{rp|p.3}} (a tape recording in which Steele threatened Cooper with litigation was played as evidence in court).&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt;{{rp|p.3}} Finally, an email dialog between Pietz and Ingenuity 13's attorney Brett Gibbs in which Pietz asked for clarification about the identity of "Alan Cooper" and sight of originals of documents certified as having been signed by "Alan Cooper", was [[stonewalling|stonewalled]] in what court onlookers described as a "rambling", "confused" and evasive manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121212/00354121354/copyright-troll-prenda-law-dances-around-simple-question-which-alan-cooper-runs-af-holdings.shtml Copyright Troll Prenda Law Dances Around The Simple Question: Which Alan Cooper Runs AF Holdings] - Mike Masnick, TechDirt, 2012-12-12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="defensedec18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars2012"&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/12/porn-trolling-firm-dogged-by-identity-theft-allegations/ Porn trolling firm dogged by identity theft allegations: Prenda Law stonewalls on claim that it named man CEO without his permission] Ars Technica, Timothy Lee, 2012-12-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Brett Gibbs had also been one of the Prenda attorneys named in the ''Sunlust'' hearing.&lt;ref name="Scriven transcript" /&gt;{{rp|p.7,11–12}}

Wright II|Judge Otis Wright]], who declined the response to Pietz's defense and ordered Ingenuity 13 to show that the basis of its case, and its manner of identifying alleged offenders, was sufficient to safeguard innocent persons and subscribers from "simple coercion" and "harassment" (described as "the easy route").&lt;ref name="kenwhite6mar" /&gt; Prenda in response tried and failed to get the judge removed and also to sue Cooper for defamation,&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt;{{rp|p.3}} but also "conspicuously avoid[ed] direct engagement" with the more serious counterclaims.&lt;ref name="kenwhite6mar" /&gt; Hansmeier eventually testified of one Prenda plaintiff company, that its business was buying copyrights in order to litigate against their downloaders,&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt;{{rp|p.3}} and that it had never paid any tax.&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt;{{rp|p.3}} Prenda also sought to end the case by requesting [[Motion (legal)#Motion to dismiss|dismissal]], which was also declined.&lt;ref name="kenwhite6mar" /&gt;

On February 7, 2013 the court instead ordered plaintiff's attorney Brett Gibbs to attend a hearing, in order to answer questions concerning the firm's conduct in the case. "More ominously" according to a legal onlooker,&lt;ref name="kenwhite6mar" /&gt; it also stated that "the Court perceives that Plaintiff may have defrauded the Court" based on Pietz's evidence, and that based upon testimony presented by and about the plaintiffs at the next hearing, "the Court will consider whether sanctions are appropriate, and if so, determine the proper punishment. This may include a monetary fine, incarceration, or other sanctions..."&lt;ref name="kenwhite6mar" /&gt; As well as the plaintiffs and Gibbs as their attorney, Steele, Hansmeier and his brother (who acted as a Prenda forensic investigator), Duffy, Lutz, and Cooper were also among those ordered by the court to attend.&lt;ref name="kenwhite6mar" /&gt;

On March 11, 2013, Wright's courtroom manner was described by attorney-blogger and past prosecutor Ken White on ''[[Popehat (blog)|Popehat]]'', who had followed the case, as "a federal judge who was furious, intimately familiar with the case, and consummately prepared for the hearing... [and] made it explicitly, abundantly, frighteningly clear that he believes the principals of Prenda Law have engaged in misconduct – and that he means to get to the bottom of it."&lt;ref name="white11mar"&gt;[http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130311/19422822287/deep-dive-analysis-brett-gibbs-gets-his-day-court-prenda-law-is-star.shtml Deep Dive Analysis: Brett Gibbs Gets His Day In Court -- But Prenda Law Is The Star] - Ken White, ''[[Popehat (blog)|Popehat]]'', TechDirt, 2013-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Alan Cooper testified first, that he had not signed or seen any papers related to Prenda, that "Alan Cooper" signatures on documents were not his, that he looked after one of John Steele's houses, and that Steele had stated he wanted to earn "$10,000 a day" litigating against downloaders, and that when Cooper had attempted to legally clarify that he was not the signatory of Prenda's documents, Steele began an escalating series of texts and voicemails whose interpretation (to White) clearly appeared to be intimidating Cooper into "back[ing] off".&lt;ref name="white11mar"/&gt; AT&amp;T and Verizon, two major ISPs, testified that [[Stay of proceedings|stay]]s (court orders from other Prenda cases) had been ignored by Prenda and they were kept unaware of their issue.&lt;ref name="white11mar" /&gt; On the topic of Prenda's finances, Wright made clear that he viewed the clients as [[wikt:sham|sham]]s that neither received settlement payments nor paid tax on any settlements, and that Prenda "basically prosecuted on their own behalf".&lt;ref name="white11mar" /&gt; Of the four main Prenda attorneys, only Gibbs attended and testified, coming across to White as "a young attorney out of his depth who fell in with the wrong crowd", but whose testimony in his own defense was contradicted at the hearing (Gibbs stated that he only had limited involvement in Prenda client "AF Holdings" but attorney Jason Sweet in the audience then stated to the court that Gibbs had previously self-identified as AF Holdings "national counsel").&lt;ref name="wrighttranscript11mar" /&gt;{{rp|p.93–94}}&lt;ref name="white11mar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:G8WfRpcz5vIJ:www.popehat.com/2013/04/08/prenda-law-let-the-other-shoes-hit-the-floor Prenda Law: Let The Other Shoes Hit The Floor] - Ken White, 2013-04-13: "[Jason] Sweet... during the March 11 hearing... stood up from the gallery to tell Judge Wright that Brett Gibbs had, in fact, represented himself as "national counsel" for Prenda."&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2013, when Steele, Hansmeier and Duffy attended, the scrutiny of the court run by Judge Wright – who had sat on around 45 previous Prenda cases&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt;{{rp|p.3}} – had therefore long moved to "getting to the bottom" of the firm, rather than the specific case,&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt;{{rp|p.3}} and Wright opened by stating, "It should be clear by now that this court's focus has now shifted dramatically from the area of protecting intellectual property rights to attorney misconduct[,] such misconduct which I think brings discredit to the profession. That is much more of a concern now to this court than what this litigation initially was about."&lt;ref name="kenwhite"&gt;[https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130402/12223322549/deep-dive-prenda-law-is-dead.shtml Deep Dive: Prenda Law Is Dead] - by Ken White, a litigator and defense attorney, 2013-04-02, published at TechDirt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ingenuity0413transcript"&gt;[http://blog.muddlawoffices.com/mloblog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/2013-04-02-Transcript.pdf ''Ingenuity 13 v.

However, the latter then chose to fall back upon their legal right to avoid [[self-incrimination]] under the Fifth Amendment,&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt;{{rp|p.3}}&lt;ref name="ingenuity0413transcript" /&gt;{{rp|p.7–9}} rather than answer questions of fact from the judge about the ownership, operations, and finances, of Prenda and its affiliates.&lt;ref name="kenwhite" /&gt; Ken White, who had followed and documented the case, commented on April 2, 2013:&lt;ref name="kenwhite" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Their invocation of their Fifth Amendment rights in the face of that order is utterly unprecedented in my experience as a lawyer. In effect, the responsible lawyers for a law firm conducting litigation before a court have refused to explain that litigation to the court on the grounds that doing so could expose them to criminal prosecution. However well grounded in ... individual rights ... the invocation eviscerates their credibility... I expect that defense attorneys will file notice of it in every state and federal case Prenda Law has brought... The message will be stark: the attorneys directing this litigation just took the Fifth rather than answer another judge's questions about their conduct in this litigation campaign.&lt;ref name="kenwhite" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite the ongoing case, by May 30, 2013 according to ''[[BusinessWeek]]'', Prenda Law had changed its name to the Anti-Piracy Law Group, and switched its continuing actions to state courts, ''BusinessWeek'' commenting that state court cases are not centrally listed or as easily found compared to Federal court cases.&lt;ref name="businessweek" /&gt;{{rp|p.4}}

====Ruling and subsequent events in the Ingenuity 13 case====
[[File:Gibbs declaration.jpg|thumb|height200|Attorney Brett Gibbs claimed to have—but never produced—an original notarized signature of "Alan Cooper, Manager of Ingenuity 13 LLC."&lt;ref name="Pietz Motion"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/download/gov.uscourts.cacd.543744/gov.uscourts.cacd.543744.23.0.pdf | title=Ex Parte Application For Leave To Take Early Discovery | publisher=[[U.S. District Court]] | date=December 18, 2012 | accessdate=April 5, 2013 | author=[[Morgan Pietz|Pietz, Morgan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pietz Order"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/download/gov.uscourts.cacd.543744/gov.uscourts.cacd.543744.32.0.pdf | title=Order Granting Ex Parte Application | publisher=[[U.S. District Court]] | date=December 26, 2012 | accessdate=April 5, 2013 | author=[[Otis D. Wright II|Wright, Otis D. II]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On May 6, 2013, [[Otis D. Wright II|Judge Wright]] sanctioned Prenda Law and its "principals" Steele, Hansmeier, and Duffy, along with Gibbs, whom he termed "attorneys with shattered law practices", $81,319.72 (of which half was punitive)&lt;ref name="Wright ruling 06may2013"/&gt;{{rp|p.10}} for "brazen misconduct and relentless fraud", "vexatious litigation", "[stealing] the identity of Alan Cooper", and "representations about their operations, relationships, and financial interests [that] varied from feigned ignorance to misstatements to outright lies".&lt;ref name="Wright ruling 06may2013"/&gt; Wright also referred the attorneys to the [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]]'s office and the [[IRS Criminal Investigation Division|Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation Division]] for possible criminal prosecution; and to various federal and state bars for "[[moral turpitude]] unbecoming of an [[officer of the court]]".&lt;ref name="Wright ruling 06may2013"/&gt;{{rp|p.10}} He also noted that Steele, Hansmeier, and Duffy had pleaded the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] privilege against self-incrimination when questioned.&lt;ref name="ArsTechnica 4/2/13"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/prenda-porn-trolls-clam-up-as-their-plans-crumble-in-an-la-courtroom/ | title=Judge smash: Prenda's porn-trolling days are over | last=Mullin | first=Joe | publisher=[[Ars Technica]] | date=April 2, 2013 | accessdate=April 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge Wright also found that the attorneys "purposely ignored" his orders quashing subpoenas to ISPs so that ISPs would be "unaware of the vacatur and would turn over the requested subscriber information"; and had created sham companies such as "AF Holdings LLC" and "Ingenuity 13 LLC" "to give an appearance of legitimacy" to their pursuit of "easy money".&lt;ref name="Doctorow"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boingboing.net/2013/03/07/mind-croggling-deposition-of-a.html | title=Mind-croggling deposition of a Prenda Law copyright troll | publisher=[[Boing-Boing]] | date=March 7, 2013 | accessdate=March 12, 2013 | author=[[Cory Doctorow|Doctorow, Cory]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a footnote, Wright wryly observed that the punitive portion of the award "is calculated to be just below the cost of an effective appeal", a nod to his finding that plaintiffs' settlement demands were set "just below the cost of a bare-bones defense".&lt;ref name="Wright ruling 06may2013"/&gt;{{rp|p.10 note 5}}

Wright's order was replete with ''[[Star Trek]]'' references: 

{{quote|It was when the Court realized Plaintiffs engaged their cloak of [[shell corporation|shell companies]] and fraud that the Court went to battlestations... As evidence materialized, it turned out that Gibbs was just a [[Redshirt (character)|redshirt]]... [Though] Plaintiffs boldly probe the outskirts of law, the only enterprise they resemble is [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] (a reference to federal criminal statutes regarding 'racketeer-influenced and corrupt organizations'&lt;ref name="loweringthebar1" /&gt;). The federal agency eleven decks up (the U.S. Attorney's office on the 13th floor of the Los Angeles federal courthouse) is familiar with their prime directive and will gladly refit them for their next voyage.&lt;ref name="Wright ruling 06may2013"/&gt;{{rp|p.2, 10–11}}}}

Prenda, and attorney Paul Hansmeier, filed an "emergency motion" in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] seeking a stay of Judge Wright's sanctions order; it was denied without prejudice to the sanctioned parties' right to request a stay in Judge Wright's court. They then filed an [[ex parte]] motion seeking a stay from Wright. On May 21, 2013, Wright responded by ordering each sanctioned party ("Steele, Duffy, Hansmeier, Gibbs, AF Holdings, Ingenuity 13, and Prenda") to pay an additional $1,000 per day (to the clerk of the court), on top of the previously ordered $81,319.72 payable to John Doe's attorneys, until all sanctions are fully paid.&lt;ref name="TechDirt 5/21/13"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130521/15164823159/bad-day-prenda-continues-judge-rejects-stay-adds-1k-per-day-each-day-they-dont-pay-up.shtml |title=Bad Day For Prenda Continues: Judge Rejects Stay, Adds $1k Per Day For Each Day They Don't Pay Up |publisher=[[TechDirt]] |author=[[Mike Masnick|Masnick, Mike]] |date=May 21, 2013 |accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansmeier's application for admission to the bar of the Ninth Circuit was also provisionally denied by a court commissioner, citing his referral to professional bar and discipline committees, based on Judge Wright's finding of "moral turpitude". Hansmeier had sought admission to the Ninth Circuit bar in order to represent his wife in her objection to a class-action settlement, but was told he may not do so.&lt;ref name="ArsTechnica 5/20/13"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/05/prenda-lawyer-gets-kicked-off-9th-circuit-case/ | title=Prenda Lawyer Gets Kicked Off 9th Circuit Case | last=Mullin | first=Joe | publisher=[[Ars Technica]] | date=May 20, 2013 | accessdate=May 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2013, attorneys Steele, Hansmeier, and Duffy secured and posted a [[supersedeas bond|bond]] of $101,650 on behalf of themselves, Prenda Law Inc., Ingenuity 13 LLC and AF Holdings LLC (but not Gibbs), to guarantee payment of Judge Wright's sanctions order if upheld on appeal.&lt;ref name="ArsTechnica 5/31/13"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/05/prenda-buys-a-100000-bond-while-former-lawyer-gibbs-pleads-for-leniency/ | title=Prenda buys a $100,000 bond, while former lawyer Gibbs pleads for leniency | last=Mullin | first=Joe | publisher=[[Ars Technica]] | date=May 31, 2013 | accessdate=June 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of the bond was later raised to a total of $237,584 to cover a possible attorney fee award on appeal; the Prenda parties' appeal of this order was denied, 2-1, by a three-judge Ninth Circuit motions panel.&lt;ref name="ArsTechnica 7/10/13"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/07/prendas-motion-to-reduce-238000-appeal-bond-falls-flat/ | title=Prenda's motion to reduce $238,000 appeal bond falls flat | last=Mullin | first=Joe | publisher=[[Ars Technica]] | date=July 10, 2013 | accessdate=July 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased bond was to be filed by July 15, 2013.

====Appeals against monetary sanctions====
On October 17, 2013, Brett Gibbs offered a [[sworn statement]], an unsworn motion, and alleged documents and claims concerning Prenda and its principals as part of an appeal against his sanction.&lt;ref name="gibbssanctionsappeal2"&gt;[http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/806132/gov-uscourts-cacd-543744-240-1.pdf MOTION FOR INDICATIVE RULING VACATING MAY 6,  2013 ORDER ISSUING SANCTIONS AGAINST MOVANT BRETT L.

GIBBS SUPPORTING MOTION FOR INDICATIVE RULING, case 2:12-CV-08333-ODW (JCx), 2013-10-17]&lt;/ref&gt; The allegations and claims included:
* that Gibbs had openly and repeatedly testified at multiple cases and hearings, including testimony damaging to the firm's case such as identifying the voice recordings in ''AF Holdings v. Patel'' as being John Steele
* that Steele and Hansmeier tried to coerce or buy his silence and gain his dishonest representations in support of their position in return for covering his sanction bond, and had also tried to intimidate or discredit him (via "virtually fact-free" Bar complaints), but he had refused
* that he included for the court what he claimed to be in-house emails showing private communications within the firm, and [[financial statement]]s showing over $1.9&amp;nbsp;million in settlement income in 2012
* that around 70% of all settlement monies (80% when other payments were added) had been paid to Steele and Hansmeier or their jointly-owned company, although this left Prenda with a loss of almost $0.5&amp;nbsp;m for the year, which was inconsistent with the claim that these were [[arms length]] payments to previous owners
* that "it appears that neither the [[Income statement|Profit and Loss]] Detail nor the [[Balance Sheet]] Detail show any payments to AF Holdings, Ingenuity 13 or other Plaintiffs represented by Prenda [which] supports the conclusion that these companies were not independent entities, but rather alter egos of Steele and Hansmeier."&lt;ref name="gibbssanctionsappeal2" /&gt;{{rp|p.9 + footnote}}
* that Duffy, not a known "old owner", was described and paid internally as an "old owner"&lt;ref name="gibbssanctionsappeal2" /&gt;{{rp|footnote 8}}
* that court orders had also been ignored in cases he was not involved
* and a plea that his testimony had been valuable and his errors were due to unintended ignorance and in one case, personal error, and that he would testify on these if required.&lt;ref name="gibbssanctionsappeal2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gibbssanctionsappeal1" /&gt;

The defendants claimed that while his wrongdoings were of a lesser scale, they were not trivial, and opposed lifting of the entire sanction. On November 7 Gibbs' request was granted and the monetary part of his sanctions withdrawn ("vacated") due to his "dissociation".&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/cacdce/2:2012cv08333/543744/246/0.pdf ORDER VACATING MAY 6, 2013 MONETARY SANCTIONS AGAINST BRETT L. GIBBS [244], case 2:12-cv-8333-ODW(JCx), Nov 7 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 18, 2013, the three principals appealed their sanctions, on the basis that the court had erred in combining elements of a civil and criminal hearing, in effect choosing elements of each and thereby failing to meet the requirements for a number of actions taken. Their claims included:

* if fixed penalties were proposed or imposed, these would be criminal and not civil responses and required [[contempt of court|contempt]] hearings
* that the defense lawyer acted in effect as a prosecutor but lacked the requisite disinterest
* that no substantial evidence was presented for the conclusions about plaintiff company ownership
* that abrupt termination of hearings and refusal to hear certain persons had meant important testimony was not heard or cross-examined
* that a number of the procedural failings were due to Gibbs and not the three principals
* and that the court had generally exceeded its authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pietzlawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/17-1-Opening-Brief-on-Appeal-No-Attachments.pdf Ingenuity 13 et al, brief for appellants, 2013-11-18] - cases 13-55859, 13-55871, 13-55880, 13-55881, 13-55882, 13-55883, 13-55884 and 13-56028&lt;/ref&gt;

The appeal, styled ''Paul Hansmeier, Esq. v. John Doe'', was heard before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals on May 4, 2015. A video recording&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_video.php?pk_vid=0000007584&lt;/ref&gt; of the oral argument is publicly available.

The Ninth Circuit held that:
{{quote|"The district court did not abuse its discretion in finding bad faith and sanctioning the Prenda Principals under its inherent power. ... Based on the myriad of information before it—including depositions and court documents from other cases around the country where the Prenda Principals were found contradicting themselves, evading questioning, and possibly committing identity theft and fraud on the courts—it was not an abuse of discretion for Judge Wright to find that Steele, Hansmeier, and Duffy were principals and the parties actually responsible for the abusive litigation. Similarly, it was not an abuse of discretion for Judge Wright to find that the Prenda Principals were indeed the leaders and decision-makers behind Prenda Law's national trolling scheme. ... Judge Wright found, inter alia, that the Prenda Principals 'demonstrated their willingness to deceive not just this [c]ourt, but other courts where they have appeared,' and 'borrow[ed] the authority of the [c]ourt to pressure settlement.' ... The doubling of the attorney's fees award was also appropriate. ... The Prenda Principals have engaged in abusive litigation, fraud on courts across the country, and willful violation of court orders. They have lied to other courts about their ability to pay sanctions. They also failed to pay their own attorney's fees in this case."&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/memoranda/2016/06/10/13-55859.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==== Responses to rulings====

Attorney John Steele, who denied having any "ownership interest" in Prenda Law, told ''[[AVN (magazine)|Adult Video News]]'' that "he has faith in the appellate process" and complained that his attorneys were not permitted to present "evidence or testimony". He denied ever practicing law in California, and claimed he had "satisfied" previous inquiries from the [[Illinois State Bar Association|Illinois State Bar]], and stated that Livewire Holdings, identified by Judge Wright as being a member of the Prenda family, "is filing multiple new cases this week (the week of May 6, 2013)".&lt;ref name="Adult Video News 5/7/13"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://business.avn.com/articles/legal/Sanctioned-Copyright-Lawyer-Says-He-Will-Appeal-Judge-s-Order-516284.html | title=Sanctioned Copyright Lawyer Says He Will Appeal Judge's Order (NSFW) | last=Staff | first=AVN | publisher=[[Adult Video News]] | date=May 7, 2013 | accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morgan Pietz, who was awarded $76,752.52 of the sanctions award for his fees and costs, described Prenda Law as "the courtroom equivalent of a common bully". Pietz credited the efforts of "a number of attorneys all over the country [who helped] unravel the puzzle pieces and reveal [Prenda Law] for what they are, profiteering copyright trolls who are abusing the law".&lt;ref name="XBIZ 5/7/13"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.xbiz.com/news/news_piece.php?id=162463 | title=Sanctions Ordered Against Porn-Piracy Litigants (NSFW) | last=Pardon | first=Rhett | publisher=[[XBIZ]] | date=May 7, 2013 | accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''AF Holding vs. Navasca''===
''AF Holdings v. Navasca'' (California) was another Prenda case decided in 2013. As with the signature by "Alan Cooper" in ''Ingenuity 13'', during April and May 2013, the judge in ''Navasca'' expressed curiosity about a signature by "Salt Marsh" on behalf of Prenda client AF Holdings, ordering the original to be produced. Paul Duffy stated he did not know, and Mark Lutz stated he had signed for the client but no longer had the original.&lt;ref name="techdirt0521" /&gt; Salt Marsh, originally identified as an individual person, was later stated to be a trust for the benefit of Lutz' family,&lt;ref name="saltmarsh"&gt;[https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/04/copyright-troll-prenda-loses-sf-case-must-show-salt-marsh-signature/ Copyright troll Prenda loses SF case, must show “Salt Marsh” signature] - Ars Technica, 2013-04-23&lt;/ref&gt; however as plaintiff filings variously stated that "Salt Marsh" was an "individual",&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;{{rp|p.3 (1b)}} and had read various documents and discussed dispute options&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;{{rp|p.3 (1b)}} the court sought the identity of the person who had read, discussed, and signed for the client. Commentators identified that a man named "Saltmarsh" had multiple connections and shared residences with both Steele and other Prenda shell companies, but whether this was the same "Saltmarsh" was unknown.&lt;ref name="saltmarsh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;{{rp|p.4 (1c)}} After the events of early 2013 in ''Ingenuity 13 v. Does'' (above), Prenda and AF Holdings sought [[Motion (legal)#Motion to dismiss|dismissal]] of "numerous cases" in Californian Federal courts, including ''Navasca''.&lt;ref name="gellis"&gt;[http://www.popehat.com/2013/04/23/prenda-law-trip-to-san-francisco-turns-out-badly/ Prenda Law's Trip To San Francisco Turns Out Badly] - Cathy Gellis, cyberlaw attorney and blogger, 2013-04-23&lt;/ref&gt; The judge denied the dismissal, ruling that Prenda's prior actions in ''Nevasca'' seemed to be connected to their desire to prevent [[discovery (law)|discovery]] of damaging evidence which might also impact the ''Ingenuity 13'' case,&lt;ref name="gellis" /&gt; Prenda's disinclination (as in other Prenda cases) to post a [[surety bond|bond]] to support their case (the court ruled: "A plaintiff cannot invoke the benefits of the judicial system without being prepared to satisfy its obligations as a litigant"),&lt;ref name="gellis" /&gt; and described it as "telling that AF moved for a voluntary dismissal only two days after... problems related to its standing were explored and exposed by Mr. Navasca".&lt;ref name="gellis" /&gt; The case was subsequently dismissed with prejudice by the court, as "AF's counsel has now substantially complied with the Court's order".&lt;ref name="techdirt0521" /&gt; Ken White commented on the ruling:&lt;ref name="gellis" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;This [with prejudice] order is a body blow to Prenda Law. Judge Chen... is openly suggesting that Prenda's conduct suggests [[malfeasance]] and evasion of potential negative rulings. He invited Navasca to file a separate motion for fees, and this order strongly suggests that he will grant such a motion. Judge Chen's dismissal of Prenda's 'it doesn't matter if Cooper's signature is forged' argument suggests that he suspects that Prenda's entire litigation strategy is premised on fraud — that Prenda has manufactured the dispute, and that AF Holdings is merely a front for Prenda Law lawyers.&lt;ref name="gellis" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Motion by defense====
On July 2, 2013, defense attorney Nicholas Ranallo filed a motion seeking an award for costs and legal fees against John Steele and Paul Hansmeier personally, rather than against Prenda or the plaintiffs.&lt;ref name="ranallo1"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.cand.254869 Motion for fees and costs in 'Navasca', 2013-07-02]&lt;/ref&gt; The motion summarized the known history and legal cases related to Prenda and its affiliates, and the findings of [[fraud upon the court]], and stated the intent to "hold the individual attorneys that have knowingly committed fraud in this case responsible for their actions by making them jointly and severally liable for the costs and attorney fees incurred", since allegedly "[t]he evidence of fraud is clear and unrebutted, and the involvement of John Steele and Paul Hansmeier is likewise clear.

:;Evidence cited about Salt Marsh, Alan Cooper, and client signatures and identities
:* The "Alan Cooper" and "Salt Marsh" signatures on court-filed documents, and Prenda's failure or inability to produce the individuals responsible or original signatures in both cases despite having (in Hansmeier's testimony) obtained those signatures personally.&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;
:* Anthony Saltmarsh and Alan Cooper as named identifiable individuals having known personal connections to Steele and Prenda, Steele's change of a GoDaddy account nameholder from "Steele" to "Cooper", and Cooper's denial of being the signatory of the document signed "Alan Cooper";&lt;ref name="godfread2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;
:* Mark Lutz's statements that he represented at least one Prenda shell company, although under oath unable to describe even basic details of the company or evidence of being their "representative", his exclusion as a "fraud upon the court" in ''Sunlust vs. Nguyen'' (see below), and transcripts from that case;&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;
:* Brett Gibbs' testimony that he was directed by Steele and Hansmeier and had no personal contact with their clients;&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;
:* Steele and Hansmeier's reassurances to Gibbs that these issues and claims of fraud were mere "conspiracy theories" irrelevant to the litigation in ''Navasca'';&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;
:* Testimony by Hansmeier that Steele had said the signatures were genuine, that "the only person who knows who this Alan Cooper {{not a typo|is| is}} John Steele", and testimony that Steele was asked by Lutz to find a "representative" for AF Holdings', for the purposes of litigation, and that Steele had denied these in a written statement claiming it was a favor at Alan Cooper's request, which were in turn denied by Cooper;&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;
:* AF Holdings filing, listing "Salt Marsh" under "''Individuals'' Likely to Have Discoverable Information", and statements that this "Salt Marsh" had undertaken actions such as reading documents; contradicting later statements that "Salt Marsh" was a trust not an individual;&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;{{rp|p.3 (1b)}}

:; Other evidence cited
:* Expert analysis of "a number of sources" implying that the file sharing account "sharkmp4" identified in ''First Time Videos v. Oppold'' (below), which had been [[digital forensics|linked forensically]] to Steele and Hansmeier's internet account, the expert conclusion that "the individual that controlled the GoDaddy accounts associated with John Steele... used the exact same IP address as the Pirate Bay user that posted links...on the Pirate Bay [...including...] links to Prenda Law works before those works were publicly available from any source", and that "all three entities [John Steele, 6881 Forensics, and sharkmp4] appear under the same control";&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;
:* Judicial findings in ''Ingenuity 13'' and other cases of fraud and deception, and the decision by three Prenda principals to plead the Fifth Amendment rather than explain how they conducted their litigation;&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;
:* Changing and contradictory stories by plaintiff-related parties;&lt;ref name="ranallo1" /&gt;

On June 3, 2013, in another Florida case (''First Time Videos v.

It also appears that Prenda Law also wants to/has formed/is forming a corporate structure where it is: pornography producer, copyright holder, pornography pirate, forensic investigator, [law] firm, and debt collector." Prenda's connection with the suspect IP  (formally assigned by Comcast to 'Steele Hansmeier PLLC'), which had been used by "sharkmp4" and was linked to unlicensed pornographic media distribution, was subsequently confirmed by [[Comcast]] in August 2013 following a [[subpoena]] in another Prenda case, '' AF Holdings v Patel''.&lt;ref name="Comcast"/&gt;

In November 2013 (''Minnesota v. Does''), Prenda apparent shell AF Holdings was directed to repay settlements obtained from four alleged downloaders, in a ruling that stated there was no evidence the claims made were truthful, the copyrights described were held, authentic, or legally assigned by correct signature, and that "The copyright-assignment agreements [for] each complaint in each of these five cases are not what they purport to be. Alan Cooper denies signing either agreement and also denies giving anyone else the authority to sign them on his behalf. AF Holdings failed to produce any credible evidence that the assignments were authentic. The Court has been the victim of a fraud perpetrated by AF Holdings..."

==Other significant cases and legal events==

===''AF Holdings v. Patel'' ("GoDaddy subpoena" case)===
In July 2013, a Georgia Federal court ordered [[discovery (law)|discovery]] for both parties in a November 2012 case filed by AF Holdings, in which the plaintiff's attorney stated he was [[of counsel]] to Prenda Law and offered the law firm's telephone number and Brett Gibbs' email.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.gand.188990 AF Holdings v. Patel, 2:12-cv-00262-WCO, Complaint]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.14}}

The case became relevant in the context of other cases because of its discovery evidence, which was at times referred to in other cases and courts. Information and audio records obtained from ISPs were alleged by the defendant to show that an account in attorney John Steele's name was used to access a [[Domain name|domain]] registered to "Alan Cooper" and when re-registered to "Mark Lutz" retained Steele's email address;&lt;ref name="patel1"&gt;[https://archive.org/download/758311-gov-uscourts-gand-188990-61-0/758311-gov-uscourts-gand-188990-61-0.pdf Defendant’s Response to Plaintiff’s Second Motion for Protective Order with Motion to Quash and Motion to Seal], case 2:12-cv-00262-WCO, filed 2013-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9–10}} that audio recordings of support requests for a domain registered to "Alan Cooper" seemed to be "[the] same voice" but identify himself variously in the different calls as "Alan Cooper", "John", "John Steele" and "Mark Lutz";&lt;ref name="patel1" /&gt;{{rp|10–11}} that an [[IP address]] used to log into an account registered to "John Steele" was also found to be allegedly involved in uploading of copyrighted works for sharing as well;&lt;ref name="patel1" /&gt;{{rp|11–12}} and that two plaintiff motions filed in the case contained [[metadata]] which, it was claimed, indicated they had been "authored by Paul Duffy" of Prenda.&lt;ref name="patel1" /&gt;{{rp|p.2,4}}

In February 2014, with evidence in the underlying case and "cause" hearing stayed due to inclement weather, AF Holdings applied for Paul Duffy to be appointed as attorney ''[[pro hac vice]]'' (temporarily, "for this case only") after its prior attorney went back on active duty,&lt;ref&gt;''AF Holdings v. Patel'':

In a March 2014 ruling on the remaining lawsuits (now consolidated into a single case), Prenda and Duffy were ruled to have engaged in "unreasonable and vexacious" conduct and acted duplicitously; the ruling highlights in addition a finding that "to fabricate what a federal judge said in a ruling before another court falls well outside the bounds of proper advocacy and demonstrates a serious disregard for the judicial process."&lt;ref name="prendaduffy"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.ilnd.284511 Prenda Law v.

The defendant in ''Guava'' testified that he was contacted by Prenda, and given an ultimatum: he could "agree to be sued", and if so Prenda would suggest a choice of attorney,&lt;ref name="TechDirt 1/25/13" /&gt; and in return provide Prenda a copy of data concerning file sharing activities, following which his case would be dismissed, or he could pay $3,400 to close the case silently, or he would face the risk of heavy penalties [figures of $222,000 and $675,000 were cited from other cases] if the court found against him for file sharing a pornographic item for which Guava claimed to be copyright holder.&lt;ref name="merkelaffidavit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TechDirt 1/25/13"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130125/15575421793/defendant-prenda-law-case-reveals-he-agreed-to-take-dive.shtml | title='Defendant' In Prenda Law Case Reveals He Agreed To Take A Dive | author=[[Mike Masnick|Masnick, Mike]] | publisher=[[TechDirt]] | date=January 25, 2013 | accessdate=April 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant's testimony included the statement that: "After subpoenas were served in the case against me, I learned of Guava LLC's and Prenda Law's practice of finding one John Doe to be a named defendant, and then discovering the names of and requesting settlement money from other John Does by issuing subpoenas to ISPs."&lt;ref name="merkelaffidavit" /&gt;

Upon filing the lawsuit the defendant's attorney then stipulated with Prenda that Prenda could issue subpoenas to the defendant's purported "co-conspirators."

File sharing writer and former copyright enforcer&lt;ref&gt;http://torrentfreak.com/author/bjones&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Jones opined about the case, that "These [hacking] claims were, it seems, to get around the problems of having already sued and settled [Merkel's] copyright case. Using state laws they could file in state courts, and keep a distance between this case and the Doe case filed in DC that Merkel settled."&lt;ref name="benjones1"&gt;http://torrentfreak.com/prenda-suffers-more-fee-award-blows-130809 states of Alpha Law Firm: "This case [''Guava v.

On January 22, 2013, four ISPs asked the court to quash subpoenas in ''Guava'', on the grounds that "new information strongly indicates that the present action may be nothing more than a contrived lawsuit with no actual controversy", in which the defendant had agreed to act as a defendant "for the sole purpose of facilitating Guava's pursuit of non-party discovery..."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/122261270/Reply-by-ISPs&lt;/ref&gt; The case was eventually [[Motion (legal)#Motion to dismiss|dismissed with prejudice]], and costs and legal fees of $63,367.52 were awarded against Guava LLC, Alpha Law Firm LLC (a further plaintiff with links to Prenda that had joined the case) and Guava's Counsel of Record.&lt;ref&gt;http://pa.courts.state.mn.us/CaseDetail.aspx?CaseID=1615685222&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="benjonestorrentfreak"&gt;http://torrentfreak.com/prenda-suffers-more-fee-award-blows-130809/&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. legal background==

===Signatures in the cases===
Attorney Cathy Gellis commented on the significance of the "Salt Marsh" and "Alan Cooper" signatures on legal papers in ''Nevasca'' and ''Ingenuity 13'', that: "[T]ransferring the copyright [to a Prenda "client"]... shows that someone has a copyright. It doesn't show that someone has [[standing (law)|standing]] to come into court to enforce it. Given that Prenda Law has been unable to substantiate who that someone is, all of these cases have become suspect on that basis". In a similar manner, "The 'Alan Cooper' problem... stems from certain paperwork allegedly 'signed' by a Mr. Cooper that doesn't seem to exist, thereby creating a fundamental standing issue for all these cases".&lt;ref name="gellis" /&gt;

Legally, the act of knowingly falsifying a signature for a court document, or asserting a false statement about standing, would potentially be a [[fraud upon the court]]. Judge Wright stated in ''Ingenuity 13'' that "Although the recipient of a copyright assignment need not sign the document, a forgery is still a forgery.  And trying to pass that forged document by the Court smacks of fraud".&lt;ref name="Wright ruling 06may2013"/&gt;{{rp|p.8}}

===Case law related to purpose of judicial processes===
Federal courts in the United States seek to procure the orderly, just and timely resolution of [[Case or Controversy Clause|genuine controversies and disputes]], which limits the purpose for which legal processes can be used, and their manner of use. (''See also: [[Case or Controversy Clause]]''). In case law this has meant at times that motive becomes a distinction in US court cases, so that a case or motion perceived by the court to have an inappropriate motive or reason may be [[Distinguishing|distinguished]], and expedited subpoenas or discovery (against parties or non-parties) may be declined by a court if ill-suited to the circumstances or perceived to have an inappropriate purpose.

{{quote|In "Righthaven LLC v. Hill" (Colorado federal court, with no connection to Prenda Law), a company had acquired legal rights for the sole purpose of obtaining income by suing copyright-breaching individuals. The court ruled that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Plaintiff's business model relies in large part upon reaching settlement agreements with a minimal investment of time and effort... Plaintiff's wishes to the contrary, the courts are not merely tools for encouraging and exacting settlements from Defendants cowed by the potential costs of litigation and liability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plainsite.org/dockets/download.html?id=22839253&amp;z=4b060b3b ''Righthaven v. Hill'', case 1:11-cv-00211-JLK] order dated 2011-04-07.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In "Disability Rights Council of Greater Washington v.  Washington Metro. Area Transit Authority" (Washington federal court), expedited discovery had been sought, additionally only a short time was offered for defendants to respond. The court denied expedited discovery as being for an inappropriate motive and criticized as "brutally unfair" the short time-scale offered:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'[A] preliminary injunction is just that – preliminary' [citing Cobell v. Norton] ...  plaintiffs are not seeking expedited discovery to gain evidence to get the court to preserve the status quo. They want to gather all the evidence they would need to radically transform the status quo, on an expedited basis.&lt;ref name="washmetro"&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-dcd-1_04-cv-00498/pdf/USCOURTS-dcd-1_04-cv-00498-5.pdf ''Disability Rights Council of Greater Washington v.  Washington Metro. Area Transit Authority'', case 1:04-cv-00498-HHK] order dated 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

===US law on costs of litigation===
US law differs from some other countries on how [[legal fees]] and [[court costs]] are allocated following [[litigation]], in a way that impacts some kinds of litigation. [[English rule (attorney's fees)|Unlike most other common-law countries]], the "[[American rule (attorney's fees)|American rule]]" stipulates that, while discretion and many exceptions exist, the general principle is that {{em|each side bears its own legal costs regardless of who wins}}, unless legally stated otherwise. This can avoid a deterrent effect against a poor plaintiff, but can also give even a defendant who might defend successfully, good incentive to settle and pay, if it will cost less than the likely cost of defense and any appeals, or they lack resources for the procedures that may be required.

'''Presumption of guilt''', in Latin, ''ei incumbit probatio qui negat, non qui dicit'' (the burden of proof is on the one who denies, not on one who declares), is the principle that one is considered guilty unless proven innocent. Generally, this is an [[argument from ignorance]], a philosophical concept in which a thing is assumed to be true because not proved false.

==In the law==

Presumption of guilt shifts the [[burden of proof (law)|burden of proof]] onto the defendant, who must then [[Burden of proof (philosophy)#Proving a negative|prove a negative]] to achieve [[acquittal]]. The phrase has been in use since at least the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;
T. C. Granger. ''A digest of the law of evidence in criminal cases'' W. Benning &amp; Company, 1846&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[Default effect|default position]] based on pessimism and [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] whereas [[presumption of innocence]] is based more on optimism and [[Trust (emotion)|trust]]. There is a greater likelihood of obtaining a [[wrongful conviction]]. For example, in the [[murder of Lynette White]] case, a double wrong was committed in that innocent men were convicted, while the real perpetrator remained at large and a danger to the public.

Presumption of guilt is a denial of an international [[human right]] under the UN's [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], Article 11. Under the presumption of guilt, the defence must collect and present compelling evidence to the [[trier of fact]] (a judge or a jury). The defence must, in most cases prove that the accused is innocent.

==Widespread prevalence==
Presumption of guilt is pandemic, occasionally erupting into epidemic proportions. Smaller instances include adverse accusatory reactions to unusual costume such as the [[burqa]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Angela Rainey]], 'Here's what happens when you wear a burka in Northern Ireland towns', The Belfast Telegraph, 7 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt; or merely a 'suspicious stare' from the police.&lt;ref&gt;[[John P Crank]], ''Understanding Police Culture'', Routledge, p 146&lt;/ref&gt; More severe is the [[blame culture]] inherent in bureaucratic organisations where those with the least responsibility are blamed the most.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Belief in the '[[Stab-in-the-back myth]]' – that Jews and profiteers were collectively guilty of losing the war for Germany in 1918 – is an extreme instance of guilt being presumed.

==Typology==

Presumption of guilt may take many forms: 
* [[Guilt by association]], for example, punishing the families of North Korean defectors.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Laurence and Ju-Min Park, 'Guilty by association: growing up in hell of North Korean gulag', Reuters, may 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Extrajudicial punishment]] such as [[lynching]] or other forms of [[vigilantism]], which seek to bypass legal procedures;
* [[Blaming the victim]]; for example, victims of rape in Saudi Arabia and Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vicky Baker]], 'Rape victim sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in jail', The Guardian, 17 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Neela Debnath]], 'rape victims still blamed for sexual violence in Somalia', The Independent, 6 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Collective guilt]], for example the belief that 'all Muslims are terrorists';&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer Case]], 'Islamist Terror and Collective Guilt', [[national Review]], 4 April 2016&lt;/ref&gt; conversely, the terrorist may believe his victims to be collectively guilty of some perceived injustice, as in the case of [[9/11]]. A belief in [[Jewish deicide]] expresses the view that 'all Jews are Christ-killers',&lt;ref&gt;Peter J Tomson, ''Presumed Guilty: How the Jews were Blamed For the Death of Jesus'', Fortress Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; though in fact only the Romans had the legal authority to crucify someone.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giles Fraser]], 'Christians must understand that for Jews the cross is a symbol of oppression', [[The Guardian]], 25 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rushing to [[judgement]], for example equating arrest with conviction.&lt;ref&gt;[[Luke Gittos]], '[[Eric Bellquist]] and the presumption of innocence', ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'', 2017-08-17&lt;/ref&gt;
* The obtaining of a [[false confession]] under [[duress]] or [[torture]]; 
* [[Judicial misconduct]] such as [[collusion]] with the prosecution; [[judicial murder]]
* A [[frameup]], usually admissions presumably made, "false statements". All such admissions should be treated with skepticism without actual video or a signed statement.[[miscarriage of justice]]; 
* A [[plea bargain]], which in the worst case may induce a guilty party to give [[false testimony]] against an innocent co-accused;
* A [[fixed penalty notice]] or on-the-spot fine; 
* [[Precrime]] policies such as [[preventive detention]]
* Preemptive action such as [[drone strikes]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robertson|first1=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Robertson|title=Drone attacks go against every human rights principle in the book|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/lifestyle/lifestyle/2012/06/drone-attacks-against-human-rights-principle-book|work=New Statesman|date=13 June 2012|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==

* [[Racial prejudice]];&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Stevenson, 'A presumption of guilt', [[The New York Review]], 13 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[authority fallacy]], demonstrated by the [[Milgram experiment]], in which persons may be too much inclined to follow orders from a perceived [[authoritarian]] figure; as in the extreme case of [[Hitler]], [[Adolf Eichmann]], and the [[Final solution]].
* Short-term political gain and the destruction of political rivals, as in the [[Stalinist]] [[show trials]] of the 1930s.
* Dissatisfaction or impatience with due [[legal process]] which [[vigilantes]] and others see as 'weak'.
* 'Impatience and fear of jurors, 'media frenzy', a punitive culture, and cognitive bias'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keith Findley]], 'The presumption of Innocence exists in theory, not reality', [[Washington Post]], 19/1/2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2018}}
* Psychological game-playing; the aggressive accuser is said to play [[mind games]], while the victim is on a [[guilt trip]]. Guilt feelings may be residual from early childhood, in which all of us are powerless and presumption of guilt ('you naughty boy', 'shame on you, wicked child') is often the norm.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wayne Dyer]], ''[[Your Erroneous Zones]]'', Warner Books, 1976, p 100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Eric Berne]], ''[[Games People Play (book)]]'', Penguin 1964, pp 73-75&lt;/ref&gt;
* A mind-set which favours [[Apocalypticism]]. According to [[Jonathan Schell]], the religiously orthodox may 'take it upon themselves to please a wrathful God' through the 'extinction of 'evil' mankind'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Schell]], ''[[The Fate of the Earth]]'', Picador, 1982, p133&lt;/ref&gt; Apocalypticism attracts 'desperate, humiliated and defeated' people, says [[John Michael Greer]]; it 'offers a free ticket out of the troubles of everyday life'.&lt;ref&gt;John Michael Greer, ''Apocalypse'', Quercus, 2012, pp 35, 36, 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Presumption of guilt is as old as [[Suspicion (emotion)|suspicion]] itself. In ancient Greece, public officials were elected for very limited terms of office and barred from re-election, on the presumption that too long an incumbency would lead to abuse of power. [[Thucydides]] and [[Aristophanes]]&lt;ref&gt;M S Silk, ''Aristophanes and the Definition of Comedy'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p 372&lt;/ref&gt; pointed out that the crowd were too easily swayed by [[Eloquence|oratory]]  and emotion. As [[Lord Acton]] wrote in the 19th century, again expressing presumption of guilt, "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men,..."&lt;ref name="lmcone"&gt;[http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165acton.html Letter to Bishop Mandell Creighton, April 5, 1887] published in ''Historical Essays and Studies'', edited by J. N. Figgis and R. V. Laurence (London: Macmillan, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]] was a persistent presumer of guilt in those he disliked. Being allegedly a [[psychopath]] and [[narcissist]]&lt;ref&gt;see Wikipedia article [[psychopathography of Adolf Hitler]]&lt;/ref&gt; he tended to blame others when things went wrong. From 1918 he blamed Germany's defeat on the [[November criminals]] of the [[Weimar Republic]] for negotiating a truce when Germany still had the capacity to fight on; in [[Mein Kampf]] he wrote; 'every third German is a traitor'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 154&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945, when it was clear that Germany could not win the war, Hitler wished to punish the entire nation for failing to meet his expectations, according to [[Sebastian Haffner]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sebastian Haffner]], ''The Meaning of Hitler'', Phoenix 2003, p 120, 157, 160, 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1947 and 1956, many US citizens were unfairly accused of being communist agents or sympathisers and had their careers ruined during the era of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Second Red Scare]], or even killed like [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]]. The McCarthyites 'never produced a single Communist spy whose guilt was proved in court.'&lt;ref&gt;[[Don E Carleton]] and [[John Henry Faulk]], ''Red Scare: Right-Wing Hysteria, Fifties Fanaticism, and Their Legacy in Texas'', University of Texas Press, 2014, p x&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], supreme leader of [[Iran]], pronounced a death sentence by [[fatwa]] on [[Salman Rushdie]] and anyone assisting publication of his book, ''[[The Satanic Verses]]''; 'I call on all Muslims wherever they may be in the world to kill them without delay'. the Fatwa was condemned for violating [[national sovereignty]], [[freedom of speech]], and the Muslim principle of [[fiqh]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Newsweek]], 27 February 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

== Self-incrimination ==
{{main|Self-incrimination}}
In the UK case ''Hale'', 2 P. C. 290 (n), the defendant was alleged to have murdered his niece, who had cried out 'good uncle do not kill me', and then was seen no more. The defendant, asked to produce the girl in court, had fraudulently produced another girl disguised as the niece. The court presumed him guilty on this basis and he was executed. Later, the niece was found, alive and well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=TC | last=Granger | title=A Digest of the Law of Evidence in Criminal Cases | publisher=Benning and co | year=1846 | page=18 | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ifFiAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA18&amp;lpg=RA1-PA18&amp;dq=Hale,+2P.C.290(n)&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WCEInjyO8T&amp;sig=vdmOWhomV6cRdpLo4JCG7pkCPVY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj8-LyF5ZPZAhWywVkKHbOrCZ0Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Hale%2C%202P.C.290(n)&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sexual violence and harassment ==

The American actor and producer [[Jeremy Piven]] has spoken out against the [[Me Too movement]], which, he claims, 'put lives in jeopardy without a hearing, due process or evidence'. Writing about Piven's comment, journalist [[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)|Brendan O'Neill]], suggests that the presumption of innocence, which barrister and writer [[John Mortimer]] described as a 'golden thread', is being weakened.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brendan O'Neill (journalist)]], 'Whatever Happened to the Presumption of Innocence?', ''Los Angeles Times'', 16 November 2017.

High Court judge Sir [[Richard Henriques]] has criticized UK police training and methods which allegedly assert that 'only 0.1% of rape allegations are false' ('lying with statistics' or straight-out lie to prejudice, this is better than 'accusers never lie', which is obviously false.) and in which all complainants are treated as 'victims' from the start. In three cases which later collapsed, including those of Liam Allan and Danny Kay, police withheld vital evidence from the defence. &lt;ref&gt;[[Marco Giannangeli]], 'Police must stop training 'Presumption of Guilt', says High Court judge', Daily Express, 24 December 2017.

Accessed 6 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to assess the true prevalence of [[False accusation of rape|false rape allegations]], but it is generally agreed that rape accusations are false about 2% to 10% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;DiCanio, M.

In 1990, Yale professor and [[radical feminist]] [[Catharine MacKinnon]], is alleged to have addressed a graduation crowd thus; 'look about you. Statistics tell us you have just laid eyes on someone guilty of sexual assault'.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Taylor Jr and KC Johnson, ''Until Proven Innocent'', St Martin's Press, 2013, chapter 24&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1989 book ''Towards a Feminist Theory of the State'' she alleged that 'all sex is akin to rape'.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Taylor Jr and KC Johnson, ''Until Proven Innocent'', chapter 24&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]] there has been a 'spate of wrongful convictions' and alleged misconduct by police and prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Kaiman]], 'China Suspects presumed guilty until proven innocent', [[The Guardian]], 20 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Turkey]], a suspect arrested after the July 2016 coup attempt was asked to pay his defence lawyer $80,000, reflecting the cost to the lawyer's career; he would be thrown off the bar. 'Bogus and ludicrous charges' and confessions obtained under torture, were allegedly widespread.&lt;ref&gt;[[Macit Ferhan]], 'In Turkey, You are Guilty until proven Innocent', The Globe Post, 7 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Japan]] the criminal justice system has been criticized for its wide use of [[Detention (imprisonment)|detentions]], suspects were forced to make false confessions during interrogations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Keiji Hirano]], 'Justice system flawed by presumed guilt', [[The Japan Times]], 13 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Project Bioshield Act''' was an act passed by the [[United States Congress]] in [[2004 in the United States|2004]] calling for $5 billion for purchasing vaccines that would be used in the event of a [[bioterrorism|bioterrorist]] attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |quote=Project BioShield will transform our ability to defend the nation in three essential ways. First, Project BioShield authorizes $5.6 billion over 10 years for the government to purchase and stockpile vaccines and drugs to fight anthrax, smallpox and other potential agents of bioterror. The [[Department of Health and Human Services]] has already taken steps to purchase 75 million doses of an improved anthrax vaccine for the [[Strategic National Stockpile]]. Under Project BioShield, HHS is moving forward with plans to acquire a safer, second generation smallpox vaccine, an antidote to botulinum toxin, and better treatments for exposure to chemical and radiological weapons.
  |work=[[White House]] |date=July 21, 2004 |accessdate=2008-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a ten-year program to acquire medical countermeasures to [[Biological agents|biological]], [[chemical weapons|chemical]], [[Radiological weapons|radiological]], and [[nuclear weapons|nuclear agents]] for civilian use. A key element of the Act was to allow stockpiling and distribution of vaccines which had not been [[Clinical trial|tested for safety or efficacy in humans]], due to ethical concerns.  Efficacy of such agents cannot be directly tested in humans without also exposing humans to the chemical, biological, or radioactive threat being treated, so   testing follows the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] Animal Rule for pivotal animal efficacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Since the [[September 11 attacks|2001 terrorist attacks]], the United States government has allocated nearly $50 billion to address the threat of biological weapons.  U.S. funding for bioweapons-related activities focuses primarily on research for and acquisition of medicines for defense. Funding also goes toward stockpiling protective equipment, increased surveillance and detection of biological agents, and improving state and hospital preparedness.  The increase in this type of funding is mainly for   Project BioShield.  Significant funding also goes to [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority|Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA)]], part of HHS. Funding for activities aimed at prevention has more than doubled 2007 and is distributed to 11 federal agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armscontrolcenter.org/policy/biochem/articles/fy09_biodefense_funding/ Federal Funding for Bioweapons Prevention and Defense, by Agency, 2001-2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  Efforts toward cooperative international action are part of the project.

== Provisions ==

* Amends the [[Public Health Service Act]] to authorize the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) to: (1) conduct and support research and development activities for countermeasures in biological emergencies and provide that biocontaminant laboratories and specialized research facilities will be available to the Secretary to respond to public health emergencies affecting national security.
* Allows the Secretary to expedite purchasing related to research and development needs by simplifying limits on procurement.
* Allows the Secretary to respond to pressing research and development needs, including expediting peer review, contracting with experts, and appointing employees to positions at the [[National Institutes of Health]].
* Amends the Public Health Service Act to allow the Director of the NIH to act through the Director of the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID) to provide grants for the modernization and construction of research facilities. Increases the Federal share of such NIAID-funded projects.
* Provides funding for the [[National Vaccine Program]] for FY 2004 and 2005.
* Adds the [[Secretary of Homeland Security]] (DHS) to the working group on the prevention, preparedness, and response to bioterrorism and other public health emergencies.
* Amends the [[Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act]] of 2002 to direct the Secretary to coordinate with Homeland Security to maintain the [[Strategic National Stockpile]] and deploy the Stockpile to respond to an emergency.
* Allows security countermeasures to be procured using the special reserve fund (an appropriations account set up by to this Act). A "security countermeasure" is a countermeasure that is either authorized for emergency use or that the Secretary determines is a priority, is necessary, and is an approved drug or a drug reasonably likely to be approved within eight years.
* Provides that in order for a countermeasure to be procured using the special reserve fund: (1) HHS must identify a chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear agent as a threat to the U.S. population that may affect national security; (2) HHS must determine that a countermeasure is necessary to protect public health; (3) HHS must assess the availability and appropriateness of the countermeasure to address the threat; (4) DHS and HHS must jointly submit a proposal to the president to issue a call for the development of countermeasures that are not available or cleared only for alternative purposes; (5) DHS and HHS must make a commitment to recommend that the special reserve fund be available for the procurement of a countermeasure; (6) the President must approve the proposal; (7) DHS and HHS must make specified information known to those who may respond to a call for the countermeasure including the specifications of the needed countermeasure; (8) HHS must determine which countermeasures can be procured using the special reserve fund; (9) the HHS and DHS and the Director of the [[Office of Management Budget]] must submit a recommendation to the President that the special reserve fund be used to procure the countermeasure; and (10) the President must approve the recommendation. HHS and DHS must notify designated congressional committees promptly that a material threat has been identified and countermeasures are necessary to protect the public health and that the President has approved a recommendation for countermeasure procurement using the special reserve fund. Authorizes appropriations for the special reserve fund to procure security countermeasures approved by the President, for the hiring of personnel to carry out terror threat assessments, and for the development of secure intelligence-sharing facilities. Transfers the functions, personnel, assets, unexpended balances, and liabilities of the Stockpile from the Secretary of Homeland Security to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.
* Amends the [[Homeland Security Act]] to change the responsibilities of the Secretary of Homeland Security as they relate to the Stockpile.
*Amends the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] to allow the Secretary to authorize the use of a drug, device, or biological product intended for emergency use, specifically allowing the use of unapproved products, or the unapproved use of approved products, upon a determination by DHS that there is or is a significant potential for a domestic emergency, or upon a determination by DHS of a public health emergency that affects or may affect national security and that involves a specified agent or a specified disease that may be attributable to such agent. Amends the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] to continue provisions governing the emergency use of products with respect to members of the Armed Forces. The Secretary can authorize the use of unapproved products in an emergency only upon a determination by the Secretary of Defense of a military emergency involving a heightened risk to U.S. forces of an attack.
* Requires the Controller General to: (1) review the Secretary's use of the authorities granted under this Act; (2) assess the adequacy of the internal controls instituted by the Secretary; (3) identify any procurements that would have been significantly delayed or not made without the authorities provided to the Secretary; (4) determine to what extent authorized activities under this Act have enhanced the development of biomedical countermeasures; (5) assess the availability of countermeasures to address threats; (6) assess the extent to which programs and activities will reduce a gap between the threat and the availability of countermeasures to an acceptable level of risk; and (7) assess the threats to national security posed by technology that will enable the development of antibiotic resistant, mutated, or bioengineered strains of biological agents and recommend strategies for addressing such threats, and make recommendations on possible improvements.
* Directs the Secretary, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Secretary of Defense to ensure that the activities of their respective Departments coordinate, complement, and do not unnecessarily duplicate programs designed to protect the homeland from biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear agents. Directs such Secretaries to each appoint an official to coordinate such programs for their respective Departments.

==Act accomplishments==
Progress has been made in the establishment of both national requirements and acquisition strategies, as well as the procurement of pre- and postexposure countermeasures to meet the threat from anthrax, botulinum toxins, smallpox, and radiological and nuclear threats.

[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS) has taken a number of additional steps to accomplish the goal of effectively and efficiently implementing the Project BioShield Act. HHS has reorganized the [[Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response]] (ASPR) (formerly the [[Office of Public Health Emergency Preparedness]]) and established a dedicated strategic planning function that more efficiently integrates [[biodefense]] requirements and streamlines the interagency governance process. Under the reorganized structure, on behalf of the secretary of HHS, the ASPR leads the federal public health and medical response to acts of terrorism or nature and other public health and medical emergencies. In 2006, HHS announced, in the Federal Register Notice of 6 July 2006, the establishment of the Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise (PHEMCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Russell |first1=Philip |year=2007 |title=Project BioShield: What It Is, Why It Is Needed, and Its Accomplishments So Far |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=45 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=68–72 |publisher=Oxford Journals |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/Supplement_1/S68.full |accessdate=June 12, 2013 |doi=10.1086/518151 |pmid=17582574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquired vaccines==
In September 2012, ''BioPrepWatch'' reported that the BARDA annual report shows that the number of supplies of countermeasures for combating terrorist attacks is growing.&lt;ref name="bioprepwatch.com"&gt;Kellen Alexander [http://www.bioprepwatch.com/us_bioterror_policy/u-s-grows-its-biodefense-stockpile/325295/ "U.S. grows its biodefense stockpile"], ''BioPrepWatch'', 18 Sep 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report, BARDA has acquired:&lt;ref name="bioprepwatch.com"/&gt;
*107,000 doses of an [[antitoxin]] for [[Clostridium botulinum]] (a decrease from the full 200,000 doses ordered in 2006).
*57,102 doses of the [[Monoclonal antibodies|monoclonal antibody]] [[Raxibacumab]], which treats [[anthrax]], from [[Human Genome Sciences]] in 2011. This included 20,000 doses under a 2005 contact and 37,102 doses of the 45,000 ordered in a 2009 contract option. At the end of 2010, there was a total supply of 36,102 doses of [[Raxibacumab]].
* 10,000 doses of [[anthrax immune globulin]] from [[Cangene]], which also treats anthrax. By 2010, the supply was down to 7,327 doses, with spending on [[Raxibacumab]] and AIG coming to $478 million.
* 28.75 million doses of the anthrax vaccine [[Anthrax vaccines|BioThrax]] from [[Emergent BioSolutions]].
* [[Botulism]] treatments, as well, including 107,560 doses of Botulinum Antitoxin Therapeutic from [[Cangene]]. It ordered 200,000 doses. At the end of 2010, the supply was at 97,000 doses.

Section 401 of the [[Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 307; 113th Congress)]] reauthorized the BioShield Project.&lt;ref name=307summary&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 307|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/307|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, it reauthorizes the Project BioShield Special Reserve Fund (SRF), originally established in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 307 - Legislative Digest|url=https://www.gop.gov/bill/113/1/hr307|publisher=House Republicans|accessdate=10 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent news==
To June 2013, eight [[Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority#Integrated National Biodefense Medical Countermeasures Portfolio|medical countermeasures]] (MCM) against [[anthrax]], [[smallpox]], [[botulinum toxin]] and radiological threats have been procured. Eighty other candidate MCMs are undergoing advanced development. However, unless Congress acts, the authorities and funds contained in the Project BioShield Act will expire at the end of  year 2013. The legislative experiment of BioShield is now subject to evaluation and reconsideration in the House and the Senate, which have both passed versions of reauthorization legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnas.org/files/documents/publications/CNAS_RenewingTheProjectBioShieldAct_Kadlec.pdf |title=Renewing the Project BioShield Act - What Has It Bought and Wrought? |last1=Kadlec |first1=Robert |date=January 2013 |publisher=[[Center for a New American Security]] |accessdate=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, funding was extended through 2018 via the Pandemic Act.{{cite web |url=https://www.phe.gov/Preparedness/legal/pahpa/Pages/pahpra.aspx |title = Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Reauthorization Act |date=March 2013| publisher=US Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=23 Feb 2017}}

In February 2018, the [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] released a report called "Budgeting for Medical Countermeasures: An Ongoing Need for Preparedness." Based on the report, former U.S. Senator [[Tom Daschle]] (D-SD) said that the change in the way that the Project BioShield Act of 2004 is funded (it changed from a ten-year [[Appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations]] cycle to year-by-year funding) creates a climate of uncertainty for private firms looking to invest in medical countermeasures (MCM) against [[CBRN defense|chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear]] (CBRN) agents. No commercial market exists for MCMs, so the firms that research and develop MCMs have to depend on a reliable stream of government money. According to ''Homeland Preparedness News'', "Daschle and [former U.S. Sen. Judd] [[Judd Gregg|Gregg]] offered budgeting strategies that they believe could lend stability to the MCM arena, some of which would call for changes to statutory processes and congressional procedures that have been implemented since the Project BioShield Act's 2004 enactment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/26791-former-sen-daschle-praises-trumps-support-project-bioshield/|title=Former Sen. Daschle praises Trump's support of Project BioShield - Homeland Preparedness News|date=2018-02-14|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2018-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published literature==
A 2005 review reported that the project had  an advanced appropriation for countermeasures—ranging from vaccines to biodosimetry to surveillance—related to [[biological weapon]]s and other WMD.&lt;ref name="jaoa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dudley |first1=Gail |last2=McFee |first2=Robin |year=2005 |title=Preparedness for Biological Terrorism in the United States: Project BioShield and Beyond |journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association |volume=105 |issue=9 |pages=417–424 |publisher=American Osteopathic Association |url=http://jaoa.org/article.aspx?articleid=2093182|pmid=16239492}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provisions have been made as well to ensure safer and more effective vaccinations for such threats such as smallpox. Another issue lies within the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA requires clinical studies of human safety and efficacy. The  Journal of the American Osteopathic Association notes that this kind of testing for biological weapons is ethically unacceptable to conduct on humans. "The need for expedited development of critical countermeasures must be balanced against the need to ensure that these essential interventions are safe as well as effective."&lt;ref name="jaoa" /&gt;

A 2007 review stated that the project  is needed because when the only market is the government, there is a high risk of failure and a low expectation of profit. This discourages other manufacturers from investing research, development and funds in the bioterrorism products to be sold, because the expected profits do not justify the opportunity costs. Pharmaceutical and vaccine manufacturers can perceive the federal government as an uncertain and low-profit market. The project  was developed in an attempt to provide a financial incentive to manufacturers to develop the products needed for defense against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Russell |first1=Philip |year=2007 |title=Project BioShield: What It Is, Why It Is Needed, and Its Accomplishments So Far |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=45 |issue=Supplement 1 |pages=68–72 |publisher=Oxford Journal |url=http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/content/45/Supplement_1/S68.full |doi=10.1086/518151|pmid= 17582574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A perspective piece published in [[The New England Journal of Medicine]] in 2009 noted that the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] issued [[Emergency Use Authorization]] (EUA) to use an unapproved drug in case of an emergency, but also noted that this could only issued only after the secretary of health and human services has declared a public health emergency. "In the case of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, such a declaration was made on April 26, 2009. An EUA for a medical product has a term of 1 year, but it can be renewed, depending on the circumstances of the emergency. It is important that product development continue to focus on the goal of approval (there are ongoing clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of intravenous peramivir in treating influenza), because the EUA is only a temporary means for making a product available during an emergency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Birnkrant |first1=Debra |last2=Cox |first2=Edward |year=2009 |title=The Emergency Use Authorization of Peramivir for Treatment of 2009 H1N1 Influenza |journal=New England Journal of Medicine |volume=361 |pages=2204–2207 |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp0910479  |doi=10.1056/NEJMp0910479|pmid=19884645 |issue=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A book published in 2010 written by Frank Gottron, "Project BioShield: Purposes and Authorities", stated that the project  allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to purchase unapproved and unlicensed vaccinations. The HHS will determine that "...sufficient and satisfactory clinical experience or research data...support(s) a reasonable conclusion that the product will qualify for approval or licensing...within eight years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gottron |first=Frank |title=Project BioShield: Purposes and Authorities |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=mxD0UuwrmdkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=Project+Bioshield+Act&amp;ots=hqjh9gB2q3&amp;sig=k4gzF1pqNZhBjFjQT8PILc2mKas&amp;redir_esc=y |year=2010 |publisher=DIANE Publishing |location=United States |isbn=1437922848 |pages=1–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HHS will write contracts on these unapproved products, help lowering the purchasing cost of the drugs.

==Challenges and criticism==
Some provisions of Project BioShield are controversial. Some critics suggest that biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies will require even more incentives than contained in these proposals from the Government.

The project's funding  would be subject to annual review through the appropriations process. Furthermore, the law would require the HHS Secretary to prepare annual reports detailing actions taken under this Act including identification of each person or entity that received, or was considered and rejected for grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts under this Act. The approval and licensing processes are designed to preclude the marketing of ineffective and dangerous treatments. Only about 1 of 5 drugs that begin the approval process actually become approved treatments. Because it is not possible to predict the outcome of the approval process, critics of this provision suggest that the government will end up purchasing countermeasures that will eventually fail to be approved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA477909 |title=CRS Report for Congress - Project BioShield |last1=Gottron |first1=Frank |date=July 23, 2003 |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obstacles to pharmaceutical and vaccine development include inadequate funding for research, insufficient protections against corporate liability, and constraints related to safety considerations. Typically, the drug-development process in the United States is largely initiated by the National Institutes of Health, which supports basic research through funding scientists. Although the development of a new medication usually takes several years between the time that research begins to the time that the medication is marketed, developing medical interventions against potential biological weapons is especially intense in terms of time, labor, and finances.&lt;ref name="jaoa" /&gt; There is also no guarantee that the drug companies will purchase the vaccinations.

===PhRMA===
Michael Friedman, MD, chief medical officer for biomedical preparedness at the [[Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America]] in Washington, DC voiced additional financial concerns of the pharmaceutical industry in 2005. He explains that manufacturers of biological defense products could still be "exposed to devastating product-liability suits," adding, "The decision to divert resources from the research and development of medicines for serious illnesses like heart disease can be financially risky, especially when a countermeasure may never be purchased or used." Friedman argues there needs to be more sponsored research and collaborative programs that engage government, academia, and industry, as well as additional incentives for private companies.&lt;ref name="jaoa" /&gt;

The case arose when the federal government appointed [[Marc Nadon|Justice Marc Nadon]] to the position of [[puisne justice]] of the Supreme Court of Canada, on October 3, 2013.&lt;ref name="Ottawa Citizen - 21 March 2014 - The Nadon ruling hits like an earthquake"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ottawacitizen.com/opinion/op-ed/Nadon+ruling+hits+like+earthquake/9647284/story.html|title=The Nadon ruling hits like an earthquake|last=Mathen|first=Carissima|date=21 March 2014|work=[[Ottawa Citizen]]|publisher=[[Postmedia Network]]|accessdate=22 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the time of the appointment, Justice Nadon was a supernumerary judge of the [[Federal Court of Appeal]], having served on the federal courts for over 20 years. Justice Nadon had been a member of the Quebec Bar prior to his appointment.

Ontario lawyer [[Rocco Galati]] challenged the appointment in the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court of Canada]], arguing that Justice Nadon was not eligible to be appointed, as he was neither a member of one of the superior courts of Quebec, nor a current member of the Bar of Quebec. The Quebec government also questioned the appointment.

In response, the federal Parliament passed an amendment to the ''[[Supreme Court Act]]'', which declared that the requirement that an appointee be a member of the Quebec bar also included former members of the Bar.&lt;ref&gt;''Supreme Court Act'',  ss 5.1, 6.1, as enacted by the ''Economic Action Plan 2013 Act, No. 2'', SC 2013, c 40, ss 471, 472.&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal government then referred the issue to the Supreme Court as a [[reference question]] under the ''Supreme Court Act''.&lt;ref&gt;''Supreme Court Act'', s 53.&lt;/ref&gt;  The federal government argued that the requirement that Quebec judges be appointed from among the bar of Quebec included former members of the bar.

==The ''Supreme Court Act'' and the Quebec Seats on the Court==

When the Supreme Court was created in 1875, it was composed of six judges, two of whom were required to be appointed from the superior courts of Quebec or from the Bar of Quebec,&lt;ref&gt;''Supreme and Exchequer Court Act'', SC 1875, c 11, s 4.&lt;/ref&gt; in order to ensure representation of Quebec's [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdiction on the Court. When the Court was expanded to nine judges in 1949, the number of Quebec judges was increased to three.&lt;ref&gt;''Act to amend the Supreme Court Act'', SC 1949 (2nd Sess), c 37, ss 1, 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  This provision continues to apply under the ''Supreme Court Act''.&lt;ref&gt;''Supreme Court Act'', s 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 5 of the ''Act'' holds that, in general, Court appointees must either have been members of a provincial superior court, or must have at least ten years' standing at a provincial bar. Section 6 then provides a particular rule for Quebec, requiring that the three judges from Quebec must be appointed from either the superior courts of Quebec, or "among the advocates of that province."  The general rule in section 5 clearly included former members of the bars of the provinces as eligible to be appointed.  The issue was whether the wording of section 6 restricted that general rule to current members of the bar of Quebec for the Quebec seats on the Court.

==Decision of the Court==

The Supreme Court ruled, by a 6–1 decision,&lt;ref name="Ottawa Citizen - 21 March 2014 - The Nadon ruling hits like an earthquake"/&gt; that only current members of the Quebec superior courts and current members of the bar of Quebec are eligible to be appointed to the Quebec seats on the Supreme Court.

===Majority decision===
The majority decision was attributed to all six of the judges in the majority, rather than to a single judge. The Court held that the amendment to the ''Supreme Court Act'' was not simply declaratory of the previous law, but an actual change to the composition of the Court, and was therefore ''ultra vires'' federal Parliament. A change to the composition of the Court can only be made by a unanimous constitutional amendment under s. 41 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982''. The appointment of Justice Nadon was therefore void ''ab initio''.  He remained a supernumerary judge of the Federal Court of Appeal.

===Dissent by Justice Moldaver===
[[Michael J. Moldaver|Justice Moldaver]] dissented.  He argued that section 5 and section 6 of the ''Supreme Court Act'' had to be read together, and that the requirement in section 6 that Quebec appointees be from "among the advocates of that province" included former members of the Quebec bar, the same as for appointments from the other provinces under section 5.

===Recusal by Justice Rothstein===
[[Marshall Rothstein|Justice Rothstein]] did not participate in the decision. He had been appointed from the Federal Court of Appeal, leading to the possibility that his right to be appointed might be called into question. However, since he had previously been a member of the bar of Manitoba, the decision did not leave his appointment in doubt, since he qualified under the general appointee principle set out in section 5 of the ''Supreme Court Act''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10930">{{Contains special characters}}[[Unicode]] contains a number of characters that represent various [[cultural symbol|cultural]], [[political symbolism|political]], and [[religious symbol|religious]] symbols.  
Most but not all of these are in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block.

Most of them are treated as [[symbol|graphic symbol]]s that are not [[Character (computing)|character]]s.
&lt;ref&gt;Jukka Korpela, ''Unicode Explained'', O'Reilly, 2006, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
Exceptions to this include characters in certain writing systems that are also in use as political or religious symbols, such as ࿕ (U+0FD5), the [[swastika]] encoded as a [[Chinese character]];
or ॐ (U+0950), the [[Om]] symbol which is strictly speaking a [[Devanagari]] ligature. 
A special case is ﷲ (U+FDF2), which is a special ligature of Arabic script used only for writing of the word ''[[Allah]]''.  It is in the [[Arabic Presentation Forms-A]] block which was encoded for compatibility only and is not recommended for use in regular Arabic text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/faq/middleeast.html|title=FAQ: Middle Eastern Scripts and Languages|publisher=Unicode Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unicode defines the semantics of a character by its character identity and its [[Unicode character property|''normative properties'']], one of these being the character's ''general category'', given as a two-letter code (e.g. ''Lu'' for "uppercase letter"). 
Characters that fall in the "political or religious" category are given the "general category" ''So'', which is the catch-all category for "Symbol, other", i.e. anything considered a "symbol" which does not fall in any of the three other categories of 
''Sm'' (mathematical symbols), ''Sc'' (currency symbols) or ''Sk'' (phonetic modifier symbols, i.e. [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] signs not considered letters).&lt;ref&gt;"In a set containing ☯, ☮ and ☭, there is something for every taste &amp;mdash; within the limits of political correctness, of course, and a certain technocratic ethical standard. Unicode has not yet created a category for ostentatious religious suymbols, but one should not be long in coming..."
Yannis Haralambous, P. Scott Horne (trans.), ''Fonts &amp; Encodings'',  O'Reilly, 2007, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=qrElYgVLDwYC&amp;pg=PA102&amp;lpg=PA102#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 102]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another short section of two symbols is headed "Medical and healing symbols", including U+2624 ☤ [[Caduceus]] (c.f. U+1F750 &amp;#x1F750; "alchemical symbol for caduceus"), U+2695 ⚕ "[[staff of Aesculapius]] and U+2625 ☥ [[Ankh]], all of which originate in religious (polytheistic) tradition.&lt;ref name="U1F300"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6419">The '''right to petition government for redress of grievances''' is the [[human rights|right]] to make a complaint to, or seek the assistance of, one's [[government]], without fear of punishment or reprisals, ensured by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] (1791). Article 44 of the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] ensures the right to petition to the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights  of the European Union (2000)]], Article 44&lt;/ref&gt;  
The right can be traced back to the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]], Article 17&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the [[Petition of Right|Petition of Right  (1628)]], and [[Magna Carta|Magna Carta (1215)]].

==Jurisdictions==
===United States===
{{Main|Right to petition in the United States}}
The prohibition of abridgment of the "right to [[petition]]" originally referred only to the [[United States Congress|Congress]] and the [[US federal courts]]. The [[incorporation doctrine]] later expanded the protection of the right to its current scope, over all state and federal courts and legislatures, and the executive branches of the state&lt;ref name="ifac1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisfirstamendmentcenter.com/petition.php |publisher=Illinois First Amendment Center |title=The Right to Petition |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411172748/http://www.illinoisfirstamendmentcenter.com/petition.php |archivedate=April 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and federal governments.

The right to petition includes, under its umbrella, the petition. For example, in January 2006, the US Senate considered S. 2180,&lt;ref name="s.2180"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s2180|publisher=govtrack.us|title=Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; an omnibus "ethics reform" bill. This bill contained a provision (Section 204)&lt;ref name="section204"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/s2180/text/is#link=II_204_a_2_~Q1_18_~T1&amp;nearest=idDA833CD0144B4F8A95945AEBE61D69F8:|title=Section 204|publisher=govtrack.us}}{{citation broken|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish federal regulation, for the first time, of certain efforts to encourage "grassroots [[lobbying]]". The bill said that "'grassroots lobbying' means the voluntary efforts of members of the general public to communicate their own views on an issue to Federal officials or to encourage other members of the general public to do the same".

This provision was opposed by a broad array of organizations, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], the [[National Right to Life Committee]], and the [[National Rifle Association]].{{Citation needed|reason=source?|date=December 2011}} On January 18, 2007, the [[United States Senate|US Senate]] voted 55-43 to strike Section 221 from the bill.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

There are ongoing conflicts between organizations that wish to impose greater restrictions on citizen's attempts to influence or "lobby" policymakers.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/petition/topic.aspx?topic=sue |publisher=First Amendment Center |first=Adam |last=Newton |title=Petition - Right to sue |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324191941/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/petition/topic.aspx?topic=sue |archivedate=March 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the right of individuals, groups, and corporations (via [[corporate personhood]] {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}), to [[lobbying|lobby]]&lt;ref name="ifac1"/&gt; the government.

Another controversial bill, the [[Executive Branch Reform Act (2007)|Executive Branch Reform Act]], H.R. 984, would require over 8,000 Executive Branch officials to report into a public database nearly any "significant contact" from any "private party", a term that the bill defines to include almost all persons other than government officials. The bill defines "significant contact" to be any "oral or written communication (including electronic communication) . . . in which the private party seeks to influence official action by any officer or employee of the executive branch of the United States." This covers all forms of [[communication]], one way or two ways, including [[Letter (message)|letters]], [[fax]]es, [[e-mail]]s, phone messages, and petitions. The bill is supported by some organizations as an expansion of "government in the sunshine", but other groups oppose it as an infringing on the right to petition by making it impossible for citizens to communicate their views on controversial issues to government officials without those communications becoming a matter of [[public record]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/FreeSpeech/WaxmanDavisHR984.pdf Memorandum] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401080352/http://www.nrlc.org/FreeSpeech/WaxmanDavisHR984.pdf |date=2007-04-01 }}: "Congressman Waxman advances grave new threat to citizens’ ‘right to petition’ government officials," by Douglas Johnson and Susan Muskett, J.D., National Right to Life Committee, February 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrlc.org/FreeSpeech/DoJletteronHR984.pdf Letter from Richard D.

Since its inception in 1954, the [[Church of Scientology]] has been involved in a number of controversies, including its stance on psychiatry, Scientology's legitimacy as a religion, the Church's aggressive attitude in dealing with its perceived enemies and critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Branch |first= Craig |year= 1998 |title= Church of Scientology: A Religious Mafia? |url= http://www.watchman.org/Sci/scientologymafia.htm |work= The Watchmen Expositor |publisher= [[Watchman Fellowship|Watchman Fellowship ministry]] |volume= 15 |issue= 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=James R.|title=Handbook of Scientology|date=2017|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004330542|page=322|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_dfzDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA322|accessdate=30 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; allegations of mistreatment of members, and predatory financial practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chryssides|first1=George D.|title=Exploring New Religions|date=2001|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=9780826459596|page=289|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S4_rodMYMygC&amp;pg=PA289|accessdate=30 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example the high cost of religious training&lt;ref name=Lewis09 /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:191&lt;/sup&gt; and perceived exploitative practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Misiroglu|first1=Gina|title=American Countercultures: An Encyclopedia of Nonconformists, Alternative Lifestyles, and Radical Ideas in U.S. History|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317477297|page=646|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j4KsBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA646|accessdate=30 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; When mainstream media outlets have reported alleged abuses, representatives of the church have tended to deny such allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Joel |last=Sappell |title=On the Offensive Against an Array of Suspected Foes |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062990x,0,5646473.story |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 29, 1990 |accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The church maintains strict control over the use of its [[symbol]]s, names and religious texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teaching New Religious Movements|last=Bromley|first=David|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2007|page=295|isbn=0-19-517729-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although U.S. intellectual property law allows for "[[fair use]]" of material for commentary, parody, educational purposes, etc., critics of the church such as [[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]] have argued the church unfairly and illegally uses the legal system to suppress "fair" uses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerryarmstrong.org/50grand/disclaimer.html |title=Gerry Armstrong-Everything Scientology Shysters Need to Know |publisher=Gerryarmstrong.org |date=2002-03-28 |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; including suppressing any mention of the [[Space opera in Scientology|space opera]] aspects of the religion, including the story of [[Xenu]].&lt;ref name="Lewis09"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MtW90YkkB3gC|title=Scientology|last=Lewis|first=James R.|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199715954|location=Oxford|pages=|oclc=320624058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:371-383&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8lgHtauc5R4C&amp;pg=PA104|title=The church of scientology : a history of a new religion|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|date=2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=9780691146089|location=Princeton|pages=104|oclc=720261416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example critics cited is a 1995 lawsuit against the ''[[Washington Post]]'' newspaper ''[[et al.]]'' The [[Religious Technology Center]] (RTC), the corporation controlling [[L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard]]'s copyrighted materials, sued to prevent a ''Post'' reporter from describing church teachings at the center of another lawsuit, claiming copyright infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and the circulation of their "advanced technology" teachings would cause "devastating, cataclysmic spiritual harm" to those not prepared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Cyber Rights: Defending Free Speech in the Digital Age]]|last=Godwin|first=Mike|publisher=MIT Press|year=2003|page=218|isbn=0-8129-2834-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her judgment in favor of the ''Post'', Judge Leonie Brinkema noted:

{{quote|When the RTC first approached the Court with its ''[[ex parte]]'' request for the seizure warrant and Temporary Restraining Order, the dispute was presented as a straight-forward one under copyright and trade secret law. However, the Court is now convinced that the primary motivation of RTC in suing Lerma, DGS and the ''Post'' is to stifle criticism of Scientology in general and to harass its critics. As the increasingly vitriolic rhetoric of its briefs and oral argument now demonstrates, the RTC appears far more concerned about criticism of Scientology than vindication of its secrets.|U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema, ''Religious Technology Center v. Arnaldo Lerma, Washington Post, Mark Fisher, and Richard Leiby'', 29 November 1995}}

==Scientology and psychiatry==
{{Main|Scientology and psychiatry}}
There have been a number of controversies between Scientology and psychiatry since the founding of the [[Church of Scientology]] in 1952. Scientology is publicly, and often vehemently, opposed to both [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first=Paulette | last=Cooper | authorlink=Paulette Cooper | title=Scientology Versus Medicine in Scandal of Scientology | publisher =Web Edition| year=1997 | url= http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/tsos/sos-16.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mieszkowskii |first=Katharine |title=Scientology's War on Psychiatry |journal=[[Salon.com]] |year=2005 |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/index_np.html?pn=1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120710060622/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2005/07/01/sci_psy/index_np.html?pn=1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists view psychiatry as a barbaric and corrupt profession and encourage alternative care based on [[spiritual healing]]. According to the Church of Scientology, psychiatry has a long history of improper and abusive care. The group's views have been disputed, criticized and condemned by experts in the medical and scientific community and been a source of public controversy.

The Church of Scientology's objection to secular ideas about mental health are religious in nature, based on the conviction that humans are essentially divine beings who have been marred by negative experiences acquired over several lifetimes. Scientology also purports that the secular perception of what is mentally normal are not based on science, a contradiction to the claims of psychiatry and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Neusner |first1=Jacob |title=World Religions in America |edition=4 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |year=2009 |accessdate=2015-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church founded an [[anti-psychiatry]] organization called [[Citizens Commission on Human Rights]] (CCHR), which operates a museum in [[Hollywood, California]] called [[Psychiatry: An Industry of Death]]. The museum is dedicated to criticizing what it describes as "an industry driven entirely by profit".&lt;ref&gt;"Museum Targets Psychiatry As An "Industry Of Death"", CCHR press release, December 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; It has a variety of displays and exhibits that highlight [[biological psychiatry|physical psychiatric treatments]], such as [[physical restraint|restraints]], [[psychoactive drug]]s, [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and [[psychosurgery]] (including [[lobotomy]], a procedure abandoned in the 1960s&lt;ref name=xray13&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gunderman|first1=Richard B.|title=X-ray vision : the evolution of medical imaging and its human significance|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199976249|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UtA8BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA125|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=biopsych07&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kalat|first1=James W.|title=Biological psychology|date=2007|publisher=Wadsworth/Thomson Learning|location=Belmont, California|isbn=9780495090793|page=101|edition=9th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vM7zwhSwwPsC&amp;pg=PT127|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

=="Attack the Attacker" policy==
Scientology has a reputation for hostile action toward anyone who criticizes it in a public forum; executives within the organization have proclaimed Scientology is "not a [[Turn the other cheek|turn-the-other-cheek]] religion".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news | url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913995,00.html | title = A Sci-Fi Faith | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=July 24, 2009 | date=1976-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists, politicians, former Scientologists and various anti-[[cult]] groups have made accusations of wrongdoing against Scientology since the 1960s, and Scientology has targeted these critics - almost without exception - for retaliation, in the form of lawsuits and public counter-accusations of personal wrongdoing. Many of Scientology's critics have also reported they were subject to threats and harassment in their private lives.&lt;ref name="Behar2"&gt;{{cite news | first = Richard | last = Behar | authorlink = Richard Behar | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972886,00.html | title = The Scientologists and Me | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 1991-05-06}}

The organization's actions reflect a formal policy for dealing with criticism instituted by [[L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard]], called "attack the attacker". Hubbard codified this policy in the latter half of the 1960s in response to government investigations into the organization. In 1966, Hubbard wrote a criticism of the organization's behavior and noted the "correct procedure" for attacking enemies of Scientology:

{{quote|
:(1) Spot who is attacking us.
:(2) Start investigating them promptly for felonies or worse using own professionals, not outside agencies.
:(3) Double curve our reply by saying we welcome an investigation of them.
:(4) Start feeding lurid, blood, sex, crime actual evidence on the attackers to the press.

:Don't ever tamely submit to an investigation of us. Make it rough, rough on attackers all the way. You can get "reasonable about it" and lose. Sure we break no laws. Sure we have nothing to hide. BUT attackers are simply an anti-Scientology propaganda agency so far as we are concerned. They have proven they want no facts and will only lie no matter what they discover. So BANISH all ideas that any fair hearing is intended and start our attack with their first breath. Never wait. Never talk about us—only them. Use their blood, sex, crime to get headlines. Don't use us. I speak from 15 years of experience in this. There has never yet been an attacker who was not reeking with crime. All we had to do was look for it and murder would come out.|''Attacks on Scientology'', "Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letter", 25 February 1966}}

===''Scientology and Me''===
{{Main|Scientology and Me}}

In 2007 a [[BBC]] documentary on Scientology by reporter [[John Sweeney (journalist)|John Sweeney]] came under scrutiny by Scientologists. Sweeney alleged "While making our BBC [[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]] film ''[[Scientology and Me]]'' I have been shouted at, spied on, had my hotel invaded at midnight, denounced as a 'bigot' by star Scientologists, brain-washed—that is how it felt to me—in a mock up of a [[Nazi]]-style torture chamber and chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers". This resulted in a video being distributed by Scientologists of a shouting match between Sweeney and Scientology spokesman [[Thomas W. Davis|Tommy Davis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Sweeney | first = John| title = Row over Scientology video| publisher = BBC News| date = 14 May 2007| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6650545.stm| accessdate = 2008-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church has reportedly released a DVD accusing the BBC of organising a demonstration outside a Scientology office in London, during which "terrorist death threats" were made against Scientologists. The BBC described the allegations as "clearly laughable and utter nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Adams | first = Stephen

&lt;/ref&gt; Sandy Smith, the BBC programme's producer, commented the church of Scientology has "no way of dealing with any kind of criticism at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;!-- The Guardian article, by Mark SWENEY (one 'e'), is about the BBC TV programme by John SWEENEY (two 'e's)--&gt;

===Fair Game===
{{Main|Fair Game (Scientology)}}
Hubbard detailed his rules for attacking critics in a number of policy letters, including one often quoted by critics as "the [[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]] policy". This allowed those who had been declared enemies of the Church, called "[[suppressive person]]s" (SPs), "May be deprived of property or injured by any means...May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed". (taken from HCOPL Oct. 18, 1967 Issue IV, ''Penalties for Lower Conditions'' )

The aforementioned policy was canceled and replaced by HCOPL July 21, 1968, ''Penalties for Lower Conditions''. The wordings "May be deprived of property or injured by any means...May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed", are not found in this reference.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry into the Practice and Effects of Scientology'': Report by Sir John Foster, K.B.E., Q.C., M.P. – Published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office, London, December 1971, [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/foster07.html Chapter 7] (also referred to as the [[Foster Report]])&lt;/ref&gt; Scientology critics argue only the term but not the practice was removed. To support this contention, they refer to "HCO Policy Letter of October 21, 1968" which says, "The practice of declaring people FAIR GAME will cease. FAIR GAME may not appear on any Ethics Order. It causes bad public relations. This P/L does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling of a [[Suppressive Person|SP]]."&lt;!--p. 188--&gt;&lt;ref name="Double Crossed"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tony |last=Ortega |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/double-crossed|title=Double Crossed |work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|date= 1999-12-23|accessdate=2006-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a book by Omar Garrison, HCOPL March 7, 1969, was created under pressure by the government of New Zealand. Garrison quotes from the HCOPL, "We are going in the direction of mild ethics and involvement with the Society". Garrison then states, "It was partly on the basis of these policy reforms that the New Zealand Commission of Inquiry recommended that no legislative action be taken against Scientology".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Garrison, Omar ''PLAYING DIRTY The Secret War Against Beliefs'' Ralton-Pilot, Los Angeles, 1980 pg 172-173 {{ISBN|0-931116-04-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of Omar Garrison for this is most likely the [[Dumbleton-Powles Report]], additional data and quotations are found in this report.&lt;ref&gt;''The Commission of Inquiry Into the Hubbard Scientology Organisation in New Zealand''; Chairman: [[Guy Powles|Sir Guy Richardson Powles]], K.B.E., C.M.G.; Member: E.&amp;nbsp;V. Dumbleton, Esquire, June 1969, [http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/nz02.html page 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, top officials of Scientology's "Guardian's Office", an internal security force run by Hubbard's wife, Mary Sue Hubbard, admitted that fair game was policy in the GO. (''U.S. v. Kember'', Budlong Sentencing Memorandum – Undated, 1981).

In separate cases in 1979 and 1984, attorneys for Scientology argued the Fair Game policy was in fact a core belief of Scientology and as such deserved protection as religious expression.&lt;ref&gt;''Wollersheim v. Church of Scientology of California'', Court of Appeal of the State of California, civ.no.B023193, 18 July 1989, [http://www.lermanet2.com/reference/wollersheim.htm (courtesy link)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Dead agenting"===
In the 1970s, Hubbard continued to codify the policy of "attacking the attacker" and assigned a term to used frequently within Scientology: "dead agenting". Used as a [[verb]], "dead agenting" is described by Hubbard as a technique for countering negative accusations against Scientology by diverting the critical statements and making counter-accusations against the accuser; in other words, to "attack the attacker". Hubbard defined the PR ([[public relations]]) policy on "dead agenting" in a 1974 bulletin:

{{quote|The technique of proving utterances false is called "DEAD AGENTING." It's in the first book of Chinese espionage. When the enemy agent gives false data, those who believed him but now find it false kill him—or at least cease to believe him. So the PR slang for it is 'Dead Agenting.'"|L. Ron Hubbard, ''Board Policy Letter, PR Series 24: Handling Hostile Contacts/Dead Agenting'', May 30, 1974.}}

The phrase comes from a misunderstanding of the chapter on espionage in ''[[The Art of War]]''. The Scientology-sponsored website, religiousfreedomwatch.org, features depictions of so-called "anti-religious extremists", most of them critics of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring photos of the critics and claimed evidence of their personal wrongdoing (sometimes very vague, for example: "Documentation received by Religious Freedom Watch shows that [Kristi] Wachter paid an individual to carry out a specific project for her, and also instructed this individual to lie about what he was doing in case he was caught"). The "Religious Freedom Watch" site is often cited by [[alt.religion.scientology]] users as a contemporary example of "dead agenting".

Dead agenting has also been carried out by flier campaigns against some critics—using so-called "DA fliers". [[Bonnie Woods]], an ex-member who began counseling people involved with Scientology and their families, became a target along with her husband in 1993 when the Church of Scientology started a leaflet operation denouncing her as a "hate campaigner" with demonstrators outside their home and around [[East Grinstead]]. After a long battle of libel suits, in 1999, the church agreed to issue an apology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escapeint.org/legal/apology.htm Church of Scientology apology to Bonnie Woods] from the Church of Scientology and other defendants, 8 June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and to pay £55,000 damages and £100,000 costs to the Woods.&lt;ref&gt;''Stars' cult pays out £155,000 over hate campaign'', Richard Palmer, [[Daily Express|The Express]], 8 June 1999, [http://www.culteducation.com/reference/scientology/Scien140.html courtesy link]

===R2-45===
{{main|R2-45}}
"R2-45" is the name given by [[L. Ron Hubbard]] to what he described as "an enormously effective process for exteriorization but its use is frowned upon by this society at this time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hubbard |first=L. Ron |title=The Creation of Human Ability |year=1954 | page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Scientology doctrine, exteriorization refers to the separation of the [[thetan]] (soul) from the body. According to the author Stewart Lamont, Hubbard defined R2-45 as a process by which exteriorization could be produced by shooting a person in the head with a .45 revolver.&lt;ref name="relinc"&gt;{{cite book| last1= Lamont| first1= Stewart| title=Religion Inc. : the Church of Scientology| date= 1986| publisher= Harrap| location= London| isbn= 978-0-245-54334-0|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journalist and author [[Tony Ortega (journalist)|Tony Ortega]] has suggested R2-45 may have been used neither as a murder order nor as a joke, but as a means of intimidation. The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) carried out a lengthy investigation of Scientology in the 1960s, and as part of that interviewed two prominent ex-Scientologists who said they had been sent "R2-45" letters. According to FDA records dating from 1970 that Ortega published in 2015, one of the two said he received a letter suggesting he use "a 45 caliber pistol to exteriorize himself",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonyortega.org/2015/01/20/scientologys-first-clear-l-ron-hubbard-intended-to-return-as-his-daughter-dianas-son/|title=Scientology's first 'Clear': L.

The FDA inspector noted "[t]his particular technique is a route whereby an individual places a 45 caliber pistol to his head and disassociates himself from his body."&lt;ref name=intim&gt;{{cite web|url= http://tonyortega.org/2015/03/17/more-proof-that-scientology-used-the-r2-45-method-to-intimidate-enemies/|title= More proof that Scientology used the 'R2-45' method to intimidate enemies|last=Ortega|first=Tony|work=The Underground Bunker|date= March 17, 2015| accessdate= April 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While no "R2-45 letters" have been published, orders to use R2-45 on specific individuals were published in a prominent Scientology magazine. On March 6, 1968, Hubbard issued an internal memo titled "Racket Exposed", in which he denounced twelve people as "Enemies of mankind, the planet and all life", and ordered "Any [[Sea Org]] member contacting any of them is to use Auditing Process R2-45."&lt;ref name="Wallis"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wallis | first = Roy | year = 1976 | title = [[The Road to Total Freedom]]  | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | isbn = 0-231-04200-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memo was subsequently reproduced, with another name added, in the Church of Scientology's internal journal, ''The Auditor''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Auditor'', issue #35. (Undated but copyrighted 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; Another four people were named in a second R2-45 order published in ''The Auditor'' later in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;''The Auditor'', issue #37.

==Criminal convictions of members==

Much of the controversy surrounding Scientology is reflected in the long list of legal incidents associated with the organization including the criminal convictions of core members of the Scientology organization.

In 1978, a number of Scientologists, including L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard's wife [[Mary Sue Hubbard]] (who was second in command in the organization at the time), were convicted of perpetrating what was at the time the largest incident of domestic [[espionage]] in the history of the United States, called "[[Operation Snow White]]". This involved infiltrating, wiretapping, and stealing documents from the offices of Federal attorneys and the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. The judge who convicted Mrs. Hubbard and ten accomplices described their attempt to plead [[freedom of religion]] in defense:

{{quote|It is interesting to note that the founder of their organization, unindicted co-conspirator L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard, wrote in his dictionary entitled Modern Management Technology Defined...that 'truth is what is true for you.' Thus, with the founder's blessings they could wantonly commit perjury as long as it was in the interest of Scientology.

The defendants rewarded criminal activities that ended in success and sternly rebuked those that failed. The standards of human conduct embodied in such practices represent no less than the absolute perversion of any known ethical value system.

In view of this, it defies the imagination that these defendants have the unmitigated audacity to seek to defend their actions in the name of religion.

That these defendants now attempt to hide behind the sacred principles of freedom of religion, freedom of speech, and the right to privacy—which principles they repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to violate with impunity—adds insult to the injuries which they have inflicted on every element of society.&lt;ref name=nr4186&gt;{{cite book|title=National Reporting, 1941-1986|last=Ficsher|first=Erika|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eleven church staff members, including [[Mary Sue Hubbard]] and other highly placed officials, pleaded guilty or were convicted in federal court based on evidence seized in the raids and received sentences from two to six years (some suspended).&lt;ref name=nr4186/&gt;

Other noteworthy incidents involving criminal accusations and prosecutions against the Church of Scientology include:

* On January 4, 1963, more than one hundred [[E-meter]]s were seized by [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. marshals]] at the "Founding Church of Scientology" building, now known as the [[L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard House]], located in Washington, D.C. The church was accused of making false claims that the devices effectively treated some 70 percent of all physical and mental illness. The FDA also charged that the devices did not bear adequate directions for treating the conditions for which they were recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Christopher Riche Evans | title=[[Cults of Unreason]] | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | year=1974 | isbn=0-374-13324-7}} Chapter 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Russell Miller | title=Bare-Faced Messiah: The true story of L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard | chapter = 15.

* In 1978, L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard was convicted ''[[trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by French authorities of engaging in [[fraud]], fined 35,000 [[French franc|francs]], and sentenced to four years in prison.&lt;ref name="criticsabroad"&gt;{{cite web |first=Lucy |last=Morgan |title=Abroad: Critics public and private keep pressure on Scientology |url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/32999/Worldandnation/Abroad__Critics_publi.html |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=1999-03-29 |accessdate=2007-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yLc3T9Xn?url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/32999/Worldandnation/Abroad__Critics_publi.html |archivedate=2011-05-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The head of the French Church of Scientology was convicted at the same trial and given a suspended one-year prison sentence.&lt;ref&gt;''Catholic Sentinel'', March 17, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;
* The FBI raid on the Church's headquarters revealed documentation that detailed Scientology actions against various critics of the organization. Among these documents was a plan to frame [[Gabe Cazares]], the mayor of [[Clearwater, Florida]], with a staged hit-and-run accident. Also, plans were made to discredit the skeptical organization [[CSICOP]] by spreading rumors that it was a front for the [[CIA]], and a project called "[[Operation Freakout]]" which aimed at ruining the life of [[Paulette Cooper]], author of ''The Scandal of Scientology'', an early book that had been critical of the movement.&lt;ref name="sppulitzer"&gt;{{cite news |author=Charles L.

* In 1988, the government of Spain arrested Scientology president [[Heber Jentzsch]] and ten other members of the organization on various charges including illicit association, coercion, fraud, and labor law violations.&lt;ref name="FacesNewClaims"&gt;{{cite news | first = Stephen | last = Koff | title = Scientology church faces new claims of harassment | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51440683.html?dids=51440683:51440683&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | work = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 1988-12-22 | accessdate = 2008-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jentzsch [[bail|jumped bail]], leaving Spain and returning to the United States after Scientology paid a [[bail bond]] of approximately $1 million, and he has not returned to the country since.

* The Church of Scientology long considered the [[Cult Awareness Network]] (CAN) as one of its most important enemies, and many Scientology publications during the 1980s and 1990s cast CAN (and its spokesperson at the time, Cynthia Kisser) in an unfriendly light, accusing the cult-watchdog organization of various criminal activities. After CAN was forced into bankruptcy and taken over by Scientologists in the late 1990s, Scientology proudly proclaimed this as one of its greatest victories.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

The most widely publicized death of one of the organization's members was that of 36-year-old [[Lisa McPherson]] while in the care of Scientologists at the Scientology-owned Fort Harrison Hotel, in [[Clearwater, Florida]], in 1995. McPherson, at the time, was displaying symptoms suggesting she was struggling with [[mental illness]]; in one case, she removed all of her clothes after being involved in a minor traffic accident, later remarking she had done so in hopes of obtaining counseling.&lt;ref name="publiceye98"&gt;
{{cite interview|first=Bonnie|last=Portlano|interviewer=Kristin Jeannette-Meyers|title= |work=CBS Public Eye|date=1998-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church, however, intervened to prevent McPherson from receiving psychiatric treatment and to keep her in Church custody. Records show that she was then placed in a Scientology program, the [[Introspection Rundown]], which was forced isolation used to handle a psychotic episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Thomas C.| last = Tobin| title = Scientologists decry toll of criminal case| url = http://www.sptimes.com/News/030900/TampaBay/Scientologists_decry_.shtml| work = [[St. Petersburg Times]]| date = 2000-03-09| accessdate = 2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks later, she was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital. The [[autopsy]] identified multiple [[hematoma]]s (bruises), an abrasion on the nose, and [[lesions]] that were consistent with "insect/animal bites".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shipbrook.com/jeff/CoS/autopsy.html |title=Web site: Lisa McPherson: Coroner's Report transcript |publisher=Shipbrook.com |date=2012-05-09 |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[autopsy]] showed that she had died of a [[pulmonary embolism]].

Florida authorities filed criminal charges against the Church of Scientology, who denied any responsibility for McPherson's death and vigorously contested the charges. The prosecuting attorneys ultimately dropped the criminal case. After four years, a $100 million civil lawsuit filed by Lisa McPherson's family was settled in 2004. The suit resulted in an injunction against the distribution of a film critical of Scientology, ''[[The Profit (film)|The Profit]]'', which the Church claimed was meant to influence the jury. The terms of the settlement were sealed by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Robert| last = Farley| title = Scientologists settle death suit| url = http://www.sptimes.com/2004/05/29/Tampabay/Scientologists_settle.shtml| work = St. Petersburg Times| date = 2004-05-29| accessdate = 2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elli Perkins===
{{Main|Death of Elli Perkins}}
Another crime that received substantial news coverage involved the death of  Elli Perkins. This included an installment on the [[CBS]] [[investigative journalism|investigative news]] program ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]].&lt;ref name="48hrs"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Staff  | title = Scientology – A Question of Faith: Did A Mother's Faith Contribute To Her Murder?  | work = [[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]  | pages = 1–9  | publisher =[[CBS News]]  | date = 2006-10-28  | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/25/48hours/main2124568.shtml  | accessdate =  2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins was a mother of two, a [[glass art|professional glass artist]], and a [[Scientology|Scientologist]] who lived in Western [[New York (state)|New York]]. She was a [[auditing (Scientology)|senior auditor]] at the [[Church of Scientology]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. When her then 24-year-old son Jeremy began to show strange and disturbing behavior, Elli did not seek out psychiatric care but used treatment in [[Scientology and psychiatry|accordance with Scientology]]. [[Scientologists]] believe that psychiatry "doesn't work."

First, the family sent Jeremy to Scientology's [[Sea Org]] in California. He returned home some months later because Sea Org hadn't helped. Found trespassing outside the [[University at Buffalo]] on August 14, 2001, Jeremy was arrested and remanded to a local hospital after a court-ordered psychiatric exam confirmed that he had a diagnosis of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name="nypost"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Stasi  | first = Linda  |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/item_upcaTdSlZAeJf4ly7sah1N |title = Scientology Schizo: His Mom's Religion Said, No Meds. That Edict May Have Cost Her Life| work = [[New York Post]]  | date = October 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elli Perkins later convinced the court to release her son into her custody so she could seek alternatives to psychiatry. She also refused any treatment with anti-psychotic medications.  Defense attorney John Nuchereno said that Jeremy's condition declined over the summer of 2002. He was no longer able to work in the family business.  The Church of Scientology ceased efforts to cure Jeremy and  classified him as a level III "Potential Trouble Source."

In the fall of 2002, the family consulted Dr. Conrad Maulfair, an [[osteopathic medicine in the United States|osteopathic physician]] and Scientologist.&lt;ref name="nypost" /&gt; Dr. Maulfair concluded that Jeremy needed to be purged of certain chemical toxins in his body. Maulfair said he needed to be "energized" through vitamin therapy.

Jeremy became suspicious of his mother; he thought the vitamins were poisoning him. In February 2003, Elli took Jeremy to see Albert Brown, a self-taught "natural healer."  Elli planned to send Jeremy to live with Brown for treatment.  He was to leave for Brown's on March 13, 2003, but days beforehand began to act more aggressively. On the 13th, after a shower he retrieved a steak knife  and tried to slit his wrists. Unsuccessful, Jeremy found his mother in the kitchen and attacked her as she spoke to a friend on the phone. [[Autopsy]] reports showed that Elli Perkins was stabbed 77 times.&lt;ref name="wivb"&gt;{{cite news |first=Marie|last=Rice | title = Amherst Man Accused of Stabbing Mother to Death, Pleads Not Guilty  | work = [[WIVB|WIVB TV]]  | date = 4 June 2003  | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/JeremyPerkins/Articles/wivb.com-2003-06-04.html  | accessdate = 2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeremy was charged with second degree murder but found not responsible by reason of mental disease. On January 29, 2004, after NY State Office of Mental Health exams, he was assessed  "Dangerously Mentally Ill" and committed to a secure facility.  Jeremy is on [[psychotropic medications]], which court psychiatrists state have not cured him, but have stabilized his condition.

In March 2006, an advertisement in ''[[LA Weekly]]'' blamed the Church of Scientology for Perkins' violent death.&lt;ref name="msnbcad"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Walls  | first = Jeannette  | title = Scientology foes blast Cruise in ad  | work = [[MSNBC]]  | publisher = [[NBC]]  | date = March 29, 2006  | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11878503/  | accessdate = 2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The  ''[[48 Hours (TV series)|48 Hours]]'' segment on Perkins' death aired on October 28, 2006.&lt;ref name="publiceye06"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Montopoli  | first = Brian  | title = '48 Hours' Questions Role Of Scientology In Murder, Scientologists Question CBS Ethics  | work = PublicEye  | publisher = [[CBS]]  | date = November 2, 2006  | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2006/11/02/publiceye/entry2144647.shtml  | accessdate =  2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, CBS reported they had received complaints from Scientologists.

===Noah Lottick===
Noah Lottick was an American student of [[Russia|Russian studies]] who committed suicide on May 11, 1990, by jumping from a 10th-floor hotel window, clutching his only remaining money in his hands.&lt;ref name="Lottick Time" /&gt; After his death, a controversy arose revolving around his parents' concern over his membership in the [[Church of Scientology]].

Noah Lottick had taken Scientology courses, for which he paid {{Currency|5000}}.&lt;ref name="Lottick Time"&gt;[[Richard Behar]], "[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972865,00.html Scientology: The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power]", ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', May 6, 1991, see article: [[The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lottick" /&gt; Lottick's friends and family remarked that after taking these courses he began to act strangely. They stated to ''Time'' magazine that he told them that his Scientologist teachers were [[telepathy|telepathic]], and that his father's [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] was purely [[psychosomatic]].&lt;ref name="Lottick Time" /&gt;  His parents said that he visited their home five days before his death, claiming they were spreading "false rumors" about him.&lt;ref name="Lottick Time" /&gt;

Lottick's [[suicide]] was profiled in a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' cover story that was highly critical of Scientology, "[[The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power]]", which received the [[Gerald Loeb Award]],&lt;ref name="Lottick Time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dismissed" /&gt; and later appeared in ''[[Reader's Digest]]''.&lt;ref name="Lottick Reader's Digest"&gt;October 1991, ''[[Reader's Digest]]'', [http://www.skeptictank.org/hs/dancult.htm "A Dangerous Cult Goes Mainstream"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lottick's father, Dr. [[Edward Lottick]], stated that his initial impression of Scientology was that it was similar to [[Dale Carnegie]]'s techniques. However, after his son's death, his opinion was that the organization is a "school for [[psychopath]]s".&lt;ref name="Lottick Time" /&gt;  He blamed Scientology for his son's death, although no direct connection was determined.  After Dr. Lottick's remarks were published in the media, the Church of Scientology haggled with him over {{Currency|3000}} that Noah had allegedly paid to the Church and not utilized for services.&lt;ref name="Lottick Time" /&gt;  The Church claimed Lottick had intended this to be a donation.

The [[Church of Scientology]] sued [[Richard Behar]] and ''Time'' magazine for $416 million. Dr and Mrs Lottick submitted [[affidavit]]s affirming "the accuracy of each statement in the article", and stating that Dr Lottick had "concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations". They said that no Scientology staff members attended the funeral of their son.&lt;ref name="lottick"&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/archive/legaldocs/cyberlaw/scientology1.html ''Church of Scientology v. Time and Richard Behar''], 92 Civ. 3024 (PKL), Opinion and Order, Court TV library Web site., retrieved 1 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; All counts against Behar and ''Time'' were later dismissed.&lt;ref name="dismissed"&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_July_16/ai_18489022 "Judge Dismisses Church of Scientology's $416 Million Lawsuit Against Time Magazine"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324093216/http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_July_16/ai_18489022 |date=2005-03-24 }}, [[Business Wire]], July 16, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Lottick's father cited his son's suicide as his motivation for researching [[cult]]s, in his article describing a survey of physicians that he presented to the Pennsylvania State Medical Society.&lt;ref name="Lottick PSMS Survey"&gt;[http://www.csj.org/infoserv_articles/lottick_edward_physician_experience.htm Survey Reveals Physicians' Experience with Cults], Dr. Edward Lottick, ''[[Cultic Studies Review|Cult Observer]]'', Volume 10, Number 3, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology issued a press release denying any responsibility for Lottick's suicide.&lt;ref name="Lottick Petersburg"&gt;{{cite news | first = Lucy | last = Morgan | title = Scientology got blame for French suicide | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/26196184.html?dids=26196184:26196184&amp;FMT=FT&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | work = [[St. Petersburg Times]] | date = 1998-02-08 | accessdate = 2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spokesperson [[Mike Rinder]] was quoted in the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' as saying that Lottick had an argument with his parents four days before his death.&lt;ref name="Lottick Petersburg" /&gt;  Rinder stated, "I think Ed Lottick should look in the mirror ... I think Ed Lottick made his son's life intolerable."&lt;ref name="Lottick Petersburg" /&gt;

===Brainwashing===

The Church of Scientology is frequently accused by critics of employing [[brainwashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Friedman |first=Roger |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,351426,00.html |title=Fox New: Actor Jason Beghe: Scientology Is 'Brainwashing' by Roger Friedman, Wednesday, April 16, 2008 |publisher=Foxnews.com |accessdate=2012-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101202721/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,351426,00.html# |archive-date=2008-11-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy about the existence of cultic [[brainwashing]] has become one of the most polarizing issues among cult followers, academic researchers of cults, and cult critics. Parties disagree about the existence of a social process attempting coercive influence, and also disagree about the existence of the social outcome—that people become influenced against their will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= J. Gordon Melton |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/melton.htm |title=Brainwashing and the Cults: The Rise and Fall of a Theory |publisher=Cesnur.org |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One alleged example of the Church's possible brainwashing tactics is the [[Rehabilitation Project Force]], to which church staff are assigned to work off alleged wrongdoings under conditions that many critics characterize as degrading. Some of these allegations are presented in Stephen Kent's ''Brainwashing in Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.arts.ualberta.ca/~skent/Linkedfiles/Brainwashing%20in%20Scientology%27s%20Rehabilitation%20Project%20Force%20(RPF).htm | title = Brainwashing in Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) | work = Revised Version of a Presentation at the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion, San Diego, California November 7, 1997 | first = Stephen | last = Kent | date = 1998-08-26 | accessdate = 2008-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles that claim to rebut those charges include Juha Pentikäinen's The Church of Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=moreorless |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2002/scient_rpf_01.htm |title=The Church of Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force |publisher=Cesnur.org |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Scientology have also accused L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard of authoring ''[[Brain-Washing (book)|The Brainwashing Manual]]'', but these accusations have not been confirmed. Hubbard did publish a copy of this manual on two technical bulletins, "for the benefit of the auditors who may face victims of brainwashing". Hubbard discussed brainwashing in several of his works, but these, "expose brainwashing as something that should not be practiced", and "the practice of brainwashing could only end up in disaster".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=moreorless – www.moreorless.net |url=http://www.cesnur.org/2005/brainwash_13.htm |title=L. Ron Hubbard, Kenneth Goff, and the "Brain-Washing Manual" of 1955 by Massimo Introvigne |publisher=Cesnur.org |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Anderson Report====
The final results of the [[Anderson Report]] in 1965 declared:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Board is not concerned to find that the scientology techniques are brainwashing techniques as practiced, so it is understood, in some communist-controlled countries. Scientology techniques are, nevertheless, a kind of brainwashing...The astonishing feature of Scientology is that its techniques and propagation resemble very closely those set out in a book entitled ''Brain-washing'', advertised and sold by the [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists International|HASI]]".&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;''[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/audit/ar12.html Report of the Board of Enquiry into Scientology]'', by Kevin Victor Anderson, Q.C., Published 1965 by the State of Victoria, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Disconnection===
{{Main|Disconnection}}
The Church of Scientology has been criticized for their practice of "[[disconnection]]" in which Scientologists are directed to sever all contact with family members or friends who criticize the faith. Critics including ex-members and relatives of existing members say that this practice has divided many families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Collerton |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/03/12/2844150.htm?section=justin |title=Scientology insider's nightmare childhood  |work=ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The disconnection policy is considered by critics to be further evidence that the Church is a cult. By making its members entirely dependent upon a social network entirely within the organization, critics assert that Scientologists are kept from exposure to critical perspectives on the church and are put in a situation that makes it extremely difficult for members to leave the church, since [[apostates]] will be shunned by the Church and have already been cut off from family and friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Mark | last = Sommer | title = Outside critics are unacceptable | url = http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/JeremyPerkins/Articles/buffalo-news-2005-02-02.html | work = [[Buffalo News]] | date = 2005-02-02 | accessdate = 2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unperson"/&gt;

The Church of Scientology acknowledges that its members are strongly discouraged from associating with "enemies of Scientology", and likens the disconnection policy to the practice of shunning in religions such as the [[Amish]]. However, there is a consensus of religious scholars who oppose Scientology's practice:
"I just think it would be better for all concerned if they just let them go ahead and get out and everyone goes their own way, and not make such a big deal of it, the policy hurts everybody." [[J. Gordon Melton]], Institute for the Study of American Religion, Santa Barbara, California.&lt;ref name="unperson"&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert Farley |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml |title=The unperson |work=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=2006-06-24 |pages=1A, 14A |accessdate=2006-06-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604102718/http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml |archivedate=2011-06-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"It has to do with feeling threatened because you're not that big. You do everything you can to keep unity in the group." Frank K. Flinn, [[Washington University]], St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;ref name="unperson" /&gt;

"Some people I've talked to, they just wanted to go on with their lives and they wanted to be in touch with their daughter or son or parent. The shunning was just painful. And I don't know what it was accomplishing. And the very terms they use are scary, aren't they?" Newton Maloney, [[Fuller Theological Seminary]], Pasadena, California.&lt;ref name="unperson" /&gt;

===Use of donations and preferential treatment of Scientologist celebrities===
[[Andre Tabayoyon]], a former Scientologist and [[Sea Org]] staffer, testified in a 1994 affidavit that money from not-for-profit Scientology organizations and labor from those organizations (including the [[Rehabilitation Project Force]]) had gone to provide special facilities for Scientology celebrities, which were not available to other Scientologists:

"A Sea Org staffer...was taken along to do personal cooking for [[Tom Cruise]] and [[David Miscavige|{{interpolation|David}} Miscavige]] at the expense of Scientology not for profit religious organizations. This left only 3 cooks at [[Gold Base|Gold {{interpolation|Base}}]] to cook for 800 people three times a day...apartment cottages were built for the use of [[John Travolta]], [[Kirstie Alley]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Priscilla Presley]], and other Scientology celebrities who are carefully prevented from finding out the real truth about the Scientology organization ... Miscavige decided to redo the meadow in beautiful flowers; Tens of thousands of dollars were spent on the project so that [[Tom Cruise|{{interpolation|Tom}} Cruise]] and [[Nicole Kidman|{{interpolation|Nicole}} Kidman]] could romp there. However, Miscavige inspected the project and didn't like it. So the whole meadow was plowed up, destroyed, replowed and sown with plain grass."&lt;ref&gt;Tabayoyon, Andre. 1994. 'Declaration of Andre Tabayoyon.' In ''Church of Scientology International v. Steven Fishman and Uwe Geertz''. United States District Court, Central District of California. Case No. CV 91 6426 HLH (Tx), (4 April): 64 pp&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabayoyon's account of the planting of the meadow was supported by another former Scientologist, Maureen Bolstad, who said that a couple of dozen Scientologists including herself were put to work on a rainy night through dawn on the project. "We were told that we needed to plant a field and that it was to help Tom impress Nicole...but for some mysterious reason it wasn't considered acceptable by Mr. Miscavige. So the project was rejected and they redid it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author = Hoffman, Claire |author2=Christensen, Kim  |url = http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-scientology18dec18,0,7000009,full.story?coll=la-home-headlines |title = Tom Cruise and Scientology |work = Los Angeles Times |date = 2005-12-18 |accessdate = 2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legitimacy of Scientology as a religion==
{{Main|Scientology status by country}}

[[Image:Scientology warning leaflet.jpg|right|thumb|Official German warning leaflets (PDF:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stmi.bayern.de/service/publikationen/detail/16672/ Verfassungsschutz Bayern (Constitution Protection Bavaria: Publications (German))] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510195456/http://www.stmi.bayern.de/service/publikationen/detail/16672/ |date=May 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) on threats to democracy, including [[Islamism|Islamic extremism]], [[Scientology]] and [[organized crime]].]]
The nature of Scientology is hotly debated in many countries. The [[Church of Scientology]] pursues an extensive [[public relations]] campaign arguing Scientology is a ''[[Good faith|bona fide]]'' [[religion]]. The organization cites a number of studies and experts who support their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bonafidescientology.org/ |title=Church of Scientology: The Bonafides of the Scientology Religion |publisher=Bonafidescientology.org |date=2011-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics point out most cited studies were commissioned by Scientology to produce the desired results.

Many countries (including Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom), while not prohibiting or limiting the activities of the Church of Scientology, have rejected its applications for [[tax exemption|tax-exempt]], charitable status or recognition as a religious organization; it has been variously judged to be a commercial enterprise or a dangerous [[cult]].

Scientology is legally accepted as a religion in the United States and Australia, and enjoys the constitutional protections afforded to religious practice in each country. In October 1993, the U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] recognized the Church as an "organization operated exclusively for religious and charitable purposes".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-news/ir-97-50.txt&lt;/ref&gt; The Church offers the tax exemption as proof that it is a religion. (This subject is examined in the article on the [[Church of Scientology]]).

In 1982, the [[High Court of Australia]] ruled the State Government of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] lacked the right to declare the Church of Scientology was not a religion.&lt;ref name="Scientology HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax (Victoria) |parallelcite=(1983) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |date=27 October 1983 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found the issue of belief to be the central feature of religion, regardless of the presence of [[charlatan]]ism: ''Charlatanism is a necessary price of religious freedom, and if a self-proclaimed teacher persuades others to believe in a religion which he propounds, lack of sincerity or integrity on his part is not incompatible with the religious character of the beliefs, practices and observances accepted by his followers."&lt;ref name="Scientology HCA"/&gt;{{rp|para 26|quote=per Mason ACJ &amp; Brennan J}}

Other countries to have recognized Scientology as a religion include Spain,&lt;ref name="afpspain"&gt;{{cite web

===L. Ron Hubbard and starting a religion for money===
{{Further|Scientology as a business}}
While the oft-cited rumor Hubbard made a bar bet with [[Robert A. Heinlein]] he could start a cult is unproven, many witnesses have reported Hubbard making statements in their presence starting a religion would be a good way to make money. These statements have led many to believe Hubbard hid his true intentions and was motivated solely by potential financial rewards.

Editor [[Sam Merwin]], for example, recalled a meeting: "I always knew he was exceedingly anxious to hit big money—he used to say he thought the best way to do it would be to start a cult." (December 1946)&lt;ref name="Bare-faced Messiah"&gt;{{cite book | last = Miller | first = Russell | authorlink = Russell Miller | title = Bare-faced Messiah, The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard | url = http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/bfm/bfmconte.htm | edition = First American | year = 1987 | publisher = Henry Holt &amp; Co | location = New York | isbn = 0-8050-0654-0 | page = 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and publisher [[Lloyd Arthur Eshbach]] reported Hubbard saying "I'd like to start a religion. That's where the money is." Writer [[Theodore Sturgeon]] reported Hubbard made a similar statement at the [[Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society]]. Likewise, writer [[Sam Moskowitz]] reported in an affidavit during an [[Eastern Science Fiction Association]] meeting on November 11, 1948, Hubbard had said "You don't get rich writing science fiction. If you want to get rich, you start a religion."&lt;ref&gt;Sam Moskowitz affidavit, 14 April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton A. Rothman]] also reported to his son [[Tony Rothman]] he heard Hubbard make exactly that claim at a science fiction convention. In 1998, an [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] documentary titled "Inside Scientology" shows [[Lyle Stuart]] reporting Hubbard stated repeatedly to make money, "you start a religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Inside Scientology | publisher = [[A&amp;E Network]] | date = 1998-12-14 | url = http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5464180198469193501 | accessdate = 2007-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', ed. Brian Ash, Harmony Books, 1977:

:" . . .[Hubbard] began making statements to the effect that any writer who really wished to make money should stop writing and develop [a] religion, or devise a new psychiatric method. [[Harlan Ellison]]'s version (''Time Out'', UK, No 332) is that Hubbard is reputed to have told [[John W. Campbell|[John W.] Campbell]], "I'm going to invent a religion that's going to make me a fortune. I'm tired of writing for a penny a word". [[Sam Moskowitz]], a chronicler of science fiction, has reported that he himself heard Hubbard make a similar statement, but there is no first-hand evidence".

The following letter, written by L. Ron Hubbard, was discovered by the FBI during its raid on Scientology headquarters. The letter shows Hubbard turned Scientology into a "religion" for financial reasons:

&lt;blockquote&gt;

DEAR HELEN {{align|right|10 APRIL}}

&lt;center&gt;RE CLINIC, HAS&lt;/center&gt;

The arrangements that have been made seem a good temporary measure. On a longer look, however, something more equitable will have to be organized. I am not quite sure what we would call the place – probably not a clinic – but I am sure that it ought to be a company, independent of the HAS {{interp|the [[Hubbard Association of Scientologists]]}} but fed by the HAS. We don't want a clinic. We want one in operation but not in name. Perhaps we could call it a Spiritual Guidance Center. Think up its name, will you. And we could put in nice desks and our boys in neat blue with diplomas on the walls and 1.&amp;nbsp;knock psychotherapy into history and 2.&amp;nbsp;make enough money to shine up my operating scope and 3.&amp;nbsp;keep the HAS solvent. It is a problem of practical business. I await your reaction on the religion angle. In my opinion, we couldn't get worse public opinion than we have had or have less customers with what we've got to sell. A religious charter would be necessary in Pennsylvania or NJ to make it stick. But I sure could make it stick. We're treating the present time beingness, psychotherapy treats the past and the brain. And brother, that's religion, not mental science.

====Free Zone suppression====

{{Main|Free Zone (Scientology)}}

The Church has taken steps to [[Suppressive Person|suppress]] the Free Zone, the term for a variety of groups and individuals who practice Scientology outside the strictures of the Church of Scientology proper, and shut down dissenters when possible. The CoS has used [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] laws to attack various Free Zone groups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Accordingly, the Free Zone avoids the use of officially trademarked Scientology words, including 'Scientology' itself. In 2000, the [[Religious Technology Center]] unsuccessfully attempted to gain the Web domain www.scientologie.org from the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], in a legal action against the Free Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Litigation as harassment of critics====
{{Expand section|date=January 2008}}
In the past many critics of Scientology have claimed they were harassed by [[frivolous litigation|frivolous]] and [[vexatious litigation|vexatious]] lawsuits.

[[Paulette Cooper]] was falsely accused of felony charges as she had been framed by the Church of Scientology's [[Guardian's Office]]. Furthermore, her personal life had been intruded upon by Scientologists who had attempted to kill her and/or draw her to suicide in a covert plan known as [[Operation Freakout]] brought to light after FBI investigations into other matters (See [[Operation Snow White]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Charles |last=Stafford |title=Church tried to infiltrate Pinellas police agencies |url=http://www.antisectes.net/sp-times-scientology-special-report-pulitzer-price.pdf#page=13 |work=Scientology: An in-depth profile of a new force in Clearwater |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=1980-01-09 |accessdate=2008-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124225356/http://www.antisectes.net/sp-times-scientology-special-report-pulitzer-price.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-24 |df= }} [http://sptimes.com/2006/webspecials06/scientology/Scientology_Special_Report.pdf Original] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809193839/http://sptimes.com/2006/webspecials06/scientology/Scientology_Special_Report.pdf |date=2007-08-09 }} (PDF), 18M&lt;/ref&gt;

A prominent example of litigation of its critics is the Church of Scientology's $416 million [[libel]] lawsuit [[s:Church of Scientology v. Behar]] against [[Time Warner]] as a result of their publication of a highly critical magazine article "[[The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power]]" by [[Richard Behar]]. A public campaign by the Church of Scientology accordingly ensued in an attempt to defame this Time Magazine publication. (See [[Thriving cult of greed and power#Post-publication|Church of Scientology's response]])

Gareth Alan Cales is being harassed by the Church of Scientology, including false charges against him and his friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Tasha Paradise |url=http://laist.com/2008/03/23/church_of_scien.php |title=Church of Scientology Strikes Back – Anonymous Responds |publisher=LAist |date=2008-03-23 |accessdate=2012-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602033933/http://laist.com/2008/03/23/church_of_scien.php |archivedate=2012-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The purpose of the suit is to harass and discourage rather than to win.

The law can be used very easily to harass, and enough harassment on somebody who is simply on the thin edge anyway, well knowing that he is not authorized, will generally be sufficient to cause his professional decease. If possible, of course, ruin him utterly.|L. Ron Hubbard|A Manual on the
Dissemination of Material, 1955}}

Similarly, the Church of Scientology's legal battle with [[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]] in [[Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong]] spanned two decades and involved a $10 million claim against Armstrong.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Church of Scientology v. Armstrong|WikiSource – Church of Scientology v. Armstrong]] [[s:Church of Scientology International v. Superior Court|WikiSource – Church of Scientology v. Superior Court]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality tests==
{{Main|Oxford Capacity Analysis}}

In 2008 the [[Death of Kaja Ballo|20-year-old daughter]] of [[Olav Gunnar Ballo]], a Norwegian member of parliament, had taken a personality test organized by Scientologists in [[Nice]], and received very negative feedback from it. A few hours later she committed [[suicide]]. French police started an investigation of the Scientology church. In the wake of the Ballo suicide linked to the personality test, the spokesman for the church in Norway called the link at accusation deeply unfair, and pointing out that the daughter had previously suffered eating disorders and psychiatric troubles.&lt;ref name="ballo"/&gt;

The personality test has been condemned by the psychologist Rudy Myrvang. He called the test a recruitment tool, aimed at breaking down a person so that the Scientologists can build the test-taker back up.&lt;ref name="ballo"&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2371180.ece Police probe suicide linked to Scientologists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506140937/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article2371180.ece |date=2010-05-06 }} [[Aftenposten]], April 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the 1993 IRS decision granting Scientology tax-exempt status, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists and began to note Scientologists' complaints of harassment and discrimination in its annual [[United States' Country Reports on Human Rights Practices|Human Rights Reports]], starting from the 1993 report.&lt;ref name="NY Times tax exempt status"&gt;{{cite news|first=Douglas|last=Frantz|title=Scientology's Puzzling Journey From Tax Rebel to Tax Exempt|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B05E7DE1639F93AA35750C0A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=New York Times|date=1997-03-09|accessdate=2008-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the U.S. Department of State has repeatedly expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists' individual rights posed by "sect filters", whereby potential employees are required to divulge any association with Scientology before they are considered for a job.&lt;ref name="NY Times tax exempt status" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Hartmut (2004).

In 1997, an open letter to then-German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], published as a newspaper advertisement in the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'', drew parallels between the "organized oppression" of Scientologists in Germany and [[Nazi]] policies espoused by Germany in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Wash /&gt;&lt;ref name=IHT&gt;

German officials sharply rejected the accusations.&lt;ref name=Bonfante /&gt; They said that Germany guarantees the [[freedom of religion]], but characterized Scientology as a [[Business|profit-making enterprise]], rather than a religion, and emphasized that precisely because of Germany's Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all "radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups", and not just against Scientology.&lt;ref name=Bonfante /&gt; According to a 1997 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article, most Germans consider Scientology a subversive organization, with pollsters reporting 70% popular support for banning Scientology in Germany.&lt;ref name=Bonfante /&gt;

In late 1997, the United States granted [[Right of asylum|asylum]] to a German Scientologist, [[Antje Victore]], who claimed she would be subject to [[religious persecution]] in her homeland.&lt;ref name=Asylum /&gt; In 2000, the German ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' magazine published a report asserting that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her asylum application—ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist—had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of the [[Office of Special Affairs]] and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for [[tax evasion]] at the time she applied for asylum.&lt;ref name=KentFGA&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kent | first = Stephen A. | authorlink = Stephen A.

==Scientology and Wikipedia==
{{main|Church of Scientology editing on Wikipedia}}
In an effort to adhere to [[Wikipedia policy]], the [[Arbitration Committee (English Wikipedia)|Arbitration Committee]] of the [[English Wikipedia]] decided in late-May 2009 to restrict editing from Church of Scientology [[Internet Protocol]] addresses, to prevent self-serving edits by editors within CoS-administered networks.&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/29/wikipedia-bans-scientolog_n_208967.html|last=Shea|first=Danny|title=Wikipedia Bans Scientology From Site|date=2009-05-29|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Metz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/29/wikipedia_bans_scientology/|title=Wikipedia bans Church of Scientology|last=Metz|first=Cade|date=2009-05-29|work=The Register|accessdate=2009-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[WP:ARBSCI]]&lt;/ref&gt; A "host of anti-Scientologist editors" were topic-banned as well.&lt;ref name="Huff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Metz" /&gt; The committee concluded that both sides had "gamed policy" and resorted to "battlefield tactics", with articles on living persons being the "worst casualties".&lt;ref name="Huff" /&gt;

==Church of Scientology's response to criticism==

Scientology's response to accusations of criminal behavior has been twofold; the church is under attack by an organized conspiracy, and each of the church's critics is hiding a private criminal past. In the first instance, the Church of Scientology has repeatedly stated that it is engaged in an ongoing battle against a massive, worldwide [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] whose sole purpose is to "destroy the Scientology religion." Thus, aggressive measures and legal actions are the only way the church has been able to survive in a hostile environment; they sometimes liken themselves to the early [[Mormons]] who took up arms and organized militia to defend themselves from persecution.

The church asserts that the core of the organized anti-Scientology movement is the [[psychiatry|psychiatric profession]], in league with [[deprogramming|deprogrammers]] and certain government bodies (including elements within the [[FBI]] and the government of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opposing.scientology.org/31-behnd.htm |title=What was Behind Attacks on Scientology in Spain, France, Germany and Italy? |publisher=Opposing.scientology.org |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;) These conspirators have allegedly attacked Scientology since the earliest days of the church, with the shared goal of creating a docile, mind-controlled population. As an official Scientology website explains:

:To understand the forces ranged against L.&amp;nbsp;Ron Hubbard, in this war he never started, it is necessary to gain a cursory glimpse of the old and venerable science of psychiatry-which was actually none of the aforementioned. As an institution, it dates back to shortly before the turn of the century; it is certainly not worthy of respect by reason of age or dignity; and it does not meet any known definition of a science, what with its hodgepodge of unproven theories that have never produced any result-except an ability to make the unmanageable and mutinous more docile and quiet, and turn the troubled into apathetic souls beyond the point of caring. That it promotes itself as a healing profession is a misrepresentation. Its mission is to control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opposing.scientology.org/31-issue.htm |title=The Real Issues – Those Who Oppose Scientology |publisher=Opposing.scientology.org |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, L. Ron Hubbard has proclaimed that all critics of Scientology are criminals. Hubbard wrote on numerous occasions that all of Scientology's opponents are seeking to hide their own criminal histories, and the proper course of action to stop these attacks is to "expose" the hidden crimes of the attackers. The Church of Scientology does not deny that it vigorously seeks to "expose" its critics and enemies; it maintains that all of its critics have criminal histories, and they encourage hatred and "bigotry" against Scientology. Hubbard's belief that all critics of Scientology are criminals was summarized in a policy letter written in 1967:

:Now get this as a technical ''fact'', not a hopeful idea. Every time we have investigated the background of a critic of Scientology we have found crimes for which that person or group could be imprisoned under existing law. We do not find critics of Scientology who do not have criminal pasts. Over and over we prove this. -- ''Critics of Scientology'', "Hubbard Communications Office Policy Letter", 5 November 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/critics.htm |title=Narconon Exposed: Narconon And Its Critics |publisher=2.cs.cmu.edu |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology claims that it continues to expand and prosper despite all efforts to prevent it from growing; critics claim that the Church's own statistics contradict its story of continuing growth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scientology#Membership statistics]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church of Scientology has published a number of responses to criticism available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Those Who Oppose Scientology|publisher=[[Church of Scientology]]|url=http://opposing.scientology.org|accessdate=June 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analyses of Scientology's counter-accusations and actions against its critics are available on a number of websites, including the critical archive [[Operation Clambake]].

On January 22, 2013, attorneys for the organization, as well as some of its members, reacted toward the CNN News Group, threatening legal action&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Riffer|first1=Jeffrey K.|title=Letter in response to CNN program|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/22/us/scientology-response/|accessdate=1 January 2016|quote=The media was left with bruised reputations, retractions, apologies, ruined careers, internal investigations and wasted attorney fees.

The U.S. [[Energy Independence and Security Act]] of 2007&lt;ref name=2007Act&gt;{{cite web | title = U.S. Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 | url = http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.6.ENR: | accessdate = 2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; created 2008 through 2012 funding for a new solar air conditioning research and development program, which should develop and demonstrate multiple new technology innovations and [[mass production]] [[economies of scale]]. Solar air conditioning might play an increasing role in [[zero-energy building|zero-energy]] and [[energy-plus building]]s design.{{Who|date=June 2009}}

==History==

In the late 19th century, the most common fluid for absorption cooling was a solution of [[ammonia]] and water. Today, the combination of [[lithium]] [[bromide]] and water is also in common use. One end of the system of expansion/condensation pipes is heated, and the other end gets cold enough to make ice. Originally, natural gas was used as a heat source in the late 19th century. Today, [[propane]] is used in recreational vehicle absorption chiller refrigerators. Hot water solar thermal energy collectors can also be used as the modern "free energy" heat source.
A National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) sponsored report in 1976 surveyed solar energy system applications of air conditioning.  Techniques discussed included both solar powered (absorption cycle and heat engine / Rankine cycle) and solar related (heat pump) along with an extensive bibliography of related literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nash|first1=J.M.|last2=Harstad|first2=A.J.|title=Application of Solar Energy to Air Conditioning Systems (1976)|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19780009540|website=NASA Technical Reports Server|accessdate=November 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photovoltaic (PV) solar cooling==
{{Main|Photovoltaic electricity}}

[[Photovoltaics]] can provide the power for any type of electrically powered cooling be it conventional compressor-based or adsorption/absorption-based, though the most common implementation is with compressors.
For small residential and small commercial cooling (less than 5&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt hour|MWh]]/[[year|a]]) PV-powered cooling has been the most frequently implemented solar cooling technology. The reason for this is debated, but commonly suggested reasons include incentive structuring, lack of residential-sized equipment for other solar-cooling technologies, the advent of more efficient electrical coolers, or ease of installation compared to other solar-cooling technologies (like [[radiant cooling]]).

Since PV cooling's cost effectiveness depends largely on the cooling equipment and given the poor efficiencies in electrical cooling methods until recently it has not been cost effective without subsidies. Using more efficient electrical cooling methods and allowing longer payback schedules is changing that scenario.

For example, a 100,000&amp;nbsp;[[British thermal unit|BTU]] U.S. [[Energy Star]] rated&lt;ref group=note&gt;BTU rating implies an hourly rate so a 100,000&amp;nbsp;BTU rated air conditioner provides a heat removal rate of {{convert|100,000|BTU/h|kW|lk=in|abbr=on|disp=or}} under standardized conditions.&lt;/ref&gt; air conditioner with a high [[seasonal energy efficiency ratio|seasonal energy efficiency ratio (SEER)]] of 14 requires around 7&amp;nbsp;kW of electric power for full cooling output on a hot day. This would require over a 20&amp;nbsp;kW solar photovoltaic electricity generation system with storage.

A solar-tracking 7&amp;nbsp;kW photovoltaic system would probably have an installed price well over $20,000 USD (with PV equipment prices currently falling at roughly 17% per year). Infrastructure, wiring, mounting, and NEC code costs may add up to an additional cost; for instance a 3120 watt solar panel grid tie system has a panel cost of $0.99/watt peak, but still costs ~$2.2/watt hour peak. Other systems of different capacity cost even more, let alone battery backup systems, which cost even more.

A more efficient air conditioning system would require a smaller, less-expensive photovoltaic system. A high-quality [[geothermal heat pump]] installation can have a SEER in the range of 20 (±). A 100,000&amp;nbsp;BTU SEER 20 air conditioner would require less than 5&amp;nbsp;kW while operating.

Newer and lower power technology including reverse inverter DC heat pumps can achieve SEER ratings up to 26.

There are new non-compressor-based electrical air conditioning systems with a SEER above 20 coming on the market. New versions of phase-change indirect evaporative coolers use nothing but a fan and a supply of water to cool buildings without adding extra interior humidity (such as at McCarran Airport Las Vegas Nevada). In dry arid climates with relative humidity below 45% (about 40% of the continental U.S.) indirect evaporative coolers can achieve a SEER above 20, and up to SEER 40. A 100,000&amp;nbsp;BTU indirect evaporative cooler would only need enough photovoltaic power for the circulation fan (plus a water supply).

A less-expensive partial-power photovoltaic system can reduce (but not eliminate) the monthly amount of electricity purchased from the [[Electrical grid|power grid]] for air conditioning (and other uses). With American state government subsidies of $2.50 to $5.00 USD per photovoltaic watt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsireusa.org|title=Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency® - DSIRE|author=|date=|website=DSIRE|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the amortized cost of PV-generated electricity can be below $0.15 per kWh. This is currently cost effective in some areas where power company electricity is now $0.15 or more. Excess PV power generated when air conditioning is not required can be sold to the [[Electrical grid|power grid]] in many locations, which can reduce (or eliminate) annual net electricity purchase requirement. (See [[Zero-energy building]])

Superior [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] can be designed into new construction (or retrofitted to existing buildings). Since the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] was created in 1977, their [[Weatherization]] Assistance Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/weatherization/ EERE: Department of Energy Weatherization Assistance Program Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; has reduced heating-and-cooling load on 5.5 million low-income affordable homes an average of 31%. A hundred million American buildings still need improved weatherization. Careless conventional construction practices are still producing inefficient new buildings that need weatherization when they are first occupied.

It is fairly simple to reduce the heating-and-cooling requirement for new construction by one half. This can often be done at no additional net cost, since there are cost savings for smaller air conditioning systems and other benefits.

==Geothermal cooling==
[[Earth sheltering]] or [[Earth cooling tubes]] can take advantage of the ambient temperature of the Earth to reduce or eliminate conventional air conditioning requirements. In many climates where the majority of humans live, they can greatly reduce the buildup of undesirable summer heat, and also help remove heat from the interior of the building. They increase construction cost, but reduce or eliminate the cost of conventional air conditioning equipment.

Earth cooling tubes are not cost effective in hot humid tropical environments where the ambient Earth temperature approaches human temperature comfort zone. A [[solar chimney]] or [[photovoltaic]]-powered fan can be used to exhaust undesired heat and draw in cooler, dehumidified air that has passed by ambient Earth temperature surfaces. Control of humidity and condensation are important design issues.

A [[geothermal heat pump]] uses ambient Earth temperature to improve SEER for heat and cooling. A deep well recirculates water to extract ambient Earth temperature (typically at 2 gallons of water per ton per minute). These "open loop" systems were the most common in early systems, however water quality could cause damage to the coils in the heat pump and shorten the life of the equipment.  Another method is a closed loop system, in which a loop of tubing is run down a well or wells, or in trenches in the lawn, to cool an intermediate fluid. When wells are used, they are back-filled with Bentonite or another grout material to ensure good thermal conductivity to the earth.

In the past the fluid of choice was a 50/50 mixture of propylene glycol because it is non-toxic unlike ethylene glycol (which is used in car radiators). Propylene glycol is viscous, and would eventually gum up some parts in the loop(s), so it has fallen out of favor. Today, the most common transfer agent is a mixture of water and ethyl alcohol (ethanol).

Ambient earth temperature is much lower than peak summer air temperature, and much higher than the lowest extreme winter air temperature. Water is 25 times more thermally conductive than air, so it is much more efficient than an outside air heat pump, (which becomes less effective when the outside temperature drops in Winter).

The same type of geothermal well can be used without a heat pump but with greatly diminished results. Ambient Earth temperature water is pumped through a shrouded radiator (like an automobile radiator). Air is blown across the radiator, which cools without a compressor-based air conditioner. Photovoltaic solar electric panels produce electricity for the water pump and fan, eliminating conventional air-conditioning utility bills. This concept is cost-effective, as long as the location has ambient Earth temperature below the human thermal comfort zone (not the tropics).

==Solar open-loop air conditioning using desiccants==

Air can be passed over common, solid [[desiccant]]s (like [[silica gel]] or [[zeolite]]) or liquid desiccants (like lithium bromide/chloride) to draw moisture from the air to allow an efficient mechanical or [[evaporative cooler|evaporative cooling]] cycle. The desiccant is then regenerated by using [[solar thermal energy]] to dehumidfy, in a cost-effective, low-energy-consumption, continuously repeating cycle.&lt;ref&gt;San, J. Y., Lavan, Z., Worek, W. M., Jean-Baptiste Monnier, Franta, G. E., Haggard, K., Glenn, B. H., Kolar, W. A., Howell, J. R. (1982). "Exergy analysis of solar powered desiccant cooling system". Proc. of the American Section of the Intern. Solar Energy Society: 567-572&lt;/ref&gt; A [[photovoltaic]] system can power a low-energy air circulation fan, and a motor to slowly rotate a large disk filled with desiccant.

[[Energy recovery ventilation]] systems provide a controlled way of ventilating a home while minimizing energy loss. Air is passed through an "[[Thermal Wheel|enthalpy wheel]]" (often using silica gel) to reduce the cost of heating ventilated air in the winter by transferring heat from the warm inside air being exhausted to the fresh (but cold) supply air. In the summer, the inside air cools the warmer incoming supply air to reduce ventilation cooling costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/insulation_airsealing/index.cfm/mytopic=11900 EERE Consumer's Guide: Energy Recovery Ventilation Systems&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This low-energy fan-and-motor ventilation system can be cost-effectively powered by [[photovoltaics]], with enhanced natural [[convection]] exhaust up a [[solar chimney]] - the downward incoming air flow would be forced convection ([[advection]]).

A desiccant like [[calcium chloride]] can be mixed with water to create an attractive recirculating waterfall, that dehumidifies a room using solar thermal energy to regenerate the liquid, and a PV-powered low-rate water pump.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://2007.solarteam.org/page.php?id=641 Liquid Desiccant Waterfall for attractive building dehumidification]&lt;/ref&gt;

Active solar cooling wherein solar thermal collectors provide input energy for a desiccant cooling system. There are several commercially available systems that blow air through a desiccant impregnated medium for both the dehumidification and the regeneration cycle. The solar heat is one way that the regeneration cycle is powered. In theory packed towers can be used to form a counter-current flow of the air and the liquid desiccant but are not normally employed in commercially available machines. Preheating of the air is shown to greatly enhance desiccant regeneration. The packed column yields good results as a dehumidifier/regenerator, provided pressure drop can be reduced with the use of suitable packing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980SoEn...24..541F A packed bed dehumidifier/regenerator for solar air conditioning with liquid desiccants] (by Factor, H. M. and Grossman, G., [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]])&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive solar cooling==
{{Main|Passive cooling|Passive solar}}

In this type of cooling solar thermal energy is not used directly to create a cold environment or drive any direct cooling processes. Instead, [[solar building design]] aims at slowing the rate of [[heat transfer]] into a building in the summer, and improving the removal of unwanted heat. It involves a good understanding of the mechanisms of [[heat transfer]]: [[heat conduction]], [[convective heat transfer]], and [[thermal radiation]], the latter primarily from the sun.

For example, a sign of poor thermal design is an attic that gets hotter in summer than the peak outside air temperature. This can be significantly reduced or eliminated with a [[cool roof]] or a [[green roof]], which can reduce the roof surface temperature by 70&amp;nbsp;°F (40&amp;nbsp;°C) in summer. A [[radiant barrier]] and an air gap below the roof will block about 97% of downward radiation from roof cladding heated by the sun.

Passive solar cooling is much easier to achieve in new construction than by adapting existing buildings. There are many design specifics involved in passive solar cooling. It is a primary element of designing a [[zero energy building]] in a hot climate.

==Solar closed-loop absorption cooling==
{{Main|Absorption heat pump}}

The following are common technologies in use for solar thermal closed-loop air conditioning.
* Absorption: {{chem|NH|3}}/{{chem|H|2|O}} or Ammonia/Water
* Absorption: Water/Lithium Bromide
* Absorption: Water/Lithium Chloride
* Adsorption: Water/Silica Gel or Water/Zeolite
* Adsorption: Methanol/Activated Carbon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.machine-history.com/Solar%20Powered%20Air%20Conditioning#Adsorption%20Chiller:%20Water/Silica%20Gel|title=Solar Powered Air Conditioning|author=|date=|website=machine-history.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active solar cooling uses solar thermal collectors to provide solar energy to thermally driven chillers (usually adsorption or absorption chillers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Active solar systems |author= George O. G. Löf |publisher= MIT Press |date= 1993 |isbn= 978-0-262-12167-5 |page= 682 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E4uOagBuHD0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA682&amp;dq=solar-cooling+adsorption-or-absorption&amp;ei=_QcvSsD4ApzazQSS-Y2jBw }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solar energy heats a fluid that provides heat to the generator of an absorption chiller and is recirculated back to the collectors. The heat provided to the generator drives a cooling cycle that produces chilled water. The chilled water produced is used for large commercial and industrial cooling.

[[Solar thermal energy]] can be used to efficiently cool in the summer, and also heat domestic hot water and buildings in the winter. Single, double or triple iterative absorption cooling cycles are used in different solar-thermal-cooling system designs. The more cycles, the more efficient they are. Absorption chillers operate with less noise and vibration than compressor-based chillers, but their capital costs are relatively high.&lt;ref&gt;Otanicar, T., Taylor, R.A., Phelan, P., ''[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0038092X12000369 Prospects for solar cooling – An economic and environmental assessment]'',Solar Energy Volume 86, Issue 5, May 2012, Pages 1287–1299&lt;/ref&gt;

Efficient absorption chillers nominally require water of at least {{convert|190|°F|°C|abbr=on}}. Common, inexpensive flat-plate [[solar thermal collector]]s only produce about {{convert|160|°F|°C|abbr=on}} water. High temperature flat plate, concentrating (CSP) or evacuated tube collectors are needed to produce the higher temperature transfer fluids required. In large scale installations there are several projects successful both technical and economical in operation worldwide including, for example, at the headquarters of [[Caixa Geral de Depósitos]] in Lisbon with {{convert|1579|m2}} solar collectors and 545&amp;nbsp;kW cooling power or on the Olympic Sailing Village in Qingdao/China. In 2011 the most powerful plant at Singapore's new constructed [[United World College]] will be commissioned (1500&amp;nbsp;kW).

These projects have shown that flat plate solar collectors specially developed for temperatures over {{convert|200|°F}} (featuring double glazing, increased backside insulation, etc.) can be effective and cost efficient.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solid.at/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=73 "Solar Cooling".] www.solid.at. Accessed on 1 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Where water can be heated well above {{convert|190|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, it can be stored and used when the sun is not shining.

The Audubon Environmental Center at the [[Ernest E. Debs Regional Park]] in Los Angeles has an example solar air conditioning installation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Les Hamasaki | title = 10 Ton Solar Air Conditioning at the Debs Park Audubon Environmental Center in Los Angeles (6 minute video) | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtMC2MXc_n8 | accessdate = 2007-12-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Wright, [https://web.archive.org/web/20040223091854/http://www.energypulse.net/centers/article/article_print.cfm?a_id=610 "Solar-Thermal HVAC Technology Debuts in Los Angeles at new Audubon Urban Nature Center "], EnergyPulse, 2.3.04, Accessed 2 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; which failed fairly soon after commissioning and is no longer being maintained.{{Citation needed|reason=Need a citation about the failure of the system or this should be removed if it can't be substantiated.|date=March 2014}} The [[Southern California Gas]] Co.

== Solar cooling systems utilizing concentrating collectors ==
The main reasons for employing concentrating collectors in solar cooling systems are: high efficient air-conditioning through coupling with double/triple effect chillers; and solar refrigeration serving industrial end-users, possibly in combination with process heat and steam. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012-01-01|title=Solar Cooling Systems Utilizing Concentrating Solar Collectors - An Overview|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610212016153|journal=Energy Procedia|language=en|volume=30|pages=875–883|doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2012.11.099|issn=1876-6102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning industrial applications, several studies in the recent years highlighted that there is a high potential for refrigeration (temperatures below 0°C) in different areas of the globe (e.g., the Mediterranean, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.solarthermalworld.org/sites/gstec/files/solarmilk.pdf|title=Solar energy cools milk|last=Ayadi|first=Osama|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pilatowsky|first=ISAAC|last2=Scoccia|first2=Rossano|title=Solar cooling in the food industry in Mexico: A case study|url=https://www.academia.edu/26741063/Solar_cooling_in_the_food_industry_in_Mexico_A_case_study|journal=Applied Thermal Engineering|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;). However, this can be achieved by ammonia/ water absorption chillers requiring high temperature heat input at the generator, in a range (120 ÷ 180 °C) which can only be satisfied by concentrating solar collectors. Moreover, several industrial applications require both cooling and steam for processes, and concentrating solar collectors can be very advantageous in the sense that their use is maximized

==Zero-energy buildings==

Goals of [[zero-energy building]]s include [[sustainable]], [[green building]] technologies that can significantly reduce, or eliminate, net annual energy bills. The supreme achievement is the totally [[off-the-grid]] [[autonomous building]] that does not have to be connected to utility companies. In hot climates with significant [[degree day]]s of cooling requirement, leading-edge solar air conditioning will be an increasingly important [[critical success factor]].

Substitute checks are recognized as legal checks as long as the instruments meet specific requirements. These requirements include the faithful reproduction of the paper check and warranty of the instrument by the "reconverting bank"—the financial institution that created the substitute check or the first financial institution that transferred or presented it during the [[cheque clearing |check clearing]] process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/truncation About Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act]. (March 1, 2006). U.S.&amp;nbsp;Federal Reserve Board. Retrieved January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Substitute checks are also subject to the UCC, existing federal and state check laws, and regulations specific to consumer rights that affect the acceptance of these instruments.&lt;ref name="frb"/&gt; Although a substitute check is subject to the UCC and existing state and federal check laws, the Check&amp;nbsp;21 Act takes precedence over these other laws and regulations for this instrument.&lt;ref name=C21Law/&gt;

==Specifications and standards==
The Accredited Standards Committee&amp;nbsp;X9 ([[ASC X9|ASC&amp;nbsp;X9]]), a standards development committee accredited by the [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI), maintains, promotes, and supports technical financial standards for procedures, delivery, and transactions for financial products and services that include Image Replacement Documents, and other financial instruments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts about Accredited Standards Committee X9 – Financial Industry Global Standards|url=http://x9.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/X9_Fact_Sheet_2014-8-20.pdf|publisher=The Accredited Standards Committee&amp;nbsp;X9, Inc.|accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; American National Standard (ANS)&amp;nbsp;X9.100-140 covers specifications for the content, processing, and quality of Image Replacement Documents specifically.&lt;ref name="ANStds"&gt;{{cite web|title=Substitute checks: Development of processing and quality standards|url=http://www.eccho.org/uploads/CTA%20Standards%20Revision%20V2.pdf|publisher=ECCHO® (Electronic Check Clearing House Organization)|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Certain standards that exist for paper checks also apply to Image Replacement Documents.

==Eligible payment items for truncation and reconversion==
Under the [[Check&amp;nbsp;21 Act]], all U.S. paper checks and check-like instruments are eligible for truncation and reconversion to substitute checks, including consumer (personal) checks, commercial (business) checks, [[money order]]s, [[traveler's check]]s, cash advance or convenience checks tied to credit and charge card accounts, controlled disbursement checks, and payable through drafts, in addition to [[Warrant of payment|government warrant]]s and [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] checks.&lt;ref name="doj"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions: Consumer Compliance FAQ for Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (Check 21) and the Implementing Regulation (12 CFR 229)|url=https://www.ffiec.gov/exam/check21/faq.htm|website=Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council|accessdate=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Check 21 Resource Document|url=https://www.crfonline.org/orc/pdf/Check21NACHA.pdf|publisher=NACHA|accessdate=17 April 2015|date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Check&amp;nbsp;21 Act permits any financial institution (such as a [[bank|commercial bank]] or [[credit union]]) that participates in the check collection process to remove or [[Truncation (banking)#Truncation|truncate]] the original paper check from the forward collection or return process and reconvert the paper check to a substitute check without first requiring an existing agreement between the bank of first deposit ([[Wikt:BOFD|BOFD]]) and the "paying bank."&lt;ref name="frb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="doj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/ust/eo/private_trustee/library/chapter07/docs/check21/Check21FAQs-final.pdf|title=The Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act ("Check 21"): Frequently Asked Questions|date=October 28, 2004|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The elimination of the paper checks from the clearing process saves the banking and treasury management industries handling, sorting, transporting, storing, safeguarding, and mailing costs. After the financial institution truncates the original paper check and reconverts it to a substitute check, the financial institution can store or archive the paper check, return the paper check to its own customer according to state law, or later destroy the paper check.

==Legal requirements==
A properly prepared substitute check is considered the ''legal equivalent'' of the original paper check that can be accepted for payment or proof of payment in the same manner as the original check. Every substitute check must adhere to the following requirements before it can be recognized as the legal equivalent of the original check:

# The substitute check must accurately represent all information depicted on the front and back of the original paper check at the time the financial institution truncates that check, including the names of the payor and payee, courtesy and legal amounts, endorsements, and encoding information, among other details. 
# The substitute check must accurately represent the MICR line of the original check.
# The substitute check must bear the legend "This is a LEGAL COPY of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check."
# The financial institution or processor must provide a warranty for the substitute check. This warranty must be provided by the financial institution when it removes or truncates the original paper check from the forward collection or return process and reconverts the paper check to a substitute check.
# The financial institution or processor that truncated the original check must follow ASC&amp;nbsp;X9.100-140 standards in the capture of check images and MICR data when it produces the substitute check.&lt;ref name="ffiec"/&gt;

Image statements that include a series of pictures or images of original paper checks and/or substitute checks, photocopies of the original checks, and images of checks posted online are not recognized as the legal equivalents of substitute checks.&lt;ref name="occ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.occ.gov/Consumer/check21.htm|title=Check&amp;nbsp;21: Q's&amp;nbsp;and A's|publisher=U.S.&amp;nbsp;Comptroller of the Currency|accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike a substitute check, a photocopy of a check cannot be presented through the check clearing process for settlement because the photocopy of the check does not adhere strictly to the requirements for substitute checks under the Check&amp;nbsp;21 Act.&lt;ref name="frb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/check21/consumer_guide.htm#whatis|title=Consumer Guide to Check&amp;nbsp;21 and Substitute Checks|date=February 16, 2004|publisher=U.S. Federal Reserve Board|accessdate=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since substitute checks are considered legal checks, substitute checks are subject to existing check laws and regulations. Other laws and regulations that govern substitute checks in the United States include the [[Expedited Funds Availability Act]], Article&amp;nbsp;3 (Negotiable Instruments),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/3-104.html Negotiable instrument.] 3&amp;nbsp;U.C.C. §&amp;nbsp;104 (2009). Retrieved October 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and Article&amp;nbsp;4 ([[deposit account|Bank Deposit]]s and Collections)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/ucc/4/4-110.html Electronic presentment.] 4&amp;nbsp;U.C.C. §&amp;nbsp;110 (2009). Retrieved October 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), along with a variety of state and federal regulatory laws. U.S. federal laws that also affect substitute checks include Federal Reserve regulations that provide for recrediting the amount of the substitute check in the case of fraud and duplicate payments caused by settlement of both the substitute check and the original check used for creating the substitute check.&lt;ref name="ffiec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="frb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="doj"/&gt; If any state law, federal law, or provision of the UCC conflicts with the Check&amp;nbsp;21&amp;nbsp;Act, the Check&amp;nbsp;21&amp;nbsp;Act takes precedence to the extent of the inconsistencies among those laws and provisions.&lt;ref name=C21Law&gt;[http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2009/janqtr/12cfr229.59.htm Substitute checks.] 12&amp;nbsp;C.F.R. §&amp;nbsp;229.59 (2009). Retrieved October 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clearing process==
{{further | Clearing (finance)}}
===Forward collection process===
Each substitute check processed for forward collection is encoded with a "4" as the External Processing Code (EPC) in position&amp;nbsp;44 of the MICR line as required under ANS&amp;nbsp;X9.90.&lt;ref name="eccho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eccho.org/check21_resource.php|title=Check&amp;nbsp;21 Resource Document|year=2009|publisher=Electronic Check Clearing House Organization|accessdate=May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the forward collection process for substitute checks involves the following steps for financial institutions that process deposits through the Federal Reserve System:&lt;ref name="ffiec"/&gt;

# The payee endorses the original paper check and presents it to the depository financial institution.
# The depository financial institution (Bank&amp;nbsp;1 &amp;ndash; referred to as the bank of first deposit or BOFD) stamps its endorsement on the rear of the original check.
# Bank&amp;nbsp;1 captures an image of the front and back of the original check and the MICR line data from the front of the check. Bank&amp;nbsp;1 then removes or [[Cheque truncation|truncates]] the original check from the clearing process and uses the check image, MICR data, its own electronic endorsement, and the electronic endorsements to create a substitute check.
# Bank&amp;nbsp;1 electronically transmits the check image and the MICR line data captured from the original check to the paying bank (Bank&amp;nbsp;2) for settlement. If no agreement exists between Bank&amp;nbsp;1 and Bank&amp;nbsp;2 to exchange check images and data, Bank&amp;nbsp;1 must provide either the original check or the legal equivalent of the substitute check to Bank&amp;nbsp;2.
# As the paying bank, Bank&amp;nbsp;2 uses check image and MICR data or information from the substitute check received from Bank&amp;nbsp;1 to process the item during the normal course of settlement. 
# After the settlement process, Bank&amp;nbsp;2 provides a copy of the substitute check to the customer who wrote the original check or includes information about the substitute check in that customer's monthly or periodic statement.

Any financial institution that participates in the forward collection (or return) process can become the reconverting financial institution if it creates the substitute check for transmittal and settlement.

===Return process for dishonored checks===
If a substitute check must be returned unpaid because of insufficient funds (a dishonored or bounced check), the paying bank (Bank&amp;nbsp;2) stamps the item NSF {{nowrap begin}}(non-sufficient funds){{nowrap end}} as the reason for the return. In this case, Bank&amp;nbsp;2 encodes a "5" as the EPC on the MICR line to identify the substitute check according to ANS&amp;nbsp;X9.90,&lt;ref name="eccho"/&gt; along with the routing number of the depository financial institution and the dollar amount of the substitute check. Bank&amp;nbsp;2 encodes this information on a return strip, perforated strip, or carrier document that the financial institution attaches to the unpaid substitute check.&lt;ref name="eccho"/&gt; The paying bank then returns the unpaid substitute check through the routing process to the BOFD (Bank&amp;nbsp;1) for further handling. Once Bank&amp;nbsp;1 receives the returned substitute check, the financial institution issues a charge back notice to its customer who deposited or offered the check for settlement.&lt;ref name="ffiec"/&gt;

Taxes in [[Cyprus]] are levied by both the central and local governments. Tax revenue stood at 39.2% of GDP in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/index/Ranking.aspx Index of Economic Freedom], '''[[Heritage Foundation]].''' Note: Tax revenue as a percentage of GDP was obtained from the individual country pages, under the "Fiscal Freedom" section. These numbers change. Please update the numbers for individual countries in the list.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important revenue sources are the [[income tax]], [[social security]], [[value-added tax]] and [[corporate tax]], and are all collected by the central government.

Income tax is levied on a progressive rate. Current brackets vary from 0% to 35% in the tax rates for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pwc.com.cy/en/publications/assets/tax-facts-figures-jan-2014-en.pdf|title = Tax Facts &amp; Figures 2014 - Cyprus|date = |accessdate = |website = PWC|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, various tax allowances apply for trade union fees, donation to charities. The tax brackets for the year 2014 are:
{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Annual income
! Tax rate
|-
| In between €0 and €19500
| 0%
|-
| In between €19500  and €28000

| 25%
|-
| In between €36300 and €60000
| 30%
|-
| In excess of €60000
| 35%
|}

Employment income is also subject to various social security contributions. Contributions are subject to a ceiling, for the year 2014 the maximum amount of insurable earnings has been set to €54396 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxation-international-executives/cyprus/pages/other-taxes-levies.aspx|title = Cyprus - Other taxes and levies|date = |accessdate = |website = kpmg.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Employees pay 7.8% of their wage and employers contribute 11.5% of the corresponding wage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxation-international-executives/cyprus/pages/other-taxes-levies.aspx|title = Cyprus - Other taxes and levies|date = |accessdate = |website = kpmg.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Value added tax applies to most sales of goods and services. The standard rate applies at 19% in 2014, up from 17% since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.kpmg.com/global/en/issuesandinsights/articlespublications/taxnewsflash/pages/2014-1/cyprus-vat-rates-in-2014.aspx|title = Cyprus - VAT rates 2014|date = |accessdate = |website = KPMG.com|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A lower rate of 9% applies to groceries, books and hotel services. The Cyprus VAT is part of the European Union value added tax system. Certain goods and services are exempt from VAT. This includes exports, financial services, rent, etc.

Corporate taxes are levied at a rate of 12.5%. Various deductions apply including interest, cost of buying other companies, and employer's cost to social security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pwc.com.cy/en/publications/assets/tax-facts-figures-jan-2014-en.pdf|title = Tax Facts &amp; Figures 2014 - Cyprus|date = |accessdate = |website = PWC|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12363">'''''United States v. Seale''''' is a federal criminal case in the United States, in which [[Ku Klux Klan]] member [[James Ford Seale]] was prosecuted and convicted for his role in the racially motivated murders in 1964 of two black teens.

The case was procedurally unusual in that it was initiated in 2007, and it was unclear whether the [[statute of limitations]] had expired due to revision of the governing criminal statute in the interim.  The trial court ruled against Seale on the issue, which was affirmed by an evenly divided appellate court.  The appellate court then took the highly unusual step of seeking [[Certified_question|certification]] of the legal question to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], seeking guidance on whether the revisions [[Ex post facto law|retroactively]] changed the applicable limitations period.  The Supreme Court dismissed the certification without comment.

==Background==
The case has its beginnings in the 1964 kidnapping of two black teenagers. After they had been beaten, they had weights attached and were thrown into the [[Mississippi River]] to drown.&lt;ref name="APreport"&gt;{{cite news

==The case and the timeliness issue==
The federal kidnapping statute doesn't specify a time limit on prosecutions, so the general limits of 18 U.S.C. §§ [http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3281.html 3281] and
[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3282.html 3282] supply the time limit on prosecution, if there is any. There is no time limit on a capital crime (section 3281), but non-capital crimes are subject to a five-year statute of limitations (section 3282). Seale moved to dismiss the indictment on the theory that the latter applied to him. Although kidnapping was a capital offense in 1964, Congress detached the death penalty from it in the mid-1970s in response to ''[[United States v. Jackson]]'', [https://www.oyez.org/cases/1960-1969/1967/1967_85 390 U.S. 570] (1968), and ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'', [https://www.oyez.org/cases/1970-1979/1971/1971_69_5003 408 U.S. 238] (1972). This should be given retroactive effect, Seale contended, making his offense subject to section 3282's five year limit, and the indictment accordingly untimely. The [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi|district court]] rejected this argument. The case proceeded to trial, the jury found Seale guilty on all counts (helped, no doubt, by an [[FBI]] agent's testimony that Seale had admitted the crime after his arrest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On appeal, Seale raised seven issues, but a panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] decided only one of them. It embraced Seale's argument that the prosecution was time-barred; because that decision terminated the case, the panel did not address the remaining issues. The full Fifth Circuit agreed to hear the case [[en banc]], vacating the panel's decision. Although the en banc court decided to hear the case, however, it could not decide ''how'' to decide the case, dividing nine to nine. The upshot was that the panel opinion was vacated, and the district court's denial of Seale's motion was nominally affirmed without opinion. The case was remanded to the panel for consideration of the remaining six issues raised on appeal. 

Rather than await the panel's decision or [[certiorari|appeal]],&lt;ref name="coyle"&gt;{{cite news

Judge [[Harold DeMoss]], writing for the majority,&lt;ref&gt;The panel's certification opinion was designated as being a [[per curiam]], but Chief Judge Jones' dissent identifies Judge DeMoss as the author.&lt;/ref&gt; premised certification both on the unusual posture of the particular case and its implications for the broader considerations at issue, noting that the government is investigating several other cases from the 1960s that may raise the same question of time limits.&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite news

It is in the discretion of the Supreme Court to answer certified questions or not. The court has indicated that such actions are disfavored, and it has rarely taken such cases, but such cases have been taken before.&lt;ref name="coyle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justice Stevens, in his separate opinion, noted that the Supreme Court had not accepted a certified question since 1981.

==Supreme Court dismissal==
The Supreme Court dismissed the certified question on November 2, 2009. In a statement respecting the dismissal joined by Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote:

{{quote|This certificate presents us with a pure question of law that may well determine the outcome of a number of cases of ugly racial violence remaining from the 1960s ... [and which is] narrow, debatable, and important. I recognize that the question reaches us in an interlocutory posture, ... [y]et I see no benefit and significant cost to postponing the question’s resolution. A prompt answer from this Court will expedite the termination of this litigation and determine whether other similar cases may be prosecuted. In these unusual circumstances, certification can serve the interests not only of legal clarity but also of prosecutorial economy and the proper administration and expedition of judicial business.&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Seale, No. 09–166 (statement regarding dismissal of the certified question by Stevens, J.) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The case will now return to the District Court for consideration of the residuum of issues, per the Fifth Circuit's original ''en banc'' decision.

In the field of [[information security]], '''user activity monitoring''' (UAM) is the monitoring and recording of user actions. UAM captures user actions, including the use of applications, windows opened, system commands executed, check boxes clicked, text entered/edited, URLs visited and nearly every other on-screen event to protect data by ensuring that employees and contractors are staying within their assigned tasks, and posing no risk to the organization.

UAM software can deliver video-like playback of user activity and process the videos into user activity logs that keep step-by-step records of user actions that can be searched and analyzed to investigate any out-of-scope activities.

==Issues==

The need for UAM rose due to the increase in security incidents that directly or indirectly involve user credentials, exposing company information or sensitive files. In 2014, there were 761 [[data breach]]es in the United States, resulting in over 83 million exposed customer and employee records.&lt;ref name="Verizon DBIR 2014"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idtheftcenter.org/images/breach/DataBreachReports_2014.pdf|title=Data Breach Reports|work=Identity Theft Resource Center|date=31 December 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 76% of these breaches resulting from weak or exploited user credentials, UAM has become a significant component of [[IT infrastructure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verizonenterprise.com/DBIR/2014/|title= 2014 Data Breach Investigation Report|work=Verizon|date=14 April 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main populations of users that UAM aims to mitigate risks with are:

===Contractors===
Contractors are used in organizations to complete [[information technology]] operational tasks.  Remote vendors that have access to company data are risks.  Even with no malicious intent, an external user like a contractor is a major security liability.

=== Users===
70% of regular business users admitted to having access to more data than necessary.  Generalized accounts give regular business users access to classified company data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/EMA-announces-key-findings-from-virtualisation-report|title=Virtualisation: Exposing the Intangible Enterprise|work=Enterprise Management Associates|date=14 August 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes [[insider threat]]s a reality for any business that uses generalized accounts.

===IT users===
Administrator accounts are heavily monitored due to the high profile nature of their access.  However, current log tools can generate “log fatigue” on these admin accounts.  Log fatigue is the overwhelming sensation of trying to handle a vast amount of logs on an account as a result of too many user actions.  Harmful user actions can easily be overlooked with thousands of user actions being compiled every day.

===Overall risk===
According to the Verizon Data Breach Incident Report, “The first step in protecting your data is in knowing where it is and who has access to it.”&lt;ref name="Verizon DBIR 2014" /&gt; In today’s IT environment, “there is a lack of oversight and control over how and who among employees has access to confidential, sensitive information.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.varonis.com/hs-fs/hub/142972/file-2194864500-pdf/ponemon-data-breach-study.pdf?&amp;__hssc=&amp;__hstc&amp;hsCtaTracking=c771f50d-6a90-42c2-97d0-868ac3bcfc5b%7Cd2b8c2bf-07bc-4329-b1f9-c6ff2cd88980|title=Corporate Data: A Protected Asset or a Ticking Time Bomb?|work=Ponemon Institute|date=December 2014|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This apparent gap is one of many factors that have resulted in a major number of security issues for companies.

== Components ==
Most companies that use UAM usually separate the necessary aspects of UAM into three major components.

===Visual forensics===
Visual Forensics involves creating a visual summary of potentially hazardous user activity.  Each user action is logged, and recorded.  Once a user session is completed, UAM has created both a written record and a visual record, whether it be screen-captures or video of exactly what a user has done.  This written record differs from that of a SIEM or logging tool, because it captures data at a user-level not at a system level –providing plain English logs rather than SysLogs (originally created for debugging purposes).  These textual logs are paired with the corresponding screen-captures or video summaries.  Using these corresponding logs and images, the visual forensics component of UAM allows for organizations to search for exact user actions in case of a security incident.
In the case of a security threat, i.e. a data breach, Visual Forensics are used to show exactly what a user did, and everything leading up to the incident.  Visual Forensics can also be used to provide evidence to any [[law enforcement]] that investigate the intrusion.

===User activity alerting===
User activity alerting serves the purpose of notifying whoever operates the UAM solution to a mishap or misstep concerning company information.  Real-time alerting enables the console administrator to be notified the moment an error or intrusion occurs.  Alerts are aggregated for each user to provide a user risk profile and threat ranking.  Alerting is customizable based on combinations of users, actions, time, location, and access method. Alerts can be triggered simply such as opening an application, or entering a certain keyword or web address.  Alerts can also be customized based on user actions within an application, such as deleting or creating a user and executing specific commands.

===User behavior analytics===
User behavior analytics add an additional layer of protection that will help security professionals keep an eye on the weakest link in the chain. By monitoring user behavior, with the help of dedicated software that analyzes exactly what the user does during their session, security professionals can attach a risk factor to the specific users and/or groups, and immediately be alerted with a red flag warning when a high-risk user does something that can be interpreted as a high-risk action such as exporting confidential customer information, performing large [[database]] queries that are out of the scope of their role, accessing resources that they shouldn’t be accessing and so forth.

== Features ==

===Capturing activity===
UAM collects user data by recording activity by every user on applications, web pages and internal systems and databases.  UAM spans all access levels and access strategies (RDP, SSH, Telnet, ICA, direct console login, etc.…).  Some UAM solutions pair with [[Citrix]] and VMware environments.

===User activity logs===
UAM solutions transcribe all documented activities into user activity logs.  UAM logs match up with video-playbacks of concurrent actions.  Some examples of items logged are names of applications run, titles of pages opened, URLs, text (typed, edited, copied/pasted), commands, and scripts.

===Video-like playback===
UAM uses screen-recording technology that captures individual user actions. Each video-like playback is saved and accompanied by a user activity log.  Playbacks differ from traditional video playback to screen scraping, which is the compiling of sequential screen shots into a video like replay.  The user activity logs combined with the video-like playback provides a searchable summary of all user actions.  This enables companies to not only read, but also view exactly what a particular user did on company systems.

== Privacy ==

Some companies and employees raised issue with the user privacy aspect of UAM.{{Which|date=March 2017}} They believe employees will resist the idea of having their actions monitored, even if it is being done for security purposes. In reality, most UAM strategies address these concerns.

While it is possible to monitor every single user action, the purpose of UAM systems is not to snoop on employee browsing history.  UAM solutions use policy-based activity recording, which enables the console administrator to program exactly what is and isn’t monitored.

==Audit and compliance==

Many regulations require a certain level of UAM while others only require logs of activity for audit purposes. UAM meets a variety of [[regulatory compliance]] requirements (HIPAA, ISO 27001, SOX, PCI etc.…).  UAM is typically implemented for the purpose of audits and compliance, to serve as a way for companies to make their audits easier and more efficient.  An audit information request for information on user activity can be met with UAM.  Unlike normal log or SIEM tools, UAM can help speed up an audit process by building the controls necessary to navigate an increasingly complex regulatory environment.  The ability to replay user actions provides support for determining the impact on regulated information during security incident response.

==Appliance vs. software==

UAM has two deployment models. Appliance-based monitoring approaches that use dedicated hardware to conduct monitoring by looking at network traffic. Software-based monitoring approaches that use software agents installed on the nodes accessed by users.

More commonly, software requires the installation of an agent on systems (servers, desktops, VDI servers, terminal servers) across which users you want to monitor. These agents capture user activity and reports information back to a central console for storage and analysis. These solutions may be quickly deployed in a phased manner by targeting high-risk users and systems with sensitive information first, allowing the organization to get up and running quickly and expand to new user populations as the business requires.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1172">In '''''Van Wetten v Bosch''''', an important case in the South African law of succession, Van Wetten was the sister of [[Tertius Bosch]], a cricketer who had died of Guillain–Barré syndrome. Van Wetten approached the court to declare a document written by the deceased to be his valid will. The deceased had a previous joint will with his wife in which they had nominated each other as the sole heirs of their respective estates. After the joint will was concluded, and before the birth of their second child, Bosch wrote a series of notes regarding his wife’s infidelity; one of these handwritten notes stated that his oldest son was his sole heir. The court held that it was clear in the note, and in light of the surrounding circumstances, that Bosch had intended to disinherit his wife, so the court declared the note to be a valid will.

'''''Wén''''' 文 and '''''wǔ''''' 武 - a conceptual pair in [[Chinese philosophy]] and political culture describing opposition and complementarity of civil ① and military ② realms of government. Differentiation between ''wen'' and ''wu'' was engaged in discussions on criminal punishment, administrative control, creation and reproduction of social order, education and moral transformation.&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was formed during the [[Spring and Autumn period|Chunqiu]] and [[Warring States]] periods, and best articulated in the 3rd or 2nd century BCE. However, until recently it was not much discussed by the Western scholars because of ① their aberrated perception of the importance of [[Confucianism]] in the pre-imperial and early imperial era, and ② their understanding of Confucianism as pacifist in its nature.&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of the last is provided by [[John K. Fairbank]]: “Warfare was disesteemed in Confucianism... The resort to warfare (''wu'') was an admission of bankruptcy in the pursuit of ''wen'' [civility or culture]. Consequently, it should be a last resort... Herein lies the pacifist bias of the Chinese tradition... Expansion through ''wen''... was natural and proper; whereas expansion by ''wu'', brute force and conquest, was never to be condoned.”&lt;ref&gt;Yuan-kang Wang, ''Harmony and war: Confucian culture and Chinese power politics''. Columbia University Press, 2011:14. Quote from John K. Fairbank, “Varieties of the Chinese Military Experience,” in Chinese Ways in Warfare, ed. Frank A. Kierman Jr. and John K. Fairbank (Cambridge,
Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1974), 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the terms ==
The [[posthumous name]]s of the Zhou dynasty (1046-256 BCE) founders, [[King Wen of Zhou|King Wen]] and [[King Wu of Zhou|King Wu]], represent the two terms as standing in the "father-and-son" relationship. Since the [[Battle of Muye|conquest of Shang]] and creation of the Zhou imperial order were the most discussed events of the classical era, the two impersonated terms had very broad currency. However, their origin is presently impossible to pinpoint.&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Garden of Stories|Shuoyuan]]'', compiled by [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] (77-6 BCE, Han dynasty), gives a classical example of the terms' balancing against each other: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[King Cheng of Zhou|King Cheng]] enfeoffed [[Bo Qin]] [the Duke of Zhou's son] as the Duke of Lu. Summoning him, he addressed him, saying: "Do you know the Way of acting as the ruler over the people? ... Should you possess the civil but lack the martial, you will have no means to awe those below. Should you possess the martial but lack the civil, the people will fear you but not draw close. If the civil and martial are implemented together, then your awe-inspiring [[De (Chinese)|virtue]] will be achieved."&lt;ref&gt;McNeal, 15, translating from "Jundao" chapter of the ''Shuoyuan''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
