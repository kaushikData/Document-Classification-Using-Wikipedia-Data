'''{{mp|2017 AG|13}}''' is an [[Aten asteroid]] that made a close approach of 0.54 [[Lunar distance (astronomy)|lunar distances]] from Earth on January 9, 2017.&lt;ref name="watchers"&gt;{{cite web|title=Newly discovered asteroid 2017 AG13 to flyby Earth at 0.53 LD|url=https://watchers.news/2017/01/08/near-earth-asteroid-2017-ag13-flyby-january-9-2017/|website=The Watchers - Daily news service|accessdate=2 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the largest asteroid to pass less than 1 lunar distance from Earth since {{mp|2016 QA|2}} on August 28, 2016. The [[Catalina Sky Survey]] discovered it on January 7, 2017, only two days before its closest approach. At its brightest, {{mp|2017 AG|13}} reached apparent magnitude 14.8.&lt;ref name="JPLorbit"/&gt; Shortly after, it moved too close to the Sun to be seen by telescopes.

The asteroid frequently makes close approaches to Earth, possibly passing as close as {{convert|127000|km|mi}} to Earth on January 9, 2069, however it will most likely pass much further away.

{{mp|2017 AG|13}} is most likely {{convert|13|–|41|m|ft|abbr=off}} across, assuming a typical asteroid [[albedo]] of between 0.05 and 0.3.

An '''abrasive''' is a material, often a [[mineral]], that is used to shape or finish a workpiece through rubbing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHZyoKCxwKAC&amp;pg=PA600&amp;dq=An+abrasive+is+a+material,+often+a+mineral,+that+is+used+to+shape+or+finish+a+workpiece&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZ1aPk4NfUAhUIKWMKHcHTDBo4ChDoAQguMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20abrasive%20is%20a%20material,%20often%20a%20mineral,%20that%20is%20used%20to%20shape%20or%20finish%20a%20workpiece&amp;f=false|title=ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY|last=PALANNA|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259081521|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; which leads to part of the workpiece being worn away by [[friction]]. While finishing a material often means [[polishing]] it to gain a smooth, reflective surface, the process can also involve roughening as in satin, matte or beaded finishes. In short, the ceramics which are used to cut, grind and polish other softer materials are known as abrasives.

Abrasives are extremely commonplace and are used very extensively in a wide variety of industrial, domestic, and technological applications. This gives rise to a large variation in the physical and chemical composition of abrasives as well as the shape of the abrasive. Some common uses for abrasives include [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], polishing, [[buffing]], [[honing (metalworking)|honing]], [[cutting]], [[drilling]], [[sharpening]], [[lapping]], and [[sanding]] (see [[abrasive machining]]). (For simplicity, "mineral" in this article will be used loosely to refer to both minerals and mineral-like substances whether man-made or not.)

[[File (tool)|Files]] are not abrasives; they remove material not by scratching or rubbing, but by the cutting action of sharp teeth which have been cut into the surface of the file, very much like those of a saw. However, diamond files are a form of coated abrasive (as they are metal rods coated with diamond powder).

== Mechanics of abrasion ==
{{Main|Abrasion (mechanical)}}
Abrasives generally rely upon a difference in hardness between the abrasive and the material being worked upon, the abrasive being the harder of the two substances. However,  is not necessary as any two solid materials that repeatedly rub against each other will tend to wear each other away; examples include, softer shoe soles wearing away wooden or stone steps over decades or centuries or [[glacier]]s abrading stone valleys.

Typically, materials used as abrasives are either hard [[minerals]] (rated at 7 or above on [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]) or are synthetic stones, some of which may be chemically and physically identical to naturally occurring minerals but which cannot be called minerals as they did not arise naturally.  (While useful for comparative purposes, the Mohs scale is of limited value to materials engineers as it is an arbitrary, ordinal, irregular scale.)  [[Diamond]], a common abrasive, for instance occurs both naturally and is industrially produced, as is [[corundum]] which occurs naturally but which is  nowadays more commonly manufactured from [[bauxite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abrasiveengineering.com/glossary.htm|title=Abrasives engineering glossary|accessdate=2007-04-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070402181503/http://www.abrasiveengineering.com/glossary.htm| archivedate= 2 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even softer minerals like [[calcium carbonate]] are used as abrasives, such as "polishing agents" in toothpaste.

[[File:Differences in the size of sand.jpg|thumb|right|Grit size ranging from 2&amp;nbsp;mm (the large grain) (about F 10 using FEPA standards) to about 40 micrometres (about F 240 or P 360).]]

These minerals are either crushed or are already of a sufficiently small size (anywhere from macroscopic grains as large as about 2&amp;nbsp;mm to microscopic grains about 0.001&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) to permit their use as an abrasive. These grains, commonly called grit, have rough edges, often terminating in points which will decrease the surface area in contact and increase the localised contact [[pressure]]. The abrasive and the material to be worked are brought into contact while in relative motion to each other. Force applied through the grains causes fragments of the worked material to break away, while simultaneously smoothing the abrasive grain and/or causing the grain to work loose from the rest of the abrasive.

Some factors which will affect how quickly a substance is abraded include:
*Difference in hardness between the two substances: a much harder abrasive will cut faster and deeper
*Grain size (grit size): larger grains will cut faster as they also cut deeper
*Adhesion between grains, between grains and backing, between grains and matrix: determines how quickly grains are lost from the abrasive and how soon fresh grains, if present, are exposed
*Contact force: more force will cause faster abrasion
*Loading: worn abrasive and cast off work material tends to fill spaces between abrasive grains so reducing cutting efficiency while increasing friction
*Use of lubricant/coolant/metalworking fluid: Can carry away [[swarf]] (preventing loading), transport heat (which may affect the physical properties of the workpiece or the abrasive), decrease friction (with the substrate or matrix), suspend worn work material and abrasives allowing for a finer finish, conduct stress to the workpiece.

== Abrasive minerals ==
[[File:Diamond powder paste.jpg|thumb|Diamond powder paste]]
Abrasives may be classified as either natural or synthetic. When discussing [[sharpening stone]]s, natural stones have long been considered superior but advances in material technology are seeing this distinction become less distinct. Many synthetic abrasives are effectively identical to a natural mineral, differing only in that the synthetic mineral has been manufactured rather than mined. Impurities in the natural mineral may make it less effective.

Some naturally occurring abrasives are:
* [[Calcite]] (calcium carbonate)
* [[Emery (mineral)|Emery]] (impure corundum)
* Diamond dust (synthetic diamonds are used extensively)
* [[Novaculite]]
* [[Pumice]]
* [[Iron(III) oxide|Rouge]]
* [[Sand]]
* [[Corundum]]
* [[Garnet]]
* [[Sandstone]]
* [[Rotten stone|Tripoli]]
* [[Feldspar|Powdered feldspar]]
* [[Staurolite]]

Some abrasive minerals (such as [[zirconia alumina]]) occur naturally but are sufficiently rare or sufficiently more difficult or costly to obtain such that a synthetic stone is used industrially. These and other artificial abrasives include:
* [[Borazon]] (cubic [[boron nitride]] or CBN)
* [[Ceramic#Classification of technical ceramics|Ceramic]]
* Ceramic aluminium oxide
* Ceramic iron oxide
* Corundum (alumina or [[aluminium oxide]])
* [[Dry ice]]
* [[Glass]] powder
* [[Steel abrasives|Steel abrasive]]
* [[Silicon carbide]] (carborundum)
* Zirconia alumina
* [[Boron carbide]]
* [[Slag]]s

== Manufactured abrasives ==
Abrasives are shaped for various purposes. Natural abrasives are often sold as dressed stones, usually in the form of a rectangular block. Both natural and synthetic abrasives are commonly available in a wide variety of shapes, often coming as bonded or coated abrasives, including blocks, belts, discs, wheels, sheets, rods and loose grains.

=== Bonded abrasives ===
[[File:Grinding Wheels.jpg|thumb|right|Assorted grinding wheels as examples of bonded abrasives.]]
[[File:Noe schleifstein.jpg|thumb|right|A grinding wheel with a reservoir to hold water as a lubricant and coolant.]]

A '''bonded abrasive''' is composed of an abrasive material contained within a [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]], although very fine aluminium oxide abrasive may comprise [[sintering|sintered]] material. This matrix is called a binder and is often a [[clay]], a [[resin]], a glass or a [[rubber]]. This mixture of binder and abrasive is typically shaped into blocks, sticks, or wheels. The most common abrasive used is aluminium oxide. Also common are silicon carbide, [[tungsten carbide]] and [[garnet]]. Artificial sharpening stones are often a bonded abrasive and are readily available as a two sided block, each side being a different grade of grit.

[[Grinding wheel]]s are cylinders that are rotated at high speed. While once worked with a foot pedal or hand crank, the introduction of electric motors has made it necessary to construct the wheel to withstand greater [[radial stress]] to prevent the wheel flying apart as it spins. Similar issues arise with [[Grinding wheel#Cut off wheels|cutting wheels]], which are often structurally reinforced with impregnated fibres. High relative speed between abrasive and workpiece often makes necessary the use of a lubricant of some kind. Traditionally, they were called [[coolant]]s as they were used to prevent frictional heat build up which could damage the workpiece (such as ruining the [[tempering (metallurgy)|temper]] of a blade). Some research suggests that the heat transport property of a lubricant is less important when dealing with metals as the metal will quickly conduct heat from the work surface. More important are their effects upon lessening tensile stresses while increasing some compressive stresses and reducing "thermal and mechanical stresses during chip formation".&lt;ref&gt;''Grinding Stresses'', Grinding Wheel Institute, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

Various shapes are also used as heads on [[rotary tool]]s used in precision work, such as [[scale model]]ling.

Bonded abrasives need to be trued and dressed after they are used. Dressing is the cleaning of the waste material (swarf and loose abrasive) from the surface and exposing fresh grit. Depending upon the abrasive and how it was used, dressing may involve the abrasive being simply placed under running water and brushed with a stiff brush for a soft stone or the abrasive being ground against another abrasive, such as aluminium oxide used to dress a grinding wheel.

Truing is restoring the abrasive to its original surface shape. Wheels and stones tend to wear unevenly, leaving the cutting surface no longer flat (said to be "dished out" if it is meant to be a flat stone) or no longer the same diameter across the cutting face. This will lead to uneven abrasion and other difficulties.

=== Coated abrasives ===
[[File:Schuurpapier2.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Germany|German]] sandpaper showing its backing and FEPA grit size.]]
{{Main|Coated abrasive}}

A ''coated abrasive'' comprises an abrasive fixed to a backing material such as [[paper]], [[cloth]], rubber, resin, [[polyester]] or even [[metal]], many of which are flexible. [[Sandpaper]] is a very common coated abrasive. Coated abrasives are most commonly the same minerals as are used for bonded abrasives. A bonding agent (often some sort of adhesive or resin) is applied to the backing to provide a flat surface to which the grit is then subsequently adhered. A woven backing may also use a filler agent (again, often a resin) to provide additional resilience.

Coated abrasives may be shaped for use in rotary and orbital sanders, for wrapping around sanding blocks, as handpads, as closed loops for use on [[belt grinder]]s, as striking surfaces on [[match]]boxes, on [[diamond plate]]s and diamond steels. [[Diamond tools]], though for cutting, are often abrasive in nature.

=== Other abrasives and their uses ===
[[File:Abrasiveness RDA.JPG|thumb|right|Here the abrasiveness of toothpaste is detailed by its Relative [[Dentin]] Abrasivity (RDA)]]
Sand, glass beads, metal pellets [[copper slag]] and dry ice may all be used for a process called [[sandblasting]] (or similar, such as the use of glass beads which is "bead blasting"). Dry ice will [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]] leaving behind no residual abrasive.

[[Cutting compound]] used on automotive paint is an example of an abrasive suspended in a liquid, paste or wax, as are some polishing liquids for [[silver]]ware and [[optical media]]. The liquid, paste or wax acts as a binding agent that keeps the abrasive attached to the cloth which is used as a backing to move the abrasive across the work piece. On cars in particular, wax may serve as both a protective agent by preventing exposure of the paint of metal to air and also act as an optical filler to make scratches less noticeable. [[Toothpaste]] contains calcium carbonate or [[silica]] as a "polishing agent" to remove plaque and other matter from teeth as the hardness of calcium carbonate is less than that of [[tooth enamel]] but more than that of the contaminating agent.

Very fine rouge powder was commonly used for grinding glass, being somewhat replaced by modern ceramics, and is still used in jewellery making for a highly reflective finish.

Cleaning products may also contain abrasives suspended in a paste or cream. They are chosen to be reasonably safe on some [[linoleum]], [[tile]], metal or stone surfaces. However, many [[laminate]] surfaces and ceramic topped stoves are easily damaged by these abrasive compounds. Even ceramic/pottery tableware or cookware can damage these surfaces, particularly the bottom of the tableware, which is often unglazed in part or in whole and acts as simply another bonded abrasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://duratech.co.nz/products/bisonne_laminates_and_sinkware/care_and_maintenance/|title=Care of laminate surface|accessdate=2007-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224023247/http://duratech.co.nz/products/bisonne_laminates_and_sinkware/care_and_maintenance/|archivedate=2007-02-24|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metal pots and stoves are often scoured with abrasive cleaners, typically in the form of the aforementioned cream or paste or of [[steel wool]] and non woven [[scouring pad]]s which holds fine grits abrasives.

Human skin is also subjected to abrasion in the form of exfoliation. Abrasives for this can be much softer and more exotic than for other purposes and may include things like [[almond]] and [[oatmeal]].&lt;ref&gt;Nutrimetics, Honey and Almond Scrub&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dermabrasion]] and [[microdermabrasion]] are now rather commonplace cosmetic procedures which use mineral abrasives.

Scratched compact discs and [[DVD]]s may sometimes be repaired through buffing with a very fine compound, the principle being that a multitude of small scratches will be more optically transparent than a single large scratch. However, this does take some skill and will eventually cause the protective coating of the disc to be entirely eroded (especially if the original scratch is deep), at which time, the data surface will be destroyed if abrasion continues.

== Choice of abrasive ==
The shape, size and nature of the workpiece and the desired finish will influence the choice of the abrasive used. A bonded abrasive grind wheel may be used to commercially sharpen a knife (producing a [[Grind#Typical grinds|hollow grind]]), but an individual may then sharpen the same knife with a natural sharpening stone or an even flexible coated abrasive (like a sandpaper) stuck to a soft, non-slip surface to make achieving a convex grind easier. Similarly, a brass mirror may be cut with a bonded abrasive, have its surface flattened with a coated abrasive to achieve a basic shape, and then have finer grades of abrasive successively appied culminating in a wax paste impregnated with rouge to leave a sort of "grainless finish" called, in this case, a "mirror finish".

Also, different shapes of adhesive may make it harder to abrade certain areas of the workpiece. Health hazards can arise from any dust produced (which may be ameliorated through the use of a lubricant) which could lead to [[silicosis]] (when the abrasive or workpiece is a [[silicate]]) and the choice of any lubricant. Besides water, oils are the most common lubricants. These may present inhalation hazards, contact hazards and, as friction necessarily produces heat, flammable material hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/metalworking_fluids.html|title=OSH Answers: Metalworking fluids|accessdate=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An abrasive which is too hard or too coarse can remove too much material or leave undesired scratch marks. Besides being unsightly, scratching can have other, more serious effects. Excessive abrasion or the presence of scratches may:
*diminish or destroy usefulness (as in the case of scratching [[optical lens]]es and [[compact disc]]s or dulling [[Knife|knives]]);
*trap dirt, water, or other material;
*increase surface area (permitting greater [[chemical reactivity]] such as increased [[rust]]ing which is also affected by matter caught in scratches);
*erode or penetrate a coating (such as a paint or a chemical or wear resistant coating);
*overly quickly cause an object to wear away (such as a blade or a gemstone);
*increase friction (as in [[jewel bearing|jeweled bearings]] and [[piston]]s).

A finer or softer abrasive will tend to leave much finer scratch marks which may even be invisible to the naked eye (a "grainless finish"); a softer abrasive may not even significantly abrade a certain object. A softer or finer abrasive will take longer to cut, as it tends to cut less deeply than a coarser, harder material. Also, the softer abrasive may become less effective more quickly as the abrasive is itself abraded. This allows fine abrasives to be used in the polishing of metal and [[lens (optics)|lenses]] where the series of increasingly fine scratches tends to take on a much more shiny or reflective appearance or greater [[transparency (optics)|transparency]]. Very fine abrasives may be used to coat the [[strop]] for a cut-throat [[razor]]s, however, the purpose of stropping is not to abrade material but to straighten the burr on an edge. The final stage of sharpening [[Japanese sword]]s is called polishing and may be a form of [[superfinishing]].

Different chemical or structural modifications may be made to alter the cutting properties of the abrasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fepa-abrasives.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?portalname=www.fepa-abrasives.org&amp;language=E&amp;folderindex=0&amp;folderid=3&amp;headingindex=3&amp;headingid=79&amp;tabindex=0&amp;tabid=270|title=FEPA Structure|accessdate=2007-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070305023428/http://www.fepa-abrasives.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?portalname=www.fepa-abrasives.org&amp;language=E&amp;folderindex=0&amp;folderid=3&amp;headingindex=3&amp;headingid=79&amp;tabindex=0&amp;tabid=270| archivedate= 5 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other very important considerations are price and availability. Diamond, for a long time considered the hardest substance in existence, is actually softer than [[fullerite]] and even harder [[aggregated diamond nanorod]]s, both of which have been synthesised in laboratories, but no commercial process has yet been developed. Diamond itself is expensive due to scarcity in nature and the cost of synthesising it. Bauxite is a very common [[ore]] which, along with corundum's reasonably high hardness, contributes to corundum's status as a common, inexpensive abrasive.

Thought must be given to the desired task about using an appropriately hard abrasive. At one end, using an excessively hard abrasive wastes money by wearing it down when a cheaper, less hard abrasive would suffice. At the other end, if the abrasive substance is too soft, abrasion does not take place in a timely fashion, effectively wasting the abrasive as well as any accruing costs associated with loss of time.

== Other instances of abrasion ==
Aside from the aforementioned uses of shaping and finishing, abrasives may also be used to prepare surfaces for application of some sort of paint of adhesive. An excessively smooth surface may prevent paint and [[adhesive]]s from adhering as strongly as an irregular surface could allow. Inflatable [[tire|tyre]] repair kits (which, on bicycles particularly, are actually patches for the [[inner tube]] rather than the tyre) require use of an abrasive so that the self-[[vulcanisation|vulcanising]] [[cement]] will stick strongly.

Inadvertently, people who use knives on glass or metal [[cutting board]]s are abrading their knife blades. The pressure at the knife edge can easily create microscopic (or even macroscopic) cuts in the board. This cut is a ready source of abrasive material as well as a channel full of this abrasive through which the edge slides. For this reason, and without regard for the health benefits, wooden boards are much more desirable. A similar occurrence arises with [[glass cutter|glass-cutters]]. Glass-cutters have circular blades that are designed to roll not slide. They should never retrace an already effected cut.

Undesired abrasion may result from the presence of [[carbon]] in [[internal combustion engine]]s. While smaller particles are readily transported by the lubrication system, larger carbon particles may abrade components with close [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]]. The carbon arises from the excessive heating of [[engine oil]] or from [[incomplete combustion]]. This soot may contain [[fullerenes]] which are noted for their extreme hardness—and small size and limited quantity which would tend to limit their effect.

'''Calypso''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|l|ɪ|p|s|oʊ}}; {{lang-grc-gre|[[wikt:Καλυψώ|Καλυψώ]]|Kalypsō}}) was a [[nymph]] in [[Greek mythology]], who lived on the island of [[Ogygia]], where, according to the ''[[Odyssey]]'', she detained [[Odysseus]] for seven years.

==Etymology==
The [[etymology]] of Calypso's name is from {{lang|grc|καλύπτω}} ({{transl|grc|kalyptō}}), meaning "to cover", "to conceal", "to hide", or "to deceive".&lt;ref&gt;Entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkalu%2Fptw καλύπτω] at [[LSJ]]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'', her name means "concealing the knowledge" ({{lang-grc|καλύπτουσα το διανοούμενον|kalýptousa to dianooúmenon|label=none}}), which – combined with the [[Homeric epithet]] {{lang|grc|δολόεσσα}} ({{transl|grc|dolóessa}}, meaning "subtle" or "wily") – justifies the [[Hermeticism|hermetic]] character of Calypso and her island. &lt;!--a misconnection with "hermetic"? Besides, Hermes visited Calypso's island and Odysseus was Hermes’ great grandson through [[Autolykos]].--&gt;  The word {{lang|grc|καλύπτω}} is derived from [[Proto-Indo-European]] [[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/ḱel-|*''ḱel-'']], making it [[cognate]] with the English word "[[wikt:hell#English|Hell]]".

== Genealogy ==
Calypso is generally said to be the daughter of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'', [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:1.1-1.43 1.14], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:1.44-1.79 1.51&amp;ndash;54], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:7.240-7.286 7.245]; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DEpitome%3Abook%3DE%3Achapter%3D7%3Asection%3D24 E.7.24]. She is sometimes referred to as ''Atlantis'' (Ατλαντίς),{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} which means the daughter of Atlas, see the entry [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2317105 Ατλαντίς] in [[Liddell &amp; Scott]], and also [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3aabo%3atlg%2c0020%2c001%3a938&amp;vers=original&amp;word=%2a%29atlantiko%2fs#word1 938].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pleione (mythology)|Pleione]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]. ''Fabulae, Preface''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hesiod]], and the [[Homeric Hymn]] to [[Demeter]], mention either a different Calypso or possibly the same Calypso as one of the [[Oceanid]] daughters of [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] and [[Oceanus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.%20Th.%20359&amp;lang=original 359]; [[Homeric Hymn]] [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0013.tlg002.perseus-eng1:398-448 2.422]. According to Caldwell, p. 49 n. 359, the Hesiod Oceanid is  "probably not" the same; see also West 1966, p. 267 359. '''καὶ ἱμερόεσσα Καλυψώ'''; Hard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=r1Y3xZWVlnIC&amp;pg=PA41 p. 41].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]] includes the name Calypso in his list of [[Nereid]]s, the daughters of [[Nereus]] and [[Doris (mythology)|Doris]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.%201.2.7&amp;lang=original 1.2.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
In [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', Calypso attempts to keep the fabled [[Greeks|Greek]] hero [[Odysseus]] on her island to make him her immortal husband. According to Homer, Calypso kept [[Odysseus]] prisoner at [[Ogygia]] for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+7.259&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 7.259]&lt;/ref&gt; Calypso enchants Odysseus with her singing as she moves to and fro, weaving on her loom with a golden shuttle. Odysseus soon comes to wish for circumstances to change.

Odysseus can no longer bear being separated from his wife [[Penelope]] and wants to go to Calypso to tell her. His patron goddess [[Athena]] asks [[Zeus]] to order the release of Odysseus from the island, and Zeus orders the messenger [[Hermes]] to tell Calypso to set Odysseus free, for it was not his destiny to live with her forever. She angrily comments on how the gods hate goddesses having affairs with mortals, but eventually concedes, sending Odysseus on his way after providing him with wine, bread, and the materials for a raft.

Homer does not mention any children by Calypso. By some accounts, which come after the ''Odyssey'', Calypso bore Odysseus a son, [[Latinus]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus]], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DEpitome%3Abook%3DE%3Achapter%3D7%3Asection%3D24 E.7.24]&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Circe]] is usually given as Latinus' mother.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+1011&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130 1011]&lt;/ref&gt; In other accounts Calypso bore Odysseus two children: [[Nausithous]] and [[Nausinous]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.%20Th.%201119&amp;lang=original 1019], Sir James George Frazer in his notes to Apollodorus, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DEpitome%3Abook%3DE%3Achapter%3D7%3Asection%3D24 E.7.24], says that these verses "are probably not by Hesiod but have been interpolated by a later poet of the Roman era in order to provide the Latins with a distinguished Greek ancestry".&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Odysseus and Calypso has some close resemblances to the interactions between [[Gilgamesh]] and [[Siduri]] in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' in that "the lone female plies the inconsolable hero-wanderer with drink and sends him off to a place beyond the sea reserved for a special class of honoured people" and "to prepare for the voyage he has to cut down and trim timbers."&lt;ref&gt;Dalley, S. (1989) "Myths from Mesopotamia" Oxford University Press, Oxford, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
Castle Rock is a bluff of exposed [[St. Peter Sandstone]] from the Middle [[Ordovician]] period. Newly exposed sections are white [[quartz]], while older areas have browner tints from the formation of [[limonite]]. The bluff is along the axis of the [[Sandwich Fault Zone]], separating Ordovician exposures from those of the [[Cambrian]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Wiggers|first=Ray|title=Geology Underfoot in Illinois|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPfw7aIlowIC&amp;pg=PA39|pp=39–41|accessdate=May 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 closing==

A '''cinder cone''' or '''scoria cone''' is a steep [[conical hill]] of loose [[pyroclastic]] fragments, such as either volcanic clinkers, cinders, volcanic ash, or [[scoria]] that has been built around a [[volcanic vent]].&lt;ref name="Poldervaart1971a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Poldervaart|first=A|year=1971|chapter=Volcanicity and forms of extrusive bodies|editor1-first=J|editor1-last=Green|editor2-first=NM|editor2-last=Short|pages=1–18|title=Volcanic Landforms and Surface Features: A Photographic Atlas and Glossary|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=New York|isbn=978-3-642-65152-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usgs"&gt;{{USGS|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429163808/http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Products/Pglossary/CinderCone.html|article=Photo glossary of volcano terms: Cinder cone}}&lt;/ref&gt; They consist of loose pyroclastic debris formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single, typically cylindrical, vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as either cinders, clinkers, or scoria around the vent to form a cone that often is symmetrical; with slopes between 30–40°; and a nearly circular ground plan. Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped [[Volcanic crater|crater]] at the summit.&lt;ref name="Poldervaart1971a"/&gt;

== Mechanics of eruption ==
The rock fragments, often called [[cinder]]s or scoria, are [[glass]]y and contain numerous gas bubbles "frozen" into place as [[magma]] exploded into the air and then cooled quickly.&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt; Cinder cones range in size from tens to hundreds of meters tall.&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt; Cinder cones are made of pyroclastic material. Many cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the summit.
During the waning stage of a cinder-cone eruption, the magma has lost most of its gas content. This gas-depleted magma does not fountain but oozes quietly into the crater or beneath the base of the cone as lava.&lt;ref name=usgs2&gt;{{USGS|source={{cite web|title=Red Mountain Volcano – A Spectacular and Unusual Cinder Cone in Northern Arizona|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2002/fs024-02/|author1=Susan S. Priest |author2=Wendell A. Duffield |author3=Nancy R. Riggs |author4=Brian Poturalski |author5=Karen Malis-Clark |year=2002|id=USGS Fact Sheet 024-02|accessdate=2012-05-18}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lava rarely issues from the top (except as a fountain) because the loose, uncemented cinders are too weak to support the pressure exerted by molten rock as it rises toward the surface through the central vent.&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt; Because it contains so few gas bubbles, the molten lava is denser than the bubble-rich cinders.&lt;ref name=usgs2 /&gt; Thus, it often burrows out along the bottom of the cinder cone, lifting the less dense cinders like a cork on water, and advances outward, creating a [[lava flow]] around the cone's base.&lt;ref name=usgs2 /&gt; When the eruption ends, a symmetrical cone of cinders sits at the center of a surrounding pad of lava.&lt;ref name=usgs2 /&gt; If the crater is fully breached, the remaining walls form an amphitheatre or horseshoe shape around the vent.

== Occurrence ==
Cinder cones are commonly found on the flanks of [[shield volcano]]es, [[stratovolcano]]es, and [[caldera]]s.&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt; For example, geologists have identified nearly 100 cinder cones on the flanks of [[Mauna Kea]], a shield volcano located on the island of [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt; These cones are also referred to as 'scoria cones' and 'cinder and spatter cones.'&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt;

The most famous cinder cone, [[Paricutin]], grew out of a corn field in [[Mexico]] in 1943 from a new vent.&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt; Eruptions continued for nine years, built the cone to a height of 424 meters, and produced lava flows that covered 25&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt;

The Earth's most historically active cinder cone is [[Cerro Negro]] in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt; It is part of a group of four young cinder cones NW of [[Las Pilas]] volcano. Since its initial eruption in 1850, it has erupted more than 20 times, most recently in 1995 and 1999.&lt;ref name="usgs" /&gt;

Based on satellite images it was suggested that cinder cones might occur on other terrestrial bodies in the solar system too.&lt;ref name="wood" /&gt; They were reported on the flanks of [[Pavonis Mons]] in [[Tharsis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bleacher|first1=J.E.|first2=R.|last2=Greeley|first3=D.A.|last3=Williams|first4=S.R.|last4=Cave|first5=G.|last5=Neukum|year=2007|title=Trends in effusive style at the Tharsis Montes, Mars, and implications for the development of the Tharsis province|journal=J.

== Effect of environmental conditions ==
The size and shape of cinder cones depend on environmental properties as different gravity and/or atmospheric pressure might change the dispersion of ejected scoria particles.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=C.A.|year=1979|chapter=Cinder cones on Earth, Moon and Mars|title=Lunar Planet. Sci.|volume=X|pages=1370–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, cinder cones on Mars seem to be more than two times wider than terrestrial analogues&lt;ref name="Ulysses" /&gt; as lower atmospheric pressure and gravity enable wider dispersion of ejected particles over a larger area.&lt;ref name="wood" /&gt;&lt;ref name="numerical_model"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brož|first1=Petr|last2=Čadek|first2=Ondřej|last3=Hauber|first3=Ernst|last4=Rossi|first4=Angelo Pio|title=Shape of scoria cones on Mars: Insights from numerical modeling of ballistic pathways|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=406|pages=14–23|doi=10.1016/j.epsl.2014.09.002|year=2014|bibcode=2014E&amp;PSL.406...14B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it seems that erupted amount of material is not sufficient on Mars for the flank slopes to attain the [[angle of repose]] and Martian cinder cones seem to be ruled mainly by ballistic distribution and not by material redistribution on flanks as typical on Earth.&lt;ref name="numerical_model" /&gt;

== Monogenetic cones ==
Some cinder cones are [[monogenetic volcanic field|monogenetic]] – the result of a single, never-to-be-repeated eruption. [[Parícutin]] in Mexico, [[Diamond Head, Hawaii|Diamond Head]], [[Koko Head]], [[Punchbowl Crater]] and some cinder cones on Mauna Kea are monogenetic cinder cones.

Monogenetic eruptions can last for more than 10 years.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Parícutin erupted from 1943 to 1952.

The '''Department of the Environment and Energy''' is an [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] [[Government department|department]]. 

The Department is responsible for matters including environment protection and conservation of biodiversity as well as energy policy. It was established in July&amp;nbsp;2016 by the [[Turnbull Government]] after the [[Australian federal election, 2016|2016 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-18/malcolm-turnbull-unveils-new-look-ministry/7638492|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824050817/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-07-18/malcolm-turnbull-unveils-new-look-ministry/7638492|archivedate=24 August 2016|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=20 July 2016|first=Stephanie|last=Anderson|title=Election 2016: Malcolm Turnbull unveils ministry with Christopher Pyne, Greg Hunt on the move}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eastern Australian temperate forests''', or '''temperate eucalypt forests''', are an [[ecoregion]] of open forest on [[Highland|uplands]] starting from the east coast of [[New South Wales]] in the [[South Coast (New South Wales)|South Coast]] to southern [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. Four distinguishable communities are found within this [[ecoregion]]: subtropical rainforest, subtropical dry rainforest, warm temperate rainforest, and cool temperate rainforest, where they may also grade to other biomes, depending on the location.&lt;ref&gt;Ashton, D.H. and P.M. Attiwill. 1994. Tall open-forests. Pages 157 – 196 in R.H. Groves, editor. Australian Vegetation. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many systematic National and [[State Park]]s are distributed throughout New South Wales and Queensland, although the representation of habitats varies throughout the ecoregion. In some areas, eucalyptus woodlands and dry forests have been cleared for [[urban development]] or to enhance [[grazing]]. Before Europeans first arrived to Australia, the [[Border Ranges National Park|Border Ranges]] had one of the largest rainforests in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Thackway, R., and I.D.

==Geography==
This ecoregion covers an area between Australia's east coast and the [[Great Dividing Range]], starting just above [[Eden, New South Wales]] in the South Coast, which includes (parts of) the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] to the west [[Sydney]], and ending south Queensland in [[Border Ranges National Park|Border Ranges]].&lt;ref&gt;Harden GJ (ed.) 2000-2002, ''The Flora of New South Wales. Volume 1-2 (Revised Edition)'' New South Wales University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sydney metropolitan area is transitional with regions such as the [[greater Western Sydney|greater west]] (or the [[Cumberland Plain]]) being virtually excluded from this biome since they predominantly contain dry [[sclerophyll]] woodlands and thus would have more in common with [[Mediterranean forest]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Earth Resource Analysis PL 1998, ''Cumberland Plains Woodland: Trial Aerial Photographic interpretation of remnant woodlands, Sydney''.

Eucalyptus communities meandering the coast in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales are usually wet sclerophyl wet forests, ranging from 30 percent to 70 percent closed canopy cover, with the understorey containing small broadleaved trees, [[vines]], [[ferns]] and [[shrubs]]. Wet forests are strictly confined in southeastern Queensland. Subtropical rainforest is the most developed community in New South Wales, growing in warm, fecund sites having rainfall higher than 1,300 mm per year. Dry rainforests occur in sites with lower rainfall, ranging from 600 mm to 1,100 mm annual rainfall. Dry rainforest was distributed in southeastern Queensland where it occupied about half a million hectares, though it has now been broadly cleared for [[agriculture]]. Warm temperate rainforest is far less diverse than the dry or subtropical region, growing on low-nutrient soils. Mostly found to the southern half of the ecoregion in Sydney (parts of [[Hornsby Shire]] and [[Sutherland Shire]]), it has transitional elements of Mediterranean vegetation due to abundant of dry sclerophyll plants surrounding it, which are prevalent communities in [[western Sydney]].&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, A.G. 1990a. Australian Rainforests in New South Wales. Volume 1. Surrey Beatty &amp; Sons, Chipping Norton, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rainforest communities of this region exhibit ecological relations to other regions: the cool temperate rainforest is similar to the biome found in Tasmania, the warm temperate rainforest has links to the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], and the subtropical and dry regions are also found up north in the Queensland [[Tropical Rainforest]] ecoregion. The Blue Mountains area has over 90 eucalypt taxa, or 13% of the global dispersion.&lt;ref&gt;Glanznig, A. 1995.

==Climate==
These are areas of eucalyptus forest on [[sandstone]] plateau, with smaller sections of cliffs, steep gorges with rainforest vegetation and sandy heath on the coasts. The climate is [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] to the south and [[humid subtropical]] to the north. In the central areas of the Blue Mountains, rainfall averages from 1,100 to 1,400 mm annually.  Climate in the coastal regions is humid, with excessive rainfall (1200 mm to 1600 mm a year). Rainfall decreases as one moves inland to the [[New England (New South Wales)|New England]] region with [[Armidale]] receiving around 800 mm of rain each year on average. Winters in that city are cold and wet and higher elevations receive [[snowfall]] most years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/ausclim/koeppen2.html Climate of Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Further north in the Border Ranges, monthly summer temperatures vary from 21.5C maximum to 19.7C minimum. Corresponding winter temperatures from [[Mount Tamborine, Queensland|Mount Tamborine]] in the Border Ranges vary from 17.8C maximum to 12.3C minimum. Throughout the ecoregion, rainfall is concentrated in the summer. Towards the north of the ecoregion rainfall is lower (750 mm to 1100 mm per year) and more seasonal.

==Flora==

The dominant forest is peppermint [[eucalyptus]] trees, indeed it was the moisture from these trees which was originally thought to cause the blue mist that gave the mountains their name. Shrublands, shrubby woodlands ([[heaths]]), and affiliated [[sandplain]] vegetation are typical of the region's coastal area. The shrub species include, [[Epacridaceae]], [[Myrtaceae]], [[Rutaceae]], [[Fabaceae]], [[Proteaceae]], and [[Cyperaceae]]. The Border Ranges is home to more than 1,200 [[vascular plant]]s.

A variety of eucalyptus trees dominate areas of this large ecoregion, including: in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales (such as in around such as the [[Northern Tablelands]]) - tallowwood (''[[Eucalyptus microcorys]]''), blackbutt (''[[Eucalyptus pilularis]]''), brush box (''[[Lophostemon confertus]]''), flooded gum (''[[Eucalyptus grandis]]''), and Gympie messmate (''[[Eucalyptus cloeziana]]''); southern New South Wales - Sydney blue gum (''[[Eucalyptus saligna]]''), the grey ironbark (''[[Eucalyptus paniculata]]''), and blackbutt; and on the New South Wales coast  a [[stringybark]] (''Eucalyptus eugenioides''). Trees in the warm temperate forests include coachwood (''[[Ceratopetalum apetalum]]''), sassafras (''[[Doryphora sassafras]]''), and lillypilly (''[[Acmena smithii]]'') Typical trees in cool temperate forests include, ''[[Eucryphia moorei]]'' and ''[[Antarctic beech]]''.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, W.J.F., and P. Adams. 1995. Border Ranges. Pages 462 – 466 in S. D. Davis, V.H. Heywood and A.C. Hamilton, editors, Centres of plant diversity. Volume 2. Asia, Australasia, and the Pacific. WWF/IUCN, IUCN Publications Unit, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are particularly rich collections of [[endemism|endemic]] plants in a number of areas: the eucalyptus of the Blue Mountains; the rainforests of Border Ranges area in the [[McPherson Range]] including [[Mount Warning]], [[Nightcap National Park]], and [[Lamington National Park]] including [[Binna Burra]]; and the sand dunes of [[World Heritage Site]] [[Fraser Island]] and the [[Great Sandy National Park]] of southern Queensland. There are well-known areas of rainforest protected as the [[Gondwana Rainforests of Australia]], containing distinct areas of subtropical rainforest in New South Wales, dry rainforest of southern Queensland (although most of this has been cleared for agriculture and pine plantations) and warm temperate rainforest south of Sydney. Finally the coasts are covered with shrubs, heath and other sand dune vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, W.J.F., and J.A. Elsol, 1984. Moreton Region Vegetation Map series, Summary report for Caloundra, Brisbane, Beenleigh, Murwillumbah sheets. Botany Branch, Queensland Department of Primary Industries.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fauna==
Local wildlife includes [[velvet worm]]s and [[koala]]s, while the birds of the forest include [[kookaburra]] kingfishers, [[gang-gang cockatoo]]s, [[crimson rosella]]s and [[striated thornbill]]s and a number of threatened birds including [[red goshawk]] (''Erythrotriorchis radiatus''), [[swift parrot]] (''Lathamus discolor''), [[regent honeyeater]] (''Xanthomyza phrygia''), [[Albert's lyrebird]] (''Menura alberti''), and [[eastern bristlebird]] (''Dasyornis brachypterus''). Overall , upwards of 60 reptiles, 65 mammals, and 275 birds have been transcribed in the Blue Mountains. The [[broad-headed snake]] and the [[stuttering frog]] also exist in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Nix H.A. 1993. Bird distributions in relation to imperatives for habitat conservation in Queensland.

Conference Proceedings, Queensland Ornithological Society Inc., Brisbane.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats and preservation==
These habitats are vulnerable to ongoing clearance for agriculture and urban development and by fires, while [[introduced species]] both weeds and animals, and pollution of water supplies threaten the indigenous wildlife.  However, controlled logging of tallowwood, [[Sydney blue gum]], [[spotted gum]], [[Eucalyptus pilularis|blackbutt]], and [[flooded gum]] does sustain large areas of these indigenous trees as well as formally protected areas such as those mentioned above and [[Royal National Park]] near to Sydney which contains a number of the different habitats described here. Urban areas in this ecoregion include Sydney and Brisbane while resort areas like [[North Stradbroke Island]] and [[Ballina, New South Wales|Ballina]] attract visitors to the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Glanznig, A. 1995.

'''Esmeralda Bank''' is a [[submarine volcano]] around 37 km west of [[Tinian|Tinian Island]] of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It is located at the southern end of the [[Izu-Bonin-Mariana Arc|Mariana Arc]]. It has three summit cones lying along a north-south line. The highest peak is about 43 meters below the sea surface and has a caldera about 3 kilometers wide and several [[Parasitic cone|parasitic cones]] on the edge of the caldera. Sulfur boils and water discoloration have been observed at the site of the volcano, attributed to either eruptions or [[Fumarole|fumarolic]] activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/esmeralda_bank/|title=USGS: Volcano Hazards Program NMI Esmeralda Bank|last=Program|first=Volcano Hazards|website=volcanoes.usgs.gov|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oceanexplorer.noaa.gov/explorations//04fire/background/marianaarc/media/esmeralda_vr.html|title=Mariana Volcanic Chain: Esmeralda Bank Volcano|website=oceanexplorer.noaa.gov|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://scienceblogs.com/eruptions/2010/07/16/a-volcanic-cruise-through-the-1/|title=A volcanic cruise through the Mariana Islands: Part 2|work=Eruptions|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fatwood''', also known as "'''fat lighter'''", "'''lighter wood'''", "'''rich lighter'''", "'''pine knot'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An Awesome Pine Knot Wood Spirit|url=http://www.stixandstoneswoodcarving.com/carving-awesome-pine-knots|accessdate=17 March 2016|work=stixandstoneswoodcarving}}&lt;/ref&gt; "'''lighter knot'''", "'''heart pine'''" or "'''lighter'd'''"{{sic}}, is derived from the [[Heartwood#Heartwood and sapwood|heartwood]] of [[pine]] trees. The [[Tree stump|stump]] (and [[tap root]]) that is left in the ground after a tree has fallen or has been cut is the primary source of fatwood, as the resin-impregnated [[heartwood]] becomes hard and rot-resistant over time after the death of the main tree. Other locations, such as the joints where limbs intersect the trunk, can also be harvested.  Although most resinous pines can produce fatwood, in the southeastern United States the wood is commonly associated with [[Pinus palustris|longleaf pine]] (''Pinus palustris''), which historically was highly valued for its high [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] production.

==History==
The commercial use of fatwood from stumps stemmed from its use to make [[Pitch (resin)|pitch]] and [[pine tar]]. In 1648, a company was formed in [[Sweden]] called ''Norrländska Tjärkompaniet'' (The Wood Tar Company of North Sweden), and was given exclusive export rights [for pinetar - see separate topic- not fatwood] by the [[King of Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maritime.org/conf/conf-kaye-tar.htm |title=Pine Tar; History And Uses |publisher=Maritime.org |date=1997-07-07 |accessdate=2012-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Coniferous tree sap is a [[Viscosity|viscous]] [[liquid]], that contains [[terpene]], a [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[hydrocarbon]]. Over time the [[evaporation]] of the terpene changes the state of the sap; it slowly gets thicker until it hardens into [[resin]]. New fatwood leaks the sticky sap, while in aged fatwood the sap has hardened and is no longer sticky. At every stage of the aging process, fatwood will burn readily, even when wet.

==Wood kindling and tinder==
Because of the flammability of terpene, fatwood is prized for use as kindling in starting fires. It lights quickly even when wet, is very wind resistant, and burns hot enough to light larger pieces of wood. A small piece of fatwood can be used many times to create tinder by shaving small curls and using them to light other larger tinder. The pitch-soaked wood produces an oily, sooty smoke, and it is recommended that one should not cook on a fire until all the fatwood has completely burned out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.duraflame.com/products/fatwood-firestarters |title=duraflame fatwood Firestarters |publisher=Duraflame |accessdate=2017-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution==
There are between 105 and 125 [[species]] classified as [[resin]]ous [[Pine|pine trees]] around the world. Species usable for fatwood are distributed across a range including Eurasia, where they range from the Canary Islands, Iberian Peninsula and Scotland east to the Russian Far East. From the Philippines, Norway, Finland and Sweden (Scots Pine), and eastern Siberia (Siberian Dwarf Pine), and south to northernmost Africa. From the Himalaya and Southeast Asia, with one species (Sumatran Pine) just crossing the Equator in Sumatra,. In North America, they range from 66°N in Canada (Jack Pine), to [[Central America]] to 12°N in Nicaragua (Caribbean Pine). The highest diversity in the genus occurs in Mexico and California. In the sub-tropics of the Southern Hemisphere, including Chile, Brazil, South Africa, Australia, Argentina and New Zealand, the trees are not [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] but were introduced. Anywhere there is a pine tree or pine [[Tree stump|stump]], there can be fatwood that can be found on top of the ground, but it is more concentrated and preserved in stumps.

===The United States===
In the United States the pine tree, ''[[Pinus palustris]]'', known as the Longleaf pine, once covered as much as  {{convert|90000000|acre|km2}} but due to [[clear cutting]] was reduced by between 95% and 97%. The trees grow very large (up to 150 feet), taking 100 to 150 years to mature and can live up to 500 years. The wood was prized and cutting resulted in many hundreds of thousands of stumps that are very resinous, do not rot, and eventually become fatwood. This ushered in a new industry for many years. There is still a market for the wood, but supplies are less abundant. Due to the length of growing time, the ''[[Pinus taeda]]'', also called the Loblolly pine, replaced it for commercial replanting, with a maturity of only 38 to 45 years.

==Industrial uses==
Industrial uses for fatwood include production of [[turpentine]]; when fatwood is cooked down in a fire kiln, the heavier resin product that results is [[pine tar]]. The [[steam]] that vaporizes from this process is turned into a liquid that becomes turpentine.

===Other uses===
Tree resins or by-products are used in many different things to include;
*Household chemicals especially for cleaning such as turpentine and pine oil.
*Nail polish
*medical to include dental
*Cutler's resin is still used in making knife handles.

In wood, '''figure''' refers to the appearance of wood, as seen on a longitudinal surface (side-grain): a "figured wood" is not plain. 

The figure of a particular piece of wood is, in part, due to its [[woodgrain|grain]] and, in part, due to the cut, or to innate properties of the wood. A few of the tropical hardwoods, like the [[Rosewood (timber)|rosewood]]s, may have a unique figure.
 
Types of figure include: angel step, "bear scratches," [[Bird's eye figure|bird's eye]], blister, [[burl]], curl, ribbon curl, dimple, fiddleback, [[Flame maple|flame]], wide flame, "ghost", pin stripe, [[Quilt maple|quilted]], [[Spalting|spalted]] and tiger stripe.

A true fjord is formed when a [[glacier]] cuts a [[U-shaped valley]] by [[ice segregation]] and [[Abrasion (geology)|abrasion]] of the surrounding bedrock.&lt;ref name= Murton2006&gt;{{Cite journal  | last =  Murton | first =   Julian B. | authorlink = |author2=Peterson, Rorik |author3=Ozouf, Jean-Claude | title =    Bedrock Fracture by Ice Segregation in Cold Regions | journal =    [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume =   314  | issue =  5802 | pages =    1127–1129| publisher =   | location =   | date = 17 November 2006| url =   http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/314/5802/1127.full.pdf| doi=   10.1126/science.1132127| id =    | pmid=17110573|bibcode = 2006Sci...314.1127M }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the standard model, glaciers formed in pre-glacial valleys with a gently sloping valley floor. The work of the glacier then left an [[Overdeepening|overdeepened]] [[U-shaped valley]] that ends abruptly at a valley or trough end. Such valleys are fjords when flooded by the ocean. Thresholds above sea level create freshwater lakes.&lt;ref name="Aarseth" /&gt; Glacial melting is accompanied by the rebounding of Earth's crust as the ice load and eroded sediment is removed (also called [[isostasy]] or glacial rebound). In some cases this rebound is faster than [[sea level rise]]. Most fjords are [[Overdeepening|deeper than the adjacent sea]]; [[Sognefjord]], [[Norway]], reaches as much as {{convert|1300|m|abbr=on|0}} below [[sea level]]. Fjords generally have a sill or shoal (bedrock) at their mouth caused by the previous glacier's reduced erosion rate and [[terminal moraine]].&lt;ref name=Alley2003&gt;{{Cite journal   | last = Alley  | first = R.B. | authorlink = |author2=D.

[[Saltstraumen]] in Norway is often described as the world's strongest [[Tide#Current|tidal current]]. These characteristics distinguish fjords from [[ria]]s (e.g. the [[Bay of Kotor]]), which are drowned valleys flooded by the rising sea. [[Drammensfjorden]] is cut almost in two by the [[Svelvik]] "ridge", a sandy moraine that during the ice cover was under sea level but after the post-glacial rebound reaches 60 meters above the fjord.&lt;ref&gt;Jørgensen, Per: ''Kvartærgeologi''. Landbruksforlaget, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jens Esmark]] in the 19th century introduced the theory that fjords are or have been created by glaciers and that large parts of Northern Europe had been covered by thick ice in prehistory.&lt;ref name="Holtedahl" /&gt; Thresholds at the mouths and overdeepening of fjords compared to the ocean are the strongest evidence of glacial origin,&lt;ref name="Nesje, A. 1994"&gt;Nesje, A., &amp; Whillans, I. M. (1994). Erosion of Sognefjord, Norway. ''Geomorphology'', 9(1), 33-45.&lt;/ref&gt; and these thresholds are mostly rocky. Thresholds are related to sounds and low land where the ice could spread out and therefore have less erosive force. [[John Walter Gregory]] argued that fjords are of [[tectonic]] origin and that glaciers had a negligible role in their formation. Gregory's views were rejected by subsequent research and publications. In the case of Hardangerfjord the fractures of the [[Caledonian fold]] has guided the erosion by glaciers, while there is no clear relation between the direction of Sognefjord and the fold pattern.&lt;ref name="Holtedahl"&gt;Holtedahl, H. (1967). Notes on the formation of fjords and fjord-valleys. ''Geografiska Annaler. Series A. Physical Geography,'' 49(2/4): 188-203.&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship between fractures and direction of fjords is also observed in [[Lyngen]].&lt;ref&gt;Randall, B. A. O. (1961). On the relationship of valley and fjord directions to the fracture pattern of Lyngen, Troms N. Norway. ''Geografiska Annaler'', 43(3/4), 336-338.&lt;/ref&gt; Preglacial, [[tertiary]] rivers presumably eroded the surface and created valleys that later guided the glacial flow and erosion of the bedrock. This may in particular have been the case in Western Norway where the tertiary uplift of the landmass amplified eroding forces of rivers.&lt;ref name="Holtedahl" /&gt;

Confluence of tributatry fjords led to excavation of the deepest fjord basins. Near the very coast the typical West Norwegian glacier spread out (presumably through sounds and low valleys) and lost their concentration and reduced the glaciers' power to erode leaving bedrock thresholds. [[Bolstadfjorden]] is 160 meters deep with a treshold of only 1.5 meters,&lt;ref name="Holtedahl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Aarseth"&gt;Aarseth, I., Nesje, A., &amp; Fredin, O. (2014).

Oslo: Cappelen, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://snl.no/Sognefjorden&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hardangerfjord]] is made up of several basins separated by thresholds: The deepest basin Samlafjorden between Jonaneset ([[Jondal]]) og [[Ålvik]] with a distinct treshold at Vikingneset in [[Kvam]].&lt;ref name="Holtedahl" /&gt;

[[File:Muldalsfossen.JPG|thumb|upright|Muldalsfossen waterfall drops several hundred meters from the Muldalen hanging valley to [[Tafjorden]].]]
[[Hanging valley]]s are common along glaciated fjords and [[U-shaped valley]]s. A hanging valley is a [[tributary]] valley that is higher than the main valley and were created by tributary [[glacier]] flows into a glacier of larger volume. The shallower valley appears to be 'hanging' above the main valley or a fjord. Often, [[waterfall]]s form at or near the outlet of the upper valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Glossary of Glacier Terminology| work =| publisher =U.S. Geological Survey| date =May 28, 2004| url =http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2004/1216/h/h.html| accessdate = 2007-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanging valleys also occur under water in fjord systems. The branches of [[Sognefjord]] are for instance much shallower than the main fjord. The mouth of [[Fjærlandsfjord]] is about 400 meters deep while the main fjord is 1200 meters nearby. The mouth of [[Ikjefjord]] is only 50 meters deep while the main fjord is around 1300 meters at the same point.&lt;ref name="Nesje, A. 1994"/&gt;

===Hydrology===
During the winter season there is usually little inflow of freshwater. Surface water and deeper water (down to 100 meters or more) are mixed during winter because of the steady cooling of the surface and wind. In the deep fjords there is still fresh water from the summer with less density than the saltier water along the coast. Offshore wind, common in the fjord areas during winter, sets up a current on the surface from the inner to the outer parts. This current on the surface in turn pulls dense salt water from the coast across the fjord threshold and into the deepest parts of the fjord.&lt;ref name=Skreslet&gt;{{Cite book|title= Fjordene og kyststrømmen|last= Skreslet|first= Stig|publisher= Møre og Romsdal naturvern |year=1980 |isbn = |place= Åndalsnes |pages= 48–54 |work= Rauma/Ulvåa på vektskåla}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolstadfjorden has a threshold of only 1.5 meters and strong inflow of freshwater from [[Vosso]] river creates a brackish surface that blocks circulation of the deep fjord. The deeper, salt layers of Bolstadfjorden are deprived of oxygen and the seabed is covered with organic material. The shallow threshold also creates a strong tidal current.&lt;ref name="Aarseth" /&gt;

During the summer season there is usually a large inflow of river water in the inner areas. This freshwater gets mixed with saltwater creating a layer of brackish water with a slightly higher surface than the ocean which in turn sets up a current from the river mouths towards the ocean. This current is gradually more salty towards the coast and right under the surface current there is a reverse current of saltier water from the coast. In the deeper parts of the fjord the cold water remaining from winter is still and separated from the atmosphere by the brackish top layer. In fjords with a shallow threshold this deep water is not replaced every year and low oxygen concentration makes the deep water unsuitable for fish and animals. In the most extreme cases there is a constant barrier of freshwater on the surface and the fjord freezes over such that there is no oxygen below the surface. [[Drammensfjorden]] is one example.&lt;ref name=Skreslet/&gt;

The Gaupnefjorden branch of [[Sognefjord]]en is strongly affected by freshwater as a glacial river flows in. [[Velfjorden]] has little inflow of freshwater.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Coral reefs===
As late as 2000, some [[coral reef]]s were discovered along the bottoms of the Norwegian fjords.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imr.no/coral/ Institute of Marine Research: Coral reefs in Norway] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011222735/http://www.imr.no/coral/ |date=2008-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These reefs were found in fjords from the north of Norway to the south. The marine life on the reefs is believed to be one of the most important reasons why the Norwegian coastline is such a generous fishing ground. Since this discovery is fairly new, little research has been done. The reefs are host to thousands of lifeforms such as [[plankton]], [[coral]], [[Sea anemone|anemones]], fish, several species of shark, and many more. Most are specially adapted to life under the greater pressure of the [[water column]] above it, and the total darkness of the deep sea.&lt;ref name=natgeofjord/&gt;

New Zealand's fjords are also host to [[deep-water coral]]s, but a surface layer of dark fresh water allows these corals to grow in much shallower water than usual. An underwater observatory in [[Milford Sound]] allows tourists to view them without diving.&lt;ref&gt;Paddy Ryan. ''[http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/EarthSeaAndSky/MarineEnvironments/Fiords/2/en Fiords – Underwater rock walls and basins]'', Te Ara – the Encyclopedia of New Zealand. Updated 21 September 2007. Accessed 2008-04-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skerries===
In some places near the seaward margins of areas with fjords, the ice-scoured channels are so numerous and varied in direction that the rocky coast is divided into thousands of island blocks, some large and mountainous while others are merely rocky points or rock [[reef]]s, menacing navigation. These are called [[skerry|skerries]].&lt;ref name=natgeofjord&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/fjord/?ar_a=1|title=Fjord|publisher=''National Geographic''|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term skerry is derived from the [[Old Norse]] ''{{lang|non|sker}}'', which means a rock in the sea.{{sfn|Moore|1890|p=277}}

Skerries most commonly formed at the outlet of fjords where submerged glacially formed valleys perpendicular to the coast join with other cross valleys in a complex array. The island fringe of Norway is such a group of skerries (called a ''{{lang|no|skjærgård}}''); many of the cross fjords are so arranged that they parallel the coast and provide a protected channel behind an almost unbroken succession of mountainous islands and skerries. By this channel one can travel through a protected passage almost the entire {{convert|1601|km|abbr=on|0}} route from [[Stavanger]] to [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]], Norway. The [[Blindleia]] is a skerry-protected waterway that starts near [[Kristiansand]] in southern Norway, and continues past [[Lillesand]]. The [[Sweden|Swedish]] coast along [[Bohuslän]] is likewise skerry guarded. The [[Inside Passage]] provides a similar route from [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], to [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], [[Alaska]]. Yet another such skerry protected passage extends from the [[Straits of Magellan]] north for {{convert|800|km|abbr=on}}.

===Epishelf lakes===
An epishelf lake forms when meltwater is trapped behind a floating ice shelf and the freshwater floats on the denser saltwater below.  Its surface may freeze forming an isolated ecosystem.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Norge Fjorder1.png|thumb|Important fjords and lakes in [[Norway]]. Note: The part of the map showing the northern fjords has a considerably smaller scale. Blurred coastlines = [[skerry|skerries]]]]

The word ''fjord'' comes from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] (pronounced {{IPA-no|ˈfjuːr|}}, {{IPA-no|ˈfjøːr|}}, {{IPA-no|ˈfjuːɽ|}} or {{IPA-no|ˈfjøːɽ|}} in various [[Norwegian dialects|dialects]]), where it can have a more general meaning: in many cases to refer to any long narrow body of water, [[inlet]] or [[Channel (geography)|channel]] (for example, see [[Oslofjord]]).

The [[Old Norse|Norse]] [[verb]] ''{{lang|non|ferd}}'' (travelling/ferrying), the [[Old Norse|Norse]] [[noun]] substantive ''{{lang|non|fjǫrðr}}'' means a "[[lake]]-like" [[body of water|waterbody]] used for passage and ferrying, which is of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] origin (*''{{PIE|prtús}}'' from *''{{PIE|por-}}'' or *''{{PIE|per}}'').&lt;ref name="s"&gt;[https://snl.no/fjord Store norske leksikon – Fjord], snl.no&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scandinavian ''fjord'', [[Proto-Norse|Proto-Scandinavian]] *''{{lang|non|ferþuz}}'', is the origin for similar [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] words: [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''{{lang|is|fjörður}}'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''{{lang|sv|fjärd}}'' (for Baltic waterbodies), [[Scots language|Scots]] ''{{lang|sco|[[firth]]}}''.&lt;ref name="s" /&gt; The Norse noun ''{{lang|non|fjǫrðr}}'' was adopted in German as ''{{lang|de|Förde}}'', used for the narrow long bays of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], and in English as ''firth'' "fjord, river mouth". The English word ''[[ford (crossing)|ford]]'' (compare [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Furt}}'', [[Low German]] ''{{lang|nds|Ford}}'' or ''{{lang|nds|Vörde}}'', in [[Dutch language|Dutch]] names ''{{lang|nl|voorde}}'' such as Vilvoorde, [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|πόρος}}, ''{{lang|grc-Latn|poros}}'', and [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|portus}}'') is assumed to originate from Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|ferþu-}}'' and Indo-European root *''{{PIE|pertu-}}'' meaning "crossing point". Fjord/firth/Förde as well as ford/Furt/Vörde/voorde refer to a Germanic noun for ''a travel'': [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] ''{{lang|gmq|ferd}}'' or ''{{lang|gmq|färd}}'' and of the verb ''to travel'', Dutch ''{{lang|nl|varen}}'', German ''{{lang|de|fahren}}''; English ''to fare''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Norsk etymologisk ordbok |last=de Caprona |first=Yann |publisher=Kagge |year=2014 |isbn=978-8-2489-1054-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[loanword]] from [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], it is one of the few words in the English language to start with the sequence ''fj''.&lt;ref&gt;[[fjeld]] is another&lt;/ref&gt;  The word was for a long time normally rendered ''f'''i'''ord'',&lt;ref&gt;In 1926 the [[A Dictionary of Modern English Usage]] said: ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vr7muDFR6j4C&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=fjord+spelling+fiord&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F42V_w9IpT&amp;sig=SsJ9arOIEAZUP-qVjew3JMvjPlQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Zl8GTaW8G5PQsAOx1_nnCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=fjord%20spelling%20fiord&amp;f=false "The OED gives precedence to fi-. The other spelling is apparently used in English to help the ignorant to call it fyord; as, instead of helping, it only puzzles them, it should be abandoned"]''&lt;/ref&gt; a spelling preserved in place names such as [[Grise Fiord]], but now generally current only in [[New Zealand English]].

The use of the word fjord in Norwegian, Danish and Swedish is more general than in English and in international scientific terminology. In Scandinavia, ''fjord'' is used for a narrow inlet of the sea in Norway, Denmark and western Sweden, but this is not its only application. In Norway and Iceland, the usage is closest to the Old Norse, with fjord used for both a firth and for a long, narrow inlet. In eastern Norway, the term is also applied to long narrow freshwater lakes (for instance [[Mjøsa]] [commonly referred to as ''{{lang|no|fjorden}}''], [[Randsfjorden]] and [[Tyrifjorden]]) and sometimes even to rivers (in local usage, for instance in [[Flå]] in [[Hallingdal]], the Hallingdal river is referred to as ''{{lang|no|fjorden}}''). In southeast Sweden, the name [[fjard]] ''{{lang|sv|fjärd}}'' is a subdivision of the term 'fjord' used for bays, [[bight (geography)|bights]] and narrow inlets on the Swedish [[Baltic Sea]] coast, and in most Swedish lakes. This latter term is also used for bodies of water off the coast of Finland where [[Finland Swedish]] is spoken. In Danish, the word may even apply to shallow [[lagoon]]s. In modern Icelandic, ''{{lang|is|fjörður}}'' is still used with the broader meaning of firth or inlet. In [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''{{lang|fo|fjørður}}'' is used both about inlets and about broader sounds, whereas a narrower sound is called ''{{lang|fo|sund}}''. In the [[Finnish language]], a word ''{{lang|fi|vuono}}'' is used although there is only one fjord in Finland. Small waterfalls within these fjords are also used as freshwater resources for the people of Scandinavia and, in particular, Norway.

In old Norse [[Genitive case|genitive]] was ''fjarðar'' whereas [[Dative case|dative]] was ''firði''. The dative form has become common place names like Førde (for instance [[Førde]]), Fyrde or Førre (for instance [[Førre]]).&lt;ref&gt;Rygh, O. (1898). ''Norske Gaardnavne: Oplysninger samlede til Brug ved Matrikelens Revision.'' Kristiania: Fabritius.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German use of the word ''{{lang|de|Föhrde}}'' for long narrow bays on their Baltic Sea coastline, indicates a common [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin of the word. The landscape consists mainly of moraine heaps. The ''{{lang|de|Föhrden}}'' and some "fjords" on the east side of Jutland, Denmark are also of glacial origin. But while the glaciers digging "real" fjords moved from the mountains to the sea, in Denmark and Germany they were tongues of a huge glacier covering the basin of which is now the Baltic Sea. See [[Förden and East Jutland Fjorde]].

Whereas fjord names mostly describe bays (though not always geological fjords), [[strait]]s in the same regions typically are named ''Sund'', in Scandinavian languages as well as in German. The word is related to "to sunder" in the meaning of "to separate". So the use of ''[[Sound (geography)|Sound]]'' to name fjords in North America and New Zealand differs from the European meaning of that word.

The name of [[Wexford]] in [[Ireland]] is originally derived from ''{{lang|non|Veisafjǫrðr}}'' ("inlet of the mud flats") in Old Norse, as used by the [[Viking]] settlers—though the inlet at that place in modern terms is an [[estuary]], not a fjord.

Before or in the early phase of [[Old Norse]] ''{{lang|non|angr}}'' was another [[common noun]] for fjords and other inlets of the ocean. This word has survived only as a suffix in names of some Scandinavian fjords and has in same cases also been transferred to adjacent settlements or surrounding areas for instance [[Hardanger]], [[Stavanger]] and [[Geiranger]].&lt;ref&gt;Rygh, O. (1896). ''Norske Fjordnavne.'' Kristiania: Aschehoug.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helle, Knut (1975). ''Stavanger: fra våg til by.'' Stavanger: Stabenfeldt. {{ISBN|8253201893}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differences in definitions==
[[File:Limski Istria 1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Lim (Croatia)|Lim]] bay in Croatia is commonly called a fjord but is scientifically a [[ria]].]]

The differences in usage between the [[English language|English]] and the [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] have contributed to confusion in the use of the term fjord. Bodies of water that are clearly fjords in Scandinavian languages are not considered fjords in English; similarly bodies of water that would clearly not be fjords in the Scandinavian sense have been named or suggested to be fjords. Examples of this confused usage follow.

The [[Bay of Kotor]] in [[Montenegro]] has been suggested by some to be a fjord, but is in fact a drowned river canyon or [[ria]]. Similarly the [[Lim (Croatia)|Lim]] bay in [[Istria]], [[Croatia]], is sometimes called "Lim fjord" although it was not carved by glacial erosion but instead is a [[ria]] dug by the river Pazinčica. The [[Croats]] call it ''{{lang|hr|Limski kanal}}'', which does not translate precisely to the English equivalent either.

In the [[Danish language]] any inlet is called a fjord, but none of the fjords of [[Denmark]] may be considered a fjord in the geological sense. [[Limfjord]] in English terminology is a [[sound (geography)|sound]], since it separates the [[North Jutlandic Island]] (Vendsyssel-Thy) from the rest of [[Jutland]]. [[Ringkøbing Fjord]] on the western coast of [[Jutland]] is a [[lagoon]]. The long narrow fjords of Denmark's [[Baltic Sea]] coast like the German {{lang|de|[[Förde]]n}} were dug by ice moving from the sea upon land, while fjords in the geological sense were dug by ice moving from the mountains down to the sea.

The fjords in [[Finnmark]] (Norway), which are fjords in the [[Scandinavia]]n sense of the term, are not universally considered to be  fjords by the scientific community.&lt;ref name="Bird2008a"&gt;Bird, E.C.F. (2008) ''Coastal Geomorphology: An Introduction'', 2nd ed. John Wiley and Sons Ltd. West Sussex, England. {{ISBN|978-0-470-51729-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although glacially formed, most Finnmark fjords lack the steep-sided valleys of the more southerly Norwegian fjords since the glacial pack was deep enough to cover even the high grounds when they were formed. The [[Oslofjord]] on the other hand is a rift valley, and not glacially formed.

In [[Acapulco]], [[Mexico]], the [[calanque]]s—narrow, rocky inlets—on the western side of the city, where the famous cliff-divers perform daily, are described in the city's tourist literature &lt;!--or in guidebooks; more than one--&gt; as being fjords.&lt;!--I think they even attribute them to glaciation--&gt;

==Freshwater fjords==
[[File:Eid map.jpg|thumb|[[Hornindalsvatnet]] separated from the [[Nordfjorden (Sogn og Fjordane)|Nordfjord]] by the Nordfjordeid isthmus]]
[[File:Eidfjord in eine fantastische Landschaft eingebettet.jpg|thumb|Eidfjord village beneath the high terrace, the original ice-age delta. The river has carved a gorge through the terrace.]]
Some Norwegian freshwater lakes that have formed in long glacially carved valleys with sill thresholds, ice front deltas or terminal [[moraine]]s blocking the outlet follow the Norwegian naming convention; they are frequently named fjords. Ice front deltas developed when the ice front was relatively stable for long time during the melting of the ice shield. The resulting landform is an [[isthmus]] between the lake and the saltwater fjord, in Norwegian called "eid" as in placename [[Eidfjord]] or [[Nordfjordeid]]. The post-glacial rebound changed these deltas into terraces up to the level of the original sea level. In Eidfjord, [[Eio (river)|Eio]] has dug through the original delta and left a terrace 110 meter while lake is only 19 meters above sea level.&lt;ref&gt;''Geografi: landskap, ressursar, menneske, miljø.''

One of Norway's largest is [[Tyrifjorden]] at 63 meters above sea level and an average depth at 97 meters most of the lake is under sea level. Norway's largest lake, [[Mjøsa]], is also referred to as "the fjord" by locals.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gustav Indrebø (1924): ''Norske innsjønavn: Upplands fylke.'' Skrifter (Videnskabsselskapet i Kristiania), Historisk-filosofisk klasse.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the freshwater fjord [[Movatnet]] (Mo lake) that until 1743 was separated from [[Romarheimsfjorden]] by an isthmus and connected by a short river. During a flood in November 1743 the river bed eroded and sea water could flow into the lake at high tide. Eventually Movatnet became a saltwater fjord and renamed [[Mofjorden]] ({{ill|Mofjorden|no|Mofjorden|vertical-align=sup}}).&lt;ref&gt;''Bygdebok for Modalen og Eksingedalen.'' Bind 2. Sogenemnda, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Like fjords, freshwater lakes are often deep. For instance [[Hornindalsvatnet]] is at least 500 meters deep and water takes an average of 16 years to flow through the lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlas.nve.no/SilverlightViewer/?Viewer=NVEAtlas NVE Atlas.

Norges vassdrags- og energidirektorat (Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate). Accessed 13 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Such lakes created by glacial action are also called fjord lakes or [[moraine-dammed lake]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Innsjøenes verden|last=Strøm|first=Kaare|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|year=1959|isbn=|location=Oslo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these lakes were salt after the ice age but later cut off from the ocean during the [[post-glacial rebound]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.artsdatabanken.no/NiN/Naturtype/6|title = Fjord|date = |access-date = 30 January 2016|website = |publisher = Norwegian Biodiversity Information Centre|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160203130343/http://www.artsdatabanken.no/NiN/Naturtype/6|archivedate = 3 February 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[Weichselian glaciation|ice age]] Eastern Norway was about 200 meters lower (the marine limit). When the ice cap receded and allowed the ocean to fill valleys and lowlands, and lakes like Mjøsa and Tyrifjorden were part of the ocean while Drammen valley was a narrow fjord. At the time of the [[Viking Age|Vikings]] [[Drammensfjord]] was still 4 or 5 meters higher than today and reached the town of [[Hokksund]], while parts of what is now the city of [[Drammen]] was under water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = Fra fangstmann til viking|last= Johansen|first= Øystein Klock|publisher= Øvre Eiker kommune|year= 1994|location= Hokksund}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the ice age the ocean was about 150 meter at [[Notodden]]. The ocean stretched like a fjord through [[Heddalsvatnet]] all the way to [[Hjartdal]]. [[Post-glacial rebound]] eventually separated Heddalsvatnet from the ocean and turned it into a freshwater lake.&lt;ref&gt;''Telemark.''

Oslo: Det Beste. 1980. {{ISBN|8270100935}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[neolithic]] times Heddalsvatnet was still a saltwater fjord connected to the ocean, and was cut off from the ocean around 1500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Mikkelsen, Egil (1989). ''Fra jeger til bonde: utviklingen av jordbrukssamfunn i Telemark i steinalder og bronsealder.'' Oslo: Universitetets oldsaksamling. {{ISBN|8271810790}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some salt water fish got trapped in lakes that originally were part of the salt fjord and gradually became freshwater fish such as the [[arctic char]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Utbredelse og status for ferskvannsfisk i innsjøer i Nord-Trøndelag|last = Berger|first = Hans Mack|publisher = NINA – Norsk institutt for naturforskning|year = 1999|isbn = 8242610517|location = Trondheim|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some freshwater fjords such as [[Slidrefjord]] are above the marine limit.

Like freshwater fjords, the continuation of fjords on land are in the same way denoted as ''fjord-valleys''. For instance [[Flåmsdalen|Flåmsdal]] ([[Flåm]] valley) and [[Måbødalen]].&lt;ref name="Holtedahl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, L., Eilertsen, R. S., Solberg, I. L., Sveian, H., &amp; Rokoengen, K. (2007).

[[File:Sogn Aardalstangen IMG 0097.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Årdalstangen]] village on the small isthmus between Årdalsvatnet lake (behind) and Årdalsfjorden branch of Sognefjorden (front)]]
Outside of Norway, the three western arms of [[New Zealand]]'s [[Lake Te Anau]] are named North Fiord, Middle Fiord and South Fiord. Another freshwater "fjord" in a larger lake is [[Western Brook Pond]], in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland's]] [[Gros Morne National Park]]; it is also often described as a fjord, but is actually a freshwater lake cut off from the sea, so is not a fjord in the English sense of the term. Locally they refer to it as a "landlocked fjord". Such lakes are sometimes called "fjord lakes". [[Okanagan Lake]] was the first North American lake to be so described, in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nasmith |first=Hugh |year =1962 |title =Late glacial history and surficial deposits of the Okanagan Valley, British Columbia |place=Victoria, BC, Canada |publisher=BC Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The bedrock there has been eroded up to {{convert|650|m|abbr=on|0}} ''below'' sea level, which is {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on|0}} below the surrounding regional topography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eyles |first=Nicholas |author2=Mullins, Henry T.|author3= Hine, Albert C. |year=1990 |title=Thick and fast: Sedimentation in a Pleistocene fiord lake of British Columbia, Canada |journal=Geology |volume=18 |issue=11 |pages=1153–1157 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1990)018&lt;1153:TAFSIA&gt;2.3.CO;2 |bibcode=1990Geo....18.1153E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fjord lakes are common on the inland lea of the [[Coast Mountains]] and [[Cascade Range]]; notable ones include [[Lake Chelan]], [[Seton Lake]], [[Chilko Lake]], and [[Atlin Lake]]. [[Kootenay Lake]], [[Slocan Lake]] and others in the basin of the [[Columbia River]] are also fjord-like in nature, and created by glaciation in the same way. Along the [[British Columbia Coast]], a notable fjord-lake is [[Owikeno Lake]], which is a freshwater extension of [[Rivers Inlet]]. [[Quesnel Lake]], located in central British Columbia, is claimed to be the deepest fjord formed lake on Earth.

===Great Lakes===
A unique family of freshwater fjords are the embayments of the North American Great Lakes.  Baie Fine is located on the northwestern coast of [[Georgian Bay]] of [[Lake Huron]] in [[Ontario]], and [[Huron Bay]] is located on the southern shore of [[Lake Superior]] in [[Michigan]].  {{clear left}}

The principal mountainous regions where fjords have formed are in the higher [[middle latitudes]] and the high latitudes reaching to 80°N (Svalbard, Greenland), where, during the glacial period, many valley glaciers descended to the then-lower sea level. The fjords develop best in mountain ranges against which the prevailing [[westerlies|westerly]] marine winds are [[Orographic lift|orographically lifted]] over the mountainous regions, resulting in abundant snowfall to feed the glaciers. Hence coasts having the most pronounced fjords include the west coast of Norway, the west coast of North America from [[Puget Sound]] to Alaska, the southwest coast of New Zealand, and the west and to south-western coasts of [[South America]], for example in [[Chile]].

The '''Great Salinity Anomaly''' originally referred to a significant disturbance caused by a major pulse of [[freshwater]] input to the Nordic Seas in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.mindfully.org/Water/2005/Fresh-Water-N-Atlantic16jun05.htm html|title= How Much Excess Fresh Water Was Added to the North Atlantic in Recent Decades? }}&lt;/ref&gt;(Hakkinen. 1999) Since the discovery of this GSA, the term "Great Salinity Anomaly" has been applied to successive occurrences of the same phenomenon, including the Great Salinity Anomaly of the 1980s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0079661198000159|title= "Great Salinity Anomalies" in the North Atlantic | doi=10.1016/S0079-6611(98)00015-9 | bibcode=1998PrOce..41....1B|volume=41|journal=Progress in Oceanography|pages=1–68|author=Belkin Igor M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Great Salinity Anomaly of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2004/2003GL019334.shtml|title=  Propagation of the "Great Salinity Anomaly" of the 1990s around the northern North Atlantic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The recovery time for reversion of such anomalies is typically on the order of several years. (Belkin. 2004) A Great Salinity Anomaly affects sea basins over a wide [[geographical distance]], as seawater moved from one basin to another; this propagation affected numerous far northern sea basins, with the latest arrival being the [[Norwegian Sea]]. (Hogan. 2011)

'''Heart Pine''' refers to the [[heartwood]] of the [[pine tree]], which is the non-living center of the tree trunk, while the [[sapwood (wood)|sapwood]] is the outer living layer which transports nutrients. 
[[File:Heartwood and sapwood in pinus sylvestris.jpg|thumb|Heartwood and sapwood in pinus sylvestris]]
The heartwood from the pine tree, heart pine, is preferred by woodworkers and builders over the sapwood,&lt;ref name=Bomber1961&gt;{{cite techreport |first=R. K.  |last=Bomber |title=Sapwood and Heartwood |volume=2 |institution=Technical Publication Forestry Commission of New South Wales |url=http://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/390286/Sapwood-and-Heartwood.pdf |year=1961|page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to its strength, hardness and golden red coloration. The [[longleaf pine]], the favored tree for heart pine, nearly went extinct due to logging.  Before the 18th century, in the United States, longleaf pine forests, covered approximately 30-60 million acres along the coastal plain from Virginia's southern tip to eastern Texas. These pine trees, 80 to 120 feet tall, require 100 to 150 years to become full size and can live up to 500 years. An inch of heart pine requires 30 years growth. Due to deforestation and over-harvesting since colonial days, only about 3% of the original Longleaf Pine forest remains.&lt;ref name="Kwiatkowski2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frances Kwiatkowski|title=Kingdom of Longleaf|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rDXgjgEACAAJ|date=December 2015|publisher=Coneflower Design|isbn=978-0-692-59060-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hydrogen-terminated silicon surface''' is a chemically passivated [[silicon]] [[Wafer (electronics)|substrate]] whose silicon atoms covalently bonded to hydrogen.

== Preparation ==
One method is to remove the native [[oxide]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) [[thin film]] by [[etching (microfabrication)|etching]] in [[hydrogen fluoride]] aqueous [[solution]], leaving the surface silicon atoms.

Another method uses a hydrogen-covered [[Atomic-force microscopy|atomic force microscope]] (AFM) tip to avoid damaging the fragile silicon surface.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/manipulating-silicon-atoms-to-create-future-ultra-fast-ultra-low-power-chip-technology|title=Manipulating silicon atoms to create future ultra-fast, ultra-low-power chip technology|last=|first=|date=2017-02-17|website=www.kurzweilai.net|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Labidi|first=Hatem|last2=Koleini|first2=Mohammad|last3=Huff|first3=Taleana|last4=Salomons|first4=Mark|last5=Cloutier|first5=Martin|last6=Pitters|first6=Jason|last7=Wolkow|first7=Robert A.|date=2017-02-13|title=Indications of chemical bond contrast in AFM images of a hydrogen-terminated silicon surface|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/ncomms14222|journal=Nature Communications|language=en|volume=8|doi=10.1038/ncomms14222|issn=2041-1723|bibcode=2017NatCo...814222L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==
Since all surface Si atoms are fully co-ordinated, hydrogen termination leads to enhanced stability in ambient environments, unlike a 'clean surface' having unpassivated surface atoms, or [[dangling bond]]s. It is relatively [[Chemically inert|inert]] and can be handled in air without special care for several minutes.

A hydrogen-terminated silicon surface can be flattened at the atomic level by etching. For example, to etch a hydrogen-terminated silicon(111) surface, [[ammonium fluoride]] aqueous solution or [[boiling]] water can be used.

Like other silyl groups of [[organic compound]]s, the H-Si groups on the surface react with [[molecule]]s that have terminal [[unsaturated bond]]s or [[diazo]] groups. The reaction is called [[hydrosilylation]]. Many kinds of organic compounds with various functions can be introduced onto the silicon surface by the hydrosilylation of a hydrogen-terminated surface.

== Potential applications ==
One group proposed to use the material to create digital circuits made of [[quantum dot]]s by removing hydrogen atoms from the silicon surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Injection molding of liquid silicone rubber''' (LSR) is a process to produce pliable, durable parts in high volume.

[[Liquid silicone rubber]] is a high purity platinum cured [[silicone]] with low compression set, great stability and ability to resist extreme temperatures of heat and cold ideally suitable for production of parts, where high quality is a must. Due to the [[Thermosetting polymer|thermosetting]] nature of the material, liquid silicone [[injection molding]] requires special treatment, such as intensive distributive mixing, while maintaining the material at a low temperature before it is pushed into the heated cavity and [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]].

Chemically, silicone rubber is a family of [[Thermosetting_polymer|thermoset]] [[Elastomer|elastomers]] that have a backbone of alternating silicon and oxygen atoms and [[methyl]] or [[Vinyl group|vinyl]] side groups. Silicone rubbers constitute about 30% of the silicone family, making them the largest group of that family. Silicone rubbers maintain their mechanical properties over a wide range of temperatures and the presence of methyl-groups in silicone rubbers makes these materials extremely [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], making them suitable for electrical surface insulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6773|title=Silicone in Medium-to-High Voltage Electrical Applications|date=2012-09-07|website=AZoM.com|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical applications for liquid silicone rubber are products that require high precision such as seals, sealing membranes, electric connectors, multi-pin connectors, infant products where smooth surfaces are desired, such as bottle nipples, medical applications as well as kitchen goods such as baking pans, spatulas, etc. Often, silicone rubber is [[overmold]]ed onto other parts made of different plastics. For example, a silicone button face might be overmolded onto an [[Nylon|Nylon 6,6]] housing.

==Equipment==
In order for the liquid injection molding process to fully occur, several mechanical components must be in place. Typically, a molding machine requires a metered pumping device in conjunction with an injection unit—a dynamic or static mixer is attached. An integrated system can aid in precision and process efficiency. The critical components of a liquid injection molding machine include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasnet.com/articles/plastics-rubber/liquid-injection-molding Liquid Injection Molding]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Injectors.''' An injecting device is responsible for pressurizing the liquid silicone to aid in the injection of the material into the pumping section of the machine. Pressure and injection rate can be adjusted at the operator’s discretion.

'''Metering Units.''' Metering units pump the two primary liquid materials, the catalyst and the base forming silicone, ensuring that the two materials maintain a constant ratio while being simultaneously released.

'''Supply Drums.'''  Supply drums, also called plungers, serve as the primary containers for mixing materials. Both the supply drums and a container of pigment connect to the main pumping system.

'''Mixers.'''  A static or dynamic mixer combines materials after they exit the metering units. Once combined, pressure is used to drive the mixture into a designated mold.

'''Nozzle.''' To facilitate the deposition of the mixture into the mold, a nozzle is used. Often, the nozzle features an automatic shut-off valve to help prevent leaking and overfilling the mold.

'''Mold Clamp.''' A mold clamp secures the mold during the injection molding process, and opens the mold upon completion.

== Characteristics of LSR ==
'''Biocompatibility''': Under extensive testing, liquid silicone rubber has demonstrated superior compatibility with human tissue and body fluids. In comparison to other elastomers, LSR is resistant to bacteria growth and will not stain or corrode other materials. LSR is also tasteless and odorless and can be formulated to comply with stringent FDA requirements. The material can be sterilized via a variety of methods, including steam autoclaving, ethylene oxide (ETO), gamma, e-beam and numerous other techniques, meeting all required approvals such as BfR XV, FDA 21 CFR 177.2600, USP Class VI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSR specific properties|last1=LSR specific properties|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314231708/http://www.cva-silicone.com/en/lsr-specific-properties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Durable''': LSR parts can withstand extreme temperatures, which makes them an ideal choice for components under the hood of cars and in close proximity to engines. Parts fabricated via liquid silicone rubber injection molding are fire retardant and will not melt.

'''Chemical resistance''': Liquid silicone rubber resists water, oxidation and some chemical solutions such as acids and alkali.

'''Temperature resistance''': Compared to other elastomers, silicone can withstand a wide range of high/low temperature extremes.

'''Mechanical properties''': LSR has good elongation, high tear and tensile strength, excellent flexibility and a hardness range of 5 to 80 Shore A.

'''Electrical properties''': LSR has excellent insulating properties, which offer an appealing option for a host of electrical applications. Compared to conventional insulating material, silicone can perform in far higher and lower temperatures.

'''Transparency and pigmentation''':  LSR possesses a natural transparency, this attribute makes it possible to produce, colorful, custom, molded products&lt;ref&gt;http://www.simtec-silicone.com/capabilities/liquid-silicone-rubber/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Injection molding process ==

Liquid [[silicone rubber]]s are supplied in barrels. Because of their low viscosity, these [[rubbers]] can be pumped through pipelines and tubes to the [[vulcanization]] equipment. The two components are pumped through a static mixer by a [[metering pump]]. One of the components contains the [[catalyst]], typically [[platinum]] based. A coloring paste as well as other additives can also be added before the material enters the static mixer section. In the static mixer the components are well mixed and are transferred to the cooled metering section of the injection molding machine. The static mixer renders a very homogeneous material that results in products that are not only very consistent throughout the part, but also from part to part. This is in contrast to solid silicone rubber materials that are purchased pre-mixed and partially vulcanized. In contrast, hard silicone rubbers are processed by [[transfer molding]] and result in less material consistency and control, leading to higher part variability. Additionally, solid silicone rubber materials are processed at higher temperatures and require longer vulcanization times.

Liquid silicone has a very low viscosity index and requires perfect seals of the mould cavity in order to guarantee a burr-free finished product.
As injections are carried out at high temperature, steel dilation and natural shrinkage of materials must be considered at the design stage of the LSR injection tooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSR Mold technology|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529145322/http://www.cva-silicone.com:80/en/lsr-molds-technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

From the metering section of the injection molding machine, the compound is pushed through cooled [[Sprue (manufacturing)|sprue]] and [[Runner (casting)|runner]] systems into a heated cavity where the [[vulcanization]] takes place. The cold runner and general cooling results in no loss of material in the feed lines. The cooling allows production of LSR parts with nearly zero material waste, eliminating trimming operations and yielding significant savings in material cost.

Liquid silicone rubbers are supplied in a variety of containers, from tubes to 55 gallon drums. Because of their viscous nature, these liquids are pumped at high pressures (500 - 5000 psi) based on the durometer of the material. The raw materials are shipped in two separate containers (known in the industry as a kit) identified as "A" and B" compounds, with the "B" side usually containing the catalyst, but may vary based on the brand of silicone used. The two (A and B) compounds must be mixed in a 1 to 1 ratio, usually by way of a static mixer, adding pigment during the mixing process before the curing process begins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.silbione.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/LSR-Users-Guide.pdf|title=Liquid Silicone Rubber — Injection Molding Guide|last=|first=|date=|website=Bluestar Silicones|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the two components come together the curing process begins immediately. A chiller supplying cold water to jacketed fittings is typically used to retard the curing process prior to the materials introduction to the mold. A color pigment can be added via a color injector used in conjunction with the material pump (closed loop metering system) before the material enters the static mixer section.

In a cold deck scenario, the 1 to 1 mixed compound is pumped through cooled [[Sprue (manufacturing)|sprue]] and [[Runner (casting)|runner]] systems into a heated cavity where the vulcanization takes place. The cold runner and general cooling results in minimal loss of material as the injection occurs directly into the part or cavity, saving on overall material costs and using high consistency rubber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.etiroltec.com/liquid-injection-molding.html|title=Liquid Injection Molding|last=|first=|date=|website=Elastomer Technologies|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cooling allows production of LSR parts with nearly zero material valve gate waste, however this does not guarantee a "flash free" finished part. Molds and tooling are varying in design, execution and cost. A good cold runner is expensive as compared to conventional hot runner tooling, and has the potential to provide a high level of performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3090">'''Internally rifled boiler tubes''' are used to evaporate [[water]] into [[steam]] inside [[boiler]]s of [[thermal power plant]]s. Because of their internally [[rifling|rifled]] shape, they are more efficient. The [[boiling crisis]] takes place later, thus allowing for greater [[heat transfer]] between the pipe and the fluid inside the pipe.  Costs of this type of tube are generally higher than plain tubes.  Current research into these tubes is being conducted due to their potential to increase efficiency of [[power plant]]s.

==History==
These tubes are sometimes called ''Serve tubes'' after the name of their [[France|French]] inventor. However, Serve's tubes were for use in [[fire-tube boiler]]s rather than the [[water-tube boiler]]s used in modern power stations and were lobed or finned rather than rifled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thierry.stora.free.fr/english/typfr_ac.htm Typically French accessories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Later on [[Siemens]] came up with the research project and introduced the name SLMF (Siemens Low Mass Flux).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johansen|first=Axel Ohrt|title=Modelling of rifled boiler tubes|url=http://www.mek.dtu.dk/Forskning/Projekter-phd/phd_axelohrtjohansen.aspx|work=Denmark Teknikal Universiti|publisher=University of Denmark|accessdate=12 April 2013}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Working==
The internally rifled (also known as ribbed) tubes are used in boilers and heat exchangers for efficient results in terms of heat transfer. The internal ribs of rifles introduce the [[centrifugal force]] inside the tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yue|first=Guangxi|title=Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Fluidized Bed Combustion|year=2009|publisher=Springer|location=USA|isbn=9783642026829|pages=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flowing media ( which commonly is a mixture of steam and water) as a result of this centrifugal force, separates water from the steam mixture and forces water towards the wall and there is no steam-film formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Viswanathan|first=Ramaswamy|title=Damage Mechanisms and Life Assessment of High Temperature Components|year=1989|publisher=ASM International,|location=USA|isbn=9780871703583|page=190}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process increases the surface area for the maximum heat transfer when compared to the smooth tubes.&lt;ref name= 'Hart'&gt;{{cite book|last=Spliethoff|first=Hartmut|title=Power Generation from Solid Fuels|year=2010|publisher=Springer|location=USA|isbn=9783642028564|pages=129–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
# Higher heat transfer rate at higher steam quality levels.&lt;ref name= 'Hart'/&gt;
# Better heat transfer at lower mass flux levels.&lt;ref name= 'Hart'/&gt;
# Reduction in the mean metal temperature of the tube walls.&lt;ref name= 'Hart'/&gt;
# Ability to increase the heat transfer by optimizing rifle geometry.&lt;ref name= 'Hart'/&gt;

==Disadvantages==
# The manufacturing and installation costs  as compared to the normal tubes are higher.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5027">'''Jonathan Evan Maslow''' (August 4, 1948 – February 19, 2008) was an American journalist and author who wrote extensively about nature, with a focus on obscure and little-known animals.

==Early life==
Maslow was born on August 4, 1948, in [[Long Branch, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; He graduated from [[Red Bank Regional High School]] in 1966 and has an annual college scholarship funded by members of his graduating class that is awarded in his memory to a graduate of the school attending college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfnj.org/3111-2/ "The Jonathan Maslow Scholarship Fund Accepting 2016 Applications"], Community Foundation of New Jersey, February 16, 2016. Accessed October 16, 2017. "The Community Foundation of New Jersey today announced that The Jonathan Maslow Scholarship, which it administers on behalf of members of the Red Bank Regional High School (RBRHS) Class of 1966, is accepting applications for the Fall 2016 term."&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Marlboro College]] in 1971 with a major in [[American literature]] and graduated from the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]] in 1974 with a degree in journalism.&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;[[Margalit Fox|Fox, Margalit]]. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/arts/24maslow.html "Jonathan Maslow, 59, a Journalist and Naturalist, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 24, 2008. Accessed October 16, 2017. "Jonathan Maslow, a journalist and naturalist whose travels took him from the rain forests of Central America to the steppes of Central Asia, died on Tuesday in Greenwich, Conn. He was 59 and lived in Dennisville and Passaic Park, N.J."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
His published works included ''The Owl Papers'', a 1983 book illustrated by [[Leonard Baskin]] (a cousin of Maslow's) about his search for a [[short-eared owl]] in the [[New Jersey Meadowlands]]. Perpetuating his theme of tracing unusual animals, his 1986 book, ''Bird of Life, Bird of Death: A Naturalist’s Journey Through a Land of Political Turmoil'', followed the [[quetzal]] bird in [[Guatemala]], while ''Sacred Horses: The Memoirs of a Turkmen Cowboy'', published in 1994, followed the [[Akhal-Teke]] horse in present-day [[Turkmenistan]]. He also worked as a journalist at the ''[[Cape May County Herald]]'' (based at the southern tip of [[New Jersey]]) from 1997 to 2002 and then as an editor at the ''[[Herald News]]'' (in the state's north).&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt; Maslow was honored in 2001 by the New Jersey Press Association for "Towers in Service - The $14M Question," a piece he wrote for the ''Cape May County Herald Times''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njpa.org/njpa/better_newspaper_contest/2001/editorial_weekly.html Better Newspaper Contest - 2001 Editorial Results for Weeklies], New Jersey Press Association. Accessed October 16, 2017. "W-03 Enterprise Weekly, under 4,500 First Place - Jonathan Maslow, Cape May County Herald Times - 'Towers in Service - The $14M Question'"&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote ''The Last Lector'', a play based on a story from his 1996 book ''The Torrid Zone; Seven Stories From the Gulf Coast''.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Al. [http://www.capemaycountyherald.com/community/faces_and_places/article_bf983611-a2eb-52c5-be7b-7bcb7721f5ab.html "Former Herald Reporter Jonathan E. Maslow, 59"], ''[[Cape May County Herald]]'', February 21, 2008. Accessed October 16, 2017. "A play ''The Last Lector'' was written by Maslow and adapted by the late Michael Laird, artistic director of Cape May Stage and played in that resort city for several weeks. It was a drama set in a cigar factory in Tampa, Fla. and was taken from a story in ''Torrid Zone,'' Maslow’s first fictional work."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Susan. [https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/05/books/stormy-weather.html "Stormy Weather"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 5, 1996. Accessed October 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television==
Maslow hosted an episode of the BBC's ''Natural World'' series in 1989, taking viewers on a journey through the [[Darién Gap]] in the production entitled "A Tramp in the Darien." &lt;ref&gt;[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/f02b610f374f43b29f2024e95e63f6c5 "The Natural World, BBC Two England, 3 December 1989"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
A resident of the [[Dennisville, New Jersey|Dennisville]] section of [[Dennis Township, New Jersey]] and the Passaic Park neighborhood of [[Passaic, New Jersey|Passaic]], Maslow died of cancer at the age of 59 on February 19, 2008, in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]]. He was survived by his third wife, Liliya Khobotkova.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

She won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1935 at age 24 for her [[debut novel|first novel]], ''[[Now in November]]''.  Shortly thereafter, she published ''Winter Orchard'', a collection of short stories that had previously appeared in ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'', ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', ''The St. Louis Review'', and ''[[Hound &amp; Horn]]''.  Of these stories, "Dark" won an [[O. Henry Award]] in 1934,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.randomhouse.com/boldtype/ohenry/0999/winnerslist.html O. Henry Winners List]&lt;/ref&gt; and "John the Six" won an [[O. Henry Award]] third prize the following year.  Johnson continued writing short stories and won three more O. Henry Awards: for "Alexander to the Park" (1942), "The Glass Pigeon" (1943), and "Night Flight" (1944).

Johnson was born June 20, 1910, in [[Kirkwood, Missouri]].  She attended [[Washington University in St. Louis]] from 1926 to 1931, but did not earn a degree.  She wrote her first novel, ''Now In November'', while living in her mother's attic in [[Webster Groves, Missouri]].  She remained on her farm in Webster Groves and completed ''Winter Orchard'' in 1935.  She published four more books before marrying Grant G. Cannon, editor in chief of the ''Farm Quarterly'', in 1942.  The couple moved to [[Iowa City]], where she taught at the [[University of Iowa]] for the next three years. They moved to [[Hamilton County, Ohio]] in 1947, where she published ''Wildwood''.

Johnson had three children: Terence, Ann, and Carol. The Cannons continued to move beyond the advancing urban sprawl of [[Cincinnati]], finally settling on the wooded acreage in [[Clermont County, Ohio]], which is the setting of ''The Inland Island''. In 1955, Washington University awarded her an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree.  She published four more books before her death, from pneumonia, on February 27, 1990, in [[Batavia, Ohio]], at age 79.&lt;ref name=NYTobit/&gt;

[[File:ISS-30 Lake Fitri, Chad.jpg|thumb|300px|Satellite image of Lake Fitri]]
'''Ramsar sites in [[Chad]]''' refer to the six sites designated as [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] Wetlands of International Importance in Chad. They cover an area of
{{convert|124050.68|sqkm}}. They include Lac Fitri, Partie tchadienne du lac Tchad, Plaine de Massenya, Plaines d'inondation des Bahr Aouk et Salamat, and Réserve de faune de Binder-Léré.

==Lac Fitri==
The [[Lake Fitri|Lac Fitri Ramsar Site]] measures {{convert|1950|sqkm}} in size and was established on 13 June 1990. The Lake Fitri expands substantially during the rainy season, varying from year to year. Swamps encircle the lake periphery over a length of 150&amp;nbsp;km. ''[[Echinochloa stagnina]]'', ''[[Vossia cuspidata]]'' and ''[[Nymphaea aquatica]]'' are the common vegetation types noted while ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' and ''[[Mitragyna inermis]]'' grow in the flooded zone of the lake. The fringe land area around the lake has annual [[grass]]es and [[sedge]]. Also, as an [[Important Bird Area]] it has both breeding and non-breeding species. It is wintering ground for a large number of Palearctic waterbirds. The large number of bird species recorded here are ''[[Aythya nyroca]]'', ''[[Balearica pavonina]]'', ''[[Ardeola ralloides]]'', ''[[Platalea alba]]'', ''[[Dendrocygna bicolor]]'', ''[[Dendrocygna viduata]]'', ''[[Anas acuta]]'', and ''[[Anas querquedula]]''. It provides refuge during the drought season to Afrotropical species and elephants. It is also known as a productive fishing lake with an annual fish catch of 3,000 tonnes.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/userfiles/file/IBAs/AfricaCntryPDFs/Chad.pdf|format=pdf|title=Important Bird Areas in Africa and associated islands – Chad|accessdate=16 October 2013|publisher=BirdLife International Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ramsar/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lake&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Lac_Fitri_Wetland_Of_International_Importance_Ramsar_Convention|title= Lac Fitri Ramsar Site, Wetland of International|accessdate=18 October 2013|publisher= Protectedplanet.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lake Chad|Partie tchadienne du lac Tchad Ramsar Site]] measures {{convert|16481.68|sqkm}} in size. It was established as a Ramsar Wetland site in 2001&lt;ref name=Ramsar&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ramsar.org/cda/en/ramsar-pubs-notes-anno-chad/main/ramsar/1-30-168%5E16481_4000_0_|title=The Annotated Ramsar List: Chad|accessdate= Ramsar Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the greater transboundary Lake Chad shared with Cameroon, Niger, and Nigeria. The Partie tchadienne du lac Tchad was established under a cooperative effort of the [[Government of Chad]], the [[Lake Chad Basin Commission]], the Ramsar Bureau, [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF), [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), the [[Global Environment Facility]] (GEF), the [[World Bank]], and the [[United Nations Development Programme]](UNDP). It covers the Chad part of Lake Chad bordering a cordon of dunes on the northeast called the "erg" while the southern limits of the lake consists of plains. It is a composite of "open waters, islets and [[sandbank]]s, [[polder]]s, [[oases]] and temporary and permanent "natron" or alkalai pools" covering all the four nations which share it. Apart from water birds, it has about 150 fish species; the [[Kouri Ox]] is an [[endemic]] and threatened species here. The lake's flows are regulated and it also helps inn replenishing ground water. It provides livelihood for 3 million fisher folk. Cattle, sheep and camel are also raised on its banks. Blue algae (''[[spirulina (dietary supplement)|spiruline]]'') is also an important product from the lake.&lt;ref name=Lakes&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.worldlakes.org/shownews.asp?newsid=159|title= Substantial portion of Lake Chad named a Ramsar site (Chad)|date=14 January 2002|accessdate=20 October 2013|publisher=Worldlakes organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plaine de Massenya==
The [[Plaine de Massenya Ramsar Site]] measures {{convert|25260|sqkm}} in size.  It was established on 17 October 2008 in southwestern regions of the [[Chad Basin]]. The Plaine de Massenya wetland consists of freshwater marshes, rivers, streams and creeks. It provides flood moderation, retains the sediment load, and helps in recharge of ground water. Apart from 366 species of birds, there are also wildlife faunal species of [[African elephant]], [[leopard]]s, [[Nile crocodile]] and many more. Fish species also are in abundance and they feed on the plant species ''[[Echinachloa]]'' that thrive in the lake. People living in the area sustain their livelihood by fishing, agriculture and rearing of livestock.&lt;ref name=Ramsar/&gt;

==Plaines d'inondation des Bahr Aouk et Salamat==
The [[Plaines d'inondation des Bahr Aouk et Salamat Ramsar Site]] measures {{convert|49220|sqkm}} in size and is one of the world's largest Ramsar sites. It was established on 1 June 2006, and is situated in a natural depression bordering the [[Central Africa Republic]]. The Plaines d'inondation des Bahr Aouk et Salamat wetland, which also subsumes the Zakouma National Park, provides sustenance to the wildlife of the area. Migratory waterbirds are a common sight. Fauna reported are species of hippos, leopards, elephants and many kinds antelopes. It is an important habitat for fish breeding and the annual fish catch is reported to be 15,000 tonnes. The wetlands fauna is threatened by poaching and vegetation is subject to intense grazing and also forest fires which need to be suitably addressed through community participatory management and environmental education. In this context, [[Global Environment Facility|GEF]] has also launched a pilot project in the area.&lt;ref name=Ramsar/&gt; After the civil war which ravaged the area, the Zakouma National Park has been strengthened with induction of elephants, giraffes and lions with assistance from the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=Designate&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/may2006/2006-05-23-03.asp|title=Chad Designates Enormous Wetland Reserve|date=23 May 2006|accessdate=20 October 2013|publisher=Environment News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plaines d'inondation du Logone et les dépressions Toupouri==
The [[Plaines d'inondation du Logone et les dépressions Toupouri Ramsar Site]] covers an area of {{convert|29789|sqkm}}.  It was established on 14 November 2005 and is one of Africa's largest wetlands. The Plaines d'inondation du Logone et les dépressions Toupouri wetland has number of water bodies in the form of rivers, permanent and temporary ponds, flood plains and lakes. In this widely varying ecosystem, the flora consists of many species including the African [[Palmyra palm]] and the néré (''[[Parkia biglobosa]]'') which are in the threatened list. The avi fauna consists of Occidental Palearctic and Ethiopian migratory species such as the [[black crowned-crane]], [[spur-winged goose]] and [[whistling duck]]'. Fishing is year round vocation of the people who reside in the wetland. The threats faced in the wetland relate to poaching, overgrazing, forest fires, oil exploration and pesticide. The GEF, World Bank, UNDP and Lake Chad Basin Commission have launched a project for its management.&lt;ref name=Ramsar/&gt;

==Réserve de faune de Binder-Léré==
[[Binder-Léré Faunal Reserve|Réserve de faune de Binder-Léré Ramsar Site]] covers an area of {{convert|1350|sqkm}}. It was established as Ramsar Wetland reserve on 14 November 2005 on the Chad-Cameroonian border in Mayo-Kebbi administrative region.&lt;ref name=Parks&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parks.it/world/TD/Eindex.html|title= Parks, Reserves, and Other Protected Areas in Chad|accessdate=17 October 2013|publisher=Parks.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Search&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectedplanet.net/search?country_id=42&amp;q=Chad|title=Search for protected areas|work=Official Record Only|accessdate=17 October 2013|publisher= Protectedplanet.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The wetland consists of lakes, ephemeral and perennial streams, and marshes. The Gauthiot Waterfalls on the Gauthiot River acts as barrier for movement of fish species from the [[Niger River]], upstream into the Lake Chad. The local [[Moundang]] tribals hold this falls in veneration. The site hosts a number faunal species of  manatee, crocodiles, hippos, and cheetahs which are in the endangered list. It is habitat for waterbirds and some of the species are ''[[Dendrocygna]]'' spp., ''[[Balearica pavonina]]'', ''[[Pelecanus rufescens]]'' and ''[[Plectropterus gambensis]]''. Fishing, agriculture, hunting and rearing of livestock are the vocations of the local people for sustenence.&lt;ref name=Ramsar/&gt;

This is a '''list of earthquakes in Japan''' with either a magnitude greater than or equal to 7.0 or which caused significant damage or casualties. As indicated below, magnitude is measured on the [[Richter magnitude scale]] (''M&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'') or the [[moment magnitude scale]] (''M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''), or the [[surface wave magnitude| surface wave magnitude scale]] (''M&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'') for very old earthquakes.  The present list is not exhaustive, and reliable and precise magnitude data is scarce for earthquakes that occurred prior to the development of modern measuring instruments.

==Geological background==
[[File:Japan separation.png|thumb|270px|left|The islands comprising the [[Japanese Archipelago]] were separated from mainland Asia by [[back-arc spreading]]]]

The islands of Japan are primarily the result of several large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-[[Silurian]] to the [[Pleistocene]] as a result of the [[subduction]] of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] beneath the continental [[Amurian Plate]] and [[Okinawa Plate]] to the south, and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]] under the [[Okhotsk Plate]] to the north.

Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the [[Eurasia]]n continent. The subducting plates, being deeper than the Eurasian plate, pulled Japan eastward, opening the [[Sea of Japan]] around 15 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1501.pdf|author=Barnes, Gina L.|title=Origins of the Japanese Islands: The New "Big Picture"|publisher=[[University of Durham]]|date=2003|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Strait of Tartary]] and the [[Korea Strait]] opened much later. Today the Japanese archipelago is considered a mature island arc and is the result of several generations of subducting plates. Approximately 15,000&amp;nbsp;km of oceanic floor has passed under the Japanese area in the last 450 million years, with most being fully subducted.&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt;

Japan is situated in a [[Volcano|volcanic]] zone on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"/&gt; Frequent low intensity earth tremors and occasional volcanic activity are felt throughout the islands. Destructive earthquakes, often resulting in [[tsunami]]s, occur several times a century.{{clear left}}

==History==
Although there is mention of an earthquake in [[Yamato province|Yamato]]&lt;!--Yarnato? printing unclear--&gt; in what is now [[Nara Prefecture]] on August 23, 416, the first to be reliably documented took place in Nara prefecture on May 28, 599 during the reign of [[Empress Suiko]], destroying buildings throughout [[Yamato province]].&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, Joshua. (2006). ''Yokohama Burning: The Deadly 1923 Earthquake and Fire that Helped Forge the Path to World War II,'' p. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ishibashi04&gt;Ishibashi, K. (2004); "[http://www.earth-prints.org/bitstream/2122/763/1/02Ishibashi.pdf Status of historical seismology in Japan]" (30 pages); Earthquake catalogue 47 (2–3);  Collections: 04.06.05. Historical seismology; Annals of Geophysics, accessed 2011-03-19 ([http://www.earth-prints.org/handle/2122/763 English summary])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usami02&gt;[[Tatsuo Usami]] "Historical earthquakes in Japan", In: William H.K. Lee, Hiroo Kanamori, Paul C. Jennings and Carl Kisslinger, (Eds.), ''International Geophysics'', Academic Press, 2002, Volume 81, Part 1, International Handbook of Earthquake and Engineering Seismology, pp. 799–802, ISSN 0074-6142, {{ISBN|978-0-12-440652-0}}, {{DOI|10.1016/S0074-6142(02)80254-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many historical records of Japanese earthquakes exist, and the [[Imperial Earthquake Investigation Committee]] was created in 1892 to conduct a systematic collation of the available historical data, published in 1899 as the ''Catalogue of Historical Data on Japanese Earthquakes''.&lt;ref name=usami02 /&gt; Following the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], the Imperial Earthquake Investigation Committee was superseded by the [[Earthquake Research Institute, University of Tokyo|Earthquake Research Institute]] in 1925.&lt;ref name=Ishibashi04 /&gt; In modern times, the catalogues compiled by [[Tatsuo Usami]] are considered to provide the most authoritative source of information on historic earthquakes, with the 2003 edition detailing 486 that took place between 416 and 1888.&lt;ref name=Ishibashi04 /&gt;

==Earthquake measurement==
In Japan, the [[Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale|''shindo'' scale]] is commonly used to measure earthquakes by [[Seismic scales#Seismic intensity scales|seismic intensity]] instead of magnitude. This is similar to the [[Modified Mercalli scale]] used in the United States or the [[Liedu scale]] used in China, meaning that the scale measures the intensity of an earthquake at a given location instead of measuring the energy an earthquake releases at its epicenter (its magnitude) as the Richter scale does.&lt;ref name="Guide"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2116.html|title=Earthquakes|publisher=Japan Guide|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other seismic intensity scales, which normally have twelve levels of intensity, {{nihongo|''shindo''|震度||seismic intensity, literally "degree of shaking"}} as used by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]] is a unit with ten levels, ranging from ''shindo'' zero, a very light tremor, to ''shindo'' seven, a severe earthquake.&lt;ref name="Guide"/&gt; Intermediate levels for earthquakes with ''shindo'' five and six are "weak" or "strong", according to the degree of destruction they cause.  Earthquakes measured at ''shindo'' four and lower are considered to be weak to mild, while those measured at five and above can cause heavy damage to [[furniture]], wall [[tile]]s, [[wood]]en houses, [[reinforced concrete]] buildings, [[roads]], [[gas pipe|gas]] and [[water pipe]]s.&lt;ref name="Guide"/&gt;

Just before the shaking could be felt, a sound like a cannon was reportedly heard intermittently from the direction of the estuary near the Maruyama River. During the earthquake, the ground in the town of Tokyooka experienced strong seismic vibrations for 16 seconds. As most of the buildings of the time were wooden, many of them were destroyed at once during the initial earthquake. In the fire that broke out subsequently, half of Toyooka was burned down, with many deaths resulting (a reported 8% of the town's population.) 272 deaths were confirmed to have occurred in the Kinosaki area.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8957">{{Main|States of matter}}
Classically, states of matter are distinguished by changes in the properties of matter related to external factors such as [[pressure]] and [[temperature]]. States are usually distinguished by a discontinuity in one of those properties: for example, raising the temperature of ice produces a clear discontinuity at 0°C as energy goes into [[phase transition]], instead of temperature increase. The classical states of matter are usually summarised as: [[solid]], [[liquid]], [[gas]], and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. In the 20th century, increased understanding of the more exotic properties of matter resulted in the identification of many additional states of matter, none of which are observed in [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal conditions]].

==Low-energy states==
===Classical states=== 
* '''[[Solid]]''':  A solid holds a definite shape and volume without a container. The particles are held very close to each other
** '''[[Amorphous solid]]''': A solid in which there is no far-range order of the positions of the atoms.
** '''[[Crystal|Crystalline solid]]''': A solid in which atoms, molecules, or ions are packed in a regular order.
** '''[[Plastic crystal]]''': A molecular solid with long-range positional order but with constituent molecules retaining rotational freedom.
** '''[[Quasi-crystal]]''': A solid in which the positions of the atoms have long-range order, but is not in a repeating pattern.
* '''[[Liquid]]''': A mostly non-compressible [[fluid]]. Able to conform to the shape of its container but retaining a (nearly) constant volume independent of pressure.
** '''[[Liquid crystal]]''': Properties intermediate between liquids and crystals. Generally, able to flow like a liquid but exhibiting long-range order.
** '''[[Disordered Hyperuniformity|Disordered hyperuniformity]]''': A state similar to a liquid and a crystal in properties. Like a crystal, its particles over large distances exhibit uniform density and are unable to compress. Like a liquid, its particles at smaller distances display the same physical properties in all directions.
* '''[[Gas]]''': A compressible fluid. Not only will a gas conform to the shape of its container but it will also expand to fill the container.
* '''[[Plasma (physics)|Plasma]]''': Free charged particles, usually in equal numbers, such as ions and electrons. Unlike gases, plasmas may self-generate magnetic fields and electric currents, and respond strongly and collectively to electromagnetic forces.

===Modern states===
*'''[[Excitonium]]'''
*'''[[Degenerate matter]]''': matter under very high pressure, supported by the [[Pauli exclusion principle]].
**'''[[Electron-degenerate matter]]''': found inside [[white dwarf]] stars. Electrons remain bound to atoms but are able to transfer to adjacent atoms.
**'''[[Neutron-degenerate matter]]''': found in [[neutron star]]s. Vast gravitational pressure compresses atoms so strongly that the electrons are forced to combine with protons via inverse beta-decay, resulting in a superdense conglomeration of neutrons. (Normally [[Neutron|free neutrons]] outside an atomic nucleus will [[Radioactive decay|decay]] with a half life of just under 15 minutes, but in a neutron star, as in the nucleus of an atom, other effects stabilize the neutrons.)
**'''[[Strange matter]]''': A type of [[quark matter]] that may exist inside some neutron stars close to the [[Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit]] (approximately 2&amp;ndash;3 [[solar mass]]es). May be stable at lower energy states once formed.
*'''[[Photonic matter]]''': Inside a quantum nonlinear medium, photons can behave as if they had mass, and can interact with each other, forming photonic "molecules".
*'''[[Quantum]]''': A state that gives rise to quantized [[Hall voltage]] measured in the direction perpendicular to the current flow.
**'''[[Quantum spin Hall effect|Quantum spin Hall state]]''': a theoretical phase that may pave the way for the development of electronic devices that dissipate less energy and generate less heat. This is a derivation of the quantum Hall state of matter.
*'''[[Bose–Einstein condensate]]''': a phase in which a large number of [[boson]]s all inhabit the same [[quantum state]], in effect becoming one single wave/particle.  This is a low energy phase that can only be formed in laboratory conditions and in very cold temperatures. It must be close to zero Kelvin, or absolute zero. [[Satyendra Bose]] and [[Albert Einstein]] predicted the existence of such a state in the 1920s, but it was not observed until 1995 by [[Eric Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]].
*'''[[Fermionic condensate]]''': Similar to the Bose–Einstein condensate but composed of [[fermion]]s, also known as Fermi-Dirac condensate. The [[Pauli exclusion principle]] prevents fermions from entering the same quantum state, but a pair of fermions can behave as a boson, and multiple such pairs can then enter the same quantum state without restriction.
*'''[[Superconductivity]]''': is a phenomenon of exactly zero [[Electrical resistance and conductance|electrical resistance]] and expulsion of [[magnetic field]]s occurring in certain materials when [[:wikt:cooling|cooled]] below a characteristic [[Phase transition|critical temperature]]. Superconductivity is the ground state of many elemental metals. 
*'''[[Superfluid]]''': A phase achieved by a few [[cryogenics|cryogenic]] liquids at extreme temperature where they become able to flow without [[friction]]. A superfluid can flow up the side of an open container and down the outside. Placing a superfluid in a spinning container will result in [[quantum vortex|quantized vortices]]. 
*'''[[Supersolid]]''': similar to a superfluid, a supersolid is able to move without friction but retains a rigid shape.
*'''[[Quantum spin liquid]]''': A disordered state in a system of interacting quantum spins which preserves its disorder to very low temperatures, unlike other disordered states.
*'''[[Heavy fermion material]]s''': [[Heavy fermion material]]s or strongly correlated Fermi systems form a new state of matter that defines by [[quantum phase transition]]s, and exhibits a universal [[scale invariance|scaling]] behavior of its [[thermodynamic]], [[Transport phenomena|transport]] and [[relaxation (physics)|relaxation]] properties. [[Quantum spin liquid]], [[quasicrystal]]s, 2D [[Fermi liquid]]s, [[heavy-fermion]] metals and [[heavy-fermion superconductor]]s can belong to the new state of matter.
*'''[[String-net liquid]]''': Atoms in this state have apparently unstable arrangement, like a liquid, but are still consistent in overall pattern, like a solid.
*'''[[Supercritical fluid]]''': At sufficiently high temperatures and pressures the distinction between liquid and gas disappears.
*'''[[Dropleton]]''': An artificial [[quasiparticle]], constituting a collection of electrons and places without them inside a semiconductor. Dropleton is the first known quasiparticle that behaves like a liquid.
*'''[[Jahn–Teller effect|Jahn–Teller metal]]''': A solid that exhibits many of the characteristics of an insulator, but acts as a conductor due to a distorted crystalline structure. (The experiment was not reproduced and confirmed by other scientists.)
*'''[[Time crystals]]''': A state of matter where an object can have movement even at their lowest energy state.
*[[Rydberg polaron|'''Rydberg polaron''']]: A state of matter that can only exist at ultra-cool temperatures and consists of atoms inside of atoms.

==Very high energy states==
*'''[[Quark–gluon plasma]]''': A phase in which [[quark]]s become free and able to move independently (rather than being perpetually bound into particles, or bound to each other in a quantum lock where exerting force adds energy and eventually solidifies into another quark) in a sea of [[gluon]]s (subatomic particles that transmit the [[strong interaction|strong force]] that binds quarks together). May be briefly attainable in [[particle accelerator]]s.
**'''[[Weakly symmetric matter]]''': for up to 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces were unified.
**'''[[Strongly symmetric matter]]''': for up to 10&lt;sup&gt;−36&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the [[Big Bang]], the energy density of the universe was so high that the [[fundamental interaction|four forces of nature]] &amp;mdash; [[strong interaction|strong]], [[weak interaction|weak]], [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]], and [[gravitation]]al &amp;mdash; are thought to have been unified into one single force. As the universe expanded, the temperature and density dropped and the gravitational force separated, which is a process called [[symmetry breaking]].

{{Earthquakes}}

'''Megathrust earthquakes''' occur at [[subduction]] zones at destructive [[convergent boundary|convergent plate boundaries]], where one [[tectonic plate]] is forced underneath another. These [[interplate earthquake]]s are the planet's most powerful, with [[moment magnitude]]s (''M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'') that can exceed 9.0. Since 1900, all [[earthquake]]s of magnitude 9.0 or greater have been megathrust earthquakes. No other type of known terrestrial source of tectonic activity has produced earthquakes of this scale.

==Terminology==
During the rupture, one side of the fault is pushed upwards relative to the other, and it is this type of movement that is known as [[Thrust fault|thrust]].&lt;ref name="ThrustDefinition"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nthmp-history.pmel.noaa.gov/terms.html | title=Tsunami Terminology | publisher=Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory | work=The National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program History, 1995–2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225143835/http://nthmp-history.pmel.noaa.gov/terms.html | archivedate=2011-02-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are a type of [[Dip-slip faults|dip-slip fault]].  A thrust fault is a reverse fault with a dip of 45° or less.&lt;ref name="DipSlipDefinition"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/glossary/?termID=59 | title=Earthquake Glossary - dip slip | publisher=U.S. Geological Survey | work=Earthquake Hazards Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[fault (geology)#Oblique-slip faults|Oblique-slip faults]] have significant components of different slip styles.  The term ''megathrust'' does not have a widely accepted rigorous definition, but is used to refer to an extremely large thrust fault, typically formed at the plate interface along a subduction zone such as the [[Sunda megathrust]].&lt;ref name="ParkButler2005"&gt;{{cite journal | first1=J. | first10=G. | first11=K. | first12=R. | last1=Park | last10=Ekstrom | last11=Anderson | last12=Aster | title=Performance Review of the Global Seismographic Network for the Sumatra-Andaman Megathrust Earthquake | last2=Butler | first2=R. | last3=Anderson | first3=K. | last4=Berger | first4=J. | last5=Davis | first5=P. | last6=Benz | first6=H. | last7=Hutt | first7=C.

==Areas==
The major subduction zone is associated with the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean]]s and is responsible for the [[volcanic]] activity associated with the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]]. Since these earthquakes deform the [[ocean floor]], they often generate a significant series of [[tsunami]] waves.  They are known to produce intense shaking for periods of time that can last for up to a few minutes.

In Japan, the Nankai megathrust under the [[Nankai Trough]] is responsible for [[Nankai megathrust earthquakes]] and associated tsunamis.

A study reported in 2016 found that the largest megathrust quakes are associated with downgoing slabs with the shallowest dip, so-called [[flat slab subduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-11/uoo-fcm112216.php |title=Fault curvature may control where big quakes occur, Eurekalert 24-NOV-2016 |doi=10.1126/science.aag0482 |publisher=Eurekalert.org |date=2016-11-24 |accessdate=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4549">The '''National Energy Modeling System''' ('''NEMS''') is an economic and energy model of United States energy markets created at the [http://www.eia.gov U.S. Energy Information Administration] (EIA).  NEMS projects the production, consumption, conversion, import, export, and pricing of energy.  The model relies on assumptions for economic variables, including world energy market interactions, resource availability (which influences costs), technological choice and characteristics, and demographics.&lt;ref name="doc"&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/archive/0581(2009).pdf The National Energy Modeling System: An Overview], USDOE-EIA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="assumptions"&gt;{{cite web|title=Assumptions to Annual Energy Outlook 2017|url=https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/assumptions/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==

The primary use for NEMS is to produce the ''[[Annual Energy Outlook]]'', published on the EIA website in the early months of each year.&lt;ref name="AEO"&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/ Annual Energy Outlook Homepage], USDOE-EIA.&lt;/ref&gt;  NEMS is maintained by the EIA Office of Energy Analysis and was first used for ''AEO'' projections in 1994.&lt;ref name="doc" /&gt;

NEMS is also used for special requests related to scenario analysis, primarily from the U.S. Congress.  Subjects such as the economic and environmental impacts of energy-related policy or structure changes are most frequently studied using NEMS.&lt;ref name="assumptions" /&gt;

== Design ==

The model contains several modules that interact as part of the equilibrium calculations for long-term projections.  These modules are as follows:
* The Integrating Module
* The Macroeconomic Activity Module
* The Transportation Sector Module
* The Residential Sector Module
* The Industrial Sector Module
* The Commercial Sector Module
* The Coal Market Module
* The Electricity Market Module
* The Liquid Fuels Market Module
* The Oil and Gas Supply Module
* The Renewable Fuels Module
* The International Energy Activity Module
* The Natural Gas Transmission and Distribution Module

Each of these NEMS modules is maintained annually, with changes to data and methodology described in periodic updates to module-specific documentation reports.&lt;ref name="moduleDoc"&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/analysis/reports.cfm#/T1601,T144 National Energy Modeling System model documentation reports]&lt;/ref&gt;.

NEMS accounts for a variety of energy sources used for fuel purposes (heat and power) and feedstock purposes. The primary energy sources and carriers reported in NEMS include crude oil and lease condensate, natural gas plant liquids, dry [[natural gas]], [[coal]], nuclear/uranium, conventional hydroelectric power, biomass, other renewable energy, and other (not otherwise specified) primary energy. The end-use consumption energy carriers and feedstocks reported by NEMS include, among others, electricity, natural gas, coal, gasoline, distillate oil ([[diesel fuel|diesel]]), residual [[petroleum|oil]], propane, kerosene, liquefied refinery gases, jet fuel, [[renewable energy|renewable]]s (primarily [[biomass]] and wind), and [[petrochemical]] feedstocks.&lt;ref name="browser"&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/data/browser/ AEO Table Browser, Total Energy Supply, Disposition, and Price Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the modules in NEMS may employ its own unique sub-national regional structure. 
Projections from NEMS are provided at the national level; however, regional results are generally available consistent with the modules' regional definitions.  For example, energy consumption by fuel and sector is reported for the nine Census Divisions, the geographic definition used by the four end-use energy demand modules.&lt;ref name="browser" /&gt;
==Availability==
EIA provides access to NEMS to outside users through its model archival program. An archive includes the model source code and input data used to derive a given projection case, such as the "reference case." The stated archive purpose "is to demonstrate that the published results from the AEO reference case can be replicated with the model and to disclose the source code and inputs used." The model is not widely used outside of EIA, as deploying the model requires additional commercial software, such as compilers and optimization modeling packages, in addition to the model source code and data. &lt;ref name="archive"&gt;[https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/info_nems_archive.php Information on Obtaining the NEMS Archive]/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Near-Earth Object Camera''' ('''NEOCam''') is a proposed space-based [[infrared telescope]] designed to survey the [[Solar System]] for [[potentially hazardous object|potentially hazardous asteroids]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20170106"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/science/nasa-psyche-asteroid.html |title=A Metal Ball the Size of Massachusetts That NASA Wants to Explore |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Chang |first=Kenneth |date=6 January 2017 |accessdate=7 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neocam.ipac.caltech.edu/ |title=NEOCam website |publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=15 April 2013 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NEOCam would survey from the [[Lagrangian point#L1|Sun–Earth {{L1|nolink=yes}} Lagrange point]], allowing it to look close to the Sun and see objects inside Earth's orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neocam.ipac.caltech.edu/page/Orbit |title=NEOCam - Orbit |publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=NEOCam: The Near-Earth Object Camera |journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society |first=Amy K. |last=Mainzer |volume=38 |issue=3 |page=568 |date=September 2006 |bibcode=2006DPS....38.4509M}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEOCam would be the successor of the [[NEOWISE]] mission; the principal investigator is also  NEOWISE's principal investigator, [[Amy Mainzer]] of [[NASA]]{{'s}} [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Mainzer/ |title=Amy Mainzer: NEOWISE Principal Investigator |publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date=25 August 2003 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposals for NEOCam were submitted in 2006, 2010, and 2015 to the [[NASA]] [[Discovery Program]], but it has not been selected for launch.

==Overview==
The primary scientific goal of NEOCam is to discover and characterize the orbit of most of the [[potentially hazardous object|potentially hazardous asteroids]] larger than {{convert|140|m|ft|sp=us}} over the course of its four-year mission. NEOCam's field of view would be large enough to allow the mission to discover tens of thousands of new NEOs with sizes as small as {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="instrument"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neocam.ipac.caltech.edu/page/Instrument |title=NEOCam - Instrument |publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=12 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary science goals include detection and characterization of approximately one million asteroids in the [[asteroid belt]] and thousands of [[comet]]s, as well as identification of potential [[Near-Earth object|NEO]] targets for human and robotic exploration.&lt;ref name='Homepage'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neocam.ipac.caltech.edu/page/science |title=NEOCam - Science |publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory |date= |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mainzer2016"&gt;{{cite conference |title=NEOCam: The Near-Earth Object Camera |conference=48th Meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences. 16-21 October 2016. Pasadena, California. |first=Amy K. |last=Mainzer |date=October 2016 |bibcode=2016DPS....4832701M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the NEOCam team proposed to launch in 2021 and find two-thirds of missing objects in the larger-than-140-meters category within four years.&lt;ref name='Mosher 2017'&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/neocam-mission-not-fully-funded-nasa-2017-1 |title=City-killing asteroids will inevitably strike Earth — but NASA isn't launching this mission to hunt them down |work=[[Business Insider]] |last=Mosher |first=Dave |date=13 January 2017 |access-date=31 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==

Although Congress mandated NASA in 2005 to achieve by the year 2020 specific levels of search completeness for discovering, cataloging, and characterizing dangerous asteroids larger than {{convert|140|m|ft|sp=us}} (Act of 2005, H.R. 1022; 109th),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr1022/text/rh H.R. 1022 (109th): George E.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to evolution:
[[File:CollapsedtreeLabels-simplified.svg|thumb|400px|right|A diagram showing the relationships betweens various groups of organisms]]
'''[[Evolution]]''' – change in [[heritable trait]]s of [[Organisms|biological organisms]] over generations due to [[natural selection]], [[mutation]], [[gene flow]], and [[genetic drift]].  Also known as '''descent with modification'''. Over time these evolutionary processes lead to formation of new species ([[speciation]]), changes within lineages ([[anagenesis]]), and loss of species ([[extinction]]). "Evolution" is also another name for [[evolutionary biology]], the subfield of [[biology]] concerned with studying [[Evolution|evolutionary processes]] that produced the [[diversity of life]] on Earth.

{{Geological eon}}
The '''Precambrian''' (or '''Pre-Cambrian''', sometimes abbreviated '''pЄ''', or '''Cryptozoic''') is the earliest part of [[History of the Earth|Earth's history]], set before the current [[Phanerozoic]] Eon. The Precambrian is so named because it preceded the [[Cambrian]], the first [[geologic period|period]] of the Phanerozoic eon, which is named after [[Cambria]], the Latinised name for [[Wales]], where rocks from this age were first studied. The Precambrian accounts for 88% of the Earth's geologic time.

The Precambrian (colored green in the timeline figure) is an informal unit of geologic time,&lt;ref name="Gradstein_et-al_2012"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Geologic Timescale 2012 (volume 1) | publisher=Elsevier | author=Gradstein, F.M.; Ogg, J.G.; Schmitz, M.D.; Ogg, G.M. (editors) | year=2012 | page=301 | isbn=978-0-44-459390-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; subdivided into three [[eon (geology)|eons]] ([[Hadean]], [[Archean]], [[Proterozoic]]) of the [[geologic time scale]]. It spans from the formation of Earth about 4.6 billion years ago ([[Ga (unit)|Ga]]) to the beginning of the Cambrian Period, about {{Period end|Precambrian}} million years ago ([[Ma (unit)|Ma]]), when hard-shelled creatures first appeared in abundance.

==Overview==
Relatively little is known about the Precambrian, despite it making up roughly seven-eighths of the [[History of the Earth|Earth's history]], and what is known has largely been discovered from the 1960s onwards. The Precambrian fossil record is poorer than that of the succeeding [[Phanerozoic]], and fossils from the Precambrian (e.g. [[stromatolites]]) are of limited [[biostratigraphy|biostratigraphic]] use.&lt;ref name=Monroe&gt;{{cite book |first=James S. |last=Monroe |first2=Reed |last2=Wicander |title=The Changing Earth: Exploring Geology and Evolution |edition=2nd |location=Belmont |publisher=[[Wadsworth Publishing Company]] |year=1997 |page=492 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=48aiAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA492|isbn=9781285981383 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because many Precambrian rocks have been heavily [[metamorphic rock|metamorphosed]], obscuring their origins, while others have been destroyed by erosion, or remain deeply buried beneath Phanerozoic strata.&lt;ref name=Monroe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://higheredbcs.wiley.com/legacy/college/levin/0471697435/chap_tut/chaps/chapter08-01.html |editor-first=Pamela J.W. |editor-last=Gore |chapter=The Earliest Earth: 2,100,000,000 years of the Archean Eon |chapter-url=http://higheredbcs.wiley.com/legacy/college/levin/0471697435/chap_tut/chaps/chapter08-01.html |title=The Earth Through Time |last=Levin |first=Harold L. |date=25 October 2005 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The Precambrian Era |chapter-url=http://geo.msu.edu/extra/geogmich/precambrian.html |publisher=[[Michigan State University]] |last=Davis |first=C.M. |year=1964 |title=Readings in the Geography of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is thought that the Earth coalesced from material in orbit around the Sun at roughly 4,543 Ma, and may have been struck by a very large ([[Mars]]-sized) [[planetesimal]] shortly after it formed, splitting off material that formed the [[Moon]] (see [[Giant impact hypothesis]]). A stable crust was apparently in place by 4,433 Ma, since [[zircon]] crystals from [[Western Australia]] have been [[Radiometric dating|dated]] at 4,404 ± 8 Ma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geoscience.wisc.edu/geoscience/people/faculty/john-valley/zircons-are-forever/ |title=Zircons are Forever |access-date=28 April 2007 |year=2005 |work=Department of Geoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Precambrian" is recognized by the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] as the only "supereon" in geologic time;{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} it is so called because it includes the Hadean (~4.6—4 billion), Archean (4—2.5 billion), and Proterozoic (2.5 billion—541 million) eons. (There is only one other eon: the Phanerozoic, 541 million-present.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=[[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] |publisher=[[International Chronostratigraphic Chart]] |date=February 2017 |url=http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale |first=Junxuan |last=Fan |first2=Xudong |last2=Hou |title=Chart |access-date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Precambrian" is still used by [[geologist]]s and [[paleontologists]] for general discussions not requiring the more specific eon names. {{As of|2010}}, the [[United States Geological Survey]] considers the term informal, lacking a stratigraphic rank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=U.S. Geological Survey Geologic Names Committee |title=Divisions of geologic time—major chronostratigraphic and geochronologic units |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |work=U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 2010–3059 |pages=2 |year=2010 |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2010/3059/ |access-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specific date for the origin of life has not been determined. [[Carbon]] found in 3.8 billion-year-old rocks (Archean eon) from islands off western [[Greenland]] may be of organic origin.

Excluding a few contested reports of much older forms from North America and India, the first complex multicellular life forms seem to have appeared at roughly 1500 Ma, in the Mesoproterozoic era of the Proterozoic eon.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Fossil evidence from the later Ediacaran period of such complex life comes from the [[Lantian formation]], at least 580 million years ago. A very diverse collection of soft-bodied forms is found in a variety of locations worldwide and date to between 635 and 542 Ma. These are referred to as [[Ediacaran biota|Ediacaran or Vendian biota]]. Hard-shelled creatures appeared toward the end of that time span, marking the beginning of the Phanerozoic eon. By the middle of the following Cambrian period, a very diverse fauna is recorded in the [[Burgess Shale]], including some which may represent stem groups of modern taxa. The increase in diversity of lifeforms during the early Cambrian is called the [[Cambrian explosion]] of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fedonkin |first=Mikhail A. |author-link=Mikhail A.

==Planetary environment and the oxygen catastrophe==

[[File:Temagami greenstone belt pillow lava.jpg|thumb|Weathered Precambrian [[pillow lava]] in the [[Temagami Greenstone Belt]] of the [[Canadian Shield]]]]
Evidence of the details of [[plate tectonics|plate motions]] and other [[tectonic]] activity in the Precambrian has been poorly preserved. It is generally believed that small proto-continents existed prior to 4280 Ma, and that most of the Earth's landmasses collected into a single [[supercontinent]] around 1130 Ma. The supercontinent, known as [[Rodinia]], broke up around 750 Ma. A number of [[glaciation|glacial periods]] have been identified going as far back as the [[Huronian]] epoch, roughly 2400–2100 Ma. One of the best studied is the [[Sturtian-Varangian]] glaciation, around 850–635 Ma, which may have brought glacial conditions all the way to the equator, resulting in a "[[Snowball Earth]]".

The [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] of the early Earth is not well understood. Most geologists believe it was composed primarily of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other relatively inert gases, and was lacking in free [[oxygen]]. There is, however, evidence that an oxygen-rich atmosphere existed since the early Archean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Clemmey |first=Harry |first2=Nick |last2=Badham |title=Oxygen in the Precambrian Atmosphere |journal=[[Geology (journal)|Geology]] |date=1982 |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=141–146 |doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1982)10&lt;141:OITPAA&gt;2.0.CO;2 |bibcode = 1982Geo....10..141C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, it is still believed that [[molecular]] [[oxygen]] was not a significant fraction of Earth's atmosphere until after [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] life forms evolved and began to produce it in large quantities as a byproduct of their metabolism. This radical shift from a chemically inert to an oxidizing atmosphere caused an ecological crisis, sometimes called the [[Great Oxygenation Event|oxygen catastrophe]]. At first, oxygen would have quickly combined with other elements in Earth's crust, primarily iron, removing it from the atmosphere. After the supply of oxidizable surfaces ran out, oxygen would have begun to accumulate in the atmosphere, and the modern high-oxygen atmosphere would have developed. Evidence for this lies in older rocks that contain massive [[banded iron formation]]s that were laid down as iron oxides.

==Subdivisions==
{{main|Timetable of the Precambrian}}
{{Life timeline}}
A terminology has evolved covering the early years of the Earth's existence, as [[radiometric dating]] has allowed real dates to be assigned to specific formations and features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geosociety.org/science/timescale/ Geological Society of America's "2009 GSA Geologic Time Scale."]&lt;/ref&gt; The Precambrian is divided into three eons: the [[Hadean]] ({{Period start|Hadean}}–{{Period start|Archean}} Ma), [[Archean]] ({{Period start|Archean}}-{{Period start|Proterozoic}} Ma) and [[Proterozoic]] ({{Period start|Proterozoic}}-{{Period start|Cambrian}} Ma). See [[Timetable of the Precambrian]].
* [[Proterozoic]]: this eon refers to the time from the lower [[Cambrian]] boundary, {{Period start|Cambrian}} Ma, back through {{Period start|Proterozoic}} Ma. As originally used, it was a synonym for "Precambrian" and hence included everything prior to the Cambrian boundary. The Proterozoic eon is divided into three eras: the [[Neoproterozoic]], [[Mesoproterozoic]] and [[Paleoproterozoic]].
** [[Neoproterozoic]]: The youngest [[geologic era]] of the Proterozoic Eon, from the [[Cambrian]] Period lower boundary ({{Period start|Cambrian}} Ma) back to {{Period start|Neoproterozoic}} Ma. The Neoproterozoic corresponds to Precambrian Z rocks of older North American geology.
*** [[Ediacaran]]: The youngest [[geologic period]] within the Neoproterozoic Era. The "2012 Geologic Time Scale" dates it from {{Period start|Cambrian}} to {{Period start|Ediacaran}} Ma. In this period the [[Ediacaran fauna]] appeared.
*** [[Cryogenian]]: The middle period in the [[Neoproterozoic]] Era: {{Period start|Ediacaran}}-{{Period start|Cryogenian}} Ma.
*** [[Tonian]]: the earliest period of the Neoproterozoic Era: {{Period start|Cryogenian}}-{{Period start|Tonian}} Ma.
** [[Mesoproterozoic]]: the middle era of the [[Proterozoic]] Eon, {{Period start|Neoproterozoic}}-{{Period start|Mesoproterozoic}} Ma. Corresponds to "Precambrian Y" rocks of older North American geology.
** [[Paleoproterozoic]]: oldest era of the Proterozoic Eon, {{Period start|Mesoproterozoic}}-{{Period start|Paleoproterozoic}} Ma. Corresponds to "Precambrian X" rocks of older North American geology.
* [[Archean]] Eon: {{Period start|Proterozoic}}-{{Period start|Archean}} Ma.
* [[Hadean]] Eon: {{Period start|Archean}}–{{Period start|Hadean}} Ma. This term was intended originally to cover the time before any preserved rocks were deposited, although some [[zircon]] crystals from about 4400 Ma demonstrate the existence of crust in the Hadean Eon. Other records from Hadean time come from the [[Geology of the Moon|moon]] and [[meteorite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/hefferan/Geol106/CLASS3/hadean.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510002121/http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/hefferan/Geol106/CLASS3/hadean.htm |archivedate=2012-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been proposed that the Precambrian should be divided into eons and eras that reflect stages of planetary evolution, rather than the current scheme based upon numerical ages. Such a system could rely on events in the stratigraphic record and be demarcated by [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|GSSPs]]. The Precambrian could be divided into five "natural" eons, characterized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bleeker | first = W. | editor = Felix M. Gradstein | editor2 = James G.

# Accretion and differentiation: a period of planetary formation until [[Giant impact hypothesis|giant Moon-forming impact event]].
# Hadean: dominated by heavy bombardment from about 4.51 Ga (possibly including a [[Cool Early Earth]] period) to the end of the [[Late Heavy Bombardment]] period.
# Archean: a period defined by the first crustal formations (the [[Isua greenstone belt]]) until the deposition of [[banded iron formation]]s due to increasing atmospheric oxygen content.
# Transition: a period of continued iron banded formation until the first continental [[red beds]].
# Proterozoic: a period of modern [[plate tectonics]] until the first [[animal]]s.

==Precambrian supercontinents==
The movement of Earth's [[Plate tectonics|plates]] has caused the formation and break-up of continents over time, including occasional formation of a [[supercontinent]] containing most or all of the landmass. The earliest known supercontinent was [[Vaalbara]]. It formed from proto-continents and was a supercontinent 3.636 billion years ago. [[Vaalbara]] broke up c. 2.845–2.803 [[Giga-annum|Ga]] ago. The supercontinent [[Kenorland]] was formed c. 2.72 [[Giga-annum|Ga]] ago and then broke sometime after 2.45–2.1 [[Giga-annum|Ga]] into the proto-continent [[craton]]s called [[Laurentia]], [[Baltica]], [[Yilgarn craton]], and [[Kalahari Craton|Kalahari]]. The supercontinent [[Columbia (supercontinent)|Columbia]] or Nuna formed 2.06–1.82 billion years ago and broke up about 1.5–1.35 billion years ago.&lt;ref name="Zhao1"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |author2 = Cawood, Peter A. |author3 = Wilde, Simon A. |author4 = Sun, M. |date=2002|title=Review of global 2.1–1.8 Ga orogens: implications for a pre-Rodinia super-continent |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=125–162 |doi=10.1016/S0012-8252(02)00073-9 |bibcode=2002ESRv...59..125Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhao2"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Guochun |last=Zhao |author2=Sun, M. |author3=Wilde, Simon A. |author4= Li, S.Z.  |date=2004|title=A Paleo-Mesoproterozoic super-continent: assembly, growth and breakup |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=91–123 |doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2004.02.003 |bibcode=2004ESRv...67...91Z|url=http://www.gt-crust.ru/jour/article/view/518 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{NICG|date=January 2017}} The supercontinent [[Rodinia]] is thought to have formed about 1.13–1.071 billion years ago, to have embodied most or all of Earth's continents and to have broken up into eight continents around 750–600 million years ago.

[[File:2000 Year Temperature Comparison.png|thumb|right|300px|Reconstruction of global temperature over the past 2000 years, comparing results from researchers using different proxy methods]]
In the study of past climates ("[[paleoclimatology]]"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/proxies/paleoclimate.html Bruckner, Monica. "Paleoclimatology: How Can We Infer Past Climates?"]&lt;/ref&gt; '''climate proxies''' are preserved physical characteristics of the past that stand in for direct meteorological measurements&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/news/what-are-proxy-data|title=What Are "Proxy" Data? {{!}} National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) formerly known as National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)|website=www.ncdc.noaa.gov|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and enable scientists to reconstruct the [[Climate|climatic conditions]] over a longer fraction of the Earth's history. Reliable global records of climate only began in the 1880s, and proxies provide the only means for scientists to determine climatic patterns before record-keeping began.

Examples of proxies include [[ice core]]s, [[tree rings]], [[palynology|sub-fossil pollen]], [[borehole]]s, [[coral]]s, [[Sediment|lake and ocean sediments]], and carbonate [[speleothems]]. The character of deposition or rate of growth of the proxies' material has been influenced by the climatic conditions of the time in which they were laid down or grew. Chemical traces produced by climatic changes, such as quantities of particular [[isotopes]], can be recovered from proxies. Some proxies, such as gas bubbles trapped in ice, enable traces of the ancient atmosphere to be recovered and measured directly to provide a history of fluctuations in the composition of the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strom|first=Robert G.|title=Hot house: global climate change and the human condition|page=253|publisher=Copernicus Books|isbn=978-0-387-34179-8|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To produce the most precise results, systematic cross-verification between proxy indicators is necessary for accuracy in readings and record-keeping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/068.htm "Climate Change 2001: 2.3.2.1 Palaeoclimate proxy indicators."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204100159/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2Fclimate%2Fipcc_tar%2Fwg1%2F068.htm |date=2009-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proxies can be combined to produce temperature reconstructions longer than the [[instrumental temperature record]] and can inform discussions of [[global warming]] and climate history. The distribution of proxy records, just like the instrumental record, is not at all uniform, with more records in the northern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="unisci.com"&gt;[http://unisci.com/stories/20011/0227012.htm "Borehole Temperatures Confirm Global Warming Pattern."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proxies==
{{Main| Proxy (statistics)}}
In science, it is sometimes necessary to study a variable which cannot be measured directly.  This can be done by "proxy methods," in which a variable which correlates with the variable of interest is measured, and then used to infer the value of the variable of interest.  Proxy methods are of particular use in the study of the past climate, beyond times when direct measurements of temperatures are available.

Most proxy records have to be calibrated against independent temperature measurements, or against a directly calibrated proxy, during their period of overlap to estimate the relationship between temperature and the proxy. The longer history of the proxy is then used to reconstruct temperature from earlier periods.

===Ice cores===

====Drilling====

As original means of extraction, the [[Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory|U.S. Army’s Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory]] used an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}}-long modified electrodrill in 1968 at [[Camp Century]], [[Greenland]], and [[Byrd Station]], [[Antarctica]]. Their machinery could drill through 15–20 feet of [[ice sheet|ice]] in 40–50 minutes. From 1300 to {{convert|3000|ft|m}} in depth, [[core sample]]s were 4 ¼ inches in [[diameter]] and 10 to {{convert|20|ft|m}} long. Deeper [[core sample|samples]] of 15 to {{convert|20|ft|m}} long were not uncommon. Every subsequent [[drilling]] team improves their method with each new effort.&lt;ref&gt;Vardiman, Larry, Ph.D. ''Ice Cores and the Age of the Earth.'' p. 9-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio between the &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O [[Properties of water#Heavy water and isotopologues|water molecule isotopologues]] in an [[ice core]] helps determine [[Paleoclimatology|past temperatures]] and [[Precipitation (meteorology)#Measurement|snow accumulations]].&lt;ref name="Strom, Robert p. 255"/&gt; The heavier [[isotope]] (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O) condenses more readily as [[temperatures]] decrease and falls more easily as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], while the lighter isotope (&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O) needs colder conditions to precipitate. The farther [[north]] one needs to go to find elevated levels of the &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O isotopologue, the warmer the period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/Paleoclimatology_OxygenBalance/oxygen_balance.php "Paleoclimatology: the Oxygen Balance."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to oxygen isotopes, water contains hydrogen isotopes - &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H, usually referred to as H and D (for [[deuterium]]) - that are also used for temperature proxies. Normally, ice cores from Greenland are analyzed for δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O and those from Antarctica for δ-deuterium.{{Why?|date=November 2011}} Those cores that analyze for both show a lack of agreement.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} (In the figure, δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O is for the trapped air, not the ice. δD is for the ice.)

[[Air bubble]]s in the ice, which contain trapped [[greenhouse gases]] such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]], are also helpful in determining past climate changes.&lt;ref name="Strom, Robert p. 255"/&gt;

From 1989-1992, the European Greenland Ice Core Drilling Project drilled in central [[Greenland]] at coordinates 72° 35' N, 37° 38' W.  The ices in that core were 3840 years old at a depth of 770 m, 40,000 years old at 2521 m, and 200,000 years old or more at 3029 m [[bedrock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo/icecore/greenland/summit/document/ "The GRIP Coring Effort."]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ice cores]] in Antarctica can reveal the climate records for the past 650,000 years.&lt;ref name="Strom, Robert p. 255"/&gt;

===Tree rings===
[[Image:Tree rings.jpg|thumb|left|Tree rings seen in a cross section of a trunk of a tree|Tree rings seen in a cross section of a trunk of a tree.]]
{{main|Dendroclimatology}}

Dendroclimatology is the science of determining past climates from trees, primarily from properties of the annual [[tree rings]]. Tree rings are wider when conditions favor growth, narrower when times are difficult. Other properties of the annual rings, such as maximum latewood density (MXD) have been shown to be better proxies than simple ring width. Using tree rings, scientists have estimated many local climates for hundreds to thousands of years previous. By combining multiple tree-ring studies (sometimes with other climate proxy records), scientists have estimated past regional and global climates (see [[Temperature record of the past 1000 years]]).

===Fossil leaves===
New approaches retrieve data such as {{CO2|link=yes}} content of past atmospheres from fossil leaf [[stoma]]ta and isotope composition, measuring cellular CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations. A 2014 study was able to use the [[carbon-13]] [[isotope ratio]]s to estimate the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; amounts of the past 400 million years, the findings hint at a higher [[climate sensitivity]] to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://droyer.web.wesleyan.edu/Franks_et_al_2014_GRL_new_stomatal-CO2_proxy.pdf &lt;!--[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014GL060457/abstract Abstract] --&gt;|format=PDF|volume=31|author=Peter J.

===Boreholes===

[[Borehole]] temperatures are used as temperature proxies. Since heat transfer through the ground is slow, temperature measurements at a series of different depths down the borehole, adjusted for the effect of rising heat from inside the Earth, can be "[[Invertible matrix|inverted]]" (a mathematical formula to solve matrix equations) to produce a non-unique series of surface temperature values. The solution is "non-unique" because there are multiple possible surface temperature reconstructions that can produce the same borehole temperature profile. In addition,  due to physical limitations, the reconstructions are inevitably "smeared", and become more smeared further back in time. When reconstructing temperatures around 1,500 AD, boreholes have a temporal resolution of a few centuries. At the start of the 20th Century, their resolution is a few decades; hence they do not provide a useful check on the [[instrumental temperature record]].&lt;ref name="Boreholes_in_Glacial_Ice_p80"&gt;http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11676&amp;page=80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pollack et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pollack|first1=H. N.|last2=Huang|first2=S.|last3=Shen|first3=P. Y.|title=Temperature trends over the past five centuries reconstructed from borehole temperatures|journal=Nature|date=2000|volume=403|issue=6771|pages=756–758|doi=10.1038/35001556|pmid=10693801|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/62610/1/403756a0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are broadly comparable.&lt;ref name="unisci.com"/&gt; These confirmations have given paleoclimatologists the confidence that they can measure the temperature of 500 years ago. This is concluded by a depth scale of about 492 feet (150 meters) to measure the temperatures from 100 years ago and 1,640 feet (500 meters) to measure the temperatures from 1,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/02/17/boreholes.enn/ Environmental News Network staff. "Borehole temperatures confirm global warming."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029185720/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/NATURE/02/17/boreholes.enn/ |date=2009-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boreholes have a great advantage over many other proxies in that no calibration is required: they are actual temperatures. However, they record surface temperature not the near-surface temperature (1.5 meter) used for most "surface" weather observations. These can differ substantially under extreme conditions or when there is surface snow. In practice the effect on borehole temperature is believed to be generally small. A second source of error is contamination of the well by groundwater may affect the temperatures, since the water "carries" more modern temperatures with it. This effect is believed to be generally small, and more applicable at very humid sites.&lt;ref name="Boreholes_in_Glacial_Ice_p80" /&gt; It does not apply in ice cores where the site remains frozen all year.

More than 600 boreholes, on all continents, have been used as proxies for reconstructing surface temperatures.&lt;ref name ="pollack et al" /&gt; The highest concentration of boreholes exist in [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. Their depths of drilling typically range from 200 to greater than 1,000 meters into the [[Crust (geology)|crust]] of the Earth or ice sheet.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"/&gt;

A small number of boreholes have been drilled in the ice sheets; the purity of the ice there permits longer reconstructions. Central Greenland borehole temperatures show "a warming over the last 150 years of approximately 1°C ± 0.2°C preceded by a few centuries of cool conditions. Preceding this was a warm period centered around A.D. 1000, which was warmer than the late 20th century by approximately 1°C." A borehole in the Antarctica icecap shows that the "temperature at A.D. 1 [was] approximately 1°C warmer than the late 20th century".&lt;ref name="Boreholes_in_Glacial_Ice_p81"&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11676&amp;page=81 BOREHOLES IN GLACIAL ICE] Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years (2006), pp 81,82 Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate (BASC), National Academy of Science, {{ISBN|978-0-309-10225-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Borehole temperatures in Greenland were responsible for an important revision to the isotopic temperature reconstruction, revealing that the former assumption that "spatial slope equals temporal slope" was incorrect.

===Corals===
[[File:Bleached Coral.png|thumb|Coral bleached due to changes in ocean water properties]]
[[Ocean]] [[coral]] [[skeletal]] rings, or bands, also share paleoclimatological information, similarly to tree rings. In 2002, a report was published on the findings of Drs. Lisa Greer and Peter Swart, associates of [[University of Miami]] at the time, in regard to [[Isotopes of oxygen|stable oxygen isotopes]] in the [[calcium carbonate]] of coral. Cooler temperatures tend to cause coral to use heavier isotopes in its structure, while warmer temperatures result in more normal [[oxygen isotopes]] being built into the coral structure. Denser water [[salinity]] also tends to contain the heavier isotope. Greer's coral sample from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] was taken in 1994 and dated back to 1935. Greer recalls her conclusions, "When we look at the averaged annual data from 1935 to about 1994, we see it has the shape of a [[sine wave]]. It is periodic and has a significant pattern of [[oxygen isotope]] composition that has a peak at about every twelve to fifteen years." [[Sea surface temperature|Surface water temperatures]] have coincided by also peaking every twelve and a half years. However, since recording this temperature has only been practiced for the last fifty years, correlation between recorded water temperature and coral structure can only be drawn so far back.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/view.php?id=22843 "Coral Layers Good Proxy for Atlantic Climate Cycles."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316220809/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/view.php?id=22843 |date=2010-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollen grains===
Pollen can be found in sediments. Plants produce [[pollen]] in large quantities and it is extremely resistant to decay. It is possible to identify a plant species from its pollen grain. The identified plant community of the area at the relative time from that sediment layer, will provide information about the climatic condition. The abundance of pollen of a given [[vegetation]] period or year depends partly on the weather conditions of the previous months, hence pollen density provides information on short-term climatic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, R. S. and Jones, P. D. (eds) 1992: Climate since AD 1500. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of prehistoric pollen is [[palynology]].

===Dinoflagellate cysts===
[[File:Peridinium ovatum cyst.png|thumb|Cyst of a dinoflagellate ''Peridinium ovatum'']]
Dinoflagellates occur in most aquatic environments and during their life cycle, some species produce highly resistant organic-walled [[Dinocyst|cysts]] for a dormancy period when environmental conditions are not appropriate for growth. Their living depth is relatively shallow (dependent upon light penetration), and closely coupled to diatoms on which they feed. Their distribution patterns in surface waters are closely related to physical characteristics of the water bodies, and nearshore assemblages can also be distinguished from oceanic assemblages. The distribution of dinocysts in sediments has been relatively well documented and has contributed to understanding the average sea-surface conditions that determine the distribution pattern and abundances of the taxa (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=de Vernal|first1=A.|last2=Eynaud|first2=F.|last3=Henry|first3=M.|last4=Hillaire-Marcel|first4=C.|last5=Londeix|first5=L.|last6=Mangin|first6=S.|last7=Matthiessen|first7=J.|last8=Marret|first8=F.|last9=Radi|first9=T.|last10=Rochon|first10=A.|last11=Solignac|first11=S.|last12=Turon|first12=J. -L.|title=Reconstruction of sea-surface conditions at middle to high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) based on dinoflagellate cyst assemblages|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|date=1 April 2005|volume=24|issue=7–9|pages=897–924|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2004.06.014|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379104002112|bibcode=2005QSRv...24..897D}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Lake and ocean sediments===

Similar to their study on other proxies, paleoclimatologists examine [[oxygen isotopes]] in the contents of ocean [[sediments]]. Likewise, they measure the layers of [[varve]] (deposited fine and coarse silt or clay)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/varve "Varve."]&lt;/ref&gt; laminating lake sediments. Lake varves are primarily influenced by:

* Summer temperature, which shows the energy available to melt seasonal snow and ice
* Winter snowfall, which determines the level of disturbance to sediments when melting occurs
* Rainfall&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/068.htm "Climate Change 2001: 2.3.2.1 Palaeoclimate proxy indicators"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091204100159/http://www.grida.no/publications/other/ipcc_tar/?src=%2Fclimate%2Fipcc_tar%2Fwg1%2F068.htm |date=2009-12-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diatom]]s, [[foraminifera]], [[radiolaria]]ns, [[ostracod]]s, and [[Coccolithophore]]s are examples of biotic proxies for lake and ocean conditions that are commonly used to reconstruct past climates. The distribution of the species of these and other aquatic creatures preserved in the sediments are useful proxies. The optimal conditions for species preserved in the sediment act as clues. Researchers use these clues to reveal what the climate and environment was like when the creatures died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/proxies/paleoclimate.html|title=Paleoclimatology: How Can We Infer Past Climates?|last1=Bruckner|first1=Monica|website=Montana State University.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oxygen isotope ratios in their shells can also be used as proxies for temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shemesh|first=A.|last2=Charles|first2=C.

===Water isotopes and temperature reconstruction===
[[File:Climate sensitivity sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide. Hansen et al 2013.png|thumb|335x335px]]
Ocean water is mostly H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O, with small amounts of HD&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O, where D denotes [[deuterium]], i.e. hydrogen with an extra neutron.  In [[Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water]] (VSMOW) the ratio of D to H is 155.76x10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; and O-18 to O-16 is 2005.2x10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;.  [[Isotope fractionation]] occurs during changes between condensed and vapour phases: the vapour pressure of heavier isotopes is lower, so vapour contains relatively more of the lighter isotopes and when the vapour condenses the precipitation preferentially contains heavier isotopes.  The difference from VSMOW is expressed as δ&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O = 1000‰ &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\times \left( \frac{([{}^{18}O]/[{}^{16}O])}{([{}^{18}O]/[{}^{16}O])_{\mathrm{VSMOW}}} - 1\right)&lt;/math&gt;; and a similar formula for δD. δ values for precipitation are always negative.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11676&amp;page=66&lt;/ref&gt;  The major influence on δ is the difference between ocean temperatures where the moisture evaporated and the place where the final precipitation occurred; since ocean temperatures are relatively stable the δ value mostly reflects the temperature where precipitation occurs. Taking into account that the precipitation forms above the [[inversion (meteorology)|inversion]] layer, we are left with a linear relation:

'''δ &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O = aT + b'''

This is empirically calibrated from measurements of temperature and δ as a = 0.67 [[‰]]/°C for [[Greenland]] and 0.76 ‰/°C for East [[Antarctica]].  The calibration was initially done on the basis of ''spatial'' variations in temperature and it was assumed that this corresponded to ''temporal'' variations.&lt;ref&gt;Jouzel and Merlivat, 1984) ''Deuterium and oxygen 18 in precipitation: Modeling of the isotopic effects during snow formation,'' Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres, Volume 89, Issue D7, Pages 11589–11829&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[#Boreholes|borehole thermometry]] has shown that for glacial-interglacial variations, a = 0.33 ‰/°C,&lt;ref&gt;Cuffey et al., 1995, ''Large Arctic temperature change at the Wisconsin–''
Holocene glacial transition,'' Science 270: 455–458''&lt;/ref&gt; implying that glacial-interglacial temperature changes were twice as large as previously believed.

A study published in 2017 called the previous methodology to reconstruct paleo ocean temperatures 100 million years ago into question, suggesting it has been relatively stable during that time, much colder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-10/epfd-tow102317.php|title=The oceans were colder than we thought|date=October 27, 2017|work=Eurekalert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membrane lipids===
A novel climate proxy obtained from [[peat]] ([[lignites]], ancient peat) and soils, [[membrane lipids]] known as [[glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraether]] (GDGT) is helping to study paleo environmental factors, which control relative distribution of differently branched GDGT [[isomers]]. The study authors note, "These branched membrane lipids are produced by an as yet unknown group of anaerobic soil bacteria."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016703706021090|title=Environmental controls on bacterial tetraether membrane lipid distribution in soils|doi=10.1016/j.gca.2006.10.003|journal=Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta|authors=Weijers et al.|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2018}}, there is a decade of research demonstrating that in mineral soils the degree of [[methylation]] of bacteria (brGDGTs), helps to calculate mean annual air temperatures. This proxy method was used to study the [[Climate across Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary|climate of the early Palaeogene]], at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary, and researchers found that annual air temperatures, over land and at mid-latitude, averaged about 23–29 °C (± 4.7 °C), which is 5–10 °C higher than most previous findings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-018-0199-0|doi=10.1038/s41561-018-0199-0|title=High temperatures in the terrestrial mid-latitudes during the early Palaeogene|year=2018|authors=Naafs et al.|journal=Nature Geoscience}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=University of Bristol |title=Ever-increasing CO2 levels could take us back to the tropical climate of Paleogene period |work=ScienceDaily |date=30 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudoproxies===

The skill of algorithms used to combine proxy records into an overall hemispheric temperature reconstruction may be tested using a technique known as "[[pseudoproxy|pseudoproxies]]". In this method, output from a [[climate model]] is sampled at locations corresponding to the known proxy network, and the temperature record produced is compared to the (known) overall temperature of the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

'''Råbjerg Mile''' is a migrating coastal [[dune]] between [[Skagen]] and [[Frederikshavn]], [[Denmark]]. It is the largest moving dune in Northern Europe with an area of around 2&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.4&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and a height of 40&amp;nbsp;m (130&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level.

The dune leaves a low, moist layer of sand behind it, trailing back westwards towards [[Skagerrak]], where the Mile originally formed more than 300 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toppenafdanmark.dk/gb/SkagenAalbaek/Natur/Attraktion100059.aspx|title=Lysets Land|publisher=Toppen af Danmark, Skagen Turistforening|accessdate=25 October 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927143030/http://www.toppenafdanmark.dk/gb/SkagenAalbaek/Natur/Attraktion100059.aspx|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 250,000 people visit the dune every year.&lt;ref name="cc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coastalguide.org/dune/rabjerg.html|title=The mobile dune of Råbjerg Mile, Denmark|work=Coastal Guide on Dune Management|author=Christina Seidenstücker|publisher=European Union for Coastal Conservation|year=2000|accessdate=25 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Skagens_tilsandede_kirke.jpg|left|thumb|210x210px|The Sand-Covered Church was once area's largest church. Now, only the church tower remains.]]

In northern [[Jutland]] in the 16th and 17th centuries shifting dunes were a problem for the population: huge dunes, some stretching up to 7&amp;nbsp;km (4&amp;nbsp;mi) inland, drove them back from the coastal areas, but in the 19th century the government acted to alleviate the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denmark.dk/portal/page?_pageid=374,520409&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|title=The Cultural Landscape|publisher=denmark.dk|accessdate=25 October 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060811223359/http://denmark.dk/portal/page?_pageid=374,520409&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 11 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sand Drift Act of 1857 allowed the state to buy or expropriate areas of sand drift, and a further Act in 1857 allowed the purchase of areas adjacent to the drifts. Dune grasses and conifers were planted to stabilize the sands and these plantations became common after 1880. Although barren, the dune zone allowed limited sheep farming and some inshore fishing. By the 1950s the dune drifts were under control.&lt;ref name="cc" /&gt;

An important example of the power of the migrating sand is the [[Sand-Covered Church]].&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt; Built in the late 14th century and dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence of Rome]], it was almost entirely enveloped in sand by the 18th century. By 1795, the church was abandoned to the sands.&lt;ref name="kirkehistorie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kirkehistorie.dk/hjor/sogn1198.htm|title=Skagen gamle kirke (den tilsandede)|publisher=Danmarks Kirkehistorie|language=Danish|accessdate=9 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main building was demolished, leaving the tower standing, still visible above the sands.

== Conservation ==
[[Image:Råbjerg mile kort.jpg|A map of the Råbjerg mile showing its current position|thumb|right]]
While the majority of dunes were stabilised by planting, the Råbjerg Mile was left to allow future generations to understand the problem of sand dune drift.&lt;ref name="readersnatural" /&gt; The central area of the Mile was purchased by the State in 1900, and after the Conservation of Nature Act in 1917 further surrounding areas were purchased. The dune is drifting out of the government-owned area and discussion over further conservation legislation is taking place.&lt;ref name="cc" /&gt;

The area is an internationally important staging site for migrating [[bird of prey|raptors]] and a breeding site for the [[Eurasian golden plover]] (''Pluvialis apricaria'') and the [[wood sandpiper]] (''Tringa glareola'').&lt;ref name="birds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sites/index.html?action=SitHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=3028&amp;m=0|title= BirdLife IBA Factsheet: Råbjerg Mile and surrounding heathlands|work=BirdLife's online World Bird Database: the site for bird conservation|publisher=BirdLife International|year=2005|accessdate=25 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sinus Roris''' ([[Latin]] for "Bay of Dew") is an extension of the northern edge of [[Oceanus Procellarum]] on the [[Moon]]. The [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]-defined [[selenographic coordinates]] of this bay are 54.0° N, 56.6° W, and the diameter is 202&amp;nbsp;km.

The borders of this feature are somewhat indistinct. The bay proper is framed along the western edge by the craters [[Markov (crater)|Markov]] and [[Oenopides (crater)|Oenopides]], and to the north by [[Babbage (crater)|Babbage]] and [[South (lunar crater)|South]]. At the eastern edge it joins the [[Mare Frigoris]].

Many [[Selenography|selenographers]] have taken liberties with the dimensions of Sinus Roris. Lunar maps often indicate a much larger region for this bay than the official dimensions. These can range out as far as the craters [[Gerard (crater)|Gerard]] and [[Repsold (crater)|Repsold]] to the west, [[Harpalus (crater)|Harpalus]] to the east, and as far south as 44° N [[latitude]], approaching [[Mons Rümker]].

The area where the official coordinates place this bay has a generally higher [[albedo]] than the mare to the south, most likely due to deposits of ejecta from impacts to the north.

Early concepts of a moon landing promoted by [[Wernher von Braun]] envisaged the establishment of a permanent lunar base in the Sinus Roris region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/vonander.htm |title=Von Braun Lunar Lander |publisher=Encyclopedia Astronautica |accessdate=September 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824110143/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/vonander.htm |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts lead, in much modified form, to [[Project Apollo]].

[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s novel ''[[A Fall of Moondust]]'' is set in a fictional "Sea of Thirst" located within Sinus Roris.

'''Stabelhøje''' or Stabel Høje (The Stacked Mounds) are two Bronze Age Mounds 135 meters and 133 meters above sea level by the village [[Agri, Denmark|Agri]] in [[Mols Bjerge]] (Hills of Mols) on the peninsula [[Djursland]] in Denmark at the entrance to The Baltic Sea in Northern Europe. The burial mounds date back to the early Bronze Ages 1800 – 1000 years B.C.&lt;ref name=autogeneret2&gt;Århus Amts og Naturstyrelsens infostander v. højene&lt;/ref&gt; These hills are some of the more known view points in [[Mols Bjerge National Park]]. Other view points in the area are [[Agri Baunehøj]], [[Trehøje]], [[Ellemandsbjerg]] and [[Jernhatten]].

[[File:Stabelhøje udsigt 1.JPG|thumb|250px|left|View from Stabelhøje, south-west, across [[Knebel Vig]] and [[Aarhus Bay]] towards Aarhus and the west coast of Jutland.]]

In the early Bronze Ages tribal leaders and other important members of society where buried in mounds placed in coffins made from hollowed out oak tree trunks. According to archaeological findings the burial customs changed during the Bronze Ages from coffin burials in oak trunks to cremation in the late Danish Bronze Ages. Probably due to international influence caused by long distance trade with commodities such as copper, tin and cattle.&lt;ref name="autogeneret2"/&gt; This change in burial customs is probably also the case at Stabelhøje, that most likely hold several generations of burials from different Bronze Age time periods.

From the top of the mounds there is a view to [[Kalø Castle Ruin]] in [[Egens Bay]] - part of Aarhus Bay, and to the coast of Jutland, with Aarhus, Denmarks second largest town, in the distance. One can also see the hilly fields of southern [[Djursland]], and the unfarmed hills of protected central Mols, including the tallest hill in the area, Agri Baunehøj, 137 meters above sea level. There is also a view of [[Ebeltoft]] Bay, and of the southernmost peninsula on Djursland, [[Helgenæs]]. The difference in elevation is accentuated by views that go all the way down to the surface of the sea.          
 
[[File:Stabelhøje udsigt.JPG|thumb|290px|Flowering thrift at the top of the southernmost Stabelhøje. The vegetation on mounds can be special and varied, caused by a dry and warm south side, and a moist and shady north side.]]

Stabelhøje is accessible via small country roads. There is an infoboard at a small parking lot by the mounds. From here there is a short walk to the top of the southernmost of the two mounds. The mounds are 5 – 6 meters tall. Each is built of up to 650.000 rectangles of turf that where cut out by hand, corresponding to 7 hectares of peeled of heath- and grass-turf per mound.&lt;ref name=autogeneret1&gt;Danmarks Kulturarvs Forening&lt;/ref&gt;
Under influence of rain draining through the surface of the mounds many of the Danish Bronze Age mounds have developed a hard mineral rich layer of soil close to the surface, that isolates the inner mound from contact with water and oxygen from the outside. This lid of hardened soil has helped preserve the artifacts insides the mounds over the centuries.&lt;ref name="autogeneret2"/&gt;

The construction of Bronze Age mounds such as Stabelhøje is an undertaking that involved the work of many people using primitive pre-iron-age tools. A feat that is part of the creation of the 60.000 Stone- and Bronze Age burial mounds registered in Denmark.&lt;ref name="autogeneret1"/&gt; It has been calculated that 100 - 150 mounds where built each year at the height of this endeavor in the early Danish Bronze Ages, 1800 - 500 B.C. Something that points to an organized 2500- to 3800-year-old pre Christian culture pervaded by a unified religious belief.&lt;ref name="autogeneret1"/&gt;

IEEE. {{ISBN|0-7803-3455-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; device family, regulating voltage, power factor, harmonics and stabilizing the system. A static VAR compensator has no significant moving parts (other than internal switchgear).  Prior to the invention of the SVC, power factor compensation was the preserve of large rotating machines such as [[synchronous condenser]]s or switched capacitor banks.&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ryan|first=H.M.|title=High Voltage Engineering and Testing|publisher=IEE|year=2001|pages=160&amp;ndash;161|isbn=978-0-85296-775-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jg1xA65n56oC&amp;pg=PA160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SVC is an automated impedance matching device, designed to bring the system closer to unity [[power factor]]. SVCs are used in two main situations:
* Connected to the power system, to regulate the transmission voltage ("Transmission SVC")
* Connected near large industrial loads, to improve power quality ("Industrial SVC")

In transmission applications, the SVC is used to regulate the grid voltage.  If the power system's reactive load is [[capacitive]] (leading), the SVC will use [[thyristor controlled reactor]]s to consume [[Volt-ampere reactive|VARs]] from the system, lowering the system voltage. Under [[inductance|inductive]] (lagging) conditions, the capacitor banks are automatically switched in, thus providing a higher system voltage. By connecting the thyristor-controlled reactor, which is continuously variable, along with a capacitor bank step, the net result is continuously variable leading or lagging power.

In industrial applications, SVCs are typically placed near high and rapidly varying loads, such as [[arc furnace]]s, where they can smooth [[power quality|flicker voltage]].&lt;ref name="PPDI" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arrillaga,|first=J.|author2=Watson, N. R. |title=Power System Harmonics|publisher=Wiley|pages=126|isbn=978-0-470-85129-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1h9aqRj4o8EC&amp;pg=PA126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

===Principle===
Typically, an SVC comprises one or more banks of fixed or switched shunt [[capacitor]]s or [[inductor|reactors]], of which at least one bank is switched by thyristors.   Elements which may be used to make an SVC typically include:
*[[Thyristor controlled reactor]] (TCR), where the reactor may be air- or iron-cored
*[[Thyristor switched capacitor]] (TSC)
*Harmonic filter(s)
*Mechanically switched capacitors or reactors (switched by a [[circuit breaker]])

[[File:Static VAR Compensator 2a.png|center|thumb|560px|[[One-line diagram]] of a typical SVC configuration; here employing a [[thyristor controlled reactor]], a [[thyristor switched capacitor]], a harmonic filter, a mechanically switched capacitor and a mechanically switched reactor]]

By means of phase angle modulation switched by the thyristors, the reactor may be variably switched into the circuit and so provide a continuously variable [[AC power|VAR]] injection (or absorption) to the electrical network.&lt;ref name="Deb" /&gt; In this configuration, coarse [[Potential difference|voltage]] control is provided by the capacitors; the thyristor-controlled reactor is to provide smooth control. Smoother control and more flexibility can be provided with thyristor-controlled capacitor switching.&lt;ref name="Padiyar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Padiyar|first=K. R.|title=Analysis of Subsynchronous Resonance in Power Systems|publisher=Springer|year=1998|pages=169&amp;ndash;177 |isbn=978-0-7923-8319-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMSELoMjsg0C&amp;pg=PA169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thyristors are electronically controlled. Thyristors, like all semiconductors, generate  heat and [[deionized water]] is commonly used to cool them.&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt; Chopping reactive load into the circuit in this manner injects undesirable odd-order [[harmonic]]s and so banks of high-power [[Electronic filter|filters]] are usually provided to smooth the waveform. Since the filters themselves are capacitive, they also export MVARs to the power system.

More complex arrangements are practical where precise voltage regulation is required. Voltage regulation is provided by means of a [[Feedback|closed-loop]] controller.&lt;ref name="Padiyar" /&gt; Remote [[SCADA|supervisory control]] and manual adjustment of the voltage set-point are also common.

=== Connection ===
Generally, static VAR compensation is not done at line voltage; a bank of [[transformer]]s steps the transmission voltage (for example, 230 kV) down to a much lower level (for example, 9.0 kV).&lt;ref name="Ryan" /&gt; This reduces the size and number of components needed in the SVC, although the conductors must be very large to handle the high currents associated with the lower voltage.   In some static VAR compensators for industrial applications such as [[electric arc furnace]]s, where there may be an existing medium-voltage busbar present (for example at 33 kV or 34.5 kV), the static VAR compensator may be directly connected in order to save the cost of the transformer.

Another common connection point for SVC is on the delta tertiary winding of Y-connected auto-transformers used to connect one transmission voltage to another voltage.

The dynamic nature of the SVC lies in the use of [[thyristor]]s connected in series and inverse-parallel, forming "thyristor valves"). The disc-shaped semiconductors, usually several inches in diameter, are usually located indoors in a "valve house".

== Advantages ==
The main advantage of SVCs over simple mechanically switched compensation schemes is their near-instantaneous response to changes in the system voltage.&lt;ref name="Padiyar" /&gt; For this reason they are often operated at close to their zero-point in order to maximize the reactive power correction they can rapidly provide when required.

They are, in general, cheaper, higher-capacity, faster and more reliable than dynamic compensation schemes such as synchronous condensers.&lt;ref name="Padiyar" /&gt;  However, static VAR compensators are more expensive than mechanically switched capacitors, so many system operators use a combination of the two technologies (sometimes in the same installation), using the static VAR compensator to provide support for fast changes and the mechanically switched capacitors to provide steady-state VARs.

}}'''''The New Dinosaurs: An Alternative Evolution''''' is a 1988 [[speculative evolution]] book written by Scottish geologist [[Dougal Dixon]] and illustrated by several illustrators including Amanda Barlow, [[Peter Barrett (illustrator)|Peter Barrett]], John Butler, Jeane Colville, Anthony Duke, Andy Farmer, Lee Gibbons, Steve Holden, Philip Hood, Martin Knowelden, Sean Milne, [[Denys Ovenden]] and Joyce Tuhill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Dinosaurs|last=Dixon|first=Dougal|publisher=Salem House|year=1988|isbn=978-0881623017|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also features a foreword by [[Desmond Morris]]. ''The New Dinosaurs'' explores a hypothetical alternate [[Earth]], complete with animals and ecosystems, where the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] never occurred, leaving [[non-avian dinosaurs]] and other [[Mesozoic]] animals an additional 65 million years to [[Evolution|evolve]] and adapt over the course of the [[Cenozoic]] to the present day. 

''The New Dinosaurs'' is Dixon's second work on speculative evolution, following ''[[After Man]]'' (1981), which explored the animals of a hypothetical world 50 million years in the future where humanity had gone extinct. ''After Man'' used a fictional setting and hypothetical animals to explain the natural processes behind evolution whilst ''The New Dinosaurs'' uses its own fictional setting and hypothetical wildlife to explain the concept of [[zoogeography]] and [[Biogeographic realm|biogeographic realms]]. It was followed by another speculative evolution work by Dixon in 1990, ''[[Man After Man]]'', which focused on a hypothetical future path of evolution of [[Human|humanity]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/tetrapod-zoology/of-after-man-the-new-dinosaurs-and-greenworld-an-interview-with-dougal-dixon/|title=Of After Man, The New Dinosaurs and Greenworld: an interview with Dougal Dixon|last=Naish|first=Darren|work=Scientific American Blog Network|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Dougal Dixon's hypothetical dinosaurs bear a coincidental resemblance to dinosaurs that were eventually discovered. As a general example, many of Dixon's fictional dinosaurs are depicted with feathers, something that was not yet widely accepted when the book was written.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/slideshow/alternative-evolution-dinosaurs-foresaw-contemporary-paleo/|title="Alternative Evolution" of Dinosaurs Foresaw Contemporary Paleo Finds [Slide Show]|last=|first=|date=|website=www.scientificamerican.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
''The New Dinosaurs'' explores [[Earth]] and its [[fauna]] in the present day (contrary to Dixon's other [[speculative evolution]] books ''[[After Man]]'' and ''[[Man After Man]]'', both set in the future) as it would have been if the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event]] never occurred. Over the course of the [[Tertiary]] period and since the [[Last glacial period|last Ice Age]], several specialized descendants of various [[Mesozoic]] groups, in particular the [[Dinosaur|dinosaurs]], [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] and [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]], have evolved. Dixon explores these new animals through [[Biogeographic realm|biogeographic realms]], divisions of the Earth's land surface based on distributional patterns of animals and other lifeforms.

The forests of the [[Ethiopian realm]] ([[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]) are home to several "abrosaurs", a group of small tree-climbing [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurian]] [[Theropoda|theropods]], including a wasp-eating variety. In the [[savanna]], huge striding and terrestrial pterosaurs such as the [[giraffe]]-like "lank" are present whilst the deserts are home to coelurosaurs adapted to a lifestyle of effectively "swimming" through the sand and hunting small arthropods. On the island of [[Madagascar]], some dinosaurs are highly similar to Mesozoic ones, such as [[Titanosaur|titanosaurs]] and modern representatives of the genus ''[[Megalosaurus]]''.

In the temperate climates of the [[Palearctic realm]] ([[Eurasia]] with the exception of Arabia, [[Southeast Asia|South-East Asia]] and [[India]]) there are small and [[Colony (biology)|colonial]] [[Pachycephalosauria|pachycephalosaurs]] and the "bricket", a fuzzy [[Hadrosaurid|hadrosaur]] whose brightly colored tail can act as a warning signal. Predators include the "jinx", a [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurid]] adapted to mimic larger herbivorous dinosaurs through scent and appearance. In the deserts of the south, large [[Ankylosauria|ankylosaurs]] such as the "taranter" have adapted their ancestral armor to also function as a means to conserve moisture. In the far north, large migratory birds such as the "tromble" with legs almost like tree trunks, roam the land.

In the [[Nearctic realm]] ([[North America]]), most herbivores are members of the family Sprintosauridae, referred to as "sprintosaurs", descendants of the Mesozoic hadrosaurs adapted to a new lifestyle on the grass-covered plains. Also present on the plains are predatory dromaeosaurids and the "monocorn", a large and slow-moving [[Ceratopsidae|ceratopsid]]. The mixed woodlands and wetlands are home to bipedal and fishing pterosaurs superficially similar to [[Heron|herons]] and the "springe", a large-brained descendant of ''[[Stenonychosaurus]]'' that has adapted an [[Ambush predator|ambush-hunting strategy]] where it mimics being dead to attract scavengers that it can kill and eat.

The tropical rainforests of the [[Neotropical realm]] ([[South America]] and southern North America) are home to amphibious [[Hypsilophodont|hypsilophodonts]] as well as highly specialized abrosaurs such as a [[pangolin]]-like form and a variety that feeds on [[nectar]]. Sauropods descended from the titanosaurs are present on the [[pampas]] [[Grassland|grasslands]], such as the heavily armored "turtosaur" and the trunked "lumber". The apex predator of the pampas, the "cutlasstooth", has evolved huge, cutting teeth to allow it to prey upon the large sauropods. The pampas is also home to the last of the [[Tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]], the large scavenging "gourmand".

The smallest biogeographic realm, the [[Oriental realm]] (South-East Asia and India) contains diverse environments and animals, such as the great "rajaphants" of the plains, massive sauropods living in herds, and [[bamboo]]-eating hypsilophodonts. In the swamps, there are aquatic hypsilophodonts that have [[Convergent evolution|evolved convergently]] with the amphibious hypsilophodonts of the Neotropical realm and pterosaurs using their wings as traps to lure in fish.

The [[Australasian realm]] ([[Oceania]]) is the most isolated and self-contained. In the scrub and tall grass savanna there are [[flamingo]]-like coelurosaurs and [[Iguanodontia|iguanodonts]] capable of jumping like [[Kangaroo|kangaroos]]. There are also tree-living and herbivorous hypsilophodonts, superficially similar to the abrosaurs of the rest of the world, and terrestrial, [[Frugivore|fruit-eating]] pterosaurs that have completely lost their wings. The tropical islands surrounding [[Australia]] are home to the "coconut grab", an [[ammonite]] capable of spending more time on land than its ancestors and feeding on coconuts, which it sometimes climbs trees to get to.

The world's [[Ocean|oceans]] are home to various pterosaurs, such as [[seagull]]-like and [[penguin]]-like forms. There is also the "whulk", a massive whale-like [[Pliosauroidea|pliosaur]] that feeds exclusively on [[plankton]]. The "kraken", an enormous ammonite, uses specialized tentacles to entangle and sting anything that comes near it. 

== Development ==
Following the success of his previous speculative evolution book ''After Man'' in 1981, Dixon realized that there was a market for popular-level books which use fictional examples and settings to explain actual factual scientific processes. ''After Man'' had explained the process of evolution by creating a complex hypothetical future ecosystem, ''The New Dinosaurs'' was instead aimed at creating a book on zoogeography, a subject the general public was quite unfamiliar with, by using a fictional world in which the non-avian dinosaurs had not gone extinct to explain the process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The dinosaurs and other animals in ''The New Dinosaurs'' were heavily influenced by the [[paleontology]] of its time. The ideas of the [[Dinosaur renaissance|Dinosaur Renaissance]] - replacing the older ideas of dinosaurs as dumb and slow creatures with active, agile and bird-like animals are heavily used in the book.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Dixon extrapolated on the ideas of paleontologists such as [[Robert T. Bakker|Robert Bakker]] and [[Gregory S. Paul|Greg Paul]] when creating his creatures and also used patterns seen in the actual evolutionary history of the dinosaurs and pushing them to an extreme, such as with the creation of the "gourmand", an armless and massive scavenger descended from the tyrannosaurids.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Legacy ===
Many of the hypothetical animals created for ''The New Dinosaurs'' ended up resembling actual Mesozoic creatures that have since been discovered.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of the hypothetical dinosaurs featured in the book are covered in fuzzy integument, which in modern times have been discovered in dinosaurs of most groups. The tree-climbing abrosaurs are similar to actual tree-climbing small theropods such as ''[[Microraptor]]'' (described in 2000) and the large terrestrial pterosaurs, such as the "lank", resemble some animals in the actual pterosaur group [[Azhdarchidae]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Trehøje''' is a Danish vista point with a view of the sea to the east, south and west, located in the [[Mols Bjerge National Park]] on the peninsula [[Djursland]] between Denmark and Sweden. Three large bronze-age barrows close to each other 127 meters above the sea, have given their name to the place, which contains a group of 22 barrows. "Trehøje" meaning three mounds, is one of four major vista points in the hills of Mols, each with a barrow on top. The others are [[Ellemandsbjerg]], [[Stabelhøje]] and [[Agri Baunehøj]].&lt;ref name="autogeneret2"&gt;Danmarks Kulturarvs Forening&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trehøje Udsigt 6.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Goats, sheep, cattle and horses diminish tree growth at Trehøje.]]

The view from Trehøje includes the east coast of mainland Jutland, the islands Samsø, Tunø and Hjelm, plus the hilly Mols Bjerge landscape, including the peninsula [[Helgenæs]]. One can also see parts of southern Djursland and the towns of [[Aarhus]] and [[Ebeltoft]] in the distance. From the three barrows one can look down onto the bays of [[Knebel, Denmark|Knebel]], [[Begtrup]], [[Aarhus]], and [[Ebeltoft]], as well as the southern stretches of the [[Kattegat]], the sea between [[Denmark]] and [[Sweden]].

The three barrows are five to six meters high, each made of about 650,000 pieces of dug-out grass turf. This is equivalent to 7 hectares of land where the turf has been peeled off for each barrow. A labor-intensive undertaking, that was part of the erection of 60,000 bronze-age mounds registered in Denmark. It has been calculated that in Denmark 100 to 150 mounds were built per year in the early Bronze Age (1800–1000 BC). This effort points towards a strong, homogenous and organized religious quest in a distant pre-Christian civilization.&lt;ref name="autogeneret2"/&gt;

The vegetation in the open land surrounding Trehøje predominantly consists of bent grass. A slender type of grass that forms a wavy red and violet surface in July and August, and stands out as a golden surface in the winter sun, dotted with darker mulberry bushes. Here and there one might be able to make out the remains of narrow 8–15-meters-wide curved fields from the Middle Ages. These fields emerged when the farmers predominantly plowed the furrows towards the center of the field. Maybe with the purpose of creating a contour that drains standing water to the sides of the fields.&lt;ref name=autogeneret3&gt;Naturstyrelsen.dk&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Trehøje Udsigt 1.JPG|thumb|250px|left|Winter view Trehøje, south-west towards Begtrup Bay, Aarhus Bay and Aarhus]]

Today focused landscaping underlies the formation of the open plain-like grassland surrounding Trehøje, as well as other parts of the protected Mols Bjerge Hills. Tree growth, which would otherwise take over the land, is kept down partly through grazing by sheep, goats, cattle and horses, and partly through felling of upcoming trees, as well as felling of established wooded areas.

A nutrient-poor common-like landscape is a landscaping goal for the area. This type of landscape occurred naturally in the Middle Ages, probably due to intensive grazing and repeated haymaking on the commons, combined with not bringing back the same amount of nutrients in the form of manure, as was taken away, according to a theory. In some descriptions of the formation of the depleted vegetation around Trehøje there is no mention of the wind-erosion factor, which can blow away fertile topsoil nutrients – even though this has been a determining depletion-factor for surrounding land on Djursland in the Middle Ages.

[[File:Trehøje Udsigt 8.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Spring view from Trehøje, south, over Ebeltoft Bay and Kattegat]]
One of the ideas behind favoring a common-like landscape is to make the Hills of Mols resemble the woodless tundra-plains left over, when the ice sheets drew back from the land after the last ice age plus 10,000 years ago, before Denmark became covered with forest. An other purpose behind this landscaping goal is to create habitats for zoology, not least insects, that are rare in other parts of Denmark. In addition the wood-free open countryside is visitor friendly, giving opportunities for walks and biking on the paths and gravel roads surrounding Trehøje, as well as in the rest of hilly Mols Bjerge.

'''''Tunnel in the Sky''''' is a juvenile [[science fiction]] novel  by American writer [[Robert A. Heinlein]], published in 1955 by [[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]] as one of the [[Heinlein juveniles]]. The story describes a group of students sent on a survival test to an uninhabited planet, who soon realise they are stranded there. The [[theme (literature)|themes]] of the work include the difficulties of growing up and the nature of man as a social animal.

==Plot summary==

The novel is set in the future, when [[Malthusian catastrophe|Malthusian overpopulation]] on Earth has been averted by the invention of [[teleportation]], called the "[[interstellar teleporter|Ramsbotham jump]]", which is used to send Earth's excess population to colonize other planets. However, the costs of operating the device mean that the colonies are isolated from Earth until they can produce something to justify two-way trade. Because modern technology requires a supporting infrastructure, the colonists employ technology from the frontier era — horses instead of tractors.

Rod Walker is a high school student who dreams of becoming a professional colonist. The final test of his Advanced Survival class is to stay alive on an unfamiliar planet for between two and ten days. Students may team up and equip themselves with whatever gear they can carry, but are otherwise completely on their own. They are told only that the challenges are neither insurmountable nor unreasonable. On test day, each student walks through the Ramsbotham portal and finds him or herself alone on a strange planet, though reasonably close to the pickup point. Rod, acting on his older sister's advice, takes hunting knives and basic survival gear rather than high-tech weaponry, on the grounds that the latter could make him over-confident. The last advice the students receive is to "watch out for stobor."

On the second day, Rod is ambushed and knocked unconscious by a thief. When he wakes up, all he has left is a spare knife hidden under a bandage. In his desperate concentration on survival, he loses track of time. Eventually he teams up with Jacqueline "Jack" Daudet, a student from another class whom he initially mistakes for a male. When she tells him that more than ten days have elapsed without contact, he realizes that something has gone wrong with the portal that was supposed to recover them, and they are stranded.

They start recruiting others to build a settlement for long term survival and Rod becomes the ''de facto'' leader of a community that eventually grows to around 75 people.  Disagreements reveal the need to elect a government for the new town.    Rod has no taste for politics or administration, and is happy to have Grant Cowper, an older college student and born politician, elected mayor. Grant proves to be much better at talking than getting things done.  Despite disagreeing with many of Grant's policies, Rod supports him.  Grant ignores Rod's warning that they are living in a dangerously hard-to-defend location and that they should move to a cave system he has found. When a species previously thought harmless suddenly changes its behavior and stampedes through their camp, the settlement is devastated and Grant is killed. Rod is put back in charge.

Heinlein tracks the social development of this frontier community of educated Westerners deprived of technology, followed by its abrupt dissolution when contact with Earth is reestablished. After nearly two years of isolation, the [[culture shock]] experienced by the survivors highlights for them and the reader the pain and uncertainty of becoming an adult, by reversing the process abruptly—Each of the students goes from being a self-responsible member of an autonomous community back to being regarded as a youth.

All of the students go back to Earth willingly except for Rod, who has great difficulty reverting from the status of head of a small, but sovereign state to a teenager casually brushed aside by the adult rescuers. However, his teacher (and now brother-in-law) and his sister persuade him to change his mind. His teacher also informs Rod that his warning against "stobor" ("robots" spelled backwards) was just a way of personalizing the dangers of an unknown planet - to instill fear and caution in the students, as every student receives the same warning no matter which planet he or she is sent to for the final exam.

Years later, Rod is briefly depicted accomplishing his heart's desire; the novel's ending finds him preparing to lead a formal colonization party to another planet.

==Themes==
As in ''[[Lord of the Flies]]'', which had been published a year earlier, isolation reveals the true natures of the students as individuals, but it also demonstrates some of the constants of human existence as a social animal. Its underlying themes run counter to those in ''Lord of the Flies'', however, in that it shows a belief in the inherent strength of humans as proto-adults who can self-organize rather than descend into barbarism. Some of the students fall victim to their own foolishness, and others turn out to be thugs, but that is a part of human nature, just as the counter-trends take the group as a whole towards the beginnings of a stable society. The numerous political crises of the fledgling colony illustrate the need for legitimacy in a government appropriate for the society it administers, another common theme in Heinlein's books. In both its romanticization of the [[settler|pioneer]] and its glorification of ''Homo sapiens'' as the toughest player in the [[Darwinism|Darwinian]] game, it presages themes developed further in books like ''[[Time Enough for Love]]'' and ''[[Starship Troopers]]''. Unusual for science fiction at the time, but quite typical of Heinlein's works, the novel portrays several competent and intelligent female characters.&lt;ref&gt;James, Edward and [[Farah Mendlesohn]] (2003). ''The Cambridge Companion to Science Fiction''. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-01657-6}}. p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rod's ethnicity==
[[Heinlein Society]] member and researcher Robert James has noted that Heinlein wrote a letter in which he "firmly states" that Rod Walker is black.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;Robert James, PhD., quoted in the [http://www.heinleinsociety.org/rah/faqworks.html Heinlein Society's Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt; According to James, "The most telling evidence is that everybody in 'Tunnel' expects Rod to end up with Caroline, who is explicitly described as black."&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt; In recognition of this, the cover illustration of a Full Cast Audio version of the work was revised to "show Rod with his correct ethnicity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.heinleinprize.com/2011/07/rod-walker-as-heinlein-intended |title=Rod Walker, as Heinlein Intended |author=Deb Houdek Rule |publisher=[[Heinlein Prize for Advances in Space Commercialization|Heinlein Prize Trust]] (via archive.org) |accessdate=September 24, 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622132410/https://www.heinleinprize.com/2011/07/rod-walker-as-heinlein-intended |archivedate=June 22, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rod is at one point referred to by character Jock McGowan as a "cholo", a derogatory term for someone of [[Latin American]] ancestry.

==Chinese conquest of Australia==

In the early chapters of the book, it is disclosed that at some time prior to the invention of teleportation, China conquered and colonized Australia, survivors of the original population (evidently here referring to both White Australians and Aborigines) being relocated to New Zealand. It is mentioned that the Chinese managed a giant irrigation project making the central desert of Australia into a flourishing garden - and a generation later it became an overcrowded slum. In the present of the novel, poor Chinese peasants are forcibly relocated to marginal planets which nobody else wants.

The '''Vienna Conference''' was the first international conference on [[ozone layer depletion]]. It was held in [[Vienna, Austria]] in 1985 when a hole in the stratospheric ozone layer was observed in the South Pole marked by increased UV-B infiltration over Antarctica. A 'hole', marked by significant drop in ozone molecules in the layer, as large as that of United States was discovered by a British team.  The [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]] was agreed at the conference and it entered into force in 1987.
