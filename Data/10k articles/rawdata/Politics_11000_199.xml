A series of mass protests were held in [[Armenia]] in the wake of the [[Armenian presidential election, 2008|Armenian presidential election]] of 19 February 2008. Mass protests against alleged electoral fraud were held in the capital city of [[Yerevan]] and organised by supporters of the unsuccessful presidential candidate and first President of the Republic of Armenia, [[Levon Ter-Petrosyan]].

The protests began on 20 February, lasted for 10 days in [[Freedom Square, Yerevan|Yerevan's Freedom Square]], and involved tens of thousands of demonstrators during the day and hundreds camping out overnight. Despite the urges of the government to stop the demonstrations, the protests continued until 1 March. After nine days of peaceful protests at the Freedom Square, the national police and military forces tried to disperse the protesters on 1 March.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1265025&amp;Site=CommDH&amp;BackColorInternet=FEC65B&amp;BackColorIntranet=FEC65B&amp;BackColorLogged=FFC679 "Report by the Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Thomas Hammarberg, on his special mission to Armenia, 12–15 march 2008"], Council of Europe, 20 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of 1 March, police and army units dispersed the 700–1,000 persons who remained overnight, beating them with truncheons and [[Electroshock weapon|electric-shock devices]].&lt;ref name="ArmNowMar1Noon"&gt;[http://www.armenianow.com "Protestor on scene tells of melee"], ArmeniaNow.com, 1 March 2008 (noon){{Dubious|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HRW1"&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/03/02/armeni18189.htm "Armenia: Police Beat Peaceful Protesters in Yerevan"], [[Human Rights Watch]] (NY), 2 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar1a"&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/FFAB3C6D-A75D-4E48-B0D6-5D3A83069160.ASP Ter-Petrosyan ‘Under House Arrest,’ Rally Broken Up] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081123052730/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/FFAB3C6D-A75D-4E48-B0D6-5D3A83069160.ASP |date=23 November 2008 }}, [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 1 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, 10 people were killed.

At noon on 1 March, a crowd of at least 10,000 protesters held a rally in front of the {{ill|French embassy, Yerevan|fr|Ambassade de France en Arménie}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenianow.com/ "Crowd near French Embassy grows to tens of thousands or more"], ArmeniaNow.com, 1 March 2008 (4&amp;nbsp;pm).&lt;/ref&gt; Police officers pulled away from the area by 16:00, as they were overwhelmed by the growing number of demonstrators. Activists then used abandoned police buses to set up barricades. In the evening, clashes broke out between riot police and about 2,000 protesters who barricaded themselves at Miasnikyan Square. At around 22:00, President [[Robert Kocharyan]], with the approval of the Armenian parliament, declared a 20-day [[state of emergency]], banning future demonstrations and censoring the media from broadcasting any political news except those issued by official state press releases.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar2a"&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/8D6FD2D9-C798-4BF4-8307-1F434344FFC9.ASP At Least Eight Killed In Armenian Post-Election Unrest"], Armenia Liberty ([RFE/RL]), 2 March 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316191611/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/8D6FD2D9-C798-4BF4-8307-1F434344FFC9.ASP |date=16 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kocharian justified the decision on the grounds that a minority of demonstrators looted a nearby grocery store on [[Mashtots Avenue]] and set fire to a handful of police vehicles and buses&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar2a"/&gt; (while the riot police, special forces and army looked on from 1&amp;nbsp;km away from Shahumyan Square without intervening).{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Opposition leaders say that the looters had nothing to do with the demonstration, and that they were led by ''[[agent provocateur]]s''. With the state of emergency in effect, at around 4:00 on 2 March, Levon Ter-Petrosyan asked the protesters near the French Embassy to go home, thus ending the protests.&lt;ref name="HRW1"/&gt;

The tragic events of 1 March 2008 are simply referred to as ''Marti mek'' ({{lang-hy|Մարտի մեկ}} "March First") in Armenia.

==Background==
Levon Ter-Petrosyan was the President of Armenia from 16 October 1991 to 3 February 1998. Ter-Petrosyan was forced to step down in February 1998 for a number of reasons, including allegations of election fraud and generally having lost support in the parliament. He was succeeded by his then Prime Minister [[Robert Kocharyan]]. Kocharyan was re-elected for a second term as president on 5 March 2003 amid allegations of electoral fraud. In early 2004 there were demonstrations by opposition-led protestors and calls for Kocharyan's resignation. Kocharyan completed his second term as president on February 2008 and under the [[Constitution of Armenia|Armenian constitution]] was not eligible for a third term. Kocharyan's Prime Minister [[Serge Sargsyan]] had Kocharyan's backing for his candidacy as the next president. Ter-Petrosyan was also a candidate for this election, having announced his candidacy during a speech in Yerevan on 26 October 2007, in which he accused Kocharyan's government of massive corruption involving the theft of "at least three to four billion dollars" over the previous five years.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Danielian and Liz Fuller, [http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2007/11/fc64b5fb-efac-4463-8e9f-13b3d6fd1714.html "Armenian Ex-President Confirms Comeback Plans"], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 1 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The election was held on 19 February 2008 and Sargsyan won the election with 53% of the vote, according to official results, with Ter-Petrosyan in second place with 22% of the vote. Under Armenia's electoral law, if neither candidate wins at least 50% of the votes, the top two contenders have to face each other in a second round of the elections. International observers from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe|PACE]] and the [[European Parliament]] had said that "the presidential election in Armenia mostly satisfied the international standards".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regnum.ru/english/armenia/960206.html International observers: Armenian presidential election mostly in accordance with international standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015221958/http://www.regnum.ru/english/armenia/960206.html |date=15 October 2008 }} [[REGNUM News Agency|Regnum]], 20 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
The protests began on 20 February; about 25,000 opposition supporters were reportedly present on 21 February. Ter-Petrosyan said that the army would not act against the protesters, claiming to have the support of two deputy defense ministers. An aide to Ter-Petrosyan vowed that the protests would continue "nonstop" and demanded that the government agree to holding a new election by 22 February.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/21/europe/EU-POL-Armenia-Presidential-Election.php "Thousands challenge victory of Armenian PM in presidential vote in 2nd day of protests"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), 21 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February, two members of the Central Election Commission who are representatives of the opposition said that they did not accept the results, and on the next day, [[Vahan Hovhannisian]] resigned from his position as deputy speaker of [[National Assembly of Armenia]] due to his disapproval of the handling of the election and said that the mechanism of falsifications were put in operation in 1996 by Ter-Petrosyan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=25117|title=RA parliament accepts Vahan Hovhannisian resignation|work=PanARMENIAN.Net|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests continued on 22 February, and Deputy Prosecutor-General Gagik Jhangirian condemned the election, urging the people to act immediately to defend their votes, rather than complaining later about the government's behavior. A spokesperson for Prosecutor-General Aghvan Hovsepian asked Kocharyan to dismiss Jhangirian because prosecutors cannot be members of any party or to be involved in politics in any way&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=25013|title=RA Prosecutor General petitioned President for Jahangiryan dismissal|work=PanARMENIAN.Net|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Defense Ministry denied Ter-Petrosyan's claim that the two deputy defense ministers had said that they would prevent the army from being used against the protesters, but the veterans' group [[Yerkrapah]] disputed this denial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2008/2/1D78A652-B265-46BE-827B-BCFC795D998E.html "Armenia: Opposition Protests Gain Momentum With High-Ranking Support"], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 22 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests were held without an official permission.&lt;ref name=Warns&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7251983.stm |work=BBC News |title=Armenian leader warns protesters |date=24 February 2008 |first=Matthew |last=Collin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the cause for the protest were oppositions claim that there were widespread violations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/AP/story/428323.html "Protesters challenge Armenian vote"], Associated Press (MiamiHerald.com), 21 February 2008. {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the suppression of this belief. [[Armenian Public Television]] (H1) has received criticism for failing to show the intense protesting, instead promoting a peaceful aura following the election.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

===22 February===
On the third day of the protests, 22 February, the number of protesters was reported as about 30,000. Sarkisyan called the protests "blackmail' and said that if they violated the law, order would be restored through force. The opposition's [[Alexander Arzoumanian]], however, said that the government did not have the courage to attempt to break up the protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7259553.stm |work=BBC News |title=Thousands occupy Armenia square |date=22 February 2008 |first=Matthew |last=Collin}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 February, the number of protesters was reported as about 50,000. Kocharyan accused the opposition of trying to seize power and warned that the government would act to preserve order.&lt;ref name=Warns/&gt; Meanwhile, the police released a statement saying that they were "prepared to resolutely respond to any attempts to disturb public order and destabilize the situation, prevent extremist manifestations, and protect people's constitutional rights".

Jhangirian was dismissed as Deputy Prosecutor-General by Kocharyan on 23 February and detained later that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=25030 "Gagik Jahangiryan dismissed from post of deputy prosecutor general"], PanARMENIAN.Net, 23 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 February Gagik Jahangiryan was arrested and accused of violating the article 235.1 of the Armenia Penal Code (illegal purchase, traffic and storage of weapons, explosive assemblies) and article 316.1 (application of force against a public agent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panarmenian.net/news/eng/?nid=25103 "Former deputy prosecutor general accused of illegal storage of weapons and violence against public agent"] PanARMENIAN.Net, 27 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===25 February===
25 February saw steady numbers of protesters at Opera Square during the day, estimated at 40,000–50,000.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Ter-Petrosyan made several appearances, and in each called for a peaceful rally, frequently alluding to the late-1980s when the [[Karabakh Committee]] was arrested by the Soviets. Ter-Petrosyan said that he does not fear arrest nor assassination, and that if the ruling party had him killed, it would only accelerate its own demise. Also on 25 February, Sarkis Hatspanian, a diasporan Armenian from France, spoke twice, and alluded to the participation of Armenians in revolutionary movements in France and Germany, and how the turn has come for Armenia. Around 10–15,000 people continued to participate in the rally well into midnight, some staying overnight in tents.

===26 February===
On 26 February, there were widespread reports that high school administrators had been directed by the ruling party to have their students participate in a pro-Sargsyan rally held in Republic Square. Many e-mail services had been blocked since the morning of 26 February, including Hotmail, Gmail, and thick-client email programs using the IMAP protocol.

Several prominent supporters of Ter-Petrosyan were arrested on 26 February. On that day competing rallies were held, with Sargysan's supporters reported to number up to 100,000. Ter-Petrosyan claimed that the numbers attending his rally had doubled because people were leaving Sargysan's rally to come to his. Meanwhile, the National Security Service said that it had prevented an opposition plot to seize a television broadcasting tower in Yerevan; it said that the purpose of this alleged plot, for which several people were arrested, was to enable Ter-Petrosyan to make a live broadcast. An opposition spokesman dismissed this as "psychological pressure". Also on 26 February, Kocharyan suggested that his government's patience with the protests had "a limit" and urged people to "come to their senses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/02/26/europe/EU-GEN-Armenia-Election-Protest.php "Armenian police detain more activists as gov't, opposition supporters hold dueling rallies"], Associated Press (''International Herald Tribune''), 26 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===27 February===
On 27 February, an even larger group of protesters than previous days marched on the streets along Abovian and Mashdots Avenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a1plus.am/en/?page=issue&amp;iid=58468 "Ralliers 'Thanked' the Police"], A1+, 27 February 2008.{{Dubious|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evening again saw protester numbers in the tens of thousands, with an increasing number of tents. The crowd was mixed, there were groups of villagers (tens in each), students, families with children, government workers, in addition to opposition leaders. At around 11:30&amp;nbsp;pm some protesters started to rush towards the café adjacent to Freedom Square named "Karapi Lij" (Swan Lake). A protest leader announced that all available journalists should go there to photograph "something interesting" that was about to happen, and also called for the general populace to return to the square. Several score of military police, civil police, as well as secret police went into the subterranean café, emerging after 15–20&amp;nbsp;minutes with 3 arrested suspects who were secret ''agent provocateurs'' with undercover recording equipment trying to get opposition leaders (who were in the café) to say or perform illegal acts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a1plus.am/amu/?page=issue&amp;iid=58477 "ԲՌՆԵԼ ԵՆ ՊՐՈՎՈԿԱՏՈՐՆԵՐԻ"], A1+, 28 February 2008.{{Dubious|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia's National Security Service (NSS) acknowledged that the agents urging the opposition leaders to resort to violence were its employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/02/3E1DDCBC-7733-491B-9FD3-C134120D9633.asp "Ex-KGB Admits Sending Agents To Opposition Rally"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306145337/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/02/3E1DDCBC-7733-491B-9FD3-C134120D9633.asp |date=6 March 2008 }}, [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 28 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Secret police (which outnumbered uniformed police and military 3 to 1) would not allow journalists to take pictures, however some were able to (despite their threats of impending danger to journalists' personal safety or destruction of their cameras). The rally later continued without interruption.

===28 February===
On 28 February, starting from the morning, police cars surrounded the streets around Freedom Square, not allowing passengers to be dropped off or picked up, let alone to park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.a1plus.am/en/?page=issue&amp;iid=58485 "Cars Are Taken Away"], A1+, 28 February 2008.{{Dubious|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===29 February===
On 29 February, another march around town attracted an even larger group of ralliers, with at least 100,000 participants. At night, there were 132 tents set up in Freedom Square and occupied by 24-hour protesters.

===1 March===

On 1 March, at 7:30&amp;nbsp;am, Armenian security forces violently dispersed the protesters, who were then reported to number about 700–1,000,&lt;ref name="ArmNowMar1Noon"/&gt; and broke up a tented camp being used by the protesters in Freedom Square. Witnesses say that the government authorities planted guns and grenades among the sleeping protesters, and then claiming that they were thwarting an attempted coup, attacked the protesters.&lt;ref name="NYTimesMar7"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/07/opinion/07fri2.html |work=The New York Times |title=Dark Days in Armenia |date=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ArmeniaNowMar21a"&gt;[http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=2900&amp;lng=eng&amp;IID=1179 Bloody Saturday: A breakdown of the day that broke a nation], ArmeniaNow.com, 21 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Police used bludgeons and electric shockers to beat and electrocute the ralliers.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar1a"/&gt; Levon Ter-Petrosyan was captured at Freedom Square and placed under house arrest. Some fled when police attacked them.&lt;ref name="HRW1"/&gt; Dozens were reported to have sustained severe injuries and more than 100 protesters were arrested.&lt;ref name="HRW1"/&gt; A witness told Human Rights Watch that several rows of Special Forces in riot armor, with helmets, plastic shields and rubber truncheons, started approaching from the left and right sides of Freedom Square. The witness said that police, without prior warning, sprayed water and descended on the demonstrators, using rubber truncheons and electric prods. "People started running towards Northern Avenue, but were chased by the police."&lt;ref name="HRW1"/&gt;
By 11:00&amp;nbsp;am, Freedom Square was completely cordoned off by police and large water cannons were being used to clear the site of debris and blood (with riot police trying to prevent passersby from taking photographs). The Karapi Lich café was cordoned off with a large canvas so that it could not be seen what took place inside.

At about 11:30&amp;nbsp;am, a peaceful march of about 1,000 people from near Freedom Square, down North Avenue, and to the French Embassy at Miyasnikyan Square (where riot police were quickly redeployed to). By 1:30&amp;nbsp;pm, a police armored personnel carrier was brought in, which the growing crowd quickly surrounded. By 2&amp;nbsp;pm, about 150,000 protesters—larger than on any other day—had gathered in the square. By that time there were about 3,000 riot police and special police forces present. The sheer number of protesters outnumbered the police, who were forced by the peaceful protesters to retreat. By 5&amp;nbsp;pm, all armored personnel carriers and all other military special vehicles as well as troops had been evacuated from the square. Protesters gradually confiscated the remaining buses and moved them to strategic locations to block incoming traffic to the square. It is notable that several ''agent provocateurs'' were detected by the crowd and swiftly removed. At around 3:30&amp;nbsp;pm, an unmarked white police car drove straight through the crowd at high speed. At least two women were run over and taken to hospital with injuries. The car was stopped by the crowd and set afire, as the policeman driving it fled the scene.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/3623EA9C-98D2-4DCA-9113-3072E07677F3.ASP "Yerevan Protests Resume Despite Government Crackdown"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304113439/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/3623EA9C-98D2-4DCA-9113-3072E07677F3.ASP |date=4 March 2008 }}, [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 2 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm, at least 30 buses, each with about 30 army soldiers armed with AK-47 and M-16 assault rifles, were seen near Republic Square (in anticipation of Kocharian's state of emergency).

Around 10:30&amp;nbsp;pm, Kocharyan declared a 20-day state of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-03-01-armenia-elections_N.htm |work=USA Today |title=Armenia declares state of emergency |date=1 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that "all rallies and other public gatherings will be banned in Yerevan until March 20.

Clashes between the police and security forces and agitated protesters seem to have occurred on at least three occasions during the course of 1 March:&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt; The first in the morning hours, the second at around 9:15&amp;nbsp;pm, and the third late night. According to eyewitnesses (among them an RFE/RL correspondent) security forces—without prior warning—fired [[Tracer ammunition|tracer bullets]] over the crowd for more than 40&amp;nbsp;minutes in an attempt to disperse the crowd&lt;ref name="RFERLJune27-08a"&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/06/1259EEEF-280A-4F0E-9B1B-6CEB56B26137.ASP "Sarkisian Defends Use Of Force Against Opposition"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015225231/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/06/1259EEEF-280A-4F0E-9B1B-6CEB56B26137.ASP |date=15 October 2008 }}, [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]], 27 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (this is confirmed in an independent YouTube video). In the meantime, a unit of riot troops charged towards one of the barricades but fled the scene after unsuccessful pitched battles with opposition supporters who were armed with sticks, stones and [[Molotov cocktail]]s.&lt;ref name="RFERLJune27-08a"/&gt;

Shortly after the event, a controversial independent video appeared on YouTube showing special forces firing automatic weapons directly into the crowd, directly followed by a clip in which the Prosecutor General's press secretary (Sona Truzyan) claims that police did not fire any weapons into the crowd. Government sources claimed that the video footage was faked and that it was digitally doctored.

===2 March===

====Midnight and early morning====
By 12:00&amp;nbsp;am, the area around the French embassy had only about 5,000 activists left. The police stood about 1/2&amp;nbsp;km north at Shahumyan Square, passively watching as anarchy reigned on the area below. Miyasnikyan square to Mashdots Avenue was completely devoid of any law enforcement, and authorities watched passively as some of the crowd looted some stores. Despite calls from opposition leaders throughout the demonstrations to restrain the use of violence, some in the crowd (allegedly encouraged by ''[[agent provocateur]]s''&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar2a"/&gt;) resorted to property destruction (of cars, windows, public places) and looting of a grocery store and a shoe store.&lt;ref name="ArmeniaNowMar21a"/&gt; (ArmeniaNow reports that the 2 pharmacies and 4 electronics and computer stores were not looted.&lt;ref name="ArmeniaNowMar21a"/&gt;) By 1:00&amp;nbsp;am, several buses and cars had been destroyed, set ablaze, or turned over near Miyasnikyan square. By 2:30&amp;nbsp;am, some of the bus loads of army soldiers were bused into Shahumyan square to join rows of riot police. Demonstrators were seen armed with metal bars (removed from park gates) and Molotov cocktails made from water bottles.

Many of the demonstrators were not there to specifically support Levon Ter-Petrosyan, but were there to show their support for a change in government. Only a minority of the group resorted to looting, and most of the crowd stayed within the vicinity of Miyasnikyan Square.

Official reports say that ten people died on the night of 1 March;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=47070 Death toll in March 1–2 clashes in Yerevan reaches 10 ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930022148/http://en.apa.az/news.php?id=47070 |date=30 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to representatives of non-governmental organizations, the official number of injured civilians may be underreported, as several of those injured were turned away from hospitals and medical clinics on 1 March.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt; According to the information given by the Head of Police and Prosecutor General, a police officer died trying to prevent a hand grenade from going off. Three civilians died from teargas cartridge and four from bullets. The Prosecutor General stated that the ammunitions had penetrated the bodies, which appears to indicate that they must have been fired at a very close range.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

According to the Head of Police some protesters were armed with wooden sticks, iron sticks and "hedgehogs". He also stated that the protesters used fire arms – but this was contested by the representatives of the opposition who met with the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

====Day time====
As of 9&amp;nbsp;am, Ter-Petrosyan urged his supporters to go home from the protest, citing Kocharian's state of emergency. The government alleged that protesters were carrying firearms. However, other than metal bars and some Molotov cocktails, no reporters had seen arms in the possession of protesters.&lt;ref name="RFERLMar2End" /&gt;

By 11&amp;nbsp;am, at least a dozen army armored personnel carriers and about 500 soldiers wielding assault rifles were positioned in Republic Square, maintaining the state of emergency's policy of a ban on public demonstrations and meetings. The stage at Freedom Square has been surrounded by 6 army transportation trucks. Photography was strictly prohibited.

Yerevan was said to be all but a ghost town, with soldiers outnumbering citizens.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

The National Assembly confirmed Kocharyan's state of emergency, with 81 of the 131 members of parliament present voting in favor of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2008/03/7D25D2BD-9268-4233-A631-BF5F29FD5BCE.html "Armenia: Eight Killed After Clashes Between Police, Protesters"], Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, 2 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the end of the state of emergency, thousands of people in Yerevan held a candlelight vigil for the victims of 1 March and a silent protest on 21 March 2008 to protest the 106 protesters who had been arrested in the original protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7308860.stm |work=BBC News |title=Armenian opposition stage protest |date=21 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HetqMar22"&gt;[http://hetq.am/eng/politics/7853/ "A Candlelight Vigil and Silent Protest Procession"], Hetq Online, 22 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Their plan was to assemble at Freedom Square at 3&amp;nbsp;pm and hold a candlelight vigil there for those who died on 1 March, followed by a silent protest from 5&amp;nbsp;pm to 7&amp;nbsp;pm of a single line stretching from Freedom Square, down Northern Avenue, to Myasnikian Square.&lt;ref name="HetqMar22"/&gt; However, riot police confronted the protesters and used force to disperse them.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar21a"&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/6B313019-A13B-430A-A03E-EB19AC9C7C29.ASP "Protests Resume In Yerevan Amid Heavy Security"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), 21 March 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080324192229/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/6B313019-A13B-430A-A03E-EB19AC9C7C29.ASP |date=24 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior police officers told protesters to leave the area and cross the streets surrounding it, citing a continuing government ban on rallies.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar21a"/&gt; "Ten people standing together means a rally, and I have the right to disperse a rally," Major-General Sasha Afian, deputy chief of Armenia's Police Service, told a group of angry women.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar21a"/&gt;

Freedom Square was occupied by busloads of police and interior troops who prevented citizens to enter Freedom Square;&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar21a"/&gt; Shahumyan Square and Myasnikian Square similarly had rows of riot police who prevented a public assembly in the area.&lt;ref name="HetqMar22"/&gt; At 7&amp;nbsp;p.m. the assembled crowds of silent protesters dispersed as planned.&lt;ref name="HetqMar22"/&gt; Although the state of emergency has been lifted by law, the ban on public rallies is de facto still in place.

On the same day, the following campaign team members of Levon Ter-Petrosyan were taken into custody: Vardan Galstyan, Davit Tzaghikyan, Onik Hakobyan, Suren Sujyan, Edvard Sarajanyan and Hakob Semirjyan.&lt;ref name="HetqMar22"/&gt;

===22 March===
Riot police continue to block public access to Freedom Square, Shahumyan Square, and Myasnikian Square; they were also in formation at Republic Square. Police dispersed a growing crowd—mostly composed of women—that was assembling at Northern Avenue. A Reuters reporter was notified by the police that any attempt by the public to hold a similar "silent protest" as the day before would be met by resistance from the police.

==State of Emergency==
Late in the evening on 1 March, President Kocharian declared a State of Emergency in the capital Yerevan for twenty days. The National Parliament endorsed the Presidential decree on Declaration of state of emergency the following day, 2 March. The State of Emergency entered into force immediately. The decree established the following temporary limitations under the State of Emergency:&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;
* It banned meeting, rallies, demonstrations, marches and other mass events;
* It banned strikes and other actions that could stop or suspend the activities of organizations;
* It limited the movement of individuals and the means of transportation and authorized inspections by the law enforcement bodies;
* It stipulates that mass media outlets could provide information on state and internal affairs only within the parameters of official information provided by state bodies;
* It banned political propaganda through leaflets or other means without due permission from relevant state bodies;
* It suspended temporarily the activity of political parties and other public organizations that impede the elimination of the circumstances that served as the grounds for declaring a State of Emergency;
* It authorized the removal from a given area those who violate the legal state of emergency regime and do not reside there, doing so at their own expense, or, in case of absence of means, using state budget resources to be refunded afterwards.

===Ban on public gatherings===
The Armenian military is maintaining a strict ban on public gatherings of even the smallest size.

===Media censorship===
Under the state of emergency, mass media can only publish official government news.

Several opposition media have been shut down, including ''A1plus'' and ''Haykakan Zhamanak''.

[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]'s Armenia Liberty radio service has been terminated by the Armenian authorities. The radio service's airings were at first accessible from their website at http://www.armenialiberty.org, but since 6 March even this website has been blocked by the Armenian government.

The [[President Elect]] Sargsian, during his meeting with EU special envoy for the South Caucasus [[Peter Semneby]], said "We are ready to cooperate with all those who wants Armenia to develop, its citizens to prosper, the country to be stable and strong, and we are ready for an open, straightforward and honest discussion". He also said that "those who incited recent riots had committed a crime and should be punished". The Incumbent President Kocharian said that "Armenian authorities were seeking to normalise the situation as soon as possible and restore stability".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081016104126/http://www.itar-tass.com/eng/level2.html?NewsID=12442184&amp;PageNum=0 Armenian authorities conduct talks on cooperation with opposition – Sarkisyan] [[Information Telegraph Agency of Russia]], 3 March 2008 {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New law banning rallies===
The President and the Prime Minister expressed their wish to have the State of Emergency ended on 21 March. They were however concerned over the possibility of new demonstrations, rallies and riots in the streets. In this context, on 17 March, the Parliament initiated a first reading of proposed amendments to the law on holding meetings, rallies, marches, and demonstrations in an extraordinary session.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

On 18 March, President Robert Kocharian signed into law a parliament bill that will make it easier for the Armenian authorities to ban fresh anti-government demonstrations planned by opposition leader Levon Ter-Petrosyan.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar18a"&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/0EDC9A1F-46FD-4919-B0FF-FECD4D1607EB.ASP "Government Signals Ban On Ter-Petrosyan Rallies"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), 18 March 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080322011603/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/0EDC9A1F-46FD-4919-B0FF-FECD4D1607EB.ASP |date=22 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existing law had until then allowed authorities to ban those demonstrations which they believed were aimed, among other things, at a "violent overthrow of constitutional order." One of the amendments of the new law complements the clause with cases where authorities have "reliable information" that street protests would pose a threat to "state security, public order, public health and morality," and that any such information coming from the Armenian police and the National Security Service (NSS) will be automatically deemed "reliable."&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar18a"/&gt;

Also, a more significant amendment to the existing law allows the authorities to "temporarily" ban rallies for an unspecified period of time after street gatherings resulting in casualties. The ban shall remain in force until the end of the official investigation into a particular case of deadly street violence.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar18a"/&gt; Furthermore, the amendments also stipulate that a responsible agency examine a request for holding a public event for 72 hours. Requests are to be submitted 5 days prior to the date of holding a public event.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

According to the Council of Europe, these amendments entail "important changes and serious restrictions on the current national regime of freedom of assembly." Previously the municipal authorities only needed to be notified of the intent to hold rallies, demonstrations or manifestations. According to the Council of Europe, the amendments full conformity with [[European Convention on Human Rights#Article 11 - right to freedom of assembly and association|article 11 paragraph 2]] (the right to freedom of assembly and association) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention]] can be questioned.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

In addition to Sarkisian's [[Republican Party of Armenia|Republican Party]] (HHK), parliamentary leaders of the [[Prosperous Armenia]], [[Dashnaktsutyun]] and [[Rule of Law (Armenia)|Orinats Yerkir]] parties supported the new bill; Only members of [[Zharangutyun]], the sole opposition party represented in the parliament, and independent lawmaker Victor Dallakian voted against the legislation.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar18a"/&gt;

==Response of coalition government parties==
[[Artur Baghdasarian]], leader of the [[Rule of Law (Armenia)|Rule of Law party]] and former opposition leader who switched sides after the election,&lt;ref name="ArmNowMar21f"&gt;[http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;AID=2893&amp;lng=eng&amp;IID=1179 From “traitor” to Secretary: The curious ups and downs of Artur Baghdasaryan], ArmeniaNow.com, 21 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gagik Tsarukian]], leader of the [[Prosperous Armenia Party]] made a joint statement with Sarkisian where they blamed the deadly clashes on Ter-Petrosyan, claiming that they had been "methodically and cruelly" planned by Ter-Petrosyan beforehand as part of his plan to illegally seize power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/C1358A35-354B-4F18-A630-125670EE1200.ASP Baghdasarian Blames Ter-Petrosyan For Unrest] Armenianlibery.org 4 March 2008  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308174133/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/C1358A35-354B-4F18-A630-125670EE1200.ASP |date=8 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 3 March statement, the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] defended the deadly use of force against thousands of Ter-Petrosyan supporters who demonstrated in Yerevan on 1 March and called the protest an attempted coup d'état.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar19c"&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/9AE10A2D-06ED-4CDD-9F43-57CB60DC0600.ASP "Dashnaks Call For ‘National Unity’ Government"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), 19 March 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080323232730/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/9AE10A2D-06ED-4CDD-9F43-57CB60DC0600.ASP |date=23 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition response==
Opposition leaders who organized the rally disavowed and condemned 1 March's looting of dozens of a nearby supermarket and burning of parked cars, blaming them on government "provocateurs."&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar2a"/&gt; "We have nothing to do with that," said [[Nikol Pashinian]], an opposition leader. "The authorities themselves are destabilizing the situation."&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar2a"/&gt;

During his 11 March news conference, Ter-Petrosyan alleged that government agents provoked the unrest. "Not even one car had been scratched [during protests and marches] prior to March 1. So what happened?" Ter-Petrosyan said, according to a report distributed by the Regnum news agency. "Provocateurs went after the protesters with clubs. … That was the reason the situation spiraled out of control, although it was brilliantly managed by authorities."&lt;ref name="EurasiaNetMar13"/&gt;

During the weekend of 15–16 March, Ter-Petrosyan and his opposition allies remaining at large held a meeting for the first time since the 1 March government attack, and said they will continue to work for regime change in Armenia by "legal and democratic means."&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar17a"&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/3EFA0A17-5263-4C70-942C-829FE124FFB7.ASP "Ter-Petrosyan, Allies Discuss Next Steps"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), 17 March 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419151023/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/3EFA0A17-5263-4C70-942C-829FE124FFB7.ASP |date=19 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ter-Petrosyan's office said that the participants of the meeting "reaffirmed their determination to fight against the [[kleptocracy|kleptocratic]] system."&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar17a"/&gt; During the week of 10 March, the Ter-Petrosyan's representatives requested permission from Yerevan mayor's office to hold a rally on 21 March (the day after the anticipated end of emergency rule); this request has been rejected.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar17a"/&gt;

[[Raffi Hovannisian]]'s [[Heritage (Armenia)|Zharangutyun party]] said in a statement that "the schism between the Armenian people and its government continues to expand," that the presidential ballot was fraudulent and that Armenians had a legitimate right to dispute its official results in the streets. It said the 1 March bloodshed resulted from the break-up of non-stop protests in Yerevan's Freedom Square staged by the Ter-Petrosyan camp.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar17a"/&gt; "The unconscionability displayed on February 19 and the brutality used to protect it on March 1 remain unresolved issues," said the statement. "No state of emergency, accompanied as it is by an aggressive, one-sided 'public information' vertical which deepens the public divide rather than healing it, will succeed in securing the collective amnesia of state and society."&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar17a"/&gt;

===Response to new law banning rallies===
On 18 March, Levon Ter-Petrosyan rejected as unconstitutional the new amendments to Armenia's law (passed at an emergency session of the National Assembly on 17 March) that will make it easier for authorities to ban new anti-government demonstrations.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar18a"/&gt; In a statement, his office said that the enacted amendments "blatantly violate" Armenians' constitutionally guaranteed freedom of assembly and can therefore be ignored by citizens.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar18a"/&gt; "In these circumstances, it is the people's legitimate right to ignore the illegal ban and reaffirm their freedom to hold rallies which is guaranteed by the constitution and international law."&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar18a"/&gt; "In reality, this is an attempt to perpetuate the state of emergency," Levon Zurabian, an aide to Ter-Petrosyan, told RFE/RL. "A regime which attacked peaceful demonstrators and whose illegal actions left many people dead is using its own crime as a pretext to restrict our people's right to hold peaceful rallies... This shows that the authorities are terrified by the existing situation and that they admit having no popular support"&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar18a"/&gt;

== Response of media ==
ArmeniaNow has announced that it will remain under a [[media blackout]] until the State of Emergency has been suspended, because it feels that the "latest changes in Yerevan's State of Emergency still leave wide control and leeway for media censorship which has already been exercised in state restrictions of newspapers on the first day of the revised provisions."&lt;ref name="ArmNow"&gt;[http://www.armenianow.com Armenia Now], 14 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reaction==
The [[European Union]] and some Western governments have demanded from the Armenian government a lifting of the 20-day state of emergency.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar6b"/&gt;

On 2 March, Holly Cartner, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch said in a statement: "The Armenian government should refrain from using violence and make clear that it won’t tolerate excessive use of force by police... A political crisis doesn’t give the government carte blanche in how it responds to demonstrators."&lt;ref name="HRW1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar2a"/&gt; "The Armenian government prides itself on having a democratic image," said Cartner. "Beating peaceful demonstrators is inconsistent with that image and violates its obligations under human rights law."&lt;ref name="HRW1"/&gt; In a second statement, Cartner said, "The Armenian government should swiftly investigate whether the police and army used lethal force against protesters in accordance with international standards. While the government has a duty to maintain civic order, lethal force may only be used when strictly necessary to protect life."&lt;ref name="HRW2"&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2008/03/02/armeni18190.htm "Armenia: Civilians Die as Police Suppress Demonstrations and Riots"], [[Human Rights Watch]], 2 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 March, the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] said that Armenian authorities "should immediately lift restrictions on independent news reporting and the censorship of independent news Web sites." "We're alarmed by this blatant attempt to censor news of the disputed election," CPJ Executive Director Joel Simon said. "We call on Armenian authorities to withdraw the ban on independent news gathering and dissemination, and restore access to independent and opposition media."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpj.org/news/2008/europe/armenia03mar08na.html "ARMENIA: Restrictions imposed as president declares emergency"], [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], 3 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 March, the [[Broadcasting Board of Governors]] (BBG), which oversees all non-military U.S. international broadcasting, said it "strongly objects to the blackout of independent media in Armenia." "Censorship and harassment of the media are the antithesis of democracy," said James K. Glassman, Chairman of the BBG.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbg.gov/_bbg_news.cfm?articleID=158&amp;mode=general "Statement of the Broadcasting Board of Governors on Closure of Independent Media in Armenia"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015171034/http://www.bbg.gov/_bbg_news.cfm?articleID=158&amp;mode=general |date=15 October 2008 }}, Broadcasting Board of Governors, 5 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 March, Kurt Volker, the US acting assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, said in an interview with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty: "We don't believe that [a] further crackdown, further arrests, are the right way to go." He went on to urge the immediate lifting of the state of emergency imposed by Kocharian on 1 March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/armenia08/news/031108.shtml "Armenia: Authorities Advance Conspiracy Theory"], Armenia: Vote 2008 (Eurasianet.org), 11 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his 13 March trip to Armenia, Thomas Hammarberg, the [[Council of Europe]]'s visiting commissioner for human rights, said "I am concerned about the human rights situation in Armenia and the consequences of the declaration of the state of emergency... It is urgent to restore a situation where the activities of the media, political parties and non-governmental organisations are not hindered."&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar13b"/&gt;

On 12 March, the [[European Union]] reiterated its calls for the Armenian authorities to lift the state of emergency in Yerevan, release all political prisoners and agree to an "independent investigation" into the country's deadly post-election unrest.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar13c"&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/F51B8727-39E0-49C1-AF24-8B3C04322AF8.ASP "EU Concerned About Armenian Crackdown"], Armenia Liberty ([[RFE/RL]]), 13 March 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419162841/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/F51B8727-39E0-49C1-AF24-8B3C04322AF8.ASP |date=19 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government of [[Slovenia]], holder of the EU's rotating presidency, also said on behalf of the block, "The Presidency calls again upon the Armenian authorities to release citizens detained in connection with their political activities and to refrain from further arrests of opposition leaders."&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar13c"/&gt;

On 14 March, [[Thomas Hammarberg]], the Council of Europe's [[Commissioner for Human Rights]], called for an independent investigation into Armenia's deadly post-election unrest and said opposition supporters arrested by the authorities in recent weeks have been ill-treated in custody. "There have been cases where there were problems... Some of those arrested have been beaten, which of course is not acceptable" he said after his meetings in Armenian prisons of the political prisoners. Hammarberg "appeared to have serious misgivings about the official version of events." "I really think that there is a need for a professional, independent and impartial inquiry into what happened," he said, adding that it should be conducted by special commission made up of individuals "trusted by the public." Hammarberg also told Kocharian and Sarkisian that the recent day's easing of civil liberty restrictions stemming from the state of emergency in Yerevan is "not sufficient" and specifically urged them to abolish "censorship" of the Armenian media.&lt;ref name="ArmLibMar16c"&gt;[http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/033CAEF0-41B0-4542-832B-897C29E92000.ASP "Armenian Oppositionists ‘Tortured In Jail’"], Armenia Liberty [[RFE/RL]], 14 March 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316193113/http://www.armenialiberty.org/armeniareport/report/en/2008/03/033CAEF0-41B0-4542-832B-897C29E92000.ASP |date=16 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March, after a 3-day visit to Armenia, [[Thomas Hammarberg]] called on the Armenian government to lift emergency measures, ensure media freedom and initiate an impartial investigation into recent violent acts. "The State of Emergency should be lifted in Armenia and an independent, impartial and transparent inquiry initiated to clarify what actually happened during the confrontations in Yerevan between the police and opposition demonstrators on 1 March," he said.&lt;ref name="COEAMMar19"&gt;[http://www.coe.am/en/?go=pressreleases&amp;id=401 "Commissioner Hammarberg calls on the Armenian government to lift emergency measures, ensure media freedom and initiate an impartial investigation into recent violent acts"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531152824/http://www.coe.am/en/?go=pressreleases&amp;id=401 |date=31 May 2011 }}, [[Council of Europe]] [http://www.coe.am Information Office in Armenia], 18 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March, the Council of Europe's [[Commissioner for Human Rights]] released a report summarizing his findings during his 12–15 March trip to Armenia. The report is critical of the government's abuse of force, stating, "It seems clear that excessive use of force was used by police and the security forces." According to the report the two sides—government authorities and opposition protesters—describe the events of 1 March "very differently." Since it is important in a human rights perspective to establish the basic facts, the report calls for a "comprehensive inquiry" that is "independent, impartial and transparent and perceived as credible by the whole population." Also, it criticized the behavior of riot police, stating, "A review seems necessary of the current riot control measures used by the police as serious mistakes were made."&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Armenian Presidential Elections 2008 Protest Mar 21 - Opera Square general view.jpg|thumb|Since 2 March, riot police and army occupy and block access to Freedom Square as well as to other major squares in Yerevan]]
The Armenian police arrested 30 protestors accusing them of starting the riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/05/world/europe/05briefs-opposition.html?ref=world |work=The New York Times |title=Armenia: Opposition Arrests After Unrest |date=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian Medical Centre (the former Republican hospital) treated civilians which had concussions from the beating by the police in connection with arrest. A number of them claimed to have been persons only passing by the demonstration. One patient had been hit by a bullet which had perforated his jaw and he could not speak. Another civilian could not be visited as he was in severe condition and held in reanimation.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

Several civilians who had sought medical assistance following the riots of 1 March had been denied assistance or turned down by the some hospitals. Also, it happened that patients released from the hospitals had been immediately arrested.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

At least 106 members of the opposition have been arrested, and Levon Ter-Petrosyan has been under ''de facto'' house arrest since 1 March.

===Arrests===
According to article 130 of the Criminal Procedures Code, a person can be held for twenty-four hours without charges. Over 400 persons have been apprehended and asked to give testimony of the events on 1 March.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

On 13 March the Prosecutor General informed that over 95 persons had been arrested for having organized or participated in demonstrations and mass disturbances of public order. Information provided by non-governmental sources on 15 March stated that an additional 50 persons had been arrested, mostly outside of Yerevan in major cities of Armenia like Gyumri.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

===Police brutality===
According to the Council of Europe Commissioner of Human Rights, [[Thomas Hammarberg]] who visited a number of detainees in Nubarashen Prison, the Temporary holding facility of the National Security Service and the Holding Centre of Yerevan City Police Department, "the number of injured persons and detainees still after fourteen days showing marks of beating is clearly a matter of grave concern." The Commissioner has stated that allegations of [[police brutality]] should be investigated.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

This is the first day after the removal of the official state of emergency. However, a new amendment to Armenia's law passed by parliament allows the authorities to more easily ban new rallies.

===Easter Sunday, 23 March===
Being Easter Sunday, there was no organized demonstration on this day. Busloads of special forces, riot police, and military continued their illegal occupation of Freedom Square, preventing Armenian citizens of expressing their constitutional right to free assembly. As a member of the [[Council of Europe]], the Armenian authorities are violating Article 11 (freedom of assembly and association) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], to which Armenia is a signatory.&lt;ref name="COEReportMar20"/&gt;

{{Politics of Ukraine}}
The '''2008 Ukrainian political crisis''' started after [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yushchenko]]'s [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc]] (NU-NS) withdrew from the governing coalition following a vote on a bill (4 September 2008) to limit the President's powers in which the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]]'s [[Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko]] (BYuT) voted with the opposition [[Party of Regions]]. The bill would have required the consent of the Prime Minister for the appointment and dismissal of the [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine|Prosecutor General]] by the President, given the government power to appoint local heads of government if the President rejects the candidates,&lt;ref name="zik.com.ua"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zik.com.ua/en/news/2008/09/04/148874|title=Rada clipping Yushchenko’s wings by reassigning prosecutor general and heads of oblast and city administrations|publisher=Western Information Agency|date=4 September 2008|accessdate=11 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080920080029/http://zik.com.ua/en/news/2008/09/04/148874| archivedate= 20 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; stripped from the President the right to reject a candidate for Prime Minister, dismiss the Defense, Interior and Foreign Ministers, and appoint a head of the State Intelligence Service.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg /&gt; President Yushchenko stated that a clear position on the [[2008 South Ossetia war|events in Georgia]] was one of the conditions under which return to talks in the [[Ukrainian Parliament|Parliament]] was possible, as well as the repeal of all the constitutional laws adopted after 3 September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/11198.html|title=President names conditions for resolution of situation in the VR|publisher=Press office of President Victor Yushchenko|date=5 September 2008|accessdate=5 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920113147/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/11198.html|archivedate=20 September 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yushchenko claimed that a "de-facto coalition" was formed with 'no other aims but to conduct coup d'état and usurp power in the country'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/11271.html|title=The new de-facto coalition was an attempt of coup d'etat – President|publisher=Press office of President Victor Yushchenko|date=11 September 2008|accessdate=11 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915032745/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/11271.html|archivedate=15 September 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tymoshenko stated that the real intentions behind the President's party in 'declaring war on her' was to ensure his victory in the next presidential election, although she still called for a reformation of the coalition between the two parties.&lt;ref name="news.xinhuanet.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/04/content_9772001.htm|title=What fuels fresh political crisis in Ukraine|publisher=Xinhua|date=4 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080907193317/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/04/content_9772001.htm| archivedate= 7 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also reiterated her position on the Georgian conflict, claiming to be neutral and more in line with the EU.&lt;ref name=Time/&gt;

[[Yuri Lutsenko]] leader of [[Civil Movement "People's Self-Defense"]] (part of the [[Our Ukraine–People's Self-Defense Bloc]]) said that the breakup of the coalition was provoked by the Secretariat of the President and that "People’s Self Defense" was categorically against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-273398.html|title=Lutsenko is not about to send in his resignation|publisher=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]]|date=17 September 2008|accessdate=17 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080918100054/http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-273398.html| archivedate= 18 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign media reported that the political crisis was sparked by the [[2008 South Ossetia War|armed conflict between Russia and Georgia]] that started in early August 2008 and began with a dispute between President [[Viktor Yushchenko]] and Prime Minister [[Yulia Tymoshenko]] over Ukraine's reaction to that conflict. The President gave his support for Georgia and strong criticism of Russia whereas other parties professed more balanced positions towards the two parties of that conflict. On 16 September, the collapse of the BYuT/NU-NS coalition was officially announced.&lt;ref name="afp.google.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtUOmlRyOSVtaxRetvox2V-OZ_fQ|title=Ukraine's pro-Western coalition collapses: speaker|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=16 September 2008|accessdate=16 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916205510/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jtUOmlRyOSVtaxRetvox2V-OZ_fQ|archivedate=16 September 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the failure to re-create the coalition, the Ukrainian parliament was dissolved by president Yushchenko on 8 October 2008, giving way to the [[Ukrainian parliamentary election, 2008|third parliamentary election in three years]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ukraine gets third election in three years |publisher=[[Radio Netherlands]] |date=8 October 2008 |url=http://www.radionetherlands.nl/news/international/5999526/Ukraine-gets-third-election-in-three-years |accessdate=8 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20081011032654/http://www.radionetherlands.nl/news/international/5999526/Ukraine-gets-third-election-in-three-years |archivedate=11 October 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poland’s former President [[Aleksander Kwaśniewski]] stated dismissing [[Verkhovna Rada]], Yushchenko "shot himself in the foot. There was a chance to create a wide democratic coalition of BYUT, NUNS and the Lytvyn bloc, and we were working on it. Pres Yushchenko 'may suffer a substantial pratfall'.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://zik.com.ua/en/news/2008/10/09/152848 zik.com.ua, Yushchenko shoots himself in the foot – Aleksander Kwasniewski]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the conflict between Russia and Georgia, Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko issued a decree requiring advance notice of the movements of the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]] into and out of the Ukrainian port of [[Sevastopol]]. He also came out strongly in support of [[President of Georgia|Georgia's President]] [[Mikheil Saakashvili]], condemning Russia's attacks within Georgia. Tymoshenko and her bloc put forward a less critical position towards Russia and the Prime Minister herself was out of public view during much of the conflict. On 18 August 2008 Yushchenko's office accused the Prime Minister of taking a softer position as a way to win the support of Russia during the 2010 Presidential election. Andriy Kyslynskyi, the president's deputy chief of staff, said Tymoshenko's actions showed "signs of high treason and political corruption" adding that documents supporting these allegations were being handed over to prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/ukraine-pm-accused-high-treason-georgia/article-174801?Ref=RSS |title=Ukraine PM accused of 'high treason' over Georgia |publisher=EurActiv |date=20 August 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920121724/http://www.euractiv.com/en/enlargement/ukraine-pm-accused-high-treason-georgia/article-174801?Ref=RSS |archivedate=20 September 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tymoshenko denied the accusations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jXHYKgM3583Rlhsa_hYLkIo5nBSA|title=Ukraine PM rejects traitor accusations: report|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=20 August 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921010516/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jXHYKgM3583Rlhsa_hYLkIo5nBSA|archivedate=21 September 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rejected the accusation that she was soft in her support for Georgia, saying that she supported the "sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia" but she does not agree with the president’s tough stance on the Black Sea Ports and defends her position as being "in line with the European Union and not to drag Ukraine into conflicts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.intv-inter.net/downloads/pdf/newsletter/BYuT_Inform_Newsletter_Issue_84.pdf |format=PDF |title=Newsletter for the international community providing views and analysis from the Bloc of Yulia Tymoshenko (BYuT) |publisher=[[Bloc Yulia Tymoshenko]] |date=8 September 2008 |accessdate=8 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029054137/http://www.intv-inter.net/downloads/pdf/newsletter/BYuT_Inform_Newsletter_Issue_84.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andriy Semchenko, an MP from the Tymoshenko bloc, called on the President and the head of the President's Secretariat Viktor Baloha to apologize to the PM before there could be constructive work in the coalition. He said it was not appropriate for the President and Baloha to spread information that Tymoshenko was a traitor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2008/09/02/172052.html|title=BYuT demands Yushchenko and Baloha to apologize to Tymoshenko|publisher=forUm|date=2 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903012115/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2008/09/02/172052.html|archivedate=3 September 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coalition collapses ==
On 1 September 2008 Prime Minister Tymoshenko put forward draft legislation which would facilitate the procedure for impeachment, though she insisted it would not affect President Yushchenko and was meant for future presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-270322.html|title=Tymoshenko "calms down" Baloha saying his chief must not be concerned|publisher=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]]|date=1 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080914183607/http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-270322.html| archivedate= 14 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the legislation came to a vote two days later, Tymoshenko's bloc voted together with the Party of Regions and [[Communist Party of Ukraine|Communists]] to pass it. They also approved legislation limiting the powers of the President while increasing the powers of the Prime Minister. In particular the parties approved legislation which would strip the President of the right to reject a candidate for Prime Minister, dismiss the Defense, Interior and Foreign Ministers and appoint a head of the State Intelligence Service. Yushchenko promised to veto the legislation.&lt;ref name=Time&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1838848,00.html |title=Why Ukraine's Pro-Western Coalition Split |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=4 September 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908011536/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C1838848%2C00.html |archivedate=8 September 2008 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bloomberg&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601085&amp;sid=avVAAysbcd8I&amp;refer=europe|title=Yushchenko May Dissolve Ukraine Parliament, Call Vote|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=3 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the vote President Yushchenko's bloc pulled out of the governing coalition saying Tymoshenko was colluding with the opposition and the President warned he would call a snap election if a new coalition was not formed within the required time. He further accused Tymoshenko of trying to set up a "dictatorship of the prime minister" and calling the parliamentary vote "a political and constitutional coup d'état." Tymoshenko rejected the allegations and said the real reason the president "declared a war against me is to ensure his victory in the next presidential elections." In spite of this Tymoshenko has called for restoring the coalition between the two groups.&lt;ref name="news.xinhuanet.com"/&gt; She also defended her position on Georgia saying it was "in line with the European Union and it is not to drag Ukraine into conflicts."&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; Parliament further increased the powers of the Prime Minister by passing legislation requiring the appointment and dismissal of the [[General Prosecutor of Ukraine|Prosecutor General]] by the President to receive the consent of the Prime Minister and giving the government power to appoint local heads of government if the President rejects the candidates.&lt;ref name="zik.com.ua"/&gt;

On 8 September, Our Ukraine MP Andry Parubij claimed Tymoshenko and Regions had already reached a deal on forming a new government and were dividing up posts for a new cabinet (a claim Tynoshenko has denied&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zik.com.ua/en/news/2008/09/08/149203|title=

He also said that if a coalition is formed between Tymoshenko's bloc and Regions, Our Ukraine would appeal to the Constitutional Court to assess the legality of the December 2004 changes made in the constitution which, if successful, would restore wide powers held by the office of president.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; During the "Freedom of Speech" program on 9 September 2008 Tymoshenko said she was "categorically against" the decrees made by Yushchenko on the Russian Black Sea Fleet saying they risked provoking a response from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/09/content_9878587.htm|title=Ukrainian PM firmly against president's decree restricting Russia's fleet movement |publisher=Xinhua|date=9 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080912030914/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-09/09/content_9878587.htm| archivedate= 12 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September, Tymoshenko reiterated her call for the coalition to be restored, but said she would not accept any preconditions for Our Ukraine to return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-272168.html|title=Tymoshenko again asks Yushchenko to resume coalition|publisher=[[Ukrainian Independent Information Agency]]|date=10 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080913183132/http://www.unian.net/eng/news/news-272168.html| archivedate= 13 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also said at the moment they were not discussing any other coalition.

The same day Yan Bernazyuk, Yushchenko's liaison to the government of Tymoshenko, said representatives of the Presidential Secretariat were not allowed to attend the government session. Bernazyuk claimed the reason was because the government was discussing four issues which had a "clear Kremlin face" concerning "permits on use of mineral products without any contests, sales, and tenders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2008/09/10/150057.html|title=Tymoshenko did not allow Yushchenko's people to attend Cabinet's session|publisher=forUm|date=10 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920070524/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2008/09/10/150057.html|archivedate=20 September 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yushchenko urged representatives and members of the regional, city and district councils to unite against the formation of a new coalition by retaining the "democratic coalition" in the local governments as well as for all other "national forces" to unite. He said the new relationship between the Tymoshenko bloc and Regions was a "serious threat for democratic choice of Ukraine" which was in danger of reconsidering "national priorities to principles of democratic governing, including the local one."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.for-ua.com/news/2008/09/10/164538.html|title=Yushchenko urges local councils to struggle against new majority|publisher=forUm|date=10 September 2008|accessdate=10 September 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920070529/http://en.for-ua.com/news/2008/09/10/164538.html|archivedate=20 September 2008|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials from the Party of Regions accused Yushchenko of planning to impose direct presidential rule by dissolving the parliament without calling early elections.

On 16 September, the collapse of the BYuT/NU-NS coalition was officially announced.&lt;ref name="afp.google.com"/&gt; Yulia Tymoshenko unleashed one of her harshest attacks on Yushchenko yet, accusing the President of destroying the gains of the [[Orange Revolution]], sinking hopes of rebuilding the coalition. "Since 2004, this president has managed to destroy everything: people's faith in the ideals of the revolution and faith in the president himself – only 5 percent still support him," she told reporters after a cabinet meeting. "Unfortunately, this president will leave a legacy of shattered remnants of the 'orange' promises and democratic coalitions, of his own team and even of his friends and his own political standing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/29741 "Ukraine PM fires broadside at Yushchenko"].

President Yushchenko later said Tymoshenko was working with the Party of Regions, and the Communist Party on decisions aimed at destabilizing the country in order to establish a new political regime. [[Yuriy Yekhanurov]], Ukraine's Defense Minister and member of Yushchenko's Our Ukraine bloc, said he and his political force would take all effort necessary to maintain the stability of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/29830|title=Yushchenko accuses Tymoshenko of betraying Ukraine's national interests|publisher=[[Kyiv Post]]|date=21 September 2008|accessdate=22 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080923135544/http://www.kyivpost.com/nation/29830| archivedate= 23 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 19 September Yulia Tymoshenko called the information about the existence of an informal coalition between BYuT, the Party of Regions and Communist Part of Ukraine “black political propaganda.” The Premier believed that the spreading of such information was aimed at changing the arrangement of political forces leading up to the [[Ukrainian presidential election, 2010|Ukrainian presidential elections in 2010]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2782">'''Amalgamation''' in [[English land law|English and Welsh land law]] is a simple process carried out in [[registered land]]. It combines neighbouring parcels (holdings) of land which are [[freehold (law)|freehold]]. 

In [[leasehold estate|leasehold]] land interests (which can be at any [[storey]]) respective surrenders and a new combined lease followed by its registration instead is the process used: combination of leases &amp;mdash; this can also be called the [[surrender and regrant]] involving more than one surrender.

==Statute and regulations==
A small fee is payable to HM Land Registry rule 3 of the [[Land Registration Act 2002|Land Registration Rules 2003]] for amalgamation or subdivision.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/hm-land-registry-registration-services-fees&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects==
A single title with a larger plot shown in its associated title plan results. It avoids:
*Duplication of data.
*The risk of a part of the land being forgotten in a mortgage or sale.
*Inappropriate boundary features (fences/railings) being inadvertently kept/installed on the ground between two parcels in common ownership.
It enables:
*New geometric subdivision of the land (sometimes called [[Severance (land)|severance]]), in deed termed transfers of part, which may be planned using a pre-approved Estate Plan submitted to the [[Land Registry]]
*Owners of subsidiary interests (e.g. mortgage lenders) to hold a marginally more solid security (with the benefit of certainty as to the totality of the estate), of particular use in auction sales which tend to miss additional parcels.
*In re-attachment corrections or alterations of title a closer match to the original title in which the land originally belonged.&lt;ref&gt;"Where a transfer[(s) is] by way of correction or alteration the applicant may wish to apply for amalgamation with an existing title, so that the ultimate registrations match as closely as possible the position that would have applied if the original transfer had not required correction or alteration." HM Land Registry Practice Guide 68 (PG68) http://www.gov.uk/government/publications/amending-deeds-that-effect-dispositions-of-registered-land/practice-guide-68-amending-deeds-that-effect-dispositions-of-registered-land&lt;/ref&gt;
It results in a slightly lengthier title register than a single one of the contributor titles where, just as on first registration of land which once had different ownership and has been affected by differing neighbours or developers imposing covenants on it, the titles vary in their [[easement]]s and [[Covenant (law)|covenant]]s.

The '''1982 Busan arson attack''' or '''Busan American Council Fire Accidents''' ([[Hangeul]]: 부산 미국문화원 방화사건, [[Hanja]]: 釜山美文化院放火事件) was an [[Anti-American sentiment in Korea|Anti-American]] attack against the [[United States Information Agency|United States Information Service]] building in [[Busan]] on 18 March 1982. The attack resulted in the death of a [[Dong-a University]] student who was studying in the building; 3 others were injured.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/11/world/2-sentenced-to-death-in-korean-arson-case.html|title=2 Sentenced to Death In Korean Arson Case|publisher=New York Times|date=11 August 1982|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In June 1982, 16 people were put on trial in Busan for involvement in the attack. Theology student Moon Pu Shik (23) admitted the arson charge, saying the fire was a protest against US support for the [[Chun Doo-hwan]] dictatorship, particularly the suppression of the [[Gwangju Uprising]]. The other defendants included journalist Kim Hyong Jang (32) and Reverend Choi Ki Shik (39) head of the Catholic education center in [[Wonju]], who was accused of sheltering the attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/16/world/political-trial-under-way-in-korea.html|title=Political trial under way in Korea|publisher=New York Times|date=15 June 1982|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1982 Kim Hyong Jang and Moon Pu Shik were sentenced to death for the arson, while Moon's wife Kim Un Suk (24) and Lee Mi Ok (21), were sentenced to life imprisonment.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; Following pleas for mercy from the US and protests by Catholic and Protestant groups, Kim and Moon's death sentences were [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] to life imprisonment in March 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/16/world/chun-spares-2-doomed-in-korean-arson-case.html|title=Chun spares 2 doomed in Korean arson case|publisher=New York Times|date=18 March 1983|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their sentences were reduced to 20 years in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=|first=|title=Freedom of Expression in the Republic of Korea|publisher=Human Rights Watch|year=1988|isbn=9780929692029|pages=78-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/27/world/seoul-declares-an-amnesty-but-not-for-everyone.html|title=Seoul declares an amnesty but not for everyone|publisher=New York Times|date=27 February 1988|accessdate=14 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moon Pu Shik was released from prison in 1988 after having served 6 years and 9 months in prison.

'''The Canadian Housing and Renewal Association''' ('''CHRA''') is a national [[Non-profit organization|non-profit association]] in [[Canada]] representing those working in (or concerned with the state of) [[affordable housing]] and [[homelessness]] in Canada. 

CHRA's main objectives include: 
* Keeping homes affordable&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/63uMS1yiy?url=http://www.vancouversun.com/business/home%20buyers%20need%20relief/5738050/story.html Peter Simpson, "New-home buyers need tax relief now". ''Vancouver Sun'', November 19, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ending homelessness
* Renewing communities and
* Creating a [[Green building|sustainable-housing profession]]

CHRA aims to achieve these goals through its activities, including: 
* [[Government of Canada|Federal-level]] [[advocacy]]
* An annual congress
* Creating opportunities for members to share ideas and workable solutions
* Providing online and in-person learning opportunities
* Disseminating housing- and homelessness-related information to members and to the broader housing and homelessness sectors

== History ==

During the mid-1960s, a group of concerned [[urban renewal]] professionals in [[Toronto]] became members of the Upper New York State Chapter of the National Association of Housing Renewal Officials (NAHRO). From this nucleus, the Canadian Association of Housing &amp; Renewal Officials (CAHRO) was formed in 1967. 
The original members of CAHRO were concerned with urban renewal; however, this changed with the development of a national membership and the introduction of the Neighbourhood Improvement Program (NIP). As stated in the CAHRO constitution at the time, the objectives of the association were: 
:"to promote understanding of housing, community renewal, [[housing development]], programs and policies, and rehabilitation and property standards affecting the urban environment at the municipal level, and to promote this understanding through dissemination of information on [[legislation]] and techniques."

During the early 1970s, the membership was limited to several hundred. The annual [[Business conference|conference]] was the only regular meeting, and correspondence consisted of a mailing before the annual meeting. This changed in 1977, when a  [[newsletter]] (''Communiqué'') was sent to members at irregular intervals in response to new federal policy in housing. This newsletter (and other activities) were limited by resources derived from membership dues and a small profit from the annual conference. 

In early 1977, the president of CAHRO approached the then-[[Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation]] (CMHC) requesting [[funding]] to establish a small national office with an executive director. CAHRO felt that unless the association had its own office, it could not become an effective municipal voice in housing. 
Initial meetings between the two agencies centred on this proposal; however, experience with similar operations led CMHC to suggest funding for a product-oriented agreement. In late summer 1977, CAHRO submitted a proposal to CMHC for funding of a national housing magazine. The proposal was formally agreed on in summer 1978.

In the agreement, CMHC agreed to fund CAHRO for two purposes: 
*To produce a periodical on housing and neighbourhood revitalization and related activities
*Generating [[revenue]] to recover some of the costs of the publication, by promoting CAHRO membership and activities

Further specifications concerning the [[periodical]] were made. It was to be [[bilingual]], national and published six times per year. In 1978, there were to be two issues. Furthermore, 
:"it will contain practical and technical information to address program delivery problems and improve skills; illustrations, analyses, news and comments related to the wide range of housing and rehabilitation issues and activities. It will review current resources material and provide an inquiry service to its readers who will primarily include the various public and private groups and individuals involved in the delivery of NIP and RRAP, and other related housing and [[Architectural conservation#Current treatments|rehabilitation]] activity."

Staffing interviews for the magazine were held in August 1978; by early September, three people were set up in the CAHRO national office in [[Fredericton, New Brunswick]] working on the first issue of ''Impact''.
During its six-year history, ''Impact'' communicated CAHRO's responses to government housing policies and positions, voiced housing-related issues and policies emerging at the municipal level, and published articles and opinions from across the country. 
In 1984, CAHRO moved to a national office in [[Ottawa]] and hired Heather Lang-Runtz as executive director and editor. With this move came the decision to create a national housing magazine that would not only disseminate information to members, but would also help increase the organization's capacity to attract new members and become a stronger advocate for improved housing in Canada. 

In the fall of 1984, the first issue of ''Canadian Housing'' was published.
In late 1988, stemming from a decision to broaden the scope of the organization from that of a program-specific [[lobby group]] toward a more broadly-based national housing organization focusing on housing affordability for Canadians, the name of the organization was changed to the Canadian Housing and Renewal Association (CHRA).

== CHRA today ==
From the beginning of the CHRA/CMHC funding agreement in 1978 through the early 2000s, CHRA sustained itself primarily by way of this funding. In 2009, in the midst of federal spending cuts it became clear that CMHCs funding for CHRA would be cut. The annual funding provided by CMHC to CHRA ended in December 2010. 
As of 2011, CHRA aims to replace its CMHC funding through budget-cutting, increased membership and revenue generation through its services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17281">The '''Case of the Anti-Soviet "Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites"''' (or "Bloc of [[Right]]s and Trotskyites") ({{Lang-ru|Процесс антисоветского «право-троцкистского блока»}}), also known as the '''Trial of the Twenty-One''', was the last of the three public [[Moscow Trials]],{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}&lt;!-- see [[Talk:Moscow Trials]]--&gt; [[show trial]]s charging prominent [[Bolshevik]]s with espionage and treason. The Trial of the Twenty-One took place in [[Moscow]] in March 1938, towards the end of the Soviet [[Great Purge]].

==The charges==
The third show trial, in March 1938, known as ''The Trial of the Twenty-One'', is the most famous{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} of the [[Soviet Union]] [[show trial]]s because of the people involved and the scope of the charges, which tied together all of the loose threads from earlier show trials.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} It included 21 defendants alleged to belong to the so-called "Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites":
# [[Nikolai Bukharin]] – [[Marxist]] theoretician, former head of the [[Communist International]] and member of the [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]]
# [[Alexei Rykov]] – former premier and member of the Politburo
# [[Nikolai Krestinsky]] – former member of the Politburo and ambassador to Germany
# [[Christian Rakovsky]] – former ambassador to Great Britain and France
# [[Genrikh Yagoda]] – former head of the [[NKVD]]
# [[Arkady Rosengolts|Arkady Rosengoltz]] – former [[People's Commissar]] for Foreign Trade
# [[Vladimir Ivanovich Ivanov|Vladimir Ivanov]] – former People's Commissar for the Timber Industry
# [[Mikhail Alexandrovich Chernov|Mikhail Chernov]] – former People's Commissar for Agriculture
# [[Grigori Grinko]] – former People's Commissar for Finance
# [[Isaak Zelensky]] – former Secretary of the Central Committee
# [[Sergei Bessonov]]
# [[Akmal Ikramov]] – [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] leader
# [[Fayzulla Khodzhayev|Faizulla Khodjayev]] – Uzbek leader
# [[Vasily Sharangovich]] – former first secretary in [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussia]]
# [[Prokopy Zubarev]]
# [[Pavel Bulanov]] – NKVD officer
# [[Lev Levin]] – [[Kremlin]] doctor
# [[Dmitri Pletnyov (doctor)|Dmitry Pletnyov]] – Kremlin doctor
# [[Ignaty Kazakov]] ([[:ru:Казаков, Игнатий Николаевич|ru]]) – Kremlin doctor
# [[Maximov-Dikovsky Venyamin]] ([[:ru:Максимов-Диковский, Вениамин_Адамович|ru]])
# [[Pyotr Kryuchkov]] – secretary of [[Maxim Gorky]]

They were all proclaimed members of the "right [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] bloc" that intended to overthrow [[socialism]] and restore capitalism in [[Russia]], among other things.

Meant to be the culmination of previous trials,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} it now alleged that Bukharin and others committed the following crimes:
* murdering [[Sergey Kirov]], [[Valerian Kuybyshev]], [[State Political Directorate]] (OGPU) chair [[Vyacheslav Menzhinsky]], and writer [[Maxim Gorky]] and his son
* unsuccessfully trying to assassinate [[Vladimir Lenin]], [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Yakov Sverdlov]] in 1918
* plotting to assassinate [[Yakov Sverdlov]], [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], [[Lazar Kaganovich]], [[Kliment Voroshilov]] and Stalin
* conspiring to wreck the economy (by [[Sabotage|sabotaging]] mines, derailing trains, killing cattle, deliberately organizing deficit of food products, putting nails and glasses in butter) and the country's military power
* [[Espionage|Spying]] for [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]], [[Japan]]ese, and [[Germany|German]] [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]]
* making secret agreements with Germany and Japan, promising to surrender [[Belarus]], [[Ukraine]], [[Central Asia]] and the [[Russian Far East]] to foreign powers

All of the defendants confessed to these charges during the show trial with a few notable, but limited, exceptions. The charges have been characterized as "fantastic"&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=M285AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT316&amp;dq=%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9+%D0%BD%D0%B5+%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5+%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5&amp;hl=et&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiAx_-41NLaAhVDCewKHaIABwYQ6AEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%20%D0%BD%D0%B5%20%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B5%D0%B5%20%D1%84%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B5&amp;f=false Тайная история сталинского времени By Александр Орлов]&lt;/ref&gt;. The defendants supposedly organized explosions in mines, hoping to kill as many miners as possible, as well as railway accidents. The most nightmarish confessions were made by Zelensky: working in the trade sector he supposedly wanted to organize famine and "confessed" that in order to harm Soviet people his organization put [[glass]] and nails in the [[butter]] to cut the consumers' throat and stomach&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrono.ru/dokum/1938buharin/utro5-5-38-1.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ee/books?id=kaFKCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA195&amp;lpg=PA195&amp;dq=%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9+%D0%B3%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B8&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Xi-4t9W9SG&amp;sig=UzzhKxGw03sC1ExNWdQxtrZJC1Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL1u6j2NLaAhXDKewKHRTSD40Q6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%D0%B7%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9%20%D0%B3%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B7%D0%B4%D0%B8&amp;f=false Судебный отчет по делу антисоветского право-троцкистского блока]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is assumed that [[Stalin]] included a number of economic executives in this trial because he wanted to lay the blame for the catastrophic living conditions of the population on the supposed "wreckers" in the economic sphere.

==The trial==
The preparation for this trial was delayed in its early stages due to the reluctance of some party members to denounce their comrades.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Stalin personally intervened to speed up the process and replaced Yagoda with [[Nikolai Yezhov]].  Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn claimed that Stalin also observed some of the trial in person from a hidden chamber in the courtroom.&lt;ref name=Solzhenitsyn&gt;See Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn. ''The Gulag Archipelago'' Vol I-II, Harper &amp; Row, 1973, {{ISBN|0-06-013914-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one defendant, Nikolai Krestinsky, initially refused to admit his guilt.&lt;ref name="art-bin.com"&gt;Gudrun Person, "And They All Confessed" http://art-bin.com/art/amosc_preeng.html&lt;/ref&gt; He changed his position within a day, however, telling Public Prosecutor [[Andrei Vyshinsky]]: "I fully and completely admit that I am guilty of all the gravest charges brought against me personally, and that I admit my complete responsibility for the treason and treachery I have committed."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, ''The Great Terror: A Reassessment'', Page 352&lt;/ref&gt;

Bukharin's confession was limited in a different fashion. Observers have speculated that Bukharin had reached some sort of agreement with the prosecution: while he admitted guilt to general charges, he undercut that by denying any knowledge when it came to specific crimes. Bukharin typically would admit only what was in his written confessions and refused to go any further; at one point in the trial, when Vyshinsky asked him about a conspiracy to weaken Soviet military power, Bukharin responded "it was not discussed, at least in my presence," at which point Vyshinsky dropped the question and moved to another topic.&lt;ref&gt;New Internationalist, "The Trial of the 21" http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/document/swp-us/trialof21.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There is other evidence that Bukharin had reached an agreement to trade his confession for personal concessions of some sort. [[Anastas Mikoyan]] and [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] claim that Bukharin was never tortured. Bukharin had been allowed to write four book-length manuscripts, including an autobiographical novel, ''How It All Began'', a philosophical treatise, and a collection of poems – all of which were found in Stalin's archive and published in the 1990s – while in prison. Bukharin also wrote a series of very emotional letters to Stalin protesting his innocence and professing his love for Stalin, which contrasts with his critical opinion of Stalin and his policies expressed to others and his conduct in the trial.&lt;ref name="hoover.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hoover.org/research/martyred-communism |title=Martyred for Communism |last=Gregory|first=Paul R. |publisher=Hoover Digest |date=2 July 2010 |website=Hoover Institute |access-date=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet Bukharin appears to have strayed from that agreement at trial. While he had accepted responsibility "even for those crimes about which I did not know or about which I did not have the slightest idea" on the theory that he was the head of the "Bloc of Rightists and Trotskyites", he testified that the Bloc did not exist and its members had never met.&lt;ref name="hoover.org"/&gt;

The result was a curious mix of fulsome confessions and subtle criticisms of the trial. After disproving several charges against him (one observer noted that he proceeded to demolish or rather showed he could very easily demolish the whole case&lt;ref&gt;Report by Viscount Chilston (British ambassador) to Viscount Halifax, No.141, Moscow, March 21, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;) and saying that "the confession of accused is not essential. The confession of the accused is a medieval principle of jurisprudence" in the trial that was solely based on confessions, he finished his last plea with "the monstrousness of my crime is immeasurable especially in the new stage of struggle of the U.S.S.R. May this trial be the last severe lesson, and may the great might of the U.S.S.R. become clear to all."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tucker, "Report of Court Proceedings in the Case of the Anti-Soviet "Block of Rights and Trotskyites", Pg.667-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Other defendants apparently still hoped for clemency. Yagoda, who had overseen the interrogations that led to the previous show trials, made a plea for mercy directly to Stalin, who may, according to [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|Solzhenitsyn]], have been observing the proceedings:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just as though Stalin had been sitting right there in the hall, Yagoda confidently and insistently begged him directly for mercy: "I appeal to you! ''For you'' I built two [[White Sea-Baltic Canal|great]] [[Moscow-Volga Canal|canals]]!" And a witness reports that at just that moment a match flared in the shadows behind a window on the second floor of the hall, apparently behind a muslin curtain, and, while it lasted, the outline of a pipe could be seen.&lt;ref name=Solzhenitsyn/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his final word, Vyshinsky said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All our country, from small one to old one, awaits and demands one thing: traitors and spies who sold to the enemy our homeland to be shot like mad dogs. Our people demands one thing: crush the accursed vermin!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Verdict==
All but three were found guilty "of having committed extremely grave state offenses covered by...the [[Law of the Soviet Union|Criminal Code]]...sentenced to the supreme penalty&amp;mdash;to [[Execution by firing squad|be shot]]." Pletnyov was sentenced to 25 years in prison, Rakovsky to 20 years, and Bessonov to 15 years. By one account, Bukharin – who had asked to be poisoned, rather than shot – was forced to watch the execution of sixteen other defendants before being shot himself.&lt;ref name="hoover.org"/&gt;

==Reactions to the trial==
Even sympathetic observers who had stomached the earlier trials found it hard to swallow new charges as they became ever more absurd and the purge by now expanded to include virtually every living Old Bolshevik leader except Stalin. For some prominent former communists, such as [[Bertram Wolfe]], [[Jay Lovestone]], [[Arthur Koestler]], and [[Heinrich Brandler]], the Bukharin trial marked their final break with [[communism]] and turned the first three into ardent [[anti-communist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bertram David Wolfe, "Breaking with communism", p. 10; Arthur Koestler, 'Darkness of Noon', p.258&lt;/ref&gt;

Bukharin's testimony became the subject of much debate among Western observers, inspiring Koestler's acclaimed novel [[Darkness at Noon]] and a philosophical essay by [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] in ''Humanism and Terror'', among others. Koestler and others viewed Bukharin's testimony as a true believer's last service to the Party (while preserving a small amount of personal honor) whereas Bukharin biographer Stephen Cohen and Robert Tucker saw traces of [[Aesopian language]], with which Bukharin sought to turn the table into trial of Stalinism, while keeping his part of bargain to save his family. Bukharin himself speaks of his "peculiar duality of mind" in his last plea, which led to "semi-paralysis of the will" and Hegelian "[[unhappy consciousness]]", which presumably stemmed from the conflict between his knowledge of the reality of Stalinist rule and the threat of fascism, which led Bukharin and others to follow Stalin, who had become the personification of the Party.

Others were not so critical of the trial.  Ambassador [[Joseph E.

==References in literature==

===''Darkness at Noon''===
Arthur Koestler's novel ''Darkness at Noon'' (1944) gives a haunting, if at least partly fictitious, portrayal of the atmosphere surrounding this{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} trial. It tells of an old Bolshevik's last weeks trying to come to terms with the unintended results of the revolution he helped create. As a former member of the Communist party, Koestler rises above the dichotomy of much of the [[Cold War]], showing a deep understanding for the origins of the Soviet Revolution, while at the same time severely criticizing its results.

===''Eastern Approaches''===
[[Sir Fitzroy Maclean, 1st Baronet|Fitzroy Maclean]]'s autobiography ''[[Eastern Approaches]]'' has a chapter devoted to this trial, which he witnessed while working in Moscow for the British [[Foreign Office]]. He goes into great detail describing a number of the exchanges between the accused and the prosecutor. He also gives the history behind several of the people on trial, their service to the party and their positions before being tried.

===''A Russian Adventure''===
[[Halldór Laxness]], the Icelandic author, was present at the trial and described it in detail in his travelogue from USSR in 1937–38, ''Gerska æfintýrið'' (''The Russian Adventure''), published in Iceland in 1938 and in a Danish translation in 1939. He seems to have believed in the guilt of the accused, but adds that it did not matter anyway: sacrifices have to be made to the cause of the revolution. In his 1963 memoirs, ''Skáldatími'' (''A Poet's Time''), Laxness returned to the trial, giving a totally different description of it, now much more sympathetic to Bukharin and his fellow defendants.

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3929">'''Climate debt''' is a theoretical concept which has been submitted to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] by over fifty countries including Bolivia, [[Bhutan]], Malaysia, [[Micronesia]], Sri Lanka, Paraguay, Venezuela and the Group of Least Developed countries, representing 49 of the world's poorest and most vulnerable countries.

==Overview==
The climate-debt concept incorporates two distinct elements:

;Adaptation debt: which represents the compensation owed to the poor for the damages of climate change they have not caused.
;Emissions debt: which is compensation owed for their fair share of the atmospheric space they cannot use if climate change is     to be stopped.

==Adaptation Debt==

The extent of adaptation debt is difficult to calculate; but has three main components:

* Avoiding harm – i.e. the costs of avoiding climate harms and impacts can be estimated from necessary changes to national planning, projects and programs
* Direct harm – i.e. the direct costs of actual (unavoidable) harms, which should be compensated at full costs
* Forgone opportunities – i.e. the costs of lost and diminished opportunities in developing countries, caused by having to forego development pathways followed by the North

The climate-debt theory posits that wealthy countries and companies are accountable for the impacts of their historical and continued over-consumption of the Earth’s limited resources.

==Emissions Debt==

The over-emitting or disproportionate emitting of greenhouse gases is characterized as 'emissions debt' (or 'credit for under-emitting); one which should hypothetically be paid for (by monetary or non-monetary means) by those countries that have over-emitted their fair-share of emissions. To determine this debt, an [[Emissions budget|emissions or carbon budget]] is calculated, and distributed among countries. 

The climate-debt theory argues that to stop climate change humans must accept that there is an '[[emissions budget]]' which represents the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions the Earth's atmosphere can absorb without climate change occurring. Given this, the climate negotiations are, in substantial part, about how to share this budget. The negotiations are about how to share the Earth’s atmospheric space between rich and poor countries, and how to share the financing and effort of mitigation of emissions between countries. 

The climate-debt theory argues that the negotiations are about the allocation of an emissions budget. There are many budget estimations, and distributing these budgets 'fairly' is an ethical challenge on the international stage. More information can be found on the [[emissions budget]] page. 

==Civil Society Support==

The idea of "Climate-debt" as a paradigm for responding to the climate crisis is supported by many NGOs, civil society movements and people's movements including those who are members of [[Climate Justice Now!]]

It is one of the topics at the World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth to be held in Cochabamba, Bolivia from 20–22 April  2010.

The '''Combahee River Collective''' was a [[Black feminism|Black feminist]] [[lesbian]] organization active in [[Boston]] from 1974 to 1980.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;[http://www.uga.edu/~womanist/harris3.1.htm Duchess Harris. Interview with Barbara Smith.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="manning"&gt;[[Manning Marable|Marable, Manning]]; [[Leith Mullings]] (eds), ''Let Nobody Turn Us Around: Voices of Resistance, Reform, and Renewal'', Combahee River Collective Statement, Rowman and Littlefield, 2000, {{ISBN|0-8476-8346-X}}, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; The Collective was instrumental in highlighting that the white feminist movement was not addressing their particular needs.&lt;ref&gt;Women's Realities, Women's Choices: An Introduction to Women's and Gender Studies. ,
 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; They are perhaps best known for developing the '''Combahee River Collective Statement''',&lt;ref name="statement2"&gt;The full text of the Combahee River Collective Statement is available [http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html here].&lt;/ref&gt; a key document in the history of contemporary Black feminism and the development of the concepts of [[Identity (social science)|identity]] as used among political organizers and social theorists.&lt;ref name="E. Hawkesworth, Maurice Kogan 2004, p577"&gt;Hawkesworth, M. E.; Maurice Kogan. ''Encyclopedia of Government and Politics'', 2nd edn Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|0-415-27623-3}}, p. 577.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harriet Sigerman 1941, p316"&gt;Sigerman, Harriet. ''The Columbia Documentary History of American Women Since 1941'', Columbia University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-231-11698-5}}, p. 316.&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Black Feminist Organization==
Author [[Barbara Smith]] and other delegates attending the first (1973) regional meeting of the [[National Black Feminist Organization]] in [[New York City]] provided the groundwork for the Combahee River Collective with their efforts to build an NBFO Chapter in Boston.&lt;ref name="bowen"&gt;Bowen, Angela. Combahee River Collective, ''Encyclopedia of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender History in America'', October 2005 issue.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="collier"&gt;[[Bettye Collier-Thomas|Collier-Thomas]], Bettye; Vincent P. Franklin, ''Sisters in the Struggle: African American Women in the Civil Rights Movement'', NYU Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8147-1603-2}}, p. 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2001 essay "From the Kennedy Commission to the Combahee Collective", historian and [[African American Studies]] professor Duchess Harris states that, in 1974 the Boston collective "observed that their vision for social change was more radical than the NBFO", and as a result, the group chose to strike out on their own as the Combahee River Collective.&lt;ref name="Harris, Duchess 2001, p294"&gt;Harris, Duchess. "From the Kennedy Commission to the Combahee Collective", in ''Sisters in the Struggle'', Collier-Thomas et al. (eds), New York University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8147-1602-4}}, p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the CRC, notably Barbara Smith and Demita Frazier, felt it was critical that the organization address the needs of Black lesbians, in addition to organizing on behalf of Black feminists.&lt;ref name="Harris, Duchess 2001, p294"/&gt;

==Naming the collective==
{{further|Raid at Combahee Ferry}}
The Collective's name was suggested by Smith, who owned a book called: ''Harriet Tubman, Conductor on the Underground Railroad'' by [[Earl Conrad]].&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt; She "wanted to name the collective after a historical event that was meaningful to [[African American]] women."&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt; Smith noted: "It was a way of talking about ourselves being on a continuum of Black struggle, of Black women's struggle."&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt; The name commemorated [[Raid at Combahee Ferry|an action]] at the [[Combahee River]] planned and led by [[Harriet Tubman]] on June 2, 1863, in the [[Port Royal, South Carolina|Port Royal]] region of [[South Carolina]]. The action freed more than 750 slaves and is the only military campaign in American history planned and led by a woman.&lt;ref name="herrmann"&gt;Herrmann, Anne C.; Abigail J. Stewart, ''Theorizing Feminism: Parallel Trends in the Humanities and Social Sciences'', Westview Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-8133-6788-3}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developing the Statement==
The Combahee River Collective Statement was developed by a "collective of Black feminists...involved in the process of defining and clarifying our politics, while...doing political work within our own group and in coalition with other progressive organizations and movements...."&lt;ref name="statement2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statement"&gt;Combahee River Collective, "A Black Feminist Statement," in ''[[Capitalist Patriarchy and the Case for Socialist Feminism]]'', ed. [[Zillah R. Eisenstein]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the collective describe having a feeling of creating something which had not existed previously. Demita Frazier described the CRC's beginnings as "not a mix cake", meaning that the women involved had to create the meaning and purpose of the group "from scratch."&lt;ref name="Smith, Barbara p172"&gt;Smith, Barbara. "Doing it from Scratch: The Challenge of Black Lesbian Organizing", in Barbara Smith (ed.), ''The Truth that Never Hurts: Writings on Race, Gender and Freedom'', Rutgers University Press, {{ISBN|0-8135-2761-9}}, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1995 essay "Doing it from Scratch: The Challenge of Black Lesbian Organizing", which borrows its title from Frazier's statement, Barbara Smith describes the early activities of the collective as "[[consciousness raising]] and political work on a multitude of issues", along with the building of "friendship networks, community and a rich Black women's culture where none had existed before."&lt;ref name="Smith, Barbara p172"/&gt;

===Process of writing the Statement===
Throughout the mid-1970s members of the Combahee River Collective met weekly at the [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] Women's Center.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Jaime M. (ed. Bonnie Zimmerman), ''Lesbian Histories and Cultures'', Routledge, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Collective held retreats throughout the Northeast between 1977 and 1979 to discuss issues of concern to Black feminists. Author [[Alexis De Veaux]], biographer of poet [[Audre Lorde]], describes a goal of the retreats as to "institutionalize Black feminism" and develop "an ideological separation from white feminism", as well as to discuss "the limitations of white feminists' fixation 'on the primacy of gender as an oppression.'"&lt;ref&gt;De Veaux, Alexis. ''Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2004, {{ISBN|0-393-01954-3}}, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "Black feminist retreat" was held July 1977 in [[South Hadley]], [[Massachusetts]]. Its purpose was to assess the state of the movement, to share information about the participants' political work, and to talk about possibilities and issues for organizing Black women."&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt; "Twenty Black feminists ...were invited (and) were asked to bring copies of any written materials relevant to Black feminism—articles, pamphlets, papers, their own creative work – to share with the group. Frazier, Smith, and Smith, who organized the retreats, hoped that they would foster political stimulation and spiritual rejuvenation."&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt;

The second retreat was held in November 1977 in Franklin Township, [[New Jersey]], and the third and fourth were scheduled for March and July 1978.&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt; "After these retreats occurred, the participants were encouraged to write articles for the Third World women's issue of ''[[Conditions (magazine)|Conditions]]'', a journal edited by [[Lorraine Bethel]] and [[Barbara Smith]]."&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt; The importance of publishing was also emphasized in the fifth retreat, held July 1979, and the collective discussed contributing articles for a lesbian [[herstory]] issue of two journals, ''Heresies'' and ''[[Frontiers (magazine)|Frontiers]]''.&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt;

"Participants at the sixth retreat... discussed articles in the May/June 1979 issue of ''[[The Black Scholar]]'' collectively titled, ''The Black Sexism Debate''....They also discussed the importance of writing to ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' to support an article in the September 1979 issue entitled ''I am a Lesbian'', by [[Chirlane McCray]], who was a Combahee member....The seventh retreat was held in Washington, D.C., in Feb. 1980."&lt;ref name="harris" /&gt;

The final Statement was based on this collective discussion, and drafted by [[African-American]] activists [[Barbara Smith]], [[Demita Frazier]] and [[Beverly Smith]].&lt;ref name="manning"/&gt;

===Political, social and cultural impact of the Statement===
The ''Combahee River Collective Statement'' is referred to as "among the most compelling documents produced by black feminists",&lt;ref name="Harriet Sigerman 1941, p316"/&gt; and Harriet Sigerman, author of ''The Columbia Documentary History of American Women Since 1941'' calls the solutions which the statement proposes to societal problems such as racial and sexual discrimination, [[homophobia]] and classist politics "multifaceted and interconnected."&lt;ref&gt;Sigerman, Harriet. ''The Columbia Documentary History of American Women Since 1941'', Columbia University Press, 2003, {{ISBN|0-231-11698-5}}, pp. 316–317.&lt;/ref&gt;

In their ''Encyclopedia of Government and Politics'', M. E. Hawkesworth and Maurice Kogan refer to the CRCS as "what is often seen as the definitive statement regarding the importance of [[identity politics]], particularly for people whose identity is marked by [[intersectionality|multiple interlocking oppressions]]".&lt;ref name="E. Hawkesworth, Maurice Kogan 2004, p577"/&gt;

Smith and the Combahee River Collective have been credited with coining the term identity politics, which they defined as "a politics that grew out of our objective material experiences as Black women."&lt;ref name="Harris, Duchess 2001, p300"&gt;Harris, Duchess. "From the Kennedy Commission to the Combahee Collective: Black Feminist Organizing, 1960–1980", in ''Sisters in the Struggle: African American Women in the Civil Rights-Black Power Movement'' (2001), p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay "From the Kennedy Commission to the Combahee Collective: Black Feminist Organizing, 1960–1980", Duchess Harris credits the "polyvocal political expressions of the Black feminists in the Combahee River Collective (with) defin(ing) the nature of identity politics in the 1980s and 1990s, and challeng(ing) earlier 'essentialist' appeals and doctrines..."&lt;ref name="Harris, Duchess 2001, p300"/&gt;

The Collective developed a multidimensional analysis recognizing a "simultaneity of oppressions"; refusing to rank oppressions based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class|class]] and [[gender]].&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Becky. ''A Promise and a Way of Life: White Antiracist Activism'', University of Minnesota Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-3634-1}}, p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; According to author and academic [[Angela Davis]], this analysis drew on earlier [[Black Marxist]] and [[Black Nationalist]] movements, and was [[anti-racism|anti-racist]] and [[anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Angela. ''The Angela Y. Davis Reader'', John Wiley, {{ISBN|978-0-631-20361-2}}, 1998, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Roderick Ferguson]]'s book ''Aberrations in Black,'' the ''Combahee River Collective Statement'' is cited as "rearticulating coalition to address gender, racial, and sexual dominance as part of capitalist expansion globally."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aberrations in Black|last=Ferguson|first=Roderick|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ferguson uses the articulation of simultaneity of oppressions to describe coalition building that exists outside of the organizations of the nation-state.

==Combahee River Collective Statement==

The Combahee River Collective Statement was separated into four separate chapters: The Genesis of Contemporary Black Feminism; What We Believe; Problems in Organizing Black Feminist; and Black Feminist Issues and Projects.

===Genesis of Contemporary Black Feminism===

The Genesis of Contemporary Black Feminism, as submitted by the Combahee River Collective, is very much rooted in the interlocking oppressions they endure. As Black Women, the Collective argued that they experience oppression based on race, gender, and class. Further, because many of the women were queer, they also acknowledged oppression based on sexuality as well. The Collective states its basis and active goals as "committed to struggling against racial, sexual, heterosexual and class oppression" and describe their particular task as the "development of integrated analysis and practice based upon the fact that the major systems of oppression are interlocking. The synthesis of these oppressions creates the conditions of our lives."&lt;ref name="statement2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt;

====Importance of Black women's liberation====
The CRC also emphasized that they held the fundamental and shared belief that "Black women are inherently valuable, that...(their) liberation is a necessity not as an adjunct to somebody else's but because of (their own) need as human persons for autonomy...."&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt; and expressed a particularly commitment to "working on those struggles in which race, sex, and class are simultaneous factors in oppression...."&lt;ref name="statement2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt;

===What We (CRC) Believe===
{{Cquote|quote= We realize that the only people who care enough about us to work consistently for our liberation are us. Our politics evolve from a healthy love for ourselves, our sisters and our community which allows us to continue our struggle and work.|width=50%}}

====The Importance of Black feminism====
The group saw "Black feminism as the logical political movement to combat the manifold and simultaneous oppressions that all women of color face...."&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt; and believed that "[T]he most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identit(ies)."&lt;ref name="statement2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt;

The statement describes "Contemporary Black feminism (as) the outgrowth of countless generations of personal sacrifice, militancy, and work by our mothers and sisters" such as [[Sojourner Truth]], [[Harriet Tubman]], [[Frances E. W. Harper]], [[Ida B. Wells Barnett]], and [[Mary Church Terrell]], (as well as thousands upon thousands of unknown women)."&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt; The work of these women has been obscured "by outside reactionary forces and racism and elitism within the (feminist) movement."&lt;ref name="statement2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt;

===Problems in organizing Black feminists===

Issues surrounding organizing around Black feminism are very much rooted in the lack of power and privilege black females have. CRC even notes that they don't have the privilege of their white heterosexual male and female counterparts. For them, this presented a clear impediment.

But beyond their lack of privilege of marginalized people, CRC knew they were more at stake organizing for their freedom. The collective theorized that the "liberation of all oppressed peoples necessitates the destruction of the political and economic systems of [[Capitalism]] and [[Imperialism]] as well as [[Patriarchy]]."&lt;ref name="statement2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt; Meaning that,"If Black women were free, it would mean that everyone else would have to be free, since our freedom would necessitate the destruction of all systems of oppression."&lt;ref name=Schneir&gt;Schneir, Miriam (ed.), ''Feminism in Our Time: The Essential Writings, World War II to the Present''. New York: Vintage, 1994. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Combahee Statement also notes that "Feminism is...very threatening to the majority of Black people because it calls into question some of the most basic assumptions about our existence, i.e., that sex should be a determinant of power relationships...The material conditions of most Black people would hardly lead them to upset both economic and sexual arrangements that seem to represent some stability in their lives. Many Black women have a good understanding of both sexism and racism in their lives, but because of the everyday constrictions on their lives cannot risk struggling against them both."&lt;ref name="statement2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt;

===Black Feminist Projects and Issues===

In this final section of the CRC statement, they argued that black feminism should not only address their concerns as black females, but should also address policy issues in the lives of other women, the Third World, and working people. They state, " We are particularly committed to working on those struggles  in which race, sex, and class are simultaneous factors in oppression."&lt;ref name=Schneir /&gt; This type of politic might include organizing around inadequate hospital care in Third World communities, or even for a rape crisis center in Black communities.

The Combahee Collective also expressed a concern and a desire to publicly address issues of racism in the white women's movement. The Statement is clear that: "Eliminating racism in the white women's movement is by definition work for white women to do, but we will continue to speak out and to demand accountability on this issue."&lt;ref name="statement2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="statement" /&gt;

==Other political work==
In the encyclopedia ''Lesbian Histories and Cultures'', contributing editor Jaime M. Grant contextualizes the CRC's work in the political trends of the time thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The collective came together at a time when many of its members were struggling to define a liberating feminist practice alongside the ascendence of a predominantly white [[feminist movement]], and a [[Black nationalist]] vision of women deferring to Black male leadership.&lt;ref name="Grant, Jaime M pp184-5"&gt;Grant, Jaime M. (ed: Bonnie Zimmerman), ''Lesbian Histories and Cultures'', Routledge, pp. 184–185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Grant believes the CRC was most important in the "emergence of coalition politics in the late 1970s and early 1980s... which demonstrated the key roles that progressive feminists of color can play" in bridging gaps "between diverse constituencies, while also creating new possibilities for change within deeply divided communities..."&lt;ref name="Grant, Jaime M pp184-5"/&gt; She notes that, in addition to penning the statement, "collective members were active in the struggle for [[desegregation]] of the Boston [[Public school (government funded)|public schools]], in community campaigns against [[police brutality]] in Black neighborhoods and on picket lines demanding construction jobs for Black workers."&lt;ref name="Grant, Jaime M pp184-5"/&gt; {{details|topic=school desegregation in Boston|Boston busing desegregation}}

The collective was also politically active around issues of [[violence against women]], in particular the murder of twelve Black women and one white woman in Boston in 1979.&lt;ref name="uga.edu"&gt;Grant, Jamie. "Who Is Killing Us?" accessed in "All of Who I am in the Same Place": The Combahee River Collective, by Duchess Harris [http://www.uga.edu/~womanist/harris3.1.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Becky Thompson]], associate professor at [[Simmons College in Boston]] and author of ''A Promise and a Way of Life: White Antiracist Activism'', the [[Boston Police Department]] and the media "attempted to dismiss the murders ... based on the notion that (the women) were alleged to be [[prostitution|prostitutes]] and therefore not worthy of protection or investigation."&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Becky. ''A Promise and a Way of Life: White Antiracist Activism'', University of Minnesota Press, {{ISBN|978-0-8166-3634-1}}, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1979 journal entry, Barbara Smith wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That winter and spring were a time of great demoralization, anger, sadness and fear for many Black women in Boston, including myself. It was also for me a time of some of the most intensive and meaningful political organizing I have ever done. The Black feminist political analysis and practice the Combahee River Collective had developed since 1974 enabled us to grasp both the sexual-political and racial-political implications of the murders and positioned us to be the link between the various communities that were outraged: Black people, especially Black women; other women of color; and white feminists, many of whom were also lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Barbara. "The Boston Murders", in Patricia Bell-Scott (ed.), ''Life Notes: Personal Writing by Contemporary Black Women'', Norton, 1993, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith developed these ideas into a pamphlet on the topic, articulating the need "to look at these murders as both racist and sexist crimes" and emphasizing the need to "talk about violence against women in the Black community."&lt;ref name="uga.edu"/&gt;

In a 1994 interview with Susan Goodwillie, Smith noted that this action moved the group out into the wider Boston community. She commented that "the pamphlet had the statement, the analysis, the political analysis, and it said that it had been prepared by the Combahee River Collective.  That was a big risk for us, a big leap to identify ourselves in something that we knew was going to be widely distributed."&lt;ref name="Smith interview"&gt;Smith, Barbara. [http://www.uga.edu/~womanist/harris3.1.htm Interview with Susan Goodwillie]. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Duchess Harris believes that "the Collective was most cohesive and active when the murders in Boston were occurring.  Having an event to respond to and to collectively organize around gave them a cause to focus on..."&lt;ref name="Smith interview"/&gt;

'''Communities Without Boundaries International''' ('''CWBI''') is an international non-governmental tax exempt organization carrying out peacebuilding and sustainable development projects in the US and around the globe, and founded on the philosophy and principles of nonviolence as espoused by [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]]. Their mission is to foster peace through development and the empowerment of [[Community|communities]] using the [[philosophy]] and principles of [[Nonviolence|nonviolent social change]]. Its missions are carried out through [[research]], [[education]], and technical assistance in underprivileged, conflict, and post-trauma/conflict communities around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwbi.org Communities Without Boundaries International Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their work can be found in [[Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nigerianpilot.com/african-university-of-sci-tech-others-mark-mandelas-birthday/ Honoring Nelson Mandela in Nigeria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930203500/http://www.nigerianpilot.com/african-university-of-sci-tech-others-mark-mandelas-birthday/ |date=2013-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Balkans]], [[Turkey]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/news-314530-martin-luther-king-iii-achievements-of-turkey-to-rest-on-what-youth-do.htmlkey Martin Luther King III with CWBI working with Turkey youth]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latin America]], the [[Middle East]], [[South Asia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwbi.org/current-projects/current-projects/nepal/239-article-on-cwbi-peacebuilding-and-development-program-in-purbanchal-national-daily CWBI working in Nepal]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[North America]]. CWBI enters communities to break down social boundaries by creating peaceful bridges. The programs are intended to relieve [[suffering]], increase [[security]], and help people take charge of their lives and their communities.

The techniques employed for accomplishing their work are utilized in community building and community development programs. Constructing local, regional, and international partnerships builds on greater communities for implementing peaceful non-violent social change. Their partnerships are integral for developing and implementing several initiatives: ''From Chaos to Community'' and ''Youth Without Boundaries''. The success of these initiatives led CWBI to speak at the 50th Anniversary [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]].

==History==
[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] called for a [[coalition]] of organizations to bring on new strategies for overcoming barriers enforced by distressed and disadvantaged communities. After his [[Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination|assassination]], organizations emerged with new outlooks on breaking barriers, but many were not considering the power nonviolent social change philosophy could bring to underprivileged and disadvantaged parts of the world.

CWBI's emergence came from two previous organizations looking to grasp the same message from Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1990 [[Coretta Scott King]] established the Center for Community Development to fill the void of her late husband's vision. Seven years later this initiative was launched nationally as the National Institute for Community Empowerment (NICE) by Johnny J. Mack. Their flagship project was the American Cities Project, targeting neighborhoods in major city urban centers across the United States. The goal of the project was community restoration and revitalizing communities through nonviolent social development.

In 2007, NICE was re-articulated and [[Realizing the Dream|Realizing The Dream]] (RTD) was born in collaboration with [[Martin Luther King III]]. RTD was designed to look at the problems and opportunities of the 21st century in freedom, justice, and equality. Simultaneously the organization works towards eliminating poverty, racism and violent conflict in the United States and throughout the World. RTD was eventually subsumed into the [[King Center for Nonviolent Social Change]] in 2010.

In the fall of 2011, CWBI was founded by Johnny Mack, who held responsibility for the launch of both NICE and RTD. He was joined by Dr. Maneshka Eliatamby. CWBI was established to continue the legacy of NICE/RTD. Lessons and strategies were adopted from these campaigns and pursued.

==Initiatives==
CWBI implements its programs with a [[theory of change]] seeking to empower individuals and communities. Community development and community building are at the forefront of this change. Through research, education, [[training]], and technical assistance services, CWBI creates [[sustainable]] changes and positive approaches. All of their work is developed with the philosophy and methodologies of nonviolence.

CWBI has implemented several initiatives all geared to new strategies for approaching community development and community building through nonviolence. These initiatives include ''From Chaos to Community: An International Initiative'', which encompasses their  ''Bridges'', ''Preventing Chaos'', and ''Global Communities Network'' programs, and ''Youth Without Boundaries''.

===From Chaos to Community: An International Initiative===
CWBI works with a network of local partners for engaging conflict and post-conflict communities in [[peacebuilding]]. Through interventions targeting communities with research and education ''From Chaos to Communities'' accomplishes two things. The first is promoting additional change, tolerance, and mutual respect among disparate [[Cultural identity|identity]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[Ethnicity|ethnic]] and [[Religion|religious]] groups. Secondly it enhances the quality of life for target communities establishing a framework for carrying out sustainable development projects. The goal of this initiative is to redress [[poverty]], building community and fostering [[peace]] by engaging targeted communities where [[youth]], [[clergy]], and business leaders work together through community building and community development strategies. The ''Bridges'', ''Preventing Chaos'', and ''Global Communities Network'' all fall within this initiative.

Previous ''From Chaos to Community'' work has been conducted in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia/Herzegovina]], [[India]],  [[Kenya]], [[Nepal]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfQZPvcNJ6I Video for Program trip to Nepal]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sri Lanka]], and the [[United States]].

===''Preventing Chaos''===
This initiative is the violence prevention arm of CWBI. Viewing violence as a strategy employed by groups for positive [[social change]] in their community, CWBI bring together elements from philosophical orientation, [[policies]], programs and projects that foster the elimination or mitigation of the elements producing violent responses. CWBI fashions programs for the challenges and opportunities each specific community may be facing. This initiative promotes individuals and groups to take charge of the peace, [[security]], and [[safety]] of their communities.

===''Global Communities Network''===
The ''Global Communities Network'' is CWBI's partnership with communities within the United States and around the world utilized for carrying out its objectives. They are the principal sponsors and/or collaborators in building and sustaining their community empowerment theory of change. They represent the framework for CWBI to achieve its work in community development and community building. This network comprises [[civil society]] networks, nonprofits, foundations, and universities, all promoting nonviolence in tangible ways.

The same network is responsible for helping CWBI place [[Internships|interns]] and YWB members. CWBI's partnership with these organizations is to effect mutually reinforcing capacity among its membership. Access to the network provides organizational development, leadership development, and resource development training and technical assistance.

===Youth Without Boundaries (YWB)===
This initiative brings together youth (ages 18–35) from around the world to travel and experience other [[culture]]s, lifestyles, and challenges their peers around the world face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scar.gmu.edu/event/2013-brown-bag-series Youth Without Boundaries]&lt;/ref&gt; CWBI promotes the role of youth in the world, YWB is therefore designed to put youth at the center of program development in their own countries, where they serve, collaborate, and engage in dialogue with their own communities. Young leadership is important in the future for building peace at global, regional, or local levels through means of nonviolence, civic responsibility, and intercultural collaboration. Selected participants of YWB develop leadership skills consistent with nonviolent philosophy while expanding their vision of the world's realities and possibilities.

YWB has members participating in [[Afghanistan]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia/Herzegovina]], [[Cameroon]], [[Colombia]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Kenya]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mali]], [[Nepal]], [[Nigeria]], [[Pakistan]], [[Rwanda]], [[South Africa]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[United States]], and [[Zimbabwe]].

==National Action to Realize the Dream==
In 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://scar.gmu.edu/newsletter-subject/national-action-realize-dream National Action to Realize the Dream]&lt;/ref&gt; CWBI joined an alliance of other organizations advocating in issues from [[Labour movement|labor]], [[civil rights]] and [[human rights]], education, [[New media|media]], and housing, to march on Washington since Martin Luther King Jr.'s historic [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|1963 March on Washington]]. The event was to bring the American peoples attention to a variety of issues in the United States. These include worker's rights, immigration, LGBT equality, and women's rights.

CWBI's Johnny Mack, Maneshka Eliatamby, and members of their YWB initiative spoke in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]], 50 years after Martin Luther King Jr. gave his legendary [[I Have a Dream|'I Have a Dream' speech]]. Calling on over 20,000 individuals present, Mack and Eliatamby asked to not forget Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision of [[Liberty|freedom]], [[justice]], and [[Social equality|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Maneshka Eliatamby Speaking at 50th Anniversary March on Washington, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRESsxUhSks] 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasizing the importance of youth, they launched a new challenge to raise the consciousness of the world for quality education, jobs, and peaceful communities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15237">'''Condorcet's jury theorem''' is a [[political science]] theorem about the relative probability of a given group of individuals arriving at a correct decision. The theorem was first expressed by the [[Marquis de Condorcet]] in his 1785 work ''Essay on the Application of Analysis to the Probability of Majority Decisions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k417181
| title=Essai sur l'application de l'analyse à la probabilité des décisions rendues à la pluralité des voix
| format=PNG
| language=French
| accessdate=2008-03-10
| author=Marquis de Condorcet
| authorlink=Marquis de Condorcet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assumptions of the simplest version of the theorem are that a group wishes to reach a decision by majority vote. One of the two outcomes of the vote is ''correct'', and each voter has an independent probability ''p'' of voting for the correct decision. The theorem asks how many voters we should include in the group. The result depends on whether ''p'' is greater than or less than 1/2:

* If ''p'' is greater than 1/2 (each voter is more likely to vote correctly), then adding more voters increases the probability that the majority decision is correct. In the limit, the probability that the majority votes correctly approaches 1 as the number of voters increases.
* On the other hand, if ''p'' is less than 1/2 (each voter is more likely to vote incorrectly), then adding more voters makes things worse: the optimal jury consists of a single voter.

== Proof ==

To avoid the need for a tie-breaking rule, we assume ''n'' is odd. Essentially the same argument works for even ''n'' if ties are broken by fair coin-flips.

Now suppose we start with ''n'' voters, and let ''m'' of these voters vote correctly.

Consider what happens when we add two more voters (to keep the total number odd). The majority vote changes in only two cases:

* ''m'' was one vote too small to get a majority of the ''n'' votes, but both new voters voted correctly.
* ''m'' was just equal to a majority of the ''n'' votes, but both new voters voted incorrectly.

The rest of the time, either the new votes cancel out, only increase the gap, or don't make enough of a difference. So we only care what happens when a single vote (among the first ''n'') separates a correct from an incorrect majority.

Restricting our attention to this case, we can imagine that the first ''n''-1 votes cancel out and that the deciding vote is cast by the ''n''-th voter. In this case the probability of getting a correct majority is just ''p''. Now suppose we send in the two extra voters. The probability that they change an incorrect majority to a correct majority is (1-''p'')''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while the probability that they change a correct majority to an incorrect majority is ''p''(1-''p'')(1-''p''). The first of these probabilities is greater than the second if and only if ''p'' &gt; 1/2, proving the theorem.

== Alternative proof ==
This proof is direct; it just sums up the probabilities of the majorities. Each term of the sum multiplies the number of [[combination]]s of a majority by the [[probability#Mathematical treatment|probability]] of that majority. Each majority is counted using a [[combination]], ''n'' items taken ''k'' at a time, where ''n'' is the jury size, and ''k'' is the size of the majority. Probabilities range from 0, the vote is always wrong, to 1, always right. Each person decides independently, so the probabilities of their decisions multiply.  The probability of each correct decision is ''p''. The probability of an incorrect decision, ''q'', is the opposite of ''p'', i.e. 1 − ''p''. The power notation, i.e. &lt;math&gt;p^x&lt;/math&gt; is a shorthand for ''x'' multiplications of ''p''.

Committee or jury accuracies can be easily estimated by using this approach in computer spreadsheets or programs.

First lets take the simplest case of ''n'' = 3, ''p'' = 0.8. We need to show that 3 people have higher than 0.8 chance of being right. Indeed:
: 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.8 + 0.8 × 0.8 × 0.2 + 0.8 × 0.2 × 0.8 + 0.2 × 0.8 × 0.8 = 0.896.

Now lets take ''n'' = 9 (the general case works the same). Following the same considerations as in the ''n'' = 3 case, we need to select all options for majorities and multiply by respective ''p'' or ''q'' = 1 − ''p''. So we need to show:
:&lt;math&gt;\tbinom{9}{5} p^5 q^4 + \tbinom{9}{6} p^6 q^3 + \ldots + \tbinom{9}{9} p^9 &gt; p,&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. we need to show
:&lt;math&gt;\tbinom{9}{5} p^4 q^4 + \tbinom{9}{6} p^5 q^3 + \tbinom{9}{7} p^6 q^2 + \tbinom{9}{8} p^7 q^1 + \tbinom{9}{9} p^8 &gt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;
But
:&lt;math&gt;\tbinom{9}{5} p^4 q^4 + \tbinom{9}{6} p^5 q^3 + \tbinom{9}{7} p^6 q^2 + \tbinom{9}{8} p^7 q^1 + \tbinom{9}{9} p^8 &gt; \tbinom{9}{4} p^4 q^4 + \tbinom{9}{5} p^5 q^3 + \tbinom{9}{6} p^6 q^2 + \tbinom{9}{7} p^7 q^1 + \tbinom{9}{8} p^8&lt;/math&gt;
(reducing denominator by 1 in binomial coefficient)
:&lt;math&gt;\ldots &gt; \left[\tbinom{8}{4} p^4 q^4 + \tbinom{8}{5} p^5 q^3 + \tbinom{8}{6} p^6 q^2 + \tbinom{8}{7} p^7 q^1 + \tbinom{8}{8}p^8\right] + \left[\tbinom{8}{4} p^4 q^4 + \tbinom{8}{5} p^5 q^3 + \tbinom{8}{6} p^6 q^2 + \tbinom{8}{7} p^7 q^1 + \tbinom{8}{8}p^8\right]&lt;/math&gt;
(reducing nominator and instead multiply by 2)
:&lt;math&gt;\ldots &gt; \left[\tbinom{8}{4} p^4 q^4 + \tbinom{8}{5} p^5 q^3 + \tbinom{8}{6} p^6 q^2 + \tbinom{8}{7} p^7 q^1 + \tbinom{8}{8} p^8 + \tbinom{8}{4} q^4 p^4 + \tbinom{8}{5} q^5 p^3 + \tbinom{8}{6} q^6 p^2 + \tbinom{8}{7} q^7 p^1 + \tbinom{8}{8} q^8\right]&lt;/math&gt;
(swapping ''p'' by ''q'' &lt; ''p'' in last four terms)
:&lt;math&gt;\ldots &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt; (using the polynomial expansion of &lt;math&gt;1 = (p + q)^8&lt;/math&gt;).

== Asymptotics ==

The probability of a correct majority decision ''P''(''n'', ''p''), when the individual probability ''p'' is close to 1/2 grows linearly in terms of ''p'' − 1/2. For ''n'' voters each one having probability ''p'' of deciding correctly and for odd ''n'' (where there are no possible ties):

:&lt;math&gt;P(n, p) = 1/2 + c_1 (p - 1/2) + c_3 (p - 1/2)^3 + O\big( (p - 1/2)^5 \big),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;c_1 = {n \choose {\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}} \frac{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor + 1}{4^{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}} = \sqrt{\frac{2n + 1}{\pi}} \left(1 + \frac{1}{16n^2} + O(n^{-3})\right),&lt;/math&gt;

and the asymptotic approximation in terms of ''n'' is very accurate.  The expansion is only in odd powers and &lt;math&gt;c_3 &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. In simple terms, this says that when the decision is difficult (''p'' close to 1/2), the gain by having ''n'' voters grows proportionally to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;.

== The non-asymptotic part of Condorcet's jury theorem does not hold for correlated votes ==

In a jury comprising an odd number of jurors &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be the probability of a juror voting for the correct alternative and &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; be the (second-order) ''[[Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient|correlation coefficient]]'' between any two correct votes. If all higher-order correlation coefficients in the Bahadur&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
| last       = Bahadur
| first      = R.R.
| title      = A representation of the joint distribution of responses to n dichotomous items

}}&lt;/ref&gt; representation of the joint probability distribution of votes equal to zero, and &lt;math&gt;(p,c)\in\mathcal{B}_n&lt;/math&gt; is an admissible pair, then:

The probability of the jury collectively reaching the correct decision (Condorcet probability) under simple majority is given by:

&lt;math&gt;P(n,p,c)=I_p\left(\frac{n+1}{2},\frac{n+1}{2}\right)+0.5c(n-1)(0.5-p)\frac{\partial I_p(\frac{n+1}{2},\frac{n+1}{2})}{\partial p}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_p&lt;/math&gt; is the ''[[Beta function|regularized incomplete beta function]]''.

''Example:'' Take a jury of three jurors &lt;math&gt;(n=3)&lt;/math&gt;, with individual competence &lt;math&gt;p=0.55&lt;/math&gt; and second-order correlation &lt;math&gt;c=0.4&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;P(3,0.55,0.4)=0.54505&lt;/math&gt;. The competence of the jury is lower than the competence of a single juror, which equals to &lt;math&gt;0.55&lt;/math&gt;. Moreover, enlarging the jury by two jurors &lt;math&gt;(n=5)&lt;/math&gt; decreases the jury competence &lt;math&gt;P(5,0.55,0.4)=0.5196194&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that &lt;math&gt;p=0.55&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c=0.4&lt;/math&gt; is an admissible pair of parameters. For &lt;math&gt;n=5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p=0.55&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum admissible second-order correlation coefficient equals &lt;math&gt;\approx 0.43&lt;/math&gt;.

The above example shows that when the individual competence is low but the correlation is high

#The collective competence under simple majority may fall below that of a single juror,
#Enlarging the jury may decrease its collective competence.

The above result is due to Kaniovski and Zaigraev,&lt;ref&gt;

== Limitations ==

This version of the theorem is correct, given its assumptions, but its assumptions are unrealistic in practice. Some objections that are commonly raised:

* Real votes are not independent, and do not have uniform probabilities. The non-asymptotic part of Condorcet's jury theorem does not hold for correlated votes in general. This is not necessarily a problem since the theorem may still hold under sufficiently general assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;see for example: {{cite journal |title=The Condorcet Jury Theorem, Free Speech, and Correlated Votes |author=Krishna K.

* The notion of "correctness" may not be meaningful when making policy decisions as opposed to deciding questions of fact.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Some defenders of the theorem hold that it is applicable when voting is aimed at determining which policy best promotes the public good, rather than at merely expressing individual preferences. On this reading, what the theorem says is that although each member of the electorate may only have a vague perception of which of two policies is better, majority voting has an amplifying effect. The "group competence level", as represented by the probability that the majority chooses the better alternative, increases towards 1 as the size of the electorate grows assuming that each voter is more often right than wrong.
* The theorem doesn't directly apply to decisions between more than two outcomes. This critical limitation was in fact recognized by Condorcet (see [[Condorcet's paradox]]), and in general it is very difficult to reconcile individual decisions between three or more outcomes (see [[Arrow's theorem]]), although List and Goodin present evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1111/1467-9760.00128 |journal=Journal of Political Philosophy |volume=9 |issue=3 |pages=277–306 |date=September 2001 | url=http://personal.lse.ac.uk/LIST/PDF-files/listgoodin.pdf | format=PDF | title=Epistemic democracy : generalizing the Condorcet Jury Theorem | author= Christian List and Robert Goodin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This limitation may also be overcome by means of a sequence of votes on pairs of alternatives, as is commonly realized via the legislative amendment process. (However, as per Arrow's theorem, this creates a "path dependence" on the exact sequence of pairs of alternatives; e.g., which amendment is proposed first can make a difference in what amendment is ultimately passed, or if the law—with or without amendments—is passed at all.)
* The behaviour that everybody in the jury votes according to his own beliefs might not be a [[Nash equilibrium]] under certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Austen-Smith |first1=David |first2=Jeffrey S. |last2=Banks |year=1996 |title=Information aggregation, rationality, and the Condorcet Jury Theorem |journal=American Political Science Review
|volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=34–45 |jstor=2082796 |doi=10.2307/2082796}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Condorcet's jury theorem provides a theoretical basis for [[democracy]], even if somewhat idealized, as well as a basis of the decision of [[question of fact|questions of fact]] by [[jury trial]], and as such continues to be studied by political scientists.

== The theorem in other disciplines ==
The Condorcet jury theorem has recently been used to conceptualize score integration when several physician readers (radiologists, endoscopists, etc.) independently evaluate images for disease activity. This task arises in central reading performed during clinical trials and has similarities to voting. According to the authors, the application of the theorem can translate individual reader scores into a final score in a fashion that is both mathematically sound (by avoiding averaging of ordinal data), mathematically tractable for further analysis, and in a manner that is consistent with the scoring task at hand (based on decisions about the presence or absence of features, a subjective classification task)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gottlieb|first=Klaus|last2=Hussain|first2=Fez|date=2015-02-19|title=Voting for Image Scoring and Assessment (VISA) - theory and application of a 2 + 1 reader algorithm to improve accuracy of imaging endpoints in clinical trials|journal=BMC Medical Imaging|volume=15|doi=10.1186/s12880-015-0049-0|issn=1471-2342|pmc=4349725|pmid=25880066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Condorcet jury theorem is also used in [[ensemble learning]] in the field of [[machine learning]]. An ensemble method combines the predictions of many individual classifiers by majority voting. Assuming that each of the individual classifiers predict with slightly greater than 50% accuracy, then the ensemble of their predictions will be far greater than their individual predictive scores.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7469">'''Customary international humanitarian law''' is a body of unwritten [[rule of law|rules]] of [[public international law]], which govern conduct during [[armed conflict]].

==Customary international law==
[[Customary international law]], like [[international treaty law]], is recognized as a primary source of public international law. While international treaties are written agreements by which States establish certain rules, customary international law consists of unwritten rules which derive from “general practice accepted as law”.&lt;ref&gt;Article 38(1)(b), Statute of the International Court of Justice&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, for a rule of international custom to be established, two elements are required: “an objective one, the repeated behaviour of States ... and a subjective one, the belief that such behaviour depends on a legal obligation (''[[opinio juris sive necessitatis]]'')”.&lt;ref&gt;Tullio Treves, ‘Customary International Law’, in R. Wolfrum (Ed.), [http://www.mpepil.com The Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law] (online edition), Oxford University Press, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The objective element is also often referred to as State practice; the subjective element as opinio juris.

==International humanitarian law==
{{see also|International human rights instruments}}
[[International humanitarian law]] (IHL), also known as the [[law of war]] or the law of armed conflict, is the area of public international law which aims, “for humanitarian reasons, to limit the effects of armed conflict. It protects persons who are not or are no longer participating in the hostilities and restricts the means and methods of warfare”.&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;ICRC, [http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/legal-fact-sheet/humanitarian-law-factsheet.htm What is International Humanitarian Law, Legal Fact Sheet].&lt;/ref&gt;

War is as old as mankind and so, in a sense, is IHL. Behaviour during armed conflict “has always been subject to certain principles and customs”, based on the practices of armies around the world.&lt;ref name="factsheet"/&gt; Since the mid-19th century, however, many such rules have been codified by States in international treaties, like the [[Hague Regulations]] and [[Geneva Conventions]].&lt;ref name="treaties"&gt;ICRC, International Humanitarian Law – [http://www.icrc.org/ihl Treaties &amp; documents].&lt;/ref&gt; Not withstanding this increasing codification of IHL, customary rules remain relevant in contemporary armed conflicts.

==Current relevance ==
Customary international humanitarian law complements the protection provided by international humanitarian treaty law in situations of armed conflict. International treaty law only binds States which are party to a particular treaty; customary international law, on the other hand, is, in general, binding on all States. And while some international humanitarian law treaties, such as the 1949 Geneva Conventions, are today universally ratified, this is not the case for all treaties.&lt;ref name="treaties"/&gt; Here, customary international humanitarian law can be used to fill gaps in the protection provided in situations of armed conflict.

Furthermore, many of today's armed conflicts do not take place between States but are of a non-international character. International humanitarian treaty law, however, while highly detailed as regards international armed conflicts, is considerably less developed in relation to non-international armed conflicts. Here, again, customary international humanitarian law can give further guidance.

In 2005, mandated by the States convened at the 26th International Conference of the [[Red Cross and Red Crescent]], and after nearly 10 years of research and consultation, the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) presented a Study on Customary International Humanitarian Law, published by [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;J.-M. Henckaerts and L. Doswald-Beck (eds.), [http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/publication/pcustom.htm Customary International Humanitarian Law], 2 Volumes, Volume I: Rules, Volume II: Practice (Cambridge University Press &amp; ICRC, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Volume I of the study contains 161 rules assessed to be of customary status, most of them applicable in both international and non-international armed conflicts. Volume II presents the practice which forms the basis of the conclusions in Volume I.

Since August 2010, an [http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/home online version of the Study], the ICRC's Customary IHL Database, is also available. Part One of the database reflects Volume I of the print edition of the study. Part Two, based on Volume II of the print edition, presents state practice relating to most aspects of IHL, as expressed in national legislation, military manuals, official statements, and case-law, and the practice of other entities such as international organizations and international courts and tribunals. Part Two is updated regularly through a joint project of the ICRC and the [[British Red Cross Society]], based at the [http://www.lcil.cam.ac.uk/projects/cihl_project.php Lauterpacht Centre for International Law], [[University of Cambridge]].

==Customary law database==
A customary law database, developed in association with the British Red Cross, was launched by the International Committee of the Red Cross in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/home Customary Law database] from the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to be used as a legal reference in international and non-international armed conflicts, including by courts, tribunals and international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2010/treaties-and-customary-law-news-090810.htm New legal database launched to enhance protection for war victims] from the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent&lt;/ref&gt;

The database is updated on a regular basis. A selection of national practice of 30 countries was added in March 2011 followed by an additional 27 countries in November of the same year.  On 13 December 2012, the ICRC made available its updated collection and analysis of practice from 23 countries&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/news-release/2012/12-11-customary-international-humanitarian-law.htm ICRC database on customary international humanitarian law: new update of State practice]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; Argentina, Bangladesh, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, Chad, Chile, Colombia, Croatia, Djibouti, El Salvador, Guatemala, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Serbia, Serbia and Montenegro, Senegal, Spain, Switzerland, Uruguay, and Viet Nam.

'''Declassification''' is the process of documents that used to be [[Classified information|classified]] as secret ceasing to be so restricted, often under the principle of [[freedom of information]].  Procedures for declassification vary by country. Papers may be withheld without being classified as secret, and eventually made available.

==United Kingdom==
{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}
{{see also|Freedom of information in the United Kingdom}}
Classified information has been governed by various Official Secrets Acts, the latest being the [[Official Secrets Act 1989]]. Until 1989 requested information was routinely kept secret invoking the  public interest defence; this was largely removed by the 1989 Act. The [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] largely requires information to be disclosed unless there are good reasons for secrecy.

Confidential government papers such as the yearly cabinet papers used routinely to be withheld formally, although not necessarily classified as secret, for 30 years under the [[thirty year rule]], and released usually on a [[New Year's Day]]; freedom of information legislation has relaxed this rigid approach.

==United States==
{{main|Classified information in the United States#Declassification}}
[[Executive Order 13526]] establishes the mechanisms for most declassifications, within the laws passed by Congress.  The originating agency assigns a declassification date, by default 10 years.  After 25 years declassification review is automatic, with nine narrow exceptions that allow information to continue to be classified.  At 50 years there are two exceptions, and classifications beyond 75 years require special permission.  Because of changes in policy and circumstances, agencies are expected to actively review documents that have been classified for fewer than 25 years.  They must also respond to Mandatory Declassification Review and [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests.  The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] houses the National Declassification Center to coordinate reviews and [[Information Security Oversight Office]] to promulgate rules and enforce quality measures across all agencies.  NARA reviews documents on behalf of defunct agencies and permanently stores declassified documents for public inspection.  The [[Interagency Security Classification Appeals Panel]] has representatives from several agencies.

The '''Democratic League of Bosniaks''' ({{Lang-bs|Demokratski Savez Bošnjaka}}, {{Lang-mk|Демократска лига на Бошњаците}}, ''Demokratska Liga na Bošnjacite'') is a [[political party]] in the [[Republic of Macedonia]], representative of the ethnic [[Bosniaks]] living in the Republic of Macedonia.

At the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2002|legislative elections]] on 15 September 2002, the party won 1 out of 120 seats as part of the Together for Macedonia alliance, led by the [[Social Democratic Union of Macedonia]] and the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Macedonia)|Liberal Democratic Party]]. Uncontended with the positions at the PR lists of Together for Macedonia alliance for the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 parliamentary election]], the DLB has left this coalition and entered the coalition between ethnic Albanian parties [[Democratic Union for Integration]] and [[Party for Democratic Prosperity]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6282">[[Image:dry pond.jpg|thumb|Detention Basin]]
A '''detention basin''' or '''retarding basin''' is an excavated area installed on, or adjacent to, tributaries of [[river]]s, [[stream]]s, [[lake]]s or [[bay]]s to protect against [[flood]]ing and, in some cases, downstream [[erosion]] by storing water for a limited period of time.  These basins are also called "dry ponds", "holding ponds" or "dry detention basins" if no permanent pool of water exists. Some detention ponds are also "wet ponds" in that they are designed to permanently retain some volume of water at all times. In its basic form, a detention basin is used to manage water quantity while having a limited effectiveness in protecting [[water quality]], unless it includes a permanent pool feature.&lt;ref&gt;United States Environmental Protection Agency. Washington, DC.[http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/stormwater/menuofbmps/index.cfm?action=browse&amp;Rbutton=detail&amp;bmp=67 "National Menu of Stormwater Best Management Practices."] Fact Sheet: "Dry Detention Ponds."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions and design==
Detention basins are storm water [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practices]] that provide general flood protection  and can also control extreme floods such as a 1 in 100-year storm event.&lt;ref&gt;Atlanta Regional Commission. Atlanta, GA. [http://www.georgiastormwater.com/vol2/3-4-1.pdf "Georgia Stormwater Management Manual."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410222514/http://www.georgiastormwater.com/vol2/3-4-1.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }} Section 3.4.1: "Dry Detention / Dry ED Basins." August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The basins are typically built during the construction of new land development projects including residential subdivisions or shopping centers.  The ponds help manage the excess [[urban runoff]] generated by newly constructed [[impervious surface]]s such  as [[road]]s, [[parking lot]]s and [[rooftop]]s.

A basin functions by allowing large flows of water to enter but limits the outflow by having a small opening at the lowest point of the structure.  The size of this opening is determined by the capacity of  underground and downstream [[culvert]]s and [[Arroyo (creek)|washes]]  to handle the release of the contained water.&lt;ref&gt;Dykehouse, Terry, P.E. Jones and Edmunds, Gainseville, FL.[http://www.florida-stormwater.org/pdfs/pondsarticle.pdf "Retention Ponds and Detention Ponds, The Recovery Process."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410222514/http://www.florida-stormwater.org/pdfs/pondsarticle.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently the inflow area is constructed to protect the structure from some types of damage.  Offset [[concrete]] blocks in the entrance spillways are used to reduce the speed of entering flood water.  These structures may also have [[debris]] drop vaults to collect large rocks.  These vaults are deep holes under the entrance to the structure.  The holes are wide enough to allow large rocks and other debris to fall into the holes before they can damage the rest of the structure.  These vaults must be emptied after each storm event.

===New approaches===
Research has shown that detention basins built with real-time control of the outflow from the basin are significantly more effective at retaining [[total suspended solids]] and associated contaminants, such as [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metals]], when compared to basins without control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecohydraulic-driven Real-Time Control of Stormwater Basins|url=http://modeleau.fsg.ulaval.ca/fileadmin/modeleau/documents/Publications/pvr862.pdf|work=Universite Laval|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extended detention basin==
A variant basin design called an '''extended detention dry basin''' can limit downstream erosion and control of some [[water pollution|pollutants]] such as [[suspended solids]]. This basin type differs from a [[retention basin]], also known as a "wet pond," which includes a permanent pool of water, and which is typically designed to protect water quality.&lt;ref name="WEF1"&gt;[http://wef.org Water Environment Federation], Alexandria, VA; and [http://www.asce.org American Society of Civil Engineers], Reston, VA. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdU-VXXV_H0C "Urban Runoff Quality Management."] WEF Manual of Practice No. 23; ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No. 87. 1998. {{ISBN|1-57278-039-8}}. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Worth Bagley College. [http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080410222514/http://www.abe.msstate.edu/csd/p-dm/all-chapters/chapter4/chapter4/det-basin.pdf "Detention Basins."] Chapter 4: Best Management Practices. Agricultural and Biological Engineering, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. [http://proteus.pca.state.mn.us/publications/swm-ch5.pdf "Stormwater Detention Ponds."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410222514/http://proteus.pca.state.mn.us/publications/swm-ch5.pdf |date=2008-04-10 }} Chapter 5, Minnesota State Permit Guidance Document.&lt;/ref&gt;

While basic detention ponds are often designed to empty within 6 to 12 hours after a storm, extended detention (ED) dry basins improve on the basic detention design by lengthening the storage time, for example, to 24 or 48 hours. Longer storage times tend to result in improved water quality because  additional suspended solids are removed.&lt;ref name="WEF1" /&gt;

'''Europe Whole and Free''' is an idea in international relations that describes a Europe governed universally by concepts of liberal democracy espoused by the United States and the European Union.

==Origins==

The phrase “Europe whole and free” was first used prominently by U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] in a speech on May 31, 1989, in Mainz, West Germany. Addressing an auditorium full of German citizens and political leaders, including Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], Bush laid out his vision for the Europe that should emerge from the end of the Cold War and the waning of Communist and Soviet influence in Europe’s east. He said:

:“…our responsibility is to look ahead and grasp the promise of the future. I said recently that we're at the end of one era and at the beginning of another. And I noted that in regard to the Soviet Union, our policy is to move beyond containment. For 40 years, the seeds of democracy in Eastern Europe lay dormant, buried under the frozen tundra of the Cold War. And for 40 years, the world has waited for the Cold War to end. And decade after decade, time after time, the flowering human spirit withered from the chill of conflict and oppression; and again, the world waited. But the passion for freedom cannot be denied forever. The world has waited long enough. The time is right. Let Europe be whole and free.”&lt;ref&gt;“A Europe Whole and Free,” Remarks to the Citizens in Mainz, by President George Bush, May 31, 1989. http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/ga6-890531.htm, accessed 5 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush’s formulation was seen by foreign policy analysts, including Jim Hoagland&lt;ref&gt;Jim Hoagland, “Europe’s Destiny,” Foreign Affairs, (1989-90). http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/45145/jim-hoagland/europes-destiny&lt;/ref&gt; and Arnold Horelick,&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Horelick, “U.S.-Soviet Relations: Threshold of a New Era,” Foreign Affairs, 69, 1, (1989-1990). http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/45146/arnold-l-horelick/us-soviet-relations-the-threshold-of-a-new-era&lt;/ref&gt; as Bush’s counter-proposal to the concept of a “common European home” offered in the preceding two years by Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. Within two weeks of Bush’s speech, Gorbachev also visited West Germany and declared that the Soviet Union would not interfere in the liberalizations already underway among its allied states in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;“Gorbachev Blessed NATO’s Army Bases Near Russia’s Border,” http://english.pravda.ru/world/europe/14-06-2009/107768-gorbachev-0/, accessed 5 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; While Gorbachev hoped to encourage liberalizing political and economic reforms among the Soviet-allied communist rulers of Europe’s east, Bush envisioned an end to communist or socialist rule and its replacement by multi-party, liberal democracies with capitalist economic systems.

==Post-Cold War evolution==

Less than seven months after Bush’s speech, popular protests had forced out the communist governments of Eastern Europe, and Bush and Gorbachev had held a summit meeting in Malta (on 2–3 December) that some observers regarded as marking the end of the Cold War.
 
In the decades following the Cold War’s end and the collapse (in 1991) of the Soviet Union, European nations and the United States pursued efforts to end Europe’s Cold War divisions. As former communist East European countries held free elections and chose non-communist governments, the United States and Western European nations agreed to include them within the continent’s main international institutions – the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) – to include former Soviet and Soviet-bloc states.
 
By 2009, NATO had admitted 12 members from formerly communist-ruled Eastern Europe: the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland in 1999; Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004; and Albania and Croatia in 2009. The European Union added 11 such members: Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary in 2004; Bulgaria and Romania in 2007; and Croatia in 2013.
 
Russia opposed the inclusion of Eastern European nations, and especially the formerly Soviet Baltic states,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Blank, “Russian Policy on NATO Expansion In The Baltics,” Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars http://www.wilsoncenter.org/publication/151-russian-policy-nato-expansion-the-baltics, accessed 5 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; within NATO. The Russian government’s opposition hardened under the leadership of [[Vladimir Putin]] (as president during 2000-2008, prime minister during 2008-2012, and again president following 2012).

A '''facial recognition system''' is a technology capable of [[Identification of human individuals|identifying]] or [[Authentication|verifying]] a person from a [[digital image]] or a [[Film frame|video frame]] from a [[video]] source. There are multiple methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected [[Face|facial feature]]s from given image with faces within a [[Database management system|database]]. It is also described as a Biometric Artificial Intelligence based application that can uniquely identify a person by analysing patterns based on the person's facial textures and shape. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/32071/facial-recognition|title=What is Facial Recognition? - Definition from Techopedia|work=Techopedia.com|access-date=2018-08-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}}  

While initially a form of computer [[Application software|application]], it has seen wider uses in recent times on mobile platforms and in other forms of technology, such as robotics. It is typically used as access control in [[Burglar alarm|security systems]] and can be compared to other [[biometrics]] such as [[fingerprint]] or eye [[iris recognition]] systems.&lt;ref name="Animetrics2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animetrics.com/technology/frapplications.html|title=Face Recognition Applications|publisher=Animetrics|accessdate=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the accuracy of facial recognition system as a biometric technology is lower than [[iris recognition]] and [[Fingerprint|fingerprint recognition]], it is widely adopted due to its contactless and non-invasive process.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Jian, Yan, Ke, He, Zhen-Yu, and Xu, Yong (2014). "A Collaborative Linear Discriminative Representation Classification Method for Face Recognition. In ''2014 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering (AISE2014)''. Lancaster, PA: DEStech Publications, Inc. p.21 {{ISBN|9781605951508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, it has also become popular as a commercial identification and marketing tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/privacy/facial-recognition-who-is-tracking-you-in-public1|title=Facial Recognition: Who's Tracking You in Public?|website=Consumer Reports|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other applications include advanced human-computer interaction, video surveillance, automatic indexing of images, and video database, among others.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; 

== History of facial recognition technology ==
Pioneers of automated face recognition include [[Woody Bledsoe]], [[Helen Chan Wolf]], and [[Charles Bisson]].

During 1964 and 1965, Bledsoe, along with Helen Chan and Charles Bisson, worked on using the computer to recognize human faces (Bledsoe 1966a, 1966b; Bledsoe and Chan 1965). He was proud of this work, but because the funding was provided by an unnamed intelligence agency that did not allow much publicity, little of the work was published.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The History of Information Security: A Comprehensive Handbook|last=de Leeuw|first=Karl|last2=Bergstra|first2=Jan|publisher=Elsevier|year=2007|isbn=9780444516084|location=Amsterdam|pages=264-265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the available references, it was revealed that the Bledsoe's initial approach involved the manual marketing of various landmarks on the face such as the eye centers, mouth, etc., and these were mathematically rotated by computer to compensate for pose variation.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The distances between landmarks were also automatically computed and compared between images to determine identity.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Given a large database of images (in effect, a book of mug shots) and a photograph, the problem was to select from the database a small set of records such that one of the image records matched the photograph. The success of the method could be measured in terms of the ratio of the answer list to the number of records in the database. Bledsoe (1966a) described the following difficulties:{{cquote|This recognition problem is made difficult by the great [[Spatial variability|variability]] in head rotation and tilt, [[illuminance|lighting intensity]] and angle, [[facial expression]], aging, etc. Some other attempts at face recognition by machine have allowed for little or no variability in these quantities. Yet the method of correlation (or [[pattern matching]]) of unprocessed optical data, which is often used by some researchers, is certain to fail in cases where the variability is great. In particular, the correlation is very low between two pictures of the same person with two different head rotations.

}}This project was labeled man-machine because the human extracted the coordinates of a set of features from the photographs, which were then used by the computer for recognition. Using a [[graphics tablet]] (GRAFACON or [[RAND Tablet|RAND TABLET]]), the operator would extract the coordinates of features such as the center of pupils, the inside corner of eyes, the outside corner of eyes, point of [[widows peak]], and so on. From these coordinates, a list of 20 distances, such as width of mouth and width of eyes, pupil to pupil, were computed. These operators could process about 40 pictures an hour. When building the database, the name of the person in the photograph was associated with the list of computed distances and stored in the computer. In the recognition phase, the set of distances was compared with the corresponding distance for each photograph, yielding a distance between the photograph and the database record. The closest records are returned.

Because it is unlikely that any two pictures would match in head rotation, lean, tilt, and scale (distance from the camera), each set of distances is normalized to represent the face in a frontal orientation. To accomplish this normalization, the program first tries to determine the tilt, the lean, and the rotation. Then, using these angles, the computer undoes the effect of these transformations on the computed distances. To compute these angles, the computer must know the three-dimensional geometry of the head. Because the actual heads were unavailable, Bledsoe (1964) used a standard head derived from measurements on seven heads.

After Bledsoe left PRI in 1966, this work was continued at the [[Stanford Research Institute]], primarily by [[Peter E. Hart|Peter Hart]]. In experiments performed on a database of over 2000 photographs, the computer consistently outperformed humans when presented with the same recognition tasks (Bledsoe 1968). Peter Hart (1996) enthusiastically recalled the project with the exclamation, "It really worked!"

By about 1997, the system developed by Christoph von der Malsburg and [[Graduate student|graduate students]] of the [[University of Bochum]] in Germany and the [[University of Southern California]] in the United States outperformed most systems with those of [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] rated next. The Bochum system was developed through funding by the [[United States Army Research Laboratory]]. The [[software]] was sold as [[ZN-Face]] and used by customers such as [[Deutsche Bank]] and operators of [[Airport|airports]] and other busy locations. The software was "robust enough to make identifications from less-than-perfect face views. It can also often see through such impediments to identification as mustaches, beards, changed hair styles and glasses—even sunglasses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1997/11/971112070100.htm|title=Mugspot Can Find A Face In The Crowd -- Face-Recognition Software Prepares To Go To Work In The Streets|date=12 November 1997|accessdate=2007-11-06|publisher=ScienceDaily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the performance of the latest face recognition algorithms were evaluated in the [[Face Recognition Grand Challenge (FRGC)]]. High-resolution face images, 3-D face scans, and iris images were used in the tests. The results indicated that the new algorithms are 10 times more accurate than the face recognition algorithms of 2002 and 100 times more accurate than those of 1995. Some of the algorithms were able to outperform human participants in recognizing faces and could uniquely identify identical twins.&lt;ref name="Williams2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/Infotech/18796/?a=f|title=Better Face-Recognition Software|last=Williams|first=Mark|accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SIAM2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siam.org/news/news.php?id=309|title=The Mathematics of Face Recognition|author=R. Kimmel and G. Sapiro|date=30 April 2003|publisher=SIAM News|accessdate=2003-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. Government-sponsored evaluations and challenge problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/ig/face.cfm|title=Face Homepage|work=nist.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; have helped spur over two orders-of-magnitude in face-recognition system performance. Since 1993, the error rate of automatic face-recognition systems has decreased by a factor of 272. The reduction applies to systems that match people with face images captured in studio or mugshot environments. In [[Moore's law]] terms, the error rate decreased by one-half every two years.&lt;ref name="Crawford2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spie.org/x57306.xml|title=Facial recognition progress report|last=Crawford|first=Mark|publisher=''SPIE Newsroom''|accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low-resolution images of faces can be enhanced using [[face hallucination]].

==Techniques for face acquisition==
Essentially, the process of face recognition is performed in two steps. The first involves feature extraction and selection and, the second is the classification of objects.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Artificial Intelligence in Theory and Practice: IFIP 19th World Computer Congress, TC 12: IFIP AI 2006 Stream, August 21-24, 2006, Santiago, Chile|last=Bramer|first=Max|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2006|isbn=9780387346540|location=Berlin|pages=395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later developments introduced varying technologies to the procedure. Some of the most notable include the following techniques:

===Traditional===
Some face recognition [[algorithms]] identify facial features by extracting landmarks, or features, from an image of the subject's face. For example, an algorithm may analyze the relative position, size, and/or shape of the eyes, nose, cheekbones, and jaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsid.com/company/technology/face-recognition|title=Airport Facial Recognition Passenger Flow Management|work=hrsid.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These  features are then used to search for other images with matching features.&lt;ref name="Bonsor2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/facial-recognition.htm|title=How Facial Recognition Systems Work|last=Bonsor|first=K.|accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other algorithms [[Normalization (image processing)|normalize]] a gallery of face images and then compress the face data, only saving the data in the image that is useful for face recognition. A probe image is then compared with the face data.&lt;ref name="Smith2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biometrics.gov/Documents/FaceRec.pdf|title=Face Recognition|last=Smith|first=Kelly|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest successful systems&lt;ref&gt;R. Brunelli and T. Poggio, "Face Recognition: Features versus Templates", IEEE Trans. on PAMI, 1993, (15)10:1042-1052&lt;/ref&gt; is based on template matching techniques&lt;ref&gt;R. Brunelli, ''Template Matching Techniques in Computer Vision: Theory and Practice'', Wiley, {{ISBN|978-0-470-51706-2}}, 2009 ''([http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470517069.html] TM book)''&lt;/ref&gt; applied to a set of salient facial features, providing a sort of compressed face representation.

Recognition algorithms can be divided into two main approaches, geometric, which looks at distinguishing features, or photometric, which is a statistical approach that distills an image into values and compares the values with templates to eliminate variances. Some classify these algorithms into two broad categories: holistic and feature-based models. The former attempts to recognize the face in its entirety while the feature-based subdivide into components such as according to features and analyze each as well as its spatial location with respect to other features.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Biometrics: International Conference, ICB 2006, Hong Kong, China, January 5-7, 2006, Proceedings|last=Zhang|first=David|last2=Jain|first2=Anil|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2006|isbn=9783540311119|location=Berlin|pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular recognition algorithms include [[principal component analysis]] using [[Eigenface|eigenfaces]], [[linear discriminant analysis]], [[Elastic matching|elastic bunch graph matching]] using the Fisherface algorithm, the [[hidden Markov model]], the [[multilinear subspace learning]] using [[tensor]] representation, and the neuronal motivated [[dynamic link matching]].

=== 3-Dimensional recognition {{anchor|3-D}} ===
[[Three-dimensional face recognition]] technique uses 3D sensors to capture information about the shape of a face. This information is then used to identify distinctive features on the surface of a face, such as the contour of the eye sockets, nose, and chin.&lt;ref name="Williams2" /&gt;

One advantage of 3D face recognition is that it is not affected by changes in lighting like other techniques. It can also identify a face from a range of viewing angles, including a profile view.&lt;ref name="Bonsor2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2" /&gt; Three-dimensional data points from a face vastly improve the precision of face recognition. 3D research is enhanced by the development of sophisticated sensors that do a better job of capturing 3D face imagery. The sensors work by projecting structured light onto the face. Up to a dozen or more of these image sensors can be placed on the same CMOS chip—each sensor captures a different part of the spectrum....&lt;ref name="Crawford2" /&gt;

Even a perfect 3D matching technique could be sensitive to expressions. For that goal a group at the [[Technion]] applied tools from [[metric geometry]] to treat expressions as [[isometries]]&lt;ref name="Kimmel2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~ron/PAPERS/BroBroKimIJCV05.pdf|title=Three-dimensional face recognition|last=Kimmel|first=Ron|accessdate=2005-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new method is to introduce a way to capture a 3D picture by using three tracking cameras that point at different angles; one camera will be pointing at the front of the subject, second one to the side, and third one at an angle. All these cameras will work together so it can track a subject’s face in real time and be able to face detect and recognize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4430529&amp;tag=1|title=Three-View Surveillance Video Based Face Modeling for Recognition|last1=Duhn|first1=S. von|last2=Ko|first2=M. J.|date=1 September 2007|publisher=|pages=1–6|via=IEEE Xplore|doi=10.1109/BCC.2007.4430529|last3=Yin|first3=L.|last4=Hung|first4=T.|last5=Wei|first5=X.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Skin texture analysis ===
Another emerging trend uses the visual details of the skin, as captured in standard digital or scanned images. This technique, called Skin Texture Analysis, turns the unique lines, patterns, and spots apparent in a person’s skin into a mathematical space.&lt;ref name="Bonsor2" /&gt;

Surface Texture Analysis, works much the same way facial recognition does. A picture is taken of a patch of skin, called a [[skinprint]]. That patch is then broken up into smaller blocks. Using algorithms to turn the patch into a mathematical, measurable space, the system will then distinguish any lines, pores and the actual skin texture. It can identify contrast between identical pairs, which are not yet possible using facial recognition software alone.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/facial-recognition3.htm|title=How Facial Recognition Systems Work|date=2001-09-04|work=HowStuffWorks|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tests have shown that with the addition of skin texture analysis, performance in recognizing faces can increase 20 to 25 percent.&lt;ref name="Bonsor2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Williams2" /&gt;

=== Facial recognition combining different techniques ===
As every method has its advantages and disadvantages, technology companies have amalgamated the traditional, 3D recognition and Skin Textual Analysis, to create recognition systems that have higher rates of success.

Combined techniques has an advantage over other systems. It is relatively insensitive to changes in expression, including blinking, frowning or smiling and has the ability to compensate for mustache or beard growth and the appearance of eyeglasses. The system is also uniform with respect to race and gender.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Thermal cameras ===
A different form of taking input data for face recognition is by using thermal cameras, by this procedure the cameras will only detect the shape of the head and it will ignore the subject accessories such as glasses, hats, or make up.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Unlike conventional cameras, thermal cameras can capture facial imagery even in low-light and nighttime conditions without using a flash and exposing the position of the camera.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.azorobotics.com/News.aspx?newsID=9840|title=Army Builds Face Recognition Technology that Works in Low-Light Conditions|last=|first=|date=April 18, 2018|work=AZoRobotics|access-date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a problem with using thermal pictures for face recognition is that the databases for face recognition is limited. Diego Socolinsky, and Andrea Selinger (2004) research the use of thermal face recognition in real life, and operation sceneries, and at the same time build a new database of thermal face images. The research uses low-sensitive, low-resolution ferro-electric electrics sensors that are capable of acquire long wave thermal infrared (LWIR). The results show that a fusion of LWIR and regular visual cameras has the greater results in outdoor probes. Indoor results show that visual has a 97.05% accuracy, while LWIR has 93.93%, and the Fusion has 98.40%, however on the outdoor proves visual has 67.06%, LWIR 83.03%, and fusion has 89.02%. The study used 240 subjects over the period of 10 weeks to create the new database. The data was collected on sunny, rainy, and cloudy days.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1896300.1896448|title=Thermal Face Recognition in an Operational Scenario|last1=Socolinsky|first1=Diego A.|last2=Selinger|first2=Andrea|date=1 January 2004|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|pages=1012–1019|via=ACM Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, researchers from the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL)]] developed a technique that would allow them to match facial imagery obtained using a thermal camera with those in databases that were captured using a conventional camera. This approach utilized [[artificial intelligence]] and [[machine learning]] to allow researchers to visibly compare conventional and thermal facial imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.arl.army.mil/www/default.cfm?article=3199|title=Army develops face recognition technology that works in the dark|last=|first=|date=April 16, 2018|work=Army Research Laboratory|access-date=August 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Known as a cross-spectrum synthesis method due to how it bridges facial recognition from two different imaging modalities, this method synthesize a single image by analyzing multiple facial regions and details.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggan|first=Benjamin|last2=Short|first2=Nathaniel|last3=Hu|first3=Shuowen|date=March 2018|title=Thermal to Visible Synthesis of Face Images using Multiple Regions|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323932058_Thermal_to_Visible_Synthesis_of_Face_Images_using_Multiple_Regions|journal=ResearchGate|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a non-linear regression model that maps a specific thermal image into a corresponding visible facial image and an optimization issue that projects the latent projection back into the image space.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

ARL scientists have noted that the approach works by combining global information (i.e. features across the entire face) with local information (i.e. features regarding the eyes, nose, and mouth). In addition to enhancing the discriminability of the synthesized image, the facial recognition system can be used to transform a thermal face signature into a refined visible image of a face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=U.S. Army's AI facial recognition works in the dark|last=Cole|first=Sally|date=June 2018|work=Military Embedded Systems|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to performance tests conducted at ARL, researchers found that the multi-region cross-spectrum synthesis model demonstrated a performance improvement of about 30% over baseline methods and about 5% over state-of-the-art methods. It has also been tested for landmark detection for thermal images.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Application ==

=== Mobile platforms ===

==== Social media ====
[[Social media]] platforms have adopted facial recognition capabilities to diversify their functionalities in order to attract a wider user base amidst stiff competition from different applications.

Founded in 2013, [[Looksery]] went on to raise money for its face modification app on Kickstarter. After successful crowdfunding, [[Looksery]] launched in October 2014. The application allows video chat with others through a special filter for faces that modifies the look of users. While there are image augmenting applications such as [[Facetune|FaceTune]] and Perfect365, they are limited to static images, whereas Looksery allowed augmented reality to live videos. In late 2015, SnapChat purchased Looksery, which would then become its landmark lenses function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.sg/snapchat-buys-looksery-2015-9/|title=Snapchat buys Looksery, a 2-year-old startup that lets you Photoshop your face while you video chat|last=Shontell|first=Alyson|date=2015-09-15|work=Business Insider Singapore|access-date=2018-04-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Snap Inc.|SnapChat]]'s animated lenses, which used facial recognition technology, revolutionized and redefined the selfie, by allowing users to add filters to change the way they look. The selection of filters changes every day, some examples include one that make users look like an old and wrinkled version of themselves, one that airbrushes their skin, and one that places a virtual flower crown on top of their head. The dog filter is the most popular filter that helped propelled the continual success of SnapChat, with popular celebrities such as [[Gigi Hadid]], [[Kim Kardashian]] and the likes regularly posting videos of themselves with the dog filter. 

[[DeepFace]] is a [[deep learning]] [[facial recognition system]] created by a research group at [[Facebook]]. It identifies human faces in digital images. It employs a nine-layer [[neural net]] with over 120 million connection weights, and was [[Machine learning|trained]] on four million images uploaded by Facebook users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/525586/facebook-creates-software-that-matches-faces-almost-as-well-as-you-do/|title=Facebook Creates Software That Matches Faces Almost as Well as You Do|last=Simonite|first=Tom|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebooks-deepface-shows-serious-facial-recognition-skills/|title=Facebook's DeepFace shows serious facial recognition skills|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is said to be 97% accurate, compared to 85% for the FBI's [[Next Generation Identification]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/7/5878069/why-facebook-is-beating-the-fbi-at-facial-recognition|title=Why Facebook is beating the FBI at facial recognition|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the creators of the software, Yaniv Taigman, came to Facebook via their 2007 acquisition of [[Face.com]].

==== ID Verification Solutions ====
An emerging use of Facial recognition is in use of ID verification services. Many companies are working in market now to provide these services to banks, ICOs and other e-businesses. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2018/07/24/bank-branch-future/796748002/|title=A glimpse at bank branches of the future: video walls, booth-sized locations and 24/7 access|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Face ID ====
[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] introduced [[Face ID]] on the flagship iPhone X as a biometric authentication successor to the Touch ID, a fingerprint based system. Face ID has a facial recognition sensor that consists of two parts: a "Romeo" module that projects more than 30,000 infrared dots onto the user's face, and a "Juliet" module that reads the pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-iphone-x-production-woe-sparked-by-juliet-and-her-romeo-1506510189|title=Apple iPhone X Production Woe Sparked by Juliet and Her Romeo|last=Kubota|first=Yoko|date=2017-09-27|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern is sent to a local "Secure Enclave" in the device's [[central processing unit]] (CPU) to confirm a match with the phone owner's face.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/12/16298156/apple-iphone-x-face-id-security-privacy-police-unlock|title=The five biggest questions about Apple’s new facial recognition system|work=The Verge|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The facial pattern is not accessible by Apple. The system will not work with eyes closed, in an effort to prevent unauthorized access.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The technology learns from changes in a user's appearance, and therefore works with hats, scarves, glasses and many sunglasses, beard and makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.macrumors.com/2017/09/14/face-id-works-with-sunglasses-thwarts-thieves/|title=Apple's Face ID Feature Works With Most Sunglasses, Can Be Quickly Disabled to Thwart Thieves|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also works in the dark. This is done by using a "Flood Illuminator", which is a dedicated infrared flash that throws out invisible infrared light onto the user's face to properly read the 30,000 facial points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bgr.com/2017/11/03/iphone-x-face-id-video-infrared/|title=Infrared video shows off the iPhone X’s new Face ID feature in action|last=Heisler|first=Yoni|date=2017-11-03|work=BGR|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Deployment in security services ===

==== Policing ====
The [[Australian Border Force]] and New Zealand Customs Services have set up an automated border processing system called [[SmartGate]] that uses face recognition, which compares the face of the traveller with the data in the [[Biometric passport|e-passport]] microchip.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.customs.govt.nz/features/smartgate/howsmartgateworks/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Major Canadian airports will be using a new facial recognition program as part of the Primary Inspection Kiosk program that will compare people's faces to their passports. This program will first come to [[Ottawa International Airport]] in early 2017 and to other airports in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/cbsa-canada-airports-facial-recognition-kiosk-biometrics-1.4007344|title=Facial recognition technology is coming to Canadian airports this spring|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-03-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tocumen International Airport]] in Panama operates an airport-wide surveillance system using hundreds of live face recognition cameras to identify wanted individuals passing through the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ihsairport360.com/article/4812/panama-puts-names-to-more-faces|title=Panama puts names to more faces|last=Vogel|first=Ben|accessdate=2014-10-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012185226/http://www.ihsairport360.com/article/4812/panama-puts-names-to-more-faces|archivedate=12 October 2014|deadurl=no|publisher=IHS Jane's Airport Review|quote=Under the USD11 million contract, a cluster of sixty computers, a fibre optic network, and 150 surveillance cameras were installed in the terminal and at about 30 gates.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police forces in the [[United Kingdom]] have been trialling live facial recognition technology at public events since 2015. However, a recent report and investigation by [[Big Brother Watch]] found that these systems were up to 98% inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bigbrotherwatch.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Face-Off-final-digital-1.pdf|title=Face Off: The lawless growth of facial recognition in UK policing|last=|first=Big Brother Watch|date=|website=Big Brother Watch|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National security ====
The [[U.S. Department of State]] operates one of the largest face recognition systems in the world with a database of 117 million American adults, with photos typically drawn from driver's license photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fortune.com/2016/10/18/facial-recognition-database/|title=Here's How Many Adult Faces Are Scanned From Facial Recognition Databases|last=FORTUNE|first=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is still far from completion, it is being put to use in certain cities to give clues as to who was in the photo. The FBI uses the photos as an investigative tool not for positive identification.&lt;ref name="phys.org2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-12-facial-recognition-technology-real-world.html|title=The trouble with facial recognition technology (in the real world)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2016, facial recognition was being used to identify people in photos taken by police in [[San Diego]] and [[Los Angeles]] (not on real-time video, and only against booking photos)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2018/05/10/609422158/real-time-facial-recognition-is-available-but-will-u-s-police-buy-it Real-Time Facial Recognition Is Available, But Will U.S. Police Buy It?]&lt;/ref&gt; and use was planned in [[West Virginia]] and [[Dallas]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2016/10/23/499042369/police-facial-recognition-databases-log-about-half-of-americans Police Facial Recognition Databases Log About Half Of Americans]&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years Maryland has used face recognition by comparing people's faces to their driver's license photos. The system drew controversy when it was used in Baltimore to arrest unruly protesters after the [[death of Freddie Gray]] in police custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-facial-recognition-20161017-story.html|title=Maryland's use of facial recognition software questioned by researchers, civil liberties advocates|last=Knezevich|first=Kevin Rector, Alison|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other states are using or developing a similar system however some states have laws prohibiting its use.

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] has also instituted its [[Next Generation Identification]] program to include face recognition, as well as more traditional biometrics like fingerprints and iris scans, which can pull from both criminal and civil databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/fingerprints_biometrics/ngi|title=Next Generation Identification|website=FBI|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Time &amp; Attendance company ClockedIn released facial recognition as a form of attendance tracking for businesses and organisations looking to have a more automated system of keeping track of hours worked as well as for security and health and safety control.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In May 2017, a man was arrested using an automatic facial recognition (AFR) system mounted on a van operated by the South Wales Police. [[Ars Technica]] reported that "this appears to be the first time [AFR] has led to an arrest".&lt;ref&gt;https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/06/police-automatic-face-recognition/&lt;/ref&gt;

As of late 2017, China has deployed facial recognition technology in [[Xinjiang]]. Reporters visiting the region found surveillance cameras installed every hundred meters or so in several cities, as well as facial recognition checkpoints at areas like gas stations, shopping centers, and mosque entrances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/02/china-s-massive-investment-artificial-intelligence-has-insidious-downside|title=China’s massive investment in artificial intelligence has an insidious downside|date=7 February 2018|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|accessdate=23 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/world/wp/2018/01/07/feature/in-china-facial-recognition-is-sharp-end-of-a-drive-for-total-surveillance/|title=China bets on facial recognition in big drive for total surveillance|date=2018|work=Washington Post|accessdate=23 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Police_CCTV_Van,_Comer_Crescent_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1263396.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Police_CCTV_Van,_Comer_Crescent_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1263396.jpg|thumb|Automatic Facial Recognition systems resemble other mobile CCTV systems]]

===Additional uses===
In addition to being used for security systems, authorities have found a number of other applications for face recognition systems. While earlier post-[[September 11 attacks|9/11]] deployments were well publicized trials, more recent deployments are rarely written about due to their covert nature.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In the 2000 Mexican presidential election, the Mexican government employed face recognition software to prevent voter fraud. Some individuals had been registering to vote under several different names, in an attempt to place multiple votes. By comparing new face images to those already in the voter database, authorities were able to reduce duplicate registrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Mexican+Government+Adopts+FaceIt+Face+Recognition+Technology+to...-a062019954|title=Mexican Government Adopts FaceIt Face Recognition Technology to Eliminate Duplicate Voter Registrations in Upcoming Presidential Election|date=11 May 2000|accessdate=2008-06-02|publisher=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar technologies are being used in the United States to prevent people from obtaining fake identification cards and driver’s licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/news/cards_facialrec.shtml|title=Facial recognition at DMV|last=House|first=David|publisher=[[Oregon]] Department of Transportation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205015138/http://www.oregon.gov/ODOT/DMV/news/cards_facialrec.shtml|archivedate=5 February 2007|accessdate=2007-09-17|quote=Oregon DMV is going to start using “facial recognition” software, a new tool in the prevention of fraud, required by a new state law.

Face recognition systems have also been used by photo management software to identify the subjects of photographs, enabling features such as searching images by person, as well as suggesting photos to be shared with a specific contact if their presence were detected in a photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16055418/microsoft-windows-10-photos-app-ai-image-sorting|title=Windows 10's Photos app is getting smarter image search just like Google Photos|work=The Verge|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/17/google-photos-upgraded-with-new-sharing-features-photo-books-and-google-lens/|title=Google Photos upgraded with new sharing features, photo books, and Google&amp;nbsp;Lens|last=Perez|first=Sarah|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facial recognition is used as added security in certain websites, phone applications and payment methods.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

=== Compared to other biometric systems ===
&lt;p&gt;One key advantage of a facial recognition system that it is able to person mass identification as it does not require the cooperation of the test subject to work. Properly designed systems installed in airports, multiplexes, and other public places can identify individuals among the crowd, without passers-by even being aware of the system. &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bayometric.com/biometrics-face-finger-iris-palm-voice/|title=Top Five Biometrics: Face, Fingerprint, Iris, Palm and Voice|date=2017-01-23|work=Bayometric|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;However, as compared to other biometric techniques, face recognition may not be most reliable and efficient. Quality measures are very important in facial recognition systems as large degrees of variations are possible in face images. Factors such as illumination, expression, pose and noise during face capture can affect the performance of facial recognition systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Among all biometric systems, facial recognition has the highest false acceptance and rejection rates,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; thus questions have been raised on the effectiveness of face recognition software in cases of railway and airport security.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
===Weaknesses===
Ralph Gross, a researcher at the Carnegie Mellon Robotics Institute in 2008, describes one obstacle related to the viewing angle of the face: "Face recognition has been getting pretty good at full frontal faces and 20 degrees off, but as soon as you go towards profile, there've been problems."&lt;ref name="Williams2" /&gt; Besides the pose variations, low-resolution face images are also very hard to recognize. This is one of the main obstacles of face recognition in surveillance systems.&lt;ref name="lowResFace2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haghighat|first1=M.|last2=Abdel-Mottaleb|first2=M.|year=2017|title=Low Resolution Face Recognition in Surveillance Systems Using Discriminant Correlation Analysis|journal=12th IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face &amp; Gesture Recognition (FG 2017)|pages=912–917|doi=10.1109/FG.2017.130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Face recognition is less effective if facial expressions vary. A big smile can render the system less effective. For instance: Canada, in 2009, allowed only neutral facial expressions in passport photos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppt.gc.ca/cdn/photos.aspx?lang=eng|title=Passport Canada - Photos|publisher=passportcanada.gc.ca|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301054020/http://www.ppt.gc.ca/cdn/photos.aspx?lang=eng|archivedate=1 March 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;!--  ?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also inconstancy in the datasets used by researchers. Researchers may use anywhere from several subjects to scores of subjects, and a few hundred images to thousands of images. It is important for researchers to make available the datasets they used to each other, or have at least a standard dataset.&lt;ref name="Albiol2"&gt;Albiol, A., Albiol, A., Oliver, J., Mossi, J.M.(2012). [https://riunet.upv.es/bitstream/handle/10251/56627/kinect.pdf?sequence=3 Who is who at different cameras: people re-identification using depth cameras]. Computer Vision, IET. Vol 6(5), 378-387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Data privacy is the main concern when it comes to storing biometrics data in companies. Data stores about face or biometrics can be accessed by third party if not stored properly or hacked. In the Techworld, Parris adds (2017), “Hackers will already be looking to replicate people's faces to trick facial recognition systems, but the technology has proved harder to hack than fingerprint or voice recognition technology in the past.”

=== Ineffectiveness ===
Critics of the technology complain that the [[London Borough of Newham]] scheme has, {{As of|2004|lc=on}}, never recognized a single criminal, despite several criminals in the system's database living in the Borough and the system having been running for several years. "Not once, as far as the police know, has Newham's automatic face recognition system spotted a live target."&lt;ref name="Krause2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4432506,00.htm|title=Robo cop|last=Meek|first=James|date=13 June 2002|publisher=UK Guardian newspaper|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This information seems to conflict with claims that the system was credited with a 34% reduction in crime (hence why it was rolled out to Birmingham also).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices-regional/6111139-1.html|title=Birmingham City Centre CCTV Installs Visionics' FaceIt|date=2 June 2008|publisher=Business Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it can be explained by the notion that when the public is regularly told that they are under constant video surveillance with advanced face recognition technology, this fear alone can reduce the crime rate, whether the face recognition system technically works or does not. This has been the basis for several other face recognition based security systems, where the technology itself does not work particularly well but the user's perception of the technology does.

An experiment in 2002 by the local [[police]] department in [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]], had similarly disappointing results.&lt;ref name="Krause2" /&gt;

In 2014, Facebook stated that in a standardized two-option facial recognition test, its online system scored 97.25% accuracy, compared to the human benchmark of 97.5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/07/how-good-facial-recognition-technology-government-regulation/397289/|title=How Worried Should We Be About Facial Recognition?|last1=Meyer|first1=Robinson|date=2015|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, a report by the civil liberties and rights campaigning organisation [[Big Brother Watch]] revealed that two [[United Kingdom|UK]] police forces, [[South Wales Police]] and the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]], were using live facial recognition at public events and in public spaces, but with an accuracy rate as low as 2%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Their report also warned of significant potential [[human rights]] violations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It received widespread press coverage in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/15/uk-police-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-failure|title=UK police use of facial recognition technology a failure, says report|last=Dodd|first=Vikram|date=2018-05-14|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systems are often advertised as having accuracy near 100%; this is misleading as the studies often use much smaller sample sizes than would be necessary for large scale applications. Because facial recognition is not completely accurate, it creates a list of potential matches. A human operator must then look through these potential matches and studies show the operators pick the correct match out of the list only about half the time. This causes the issue of targeting the wrong suspect.&lt;ref name="phys.org2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=White|first1=David|last2=Dunn|first2=James D.|last3=Schmid|first3=Alexandra C.|last4=Kemp|first4=Richard I.|date=14 October 2015|title=Error Rates in Users of Automatic Face Recognition Software|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0139827|journal=PLOS ONE|publisher=|volume=10|issue=10|pages=e0139827|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0139827|pmc=4605725|pmid=26465631|via=PLoS Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Privacy violations ===
Civil rights right organizations and privacy campaigners such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-sues-fbi-access-facial-recognition-records|title=EFF Sues FBI For Access to Facial-Recognition Records|work=Electronic Frontier Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Big Brother Watch]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the [[ACLU]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/qa-face-recognition|title=Q&amp;A On Face-Recognition|work=American Civil Liberties Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; express concern that [[privacy]] is being compromised by the use of surveillance technologies. Some fear that it could lead to a “total [[surveillance society]],” with the government and other authorities having the ability to know the whereabouts and activities of all citizens around the clock. This knowledge has been, is being, and could continue to be deployed to prevent the lawful exercise of rights of citizens to criticize those in office, specific government policies or corporate practices.  Many centralized power structures with such surveillance capabilities have abused their privileged access to maintain control of the political and economic apparatus, and to curtail populist reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terrorism.about.com/od/civillibertiesissues/i/facialrecsoft_2.htm|title=Civil Liberties &amp; Facial Recognition Software|publisher=[[About.com]], [[The New York Times Company]]|pages=''pp. 2''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301220151/http://terrorism.about.com/od/civillibertiesissues/i/facialrecsoft_2.htm|archivedate=1 March 2006|accessdate=2007-09-17|quote=A few examples which have already arisen from surveillance video are: using license plates to blackmail gay married people, stalking women, tracking estranged spouses...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;p&gt;Face recognition can be used not just to identify an individual, but also to unearth other personal data associated with an individual – such as other photos featuring the individual, blog posts, social networking profiles, Internet behavior, travel patterns, etc. – all through facial features alone.&lt;ref name="Harley Geiger2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdt.org/blogs/harley-geiger/612facial-recognition-and-privacy|title=Facial Recognition and Privacy|author=Harley Geiger|date=6 December 2011|publisher=Center for Democracy &amp; Technology|accessdate=2012-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been raised over who would have access to the knowledge of one's whereabouts and people with them at any given time.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/assets/680/671764.pdf|title=FACIAL RECOGNITION TECHNOLOGY Commercial Uses, Privacy Issues, and Applicable Federal Law|last=Cackley|first=Alicia Puente|date=July 2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, individuals have limited ability to avoid or thwart face recognition tracking unless they hide their faces. This fundamentally changes the dynamic of day-to-day privacy by enabling any marketer, government agency, or random stranger to secretly collect the identities and associated personal information of any individual captured by the face recognition system.&lt;ref name="Harley Geiger2" /&gt; Consumers may not understand or be aware of what their data is being used for, which denies them the ability to consent to how their personal information gets shared.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Face recognition was used in Russia to harass women allegedly involved in online pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mathbabe.org/2016/10/11/facial-recognition-is-getting-really-accurate-and-we-have-not-prepared/|title=Facial Recognition is getting really accurate, and we have not prepared|date=11 October 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia there is an app 'FindFace' which can identify faces with about 70% accuracy using the social media app called VK. This app would not be possible in other countries which do not use VK as their social media platform photos are not stored the same way as with VK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/findface-vk-app-social-media-facial-recognition-android-ios-a7035556.html|title=This creepy facial recognition app is taking Russia by storm|date=18 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July 2012, a hearing was held before the Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, to address issues surrounding what face recognition technology means for privacy and civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo47426 What Facial Recognition Technology Means for Privacy and Civil Liberties: Hearing before the Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law of the Committee on the Judiciary, United States Senate, One Hundred Twelfth Congress, Second Session, July 18, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration|National Telecommunications and Information Association]] (NTIA) began a multi-stakeholder process to engage privacy advocates and industry representatives to establish guidelines regarding the use of face recognition technology by private companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntia.doc.gov/other-publication/2016/privacy-multistakeholder-process-facial-recognition-technology|title=Privacy Multistakeholder Process: Facial Recognition Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=National Telecommunications and Information Association|publisher=|access-date=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, privacy advocates left the bargaining table over what they felt was an impasse based on the industry representatives being unwilling to agree to consent requirements for the collection of face recognition data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/245098-privacy-advocates-walk-away-from-facial-recognition-talks|title=Facial recognition talks break down as privacy advocates withdraw|last=McCabe|first=David|website=TheHill|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Telecommunications and Information Administration|NTIA]] and industry representatives continued without the privacy representatives, and draft rules are expected to be presented in the spring of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/273489-business-eyes-facial-recognition-guidelines|title=Business eyes facial recognition guidelines|last=Weaver|first=Dustin|website=TheHill|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;In July 2015, the United States Government Accountability Office conducted a Report to the Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate. The report discussed facial recognition technology's commercial uses, privacy issues, and the applicable federal law. It states that previously, issues concerning facial recognition technology were discussed and represent the need for updated federal privacy laws that continually match the degree and impact of advanced technologies. Also, that some industry, government, and privacy organizations are in the process of developing, or have developed, "voluntary privacy guidelines". These guidelines vary between the groups, but overall aim to gain consent and inform citizens of the intended use of facial recognition technology. This helps counteract the privacy issues that arise when citizens are unaware where their personal, privacy data gets put to use as the report indicates as a prevalent issue.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The largest concern with the development of biometric technology, and more specifically facial recognition, has to do with privacy. The rise in facial recognition technologies have led people to be concerned that large companies, such as Google or Apple, or even Government agencies will be using it for mass surveillance of the public. Regardless of whether or not they have committed a crime, in general people do not wish to have their every action watched or track. People tend to believe that, since we live in a free society{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}, we should be able to go out in public without the fear of being identified and surveilled. People worry that with the rising prevalence of facial recognition, they will begin to lose their anonymity.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==== Facebook DeepFace ====
&lt;p&gt;Social media web sites such as [[Facebook]] have very large numbers of photographs of people, annotated with names.  This represents a database which may be abused by governments for face recognition purposes.&lt;ref name="koste2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=228181778|title=A Look Into Facebook's Potential To Recognize Anybody's Face|author=Martin Koste|date=28 October 2013|accessdate=2013-12-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101144723/http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=228181778|archivedate=1 November 2013|deadurl=no|agency=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook's [[DeepFace]] has become the subject of several class action lawsuits under the Biometric Information Privacy Act, with claims alleging that Facebook is collecting and storing face recognition data of its users without obtaining informed consent, in direct violation of the Biometric Information Privacy Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/facebook-keeps-getting-sued-over-face-recognition-software-privacy-groups-say-we-2082166|title=Facebook Keeps Getting Sued Over Face-Recognition Software, And Privacy Groups Say We Should Be Paying More Attention|website=International Business Times|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent case was dismissed in January 2016 because the court lacked jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cookcountyrecord.com/stories/510660138-judge-tosses-illinois-privacy-law-class-action-vs-facebook-over-photo-tagging-california-cases-still-pending|title=Judge tosses Illinois privacy law class action vs Facebook over photo tagging; California cases still pending|last=Herra|first=Dana|website=cookcountyrecord.com|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it is still unclear if the Biometric Information Privacy Act will be effective in protecting biometric data privacy rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2017, Facebook rolled out a new feature that notifies a user when someone uploads a photo that includes what Facebook thinks is their face, even if they are not tagged. Facebook has attempted to frame the new functionality in a positive light, amidst prior backlashes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/06/anatomy-of-backlash/|title=Singel-Minded: Anatomy of a Backlash, or How Facebook Got an 'F' for Facial Recognition|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook’s head of privacy, Rob Sherman, addressed this new feature as one that gives people more control over their photos online. “We’ve thought about this as a really empowering feature,” he says. “There may be photos that exist that you don’t know about.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-will-find-your-face-even-when-its-not-tagged/|title=Facebook Can Now Find Your Face, Even When It's Not Tagged|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Imperfect technology in law enforcement ===
All over the world, law enforcement agencies have begun using facial recognition software to aid in the identifying of criminals. For example, the Chinese police force were able to identify twenty-five wanted suspects using facial recognition equipment at the Qingdao International Beer Festival, one of which had been on the run for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/01/facial-recognition-china-beer-festival|title=From ale to jail: facial recognition catches criminals at China beer festival|last=Beijing|first=Agence France-Presse in|date=2017-09-01|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment works by recording a 15 second video clip and taking multiple snapshots of the subject. That data is compared and analyzed with images from the police department’s database and within 20 minutes, the subject can be identified with a 98.1% accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengovasia.com/articles/7975-police-use-facial-recognition-technology-to-capture-wanted-criminals-during-beer-festival-in-chinese-city-of-qingdao|title=Police use facial recognition technology to detect wanted criminals during beer festival in Chinese city of Qingdao {{!}} OpenGovAsia|website=www.opengovasia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the police's use of facial recognition technology has been found to be up to 98% inaccurate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Facial recognition technology has been proven to work less accurately on the people of colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/story/photo-algorithms-id-white-men-fineblack-women-not-so-much/|title=Photo Algorithms ID White Men Fine—Black Women, Not So Much|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-04-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study by Joy Buolamwini (MIT Media Lab) and Timnit Gebru (Microsoft Research) found that the error rate for gender recognition for women of color within three commercial facial recognition systems ranged from 23.8% to 36%, whereas for lighter-skinned men it was between 0.0 and 1.6%. Overall accuracy rates for identifying men (91.9%) were higher than for women (79.4%), and none of the systems accommodated a non-binary understanding of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a.html|title=Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification|author1=Joy Buolamwini|author2=Timnit Gebru|date=2018|location=Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, vol. 81|pages=1-15|language=English|accessdate=8 March 2018|ref=ISSN 1533-7928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts fear that the new technology may actually be hurting the communities the police claims they are trying to protect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2017/aug/08/rise-of-the-racist-robots-how-ai-is-learning-all-our-worst-impulses|title=Rise of the racist robots – how AI is learning all our worst impulses|last=Buranyi|first=Stephen|date=2017-08-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered an imperfect biometric, and in a study conducted by Georgetown University researcher Clare Garvie, she concluded that "there’s no consensus in the scientific community that it provides a positive identification of somebody.”&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/dec/04/racist-facial-recognition-white-coders-black-people-police|title=How white engineers built racist code – and why it's dangerous for black people|last=Brel|first=Ali|date=2017-12-04|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;It is believed that with such large margins of error in this technology, both legal advocates and facial recognition software companies say that the technology should only supply a portion of the case – not evidence that can lead to an arrest of an individual. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of regulations holding facial recognition technology companies to requirements of racial biased testing can be a significant flaw in the adoption of use in law enforcement. [[CyberExtruder]], a company that markets itself to law enforcement said that they had not performed testing or research on bias in their software. CyberExtruder did note that some skin colours are more difficult for the software to recognize with current limitations of the technology. “Just as individuals with very dark skin are hard to identify with high significance via facial recognition, individuals with very pale skin are the same,” said Blake Senftner, a senior software engineer at CyberExtruder.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Anti facial recognition systems==
&lt;p&gt;In January 2013 Japanese researchers from the [[National Institute of Informatics]] created 'privacy visor' glasses that use nearly infrared light to make the face underneath it unrecognizable to face recognition software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/01/18/isao_echizen_and_seiichi_gohshi_s_privacy_visor_shields_you_from_facial.html|title=These Goofy-Looking Glasses Could Make You Invisible to Facial Recognition Technology|date=18 January 2013|work=Slate|accessdate=22 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latest version uses a titanium frame, light-reflective material and a mask which uses angles and patterns to disrupt facial recognition technology through both absorbing and bouncing back light sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2015/08/07/eyeglasses-with-face-un-recognition-function-to-debut-in-japan/|title=Eyeglasses with Face Un-Recognition Function to Debut in Japan|last1=Hongo|first1=Jun|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/privacy-visor-which-blocks-facial-recognition-software-set-for-public-release/|title=Privacy visor which blocks facial recognition software set for public release|last1=Osborne|first1=Charlie|publisher=ZDNet|language=en|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/these-glasses-block-facial-recognition-technology-1722826081|title=These Glasses Block Facial Recognition Technology|last1=Stone|first1=Maddie|publisher=Gizmodo|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2969732/privacy/how-japans-privacy-visor-fools-facerecognition-cameras.html|title=How Japan's Privacy Visor fools face-recognition cameras|publisher=PCWorld|language=en|accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2016 a form of anti-CCTV and facial recognition sunglasses called 'reflectacles' were invented by a custom-spectacle-craftsman based in Chicago named Scott Urban.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.magneticmag.com/2016/12/be-seen-and-unseen-reflectacles-are-the-sunglasses-of-the-future/&lt;/ref&gt; They reflect infrared and, optionally, visible light which makes the users face a white blur to cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/reflectacles/reflectacles-reflective-eyewear-and-sunglasses|title=Reflectacles - Reflective Eyewear and Sunglasses|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another method to protect from facial recognition systems are specific haircuts and make-up patterns that prevent the used algorithms to detect a face.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cvdazzle.com/|title=CV Dazzle: Camouflage from Face Detection|last=Harvey|first=Adam|website=cvdazzle.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

An '''insider threat''' is a malicious threat to an organization that comes from people within the organization, such as employees, former employees, contractors or business associates, who have inside information concerning the organization's security practices, data and computer systems. The threat may involve fraud, the theft of confidential or commercially valuable information, the theft of intellectual property, or the sabotage of computer systems.

== Overview ==
Insiders may have accounts giving them legitimate access to computer systems, with this access originally having been given to them to serve in the performance of their duties; these permissions could be abused to harm the organization. Insiders are often familiar with the organization's data and intellectual property as well as the methods that are in place to protect them. This makes it easier for the insider to circumvent any security controls of which they are aware. Physical proximity to data means that the insider does not need to hack into the organizational network through the outer perimeter by traversing firewalls; rather they are in the building already, often with direct access to the organization's internal network. Insider threats are harder to defend against than attacks from outsiders, since the insider already has legitimate access to the organization's information and assets.&lt;ref name="FBI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/counterintelligence/the-insider-threat |title=FBI Counterintelligence: The Insider Threat. An introduction to detecting and deterring an insider spy |publisher=Fbi.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210135443/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/counterintelligence/the-insider-threat |archivedate=2014-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An insider may attempt to steal property or information for personal gain, or to benefit another organization or country.&lt;ref name = "FBI" /&gt; The threat to the organization could also be through malicious software left running on its computer systems by former employees, a so-called [[Logic bomb]].

==Research centers==
Insider threat is an active area of research in academia and government.

The [[CERT Coordination Center]] at [[Carnegie-Mellon University]] maintains the CERT Insider Threat Center, which includes a database of more than 850 cases of insider threats, including instances of fraud, theft and sabotage; the database is used for research and analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/insider_threat/ |title=The CERT Insider Threat Center |publisher=Cert.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; CERT's Insider Threat Team also maintains an informational blog to help organizations and businesses defend themselves against insider crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cert.org/blogs/insider_threat/|title=Insider Threat Blog|publisher=CERT|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research findings ==

IBAC is designed to prevent the insider threat as opposed to the current access control systems that are designed to prevent the outsider threat. IBAC is a risk-based access control that assesses risk of access based on the detected intent and the motivation level towards executing that intent. IBAC takes advantage of the robustness of P300-based Concealed Information Test to detect an intent of access and uses the brain signals to detect the motivation level. The access control system has been used on 30 participants with 100% detected intentions of access and all mal-intent users being rejected access before they commit their mal-intended action.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; gives some statistics on insider threat incidents: 80% of the malicious acts were committed at work during working hours; 81% of the perpetrators planned their actions beforehand; 33% of the perpetrators were described as "difficult" and 17% as being "disgruntled". The insider was identified in 74% of cases. Financial gain was a motive in 81% of cases, revenge in 23% of cases, and 27% of the people carrying out malicious acts were in financial difficulties at the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19808">'''Intermediate scrutiny''', in [[United States constitutional law|U.S. constitutional law]], is the second level of deciding issues using [[judicial review]].  The other levels are typically referred to as [[rational basis review]] (least rigorous) and [[strict scrutiny]] (most rigorous).

In order to overcome the intermediate scrutiny test, it must be shown that the law or policy being challenged furthers an important government interest by means that are substantially related to that interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topics.law.cornell.edu/wex/intermediate_scrutiny |title=Intermediate Scrutiny - Legal Information Institute |publisher=topics.law.cornell.edu |date=January 15, 2014 |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; ''Wengler v. Druggists Mutual Ins. Co.'', 446 U.S. 142, 150 &lt;/ref&gt; 

Intermediate scrutiny may be contrasted with "[[strict scrutiny]]", the higher standard of review that requires narrowly tailored and least restrictive means to further a compelling governmental interest, and "[[rational basis review]]", a lower standard of review that requires the law or policy be rationally related to an legitimate government interest. 

This approach is most often employed in reviewing limits on commercial speech, content-neutral regulations of speech, and state actions discriminating on the basis of sex.

==Laws subject to Equal Protection scrutiny==

Constitutional Equal Protection analysis applies not only to challenges against the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]], but also to [[State Government|state]] and [[local government]]s.  Although the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause applies only to state and local governments, the United States Supreme Court has implied an Equal Protection limitation on the federal government through a process known as "[[reverse incorporation]]."  As the Fourteenth Amendment applies directly to the states, the incorporation process was unnecessary to hold this restriction against state and local governments.  Equal Protection analysis also applies to both [[legislature|legislative]] and [[Executive (government)|executive]] action regardless if the action is of a [[substantive due process|substantive]] or [[procedural due process|procedural]] nature.  Judicially crafted ([[common law]]) rules are also valid only if they conform to the requirements of Equal Protection.  See, e.g., ''Reed v. Campbell'', 476 U.S. 852 (1986).&lt;ref&gt;In ''Reed'', a judicially crafted time window for filing was applicable only to illegitimate persons and was scrutinized under intermediate Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection standard and struck down.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex-based classifications==
In the context of sex-based classifications, intermediate scrutiny applies to [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] challenges of [[Equal protection clause|equal protection]] and [[discrimination]].

An example of a court using intermediate scrutiny came in ''[[Craig v. Boren]]'', 429 U.S. 190 (1976), which was the first case in the [[United States Supreme Court]] which determined that statutory or administrative sex-based classifications were subject to an intermediate standard of [[judicial review]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.georgetown.edu/glh/markowitz.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan]]'' in 1982, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled  that the burden is on the proponent of the discrimination to establish an "exceedingly persuasive justification" for sex-based classification to be valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=linderd |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/missu.html |title=Mississippi University for Women v. Hogan |publisher=law.umkc.edu |date=July 1, 1982 |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the court applied intermediate scrutiny in a way that is closer to [[strict scrutiny]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/intermediate-scrutiny |title=Intermediate scrutiny |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in recent decisions the Court has preferred the term "exacting scrutiny" when referring to the intermediate level of Equal Protection analysis.  For example the court applied similar exacting intermediate scrutiny when ruling on sex-based classifications in both ''[[J.E.B. v. Alabama]]'' (concerning specific strikes against male jurors during jury composition) and ''[[United States v. Virginia]]'' (concerning male-only admission to the Virginia Military Institute).

In ''[[Glenn v. Brumby]]'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] held that firing based on [[transgender]] status was a form of sex discrimination, and therefore subject to intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://verdict.justia.com/2012/03/19/sex-discrimination-claims-under-title-vii-and-the-equal-protection-clause|title=Sex Discrimination Claims Under Title VII and the Equal Protection Clause:|last=Kemp|first=David S.|date=March 19, 2012|work=Verdict|publisher=Justia|accessdate=November 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illegitimacy==

Restrictions based on [[illegitimacy]] are also subjected to intermediate scrutiny in the Equal Protection context.&lt;ref name="Gerstmann1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerstmann|first=Evan|title=The Constitutional Underclass: Gays, Lesbians, and the Failure of Class-Based Equal Protection|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cB_kFqFzYvQC&amp;pg=PA53|accessdate=December 29, 2012|date=April 1, 1999|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226288598|pages=53–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weisberg2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisberg|first=D. Kelly|title=Family Law: Aspen Roadmap Law Course Outline|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BelQvCiJGU8C&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=December 29, 2012|date=April 8, 2008|publisher=Aspen Publishers Online|isbn=9780735572256|pages=58–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts have found such scrutiny necessary for a number of reasons.  Rationally, imposing legal burdens on an illegitimate person in order to express disapproval of the conduct of her parents is illogical, unjust, and contrary to the fundamental principle that legal burdens should have some relationship to individual wrongdoing.  Like race or gender, the court has stressed that an illegitimate person's status of birth is a condition over which she has no control, and it has no bearing on her ability or willingness to contribute to society.  In applying increasingly exacting intermediate scrutiny, the courts have noted that illegitimate persons are a stigmatized minority, are vastly outnumbered politically, and are the target of long-standing and continuing invidious legal discrimination.  For all these reasons, exacting constitutional scrutiny is mandated under the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

An additional ground for heightening scrutiny of illegitimacy-based discriminatory statutes occurs whenever such statutes involve sex discrimination (as they commonly do).  Following a sweep of legislative changes in almost every state in the early nineteenth century all non-marital children were legitimated as to their mothers.  Each such child remained illegitimate as to her male parent, only.  This gender-based classification disadvantaged male parents and privileged female parents in their fundamental familial relationship to their child.  Such gender discrimination was held an additional grounds for intermediate scrutiny of statutory denial of the father-child relationship in cases such as ''[[Caban v. Mohammed]]'', 441 U.S. 380 (1979).

==Sexual orientation==
Courts have been reluctant to apply intermediate scrutiny to cases centered around sexual orientation. For instance, in ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'' 517 US 620 (1996), which struck down an amendment to the [[Colorado Constitution]] that invalidated legal protections based on sexual orientation, the [[United States Supreme Court]] held that the amendment violated the Equal Protection Clause because the amendment was motivated by a bare desire to harm a politically unpopular group, which is never a legitimate governmental interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court

In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', 539 U.S. 558 (2003), the U.S. Supreme Court struck down anti-sodomy laws as unconstitutional, explicitly overturning its earlier ''[[Bowers v. Hardwick]]'', 478 U.S. 186 (1986) decision, but did not specify the level of scrutiny it applied. In ''[[Lofton v. Secretary of the Department of Children &amp; Family Services]]'', 358 F.3d 804 (11th Cir. 2004), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] explicitly held that ''Lawrence'' did not apply strict scrutiny.  However, in 2008, the [[California Supreme Court]] adopted the [[strict scrutiny]] standard for state laws that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation in the case ''[[In re Marriage Cases]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Abigail Perkiss |url=http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2013/01/defining-protected-classes-same-sex-marriage-and-judicial-scrutiny/ |title=Defining protected classes: Same-sex marriage and judicial scrutiny |publisher=blog.constitutioncenter.org |accessdate=January 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2012, the [[Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] became the first federal appeals court, in ''[[Windsor v. United States]]'', to hold that laws that classify people based on [[sexual orientation]] should be subject to intermediate scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Weiss|first=Debra Cassens|title=2nd Circuit Rules for Surviving Gay Spouse, Says DOMA Violates Equal Protection Clause|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/2nd_circuit_rules_for_surviving_gay_spouse_seeking_estate_tax_deduction_in_/|accessdate=October 18, 2012|newspaper=ABA Journal|date=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=2ndCir&gt;{{cite web|title=Windsor v.

On January 21, 2014, the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] ruled in ''SmithKline Beecham Corp. v. Abbott Laboratories'' that  "classifications based on sexual orientation are subject to heightened scrutiny", making it the second appellate court to do so.&lt;ref name=9thCir&gt;{{cite web|title=''SmithKline Beecham Corp. v.

==Free speech==
There are two types of laws affecting "free speech" among United States citizens:  content-based and content-neutral.  In the free speech context, intermediate scrutiny is the test or standard of review that courts apply when analyzing content-neutral speech versus content-based speech. Content-based speech is reviewed under strict scrutiny in which courts evaluate the value of the subject matter or the content of the communication.&lt;ref&gt;United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 and 832 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sable Communications of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U. S. 115, 131 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;  Content-neutral laws are evaluated by the nature and scope of the speech regarding the time, place and manner of communication.  Content-neutral speech is reviewed under intermediate scrutiny versus strict scrutiny because this speech is only restricted by the way in which the information is communicated; not the information itself.  In 1968, ''[[United States v. O'Brien]]'' established a four-factor test to determine whether restricting content-neutral speech is constitutional:  (1) Is restriction within the constitutional power of government? (2) Does restriction further important or substantial governmental interest? (3) Is the governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression? (4) Is the restriction narrowly tailored &amp;ndash; no greater than necessary?  Later, a fifth factor was added in ''[[Ladue v. Gilleo]]'', 512 U.S. 43 (1994): (5) whether the restriction leaves open ample opportunities of communication.

When deciding if a restriction is narrowly tailored, courts consider the setting of the communication. Setting has two divisions:  public forum and non- public forum.  In a public forum people have a right to express themselves however, not in a non-public forum.  ''[[Adderley v. Florida]]'', 385 U.S. 39 (1966) held that freedom of speech may be limited in a jailhouse because a jailhouse is not a public forum therefore speech is subject to restriction.  The court in Adderley v. Florida used the [[rational basis]] test standard of review even though the law was content neutral because a jailhouse is a non-public forum.

''[[Ward v. Rock Against Racism]]'', 491 U.S. 781 (1989) held that a city's restriction on loud music volume controlled by equipment and technicians is constitutional because it is narrowly tailored.  ''[[Madsen v. Women's Health Center]]'', 512 U.S. 753 (1994) upheld part of an injunction restricting abortion protesters from entering the "buffer zone" around the abortion clinic because this was the least restrictive means and still gave protestors ample opportunity to communicate outside the buffer zone on the sidewalk, which was a public forum. The court used the [[strict scrutiny]] standard of review in ''Madsen''. 

Intermediate scrutiny applies to regulation that does not directly target speech but has a substantial impact on a particular message.  It applies to [[time, place, and manner]] restrictions on speech, for example, with the additional requirement of "adequate alternative channels of communication."  In other words, if restricting the time, place, or manner of speech means that speech cannot take place at all, the regulation fails intermediate scrutiny.  It has been used in "erogenous zoning" cases such as ''[[Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.]]'', 475 U.S. 41 (1986), that limit the concentration or require concentration of certain types of establishments.  It has also been used for other types of content-neutral regulation, as well as for content-neutral speech compulsion.  Intermediate scrutiny also applies to regulation of commercial speech, as long as the state interests in regulating relate to fair bargaining.  Regulations for other reasons, such as protection of children, are subject to strict scrutiny.

==Gun control==
Various federal and state laws restricting access to guns by certain people, laws that restrict or ban the acquisition or ownership of certain types of firearms by the general population, and laws that restrict the [[Concealed Carry in the United States|carrying of firearms by private citizens in public places]] have largely been upheld on the basis of intermediate scrutiny.  In many of these cases, such laws have survived intermediate scrutiny on the basis that the government is furthering an "important interest in public safety" in enacting laws that constrain the individual [[right to keep and bear arms]] under the [[Second Amendment of the United States Constitution]].  The [[United States Supreme Court]] in its 2008 ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' decision confirmed that the right to "keep and bear arms" is an individual right, but also caveated that the Second Amendment is not necessarily "a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner."

However, outright bans on acquiring, possessing and carrying any and all types of firearms in [[Illinois]], the [[District of Columbia]] and in various cities and counties (notably [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]) have been struck down, failing to survive intermediate scrutiny where the courts determined that the government overreached in furthering its interest in public safety by completely banning private citizens from obtaining or possessing firearms or carrying firearms in public.

The Supreme Court has yet to clarify the exact level of scrutiny to be applied to gun control laws, though in its decision in ''D.C. v. Heller'', the Court identified a broad category of laws deemed presumptively constitutional.

=="Intermediate" versus "heightened"==
The phrase "heightened scrutiny" has been used interchangeably with "intermediate scrutiny" but it is unclear if the two are actually legally interchangeable. In ''[[Witt v. Department of the Air Force]]'', 527 F.3d 806 (9th Cir. 2008), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled that the law commonly known as "don't ask, don't tell" (DADT) was subject to "heightened" scrutiny based on its analysis of ''Lawrence''. The court articulated a three-pronged test for heightened scrutiny. To pass, the law "must advance an important governmental interest, the intrusion must significantly further that interest, and the intrusion must be necessary to further that interest". This differs from the "substantially related to important governmental interests" two-prong test for "intermediate" scrutiny. As the [[Obama administration]] chose not to appeal ''Witt'' to the Supreme Court, it is binding precedent on the Ninth Circuit and it has been cited as such in ''[[Log Cabin Republicans v. United States]]'' (''LCR''), another case challenging the constitutionality of DADT. The District court in ''LCR'' applied the three-pronged test in ruling DADT unconstitutional. The administration appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit. In December 2010 DADT was legislatively repealed. On September 29, 2011, the Ninth Circuit vacated the district court's decision, ruling that the legislative repeal of "don't ask, don't tell" rendered the case [[Mootness|moot]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/29/us-usa-gays-military-idUSTRE78S5NE20110929?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews |title=U.S. court vacates ruling on gays in military |publisher=Reuters |first=Dan |last=Levine |date=September 29, 2011 |accessdate=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obama administration, in its refusal to defend several lawsuits challenging Section 3 of the [[Defense of Marriage Act]], argued that "heightened" scrutiny is the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply to statutes that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.

'''The International Day of Pink''' is a Canadian anti-bullying event held annually during the second week of April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Day of Pink|url=http://dayofpink.org/|website=Day of Pink|accessdate=5 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event started when students David Shepherd and Travis Price saw another student, who was wearing a pink shirt, being bullied in their [[Central Kings Rural High School]] in [[Nova Scotia]], and deciding to show support for the student by getting everyone at their school to wear pink the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bullied student tickled pink by schoolmates' T-shirt campaign|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/bullied-student-tickled-pink-by-schoolmates-t-shirt-campaign-1.682221|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=CBC|date=19 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The International Day of Pink is run by youth volunteers from [[Jer's Vision]], in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. The initiative seeks to support the work of students, educators, community and business in their efforts to stop bullying, discrimination, homophobia and transphobia.&lt;ref name="xtra"/&gt;

==Events==
In 2012, students participating the Day of Pink organized numerous flash mobs, including one on Parliament Hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mack|first=Chantal|title=Pink shirts bring anti-bullying message to Parliament Hill|url=http://www.canada.com/life/Pink+shirts+bring+anti+bullying+message+Parliament+Hill/6443371/story.html|publisher=Canada.com PostMedia Web|accessdate=26 June 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;    The International Day of Pink also shares a Gala with JersVision.org and the event has featured comedian [[Rick Mercer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hundreds Celebrate Day of Pink|url=http://m.ottawasun.com/2012/04/12/hundreds-celebrate-day-of-pink|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=Ottawa Sun}}{{dead link|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brian Burke (ice hockey)|Brian Burke]] of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brian Burke Scores in Ottawa|url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/hockey/2011/04/13/17985956.html|accessdate=26 June 2012|newspaper=Toronto Sun|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former Canadian Ambassador [[Stephen Lewis]].&lt;ref name="xtra" /&gt;

{{Intersex sidebar}}
[[Intersex]] people in [[Kenya]] face significant human rights violations, starting from birth. There are few protections from mutilation and non-consensual cosmetic medical interventions and no legislative protection from discrimination. Intersex persons may have difficulties in obtaining birth certificates and others forms of documentation.

==History==
{{further|Intersex in history}}
Traditionally, children who are identified as having an intersex condition at birth were killed. This is beginning to change, according to midwives and birth attendants' organizations.&lt;ref name="bbc2017" /&gt; Surviving intersex children may have difficulties in obtaining birth certificates and other forms of identification.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"/&gt;

In December 2017, African intersex activists published a statement setting out local demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite| last = African Intersex Movement| title = Public Statement by the African Intersex Movement| date = December 2017| url = https://www.astraeafoundation.org/stories/public-statement-african-intersex-movement/ | accessdate = 2018-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, the [[Kenya National Commission on Human Rights]] published a report calling for research and legal reform to protect the rights of intersex persons in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Kenya National Commission on Human Rights| isbn = 978-9966-040-49-7| last = Kenya National Commission on Human Rights| title = Equal in Dignity and Rights: Promoting The Rights of Intersex Persons In Kenya| location = Nairobi| date = August 2018| url = http://www.knchr.org/Publications/Thematic-Reports/Group-Rights/Rights-of-Sexual-Minorities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports suggest that the birth of an intersex infant can be regarded as a curse or bad omen, resulting in infanticide. Seline Okiki, chairperson of the organization of birth attendants, Ten Beloved Sisters, has described how babies born intersex are traditionally killed following birth.&lt;ref name="bbc2017"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39780214 | title = The midwife who saved intersex babies | first1 = Helen | last1 = Grady | first2 = Anne | last2 = Soy | work = BBC World Service, Kenya | date = May 4, 2017 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170515044758/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39780214 | archivedate = May 15, 2017 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, it was reported that an intersex adolescent from Malindi, Muhadh Ishmael, was mutilated and later died in hospital. He had previously been described as a curse on his family.&lt;ref name="76crimes"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Odero| first = Joseph| title = Intersex in Kenya: Held captive, beaten, hacked.

{{main|Discrimination against intersex people}}
Intersex people are considered to suffer significant stigma.&lt;ref name="duggan2017"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Duggan| first = Briana| title = Shame, taboo, ignorance: Growing up intersex| work = CNN| accessdate = 2017-05-13| date = January 5, 2017| url = http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/health/growing-up-intersex-in-kenya/index.html| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170703124645/http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/05/health/growing-up-intersex-in-kenya/index.html| archivedate = July 3, 2017| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Kenyan news report suggests high rates of early school leaving, with the organisation Gama Africa reporting that 60% of 132 known intersex people had dropped out of school "because of the harassment and treatment they received from their peers and their teachers".&lt;ref name="odhiambo2016"/&gt; Anecdotal reports point to high levels of suicidality amongst intersex people.&lt;ref name="odhiambo2016" /&gt;

In the 2010 case of ''Richard Muasya v. the Hon. Attorney General'', Muasya had been convicted of robbery with violence. The case examined whether or not he had suffered discrimination as a result of being born intersex. He was found to have been subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment while in prison.&lt;ref name="icj2010" /&gt;

Intersex people in Kenya do not currently have protections from discrimination, but the rights of intersex people are currently a matter of discussion, led by nominated MP [[Isaac Mwaura]].&lt;ref name="chigiti2016"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Chigiti| first = John| title = The plight of the intersex child| work = The Star, Kenya| accessdate = 2017-05-13| date = September 14, 2016| url = http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/09/14/the-plight-of-the-intersex-child_c1419560| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170129234516/http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/09/14/the-plight-of-the-intersex-child_c1419560| archivedate = January 29, 2017| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="njagi2016"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Njagi| first = John| title = House to address matters of intersex people| work = Daily Nation| accessdate = 2017-05-13| date = October 10, 2016| url = http://www.nation.co.ke/news/House-to-address-matters-of-intersex-people/1056-3410778-hekur8z/index.html| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161213071648/http://www.nation.co.ke/news/House-to-address-matters-of-intersex-people/1056-3410778-hekur8z/index.html| archivedate = December 13, 2016| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kadida2016"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kadida| first = Jillo| title = Intersex people don’t choose their gender, says Maraga| work = The Star, Kenya| accessdate = 2017-05-13| date = September 1, 2016| url = http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/09/01/intersex-people-dont-choose-their-gender-says-maraga_c1412506| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161111141253/http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/09/01/intersex-people-dont-choose-their-gender-says-maraga_c1412506| archivedate = November 11, 2016| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this followed a landmark court case decided in 2014, of a child who could not commence school without a birth certificate.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"/&gt;

==Identification documents==
{{main|Legal recognition of intersex people}}
In 2014, in the case of ''Baby ‘A’ (Suing through her Mother E.A) &amp; another v Attorney General &amp; 6 others [2014]'', a Kenyan court ordered the Kenyan government to issue a birth certificate to a five-year-old child born in 2009 with ambiguous genitalia.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Migiro|first=Katy|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|title=Kenya takes step toward recognizing intersex people in landmark ruling|work=Reuters|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924211232/http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/05/us-kenya-intersex-idUSKCN0JJ1M120141205|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kenya a birth certificate is necessary for attending school, getting a national identity document, and voting.&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"/&gt; The child's lawyer, John Chigiti, stated that this was a "first step toward recognizing intersex people".&lt;ref name="Reuters2014"/&gt;

In an earlier, 2010, High Court case, ''Richard Muasya v. the Hon. Attorney General'', the Court had determined that an intersex person was responsible for registering his own birth, following a failure to do so at the time of his birth.&lt;ref name="icj2010"&gt;{{Cite web| publisher = International Commission of Jurists| last = International Commission of Jurists| title = Richard Muasya v. the Hon.

== Rights advocacy==
[[Intersex Awareness Day]] was first marked in Kenya in 2016. A march in Nairobi was organized by Gama Africa, along with petition presented to parliament and events organized by the [[Kenya National Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="odhiambo2016"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Odhiambo| first = Rhoda| title = Kenya to mark international intersex day next week| work = The Star, Kenya| accessdate = 2017-05-13| date = October 20, 2016| url = http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/10/20/kenya-to-mark-international-intersex-day-next-week_c1441157| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170511144918/http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2016/10/20/kenya-to-mark-international-intersex-day-next-week_c1441157| archivedate = May 11, 2017| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, work commenced on a "Model Law on the rights of intersex persons in Africa". A first consultation meeting took place at the Centre for Human Rights at the [[University of Pretoria]], in [[Intersex rights in South Africa|South Africa]]. Kenyan representatives included John Chigiti of Gender Minorities Action Trust Foundation-Kenya (GMAT), who represented intersex persons in 2010 and 2014 High Court cases.&lt;ref name="model2017"&gt;{{Cite| last = University of Pretoria| title = Centre for Human Rights hosts first consultative meeting to discuss draft model law on the rights of intersex persons in Africa| date = April 26, 2017| url = http://www.up.ac.za/en/faculty-of-law/news/post_2463822-centre-for-human-rights-hosts-first-consultative-meeting-to-discuss-draft-model-law-on-the-rights-of-intersex-persons-in-africa-| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180104224116/http://www.up.ac.za/en/faculty-of-law/news/post_2463822-centre-for-human-rights-hosts-first-consultative-meeting-to-discuss-draft-model-law-on-the-rights-of-intersex-persons-in-africa-| archivedate = January 4, 2018| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Is Genesis History?''''' is a 2017 American [[Christian film industry|Christian film]] that uses [[creation science]], a [[pseudoscientific]] concept, to promote [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] beliefs that contradict established [[scientific fact]]s regarding the [[Big Bang|origin of the Universe]], the [[age of the Earth]], and the [[common descent]] of all lifeforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenaturalhistorian.com/2017/06/26/is-genesis-history-digging-for-truth-and-coming-up-empty-handed-3/|title=Is Genesis History: Digging for Truth and Coming up Empty-Handed|last=Cade|first=Lars|date=June 26, 2017|website=Naturalis Historia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The company was founded under the name JHS in São Paulo, Brazil in 1972 by brothers Fábio and José Roberto Auriemo and two other partners. The company focused on construction and real estate development at its inception. By 1990, JHS had split into two companies with Fábio Auriemo taking control of real estate market operations (JHSF Participações), and José Roberto Auriemo heading the other company (JHSJ).&lt;ref name=RevistaCrescer/&gt;
 
In 2001, JHSF Participações expanded its business into the shopping center segment. The company developed the Shopping Metrô Santa Cruz in São Paulo, Brazil, which was the first mall in the country to have a subway station.&lt;ref name=Exame&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exame.abril.com.br/negocios/br-malls-compra-shopping-metro-santa-cruz-r-188-milhoes-493422/ |title=BR compra shopping Metrô Santa Cruz por $188 milhões |accessdate=June 19, 2017 |date= October 10, 2010 |publisher=Revista Exame}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VilaMariana&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vilamariana.com.br/shopping-metro-santa-cruz |title=Shopping Metrô Santa Cruz |accessdate=June 19, 2017 |publisher=Vila Mariana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JHSF negotiated for Shopping Metrô Santa Cruz to be to sold to BR Malls in 2010. By 2016, Hemisfério Sul Investimentos Group had concluded the purchase of Shopping Metrô Tucuruvi. In 2014, JHSF inaugurated Catarina Fashion Outlet, the first outlet in Brazil in the luxury market.

The [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]] has claimed [[Wake Island]], which it calls "Enen-Kio". In 1973, Marshallese lawmakers meeting in Saipan at the Congress of Micronesia, the legislative body for the [[Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands]], asserted that "Enen-Kio is and always has been the property of the people of the Marshall Islands."

The self-declared Kingdom of EnenKio has also claimed Wake Island as a separate sovereign nation and has issued [[passport]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/inquirer/walking-on-eggshells/news-story/e0f800a86f936c67291189541046737c |title=Walking on eggshells |work=[[The Australian]] |date=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://archives.digitaltoday.in/indiatoday/20020930/cyber.html |title=Con Countries |work=[[India Today]] |date=30 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kingdom of EnenKio is not recognized in any international forum as a sovereign state, nor does any internationally recognized state recognize it.  In 1997 the [[Dominion of Melchizedek]], a micronation engaged in financial fraud, reported that the two had entered into relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rf_mHK98RNwC&amp;pg=PA116 |title=Global Pirates: Fraud in the Offshore Insurance Industry |author=Robert Tillman |year=2002 |publisher=[[Northeastern University Press]] |isbn=978-1-55553-505-6 |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Kingdom of EnenKio is characterized as a scam by anti-fraud website [[Quatloos!]]&lt;ref name=quakio /&gt;  In 2000, Robert Moore, who claimed to be the head of state, was prevented by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] from fraudulently issuing bonds for the non-existent nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr16780.htm |title=SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION v. Robert F. Moore |work=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] |date=26 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 1998 the Marshall Islands government issued Circular Note 01-98, which vigorously denied the Kingdom of EnenKio and the Dominion of Melchizedek's claims:

{{quote box|align=right|width=25%|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|quote="The Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands condemns the claims and activities asserted by representatives of the "Kingdom of EnenKio" and the "Dominion of Melchizedek". The representatives making claims of separate sovereignty are not citizens of the Republic of the Marshall Islands and have no right to make claims on behalf of Marshallese landowners. Furthermore, these representatives are making fraudulent assertions that violate the Republic of the Marshall Islands' constitution. The area of land and ocean which the "Kingdom of EnenKio" asserts as a sovereign nation separate from the Marshall Islands and the area of land and ocean which the "Dominion of Melchizedek" is asserting control over are areas within the geographical and political boundaries of the Republic of the Marshall Islands.

The Government of the Republic of the Marshall Islands discourages all independent sovereign nations having diplomatic relations with the Republic from acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of the "Kingdom of EnenKio" and the "Dominion of Melchizedek".

==History==

Founded in 1947, the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]] (ILAB) has published numerous reports on the subject of labor, [[child labor]], forced labor and forced child labor around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcsg.com/view/full_story/25950615/article-Report-on-worst-forms-of-child-labor-released-by-US-Labor-Secretary-Perez?instance=more_local_news1|title=KCSG Television - Report on worst forms of child labor released by US Labor Secretary Perez|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=2357061&amp;CategoryId=12394|title=Latin American Herald Tribune - U.S. Reports on Latin American &amp; Global Countries with Worst Child Labor|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wamc.org/post/labor-agency-issues-child-labor-list|title=Labor Agency Issues Child Labor List|author=Pat Bradley|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/09/10/us-childlabor-report-international-idUSTRE5896QD20090910|title=Child, forced labor behind many products: study|work=Reuters|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Bureau has been issuing an updated ''List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor'' yearly. The report listed 122 goods from 58 countries in its first edition in 2009. In 2014, it listed 136 goods from 74 countries.

The TVPRA List indicates the goods and countries where ILAB has recorded a significant incidence of child labor and forced labor without specifying the individual companies or businesses involved.&lt;ref&gt;The 2014 [http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/pdf/TVPRA_Report2014.pdf DOL report], Procedural Guidelines for the Development and Maintenance of the List of Goods From Countries Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor, Federal Register / Vol. 72, No. 247 / Thursday, December 27, 2007 / Notices - 73375&lt;/ref&gt; Exhaustive research has been conducted in order to provide a comprehensive list based on publicly available sources.&lt;ref&gt;Research Methodoly, the 2014 ''List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor'' report, pp. 18-22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A comprehensive [http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/pdf/TVPRA2013-2014Bibliography.pdf bibliography] of the studies mentioned, listed by country.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Bureau's research reported more goods produced by child labor than by forced labor. Agricultural crops represented the largest category of goods. In fact, the List had 60 agricultural goods, 38 manufactured goods and 23 mined goods. Child labor and forced labor were mostly adopted in the production of cotton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecouterre.com/cotton-tops-list-of-industries-most-likely-to-abuse-child-labor/|title=Cotton Tops List of Industries Most Likely to Abuse Child, Forced Labor - Ecouterre|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecotextile.com/2014120421186/social-compliance-csr-news/cotton-production-tops-child-labour-list.html|title=Cotton production tops child labour list - Social Compliance &amp; CSR News - Ecotextile News|author=Brett Mathews|publisher=|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.takepart.com/article/2014/12/08/your-cotton-t-shirt-comes-courtesy-child-slave-labor|title=Your Soft Cotton T-Shirt Might Have Come Courtesy of Child Slave Labor|work=TakePart|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the agricultural sector, the making of bricks in manufacturing, and [[gold mining]] in the mining industries. In 2014, agriculture, forestry and fishing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014001010 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.05.006 | volume=27 | title=Fishing for justice: Human rights, development, and fisheries sector reform | year=2014 | journal=Global Environmental Change | pages=120–130 | author=Ratner Blake D., Åsgård Björn, Allison Edward H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; represented the largest category of goods in the list and 126 goods were reported to be globally produced by child labor in comparison with 55 goods produced by forced labor. Instances of such working conditions were observed in relatively the same sectors.

In 2014, the List identified [[India]] as the country with the most goods produced by both child labor and forced labor with up to 25 goods listed. India is followed by [[Brazil]] (16 goods), [[Bangladesh]] (15 goods), [[Burma]] (14 goods), the [[Philippines]] (13 goods) and [[China]] (12 goods).

The TVPRA List aims at raising awareness about child labor and forced labor at the national and the international level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/loveisanorientation/2015/01/in-honor-of-national-human-trafficking-day/|title=In Honor of National Human Trafficking Day|work=Love is an Orientation|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/dec/21/is-child-labour-thing-of-past-lucy-siegle Is child labour a thing of the past?] by Lucy Siegle, a Guardian article commenting on the DOL's ''List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor''&lt;/ref&gt; and reinforces the primordial purpose of governments and societies to effectively eliminate forced labor.&lt;ref&gt;1 ILO, Protocol to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930, Provisional Record, Geneva, 2014; available from [http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_246615.pdf the 2014 International Labour Conference Provisional Record (9A)], ILO, Recommendation on Supplementary Measures for the Effective Suppression of Forced Labour, Provisional Record, Geneva, 2014; available from [http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_norm/---relconf/documents/meetingdocument/wcms_246617.pdf the 2014 International Labour Conference Provisional Record (9B)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}

==A==
'''{{flag|Afghanistan}}''':
:[[Kabul]] (1774–present): Many scholars have argued that the city's name comes from the [[Kambojas|Kamboja]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnologische Forschungen und Sammlung von Material für dieselben, 1871, p 244, Adolf Bastian – Ethnology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The People of India: A Series of Photographic Illustrations, with ..., 1868, p 155, John William Kaye, Meadows Taylor, Great Britain India Office–Ethnology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Supplementary Glossary, p. 304, H. M. Elliot.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Various Census of India, 1867, p 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Memoir on Cuneiform Inscription, 1849, p 98, Cuneiform inscriptions; Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain &amp; Ireland, 1849, p 98, Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known in classical writings as Kophes or Kophene. The name could also be derived from Sanskrit कुब्ज "kambuja" meaning "hump-backed" or "crooked."

:[[Kandahar]] (1747–1774): There are many theories about the origin of the name Kandahar: 1. From the Pashto ''Iskanderiya'' (Alexandria);&lt;ref name=Alexander&gt;Lendering, Jona [http://www.livius.org/aj-al/alexandria/alexandria_arachosia.html Alexandria in Arachosia] at Livius (ancient history website), 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 2. From the name of the historical city of Gandahar;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120707232441/http://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:390.hobson CANDAHAR, n.p. Kandahār] entry in Hobson-Jobson Dictionary (of Anglo-Indian) at [[The Digital South Asia Library]], a project of the [[Center for Research Libraries]] and the [[University of Chicago]]&lt;/ref&gt; 3. From the word قند, ''kand'' or ''qand'' in the local languages (Persian and Pashto), meaning "sweet" and هر, ''har'' may be short for شهر, ''shahar'' (city or town).  The ancient word ''Gandh'', derived from ''Gandhar'' also means a sweet, nice smell. The city is a source of fine grapes, pomegranates, apricots, melons and other sweet fruits. 4. From two [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] words: ''kand'' (wall) and ''har'' (mountain, or stone), i.e., a city constructed of stone, or a stone-walled fortress. These words remain in use by the nomadic Indo-Pakistani [[Bagga]] and [[Sansi people|Sansi]] tribes.

'''{{flag|Albania}}''':
:[[Tirana]]: There are several hypotheses for the origins of Tirana's name: Tirana is thought to come from the word Theranda, mentioned in ancient Greek and Latin sources, which locals called The Rana, since the field was formed as result of solid materials that brought water from the surrounding mountains. Or, Tirana comes from Tirkan. Tirkan was a fortress on the mountain slope of Dajti. The ruins of this ancient castle still exist, dating back to the beginning of the first century before the birth of Christ, which is thought to have had a tower that Byzantium historian Prokop (shek. VI) called the tower of Tirkanit. Or, Tirana comes from old Greek Tyros (Τύρος) which means dairy. In the area of Tirana, dairy products made by shepherds from surrounding areas are traded. Or, Tirona, or Tirana as it is called in the dialect of the country, has its origins in what the people of this country are called. Given that the population located in this area come mainly from the mountains of the area around it, locals call them "Te Ronet" (the fallen). Even today, in everyday language, families who come from mountainous areas use the expression "have fallen (e.g.) in Durres" (or elsewhere). (J. N. Priska) The name of Tirana was mentioned for the first time in 1418 in a Venetian document.
:[[Durrës]] (1914–1920): via Latin Dyrrachium and Greek Δυρράχιον Dyrrachion meaning "bad spine" or "difficult ridge." The city's former name is Epidamnos Επίδαμνος meaning "The Damned" and is a cognate with Latin damnum meaning "loss" or "harm."
:[[Shkodër]] (1042–1385): The origins of the city's name remain shrouded in mystery. The name on coins minted in Hellenistic Scodra (during the rule of Genthius) have the legend (Greek: ΣΚΟΝΔΡΙΝΩΝ). Some believe the name has a Latin[who?] root, while others[who?] that the name was Illyrian. In the early 20th century, Shkodër was referred to in English by the Italian name Scutari. In Greek, it is known as Σκουτάριον (Scutarion) or Σκόδρα (Skodra), in Serbian, Croatian Montenegrin and Macedonian as Скадар (Skadar), and in Turkish as İşkodra. Some scholars[who?] believe that the name derives from "Shko-drin" which in Albanian means "where Drin goes", Drin being the Drin River that connects with the Buna River next to the castle of Rozafa.

'''{{flag|Algeria}}''':
:[[Algiers]]: Derived from the Arabic word "الجزائر" (al-ǧazāʼir), which translates as the islands, referring to the four islands which lay off that city's coast until becoming part of the mainland in 1525; al-ǧazāʼir is itself short for the older name جزائر بني مازغان ǧazāʼir banī mazġannā, "the islands of (the tribe) Bani Mazghanna", used by early medieval geographers such as al-Idrisi and Yaqut al-Hamawi.

'''{{flag|Andorra}}'''
:[[Andorra La Vella]]: "Andorra the Old" in Catalan.

'''{{flag|Angola}}''':
:[[Luanda]]/ Loanda: The place name comes from the root word Luanda lu-ndandu. The prefix lu, originally a plural forms of the Bantu languages, is common in the names of parts of coast of river basins or wetlands (examples: Luena, Lucala Lobito) and in this case, refers to the sandbank surrounded by the sea. Ndandu means value or traded and alludes to the exploitation of small shells collected the island of Luanda and which constituted the currency in the ancient Kingdom of Congo and much of the West African coast, known as zimbo or njimbo. As the Mbundu people shaped the pronunciation of place names in various regions of their manner of speaking, eliminating some sounds when they did not alter the meaning of the word, Lu-ndandu became Lu-andu. The word in Portuguese became feminine, since it referred to an island, and resulted in Luanda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.angola-saiago.net/cidmae15.html |title=O Lobito e o Umbigo do Mundo |language=Portuguese |author= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160621011658/http://www.angola-saiago.net/cidmae15.html |archivedate=2016-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Huambo]]: Etymology unknown; formerly known as Nova Lisboa meaning "New [[Lisbon]]" in Portuguese.

'''{{flag|Antigua and Barbuda}}''':
:[[Saint John's, Antigua and Barbuda|Saint John's]]: "Belonging to Saint John."

'''{{flag|Argentina}}''':
:[[Buenos Aires]]: "Fair Winds" in Spanish. The original settlement was called Ciudad de la Santísima Trinidad y Puerto de Nuestra Señora la Virgen María de los Buenos Aires ("City of the Most Holy Trinity and Port of Saint Mary of the Fair Winds"), after the site of the Santa Maria di Bonaria (Saint Mary of the Fair Winds) in Cagliari (Sardinia, Italy). The short form "Buenos Aires" became the common usage during the 17th century.
:[[Paraná, Entre Ríos|Paraná]] (confederate capital from 1852 to 1862): from the Guarani paraná, "wide river"; the words for "river", "large river", "lagoon", "sea" and "lake" have different meanings in Tupi, leading to confusion that Paraná meant sea.

'''{{flag|Armenia}}''':
:[[Yerevan]]: Early Christian Armenian chroniclers attributed Yerevan's origin to having been derived from an expression exclaimed by Noah, in Armenian, while looking in the direction of Yerevan, after the ark had landed on Mount Ararat and the flood waters had receded: "Yerevats!" ("it appeared!"). Another theory on the origin of the name is that the city was named after the Armenian king, Yervand IV (the Last), the last leader of the Orontid Dynasty and founder of the city of Yervandashat. However, it is likely that the city's name is derived from an Urartian military fortress called Erebuni (Էրեբունի), which was founded on the territory of modern-day Yerevan in 782 B.C. by Argishti I. As elements of the Urartian language blended with that of the Armenian one, it eventually evolved into Yerevan; scholar Margarit Israelyan notes these changes when comparing inscriptions found on two cuneiform tablets at Erebuni: The transcription of the second cuneiform bu [original emphasis] of the word was very essential in our interpretation as it is the Urartaean b that has been shifted to the Armenian v (b &gt; v). The original writing of the inscription read «er-bu-ni»; therefore the prominent Armenianologist–orientalist Prof. G. A. Ghapantsian justly objected, remarking that the Urartu b changed to v at the beginning of the word (Biani &gt; Van) or between two vowels (ebani &gt; avan, Zabaha &gt; Javakhk)....In other words b was placed between two vowels. The true pronunciation of the fortress-city was apparently Erebuny.

'''{{flag|Australia}}''':
:[[Canberra]]: The word "Canberra" is derived from the word Kanbarra meaning "meeting place" in the old [[Ngunnawal language]] of the local [[Ngabri]] people. Alternatively the name was reported to mean "woman's breasts", by journalist [[John Gale (journalist)|John Gale]] in the 1860s, referring to the mountains of [[Mount Ainslie]] and [[Black Mountain (Australian Capital Territory)|Black Mountain]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crispinhull.com.au/book-on-canberra/chapter-2-european-settlement-and-the-naming-of-canberra/ Australia’s National Capital by Crispin Hull], Ch. 2 European settlement and the naming of Canberra&lt;/ref&gt; The Ngunnawal name was apparently used as a reference to [[corroboree]]s held during the seasonal migration of the [[Ngunnawal people]] to feast on the [[Bogong moth]]s that pass through the region each spring.
:[[Melbourne]] (1901–1927): "Mill Stream" or "Mill Spring."

'''{{flag|Austria}}''':
:[[Vienna]]: German Wien: from Celtic Vindobona (vindo "white" + bona "foundation, fort")

'''{{flag|Azerbaijan}}''':
:[[Baku]]: The name Baku is widely believed to be derived from the old [[Persian language|Persian]] names of the city باد-که ''Bād-kube'', meaning "Wind-pounded city", in which ''bād'' means "wind" and ''kube'' is rooted in the verb کوبی ''kubidan'', "to pound", thus referring to a place where wind is strong and pounding. Indeed, the city is renowned for its fierce winter snow storms and harsh winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php|title=Culture &amp; Religion on Podium: Politicizing Linguistics |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2009-07-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013212555/http://iranchamber.com/podium/culture/020920_politicizing_linguistics.php |archivedate = 2007-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that Baku refers to ''Baghkuh'', meaning "Mount of God". ''𐎲𐎠𐎥𐎠'' ''Baga'' and ''𐎣𐎠𐎢𐎳𐎠'' ''kaufa'' (now ''kuh'') are the [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]] words for "god" and "mountain" respectively; the name ''Baghkuh'' may be compared with ''[[Baghdad|Baghdād]]'' ("God-given") in which ''dād'' is the Old Persian word for "give". [[Arabic language|Arabic]] sources refer to the city as ''Baku'', ''Bakukh'', ''Bakuya'', and ''Bakuye'', all of which seem to come from a Persian name.&lt;br&gt;Various different hypotheses were also proposed to explain the etymology of the word ''Baku''. According to L.G. Lopatinski&lt;ref&gt;Ган К.Ф. Oпыть объяснения кавказских географических названий. Тифлис, 1909&lt;/ref&gt; and Ali Huseynzade&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;.[http://window2baku.com/eng/9002toponimbaku.htm The Name “Baku”&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Baku'' is derived from Turkic word for "hill". Caucasian history specialist K.P. Patkanov also explains the name as "hill" but in the [[Lak language]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The Turkish ''Islamic Encyclopedia'' presents the origin of the word ''Baku'' as being derived from the words ''Bey-Kyoy'', which mean "the main city" in Turkic. Also another theory suggests that the name Baku is derived from the ancient [[Caucasian Albania]]n city called Baguan.
:[[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]] (June–December 1918): Modern historians believe that the Persian name Ganja (گنجه / ''Ganjeh'', "Ganja" derives from the [[New Persian]] ''ganj'' (گنج: "treasure, treasury")) suggests that the city existed in pre-Islamic times and was likely founded in the fifth century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/index.isc?Article=http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/unicode/v10f3/v10f372.html Encyclopedia Iranica, "Ganja", C. Edmund Bosworth]&lt;/ref&gt; The area in which Ganja is located was known as [[Arran (Caucasus)|Arran]] from the ninth to twelfth century; its urban population spoke mainly the [[Persian language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kulichki.com/~gumilev/HE2/he2103.htm История Востока. В 6 т. Т. 2. Восток в средние века.] М., «Восточная литература», 2002. {{ISBN|5-02-017711-3}} (History of the East. In 6 volumes. Volume 2. Moscow, publishing house of the Russian Academy of sciences "East literature"): The polyethnic population of Albania left-bank at this time is increasingly moving to the Persian language. Mainly this applies to cities of Aran and [[Shirvan]], beginning from the 9th to 10th centuries in the two named main areas in the territory of Azerbaijan. With regard to the rural population, it would seem they largely retained their old languages for a long time, related to the modern Daghestanian family, especially Lezgin. (Russian text: Пестрое в этническом плане население левобережной Албании в это время все больше переходит на персидский язык. Главным образом это относится к городам Арана и Ширвана, как стали в IX-Х вв. именоваться два главные области на территории Азербайджана.

'''{{flag|Belarus}}''':
:[[Minsk]]: The Old East Slavic name of the town was Мѣньскъ (i.e. Měnsk &lt; Early Proto-Slavic or Late Indo-European Mēnĭskŭ), derived from a river name Měn (&lt; Mēnŭ, with the same etymology as German [[Main River|Main]]; from Latin Moenus or Menus). The direct continuation of this name in Belarusian is ''Miensk'' (pronounced {{IPA-be|ˈmʲɛnsk|}}). In the 16th and 17th centuries, however, the pronunciation of this name in the Ruthenian language common to the ancestors of Belarusians, Rusyns and Ukrainians was influenced by the pronunciation of *ě as i in many Ukrainian dialects. The resulting form of the name, Minsk (spelled either Минскъ or Мѣнскъ) was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: Минск) and Polish (Mińsk), and under the influence especially of Russian it also became official in Belarusian. However, some Belarusian-speakers continue to use Miensk (spelled Мeнск) as their preferred name for the city. Another explanation of the origins of the modern form of the name, Minsk, is the strong Ukrainian influence in the Belarusian lexicography in the 1920s, which resulted in the Ukrainian-like i vocalisation of then-deprecated ѣ.&lt;ref&gt;Such influence is also evidenced in some then-constructed Belarusian linguistic terminology, like words for verb (''дзеяслоў'') and others. Per ''Uladzimir Anichenka. Ukrainisms'' in ''Encyclopedia of literature and arts of Belarus. V.5, p.351'' (''У. В. Анічэнка. Украінізмы // Энцыклапедыя літаратуры і мастацтва Беларусі. У 5 т. Т.5.

He then renamed the area from "Kumbee-Tenga", as the Ninsi had called it, to "Wogodogo", meaning "where people get honor and respect." Ouagadougou is a corruption of Wogodogo. The spelling of the name Ouagadougou is derived from the French orthography common in former French African colonies. The country changed its name from 'Upper Volta' to Burkina Faso in the 1980s.

:[[Assinie]] (1889–1893)
:[[Grand Bassam]] (1843–1889 and 1893–1900): On the origin of the name of Bassam, there are several theories. According to Professor Niangoran Bouah, ethno-sociologist Bassam was not a village, which the very first capital of the Ivory Coast has given its name.{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} He has two hypotheses for the origin of the word Bassam. On the one hand it could descend from the N'Zima word Bazouam, which is a cry for help. One woman called out N'Zima to a European, and this was mistaken for the name of the place. The second thesis stems from the language of Abour, from the word alsam (Abour for: dusk) developed by linguistic convenience to Abassam and later Bassam. Niangoran Bouah tends to attach more weight to the second thesis.

'''{{flag|Croatia}}''':
:[[Zagreb]]: The name Zagreb appears to have been recorded in 1094, although the origins of the name Zagreb are less clear. The Croatian word "zagrabiti" translates approximately to "scoop", which forms the basis of some legends. One Croat legend says that a Croat ban (viceroy) was leading his thirsty soldiers across a deserted region. He drove his sabre into the ground in frustration and water poured out so he ordered his soldiers to dig for water. The idea of digging or unearthing is supported by scientists who suggest that the settlement was established beyond a water-filled hole or graba and that the name derives from this. Some suggest that the name derives from the term 'za breg' or beyond the hill. The hill may well have been the river bank of the River Sava, which is believed to have previously flowed closer to the city centre. From here, the words may have been fused into one word and, thus, the name Zagreb was born. According to another legend, a city ruler was thirsty and ordered a girl named Manda to take water from Lake Manduševac (nowadays a fountain), using the sentence: "Zagrabi, Mando!" which means, Scoop it, Manda!. A less probable theory is that the name Zagreb is believed to be related to the Zagros mountains of Iran. The name probably comes from "zagrabiti" (Eng. draw (water). Conscience) According to sources, Zagreb means "behind the mountains" (Croat. "za grebom)". Agram is the historic Austrian German name of the city. That was its official name from 1557 to 1918.
:[[Varaždin]] (1767–1776): Derived from the Croatian phrase Varaždinske Toplice meaning "Thermal Spas".
:[[Knin]] (925–10??): Etymology unknown and disputed.

'''{{flag|Cyprus}}''':
:[[Nicosia]]: Mispronunciation of the city's Greek name Λευκωσία Lefkosia and its Turkish name Lefkoşa, both of which mean "White City".

'''{{flag|Czech Republic}}''':
:[[Prague]]: The name Prague comes from an old Slavic root, praga, which means "ford", referring to the city's origin at a crossing of the Vltava River. The native name of the city, Praha, is also related to the modern Czech word práh ("threshold"). A legendary etymology connects the name of the city with duchess Libuše, prophetess and a wife of mythical founder of the Přemyslid dynasty. She is said to have ordered "the city to be built where a man hews a threshold of his house". Czech práh shall be understood here as to be in the river, rapids or cataract: its edge as a passage to the other riverside. Contrarily, although there are a few weirs nowadays, no such geological threshold was discovered in the river under the Prague Castle. Thus some derive the name Praha from the stone of the hill, where the original castle was built: na prazě, the original term for shale rock. (In those days, there were forests around the castle, on the nine hills of the future city: the Old Town on the other riverbank as well as the Lesser Town underneath the castle appeared later.)

:[[Copenhagen]]: Derived from the city's Danish name København, which means "Merchant's Harbor" in Danish.
:[[Roskilde]] (?–1443): Named after King Roar.

'''{{flag|Djibouti}}''':
:[[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]]: Named after the bottom point of the Gulf of Tadjoura. Possibly derived from the Afar word gabouti, a type of doormat made of palm fibres. Another plausible, but unproven, etymology is that "Djibouti" means "Land of Tehuti" or Land of Thoth, after the Egyptian moon god.
:[[Obock]] (1862 – April 1892): The original name of the place is Afar Ḥáyyu or Ḥayyú ( "enough") and refers to the mangroves which used to be there and ensured survival of camels in times of drought. In 1862 France purchased Obock from the local Afar sultans and created a coaling station for ships. Thus began the colonization of present-day Djibouti. Oboḫ is derived from 'As Ōbóki, a designation for the middle section of Oued Dár'i. Obock was the first capital of the Territoire d'Obock, but since there was little water there, in 1881 the colonial administration made the city of Djibouti its new center.

:[[Solor]] (1642–1695)

'''{{flag|Ecuador}}''':
:[[Quito]]: Named after the Quitu tribe. The name is a combination of two [[Tsafiki language|Tsafiki]] words: "Quitso" ("center") and "To" ("the world"); hence therefore "Quito" probably means "center of the world."
:[[Riobamba]] (November 4, 1859 – January 12, 1960): The Rio part of the name means "River" and the Bamba part of the name has an unknown meaning.

'''{{flag|Egypt}}''':
:[[Cairo]]: From Arabic القاهرة al-Qāhira, meaning "The Victorious."
:[[al-Fustat]] (905–969): The city's name comes from the Arabic word ''fusṭāṭ'' (فسطاط) which means a large tent or pavilion. According to tradition, the location of Fustat was chosen by a bird: A dove laid an egg in the tent of [['Amr ibn al-'As]], the Muslim conqueror of Egypt, just before he was to march on Alexandria. His camp at that time was just north of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] fortress of [[Babylon Fortress|Babylon]].&lt;ref&gt;* {{cite book|author=Yeomans, Richard|title=The Art and Architecture of Islamic Cairo|year=2006|publisher=Garnet &amp; Ithaca Press|isbn=1-85964-154-7|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eyewitness&gt;* {{cite book|title=Eyewitness Travel: Egypt|date=2007|isbn=978-0-7566-2875-8 |publisher=Dorlin Kindersley Limited, London|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amr declared this as a sign from God, and the tent was left untouched as he and his troops went off to battle.  When they returned victorious, Amr told his soldiers to pitch their tents around his, giving his new capital city its name, Miṣr al-Fusṭāṭ, or Fusṭāṭ Miṣr,&lt;ref name="D59"&gt;{{cite book| last=David | first=Rosalie |title=The Experience of Ancient Egypt| year=2000 | isbn=0-415-03263-6 | location=London; New York | publisher=Routledge|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; popularly translated as "City of the tents", though this is not an exact translation. The word Miṣr was an ancient Semitic root designating Egypt, but in Arabic also has the meaning of a large city or metropolis (or, as a verb, "to civilize"), so the name Miṣr al-Fusṭāṭ could mean "Metropolis of the Tent". Fusṭāṭ Miṣr would mean "The Pavilion of Egypt".&lt;ref&gt;Since it lacks the article on the word Miṣr it would not be "The Pavilion of the Metropolis".&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptians to this day call Cairo "Miṣr", or, colloquially, Maṣr, even though this is properly the name of the whole country of Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;"Notes on the Jews in Fustāt from Cambridge Genizah Documents" by [[Ernest Worman]], ''[[Jewish Quarterly Review]]'', Oct. 1905, pp. 1–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The country's first Islamic mosque, the [[Mosque of Amr ibn al-As|Mosque of Amr]], was later built on the same site of the commander's tent, in 642.&lt;ref name="D59"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Petersen | first=Andrew |title=Dictionary of Islamic Architecture| year=1999 | isbn=0-415-21332-0 | location=London; New York | publisher=Routledge|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{flag|Honduras}}''':
:[[Tegucigalpa]]: The exact meaning of Tegucigalpa has yet to be determined. The most widespread theory is that it comes from the Nahuatl ''Teguz-Galp'', which means "silver hills", but it is difficult to sustain as the natives were ignorant of the existence of minerals in the area. ''Togogalpa'' refers to the "tototi", a green parakeet, in Nahuatl. Toncontín, a town not far from Tegucigalpa, has the same name as a Mexican dance of Nahuatl origin that was used in the 17th-century Baroque theatre. In Mexico there is a belief that Tegucigalpa derives from Nahuatl ''Tecuztlicallipan'', "place of residence of the noble" or ''Tecuhtzincalpan'', "place at the home of the beloved master". The Honduran philologist Alberto Membreño argued that it derived from a Nahuatl word meaning "in the houses of the sharp stones". He also notes that in colonial times, Taguzgalpa was the name used for the region of eastern Honduras, including today's department of Gracias a Dios and part of the departments of Olancho, Colon and El Paraiso.
:[[Comayagua]] (1573–1824, alternate until October 30, 1880): Comayagua's name derives from the indigenous language 'Lenca' which means "Moor of abundant water."

'''{{flag|Hungary}}''':
:[[Budapest]]: Hungarian capital, formed 1872 from merger of two cities on opposite shores of the Danube, Buda (probably from a word originally meaning "water") + Pest, a Slavic name meaning "furnace, oven, cove" (cf. Rus. Печь pech').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Budapest&lt;/ref&gt; The city was known as Pest-Buda from 1848 to 1873.
:[[Székesfehérvár]] and [[Esztergom]] (1000–1256): The name Székesfehérvár means "white castle with the chair/seat" and the city is known by translations of this in other languages ([[Latin:]] Alba Regia, [[German:]] Stuhlweißenburg, [[Slovak:]] Stoličný Belehrad, [[Serbian:]] [[Стони Београд]] Stoni Beograd, Croatian: Stolni Biograd, Slovene: Stolni Belograd, Czech: Stoličný Bělehrad, Polish: Białogród Stołeczny or Białogród Królewski, Turkish: İstolni Belgrad). In Hungarian, the city is known colloquially as Fehérvár.
:The word szék (meaning "seat" as "throne") is related to its important role in the 1st centuries of the Kingdom of Hungary: székhely means a (royal) residence, center. In accordance with the obligation from the Doctrine of the Holy Crown, the first kings of Hungary were crowned and buried here. The Roman town was called Solva. The name Esztergom was first mentioned in documents in 1079. Some think the name comes from Isztergam ('Ister' meaning Danube and Gam referring to the nearby river Garam). The town is the seat of Etzel / Attila in the Niebelungenlied as Gran (German: Gran (help·info)). In Croatian Ostrogon, in Polish Ostrzyhom, in Slovak Ostrihom, in Medieval Latin Strigonium, and in Turkish Estergon. In around 1250, the town was known to Germans as Österheim; another hypothesis could see a similar-sounding original earlier name of Germanic origin, later to be Magyarized in Esztergom.
:[[Buda]] (1265–1536): The name Buda takes its name from the name of the ruler Bleda the Hun, whose name is also Buda in Hungarian. The Roman name for Buda was Aquincum ("aqua" means "water" in Latin.)
:Pozsony (1536–1848): See Bratislava below.

'''{{flag|India}}''':
:[[New Delhi]]: See Delhi below.
:[[Delhi]] (1192–1327, 1344–1501, and 1648–1858): The etymology of "Delhi" is uncertain, but many possibilities exist. The most common view is that its eponym is Dhillu or Dilu, a king of the Mauryan dynasty, who built the city in 50 BCE and named it after himself. The Hindi/Prakrit word dhili ("loose") was used by the Tuar Rajputs to refer to the city because the Iron Pillar built by Raja Dhava had a weak foundation and was replaced. The coins in circulation in the region under the Rajputs were called dehliwal. Some other historians believe that the name is derived from Dilli, a corruption of dehleez or dehali—Hindi for 'threshold'—and symbolic of the city as a gateway to the Indo-Gangetic Plains. Another theory suggests that the city's original name was Dhillika.
:[[Daulatabad, Maharashtra|Daulatabad]] (1327–1344) (Marathi दौलताबाद; Persian دولت‌آباد meaning "City of Prosperity")
:[[Agra]] (1501–1540): Derived from Sanskrit Agrevaṇa (अग्रेवण), or 'the border of the forest'. The name was first mentioned in the epic [[Mahabharata|Mahābhārata]].
:[[Chennai]]: The origin of the word Chennai is disputed. There are two different theories for the origin of the name Chennai:
:*The first theory is that it was derived from the name of a ruler Damarla Chennappa Nayakudu, Nayaka of Chandragiri and Vandavasi, father of Damarla Venkatadri Nayakudu, from whom the English acquired the town in 1639. The first official use of the name Chennai is said to be in a sale deed, dated 8 August 1639, to Francis Day of the East India Company.
:*The second theory states that it was named after the Chenna Kesava Perumal Temple; the word chenni in Tamil means face, with the temple regarded as the face of the city. The former name of the city is Madras.

:The name Madras originated even before the British presence was established in India.
:Multiple explanations attempt to account for the city's colonial name, Madras:
:*Allegedly it derived from Madraspattinam, a fishing village north of Fort St George. However, it is uncertain whether the name 'Madraspattinam' was in use before the arrival of European influence.
:*The military mapmakers believed Madras was originally Mundir-raj, or abbreviatedly, Mundiraj.
:*Other arguments suggest that the Portuguese, who arrived in the area in the 16th century, named the village Madre de Deus, meaning Mother of God.
:*Another possibility sees the village's name coming from the prominent Madeiros family of Portuguese origin, which consecrated the Madre de Deus Church in the Santhome locality of Chennai in 1575.
:*Another theory concludes that the name Madras was given to Chennapattanam after it was taken from a similarly named Christian priest.
:*Other parties express the opinion that Madras might have taken its name from a fisherman by the name of Madrasan from religious Muslim schools, referred to as Madrasahs, from the word Madhu-ras, which means "honey" in Sanskrit.

:[[Fatehpur Sikri]] (1570–1585): The name ''Fateh'' is Arabic in origin and means "victory", also in the Urdu and Persian languages. The name means "City of Victory". The city was founded in 1569 by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]], and served as the capital of the Mughal Empire from 1571 to 1585. 
:[[Lahore]] (1585–1599; now in Pakistan): A legend based on oral traditions holds that Lahore, known in ancient times as लाहोर Lavapuri (City of Lava in Sanskrit) was founded by Prince [[Lava (Ramayana)|Lava]], the son of [[Rama]], while [[Kasur]] was founded by his twin brother Prince [[Kusha (Ramayana)|Kusha]]. To this day, Lahore Fort has a vacant temple dedicated to Lava (also pronounced Loh, hence Loh-awar or "The Fort of Loh").
:[[Ajmer]] (1613–1616): Derived from Sanskrit अजय-मेरु meaning "Invincible Spine".
British India
:[[Calcutta]] (1774 – December 12, 1911): The name Kolkata and the anglicised name Calcutta have their roots in Kalikata, the name of one of the three villages (Kalikata, Sutanuti, Govindapur) in the area before the arrival of the British. "Kalikata", in turn, is believed to be a version of Kalikshetra (কালীক্ষেত্র, "Land of [the goddess] Kali"). Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Bengali term kilkila ("flat area"). Again, the name may have its origin in the indigenous term for a natural canal, Khal, followed by Katta (which may mean dug). Another theory is that the place used to specialize in quicklime (kalicun) and coir rope (kátá) and hence the place was called Kalikátá.
:While the city's name was always pronounced "Kolkata" or "Kolikata" in the local Bengali language, its official English name was changed from "Calcutta" to "Kolkata" in 2001, reflecting the Bengali pronunciation. Some view this as a move to erase the legacy of British rule. This change has not always been reflected by overseas media, but news sources like the BBC have opted to call Bombay Mumbai and Calcutta Kolkata.
:[[Shimla|Simla]] (Summer Capital 1911–1947): Named after the Hindu Goddess Shyamala Devi.

'''{{flag|Indonesia}}''':
:[[Jakarta]]: The city's name is derived from the Sanskrit word "Jayakarta" (जयकर्) which translates as "victorious deed", "complete act,"or "complete victory." The city was known as Djakarta from August 17, 1945 to 1971 and Batavia from 1619 to August 1945 and from 1947 to December 1949.{{contradict-inline|reason=The time period 1947-1949 is accounted for twice. Djakarta or Batavia, or both?|date=February 2016}} Batavia is named after a region in the Netherlands which was named after the Batavi tribe who inhabited that area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Batavia&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Yogyakarta]] (January 1946 – August 1950): The city's name is of Sanskrit origin. Derived from Sanskrit: योग्य जय कर्ता meaning "Sufficient Victorious Deed".
:[[Bukittinggi]] (During the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], the city was the headquarters for the [[Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia]] (PDRI) from December 19, 1948 to July 13, 1949): [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] for "high hill".

'''{{flag|Iran}}''':
:[[Tehran]]: Derived from Persian تهران (Tehrān) meaning "modern".
:[[Shiraz]] (1750–1788): The earliest reference to the city is on Elamite clay tablets dated to 2000 BC, found in June 1970, while digging to make a kiln for a brick factory in the south western corner of the city. The tablets written in ancient Elamite name a city called Tiraziš. Phonetically, this is interpreted as /tiračis/ or /ćiračis/. This name became Old Persian /širājiš/; through regular sound change comes the modern Persian name Shirāz. The name Shiraz also appears on clay sealings found at a 2nd-century AD Sassanid ruin, east of the city. By some of the native writers, the name Shiraz was derived from a son of Tahmuras, the third Shāh (King) of the world according to Ferdowsi's Shāhnāma.
:[[Mashhad]] (مشهد) (1750–1736): literally the place of martyrdom in Persian.
:[[Isfahan]] (1598–1736): A variant of Sepahan, meaning "The Armies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/isfahan-iv-pre-islamic-period], Encyclopedia Iranica: Isfahan&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Qazvin]] (1548–1598): Derived from the word کس Cas meaning "people".
:[[Tabriz]] (1295–1305 and 1469–1538): According to some sources, including ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', the name Tabriz derives from "tap-riz" ("causing heat to flow" in Iranian languages), from the many thermal springs in the area. Other sources claim that in AD 246, to avenge his brother's death, king Khosraw I of Armenia defeated Ardashir I of the Sassanid Empire and changed the name of the city from Shahistan to Tauris, deriving from "ta-vrezh" ("this revenge" in Grabar). In AD 297, it became the capital of Tiridates III, king of Armenia. However, this story has popular origin and no ancient source has recorded such an event. This is based on accounts of Vardan, the Armenian historian in the 14th century.

'''{{flag|Iraq}}''':
:[[Baghdad]] (بغداد): "Given by God" in Persian. There have been several rival proposals as to its specific etymology. The most reliable and most widely accepted among these is that the name is a [[Persian language|Persian]] compound of '''Bağ''' "garden" + '''dād''' "fair", translating to "The fair Garden",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seenjeem.maktoob.com/question?category_id=4&amp;level=L2&amp;question_id=9510 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DevdlcRr?url=http://en-maktoob.yahoo.com/?p=xa |archivedate=2013-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://egabat.google.com/ejabat/thread?tid=6981074380f32f74 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DeveznDi?url=http://ejabat.google.com/ejabat/thread?tid=6981074380f32f74 |archivedate=2013-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Persian language|Persian]] compound of Bag "god" + dād "given", translating to "God-given" or "God's gift", whence [[Persian language|Modern Persian]] Baγdād.  This in turn can be traced to Old Persian and Sanskrit Bhaagadata. Another leading proposal is that the name comes from Middle Persian Bāgh-dād "The Given Garden". The name is pre-Islamic and the origins are unclear, but it is related to previous settlements which did not have any political or commercial power, making it a virtually new foundation in the time of the [[Abbasids]]. Mansur called the city "Madinat as-Salam", or "City of Peace", as a reference to paradise. This was the official name on coins, weights, and other things.
'''{{flag|Ireland}}''':
:[[Dublin]]: Derived from Irish ''Dubb Linn'' meaning "Black pool". The city's native name ''Baile Átha Cliath'' means "Town of the Hurdled Ford".

'''{{flag|Israel}}''':
:[[Jerusalem]]: via Latin Hierosolyma and Greek Ἱεροσόλυμα/ Ιερουσαλήμ Hierousalem, ultimately from Hebrew יְרוּשָׁלַיִם Yerushaláyim meaning "abode of peace." Derived from a compound of two Semitic base words: yarah ("y-r-h") "he threw, cast"+shalom ("s-l-m") "peace.".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Jerusalem&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jewish legend, It was named Yeru ("fear" [of G-d]) by Melkizedek ([[Shem]]), and Shalem (peace) by [[Abraham]], so G-d combined them to make Yeru-Shalaim.
:[[Tel Aviv]] (1948 – January 23, 1950): From Hebrew תֵּל־אָבִיב, meaning "Spring Mound" in Hebrew. The city's full name is Tel Aviv-Yafo (Hebrew: תֵּל־אָבִיב-יָפוֹ; Arabic: تل أبيب, Tall ʼAbīb).  The name ''Tel Aviv'' (literally "Spring Mound") was chosen in 1910 from among many suggestions, including "Herzliya". ''Tel Aviv'' is the Hebrew title of [[Theodor Herzl]]'s book [[The Old New Land|''Altneuland'']] ("Old New Land"), translated from German by [[Nahum Sokolow]]. Sokolow took the name from [[book of Ezekiel|Ezekiel]] 3:15: "Then I came to them of the captivity at Tel Aviv, that lived by the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|river Chebar]], and to where they lived; and I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days."&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Ezekiel]] 3:15&lt;/ref&gt; This name was found fitting as it embraced the idea of the renaissance of the ancient Jewish homeland. ''Aviv'' is Hebrew for "spring", symbolizing renewal, and ''tel'' is an [[archaeological site]] that reveals layers of civilization built one over the other.&lt;ref name="VTLV"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vie/Telaviv.html |title=Tel Aviv |accessdate=2007-07-18 |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theories vary about the etymology of Jaffa or ''Yafo'' in Hebrew. Some believe that the name derives from ''yafah'' or ''yofi'', Hebrew for "beautiful" or "beauty". Another tradition is that [[Japheth]], son of [[Noah]], founded the city and that it was named for him. The name is also transliterated as ''Tel-Abib'' in the [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]].

'''{{flag|Italy}}''':
:[[Rome]]: The legendary origin of the city's name is the traditional founder and first ruler. It is said that Romulus and Remus decided to build a city. After an argument, Romulus killed his brother Remus. Then he named it after himself, Rome. More recently, attempts have been made to find a linguistic root for the name ''Rome''. Possibilities include derivation from [[Greek language]] ''Ῥώμη'' meaning bravery, courage;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and his "[[The Social Contract]]", Book IV, Chapter IV, written in 1762, where he writes in a footnote that the word for Rome is Greek in origin and means force. "''There are writers who say that the name 'Rome' is derived from 'Romulus'. It is in fact Greek and means force.''"&lt;/ref&gt; possibly the connection is with a root ''*rum-'', "teat", with possible reference to the totem wolf that adopted and suckled the cognately named twins [[Romulus and Remus]]. Etruscan gives us the word ''Rumach'', "from Rome", from which Ruma can be extracted. Its further etymology, as with that of most Etruscan words, remains unknown. The [[Basque people|Basque]] scholar Manuel de Larramendi thought that the origin could be related to the [[Basque language]] word ''orma'' (modern Basque ''kirreal''), "wall".
:[[Brindisi]] (September 9, 1943 – February 1944): The Latin name Brundisium comes from the Greek Brentesion (Βρεντήσιον) meaning "deer's head", which refers to the shape of the natural harbor.
:[[Florence]] (1865 – December 1, 1870): Derived from "Florentia" meaning "the flourishing" in Latin.
:[[Turin]] (1861–1865): Named after the Taurini people. Their name could be derived from ''[[wiktionary:taurus|taurus]]'', meaning "the bull", or from the Celtic verb ''tau'' meaning "mountain".

:[[Akmola Region|Akmola]] (1997 – May 6, 1998): Akmola (in Kazakh language: Ақмола) means the white burial.
:[[Almaty]] (1993 – December 10, 1997): The name "Almaty" derives from the Kazakh word for "apple" (алма), and thus is often translated as "full of apples". The older Soviet-era Russian version of its name, Alma-Ata, originates from the saint's tomb, buried in an apple orchard, whence the name, "Saint of the Apple (orchard)" or "Father of Apples".{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} "Ata" standing for father in Kazakh and many other Turkic languages, also stands for a saint or a priest, as the term "padre" in the Romance languages. The old name for the new capital of Kazakhstan, Astana was Akmolinsk/Akmola, "White Shrine/Mausoleum", a reference to another saint's burial ground.
:In fact, in the region surrounding Almaty, there is a great genetic diversity among the wild apples; the region is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild ''[[Malus sieversii]]'' is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple. The area is often visited by researchers and scientists from around the world in order to learn more about the complex systems of genetics, and also to discover the true beginnings of the domestic apple.
:[[Orenburg]] (1919–1924; now in Russia): "fortress near the [[Or River|Or]]."
:[[Kzyl-Orda]] (1925–1929): Kyzylorda was founded in 1820 as a Kokand fortress of Ak-Mechet (also spelt Aq Masjid, Aq Mechet, 'white mosque'). Yaqub Beg was the fort's commander until it was taken by the Russian troops of General Vasily Alekseevich Perovsky in 1853. The Russians renamed the fort Fort Perovsky (Russian: Форт Перовский,1853–1867). Since 1867, it was the city of Perovsk (Russian: Перовск); since 1922, Ak-Mechet (Ак-Мечеть) again. In 1925, the city became Kzzyl-Orda, from Kazakh Қызыл qyzyl 'red' and орда orda 'center', 'capital city'.

Its current name originated from the Korean word meaning "capital city", which is believed to be derived from Seorabeol (서라벌; 徐羅伐), which originally referred to Gyeongju, the capital of Silla.
:Unlike most place names in Korea, "Seoul" has no corresponding hanja (Chinese characters used in the Korean language). The recently chosen Chinese name for Seoul is 首尔 (simplified), 首爾 (traditional) (Shǒuěr), which sounds somewhat similar to "Seoul" when pronounced in Mandarin Chinese.

The name is most likely a patronymic of the personal name *Prišь, preserved as a surname in Polish Przysz and Sorbian Priš, a hypochoristic of the Slavic personal name Pribyslavъ. A false etymology connects the name Priština with Serbo-Croatian prišt (пришт), meaning 'ulcer' or 'tumor', referring to its 'boiling'. However, this explanation cannot be correct, as Slavic place names ending in -ina corresponding to an adjective and/or name of an inhabitant lacking this suffix are built from personal names or denote a person and never derive, under these conditions, from common nouns (SNOJ 2007: loc. cit.).

'''{{flag|Monaco}}''':
:[[Monaco-Ville]]: Monaco's name comes from the nearby Phocaean Greek colony, in the 6th century. Referred to the Ligurians as Monoikos, from the Greek μόνοικος "single house", from μόνος "alone, single" + οίκος "house", which bears the sense of a people either settled in a "single habitation" or of "living apart" from others. Another Greek word etymologically related to the name of this principality is μόνaκος which means "alone" from which the word monastery and monasticism are derived. According to an ancient myth, Hercules passed through the Monaco area and turned away the previous gods. As a result, a temple was constructed there, the temple of Hercules Monoikos. Because the only temple of this area was the "House" of Hercules, the city was called Monoikos.

'''{{flag|Mongolia}}''':
:[[Ulaanbaatar]]: From Mongolian Улаанбаатар, ᠤᠯᠠᠭᠠᠨ ᠪᠠᠭᠠᠲᠤᠷ, meaning "The Red Hero." Ulan Bator has had numerous names in its history.

Upon independence in 1911, with both the secular government and the Bogd Khan's palace present, the city's name changed to Niislel Khüree (Mongolian: Нийслэл = "capital", Хүрээ = "camp").
:When the city became the capital of the new Mongolian People's Republic in 1924, its name was changed to Ulaanbaatar (Улаанбаатар, classical script:, Ulaγan Baγatur), literally "red hero"), in honor of Mongolia's national hero Damdin Sükhbaatar, whose warriors, shoulder-to-shoulder with the Soviet Red Army, liberated Mongolia from Ungern von Sternberg's troops and Chinese occupation. His statue still adorns Ulan Bator's central square.
:In Europe and North America, Ulan Bator was generally known as Urga (from Örgöö) or sometimes Kuren (from Khüree) or Kulun (from 庫倫, the Chinese transcription of Khüree) before 1924, and Ulan Bator afterwards, after the Russian: Улан-Батор.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The Russian spelling is different from the Mongolian because it was defined phonetically, and the Cyrillic script was only introduced in Mongolia seventeen years later. By Mongols, the city was nicknamed Aziin Tsagaan Dagina (White Maiden of Asia) in the late 20th century. It is now sometimes sarcastically called Utaanbaatar (Smog Hero), due to the heavy layer of smog in winter.

Later, the town was renamed "Hanovi" (originally "Anovi") because it was where caravans rested. The modern name dates from 1870, when in a single day the building of a school, church and captain's home began. However, almost all the original buildings were destroyed during the Balkan Wars. All that has remained is the old church of Sv. Preobraženje (Holy Transfiguration), built in 1862 as a monument to a Montenegrin victory in the battle against the Turks. After Žabljak was established as a town, stores and cafés were opened. As such, in the 1880s Žabljak became a market town, leading it to become administrative center of the region.

(The root "mur" is used now in the Berber languages mostly in the feminine form "tamurt"). The same word "mur" appears in the country Mauritania, but this interpretation is still unproven to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Either Rabat, Fes, Meknes, or Marrakesh was the capital of Morocco from 1666 to 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Tafilalt]] (1631–1666): The name Tafilalt is a Berber name meaning "the Country of the Hilali", as its inhabitants are called, because they were descended from the Arabian tribe of Banu Hilal, who settled here.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Its formal title is Ratanapura (ရတနာပူရ; Pali: ऋअतनपुर), which means City of Gems in Pali. The name Innwa means mouth of the lake, which comes from in (အင်း), meaning lake, and wa (ဝ), which means mouth.

:[[Mandalay]] (1857–1886): The city gets its name from the nearby Mandalay Hill. The name is likely a derivative of a Pali word although the exact word of origin remains unclear.

This unique temple, also known as Maru Sthal, was built in 1596 by King Laxmi Narsingh Malla. The entire structure contains no iron nails or supports and is made entirely from wood. Legend has it that the timber used for this two-story pagoda was obtained from a single tree.

The Duke's title comes from the town of Wellington in the English county of Somerset. In Māori, Wellington goes by three names. Te Whanga-nui-a-Tara refers to Wellington Harbour and means "the great harbour of Tara". Pōneke is a transliteration of Port Nick, short for Port Nicholson (the city's central marae, the community supporting it and its kapa haka have the pseudo-tribal name of Ngāti Pōneke). Te Upoko-o-te-Ika-a-Māui, meaning The Head of the Fish of Māui (often shortened to Te Upoko-o-te-Ika), a traditional name for the southernmost part of the North Island, derives from the legend of the fishing up of the island by the demi-god Māui.

'''{{flag|Niger}}''':
:[[Niamey]] (1903–1910; 1926–present): The quarter-Mouray Kwaratagui is the historic center of the city of Niamey. The region of Niamey was inhabited for a very long time by people like Voltaic Gourmantchés. But the founders of the village would be Maouri Niamey, Matankari from the late nineteenth century. They were installed on an island called Neni Goungou facing the current Niamey, before coming to settle on the left bank of the Niger, beside a tree that the village would later call Nia Niam ("The name of the tree and me" in Djerma), meaning shore where it draws water. The village of Niamey was inhabited by about 600 people in 1901 when the Lenfant mission arrived. With the arrival of French rule, the city began to prosper. Niamey was then the chief town of the circle Djerma which includes the area between the river and the Dallol Bosso. Niamey became Niger's capital December 28, 1926, replacing Zinder.

The earlier spelling suggests that the first component refers either to the Ekeberg ridge southeast of the town ("ås" in modern Norwegian), or to the [[Aesir]]. The most likely interpretations would therefore be either "the meadow beneath the ridge" or "the meadow of the gods". Both are equally plausible. See [[Oslo#Name]]

'''{{flag|Palau}}''':
:[[Ngerulmud]] (since October 7, 2006): From the [[Palauan language|Palauan]] meaning "place of fermented ''mud''" (''mud'' being the native name for ''[[Centropyge tibicen]]'', the keyhole angelfish). Before being chosen as the site of the new capitol, Ngerulmud was the name given to a large hill in sight of the ocean on which women would communally gather to offer fermented angelfish to the gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liston|first=Jolie|date=2011|title=Pacific Island Heritage: Archaeology, Identity &amp; Community|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=mwn4Q-vmHmYC|location= |publisher= Australian National University|page=192|isbn= 1921862483 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{flag|Panama}}''':
:[[Panama City]]: After a former village near the modern capital, Panama City. From the Cueva Indian language meaning "place of abundance of fish" or "place of many fish", possibly from the Caribe "abundance of butterflies", or possibly from another native term referring to the Panama tree.
:[[Santa María la Antigua del Darién|Darien]] (1510–1521): A masculine given name related to the Persian name Darius, meaning "king".

'''{{flag|Papua New Guinea}}''':
:[[Port Moresby]]: It was first sighted by a European in 1873 by Captain John Moresby. It was named in honour of his father Admiral Sir Fairfax Moresby.

'''{{flag|Paraguay}}''':
:[[Asunción]]: "Assumption" in Spanish.
:[[Piribebuy]] (January 1, 1869 –August 12, 1869): In the Guarani language ''Piri vevui'' means chilliness or smooth breeze, and ''pirivevúi'', lightweight reed. Pirĩvevuĩ is a "soft feeling that is experienced within the area, the presence of fresh streams". However, the "light reed" etymology is more plausible, because the Paraguay River, at its mouth from the Piribebuy to a few miles north of Asunción, in a place called Arecutacuá, has formed a landscape dominated by this vegetation type, and in addition Guarani placenames were always based on the place's distinguishing natural characteristics.

'''{{flag|Peru}}''':
:[[Lima]]: According to early Spanish chronicles the Lima area was once called Ichma, after its original inhabitants. However, even before the Inca occupation of the area in the 15th century, a famous oracle in the Rímac valley had come to be known by visitors as Limaq (limaq, pronounced {{IPA-qu|ˈlimɑq|}}, which means "talker" in coastal Quechua). This oracle was eventually destroyed by the Spanish and replaced with a church, but the name persisted in the local language, thus the chronicles show "Límac" replacing "Ychma" as the common name for the area. Modern scholars speculate that the word "Lima" originated as the Spanish pronunciation of the native name ''Limaq''. Linguistic evidence seems to support this theory as spoken Spanish consistently rejects stop consonants in word-final position. The city was founded in 1535 under the name City of the Kings (Spanish: Ciudad de los Reyes) because its foundation was decided on January 6, date of the feast of the Epiphany. Nevertheless, this name quickly fell into disuse and Lima became the city's name of choice; on the oldest Spanish maps of Peru, both Lima and Ciudad de los Reyes can be seen together as names for the city.
:It is worth noting that the river that feeds Lima is called Rímac, and many people erroneously assume that this is because its original Inca name is "Talking River" (the Incas spoke a highland variety of Quechua where the word for "talker" was pronounced {{IPA|[ˈrimɑq]}}).{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} However, the original inhabitants of the valley were not the Incas, and this name is actually an innovation arising from an effort by the Cuzco nobility in colonial times to standardize the toponym so that it would conform to the phonology of Cuzco Quechua. Later, as the original inhabitants of the valley died out and the local Quechua became extinct, the Cuzco pronunciation prevailed. In modern times, Spanish-speaking locals do not see the connection between the name of their city and the name of the river that runs through it. They often assume that the valley is named after the river; however, Spanish documents from the colonial period show the opposite to be true.
:[[Jauja]] (April 1534 – January 1535): Derived from its native name Hatun Xauxa.
:[[Tacna]] (Capital of Peru–Bolivia 1836–1839): Derived from the Quechua words "taka" ("hit") and "na" ("something to do") so "Tacna" probably means "a place to hit".

'''{{flag|Philippines}}''':
:[[Manila]]: The city became known by the name given, "Manila", by its [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] inhabitants, as ''Maynila'', first recorded as ''Maynilad''. The name is based on the [[Scyphiphora hydrophyllacea|nila]], a flowering mangrove plant that grew on the marshy shores of the bay, used to produce soap for regional trade; it is either from the phrase ''may nila'', [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for "there is ''nila''", or it has a prefix ''ma-'' indicating the place where something is prevalent (''nila'' itself is probably from Sanskrit ''nila'' (नील) 'indigo tree').&lt;ref&gt;E.M. Pospelov, ''Geograficheskie nazvanie mira'' (Moscow 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the plant name is actually "nilad" is a myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://services.inquirer.net/print/print.php?article_id=20080625-144587 |title=Looking Back: Pre-Spanish Manila |author=Ambeth Ocampo |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=June 25, 2008 |accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:[[Quezon City]] (1948–1976): The city was named after Manuel L. Quezon, the former president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines who founded the city and developed it to replace Manila as the country's capital.
:Villa del Santissimo Nombre de Jesús/ [[Cebu City]] (1565–1571): Literally: "City of the Holy Name of Jesus" The name Cebu came from the coming of Miguel López de Legazpi to the Philippines. The first named Legazpi in Cebu is San Miguel but it changed again when he saw Sto. Niño (Holy Infant) given by Magellan to the Cebuano so he made it Santissimo La Ciudad del Nombre de Jesus (Blessed the City of the Holy Name of Jesus), and just shortened it and made Cebu.

'''{{flag|Poland}}''':
:[[Warsaw]]: "Belonging to Warsz"
:[[Lublin]] (de facto 1944–1945): In the early historical sources from 1228 the modern form of the name appears. It comes from a personal name formed from the name Lubla Lubomir, by adding a suffix formerly pieszczotliwego-la. It is also possible that the name Lubla in its traditional Polish diminutive form united with possessive suffix-in, giving the name of Lublin. Zygmunt Sułowski expressed belief that the name of Lublin combines the word Lubel (Lubelnia), in analogy to the related name Wróblin, sparrow. The founder and owner of Lublin in ancient times could thus be a man by the name of Lubel, or Lubla.
:[[Kraków]] (1038–1079, 1296–1596, and 1939–1944): "Belonging to Krakus."
:[[Poznań]] (964–1038 and 1290–1296): The name Poznań probably comes from a personal name Poznan (from the Polish participle poznan(y) – "one who is known/recognized") and would mean "Poznan's town". It is also possible that the name comes directly from the verb poznać, which means "to get to know" or "to recognize".
:The earliest surviving references to the city are found in the chronicles of Thietmar of Merseburg, written between 1012 and 1018: episcopus Posnaniensis ("bishop of Poznań", in an entry for 970) and ab urbe Posnani ("from the city of Poznań", for 1005). The city's name appears in documents in the Latin nominative case as Posnania in 1236 and Poznania in 1247. The phrase in Poznan appears in 1146 and 1244.
:The city's full official name is Stołeczne Miasto Poznań ("The Capital City of Poznań"), in reference to its role as a centre of political power in the early Polish state. Poznań is known as Posen in German, and was officially called Haupt- und Residenzstadt Posen ("Capital and Residence City of Poznań") between 20 August 1910 and 28 November 1918. The Latin names of the city are Posnania and Civitas Posnaniensis. Its Yiddish name is פּױזן, or Poyzn.
:The Russian version of the name, Познань (Poznan'), is of feminine gender, in contrast to the Polish name, which is masculine.
:[[Płock]] (1080–1138): Believed to have derived from the Polish word "płotu" meaning "fence".
:[[Gniezno]] (964–1038): Derived from "Gniazdo", the Polish word for "nest".

'''{{flag|Portugal}}''':
:[[Lisbon]]: There are many theories describing the etymology of Lisbon: 1.

In early Galician-Portuguese the name ‘’Lisboa’’ replaced the medieval version “Lissabona”.
:[[Coimbra]] (1139–1255): Derived from the Conimbriga. The name Conimbriga derives from an early, possibly pre-Indo-European element meaning "rocky height or outcrop" and the [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] briga, signifying a defended place. Others think that the element coni may be related to the Conii people.
:[[Guimarães]] (1095–1139): Named after Vímara Peres (Vimaranis, later Guimaranis).

'''{{flag|Romania}}''':
:[[Bucharest]]: Tradition connects the founding of Bucharest with the name of Bucur who was either a prince, an outlaw, a fisherman, a shepherd, or a hunter, according to different legends. In Romanian the word stem ''bucur'' means 'glad', 'joy', in Albanian, a language which may have historical connections with the Thracian languages, 'bukur' signifies 'beautiful' and 'esht' signifies 'is', literally translated as 'it is beautiful'.
:[[Iaşi]] (1859–1862 and December 1916 – December 1918): Scholars have different theories on the origin of the name "Iaşi". Some argue that the name originates with the [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribe [[Iazyges]] (of Iranian origin), one mentioned by [[Ovid]] as "''Ipse vides onerata ferox ut ducata '''Iasyx'''/ Per media Istri plaustra bubulcus aquas''" and "'''''Iazyges''' et Colchi Metereaque turba Getaque/ Danubii mediis vix prohibentur aquis''".

:Another explanation is that the name originated from the Iranian [[Alans|Alanic]] tribe of [[Jassic people|Jassi]]. The Hungarian name of the city (''Jászvásár'') literally means "Jassic Market"; the antiquated Romanian name, ''Târgul Ieşilor'' (and the once-favoured ''Iaşii''), may indicate the same meaning.

:Moscow: The city is named after the river (old {{lang|ru|гра́д Моско́в}}, literally "the city by the Moskva River").  The origin of the name is unknown, although several theories exist. One theory suggests that the source of the name is an ancient [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] language, in which it means "dark" and "turbid".

'''{{flag|Saudi Arabia}}''':
:[[Riyadh]]: The city's name is derived from the Arabic word رياض riyadh, which means "gardens", plural of "rawdha" روضة. particularly those formed in the desert after rains.
:[[Jiddah]]: There are at least two explanations for the etymology of the name Jeddah, according to Jeddah Ibn Helwaan Al-Qudaa'iy, the chief of the Quda'a clan. The more common account has it that the name is derived from جده ''Jaddah'', the Arabic word for "grandmother". According to eastern folk belief, the tomb of Eve (21°29′31″N 39°11′24″E), considered the grandmother of humanity, is located in Jeddah. The tomb was sealed with concrete by the religious authorities in 1975 as a result of some Muslims praying at the site.
:Ibn Battuta, the Berber traveller, visited Jeddah during his world trip. He wrote the name of the city into his diary as "Juddah".
:The British Foreign Office and other branches of the British government used to use the older spelling of "Jedda", contrary to other English-speaking usage, but in 2007 changed to the spelling "Jeddah".
:T. E. Lawrence felt that any transcription of Arabic names into English was arbitrary. In his book ''Revolt in the Desert'', Jeddah is spelled three different ways on the first page alone.
:On official Saudi maps and documents, the city name is transcribed "Jeddah", which is now the prevailing usage.

'''{{flag|Senegal}}''':
:[[Dakar]]: The name appeared as Dakar for the first time on a map in 1750 when French botanist Michel Adanson made a sketch of Cape Vert. Dakar could be a Frenchified version of ''ndakarou'', the local name, whose etymology remains uncertain, perhaps derived from the Wolof phrase ''deuk raw'', meaning "who settled there will be peace" or ''raw-Dekker'', an association of ''Dekker'' (country) and raw (escape). It could also be from the Wolof term ''dakhar'', which means "tamarind".
:The town is mentioned in some documents under the name of "Accard", a reference to a Frenchman of the late 17th century named Accar or Accard.

:[[Ljubljana]]: The origin of the city's name is unclear. In the Middle Ages, both the river and the town were also known by the German name ''Laibach'', which was in official use until 1918.

'''{{flag|Spain}}''':
:[[Madrid]] (1561–1600): There are several theories regarding the origin of the name "Madrid". According to legend Madrid was founded by Ocno Bianor (son of King Tyrrhenius of Tuscany and Mantua) and was named "Metragirta" or "Mantua Carpetana". Others contend that the original name of the city was "Ursaria" ("land of bears" in Latin), due to the high number of these animals that were found in the adjacent forests, which, together with the strawberry tree ("madroño" in Spanish), have been the emblem of the city from the Middle Ages. The ancient name of the city ''Magerit'' comes from the name of a fortress built on the Manzanares River in 9AD, and means "Place of abundant water".
:Nevertheless, it is now commonly believed that the origin of the current name of the city comes from the 2nd century BC. The Roman Empire established a settlement on the banks of the Manzanares river. The name of this first village was "Matrice" (a reference to the river that crossed the settlement). Following the invasions of the Germanic Sueves, Vandals and Alans during the 5th century AD, the Roman Empire could not defend its territories on the Iberian Peninsula, and were therefore overrun by the Visigoths. The barbarian tribes subsequently took control of "Matrice". In the 7th century the Islamic conquest of the Iberian Peninsula saw the name changed to "Mayrit", from the Arabic term ميرا "Mayra" (referencing water as a "trees" or "giver of life") and the Ibero-Roman suffix "it" that means "place". The modern "Madrid" evolved from the Mozarabic ''Matrit'', which is still in the Madrilenian gentilic. Around this palace a small citadel, al-Mudaina, was built. Near that palace was the Manzanares, which the Muslims called al-Majrīṭ (Arabic: المجريط, "source of water"). From this came the naming of the site as ''Majerit'', which later evolved into the modern-day spelling of Madrid.
:[[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] (1479 – May 1561): It was first written as Toletum in the work of Roman historian Livy, where Tollitum/Toletum would originate, which would become Tollitu, Tollito, Tollet, Tolledo and finally Toledo. Its meaning would be "up, up." Martin Gallego contains the version of "double turns or bend of the river that encircles". The writer of the twelfth century, Ab-Din Abu al – Ayyubid, says طليطلة Tulaytulah means "happy", without giving an explanation.
:[[Valladolid]] (1600–1604): One suggestion for the origin of Valladolid's name comes from its apparent similarity with "BaladulWalid" (in Arabic بلد الوليد) meaning The City of Walid in memory of one of the Ummayad dynasty's greatest caliphs in Damascus; but no good reason has been given as to why the Moors should have given such a grand title to what was then a remote village on the much contested frontier of their empire. A more likely suggestion is a conjunction of the Latin ''vallis'', "Valley", and Celtic ''tolitum'', "place of confluence of waters". Ruins of a Roman settlement have been found in the area and the area was occupied by Celtic tribes when it was conquered by the Romans. Another suggestion is ''valla'' ("fence" in Spanish) "de" (of) Olid (Spanish family name).
:It is also popularly called Pucela, a nickname whose origin is not clear, but probably refers to a few knights who accompanied Joan of Arc. Another theory tells that it was called Pucela because [[Pozzolana]] cement was sold there, the only city in Spain that did.
:[[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] (November 1936 – October 1937): The original Latin name of the city was Valentia ({{IPA-la|waˈlɛntɪa|classical}}), meaning "strength", "valour", the city being named for the Roman practice of recognizing the valour of former Roman soldiers after a war. The Roman historian Titus Livius (Livy) explains that the founding of Valentia in the 2nd century BC was due to the settling of the Roman soldiers who fought against local Iberian rebel Viriatus.
:During the rule of the Muslim Empires in Spain, it was known as بلنسية (Balansiya) in Arabic. By regular sound changes, this has become Valencia {{IPA-es|baˈlenθja|}} in Spanish and València {{IPA-ca|vaˈlensia|}} in Valencian.
:[[Barcelona]] (October 1937–1939): The name ''Barcelona'' comes from the ancient [[Iberian language|Iberian]] ''Barkeno'', attested in an ancient coin inscription in [[Iberian scripts|Iberian script]] as [[File:Barkeno.png|34px|Barkeno in Levantine Iberian script]],&lt;ref&gt;''Emerita: Revista de Lingüística y Filología clasica'' 11 (1943), p.468&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Greek language|Greek]] sources as ''Varkinòn'', {{lang|grc|Βαρκινών}};&lt;ref&gt;[[Ptolemy]], ii. 6. §&amp;nbsp;8&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Latin]] as ''Barcino'', ''Barcelo''&lt;ref&gt;[[Avienus]] ''Or. Mar.'',&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Barceno''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Antonine Itinerary|Itin. Ant.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

:During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as ''Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelona'', and ''Barchenona''. Some sources say that the city could have been named after the Carthaginian general [[Hamilcar Barca]], who supposedly founded the city in 3 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term%3DBarcelona |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409161819/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Barcelona |archivedate=2014-04-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Burgos]] (July 1936 – October 1939): There are several versions of its etymology. Most derive it from Low Latin ''Burgus'', Greek Πύργος pyrgos, which mean "tower" and would refer to the two towers built on the hill del Castillo. Others believe it comes from the German ''Berg'', mountain. Vegetius states
that Bergus, Burgus, means small castle. Guadix adds that the Arabic بورجوا burgo, "thatched house, borough" means that the name could have been taken from the Goths.&lt;ref name="DiccionarioEtimológico"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=j6IFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA216&amp;lpg=PA216&amp;dq=Burgos+etimolog%C3%ADa+%22burgus%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=a6Emsq3r7z&amp;sig=AkcDVEda0Iu4eGTZidT7jN9N0rE&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result Diccionario etimológico de la Lengue Castellana]&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Colombo]]: The name "Colombo", first introduced by the Portuguese in 1505, is believed to be derived from the classical Sinhalese name ඛොලන් ථොට Kolon thota, meaning "port on the river Kelani". It has also been suggested that the name may be derived from the Sinhalese name ඛොල-අම්බ-තොට Kola-amba-thota which means "Harbour with leafy mango trees". However, it is also possible that the Portuguese named the city after Christopher Columbus,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} the sailor who lived in Portugal for many years before discovering the Americas on behalf of the Spanish monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. His Portuguese name is Cristóvão Colombo. Colombo set sail to look for India westwards around the same time Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama set sail eastwards, landing at the Port of Calicut in India on 20 May 1498. Colombo discovered the Americas six years before that on 12 October 1492 and was already a famed sailor and explorer, celebrated both in Portugal and Spain by the time Dom Lourenço de Almeida accidentally landed in the port of Galle in 1505.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colonialvoyage.com/ceylonP.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427125617/http://www.colonialvoyage.com/ceylonP.html |archivedate=2009-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though during those times, it referred to the area outside the inner moat called Pitakotte (outer fort) and the area inside, Ethul Kotte (inner fort).
:The word Kotte is derived from the Tamil word கொட்டெஇ Kottei (fortress). Jayawardhanapura (ජයවර්ධනපුර) meaning "victory enhancing city" in Sinhala, was the name assigned to the place by its founder Alagakkonara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defonseka.com/hist_kotte01.htm|title=Kotte, the capital of Sri Lanka 1400–1565 A.

Grant, who reached Khartoum in 1863 with Captain Speke's expedition, thought that the derivation was most probably from the [[safflower]] (''Carthamus tinctorius'' L.) which is called 'Gartoon,' and which was cultivated extensively in Egypt for its oil, used in burning.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
:[[Omdurman]] (1881–1898): Omdurman was originally known as Wen-Dhurman in the Dinka language. The phrase 'Wen-Dhurman' means "Son Mourning his Mother." This is so because history has it that a mother of Deng Abuk, the legendary ancestry of the Dinka tribe, drowned when they were crossing the River Nile while migrating southwards. But her eldest son could not accept this tragedy, and thus remained on the river crying for days, until passers-by found him. When asked why he was crying, he responded that he was mourning his mum; and hence this became the name of that place.

'''{{flag|Tanzania}}''':
:[[Dar es Salaam]] (1891–present): From Arabic دار السلام, meaning "House of Peace."
:[[Bagamoyo]] (1885–1891): In the late 18th century, Muslim families settled in Bagamoyo, all of which were relatives of Shamvi la Magimba in Oman. They made their living by enforcing taxes on the native population and by trading in salt, gathered from the Nunge coast north of Bagamoyo. In the first half of the 19th century, Bagamoyo became a trading port for ivory and the slave trade, with traders coming from the African interior, from places as far as Morogoro, Lake Tanganyika and Usambara on their way to Zanzibar. This explains the meaning of the word Bagamoyo ("Bwaga-Moyo") which means "Lay down your Heart" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. It is disputed whether this refers to the slave trade which passed through the town (i.e. "give up all hope") or to the porters who rested in Bagamoyo after carrying 35lb cargos on their shoulders from the Great Lakes region (i.e. "take the load off and rest"). Since there is little evidence to support that Bagamoyo was a major slave port (Kilwa, much further south, has earned this status), and that tens of thousands of porters arrived at Bagamoyo annually in the latter half of the 19th century, it is more likely that the name of the town derives from the latter interpretation.

'''{{flag|Thailand}}''':

'''{{flag|Turkey}}''':
:[[Ankara]] (1920–present): Derived from Ἄγκυρα (Ánkyra, meaning Anchor) in Greek.
:[[Istanbul|Constantinople]] (1453–1920): Named after the Roman Emperor Constantine I. The modern name Istanbul is derived from the Greek phrase  "εἰς τὴν Πόλιν" {{IPA-el|is tin ˈpolin|}} or in the Aegean dialect "εἰς τὰν Πόλιν" {{IPA-el|is tan ˈpolin|}} (modern Greek "στην Πόλη" {{IPA-el|stin ˈpoli|}}), which means "in the city", "to the city" or "downtown". To this day, Greeks often refer to Istanbul as 'tin Poli' (the City).{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} A version found in Western languages, Stamboul, was used in lieu of Istanbul until the creation of the modern Turkish language by Atatürk after 1932. Before that time, English-speaking sources used Stamboul to describe the central parts on the historic peninsula between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara.
:[[Edirne|Adrianople]] (1365–1453): The city was founded as Hadrianopolis (Ἁδριανούπολις), named for the Roman Emperor Hadrian. This name is still used in the Modern Greek (Αδριανούπολη). The name Adrianople was used in English, until the Turkish adoption of the Latin alphabet in 1928 made Edirne the internationally recognized name. The Turkish Edirne, the Bulgarian Одрин (Odrin), and the Serbian Једрене (Jedrene) are adapted forms of the name Hadrianopolis.
:[[Bursa]] (1335–1365): Derived from the Latin word "bursa", meaning "purse."

'''{{flag|Turkmenistan}}''':
:[[Ashgabat]] (1918–1919; 1927–present): Ashgabat is ''Aşgabat'' in [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], Ашхабад (''Ashkhabad'') in [[Russian language|Russian]], and عشق‌آباد ([[UniPers]]: ''Ešq-âbâd'') in [[Persian language|Persian]]. From 1919 until 1927, the city was renamed Poltoratsk after a local revolutionary. Before 1991, the city was usually spelled Ashkhabad in English, a transliteration of the Russian form, which was itself from the original Persian form. It has also been variously spelled Ashkhabat and Ashgabad.
:Ashgabat derives from a folk etymology suggesting that the name is a dialect version of the Persian word of عشق (''eshq'' meaning "love") and [[Persian language|Persian]] آباد (''ābād'' meaning "inhabited place" or "city", etymologically "abode"), and hence loosely translates as "the city of love" or "the city that love built".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/rnb/bashiri/Turkmenistan/Ashgabat.html Folk etymology of the name ''Ashgabat''], Iraj Bashiri, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Philadelphia]] (1774–1776, 1778–1783, and 1790–1800): From Greek Φιλαδέλφεια, meaning "Brotherly Love" in Greek. Compound of φίλος (philos, love), and ἀδελφός (adelphos, brother).
:New York City (1785–1790): Named after the city of York, UK.
:[[York]] (1777–1778): city in N. England, O.E. ''Eoforwic'', earlier Carsonein (c.150), an ancient Celtic name, probably meaning "Yew-Tree Estate", but Eburos may also be a personal name. The word 'York' comes from the Latin name for the city, variously rendered as ''Eboracum'', ''Eburacum'' or ''Eburaci''. The first mention of York by this name is dated to c. 95–104 AD as an address on a wooden stylus tablet from the Roman fortress of Vindolanda in Northumberland. The toponymy of ''Eboracum'' is uncertain because the language of the pre-Roman indigenous population of the area was never recorded. These people are thought to have spoken a Celtic language, related to modern Welsh. Therefore, it is thought that ''Eboracum'' is derived from the Brythonic word ''Eborakon'', meaning either "place of the yew trees" (cf. ''efrog'' in Welsh, ''eabhrac'' in Irish Gaelic and ''eabhraig'' in Scottish Gaelic, by which names the city is known in those languages) or perhaps "field of Eboras".
:The name ''Eboracum'' was turned into ''Eoforwic'' by the Anglians in the 7th century. This was probably by conflation of ''ebor'' with a Germanic root *eburaz (boar); by the 7th century the Old English for boar had become ''eofor'', and Eboracum ''Eoforwic''. The ''wic'' simply signified 'place'. When the Danish army conquered the city in 866, the name became rendered as ''Jórvík''. This was gradually reduced to York in the centuries following the Norman Conquest, moving from the Middle English ''Yerk'' through to ''Yourke'' in the 16th century and then ''Yarke'' in the 17th century. The form ''York'' was first recorded in the 13th century.

'''{{flag|Uruguay}}''':
:[[Montevideo]]: It is not in dispute that ''Monte'' comes from the hill which faces the bay, the ''Cerro de Montevideo'', but there are at least two explanations of the origin of the name Montevideo: The first says that the name comes from the words in Portuguese "Monte vide eu", meaning 'I saw a mountain', a phrase uttered by a seaman on the expedition of Ferdinand Magellan when he saw the hill of Montevideo; this comes from the boatswain, Francisco Albo, referring in his journal to "a mountain like a hat which we named Montevidi", but the origin in the seaman's exclamation is not mentioned there and would require a strange mixing of dialects. The second says that the Spanish recorded the location on a map as the sixth hill going from east to west (''Monte VI De Este o Oeste''). There is no conclusive evidence for this.

:A third, less popular theory is that it derives from a religious name, ''Ovid Monte'' (''Monte Santo Ovidio''). Ovidio or Ovid was the third bishop of the Portuguese city of Braga and was revered; a monument was erected to him in 1505. Albo's account mentions a corruption of the name into ''Santo Vidio''. There is no evidence for this etymology, but it is attractive enough that it has appeared on some maps of the region.

'''{{flag|Uzbekistan}}''':
:[[Tashkent]]: Derived from Uzbek ''Toshkent'', meaning "Stone City". ''Tash'' means "stone" in Turkic languages and is probably derived (via Persian چاچ and Arabic شاش) from the Chinese word 石, pinyin shí, meaning "stone". ''Kent'' means "city" in Turkic languages.

:[[Lealui]] (1899–1911): Luyi is derived from Siluyana root-word uyi meaning bad or cruel. The claim by some scholars that in the Nkoya language ''luyi'' means foreigner, might be an indication of the phenomenon of borrowed words assuming new meanings, while claims that it is the Nkoya or Kwengo who so named the Aluyi are misleading.&lt;ref&gt;http://lowdownzambia.com/2006/2006-07/lealui.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{flag|Zimbabwe}}'''
:[[Harare]]: Derived from either the Shona chieftain Neharawa or from the European corruption of "Haarari" ("He does not sleep"). Known as Salisbury from 1897 to 1981 and Fort Salisbury from September 12, 1890 to 1897.
:[[Matabeleland]]&amp;ndash;[[Bulawayo]] (1881–1890): Matabeleland means "Land of the Ndebele People." Ndebele literally means "Refugees", thus Matabeleland literally means "Land of the Refugees". The name ''Bulawayo'' comes from the Sindebele word ''KwaBulawayo'', meaning "a place where he is being killed". It is thought that at the time of the formation of the city, there was a civil war and a group of Ndebeles not aligned with Prince Lobengula were fighting him as they felt he was not the heir to the throne, hence he gave his capital the name 'where he (the prince) is being killed'. Some historians differ on this matter, describing Bulawayo as 'at the place of He who Kills' or 'place of slaughter'.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
:The name Bulawayo is imported from Nguniland, which is a place once occupied by the Khumalo people. The place still exists and is next to Richards Bay.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

{{Wikisourcepar|Notre Charge Apostolique}}
'''''Notre charge apostolique''''' (our Apostolic Mandate) was a papal [[encyclical]] promulgated by [[Pope Pius X]] on August 15, 1910. 

== Text ==
First Sentence : '''''Notre charge apostolique''' nous fait un devoir de veiller à la pureté de la foi et à l’intégrité de la discipline catholique, de préserver les fidèles des dangers de l’erreur et du mal, surtout quand l’erreur et le mal leur sont présentés dans un langage entraînant qui, voilant le vague des idées et l’équivoque des expressions sous l’ardeur du sentiment et la sonorité des mots, peut enflammer les cœurs pour des causes séduisantes mais funestes.''

== Context ==
The Pope took issue with what he viewed as the socialist leanings of the Catholic '[[Le Sillon]]' movement of [[Marc Sangnier]]. 
He said that Sillonists wanted to completely level social differences and to create a "One World Church" by joining "unbelievers". The Pope emphasized that a Catholic view of social justice meant considering the needs of both the powerful and poor. The Sillonists, he said, did not accept that authority comes from God down to the authorized leaders and from there to the people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">The '''Official Secrets Act 1951''' (long title: "An Act to make better provision in respect of official secrets") was a [[statute]] of the [[New Zealand Parliament]]. It was based on the UK [[Official Secrets Act 1911]],&lt;ref name=Danks1&gt;{{cite report |author= |date=December 1980 |title=Towards Open Government: General Report |url=http://www.ombudsman.parliament.nz/ckeditor_assets/attachments/447/danks_general_report.pdf?1482180886 |publisher=Office of the Ombudsman |page=5 |access-date=16 October 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and provided for criminal penalties for espionage and unauthorised releases of government information. 

The only prosecution under the espionage provisions of the Act was that of [[Bill Sutch]], who was unsuccessfully prosecuted in 1974-5 following a series of clandestine meetings with KGB agent Dimitri Rasgovorov, an official of the Soviet Union's embassy in Wellington.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_478632"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/features/feature-archive/478632/Was-Bill-Sutch-a-spy |title=Was Bill Sutch a spy? |date=7 June 2008 |work=[[The Sunday Star-Times]] |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/1832665/423466.xhtml |title=SIS reopens Sutch spy debate |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the trial the [[New Zealand Security Intelligence Service|Security Intelligence Service]] was unable to provide details of what information had supposedly been passed, and Sutch was subsequently acquitted by the jury.

The Act was repealed in 1983 by the [[Official Information Act 1982]].&lt;ref&gt;Official Information Act 1982, section 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OAPEC Members.png|right|thumb|Map of OAPEC Members and their status in 2010, prior to the [[South Sudanese independence referendum, 2011|breakup of Sudan]]]]
{{citation needed span|On 9 January 1968, three of the then–most conservative Arab oil states &amp;mdash; Kuwait, Libya, and Saudi Arabia &amp;mdash; agreed at a conference in Beirut, Lebanon to found the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries, aiming to separate the production and sale of oil from politics in the wake of the halfhearted [[1967 oil embargo]] in response to the [[Six-Day War]]. Such use of the economic weapon of oil embargo in the struggle against Israel had been regularly proposed at Arab Petroleum Congresses, but it took the Six-Day War for the embargo to happen. However Saudi Arabia's oil production was up by 9% that year, and the main embargo lasted only ten days and was completely ended by the [[Khartoum Resolution|Khartoum Conference]].|date=May 2018}}

OAPEC was originally intended to be a conservative Arab political organization which, by restricting membership to countries whose main export was oil, would exclude governments seen as radical &amp;mdash; such as those of Egypt and Algeria. This organizational exclusivity was bolstered by an additional rule in the organization's charter requiring the three founders' approval of all new members. The original aim was to control the economic weapon of potential oil embargo and prevent its use caused by popular emotion. Iraq initially declined to join, preferring to work under the umbrella of the [[Arab League]], considering OAPEC too conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2015-11-28|title=Foreign Relations of the United States 1964–1968, Volume XXXIV Energy, Diplomacy, and Global Issues, Document 260|publisher=US State Dept|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1964-68v34/d260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally the three founders considered Iraq too radical to be desirable as a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=J.B. |last=Kelly |title=Arabia, the Gulf and the West |page=239 |publisher=Basic Books |year=1980 |isbn=0-465-00416-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by early 1972, the criterion for admission had changed to oil being a significant source of revenue (rather than the principal source) of a prospective member nation; and Algeria, Iraq, Syria and Egypt had been admitted. Consequently, OAPEC became a much more activist organization, contrary to the original intention.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

{{citation needed span|The [[1973 oil crisis]] was a turning point for the organization. In October of that year, the forces of Egypt and Syria attempted to overwhelm the state of Israel in an offensive later known as the [[Yom Kippur War]]. On 16 October, ten days after the war's start, Kuwait hosted separate meetings of both OAPEC and the [[Persian Gulf]] members of [[OPEC]], including Iran. OAPEC resolved to cut oil production by 5% monthly "until the Israeli forces are completely evacuated from all the Arab territories occupied in the June 1967 war". The embargo would last for some five months before it was lifted in March 1974 after negotiations at the Washington Oil Summit. The embargo's aftereffects would linger through the rest of the decade and beyond. For the oil-exporting countries, the embargo was the first experience of leveraging their collective production for political gains. A number of the member nations would use this sense of control to renegotiate the contracts they had made with the companies that had discovered and exploited their resources. The vastly increased revenues would prove addictive, and a unified OAPEC oil embargo was never again possible.|date=May 2018}}

In 1979, Egypt was expelled from OAPEC for signing the [[Camp David Accords]], although it was readmitted a decade later.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} 

In 1982, the Arab League's '''Arab Petroleum Congress''' (founded in 1959) merged into OAPEC's '''Arab Energy Conference''' (founded in 1979),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUa0AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA363 |title=Crisis &amp; Response |first=Mohamed Noordin |last=Sopiee |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |isbn=978-1136151309 |page=363}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has continued to meet periodically through at least 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oapecorg.org/Home/Activities/Seminars-and-Conferences/Arab-Energy-Conferences |title=The Tenth Arab Energy Conference |publisher=OAPEC |accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OAPEC is regarded as a regional, specialized [[international organization]] focusing on organizing cooperation in oil development, collective projects, and regional integration.

== Organizational structure ==
{{citation needed span|OAPEC consists of the Council of Ministers that holds the supreme authority over the Executive Bureau, the General Secretariat, and the Judicial Tribunal. The Council of Ministers is formed by each member state's minister of petroleum and they work together to construct general policy and ensure the organization's goals and actions are being achieved and implemented. The Executive Bureau assists the Council of Ministers by meet at least three times a year to review the budget, approve staff regulations, and develops an agenda for the Council of Ministers depending on their analyses of the organizations activities. One senior official from each member state serves on the Executive Bureau. The General Secretariat consists of the Secretary General's Office, as well as four departments: Finance and Administrative Affairs; Information and Library; Economics; and Technical Affairs. The Economics Department and the Technical Affairs Department form the Arab Center for Energy Studies that was established in 1983.|date=May 2018}} The Judicial Tribunal mitigates disputes between member states; interpretations of the OAPEC Agreement; disputes with a petroleum company operating in its member states' territory, and anything else that falls into OAPEC's jurisdiction or that the Council of Ministers submits to the tribunal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Regional Surveys of the World: The Middle East and North Africa|publisher=Europa Publications|year=2003|isbn=1-85743-132-4|page=1313}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Judicial Tribunal must unevenly consist of at least seven and no more than eleven judges from Arab countries.

{{Military of the Ottoman Empire sidebar}}
'''Ottoman military reforms''' began in the late 18th century.

== Reforms of Selim III ==
[[File:General Aubert Dubayet with French officers being received by the Grand Vizier in 1796.jpg|thumb|right|''General [[Aubert-Dubayet]] with his Military Mission being received by the Grand Vizier in 1796'', painting by [[Antoine-Laurent Castellan]].]]
[[File:Fortification built the Baron de Tott for the Ottoman Empire.jpg|thumb|right|A fortification built by the Baron de Tott for the [[Ottoman Empire]] during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]].]]
When [[Selim III]] came to the throne in 1789, an ambitious effort of military reform was launched, geared towards securing the Ottoman Empire.  The sultan and those who surrounded him were conservative and desired to preserve the status quo. No one in power in the Empire had any interest in social transformation.

=== Introduction of advisors ===
{{see|Franco-Ottoman alliance}}
Western military advisors were imported as advisors but their abilities to enact change were limited.  A parade of [[France|French]] officers were brought in, and none of them could do a great deal.  One example of an advisor who achieved limited success was the [[François Baron de Tott]], a French officer.  He did succeed in having a new foundry built to make artillery.  As well he directed the construction of a new naval base.  Unfortunately it was almost impossible for him to divert soldiers from the regular army into the new units.  The new ships and guns that made it into service were too few to have much of an influence on the Ottoman army and de Tott returned home.

When they had requested French help, a young artillery officer by the name of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was to be sent to [[Constantinople]] in 1795 to help organize Ottoman artillery. He did not go, for just days before he was to embark for the Near East he proved himself useful to the Directory by putting down a Parisian mob in the ''[[whiff of grapeshot]]'' and was kept in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q8pwY3oyi_sC&amp;pg=PA29 ''Memoirs of Napoleon Bonaparte'' p.29]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EKHSAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA4 ''History of Napoleon, Emperor of the French, King of Italy, etc.'' by John Jacob Lehmanowsky p.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New Army System ===
{{unreferenced-section|date=October 2016}}
The most important change was the creation of an elite new [[infantry]] unit; the ''[[Nizam-i Djedid]]'' was set up with western uniforms, weapons, and training.  This group would offend the [[Janissary|Janissaries]]. Once elite forces, the Janissaries had become a conservative elite using their military power to advance themselves commercially and politically. In 1806 the Janissaries, with support of the ''[[ulema]]'' and the provincial governors, revolted against the Sultan and his new force and replaced him with [[Mustafa IV]].

== Reforms of Mahmud II ==
{{unreferenced-section|date=September 2016}}
In 1808 Selim III was replaced by [[Mahmud II]] with martial law of [[Alemdar Mustafa Pasha]] who restarted the reform efforts.  His first task was to ally with the Janissaries in order to break the power of the provincial governors.  He then turned on the Janissaries, massacring them in their barracks in Istanbul and the provincial capitals in 1826, which is known as the [[Auspicious Incident]]. The Sultan now set himself to replace the Janissaries by other regular troops. The [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1828–1829 did not give him time to organize a new army, and the Sultan was forced to fight with these young and undisciplined recruits against the veterans of the Tsar. The war was brought to a close by the disastrous [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]]. While the reforms in question were mainly implemented to improve the military, the most notable development that arose out of these efforts was a series of schools teaching everything from math to medicine to train new officers.

== Reforms of Abdulmejid I==
[[File:Georg Kmety Litho.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[György Kmety|Ismail Pasha]] in a French-inspired military uniform.]]
{{unreferenced-section|date=September 2016}}
Sultan [[Abdulmejid I]] enjoyed several years of peace, which enabled him to form a powerful and well disciplined army that was established at the beginning of the year 1842.

The chain-of-command in the general staff of each army was composed of a commander-in-chief, two lieutenant-generals, three brigadiers of infantry, one of whom commands the reserve, two brigadiers of cavalry, and one brigadier of artillery. In each corps there were three regiments of infantry, two of cavalry, and one of artillery, with thirty-three guns. The total strength of these twelve regiments of active forces was 30,000 men, but it was diminished in time of peace by furlough to an effective strength of about 25,000 men in three of the six armies, as well as 15,000 troops in the other three, a consequence of the recruiting system being as yet incomplete in its application all over the Ottoman Empire. The whole establishment of this branch amounts, therefore, to 180,000 men, belonging to the active service, but its effective strength is at present 123,000.

The reserve of four of the six armies consisted of eleven regiments, six of which were infantry, four of cavalry, and one of artillery.  The total combined force equalled 12,000 troops, while the other two armies have not met their reserve of soldiers who have served five years. In time of war, however, the reserve would form two corps of 25,000 men in each army; giving a total of 300,000. The two services, therefore, as they stood, formed an effective force of 135,000 men; and when their full strength shall have been filled up it will amount to 480,000.

Besides these six armies there were four detached corps.  These corps raise the effective strength of the standing army to 365,000 men.

Deployment at the time consisted of the following:

*the Island of Crete was assigned three regiments of infantry and one of cavalry, in all 11,000 men;
*the Pashalik of Tripoli in Africa was assigned one regiment of infantry and one of cavalry, about 5,000 strong;
*the Pashalik of Tunis was assigned one regiment of infantry and one of cavalry, about 5,000 strong.

Aside from deployed troops, the Ottoman military also had the following units:

**the central artillery corps,
**a standing brigade of sappers and miners with engineer officers,
**the veteran artillery brigade,
**permanent artillery garrisons of the fortresses on
***The [[Hellespont]],
***The [[Bosphorus]],
***The [[Danube]], in Serbia, on the Adriatic,
***The coast of [[Asia Minor]], in the islands of the Archipelago,
***the southern shores of the [[Black Sea]], constituting a combined force of approximately 9,000 troops.

Besides augmentation of 32,000 men by the submission of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and Northern [[Albania]] to the new system; and a further increase of 40,000 men, which Serbia had arranged to furnish, 18,000 men served in [[Egypt]], which would act to reinforce the reserve of the fifth army.

The marines, sailors, and workmen, enrolled in brigades that amounted to 34,000 total men.  The grand total of armed men at the disposal of Ottoman Empire at the time could be calculated at no less than 664,000 men.  In addition, the Ottomans could call-up occasional [[Conscription|levies]], which were more easily and efficiently utilized in the Ottoman Empire than in any other country at the time. After years of peace and stability the modernized army was put to test in the [[Crimean War]].

== Reforms of Abdul Hamid II==
{{unreferenced-section|date=September 2016}}
[[Abdul Hamid II]] attached utmost importance to the reorganization of the military. As early as 1880 he sought, and two years later secured, German assistance, which culminated in the appointment of Lt. Col. Kohlcr and, finally, Colmar Von der Goltz as military advisors.

The curriculum of Harbiye (War College) was specialized further to train staff officers in the European style. The school’s name was changed to Mekteb-i Fununu Harb (School of War Science). It was during his reign that the officers’ training was upgraded and regularized, starting with the mid-level military rt2diye and idadi schools and culminating in the Mekteb-i Harbiye (War College) or, for the most Capable, in the Erkan-i Harbiye (Chiefs of Staff). The last, as a concept and an organization, was largely the work of von der Goltz.

However, although the consensus that Abdulhamid favoured the modernization of the Ottoman army and the professionalization of the officer was fairly general, it seems that he neglected the military during the last fifteen years of his reign, and he also cut down the military budget. The problem with the army (numbering Ca. 700,000 at the end of the century), besides the officers’ constant opposition to field exercises, was the growing number of underpaid officers, and the lack of a proper retirement system. The annual army expenditures were some 7,756,000 liras out of a total national budget of 18,927,000 liras for 1897; when the Debt Administration claimed 6,483.000 liras, little was left for investment in economic development.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19035">'''Output-based aid''' ('''OBA''') refers to [[development aid]] strategies that link the delivery of [[public services]] in [[developing countries]] to targeted performance-related [[subsidy|subsidies]]. OBA subsidies are offered in transport construction, education, water and [[sanitation]] systems, and healthcare among other sectors where positive [[externalities]] exceed cost recovery exclusively from private markets.

== How it works ==
OBA targets individuals who lack the financial means to pay for basic services. It is specifically targeted for individuals in developing countries. The service provider will receive subsidies to replace costs associated with providing the service to people, such as user fees. Individual agents will verify that the service is being delivered and based on the performance of the service-provider, a subsidy will be granted. That is how it is "performance-based".&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, P.J., and Smith, S.M. (2001) Contracting for public services: Output-based aid and its applications. World Bank. Available from &lt;http://rru.worldbank.org/Features/OBABook.aspx&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid. (2009) "OUTPUT-BASED AID – FACT SHEET" Available from &lt; http://www.gpoba.org/gpoba/sites/gpoba.org/files/GPOBA_fact_sheet_english_0.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

OBA generally works through a private firm, or another third party, acting as the service provider. The service provider is responsible for the initial financing of the project and, only after results have been verified, will the firm receive subsidies from a donor. In such schemes, it is the provider who bears the risk of loss, rather than the aid donor, and output-based schemes allow for the tracking of results because of the way they function. Integration of the private sector into aid schemes is common with OBA, since they often provide the initial financing. The [[World Bank]] sees OBA as a way to improve aid effectiveness. This differs from traditional aid schemes that will usually focus on the inputs to service providers rather than the outputs. The donor is usually the World Bank, a government or an international organization or philanthropist that is part of the OBA scheme. Subsidies from a donor will generally serve to complement or reduce user fees. The subsidy is paid only after the particular service has been delivered to a community. The subsidies are targeted to poorer individuals, since OBA initiatives are carried out in regions with significant amounts of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, P.J., and Smith, S.M. (2001) Contracting for public services: Output-based aid and its applications. World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid. (2009) "OUTPUT-BASED AID – FACT SHEET"&lt;/ref&gt;

In healthcare, vouchers are granted to patients who require medical attention and cannot afford or access it. These vouchers can be taken to hospitals or clinics, whether private or public, and they will be provided with the medical attention they require. The clinic or healthcare professional that provided the medical service will be subsidized for the delivery of the service by a donor.&lt;ref&gt;KFW Entwicklungsbank "Output-Based Aid." Available from http://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/EN_Home/Topics/Health/Output-Based_Aid.jsp.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of projects ==

In healthcare, OBA is often implemented by contracting providers in either the public or private sector, sometimes both, and issuing vouchers to people considered at higher risk of disease or in greater need of the health services. Two of the earliest examples of competitive vouchers and fee-for-service contracts in healthcare were implemented in South Korea and Taiwan in the 1960s. In [[Nicaragua]], the [http://www.icas.net/new-icasweb/index.html Instituto CentroAmericano de la Salud (Central American Health Institute)] began voucher programs for reproductive and sexual health services in 1995. New programs for facility-based maternal deliveries in Kenya and Uganda began in 2006 and 2009 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Sandiford P, Gorter A, Rojas Z, Salvetto M. 2005. A Guide to Competitive Vouchers in Health.

"Sexual and Reproductive Health Program."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Output-Based Healthcare. (2007). "trials and successes of contracted patient care in uganda." Available from &lt;www.oba-uganda.net&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(2009). "Creating an efficient and quality healthcare system." IGES 2009. Available from &lt;http://www.output-based-aid.net/e94/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mongolia]] projects to improve rural [[Telecommunications in Mongolia|telecommunications]] have been undertaken. Existing communication operators bid for subsidy contracts to expand their networks and services to rural areas with poor access to telecommunications. The bidding operators were also aware of the risk associated with the subsidies, since they would only receive funding if certain outcomes had been met. These OBA schemes are meant to provide [[Broadband universal service|universal]] [[Internet access]] to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;ICT Regulation Toolkit. (2009). "Output-Based Aid (OBA) explained." Available from http://www.ictregulationtoolkit.org/en/PracticeNote.3159.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

OBAs have had successes and failures based on the specific project. Many challenges have come to exist as a result of the diverse projects that have been carried out.

== History ==

The first instance of voucher-based OBA was in [[South Korea]] and [[Taiwan]] in the 1960s. According to [[Malcolm Potts]], these [[family planning|family-planning]] initiatives were very successful. There were few such instances where OBA was used for development purposes up until the new millennium. Voucher-based healthcare schemes were piloted in Latin America, Asia and Africa in the 1990s and early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;KFW Entwicklungsbank, "Interview with Prof. Dr. Malcolm Potts with respect to Output-Based-Aid (OBA) voucher schemes as a means of promoting public health in developing countries." Available from &lt; http://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/EN_Home/Topics/Health/Interview_mit_Prof_Potts_Berkeley.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the World Bank launched its Private Sector Development Strategy (PSD), of which OBA was a key component.&lt;ref&gt;Citizens Network on Essential Services, "Tools For Advocacy: Basic Services Report On Board-Approved Private Sector Development (PSD) Strategy." Available From &lt; http://google.com/search?q=cache:SlQuyJnW8hEJ:www.energyandenvironment.undp.org/undp/indexAction.cfm%3Fmodule%3DLibrary%26action%3DGetFile%26DocumentAttachmentID%3D53+Output-based+aid+(OBA)+problems&amp;cd=9&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=ca&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank has been the most active participant in OBA and in 2003, along with the UK's [[Department for International Development]] (DFID), they launched the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA), a "Partnership of donors and international organizations working together to support OBA approaches to improving service delivery for the poor".&lt;ref&gt;Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid. (2009) "OUTPUT-BASED AID – FACT SHEET"&lt;/ref&gt;

The partnership has worked with various international partners to pursue output-based initiatives in fields of healthcare, water, energy, transport, telecommunications and education. As of June 2009, GPOBA has identified 128 OBA projects around the world, with a value of $3.3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid. (2009) "OUTPUT-BASED AID – FACT SHEET"&lt;/ref&gt;

German development bank [[KfW]] financed multi-district pilot projects in East Africa ([[Kenya]], Tanzania, and Uganda) and South Asia (Bangladesh and Cambodia) beginning in 2006.

== Advantages ==

According to the GPOBA, OBA improves upon other forms of aid in a number of ways. The first is by creating transparency since the provider and receiver of any subsidy will be known to each other and the public. Performance risk is shifted to the providers in OBA schemes since they are accountable for what they deliver. OBA schemes are said to provide incentives for innovation in projects as well as a means for mobilizing expertise and finance from the private sector. Finally, OBA provides internal tracking of results.&lt;ref&gt;Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid. (2009) "OUTPUT-BASED AID – FACT SHEET"&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Potts of [[Berkeley University]] believes OBA schemes to be more effective than traditional aid projects because they invest in extant infrastructure. OBA schemes can provide poor consumers with the leverage to determine the quality of the service they are provided with. For example, in a health-care project, individuals receiving OBA will gain choice in where they want to go for their health care needs, essentially a choice between options in the public and private sector. With OBA, existing service providers are granted subsidies based on the number of people who use their services. In this way an individual can choose between multiple service providers, whether public, private or non-governmental, and only after the service has been provided do they receive the subsidy.&lt;ref&gt;KFW Entwicklungsbank, "Interview with Prof. Dr. Malcolm Potts with respect to Output-Based-Aid (OBA) voucher schemes as a means of promoting public health in developing countries."&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to other aid schemes where projects were pre-funded by a donor, OBA uses explicit funding; if service providers fail to deliver, they and their investors, rather than taxpayers, who bear the brunt of financial loss.&lt;ref&gt;International Development Association. (2006). "A Review of the Use of Output-Based Aid Approaches" International Development Network Sustainable Development Network (October 2006). Available From &lt; http://siteresources.worldbank.org/IDA/Resources/Seminar%20PDFs/73449-1164920192653/IDANETOBA.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

For many common criticisms of development aid, see [[Aid#Criticism of aid|criticism of aid]].

OBA schemes have been criticized for their high administrative costs which exist for a number of reasons. The printing and distribution of vouchers can be costly.&lt;ref&gt;KFW Entwicklungsbank, "Interview with Prof. Dr. Malcolm Potts with respect to Output-Based-Aid (OBA) voucher schemes as a means of promoting public health in developing countries&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, there is significant cost in effectively monitoring outcomes of OBA schemes, and maintaining a process of transparency in OBA. Voucher theft or counterfeiting could be a serious issue for OBA projects. The sale on vouchers on the black market could easily disrupt the knowledge of where vouchers are distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Sandiford Peter, Gorter Anna and Salvetto Micol. "Public Policy for the Private Sector: Vouchers for Health." Viewpoint. (April 2002). Available From &lt; http://rru.worldbank.org/Documents/PapersLinks/OBA_Vouchers.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance-based [[conditionality]] has come under criticism for producing intermediate indicators which often distort the achievements of particular projects. These indicators, which only convey the success of certain actors and which are susceptible to manipulation, do not provide accurate indication of long-term changes of benefit to a region. Progress should be measured in more long-term objectives which encompass many sectors that contribute to the well-being of a population. For example, reducing [[child mortality]] requires many areas—health care, family planning and clean water—to be targeted, and even though intermediate indicators of an OBA scheme in one sector may appear positive, this does not necessarily identify progress in reducing child mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adam | first1 = Christopher | display-authors = etal   | year = 2004 | title = Performance-Based Conditionality: A European Perspective | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VC6-4C707KW-1&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1027828055&amp;_rerunOrigin=scholar.google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d1b753436aaea6aaebe1fcfa7190fe18 | journal = World Development | volume = 32 | issue = 6| pages = 1059–1070 | doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2004.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Private Sector Development Strategy which OBA is included in has come under heavy criticism for many of the same reasons the World Bank has been criticized for its work in the past as well as many new criticisms of the strategy itself. In response, it has been criticized for ignoring the many dimensions of poverty and not defining well how the "poor" would benefit from market interventions. The idea that private sector development and OBA will "shift risk" to private-sector service providers has been criticized since many private groups are risk averse when it comes to making a profit and thus would be hesitant in taking on projects lacking a guaranteed payoff.&lt;ref&gt;Bank plans private sector shake-up, Bretton Woods Update, January/February 2002.  Available From &lt; http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-16273&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Robert Wade, of the [[London School of Economics]], said in an article that the PSD strategy is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"A continuation of previous Bank policies to reduce the state to a coordination and regulation role, leaving private companies to organise production and service delivery."&lt;ref&gt;European Network on Debt and Development. "Private Sector Development – Pro-poor, or merely Poor, Service Delivery?" (April 2006). Available From &lt; http://www.eurodad.org/uploadedFiles/Whats_New/Reports/eurodad_privatesectordevelopment.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Much aid is tied to [[conditionality]] and, even though OBA rewards performance, it will mainly reward performance in the private sector. The PSD strategy looks to the private sector to develop infrastructure that will benefit the poor. An issue that many multinational corporations will receive some of the funding for OBAs has not been dealt with very well by the World Bank. Not only does this allow them to further their economic control of infrastructure in poorer nations, they are also able to avoid many of the risks of OBA through various agreements and by passing on some of the costs to the state and the taxpayers. For example, the lease for a [[Guinea]] water infrastructure OBA project:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
allowed the MNC to protect itself against cost increases by passing them on, with the government regulator unable to force the MNC to disclose enough information to judge the reasonableness of the requests."
&lt;ref&gt;European Network on Debt and Development. "Private Sector Development 
– Pro-poor, or merely Poor, Service Delivery?" (April 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Privatizing basic services is a contentious issue because contracting out service provision to private firms may be detrimental to universal service provision. Private firms look to make a profit, and if this is their primary motive then universal access becomes less of a priority. [[Accountability]] to state services may deteriorate. Many critics have noted that in developed countries, the state is responsible for basic services that the World Bank wants private firms to provide in developing countries. [[UNICEF]], in a study entitled "Basic Services for All: Public Spending and the Social Dimensions of Poverty", laid out moral, consensual, instrumental and historical grounds, arguing that state provision of basic services is mandatory regardless of circumstance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Santosh Mehrotra|Mehrotra, S.]],  Vandemoortele, J., E Delamonica (2000). " Basic services for all?: public spending and the social dimensions of poverty."&lt;/ref&gt;

Output-based approaches generally will rely on a well-established market, something that is not present in many developing countries. The regulatory and institutional mechanisms of the market are almost non-existent in many nations where OBA is used, and this does not allow domestic firms to compete on level ground with foreign firms. Sarah Anderson of the [[Institute for Policy Studies]] said that many grassroots and community organizations will not have the means to provide initial financing for service projects. They will be unable to sustain themselves until they get a subsidy for their performance. Rather, global firms that are already well established will more likely get OBA contracts, and in the process many local organization will no longer be part of the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;European Network on Debt and Development. "Private Sector Development – Pro-poor, or merely Poor, Service Delivery?" (April 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

The article "The Growing Dangers of Service Apartheid"&lt;ref&gt;Globalisation Challenge Initiative (2002) Growing Dangers of Service Apartheid: How the World Bank Group's Private Sector (PSD) Strategy Threatens Infrastructure and Basic Service Provision, News and Notices for IMF and World Bank Watchers, Vol 2 (5), Winter&lt;/ref&gt; written by the Globalization Challenge Initiative identified the following as challenges for OBA as it is described in the PSD strategy:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* The difficulty of targeting subsidies and "leakage", or capture, of subsidies by well-to-do groups: The PSD strategy does not question the assumption that subsidies can offset the costs of user fees for poor populations;
* The difficulty of identifying all people in order to properly target subsidies;
* The incentives for private providers to pocket subsidies;
* The lack of regulatory mechanisms, which can oversee and enforce OBA contracts and ensure that services are delivered in acceptable ways;
* The lack of judicial mechanisms that permit poor users to appeal or seek recourse when a contractor fails to deliver services in the specified manner;
* The fiscal liabilities assumed by the public sector when OBA schemes fail;
* The potential problems such as: cultural conflicts, accessibility, affordability and accountability problems that arise when increasingly the contractors in OBA schemes are from international or foreign service providers&lt;ref&gt;Globalisation Challenge Initiative (2002) Growing Dangers of Service Apartheid: How the World Bank Group's Private Sector (PSD) Strategy Threatens Infrastructure and Basic Service Provision, News and Notices for IMF and World Bank Watchers, Vol 2 (5), Winter&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Pax Britannica''''' (Latin for "British Peace", modelled after ''[[Pax Romana]]'') was the [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|period of relative peace between the Great Powers]] during which the [[British Empire]] became the global [[hegemony|hegemonic]] power and adopted the role of a global police force.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJohnston2008|Johnston]], pp.&amp;nbsp;508-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1815 and 1914, a period referred to as Britain's "imperial century",&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHyam2002|Hyam]], p.&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith1998|Smith]], p.&amp;nbsp;71.&lt;/ref&gt; around {{convert|10,000,000|sqmi|km2}} of territory and roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refParsons|Parsons]], p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Victory over [[Napoleonic France]] left the British without any serious international rival, other than perhaps [[The Great Game|Russia in central Asia]].&lt;ref name="#refOHBEv3|Porter, p. 401"&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;401.&lt;/ref&gt; When Russia tried expanding its influence in the Balkans, the British and French defeated them in the [[Crimean War]] (1854–1856), thereby protecting the feeble [[Ottoman Empire]].

Britain's [[Royal Navy]] controlled most of the key maritime trade routes and enjoyed [[Royal Navy#1815–1914|unchallenged sea power]]. Alongside the formal control exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled access to many regions, such as [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]]. British merchants, shippers and bankers had such an overwhelming advantage over everyone else that in addition to its colonies it had an  "[[Informal Empire|informal empire]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refOHBEv3|Porter]], p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarshall|Marshall]], pp.&amp;nbsp;156–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCameron1991|Cameron]], pp.&amp;nbsp;45-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further information|History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom#1814–1914|International relations of the Great Powers (1814–1919)|Timeline of British diplomatic history#1815–1860}}
After losing the American colonies in the [[American Revolution]], Britain turned towards Asia, the Pacific and later Africa with subsequent exploration leading to the rise of the [[Second British Empire]] (1783–1815). The [[Industrial Revolution]] began in Great Britain in the late 1700s and new ideas emerged about free markets, such as Adam Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'' (1776). Free trade became a central principle that Britain practiced by the 1840s. It played a key role in Britain's [[European Miracle|economic growth]] and [[Global financial system#Emergence of financial globalization: 1870–1914|financial dominance]].&lt;ref name="refDarwin2012"&gt;[[#refDarwin2012|Darwin]], p.&amp;nbsp;391.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815 until [[World War I]] in 1914, the United Kingdom played the role of global [[Hegemony|hegemon]] (most powerful actor).  Imposition of a "British Peace" on key maritime trade routes began in 1815 with the annexation of [[British Ceylon#Kandyan Wars|British Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka).&lt;ref name="refCrawfurd1830"&gt;[[#refCrawfurd1830|Crawfurd]], pp.&amp;nbsp;191–192: "...for what purpose was it conquered and is it now retained?' We endeavoured to explain, that during the wars, in which we were lately engaged with our European enemies who occupied the coast of the island, they harassed our commerce from its ports, and therefore, in self-defence, there was a necessity for taking possession of it."&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[British Residency of the Persian Gulf]], local Arab rulers agreed to a number of treaties that formalised Britain’s protection of the region. Britain imposed an anti-piracy treaty, known as the [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820]], on all Arab rulers in the region. By signing the Perpetual Maritime Truce of 1853, Arab rulers gave up their right to wage war at sea in return for British protection against external threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The British in the Gulf: An Overview|url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/british-gulf-overview|website=Qatar Digital Library|publisher=British Library Qatar Foundation Partnership|accessdate=25 October 2014|quote=The increased stability that this 'Pax Britannica' brought led to increased volumes of trade in the region. Ruling families began to actively seek British protection as a means of securing their rule and safeguarding their territories.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global superiority of [[British Armed Forces|British military]] and commerce was aided by a divided and relatively weak continental Europe, and the presence of the [[Royal Navy]] on all of the world's oceans and seas. Even outside its formal empire, Britain controlled trade with many countries such as China, [[Thailand|Siam]], and Argentina. Following the [[Congress of Vienna]] the British Empire's economic strength continued to develop through naval dominance&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPugh99|Pugh]], p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; and diplomatic efforts to maintain a [[balance of power (international relations)|balance of power]] in continental Europe.&lt;ref name="refThackeray2002"&gt;[[#refThackeray2002|Thackeray]], p.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this era, the Royal Navy provided services around the world that benefited other nations, such as the [[Piracy#History|suppression of piracy]] and [[Blockade of Africa|blocking the slave trade]]. The [[Slave Trade Act 1807]] had banned the trade across the British Empire, after which the Royal Navy established the [[West Africa Squadron]] and the government negotiated [[Abolition of slavery timeline#1800–1849|international treaties]] under which they could enforce the ban.&lt;ref name="refFalola2007"&gt;[[#refFalola2007|Falola]], pp.&amp;nbsp;xxi, xxxiii-xxxiv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The legal and diplomatic background to the seizure of foreign vessels by the Royal Navy|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea power, however, did not project on land. Land wars fought between the major powers include the [[Crimean War]], the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]], the [[Austro-Prussian War]] and the [[Franco-Prussian War]], as well as numerous conflicts between lesser powers. The Royal Navy prosecuted the [[First Opium War]] (1839{{ndash}}1842) and [[Second Opium War]] (1856{{ndash}}1860) against [[Qing dynasty|Imperial China]]. The Royal Navy was superior to any other two navies in the world, combined. Between 1815 and the passage of the German naval laws of 1890 and 1898, only France was a potential naval threat.

Britain [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#19th century|traded goods and capital]] extensively with countries around the world, adopting a free trade policy after 1840. The growth of British imperial strength was further underpinned by the [[Steamboat|steamship]] and the [[Telegraphy|telegraph]], new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the empire. By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, the so-called [[All Red Line]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDalziel2006|Dalziel]], pp.&amp;nbsp;88–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pax Britannica'' was weakened by the breakdown of the continental order which had been established by the Congress of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPugh99|Pugh]], p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between the Great Powers of Europe were strained to breaking point by issues such as the decline of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which led to the [[Crimean War]], and later the emergence of new nation states in the form of Italy and Germany after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Both of these wars involved Europe's largest states and armies. The industrialisation of [[Germany]], the [[Empire of Japan]], and the [[United States]] contributed to the relative decline of British industrial supremacy in the late 19th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4194">The '''Rural Business-Cooperative Service''' (abbreviated as "RBS") is one of three agencies within [[USDA Rural Development]]  (along with the [[Rural Housing Service]] and [[Rural Utilities Service]]) responsible for administering various economic development programs to rural communities in the United States and its territories.  Because these three agencies are closely aligned, they are commonly referred to as the [[USDA Rural Development, Business &amp; Cooperative Programs]].

The mission of the RBS is to enhance the quality of life for rural Americans by providing leadership in building competitive businesses including sustainable cooperatives that can prosper in the global marketplace.

The organization meets these goals by:
*Investing financial resources and providing technical assistance to businesses and cooperatives located in rural communities.
*Establishing strategic alliances and partnerships that leverage public, private, and cooperative resources to create jobs and stimulate rural economic activity.

In addition to supporting rural business, economic, and cooperative development, the Agency has become increasingly involved in [[renewable energy]] and [[value-added agriculture]] since the enactment of the [[Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002|2002 Farm Bill]].

==Organization==
The Rural Business-Cooperative Service is headed by an Administrator who reports directly to the Assistant to the Secretary for Rural Development, who in turn reports to the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture|Secretary of Agriculture]].

Business &amp; Cooperative Programs staff are headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], but the Agency has a presence in every state and U.S. territory.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, John. [http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10124776_ITM USDA's expanding cooperative development assistance role.] ''[[Rural Cooperatives]].'' 1 July 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically there is a Business &amp; Cooperative Program section associated with each USDA Rural Development State Office. These State Offices and their subordinate Area Office staff are responsible for most program delivery.

==Programs==
#Guaranteed loans. These are "lender-driven" programs, whereby business loans (generally made by commercial banks) receive a Federal loan guarantee. The guarantee is designed to support and incentivize rural business lending and to support rural job creation and retention.  The primary program in this category is the Business &amp; Industry (B&amp;I) guaranteed loan program.
#Direct loans. Direct loans are made to intermediary economic development groups who will in turn assist private rural business development through the re-lending of these funds. Note that the Agency does not make loans directly to for-profit businesses or individuals.
#Grants to nonprofits &amp; public bodies. Typically these grants are made to nonprofit economic development groups, towns, or tribes who will undertake some project in support of private rural business development.
#Grants to private rural businesses &amp; agricultural producers. These grants are narrowly targeted and competitively awarded in support of value-added agricultural ventures and in support of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. Matching funds from 50-75% are typically required.

The RBS also publishes the bi-monthly [[Rural Cooperatives]] magazine. Nearly all of the Agency's programs are funded annually through Congressional appropriation as part of the U.S. Federal Government budget process.

'''Samajwadi Party''' ( '''SP''' ; [[translation]]: ''Socialist Party'',  founded 4 October 1992 ) is a [[political party]] in [[India]] headquartered in [[New Delhi]] and the largest recognised state party of the country. Based in [[Uttar Pradesh]], a northern [[States of India|state in India]], it describes itself as a [[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-16330708|title=Why Uttar Pradesh is India's battleground state|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Samajwadi Party was one of several parties that emerged when the [[Janata Dal]] (People's League) fragmented into several regional parties. The Samajwadi Party is led by former [[Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh]] [[Akhilesh Yadav]] after he was chosen the President by the National Convention held on 1 January 2017.

The Samajwadi Party  is primarily based in Uttar Pradesh State. It has contested [[Lok Sabha]] and State Assembly elections around the country, though its successes have been mainly in Uttar Pradesh.In the [[Uttar Pradesh legislative assembly election, 2012|2012 legislative assembly elections]] of Uttar Pradesh, SP registered a landslide victory with a clear majority in the House, thus enabling it to form the government in the state. This was expected to be the fifth term of Mulayam Singh Yadav as Chief Minister of state, but he surprised everyone by selecting his son, Akhilesh Yadav, to be the new chief minister (the youngest ever). It became official on 15 March. It was also the first time that SP was head of the UP government for a full term of 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eciresults.nic.in/PartyWiseResult.htm |title=Assembly Elections May 2013 Results |publisher=Election Commission of India |date= |accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Assembly Elections 2012 - The end of Mayayug in UP|url=http://indiavoice.info/201203061495/news-desk/politics/assembly-elections-2012-the-end-of-mayayug-in-up.html |publisher=IndiaVoice |accessdate=7 March 2012|date=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Position in state and national politics ==
The Samajawadi Party provided outside support to the [[United Progressive Alliance]] government up to the sixteenth general election, After the sixteenth general election its support became unnecessary when the UPA became the largest alliance. It contested the 2009 general election in alliance with the [[Rashtriya Janata Dal]] and the [[Lok Janshakti Party]] of [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SP, RJD, LJP Front to kickstart UP campaign on Apr 9|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-04-05/india/28011955_1_election-meeting-saifai-star-campaigner|accessdate=16 June 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=5 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last general election, the Samajwadi Party was defeated by the BJP in Uttar Pradesh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2899628/SP-chief-Mulayam-Singh-Yadav-admits-lost-Lok-Sabha-polls.html|title=SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav admits he 'almost lost the Lok Sabha polls'|date=6 January 2015|work=Mail Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently the thirteenth largest party in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Members/partywiselist.aspx |title=Sixteenth LokSabha Party wise |website=loksabha.nic.in |publisher=LokSabha |accessdate=5 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018225726/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/Members/partywiselist.aspx |archivedate=18 October 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the general elections of 2014, it won only 5 seats, while the [[Indian National Congress]] gained 44 seats and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] obtained a clear mandate with 282 seats.

In [[West Bengal]], the [[West Bengal Socialist Party]] of [[Kiranmoy Nanda]] merged with the SP. The SP has two MLAs in [[Bihar]] and one MLA each in [[Karnataka]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[West Bengal]].

In April 2014, the [[Save Indian Family Foundation]] encouraged voters to support the Samajwadi Party or vote [[None of the above]] because the Samajwadi Party had stated that it opposed the alleged misuse of gender bias laws.&lt;ref name="misuse"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/lok-sabha-elections-2014/news/Vote-for-Samajwadi-Party-or-press-Nota-Mulayam/articleshow/33835972.cms|title=Vote for Samajwadi Party or press Nota: Mulayam|last=Anuraag Singh|date=17 April 2014|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Muzzaffarnagar case ==
{{Main article|2013 Muzaffarnagar riots}}
The clashes between the Hindu and Muslim communities in [[Muzaffarnagar district]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], India in August - September 2013, resulted in at &lt;ref name="Business News, India Stock Market, Personal Finance, IPO, Financial News Headlines - The Financial Express"&gt;{{cite news|title=Uttar Pradesh: Akhilesh Yadav government to provide jobs to Muzaffarnagar riot victims|url=http://archive.financialexpress.com/news/uttar-pradesh-akhilesh-yadav-government-to-provide-jobs-to-muzaffarnagar-riot-victims/1175575|accessdate=20 May 2016|work=The Financial Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; least 9 deaths and injured 34 after which an indefinite [[curfew]] was imposed.&lt;ref name="hindu2"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahmed Ali Fayyaz |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/9-killed-in-communal-riots-in-muzaffarnagar-curfew-clamped-army-deployed/1166053/ |title=9 killed in communal riots in Muzaffarnagar, curfew clamped, army deployed |work=The Indian Express |date=8 September 2013 |accessdate=8 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 17 September, the curfew was lifted from all riot affected areas and the army was also withdrawn. Several people associated with [[Bharatiya Janta Party]] including Sangeet Som were accused.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

The riot has been described as "the worst violence in Uttar Pradesh in recent history"; the army's deployment was its first in the state for 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21586587-next-years-election-may-be-fuelling-hindu-muslim-violence-uttar-pradesh-old-curse-returns|title=An old curse returns|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme court blamed the ruling government of not handling the situation well.

== Proposed merger ==
In 2014, there was a proposed merger of Samajwadi Party with some other [[Janata Parivar]] parties uniting with [[Lalu Prasad Yadav]] and [[Nitish Kumar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/janata-parivar-parties-announce-merger-mulayam-singh-yadav-to-head-new-party/article7105570.ece|title=Janata Parivar announces merger, Mulayam to head new party|last=Gupta|first=Smita|work=The Hindu|access-date=2017-03-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patnadaily.com/index.php/news/10305-merger-of-rjd-jd-u-sp-would-take-place-after-kharrmas-lalu.html|title=Merger of RJD, JD-U, SP would take place after Kharmas: Lalu|publisher=|date=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family feud ==

Since Akhilesh Yadav became Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, the Yadav family has been divided into two feuding groups. One of the groups is led  by him with the support of  his father's cousin, [[Ram Gopal Yadav]]. The rival group is led by [[Shivpal Singh Yadav]] and a friend, [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]]. Akhilesh Yadav has  fired his uncle twice from his cabinet as it was seen by many as a direct challenge to his father Mulayam Singh Yadav, who has steadily supported his younger brother Shivpal over him.&lt;ref&gt;http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/53902522.cms&lt;/ref&gt;

Battle in the family fired up when Akhilesh Yadav released a parallel list of 235 candidates for 2017 Uttar Pradesh election. Mulayam Singh Yadav and Shivpal Singh Yadav already has released list of 325 candidates few days before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news18.com/news/politics/akhilesh-tipu-yadav-emerges-as-new-sultan-of-samajwadi-party-1329985.html Akhilesh 'Tipu' Yadav Emerges as New Sultan of Samajwadi Party]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 December 2016, Mulayam Singh Yadav expelled his son Akhilesh Yadav and Ram Gopal Yadav from the party for six years on the grounds of indiscipline but re-inducted within 24 hours after a meet of 200 of the party’s 229 MLAs at Akhilesh residence.

=== National Convention of January  2017 ===

In a National Convention held on 1 January 2017 called by Ram Gopal Yadav, Akhilesh Yadav was declared the National President of Samajwadi Party. [[Naresh Chandra Uttam]] was named as Uttar Pradesh state president of the party.

In the mean time Mulayam Singh Yadav expelled Ram Gopal Yadav for six years for the third time in six months. Expulsion also included vice-president [[Kiranmoy Nanda]] and state general secretary [[Naresh Agarwal]] were also expelled for attending the convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/samajwadi-party-akhiesh-yadav-ramgopal-mulayam-singh-party-chief-expels-crisis-4454449/ Akhilesh Yadav is new party chief, Mulayam Singh expels Ramgopal]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/akhilesh-yadav-uncle-shivpal-factions-fight-for-samajwadi-party-office-1643954 Akhilesh Yadav, Uncle Shivpal Factions Fight Over Samajwadi Party Office]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the convention, the party is apparently divided and is headed by two competing presidents. Akhilesh Yadav and his father both are representing themselves as party presidents. However the constitution of the party categorically states that any convention can only be called by its president and if an other member wants a convention to be called, he has to collect the signatures of 40% members and submit it to national president. If the president then fails to call the convention that individual member may call for the convention. In this case however, Akhilesh Faction has acted against the party constitution and technically Mulayam Singh Yadav is still the party president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/akhilesh-yadav-samajwadi-party-mulayam-singh-uttar-pradesh-elections/1/847357.html Akhilesh or Mulayam: Who will keep Samajwadi Party's election symbol, another dangal begins]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election commission gets involved===
After the national convention was declared illegal by Mulayam Singh Yadav and further truce talks failed Mulayam Singh along with Amar Singh and Jaya Prada decided to go to the Election Commission to sort out the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thequint.com/yadav-dangal/2017/01/01/live-samajwadi-party-meetakhilesh-yadav-ram-gopal-yadav-attack-shivpal-mulayam-singh-yadav-amar-singh-uttar-pradesh/|title=Mulayam and Amar singh head to EC|publisher=The Quint|date=January 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Election Commission gave time until 9 January to submit the related documents to both sides to submit required documents that show support of the party members. The Akhilesh camp submitted affidavits showing notable support for the Chief Minister on 7 January.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/elections/uttar-pradesh-assembly-elections-2017/over-90-delegates-with-sp-led-by-akhilesh-ramgopal-yadav-4463908/|title=Akhilesh and Ramgopal submit documents to EC|publisher=Indian Express|date=January 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Election Commission then fixed 3 January for hearing the Samajwadi Party (SP) factions led by Mulayam Singh Yadav and his son Akhilesh Yadav to settle the dispute over control of the party and its election symbol, ‘cycle’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Samajwadi-Party-row-EC-to-hear-both-factions-on-January-13/article17018123.ece/|title=EC to hear both sides on January 13|publisher=The Hindu|date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Election Commission heard both factions for about 4 hours and reserved its order on who gets ownership to the party’s cycle symbol. The Akhilesh faction was represented by senior lawyers Rajeev Dhavan and Kapil Sibal and Mulayam Singh faction was represented by senior advocate and former Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran. Parasaran argued that the Election Commission lacked jurisdiction to allocate the symbol to one of the factions as there was no split in the party such as SP (Mulayam) and SP (Akhilesh) and there was no splinter group. He also said the meeting called by Ramgopal Yadav on 1 January in which Akhilesh was elected Samajwadi Party president, was not in accordance with the party’s constitution and therefore, was illegal and unauthorised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/EC-reserves-order-in-SP-election-symbol-dispute/article17035570.ece/|title=Ec hears both factions|publisher=The Hindu|date=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 January, the election commission announced its decision and Akhilesh Yadav was declared the rightful owner of his Samajwadi Party's symbol, the cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/up-elections-2017-akhilesh-yadav-gets-samajwadi-partys-cycle-symbol-says-election-commission-1649414/|title=Akhilesh gets the cycle|publisher=NDTV|date=January 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9469">'''Seth Bringman''' (born July 17, 1981) is a former [[political campaign]] strategist for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] in the [[United States]].

== Career ==
Bringman worked as a researcher on then-Senator [[Hillary Clinton]]'s 2008 presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hillary Clinton-Ohio Organization|url = http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2008/clinton/clintonorgoh.html|website = www.gwu.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later served as communications director of the [[Ohio Democratic Party]] from 2009 to 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ohio Democratic Party veteran Seth Bringman joins group promoting Hillary Clinton for president|url = http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/02/ohio_democratic_party_veteran.html|website = cleveland.com|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Bringman became the first employee of [[Ready for Hillary]], a [[SuperPAC]] focusing on [[grassroots organizing]] to support Clinton's potential 2016 presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hillary Clinton PAC Staffs Up|url = https://www.buzzfeed.com/rubycramer/hillary-clinton-pac-staffs-up|website = BuzzFeed|accessdate = 2015-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bringman on board with group promoting Hillary Clinton for presidency in 2016|url = http://www.dispatch.com/content/blogs/the-daily-briefing/2013/02/02-30-13-bringman-on-board-with-group-promoting-hillary-clinton.html|website = The Columbus Dispatch|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; As communications director, he served as [[spokesperson]] for the PAC and its supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bringman: PAC to Defend Hillary Clinton's Record|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/b/bd524f5b-1a51-4d0d-b398-63374c1f8050|website = Bloomberg.com|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Ready for Hillary: The smartest political business in recent memory|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/04/06/ready-for-hillary-the-smartest-political-business-in-recent-memory/|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2015-04-06|access-date = 2015-11-30|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Philip|last = Bump}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Soros Signs Up With ‘Ready for Hillary’|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2013/10/24/soros-signs-up-with-ready-for-hillary/|website = WSJ Blogs - Washington Wire|date = 2013-10-24|accessdate = 2015-11-30|first = Peter|last = Nicholas}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ready for Hillary adds $2 million to its war chest - CNNPolitics.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/15/politics/ready-for-hillary-third-quarter/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the driver of the group's "[[Hillary Bus]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ready for Hillary?|url = http://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/article4591195.html|website = star-telegram|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Book documents efforts to convince Hillary to run in '16.|url = http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/ohioans-book-describes-days-before-hillary-decided/npXd4/|website = www.daytondailynews.com|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bringman is the author of the book, "Ready for Hillary: The Official, Inside Story of the Campaign before the Campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ready for Hillary: The Official, Inside Story of the Campaign before the Campaign|url = https://www.amazon.com/Ready-Hillary-Official-Inside-Campaign-ebook/dp/B017AL8QKM|language = English|first = Seth|last = Bringman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ex-Clinton super PAC official to publish insider account|url = http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/ex-clinton-super-pac-official-publish-insider-account|website = MSNBC|accessdate = 2015-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Book documents efforts to convince Hillary to run in '16.|url = http://m.daytondailynews.com/news/news/national-govt-politics/ohioans-book-describes-days-before-hillary-decided/npXd4/|website = m.daytondailynews.com|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York Times reported that Bringman and other officials of Ready for Hillary super PAC were not offered initial posts on Clinton's official campaign. Bringman declined to comment for the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/07/17/job-at-hillary-clintons-super-pac-didnt-assure-a-campaign-post/|title=Job at Hillary Clinton's 'Super PAC' Didn't Assure a Campaign Post|last=Haberman|first=Maggie|date=2015-07-17|website=The New York Times - First Draft|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Nina Turner]], also from Ohio, changed her support from Hillary Clinton to [[Bernie Sanders]] during the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Democratic primary]], Bringman criticized her decision, noting that she had left her post at the Ohio Democratic Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/former-clinton-backer-switches-team-sanders|title=Former Clinton backer switches to team Sanders|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/11/why_nina_turners_shift_from_hi.html|title=Why Nina Turner's shift from Hillary Clinton to Bernie Sanders matters: Ohio Politics Roundup|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2016, Bringman expressed optimism in an interview that the Democratic Party would unite behind Clinton and that supporters of Bernie Sanders would vote for her in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/280622-clinton-fury-grows-with-sanders|title=Clinton fury with Sanders grows|last=Swanson|first=Ian|date=2016-05-20|access-date=2016-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2020 cycle, he has spoken positively about the prospect of a 2020 presidential run by U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), saying that Warren would have widespread support.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/390154-clinton-allies-open-to-backing-warren-for-president-in-2020?amp|title=Clinton allies open to backing Warren for president in 2020|last=Weaver|first=Dustin|date=2018-06-01|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociotechnology''' (short for "social technology") is the study of processes on the intersection of [[society]] and [[technology]].&lt;ref name="Bunge1999"&gt;{{citation | last = Bunge | first = Mario | author-link = Mario Bunge | contribution = Sociotechnology | editor-last = Bunge | editor-first = Mario | editor-link = Mario Bunge | title = Social science under debate: a philosophical perspective | publisher = University of Toronto Press | location = Toronto, Ontario Buffalo, New York | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780802083579 | page = 297 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=-MLjZzJLbpkC&amp;pg=PA297&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Vojinović and Abbott define it as "the study of processes in which the social and the technical are indivisibly combined".&lt;ref name="VojinovićAbbott2012-164"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Vojinović | first1 = Zoran | last2 = Abbott | first2 = Michael B. | title = Flood risk and social justice: from quantitative to qualitative flood risk assessment and mitigation | publisher = IWA Publishing | location = London | year = 2012 | page = 164 | isbn = 9781843393870 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sociotechnology is an important part of socio-technical design, which is defined as "designing things that participate in complex systems that have both social and technical aspects".&lt;ref name=Radziwill2009&gt;{{cite web|last1=Radziwill|first1=Nicole|title=What is Sociotechnology?|url=https://qualityandinnovation.com/2009/01/19/what-is-sociotechnology/|website=Quality and Innovation|accessdate=27 February 2017|date=19 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has been attributed to [[Mario Bunge]].&lt;ref name="WeingartnerDorn1990"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Weingartner | first1 = Paul | last2 = Dorn | first2 = Georg J. W. | title = Studies on Mario Bunge's Treatise | publisher = Rodopi | location = Amsterdam Atlanta, Georgia | year = 1990 | page = 426 | isbn = 9789051831870 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines it as a grouping of [[social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] and [[management science]].&lt;ref name="Farmer1995"&gt;{{cite book | last = Farmer | first = David John | author-link = David John Farmer | title = The language of public administration: bureaucracy, modernity, and postmodernity | publisher = University of Alabama Press | location = Tuscaloosa, Alabama | year = 1995 | page = 95 | isbn = 9780817307844 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=TxDGwJq_FOoC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; He sees it thus as a form of technology, distinguished from other branches of it such as [[engineering]], [[biotechnology]], [[information technology]] and [[general technology]]. Its goal is to help engineer [[sociosystems]] and evaluate their performance, while making use of [[social science]] research.&lt;ref name="Farmer1995"/&gt; In short, sociotechnology can be seen as the creation, modification and maintenance of social systems.&lt;ref name="WeingartnerDorn1990"/&gt;

Writing on sociotechnical change, [[Wiebe Bijker|Bijker]] wrote: "Society is not [[Technological determinism|determined by technology]], nor is technology determined by society. Both emerge as two sides of the sociotechnical coin."&lt;ref name="Bijker1997"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bijker | first = Wiebe E. | author-link = Wiebe Bijker | title = Of bicycles, bakelites, and bulbs: toward a theory of sociotechnical change | publisher = MIT Press | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1997 | page = 274 | isbn = 9780262522274 |url=http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/students/envs_5110/bijker.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology is the sum of ways in which social groups construct the material objects of their civilizations. The things made are socially constructed just as much as technically constructed. The merging of these two things, construction and insight, is sociotechnology. "For example, we typically build a bridge when there’s some expectation that people need to get from Point A to Point B, and there’s something they need to bypass along the way (e.g. a river, a canyon, another road). Failure to consider the social factors as well as the technical factors could lead to a "bridge to nowhere" – and we all know at least one person who’s had a problem with those"&lt;ref name=Radziwill2009&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Business==

Business use "richness and reach". The richness and reach strategy has evolved with technology. Richness is the ability to understand the information being passed for example calling someone is less rich than face to face contact. Reach is the number of people who exchange the information. In the past it was easier to complete richness and reach, but now with new technologies like video chatting, it is easier for business to do fulfill both richness and reach. Positive economics is the study of existing (or historical) means of exchange- a social science such as sociology, history, and political sciences. Normative economics is the social technology because it attempts to create different kinds of economic arrangements.

==Community and technology==

Accelerating growth of technology is a major problem and cause of destabilization of a communicational world. [[Paul Virilio]] believes that the "real" is being mistaken by virtual and the virtual world destroys physical presence. [[Marshall McLuhan]] wrote about the extension of human senses and the nervous system into the world through electronic media. Essentially he believes that the mind, the self, and consciousness are made from already created technology, media, and language as opposed to create naturally like those who made technology, media, and language. The image of one’s self becomes aware of itself in a world of technology. Consciousness and desire become less individualistic and turns into more already constituted social forms. The response to how someone feels something, what it means, and how it feels (for example feeling "attached" to someone after losing your virginity to them) is already set up through media communication (show, music, movies, articles). People will anticipate that they will be attached because of what they already know about it, so when it happens they do feel attached because that is how they were programmed to feel. People have turned to technology to create their "self" and determine how they feel and act. The conscious mind does not move into a world-as-other mindset but into an already constituted world.

Lewis Mumford believed the world of relying on technology began with early human experiments in industrialization including coal mines because coal and iron built and powered industrialization. It has come to the point where communication is relied on technology. Conversation turned into talking through a machine (texting, phone calls, social media).

The difference between the past and present technology is the extent of social binding. The more social forces it binds together the more powerful the technology is. For example, the attack on the World Trade Center as opposed to the attack of Pearl Harbor. It took a year to see the film of the attack on the American battleships. Because of this, people were more unaware and it was less of a big deal than what 9-11 was. During the terrorist attack in 2001, everything was broadcast in the moment. People were seeing the destruction with their own eyes in the moment, causing more ridicule and passion for the situation.

==Robots replacing people==
{{Further|Technological unemployment|Social robot}}
Furbie and Tamagotchi are electronic toys made for children that make noises and demand for care. These toys caused children to form a companionship with robots instead of human beings. Paro is a robotic baby seal that was created in Japan to perform therapeutic functions. Paro had positive psychological results for those in nursing homes. A woman constantly argued with her son and turned to the Paro for comfort and confided in the Paro instead of fixing things with her son. Society has turned to demanding more intimacy from sociable robots then from each other. People that use the robots for comfort feel like they are being comforted by someone even though they are actually alone. These robotic characters cause people to have a relationship with technology while avoiding the trouble of human interaction.

==Social technology==

Science and technology are big contributions to the economic development, but can also lead to negative side effects as it evolves. For example, people care more about materialistic things than the negative influences they have created in human morals and education. For example, it is more important for people to know words to songs than to remember things for their test. There are other problems due to the development of new technologies such as the conservation of the environment because there is a demand for more products which leads to more destruction of environment to build more to sell from. Many social problems have appeared in society and cannot seem to be solved by natural science and technology alone. It requires the need for social sciences as well. Social technology is the strategy used to help solve the wrong behaviors in the world that are caused by social problems like how to solve the issue of people being invested in materialistic goods more than morals, so that they economy can still continue to grow, and society can be a better place.

== Response ==

=== Criticism ===

==== Claims of racism ====
One of the preambles to the pledge, drew massive amounts of criticism for claiming that children of slaves were more likely to live in a 2 parent household. 
"Slavery had a disastrous impact on African-American families, yet sadly a child born into slavery in 1860 was more likely to be raised by his mother and father in a two-parent household than was an African-American baby born after the election of the USA's first African-American President." &lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt; 
Several days later, Plaats sent out an email clarifying that 
"Our critics are distorting the facts and misrepresenting The Marriage Vow.  The preamble to the vow references relevant and sobering data which points to marriages and families being in crisis.  The FAMiLY LEADER has never made the claim, nor ever will, that slavery was better for families." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vander Hart|first=Shane|title=Bob Vander Plaats Responds to Critics of The FAMiLY Leader's "Marriage Vow"|url=http://caffeinatedthoughts.com/2011/07/bob-vander-plaats-responds-to-critics-of-the-family-leaders-marriage-vow/|publisher=Caffeinated Thoughts|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The preamble was later removed from the pledge.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

==== Gary Johnson ====
On July 19, [[Gary Johnson]] published an article in the [[Huffington Post]] criticizing The Marriage Vow. He claimed that the pledge endorsed government intervention into the personal lives of citizens, while criticizing the discriminatory language of the pledge. He went on to state that Pledge's focus on social issues redirected attention from areas like the economy.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

==== Other criticisms ====
House Speaker Pro-Tem [[Jeff Kaufmann]] said the pledge had "ridiculous implications", refused to sign, and told Plaats that his "integrity is in question" and "political credibility is waning to the point of no impact." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clayworth|first=Jason|title=Presidential marriage pledge has 'ridiculous implications' GOP leader tells Vander Plaats|url=http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2011/07/22/presidential-marriage-pledge-has-ridiculous-implications-gop-leader-tells-vander-plaats/|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=Des Moines Register|date=2011-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Iowa State Senator [[Jeff Angelo]] said "This pledge is an attempt to shut down dialogue between voters and the people vying to represent them.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Update: Bachmann is first to sign Family Leader's pro-marriage pledge|url=http://caucuses.desmoinesregister.com/2011/07/07/update-bachmann-is-first-to-sign-family-leaders-pro-marriage-pledge/|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=Des Moines Register|date=2011-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]] called the pledge "undignified and inappropriate." Romney's campaign later clarified that he would not sign because preamble suggesting children of slaves were better off than today.&lt;ref name="Romneynotsigning"&gt;{{cite news|title=Mitt Romney Not Signing Family Leader's 'Marriage Pledge'|url=http://www.urbanchristiannews.com/ucn/2011/07/mitt-romney-not-signing-family-leaders-marriage-pledge.html|accessdate=18 March 2014|newspaper=Urban Christian News|date=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Notable signatures ===
The 2 most notable signatures came from Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann. Rick Santorum was the first presidential candidate to contact The Family Leader after the organization publicly announced the pledge. Michele [[Bachmann]] also contacted The Family Leader to sign the pledge, and became the first Candidate to send her signed document to the organization.&lt;ref name="PETROSKI"/&gt;
Although [[Newt Gingrich]] did not sign the pledge, he wrote a lengthy letter in which he upheld many of the principles of the pledge including personal fidelity to his wife, respecting the marital bonds of others, enforcing the defense of marriage act, to support a federal marriage amendment, and to oppose any definition of marriage outside of "one man and one woman." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falcone|first=Michael|title=Newt Gingrich Pledges 'Personal Fidelity to My Spouse'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/12/newt-gingrich-pledges-personal-fidelity-to-my-spouse/|accessdate=19 March 2014|newspaper=ABC|date=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The pledge was also signed by former [[Texas]] governor [[Rick Perry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Travis|first=Shannon|title=Perry signs Family Leader's controversial marriage vow|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/11/21/perry-signs-family-leaders-controversial-marriage-vow/|accessdate=19 March 2014|newspaper=CNN|date=21 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''tithing''' or '''tything''' was a historic English legal, administrative or territorial unit, originally ten [[hide (unit)|hides]] (and hence, one tenth of a [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]]). Tithings later came to be seen as subdivisions of a [[manor]] or [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]]. The tithing's leader or spokesman was known as a ''[[headborough|tithingman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/tithing Dictionary definition of "Tithing"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416030254/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/tithing |date=2013-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/Ti/Tithingman.html Dictionary definition of "Tithingman"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}. Webster's Online Dictionary. Retrieved 19&amp;nbsp;January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The noun ''tithing'' is not to be confused with the verb ''tithing'', nor the act of ''tithing'', though they partly share the same origin. The noun breaks down as ''ten'' + ''thing'', which is to say, a [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] (an assembly) of the households who live in an area that comprises ten [[Hide (unit)|hide]]s. Comparable words are [[Danish language|Danish]] ''herredthing'' for a [[hundred (administrative subdivision)|hundred]], and [[English language|English]] ''[[husting]]'' for a single household.

Sound changes in the prehistory of English are responsible for the first part of the word looking so different from the word ''ten''. In the West Germanic dialects which became [[Old English]], ''n'' had a tendency to [[elision|elide]] when positioned immediately before a ''th''.

==History==

The term originated in the 10th century, when a tithing meant the households in an area comprising ten hides. The heads of each of those households were referred to as ''tithingmen''; historically they were assumed to all be males, and older than 12 (an adult, in the context of the time). Each ''tithingman'' was individually responsible for the actions and behaviour of all the members of the tithing, by a system known as [[frankpledge]].

Unlike areas dominated by [[Wessex]], [[Kent]] had been settled by [[Jutes]] rather than [[Saxons]], and retained elements of its historical identity [[Kingdom of Kent|as a separate and wealthy kingdom]] into the middle ages. While Wessex and Mercia eventually grouped their hundreds into [[Shire]]s, Kent grouped hundreds into ''[[Lathe (county subdivision)|lathes]]''. [[Sussex]], which had also been [[Kingdom of Sussex|a separate kingdom]], similarly grouped its hundreds into ''[[Rape (county subdivision)|rapes]]''. The different choice of terminology continued to the level of the tithing; in Kent, parts of [[Surrey]], and Sussex, the equivalent term was a '''borgh''', '''borow''', or '''borough''' (not to be confused with ''[[ancient borough|borough]]'' in its more usual sense of a chartered or privileged town);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=David |editor1-last=Parsons |editor2-first=Tania |editor2-last=Styles |title=The Vocabulary of English Place-Names (Á–Cox) |publisher=Centre for English Name Studies |place=Nottingham |year=1997 |page=129 |isbn=0952534355 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baker |first=A.R.H. |url=http://www.bahs.org.uk/AgHRVOL.html?YEAR=1966&amp;MOD=this |title=Field Systems in the Vale of Holmesdale |journal=Agricultural History Review |volume=14 |issue=1 |year=1966 |page=11 (note) }} Click on the link for "Full text of article" to download the article in PDF format.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/e179/details.asp?piece_id=29684&amp;doc_id=2329&amp;doc_ref=E179/249/33 E 179/249/33 Part 2 of 10]. (1663). The National Archives. Retrieved 19&amp;nbsp;January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; their equivalent to the tithingman was therefore a ''borsholder'', ''borough-holder'' or ''[[headborough]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, S. et al. (1835), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UTVAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''English Dictionary''], p.&amp;nbsp;148.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/borsholder Dictionary definition of "Borsholder"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130416153231/http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/borsholder |date=2013-04-16 }}. Webster's Online Dictionary. Retrieved 19&amp;nbsp;January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Norman Conquest]] introduced the feudal system, which quickly displaced the importance of the hundred as an administrative unit. With the focus on [[court baron|manorial courts]] for administration and minor justice, tithings came to be seen as subdivisions of a [[manor]]. The later break-down of the feudal system did not detract from this, as the introduction of [[Justices of the Peace]] lead to [[petty sessions]] displacing many of the administrative and judicial functions of the manorial courts. By [[the Reformation]], [[Civil parishes in England|civil parishes]] had replaced the manor as the most important local administrative concept, and tithings came to be seen as a parish subdivision.

Frankpledge eventually evolved into both the [[Jury system]] and the [[parish constable|petty constabulary]], but tithings themselves had lost their practical significance, and fell into disuse. Despite this, active tithings continued to be found in some parts of rural England well into the 19th century, and tithings and hundreds have never been formally abolished.

{{Politics of Cuba}}

'''Vice Presidents of Cuba''', officially called from 1976 '''Vice President of the Council of State''', is the second highest [[political]] position obtainable in [[Council of State of Cuba]]. Currently there is a provision for several Vice Presidents, who are elected in the same manner as the [[President of Cuba]]. 

Historically, Vice President of Cuba was elected in the same ticket with the President. The position has been in use 1902&amp;ndash;1928, 1936, 1940&amp;ndash;1958, and since 1976.

'''Water scarcity''' or [[Physical water scarcity|lack of safe drinking water]] is one of the world's leading problems affecting more than 1.1 billion people globally, meaning that one in every six people lacks access to safe [[drinking water]].&lt;ref name=bpn&gt;{{cite web|title=The Facts About The Global Drinking Water Crisis|url=http://blueplanetnetwork.org/water/facts|year=2010|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] set up by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) and [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF) defines safe drinking water as "water with microbial, chemical and physical characteristics that meets WHO guidelines or national standards on drinking water quality." [[Hydrology|Hydrologists]] generally assess water scarcity by looking at a population-to-water equation that treats 1,700 cubic meters per person as the national threshold for meeting water requirements for agricultural and industrial production, energy, and the environment.&lt;ref name=HDR&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Scarcity, Risk, and Vulnerability|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDR_2006_Chapter_4.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Availability below the threshold of 1,000 cubic meters represents a state of "[[water scarcity]]", while anything below 500 cubic meters represents a state of "absolute scarcity".&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt;

As of 2006, one third of all nations suffered from clean water scarcity,&lt;ref name=uneca&gt;{{cite web|title=Management Options to Enhance Survival and Growth |url=http://www.uneca.org/awich/Water%20in%20Africa.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] had the largest number of water-stressed countries of any other place on the planet and of an estimated 800 million people who live in Africa, 300 million live in a water stressed environment.&lt;ref name="IaC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gisclimat.fr/manifestation-scientifique/conf%C3%A9rence-%E2%80%9Cwater-scarcity-africa-issues-and-challenges%E2%80%9D |title=Archive: Conference on Water Scarcity in Africa: Issues and Challenges |last= |first= |date= |website= |publisher= |accessdate=11 November 2016 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401234042/http://www.gisclimat.fr/manifestation-scientifique/conf%C3%A9rence-%E2%80%9Cwater-scarcity-africa-issues-and-challenges%E2%80%9D |archivedate= 1 April 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to findings presented at the 2012 Conference on "Water Scarcity in Africa: Issues and Challenges", it is estimated that by 2030, 75 million to 250 million people in Africa will be living in areas of high water stress, which will likely displace anywhere between 24 million and 700 million people as conditions become increasingly unlivable.&lt;ref name=IaC/&gt;

== Health ==
The most immediately apparent impact of water scarcity in Africa is on the continent's health. With a complete lack of water, humans can only live up to 3 to 5 days on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Water Page|url=http://www.thewaterpage.com/live-without-water.htm|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This often forces those living in water deprived regions to turn to unsafe water resources, which, according to the [[World Health Organization]], contributes to the spread of [[waterborne diseases]] including [[typhoid fever]], [[cholera]], [[dysentery]] and [[diarrhea]], and to the spread of diseases such as [[malaria]] whose [[vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] rely on such water resources, and can lead to diseases such as [[trachoma]], plague, and [[typhus]].&lt;ref name=WHO&gt;{{cite web|title=10 Facts About Water Scarcity|url=http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/water/en/|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, water scarcity causes many people to store water within the household, which increases the risk of household water contamination and incidents of malaria and dengue fever spread by mosquitoes.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; These waterborne diseases are not usually found in developed countries because of sophisticated [[water treatment]] systems that filter and chlorinate water, but for those living with less developed or non-existent water infrastructure, natural, untreated water sources often contain tiny disease-carrying worms and bacteria.&lt;ref name=WS&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Scarcity: The Importance of Water &amp; Access|url=http://thewaterproject.org/water_scarcity.asp|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of these waterborne sicknesses are treatable and preventable, they are nonetheless one of the leading causes of disease and death in the world. Globally, 2.2 million people die each year from diarrhea-related disease, and at any given time fifty percent of all hospital beds in the world are occupied by patients suffering from water-related diseases.&lt;ref name=bpn /&gt; Infants and children are especially susceptible to these diseases because of their young immune systems,&lt;ref name=WS/&gt; which lends to elevated [[infant mortality]] rates in many regions of Africa. Water scarcity has a big impact on hygiene.

When infected with these waterborne diseases, those living in African communities suffering from water scarcity cannot contribute to the community's productivity and development because of a simple lack of strength. Additionally, individual, community and governmental economic resources are sapped by the cost of medicine to treat waterborne diseases, which takes away from resources that might have potentially been allocated in support of food supply or school fees.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt; Also, in term of governmental funding, the [[Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council]] (WSSCC) estimates that in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], treatment of diarrhea due to [[Water pollution|water contamination]] consumes 12% of the country's health budget. With better water conditions, the burden on healthcare would be less substantial, while a healthier workforce&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rural Transformation in Tropical Africa|year=1988|publisher=Belhaven Press|location=Great Britain|author=Sandy Cairncross|editor=Douglas Rimmer|pages=49–54|chapter=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  would stimulate economic growth and help alleviate the prevalence of poverty.

=== Agriculture ===
The [[Human Development Report]] reports that human use of water is mainly allocated to irrigation and agriculture. In developing areas, such as those within Europe, agriculture accounts for more than 80% of water consumption.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; This is due to the fact that it takes about 3,500 liters of water to produce enough food for the daily minimum of 3,000 calories, and food production for a typical family of four takes a daily amount of water equivalent to the amount of water in an Olympic-sized swimming pool.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; Because the majority of Africa remains dependent on an agricultural lifestyle and 80% to 90% of all families in rural Africa rely upon producing their own food,&lt;ref name=WWD/&gt; water scarcity translates to a loss of [[food security]]. At this point, with less than a third of the continent's potential using irrigation most of the rural African communities are not tapping into their [[irrigation]] potential,&lt;ref name=WWD/&gt; and according to the UN Economic Commission for Africa and New Partnership for Africa's Development, "irrigation is key to achieving increased agricultural production that is important for economic development and for attaining food security".&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; The doubling of Africa's irrigated land is currently high on many political agendas, which can potentially be addressed through markets, commodity selection, ownership, [[land tenure]], reliable water storage, and [[Treaty|international agreements]].&lt;ref name=WWD/&gt;

But for many regions, there is a lack of financial and human resources to support infrastructure and technology required for proper crop irrigation. Because of this, the impact of droughts, floods, and [[desertification]] is greater in terms of both African economic loss and human life loss due to crop failure and starvation. Additionally, lack of water causes many Africans to use wastewater for crop growth, causing a large number of people to consume foods that can contain chemicals or disease-causing organisms transferred by the wastewater.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; Thus, for the extremely high number of African areas suffering from water scarcity issues, investing in development means sustainably withdrawing from clean freshwater sources, ensuring food security by expanding irrigation areas, and effectively managing the effects of [[climate change]].&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt;

==== Women ====
African women and men's divergent social positions lead to differences in water responsibilities, rights, and access,&lt;ref name=GRAW/&gt; and so African women are disproportionally burdened by the scarcity of clean drinking water. In most African societies, women are seen as the collectors, managers, and guardians of water, especially within the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] that includes household chores, cooking, washing, and child rearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Impacts of Water Scarcity on Women's Life|url=http://www.worldpulse.com/node/20165|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these traditional [[Gender role|gender labor roles]], women are forced to spend around sixty percent of each day collecting water, which translates to approximately 200 million collective work hours by women globally per day&lt;ref name=wac&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Affected by the Crisis|url=http://water.org/learn-about-the-water-crisis/women|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a decrease in the amount of time available for education. Water scarcity exacerbates this issue, as indicated by the correlation of decrease in access to water with a decrease in combined [[Primary education|primary]], [[Secondary education|secondary]], and [[Tertiary education|tertiary]] enrollment of women.&lt;ref name=GRAW&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender Relations and Access to Water: What We Want to Know About Social Relations and Women's Time Allocation|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0m5033gv#page-1|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For African women, their daily role in clean water retrieval often means carrying the typical [[jerrycan]] that can weigh over 40 pounds when full&lt;ref name=WS/&gt; for an average of six kilometers each day.&lt;ref name=bpn/&gt; This has health consequences such as permanent skeletal damage from carrying heavy loads of water over long distances each day,&lt;ref name=WWD&gt;{{cite web|title=Coping With Water Scarcity: Challenge of the 21st Century|url=http://www.fao.org/nr/water/docs/escarcity.pdf|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates to a physical strain that contributes to increased stress, increased time spent in health recovery, and decreased ability to not only physically attend educational facilities, but also mentally absorb education due to the effect of stress on decision-making and [[Effects of stress on memory|memory skills]]. Also, in terms of health, access to safe and clean drinking water leads to greater protection from water-borne illnesses which increases women's capabilities to attend school.&lt;ref name=GRAW/&gt;

The detriment water scarcity has on educational attainment for women, in turn, affects the social and economic capital of women in terms of leadership, earnings, and working opportunities.&lt;ref name=WWD/&gt; As a result of this, many women are unable to hold professional employment. The lost number of potential school days and education hinders the next generation of African women from breaking out of the cycle of unequal opportunity for gainful employment, which serves to perpetuate the prevalence of unequal opportunity for African women and adverse effects associated with lacking income from [[gainful employment]]. Thus, improved access to water influences women's allocation of time, level of education, and as a result their potential for higher wages associated with recognized and gainful employment.&lt;ref name=GRAW/&gt;

==== Children ====
In addition, the issue of water scarcity in Africa prevents many young children, especially girls, from attending school and receiving an education. They are expected to not only aid their mothers in water retrieval but to also help with the demands of household chores that are made more time-intensive because of a lack of readily available water. Furthermore, a lack of clean water means the absence of sanitary facilities and latrines in schools, and so once puberty hits, this has a more serious impact on female children. In terms of lost educational opportunity, it is estimated that this would result in 272 million more school attendance days per year if adequate investment were made in drinking water and sanitation.&lt;ref name=wac /&gt;

For parents, an increase in access to reliable water resources reduces vulnerability to shocks, which allows for increased livelihood security and for families to allocate a greater portion of their resources to care for their children. This means improved nutrition for children, a reduction in school days missed due to health issues, and greater flexibility to spend resources on providing for the direct costs associated with sending children to school. And if families escape [[forced migration]] due to water scarcity, children's educational potential is even further improved with better stability and uninterrupted school attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SEWA: Campaigning for Water, Women and Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=U5Kj_-4IvtsC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA93&amp;dq=how+water+scarcity+affects+women%27s+capabilities&amp;ots=NOgiYrcKEp&amp;sig=qLNvZ15DJ3OboqIQtBv-q1I6Igc#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Productivity and development ===
Poverty is directly related to the accessibility of clean drinking water- without it, the chances of breaking out of the [[poverty trap]] are extremely slim. This concept of a "water poverty trap" was developed by economists specifically observing sub-Saharan Africa and refers to a cycle of financial poverty, low agricultural production, and increasing environmental degradation.&lt;ref name=GRAW/&gt; In this negative feedback loop, this creates a link between the lack of water resources with the lack of financial resources that affect all societal levels including individual, household, and community.&lt;ref name=GRAW/&gt; Within this poverty trap, people are subjected to low incomes, high fixed costs of water supply facilities, and lack of credit for water investments, which results in a low level of investment in water and land resources, lack of investment in profit-generating activities, resource degradation, and [[chronic poverty]].&lt;ref name=GRAW/&gt;  Compounding on this, in the slums of developing countries, poor people typically pay five to ten times more per unit of water than do people with access to piped water because of issues – including the lack of infrastructure and [[Political corruption|government corruption]] – which is estimated to raise the prices of water services by 10% to 30%.&lt;ref name=WWD/&gt;&lt;ref name=21st&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa Rising 21st Century|url=http://africarising2010.blogspot.com/2010/02/africa-faces-water-war-threats.html|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

So, the social and economic consequences of a lack of clean water penetrate into realms of education, opportunities for gainful employment, physical strength and health, agricultural and industrial development, and thus the overall [[Productivity|productive potential]] of a community, nation, and/or region. Because of this, the UN estimates that Sub-Saharan Africa alone loses 40 billion potential work hours per year collecting water.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt;

=== Conflict ===
The explosion of populations in developing nations within Africa combined with climate change is causing extreme strain within and between nations. In the past, countries have worked to resolve water tensions through negotiation, but there is predicted to be an escalation in [[Water conflict|aggression over water accessibility]].

Africa's susceptibility to potential water-induced conflict can be separated into four regions: the [[Nile]], [[Niger river|Niger]], [[Zambezi]], and [[Volta river|Volta]] basins.&lt;ref name=21st/&gt; Running through [[Egypt]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Sudan]], the Nile's water has the potential to spark conflict and unrest.&lt;ref name=21st/&gt; In the region of the Niger, the river basin extends from [[Guinea]] through [[Mali]] and down to [[Nigeria]]. Especially for Mali – one of the world's poorest countries – the river is vital for food, water and transportation, and its over usage is contributing to an increasingly polluted and unusable water source.&lt;ref name=21st/&gt; In southern Africa, the Zambezi river basin is one of the world's most over-used river systems, and so [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]] compete fiercely over it. Additionally, in 2000, Zimbabwe caused the region to experience the worst flooding in recent history when the country opened the [[Kariba Dam]] gates.&lt;ref name=21st/&gt; Finally, within the Volta river basin, Ghana is dependent on its hydroelectric output but plagued by regular droughts which affect the production of electricity from the [[Akosombo Dam]] and limit Ghana's ability to sustain economic growth. Paired with the constraints this also puts on Ghana's ability to provide power for the area, this could potentially contribute to regional instability.&lt;ref name=21st/&gt;

At this point, federal intelligence agencies have issued the joint judgment that in the next ten years, water issues are not likely to cause internal and external tensions that lead to the intensification war. But if current rates of consumption paired with climatic stress continue, levels of water scarcity in Africa are predicted by UNECA to reach dangerously high levels by 2025. This means that by 2022 there is the potential for a shift in water scarcity's potential to contribute to armed conflict.&lt;ref name=usi&gt;{{cite web|title=US Intel: Water a Cause for War in Coming Decades|url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_20230354/us-intel-water-cause-war-coming-decades?IADID=Search-www.twincities.com-www.twincities.com|accessdate=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the classified [[National Intelligence Estimate]] on water security, requested by Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] and completed in Fall 2011, after 2022 water will be more likely to be used as a weapon of war and potential tool for terrorism, especially in [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name=usi/&gt; On [[World Water Day]], the [[State Department]] stated that water stress, "will likely increase the risk of instability and state failure, exacerbate regional tensions and distract countries from working with the United States on important policy objectives." Specifically referring to the [[Nile]] in Egypt, Sudan, and nations further south, the report predicts that upstream nations will limit access to water for political reasons and that terrorists may target water-related infrastructures, such as reservoirs and dams, more frequently.&lt;ref name=usi/&gt; Because of this, the [[World Economic Forum|World Economic Forum's]] 2011 Global Risk Report has included water as one of the world's top five risks for the first time.
Help the ones in need. think about the ones who are in need.

== Reasons for scarcity ==

=== Climate change ===
According to the Africa Partnership Forum, "Although Africa is the continent least responsible for [[climate change]], it is particularly vulnerable to the effects," and the long-term impacts include, "changing rainfall patterns affecting agriculture and reducing food security; worsening water security; decreasing fish resources in large lakes due to rising temperature; shifting vector-borne diseases; rising sea level affecting low-lying coastal areas with large populations; and rising water stress".&lt;ref name=cca&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and Africa|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/57/7/38897900.pdf|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, the Human Development Report predicts warming paired with 10% less rainfall in interior regions of Africa, which will be amplified by water loss due to water loss increase from rising temperature.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; This warming will be greatest over the semi-arid regions of the Sahara, along the [[Sahel]], and interior areas of southern Africa.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] reports that climate change in Africa has manifested itself in more intense and longer droughts in the [[subtropics]] and [[tropics]], while arid or semi-arid areas in northern, western, eastern, and parts of southern Africa are becoming drier and more susceptible to variability of precipitation and storms.&lt;ref name=cca/&gt;

The [[Human Development Report]] goes on to that explain that because of Africa's dependence on rain-fed agriculture, widespread poverty, and weak capacity, the water issues caused by climate change impact the continent much more violently compared to developed nations that have the resources and economic diversity to deal with such global changes. This heightened potential for drought and falling crop yields will most likely lead to increased poverty, lower incomes, less secure livelihoods, and an increased threat of chronic hunger for the poorest people in sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; Overall this means that water stress caused by changing amounts of precipitation is particularly damaging to Africa and thus climate change is one of the major obstacles the continent must face when trying to secure reliable and clean sources of water.

=== Physical scarcity and economic scarcity ===
Water scarcity is both a natural and human-made phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Decade for Action: Water for Life 2005-2015|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml|accessdate=18 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus essential to break it down into two general types: Economic scarcity and physical scarcity. Economic scarcity refers to the fact that finding a reliable source of safe water is time consuming and expensive. Alternatively, physical scarcity is when there simply is not enough water within a given region.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt;

[[File:Map showing Global Physical and Economic Water Scarcity 2006.gif|thumb|right|upright 2.0|Map showing Global Physical and Economic Water Scarcity 2006]]

The 2006 [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa]] estimates that 300 million out of the 800 million who live on the African continent live in a water-scarce environment.&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; Specifically in the very north of Africa, as well the very south of Africa, the rising global temperatures accompanying climate change have intensified the [[hydrological cycle]] that leads to drier dry seasons, thus increasing the risk of more extreme and frequent droughts. This significantly impacts the availability, quality and quantity of water due to reduced river flows and reservoir storage, lowering of water tables and drying up of aquifers in the northern and southern regions of Africa.

Included in the category of physical scarcity is the issue of [[overexploitation]]. This is contributing to the shrinking of many of Africa's great lakes, including the Nakivale, Nakuru, and [[Lake Chad]], which has shrunk to 10% of its former volume.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; In terms of policy, the incentives for overuse are among the most damaging, especially concerning ground water extraction. For ground water, once the pump is installed, the policy of many countries is to only constrain removal based on the cost of electricity, and in many cases subsidize electricity costs for agricultural uses, which damages incentives to conserve such resources.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt; Additionally, many countries within Africa set the cost of water well below cost-recovery levels, thus discouraging efficient usage and threatening sustainability.&lt;ref name=HDR/&gt;

The majority of Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from economic scarcity because of the population's lack of the necessary monetary means to utilize adequate sources of water. Both political reasons and ethnic conflict have contributed to this unequal distribution of resources. Out of the two forms of water scarcity, economic scarcity can be addressed quickly and effectively with simple infrastructure to collect rainwater from roofs and dams, but this requires economic resources that many of these areas lack due to an absence of industrial development and widespread poverty.&lt;ref name=WS/&gt;

=== Regional variance ===
Northern Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa are progressing towards the Millennium Development Goal on water at different paces. While Northern Africa has 92% safe water coverage, Sub-Saharan Africa remains at a low 60% of coverage – leaving 40% of the 783 million people in that region without access to clean drinking water.&lt;ref name=WFL&gt;{{cite web|title=International Decade for Action: Water for Life 2005-2015|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/africa.shtml|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these differences in clean water availability can be attributed to Africa's extreme climates. Although Sub-Saharan Africa has a plentiful supply of rainwater, it is seasonal and unevenly distributed, leading to frequent floods and droughts.&lt;ref name=WFL/&gt; Additionally, prevalent economic development and poverty issues, compounded with rapid population growth and rural-urban migration have rendered Sub-Saharan Africa as the world's poorest and least developed region.&lt;ref name=WFL/&gt; Thus, this poverty constrains many cities in this region from providing clean water and sanitation services and preventing the further deterioration of water quality even when opportunities exist to address these water issues.&lt;ref name=WFL/&gt; Additionally, the rapid population growth leads to an increased number of African settlements on flood-prone, high-risk land.&lt;ref name=WFL/&gt;

To adequately address the issue of water scarcity in Africa, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa emphasizes the need to invest in the development of Africa's potential water resources to reduce unnecessary suffering, ensure [[food security]], and protect economic gains by effectively managing droughts, floods, and [[desertification]].&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; Some suggested and ongoing efforts to achieve this include an emphasis on infrastructural implementations and improvements of wells, rainwater catchment systems, and clean-water storage tanks.

Efforts made by the United Nations in compliance with the [[Millennium Development Goals]] have targeted water scarcity not just for Africa, but globally. The compiled list includes eight international development goals, seven of which are directly impacted by water scarcity. Access to water affects poverty, food scarcity, educational attainment, social and economic capital of women, livelihood security, disease, and human and environmental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Decade for Action Water for Life 2005-2015: Water Scarcity|url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because addressing the issue of water is so integral to reaching the MDGs, one of the sub-goals includes halving the proportion of the globe's population without sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015. In March 2012, the UN announced that this goal has been met almost four years in advance, suggesting that global efforts to reduce water scarcity are on a successful trend.&lt;ref name=remarks&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks in Honor of World Water Day|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2012/03/186640.htm|accessdate=1 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], the United States plays an integral role in promoting solutions to aid with clean water scarcity. One of many efforts include [[USAID|USAID's]] [[WASH]]- the WASH for Life partnership with the Gates Foundation- that works to promote water, sanitation, and hygiene. With this, the U.S. "will identify, test, and scale up evidence-based approaches for delivering these services to people in some of the poorest regions".&lt;ref name=remarks/&gt; Additionally, in March 2012, Hillary Clinton announced the U.S. Water Partnership, which will bring together people from the private sector, the philanthropic community, non-governmental organizations, academics, experts, and the government in an attempt to look for system-wide solutions.&lt;ref name=remarks/&gt; The technologies and ability to tackle the issue of water scarcity and cleanliness are present, but it is highly a matter of accessibility. Thus, the partnership will aim at making these solutions available and obtainable at a local level.

In addition to the role the United States, the United Nations, and other international governmental bodies, a number of charitable organizations work to provide clean water in Africa and elsewhere around the world. These charities are based on individual and group donations, which are then invested in a variety of methods and technologies to provide clean water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Charities:A Comprehensive List|url=http://www.filtersfast.com/articles/Water-Charities-A-Comprehensive-List.php|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solutions and technologies ===
The more basic solutions to help provide Africa with drinkable and usable water include well-digging, rain catchment systems, de-worming pills, and hand pumps, but high demand for clean water solutions has also prompted the development of some key creative solutions as well.

Some non-profit organizations have focused on the aspect of drinking water contamination from [[sewage]] waste by installing cost-effective and relatively maintenance-free toilets, such as Drop In The Bucket's "Eco-sanitation Flush Toilet"&lt;ref name=Drop&gt;{{cite web|title=A Drop In The Bucket|url=http://www.dropinthebucket.org/about|accessdate=11 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Pump Aid]]'s "Elephant Toilet".&lt;ref name=PA&gt;{{cite web|title=Pump Aid-Water For Life|url=http://pumpaid.org/|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Elephant Toilet uses community-sourced resources in construction to build a relatively simple waste disposal mechanism that separates solids from liquids to promote faster decomposition and lower the impact on ground water.&lt;ref name=PA/&gt; In comparison, the Eco-Sanitation Flush Toilet also uses no power of any kind, but actually treats sewage rather than just storing it so that the toilet's output is only water.&lt;ref name=Drop/&gt; Both solutions are then simple for residents of African communities to maintain and have a notable impact on the cleanliness of local water sources.

Other solutions to clean water scarcity issues have focused on innovative pump systems, including hand-pumps, Water for People's "[[Roundabout PlayPump|Play Pumps]]",&lt;ref name=WFP&gt;{{cite web|title=Water For People|url=http://www.waterforpeople.org/|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pump Aid's "Elephant Pumps".&lt;ref name=PA/&gt; All three designs are built to aid communities in drawing clean water from wells. The hand pump is the most basic and simple to repair, with replacement parts easily found.&lt;ref name=LWI&gt;{{cite web|title=Living Water International|url=https://www.water.cc/|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using a more creative approach, Play Pumps combine child's play with clean water extraction through the use of playground equipment, called a roundabout. The idea behind this is as children play on the roundabout, water will simultaneously be pumped from a reservoir tank to either toilets, hand-washing stations, or for drinking water.&lt;ref name=PA/&gt; Some downsides to the PlayPump, though, are its inability to address situations of physical water scarcity and the danger of exploitation when children's play is equated with pumping water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Play Pump: What Went Wrong?|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/07/01/the-playpump-what-went-wrong/|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, Elephant Pumps are simple hand water pumps. After a well is prepared, a rope-pump mechanism is installed that is easy to maintain, uses locally sourced parts, and can be up and running in the time span of about a week.&lt;ref name=PA/&gt; The Elephant Pump can provide 250 people with 40 litres of clean water per person per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elephant Pump|url=http://www.theafricatrust.org/elephant_pump.html|accessdate=1 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moving beyond sanitary waste disposal and pumps, clean water technology can now be found in the form of drinking straw filtration. Used as solution by Water Is Life, the straw is small, portable, and costs USD$10 per unit.&lt;ref name=WIL&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Is Life|url=http://waterislife.com/|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The filtration device is designed to eliminate waterborne diseases, and as a result, provide safe drinking water for one person for one year.&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;

Overall, a wide range of cost-effective, manageable, and innovative solutions are available to help aid Africa in producing clean, disease-free water. Ultimately what it comes down to is using [[Appropriate Technology|technology appropriate]] for each individual community's needs. For the technology to be effective, it must conform to environmental, ethical, cultural, social, and economic aspects of each Africa community.&lt;ref name=LI&gt;{{cite web|title=Lifewater International|url=http://www.lifewater.org/|accessdate=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, state governments, donor agencies, and technological solutions must be mindful of the gender disparity in access to water so as to not exclude women from development or resource management projects.&lt;ref name=GRAW/&gt; If this can be done, with sufficient funding and aid to implement such technologies, it is feasible to eliminate clean water scarcity for the African continent by the [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal]] deadline of 2015.

=== Limitations ===
Africa is home to both the largest number of water-scarce countries out of any region, as well as home to the most difficult countries to reach in terms of water aid. The prevalence of rural villages traps many areas in what the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Africa|UN Economic Commission for Africa]] refers to as the "Harvesting Stage",&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; which makes water-scarce regions difficult to aid because of a lack of industrial technology to make solutions sustainable. In addition to the geographic and developmental limiting factors, a number of political, economic reasons also stand in the way of ensuring adequate aid for Africa. Politically, tensions between local governments versus foreign non-governmental organizations impact the ability to successfully bring in money and aid-workers. Economically, urban areas suffer from extreme [[Economic inequality|wealth gaps]] in which the overwhelming poor often pay four to ten times more for sanitary water than the elite, hindering the poor from gaining access to clean water technologies and efforts.&lt;ref name=uneca /&gt; As a result of all these factors, it is estimated that fifty percent of all water projects fail, less than five percent of projects are visited, and less than one percent have any long term monitoring.&lt;ref name=wac /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1428">The '''Western Regional Advocacy Project''' ('''WRAP''') is a US West Coast alliance of grassroots homeless people's organizations that advocates for changes to Federal housing policy, and for an end to local and state policies that it considers to violate the civil rights of homeless people.

Its member organizations are:
* [[Building Opportunities for Self-Sufficiency]] (BOSS) ([[Berkeley, California]]) (formerly Berkeley Oakland Support Services, the current name being a [[backronym]])
* [[Coalition on Homelessness, San Francisco]] (San Francisco, California)
* Los Angeles Community Action Network (Los Angeles, California)
* Sisters Of The Road (Portland, Oregon)
* [[Street Roots]] (Portland, Oregon)
* Street Spirit (Oakland and Berkeley, California)
* Denver Homeless Out Loud (Denver, Colorado)

WRAP is best recognized for its publication ''Without Housing: Decades of Federal Housing Cutbacks, Massive Homelessness, and Policy Failures'', which details Federal housing policy immediately prior to, and in the decades since, the advent of modern mass homelessness. The report was initially published in 2006, with an update in 2010.
