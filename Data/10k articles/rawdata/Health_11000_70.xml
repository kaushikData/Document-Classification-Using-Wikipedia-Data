'''12-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid''' ('''12-HETE''') is a derivative of the 20 carbon [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]], [[arachidonic acid]], containing a [[Hydroxyl]] residue at carbon 12 and a 5''Z'',''8Z'',10''E'',14''Z'' [[Cis–trans isomerism]] configuration (Z=cis, E=trans) in its four double bonds.  It was first found as a product of [[arachidonic acid]] metabolism made by human and bovine platelets through their 12''S''-[[lipoxygenase]] (i.e. [[ALOX12]]) enzyme(s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 4215079 | pmc = 433780 | year = 1974 | author1 = Hamberg | first1 = M | title = Prostaglandin endoperoxides.

The two isomers, either directly or after being further metabolized, have been suggested to be involved in a variety of human physiological and pathological reactions.  Unlike [[hormones]] which are secreted by cells, travel in the circulation to alter the behavior of distant cells, and thereby act as [[Endocrine signalling]] agents, these arachidonic acid metabolites act locally as [[Autocrine signalling]] and/or [[Paracrine signaling]] agents to regulate the behavior of their cells of origin or of nearby cells, respectively. In these roles, they may amplify or dampen, expand or contract cellular and tissue responses to disturbances.

== Production ==

In humans, [[Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase]] (12-LO, 12-LOX, ALO12, or platelet type 12-lipoxygenase) is encoded by the [[ALOX12]] gene and expressed primarily in platelets and skin.  ALOX12 metabolizes [[arachidonic acid]] almost exclusively to 12(''S'')-hydroperoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',10''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (12(''S'')-HpETE or 12''S''-HpETE).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 12432922 | year = 2002 | author1 = Yoshimoto | first1 = T | title = Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenases | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 68–69 | pages = 245–62 | last2 = Takahashi | first2 = Y | doi=10.1016/s0090-6980(02)00034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase]]-1 (15-LO-1, 15-LOX-1, ALOX15), which is expressed in far more tissues that ALOX12, metabolizes arachidonic acid primarily to 15(''S'')-HpETE along with other metabolites of the [[15-Hydroxyicosatetraenoic acid]] family; during this metabolism, however, ALOX15 also forms 12(''S'')-HpETE as a minor product.&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2010"/&gt;  Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase, 12R type, also termed 12RLOX and encoded by the [[ALOX12B]] gene, is expressed primarily in skin and cornea; it metabolizes arachidonic acid to 12(''R'')-HpETE.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 8443245 | year = 1993 | author1 = Oliw | first1 = E.

Sub-primate mammals, such as the mouse, rat, rabbit, cow, and pig, express platelet type 12-lipoxygenase but also a leukocyte type 12-lipoxygenase (also termed 12/15-lipoxygenase, 12/15-LOX or 12/15-LO) which is an [[ortholog]] of, and metabolically equivalent to, human 15-LO-1 in that it forms predominantly 15(''S'')-HpETE with 12(''S'')-HpETE as a minor product.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18258795 | year = 2008 | author1 = Collins | first1 = J.

Sub-human primates, although not extensively examined, appear to have 12-lipoxygenase expression patterns that resemble those of sub-primate mammals or humans depending on the closeness of there genetic relateness to these species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20106647 | year = 2010 | author1 = Johannesson | first1 = M | title = Cloning, purification and characterization of non-human primate 12/15-lipoxygenases | journal = Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids | volume = 82 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 121–9 | last2 = Backman | first2 = L | last3 = Claesson | first3 = H.

== Further metabolism ==

In human (and mouse) skin epidermis, 12(''R'')-HpETE is metabolized by Epidermis-type lipoxygenase, i.e. eLOX3 (encoded by the [[ALOXE3]] gene), to two products: a) a specific [[hepoxilin]], 8''R''-hydroxy-11''R'',12''R''-epoxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (i.e. 8''R''-hydroxy,11''R'',12''R''-epoxy-hepoxilin A3 or 8''R''-OH,11''R'',12''R''-epoxy-hepoxilin A3) and b) 12-oxo-5''Z'',''8Z'',10''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid (12-oxo-HETE, 12-oxoETE, 12-Keto-ETE, or 12-KETE); 8''R''-hydroxy,11''R'',12''R''-epoxy-hepoxilin A3 is further metabolized by soluble [[Epoxide hydrolase 2]] (sEH) to 8''R'',11''R'',12''R''-trihydroxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid.&lt;ref name="J Biol Chem p 21"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 17652088 | year = 2007 | author1 = Valmsen | first1 = K | title = A critical role of non-active site residues on cyclooxygenase helices 5 and 6 in the control of prostaglandin stereochemistry at carbon 15 | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 282 | issue = 38 | pages = 28157–63 | last2 = Boeglin | first2 = W.

Recent studies indicate that the metabolism by [[ALOXE3]] of the ''R'' stereoisomer of 12-HpETE made by [[ALOX12B]] and therefore possibly the ''S'' stereoisomer of 12-HpETE made by ALOX12 or ALOX15 is responsible for forming various hepoxilins in the epidermis of human and mouse skin and tongue and possibly other tissues.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2013. p 7"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24021977 | pmc = 4116325 | year = 2014 | author1 = Muñoz-Garcia | first1 = A | title = The importance of the lipoxygenase-hepoxilin pathway in the mammalian epidermal barrier | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Molecular and Cell Biology of Lipids | volume = 1841 | issue = 3 | pages = 401–8 | last2 = Thomas | first2 = C.

Human skin metabolizes 12(''S'')-HpETE in reactions strictly analogous to those of 12(''R'')-HpETE; it metabolized 12(''S'')-HpETE by eLOX3 to 8''R''-hydroxy-11''S'',12''S''-epoxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid and 12-oxo-ETE, with the former product then being metabolized by sEH to 8''R'',11''S'',12''S''-trihydroxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid.  12(''S'')-HpETE also spontaneously decomposes to a mixture of hepoxilins and trihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (trioxillins) that possess ''R'' or ''S'' hydroxy and ''R'',''S'' or ''S'',''R'' [[epoxide]] residues at various sites while 8''R''-hydroxy,11''S'',12''S''-epoxy-hepoxilin A3 spontaneously decomposes to 8''R'',11''S'',12''S''-trihydroxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid.&lt;ref name="J Biol Chem p 21"/&gt;

In other tissues and animal species, numerous hepoxilins form but the hepoxilin synthase activity responsible for their formation is variable.  (Hepoxilin A3 [8''R/S''-hydroxy-11,12-epoxy-5''Z'',9''E'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid] and hepoxilin B3 [10(''R/S''-hydroxy-11,12-epxoy-5''Z'',8''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatrienoic acid] refer to a mixture of [[Diastereomers]] and⁄or [[Enantiomers]] derived from arachidonic acid.&lt;ref name="Pathophysiology of the hepoxilins"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2013. p 7"/&gt;)  Cultured RINm5F rat [[Insulinoma]] cells convert 12(''S'')-HpETE to hepoxilin A3 in a reaction that is completely dependent on, and co-localizes with, the cells' leukocyte type 12-LOX; furthermore, recombinant rat and porcine leukocyte type 12-LOX as well as human platelet type 12-LOX metabolize 12(''S'')-HpETE to hepoxylin A3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 15123652 | year = 2004 | author1 = Nigam | first1 = S | title = The rat leukocyte-type 12-lipoxygenase exhibits an intrinsic hepoxilin A3 synthase activity | journal = Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 279 | issue = 28 | pages = 29023–30 | last2 = Patabhiraman | first2 = S | last3 = Ciccoli | first3 = R | last4 = Ishdorj | first4 = G | last5 = Schwarz | first5 = K | last6 = Petrucev | first6 = B | last7 = Kühn | first7 = H | last8 = Haeggström | first8 = J.

The majority of reports on hepoxilin formation have not defined the pathways evolved.

'''Alveoloplasty''' is a dental pre-prosthetic procedure performed to smoothen or reshape the jawbone.  In this procedure, the bony edges of the [[alveolar ridge]] and its surrounding structures is made smooth, redesigned or recontoured so that a well-fitting, comfortable, and esthetic [[dental prosthesis]] may be fabricated. This pre-prosthetic surgery prepares the mouth to receive a dental prosthesis.&lt;ref&gt;Pre-prosthetic surgery: Mandible Veeramalai Naidu Devaki ; Kandasamy Balu ; Sadashiva Balakrishnapillai Ramesh ; Ramraj Jayabalan Arvind ; Venkatesan Journal of Pharmacy and Bioallied Sciences, 01 January 2012, Vol.4(6), pp.414-416[Peer&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[dental extraction|tooth extraction]], the residual crest irregularities, undercuts or bone spicules should be removed, because they may result in an obstruction in placing a prosthetic restorative appliance. Recontouring can be made at the time of extraction or at a later time.

==Clinical procedure==
The simplest form of alveoloplasty can be in the form of a digital compression on the lateral walls of bone after simple tooth extraction, provided that there are no gross bone irregularities. When more irregularities exist, other techniques can be adopted, such as the conservative technique, interseptal ( Dean's) alveoloplasty, Obwegeser's modification of interseptal, alveoloplasty after post extraction and the alveoloplasty performed on edentulous ridges.&lt;ref&gt;Textbook of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery By Rajiv M Borle&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Contemporary Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery - E-Book By James R. Hupp, Myron R. Tucker, Edward Ellis&lt;/ref&gt;

A full thickness flap is usually elevated to a point apical to the desired area to be contoured, and according to the amount of bone needed to be removed, a bone file, or a bone [[rongeur]], or a [[Burr (cutter)|burr]] under copious irrigation can be used to provide the desired contour. Taking in consideration that lack of irrigation can lead to bone necrosis. When finished, the flap is repositioned and sutured. The [[Oral mucosa|alveolar mucosa]] covering bone should have uniform thickness, density and compressibility to evenly distribute the masticatory forces to the underlying bone.

The '''Bates method''' is an [[alternative medicine|alternative therapy]] aimed at improving [[visual acuity|eyesight]]. Eye-care physician [[William Bates (physician)|William Horatio Bates]], M.D. (1860–1931) attributed nearly all sight problems to [[Habit (psychology)|habitual]] strain of the eyes, and felt that [[glasses]] were harmful and never necessary. Bates self-published a book, ''[[s:Perfect Sight Without Glasses|Perfect Sight Without Glasses]]'', as well as a magazine, ''[[s:Better Eyesight Magazine|Better Eyesight Magazine]]'', (and earlier collaborated with [[Bernarr MacFadden]] on a correspondence course) detailing his approach to helping people relax such "strain", and thus, he claimed, improve their sight. His techniques centered on visualization and movement. He placed particular emphasis on imagining [[black]] letters and marks, and the movement of such. He also felt that exposing the eyes to sunlight would help alleviate the "strain".&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;{{cite book |last = Gardner |first = Martin |title = [[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] |year = 1957 |chapter = Chapter 19: Throw Away Your Glasses! |pages = 230–41 |publisher = [[Courier Dover Publications]] |isbn = 0486203948 |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=TwP3SGAUsnkC&amp;pg=PA232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite continued [[anecdotal]] reports of successful results, including well-publicised support by [[Aldous Huxley]], Bates' techniques have not been [[Objectivity (science)|objectively]] shown to improve eyesight.&lt;ref name=WebMD&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.webmd.com/eye-health/features/natural-vision-correction-does-it-work |title = Natural Vision Correction: Does It Work? |first = Leanna |last = Skarnulis |publisher = [[WebMD]] |date = 5 February 2007 |accessdate = 14 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main [[physiological]] proposition—that the eyeball changes shape to maintain [[Focus (optics)|focus]]—has consistently been contradicted by observation.&lt;ref name="pollack"&gt;{{cite book |last = Pollack |first = Philip |title = The Truth about Eye Exercises |location = Philadelphia |publisher = [[Chilton Company]] |year = 1956 |chapter = Chapter 3: Fallacies of the Bates System |chapterurl = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4399673;view=1up;seq=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, optometry professor [[Elwin Marg]] wrote of Bates, "Most of his claims and almost all of his theories have been considered false by practically all visual scientists."&lt;ref name="Chou"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Review of Optometry |url = http://www.revoptom.com/content/d/therapeutics/c/17353/ |title = Exposing the Secrets of Fringe Eye Care |first = Brian |last = Chou |volume = 141 |number = 9 |date = 15 September 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Marg concluded that the Bates method owed its popularity largely to "flashes of clear vision" experienced by many who followed it.&lt;ref name=Marg&gt;{{cite journal |last = Marg |first = Elwin |title = Flashes of clear vision and negative accommodation with reference to the Bates Method of visual training |journal = American Journal of Optometry &amp; Archives of American Academy of Optometry |date = April 1952 |volume = 29 |issue = 4 |pages = 167–84 |doi = 10.1097/00006324-195204000-00001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such occurrences have since been explained as a [[contact lens]]-like effect of moisture on the eye,&lt;ref name="AAO" /&gt; or a flattening of the lens by the ciliary muscles.&lt;ref name="Raz2004a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Raz2004b" /&gt;

The Bates method has been criticized not only because there is no good evidence it works, but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by not wearing their corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.&lt;ref name="Chou" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grierson"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Eye Book: Eyes and Eye Problems Explained |first = Ian |last = Grierson |publisher = [[Liverpool University Press]] |year = 2000 |chapter = Exercises for Eyes as an Alternative to Glasses |pages = 58–60 |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=YY0inTk-CEcC&amp;pg=PA58 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying concepts ==

=== Accommodation ===

[[Accommodation (eye)|Accommodation]] is the process by which the eye increases [[optical power]] to maintain [[focus (optics)|focus]] on the [[retina]] while shifting its gaze to a closer point. The long-standing medical consensus is that this is accomplished by action of the [[ciliary muscle]], a muscle ''within'' the eye, which adjusts the curvature of the eye's [[lens (anatomy)|crystalline lens]].&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt; This explanation is based in the observed effect of [[atropine]] temporarily preventing accommodation when applied to the ciliary muscle, as well as images reflected on the crystalline lens becoming smaller as the eye shifts focus to a closer point, indicating a change in the lens' shape. Bates rejected this explanation, and in his 1920 book presented photographs that he said showed that the image remained the same size even as the eye shifted focus, concluding from this that the lens was not a factor in accommodation. However, optometrist Philip Pollack in a 1956 work characterized these photographs as "so blurred that it is impossible to tell whether one image is larger than the other", in contrast to [[Timeline of photography technology|later photographs]] that clearly showed a change in the size of the reflected images, just as had been observed since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;

Bates adhered to a different explanation of accommodation that had already been generally disregarded by the medical community of his time. Bates' model had the [[extraocular muscles|muscles ''surrounding'' the eyeball]] controlling its focus.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; In addition to their known function of turning the eye, Bates maintained, they also affect its shape,&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,884800,00.html |title = Exercise v. Eyeglasses |work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date = 15 March 1943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; elongating the eyeball to focus at the near-point or shortening it to focus at a distance.&lt;ref name="BatesChap4"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 4: The Truth About Accommodation as Demonstrated by Experiments on the Eye Muscles of Fish, Cats, Dogs, Rabbits and other Animals |pages = 38–53 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA38 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on this hypothesis in an interview with [[WebMD]], ophthalmologist Richard E. Bensinger stated "When we put drops in the eye to dilate the pupil, they paralyze the focusing muscles. The evidence of the anatomical fallacy is that you can't focus, but your eye can move up and down, left and right. The notion that external muscles affect focusing is totally wrong."&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt; Science author [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]] writes that many animals, such as fishes, accommodate by elongation of the eyeball, "it's just that humans aren't one of those animals."&lt;ref name=Grant&gt;{{cite book |first = John |last = Grant |title = Discarded Science |year = 2006 |publisher = FFF |location = Surrey, UK |isbn = 1904332498 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laboratory tests have shown that the human eyeball is far too rigid to spontaneously change shape to a degree that would be necessary to accomplish what Bates described.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 [[micrometre]]s) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 [[dioptre]]s.&lt;ref name=Drexler&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science |date = 1 October 1998 |volume = 39 |issue = 11 |pages = 2140–47 |title = Eye elongation during accommodation in humans: differences between emmetropes and myopes |last = Drexler |first = W |last2 = Findl |first2 = O |last3 = Schmetterer |first3 = L |last4 = Hitzenberger |first4 = CK |last5 = Fercher |first5 = AF |url = http://www.iovs.org/cgi/reprint/39/11/2140 |pmid = 9761293 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Causes of sight problems ===

Medical professionals characterize [[refractive errors]] such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, astigmatism, and [[presbyopia]] (the age-related blurring of near-point vision) as consequences of the eye's shape and other basic anatomy, which there is no evidence that any exercise can alter.&lt;ref name=AllAboutVision /&gt; Bates, however, believed that these conditions are caused by tension of the muscles surrounding the eyeball, which he believed prevents the eyeball from sufficiently changing shape (per his explanation of accommodation) when gaze is shifted nearer or farther. Bates characterized this supposed muscular tension as the consequence of a "mental strain" to see, the relief of which he claimed would instantly improve sight.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BatesChap9"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 9: The Cause and Cure of Errors of Refraction |pages = 89–105 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA89 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also linked disturbances in the [[circulatory system|circulation]] of blood, which he said is "very largely influenced by thought", not only to refractive errors but also to [[diplopia|double vision]], [[strabismus|crossed-eye]], [[amblyopia|lazy eye]], and to more serious eye conditions such as [[cataract]]s and [[glaucoma]].&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BatesChap10"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 10: Strain |pages = 106–13 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA106 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His therapies were based on these assumptions.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

Bates felt that [[corrective lenses]], which he characterized as "eye crutches", are an impediment to curing poor vision. In his view, "strain" would increase as the eyes adjust to the correction in front of them. He thus recommended that [[glasses]] be discarded by anyone applying his method.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

== Treatments ==

In his writings, Bates discussed several techniques that he claimed helped patients to improve their sight. He wrote "The ways in which people strain to see are infinite, and the methods used to relieve the strain must be almost equally varied,"&lt;ref name="BatesChap9" /&gt; emphasizing that no single approach would work for everyone. His techniques were all designed to help disassociate this "strain" from seeing and thereby achieve "central fixation", or seeing what is in the central point of vision without staring. He asserted that "all errors of refraction and all functional disturbances of the eye disappear when it sees by central fixation" and that other conditions were often relieved as well.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

=== Palming ===
[[File:Batespalming.png|thumb|Photo of someone "palming", from ''Perfect Sight Without Glasses''.]]

Bates suggested closing the eyes for minutes at a time to help bring about relaxation.&lt;ref name="BatesChap12" /&gt; He asserted that the relaxation could be deepened in most cases by "palming", or covering the closed eyes with the palms of the hands, without putting pressure on the eyeballs.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; If the covered eyes did not strain, he said, they would see "a field so black that it is impossible to remember, imagine, or see anything blacker", since light was excluded by the palms. However, he reported that some of his patients experienced "illusions of lights and colors" sometimes amounting to "kaleidoscopic appearances" as they "palmed", occurrences he attributed to his ubiquitous "strain" and that he claimed disappeared when one truly relaxed.&lt;ref name="BatesChap12"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 12: Palming |pages = 123–35 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA123 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon, however, was almost certainly caused by [[Eigengrau]] or "dark light". In fact, even in conditions of perfect darkness, as inside a cave, neurons at every level of the [[visual system]] produce random background activity that is interpreted by the brain as patterns of light and color.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;

=== Visualization ===

Bates placed importance on [[mental image]]s, as he felt relaxation was the key to clarity of imagination as well as of actual sight.&lt;ref name="Biomed"&gt;{{cite book |title = Ethics in Biomedical Research: International Perspectives |first = Frank J. |last = Leavitt |publisher = [[Rodopi Publishers|Rodopi]] |year = 2007 |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=-Tr7WZd_GwQC&amp;pg=PA203&amp;vq=Bates&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1&amp;sig=ACfU3U0N8ztV_WZnlDRcO3L3J6GH140ceA |chapter = How to Save the World: Alternatives to Biomedical Research |pages = 203–07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that one's poise could be gauged by the visual memory of black; that the darker it appeared in the mind, and the smaller the area of black that could be imagined, the more relaxed one was at the moment.&lt;ref name="BatesChap13" /&gt; He recommended that patients think of the top letter from an [[Snellen chart|eye chart]] and then visualize progressively smaller black letters, and eventually a period or comma.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; But he emphasized his view that the clear visual memory of black "cannot be attained by any sort of effort", stating that "the memory is not the cause of the relaxation, but must be preceded by it,"&lt;ref name="BatesChap13"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 13: Memory as an Aid to Vision |pages = 136–47 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA136 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and cautioned against "concentrating" on black, as he regarded an attempt to "think of one thing only" as a strain.&lt;ref name="BatesChap12" /&gt;

While Bates preferred to have patients imagine something black, he also reported that some found objects of other colors easiest to visualize, and thus were benefited most by remembering those, because, he asserted, "the memory can never be perfect unless it is easy."&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BatesChap13" /&gt; Skeptics reason that the only benefit to eyesight gained from such techniques is ''itself'' imagined, and point out that familiar objects, including letters on an eye chart, can be recognized even when they appear less than clear.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;

=== Movement ===

He thought that the manner of eye movement affected the sight. He suggested "shifting", or moving the eyes back and forth to get an illusion of objects "swinging" in the opposite direction. He believed that the smaller the area over which the "swing" was experienced, the greater was the benefit to sight. He also indicated that it was usually helpful to close the eyes and ''imagine'' something "swinging". By alternating actual and mental shifting over an image, Bates wrote, many patients were quickly able to shorten the "shift" to a point where they could "conceive and swing a letter the size of a period in a newspaper".&lt;ref name="BatesChap15"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 15: Shifting and Swinging |pages = 159–71 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA159 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One who mastered this would attain the "universal swing", Bates believed.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

Perhaps finding Bates' concepts of "shifting" and "swinging" too complicated, some proponents of vision improvement, such as [[Bernarr Macfadden]], suggested simply moving the eyes up and down, from side to side, and shifting one's gaze between a near-point and a far-point.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;

=== Sunning ===

[[File:BurningGlass.png|thumb|A [[burning-glass]] being used to focus sunlight on someone's eye, from ''Perfect Sight Without Glasses''.]]

Bates believed that the eyes were benefited by exposure to sunlight. He stated that "persons with normal sight can look directly at the sun, or at the strongest artificial light, without injury or discomfort,"&lt;ref name="Sungazing"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Better Eyesight |first = William H. |last = Bates |title = [[s:Better Eyesight Magazine/June 1920#SUN-GAZING|Sun-gazing]] |date = June 1920 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co }}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave several examples of patients' vision purportedly improving after [[sungazing]]{{snd}}this is at variance with the well-known risk of [[Solar retinopathy|eye damage]] that can result from [[Watch sun directly|direct sunlight observation]].&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chou" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grierson"/&gt;

Bates said that, just as one should not attempt to run a marathon without training, one should not immediately look ''directly'' at the sun, but he suggested that it could be worked up to. He acknowledged that looking at the sun could have ill effects, but characterized them as being "always temporary" and in fact the effects of strain in ''response'' to sunlight. He wrote that he had cured people who believed that the sun had caused them permanent eye damage.&lt;ref name="BatesChap17"&gt;{{cite book |last = Bates |first = William H. |title = Perfect Sight Without Glasses |year = 1920 |chapter = Chapter 17: Vision Under Adverse Conditions a Benefit to the Eyes |pages = 183–97 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vl3SiyXmZVMC&amp;pg=PA183 |isbn = 8890075635 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his magazine, Bates later suggested exposing only the white part of the eyeball to direct sunlight, and only for seconds at a time, after allowing the sun to shine on closed eyelids for a longer period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Better Eyesight |first = William H. |last = Bates |title = The Use of the Sun Glass |date = July 1929 |location = New York |publisher = Central Fixation Publishing Co |url = http://www.central-fixation.com/better-eyesight-magazine/better-eyesight-1929-07.php#sun-glass }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Posthumous publications of Bates' book omitted mention of the supposed benefits from direct sunlight shining on open eyes.&lt;ref name="Marg" /&gt;

== Results and criticism ==

Bates' techniques have never been scientifically established to improve eyesight.&lt;ref name=WebMD /&gt; Several of Bates' techniques, including "sunning", "swinging", and "palming", were combined with healthy changes to diet and exercise in a 1983 [[randomized controlled trial]] of myopic children in India. After 6 months, the experimental groups "did not show any statistically significant difference in refractive status", though the children in the treatment group "[[subjectivity|subjectively]] … felt relieved of eye strain and other symptoms".&lt;ref name = Mohan&gt;{{cite journal |first = Madan |last = Mohan |title = Therapy of myopia |journal = Indian Journal of Ophthalmology |year = 1983 |volume = 31 |pages = 741–43 |url = http://www.ijo.in/text.asp?1983/31/6/741/29315 |issue = 6 |pmid = 6676257 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 the [[British Medical Journal]] observed that "Bates […] advocated prolonged sun-gazing as the
treatment of myopia, with disastrous results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1136/bmj.3.5559.212 |title = Solar retinopathy |year = 1967 |last1 = Ridgway |first1 = A. E. |journal = [[British Medical Journal]] |volume = 3 |issue = 5559 |pages = 212–14 |pmid = 6028468 |pmc = 1842517 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher Frank J. Leavitt has argued that the method Bates described would be [[Testability|difficult to test]] scientifically due to his emphasis on relaxation and visualization. Leavitt asked "How can we tell whether someone has relaxed or imagined something, or just thinks that he or she has imagined it?" In regards to the possibility of a [[Placebo-controlled study|placebo trial]], Leavitt commented "I cannot conceive of how we could put someone in a situation where he thinks he has imagined something while we know that he has not."&lt;ref name="Biomed" /&gt;

== After Bates ==

After Bates died in 1931, his methods of treatment were continued by his widow Emily and other associates,&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; some of whom incorporated exercises and dietary recommendations.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; Most subsequent proponents did not stand by Bates' explanation of how the eye focuses mechanically,&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt; but nonetheless maintained that relieving a habitual "strain" was the key to improving sight.&lt;ref name="Marg" /&gt;

=== Margaret Darst Corbett ===

Margaret Darst Corbett first met Bates when she consulted him about her husband's eyesight. She became his pupil, and eventually taught his method at her School of Eye Education in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=fullpollack7&gt;{{cite book |last = Pollack |first = Philip |title = The Truth about Eye Exercises |year = 1956 |publisher = [[Chilton Company]] |location = Philadelphia |page = 7 |url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b4399673;view=1up;seq=7 |accessdate = 2 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was of the stated belief that "the optic nerve is really part of the brain, and vision is nine-tenths mental and one-tenth only physical."&lt;ref name="Marg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="corbett"&gt;{{cite book |last = Corbett |first = Margaret Darst |title = How to Improve your Sight |year = 1954 |publisher = [[Faber and Faber]] |location = London |pages = 26–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1940, Corbett and her assistant were charged with violations of the Medical Practice Act of California for treating eyes without a licence. At the trial, many of her students testified on her behalf, describing in detail how she had enabled them to discard their glasses. One witness testified that he had been almost blind from cataracts, but that, after working with Corbett, his vision had improved to such an extent that for the first time he could read for eight hours at a stretch without glasses. Corbett explained in court that she was practicing neither [[optometry]] nor [[ophthalmology]] and represented herself not as a doctor but only as an "instructor of eye training". Describing her method she said "We turn vision on by teaching the eyes to shift. We want the sense of motion to relieve staring, to end the fixed look. We use light to relax the eyes and to accustom them to the sun."&lt;ref name=fullpollack7 /&gt;

The trial attracted widespread interest, as did the "not guilty" verdict. The case spurred a bill in the Californian State Legislature that would have then made such vision education illegal without an optometric or medical licence. After a lively campaign in the media, the bill was rejected.&lt;ref name=fullpollack8&gt;{{cite book |last = Pollack |first = Philip |title = The Truth about Eye Exercises |year = 1956 |publisher = [[Chilton Company]] |location = Philadelphia |page = 8 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=yJesAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Corbett }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aldous Huxley ===

[[File:Aldous Huxley.JPG|thumb|[[Aldous Huxley]]]]

Perhaps the most famous proponent of the Bates method was the British writer [[Aldous Huxley]]. At the age of sixteen Huxley had an attack of [[keratitis]], which, after an 18-month period of near-blindness, left him with one eye just capable of light perception and the other with an unaided [[Snellen fraction]] of 10/200. This was mainly due to opacities in both [[cornea]]s, complicated by [[hyperopia]] and [[astigmatism]]. He was able to read only if he wore thick glasses and dilated his better pupil with [[atropine]], to allow that eye to see around an opacity in the center of the cornea.&lt;ref name="Ceylon"&gt;{{cite journal |title = 'Fifty per cent terrific! fifty per cent non-existent': Aldous Huxley and medicine |journal = The Ceylon Medical Journal |volume = 49 |issue = 4 |pages = 142–43 |date = December 2004 |doi = 10.4038/cmj.v49i4.1932 |last1 = Basnayake |first1 = V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1939, at the age of 45 and with eyesight that continued to deteriorate, he happened to hear of the Bates method and sought the help of Margaret Corbett, who gave him regular lessons.&lt;ref name="Ceylon" /&gt; Three years later he wrote ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', in which he related: "Within a couple of months I was reading without spectacles and, what was better still, without strain and fatigue.... At the present time, my vision, though very far from normal, is about twice as good as it used to be when I wore spectacles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Aldous Huxley, Man of Letters: Thinker, Critic and Artist: Proceedings of the Third International Aldous Huxley Symposium, Riga 2004 |first = Bernfried |last = Nugel |publisher = LIT Verlag |location = Berlin-Hamburg-Münster |year = 2008 |page = 250 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=jkC0gvN12DMC&amp;pg=PA250 |isbn = 978-3825890346 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the process, Huxley wrote that "Vision is not won by making an effort to get it: it comes to those who have learned to put their minds and eyes into a state of alert passivity, of dynamic relaxation." He expressed indifference regarding the veracity of Bates' explanation of how the eye focuses, stating that "my concern is not with the anatomical mechanism of accommodation, but with the art of seeing."&lt;ref name=Marg /&gt;

His case generated wide publicity as well as scrutiny. Ophthalmologist Walter B. Lancaster, for example, suggested in 1944 that Huxley had "learned how to use what he has to better advantage" by training the "cerebral part of seeing", rather than actually improving the quality of the image on the [[retina]].&lt;ref name=Marg /&gt;

In 1952, ten years after writing ''The Art of Seeing'', Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and, according to [[Bennett Cerf]], apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty. In Cerf's words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Then suddenly he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In response to this, Huxley wrote "I often do use magnifying glasses where conditions of light are bad, and have never claimed to be able to read except under very good conditions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Letters of Aldous Huxley |first = Grover Cleveland |last = Smith |publisher = [[Harper &amp; Row]] |year = 1970 |page = 815 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=zcIZAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22I+often+do+use+magnifying+glasses+where+conditions+of+light+are+bad%2C+and+have+never+claimed+to+be+able+to+read+except+under+very+good+conditions.%22 |isbn = 070111312X }}&lt;/ref&gt; This underscored that he had not regained anything close to normal vision, and in fact never claimed that he had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Aldous Huxley: A Biography |first = Nicholas |last = Murray |publisher = Macmillan |year = 2003 |chapter = Sorrow |pages = 421–22 |chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=ktDo9SCBfxoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA421 |isbn = 0312302371 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern variants ===

"Natural vision correction" or "natural vision improvement" continues to be marketed by practitioners offering individual instruction, many of whom have no medical or optometric credentials. Most base their approach in the Bates method, though some also integrate [[vision therapy]] techniques.&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt; There are also many [[self-help]] books and programs, which have not been subjected to [[randomized controlled trials]], aimed at improving eyesight naturally.&lt;ref name="Harvard"&gt;{{cite journal |journal = Harvard Women's Health Watch |title = I can see clearly now … sort of |date = 1 July 2003 |url = http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2994518/I-can-see-clearly-now.html }}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purveyors of such approaches argue that they lack the funds to formally test them.&lt;ref name="educators"&gt;{{cite news |first = Robyn E. |last = Bradley |title = Advocates see only benefits from eye exercises |work = The Boston Globe |date = 23 September 2003 |url = http://www.boston.com/news/globe/health_science/articles/2003/09/23/advocates_see_only_benefits_from_eye_exercises/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The heavily advertised "[[See Clearly Method]]" (of which sales were halted by a court order in November 2006, in response to what were found to be dishonest marketing practices)&lt;ref name=Shin&gt;{{cite news |first = Annys |last = Shin |url = http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thecheckout/2006/11/hold_onto_those_eyeglasses.html |title = Seeing the See Clearly Method for What It Is |date = 6 November 2006 |work = The Washington Post |accessdate = 14 March 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061110130445/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thecheckout/2006/11/hold_onto_those_eyeglasses.html |archive-date = 10 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; included "palming" and "light therapy", both adapted from Bates.&lt;ref name=AllAboutVision&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.allaboutvision.com/buysmart/see_clearly.htm |title = The See Clearly Method &amp; Other Programs: Do Eye Exercises Improve Vision? |date = May 2009 |publisher = AllAboutVision.com |first1 = Rob |last1 = Murphy |first2 = Marilyn |last2 = Haddrill |first3 = Gary |last3 = Heiting |accessdate = 14 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of the program, however, emphasized that they did not endorse Bates' approach overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Steven M. |last1=Beresford |first2=David W. |last2=Muris |first3=Mara |last3=Tableman |first4=Francis A. |last4=Young |url=http://www.strong-eyes.com/RESEARCH%20MASTER.pdf |format=PDF |title=Clinical Evaluation of the See Clearly Method |page=13 |accessdate=14 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224053114/http://www.strong-eyes.com/RESEARCH%20MASTER.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1992 book ''The Bates Method, A Complete Guide to Improving Eyesight—Naturally'', "Bates method teacher" Peter Mansfield was very critical of [[eye care professional]]s for prescribing corrective lenses, recommending most of Bates' techniques to improve vision. The book included accounts of twelve "real cases", but did not report any information about [[refractive error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1097/00006324-199711000-00020 |title = The Bates Method, A Complete Guide to Improving Eyesight—Naturally [Review] |year = 1997 |last1 = Grosvenor |first1 = Theodore |journal = Optometry and Vision Science |volume = 74 |issue = 11 |page = 880 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech native John Slavicek claims to have created an "eye cure" that improves eyesight in three days, borrowing from ancient yogic eye exercises, visualizations from the [[Seth Material]], and the Bates method. Although he has testimonials from his neighbor and others, several of his students indicate that he has greatly exaggerated their cases. Slavicek's self-published manual, ''Yoga for the Eyes'', was rejected by an ophthalmologist who evaluated it, and evinced no interest from the [[World Health Organization]] and St. Erik's Eye Foundation in Sweden as he had not conducted [[double-blind]] tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Prague Post |location=Czech Republic |title=Blind faith |first=Kristin |last=Barendsen |date=20 November 2003 |url=http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/38282-blind-faith.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603051744/http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/38282-blind-faith.html |archivedate=3 June 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anecdotal support ==

In support of the effectiveness of the Bates method, proponents point to the many accounts of people allegedly having improved their eyesight by applying it.&lt;ref name=WebMD /&gt; While these anecdotes may be told and passed on in [[good faith]], several potential explanations exist for the phenomena reported other than a genuine reversal of a [[refractive error]] due to the techniques practiced:
* Some cases of nearsightedness are recognized as due to a transient spasm of the ciliary muscle, rather than a misshapen eyeball. These are classed as [[pseudomyopia]], of which spontaneous reversal may account for some reports of improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=S Leo |author2=Y Ling |author3=T Wong |author4=B Quah |location=Singapore |journal=Annals-Academy of Medicine |url=http://www.annals.edu.sg/PDF/36VolNo10SupplOct2007/V36N10(S1)pS65.pdf |format=PDF |date=October 2007 |title=Report of the National Myopia Prevention and Control Workgroup 2006: A Summary |volume=36 |issue=10 |page=67 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419104601/http://www.annals.edu.sg/PDF/36VolNo10SupplOct2007/V36N10%28S1%29pS65.pdf |archivedate=19 April 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Research has confirmed that when nearsighted subjects remove their corrective lenses, over time there is a limited improvement (termed "blur adaptation") in their unaided visual resolution, even though [[Refraction#Clinical significance|refraction]] indicates no corresponding change in refractive error.&lt;ref name=Rosenfield&gt;{{cite journal |title = Blur Adaptation in Myopes |first1 = Mark |last1 = Rosenfield |first2 = Susan |last2 = Hong |first3 = Sini |last3 = George |date = September 2004 |url = http://www.optvissci.com/pt/re/ovs/fulltext.00006324-200409000-00009.htm |volume = 81 |issue = 9 |pages = 657–62 |journal = Optometry and Vision Science |doi = 10.1097/01.opx.0000144743.34976.da |pmid = 15365384 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is believed to occur due to adjustments made in the [[visual system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal = American Academy of Optometry |title = Decreased Uncorrected Vision After a Period of Distance Fixation with Spectacle Wear |first1 = Konrad |last1 = Pesudovs |first2 = Noel A. |last2 = Brennan |year = 1993 |volume = 70 |issue = 7 |pages = 528–31 |url = http://www.pesudovs.com/konrad/Docs/Brennan.pdf |format = PDF |doi = 10.1097/00006324-199307000-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One who has been practicing Bates' techniques and notices such improvement may not realize that simply leaving the glasses off would have had the same effect, which may be especially pronounced if the [[Eyeglass prescription|prescription]] was too strong to begin with.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;
* Visual acuity is affected by the size of the pupil. When it [[Miosis|constricts]] (such as in response to an increase in light), the quality of focus will improve significantly, at the cost of a reduced ability to see in dim light. This is known as the "[[Diffraction-limited system|pinhole effect]]".&lt;ref name="AAO" /&gt; This concept is also used in photography when changing the [[aperture]] size.
* Some eye defects may naturally change for the better with age or in cycles (ophthalmologist Stewart Duke-Elder suggested that this is what happened with Aldous Huxley&lt;ref name="DukeElder"&gt;{{cite journal |first = Stewart |last = Duke-Elder |journal = British Medical Journal |date = 22 May 1943 |title = Aldous Huxley on Vision |pages = 635–36 |url = http://ukpmc.ac.uk/backend/ptpmcrender.cgi?accid=PMC2282772&amp;blobtype=pdf |format = PDF |pmc = 2282772 |volume = 1 |issue = 4298 |doi = 10.1136/bmj.1.4298.635-a }}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;). A [[cataract]] when first setting in sometimes results in much improved eyesight for a short time. One who happens to have been practicing the Bates method will likely credit it for any improvement experienced regardless of the actual cause.&lt;ref name="Gardner" /&gt;
* Some studies have suggested that a learned ability to interpret blurred images may account for perceived improvements in eyesight.&lt;ref name="AAO" /&gt; Ophthalmologist Walter B. Lancaster had this to say: "Since seeing is only partly a matter of the image on the retina and the sensation it produces, but is in still larger part a matter of the cerebral processes of synthesis, in which memories play a principal role, it follows that by repetition, by practice, by exercises, one builds up a substratum of memories useful for the interpretation of sensations and facilitates the syntheses which are the major part of seeing."&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;{{cite journal |journal = The Australasian Journal of Optometry |title = Present Status of Eye Exercise for Improvement of Visual Function |date = 31 October 1945 |first = Walter B |last = Lancaster |volume = 28 |issue = 10 |url = http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/122274312/PDFSTART |format = PDF |pages = 449–80 |doi = 10.1111/j.1444-0938.1945.tb00209.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lancaster faulted ophthalmologists in general for neglecting the role of the brain in the process of seeing, "leaving to irregular, half-trained workers the cultivation of that field".&lt;ref name=Lancaster /&gt;
* A 1952 study involving 100 subjects claiming to experience "flashes" of clear vision, in which eyesight momentarily becomes much sharper, found only one subject who "demonstrated unusually good transient acuity (a flash) but she was unable to maintain it or repeat it for measurement of refraction" and concluded that "'flashers' (those who can obtain remarkably large transient increases in visual acuity) are uncommon".&lt;ref name="Marg" /&gt; A 2004 study proposed that such flashes may be caused by "negative accommodation" (i.e. an active flattening of the lens by the ciliary muscles).&lt;ref name=Raz2004a&gt;{{cite journal |last = Raz |first = A. |last2 = Marinoff |first2 = G.

L. |year = 2004 |title = Substrates of negative accommodation |journal = Binocular Vision &amp; Strabismus Quarterly |volume = 19 |issue = 2 |pages = 71–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 1982 study of subjects who underwent computer-based visual training concluded that any perceived resulting improvement in visual acuity is best explained as a [[contact lens]]-like effect of moisture on the eye, based on increased tear action exhibited by 15 out of 17 subjects who experienced such improvement.&lt;ref name="AAO"&gt;{{cite web |date = August 2013 |url = http://www.aao.org/complimentary-therapy-assessment/visual-training-refractive-errors-cta--october-200 |publisher = American Academy of Ophthalmology |title = Complementary Therapy Assessments: Visual Training for Refractive Errors |accessdate = 20 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2003 study of claims that "positive suggestion (e.g., using hypnosis) can significantly improve visual acuity" found that "neither suggestion nor hypnotic phenomena are likely to significantly improve myopic vision".&lt;ref name=Raz2004b&gt;{{cite journal |last = Raz |first = A. |last2 = Marinoff |first2 = G.

== General research ==
{{See also|Behavioral optometry|Vision therapy}}

In 2004 the [[American Academy of Ophthalmology]] (AAO) published a review of various research regarding "visual training",&lt;ref name="WebMD" /&gt; which consisted of "eye exercises, muscle relaxation techniques, biofeedback, eye patches, or eye massages", "alone or in combinations". No evidence was found that such techniques could [[Objectivity (science)|objectively]] benefit eyesight, though some studies noted changes, both positive and negative, in the [[visual acuity]] of nearsighted subjects as measured by a [[Snellen chart]]. In some cases noted improvements were maintained at subsequent follow-ups. However, these results were not seen as actual reversals of nearsightedness, and were attributed instead to factors such as "improvements in interpreting blurred images, changes in mood or motivation, creation of an artificial contact lens by tear film changes, or a pinhole effect from [[miosis]] of the pupil."&lt;ref name="AAO" /&gt;

In 2005 the Ophthalmology Department of New Zealand's [[Christchurch Hospital]] published a review of forty-three studies regarding the use of [[eye exercises]]. They found that "As yet there is no clear scientific evidence published in the mainstream literature supporting the use of eye exercises" to improve visual acuity, and concluded that "their use therefore remains controversial."&lt;ref name="Rawstron"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Rawstron |first = JA |last2 = Burley |first2 = CD |last3 = Elder |first3 = MJ |journal = Journal of Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus |year = 2005 |volume = 42 |issue = 2 |pages = 82–88 |title = A systematic review of the applicability and efficacy of eye exercises |pmid = 15825744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== General criticisms ==

=== Dead-end ===

A frequent criticism of the Bates method is that it has remained relatively obscure, which is seen as proof that it is not truly effective. Writer Alan M. MacRobert concluded in a 1979 article that the "most telling argument against the Bates system" and other [[Alternative medicine|alternative therapies]] was that they "bore no fruit". In regards to the Bates method, he reasoned that "If palming, shifting, and swinging could really cure poor eyesight, glasses would be as obsolete by now as horse-drawn carriages."&lt;ref name=MacRobert&gt;{{cite news |date = 28 March 1979 |newspaper = [[San Diego Reader]] |first = Alan M. |last = MacRobert |url = http://www.skeptically.org/thinkersonreligion/id1.html |title = Hocus Focus: modern spiritualism }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corrective lenses and safety ===
Discarding one's corrective lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses weaker than one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially when one is operating a motor vehicle.&lt;ref name="Grierson" /&gt; [[James Randi]] related that his father, shortly after discarding glasses on the advice of Bates' book, wrecked his car.&lt;ref name='J.Randi Bates'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.randi.org/jr/2006-11/111706rampa.html#i3 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110224220929/http://randi.org/jr/2006-11/111706rampa.html#i3 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=24 February 2011 |title=Swift: the weekly newsletter of the JREF |accessdate=6 April 2009 |last=Randi |first=James |date=17 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bates method teachers often caution that when driving, one should wear the correction legally required.&lt;ref name="Grierson" /&gt;

=== Avoidance of conventional treatment ===

One of the greatest potential dangers of faith in the Bates method is that a believer may be disinclined to [[Eye examination|seek medical advice]] regarding what could be a sight-threatening condition requiring prompt treatment, such as [[glaucoma]].&lt;ref name="Chou" /&gt; Also, children with vision problems may require early attention by a professional in order to successfully prevent [[amblyopia|lazy eye]]. Such treatment may include exercises, but which are different from those associated with the Bates method, and parents who subscribe to Bates' ideas may delay seeking conventional care until it is too late.&lt;ref name="Grierson" /&gt; It may further be necessary for a child at risk of developing lazy eye to wear the proper correction.&lt;ref name=Donahue&gt;{{cite journal |title = Prescribing Spectacles in Children: A Pediatric Ophthalmologist's Approach |last = Donahue |first = Sean P. |journal = Optometry and Vision Science |date = February 2007 |volume = 84 |pages = 110–14 |url = http://www.optvissci.com/pt/re/ovs/fulltext.00006324-200702000-00009.htm |doi = 10.1097/OPX.0b013e318031b09b |pmid = 17299340 |issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blood irradiation therapy''' is a procedure in which the blood is exposed to low level red light (often [[laser]] light) for therapeutic reasons.  Most research on blood irradiation therapy has been conducted in Germany (by UV lamps), and in Russia (in all variants)&lt;ref name = "Geynits A.V. et al., 2012"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Intravenous laser blood irradiation [in Russian]|author1=Geynits A.V. |author2=Moskvin S.V. |author3=Achilov A.A. |publisher= Triada |location= M.–Tver |year=2012 |pages=336 |isbn= 978-5-94789-501-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Moskvin S.V., 2014"&gt;{{Cite book| title = The effectiveness of laser therapy.

Blood irradiation therapy can be administered in three ways. Extracorporeally, drawing blood out and irradiating it in a special cuvette. This method is used for the ultraviolet (UV) blood irradiation (UVBI) by UV lamps. The laser light is monochromatic, i.e. it has such a wavelength that allows you to bring light into the optical fiber and carry out irradiation intravenously through a [[catheter]] in a [[vein]]. This method is more simple and effective. Blood irradiation therapy is also administered externally through the skin on the projection of large blood vessels.

It is not related to the practice of [[Gamma ray|gamma]] irradiation of blood in [[transfusion medicine]].

==History==
Historically, German doctors were the first to irradiate blood by UV lamps in the 1920s, and UVBI is widely spread in Germany so far. In the USA, this technique was best known during the Second World War.&lt;ref name = Schwartz/&gt;&lt;ref name = Knott/&gt;
Intravenous laser blood irradiation (a more effective and modern variant) was developed experimentally by the Russian researchers, Meshalkin and Sergievskiy, and introduced into clinical practice in 1981. Originally the method was applied in the treatment of cardiovascular abnormalities.&lt;ref name = Moshkovska/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meshalkin E N, Sergievskii V S, Primenenie pryamogo lazernogo izlucheniya v eksperimental'noi i klinicheskoi meditsine (Application of Direct Laser Radiation in Experimental and Clinical Medicine), (Novosibirsk: Nauka), 1981&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now used in the treatment of a wide range of diseases in select countries.&lt;ref name = "Geynits A.V. et al., 2012"/&gt;

However, one must note that such treatment is not financed by health insurance systems and is not used in the European Union and in the USA since the nineteen seventies, and it is not an FDA-authorized procedure. The vastly variable effects do not warrant the use of this invasive technique.

==Types==

===Intravenous laser blood irradiation===
[[Image:Intravenous Blood Irradiation.JPG|150px|thumb|alt=An intravenous blood irradiation therapy in use.|Intravenous blood irradiation.]]
[[Intravenous]] or intravascular laser blood irradiation (ILBI) involves the ''[[in-vivo]]'' illumination of the blood by feeding low level [[laser]] light generated by a 1–3&amp;nbsp;mW [[helium–neon laser]] at a wavelength of 632.8&amp;nbsp;nm into a vascular channel, usually a vein in the forearm, under the assumption that any therapeutic effect will be circulated through the [[circulatory system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Weber | first = MH |author2=Fussgänger-May TW | year = 2007 | title = Intravenous laser blood irradiation | journal = German Journal of Acupuncture and related Techniques| volume = 50| issue = 3 | pages = 12–23 | doi=10.1078/0415-6412-00282}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Most often wavelengths of 365, 405, 525 and 635&amp;nbsp;nm and power of 2.3&amp;nbsp;mW are used. The technique is widely used at present in Russia, less in Asia, and not extensively in other parts of the world. It is shown that ILBI improves blood flow and its transport activities, therefore, tissue trophism, has a positive effect on the immune system and cell metabolism.&lt;ref name = "Geynits A.V. et al., 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Moskvin S.V., 2014"/&gt; This issue is subject to skepticism.&lt;ref name = "Geynits A.V. et al., 2012"/&gt; There have been some calls to increase research on this topic.&lt;ref name = Moshkovska/&gt;

===Transcutaneous laser blood irradiation ===
Transcutaneous therapy applies laser light on unbroken skin in areas with large numbers of blood vessels (such as the forearm).  Because of the skin acting as a barrier to the blood, absorbing low level laser energy, the power of the laser is often boosted to compensate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Biomedical optics and lasers: diagnostics and treatment: 16–18 September 1998, Beijing, China |author=Harrington James, Li Junheng |publisher=SPIE |location=Bellingham, Washington |year=1998 |pages= |isbn=0-8194-3009-9 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The problem can be solved by using pulsed matrix laser light sources.&lt;ref name = "Moskvin S.V., 2014"/&gt;

=== Extracorporeal irradiation===
It is used only for ultraviolet blood irradiation, that involves drawing blood out through a vein and irradiating it outside of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Extracorporeal ultraviolet blood irradiation in medicine |author1=Vetchinnikova O.N. |author2=Piksin I.N. |author3=Kalinin A.P. | publisher = M.: Publisher E.

'''''Bruesewitz v. Wyeth''''', 562 U.S. 223 (2011), is a United States Supreme Court case that decided whether a section of the [[National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act]] of 1986 [[Federal preemption|preempts]] ''all'' vaccine design defect claims against vaccine manufacturers.

==Background==
Hannah Bruesewitz, the daughter of the main petitioners in the case, received Wyeth's Tri-Immunol DTP vaccine as part of childhood immunizations. The Bruesewitzes claimed that Hannah's [[seizures]] and later developmental problems came from the vaccine. They filed suit in the "[[Vaccine Court]]", a special court within the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]]. Their petition was dismissed for failure to prove a link between the vaccine and Hannah's health problems.

They proceeded to sue in Pennsylvania state court. The case was removed to the local federal court, which held that the claim was preempted by a section of the [[National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act]] of 1986. The [[Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|Third Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed.&lt;ref&gt;''Bruesewitz v. Wyeth'', [http://www.ca3.uscourts.gov/opinarch/073794p.pdf], Third Circuit affirms, (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; A petition for a writ of [[certiorari]] was granted on March 8, 2010, bringing the case to the Supreme Court.

In briefings before the Court, both sides argued over the specific language of the statutory provision.

== Decision ==
The case was decided on February 22, 2011. The Court, in a 6-2 opinion by Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], held that the "plaintiffs design defect claims [were] expressly preempted by the Vaccine Act." Thus, the court affirmed laws that vaccine manufacturers are not liable for vaccine-induced injury or death if they are "accompanied by proper directions and warnings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title42/pdf/USCODE-2010-title42-chap6A-subchapXIX-part2-subpartb-sec300aa-23.pdf |title=42 U.S.C. 300aa-22. Standards of responsibility |year=2010 |page=1161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Justices [[Sonia Sotomayor]] and [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] dissented.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3066">'''[[Cannabis]] in [[Vietnam]]''' is illegal, but is cultivated within the country. It is known locally as '''cần sa'''.

==History==
Cannabis was probably introduced to Southeast Asia around the 16th century, and used medicinally and in cuisine.&lt;ref name="Cohen2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sidney Cohen|title=The Therapeutic Potential of Marihuana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=89vTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|date=6 December 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4613-4286-1|pages=3–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 the government of the [[Republic of Vietnam]] "publicly condemned" the use or trafficking of cannabis, and instructed local chiefs to prevent its cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vietnam Studies: Law at War: Vietnam 1964-1973|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0_GdRa3z4YcC&amp;pg=PT120|publisher=LLMC|pages=120–|id=GGKEY:L7BC9KNKENA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, [[USAID]]'s Office of Public Safety began eradication of cannabis fields, including aerial eradication in the [[Mekong Delta]]. The program was popularly resented and also politically unpalatable; in 1971 OPS was advised not to eradicate cannabis in areas controlled by the [[Hòa Hảo]] sect, for fear of driving them to join the National Liberation Front.&lt;ref name="Kuzmarov2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeremy Kuzmarov|title=The Myth of the Addicted Army: Vietnam and the Modern War on Drugs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qDbtvEIxWigC&amp;pg=PA206|year=2009|publisher=Univ of Massachusetts Press|isbn=1-55849-705-6|pages=206–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American troops in the Vietnam War===
In the 1960s, the United States government became concerned with cannabis use by US troops in the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="Camp2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman M. Camp|title=US Army Psychiatry in the Vietnam War: New Challenges in Extended Counterinsurgency Warfare: New Challenges in Extended Counterinsurgency Warfare|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ty3BDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT556|date=15 March 2015|publisher=United States Department of Defense|isbn=978-0-16-093790-3|pages=556–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though alcohol was the drug most commonly used by American troops in the [[Vietnam War]], cannabis was the second-most common. Initially rates of usage among deployed soldiers were comparable to those of their stateside peers, with 29% of troops departing Vietnam in 1967 reporting having ever used marijuana in their lives. A 1976 study however showed that from 1967–1971, the proportion of troops having used marijuana peaked at 34% before stabilizing to 18%, while the number of troops who had used cannabis ''prior'' to deployment stayed around 8%.&lt;ref name="MenningerNemiah2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roy W.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Cirrhosis''' is a condition in which the [[liver]] does not function properly due to long-term damage.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; This damage is characterized by the replacement of normal liver [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] by [[fibrosis|scar tissue]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Typically, the disease develops slowly over months or years.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Early on, there are often no symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; As the disease worsens, a person may become [[Fatigue|tired]], [[Asthenia|weak]], [[Pruritus|itchy]], have [[pedal edema|swelling in the lower legs]], develop [[jaundice|yellow skin]], bruise easily, have [[ascites|fluid build up in the abdomen]], or develop [[spider angioma|spider-like blood vessels on the skin]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; The fluid build-up in the abdomen may become [[spontaneous bacterial peritonitis|spontaneously infected]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Other complications include [[hepatic encephalopathy]], bleeding from [[esophageal varices|dilated veins in the esophagus]] or [[gastric varices|dilated stomach veins]], and [[liver cancer]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Hepatic encephalopathy results in confusion and may lead to [[unconsciousness]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite web |title=Cirrhosis |url=http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/liver-disease/cirrhosis/Pages/facts.aspx|accessdate=19 May 2015 |date=April 23, 2014 |website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609090212/http://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/health-topics/liver-disease/cirrhosis/Pages/facts.aspx |archivedate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause, mechanism and diagnosis --&gt;
Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by [[alcoholism|alcohol]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], and [[non-alcoholic fatty liver disease]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=GBD2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=GBD 2013 Mortality and Causes of Death|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national age-sex specific all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 240 causes of death, 1990–2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=17 December 2014|pmid=25530442|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(14)61682-2|volume=385|issue=9963|pages=117–71|pmc=4340604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, more than two or three alcoholic drinks per day over a number of years is required for alcoholic cirrhosis to occur.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease has a number of causes, including being [[overweight]], [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[hyperlipidemia|high blood fats]], and [[hypertension|high blood pressure]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; A number of less common causes of cirrhosis include [[autoimmune hepatitis]], [[primary biliary cholangitis]], [[hemochromatosis]], certain medications, and [[gallstones]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Diagnosis is based on blood testing, [[medical imaging]], and [[liver biopsy]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Some causes of cirrhosis, such as hepatitis B, can be prevented by [[vaccination]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Treatment partly depends on the underlying cause,&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; but the goal is often to prevent worsening and complications.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Avoiding alcohol is recommended in all cases of cirrhosis.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Hepatitis B and C may be treatable with [[antiviral medication]]s.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Autoimmune hepatitis may be treated with [[corticosteroids|steroid medications]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; [[Ursodiol]] may be useful if the disease is due to blockage of the [[bile duct]]s.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Other medications may be useful for complications such as abdominal or leg swelling, [[hepatic encephalopathy]], and dilated esophageal veins.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; In severe cirrhosis, a [[liver transplant]] may be an option.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
Cirrhosis affected about 2.8 million people and resulted in 1.3 million deaths in 2015.&lt;ref name=GBD2015Pre/&gt;&lt;ref name=GBD2015De/&gt; Of these, alcohol caused 348,000, hepatitis C caused 326,000, and hepatitis B caused 371,000.&lt;ref name=GBD2015De/&gt; In the United States, more men die of cirrhosis than women.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; The first known description of the condition is by [[Hippocrates]] in the 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brower|first1=Steven T.|title=Elective general surgery : an evidence-based approach|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=9781607951094|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ctqtT0hieL0C&amp;pg=PA366|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170908175353/https://books.google.com/books?id=ctqtT0hieL0C&amp;pg=PA366|archivedate=2017-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''cirrhosis'' is from {{lang-gr|κίρρωσις}}; ''kirrhos'' {{lang|grc|κιρρός}} "yellowish" and ''-osis'' (-{{lang|grc|ωσις}}) meaning "condition", describing the appearance of a cirrhotic liver.&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kirro/s|κιρρός|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|cirrhosis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|-osis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Liver Cirrhosis.png|thumb|upright=1.4|Liver cirrhosis.]]
Cirrhosis has many possible manifestations. These signs and symptoms may be either a direct result of the failure of liver cells, or secondary to the resultant [[portal hypertension]]. There are also some manifestations whose causes are nonspecific but which may occur in cirrhosis. Likewise, the absence of any signs does not rule out the possibility of cirrhosis.&lt;ref name="Book. Current Med Diagnosis"/&gt; Cirrhosis of the liver is slow and gradual in its development. It is usually well advanced before its symptoms are noticeable enough to cause alarm. Weakness and loss of weight may be early symptoms.

===Liver dysfunction===
The following features are as a direct consequence of liver cells not functioning.

*[[Spider angioma]]ta or spider nevi are vascular lesions consisting of a central arteriole surrounded by many smaller vessels (hence the name "spider") and occur due to an increase in [[estradiol]]. One study found that spider angiomata occur in about 1/3 of cases.&lt;ref name="pmid10423070"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li CP, Lee FY, Hwang SJ |title=Spider angiomas in patients with liver cirrhosis: role of alcoholism and impaired liver function |journal=Scand. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=520–3 |year=1999 |pmid=10423070| doi = 10.1080/003655299750026272|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Palmar erythema]] is a reddening of palms at the [[thenar eminence|thenar]] and [[hypothenar eminence]]s also as a result of increased [[estrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=william|first=james|title=Andrews' Diseases of the Skin: Clinical Dermatology|year=2005|publisher=saunders|isbn=0-7216-2921-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Gynecomastia]], or increase in breast gland size in men that is not cancerous, is caused by increased estradiol and can occur in up to 2/3 of patients.&lt;ref name="Primary care guidelines"&gt;{{cite book|last=Slater|first=Joseph S. Esherick, Daniel S. Clark, Evan D.|title=Current practice guidelines in primary care 2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=0071797505|pages=Chapter 3: Disease Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from increase in breast fat in overweight people.&lt;ref name="Liver disease and the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Thiel|first=DH|author2=Gavaler, JS |author3=Schade, RR |title=Liver disease and the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis.|journal=Seminars in liver disease|date=February 1985|volume=5|issue=1|pages=35–45|pmid=3983651|doi=10.1055/s-2008-1041756}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hypogonadism]], a decrease in male sex hormones may manifest as impotence, infertility, loss of sexual drive, and testicular atrophy, and can result from primary gonadal injury or suppression of [[hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis|hypothalamic/pituitary function]]. Hypogonadism is associated with cirrhosis due to alcoholism or hemochromatosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=van Thiel|first=DH|author2=Gavaler, JS |author3=Spero, JA |author4=Egler, KM |author5=Wright, C |author6=Sanghvi, AT |author7=Hasiba, U |author8= Lewis, JH |title=Patterns of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal dysfunction in men with liver disease due to differing etiologies.|journal=Hepatology|date=Jan–Feb 1981|volume=1|issue=1|pages=39–46|pmid=6793494|doi=10.1002/hep.1840010107}}&lt;!--|accessdate=10 December 2013--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Liver size can be [[hepatomegaly|enlarged]], normal, or shrunken in people with cirrhosis.
*[[Ascites]], accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity (space in the abdomen), gives rise to "flank dullness". This may be visible as an increase in abdominal girth.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section"&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=ed. Dan L. Longo ... [et|title=Harrison's principles of internal medicine.|year=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=9780071748896|pages=Chapter 308. Cirrhosis and Its Complications|edition=18th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Fetor hepaticus]] is a musty breath odor resulting from increased [[dimethyl sulfide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tangerman|first=A|author2=Meuwese-Arends, MT |author3=Jansen, JB |title=Cause and composition of foetor hepaticus.|journal=Lancet|date=Feb 19, 1994|volume=343|issue=8895|pages=483|pmid=7905979|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(94)92729-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jaundice]], or ''icterus'' is yellow discoloration of the skin and [[mucous membrane]]s, (with the [[sclera|white of the eye]] being especially noticeable) due to increased bilirubin (at least 2–3&amp;nbsp;mg/dl or 30&amp;nbsp;µmol/l). The urine may also appear dark.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;

===Portal hypertension===
Liver cirrhosis increases resistance to blood flow and leads to higher pressure in the portal venous system, resulting in [[portal hypertension]]. Effects of portal hypertension include:
* [[Splenomegaly]] (increase in size of the spleen) is found in 35% to 50% of patients.&lt;ref name="Book. Current Med Diagnosis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedman LS|title=Current medical diagnosis and treatment 2014.|year=2014|publisher=Mcgraw-Hill|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0071806336|pages=Chapter 16. Liver, Biliary Tract, &amp; Pancreas Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Esophageal varices]] result from collateral portal blood flow through vessels in the stomach and esophagus (a process called [[portacaval anastomosis]]). When these blood vessels become enlarged, they are called varices and are more likely to rupture.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt; Variceal rupture often leads to severe bleeding, which can be fatal.
* [[Caput medusa]] are dilated periumbilical collateral veins due to portal hypertension. Blood from the portal venous system may be shunted through the periumbilical veins and ultimately to the abdominal wall veins, manifesting as a pattern that may resemble the head of [[Medusa]].&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;
* Cruveilhier-Baumgarten murmur is a venous hum heard in the epigastric region (on examination by stethoscope) due to collateral connections forming between the portal system and the periumbilical veins as a result of portal hypertension.

===Unestablished cause===
There are some changes seen in cirrhosis whose causes are not clearly known. They may also be a sign of other non-liver related causes.
* Nail changes.
** [[Muehrcke's lines]]&amp;nbsp;– paired horizontal bands separated by normal color resulting from [[hypoalbuminemia]] (inadequate production of [[human serum albumin|albumin]]). It is not specific for cirrhosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suurmond|first=D.|title=Color Atlas and Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology: Common and Serious Diseases|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=978-0071793025|pages=Section 33: Disorders of the nail apparatus}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Terry's nails]] (double nails) – proximal two-thirds of the nail plate appears white with distal one-third red, also due to hypoalbuminemia&lt;ref name="Derm Atlas"&gt;{{cite book|last=Suurmond|first=D.|title=Fitzpatrick's Color Atlas &amp; Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology. 6th ed|year=2009|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|pages=Section 33. Disorders of the Nail Apparatus}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Nail clubbing|Clubbing]] – angle between the nail plate and proximal nail fold &gt; 180 degrees. It is not specific for cirrhosis and can therefore can be due to a number of conditions&lt;ref name="Derm Atlas" /&gt;
* [[Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy]]. Chronic proliferative [[periostitis]] of the long bones that can cause considerable pain. It is not specific for cirrhosis.&lt;ref name="Derm Atlas" /&gt;
* [[Dupuytren's contracture]]. Thickening and shortening of palmar fascia (tissue on the palm of the hands) that leads to flexion deformities of the fingers. Caused by fibroblastic proliferation (increased growth) and disorderly [[collagen]] deposition. It is relatively common (33% of patients).&lt;ref name="Derm Atlas" /&gt;
* Other. Weakness, fatigue, [[anorexia]], weight loss.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;

===Advanced disease===
As the disease progresses, complications may develop. In some people, these may be the first signs of the disease.
* [[Bruising]] and [[hemorrhage|bleeding]] resulting from decreased production of [[coagulation]] factors.
* [[Hepatic encephalopathy]] – the liver does not clear [[ammonia]] and related nitrogenous substances from the blood, which are carried to the brain, affecting cerebral functioning: neglect of personal appearance, unresponsiveness, forgetfulness, trouble concentrating, changes in sleep habits or psychosis may result. This can be seen on exam by [[asterixis]], which is bilateral asynchronous flapping of outstretched, dorsiflexed hands seen in patients with hepatic encephalopathy.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;
* Sensitivity to medication caused by decreased metabolism of the active compounds.
* [[Acute kidney injury]] (particularly [[hepatorenal syndrome]])&lt;ref&gt;Longo et al. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 18th ed., p.2295&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==

Liver cirrhosis has many possible causes; sometimes more than one cause is present in the same person. Globally, 57% of cirrhosis is attributable to either hepatitis B (30%) or hepatitis C (27%).&lt;ref name=Perz2006&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Perz JF, Armstrong GL, Farrington LA, Hutin YJ, Bell BP |title=The contributions of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections to cirrhosis and primary liver cancer worldwide |journal=J. Hepatol. |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=529–38 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16879891 |doi=10.1016/j.jhep.2006.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol consumption is another major cause, accounting for about 20% of the cases.&lt;ref name=Perz2006/&gt;

* [[Alcoholic liver disease]] (ALD). Alcoholic cirrhosis develops for 10–20% of individuals who drink heavily for a decade or more.&lt;ref&gt;Alcohol-Induced Liver Disease; {{cite web |url=http://www.liverfoundation.org/abouttheliver/info/alcohol/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112014358/http://www.liverfoundation.org/abouttheliver/info/alcohol/ |archivedate=2012-01-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol seems to injure the [[liver]] by blocking the normal metabolism of protein, fats, and carbohydrates. This injury happens through the formation of acetaldehyde from alcohol which itself is reactive, but which also leads to the accumulation of other reactive products in the liver.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;  Patients may also have concurrent [[alcoholic hepatitis]] with fever, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and anorexia. [[SGOT|AST and ALT]] blood levels are both elevated, but at less than 300 IU/liter, with an AST:ALT ratio &gt; 2.0, a value rarely seen in other liver diseases.&lt;ref name="Book. Current Med Diagnosis" /&gt; In the United States, 40% of cirrhosis-related deaths are due to alcohol.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;
* [[Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis]] (NASH). In NASH, fat builds up in the liver and eventually causes scar tissue. This type of hepatitis appears to be associated with obesity (40% of NASH patients) diabetes, protein malnutrition, coronary artery disease, and treatment with steroid medications. This disorder is similar in it signs to alcoholic liver disease, but the patient does not have an alcohol history. A biopsy is needed for diagnosis.&lt;ref name="Book. Current Med Diagnosis" /&gt;
* Chronic [[hepatitis C]]. Infection with the [[hepatitis C virus]] causes inflammation of the liver and a variable grade of damage to the organ. Over several decades, this inflammation and damage can lead to cirrhosis. Among patients with chronic hepatitis C, 20–30% will develop cirrhosis.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Huang H | year = 2004 | title = IDENTIFICATION OF NOVEL GENETIC MARKERS ASSOCIATED WITH FIBROSIS PROGRESSION RISK IN HCV PATIENTS FROM A GENOMIC SCAN OF PUTATIVE FUNCTIONAL POLYMORPHISMS | doi = 10.1002/hep.1840400503| journal = Hepatology | volume = 40 | issue = | page = 230A |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cirrhosis caused by hepatitis C and alcoholic liver disease are the most common reasons for liver transplant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=al.]|first=ed.

* Chronic [[hepatitis B]]. The [[hepatitis B virus]] causes liver inflammation and injury that over several decades can lead to cirrhosis. Hepatitis D is dependent on the presence of hepatitis B and accelerates cirrhosis in co-infection.&lt;ref name="Book. Current Med Diagnosis" /&gt;
* [[Primary biliary cholangitis]] (also known as primary biliary cirrhosis). The bile ducts become damaged by an autoimmune process, leading to secondary liver damage. Patients may be asymptomatic or have fatigue, [[pruritus]], and non-jaundice skin hyperpigmentation with hepatomegaly. There is prominent [[alkaline phosphatase]] elevation as well as elevations in cholesterol and bilirubin and usually positive [[anti-mitochondrial antibodies]].
* [[Primary sclerosing cholangitis]]. PSC is a progressive cholestatic disorder presenting with pruritus, [[steatorrhea]], fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, and [[metabolic bone disease]]. There is a strong association with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), especially ulcerative colitis.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;
* [[Autoimmune hepatitis]]. This disease is caused by an attack of the liver by [[lymphocytes]], causing inflammation and eventually scarring and cirrhosis. Findings include elevations in serum globulins, especially gamma globulins.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;
* [[Hereditary hemochromatosis]]. Usually presents with a family history of cirrhosis, skin hyperpigmentation, diabetes mellitus, [[pseudogout]], or [[cardiomyopathy]], all due to signs of [[iron overload]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edwards|first=CQ|author2=Kushner, JP|title=Screening for hemochromatosis.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=Jun 3, 1993|volume=328|issue=22|pages=1616–20|pmid=8110209|doi=10.1056/NEJM199306033282208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;
* [[Wilson's disease]]. Autosomal recessive disorder characterized by low serum [[ceruloplasmin]] and increased hepatic copper content on liver biopsy and elevated 24-hour urine copper. May also have [[Kayser-Fleischer rings]] in the cornea and altered mental status.
* [[Indian childhood cirrhosis]] is a form of neonatal cholestasis characterized by deposition of copper in the liver.&lt;ref name="pmid9587155"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tanner|first=MS|title=Role of copper in Indian childhood cirrhosis.|journal=The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition|date=May 1998|volume=67|issue=5 Suppl|pages=1074S-1081S|pmid=9587155}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency]] (A1AD). Autosomal recessive disorder of decreased levels of the enzyme alpha 1—antitrypsin.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;
* [[Cardiac cirrhosis]]. Due to chronic right sided heart failure, which leads to liver congestion.&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;
* [[Galactosemia]]
* [[Glycogen storage disease type IV]]
* [[Cystic fibrosis]]&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;

==Pathophysiology==
The liver plays a vital role in synthesis of proteins (for example, [[serum albumin|albumin]], [[coagulation|clotting factors]] and [[complement system|complement]]), detoxification, and storage (for example, [[vitamin A]]). In addition, it participates in the metabolism of [[lipid]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s.

Cirrhosis is often preceded by hepatitis and fatty liver (steatosis), independent of the cause. If the cause is removed at this stage, the changes are fully reversible.

The pathological hallmark of cirrhosis is the development of scar tissue that replaces normal [[parenchyma]]. This scar tissue blocks the portal flow of blood through the organ, raising the blood pressure and disturbing normal function. Recent research shows the pivotal role of the [[hepatic stellate cell|stellate cell]], a cell type that normally stores [[vitamin A]], in the development of cirrhosis. Damage to the hepatic parenchyma (due to inflammation) leads to activation of stellate cells, which increases fibrosis (through production of [[myofibroblasts]]) and obstructs hepatic blood flow.&lt;ref name="Path. of cirrhosis"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hammer|first=edited by Stephen J.

Furthermore, it secretes [[Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase|TIMP]] 1 and 2, naturally occurring inhibitors of [[matrix metalloproteinase]]s, which prevents them from breaking down the fibrotic material in the extracellular [[matrix (biology)|matrix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Iredale JP |title=Cirrhosis: new research provides a basis for rational and targeted treatments |journal=BMJ |volume=327 |issue=7407 |pages=143–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12869458 |pmc=1126509 |doi=10.1136/bmj.327.7407.143 |url=http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/327/7407/143 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029175310/http://bmj.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/327/7407/143 |archivedate=2004-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Puche|first=JE|author2=Saiman, Y |author3=Friedman, SL |title=Hepatic stellate cells and liver fibrosis.|journal=Comprehensive Physiology|date=Oct 1, 2013|volume=3|issue=4|pages=1473–92|pmid=24265236|doi=10.1002/cphy.c120035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this cascade of processes continues, fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate hepatocyte nodules, which eventually replace the entire liver architecture, leading to decreased blood flow throughout. The [[spleen]] becomes congested, which leads to [[hypersplenism]] and the spleen's retention of [[platelet]]s, which are needed for normal blood clotting. Portal hypertension is responsible for the most severe complications of cirrhosis.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Cirrhosis high mag.jpg|thumb|[[Micrograph]] showing cirrhosis. [[Trichrome stain]].]]
The [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for diagnosis of cirrhosis is a [[liver biopsy]], through a [[percutaneous]], [[jugular|transjugular]], [[laparoscopic]], or fine-needle approach. A biopsy is not necessary if the clinical, laboratory, and radiologic data suggests cirrhosis. Furthermore, there is a small but significant risk of complications from liver biopsy, and cirrhosis itself predisposes for complications caused by liver biopsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grant |first=A |author2=Neuberger J |year=1999 |title=Guidelines on the use of liver biopsy in clinical practice |journal=Gut |volume=45 |issue=Suppl 4 |pages=1–11 |pmid=10485854 |url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/45/suppl_4/IV1 |quote=The main cause of mortality after percutaneous liver biopsy is intraperitoneal haemorrhage as shown in a retrospective Italian study of 68,000 percutaneous liver biopsies, in which all six patients who died did so from intraperitoneal haemorrhage.

The best predictors of cirrhosis are ascites, platelet count &lt;160,000/mm3, spider angiomata, and a Bonacini cirrhosis discriminant score greater than 7 (as the sum of scores for platelet count, [[Aminotransferase|ALT/AST]] ratio and [[Prothrombin time|INR]] as per table).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Udell|first=JA |author2=Wang, CS |author3=Tinmouth, J |author4=FitzGerald, JM |author5=Ayas, NT |author6=Simel, DL |author7=Schulzer, M |author8=Mak, E |author9=Yoshida, EM|title=Does this patient with liver disease have cirrhosis?|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=Feb 22, 2012|volume=307|issue=8|pages=832–42|pmid=22357834|doi=10.1001/jama.2012.186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lab findings===
The following findings are typical in cirrhosis:
* [[Thrombocytopenia]] - typically multifactorial. Due to alcoholic marrow suppression, sepsis, lack of folate, platelet sequestering in the spleen as well as decreased [[thrombopoietin]].&lt;ref name="Book. Current Med Diagnosis" /&gt; However, this rarely results in a platelet count &lt; 50 000/mL.&lt;ref name="Maddrey 1999 Evaluation of the Liver A: Laboratory Test"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maddrey|first=edited by Eugene R. Schiff, Michael F. Sorrell &amp; Willis C.|title=Schiff's diseases of the liver.|year=1999|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester, West Sussex, UK|isbn=978-0-470-65468-2|pages=Evaluation of the Liver A: Laboratory Test|edition=11th ed. / edited by Eugene R. Schiff, Willis C. Maddrey, Michael F. Sorrell.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Aminotransferase]]s – AST and ALT are moderately elevated, with AST &gt; ALT. However, normal aminotransferase levels do not preclude cirrhosis.&lt;ref name="Book. Current Med Diagnosis" /&gt;
* [[Alkaline phosphatase]] – slightly elevated but less than 2–3 times the upper limit of normal.
* [[Gamma-glutamyl transferase]]&amp;nbsp;– correlates with AP levels. Typically much higher in chronic liver disease from alcohol.&lt;ref name="Maddrey 1999 Evaluation of the Liver A: Laboratory Test"/&gt;
* [[Bilirubin]] – Levels normal when compensated but may elevate as cirrhosis progresses.
* [[Albumin]] – levels fall as the synthetic function of the liver declines with worsening cirrhosis, since albumin is exclusively synthesized in the liver
* [[Prothrombin time]] – increases, since the liver synthesizes clotting factors.
* [[Globulin]]s – increased due to shunting of bacterial antigens away from the liver to lymphoid tissue.
* Serum [[sodium]] – [[hyponatremia]] due to inability to excrete free water resulting from high levels of [[vasopressin|ADH]] and [[aldosterone]].
* [[Leukopenia]] and [[neutropenia]] – due to splenomegaly with splenic margination.
* [[Coagulation]] defects – the liver produces most of the coagulation factors and thus coagulopathy correlates with worsening liver disease.
*Glucagon - increased in cirrhosis&lt;ref name="Harrison's Cirrhosis Section" /&gt;
*Vasoactive intestinal peptide - increased as blood is shunted in the intestinal system because of portal hypertension
*Vasodilators - increased (such as nitric oxide and carbon monoxide) reducing afterload with compensatory increase in cardiac output, mixed venous oxygen saturation&lt;ref name="Primary care guidelines" /&gt;
*Renin - increased (as well as sodium retention in kidneys) secondary to fall in systemic vascular resistance&lt;ref name="Liver disease and the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis" /&gt;

[[FibroTest]] is a biomarker for fibrosis that can be done instead of a biopsy.&lt;ref name="pmid18973844"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Halfon P, Munteanu M, Poynard T |title= FibroTest-ActiTest as a non-invasive marker of liver fibrosis  |journal= Gastroenterol Clin Biol |volume=32|issue=6 |pages=22–39 |year=2008 |pmid= 18973844 |doi=10.1016/S0399-8320(08)73991-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other laboratory studies performed in newly diagnosed cirrhosis may include:
* Serology for [[hepatitis]] viruses, [[autoantibody|autoantibodies]] ([[Anti-nuclear antibody|ANA]], anti-smooth muscle, [[Anti-mitochondrial antibody|anti-mitochondria]], anti-LKM)
* [[Ferritin]] and [[transferrin saturation]]: markers of iron overload as in hemochromatosis, [[copper]] and [[ceruloplasmin]]: markers of copper overload as in Wilson's disease
* [[Immunoglobulin]] levels (IgG, IgM, IgA) – these immunoglobins are non-specific, but may help in distinguishing various causes
* [[Cholesterol]] and [[glucose]]
* [[Alpha 1-antitrypsin]]

===Imaging===
[[File:Doppler ultrasonography of the portal vein in cirrhosis.jpg|thumb|[[Doppler ultrasonography]] of the [[portal vein]] over 5 seconds, showing peaks of maximal velocity, as well as points of minimal velocity.]]
[[Medical ultrasonography|Ultrasound]] is routinely used in the evaluation of cirrhosis. It may show a small and nodular liver in advanced cirrhosis along with increased echogenicity with irregular appearing areas. Other liver findings suggestive of cirrhosis in imaging are an enlarged [[caudate lobe]], widening of the fissures and enlargement of the [[spleen]]. An enlarged spleen ([[splenomegaly]]), which normally measures less than 11–12&amp;nbsp;cm in adults, is suggestive of cirrhosis with [[portal hypertension]], in the right clinical context. Ultrasound may also screen for hepatocellular carcinoma, portal hypertension, and [[Budd-Chiari syndrome]] (by assessing flow in the hepatic vein). An increased [[portal vein]] pulsatility is an indicator of cirrhosis, but may also be caused by an increased right atrial pressure.&lt;ref name="IranpourLall2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iranpour|first1=Pooya|last2=Lall|first2=Chandana|last3=Houshyar|first3=Roozbeh|last4=Helmy|first4=Mohammad|last5=Yang|first5=Albert|last6=Choi|first6=Joon-Il|last7=Ward|first7=Garrett|last8=Goodwin|first8=Scott C|title=Altered Doppler flow patterns in cirrhosis patients: an overview|journal=Ultrasonography|volume=35|issue=1|year=2016|pages=3–12|issn=2288-5919|doi=10.14366/usg.15020}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portal vein pulsatility can be quantified by pulsatility indices (PI), where an index above a certain cutoff indicates pathology:

Cirrhosis is diagnosed with a variety of [[elastography]] techniques. Because a cirrhotic liver is generally stiffer than a healthy one, imaging the liver's stiffness can give diagnostic information about the location and severity of cirrhosis. Techniques used include [[transient elastography]], [[acoustic radiation force impulse imaging]], [[supersonic shear imaging]] and [[magnetic resonance elastography]]. Compared to a biopsy, elastography can sample a much larger area and is painless. It shows a reasonable correlation with the severity of cirrhosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Foucher J, Chanteloup E, Vergniol J |title=Diagnosis of cirrhosis by transient elastography (FibroScan): a prospective study |journal=Gut |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=403–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16020491 |doi=10.1136/gut.2005.069153 |pmc=1856085|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other tests performed in particular circumstances include abdominal [[Computed tomography|CT]] and liver/bile duct [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] ([[Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography|MRCP]]).

File:Hepatofugal flow in portal vein.jpg|Hepatofugal flow in portal vein in ultrasound
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Endoscopy===
[[Gastroscopy]] (endoscopic examination of the esophagus, stomach, and [[duodenum]]) is performed in patients with established cirrhosis to exclude the possibility of esophageal varices. If these are found, prophylactic local therapy may be applied (sclerotherapy or banding) and [[beta blocker]] treatment may be commenced.

Rarely are diseases of the bile ducts, such as [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]], causes of cirrhosis. Imaging of the bile ducts, such as [[endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography|ERCP]] or [[Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography|MRCP]] (MRI of biliary tract and pancreas) may aid in the diagnosis.

===Pathology===
[[File:Hepatocellular carcinoma 1.jpg|thumb|right|Cirrhosis leading to hepatocellular carcinoma (autopsy specimen)]]
Macroscopically, the liver is initially enlarged, but with the progression of the disease, it becomes smaller. Its surface is irregular, the consistency is firm, and the color is often yellow (if associated with [[steatosis]]). Depending on the size of the nodules, there are three macroscopic types: micronodular, macronodular, and mixed cirrhosis. In the micronodular form (Laennec's cirrhosis or portal cirrhosis), regenerating nodules are under 3&amp;nbsp;mm. In macronodular cirrhosis (post-necrotic cirrhosis), the nodules are larger than 3&amp;nbsp;mm. Mixed cirrhosis consists of nodules of different sizes.

However, cirrhosis is defined by its pathological features on microscopy: (1) the presence of regenerating nodules of hepatocytes and (2) the presence of [[fibrosis]], or the deposition of [[connective tissue]] between these nodules.  The pattern of fibrosis seen can depend on the underlying insult that led to cirrhosis. Fibrosis can also proliferate even if the underlying process that caused it has resolved or ceased.  The fibrosis in cirrhosis can lead to destruction of other normal tissues in the liver: including the [[sinusoids]], the [[space of Disse]], and other vascular structures, which leads to altered resistance to blood flow in the liver, and [[portal hypertension]].&lt;ref name=Yamada&gt;{{cite book |last=Brenner |first=David |author2=Richard A. Rippe|chapter=Pathogenesis of Hepatic Fibrosis |title=Textbook of Gastroenterology |editor=[[Tadataka Yamada]] |edition=4th |volume=2 |year=2003 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |isbn=978-0-7817-2861-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As cirrhosis can be caused by many different entities which injure the liver in different ways, cause-specific abnormalities may be seen. For example, in [[chronic hepatitis B]], there is infiltration of the liver parenchyma with [[lymphocytes]].&lt;ref name=Yamada/&gt; In [[cardiac cirrhosis]] there are [[erythrocytes]] and a greater amount of fibrosis in the tissue surrounding the [[hepatic vein]]s.&lt;ref name=CardiacCirrhosis&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giallourakis CC, Rosenberg PM, Friedman LS |title=The liver in heart failure |journal=Clin Liver Dis |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=947–67, viii–ix |date=November 2002 |pmid=12516201 |doi= 10.1016/S1089-3261(02)00056-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[primary biliary cholangitis]], there is fibrosis around the bile duct, the presence of [[granulomas]] and pooling of [[bile]].&lt;ref name=Heathcote&gt;{{cite journal |author=Heathcote EJ |title=Primary biliary cirrhosis: historical perspective |journal=Clin Liver Dis |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=735–40 |date=November 2003 |pmid=14594128 |doi= 10.1016/S1089-3261(03)00098-9|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly in alcoholic cirrhosis, there is infiltration of the liver with [[neutrophil]]s.&lt;ref name=Yamada/&gt;

===Grading===
The severity of cirrhosis is commonly classified with the [[Child-Pugh score]]. This scoring system uses [[bilirubin]], [[human serum albumin|albumin]], [[prothrombin time|INR]], the presence and severity of [[ascites]], and [[Hepatic encephalopathy|encephalopathy]] to classify patients into class A, B, or C. Class A has a favourable prognosis, while class C is at high risk of death. This system was devised in 1964 by Child and Turcotte, and modified in 1973 by Pugh and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pugh RN, Murray-Lyon IM, Dawson JL, Pietroni MC, Williams R |title=Transection of the oesophagus for bleeding oesophageal varices |journal=Br J Surg |volume=60 |issue=8 |pages=646–9 |year=1973 |pmid=4541913 |doi= 10.1002/bjs.1800600817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More modern scores, used in the allocation of [[liver transplant]]s but also in other contexts, are the [[Model for End-Stage Liver Disease]] (MELD) score and its pediatric counterpart, the [[Pediatric End-Stage Liver Disease]] (PELD) score.

The hepatic venous pressure gradient, (difference in [[venous pressure]] between [[afferent arteriole|afferent]] and [[Efferent arterioles|efferent]] blood to the liver) also determines the severity of cirrhosis, although it is hard to measure. A value of 16&amp;nbsp;mm or more means a greatly increased risk of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Patch D, Armonis A, Sabin C |title=Single portal pressure measurement predicts survival in cirrhotic patients with recent bleeding |journal=Gut |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=264–9 |year=1999 |pmid=9895388 |pmc=1727391 |doi=10.1136/gut.44.2.264 |url=http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/44/2/264 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528225834/http://gut.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/44/2/264 |archivedate=2008-05-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Key prevention strategies for cirrhosis are population-wide interventions to reduce alcohol intake (through pricing strategies, public health campaigns, and personal counseling), programs to reduce the transmission of viral hepatitis, and screening of relatives of people with hereditary liver diseases.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Little is known about factors affecting cirrhosis risk and progression. Research has suggested that coffee consumption appears to help protect against cirrhosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muriel|first1=P|last2=Arauz|first2=J|title=Coffee and liver diseases.|journal=Fitoterapia (Phytotherapy)|date=Jul 2010|volume=81|issue=5|pages=297–305|pmid=19825397|doi=10.1016/j.fitote.2009.10.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Masterton GS, Hayes PC |title=Coffee and the liver: a potential treatment for liver disease? |journal=Eur J Gastroenterol Hepatol |volume=22 |issue=11 |pages=1277–83 |date=November 2010  |pmid=20802342 |doi=10.1097/MEG.0b013e32833cca96 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Generally, liver damage from cirrhosis cannot be reversed, but treatment can stop or delay further progression and reduce complications. A healthy diet is encouraged, as cirrhosis may be an energy-consuming process. Close follow-up is often necessary. Antibiotics are prescribed for infections, and various medications can help with itching. Laxatives, such as [[lactulose]], decrease the risk of constipation; their role in preventing encephalopathy is limited.

Alcoholic cirrhosis caused by alcohol abuse is treated by abstaining from alcohol. Treatment for hepatitis-related cirrhosis involves medications used to treat the different types of hepatitis, such as interferon for viral hepatitis and corticosteroids for autoimmune hepatitis. Cirrhosis caused by [[Wilson's disease]], in which copper builds up in organs, is treated with [[chelation therapy]] (for example, [[penicillamine]]) to remove the copper.

===Preventing further liver damage===
Regardless of the underlying cause of cirrhosis, consumption of alcohol and [[paracetamol]], as well as other potentially damaging substances, are discouraged. Vaccination of susceptible patients should be considered for [[Hepatitis A]] and [[Hepatitis B]].
Treating the cause of cirrhosis prevents further damage; for example, giving oral antivirals such as [[entecavir]] and [[tenofovir]] in patients of cirrhosis due to [[Hepatitis B]] prevents progression of cirrhosis. Similarly, control of weight and diabetes prevents deterioration in cirrhosis due to [[Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis]].

===Transplantation===
{{Main|Liver transplantation}}
If complications cannot be controlled or when the liver ceases functioning, [[liver transplantation]] is necessary. Survival from liver transplantation has been improving over the 1990s, and the five-year survival rate is now around 80%. The survival rate depends largely on the severity of disease and other medical risk factors in the recipient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emedicinehealth.com/liver_transplant/page11_em.htm |title=E-medicine liver transplant outlook and survival rates |publisher=Emedicinehealth.com |date=2009-06-09 |accessdate=2009-09-06 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714145002/http://www.emedicinehealth.com/liver_transplant/page11_em.htm |archivedate=2009-07-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Model for End-Stage Liver Disease|MELD score]] is used to prioritize patients for transplantation.&lt;ref name=Kamath&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kamath PS, Kim WR |title=The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) |journal=Hepatology |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=797–805 |date=March 2007 |pmid=17326206 |doi=10.1002/hep.21563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transplantation necessitates the use of immune suppressants ([[ciclosporin]] or [[tacrolimus]]).

===Decompensated cirrhosis===
Manifestations of [[decompensation]] in cirrhosis include [[gastrointestinal bleeding]], [[hepatic encephalopathy]] (HE), [[jaundice]] or [[ascites]]. In patients with previously stable cirrhosis, decompensation may occur due to various causes, such as [[constipation]], [[infection]] (of any source), increased alcohol intake, [[medication]], bleeding from [[esophageal varices]] or dehydration. It may take the form of any of the complications of cirrhosis listed below.

People with decompensated cirrhosis generally require admission to a hospital, with close monitoring of the [[fluid balance]], mental status, and emphasis on adequate nutrition and medical treatment – often with [[diuretic]]s, [[antibiotic]]s, [[laxative]]s or [[enema]]s, [[thiamine]] and occasionally [[glucocorticoid|steroids]], [[acetylcysteine]] and [[pentoxifylline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chavez-Tapia |first1=NC |last2=Barrientos-Gutierrez |first2=T |last3=Tellez-Avila |first3=FI |last4=Soares-Weiser |first4=K |last5=Uribe |first5=M |title=Antibiotic prophylaxis for cirrhotic patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. |journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |date=8 September 2010 |issue=9 |pages=CD002907 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD002907.pub2 |pmid=20824832}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administration of [[saline (medicine)|saline]] is avoided, as it would add to the already high total body sodium content that typically occurs in cirrhosis. Life expectancy without liver transplant is low, at most 3 years.

===Palliative care===

[[Palliative care]] is specialized medical care that focuses on providing patients with relief from the symptoms, pain, and stress of a serious illness, such as cirrhosis. The goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life for both the patient and the patient's family and it is appropriate at any stage and for any type of cirrhosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrell|first1=B|last2=Connor|first2=SR|last3=Cordes|first3=A|last4=Dahlin|first4=CM|last5=Fine|first5=PG|last6=Hutton|first6=N|last7=Leenay|first7=M|last8=Lentz|first8=J|last9=Person|first9=JL|last10=Meier|first10=DE|last11=Zuroski|first11=K|last12=National Consensus Project for Quality Palliative Care Task Force|first12=Members|title=The national agenda for quality palliative care: the National Consensus Project and the National Quality Forum.|journal=Journal of Pain and Symptom Management|date=Jun 2007|volume=33|issue=6|pages=737–44|pmid=17531914|doi=10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2007.02.024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ascites===
Salt restriction is often necessary, as cirrhosis leads to accumulation of salt (sodium retention). [[Diuretic]]s may be necessary to suppress [[ascites]]. Diuretic options for inpatient treatment include [[aldosterone antagonist]]s ([[spironolactone]]) and [[loop diuretic]]s. Aldosterone antagonists are preferred for people who can take oral medications and are not in need of an urgent volume reduction. Loop diuretics can be added as additional therapy.&lt;ref name=BSGascites&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moore KP, Aithal GP |title=Guidelines on the management of ascites in cirrhosis |journal=Gut |volume=55 Suppl 6 |issue= Suppl 6|pages=vi1–12 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16966752 |pmc=1860002 |doi=10.1136/gut.2006.099580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a rapid reduction of volume is required, [[paracentesis]] is the preferred option. This procedure requires the insertion of a plastic tube into the peritoneal cavity. Human albumin solution is usually given to prevent complications from the rapid volume reduction. In addition to being more rapid than diuretics, 4–5 liters of paracentesis is more successful in comparison to diuretic therapy.&lt;ref name=BSGascites/&gt;

===Esophageal variceal bleeding===
For portal hypertension, nonselective [[beta blocker]]s such as [[propranolol]] or [[nadolol]] are commonly used to lower blood pressure over the portal system. In severe complications from portal hypertension, [[transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt]]ing (TIPS) is occasionally indicated to relieve pressure on the portal vein. As this shunting can worsen hepatic encephalopathy, it is reserved for those patients at low risk of encephalopathy. TIPS is generally regarded only as a bridge to liver transplantation or as a palliative measure.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Hepatic encephalopathy===
High-protein food increases the [[nitrogen balance]], and would theoretically increase [[hepatic encephalopathy]]; in the past, this was therefore eliminated as much as possible from the diet. Recent studies show that this assumption was incorrect, and high-protein foods are even ''encouraged'' to maintain adequate nutrition.&lt;ref name=Sundaram&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sundaram V, Shaikh OS |title=Hepatic encephalopathy: pathophysiology and emerging therapies |journal=Med. Clin. North Am. |volume=93 |issue=4 |pages=819–36, vii |date=July 2009|pmid=19577116 |doi=10.1016/j.mcna.2009.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hepatorenal syndrome===
The [[hepatorenal syndrome]] is defined as a urine sodium less than 10&amp;nbsp;mmol/L and a [[serum creatinine]] &gt; 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/dl (or 24 hour [[creatinine clearance]] less than 40 ml/min) after a trial of volume expansion without diuretics.&lt;ref name="pmid3297907"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ginés P, Arroyo V, Quintero E |title=Comparison of paracentesis and diuretics in the treatment of cirrhotics with tense ascites. Results of a randomized study |journal=Gastroenterology |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=234–41 |year=1987 |pmid=3297907 |doi=|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis===
People with [[ascites]] due to cirrhosis are at risk of [[spontaneous bacterial peritonitis]].

===Portal hypertensive gastropathy===
This refers to changes in the [[mucosa]] of the [[stomach]] in people with portal hypertension, and is associated with cirrhosis severity.&lt;ref name="pmid20407828"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kim MY, Choi H, Baik SK | title = Portal Hypertensive Gastropathy: Correlation with Portal Hypertension and Prognosis in Cirrhosis | journal = Dig Dis Sci | volume = 55| issue = 12| pages = 3561–7|date=April 2010 | pmid = 20407828 | doi = 10.1007/s10620-010-1221-6 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infection===
Cirrhosis can cause immune system dysfunction, leading to [[infection]]. Signs and symptoms of infection may be nonspecific and are more difficult to recognize (for example, worsening encephalopathy but no fever).

===Hepatocellular carcinoma===
[[Hepatocellular carcinoma]] is a primary liver cancer that is more common in people with cirrhosis. People with known cirrhosis are often screened intermittently for early signs of this tumor, and screening has been shown to improve outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singal AG, Pillai A, Tiro J | year=2014| title= Early detection, curative treatment, and survival rates for hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance in patients with cirrhosis: a meta-analysis | journal=PLoS Med | volume=11 | issue=4 | pages=e1001624 | pmid=    24691105 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.1001624 | pmc=3972088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Cirrhosis and chronic liver disease were the tenth leading cause of death for men and the twelfth for women in the United States in 2001, killing about 27,000 people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson RN, Smith BL |title=Deaths: leading causes for 2001 |journal=National Vital Statistics Reports | publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|volume=52 |issue=9 |pages=1–85 |year=2003 |pmid=14626726 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of cirrhosis in terms of human suffering, hospital costs, and lost productivity is high. Cirrhosis is more common in men than in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fifth Edition: Diseases of the Human Body|last=Tamparo|first=Carol|publisher=F. A. Davis Company|year=2011|isbn=978-0-8036-2505-1|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Established cirrhosis has a 10-year mortality of 34–66%, largely dependent on the cause of the cirrhosis; alcoholic cirrhosis has a worse prognosis than primary biliary cholangitis and cirrhosis due to hepatitis. The risk of death due to all causes is increased twelvefold; if one excludes the direct consequences of the liver disease, there is still a fivefold increased risk of death in all disease categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sørensen HT, Thulstrup AM, Mellemkjar L |title=Long-term survival and cause-specific mortality in patients with cirrhosis of the liver: a nationwide cohort study in Denmark |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=56 |issue=1 |pages=88–93 |year=2003 |pmid=12589875| doi = 10.1016/S0895-4356(02)00531-0|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The word "cirrhosis" is a neologism derived from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''kirrhós'' meaning "yellowish, tawny" (the orange-yellow colour of the diseased liver) and the suffix ''-osis'', i.e. "condition" in medical terminology. While the clinical entity was known before, it was [[René Laennec]] who gave it this name (in the same 1819 work in which he also described the [[stethoscope]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Roguin A |title=Rene Theophile Hyacinthe Laënnec (1781–1826): The Man Behind the Stethoscope |journal=Clinical Medicine &amp; Research |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=230–5 |year=2006 |pmid=17048358 |doi=10.3121/cmr.4.3.230 |pmc=1570491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''healthcare center''', '''health center''', or '''community health center''' is one of a network of clinics staffed by a group of [[general practitioner]]s and [[nurse]]s providing healthcare services to people in a certain area. Typical services covered are family practice and dental care,{{clarify|reason=The scope of "family practice" varies and may or may not differ from "general practice".|date=August 2014}} but some clinics have expanded greatly and can include internal medicine, pediatric, women’s care, family planning, pharmacy, optometry, laboratory testing, and more. In countries with [[universal healthcare]], most people use the healthcare centers. In countries without universal healthcare, the clients include the uninsured, underinsured, low-income or those living in areas where little access to primary health care is available.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==Community health centres by country==

===Canada===
Community Health Centers (CHCs) have existed in [[Ontario]] for more than 40 years.&lt;ref name="OCHC" /&gt; The first established CHC in Canada was Mount Carmel Clinic in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cachc.ca/about-chcs/|title=About Community Health Centres {{!}} CACHC {{!}} ACCSC|website=www.cachc.ca|access-date=2018-09-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180223202946/https://www.cachc.ca/about-chcs/|archive-date=2018-02-23|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most CHC's consist of an interdisciplinary team of health care providers using electronic health records.&lt;ref name=OCHC&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Association of Ontario Health Centres | url=http://www.ontariochc.org/index.php?ci_id=2341&amp;la_id=1 | title=Association of Ontario Health Centres | date=2013-09-24 | accessdate=2013-09-24 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927114958/http://www.ontariochc.org/index.php?ci_id=2341&amp;la_id=1 | archive-date=2013-09-27 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Quebec]], local community services centres known by their French acronym, [[CLSC]], offer routine health and social services, including consultations with [[general practitioner]]s with and without an appointment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.santemontreal.qc.ca/en/where-to-go/local-community-services-centres-clscs/ |title=Local Community Services Centres (CLSCs) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2014 |website=Santé Montréal Portal |publisher=Gouvernement du Québec |accessdate=2014-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812214627/http://www.santemontreal.qc.ca/en/where-to-go/local-community-services-centres-clscs/ |archive-date=2014-08-12 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
[[File:Jimenli Community Health Service Centre (20170823102526).jpg|thumb|Jimenli community health service center in [[Haidian District]], [[Beijing]] in 2017]]
In China there are, as of 2011, 32,812 community health centers and 37,374 [[Townships of the People's Republic of China|township]] health centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/newsandcomingevents/t20120222_402786587.htm |title=Statistical Communiqué on the 2011 National Economic and Social Development |date=2012-02-22 |accessdate=2012-09-05 |work=stats.gov.cn |publisher=[[National Bureau of Statistics of China]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806094456/http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/newsandcomingevents/t20120222_402786587.htm |archivedate=August 6, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portugal===
The health center ({{lang-pt|centro de saúde}}) was the basic community [[primary healthcare]] unit of the [[Health in Portugal|National Health Service]] of [[Portugal]], as well as acting as the local [[public health]] authority. Usually, each health center covered the area of one of the Portuguese municipalities, but municipalities with over 15 000 habitants could be covered by more than one of these centers. Health centers were staffed with [[general practitioners]], [[Professional degrees of public health|public health physicians]], [[nurse]]s, [[social work]]ers and administrative personnel.

In 2008, the more than 300 health centers were aggregated into around 70 health center groups (''agrupamentos de centros de saúde'') or ACES. Each ACES includes several [[family medicine|family and personalized healthcare]] units, these being now the basic primary health care providers of the Portuguese National Health Service. Besides family health care services, the ACES also include [[public health]], [[community health]] and other specialized units, as well as basic medical emergency services.

Some of the ACES were grouped with hospital units into experimental local health units (''unidades locais de saúde'') or ULS. The ULS are intended to increase the coordination between the primary and the secondary healthcare, through both of these services being provided by the same health unit.

===United Kingdom===

[[Lord Dawson of Penn]] was commissioned by [[Christopher Addison, 1st Viscount Addison|Lord Addison]] to produce a report on "schemes requisite for the systematised provision of such forms of medical and allied services as should... be available for the inhabitants of a given area". The Interim Report on the Future Provision of Medical and Allied Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interim Report on the Future Provision of Medical and Allied Services 1920 (Lord Dawson of Penn) |author=Consultative Council on Medical and Allied Services |date=27 May 1920 |url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/healthcare-generally/history-of-healthcare/interim-report-on-the-future-provision-of-medical-and-allied-services-1920-lord-dawson-of-penn/ |website=Socialist Health Association |accessdate=21 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224093354/http://www.sochealth.co.uk/healthcare-generally/history-of-healthcare/interim-report-on-the-future-provision-of-medical-and-allied-services-1920-lord-dawson-of-penn/ |archive-date=2013-12-24 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  was produced in 1920, though no further report ever appeared. The report laid down detailed plans for a network of Primary and Secondary Health Centres, together with detailed architectural drawings of different sorts of centres. By 1939 the term health centre was widely used to refer to new buildings housing local health authority services.&lt;ref name=Webster1988&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Charles|title=The Health Services Since the War|date=1988|publisher=HMSO|location=London|isbn=0-11-630942-3|pages=380, 386}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|380}} The Dawson report was very influential in debates about the [[National Health Service]] when it was set up in 1948, but few centres were built because "it was not practicable for local authorities to establish health centres without the full compliance of general practitioners" - which was not forthcoming. Far more attention and resources were devoted to hospital services than to primary care. From 1948 to 1974 local authorities were responsible for the building of health centres.

A well known centre was opened at [[Woodberry Down]] in October 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Woodberry Down Health Centre|journal=British Medical Journal|date=18 October 1952|volume=1952|issue=2|page=879|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/2/4789/879.2|access-date=2014-10-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924041614/http://www.bmj.com/content/2/4789/879.2|archive-date=2015-09-24|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It had provision for 6 GPs, 2 dentists, a pharmacist and two nurses.  It cost about £163,000, which included the cost of a day nursery and child guidance clinic.  This was regarded as extravagant and used as an excuse by critics for not building more.  [[Harlow]], where 4 centres were built by the new town corporation, was the only community in Britain served exclusively by doctors working from health centres.&lt;ref name=Webster1988/&gt;{{rp|386}}

The few centres that were built "functioned as isolated islands in a sea of General Practitioners generally indifferent to their success".  There were later calls to establish a network of centres to include not only GPs but also dentists and diagnostic facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case for Health Centres 1964|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/socialist-health-association-policy/the-case-for-health-centres-1964/|website=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=18 October 2014|date=11 March 1964|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505233850/http://www.sochealth.co.uk/socialist-health-association-policy/the-case-for-health-centres-1964/|archive-date=2015-05-05|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965 there were only 30 health centres in England and Wales, and 3 in Scotland.  By 1974 there were 566 in England, 29 in Wales and 59 in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Charles|title=The National Health Service A Political History|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-289296-7|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[National Health Service Reorganisation Act 1973]], responsibility for promoting health centres was transferred to Area Health Authorities and there were renewed calls to establish more Health Centres.&lt;ref name=SHA1975&gt;{{cite web |title=Health Centres the Next Step 1975 |url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/socialist-health-association-policy/health-centres-the-next-step-1975/ |website=Socialist Health Association |date=10 March 1975 |accessdate=1 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506010800/http://www.sochealth.co.uk/socialist-health-association-policy/health-centres-the-next-step-1975/ |archive-date=2015-05-06 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was suggested that these centres could arrange alternative medical care for patients "when their doctor is off duty, or for emergency calls when he is engaged elsewhere".&lt;ref name=SHA1975/&gt;

[[Lord Darzi]] set up a network of [[Polyclinics in England]] when he was a minister in 2008.  These clinics had some features in common with earlier proposals for health centres, but shared with them considerable resistance from GPs.

===United States===
{{Main|Community health centers in the United States}}
A [[community health]] center is a not-for-profit, consumer directed healthcare organization that provides access to high quality, affordable, and comprehensive primary and preventive medical, dental, and mental health care. Community health centers have a unique mission of ensuring access for underserved, underinsured and uninsured patients.

In the U.S., Community Health Centers (CHCs) are neighborhood health centers generally serving Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs) which includes persons who are uninsured, underinsured, low-income or those living in areas where little access to primary health care is available.  Largely federally and locally funded, some health clinics are modernized with new equipment and electronic medical records. In 2006, the National Association of Community Health Centers implemented a model for offering free, rapid HIV testing to all patients between the ages of 13 and 64 during routine primary medical and dental care visits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |url=https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/community-health-centers-integrate-rapid-hiv-screening-routine-primary-care-leading |title=Community Health Centers Integrate Rapid HIV Screening Into Routine Primary Care, Leading to Significant Increases in Testing Rates |date=2013-05-08 |accessdate=2013-05-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909023121/https://innovations.ahrq.gov/profiles/community-health-centers-integrate-rapid-hiv-screening-routine-primary-care-leading |archive-date=2015-09-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medically Underserved Areas/Populations are areas or populations designated by the [[Health Resources and Services Administration]] (HRSA) as having: too few primary care providers, high infant mortality, high poverty and/or high elderly population. Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) are designated by HRSA as having shortages of primary medical care, dental or mental health providers and may be geographic (a county or service area), demographic (low income population) or institutional (comprehensive health center, federally qualified health center or other public facility).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1133">A '''cutaneous sinus of dental origin''' is where a [[Odontogenic_infection|dental infection]] drains onto the surface of the skin of the face or neck. This is uncommon as usually dental infections drain into the mouth, typically forming a [[parulis]] ("gumboil").

Cutaneous sinuses of dental origin tend to occur under the chin or [[mandible]]. Without elimination of the source of the infection, the lesion tends to have a relapsing and remitting course, with healing periods and periods of purulent discharge.

Cutaneous sinus tracts may result in [[fibrosis]] and scarring which may cause cosmetic concern. Sometimes minor surgery is carried out to remove the residual lesion.&lt;ref name="Eversole2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eversole LR|title=Clinical Outline of Oral Pathology: Diagnosis and Treatment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XTp9x7skwfoC&amp;pg=PA85|date=1 November 2001|publisher=PMPH-USA|isbn=978-1-55009-208-0|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dental Technologists Association''' (DTA) is the [[professional body]] representing [[dental technicians]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

== History ==
The association began life as the '''Dental Technicians Education and Training Advisory Board''' (DTETAB) and was established by the [[General Dental Council]] (GDC). The remit of DTETAB was to review and make recommendations about the education and training of dental technicians, the suitability of that training and how it would fit with the demands of providing dental services. The other main role for DTETAB was maintaining a Voluntary Register of Dental Technicians, which served as the precursor to the GDC statutory register. The inaugural meeting of the Board took place in January 1986 and was chaired by Margaret Seward (later [[Dame (title)|Dame]] Margaret Seward). The GDC was only actively involved for the first three years and DTETAB became an independent professional body in 1989 with Colin Lee, a dental technician and laboratory owner from north west England, as chairman. Ray Cox was appointed as registrar and served until his retirement in 1992 when he was succeeded by Sue Adams.

Anticipating a slightly different role post statutory registration, DTETAB became the '''Dental Technicians Association''' in 2002. The final name change came in 2006 when the association became the '''Dental Technologists Association'''.

== Offices ==
The headquarters of the DTA is based at F13a Kestrel Court, Waterwells Drive, Waterwells Business Park, Gloucester GL2 2AT. The Chief Executive of the association is Sue Adams, who is responsible for the office, administration and support to the council and provides the first point of contact for members.

== Council ==
The DTA council is the governing body of the association. Delroy Reeves is president, John Stacey is deputy president and former president Tony Griffin is treasurer. Other council members include immediate past president James Green as well as Gregg Clutton, Andy George, Adrian Rollings, Gerrard Starnes and Barry Tivey.

'''Dental antibiotic prophylaxis''' is the administration of [[antibiotic]]s to a dental patient for prevention of harmful consequences of [[bacteremia]], that may be caused by invasion of the [[Mouth|oral]] [[flora]] into an injured [[gingival]] or peri-apical vessel during dental treatment.     
This issue remains a subject under constant revision, with the intention of providing recommendations based on sound scientific evidence.  
Currently, there are official guidelines for dental antibiotic prophylaxis for the prevention of [[infective endocarditis]] and of infection of prosthetic joint. These guidelines are in constant controversy and revisions by various professional committees. In addition, there are various medical conditions for which clinicians recommended antibiotic prophylaxis, although there is no evidence to support this practice. These conditions include [[renal dialysis]] [[shunt (medical)|shunt]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]] shunt, [[vascular graft]], [[immunosuppression]] secondary to [[cancer]] and [[cancer chemotherapy]], [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], and [[type 1 diabetes mellitus]].&lt;ref name="lock"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lockhart PB, Loven B, Brennan MT, Fox PC |title=The evidence base for the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in dental practice |journal=J Am Dent Assoc |volume=138 |issue=4 |pages=458–74 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17403736 |url=http://jada.ada.org/content/138/4/458.full.pdf+html |doi=10.14219/jada.archive.2007.0198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is of importance to dental patients and practitioners to remain current with regards to the latest recommendations rendered by professional governing bodies such as the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA), [[American Heart Association]] (AHA) and the American Association of Orthopaedic surgeons (AAOS).  [[Antibiotic prophylaxis]] is intended to avoid adverse outcomes in certain patients at "highest risk of postoperative complications."Standard antibiotic regimens are routinely prescribed and taken before dental procedures to avoid systemic complications secondary to the transient bacteremia caused by manipulation of the oral tissues.  Although the ADA, in collaboration with AHA and AAOS have published guidelines specifying those patients who should receive antibiotic prophylaxis, research continues to further define the role dental treatment may play in causing adverse outcomes in these patients.
In the past, bacteremia caused by dental procedures (in most cases due to [[Streptococcus viridans|viridans streptococci]], which reside in oral cavity), such as a cleaning or [[Extraction (dental)|extraction]] of a tooth was thought to be more clinically significant than it actually was. However, it is important that a dentist or a dental hygienist be told of any heart problems before commencing treatment. Antibiotics are administered to patients with certain heart conditions as a precaution, although this practice has changed in the US, with new American Heart Association guidelines released in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilson W, Taubert KA, Gewitz M |title=Prevention of infective endocarditis: guidelines from the American Heart Association |journal=Circulation |volume=116 |issue=15 |pages=1736–54 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17446442 |doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.183095 |url=http://circ.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17446442|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the UK as of March 2008 due to new NICE guidelines. Everyday tooth brushing and flossing will similarly cause bacteremia. Although there is little evidence to support antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment, the current AHA guidelines are highly accepted by clinicians&lt;ref name="dental"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zadik Y, Findler M, Livne S |title=Dentists' knowledge and implementation of the 2007 American Heart Association guidelines for prevention of infective endocarditis |journal=Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=e16–9 |date=December 2008 |pmid=19000604 |url=http://www.ooooe.net/article/S1079-2104(08)00597-0/abstract |doi=10.1016/j.tripleo.2008.08.009|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and patients.&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Elad S, Binenfeld-Alon E, Zadik Y, Aharoni M, Findler M |title=Survey of acceptance of the 2007 American Heart Association guidelines for the prevention of infective endocarditis: a pilot study|journal=Quintessence Int |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=243–51 |date=March 2011 |pmid=21465012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2016}}
The '''development of the reproductive system''' is a part of [[prenatal development]], and concerns the [[sex organs]]. It is a part of the stages of [[sexual differentiation]]. Because its location, to a large extent, overlaps the urinary system, the development of them can also be described together as the [[development of the urinary and reproductive organs]].

The reproductive organs are developed from the [[intermediate mesoderm]]. The permanent organs of the adult are preceded by a set of structures which are purely embryonic, and which with the exception of the ducts disappear almost entirely before the end of fetal life. These embryonic structures are the [[mesonephric duct]]s (also known as ''Wolffian ducts'') and the [[paramesonephric duct]]s, (also known as ''Müllerian ducts''). The mesonephric duct remains as the duct in males, and the paramesonephric duct as that of the female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlson|first1=Neil R.|title=Physiology of behavior |date=2013 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston 
|isbn=0205239390 |page=329 |edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mesonephric ducts==
{{Main|Mesonephric duct}}
The mesonephric duct originates from a part of the [[pronephric duct]].

===Origin===
In the outer part of the [[intermediate mesoderm]], immediately under the ectoderm, in the region from the fifth [[cervical segment]] to the third [[thoracic segment]], a series of short [[evagination]]s from each segment grows [[dorsally]] and extends [[caudally]], fusing successively from before backward to form the [[pronephric duct]]. This continues to grow caudally until it opens into the ventral part of the [[cloaca]]; beyond the [[pronephros]] it is termed the mesonephric duct. Thus, the mesonephric duct remains after the atrophy of the pronephros duct.

===Development in male===
In the male the duct persists, and forms the tube of the [[epididymis]], the [[vas deferens]] and the [[ejaculatory duct]], while the [[seminal vesicle]] arises during the third month as a lateral diverticulum from its hinder end. A large part of the head end of the mesonephros atrophies and disappears; of the remainder the anterior tubules form the efferent ducts of the [[testicle]]; while the posterior tubules are represented by the [[ductuli aberrantes]], and by the [[paradidymis]], which is sometimes found in front of the [[spermatic cord]] above the head of the epididymis.

===Atrophy in female===
In the female the mesonephric bodies and ducts atrophy. The nonfunctional remains of the [[mesonephric tubule]]s are represented by the [[epoophoron]], and the [[paroöphoron]], two small collections of [[Human vestigiality |rudimentary]] blind tubules which are situated in the [[mesosalpinx]].

====Remnants====
[[Image:Gray1106.png|thumb|500px|right| Section of the fold in the mesonephros of a chick embryo of the fourth day.]]

The lower part of the mesonephric duct disappears, while the upper part persists as the longitudinal duct of the [[epoöphoron]], called [[Gartner's duct]].

There are also developments of other tissues from the mesonephric duct that persist, e.g. the [[development of the suspensory ligament of the ovary]].

==Paramesonephric ducts==

* W. Left Wolffian body&lt;br&gt;
* w, w. Right and left mesonephric ducts.]]
{{Main|Paramesonephric duct}}
Shortly after the formation of the mesonephric ducts a second pair of ducts is developed; these are the [[paramesonephric duct]]s. Each arises on the lateral aspect of the corresponding mesonephric duct as a tubular invagination of the cells lining the abdominal cavity. The orifice of the invagination remains open, and undergoes enlargement and modification to form the abdominal [[ostium of the fallopian tube]]. The ducts pass backward lateral to the mesonephric ducts, but toward the posterior end of the embryo they cross to the medial side of these ducts, and thus come to lie side by side between and behind the latter—the four ducts forming what is termed the ''common genital cord''{{Citation  needed |date=February 2018}}, to distinguish it from the ''genital cords of the germinal epithelium''{{Citation needed |date=February 2018}} seen later in this article. The mesonephric ducts end in an epithelial elevation, the [[sinus tubercle]], on the ventral part of the cloaca between the orifices of the mesonephric ducts. At a later stage the sinus tubercle  opens in the middle, connecting the paramesonephric ducts with the cloaca.

===Atrophy in males===
In the male the paramesonephric ducts atrophy, but traces of their anterior ends are represented by the [[appendix of testis]] of the male), while their terminal fused portions form the [[prostatic utricle]] in the floor of the [[prostatic urethra]]. This is due to the production of [[Anti-Müllerian hormone]] by the [[Sertoli cells]] of the [[testes]].

===Development in females===
{{See |Sex cords}}
In the female the paramesonephric ducts persist and undergo further development. The portions which lie in the ''genital cord''{{Citation needed |date=February 2018}} fuse to form the [[uterus]]  and [[vagina]]. This fusion of the paramesonephric ducts begins in the third month, and the septum formed by their fused medial walls disappears from below upward.

The parts outside this cord remain separate, and each forms the corresponding [[Fallopian tube]]. The [[ostium of the fallopian tube]] remains from the anterior extremity of the original tubular invagination from the abdominal cavity.

About the fifth month a ring-like constriction marks the position of the [[cervix]] of the uterus, and after the sixth month the walls of the uterus begin to thicken. For a time the vagina is represented by a solid rod of epithelial cells. A ring-like outgrowth of this epithelium occurs at the lower end of the uterus and marks the future [[vaginal fornix]]. At about the fifth or sixth month the [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the vagina is produced by the breaking down of the central cells of the epithelium. The [[hymen]] represents the remains of the sinus tubercle .&lt;ref&gt;1918 Gray's Anatomy&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gonads==
{{Main|Development of the gonads}}
The gonads are the precursors of the [[testes]] in males and [[ovaries]] in females. They initially develop from the mesothelial layer of the peritoneum.

===Ovaries===
The ovary is differentiated into a central part, the medulla of ovary, covered by a surface layer, the germinal epithelium. The [[immature ova]] originate from cells from the dorsal [[endoderm]] of the [[yolk sac]]. Once they have reached the gonadal ridge they are called [[oogonia]]. Development proceeds and the oogonia become fully surrounded by a layer of connective tissue cells (pre-granulosa cells). In this way, the rudiments of the ovarian follicles are formed. The embryological origin of [[granulosa cells]], on the other hand, remains controversial. Just as in the male, there is a [[gubernaculum]] in the female, which pulls it downward, albeit not as much as in males. The gubernaculum later becomes the proper [[ovarian ligament]] and the [[round ligament of the uterus]].

===Testes===
The periphery of the testes are converted into the [[tunica albuginea (testicles)|tunica albuginea]]. Cords of the central mass run together and form a network which becomes the [[rete testis]], and another network, which develops the [[seminiferous tubules]]. Via the rete testis, the seminiferous tubules become connected with outgrowths from the mesonephros, which form the efferent ducts of the testis.

In short, the descent of the testes consists of the opening of a connection from the testis to its final location at the anterior abdominal wall, followed by the development of the gubernaculum, which subsequently pulls and translocates the testis down into the developing scrotum. Ultimately, the passageway closes behind the testis. A failure in this process can cause [[indirect inguinal hernia]] or an infantile hydrocoele.

==Division of cloaca==
[[Image:Gray1116.png|thumb|right|300px|Tail end of human embryo thirty-two to thirty-three days old. The entodermal cloaca is visible at center left, labeled in green]]

After the separation of the rectum from the dorsal part of the cloaca, the ventral part becomes the primary urogenital sinus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.embryology.ch/anglais/ugenital/genitinterne04.html |title=Differentiation of the urogenital sinus in males |website=Embryology.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The urogenital sinus, in turn, divides into the superficial definitive urogenital sinus and the deeper anterior vesico-urethral portion.

===Definitive urogenital sinus===
The definitive urogenital sinus consists of a caudal cephallic portion and an intermediate narrow channel, the pelvic portion.

===Vesico-urethral portion===
The vesico-urethral portion is the deepest portion, continuous with the allantois. It absorbs the ends of the mesonephric ducts and the associated ends of the renal diverticula, and these give rise to the [[trigone of urinary bladder]] and part of the [[prostatic urethra]]. The remainder of the vesico-urethral portion forms the body of the bladder and part of the prostatic urethra; its apex is prolonged to the umbilicus as a narrow canal, the [[urachus]], which later is obliterated and becomes the [[median umbilical ligament]] of the adult.

==Prostate==
The [[prostate]] originally consists of two separate portions, each of which arises as a series of diverticular buds from the epithelial lining of the urogenital sinus and vesico-urethral part of the cloaca, between the third and fourth months. These buds become tubular, and form the glandular substance of the two lobes, which ultimately meet and fuse behind the urethra and also extend on to its ventral aspect. The median [[lobe of the prostate]] is formed as an extension of the lateral lobes between the common ejaculatory ducts and the bladder.

[[Skene's glands]] in the female urethra are regarded as the homologues of the prostatic glands.

The [[bulbourethral glands]] in the male, and [[Bartholin's gland]] in the female, also arise as diverticula from the epithelial lining of the urogenital sinus.

==External genitalia==
[[Image:Mesoderm-mid.png|thumb|right|300px|The mesoderm extends to the midventral line]]
Until about the ninth week of gestational age&lt;ref name=refnum024/&gt; the external genitalia of males and females look the same, and follow a common development. This includes the development of a genital tubercle and a membrane dorsally to it, covering the developing [[urogenital opening]], and the development of the labioscrotal fold, also called the urogenital fold, and the labioscrotal swelling.&lt;ref name=DevHuman&gt;Keith L. Moore, T. V. N. Persaud, Mark G. Torchia, The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology 10th Ed. Elsevier Health Sciences, 2015 {{ISBN|9780323313483}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=pmKGBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA267 pp 267-69]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after differentiation can be seen between the sexes, some stages are common, e.g. the disappearing of the membrane. On the other hand, sex-dependent development include further protrusion of the genital tubercle in the male to form the glans of the penis and in the female, the clitoral glans.&lt;ref name=DevHuman/&gt; The urogenital fold evolves into the shaft of the penis in males and the [[labia minora]] in females; the labioscrotal swelling evolves into the scrotum in males, and into the [[labia majora]] in females.&lt;ref name=DevHuman/&gt;

===Common development===
{{main|List of related male and female reproductive organs}}

====Before differentiation====
=====Urogenital membrane=====
There is initially a [[cloacal membrane]], composed of ectoderm and endoderm, reaching from the [[umbilical cord]] to the tail, separating the cloaca from the exterior. After the separation of the rectum from the dorsal part of the cloaca, the ventral part of the cloacal membrane becomes the ''urogenital membrane''.

=====Genital tubercle=====
Mesoderm extends to the [[midventral line]] for some distance behind the umbilical cord, and forms the lower part of the abdominal wall; it ends below in a prominent swelling, the cloacal tubercle, which after the separation of the rectum becomes the [[genital tubercle]]. Dorsally to this tubercle the sides aren't really fused. Rather, the urogenital part of the cloacal membrane separates the ingrowing sheets of mesoderm.

=====Phallus=====
The genital tubercle develops into the [[primordial phallus]], the first rudiment of the penis or clitoris.&lt;ref name=DevHuman/&gt;

The terminal part of the phallus, representing the future glans becomes solid. The remainder of the phallus, which remains hollow, is converted into a longitudinal groove by the absorption of the urogenital membrane.

The term genital tubercle, however, still remains, but only refers to the future glans &lt;ref name=refnum024&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.unc.edu/embryo_images/unit-genital/genital_htms/genital024.htm |title=Embryo Images Online |website=Med.unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Urogenital opening=====
In both sexes the phallic portion of the [[urogenital sinus]] extends on to the under surface of the cloacal tubercle as far forward as the apex. At the apex the walls of the phallic portion come together and fuse, obliterating the [[urogenital opening]]. Instead, a solid plate, the urethral plate, is formed. The remainder of the phallic portion is for a time tubular, and then, by the absorption of the urogenital membrane, it establishes a communication with the exterior. This opening is for a while the primitive urogenital opening, and it extends forward to the corona glandis.

====After differentiation====

[[Image:Gray1119.png|thumb|right|500px|Development of external genitalia. A: common development. C, E: male development. B, D, F: female development]]

The following developments occur in both males and females, although a difference in the development between the sexes already can be seen:

*The [[corpus cavernosum penis]], and the [[corpus cavernosum of clitoris]], and the [[corpus spongiosum penis]] arise from the mesodermal tissue in the phallus; they are at first dense structures, but later vascular spaces appear in them, and they gradually become cavernous.&lt;ref name=DevHuman/&gt;
*The [[prepuce (disambiguation)|prepuce]] in both sexes is formed by the growth of a solid plate of ectoderm into the superficial part of the phallus; on coronal section this plate presents the shape of a horseshoe. By the breaking down of its more centrally situated cells the plate is split into two lamellæ. Thus, a cutaneous fold, the prepuce, is liberated and forms a hood over the glans.

===Female===
In the female, a deep groove forms around the phallus. The sides of it grow dorsalward as the [[labioscrotal folds]], which ultimately form the labia majora in females. The labia minora, in contrast, arise by the continued growth of the lips of the groove on the under surface of the phallus; the remainder of the phallus forms the [[clitoral glans]].&lt;ref name=DevHuman/&gt;

===Male===
In the male the pelvic portion of the cloaca undergoes much greater development, pushing before it the phallic portion.

The labioscrotal folds extend around between the pelvic portion and the anus, and form a [[scrotal]] area. During the changes associated with the descent of the testes this scrotal area is drawn out to form the scrotal sacs. The penis is developed from the phallus.

As in the female, the urogenital membrane undergoes absorption, forming a channel on the under surface of the phallus; this channel extends only as far forward as the [[corona glandis]].

====Urogenital opening====
In the male, by the greater growth of the pelvic portion of the cloaca, a longer urethra is formed, and the primitive opening is carried forward with the phallus, but it still ends at the corona glandis. Later, this opening, which is located on the dorsal side of the penis,&lt;ref name=refnum027&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.unc.edu/embryo_images/unit-genital/genital_htms/genital027.htm |title=Embryo Images Online |website=Med.unc.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; closes from behind forward. Meanwhile, the urethral plate of the glans breaks down centrally to form a median groove continuous with the primitive ostium. This groove also closes from behind forward, leaving only a small pipe running in the middle of the penis. Thus, the urogenital opening is shifted forward to the end of the glans.

'''Eco-friendly [[Dentistry|dentistry]]''' (also called '''[[Environmentally_friendly|environmentally friendly]] dentistry''', '''green dentistry''' or '''sustainable dentistry''') is a [[sustainability]] and [[marketing]] term that refers to the aim of reducing the detrimental impact of dental services on the environment while still being able to adhere to the regulations and standards of the dental industries in their respective countries.
 
There are no official governing agencies that certify an office as meeting eco-friendly standards. Dental offices in the United States of America can be recognised as eco-friendly offices by becoming members of the [http://ecodentistry.org Eco Dentistry Association]. Within England there are audit programmes available from the National Union of Students such as the Green Impact tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainability.nus.org.uk/green-impact/articles/how-green-impact-works-in-healthcare|title=How Green Impact works in healthcare @ Sustainability|website=sustainability.nus.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who want to be involved and discuss sustainable dentistry in a free and open forum are invited to be members at the Centre for Sustainable Healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sustainablehealthcare.org.uk/what-we-do/sustainable-specialties/dentistry|title=Dentistry|date=2015-10-01|work=Centre for Sustainable Healthcare|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The term eco-friendly dentistry has roots originating from the [[environmental movement]] and [[environmentalism]], which, in the Western world, is often perceived as having begun in the 1960s and 1970s. The rise of this movement is often credited to [[Rachel Carson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rome|first1=Adam|title="Give Earth a Chance": The Environmental Movement and the Sixties|journal=Journal of American History|date=1 September 2003|volume=90|issue=2|pages=525|doi=10.2307/3659443|jstor=3659443}}&lt;/ref&gt; conservationist and author of the book [[Silent Spring]]. Subsequently, legislation in many countries throughout the world began gaining momentum in the 1970s and continues to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodgers|first1=William H|title=Giving voice to Rachel Carson: putting science into Environmental Law|journal=Journal of Land Use &amp; Environmental Law|date=2012|volume=28|issue=1|pages=61–69|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/380220471/GIVING-VOICE-TO-RACHEL-CARSON-PUTTING-SCIENCE-INTO-ENVIRONMENTAL-LAW|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eco-friendliness also has meaning in another context as a [[marketing]] term. It is used by companies to appeal to consumers of goods and services as having a low impact on the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=W. E.|last2=Sinkula|first2=J. M.|title=Environmental Marketing Strategy and Firm Performance: Effects on New Product Performance and Market Share|journal=Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science|date=1 October 2005|volume=33|issue=4|pages=461–475|doi=10.1177/0092070305276119|issn=0092-0703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Market research has found that an increasing number of consumers purchase goods and services that appeal to the values of environmental philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maly|first1=Kenneth|title=The Role of “Philosophy” in “Environmental Studies” or Why “Environmental Studies” Needs “Philosophy”|journal=Environmental Philosophy|date=2004|volume=1|issue=1|pages=75–78|doi=10.5840/envirophil20041118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dental industry has adopted the concept of eco-friendliness both in a well-meaning, philosophical context and as a marketing term so that patients who subscribe to principles of [[sustainability]] can choose to visit these offices. 

The term has been criticised as being used for "[[greenwashing]]", which is the practice of deceptively promoting a product or service as environmentally friendly. Legislation in countries around the world have Trade Commissions and such to stop companies profiting with baseless claims on their goods and services.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Individuals and bodies that work in the dental industry have also subsequently adopted the principles of sustainability and environmentalism and also as an advertisement to patients, clients and consumers. The Eco Dentistry Association is an accreditation organisation in the United States which has proposed outcomes towards becoming more sustainable.

In 2008, the Eco Dentistry Association was co-founded by Dr. Fred Pockrass and his wife, Ina Pockrass. The Eco Dentistry Association (EDA) provides "education, standards and connection" to patients and dentists who practice green dentistry. The EDA aims to help dentists "come up with safe and reusable alternatives that lower a dentists' operating cost by replacing paper with digital media whenever possible."&lt;ref name=greenbiz&gt;[http://www.greenbiz.com/blog/2011/02/04/green-business-teeth "A Green Business with Teeth"]&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2011, the EDA has approximately 600 members.&lt;ref name=greenbiz /&gt;. After the inception of the EDA, the dental industry in America saw more [[dentists]] and oral surgeons choosing to make their offices environmentally friendly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewdentist.net/Library/pdf/Fyalka.pdf "More Dentists Choosing to Build 'Green' Offices"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, The Australian Dental Association implemented a policy of sustainability to provide guidelines to assist in the environmental sustainability of dental offices in Australia. &lt;ref name=Policy621 /&gt; In August 2017 the FDA adopted a sustainability in dentistry policy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fdiworlddental.org/resources/policy-statements-and-resolutions/sustainability-in-dentistry|title=Sustainability in Dentistry|date=2017-10-03|work=FDI World Dental Federation|access-date=2018-08-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements of eco-friendly dentistry ==

There is a growing amount of scientific information regarding the carbon footprint of the dental industry. These include papers by Duane relating to work carried out in Scotland and more recently England. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duane|first1=B.|last2=Hyland|first2=J.|last3=Rowan|first3=J.S.|last4=Archibald|first4=B.|date=September 2012|title=Taking a bite out of Scotland's dental carbon emissions in the transition to a low carbon future|journal=Public Health|volume=126|issue=9|pages=770–777|doi=10.1016/j.puhe.2012.05.032|pmid=22902137}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duane|first1=B.|date=24 October 2014|title=Green Dentistry: Motivating change|journal=British Dental Journal|volume=217|issue=8|pages=388|doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.2014.915|pmid=25342330}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duane|first=B.|last2=Lee|first2=M. Berners|last3=White|first3=S.|last4=Stancliffe|first4=R.|last5=Steinbach|first5=I.|date=2017-10-27|title=An estimated carbon footprint of NHS primary dental care within England.

Recently, Public Health England published a report on the carbon footprint of NHS England dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/carbon-modelling-within-dentistry-towards-a-sustainable-future|title=Carbon modelling within dentistry: towards a sustainable future|website=GOV.UK|language=en|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report based on 2014 data provides a number of recommendations for the dental team in England to consider. The report demonstrated the considerable contribution of staff and patient travel to the overall carbon footprint.

To be environmentally responsible, offices can incorporate the four R's of environmental responsibility. The four R's are: reduce, reuse, recycle &amp; rethink.  
&lt;ref name="Rastogi2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rastogi|first1=Varun|title=Green Dentistry, A Metamorphosis Towards an Eco-Friendly Dentistry: A Short Communication|journal=Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research|volume=8|issue=7|pages=ZM01–2|date=2014|doi=10.7860/JCDR/2014/8084.4556|pmid=25177666|pmc=4149172}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:The 4 R's of environmental responsibility.png|thumb|The 4 R's of environmental responsibility]]
=== Reduce ===

Having a [[Paperless office|paperless]] dental office reduces or eliminates the use of paper by going digital. This involves converting patient files, medical histories and other documentation to an electronic system. Going paperless not only makes information sharing easier and accessible but is a great way of keeping personal information secure. This saves money, boosts productivity and saves space as there is no need for any filing cabinets and is a great way of ensuring clinical records are more accurate. &lt;ref name=Rastogi2014 /&gt;
Using [[Digital radiography|digital radiography]] allows to keep all the patients' records in one spot, reduces the amount of radiation exposure and images and clinical photographs can be shared without losing the quality of the image. &lt;ref name=Rastogi2014 /&gt;

=== Reuse ===

====Clean Water====

In many countries around the world there are strict mandatory limits on the use of mercury and the levels found in wastewater. [[File:Amalgam.jpg|thumb|Amalgam]] Mercury is traditionally used in dental restorations known as amalgam. In October 2013, Australia's Department of the Environment and Energy signed The Minamata Convention in a call for the reduction of amalgam usage by means of nine measures aiming to eventually phase out the use of amalgam. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minamata Convention on Mercury and Dental Amalgam|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/system/files/resources/b8cb9454-2686-438d-a361-a44b13c96ec6/files/minamata-convention-mercury-dental-factsheet.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] can be released into the environment when amalgam is placed, finished and polished or removed  from a patient mouth and can be either rinsed into sewage systems or disposed of in landfill. By complying with the Australian Dental Association (ADA) Policy 6.11 &lt;ref name=Policy611&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Statement 6.11 – Dental Amalgam Waste Management|url=https://www.ada.org.au/Dental-Professionals/Policies/Dental-Practice/6-11-Dental-Amalgam-Waste-Management/ADAPolicies_6-11_DentalAmalgamWasteManagement_V1|website=Australian Dental Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the current edition of the International Organization for Standardization ISO11143 Dentistry – Amalgam Separators, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISO 11143:2008|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/42288.html|website=International Organization for Standardization}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing the amount of mercury entering the environment by means of installing amalgam separators and traps to collect and separate amalgam waste before it enters the sewage system.  Amalgam that is collected from traps is then collected and recycled for reuse. &lt;ref name=Policy621&gt;{{cite web|title=Policy Statement 6.21 – Dentistry and Sustainability|url=https://www.ada.org.au/Dental-Professionals/Policies/Dental-Practice/6-21-Dentistry-and-Sustainability/ADAPolicies_6-21_DentistryandSustainability_V|website=Australian Dental Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the phasing out of manual processing of radiographs and switching to digital radiography allows for offices not having to purchase developing liquids and these liquids are harmful to the environment and need to be collected to be disposed of correctly.&lt;ref name=Ecofriendly&gt;{{cite web|title=Eco-friendly Dentistry: Need of Future. An Overview|url=http://www.jdas.in/temp/JDentAlliedSci6122-3001659_005001.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Policy611 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Policy621 /&gt;

====Water management====
&lt;br&gt;• Installing a [[Water metering|water meter]] to monitor water usage.
&lt;br&gt;• Handwashing sinks with [[Automatic faucet|motion-activated taps]].
&lt;br&gt;• Collect the water bills for the last year to benchmark a water usage audit. 
&lt;br&gt;• Place interpretive signs about water conservation in staff rooms, toilets and surgeries. 
&lt;br&gt;• Maintain and repair taps or fittings&lt;ref name=sustainability&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sustainability in Orthodontics: what can we do to save our planet?|url=http://www.scielo.br/pdf/dpjo/v22n4/2176-9451-dpjo-22-04-00113.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
&lt;br&gt;• Use a non-water-based approach to cleaning where possible. 
&lt;br&gt;• Retro flow controllers in key usage areas &lt;ref name=sustainability /&gt;
&lt;br&gt;• Install 4-, 5- or 6-star water efficient appliances where appropriate.

=== Recycle ===

Dental practices can [[Paper_recycling|recycle paper]], cardboard, aluminum and plastics from plastic barriers and other water products contributing to sustainable environmentally friendly practices. Autoclave bags can be separated after opening and the paper and plastic recycled separately.

To become more eco-friendly or environmentally friendly dental practices can purchase [[Biodegradable_waste|biodegradable]] products therefore allowing more waste associated with the running of the practice to be recycled. Shredding of paper documents and recycling shredded paper will contribute to sustainable practices.

=== Rethink ===

According to the Eco Dentistry Association, eco-friendly dentistry involves taking initiative to build a dental environment by sustainable practices and materials. However, eco-friendly dentistry is not bound by only sustainable manufacturing distribution, waste reduction, pollution prevention, energy conservation, water conservation, patient care and workplace policies. Eco-friendly dentistry is about leadership and innovation. Influencing others around them to part-take in the cause. Eco-friendly dentistry needs to be widespread to make a large impact on the environment and on the dental industry. It is important to create and implement educational programs to enlighten others to follow. Eco-friendly dentistry is about being innovative, discovering new ideas and ways to promote environmentally safe practices.

The '''follicle-stimulating hormone receptor''' or '''FSH receptor''' ('''FSHR''') is a [[transmembrane receptor]] that interacts with the [[follicle-stimulating hormone]] (FSH)  and represents a [[G protein-coupled receptor]] (GPCR). Its activation is necessary for the hormonal functioning of FSH. FSHRs are found in the [[ovary]], [[testis]], and [[uterus]].

== FSHR gene ==

The gene for the FSHR is found on [[chromosome 2]] p21 in humans. The gene sequence of the FSHR consists of  about 2,080 [[nucleotide]]s.&lt;ref name="FSHR"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Simoni M, Gromoll J, Nieschlag E | title = The follicle-stimulating hormone receptor: biochemistry, molecular biology, physiology, and pathophysiology | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 739–73 | date = Dec 1997 | pmid = 9408742 | doi = 10.1210/er.18.6.739 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Receptor structure ==
[[Image:7TM receptor.png|thumb|left|250px|The seven transmembrane α-helix structure of a G protein-coupled receptor such as FSHR]]

The FSHR consists of 695 amino acids and has a molecular mass of about 76 kDa.&lt;ref name="FSHR"/&gt; Like other GPCRs, the FSH-receptor possesses seven membrane-spanning domains or [[transmembrane helix|transmembrane helices]].

* The ''extracellular domain'' of the receptor contains 11 leucine-rich repeats and is [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]].  It has two subdomains, a hormone-binding subdomain followed by a signal-specificity subdomain.&lt;ref name="pmid22802634"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang X, Liu H, Chen X, Chen PH, Fischer D, Sriraman V, Yu HN, Arkinstall S, He X | title = Structure of follicle-stimulating hormone in complex with the entire ectodomain of its receptor | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 31 | pages = 12491–6 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22802634 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1206643109 | pmc=3411987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hormone-binding subdomain is responsible for the high-affinity hormone binding, and the signal-specificity subdomain, containing a sulfated tyrosine at position 335 (sTyr) in a hinge loop, is required for the hormone activity.&lt;ref name="pmid11847099"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Costagliola S, Panneels V, Bonomi M, Koch J, Many MC, Smits G, Vassart G | title = Tyrosine sulfation is required for agonist recognition by glycoprotein hormone receptors | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 21 | issue = 4 | pages = 504–13 | date = Feb 2002 | pmid = 11847099 | doi = 10.1093/emboj/21.4.504 | pmc=125869}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''transmembrane domain'' contains two highly conserved [[cysteine]] residues that build [[disulfide bond]]s to stabilize the receptor structure. A highly conserved Asp-Arg-Tyr triplet motif is present in GPCR family members in general and may be of importance to transmit the signal. In FSHR and its closely related other [[glycoprotein hormone receptor]] members (LHR and [[TSHR]]), this conserved triplet motif is a variation Glu-Arg-Trp sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid24001578"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jiang X, Dias JA, He X | title = Structural biology of glycoprotein hormones and their receptors: insights to signaling | journal = Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology | volume = 382 | issue = 1 | pages = 424–51 | date = Jan 2014 | pmid = 24001578 | doi = 10.1016/j.mce.2013.08.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''C-terminal domain'' is intracellular and brief, rich in [[serine]] and [[threonine]] residues for possible [[phosphorylation]].

== Ligand binding and signal transduction ==

Upon initial binding to the LRR region of FSHR, FSH reshapes its conformation to form a new pocket. FSHR then inserts its sulfotyrosine from the hinge loop  into the pockets and activates the 7-helical transmembrane domain.&lt;ref name="pmid22802634"/&gt;  This event leads to a [[signal transduction|transduction of the signal]] that activates the [[G protein]] that is bound to the receptor internally. With FSH  attached, the receptor shifts [[Chemical conformation|conformation]] and, thus, mechanically activates the G protein, which detaches from the receptor and activates the [[Cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] system.

It is believed that a receptor molecule exists in a conformational equilibrium between active and inactive states. The binding of FSH to the receptor shifts the equilibrium between active and inactive receptors. FSH and FSH-agonists shift the equilibrium in favor of active states; FSH antagonists shift the equilibrium in favor of inactive states. For a cell to respond to FSH, only a small percentage (~1%) of receptor sites need to be activated.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

=== Phosphorylation by cAMP-dependent protein kinases ===

Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases ([[protein kinase A]]) are activated by the signal chain coming from the G protein (that was activated by the FSH-receptor) via [[adenylate cyclase]] and [[cyclic AMP]] (cAMP). 
&lt;br&gt;These protein kinases are present as [[tetrameric protein|tetramer]]s with two regulatory units and two catalytic units. Upon binding of  cAMP to the regulatory units, the catalytic units are released and initiate the phosphorylation of proteins, leading to the physiologic action. The cyclic AMP-regulatory dimers are degraded by [[phosphodiesterase]] and release 5’AMP. [[DNA]]  in the [[cell nucleus]]  binds to phosphorylated proteins through the [[cyclic AMP response element]] (CRE), which results in the activation of [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name="FSHR"/&gt;

The signal is amplified by the involvement of cAMP and the resulting phosphorylation. The process is modified by [[prostaglandin]]s. Other cellular regulators are participate are the intracellular calcium concentration modified by [[phospholipase]], [[nitric acid]], and other growth factors.

The FSH receptor can also activate the [[extracellular signal-regulated kinase]]s (ERK).&lt;ref name="pmid16787538"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Piketty V, Kara E, Guillou F, Reiter E, Crepieux P | title = Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) activates extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation independently of beta-arrestin- and dynamin-mediated FSH receptor internalization | journal = Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology | volume = 4 | issue =  | pages = 33 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16787538 | pmc = 1524777 | doi = 10.1186/1477-7827-4-33 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''feedback mechanism'', these activated kinases phosphorylate the receptor. The longer the receptor remains active, the more kinases are activated, the more receptors are phosphorylated.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

== Action ==

In the ovary, the FSH receptor is necessary for follicular development and expressed on the [[granulosa cell]]s.&lt;ref name="FSHR"/&gt;

In the male, the FSH receptor has been identified on the [[Sertoli cell]]s that are critical for [[spermatogenesis]].&lt;ref name="pmid12059813"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Asatiani K, Gromoll J, Eckardstein SV, Zitzmann M, Nieschlag E, Simoni M | title = Distribution and function of FSH receptor genetic variants in normal men | journal = Andrologia | volume = 34 | issue = 3 | pages = 172–6 | date = Jun 2002 | pmid = 12059813 | doi = 10.1046/j.1439-0272.2002.00493.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSHR is expressed during the luteal phase in the secretory [[endometrium]] of the uterus.&lt;ref name="pmid16390776"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = La Marca A, Carducci Artenisio A, Stabile G, Rivasi F, Volpe A | title = Evidence for cycle-dependent expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor in human endometrium | journal = Gynecological Endocrinology | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 303–6 | date = Dec 2005 | pmid = 16390776 | doi = 10.1080/09513590500402756 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

FSH receptor is selectively expressed on the surface of the blood vessels of a wide range of carcinogenic tumors.&lt;ref name="pmid20961245"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Radu A, Pichon C, Camparo P, Antoine M, Allory Y, Couvelard A, Fromont G, Hai MT, Ghinea N | title = Expression of follicle-stimulating hormone receptor in tumor blood vessels | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 363 | issue = 17 | pages = 1621–30 | date = Oct 2010 | pmid = 20961245 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1001283 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Receptor regulation ==

=== Upregulation ===

[[Upregulation]] refers to the increase in the number of receptor sites on the membrane. Estrogen upregulates FSH receptor sites. In turn, FSH stimulates [[granulosa cell]]s to produce [[estrogen]]s. This synergistic activity of estrogen and FSH allows for follicle growth and development in the ovary.

=== Desensitization ===

The FSHR become desensitized when exposed to FSH  for some time.  A key reaction of this downregulation is the [[phosphorylation]] of the intracellular (or [[cytoplasm]]ic) receptor domain by [[protein kinase]]s. This process uncouples Gs protein from the FSHR. Another way to desensitize is to uncouple the regulatory and catalytic units of the cAMP system.

=== Downregulation ===

[[Downregulation]] refers to the decrease in the number of receptor sites. This can be accomplished by metabolizing bound FSHR sites. The bound FSH-receptor complex is brought by lateral migration to a "coated pit," where such units are concentrated  and then stabilized by a framework of [[clathrin]]s.  A pinched-off coated pit is internalized and degraded by [[lysosomes]]. Proteins may be metabolized or the receptor can be recycled. Use of long-acting agonists will downregulate the receptor population.

=== Modulators ===

Antibodies to FSHR can interfere with FSHR activity.

== FSH abnormalities ==

Some patients with [[ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome]] may have [[mutation]]s in the gene for FSHR, making them more sensitive to gonadotropin stimulation.&lt;ref name="pmid16034183"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Delbaere A, Smits G, De Leener A, Costagliola S, Vassart G | title = Understanding ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome | journal = Endocrine | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 285–90 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 16034183 | doi = 10.1385/ENDO:26:3:285 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women with 46 [[XX gonadal dysgenesis]]  experience primary [[amenorrhea]] with hypergonadotropic [[hypogonadism]]. There are forms of 46 xx gonadal dysgenesis  wherein abnormalities  in the FSH-receptor have been reported and are thought to be the cause of the hypogonadism.&lt;ref name="pmid7553856"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aittomäki K, Lucena JL, Pakarinen P, Sistonen P, Tapanainen J, Gromoll J, Kaskikari R, Sankila EM, Lehväslaiho H, Engel AR, Nieschlag E, Huhtaniemi I, de la Chapelle A | title = Mutation in the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor gene causes hereditary hypergonadotropic ovarian failure | journal = Cell | volume = 82 | issue = 6 | pages = 959–68 | date = Sep 1995 | pmid = 7553856 | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(95)90275-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Polymorphism (biology)|Polymorphism]] may affect FSH receptor populations and lead to poorer responses in infertile women receiving FSH medication for [[IVF]].&lt;ref name="pmid16758348"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loutradis D, Patsoula E, Minas V, Koussidis GA, Antsaklis A, Michalas S, Makrigiannakis A | title = FSH receptor gene polymorphisms have a role for different ovarian response to stimulation in patients entering IVF/ICSI-ET programs | journal = Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 177–84 | date = Apr 2006 | pmid = 16758348 | pmc = 3454958 | doi = 10.1007/s10815-005-9015-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2929">'''The Football Act 1424''' was passed by the [[Parliament of Scotland]] in the reign of [[James I of Scotland|James I]]. It became law on 26 May 1424, one of a set of [[statute]]s passed that day; it is recorded as ''James I. 1424 (May 26) c.18'' in the Record Edition of the statutes, and ''James I. Parl. 1-1424 c.17'' in the Duodecimo Edition. The title of the Act was "Of playing at the fut ball".

The Act stated that ''it is statut and the king forbiddis that na man play at the fut ball under the payne of iiij d''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Act remained in force for several centuries, although somewhat unsurprisingly, it fell into disuse. It was finally repealed by the [[Statute Law Revision (Scotland) Act 1906]].

Three further 15th century Acts (in 1457, 1470 and 1490) explicitly prohibit both football and golf (see [[Golf in Scotland]]) during ''wappenschaws'' ({{lang-en|[[Muster (military)|musterings]]}}) for [[archery]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5261">'''Granny dumping''' (informal) is a term that was introduced in the early 1980s by professionals in the medical and social work fields. Granny dumping is defined by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' as "the abandonment of an elderly person in a public place such as a hospital or nursing home, especially by a relative".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=granny dumping - definition of granny dumping in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/granny_dumping|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be carried out by family members who are unable or unwilling to continue providing care due to financial problems, burnout, lack of resources (such as home health or assisted living options), or stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Dumping Ground For Granny|url=http://europe.newsweek.com/dumping-ground-granny-201140?rm=eu|website=Newsweek|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon is not new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House: Wilson calls for action on ‘granny dumping’ {{!}} The Royal Gazette:Bermuda Health|url=http://www.royalgazette.com/article/20150310/NEWS06/150319979|website=The Royal Gazette|accessdate=31 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A practice, known as ''[[ubasute]]'', had allegedly existed in Japan centuries ago when senile elders were brought to mountaintops by poor citizens who were unable to look after them. The widespread economic and demographic problems facing Japan have seen it on the rise with relatives dropping off seniors at hospitals or charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese people who can't afford elder care are reviving a practice known as 'granny dumping'|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/japanese-people-reviving-granny-dumping-practice-2017-1?r=US&amp;IR=T|website=Business Insider|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 70,000 (both male and female equally) elderly Americans were estimated to have been abandoned in 1992 in a report issued by the [[American College of Emergency Physicians]]. In this same study, ACEP received informal surveys from 169 hospital Emergency Departments and report an average of 8 "granny dumping" abandonments per week. According to the New York Times, 1 in 5 people are now caring for an elderly parent and people are spending more time than ever caring for an elderly parent than their own children. Social workers have said that this may be the result of millions of people who are near the breaking point of looking after their elderly parents who are in poor health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Granny Dumping by the Thousands|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/29/opinion/granny-dumping-by-the-thousands.html|website=The New York Times|accessdate=31 January 2017|date=29 March 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, granny dumping is more likely to happen in states such as Florida, Texas and California where there are large populations of retirement communities. Congress has attempted to step in by mandating to emergency departments requiring them to see all patients. However, Medicaid is covering less and less of medical bills through reimbursement (in 1989 it was 78% but that number is decreasing) and reduced eligibility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In some cases, the hospitals may not want to take the risk of having a patient who cannot pay so they will attempt to transfer their care to another hospital. According to the [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985]] set into place by [[Ronald Reagan]], a hospital can transfer at the patient's request or providers must sign a document providing why they believe a patient's care should be better served at another facility. With 40% of revenue coming from [[Medicaid]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] a hospital must earn 8 cents per dollar to compensate for the loss of 7 cents per Medicaid/Medicare patients. Hospitals had to pay an additional 2 billion dollars to private payers to cover costs for Medicare/Medicaid patients in 1989.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conard|first=Jane Reister|date=1992|title=Granny Dumping: The Hospital's Duty of Care to Patients Who Have Nowhere to Go|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40239388|journal=Yale Law &amp; Policy Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=463–487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of granny dumping can happen before long weekends and may peak before Christmas when families head off on holidays. Caregivers in both Australia and New Zealand report that old people without acute medical problems are dropped off at hospitals. As a result, hospitals and care facilities have to carry an extra burden on their limited resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnston|first1=Martin|title=Holiday concern about 'granny dumping' at hospitals|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11348685|website=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en-NZ|date=27 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disturbing rise in cases of 'granny dumping'|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/elderly-being-dumped-by-families-at-hospital/news-story/4642a4958d8ff9edf5160382350a1103|website=News.com.au|publisher=The Sunday Mail, Queensland|accessdate=31 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hamish Nisbet Munro''' [[FRSE]] (1915-1994) was a Scottish biochemist and expert in protein metabolism at [[Glasgow University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He served as President of the [[American Institute of Nutrition]] in 1978, and was first Director of the [https://hnrca.tufts.edu/ USDA Human Nutrition Research Centre on Ageing] at [[Tufts University]]. 
==Life==
Munro was born in [[Edinburgh]] on 3 July 1915, the son of a bank clerk. He was educated first at [[George Watson's College]]. However, in 1923 his father was transferred to manage the [[Bank of Scotland]] branch in the small village of [[Bonar Bridge]] in Sutherland, close to his family home in Dornoch. Hamish was then educated in the one-room village school. In 1932 he was Dux (top pupil) of the county of Sutherland&lt;ref&gt;https://cosutheducation.blogspot.com/2008/11/dux-medalists-in-east-sutherland.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Wishing to study medicine but needing qualifications which could not be provided in his village school he crammed physics and chemistry alone and passed the university entrance examination, but as medicine was oversubscribed, he first studied for a Bachelor of Science degree at [[Glasgow University]]. During this course he spent the summers with [[Edward Provan Cathcart]] and [[David Cuthbertson]] and acquired an interest in metabolism and nutrition. He graduated BSc in 1936 with First Class Honours, publishing that year the first of over 700 scientific papers. He returned to the medical course and qualified MB ChB in September 1939.&lt;ref&gt;http://rse.mtcserver6.com/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/munro_hamish.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He began as a medical resident at the [[Victoria Infirmary]] in Glasgow, and was promoted to Clinical Tutor the following year, a role he held for the duration of the [[Second World War]]. In 1945 he left clinical work for a Lecturership in Physiology at Glasgow University, transferring as Senior Lecturer to the newly separate Department of Biochemistry in 1947. The head of the department was [[James Norman Davidson]], but Munro established his own reputation in studies of protein metabolism and nucleic acids, receiving a doctorate (DSc) in 1956, and being appointed full Professor in 1964.[2] In 1956 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], proposed by Davidson, Cuthbertson, [[Robert Campbell Garry]], and Hugh Garven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. During this time, he completed the first two volumes of his major work, Mammalian Protein Metabolism, with J.D. Allison.&lt;ref&gt;http://munksroll.rcplondon.ac.uk/Biography/Details/3245&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 he moved to [[Boston]] in America as Professor of Physiological Chemistry at [[MIT]]. In this laboratory he continued his studies of protein metabolism, including his major interest in ferritin, but also important studies in RNA polymerases, and methylated histidine as a measure of muscle breakdown.  In 1972 he was offered, but declined, directorship of the Dunn Nutrition Centre in [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]].[4] From 1977 he joined a [[US Department of Agriculture]] task force which led to the construction of the [https://hnrca.tufts.edu/ USDA Human Nutrition Research Centre on Ageing] at [[Tufts University]], a 15 storey building in downtown Boston. Munro was its first Director from 1982, also serving as Professor of Medicine at Tufts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fi.edu/laureates/hamish-nisbet-munro&lt;/ref&gt;

He received many awards, including the Osborne-Mendel Award (1969) and the Borden Award (1978) from the [[American Institute of Nutrition]], the Bristol-Myers Award for Distinguished Achievements in Nutrition (1981), the Rank Prize for Nutrition (1982) and the Corson Medal, [[Franklin Institute]] (1987). In 1983 he compiled publications on ferritin into an MD thesis for which he was awarded the Bellahouston Medal by Glasgow University. He was a member of the US [[National Academy of Sciences]] from 1974, and had an honorary doctorate from the [[University of Nancy]], France.

Although he continued to work until the age of 75, and added to his scientific publications even in his last years, he was increasingly disabled by [[Parkinson’s disease]] and died of complications of this in Glasgow on 28 October 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/munro-hamish.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

During a study of scurvy he met a medical colleague, Dr Edith Little, whom he married in 1946. They had one daughter and three sons, brought up in Glasgow and Boston. After the children had left home, Edith returned to the UK where she pursued her own career as a psychiatrist, but the family remained integrated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2703">The '''Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia''' was founded on March 1, 1992, according to the Law on healthcare and health insurance, after declaring independence from [[Yugoslavia]]. The Institute is called: Institute for Medical Insurance ([http://www.zzzs.si/ Zavod za zdravsteno zavarovanje]). It conducts its business as a public institute, bound by statute to provide compulsory [[health insurance]]. The Institute's principal task is to provide effective collection (mobilisation) and distribution (allocation) of public funds, in order to ensure the insured persons quality rights arising from the said funds.

Health insurance is compulsory and voluntary. Compulsory health insurance is provided by the Health Insurance Institute of Slovenia, voluntary health insurance is carried out by other health insurance companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zzzs.si/zzzs/internet/zzzs.nsf/o/32517E43F68275AAC1256D340029CAF8 Institute for Medical Insurance]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute comprises 10 regional units and 45 branch offices distributed around the territory of [[Slovenia]]. The Information Centre and the Directorate complete the Institute's structure. At the end of 2005, the Institute staff numbered regular 929 employees.
The Institute is governed by an Assembly, whose members are the (elected) representatives of employers (including the representatives of the Government of the Republic of Slovenia) and employees. The executive body of the Assembly is the Institute Board of Directors.

The Slovene health insurance card system was introduced, at the national scale, in the year 1999. The system provides the insured persons with a smart card. The card carries the identification number (HIIS number), the card issue number, the name and surname of the card holder, gender, and date of birth. Data links are established between the health care service providers and health insurance providers (the Health Insurance Institute and the two voluntary health insurance providers). Medical records are accessed by a health care professional using a double card reader. The professional's card controls their level of access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=: Slovene Health Insurance Card :: All about the Health Insurance Card System :: Card Data|url=http://www.zzzs.si/zzzs/internet/zzzseng.nsf/o/FE0F77E424C1C9EEC1256EC8002A345C|website=zzzs|accessdate=12 November 2015}}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infant mortality==
According to WHO data [[Infant mortality|infant mortality rate]] nearly halved from 2002 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.country.country-ARM|title=GHO {{!}} By country {{!}} Armenia - statistics summary (2002 - present)|website=apps.who.int|access-date=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Malnutrition and obesity==
[[Malnutrition|Undernourishment]] at 6.3% in 2014 of population remained nearly unchanged since 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sn_itk_defc_zs&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=region:ECS&amp;idim=country:ARM:GEO:BLR:LVA:LTU:RUS:AZE:KAZ:MDA:TJK:TKM:UZB:EST:UKR:KGZ&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=-310968000000&amp;tend=1393185600000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false|title=Chart – World Development Indicators (Google Public Data Explorer)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Obesity]] rate is 19.5% in Armenia in 2017, which is lower than in all regional countries and nearly all European countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://renewbariatrics.com/obesity-rank-by-countries/|title=World Rankings: Obesity Rates by Country (July 2017)|date=2017-09-23|work=Renew Bariatrics|access-date=2018-01-19|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://i.redd.it/2d3of8buixa01.png|title=Prevalence of obesity in the world|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|layurl=https://renewbariatrics.com/obesity-rank-by-countries/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smoking==
[[Tobacco Policy in Armenia|Tobacco policy in Armenia]] is as of February 2018 still very permissive with almost no enforcement of any smoke-restricting laws.

==Healthcare==
At the time of independence in 1991 no traces of pre-Soviet healthcare traditions were discernible. The soviet healthcare system was highly centralized. The entire population was guaranteed free medical assistance, regardless of social status, and had access to a comprehensive range of secondary and tertiary care.  After independence  Armenia was not in a position to continue to fund it.  Following the reform programme all the hospitals and polyclinics, rural health units (including village health centers), and health posts from the previous system continue to function.  Hospitals which were formerly accountable to the local administration and ultimately to the Ministry of Health are now autonomous and increasingly responsible for their own budgets and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Health care system in Armenia |url=https://www.ap-companies.com/services/ekspatam/armenia/ |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=AP |date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A Basic Benefits Package was established in 1999.  This provided provides free specific health-care services, including medicines, to vulnerable segments of the population, including children, the elderly and disabled, impoverished people and injured military personnel. Since 2006, primary health care services have been free of charge. 

In 2009 about half the health expenditure in the country came directly out of the pockets of patients at the time of treatment. More than 50% of the national health budget was spent on hospitals.  At the local community level the system was weak and in rural areas often non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Armenians struggle for health care and medicines |url=http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/87/7/09-010709/en/ |accessdate=15 November 2018 |publisher=WHO |date=July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vast improvements of health services in Armenia occurred in the twenty-first century, principally easier accessibility to health-care services and an Open Enrollment program which allows Armenians to freely choose their healthcare service provider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Knapp |first1=Caprice |last2=Madden |first2=Vanessa |last3=Fowler-Kerry |first3=Susan |title=Pediatric palliative care : global perspectives |date=2011 |publisher=Springer |location= Dordrecht |isbn= 978-9400725690 |page=84 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Klp5XKAMKjAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health expenditure at 4.5% of GDP in 2014 was the 3rd lowest in post-USSR countries and below the average of the region of Europe and Central Asia, same as in years 2006–2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=health_expenditure_of_gdp&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=region:ECS&amp;idim=country:ARM:GEO:BLR:LVA:LTU:RUS:AZE:KAZ:MDA:TJK:TKM:UZB:EST:UKR:KGZ&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false|title=Chart – World Development Indicators (Google Public Data Explorer)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health expenditures as percentage of government spendings were 4th lowest for the same group in 2008–2014, but beat peers in [[Transcaucasia|South Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sh_xpd_publ_gx_zs&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=region:ECS&amp;idim=country:ARM:GEO:BLR:LVA:LTU:RUS:AZE:KAZ:MDA:TJK:TKM:UZB:EST:UKR:KGZ&amp;ifdim=region&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false|title=Chart – World Development Indicators (Google Public Data Explorer)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health expenditures in per capita terms (at PPP at constant 2005 USD) were nearly permanently 5th lowest in the above group in years 1999–2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sh_xpd_pcap_pp_kd&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=region:ECS&amp;idim=country:ARM:GEO:BLR:LVA:LTU:RUS:AZE:KAZ:MDA:TJK:TKM:UZB:EST:UKR:KGZ&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=793569600000&amp;tend=1393185600000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false|title=Chart – World Development Indicators (Google Public Data Explorer)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out-of-pocket health expenditure were 4th highest in the same group in years 2003–2006 and 2010–2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sh_xpd_oopc_to_zs&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=region:ECS&amp;idim=country:ARM:GEO:BLR:LVA:LTU:RUS:AZE:KAZ:MDA:TJK:TKM:UZB:EST:UKR:KGZ&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=-310968000000&amp;tend=1393185600000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false|title=Chart – World Development Indicators (Google Public Data Explorer)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 4.3% of health expenditures came from sources outside of Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&amp;ctype=l&amp;strail=false&amp;bcs=d&amp;nselm=h&amp;met_y=sh_xpd_extr_zs&amp;scale_y=lin&amp;ind_y=false&amp;rdim=region&amp;idim=country:ARM:GEO:BLR:LVA:LTU:RUS:AZE:KAZ:MDA:TJK:TKM:UZB:EST:UKR:KGZ&amp;idim=region:ECS&amp;ifdim=region&amp;tstart=-310968000000&amp;tend=1456257600000&amp;hl=en&amp;dl=en&amp;ind=false&amp;icfg|title=Chart – World Development Indicators (Google Public Data Explorer)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.google.com|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of [[States and union territories of India|Indian states and territories]] ranked by the availability of [[toilet]] facilities per household. Figures are from the [[2011 Census of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://censusindia.gov.in/2011census/hlo/Data_sheet/India/Latrine.pdf| title=Availability and type of latrine facility | publisher=2011 Census of India, Government of India | year=2011 | accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list does not include the newly formed states of [[Telangana]] and the residual state of [[Andhra Pradesh]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="ap" group="note"&gt;In 2011, the undivided state of Andhra Pradesh ranked 26th among states and territories in terms of toilet availability, just above Tamil Nadu. As of the 2011 census, 43.1 percent of households in Andhra Pradesh had access to a flush toilet, 5.4 percent had access to a pit toilet, and 1.1 percent had access to another type of toilet. 50.4 percent of households in the state lacked toilet facilities.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Judith McBurney''' (19 May 1948 – 1 December 2018)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://judymcburney.com/biography.html|title=Biography|website=judymcburney.com|access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an Australian actress, voice-over artist and model, best known for several [[TV series]]. She was best known as Tania Livingston in ''[[The Young Doctors]]'' and Pixie Mason in '' [[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'' (also known as ''Prisoner: Cell Block H'').&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://judymcburney.com/television.html|title=Television CV|website=judymcburney.com|access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Before acting she started a successful career as a model employed by [[June Dally-Watkins]]. One of her first acting roles was in late 1969, in a supporting role in [[Peter Weir]]'s short movie ''Michael'', one of three short movies released under the title ''[[Three to Go]]''. It followed by small parts in ABC TV-plays and guest roles in other TV series. Her first leading role was in 1972 as Ella Belairs in ABC's adaption of ''[[The Cousin from Fiji]],'' based on a novel by [[Norman Lindsay]]. Another early and memorable role was as Aldith in ''[[Seven Little Australians]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==Television soap operas==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=June 2017}}                                                                                              
In late 1973, McBurney was cast in the role of key new character Marilyn McDonald in ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'' but before any of her scenes had gone to air and with about 30 scenes in the can she had to withdraw from the role due to illness. This left her replacement, [[Frances Hargreaves]], to reshoot all of McBurney's scenes.

McBurney then went into the ongoing role of plain-Jane secretary Jane Fowler in ''[[The Box (soap opera)|The Box]]'' in late 1975, and later played the brief role of Jodi in ''Number 96''. Subsequently, she became immensely popular playing the part of nurse Tania Livingston in ''The Young Doctors''. She played the role from 1977 until the series ended in 1982. She followed this with another popular character, that of breezy romantic Sandra "Pixie" Mason in Prisoner. She played Pixie on a recurring basis from 1983–85. In later years she appeared in a few episodes of ''[[Always Greener]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

McBurney was also famous for her voice-over work and also starring in commercials, in particular a very cheeky, controversial ad from the 1980s for [[Palmolive (brand)|Palmolive Gold]], in which she features in a bed with fellow ''The Young Doctors'' actor [[Peter Bensley]].

'''''King v. Burwell''''', {{Ussc|576|___|2015|el=no}}, was a 6-3 decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] interpreting provisions of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA). The Court's decision upheld, as consistent with the statute, the outlay of [[premium tax credit]]s to qualifying persons in all states, both those with [[Health insurance marketplace|exchanges]] established directly by a [[U.S. state|state]], and those otherwise established by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]].

The petitioners had argued that the plain language of the statute provided eligibility for [[tax credit]]s only to those persons in states with state-operated exchanges. The Court rejected this interpretation. Rather, the Court found the disputed clause to be ambiguous, and that it ought to be interpreted in a manner "that is compatible with the rest of the law." The majority opinion stated: "Congress made the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements applicable in every State in the Nation. But those requirements only work when combined with the coverage requirement and tax credits. So it stands to reason that Congress meant for those provisions to apply in every State as well."&lt;ref&gt;''King v. Burwell'', slip op. at 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
'''''King v. Burwell''''', '''''Halbig v. Burwell''''', '''''Pruitt v. Burwell''''',&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The ''"v. Burwell''" cases were  titled "''v. Sebelius''" until [[Kathleen Sebelius]] was replaced by [[Sylvia Mathews Burwell]] as [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services]] on June 9, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; and '''''Indiana v. IRS''''' were federal lawsuits challenging U.S. Treasury regulation, 26 C.F.R. § 1.36B-2(a)(1), issued under the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA). The challengers argued that the ACA allows for certain subsidies only on state-established exchanges, and that the regulation as implemented by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS), providing for subsidies on state-run exchanges as well as federal exchanges, exceeded the authority Congress granted to it. The [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] coordinated and funded the ''King'' and ''Halbig'' lawsuits.&lt;ref name=bader&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cei.org/content/scotus-announces-review-cei’s-healthcare-case-king-v-burwell|website=[[Competitive Enterprise Institute]]|accessdate=May 2, 2015|date=November 7, 2014|title=SCOTUS Announces Review of CEI’s Healthcare Case: King v. Burwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timothy Jost]], a [[health law]] professor at the [[Washington and Lee University School of Law]], wrote that if the challenges were successful, approximately 5 million Americans who obtained coverage through federal exchanges could have lost their tax credits and, in all likelihood, their health insurance coverage. According to Jost, the [[individual mandate|individual]] and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act#Employer mandate and part-time working hours|employer mandates]] might also have "disappear[ed] or [been] severely undermined" in states with federal exchanges. Insurers, however, would still have been required to cover all applicants regardless of pre-existing conditions, which could have destabilized the individual insurance markets in states with federal exchanges and could have led to rapid rises in premiums and the possible collapse of one or more of those markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=Timothy S.|authorlink=Timothy Jost|title=Subsidies and the Survival of the ACA — Divided Decisions on Premium Tax Credits|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=371|number=10|pages=890–91|year=2014|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1408958|pmid=25075618|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1408958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Urban Institute]] estimated that a decision in favor of King would have resulted in 8.2 million more uninsured people in 34 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blumberg|first1=Linda J.|last2=Buettgens|first2=Matthew|last3=Holahan|first3=John|title=The Implications of a Supreme Court Finding for the Plaintiff in King vs. Burwell: 8.2 Million More Uninsured and 35% Higher Premiums|url=http://www.urban.org/UploadedPDF/2000062-The-Implications-King-vs-Burwell.pdf|website=Timely Analysis of Immediate Health Policy Issues|publisher=The Urban Institute|accessdate=March 1, 2015|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government figures released June 2, 2015 (for the period ending March 31, 2015) show that approximately 6.4 million Americans were enrolled in a federal exchange and received a supplement at that time, and thus, presumably would have lost the subsidy had the court found for the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=USA |url=http://www.cms.gov/Newsroom/MediaReleaseDatabase/Fact-sheets/2015-Fact-sheets-items/2015-06-02.html |title=2015-06-02 - Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services |website=Cms.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sun |first=Lena H. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/64-million-americans-could-lose-obamacare-subsidies-federal-data-show/2015/06/02/fe0c87be-095a-11e5-95fd-d580f1c5d44e_story.html |title=6.4 million Americans could lose Obamacare subsidies, federal data show |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2015-06-02 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, sixteen states and the District of Columbia had set up their own exchanges.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Thirteen states have a state-based exchange and use their own websites for enrollment. Had the court ruled in favor of King, one issue that would have needed to be resolved was whether the subsidies should be struck down in the three states–Nevada,  New Mexico, and Oregon–that have a state-based exchanges but used the federal healthcare.gov website for enrollment.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=State Marketplace Types, 2015 |url = http://kff.org/health-reform/state-indicator/state-health-insurance-marketplace-types/ |work=[[KFF (website)|KFF]] |publisher=[[Kaiser Family Foundation]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; If the subsidies and (in effect) the mandates had been struck down in the other 34 states, many thought that the economic foundation of the ACA would have been undermined, putting the entirety of the legislation at risk.&lt;ref name="McIntyre04MAR2015"&gt;{{cite web | last = McIntyre | first = Adrianna | title = King v.

==Text of the law and regulation==
The ACA legislation includes the language "enrolled in through an Exchange established by the State under 1311". As implemented by the IRS, ACA regulations use a more broad definition encompassing both the state exchanges and the federal exchanges set up under section 1321.&lt;ref name="McIntyre04MAR2015"/&gt; The legislation includes the phrase "established by the State under 1311" in nine different locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cannon | first = Michael F. | title = George F.

Internal Revenue Code section 36B, enacted as part of the ACA, includes the following provision:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the case of an applicable taxpayer, there shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this subtitle for any taxable year an amount equal to the premium assistance credit amount of the taxpayer for the taxable year.

(2) (a) the monthly premiums for such month for 1 or more qualified health plans offered in the individual market within a State which cover the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or any dependent (as defined in section 152) of the taxpayer and which were enrolled in through an Exchange established by the State under 1311  [1] of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, [...]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/36B | title = 26 U.S. Code § 36B - Refundable credit for coverage under a qualified health plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IRS regulation reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
(a) In general. An applicable taxpayer (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this section) is allowed a premium assistance amount only for any month that one or more members of the applicable taxpayer's family (the applicable taxpayer or the applicable taxpayer's spouse or dependent)—

(1) Is enrolled in one or more qualified health plans through an Exchange [ . . . ]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2012-05-23/pdf/2012-12421.pdf 26 C.F.R. § 1.36B-2(a)(1).]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The IRS defined the term "Exchange" as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[ . . . ] a governmental agency or non-profit entity that meets the applicable standards of this part [part 155 of title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations] and makes QHPs [qualified health plans] available to qualified individuals and/or qualified employers. Unless otherwise identified, this term includes an Exchange serving the individual market for qualified individuals and a SHOP [Small Business Health Options Program] serving the small group market for qualified employers, regardless of whether the Exchange is established and operated by a State (including a regional Exchange or subsidiary Exchange) or by HHS [the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccf.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Final-Rule-on-Establishment-of-Exchanges-and-Qualified-Health-Plans.pdf 45 C.F.R. section 155.20, by reference to 26 C.F.R. § 1.36B-1(a) and (k) and 26 C.F.R. § 1.36B-2(a)(1).]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''Chevron'' test==
In ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.]]'' the Supreme Court ruled that the U.S Congress may delegate regulatory authority to an agency, and that the agency's regulations carry the weight of the law, if the regulations pass the two-part "Chevron test".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Scalia | first = Antonin | authorlink = Antonin Scalia |title = Judicial Deference to Administrative Interpretations of Law |journal = Duke Law Journal | volume = 1989 | number = 3 |year = 1989 |pages = 511–521 |url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3075&amp;context=dlj | doi=10.2307/1372576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(1) "First, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court as well as the agency must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress."

"If the Court determines Congress has not directly addressed the precise question at issue, the court does not simply impose its own construction of the statute .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Rather,

(2) [I]f the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific question, the issue for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." ''Chevron U.S.A. v. NRDC'', 467 U.S. 837, 842–843 (1984).

The Fourth Circuit's opinion had ruled that the statutory language was ambiguous and applied the Chevron doctrine, meaning that the IRS's regulatory ruling was given deference. However, in the Supreme Court's majority ruling this test is said to have been failed because "had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly." Had the Court applied the Chevron doctrine and deferred to the IRS, a subsequent IRS ruling could have overturned the subsidies being available on the federal exchange.

==Arguments==

===Legislative intent===
Plaintiffs argue that Congress intentionally restricted payment of subsidies to state exchanges to induce states into setting up exchanges so their citizens could receive subsidies.

The government argues that the law intends for federal exchanges to be treated identically to state exchanges (and therefore qualifying individuals are entitled to subsidies whether or not their state has set up an exchange), or, in the alternative, if the law were ambiguous, that the regulation at issue was a permissible interpretation of the law.

[[Lyle Denniston]] wrote that the parties' positions offer differing views on how to interpret legislation:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The challengers take the “literal interpretation” approach, although they also have policy reasons for reading the ACA as they do.  The Obama administration takes the “broader purpose” approach, contending that Congress would not have set up the insurance program on a basis that is as limited as the challengers contend.&lt;ref name="Denniston07NOV2014"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2009 paper published in ''The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics'', [[Timothy Jost]] argued that one way to avoid a [[commandeer]]ing issue with the ACA would be "by offering tax subsidies for insurance only in states that complied with federal requirements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Jost | first = Timothy S. | authorlink = Timothy Jost | title = Health Insurance Exchanges: Legal Issues | journal = The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics | volume = 37 | issue = S2 | pages = 51–70 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-720X.2009.00420.x | url = http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1022&amp;context=ois_papers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cannon | first = Michael F. | title = Why One Should Take Timothy Jost's 'Halbig' Pronouncements With A Grain Of Salt | date = July 10, 2014 | url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelcannon/2014/07/10/why-one-should-take-timothy-josts-halbig-pronouncements-with-a-grain-of-salt/ | website = [[Forbes.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jost later published an [[op-ed]] in the ''Washington Post'' arguing that allowing subsidies for Federal exchanges is "the only way of reading the statute that makes sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Jost | first = Timothy S. | authorlink = Timothy Jost | title = Courts won't void the Affordable Care Act over semantics | date = July 9, 2014 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/courts-wont-void-the-affordable-care-act-over-semantics/2014/07/09/5910c9d0-060b-11e4-a0dd-f2b22a257353_story.html | website = [[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article on [[Forbes]], Jost pointed out that his original law journal article proposed "several alternatives through which Congress could encourage the states to establish exchanges, one of which was to limit the availability of tax credits to states that operate exchanges.  The first alternative [proposed] was that Congress ask the states to establish exchanges, but create a federal fallback exchange in the event they failed to do so."&lt;ref name="Jost14JUL2014"/&gt;

On January 18, 2012, [[Jonathan Gruber (economist)|Jonathan Gruber]], a [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] economist who was a consultant on the ACA, said, "What's important to remember politically about this is if you're a state and you don't set up an exchange, that means your citizens don’t get their tax credits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Radia | first = Ryan | title = Obamacare Architect Admitted in 2012 States without Exchanges Lose Subsidies  | date = July 24, 2014 | url=https://cei.org/blog/obamacare-architect-admitted-2012-states-without-exchanges-lose-subsidies | website = [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10, 2012, Gruber said, "... if your governor doesn’t set up an exchange, you're losing hundreds of millions of dollars of tax credits to be delivered to your citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Serwer | first = Adam | title = Adviser's past remarks could give Obamacare a headache | date = July 26, 2014 | url = http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/jonathan-gruber-video-obamacare#53439 | website = [[msnbc]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gruber has characterized his earlier statements as "a mistake", and said that he "might have been thinking that if the federal backstop wasn't ready by 2014, and states hadn't set up their own exchange, there was a risk that citizens couldn't get the tax credits right away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cohn | first = Jonathan | authorlink = Jonathan Cohn | title = Jonathan Gruber: 'It Was Just a Mistake' | date = July 25, 2014 | url = https://newrepublic.com/article/118851/jonathan-gruber-halbig-says-quote-exchanges-was-mistake | website = [[The New Republic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah Kliff of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' cited as evidence of Gruber's comments being mistaken the fact that despite speaking "regularly to dozens of reporters during this period", he "never mentioned this idea to any of them",  and that his models always assumed that subsidies would be available on both state and federal exchanges.&lt;ref name=kliff&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kliff|first1=Sarah|title=The Jon Gruber controversy and what it means for Obamacare, explained|url=https://www.vox.com/2014/11/13/7211279/obamacare-jon-gruber-controversy |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]] |publisher=[[Vox Media]] |accessdate=November 29, 2014|date=November 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a December 2014 Congressional hearing, Gruber characterized his comments as "reflecting uncertainty about the federal exchange".&lt;ref name=weigel&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weigel|first1=David|title=The Three-Pronged, Four-Hour Grilling of Jonathan Gruber|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-09/the-threepronged-fourhour-grilling-of-jonathan-gruber|website=Bloomberg Politics|accessdate=December 12, 2014|date=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''King'' plaintiffs, in their briefs filed in December 2014, referred to Gruber's comments as an indication of Congressional intent supporting their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Roger | last = Parloff |date = March 2, 2015 |title = Why Chief Justice Roberts will save Obamacare again |website = [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |url  = http://fortune.com/2015/03/02/why-chief-justice-roberts-will-save-obamacare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the challengers in the Supreme Court case have argued that then Nebraska Sen. [[Ben Nelson]], who by insisting that states take the lead in establishing the exchanges, meant that Congress had intended that tax credits go only to qualified recipients in states that had established their own insurance exchanges, Nelson has denied this interpretation in an amicus brief filed with the court, January 28, 2015. In a letter to Sen.

Others have argued that the issue is due to a drafting error during the legislative process.&lt;ref name="McIntyre04MAR2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Carlson | first = Joe | title = Obamacare legal battle threatens subsidies for millions | date = June 14, 2014 | url = http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20140614/MAGAZINE/306149796 | website = [[Modern Healthcare]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Yale Law School]] Professor Abbe Gluck said that the unusual maneuver of having the ACA become law through [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation]] required a preliminary version of the bill to become law without the "usual legislative clean-up process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Gluck | first = Abbe | title = How Congress Works (And the ObamaCare Subsidies Lawsuit) | date = December 12, 2013 | url = http://isps.yale.edu/news/blog/2013/12/how-congress-works-and-the-obamacare-subsidies-lawsuit | website =The Institution for Social and Policy Studies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal standing===
Plaintiffs argue that they have [[standing (law)|standing]] because, without the subsidies, they would be exempt from the individual mandate because the cost of the cheapest insurance plan exceeded 8% of their income, but, with the subsidies, the subsidized cost was low enough to require plaintiffs to purchase insurance or pay a penalty.&lt;ref name=john&gt;{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Arit|title=The Two Questions that Could Make or Break the Case Against Obamacare|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2015-02-13/the-two-questions-that-could-make-or-break-the-case-against-obamacare|website=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=February 16, 2015|date=February 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another plaintiff provided the court with a motel address, which was used to calculate the cost of insurance, as well as the amount of subsidies; a different address might result in different amounts that may cause her not to have standing.  The fourth plaintiff stated that she made $10,000 per year as a substitute teacher, an income low enough to be exempt from the individual mandate, although the Competitive Enterprise Institute suggested that she might have additional income from other work.  The investigations also suggested that some plaintiffs may lack standing because the cheapest available subsidized insurance was over 8% of their income, making them exempt from the individual mandate.&lt;ref name=john/&gt;

The Fourth Circuit court unanimously upheld the regulation, saying that the wording in the statute was ambiguous, and that the IRS wording was a reasonable interpretation of the statute:&lt;ref name="Frieden22JUL2014"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The plaintiffs-appellants bring this suit challenging the validity of an Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) final rule implementing the premium tax credit provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA” or “Act”). The final rule interprets the ACA as authorizing the IRS to grant tax credits to individuals who purchase health insurance on both state-run insurance “Exchanges” and federally facilitated “Exchanges” created and operated by the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). The plaintiffs contend that the IRS’s interpretation is contrary to the language of the statute, which, they assert, authorizes tax credits only for individuals who purchase insurance on state-run Exchanges. For reasons explained below, we find that the applicable statutory language is ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations. Applying deference to the IRS’s determination, however, we uphold the rule as a permissible exercise of the agency’s discretion. [....]Rejecting all of the plaintiffs' arguments as to why Chevron deference is inappropriate in this case, for the reasons explained above we are satisfied that the IRS Rule is a permissible construction of the statutory language.

Although the court ruled unanimously for the government, the opinion stated that it  "cannot ignore the common-sense appeal of the plaintiffs’ argument; a literal reading of the statute undoubtedly accords more closely with [the plaintiffs’] position," and "the [government has] the stronger position, although only slightly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Scott A | last = Coffina | date = November 15, 2014 | title = Is Obamacare in Critical Condition? |website = [[The Legal Intelligencer]] |url = http://www.thelegalintelligencer.com/id=1202677282457/Is-Obamacare-in-Critical-Condition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They argue that the controlling phrase "an Exchange established by the State" is "buried in two sub-sections," which effectively "'hide[s] elephants in mouseholes,'" were it to mean that Congress imposed the condition on the states that they must establish their own exchanges or their residents would not receive federal subsidies; they say that because of this, the phrases "fail the ''Pennhurst'' clear-notice test," thereby making the foregoing condition invalid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/publications/supreme_court_preview/BriefsV5/14-114_amicus_affirm_va.authcheckdam.pdf Brief of the Commonwealths of Virginia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, the States of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, and the District of Columbia as ''Amici Curiae'' in Support of Affirmance]&lt;/ref&gt;  Numerous individuals and organizations filed amicus briefs in support of both sides.

The [[American Public Health Association]] and the deans of 19 schools of public health filed an amicus brief in support of the government. In the brief, the public health officials estimated that eliminating the premium tax credits in states that use the federal exchange would result in 9,800 additional deaths per year. This figure was based on earlier studies of the impact of the [[Massachusetts health care reform]] law on death rates in that state. The brief stated that residents of the 34 states that use the Federal exchange tend to be less healthy and have less access to healthcare than residents of the states that created their own exchanges. The brief argues that eliminating the subsidies will increase this disparity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eliminating Tax Subsidies in 34 States would Result in Millions of Uninsured and Thousands of Preventable Deaths, Public Health Amicus Brief Argues in King v.

The Court of Appeals stated:

::Because we conclude that the ACA [the Affordable Care Act] unambiguously restricts the [Internal Revenue Code] section 36B subsidy to insurance purchased on Exchanges "established by the State", we reverse the district court and vacate the IRS's regulation [26 C.F.R. § 1.36B-2(a)(1)].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Halbig v.

== Opinion of the Court ==
On June 25, 2015, the Supreme Court issued its ruling, written by Chief Justice Roberts, and joined by Justices Kennedy, Breyer, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, rejecting the challenge to the act. The Court noted that previous attempts to reform health care insurance "encouraged people to wait until they got sick to buy insurance" resulting in "an economic 'death spiral': premiums rose, the number of people buying insurance declined, and insurers left the market entirely."
 
It further noted that in 2006 "Massachusetts discovered a way to make the guaranteed issue and community rating requirements work—by requiring individuals to buy insurance and by providing tax credits to certain individuals to make insurance more affordable." and that "the Affordable Care Act adopts a version of the three key reforms that made the Massachusetts system successful."

The Court found that the ''Chevron'' test "does not provide the appropriate framework here." and also rejected the Court of Appeals approach of deferring to the IRS: "The tax credits are one of the Act’s key reforms and whether they are available on Federal Exchanges is a question of deep 'economic and political significance'; had Congress wished to assign that question to an agency, it surely would have done so expressly. And it is especially unlikely that Congress would have delegated this decision to the IRS, which has no expertise in crafting health insurance policy of this sort." It concluded that it is "the Court's task to determine the correct reading of Section 36B."

Citing ''[[FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp]]'', the Court noted that "when deciding whether the language is plain, the Court must read the words 'in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.{{' "}}

{{quote|1=When read in context, the phrase "an Exchange established by the State under [42 U. S. C. §18031]" is properly viewed as ambiguous. The phrase may be limited in its reach to State Exchanges. But it could also refer to all Exchanges—both State and Federal—for purposes of the tax credits. If a State chooses not to follow the directive in Section 18031 to establish an Exchange, the Act tells the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish "such Exchange." §18041. And by using the words "such Exchange," the Act indicates that State and Federal Exchanges should be the same. But State and Federal Exchanges would differ in a fundamental way if tax credits were available only on State Exchanges—one type of Exchange would help make insurance more affordable by providing billions of dollars to the States' citizens; the other type of Exchange would not.}}

Having found the text ambiguous, the Court, citing ''[[United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates]],'' (an opinion written by Justice Scalia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/484/365 |title=UNITED SAVINGS ASSOCIATION OF TEXAS, Petitioner v. TIMBERS OF INWOOD FOREST ASSOCIATES, LTD. &amp;#124; US Law &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |website=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;) looked "to the broader structure of the Act to determine whether one of Section 36B's 'permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law.{{' "}} It rejected petitioners' interpretation "because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any State with a Federal
Exchange, and likely create the very 'death spirals' that Congress designed the Act to avoid."&lt;ref&gt;''King v. Burwell'', slip op. at 16.&lt;/ref&gt; The Court observed that the petitioners' interpretation would make the ACA "operate quite differently in a State with a Federal Exchange. As they see it, one of the Act's three major reforms—the tax credits—would not apply. And a second major reform—the coverage requirement—would not apply in a meaningful way...[W]ithout the tax credits, the coverage requirement would apply to fewer individuals. And it would be a lot fewer...If petitioners are right, therefore, only one of the Act's three major reforms would apply in States with a Federal Exchange."&lt;ref&gt;''King v. Burwell'', slip op. at 16-17 (citation omitted).&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the statutory scheme compels us to reject petitioners’ interpretation because it would destabilize the individual insurance market in any State with a Federal Exchange, and likely create the very “death spirals” that Congress designed the Act to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;''King v. Burwell'', slip op. at 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the Fourth Circuit, the Court chose not to rely on the IRS interpretation, noting the “economic and political significance” of the question and the IRS's lack of expertise in health insurance policy. By choosing instead to resolve the ambiguous language of the statute by looking at the purpose of the statute as a whole rather than by applying the Chevron doctrine, the Court's decision precludes the possibility of the IRS reversing in the future its decision to have subsidies available on the federally run exchange.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/news/the-report/articles/2015/06/26/how-king-v-burwell-ended-the-obamacare-wars ''It's All Over But the Shouting, U.S. News and World Report], Robert Schlesinger, June 26, 2015, "As a practical matter that means that a future Republican president cannot order the IRS to reinterpret the statute to exclude subsidies for those on federal exchanges."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent===

In a [[dissenting opinion|dissent]] joined by Justices Thomas and Alito, Justice Scalia wrote: "The Court holds that when the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act says 'Exchange established by the State it means 'Exchange established by the State or the Federal Government.' That is of course quite absurd, and the Court’s 21 pages of explanation make it no less so." He then ridiculed the decision, saying that the Affordable Care Act should be called "SCOTUScare."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;''King v. Burwell'', slip op. at 21 (Scalia, J. dissenting).&lt;/ref&gt;

Scalia further noted that the rest of the ACA carefully distinguishes between exchanges established by states and those established by the federal government through Health and Human Services. Scalia cited differences between where the document identifies how the different exchanges receive funding, authority, and names. Scalia used this to argue that the context of the law does not allow for the phrase "established by the state" to mean "established by the state and federal government." He reminds the reader that the purpose of looking at the context of phrases is for "understanding the terms of the law, not [to make] an excuse for rewriting them."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Later, Scalia also pointed out that interpreting the phrase "by the State" as "by the state and federal government" not only eliminates all meaning from the first phrase, but causes problems of interpretation elsewhere in the ACA. "The State" is identified distinctly in the ACA with regards to the formula for calculating tax credits, for screening children for tax credit eligibility, for using a "secure electronic interface" for tax credit screening, for other agencies, for directions on operating web sites, and for guidelines around the enrollment of children. Of this, Scalia mentioned that "[i]t is bad enough for a court to cross out 'by the State' once. But seven times?"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

The extensive use of the term "by the State" also contrasts against the more extensive use of more general terms. "Clause after clause of the law uses a more general term such as 'Exchange.'" Scalia pointed out that the court should defer to the specific meaning of this term, and that assuming that the "by the State" term is general does not fit appropriate rules of interpretation. Scalia also notes that the ACA knows how to equate unlike terms explicitly, as it declared that "[a] territory that...establishes...an Exchange...shall be treated as a State." The ACA does not have such an equivalency clause for exchanges established by the federal government.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

This is a '''list of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll'''.
It covers the name of the event, the location, and the start and end of each event. Some events may belong in more than one category. In addition, some of the listed events overlap each other, and in some cases the death toll from a smaller event is included in the one for the larger event or time period of which it was part.

==Wars and armed conflicts whose highest estimated casualties are 100,000 or more==

The earlier, "unofficial" part of the period, from 184 to 220, was marked by chaotic infighting between warlords in various parts of China.

Indigenous people north and south were displaced, died of disease, and were killed by Europeans through slavery, rape and war. In 1491, about 145 million people lived in the western hemisphere. By 1691, the population of indigenous Americans had declined by 90–95 percent."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spanish Empire]], [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas]], [[Native American disease and epidemics]]. These death toll estimates vary due to lack of consensus as to the demographic size of the native population pre-Columbus, which some say might never be accurately determined. Modern scholarship tend to side with the higher estimates, but there is still variance based on calculation methods used. Even using conservative populations estimates, however, "one dreadful conclusion is inescapable: the 150 years after Columbus's arrival brought a toll on human life in this hemisphere comparable to all of the world's losses during World War II. ... Against the alien agents of disease, the indigenous people never had a chance. Their immune systems were unprepared to fight smallpox and measles, malaria and yellow fever. The epidemics that resulted have been well documented."&lt;ref name="NYT3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/29/science/don-t-blame-columbus-for-all-the-indians-ills.html|title=Don't Blame Columbus for All the Indians' Ills|date=October 29, 2002|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small industry of researchers in recent years have focused their attention on Native American population size in 1492, and the subsequent decimation of the population after contact with Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Richard H. Steckel and Jerome C. Rose: ''The Backbone of History Health and Nutrition in the Western Hemisphere'', Cambridge University Press; 1st edition; pg. 79; {{ISBN|9780521617444}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have stated that their findings in no way diminish the "dreadful impact Old World diseases had on the people of the New World. But it suggests that the New World was hardly a healthful Eden." For example, they note that as the previously thriving indigenous peoples became more urbanized and less mobile, they succumbed to the same declining sanitation and health conditions of other urban cultures, including tuberculosis. The researchers stress, however, that "their findings in no way mitigated the responsibility of Europeans as bearers of disease devastating to native societies."&lt;ref name="NYT3"/&gt;}}

||The term "Ukrainian Genocide" usually refers to the man-made famine of 1932 through 1933, called the [[Holodomor]], in which the grain of [[Ukrainians]] was confiscated to the point where they could not survive off the amount of grain they had, and were also restricted from fleeing their villages to find food under threat of execution or deportation into a [[Gulag]] camp. 
The term also includes the killing of Ukrainian intelligentsia during the [[Great Purge]], especially the [[Orthodox Church]]. 

The main advocate for this view was [[Raphael Lemkin]], creator of the word [[genocide]]. 

Data from after the opening of the Soviet archives records deaths at 2.4 to 7.5 million in famine, 300,000 during the purge, and 1,100 from the [[Law of Spikelets]].

Some scholars dispute that the famine was deliberately engineered by the Soviet government or that it was a genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=Robert|authorlink1=Robert William Davies|last2=Wheatcroft|first2=Stephen|authorlink2=Stephen G.

||After the fall of the [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] the [[Qing]] government cracked down on the [[Hakka]] ethnic group for allying with the kingdom slaughtering 30,000 per day. The death toll of the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] is estimated to be 1,000,000 and there was also a mass execution done during the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. It is unclear whether these events refer to the Qing crackdown.

||It is difficult to determine the total number of people who died as a result of Indian massacres. However, one book, ''The Wild Frontier: Atrocities during the American-Indian War from Jamestown Colony to Wounded Knee'', presents an estimate by counting every recorded atrocity in the area that would eventually become the continental United States, from first contact (1511) to the closing of the frontier (1890). The parameters were limited to the intentional and indiscriminate [[murder]], [[torture]], or mutilation of civilians, the wounded, and prisoners. The results revealed that 7,193 people died from atrocities perpetrated by those of European descent, and 9,156 people died from atrocities perpetrated by Native Americans.&lt;ref name="Osborn, William M. 2001"&gt;Osborn, William M.

While use of the term "genocide" to describe Canada's treatment of Indigenous peoples has created a great deal of debate, there has always been a recognition that, at minimum, Canada was guilty of "cultural genocide," even if individuals couldn't bring themselves to accept more sinister intentions. Former prime minister Paul Martin told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) that it was time to call the residential schools policy what it was: "cultural genocide." Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin weighed in on Canada's dismal human rights record, saying that residential schools were attempts to commit "cultural genocide" against Indigenous peoples.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War crimes and ancient war atrocities==
''Massacres and unnatural deaths that occurred during wars and were committed or caused by military or quasi-military forces (including terrorism, insurgent forces, and inter-communal violence). They may not particularly target ethnic, religious, or political groups but are usually part of a military strategy that disregards civilian lives, or they may be arbitrary acts of cruelty. Please try to only include events in which the majority of victims were civilians or which are often referred to as atrocities by significant mainstream scholarship.''

The principal actors in the war were the [[Communist Party of Peru]] or "Shining Path" and the government of Peru; the [[Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement]] was also involved and other paramilitary entities. Terrorists deliberately targeted and killed civilians, kidnap and torture civil people and even force indigenous people to live in slavery, on the other side, some military forces, due to bad strategies, attacked civilian people in the highlands making the conflict more bloody than any other war in Peruvian history since the European colonization of the country.&lt;br /&gt;Death toll may include non-civilian victims.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

||Putting an end to most foreign trade relationships, [[Ranavalona I]] pursued a policy of self-reliance, made possible through frequent use of the long-standing tradition of ''[[Corvée#Madagascar|fanompoana]]''—forced labor in lieu of tax payments in money or goods. Ranavalona continued the wars of expansion conducted by her predecessor, [[Radama I]], in an effort to extend her realm over the entire island, and imposed strict punishments on those who were judged as having acted in opposition to her will. Due in large part to loss of life throughout the years of military campaigns, high death rates among ''fanompoana'' workers, and harsh traditions of justice under her rule, the population of Madagascar is estimated to have declined from around 5 million to 2.5 million between 1833–39, and from 750,000 to 130,000 between 1829-42 in Imerina.&lt;ref name="Stats"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Campbell|first=Gwyn|date=October 1991|title=The state and pre-colonial demographic history: the case of nineteenth century Madagascar|journal=Journal of African History|volume=23|issue=3|pages=415–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; These statistics have contributed to a strongly unfavorable view of Ranavalona's rule in historical accounts.&lt;ref name="Laidler 2005"&gt;Laidler (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===South Africa (1950–1989)===
Maye was born in 1948 in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], Canada, a twin&lt;ref name="How Elon Musk’s Mom (and her Twin Sister) Raised the First Family of Tech"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Emily Jane|title=How Elon Musk’s Mom (and her Twin Sister) Raised the First Family of Tech|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/10/elon-musk-family-maye-musk|website=The Hive|publisher=Vanity Fair|accessdate=20 July 2017|language=en|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of five children.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Her family moved to [[Pretoria]], South Africa, in 1950. Her parents, Winnifred Josephine "Wyn" (Fletcher) and Joshua Norman Haldeman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elonmusk.info/2015/03/elons-mother.html|title=Elon's Mother|website=www.elonmusk.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; were adventurous and flew the family around the world in a [[propeller (aeronautics)|prop plane]] in 1952. For over ten years the family would spend time roaming the [[Kalahari desert]] in search of its fabled [[Lost City of the Kalahari]]. Their parents gave slide shows and talks about their journeys, "My parents were very famous, but they were never snobs," Maye said.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

As a young woman, Maye was a finalist in the 1969 Miss South Africa beauty competition.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; In 1970, she married Errol Musk, a South African engineer she met in high school. They had three children: [[Elon Musk]], [[Kimbal Musk]] and [[Tosca Musk]]. She earned a Master's degree in [[dietetics]] from the [[University of the Orange Free State]] in South Africa.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; She later earned another Master's degree in [[nutritional science]] from the [[University of Toronto]].

In 1979 she divorced Errol. Two years later Elon decided to live with his father. Kimbal joined Elon four years later.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; After graduating high school, Elon decided to move to Canada, and Maye followed him there with the rest of her children six months later in 1989.&lt;ref name=nyp/&gt;

===Canada and United States (1989–present)===
Her modeling career continued in Canada.&lt;ref name=nyp/&gt; She has appeared on boxes of [[Special K]] cereal,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; in [[Revlon]] ads,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; in a [[Beyoncé]] video,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; she appeared nude on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine for a health issue;&lt;ref name=nyp/&gt; also nude on the cover of ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine in 2011 with a fake pregnant belly;&lt;ref name=nyp/&gt; she was on the cover of ''Elle Canada'' in 2012;&lt;ref name=nyp/&gt; and starred in advertisement campaigns for [[Target Corporation|Target]] and [[Virgin America]].&lt;ref name=nyp/&gt; In 2015, she was signed by [[IMG Models]].&lt;ref name=nyp/&gt; In September 2017, she became [[CoverGirl]]'s oldest spokesmodel at age 69, which one news story reported as "making history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/beauty/a12476808/maye-musk-is-the-newest-face-of-covergirl/|title=This 69-Year-Old Model Is the Newest Face Of Covergirl|date=27 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/28/elon-musks-mom-maye-musk-just-became-covergirls-oldest-model.html|title=Elon Musk's mom Maye Musk just made history by scoring this modeling gig|first=Zameena|last=Mejia|date=28 September 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2633">The term '''morbilliform''' refers to a [[rash]] that looks like [[measles]]. The rash consists of [[Macule|macular]] [[lesion]]s that are red and usually 2–10&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter but may be confluent in places.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pediatrics.wisc.edu/education/derm/tutc/morbilliform.html Primary Care Dermatology Module. Nomenclature of Skin Lesions] The [[University of Wisconsin]]. Department of Pediatrics. Retrieved on Nov 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; A morbilliform rash is a rose-red flat ([[macular]]) or slightly elevated ([[maculopapular]]) eruption, showing circular or elliptical lesions varying in diameter from 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;mm, with healthy-looking skin intervening.

Patients with measles will have the rash but there are other syndromes and infections that will display the same symptom such as patients with [[Kawasaki disease]],&lt;ref name=thefreedict/&gt; [[meningococcal]] [[petechiae]] or [[Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome]],&lt;ref name=thefreedict/&gt; [[Dengue]], [[Roseola]], congenital syphilis,&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;American Family Physician Sept 1st 2012 Vol 86 No 5 pp381-482 Syphilis: A re-emerging infection.&lt;/ref&gt; [[rubella]],&lt;ref name=thefreedict/&gt; [[echovirus|Echovirus 9]],&lt;ref name=thefreedict&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/morbilliform+rash thefreedictionary.com &gt; morbilliform rash] Retrieved on Nov 30, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; drug hypersensitivity reactions (in particular with certain classes of [[antiretroviral drug]]s, such as [[abacavir]] and [[nevirapine]], and also the antiepileptic drug [[phenytoin]]), or other conditions may also have a morbilliform rash.

One cause of morbilliform rash is an allergic reaction to transfused blood/blood components. In such a case, the skin lesions would develop within a few hours (Approx. 4hours) of transfusion along with pruritus. The condition may even present with other symptoms, such as conjunctival oedema, oedema in the lips and tongue, and even localised angioedema. On rare occasions, the condition may even escalate to anaphylactic shock where pulmonary restrictions are seen. The associated cause for this is a reaction against an allergen that is seldom identified during testing. Transfusing products with anti-IgA antibodies to IgA-deficient patients has also been a suspected cause for such reactions. Management usually relates to the stoppage of transfusion for around 30minutes, until given antihistamines take effect. Transfusion may even be continued after, if no further progression is seen.

==Blood Service==
Blood Transfusion Service of Nepal Red Cross Society was established in the year 1966 i.e. 3 years after the inception of the Society itself. The government of Nepal, in its policy declaration of 1991, has mandated Nepal Red Cross Society as the sole authority in conducting blood programmes in Nepal.

===Central level===
The Central Blood Transfusion Service Center (CBTSC) in Kathmandu is responsible for management of services in the Kathmandu valley, and for supervising and monitoring the technical standards of the district centers, providing guidance to ensure the collection and supply of safe blood.

===Regional level===
Four of the five regions have blood transfusion service centers at Biratnagar, Pokhra, Nepalganj and Chitwan. Those provide local services, and thus there is no distinct functioning management structure at the regional level.

===District level===
The district BTSCs are managed by NRCS district chapters. These centres are supposed to comply with guidelines provided under the 1983 NRCS regulations and the 1998 Standard Operating Procedures.

==Eye Hospital==
Nepal Red Cross Society has been managing eye care services as a key component of health service in Mid-West Region (Province no 6) since 1990s through eye care centers (Surkhet, Dailekh, Jajarkot and Bardia) and outreach program with the support of Swiss Red Cross. NRCS is operating 2 eye hospitals and extended eye care centers within the country.

An '''opinion poll''', often simply referred to as a '''poll''' or a '''survey''', is a [[survey (human research)|human research survey]] of [[public opinion]] from a particular [[sampling (statistics)|sample]]. Opinion polls are usually designed to represent the opinions of a population by conducting a series of questions and then extrapolating generalities in ratio or within [[confidence intervals]].

== History ==
The first known example of an opinion poll was a local [[straw poll]] conducted by ''The Harrisburg Pennsylvanian''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.stackexchange.com/a/49678/24858|title=Who conducted the first "straw poll" in U.S. election politics, and when was it conducted?|website=History Stack Exchange|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Tom W.|date=1990|title=The First Straw?: A Study of the Origins of Election Polls|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2749389|journal=The Public Opinion Quarterly|volume=54|issue=1|pages=21–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824]], showing [[Andrew Jackson]] leading [[John Quincy Adams]] by 335 votes to 169 in the contest for the [[United States Presidency]]. Since Jackson won the popular vote in that state and the whole country, such straw votes gradually became more popular, but they remained local, usually citywide phenomena. In 1916, ''[[The Literary Digest]]'' embarked on a national survey (partly as a circulation-raising exercise) and correctly predicted [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s election as president. Mailing out millions of [[postcard]]s and simply counting the returns, ''The Literary Digest'' correctly predicted the victories of [[Warren Harding]] in 1920, [[Calvin Coolidge]] in 1924, [[Herbert Hoover]] in 1928, and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1932.

Then, in [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936]], its 2.3 million "voters" constituted a huge sample, but they were generally more affluent Americans who tended to have [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] sympathies. ''The Literary Digest'' was ignorant of this new bias; the week before election day, it reported that [[Alf Landon]] was far more popular than Roosevelt. At the same time, [[George Gallup]] conducted a far smaller (but more scientifically based) survey, in which he polled a demographically representative sample. Gallup correctly predicted Roosevelt's landslide victory. ''The Literary Digest'' soon went out of business, while polling started to take off.

[[Elmo Roper]] was another American pioneer in [[political forecasting]] using scientific polls.&lt;ref name="cantril"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cantril |first1=Hadley |first2=Mildred |last2=Strunk |year=1951 |url=https://www.questia.com/read/98754561?title=Public%20Opinion%2c%201935-1946 |title=Public Opinion, 1935-1946 |publisher= Princeton University Press |page= vii }}&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted the reelection of President Franklin D. Roosevelt three times, in 1936, 1940, and 1944. [[Louis Harris]] had been in the field of public opinion since 1947 when he joined the Elmo Roper firm, then later became partner.

In September 1938 Jean Stoetzel, after having met Gallup, created IFOP, the Institut Français d'Opinion Publique, as the first European survey institute in Paris and started political polls in summer 1939 with the question "[[Why Die for Danzig?|Why die for Danzig?]]", looking for popular support or dissent with this question asked by appeasement politician and future collaborationist [[Marcel Déat]].

[[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] launched a subsidiary in the [[United Kingdom]] that, almost alone, correctly predicted [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour's]] victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 general election]], unlike virtually all other commentators, who expected a victory for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], led by [[Winston Churchill]].

The Allied occupation powers helped to create survey institutes in all of the Western occupation zones of Germany in 1947 and 1948 to better steer [[denazification]]. By the 1950s, various types of polling had spread to most democracies.

In long-term perspective, advertising had come under heavy pressure in the early 1930s. The Great Depression forced businesses to drastically cut back on their advertising spending. Layoffs and reductions were common at all agencies. The [[New Deal]] furthermore aggressively promoted consumerism, and minimized the value of (or need for) advertising. Historian Jackson Lears argues that "By the late 1930s, though, corporate advertisers had begun a successful counterattack against their critics." They rehabilitated the concept of consumer sovereignty by inventing scientific public opinion polls, and making it the centerpiece of their own market research, as well as the key to understanding politics. [[George Gallup]], the vice president of Young and Rubicam, and numerous other advertising experts, led the way.  Moving into the 1940s, the industry played a leading role in the ideological mobilization of the American people for fighting the Nazis and Japanese in World War II. As part of that effort, they redefined the "American Way of Life" in terms of a commitment to free enterprise. "Advertisers," Lears concludes, "played a crucial hegemonic role in creating the consumer culture that dominated post-World War II American society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jackson Lears|title=Fables Of Abundance: A Cultural History Of Advertising In America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RgoXBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA235|year=1995|publisher=Basic Books|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean M. Converse," ''Survey Research in the United States: Roots and Emergence 1960'' (1987) pp: 114-24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sample and polling methods ==
[[Image:Voter poll.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Voter polling questionnaire on display at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]]]
Opinion polls for many years were maintained through telecommunications or in person-to-person contact.  Methods and techniques vary, though they are widely accepted in most areas. Over the years, technological innovations have also influenced survey methods such as the availability of [[Ferranti MRT|electronic clipboards]]&lt;ref&gt;G. Rowley, K. Barker, V. Callaghan (1986) “''The Market Research Terminal &amp; Developments in Survey Research''”, European Journal of Marketing, Vol. 20 Issue: 2, pp.35 - 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and Internet based polling. Verbal, ballot, and processed types can be conducted efficiently, contrasted with other types of surveys, systematics, and complicated matrices beyond previous orthodox procedures.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}&lt;!-- this is just a string of jargon imparting no useful information ... --&gt;

Opinion polling developed into popular applications through popular thought, although response rates for some surveys declined. Also, the following has also led to differentiating results:&lt;ref name="cantril"/&gt; Some polling organizations, such as [[Angus Reid Public Opinion]], [[YouGov]] and [[Zogby International|Zogby]] use [[Internet]] surveys, where a sample is drawn from a large panel of volunteers, and the results are weighted to reflect the demographics of the population of interest. In contrast, popular web polls draw on whoever wishes to participate, rather than a scientific sample of the population, and are therefore not generally considered professional.

Recently, statistical learning methods have been proposed in order to exploit [[social media]] content (such as posts on the micro-blogging platform of [[Twitter]]) for modelling and predicting voting intention polls.&lt;ref name="lampos2013"&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/236142275_A_user-centric_model_of_voting_intention_from_Social_Media Vasileios Lampos, Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro and Trevor Cohn. A user-centric model of voting intention from social media. Proceedings of the 51st Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics. ACL, pp. 993-1003, 2013 Retrieved 16-06-4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oconnor2010"&gt;Brendan O'Connor, Ramnath Balasubramanyan, Bryan R Routledge, and Noah A Smith. From Tweets to Polls: Linking Text Sentiment to Public Opinion Time Series. In Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media. AAAI Press, pp. 122–129, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polls can be used in the public relations field as well.  In the early 1920s, public relation experts described their work as a two-way street.  Their job would be to present the misinterpreted interests of large institutions to public.  They would also gauge the typically ignored interests of the public through polls.

=== Benchmark polls ===
A ''benchmark poll'' is generally the first poll taken in a campaign.  It is often taken before a candidate announces their bid for office but sometimes it happens immediately following that announcement after they have had some opportunity to raise funds.  This is generally a short and simple survey of likely voters.

A ''benchmark poll'' serves a number of purposes for a campaign, whether it is a political campaign or some other type of campaign.  First, it gives the candidate a picture of where they stand with the electorate before any campaigning takes place.  If the poll is done prior to announcing for office the candidate may use the poll to decide whether or not they should even run for office.  Secondly, it shows them where their weaknesses and strengths are in two main areas.  The first is the electorate.  A ''benchmark poll'' shows them what types of voters they are sure to win, those they are sure to lose, and everyone in-between these two extremes.  This lets the campaign know which voters are persuadable so they can spend their limited resources in the most effective manner.  Second, it can give them an idea of what messages, ideas, or slogans are the strongest with the electorate.&lt;ref name="Benchmark Polls"&gt;Kenneth F. Warren (1992). "in Defense of Public Opinion Polling." Westview Press. p. 200-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brushfire polls ===
''Brushfire polls'' are polls taken during the period between the ''benchmark poll'' and ''tracking polls''.  The number of ''brushfire polls'' taken by a campaign is determined by how competitive the race is and how much money the campaign has to spend.  These polls usually focus on likely voters and the length of the survey varies on the number of messages being tested.

''Brushfire polls'' are used for a number of purposes.  First, it lets the candidate know if they have made any progress on the ballot, how much progress has been made, and in what demographics they have been making or losing ground.  Secondly, it is a way for the campaign to test a variety of messages, both positive and negative, on themselves and their opponent(s).  This lets the campaign know what messages work best with certain demographics and what messages should be avoided.   Campaigns often use these polls to test possible attack messages that their opponent may use and potential responses to those attacks.  The campaign can then spend some time preparing an effective response to any likely attacks.  Thirdly, this kind of poll can be used by candidates or political parties to convince primary challengers to drop out of a race and support a stronger candidate.

=== Tracking polls ===
A ''tracking poll'' or ''rolling poll'' is a poll in which responses are obtained in a number of consecutive periods, for instance daily, and then results are calculated using a [[moving average]] of the responses that were gathered over a fixed number of the most recent periods, for example the past five days.&lt;ref name="CNNtrackingpoll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/polls/cnn.usa.gallup/tracking/FAQ.html |title=About the Tracking Polls |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, the next calculated results will use data for five days counting backwards from the next day, namely the same data as before, but with the data from the next day included, and without the data from the sixth day before that day.

== Potential for inaccuracy ==

Over time, a number of theories and mechanisms have been offered to explain erroneous polling results.  Some of these reflect errors on the part of the pollsters; many of them are statistical in nature.  Others blame the respondents for not giving candid answers (''e.g.'', the [[Bradley effect]], the [[Shy Tory Factor]]); these can be more controversial.

=== Margin of error due to sampling ===
Polls based on samples of populations are subject to [[sampling error]] which reflects the effects of chance and uncertainty in the sampling process. Sampling polls rely on the [[law of large numbers]] to measure the opinions of the whole population based only on a subset, and for this purpose the absolute size of the sample is important, but the percentage of the whole population is not important (unless it happens to be close to the sample size).  The possible difference between the sample and whole population is often expressed as a [[margin of error]] - usually defined as the radius of a 95% confidence interval for a particular statistic. One example is the percent of people who prefer product A versus product B. When a single, global margin of error is reported for a survey, it refers to the maximum margin of error for all reported percentages using the full sample from the survey. If the statistic is a percentage, this maximum margin of error can be calculated as the radius of the confidence interval for a reported percentage of 50%. Others suggest that a poll with a random sample of 1,000 people has margin of sampling error of ±3% for the estimated percentage of the whole population.

A 3% margin of error means that if the same procedure is used a large number of times, 95% of the time the true population average will be within the sample estimate plus or minus 3%. The margin of error can be reduced by using a larger sample, however if a pollster wishes to reduce the margin of error to 1% they would need a sample of around 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;An estimate of the margin of error in percentage terms can be gained by the formula 100 ÷ square root of sample size&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, pollsters need to balance the cost of a large sample against the reduction in sampling error and a sample size of around 500–1,000 is a typical compromise for political polls. (Note that to get complete responses it may be necessary to include thousands of additional participators.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpp.org/?q=node/4 20 Questions Journalists Should Ask About Poll Results], National Council on Public Polls Retrieved 2016-06-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/Election-Polling-Resources/Margin-of-Sampling-Error-Credibility-Interval.aspx Margin of Sampling Error and Credibility Interval], American Association for Public Opinion Research, Retrieved 2016-06-05&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way to reduce the margin of error is to rely on [[poll average]]s.  This makes the assumption that the procedure is similar enough between many different polls and uses the sample size of each poll to create a polling average.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Scott M. ''Introduction to Bayesian Statistics and Estimation for Social Scientists'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a polling average can be found  here: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080926154657/http://www.daytodaypolitics.com/polls/presidential_election_Obama_vs_McCain_2008.htm 2008 Presidential Election polling average].  Another source of error stems from faulty demographic models by pollsters who weigh their samples by particular variables such as party identification in an election.  For example, if you assume that the breakdown of the US population by party identification has not changed since the previous presidential election, you may underestimate a victory or a defeat of a particular party candidate that saw a surge or decline in its party registration relative to the previous presidential election cycle.

A caution is that an estimate of a trend is subject to a larger error than an estimate of a level. This is because if one estimates the change, the difference between two numbers ''X'' and ''Y,'' then one has to contend with errors in both ''X'' and ''Y''. A rough guide is that if the change in measurement falls outside the margin of error it is worth attention.

=== Nonresponse bias ===
Since some people do not answer calls from strangers, or refuse to the answer the poll, poll samples may not be representative samples from a population due to a [[non-response bias]]. Response rates have been declining, and are down to about 10% in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/05/survey_bias_how_can_we_trust_opinion_polls_when_so_few_people_respond_.single.html| title=Minority Opinions:Hardly anyone responds to public opinion surveys anymore. Can we still trust them?|author=Will Oremus| date=2012-05-17| accessdate=2013-11-21| publisher=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this [[selection bias]], the characteristics of those who agree to be interviewed may be markedly different from those who decline. That is, the actual sample is a biased version of the universe the pollster wants to analyze. In these cases, bias introduces new errors, one way or the other, that are in addition to errors caused by sample size. Error due to bias does not become smaller with larger sample sizes, because taking a larger sample size simply repeats the same mistake on a larger scale. If the people who refuse to answer, or are never reached, have the same characteristics as the people who do answer, then the final results should be unbiased. If the people who do not answer have different opinions then there is bias in the results. In terms of election polls, studies suggest that bias effects are small, but each polling firm has its own techniques for adjusting weights to minimize selection bias.&lt;ref name="Langer2003"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ABC News|author=Langer, Gary|title=About Response Rates: Some Unresolved Questions|url=http://abcnews.go.com/images/pdf/responserates.pdf|date=May 2003|accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aapor.org/Education-Resources/For-Researchers/Poll-Survey-FAQ/Response-Rates-An-Overview.aspx Response Rates: An Overview] American Association for Public Opinion Research, Retrieved 2016-06-05&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Response bias ===
Survey results may be affected by [[response bias]], where the answers given by respondents do not reflect their true beliefs. This may be deliberately engineered by unscrupulous pollsters in order to generate a certain result or please their clients, but more often is a result of the detailed wording or ordering of questions (see below). Respondents may deliberately try to manipulate the outcome of a poll by e.g. advocating a more extreme position than they actually hold in order to boost their side of the argument or give rapid and ill-considered answers in order to hasten the end of their questioning. Respondents may also feel under social pressure not to give an unpopular answer. For example, respondents might be unwilling to admit to unpopular attitudes like [[racism]] or [[sexism]], and thus polls might not reflect the true incidence of these attitudes in the population. In American political parlance, this phenomenon is often referred to as the [[Bradley effect]]. If the results of surveys are widely publicized this effect may be magnified - a phenomenon commonly referred to as the [[spiral of silence]].

Use of the [[plurality voting system]]  (select only one candidate) in a poll puts an unintentional bias into the poll, since people who favor more than one candidate cannot indicate this. The fact that they must choose only one candidate biases the poll, causing it to favor the candidate most different from the others while it disfavors candidates who are similar to other candidates. The [[plurality voting system]] also biases elections in the same way.

Some people responding may not understand the words being used, but may wish to avoid the embarrassment of admitting this, or the poll mechanism may not allow clarification, so they may make an arbitrary choice.  Some percentage of people also answer whimsically or out of annoyance at being polled.  This results in perhaps 4% of Americans reporting they have personally been decapitated&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=487654380 Planet Money Episode 714: Can A Game Show Lose?]&lt;/ref&gt; or that "lizardmen are running the Earth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/04/12/noisy-poll-results-and-reptilian-muslim-climatologists-from-mars/ Noisy Poll Results and Reptilian Muslim Climatologists from Mars]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wording of questions ===
It is well established that the wording of the questions, the order in which they are asked and the number and form of alternative answers offered can influence results of polls. For instance, the public is more likely to indicate support for a person who is described by the operator as one of the "leading candidates". This support itself overrides subtle bias for one candidate, as does lumping some candidates in an "other" category or vice versa. Thus comparisons between polls often boil down to the wording of the question. On some issues, question wording can result in quite pronounced differences between surveys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people-press.org/2013/07/26/government-surveillance-a-question-wording-experiment/  Government Surveillance: A Question Wording Experiment], Pew Research Center Published 2013-07-26 Retrieved 2016-06-05&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/publications/whats-in-a-name-global-warming-vs-climate-change/ What’s In A Name? Global Warming vs Climate Change], Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, Published 2014-05-27, Retrieved 2016-06-05&lt;/ref&gt; This can also, however, be a result of legitimately conflicted feelings or evolving attitudes, rather than a poorly constructed survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicagenda.org/pages/seven-stages-public-opinion |title=The Seven Stages of Public Opinion Public Agenda |publisher=Publicagenda.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common technique to control for this bias is to rotate the order in which questions are asked. Many pollsters also split-sample. This involves having two different versions of a question, with each version presented to half the respondents.

The most effective controls, used by [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]] researchers, are:

* asking enough questions to allow all aspects of an issue to be covered and to control effects due to the form of the question (such as positive or negative wording), the adequacy of the number being established quantitatively with [[psychometrics|psychometric]] measures such as reliability coefficients, and
* analyzing the results with psychometric techniques which synthesize the answers into a few reliable scores and detect ineffective questions.

These controls are not widely used in the polling industry.{{Why?|date=July 2010}}. However, as it is important that questions to test the product have a high quality, survey methodologists work on methods to test them. Empirical tests provide insight into the quality of the questionnaire, some may be more complex than others. For instance, testing a questionnaire can be done by:
* conducting [[cognitive pretesting|cognitive interviewing]]. By asking a sample of potential-respondents about their interpretation of the questions and use of the questionnaire, a researcher can 
* carrying out a small pretest of the questionnaire, using a small subset of target respondents. Results can inform a researcher of errors such as missing questions, or logical and procedural errors.
* estimating the measurement quality of the questions. This can be done for instance using test-retest,&lt;ref&gt;Lord, F. and Novick, M. R.(1968). Statistical theories of mental test scores.

=== Involuntary facades and false correlations ===
One of the criticisms of opinion polls is that societal assumptions that opinions between which there is no logical link are "correlated attitudes" can push people with one opinion into a group that forces them to pretend to have a supposedly linked but actually unrelated opinion. That, in turn, may cause people who have the first opinion to claim on polls that they have the second opinion without having it, causing opinion polls to become part of [[self-fulfilling prophecy]] problems. It have been suggested that attempts to counteract unethical opinions by condemning supposedly linked opinions may favor the groups that promote the actually unethical opinions by forcing people with supposedly linked opinions into them by ostracism elsewhere in society making such efforts counterproductive, that not being sent between groups that assume ulterior motives from each other and not being allowed to express consistent critical thought anywhere may create psychological stress because humans are sapient, and that discussion spaces free from assumptions of ulterior motives behind specific opinions should be created. In this context, rejection of the assumption that opinion polls show actual links between opinions is considered important.&lt;ref&gt;"Political Polling in the Digital Age: The Challenge of Measuring and Understanding Public Opinion" by Robert K. Goidel, yr twenty-eleven&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Understanding Public Opinion Polls" by Jelke Bethlehem, yr twenty-seventeen&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coverage bias ===
Another source of error is the use of samples that are not representative of the population as a consequence of the methodology used, as was the experience of ''The Literary Digest'' in 1936. For example, telephone sampling has a built-in error because in many times and places, those with telephones have generally been richer than those without.

In some places many people have only [[mobile telephone]]s. Because pollsters cannot use automated dialing machines to call mobile phones in the United States (because the phone's owner may be charged for taking a call&lt;ref&gt;http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/TCPA-Rules.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), these individuals are typically excluded from polling samples. There is concern that, if the subset of the population without cell phones differs markedly from the rest of the population, these differences can skew the results of the poll.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pewresearch.org/2010/11/22/the-growing-gap-between-landline-and-dual-frame-election-polls/ The Growing Gap between Landline and Dual Frame Election Polls: Republican Vote Share Bigger in Landline-Only Surveys] Pew Research Center, 2010-11-22; Retrieved 2016-06-05&lt;/ref&gt;

Polling organizations have developed many weighting techniques to help overcome these deficiencies, with varying degrees of success. Studies of mobile phone users by the Pew Research Center in the US, in 2007, concluded that "cell-only respondents are different from landline respondents in important ways, (but) they were neither numerous enough nor different enough on the questions we examined to produce a significant change in overall general population survey estimates when included with the landline samples and weighted according to US Census parameters on basic demographic characteristics."&lt;ref name="Keeter2007"&gt;{{cite web|author=Keeter, Scott|publisher=Pew Research Center Publications|title=How Serious Is Polling's Cell-Only Problem?|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/515/polling-cell-only-problem|date=2007-06-27|access-date=2008-11-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030215501/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/515/polling-cell-only-problem|archive-date=2008-10-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!---since Pew is in the business of polling, their quote is pretty much self-serving.

In 2003, only 2.9% of households were wireless (cellphones only), compared to 12.8% in 2006.&lt;ref name="Blumberg2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blumberg SJ, Luke JV|title=Wireless Substitution:  Early Release of Estimates Based on Data from the National Health Interview Survey, July–December 2006|date=2007-05-14|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|format=PDF|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhis/earlyrelease/wireless200705.pdf|accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This results in "[[coverage error]]".

The potential sources of bias are:&lt;ref name="Silver2008"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=FiveThirtyEight.com|author=Silver, Nate|title=The Cellphone Problem, Revisited|url=http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/07/cellphone-problem-revisited.html|date=2008-07-22|accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some households use cellphones only and have no landline.  This tends to include minorities and younger voters; and occurs more frequently in metropolitan areas.  Men are more likely to be cellphone-only compared to women.
# Some people may not be contactable by landline from Monday to Friday and may be contactable only by cellphone.
# Some people use their landlines only to access the Internet, and answer calls only to their cellphones.

Some polling companies have attempted to get around that problem by including a "cellphone supplement".  There are a number of problems with including cellphones in a telephone poll:
# It is difficult to get co-operation from cellphone users, because in many parts of the US, users are charged for both outgoing and incoming calls. That means that pollsters have had to offer financial compensation to gain co-operation.
# US federal law prohibits the use of automated dialling devices to call cellphones ([[Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991]]). Numbers therefore have to be dialled by hand, which is more time-consuming and expensive for pollsters.

=== 1992 UK general election ===
An oft-quoted example of opinion polls succumbing to errors occurred during the [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992 UK general election]]. Despite the polling organizations using different methodologies, virtually all the polls taken before the vote, and to a lesser extent, [[exit poll]]s taken on voting day, showed a lead for the opposition Labour party, but the actual vote gave a clear victory to the ruling Conservative party.

In their deliberations after this embarrassment the pollsters advanced several ideas to account for their errors, including:

; Late [[swing (politics)|swing]] : Voters who changed their minds shortly before voting tended to favour the Conservatives, so the error was not as great as it first appeared.
; Nonresponse bias : Conservative voters were less likely to participate in surveys than in the past and were thus under-represented.
; The [[Shy Tory Factor]] : The Conservatives had suffered a sustained period of unpopularity as a result of economic difficulties and a series of minor scandals, leading to a [[spiral of silence]] in which some Conservative supporters were reluctant to disclose their sincere intentions to pollsters.

The relative importance of these factors was, and remains, a matter of controversy, but since then the polling organizations have adjusted their methodologies and have achieved more accurate results in subsequent election campaigns.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

A comprehensive discussion of these biases and how they should be understood and mitigated is included in several sources including Dillman and Salant (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Salant, Priscilla, I. Dillman, and A. Don. How to conduct your own survey. No. 300.723 S3.. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Failures ==
A widely publicized failure of opinion polling to date in the [[United States]] was the prediction that [[Thomas Dewey]] would defeat [[Harry S. Truman]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1948|1948 US presidential election]]. Major polling organizations, including Gallup and Roper, indicated a landslide victory for Dewey.

It was widely predicted that [[Donald Trump]] would lose the [[U.S. presidential election, 2016|2016 US presidential election]] to Former US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]; however, Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States and was inaugurated on January 20, 2017. Many publications, such as FiveThirtyEight,&lt;ref&gt;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/final-election-update-theres-a-wide-range-of-outcomes-and-most-of-them-come-up-clinton/&lt;/ref&gt; predicted that there was a significant chance of Trump winning.

In the United Kingdom, most polls failed to predict the Conservative election victories of [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1992|1992]], and Labour's victory in [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|1974]]. However, their figures at other elections have been generally accurate. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 election]] virtually every poll predicted a hung parliament with Labour and the Conservatives neck and neck when the actual result was a clear Conservative majority. On the other hand, in [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017]], the opposite appears to have occurred. Most polls predicted a Conservative landslide, even though in reality the election resulted in a hung parliament with the Conservatives losing their majority.

== Social media as a source of opinion on candidates ==
Social media today is a popular medium for the candidates to campaign and for gauging the public reaction to the campaigns. Social media can also be used as an indicator of the voter opinion regarding the poll. Some research studies have shown that predictions made using social media signals can match traditional opinion polls.&lt;ref name="lampos2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oconnor2010"/&gt;

Recently, concerning the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a major concern has been that of the effect of false stories spreading throughout social media. Recent evidence shows that social media plays a huge role in the supplying of news: 62 percent of US adults get news on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/|title=News Use Across Social Media Platforms 2016|date=2016-05-26|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; This fact makes the issue of fake news being spread throughout it more influential. Other evidence surrounding fake news shows that: the most popular fake news stories were more widely shared on Facebook than the most popular mainstream news stories; many people who see fake news stories report that they believe them; and the most discussed fake news stories tended to favor Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton. As a result of these facts, some have concluded that if not for these stories, Donald Trump may not have won the election over Hillary Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allcott|first=Hunt|last2=Gentzkow|first2=Matthew|date=Spring 2017|title=Social Media and Fake News in the 2016 Election|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~gentzkow/research/fakenews.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=31|pages=211–236|via=Stanford|doi=10.1257/jep.31.2.211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence ==
=== Effect on voters ===
By providing information about voting intentions, opinion polls can sometimes influence the behavior of electors, and in his book ''[[The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way|The Broken Compass]]'', [[Peter Hitchens]] asserts that opinion polls are actually a device for influencing public opinion.&lt;ref name="Hitchens2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hitchens|first=Peter|title=The Broken Compass: How British Politics Lost its Way |chapter=Chapter 1, Guy Fawkes Gets a Blackberry|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd|year=2009|isbn=1-84706-405-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The various theories about how this happens can be split into two groups: bandwagon/underdog effects, and strategic ("tactical") voting.

A [[bandwagon effect]] occurs when the poll prompts voters to back the candidate shown to be winning in the poll. The idea that voters are susceptible to such effects is old, stemming at least from 1884; [[William Safire]] reported that the term was first used in a political cartoon in the magazine ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]'' in that year.&lt;ref&gt;Safire, William, ''Safire's Political Dictionary'', page 42. Random House, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also remained persistent in spite of a lack of empirical corroboration until the late 20th century. [[George Gallup]] spent much effort in vain trying to discredit this theory in his time by presenting empirical research. A recent meta-study of scientific research on this topic indicates that from the 1980s onward the Bandwagon effect is found more often by researchers.&lt;ref name="irwin"&gt;Irwin, Galen A. and Joop J. M. Van Holsteyn. ''Bandwagons, Underdogs, the Titanic and the Red Cross: The Influence of Public Opinion Polls on Voters'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of the bandwagon effect is the [[Underdog (competition)|underdog]] effect. It is often mentioned in the media. This occurs when people vote, out of sympathy, for the party perceived to be "losing" the elections. There is less empirical evidence for the existence of this effect than there is for the existence of the bandwagon effect.&lt;ref name="irwin"/&gt;

The second category of theories on how polls directly affect voting is called strategic or [[tactical voting]]. This theory is based on the idea that voters view the act of voting as a means of selecting a government. Thus they will sometimes not choose the candidate they prefer on ground of ideology or sympathy, but another, less-preferred, candidate from strategic considerations. An example can be found in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997]]. As he was then a Cabinet Minister, [[Michael Portillo]]'s constituency of [[Enfield Southgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Enfield Southgate]] was believed to be a [[safe seat]] but opinion polls showed the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate [[Stephen Twigg]] steadily gaining support, which may have prompted undecided voters or supporters of other parties to support Twigg in order to remove Portillo. Another example is the boomerang effect where the likely supporters of the candidate shown to be winning feel that chances are slim and that their vote is not required, thus allowing another candidate to win.

In addition, Mark Pickup in Cameron Anderson and Laura Stephenson's "Voting Behaviour in Canada" outlines three additional "behavioural" responses that voters may exhibit when faced with polling data.

The first is known as a "cue taking" effect which holds that poll data is used as a "proxy" for information about the candidates or parties. Cue taking is "based on the psychological phenomenon of using heuristics to simplify a complex decision" (243).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson |first1=Cameron |title=Voting Behaviour in Canada|year=2010|publisher=UBC Press|location=Vancouver|pages=243–278 |author2=Pickup, Mark |authorlink=Election Campaign Polls and Democracy in Canada: Examining the Evidence Behind Common Claims|chapter=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, first described by Petty and Cacioppo (1996) is known as "cognitive response" theory. This theory asserts that a voter's response to a poll may not line with their initial conception of the electoral reality. In response, the voter is likely to generate a "mental list" in which they create reasons for a party's loss or gain in the polls. This can reinforce or change their opinion of the candidate and thus affect voting behaviour.

Third, the final possibility is a "behavioural response" which is similar to a cognitive response. The only salient difference is that a voter will go and seek new information to form their "mental list", thus becoming more informed of the election. This may then affect voting behaviour.

These effects indicate how opinion polls can directly affect political choices of the electorate. But directly or indirectly, other effects can be surveyed and analyzed on all political parties. The form of [[Framing (social sciences)|media framing]] and party ideology shifts must also be taken under consideration. Opinion polling in some instances is a measure of cognitive bias, which is variably considered and handled appropriately in its various applications.

=== Effect on politicians ===
{{expand section|date=March 2011}}
Starting in the 1980s, tracking polls and related technologies began having a notable impact on U.S. political leaders.&lt;ref name="washpost201103"&gt;{{cite web| title= David S. Broder: The best political reporter of his time | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/09/AR2011030902885.html | publisher=The Washington Post | date= March 9, 2011 | first=Robert G. |last= Kaiser| accessdate=2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Douglas Bailey, a Republican who had helped run [[Gerald Ford]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 presidential campaign]], "It's no longer necessary for a political candidate to guess what an audience thinks. He can [find out] with a nightly tracking poll. So it's no longer likely that political leaders are going to lead. Instead, they're going to follow."&lt;ref name="washpost201103"/&gt;

== Regulation ==
Some jurisdictions over the world restrict the publication of the results of opinion polls, especially during the period around an election, in order to prevent the possibly erroneous results from affecting voters' decisions. For instance, in Canada, it is prohibited to publish the results of opinion surveys that would identify specific political parties or candidates in the final three days before a poll closes.&lt;ref name="Emery1994"&gt;{{citation|author=Claude Emery|title=Public opinion polling in Canada|date=January 1994|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/content/lop/researchpublications/bp371-e.htm|publisher=Library of Parliament, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most [[western democratic nations]] don't support the entire prohibition of the publication of pre-election opinion polls; most of them have no regulation and some only prohibit it in the final days or hours until the relevant poll closes.&lt;ref name="Tim2002"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tim Bale|title=Restricting the broadcast and publication of pre-election and exit polls: some selected examples|year=2002|doi=10.1080/00344890208523210|journal=Representation|pages=15–22|volume=39|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by Canada's Royal Commission on Electoral Reform reported that the prohibition period of publication of the survey results largely differed in different countries. Out of the 20 countries examined, 3 prohibit the publication during the entire period of campaigns, while others prohibit it for a shorter term such as the polling period or the final 48 hours before a poll closes.&lt;ref name="Emery1994"/&gt; In India, the Election Commission has prohibited it in the 48 hours before the start of polling.

'''Pilu oil''' is an extract from seeds of the pilu tree, the meswak tree, and the [[salvadora persica|mustard tree]].

The pilu tree belongs to the ''[[Salvadoraceae]]'' family. The botanic systematic name of the tree is ''[[Salvadora persica]]''. Chewing sticks of the pilu tree were used by the Babylonians approximately 7000 years ago; they were later used throughout the Greek and Roman empires, and by ancient Egyptians and Muslims. These chewing sticks are most commonly used in the Middle East and South America, though are also used in parts of Africa and Asia. Chewing sticks are used for oral hygiene, religious and social purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miswakstick.com/files/Miswak-Scientific-Benifits.pdf|title=Miswak (chewing Stick): A Cultural And Scientific Heritage\publisher=miswakstick.com/|date=|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilu tree is a salt-tolerant shrub or small tree, living in arid zones. It is native to India, Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref name="WAG" /&gt;

==Common names==

In English, the Pilu tree is commonly known as the Toothbrush Tree, Patana Oak, Slow Match Tree, Tummy Wood, and Wild Guava.

In Indian languages, common names include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/dinesh_valke/3440360593/|title=Pilu (Hindi: पीलू)|publisher=flickr.com|date=|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The generic name was given in 1749 in honor of an apothecary of Barcelona, Jaime Salvador y Pedrol (1649-1740), by Dr Laurent Garcin, botanist, traveler and plant collector. The true specimen of this species came, as the specific name indicates, from Persia.&lt;ref name="WAG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb2/AFTPDFS/Salvadora_persica.pdf|title=Salvadora persica|publisher=worldagroforestry.org/|date=|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
The Pilu tree is widely distributed in the drier parts of [[India]], Baluchistan, and [[Ceylon]] and in the dry regions of [[West Asia]] and [[Egypt]]. In India, the tree is found abundantly in the states of [[Gujarat]], [[Haryana]], [[Punjab]] and [[Rajasthan]]. It can be also found in Raigad district of Maharashtra in abundance in marshy areas. In India it grows wild in arid or sandy areas of Punjab and north India and thrives in saline soils, but with a stunted growth.

==Tree==
''Salvadora persica'' is a large, well-branched [[evergreen]] [[shrub]] or small tree having soft whitish yellow [[wood]]. The bark is of old stems rugose, branches are numerous, drooping, glabrous, terete, finely striate, shining, and almost white. [[Leaves]] are somewhat fleshy, glaucous, 3.8–6.3 by 2–3.2&amp;nbsp;cm in size, elliptic lanceolate or ovate, obtuse, and often mucronate at the apex, the base is usually acute, less commonly rounded, the main nerves are in 5–6 pairs, and the petioles 1.3–2.2&amp;nbsp;cm long and glabrous. The [[flowers]] are greenish yellow in color, in axillary and terminal compound lax panicles 5–12.5&amp;nbsp;cm long, numerous in the upper axils, pedicels 1.5–3&amp;nbsp;mm long, bracts beneath the pedicels, ovate and very caduceus. The calyx is 1.25&amp;nbsp;mm long, glabrous, cleft halfway down, lobes rounded. The corolla is very thin, 3&amp;nbsp;mm long, deeply cleft, persistent, lobes are 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm long, oblong, obtuse, and much reflexed. The stamens are shorter than corolla, but exerted, owing to the corolla lobes being reflexed. The [[drupe]] is 3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter, globose, smooth and becomes red when ripe&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite journal|title=Salvadora persica| pmc=3249923 | pmid=22228963 | doi=10.4103/0973-7847.70920| volume=4| year=2010| journal=Pharmacogn Rev| pages=209–14 | last1 = Khatak | first1 = M | last2 = Khatak | first2 = S | last3 = Siddqui | first3 = AA | last4 = Vasudeva | first4 = N | last5 = Aggarwal | first5 = A | last6 = Aggarwal | first6 = P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fruits and seeds==
The fruits appear in May in Western areas and in June in central parts. Fruits are pale green to red brown when ripe. It is a globose drupe. The fruits are sweet and edible. The yield of fresh fruit per tree will be 10–15&amp;nbsp;kg. The yield of dried fruits will be 2–3&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;SEA,HandBook by The Solvent Extractors' Association if India&lt;/ref&gt; The percentage of the oil in seeds is 32-34%. The seed contains a brittle shell on the outer surface, and the kernel accounts for 60% in dried seed, containing 40-43% oil.

==Oil==
‘Sweet Variety’ of Pilu yields 35-44% oil which has a strong odour. The [[odor|odour]] is due the presence of Benzyl isothiocyanate in the oil. There is greenish yellow fat called '''Khakan fat.''' The purified fat is free from foul odour and has an agreeable [[taste]]. It is snow [[white]]. The oil is rich in [[lauric acid|lauric]] and [[myristic acids]]. The fat is used in soap, making up to 20% of the soap itself, and it replaces coconut oil. It is used as a resist in the dyeing industry. The oil is also used in rheumatic infection treatment.&lt;ref name="pilu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crirec.com/2011/01/pilu-khakan/|title=Pilu / Khakan|publisher=crirec.com|date=|accessdate=2013-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a high melting point and a disagreeable odour that disappears on purification. The most important aspect of the oil is the presence of a low percentage of C8 and C10 fatty acids that are of great economic significance. The oil is an alternative source of oil for soap and detergent industries.

'''Prodrazvyorstka'''&lt;ref&gt;Also [[transliteration of Russian|transliterated]] '''Prodrazverstka'''&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-rus|продразвёрстка|p=prədrɐˈzvʲɵrstkə}}, short for {{lang|ru|[[wikt:продовольственный#Russian|'''прод'''овольственная]] [[wikt:развёрстка#Russian|'''развёрстка''']]}}, {{literally}} ''food apportionment'') was a [[Bolshevik]] policy and campaign of [[confiscation]] of grain and other [[agricultural]] products from the peasants at nominal fixed prices according to specified quotas (the noun ''razvyorstka,'' {{Lang-ru|развёрстка}}, and the verb ''razverstat' ''refer to the partition of the requested total amount as obligations from the suppliers).

The term is commonly associated with [[war communism]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] when it was introduced by the [[Bolshevik]] government. However Bolsheviks borrowed the idea from the grain ''razvyorstka'' introduced in the [[Russian Empire]] during [[World War I]], in 1916.

==World War I grain razvyorstka==
1916 saw a food crisis in the Russian Empire. While the harvest was good in [[Lower Volga Region]] and Western [[Siberia]], its transportation by railroads collapsed. In addition, the food market was in disarray. Fixed prices for government purchases were unattractive. A decree of November 29, 1916 signed by [[Aleksandr Rittich]] of the Ministry of Agriculture) introduced razvyorstka as the collection of grain for defense purposes.  The [[Russian Provisional Government]] established after the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 could not propose any incentives for peasants, and their [[state monopoly]] on grain sales failed to achieve its goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first1 = Nikolai | last1 = Dronin | first2 = Edward | last2 = Bellinger | year = 2005 | title = Climate Dependence and Food Problems in Russia, 1900–1990: The Interaction of Climate and Agricultural Policy and Their Effect on Food Problems | ISBN = 963-7326-10-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9a5j_JL6cqIC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=Prodrazverstka+1916&amp;source=web&amp;ots=IkY1Lgq_YL&amp;sig=uBNv8bzSu_VwiHzeULgUDD8mqhA&amp;hl=en | pages = 65, 66}}.

==Soviet prodrazvyorstka==
In 1918 the center of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]] found itself cut off from the most important agricultural regions of the country. The reserves of grain ran low, causing hunger among the urban population, where support for the Bolshevik government was strongest.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} In order to satisfy minimal food needs, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government introduced strict control over the food surpluses of the prosperous rural households. Since many peasants were extremely unhappy with this policy and tried to resist it, they were branded as "[[saboteur]]s" of the bread [[monopoly]] of the state and advocates of free "predatory", "speculative" trade.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} [[Vladimir Lenin]] believed that prodrazvyorstka was the only possible way to procure sufficient amounts of grain and other agricultural products for the population of the cities during the civil war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Lenin | first = VI | title = Collected Works | volume = 32 | year = 1965 | place = Moscow | publisher = Progress Publishers | page = 187}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before prodrazvyorstka, Lenin's May 9, 1918 decree ("О продовольственной диктатуре") introduced the concept of "produce dictatorship". This and other subsequent decrees ordered the forced collection of foodstuffs, without any limitations, and used the [[Red Army]] to accomplish this.

A [[Soviet Decrees| decree]] of the [[Sovnarkom]] introduced prodrazvyorstka throughout Soviet Russia on January 11, 1919. Prodrazvyorstka also extended to [[Ukraine]] and [[Belarus]] (1919), [[Turkestan]] and [[Siberia]] (1920). In accordance with the decree of the [[People's Commissar]]iat for Provisions on the procedures of prodrazvyorstka (January 13, 1919), the amount of different kinds of products designated for collection by the state (some historians {{weasel-inline|date=July 2012}} call it an outright [[confiscation]]) was calculated on the basis of the data on each [[Governorate|guberniya]]'s areas under crops, crop capacity and the reserves of past years. Within each guberniya, the collection plan was broken down between [[Guberniya|uyezd]]s, [[Guberniya|volost]]s, villages, and then separate peasant households.  The collection procedures were performed by the agencies of the People's Commissariat for Provisions and [[prodotryad]]s (продовольственный отряд, food brigades) with the help of [[kombed]]s (комитет бедноты, [[committee of the poor|committees of the poor]]) and of local [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]]s.

Initially, prodrazvyorstka covered the collection of grain and [[fodder]]. During the procurement campaign of 1919–20, prodrazvyorstka also included [[potato]]es and [[meat]]. By the end of 1920, it included almost every kind of agricultural product. According to  Soviet [[statistics]], the authorities collected 107.9 million [[pood]]s (1.77 million [[metric ton]]s) of grain and fodder in 1918&amp;ndash;19, 212.5 million poods (3.48 million metric tons) in 1919&amp;ndash;20, and 367 million pounds (6.01 million metric tons) in 1920&amp;ndash;21.

Prodrazvyorstka allowed the Soviet government to solve the important problem of supplying the [[Red Army]] and urban population and of providing [[raw material]] for different industries. Prodrazvyorstka left its mark on commodity-money relations, since the authorities had prohibited selling of bread and [[cereal|grain]]. It also influenced many, if not all, aspects of relations between the city and the village and became one of the most important elements of the system of [[war communism]].

As the Russian Civil War approached its end, prodrazvyorstka lost its actuality, but it had done much damage to the agricultural sector and caused growing discontent among peasants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} As the government switched to the [[New Economic Policy|NEP]] (New Economic Policy), a decree of the [[10th Congress of the RCP(b)|10th Congress]] of the [[CPSU|Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] in March 1921 replaced prodrazvyorstka with [[prodnalog]] (food tax).

The '''right to food''', and its non variations, is a [[human right]] protecting the right for people to feed themselves in [[dignity]], implying that sufficient food is available, that people have the means to access it, and that it adequately meets the individual's [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] needs. The right to food protects the right of all human beings to be free from [[hunger]], [[food insecurity]] and [[malnutrition]].&lt;ref name="Ziegler 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2012}}: “What is the right to food?”&lt;/ref&gt; The right to food does not imply that governments have an obligation to hand out free food to everyone who wants it, or a right to be fed. However, if people are deprived of access to food for reasons beyond their control, for example, because they are in detention, in times of war or after natural disasters, the right requires the government to provide food directly.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2012a}}: "Right to Food."&lt;/ref&gt;

The right is derived from the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; which has 160 state parties as of May 2012.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; States that sign the covenant agree to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve progressively the full realization of the right to adequate food, both nationally and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}: article 2(1), 11(1) and 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ziegler 2012"/&gt; In a total of 106 countries the right to food is applicable either via constitutional arrangements of various forms or via direct applicability in law of various international treaties in which the right to food is protected.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Knuth|2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 1996 [[World Food Summit]], governments reaffirmed the right to food and committed themselves to half the number of hungry and malnourished from 840 to 420 million by 2015. However, the number has increased over the past years, reaching an infamous record in 2009 of more than 1 billion undernourished people worldwide.&lt;ref name="Ziegler 2012"/&gt; Furthermore, the number who suffer from hidden hunger – micronutrient deficiences that may cause stunted bodily and intellectual growth in children – amounts to over 2 billion people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahluwalia|2004}}: 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst under international law states are obliged to respect, protect and fulfill the right to food, the practical difficulties in achieving this human right are demonstrated by prevalent food insecurity across the world, and ongoing litigation in countries such as India.&lt;ref&gt;Westcott, Catherine and Nadia Khoury and CMS Cameron McKenna,''The Right to Food'', (Advocates for International Development, October 2011)http://a4id.org/sites/default/files/user/Right%20to%20Food%20Legal%20Guide.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.orfonline.org/expert-speaks/aadhaar-right-to-food/ | title=Aadhaar vs. Right to food}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the continents with the biggest food-related problems – [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Latin America]] – not only is there shortage of food and lack of infrastructure but also maldistribution and inadequate access to food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahluwalia|2004}}: iii.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] recognizes the "[[right to an adequate standard of living]], including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free from hunger". The relationship between the two concepts is not straightforward. For example, "freedom from hunger" (which General Comment 12 designates as more pressing and immediate&lt;ref name="Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1999"&gt;{{harvnb|Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) could be measured by the number of people suffering from [[malnutrition]] and at the extreme, dying of [[starvation]]. The "right to adequate food" is a much higher standard, including not only absence of [[malnutrition]], but to the full range of qualities associated with [[food]], including safety, variety and dignity, in short all those elements needed to enable an active and healthy life.

Inspired by the above definition, the [[Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food]] in 2002 defined it as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The right to have regular, permanent and unrestricted access, either directly or by means of financial purchases, to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food corresponding to the cultural traditions of the people to which the consumer belongs, and which ensure a physical and mental, individual and collective, fulfilling and dignified life free of fear.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2008}}: para. 17; quoted in {{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2012a}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This definition entails all normative elements explained in detail in the General Comment 12 of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]], which states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;the right to adequate food is realized when every man, woman and child, alone or in community with others, have the physical and economic access at all times to adequate food or means for its procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1999}}: para. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|General Comments are not legally binding but are authoritative interpretation of the ICESCR, which is legally binding upon the States Parties to this treaty.|group=note}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===What the right to food is not===
According to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]], the right to food does not imply that governments have an obligation to hand out free food to everyone who wants it. This is a common misconception.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The right to food is not a right to a minimum ration of calories, proteins and other specific nutrients, or a right to be fed. It is about being guaranteed the right to feed oneself, which requires not only that food is available – that the ratio of production to the population is sufficient – but also that it is accessible – i.e., that each household either has the means to produce or buy its own food. However, if individuals are deprived of access to food for reasons beyond their control, for instance because of an armed conflict, natural disaster or because they are in detention, recognition of the right to life obliges States to provide them with sufficient food for their survival.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012c}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Dimensions ===
The former Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, [[Jean Ziegler]], defined three dimensions to the right to food.&lt;ref name="Ziegler 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1999"/&gt;

*[[Availability]] refers to the possibilities either for feeding oneself directly from productive land or other natural resources, or for well functioning distribution, processing and market systems that can move food from the site of production to where it is needed in accordance with demand.
*[[Accessibility]] implies that economic and physical access to food is to be guaranteed. On the one hand, economic access means that food should be affordable for an adequate diet without compromising other basic needs. On the other hand, physically vulnerable, such as sick, children, disabled or elderly should also have access to food.
*Adequacy implies that the food must satisfy the [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] needs of every individual, taking into account age, living conditions, health, occupation, sex, culture and religion, for example. The food must be safe and adequate protective measures by both public and private means must be taken to prevent contamination of foodstuffs through adulteration and/or through bad environmental hygiene or inappropriate handling at different stages throughout the food chain; care must also be taken to identify and avoid or destroy naturally occurring toxins.

Furthermore, any discrimination in access to food, as well as to means and entitlements for its procurement, on the grounds of race, colour, sex, language, age, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status constitutes a violation of the right to food.

=== Agreed-upon food standards ===
Regarding the right to food, the international community also specified commonly agreed on standards, such as in the 1974 [[World Food Conference]], the 1974 International Undertaking on World Food Security, the 1977 [[Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners]], the 1986 [[Right to development|Declaration on the Right to Development]], the [[ECOSOC]] Resolution 1987/90, the 1992 [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]], and the 1996 [[Habitat II|Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahluwalia|2004}}: footnote 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Negative or positive right ===
{{Main|Negative and positive rights}}
There is a traditional distinction between two types of human rights. On the one hand, negative or abstract rights that are respected by non-intervention. On the other hand, positive or concrete rights that require resources for its realisation. However, it is nowadays contested whether it is possible to clearly distinguish between these two types of rights.&lt;ref name="Food and Agriculture Organization 2002"&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2002}}: "The road from Magna Carta."&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to food can accordingly be divided into the negative right to obtain food by one's own actions, and the positive right to be supplied with food if one is unable to access it. The negative right to food was recognised as early as in England’s 1215 [[Magna Carta]] which reads that: "no one shall be ‘amerced’ (fined) to the extent that they are deprived of their means of living."&lt;ref name="Food and Agriculture Organization 2002"/&gt;

=== International developments from 1941 onwards ===
This section provides an overview of international developments relevant to the establishment and implementation of the right to food from the mid-20th century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2010a}}: 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

*1941 - In his [[Four Freedoms]] speech, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] includes as one of the freedoms:&lt;ref name="Ahluwalia 2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Ahluwalia|2004}}: 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“The freedom from want.”
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:*Later this freedom formed part of the 1945 [[United Nations Charter]] (Article 1(3)).&lt;ref name="Ahluwalia 2004"/&gt;

*1948 - [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] recognises the right to food as part of the [[right to an adequate standard of living]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control" (Article 25). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*1966 - The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], reiterates the Universal Declaration of Human Rights with regard to the right to an adequate standard of living and, in addition, specifically recognises the right to be free from hunger. The covenant, states parties recognise:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family, including adequate food” (Article 11.1) and “the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger” (Article 11.2).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:*1976 - Entry into force of the Covenant.

:*1987 - Establishment of the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] overseeing the implementation of the Covenant and beginning a more legal interpretation of the Covenant.

:*1999 - The Committee adopts General Comment No. 12 ‘The Right to Adequate Food’, describing the various State obligations derived from the Covenant regarding the right to food.&lt;ref name="Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1999"/&gt;

:*2009 - Adoption of the [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]], making the right to food justiciable at the international level.

*1974 - Adoption of the [[Universal Declaration on the Eradication of Hunger and Malnutrition]] at the [[World Food Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*1988 - Adoption of the right to food in the [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional Protocols|Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]] (the “Protocol of San Salvador”).
*1996 - The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) organises the 1996 [[World Food Summit]] in Rome, resulting in the [[Rome Declaration on World Food Security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2012b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*2004 - The FAO adopts the [[Right to Food Guidelines]], offering guidance to States on how to implement their obligations on the right to food. The drafting of the guidelines was initiated as a result of the 2002 [[World Food Summit]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

*2000 - The mandate of the [[Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food]] is established.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2012a}}: "Mandate."&lt;/ref&gt;
*2000 - Adoption of the [[Millennium Development Goals]], including Goal 1: to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger by 2015.
*2012 - The [[Food Assistance Convention]] is adopted as a result of the [[Food Aid Convention]] (1985?), making it the first legally binding international treaty on food aid.

[[Amartya Sen]] won his 1998 [[Nobel Prize]] in part for his work in demonstrating that famine and mass starvation in modern times was not typically the product of a lack of food; rather, it usually arose from problems in food distribution networks or from government policies.&lt;ref name="Sen Profile"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Guardian Profile: Amartya Sen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/mar/31/society.politics|publisher=The Guardian|location=London|first=Jonathan|last=Steele|date=19 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==
The right to food is protected under [[international human rights law|international human rights]] and [[international humanitarian law|humanitarian law]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahluwalia|2004}}: 10-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International law ===
The right to food is recognized in the 1948 [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (Article 25) as part of the right to an adequate standard of living, and is enshrined in the 1966 [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (Article 11).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The 2009 [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] makes the right to food justiciable at the international level.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food|2010a}}: 4.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] is adopted, making it the first legally binding international treaty on food aid.

=== International instruments ===
It is also recognized in many specific international instruments as varied as the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] (Article 2), the 1951 [[Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]] (Articles 20 and 23),&lt;ref name="harvnb|Ahluwalia|2004"&gt;{{harvnb|Ahluwalia|2004}}: 11.&lt;/ref&gt; the 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (Articles 24(2)(c) and 27(3)), the 1979 [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (Articles 12(2)), or the 2007 [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] (Articles 25(f) and 28(1)).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

=== Regional instruments ===
The right to food is also recognized in regional instruments, such as the 1988 [[American Convention on Human Rights#Additional Protocols|Additional Protocol to the American Convention on Human Rights in the area of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights]] or “Protocol of San Salvador” (Article 12), the 1990 [[African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child]], the 2001 [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] recognition that the right to food falls under the [[African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights}}: para. 64-66 (p. 26).&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2003 [[Maputo Protocol|Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa]] or "Maputo Protocol" (Article 15). There are also such instruments in many national constitutions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

=== Non-legally binding instruments ===
There are several non-legally binding international human rights instruments relevant to the right to food. They include recommendations, guidelines, resolutions or declarations. The most detailed is the 2004 [[Right to Food Guidelines]]. They are a practical tool to help implement the right to adequate food.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; The Right to Food Guidelines are not legally binding but draw upon international law and are a set of recommendations States have chosen on how to implement their obligations under Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Finally, the 1945 Constitution of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization]] provides that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“the Nations accepting this Constitution, being determined to promote the common welfare by furthering separate and collective action on their part for the purpose of: raising levels of nutrition and standards of living . . . and thus . . . ensuring humanity’s freedom from hunger. . . .” (Preamble).&lt;ref name="harvnb|Ahluwalia|2004"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Other documents ===
In 1993, the ''International Food Security Treaty'' is developed in USA and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The International Food Security Treaty Association|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a Conference on Consensus Strategy on the Right To Food held in Santa Barbara, California, USA with anti-hunger experts from five continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The International Food Security Treaty Association|2012}}: "About the IFST."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a group of national and international organisations create a proposal to replace the European Union [[Common Agricultural Policy]], which is due for change in 2013. The first article of The New Common Food and Agriculture Policy "considers food as a universal human right, not merely a commodity."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Proposal for a New European Agriculture and Food policy that meets the challenges of this century|2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== State obligations ==
State obligations related to the right to food are well-established under international law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; By signing the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ([[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]]) states agreed to take steps to the maximum of their available resources to achieve progressively the full realization of the right to adequate food. They also acknowledge the essential role of international cooperation and assistance in this context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1966}}: article 2(1), 11(1) and 23; {{harvnb|Ziegler|2012}}: "What is the right to food?"&lt;/ref&gt; This obligation was reaffirmed by the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] ([[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|CESCR]]).&lt;ref name="Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1999"/&gt; Signatories to the [[Right to Food Guidelines]] also committed to implementing the right to food at a national level.

In General Comment no. 12, the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|CESCR]] interpreted the states' obligation as being of three types: the obligation to respect, protect and to fulfil:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Respect''' implies that states must never arbitrarily prevent people from having access to food.
# '''Protect''' means that states should take measures to ensure that enterprises or individuals do not deprive individuals of their access to adequate food.
# '''Fulfil (facilitate and provide)''' entails that governments must pro-actively engage in activities intended to strengthen people’s access to and utilization of resources and means to ensure their livelihood, including food security. If, for reasons beyond their control such as at times of war or after a natural disaster, groups or individuals are unable to enjoy their right to food, then states have the obligation to provide that right directly.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2012}}: "What is the right to food?"&lt;/ref&gt;

These were again endorsed by states, when the FAO Council adopted the [[Right to Food Guidelines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2012}}: "What is the right to food?"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]] recognises that the right to freedom from hunger requires international cooperation, and relates to matters of production, the [[agriculture]] and global supply. Article 11 states that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The States Parties to the present Covenant... shall take, individually and through international co-operation, the measures, including specific programmes, which are needed: 
(a) To improve methods of production, conservation and distribution of food by making full use of technical and scientific knowledge, by disseminating knowledge of the principles of nutrition and by developing or reforming [[agrarian system]]s in such a way as to achieve the most efficient development and utilization of natural resources; 
(b) Taking into account the problems of both food-importing and food-exporting countries, to ensure an equitable distribution of world food supplies in relation to need."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The implementation of the right to food standards at national level has consequences for national constitutions, laws, courts, institutions, policies and programmes, and for various food security topics, such as fishing, land, focus on vulnerable groups, and access to resources.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

National strategies on the progressive realization of the right to food should fulfill four functions:
# define the obligations corresponding to the right to adequate food, whether these are the obligations of government or those of private actors;
# improve the coordination between the different branches of government whose activities and programs may affect the realization of the right to food;
# set targets, ideally associated with measurable indicators, defining the timeframe within which particular objectives should be achieved;
# provide for a mechanism ensuring that the effect of new legislative initiatives or policies on the right{{what?|date=June 2016}}.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

;International
The right to food imposes on all States obligations not only towards the persons living on their national territory, but also towards the populations of other States. The right to food is only realised when both national and international obligations are complied with. On the one hand, is the effect of the international environment and, in particular, climate change, malnutrition and food insecurity. On the other hand, the international community can only contribute if legal frameworks and institutions are established at the national level.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

;Non-discrimination
Under article 2(2) of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]], governments agreed that the right to food will be exercised without discrimination on grounds of sex, colour, race, age, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ziegler|2012}}: "What is the right to food?"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|CESCR]] stresses the special attention that should be given to disadvantaged and marginalized farmers, including women farmers, in a rural context.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1999}}: para. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption around the world ==
{{Main|Right to food by country}}

=== Framework law ===
[[File:Right to Food World Map-framework laws.svg|thumb|300px|left|Countries that are developing or have adopted framework laws on the right to food (19).&lt;ref name="Knuth 2011"/&gt;
{{Legend|#6d009a|Adopted a framework law (10).}}
{{Legend|#a25ccf|Drafting a framework law (9).}}]]

A framework law is a "legislative technique used to address cross-sectoral issues."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Framework laws are more specific than a constitutional provision, as it lays down general obligations and principles. However, competent authorities and further legislation which still have to determine specific measures should be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of framework laws was recommended by the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as a "major instrument in the implementation of the national strategy concerning the right to food".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|1999}}: para. 29; cited in&lt;/ref&gt; There are ten countries that have adopted and nine countries that are developing framework laws on food security or the right to food. This development is likely to increase in the coming years.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Knuth|2011"/&gt; Often they are known as food security laws instead of right to food laws, but their effect is usually similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Advantages of framework law includes that the content and scope of the right can be further specified, state and private actor obligations can be spelled out in detail, appropriate institutional mechanisms can be established, and rights to remedies can be provided for.  Further advantages of framework laws include: strengthening government accountability, monitoring, helping government officials understand their role, improving access to courts and by providing administrative recourse mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, provisions for obligations and remedies in existing framework law is not always very thorough, and it is neither always clear what they add to the justiciability of the right to food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, the following ten countries have adopted a framework law on food security or the right to food: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Indonesia,  Nicaragua, Peru and Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in 2011 the following nine countries were drafting a framework law on food security or the right to food: Honduras, India, Malawi, Mexico, Mozambique, Paraguay, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Peru are drafting to update, replace or strengthen their framework law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Right to Food World Map-constitutions-implicit or directive principle.svg|thumb|300px|Countries in which the constitutional right to food is implicit in broader rights, or in which it is explicit in directive principles (41).&lt;ref name="Knuth 2011"/&gt;

{{Legend|#89dc6f|Explicit constitutional directive principle (13).}}

There are various ways in which constitutions can take the right to food or some aspect of it into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 14.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, 56 constitutions protect the right to food in some form or another.&lt;ref name="harvnb|Knuth|2011"/&gt; The three main categories of constitutional recognition are: as an explicit right, as implied in broader human rights or as part of a directive principle. In addition to those, the right can also indirectly be recognised when other human rights are interpreted by a judiciary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Explicit as a right ====
Firstly, the right to food is explicitly and directly recognised as a right in itself or as part of a broader human right in 23 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 14; 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Three different forms can be distinguished.

1. The following nine countries recognise the right to food as a separate and stand-alone right: Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, Guyana, Haiti, Kenya, South Africa, in the Interim Constitution of Nepal (as [[food sovereignty]]) and Nicaragua (as freedom from hunger).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

2. For a specific segment of the population the right to food is recognised in ten countries. Provisions regarding the right to food of children are present in the constitutions of: Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, and South Africa. The right to food of indigenous children is protected in the constitution of Costa Rica. Finally, the right to food of detainees and prisoners is additionally recognised in the constitution of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. Five countries recognize the right to food explicitly as part of a human right to an adequate standard of living, quality of life, or development: Belarus, the Congo, Malawi, Moldova and Ukraine, and two recognise it as part of the right to work: Brazil and Suriname.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Implicit or as directive principle ====
Secondly, the following 31 countries implicitly recognise the right to food in broader human rights:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belgium, Bolivia, Burundi, Cambodia, Czech Rep., Congo, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Ecuador, El Salvador, Eq.uatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Finland, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Guatemala, Guinea, Kyrgyzstan, Malawi, Netherlands, Pakistan, Peru, Romania, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 35-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirdly, the following thirteen countries explicitly recognise the right to food within the constitution as a directive principle or goal:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Malawi, Nigeria, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 35-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applicable via international law ===
[[File:Right to Food World Map-international treaties applicability.svg|thumb|300px|left|Countries which have ratified international law in which the right to food is recognised, and in which at the same time international law is primary or equal to national law (103).&lt;ref name="Knuth 2011"/&gt;
{{Legend|#d9bf2d|Direct applicability: [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]], [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]] and [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] (95).}}
{{Legend|#db6b11|Direct applicability: [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]] and [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] (2).}}
{{Legend|#e39c12|Direct applicability: [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]] and [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|CRC]] (5).}}]]

In some countries international treaties have a higher status than or equal status to national legislation. Consequently, the right to food may be directly applicable via international treaties if such country is member to a treaty in which the right is recognised. Such treaties include the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR), the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] (CRC). Excluding countries in which the right to food is implicitly or explicitly recognised in their constitution, the right is directly applicable in at least 51 additional countries via international treaties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Knuth|2011}}: 23, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Commitment via ICESCR ===
;ICESCR
Parties to the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] have to do everything to guarantee adequate nutrition, including legislating to that effect. The Covenant has become part of national legislation in over 77 countries. In these countries the provision for the right to food in the Covenant can be cited in a court. This has happened in Argentina (in the case of the right to health).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golay|2006}}: 21; see also {{harvnb|Golay|2006}}: 27-8.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Right to Food World Map-ICESCR adoption.svg|thumb|300px|Countries that committed to the right to food by ratifying the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (160).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;
{{Legend|#771600|Ratified the [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|Optional Protocol to the ICESCR]] (8).}}
{{Legend|#c85f47|Ratified the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]] (160).}}
Note: All parties to the optional protocol are also member to the covenant.]]

However, citizens usually cannot prosecute using the Covenant, but can only do so under national law. If a country does not pass such laws a citizen has no redress, even though the state violated the covenant. The implementation of the Covenant is monitored through the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Food and Agriculture Organization|2002}};{{harvnb|Ahluwalia|2004}}: 20.&lt;/ref&gt; In total, 160 countries have ratified the Covenant. A further 32 countries have not ratified the covenant, although 7 of them did sign it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

;Optional protocol
By signing the [[Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|Optional Protocol to the ICESCR]], states recognise the competence of the [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] to receive and consider&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|2008}}: Article 1.&lt;/ref&gt; complaints from individuals or groups who claim their rights under the Covenant have been violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|2008}}: Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, complainants must have exhausted all domestic remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|2008}}: Article 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee can  "examine",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|2008}}: Article 8.&lt;/ref&gt; works towards "friendly settlement",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|2008}}: Article 7.&lt;/ref&gt; in the case of grave or systematic violations of the Covenant, it can "invite that State Party to cooperate" and, finally, could "include a summary account of the results of the proceedings in its annual report".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|2008}}: Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The following seven countries have ratified the Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights: Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mongolia, Slovakia, and Spain. A further 32 countries have signed the optional protocol.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

== Mechanisms to achieve the right to food ==

The Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, Mr. De Schutter, urged the establishment in law of the right to food, so that it can be translated into national strategies and institutions. Furthermore, he recommended [[emerging economies]] to protect the rights of land users, in particular of minority and vulnerable groups. He also advised to support smallholder agriculture in the face of mega-development projects, and to stop soil and water degradation through massive shifts to agroecological practices. Finally, the UN expert suggested adopting a strategy to tackle rising [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|De Schutter|2012}}, para. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations' Article 11 on the Right to Adequate Food suggests several implementation mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1999"/&gt; The Article acknowledges that the most appropriate ways and means of implementing the right to adequate food will inevitably vary significantly from one State to another. Every State must choose its own approaches, but the Covenant clearly requires that each State party take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that everyone is free from hunger and as soon as possible can enjoy the right to adequate food.

The Article emphasizes that the right to food requires full compliance with the principles of accountability, transparency, people's participation, decentralization, legislative capacity and the independence of the judiciary. In terms of strategy to implement the right to food, the Article asks that the States should identify and address critical issues in regard to all aspects of the food system, including the food production and processing, food storage, retail distribution, marketing and its consumption. The implementation strategy should give particular attention to the need to prevent discrimination in access to food shops and retail network, or alternatively to resources for growing food. As part of their obligations to protect people’s resource base for food, States should take appropriate steps to ensure that activities of the private business sector and civil society are in conformity with the right to food.

The Article notes that whenever a State faces severe resource constraints, whether caused by a process of economic adjustment, economic recession, climatic conditions or other factors, measures should be undertaken to ensure that the right to adequate food is especially fulfilled for vulnerable population groups and individuals.&lt;ref name="Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1999"/&gt;

=== Interrelation to other rights ===
The idea of the interdependence and indivisibility of all human rights was a founding principle of the [[United Nations]]. This was recognised in the 1993 [[Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action]] which reads “all human rights are universal, indivisible and interdependent and interrelated." The right to food is considered interlinked with the following human rights in particular: [[right to life]], [[right to livelihood]], [[right to health]], [[right to property]], [[freedom of expression]], [[freedom of information]], [[right to education]], [[freedom of association]], and the [[right to water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ahluwalia|2004}}: 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Other relevant rights include: the [[right to work]], the [[right to social security]], the [[right to social welfare]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Golay|2006}}: 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[right to an adequate standard of living]].

For example, according to the Committee overseeing the implementation of the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|ICESCR]], “the [[right to water]] is a prerequisite for the realization of other human rights.” The need to have adequate water in order to have adequate food is in particular evident in the case of peasant farmers. Access to sustainable water resources for agriculture needs to be ensured to realise the right to food.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights|2002}}: para. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; This applies even more strongly to [[subsistence agriculture]].

==History==
===Foundation and early history===
[[John Monro (surgeon)|John Munro]], President of the [[Incorporation of Surgeons]] in 1712, set in motion a project to establish a "Seminary of Medical Education" in Edinburgh, of which a General Hospital was an integral part.&lt;ref name="Smith,1905"&gt;John Smith, The Origin, Progress and Present Position of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh 1505-1905. Edinburgh: 1905&lt;/ref&gt; His son, [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Alexander Monro]] ''primus'', by then Professor of Anatomy, circulated an anonymous pamphlet in 1721 on the necessity and advantage of erecting a Hospital for the Sick Poor. In 1725 the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] wrote to the stock-holders of the Fishery Company, which was about to be wound up, suggesting that they assign their shares for the purpose of such a hospital. Other donors included many wealthy citizens, most of the physicians and several surgeons, numerous [[Church of Scotland parishes]] (at the urging of their [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland|Assembly]]) and the [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopal meeting houses]] in Edinburgh.&lt;ref name="History 1730"&gt;An Account of the Rise and Establishment of the Infirmary, or HOSPITAL for SICK-POOR, erected at Edinburgh. 1730. Reprinted prob. 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Infirmary Street plaque - geograph.org.uk - 1349951.jpg|thumb|Plaque marking the founding of the Infirmary]]
The committee set up by the donors leased "a house of small rent" near the College from the University for 19 years. Known, at first, as the '''Hospital for the Sick Poor''', the '''Physicians' Hospital''', or '''Little House''', it was established at the head of Robertson's Close on the site of the building on the corner of South Bridge and Infirmary Street, now marked with a plaque, on 6 August 1729.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Comrie|first=J.D.|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/medical/medicine8.pdf|title=History of Scottish Medicine to 1860|publisher=Wellcome Historical Medical Museum|year=1932|page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "[[gentlewoman]]" was engaged as Mistress or House-keeper, and a "Nurse or Servant" was hired for the patients, both women to be resident and "free of the burden of children and the care of a separate family." The physicians, who had seen the poor ''gratis'' twice weekly at their college, arranged for one of their number to attend the hospital, to see both inpatients and outpatients. Six Surgeon-Apothecaries (including Alexander Monro) also agreed to attend in turn, and to dispense the medicines prescribed by the physicians from their own shops, also without payment. The first patient, a lady from Caithness suffering from "[[chlorosis (medicine)|chlorosis]]," was discharged recovered after three months. Thirty five patients were admitted in the first year, of whom 19 were cured, 5 recovered, 5 dismissed either as incurable or for irregularities and one died in the hospital (of "[[Tuberculosis|consumption]]"). They came from all over Scotland, but mainly from Edinburgh and its environs. Diseases cured included pains, inflammations, agues, ulcers, cancers, palsies, flux, consumption, hysterick disorders and melancholy. A free advice and medicine service for out-patients was very popular, receiving a 1,000 patients by 1754,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Tradition of Excellence: A Brief History of Medicine in Edinburgh|last = Blackden|first = Stephanie|publisher = Duncan, Flockhart &amp; Co. Ltd|year = 1981|isbn = |location = Edinburgh|pages = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which presented the hospital with prohibitively high costs and demand. Fundraising began for a new hospital, driven by [[Alexander Monro (primus)|Monro]] and [[George Drummond|Drummond]], and the appeal attracted funds from churches throughout Scotland, landed gentry, private individuals, and prominent professionals including physicians, surgeons, merchants and lawyers, as well as donations of labour and building materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Infirmary Street===
[[File:Old Surgical Hospital, Drummond Street.jpg|thumb|Old Surgical Hospital in Drummond Street]]
The infirmary received a Royal Charter from [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] in 1736 which gave it its name of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lhsa.lib.ed.ac.uk/exhibits/charter/index.htm |title=Royal Charter of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh |accessdate=2015-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and commissioned [[William Adam (architect)|William Adam]] to design a new hospital on a site close by on what became Infirmary Street. In 1741 the hospital moved the short distance to the not yet completed building which eventually, on its completion in 1745, had 228 beds compared to 4 beds in the Little House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/OurOrganisation/AboutUs/OurHistory/Pages/RIEHistory.aspx |title=Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh History |publisher=NHS Lothian |accessdate=2015-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 1830s the hospital had become short of space and, in 1832, the former Royal High School in nearby High School Yards, built by Alexander Laing in 1777, was converted to a [[surgery|surgical hospital]] with a new operating theatre built to the east. This was soon found to be inadequate and a new surgical hospital, designed by [[David Bryce]], was built fronting [[Drummond Street, Edinburgh|Drummond Street]], opening in 1853. The new building was linked to the High School Yards building by an extension to the north.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/118777/edinburgh-high-school-yards-royal-high-school-of-edinburgh|title=Edinburgh, High School Yards, Royal High School Of Edinburgh|publisher=Canmore|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Infirmary Street buildings were demolished in 1884 and replaced with public swimming baths and a school. The ornamental gates and gate piers now front the former surgical hospital on Drummond Street. The four attached Ionic columns on the frontispiece of the hospital were removed and incorporated as a combined column in a monument to the [[Covenanter]]s who were defeated at the [[Battle of Rullion Green]]. This stands outside the entrance to [[Dreghorn Barracks]] on Redford Road in the south west of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scriever.wordpress.com/2011/10/11/monumental-folly-the-covenanters-monument/|title=Monumental Folly – the "Covenanters’ Monument"
|date=11 October 2011|publisher=Word Press|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original surgical theatre, which was on the roof of the 1741 building, was re-erected as part of stables in the grounds of Redford House, also on Redford Road. It has since been converted into a house known as Drummond Scrolls taking its name from the large attached carved bracket scrolls, also from the surgical theatre of 1741. The house is category B-listed by [[Historic Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/144619/edinburgh-141-redford-road-redford-house-drummond-scrolls|title=Edinburgh, 141 Redford Road, Redford House, Drummond Scrolls|publisher=Canmore|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The New System===
Significant changes came with the introduction of the "New System" in 1873.  Four years before, [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Sir Joseph Lister]] had been appointed as Professor of Surgery to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Goldmann M (1987) Lister ward. Bristol: Adam Hilger&lt;/ref&gt; Using antiseptics and narcotics he proved to be very successful, thus attracting patients from higher social classes to the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Wrench G T (1913) Lord Lister. His Life and Work. London: Fisher Unwin&lt;/ref&gt; The hospital managers felt the existing nurses were lacking both medical knowledge and appropriate behaviour. They appointed Deputy Surgeon-General Charles Hamilton Fasson as Medical Superintendent. Fasson recruited a group of 17 trained [[Florence Nightingale|Nightingale Nurses]] from [[St Thomas' Hospital|St. Thomas’s Hospital]] London. In 1873 Elizabeth Barclay and Angélique Lucille Pringle started building up a system of nursing where the nurses were under the control of the Lady Superintendent of Nurses instead of individual ward doctors. They also introduced a systematic training of nurses, who were, after one year of probation, admitted to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh’s Register Book. Accordingly, the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh had implemented the first Scottish nursing school. Up to the movement into the new buildings 102 probationers had been entered into the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh’s Registry Book.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt-Richter R; A review of the introduction of systematic training for nurses at the Royal Infirmary Edinburgh 1872 - 1879.

===Lauriston Place===
[[File:Clocktower of the old Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Clocktower of the old Royal Infirmary in Lauriston Place]]
[[File:Hospitals and Asylums of the World - Portfolio of Plans, p. 16.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor plan of the Lauriston Place site in 1893]]
In 1879, at the instruction of the then [[Lord Provost]], [[Thomas Jamieson Boyd]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf|title=Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the infirmary moved to a new location, then in the fresher air of the edge of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB30306|title=1 Lauriston Place, Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, Main Block, including linked original ward pavilions|publisher=Historic Environment Scotland|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site, on Lauriston Place, had been occupied by [[George Watson's College|George Watson's Hospital]] (a school, known then as a hospital). The school moved a short distance away to the former [[Merchant Maiden Hospital]] (another school) in Archibald Place. The original school building, by the same William Adam as the earlier infirmary, was incorporated into the new [[David Bryce]]-designed infirmary buildings and the chapel remained in use for the entirety of the infirmary's occupation of the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://canmore.org.uk/site/207116/edinburgh-lauriston-place-royal-infirmary-chapel|title=Edinburgh, Lauriston Place, Royal Infirmary, Chapel|publisher=Canmore|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s the hospital needed to expand, and once again George Watson's College was asked to move. An arrangement was reached to acquire the school's site, with the school to remain there until new premises could be built elsewhere. By 1932 the school's new premises in Colinton Road were ready, and the old Archibald Place building was demolished to make way for the Simpson Memorial Pavilion, used primarily as a maternity wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital and Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion collection summary|url = http://www.lhsa.lib.ed.ac.uk/collections/LHB3/lhb3_tlfa.htm|website = lhsa.lib.ed.ac.uk|access-date = 2016-02-17|last = LHSA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, the infirmary was incorporated into the [[NHS Scotland|National Health Service]] (NHS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.60yearsofnhsscotland.co.uk/history/birth-of-nhs-scotland/scotland-in-1948.html|title=Scotland in 1948|publisher=60 years of NHS Scotland|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2001, Lothian Health Trust sold the {{convert|20|acre|m2|sing=on}} Lauriston Place site for £30 million to Southside Capital Ltd., a consortium comprising Taylor Woodrow, Kilmartin Property Group, and the Bank of Scotland. It has been redeveloped as the [[Quartermile]] housing, shopping, leisure and hotel development. Much of the David Bryce infirmary will remain visible, but some infirmary buildings have been demolished. In the build-up to the move to Little France the Royal Charter awarded by George II in 1736 was rediscovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/it-s-get-charter-1-899660 |title=It's Get Charter |publisher=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=3 October 2003 |accessdate=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Little France===
[[File:EdinburghRoyalInfirmary.jpg|thumb|right|The Emergency Department entrance of the new building in Little France, Edinburgh.]]
A new hospital, sited on a mostly [[greenfield land|green field site]] at [[Little France]] in the south-east of the city, was procured under a [[Private Finance Initiative]] contract in 1998. The new location reflected the need for the hospital to serve not just people living in Edinburgh, but also Midlothian and East Lothian. The new hospital is physically linked to the Chancellor's Building, the main teaching facility for the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/medicine-vet-medicine/about/little-france |title=Little France |publisher=University of Edinburgh |accessdate=27 June 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009185930/http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/medicine-vet-medicine/about/little-france |archivedate=9 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new building, which was designed by Keppie Design and constructed by [[Balfour Beatty]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/1785682.stm|title=PFI hospital opens its doors|publisher=BBC|date=28 January 2002|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of £184 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburgharchitecture.co.uk/new_royal_infirmary.htm|title=New Royal Infirmary, Edinburgh, Keppie Architects, Edinburgh Royal Infirmary|work=Edinburgh Architecture|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhslothian.scot.nhs.uk/GoingToHospital/Locations/RIE/Pages/default.aspx |title= Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) |publisher=NHS Lothian |accessdate=27 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was built without air conditioning, and portable units are required for the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=NHS staff threaten action on overheating hospital|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/nhs-staff-threaten-action-on-overheating-hospital-1-1414727 | location=Edinburgh | work=The Scotsman | date=30 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Little France]] site initially attracted some controversy in the local media, such as the ''[[Edinburgh Evening News]]'', not least because the city's main accident and emergency facilities are some distance from the city centre, and also because the public transport links to the site had been criticised as inadequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/health/outcry-over-rise-in-edinburgh-royal-infirmary-parking-fees-1-4401188|title=Outcry over rise in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary parking fees|date=23 March 2017|publisher=Edinburgh Evening News|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also Jim and Margaret Cuthbert, economic consultants, unveiled evidence in the [[Scottish Left Review]] outlining why the PFI scheme was a poor use of public funds whilst resulting in huge profits for private investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishleftreview.org/li/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=64|title=Scottish Left Review - Lifting the Lid on PFI|author=Administrator|work=scottishleftreview.org|accessdate=1 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2016 the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh became one of four major trauma centres where specialist services are based as part of a new national major trauma network in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-26834003 |work=BBC News |title=Scotland trauma centres network 'to boost emergency care' |date=27 April 2014 |accessdate= 13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh|Royal Hospital for Sick Children]] in Edinburgh is being rebuilt on the Little France site beside the Infirmary with an opening scheduled for 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-19635392 |title=New Edinburgh Sick Children's building gets go ahead |work=BBC News |date=19 September 2012|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Infirmary in literature==
The Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh has often been described in works of fiction, biography and history, and depicted from both the point of view of the sick and those caring for them. The English poet [[William Ernest Henley]] e.g.  stayed as a patient at the RIE for three years (1873–75). In several poems he portrayed hospital life as well as individual nurses.&lt;ref&gt;Henley W E (1875): Hospital Outlines: Sketches and Portraits. Cornhill Magazine Vol XXXII pp 120 - 128&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henley W E (1921): Poems. London: Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous patients==
* Former Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] had experimental eye surgery performed as a young undergraduate at the [[University of Edinburgh]] to save his right eye after suffering from [[retinal detachment]] after a [[rugby union]] accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/11/gordon-brown-eye-check-questions|author=Gaby Hinsliff|title=How Gordon Brown's loss of an eye informs his view of the world|work=The Observer|date=10 October 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228234013/http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/11/gordon-brown-eye-check-questions|archivedate=28 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3499">'''SWOG''' (formerly the Southwest Oncology Group) is a [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) supported organization that conducts [[clinical trials]] in adult [[cancers]].

Comprising more than 4,000 cancer researchers at more than 650 institutions across the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], it is one of the largest of the NCI's clinical trial cooperative groups.  Member institutions include 24 of the NCI-designated cancer centers, many university medical centers, private institutions, and Community Clinical Oncology Programs.

SWOG is headquartered at the [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], with an operations office in [[San Antonio, Texas]] and a statistical center in [[Seattle, Washington]].
[[Image:SWOG_logo.gif|thumb|right|250px|SWOG - Leading cancer research. Together.]]

SWOG was created by the NCI in 1956 as the Southwest Cancer Chemotherapy Study Group (SWCCSG) and was headquartered in [[Houston, Texas]].  Its primary purpose was to study [[leukemia]], a cancer of the blood which primarily affects children. Then in 1958, the NCI directed the SWCCSG to include the study of adult cancers, and separate administrative divisions were created for pediatric and adult cancers.  The group's name was eventually changed to Southwest Oncology Group to reflect its new mission.  Although in its early decades most SWOG member institutions were located in the [[Southwestern United States]], the group spread to include members all over the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].  In 2010, in recognition of this national scope, the group dropped the regional qualifier from its name and adopted the acronym, SWOG, as its official name.

==Quality Assurance==
SWOG has all of its protocol-driven cases reviewed at the [[Quality Assurance Review Center]] (QARC). As mandated by the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI), every [[radiotherapy]] (RT) department participating in a SWOG study submits their data to QARC for review. QARC is located in [[Lincoln, Rhode Island]] and reviews thousands of RT cases per year. The center was founded in 1977 as a not-for-profit health care organization designed to provide quality assurance for [[CALGB]] studies. Radiotherapy data from around one-thousand [[hospitals]] in both the [[United States]] and abroad is reviewed and archived at QARC.

Another center for quality assurance is the [[Radiological Physics Center]] (RPC) in [[Houston, Texas]]. The primary responsibility of the RPC is to assure the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) and its cooperative groups like SWOG that all participating institutions are following the basic guidelines regarding the physics-related aspects of radiotherapy. Established in 1968, the RPC has consistently received funding from the NCI in order to perform the aforementioned mission.

'''Maxillary sinus floor augmentation'''&lt;ref&gt;Boyne, PJ. &lt;u&gt;De novo bone induction by recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) in maxillary sinus floor augmentation&lt;/u&gt;. ''J Oral Maxillofac Surg'' 2005;63:1693-1707&lt;/ref&gt; (also termed '''sinus lift''', '''sinus graft''', '''sinus augmentation''' or '''sinus procedure''') is a [[Surgery|surgical procedure]] which aims to increase the amount of bone in the [[Commonly used terms of relationship and comparison in dentistry|posterior]] [[maxilla]] (upper jaw bone), in the area of the [[premolar]] and [[molar (tooth)|molar]] [[teeth]], by lifting the lower [[Schneiderian membrane]] (sinus membrane) and placing a bone graft.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colgate.com/en/us/oc/oral-health/cosmetic-dentistry/implants/article/sinus-lift&lt;/ref&gt;

When a tooth is lost the [[alveolar process]] begins to remodel. The vacant tooth socket collapses as it heals leaving an [[edentulous]] (toothless) area, termed a ''ridge''. This collapse causes a loss in both height and width of the surrounding bone. In addition, when a maxillary molar or premolar is lost, the floor of the maxillary sinus expands, which further diminishes the thickness of the underlying bone. Overall, this leads to a loss in volume of bone that is available for implantation of [[dental implant]]s, which rely on [[osseointegration]] (bone integration), to replace missing teeth. The goal of the sinus lift is to graft extra bone into the maxillary sinus, so more bone is available to support a dental implant.&lt;ref name=Esposito2016&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esposito|first=Marco|last2=Felice|first2=Pietro|last3=Worthington|first3=Helen V.|date=2014-05-13|title=Interventions for replacing missing teeth: augmentation procedures of the maxillary sinus|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|issue=5|pages=CD008397|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008397.pub2|issn=1469-493X|pmid=24825543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indications==

While there may be a number of reasons for wanting a greater volume of bone in the posterior maxilla, the most common reason in contemporary dental treatment planning is to prepare the site for the future placement of [[dental implant]]s.

Sinus augmentation (sinus lift) is performed when the floor of the sinus is too close to an area where dental implants are to be placed. This procedure is performed to ensure a secure place for the implants while protecting the sinus. Lowering of the sinus can be caused by: Long-term tooth loss without the required treatment, periodontal disease, trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Brentwood Periodontists http://implantperiocenter.com/patient-education/sinus-augmentation-sinus-lift&lt;/ref&gt;

Patients who have the following may be good candidates for sinus augmentation.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.infusebonegraft.com/omf_sinus_lift.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lost more than one tooth in the posterior maxilla.
* Lost a significant amount of bone in the posterior maxilla.
* Missing teeth due to genetics or birth defect.
* Minus most of the [[maxilla]]ry teeth and need a strong sinus floor for multiple implants.
It is not known if using sinus lift techniques is more successful than using short implants for reducing the number of artificial teeth or dental implant failures up to a year after teeth/implant placement.&lt;ref name=Esposito2016 /&gt;

==Technique==

Prior to undergoing sinus augmentation, diagnostics are run to determine the health of the patient's sinuses. [[Panoramic radiograph]]s are taken to map out the patient's upper jaw and sinuses. In special instances, a computed tomography or [[CT scan]] is taken to measure the sinus's height and width, and to rule out any sinus disease or [[pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colgate.com/app/Colgate/US/OC/Information/OralHealthBasics/CheckupsDentProc/DenturesAndDentalImplants/SinusLift.cvsp|title=Sinus Lift|work=colgate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several variations of the sinus lift technique.

=== Traditional Sinus Augmentation or Lateral Window Technique ===
There are multiple ways to perform sinus augmentation.  The procedure is performed from inside the patient's mouth where the surgeon makes an incision into the gum, or [[gingiva]].  Once the incision is made, the surgeon then pulls back the gum tissue, exposing the lateral boney wall of the sinus. The surgeon then cuts a "window" to the [[Sinus (anatomy)|sinus]], which is exposing the [[Schneiderian membrane]]. The membrane is separated from the bone, and bone graft material is placed into the newly created space. The gums are then sutured close and the graft is left to heal for 4–12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Sinus Lift Surgery {{!}} Perio.org|url = https://www.perio.org/consumer/sinus-augmentation|website = www.perio.org|accessdate = 2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The graft material used can be either an autograft, an allograft, a xenograft, an alloplast (a growth-factor infused collagen matrix), synthetic variants, or combinations thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Bone grafts in dentistry|journal = Journal of Pharmacy &amp; Bioallied Sciences|date = 2013-06-01|issn = 0976-4879|pmc = 3722694|pmid = 23946565|pages = S125–S127|volume = 5|issue = Suppl 1|doi = 10.4103/0975-7406.113312|first = Prasanna|last = Kumar|first2 = Belliappa|last2 = Vinitha|first3 = Ghousia|last3 = Fathima}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies indicate that the mere lifting of the sinus membrane, creation of a void space and blood clot formation might result in new bone owing to the principles of guided bone regeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hurley LA, Stinchfield FE, Bassett AL, Lyon WH |title=The role of soft tissues in osteogenesis.

=== Osteotome Technique ===
As an alternative, sinus augmentation can be performed by a less invasive osteotome technique. There are several variations of this technique and all originate from the original technique of Dr. Tatum, first published by Dr.s Boyne and James in 1980.

Dr. Robert B. Summers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SUMMERS|first=ROBERT B.|date=1998-05|title=Sinus Floor Elevation with Osteotomes|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1708-8240.1998.tb00352.x|journal=Journal of Esthetic and Restorative Dentistry|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=164–171|doi=10.1111/j.1708-8240.1998.tb00352.x|issn=1496-4155}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a technique that is normally performed when the sinus floor that needs to be lifted is less than 4&amp;nbsp;mm. This technique is performed by flapping back gum tissue and making a socket in the bone within 1–2&amp;nbsp;mm short of the sinus membrane. The floor of the sinus is then lifted by tapping the sinus floor with the use of [[osteotome]]s. The amount of augmentation achieved with the osteotome technique is usually less than what can be achieved with the lateral window technique.
A dental implant is normally placed in the socket formed at the time of the sinus lift procedure and left to integrate with bone. Bone integration normally lasts 4 to 8 months. The goal of this procedure is to stimulate bone growth and form a thicker sinus floor, in order to support dental implants for teeth replacement.

Dr. Bruschi and Scipioni&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruschi|first=G. B.|last2=Scipioni|first2=A.|last3=Calesini|first3=G.|last4=Bruschi|first4=E.|date=1998-3|title=Localized management of sinus floor with simultaneous implant placement: a clinical report|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9581408|journal=The International Journal of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Implants|volume=13|issue=2|pages=219–226|issn=0882-2786|pmid=9581408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bruschi|first=Giovanni B.|last2=Crespi|first2=Roberto|last3=Capparè|first3=Paolo|last4=Bravi|first4=Fabrizio|last5=Bruschi|first5=Ernesto|last6=Gherlone|first6=Enrico|date=2013-4|title=Localized management of sinus floor technique for implant placement in fresh molar sockets|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21599829|journal=Clinical Implant Dentistry and Related Research|volume=15|issue=2|pages=243–250|doi=10.1111/j.1708-8208.2011.00348.x|issn=1708-8208|pmid=21599829}}&lt;/ref&gt; described a similiar technique (Localized Management of Sinus Floor or L.M.S.F.) that is based on a partial thickness flap procedure. This technique increases the malleability of the crestal bone and uses not the bone directly below the sinus, but rather the bone on the medial wall, and thus can be used in more extreme cases of bone resorption that would normally need to be treated with the lateral wall technique. The healing period is reduced to 1.5 to 3 months. Recently an electrical mallet&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crespi|first=Roberto|last2=Capparè|first2=Paolo|last3=Gherlone|first3=Enrico Felice|date=2013-01-18|title=Electrical mallet provides essential advantages in split-crest and immediate implant placement|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10006-013-0389-2|journal=Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=59–64|doi=10.1007/s10006-013-0389-2|issn=1865-1550}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been introduced to simplify the application of this and similiar techniques.

This technique was invented in 1996, by [[Dr. Leon Chen]]. There are other methods of this such as the Intralift(tm) from ACTEON that are also clinically proven.

Unlike the traditional methods of sinus lifts, which typically use an [[osteotomy]] of the lateral aspect of the [[maxilla]], the Hydraulic Sinus Condensing, or HSC technique, uses an osteotomy on the lateral aspect of the ridge of the maxilla. The HSC technique has shown to have much shorter recovery times&lt;ref name="ChenLeon"&gt;Chen, Leon, &amp; Cha, Jennifer, ''An 8-Year Retrospective Study: 1,100 Patients Receiving 1,557 Implants using the Minimally Invasive Hydraulic Sinus Condensing Technique'', 'Innovations in Periodontics, Volume 76, Number 3, Page 482  March, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; than the traditional method. A dental implant is placed at the same time as the sinus lift, also reducing the healing time.

The gum tissue is flapped to access the underlying bone. An osteotomy (bone removal) is initiated along the ridge. Drilling ceases about 1mm short of the sinus floor. Hydraulic pressure is introduced to the surgical site at this stage, providing just enough force to begin atraumatically dissecting the membrane from the sinus floor. Once the membrane is loosened, the hydraulic pressure is ceased. The membrane at rest is slightly detached from the bone. A bone grafting mixture is then packed through the hole and pushed gently against the membrane. This pressure will slightly raise the sinus, resting it on the newly placed bone.

Once the initial lift is complete, the surgeon drills a socket in the bone that is sized to the new implant. Bone graft material is added again with pressure to further lift the sinus until it is raised to the proper height for implant placement. The surgeon then places the [[dental implant]] into the bone socket and sutures the gums back into place.

Over an 8-year study of 1,557 implants in 1,100 patients using the Hydraulic Sinus Condensing technique, only 8 implants failed, resulting in a 99.99% success rate.&lt;ref name="ChenLeon" /&gt;

==Complications==

A major risk of a sinus augmentation is that the sinus membrane could be pierced or ripped.  Remedies, should this occur, include stitching the tear or placing a patch over it; in some cases, the surgery is stopped altogether and the tear is given time to heal, usually three to six months. Often, the sinus membrane grows back thicker and stronger, making success more likely on the second operation.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Although rarely reported, such secondary intervention can also be successful when the primary surgery is limited to elevation of the membrane without the insertion of additional material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Kharazmi M, Hallberg P|title= Secondary sinus lift: viable technique for when a membrane is raised without a graft, and fails. |journal= Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg|doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides tearing of the sinus membrane, there are other risks involved in sinus augmentation surgery. Most notably, the close relationship of the augmentation site with the sinonasal complex can induce sinusitis, which may chronicize and cause severe symptoms. Sinusitis resulting from maxillary sinus augmentation is considered a Class 1 sinonasal complication according to Felisati classification and should be addressed surgically with a combined endoscopic endonasal and endoral approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Felisati, Giovanni, Chiapasco, Matteo, Lozza, Paolo, Saibene, Alberto Maria, Pipolo, Carlotta, Zaniboni, Matteo, Biglioli, Federico &amp; Borloni, Roberto, |title=Sinonasal complications resulting from dental treatment: outcome-oriented proposal of classification and surgical protocol |journal=American Journal of Rhinology and Allergy | volume =27 | issue= 4 | page= e101 |date=  July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beside sinusitis, among other procedure related-risks include:

* Infection&lt;ref name=Esposito2016 /&gt;
* Inflammation
* Pain
* Itching
* Allergic reaction
* Tissue or nerve damage&lt;ref name=Esposito2016 /&gt;
* Scar formation
* [[Hematoma]]
* Graft failure
* [[Oro-antral communication]] / oro-antral fistula
* Tilting or loosening of implants
* Bleeding&lt;ref name=Esposito2016 /&gt;

==Recovery==

It takes about three to six months for the sinus augmentation bone to become part of the patient's natural sinus floor bone. Up to six months of healing is sometimes left before implants are attempted. However, some surgeons perform both the augmentation and dental implant simultaneously, to avoid the necessity of two surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlantadentist.com/Sinus_Augmentation.html|title=404 Not Found|work=atlantadentist.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first maxillary sinus floor augmentation procedure was performed by [[Hilt Tatum|Oscar Hilt Tatum, Jr.]] in 1974.

A sinus-lift procedure was first performed by Dr. Hilt Tatum Jr. in 1974 during his period of preparation to begin sinus grafting. The first sinus graft was done by Tatum in February, 1975 in Lee County Hospital in Opelika, Alabama. This was followed by the placement and successful restoration of two endosteal implants. Between 1975–1979, much of the sinus lining elevation was done using inflatable catheters. After this, suitable instruments had been developed to manage the lining elevation from the different anatomical surfaces encountered in sinuses. Tatum first presented the concept at The Alabama Implant Congress in Birmingham, Alabama in 1976 and presented the evolution of technique during multiple podium presentations each year until 1986 when he published an article describing the procedure. Dr. Philip Boyne was introduced to the procedure when he was invited, by Tatum, to be "The Discusser" of a presentation on sinus grafting given by Tatum at the annual meeting of The American Academy of Implant Dentistry in 1977 or 1978. Boyne and James authored the first publication on the technique in 1980 when they published case reports of autogenous grafts placed into the sinus and allowed to heal for 6 months, which was followed by the placement of blade implants. This sequence was confirmed by Boyne before the attendees at The Alabama Implant Congress in 1994.

==Cost-effectiveness==
The slightly higher effectiveness (implant survival) of the lateral sinus lift technique needs to be considered in relation to the substantially higher costs in comparison with the transalveolar sinus lift technique. From a patient perspective the higher invasiviness of the lateral technique will also be an important decision criterion. However, the transalveolar approach is unlikely to be effective in cases of advanced levels of bone reduction at the implant site.&lt;ref name="PMID20546083"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Listl S, Faggion CM | pmid = 20546083 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-051X.2010.01577.x | volume=37 | issue = 8 | title=An economic evaluation of different sinus lift techniques | date=Aug 2010 | journal=J Clin Periodontol | pages=777–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''smoking jacket''' is an overgarment designed to be worn while smoking [[tobacco]], usually in the form of [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe]]s and [[cigar]]s.

The [[dinner jacket]] evolved out of the smoking jacket – essentially a formal wear without tail – following the example of the then Prince, later King  [[Edward VII]].

==Design==
[[File:GregoryAntonBurgundySmokingJacket.jpg|thumb|Burgundy smoking jacket from the 1944 film ''Gaslight'']]
The [[classic]] smoking jacket is a mid thigh-length jacket made from [[velvet]], [[silk]], or both. It has a [[shawl collar]] and turn-up [[cuff]]s and toggle or [[button]] fastenings, or may simply be closed with a tie belt.

In the 1850s, the ''[[Gentlemen's Magazine]] of London'' defined the smoking jacket as a "kind of short [[Banyan (clothing)|robe de chambre]], of velvet, cashmere, plush, merino or printed flannel, lined with bright colours, ornamented with brandebourgs [i.e. [[Frog (fastening)]]s], olives or large buttons."&lt;ref name="edmonton"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/sports/story.html?id=c70b935c-da8c-4276-a128-f150c1410c66|title=Consider the smoking jacket|last=McCormack|first=Derek|date=December 18, 2007|publisher=Edmonton Journal|accessdate=2009-02-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006095400/http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/sports/story.html?id=c70b935c-da8c-4276-a128-f150c1410c66|archivedate=October 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 17th century, goods began flowing into Europe from India, Asia and the Americas, bringing in spices, tobacco, coffee, and silks. It became fashionable to be depicted in one's portrait wearing a silk ''robe de chambre'', or [[dressing gown]]. One of the earliest mentions of this garment comes from [[Samuel Pepys]], who desired to be depicted in his portrait in a silk gown but could not afford one, so he rented one:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thence home and eat one mouthful, and so to Hale's and there sat until almost quite dark upon working my gowne, which I hired to be drawn (in) it—an Indian gown, and I do see all the reason to expect a most excellent picture of it. —''Diary'', 30 March 1666&lt;ref name="cigar" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The short smoking jacket soon evolved from these silk garments. When the [[Crimean War]] during the 1850s popularised [[Turkish tobacco]] in Britain, smoking gained in popularity. After dinner, a gentleman might put on a smoking jacket and retreat to a [[smoking room]] (akin to a  [[Den (room)|den]] or [[mancave]]). The jacket was intended to absorb the smoke from his cigar or pipe and protect his clothing from falling ash.&lt;ref name="edmonton" /&gt;

The smoking jacket remained a popular accessory into the 20th century. An editorial in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in 1902 gave the opinion that the smoking jacket was "synonymous with comfort",&lt;ref name="slippers"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/249515112.html?dids=249515112:249515112&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=AUG+02%2C+1908&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post|title=The Joy of Slippers|date=August 2, 1908|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; while a Pennsylvania newspaper opined in 1908 that it would be "putting it mildly to say that a new House Coat or Smoking Jacket will give any man reason for elation".&lt;ref name="derrick"&gt;{{cite news|title=House Coats and Bath Robes|date=7 December 1908|publisher=Oil City Derrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous wearers included [[Jon Pertwee]], [[Cary Grant]], [[Fred Astaire]] (who was buried in a smoking jacket), [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Dean Martin]] and [[Hugh Hefner]].&lt;ref name="edmonton" /&gt;

==Modern smoking jacket==
Smoking jackets have declined in popularity since the 1950s, though a minority of wearers still exists; ''Playboy'' mogul [[Hugh Hefner]] was a notable example. In its January/February 1999 issue, ''[[Cigar Aficionado]]'' stated that it was time the smoking jacket be brought back, perhaps as an "alternative type of [[formal wear|formalwear]]".&lt;ref name="cigar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Features/CA_Feature_Basic_Template/0,2344,598,00.html|title=Where there's smoke...|last=Boyer|first=G.

==Other uses of the term==
In Bulgarian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, and other European languages, the term ''smoking'' indicates a [[tuxedo]]; see [[Le Smoking]].

He was known as a poet of dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ring|first1=ME|title=Solyman Brown, a giant of dentistry and its poet laureate.|journal=Journal of California Dental Association|date= 2002|pmid=12002252|volume=30|pages=216–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Brown was born in [[Litchfield, Connecticut]]. He studied at [[Yale College]] during his college years. He became a minister and a teacher at [[Litchfield Female Academy]].

In 1832, Solyman decided to practice dentistry after meeting [[Eleazer Parmly]]. He married Elizabeth Butler Brown in 1834 and settled in NYC.

Brown worked with well renowned dentists such as [[Chapin A. Harris]] and [[Norman William Kingsley]].  He was known for his role in establishing the ''American Association of Dental Surgeons'', and being the editor in chief of ''American Journal and Library of Dental Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birth of Solyman Brown, dentist-poet|url=http://americanliteraryblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/birth-of-soylman-brown-dentist-poet.html|accessdate=15 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''SpecTrek'''''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spectrekking.com&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[augmented reality]] [[ghost]] hunting game. The [[game]] won second prize in the "[[Android Developer Challenge#Android Developers Challenge II|Android Developer Challenge II]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.spectrekking.full |title=SpecTrek - Android app |publisher=Appbrain.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; lifestyle category.

SpecTrek was designed to have the user work-out whilst playing the game, the tag line for the game is "protect the world, stay in shape". There are three default games to play, short which lasts 15 minutes, medium which lasts for 30 minutes, and long which lasts for 60 minutes. SpecTrek projects ghosts at various locations on a [[Google map]] in either a predetermined search radius or a user defined search radius. To play the user must walk to these [[ghosts]], if within range the user can scan and find out what kind of ghost is nearby as well as how far said ghost is from their current position. If the user is unable to reach a ghost, a horn may be blown which makes all nearby ghosts flee and possibly stop within reach of another accessible location.

The user catches ghosts by tilting their phone to the "camera-position". Through the [[camera]] the user can scan the ghosts, see the ghosts in augmented reality and of course catch the ghosts.

Other features may include a small lower jaw ([[Micrognathism|micrognathia]]), [[cubitus valgus]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapter on Amenorrhea in: {{cite book | last1 = Bradshaw | first1 = Karen D. | last2 = Schorge | first2 = John O. | last3 = Schaffer | first3 = Joseph | first4 = Lisa M. | last4 = Halvorson | last5 = Hoffman | first5 = Barbara G. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Williams' Gynecology |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location= |year=2008 |pages= |isbn=0-07-147257-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; soft upturned nails, palmar crease, and [[Ptosis (eyelid)|drooping eyelids]]. Less common are pigmented [[Melanocytic nevus|moles]], hearing loss, and a high-arch palate (narrow maxilla). Turner syndrome manifests itself differently in each female affected by the condition; therefore, no two individuals share the same features.

While most of the physical findings are harmless, significant medical problems can be associated with the syndrome. Most of these significant conditions are treatable with surgery and medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stochholm K, Juul S, Juel K, Naeraa RW, Gravholt CH | title = Prevalence, incidence, diagnostic delay, and mortality in Turner syndrome | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 91 | issue = 10 | pages = 3897–902 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 16849410 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2006-0558 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cardiovascular ===
The rate of cardiovascular malformations among patients with Turner syndrome ranges from 17% &lt;ref&gt;(Landin-Wilhelmsen et al., 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; to 45%.&lt;ref name="dawson"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dawson-Falk KL, Wright AM, Bakker B, Pitlick PT, Wilson DM, Rosenfeld RG | title = Cardiovascular evaluation in Turner syndrome: utility of MR imaging | journal = Australasian Radiology | volume = 36 | issue = 3 | pages = 204–9 | date = August 1992 | pmid = 1445102 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1673.1992.tb03152.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The variations found in the different studies are mainly attributable to variations in noninvasive methods used for screening and the types of lesions that they can characterize.&lt;ref&gt;(Ho et al., 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; However,&lt;ref name="sybert"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sybert VP | title = Cardiovascular malformations and complications in Turner syndrome | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 101 | issue = 1 | pages = E11 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9417175 | doi = 10.1542/peds.101.1.e11 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9417175 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it could be simply attributable to the small number of subjects in most studies.

Different karyotypes may have differing rates of cardiovascular malformations. Two studies found a rate of cardiovascular malformations of 30%&lt;ref name=Mazzanti /&gt; and 38%&lt;ref name=pmid7826114&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gøtzsche CO, Krag-Olsen B, Nielsen J, Sørensen KE, Kristensen BO | title = Prevalence of cardiovascular malformations and association with karyotypes in Turner's syndrome | journal = Archives of Disease in Childhood | volume = 71 | issue = 5 | pages = 433–6 | date = November 1994 | pmid = 7826114 | pmc = 1030059 | doi = 10.1136/adc.71.5.433 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a group of pure 45,X monosomy. Considering other karyotype groups, though, they reported a prevalence of 24.3%&lt;ref name=Mazzanti /&gt; and 11%&lt;ref name=pmid7826114 /&gt; in people with mosaic X monosomy, and a rate of 11% in people with X chromosomal structural abnormalities.&lt;ref name=Mazzanti /&gt;

The higher rate in the group of pure 45,X monosomy is primarily due to a difference in the rate of [[aortic valve]] abnormalities and [[coarctation of the aorta]], the two most common cardiovascular malformations.

==== Congenital heart disease ====
The most commonly observed are congenital obstructive lesions of the left side of the heart, leading to reduced flow on this side of the heart. This includes [[bicuspid aortic valve]] and [[coarctation]] (narrowing) of the aorta. More than 50% of the cardiovascular malformations of individuals with Turner syndrome in one study were bicuspid aortic valves or coarctation of the aorta (usually preductal), alone or in combination.&lt;ref name="sybert" /&gt;

Other congenital cardiovascular malformations, such as partial anomalous venous drainage and [[aortic valve stenosis]] or aortic regurgitation, are also more common in Turner syndrome than in the general population. [[Hypoplastic left heart syndrome]] represents the most severe reduction in left-sided structures.

===== Bicuspid aortic valve =====
Up to 15% of adults with Turner syndrome have bicuspid aortic valves, meaning only two, instead of three, parts to the valves in the main [[blood vessel]] leading from the [[heart]] are present.  Since bicuspid valves are capable of regulating blood flow properly, this condition may go undetected without regular screening. However, bicuspid valves are more likely to deteriorate and later fail. [[Calcification]] also occurs in the valves,&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|ped|2486|Aortic Valve, Bicuspid}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may lead to a progressive valvular dysfunction as evidenced by aortic stenosis or regurgitation.&lt;ref name=Elsheikh&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elsheikh M, Dunger DB, Conway GS, Wass JA | title = Turner's syndrome in adulthood | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 120–40 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11844747 | doi = 10.1210/er.23.1.120 | url = http://edrv.endojournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11844747 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a rate from 12.5%&lt;ref name=Mazzanti&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mazzanti L, Cacciari E | title = Congenital heart disease in patients with Turner's syndrome. Italian Study Group for Turner Syndrome (ISGTS) | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 133 | issue = 5 | pages = 688–92 | date = November 1998 | pmid = 9821430 | doi = 10.1016/s0022-3476(98)70119-2 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/a93658 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 17.5% (Dawson-Falk et al., 1992), bicuspid aortic valve is the most common congenital malformation affecting the heart in this syndrome. It is usually isolated, but it may be seen in combination with other anomalies, particularly coarctation of the aorta.

===== Coarctation of the aorta =====
Between 5% and 10% of those born with Turner syndrome have coarctation of the aorta, a congenital narrowing of the descending aorta, usually just distal to the origin of the [[subclavian artery|left subclavian artery]] (the artery that branches off the arch of the aorta to the left arm) and opposite to the ductus arteriosus (termed "juxtaductal"). Estimates of the prevalence of this malformation in patients with Turner syndrome range from 6.9&lt;ref name=Mazzanti /&gt; to 12.5%. A coarctation of the aorta in a female is suggestive of Turner syndrome and suggests the need for further tests, such as a karyotype.

===== Partial anomalous venous drainage =====
This abnormality is a relatively rare congenital heart disease in the general population. The prevalence of this abnormality also is low (around 2.9%) in Turner syndrome. However, its relative risk is 320 in comparison with the general population. Strangely, Turner syndrome seems to be associated with unusual forms of partial anomalous venous drainage.&lt;ref name=Mazzanti /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prandstraller D, Mazzanti L, Picchio FM, Magnani C, Bergamaschi R, Perri A, Tsingos E, Cacciari E | title = Turner's syndrome: cardiologic profile according to the different chromosomal patterns and long-term clinical follow-Up of 136 nonpreselected patients | journal = Pediatric Cardiology | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 108–12 | year = 1999 | pmid = 9986886 | doi = 10.1007/s002469900416 | url = http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/journals/00246/bibs/20n2p108.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20020119201138/http://link.springer-ny.com/link/service/journals/00246/bibs/20n2p108.html | df =  | deadurl = yes | archivedate = 2002-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a patient with Turner syndrome, these left-sided cardiovascular malformations can result in an increased susceptibility to bacterial endocarditis. Therefore, prophylactic antibiotics should be considered when procedures with a high risk of endocarditis are performed, such as dental cleaning.&lt;ref name=Elsheikh /&gt;

Turner syndrome is often associated with persistent [[hypertension]], sometimes in childhood. In the majority of Turner syndrome patients with hypertension, no specific cause is known. In the remainder, it is usually associated with cardiovascular or kidney abnormalities, including coarctation of the aorta.

==== Aortic dilation, dissection, and rupture ====
Two studies have suggested aortic dilatation in Turner syndrome, typically involving the root of the ascending aorta and occasionally extending through the aortic arch to the descending aorta, or at the site of previous coarctation of the aorta repair.&lt;ref name=Lin&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lin AE, Lippe B, Rosenfeld RG | title = Further delineation of aortic dilation, dissection, and rupture in patients with Turner syndrome | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 102 | issue = 1 | pages = e12 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 9651464 | doi = 10.1542/peds.102.1.e12 | url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9651464 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A study that evaluated 28 girls with Turner syndrome found a greater mean aortic root diameter in people with Turner syndrome than in the control group (matched for body surface area). Nonetheless, the aortic root diameters found in Turner syndrome patients were still well within the limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen DB, Hendricks SA, Levy JM | title = Aortic dilation in Turner syndrome | journal = The Journal of Pediatrics | volume = 109 | issue = 2 | pages = 302–5 | date = August 1986 | pmid = 3734967 | doi = 10.1016/S0022-3476(86)80001-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* This has been confirmed by a study that evaluated 40 patients with Turner syndrome.&lt;ref name="dawson" /&gt; The study presented basically the same findings: a greater mean aortic root diameter, which nevertheless remains within the normal range for body surface area.

Whether aortic root diameters that are relatively large for body surface area but still well within normal limits imply a risk for progressive dilatation remains unproven.&lt;ref name="sybert" /&gt;

===== Rate of aortic abnormalities =====
The prevalence of aortic root dilatation ranges from 8.8&lt;ref name=Lin /&gt; to 42%&lt;ref name=Elsheikh /&gt; in patients with Turner syndrome. Even if not every aortic root dilatation necessarily goes on to an [[aortic dissection]] (circumferential or transverse tear of the intima), complications such as dissection, aortic rupture resulting in death may occur. The natural history of aortic root dilatation is still unknown, but it is linked to aortic dissection and rupture, which has a high mortality rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Concha Ruiz M | title = [Surgical treatment of the aortic root dilatation] | language = Spanish | journal = Anales De La Real Academia Nacional De Medicina | volume = 123 | issue = 3 | pages = 557–68; discussion 569–71 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17451098 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aortic dissection affects 1 to 2% of patients with Turner syndrome. As a result, any aortic root dilatation should be seriously taken into account, as it could become a fatal aortic dissection. Routine surveillance is highly recommended.&lt;ref name=Elsheikh /&gt;

===== Risk factors for aortic rupture =====
Cardiovascular malformations (typically bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of the aorta, and some other left-sided cardiac malformations) and hypertension predispose to aortic dilatation and dissection in the general population. Indeed, these same risk factors are found in more than 90% of patients with Turner syndrome who develop aortic dilatation. Only a small number of patients (around 10%) have no apparent predisposing risk factors. The risk of hypertension is increased three-fold in patients with Turner syndrome. Because of its relation to aortic dissection, blood pressure must be regularly monitored and hypertension should be treated aggressively with an aim to keep blood pressure below 140/80 mmHg. As with the other cardiovascular malformations, complications of aortic dilatation is commonly associated with 45,X karyotype.&lt;ref name=Elsheikh /&gt;

===== Pathogenesis of aortic dissection and rupture =====
The exact role that these risk factors play in the process leading to rupture is unclear. Aortic root dilatation is thought to be due to a mesenchymal defect as pathological evidence of cystic medial necrosis has been found by several studies. The association between a similar defect and aortic dilatation is well established in such conditions such as [[Marfan syndrome]]. Also, abnormalities in other [[Mesenchymal stem cell|mesenchymal]] tissues (bone matrix and lymphatic vessels) suggests a similar primary mesenchymal defect in patients with Turner syndrome.&lt;ref name=Lin /&gt; However, no evidence suggests that patients with Turner syndrome have a significantly higher risk of aortic dilatation and dissection in absence of predisposing factors. So, the risk of aortic dissection in Turner syndrome appears to be a consequence of structural cardiovascular malformations and hemodynamic risk factors rather than a reflection of an inherent abnormality in connective tissue. The natural history of aortic root dilatation is unknown, but because of its lethal potential, this aortic abnormality needs to be carefully followed.

=== Skeletal ===
Normal skeletal development is inhibited due to a large variety of factors, mostly hormonal. The average height of a woman with Turner syndrome, in the absence of growth hormone treatment, is {{nowrap|4 ft 7 in}} (140&amp;nbsp;cm). Patients with Turner's mosaicism can reach normal average height.

The fourth metacarpal bone (fourth toe and ring finger) may be unusually short, as may the fifth.

Due to inadequate production of [[estrogen]], many of those with Turner syndrome develop [[osteoporosis]]. This can decrease height further, as well as exacerbate the curvature of the spine, possibly leading to [[scoliosis]]. It is also associated with an increased risk of [[bone fracture]]s.

=== Kidney ===
About one-third of all women with Turner syndrome have one of three kidney abnormalities:

# A single, horseshoe-shaped kidney on one side of the body
# An abnormal urine-collecting system
# Poor blood flow to the kidneys

Some of these conditions can be corrected surgically. Even with these abnormalities, the kidneys of most women with Turner syndrome function normally. However, as noted above, kidney problems may be associated with [[hypertension]].

=== Thyroid ===
Approximately one-third of all women with Turner syndrome have a thyroid disorder.&lt;ref name="In Adulthood"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Elsheikh M, Dunger DB, Conway GS, Wass JA | title = Turner's syndrome in adulthood | journal = Endocrine Reviews | volume = 23 | issue = 1 | pages = 120–40 | date = February 2002 | pmid = 11844747 | doi = 10.1210/edrv.23.1.0457 | url = http://press.endocrine.org/doi/full/10.1210/edrv.23.1.0457#citart1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually it is [[hypothyroidism]], specifically [[Hashimoto's thyroiditis]]. If detected, it can be easily treated with thyroid hormone supplements.

=== Diabetes ===
Women with Turner syndrome are at a moderately increased risk of developing [[type 1 diabetes]] in childhood and a substantially increased risk of developing [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] by adult years. The risk of developing type 2 diabetes can be substantially reduced by maintaining a healthy weight.

=== Cognitive ===
Turner syndrome does not typically cause [[intellectual disability]] or impair cognition. However, learning difficulties are common among women with Turner syndrome, particularly a specific difficulty in perceiving spatial relationships, such as [[nonverbal learning disorder]]. This may also manifest itself as a difficulty with motor control or with [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/turner-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20360782|title=Turner Syndrome|last=|first=|date=November 18, 2017|website=Mayo Clinic|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; While it is not correctable, in most cases it does not cause difficulty in daily living. Most Turner syndrome patients are employed as adults and lead productive lives.

Also, a rare variety of Turner syndrome, known as "Ring-X Turner syndrome", has about a 60% association with intellectual disability{{Clarify|reason=use of association is non-standard|date=April 2016}}. This variety accounts for around 2–4% of all Turner syndrome cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Berkovitz G, Stamberg J, Plotnick LP, Lanes R | title = Turner syndrome patients with a ring X chromosome | journal = Clinical Genetics | volume = 23 | issue = 6 | pages = 447–53 | date = June 1983 | pmid = 6883789 | doi = 10.1111/j.1399-0004.1983.tb01980.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychological ===
Women with Turner syndrome may experience adverse psychosocial outcomes. Research shows a possible association between age at diagnosis and increased  substance use and depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="pmid29753544"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reimann GE, Bernad Perman MM, Ho PS, Parks RA, Comis LE | title = Psychosocial Characteristics of Women with a Delayed Diagnosis of Turner Syndrome | journal = J.

=== Reproductive ===
Women with Turner syndrome are almost universally [[infertility|infertile]]. While some women with Turner syndrome have successfully become pregnant and carried their pregnancies to term, this is very rare and is generally limited to those women whose karyotypes are not 45,X.&lt;ref name=pmid2185981&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaneko N, Kawagoe S, Hiroi M | title = Turner's syndrome--review of the literature with reference to a successful pregnancy outcome | journal = Gynecologic and Obstetric Investigation | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–7 | year = 1990 | pmid = 2185981 | doi = 10.1159/000293307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid15749515&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Livadas S, Xekouki P, Kafiri G, Voutetakis A, Maniati-Christidi M, Dacou-Voutetakis C | title = Spontaneous pregnancy and birth of a normal female from a woman with Turner syndrome and elevated gonadotropins | journal = Fertility and Sterility | volume = 83 | issue = 3 | pages = 769–72 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15749515 | doi = 10.1016/j.fertnstert.2004.11.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when such pregnancies do occur, there is a higher than average risk of [[miscarriage]] or [[birth defect]]s, including Turner syndrome or Down syndrome.&lt;ref name=pmid508669&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nielsen J, Sillesen I, Hansen KB | title = Fertility in women with Turner's syndrome.

Usually, estrogen replacement therapy is used to spur the growth of secondary sexual characteristics at the time when puberty should onset. While very few women with Turner syndrome menstruate spontaneously, estrogen therapy requires a regular shedding of the uterine lining ("withdrawal bleeding") to prevent its overgrowth. Withdrawal bleeding can be induced monthly, like menstruation, or less often, usually every three months, if the patient desires. Estrogen therapy does not make a woman with nonfunctional ovaries fertile, but it plays an important role in assisted reproduction; the health of the uterus must be maintained with estrogen if an eligible woman with Turner Syndrome wishes to use IVF (using donated [[oocyte]]s).

Especially in mosaic cases of Turner syndrome that contains Y-chromosome (e.g. 45,X/46,XY) due to the risk of development of ovarian malignancy (most common is gonadoblastoma) gonadectomy is recommended.&lt;ref name="In Adulthood" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gravholt CH, Fedder J, Naeraa RW, Müller J | title = Occurrence of gonadoblastoma in females with Turner syndrome and Y chromosome material: a population study | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 85 | issue = 9 | pages = 3199–202 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 10999808 | doi = 10.1210/jcem.85.9.6800 | url = http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jcem.85.9.6800 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner syndrome is characterized by primary [[amenorrhoea]], premature ovarian failure (hypergonadotropic hypogonadism), [[Gonadal dysgenesis|streak gonads]] and infertility (however, technology (especially oocyte donation) provides the opportunity of pregnancy in these patients). Failure to develop secondary sex characteristics (sexual infantilism) is typical.

As more women with Turner syndrome complete pregnancy thanks to modern techniques to treat infertility, it has to be noted that pregnancy may be a risk of cardiovascular complications for the mother. Indeed, several studies had suggested an increased risk for aortic dissection in pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Lin /&gt; The influence of [[estrogen]] has been examined but remains unclear. It seems that the high risk of aortic dissection during pregnancy in women with Turner syndrome may be due to the increased hemodynamic load rather than the high estrogen rate.&lt;ref name=Elsheikh /&gt; Of course, these findings are important and need to be remembered while following a pregnant patient with Turner syndrome.

== Cause ==
Turner syndrome is caused by the absence of one complete or partial copy of the X chromosome in some or all the cells. The abnormal cells may have only one X ([[monosomy]]) (45,X) or they may be affected by one of several types of [[Partial monosomy#Partial aneuploidy|partial monosomy]] like a deletion of the short [[p arm]] of one X chromosome (46,[[cytogenetic notation|X,del(Xp)]]) or the presence of an [[isochromosome]] with two q arms (46,X,i(Xq))&lt;ref name=Crespi2008&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Crespi B | title = Turner syndrome and the evolution of human sexual dimorphism | journal = Evolutionary Applications | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 449–61 | date = August 2008 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1752-4571.2008.00017.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner syndrome has distinct features due to the lack of [[pseudoautosomal region]]s, which are typically spared from X-inactivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sybert VP, McCauley E | title = Turner's syndrome | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 351 | issue = 12 | pages = 1227–38 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15371580 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMra030360 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra030360 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080726095653/http://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra030360 | df =  | deadurl = no | archivedate = 2008-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In mosaic individuals, cells with X monosomy (45,X) may occur along with cells that are normal (46,XX), cells that have partial monosomies, or cells that have a Y chromosome (46,XY).&lt;ref name=Crespi2008 /&gt; The presence of mosaicism is estimated to be relatively common in affected individuals (67–90%).&lt;ref name=Crespi2008 /&gt;

=== Inheritance ===
In the majority of cases where monosomy occurs, the X chromosome comes from the mother.&lt;ref name=Monroy2002&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Monroy N, López M, Cervantes A, García-Cruz D, Zafra G, Canún S, Zenteno JC, Kofman-Alfaro S | title = Microsatellite analysis in Turner syndrome: parental origin of X chromosomes and possible mechanism of formation of abnormal chromosomes | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 107 | issue = 3 | pages = 181–9 | date = January 2002 | pmid = 11807897 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.10113 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be due to a [[nondisjunction]] in the father. [[Meiotic]] errors that lead to the production of X with p arm deletions or abnormal Y chromosomes are also mostly found in the father.&lt;ref name=Uematsu&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uematsu A, Yorifuji T, Muroi J, Kawai M, Mamada M, Kaji M, Yamanaka C, Momoi T, Nakahata T | title = Parental origin of normal X chromosomes in Turner syndrome patients with various karyotypes: implications for the mechanism leading to generation of a 45,X karyotype | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics | volume = 111 | issue = 2 | pages = 134–9 | date = August 2002 | pmid = 12210339 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/ajmg.10506 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isochromosome]] X or [[ring chromosome]] X on the other hand are formed equally often by both parents.&lt;ref name=Uematsu /&gt; Overall, the functional X chromosome usually comes from the mother.

In most cases, Turner syndrome is a sporadic event, and for the parents of an individual with Turner syndrome the risk of recurrence is not increased for subsequent pregnancies. Rare exceptions may include the presence of a balanced [[chromosomal translocation|translocation]] of the X chromosome in a parent, or where the mother has 45,X mosaicism restricted to her germ cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Frías JL, Davenport ML | title = Health supervision for children with Turner syndrome | journal = Pediatrics | volume = 111 | issue = 3 | pages = 692–702 | date = March 2003 | pmid = 12612263 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1542/peds.111.3.692 | author3 = Committee on Genetics Section on Endocrinology }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==

=== Prenatal ===
[[File:45,X.jpg|thumb|right|45,X [[karyotype]], showing an unpaired X at the lower right]]
Turner syndrome may be diagnosed by [[amniocentesis]] or [[chorionic villus sampling]] during pregnancy.

Usually, fetuses with Turner syndrome can be identified by abnormal [[ultrasound]] findings (''i.e.'', heart defect, kidney abnormality, [[cystic hygroma]], [[ascites]]). In a study of 19 European registries, 67.2% of prenatally diagnosed cases of Turner syndrome were detected by abnormalities on ultrasound. 69.1% of cases had one anomaly present, and 30.9% had two or more anomalies.&lt;ref name="turner-syndrom.dk"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loscalzo|first1=Melissa L.|last2=Bondy|first2=Carolyn A.|last3=Biesecker|first3=Barbara|title=Issues in prenatal counseling and diagnosis in Turner Syndrome|journal=International Congress Series|volume=1298|year=2006|pages=26–29|issn=05315131|doi=10.1016/j.ics.2006.07.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increased risk of Turner syndrome may also be indicated by abnormal triple or quadruple maternal serum screen. The fetuses diagnosed through positive maternal serum screening are more often found to have a mosaic karyotype than those diagnosed based on ultrasonographic abnormalities, and
conversely, those with mosaic karyotypes are less likely to have associated ultrasound abnormalities.&lt;ref name="turner-syndrom.dk" /&gt;

=== Postnatal ===
Turner syndrome can be diagnosed postnatally at any age. Often, it is diagnosed at birth due to heart problems, an unusually wide neck or swelling of the hands and feet. However, it is also common for it to go undiagnosed for several years, typically until the girl reaches the age of puberty/adolescence and she fails to develop properly (the changes associated with puberty do not occur). In childhood, a short stature can be indicative of Turner syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/turner_syndrome/page2.htm#tocd|title=Turner Syndrome Symptoms, Treatment, Causes – What are the symptoms for Turner syndrome? - MedicineNet|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218075158/http://www.medicinenet.com/turner_syndrome/page2.htm#tocd|archivedate=2012-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A test called a [[karyotype]], also known as a chromosome analysis, analyzes the chromosomal composition of the individual. This is the test of choice to diagnose Turner syndrome.

== Treatment ==
As a chromosomal condition, there is no cure for Turner syndrome. However, much can be done to minimize the symptoms. For example:&lt;ref name="tss faq 6"&gt;{{cite web |author=Turner Syndrome Society of the United States |title=FAQ 6. What can be done? |url=https://www.turnersyndrome.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=25 |accessdate=2007-05-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529195502/https://www.turnersyndrome.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=25 |archivedate=2012-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Growth hormone]], either alone or with a low dose of [[androgen]], will increase growth and probably final adult height. Growth hormone is approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] for treatment of Turner syndrome and is covered by many insurance plans.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name="tss faq 6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolar K, Hoffman AR, Maneatis T, Lippe B | title = Long-term safety of recombinant human growth hormone in turner syndrome | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 93 | issue = 2 | pages = 344–51 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18000090 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2007-1723 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that this is effective, even in toddlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Davenport ML, Crowe BJ, Travers SH, Rubin K, Ross JL, Fechner PY, Gunther DF, Liu C, Geffner ME, Thrailkill K, Huseman C, Zagar AJ, Quigley CA | title = Growth hormone treatment of early growth failure in toddlers with Turner syndrome: a randomized, controlled, multicenter trial | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 92 | issue = 9 | pages = 3406–16 | date = September 2007 | pmid = 17595258 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2006-2874 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Hormone therapy|Estrogen replacement therapy]] such as the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control pill]], has been used since the condition was described in 1938 to promote development of secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens are crucial for maintaining good bone integrity, cardiovascular health and tissue health.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name="tss faq 6" /&gt; Women with Turner syndrome who do not have spontaneous puberty and who are not treated with estrogen are at high risk for osteoporosis and heart conditions.

* Modern [[reproductive technology|reproductive technologies]] have also been used to help women with Turner syndrome become pregnant if they desire. For example, a donor egg can be used to create an embryo, which is carried by the Turner syndrome woman.&lt;ref name="tss faq 6" /&gt;
* Uterine maturity is positively associated with years of estrogen use, history of spontaneous menarche, and negatively associated with the lack of current hormone replacement therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Uterine Development in Turner Syndrome |journal=GGH Journal |volume=24 |issue=1 |year=2008 |issn=1932-9032 |url=http://gghjournal.com/volume24/1/ab12.cfm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622212224/http://www.gghjournal.com/volume24/1/ab12.cfm |archivedate=2008-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
Turner syndrome occurs in between one in 2000&lt;ref name=ArchDisChild/&gt; and one in 5000 females at birth.&lt;ref name=Mar2013/&gt;

Approximately 99 percent of fetuses with Turner syndrome spontaneously terminate during the first trimester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Urbach A, Benvenisty N | title = Studying early lethality of 45,XO (Turner's syndrome) embryos using human embryonic stem cells | journal = PLOS One | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = e4175 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19137066 | pmc = 2613558 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004175 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4175U }}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner syndrome accounts for about 10 percent of the total number of spontaneous abortions in the United States.&lt;ref name="In Adulthood" /&gt;

== History ==
The syndrome is named after [[Henry Turner (endocrinologist)|Henry Turner]], an [[Endocrinology|endocrinologist]] from Illinois, who described it in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Turner HH | year=1938 | title=A syndrome of [[Infantilism (physiological disorder)|infantilism]], congenital [[webbed neck]], and [[cubitus valgus]] | journal= [[Endocrinology (journal)|Endocrinology]]| volume=23 | issue=5 | pages=566–74 | doi=10.1210/endo-23-5-566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, it is often called Ullrich–Turner syndrome or even Bonnevie–Ullrich–Turner syndrome to acknowledge that earlier cases had also been described by European doctors.

The first published report of a female with a 45,X [[karyotype]] was in 1959 by Dr. Charles Ford and colleagues in [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]] near [[Oxford]], and [[Guy's Hospital]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name="ford 1959"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ford CE, Jones KW, Polani PE, De Almeida JC, Briggs JH | title = A sex-chromosome anomaly in a case of gonadal dysgenesis (Turner's syndrome) | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 7075 | pages = 711–3 | date = April 1959 | pmid = 13642858 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(59)91893-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found in a 14-year-old girl with signs of Turner syndrome.

'''The Very Reverend William Richard Wood Stephens DD, FSA''' was [[Dean of Winchester]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=who&gt;[[Who's Who|“Who was Who”]]1897–1990 London, [[A &amp; C Black]], 1991 {{ISBN|0-7136-3457-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; He was educated at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] and graduated in 1862. [[Ordained]] in 1865, he began his career with a [[Curate|curacy]] in [[Staines]].  In 1866 he became the curate of [[Purley, London|Purley]], [[Berkshire]]. On 31 August 1869 he married Charlotte Jane Hook, the youngest daughter of [[Walter Farquhar Hook]], the [[dean of Chichester]].&lt;ref name=who /&gt;   On the recommendation of the dean of Chichester in 1870, he became [[Vicar]] of [[Mid Lavant]], a [[Lecturer]] at [[Chichester Theological College]] and [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of [[Woolbeding]]&lt;ref&gt;"[[Clergy List|The Clergy List]]" William Clowes and Son,1879&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1895 he was elevated to the [[Deanery]] at Winchester, a post he held until his death.&lt;ref name=who /&gt;

Stephens was known for his philanthropy, spending his own money to have the church at Mid Lavant restored. He provided funds for the rebuilding of the chancel at Woolbeding and contributed to the repairs of the roof at [[Winchester Cathedral]]. He also spent a lot of time showing visitors around the cathedral and explaining its history. In 1895 he was recognised for his interest in history when he was elected [[Society of Antiquaries of London|FSA]].&lt;ref name=who /&gt;

In 1902 Stephens attended a mayoral banquet, in [[Winchester]], where he consumed some [[oyster]]s. Unfortunately the beds, in [[Emsworth]] where the oysters were sourced, had been contaminated with raw sewage.  Consequently, many of the guests, including Stephens, contracted [[Typhoid fever|food poisoning]].&lt;ref name=who /&gt;&lt;ref name=oyster1&gt;{{cite web|title=Emsworth Oysters |publisher=Emsworth Business Association |date=3 February 2016 |url=http://www.emsworth.org.uk/news/emsworths-oysters-video-now-online |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6f14bMVrY |archivedate=3 February 2016 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite paper|last=Bulstrode|first=H.

969508257 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His death in Winchester deanery, on 22 December 1902, about six weeks after the banquet, was attributed to eating Emsworth oysters. He was buried in the graveyard of Winchester Cathedral on 27 December 1902.&lt;ref name=who /&gt;
