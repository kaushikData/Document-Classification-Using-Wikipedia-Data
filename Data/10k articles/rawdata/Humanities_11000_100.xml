'''Australian English''' ('''AuE'''; '''en-AU'''{{efn|&lt;code&gt;en-AU&lt;/code&gt; is the [[language code]] for ''Australian English'', as defined by [[ISO standard]]s (see [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]) and [[Internet standard]]s (see [[IETF language tag]]).}}) is the set of varieties of the [[English language]] native to [[Australia]]. Although English has no official status in the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]], Australian English is the country's national and ''[[de facto]]'' official language as it is the [[Languages of Australia|first language of the majority of the population]].

Australian English began to diverge from [[British English]] after the [[First Fleet|First Settlers]], who set up the [[Colony of New South Wales]], arrived in 1788. By 1820, their speech was recognised as being different from British English. Australian English arose from the intermingling of early settlers, who were from a great variety of [[mutually intelligible]] dialectal regions of the [[British Isles]], and quickly developed into a distinct variety of English&lt;ref name="clas.mq.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/history-accent-change |title=history &amp; accent change &amp;#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6D2TfCOIp?url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/history-accent-change |archive-date=20 December 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; which differs considerably from other varieties of English in vocabulary, [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]], pronunciation, [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]], grammar and spelling.

==History==
The earliest form of Australian English was spoken by the children of the colonists in early [[New South Wales]]. This first generation of native-born children created a new dialect that was to become the language of the nation. The Australian-born children in the new colony were exposed to a wide range of dialects from all over the British Isles, in particular from [[Ireland]] and [[South East England]].&lt;ref name="Moore 2008 69"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Bruce|title=Speaking our Language: the Story of Australian English|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=South Melbourne|isbn=0-19-556577-0|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The native-born children in the colony created the new dialect from the speech they heard around them, and with it expressed [[Peer pressure|peer solidarity]]. Even when new settlers arrived, this new dialect was strong enough to blunt other patterns of speech.

A quarter of the convicts were Irish. Many had been arrested in Ireland, and some in Great Britain. Many, if not most, of the Irish spoke [[Irish language|Irish]] and either no English at all, or spoke it poorly and rarely. There were other significant populations of convicts from non-English speaking parts of Britain, such as the [[Scottish Highlands]], [[Wales]] and parts of [[Cornwall]].

Records from the early 19th century show this distinct dialect in the colonies after the [[First Fleet|first settlement]] in 1788.&lt;ref name="clas.mq.edu.au"/&gt; [[Peter Miller Cunningham]]'s 1827 book ''Two Years in New South Wales'', described the distinctive accent and vocabulary of the native-born colonists, that differed from that of their parents and with a strong London influence.&lt;ref name="Moore 2008 69"/&gt; [[Anthony Burgess]] writes that "Australian English may be thought of as a kind of fossilised Cockney of the Dickensian era."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first=Anthony|title=A Mouthful of Air: Language and Languages, especially English|year=1992|publisher=Hutchinson|location=London|isbn=0091774152&lt;!--page?--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Doudiet Swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Australian gold rushes]] saw many external influences on the language.]]
The first of the [[Australian gold rushes]], in the 1850s, began a large wave of [[Immigration to Australia|immigration]], during which about two per cent of the population of the United Kingdom emigrated to the colonies of [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blainey|first=Geoffrey|title=The Rush that Never Ended: a History of Australian Mining|year=1993|publisher=Melbourne University Press|location=Carlton, Vic.|isbn=0-522-84557-6|edition=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguist Bruce Moore, "the major input of the various sounds that went into constructing the Australian accent was from south-east England".&lt;ref name="Moore 2008 69"/&gt;

Some elements of [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Aboriginal languages]] have been [[List of English words of Australian Aboriginal origin|adopted by Australian English]]—mainly as names for places, flora and fauna (for example [[dingo]]) and local culture. Many such are localised, and do not form part of general Australian use, while others, such as ''kangaroo'', ''boomerang'', ''budgerigar'', ''wallaby'' and so on have become international. Other examples are ''[[cooee]]'' and ''hard yakka''. The former is used as a high-pitched call, for attracting attention, (pronounced {{IPA|/kʉːiː/}}){{fix|text=stress?|date=March 2018}} which travels long distances. ''Cooee'' is also a notional distance: ''if he's within cooee, we'll spot him''. ''Hard yakka'' means ''hard work'' and is derived from ''yakka'', from the [[Turrubal language|Jagera]]/Yagara language once spoken in the Brisbane region.

Also of Aboriginal origin is the word ''bung'', from the Sydney [[pidgin]] English (and ultimately from the Sydney Aboriginal language), meaning "dead", with some extension to "broken" or "useless". Many towns or suburbs of Australia have also been influenced or named after Aboriginal words. The best-known example is the capital, Canberra, named after a local language word meaning "meeting place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canberra Facts and figures|url=http://www.visitcanberra.com.au/Visitor-Info/Facts-and-figures.aspx|accessdate=15 August 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Cxr1nR7h?url=http://www.visitcanberra.com.au/Visitor-Info/Facts-and-figures.aspx|archive-date=16 December 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the changes starting in the 19th century were the introduction of words, spellings, terms and usages from [[North American English]]. The words imported included some later considered to be typically Australian, such as ''bushwhacker'' and ''squatter''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Baker|first=Sidney J.|title=The Australian Language|year=1945|publisher=Angus and Robertson|location=Sydney|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
This American influence continued with the popularity of American films and the influx of American military personnel in [[World War II]]; seen in the enduring persistence of such terms as ''[[okay]]'', ''you guys'' and ''gee''.&lt;ref name="Bell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Philip|last2=Bell|first2=Roger|title=Americanization and Australia|year=1998|publisher=University of New South Wales Press|location=Sydney|isbn=0-86840-784-4|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology and pronunciation==
{{Main|Australian English phonology}}
The primary way in which Australian English is distinctive from other varieties of English is through its unique pronunciation. It shares most similarity with other [[Southern Hemisphere]] accents, in particular [[New Zealand English]].&lt;ref&gt;Trudgill, Peter and Jean Hannah. (2002). ''International English: A Guide to the Varieties of Standard English'', 4th ed. London: Arnold. {{ISBN|0-340-80834-9}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Like most dialects of English it is distinguished primarily by its vowel [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Harrington, J. |author2=F. Cox |author3=Z. Evans |last-author-amp=yes |title=An acoustic phonetic study of broad, general, and cultivated Australian English vowels |journal=Australian Journal of Linguistics |year=1997 |volume=17 |pages=155–84 |doi=10.1080/07268609708599550 |issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vowels ===

[[File:Australian English diphthong chart - part 1.svg|thumb|right|Part 1 of Australian English diphthongs&lt;ref name="coxflet2017" /&gt;]]
[[File:Australian English diphthong chart - part 2.svg|thumb|right|Part 2 of Australian English diphthongs&lt;ref name="coxflet2017" /&gt;]]

The vowels of Australian English can be divided according to length. The long vowels, which include [[monophthong]]s and [[diphthong]]s, mostly correspond to the tense vowels used in analyses of [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) as well as its centring diphthongs. The short vowels, consisting only of monophthongs, correspond to the RP lax vowels.  There exist pairs of long and short vowels with overlapping vowel quality giving Australian English [[vowel length|phonemic length distinction]], which is unusual amongst the various dialects of English, though not unknown elsewhere, such as in regional south-eastern dialects of the UK and eastern seaboard dialects in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Mannell |url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html |title=Australian English - Impressionistic Phonetic Studies |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au|date=14 August 2009|accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110706114743/http://clas.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html| archivedate= 6 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with New Zealand English, the [[weak-vowel merger]] is complete in Australian English: unstressed {{IPA|/ɪ/}} is merged into {{IPA|/ə/}} ([[schwa]]), unless it is followed by a velar consonant.

===Consonants===
There is little variation in the sets of [[consonant]]s used in different English dialects but there are variations in how these consonants are used. Australian English is no exception.

Australian English is [[Rhoticity in English|non-rhotic]]; that is, the {{IPA|/r/}} sound does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant. However, a [[Linking R|linking {{IPA|/r/}}]] can occur when a word that has a final &lt;r&gt; in the spelling comes before another word that starts with a vowel. An [[Linking and intrusive R#Intrusive R|intrusive {{IPA|/r/}}]] may similarly be inserted before a vowel in words that do not have &lt;r&gt; in the spelling in certain environments, namely after the long vowel {{IPA|/oː/}} and after word final {{IPA|/ə/}}. This can be heard in "law-r-and order," where an intrusive R is voiced after the W and before the A.

There is some degree of allophonic variation in the [[alveolar stop]]s. As with North American English, [[Intervocalic alveolar flapping]] is a feature of Australian English: prevocalic {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} surface as the [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}} after [[sonorant]]s other than {{IPA|/m, ŋ/}} as well as at the end of a word or morpheme before any vowel in the same breath group. For many speakers, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} in the combinations {{IPA|/tr/}} and {{IPA|/dr/}}-are also palatalised, thus {{IPA|/tʃr/}} and {{IPA|/dʒr/}}, as Australian {{IPA|/r/}} is only very slightly retroflex, the tip remaining below the level of the bottom teeth{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}&lt;!--Such an articulation could hardly be identified as an /r/ or considered even slightly retroflex.--&gt; in the same position as for {{IPA|/w/}}; it is also somewhat rounded ("to say 'r' the way Australians do you need to say 'w' at the same time"), where older English {{IPA|/wr/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} have fallen together as {{IPA|[rʷ]}}. The [[wine–whine merger]] is complete in Australian English.

[[English consonant-cluster reductions#Yod-dropping|''Yod''-dropping]] occurs after {{IPA|/s/}},  {{IPA|/z/}} and, {{IPA|/θ/}}. Other cases of {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/zj/}}, along with {{IPA|/tj/}} and {{IPA|/dj/}}, have [[English consonant-cluster reductions#Yod-coalescence|coalesced]] to {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, {{IPA|/ʒ/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ/}} and {{IPA|/dʒ/}} respectively for many speakers. {{IPA|/j/}} is generally retained in other [[consonant cluster]]s.

In common with most varieties of [[Scottish English]] and [[American English]], the phoneme {{IPA|/l/}} is pronounced as a "dark" (velarised) L ({{IPA|[ɫ]}}) in all positions, unlike other dialects such as [[Received Pronunciation]] and [[Hiberno-English|Hiberno (Irish) English]], where a light L (i.e., a non-velarised L) is used in many positions.

===Pronunciation===
Differences in stress, weak forms and standard pronunciation of isolated words occur between Australian English and other forms of English, which while noticeable do not impair intelligibility.

The affixes ''-ary'', ''-ery'', ''-ory'', ''-bury'', ''-berry'' and ''-mony'' (seen in words such as ''necessary, mulberry'' and ''matrimony'') can be pronounced either with a full vowel or a schwa. Although some words like ''necessary'' are almost universally pronounced with the full vowel, older generations of Australians are relatively likely to pronounce these affixes with a schwa while younger generations are relatively likely to use a full vowel.

Words ending in unstressed ''-ile'' derived from Latin adjectives ending in ''-ilis'' are pronounced with a full vowel ({{IPA|/ɑel/}}), so that ''fertile'' rhymes with ''fur tile'' rather than ''turtle''.

In addition, miscellaneous pronunciation differences exist when compared with other varieties of English in relation to seemingly random words. For example, as with American English, the vowel in ''yoghurt'' is pronounced as {{IPA|/əʉ/}} ("long 'O'") rather than {{IPA|/ɔ/}} ("short o"); ''vitamin'', ''migraine'' and ''privacy'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/ɑe/}} (as in ''mine'') rather than {{IPA|/ɪ/}}, {{IPA|/iː/}} and {{IPA|/ɪ/}} respectively; ''paedophile'' is pronounced with {{IPA|/e/}} (as in ''red'') rather than {{IPA|/iː/}}; and ''urinal'' is pronounced with [[schwa]] {{IPA|/ə/}} rather than {{IPA|/ɑe/}} ("long i"). As with British English, ''advertisement'' is pronounced with {{IPA|/ɪ/}}; ''tomato'' and ''vase'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/ɐː/}} (as in ''father'') instead of {{IPA|/æɪ/}}; ''zebra'' is pronounced with {{IPA|/e/}} (as in ''red'') rather than {{IPA|/iː/}}; and ''buoy'' is pronounced as {{IPA|/boɪ/}} (as in ''boy'') rather than {{IPA|/ˈbʉːiː/}}. Two examples of miscellaneous pronunciations which contrast with both standard American and British usages are ''data'', which may be pronounced with {{IPA|/ɐː/}} ("dah") instead of {{IPA|/æɪ/}} ("day"); and ''maroon'', pronounced with {{IPA|/əʉ/}} ("own") as opposed to {{IPA|/ʉː/}} ("oon").

{{Main|Variation in Australian English}}

Academic research has shown that the most notable variation within Australian English is largely [[culture|sociocultural]]. This is mostly evident in phonology, which is divided into three sociocultural varieties: ''broad'', ''general'' and ''cultivated''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Robert Mannell |url=http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html |title=Robert Mannell, "Impressionistic Studies of Australian English Phonetics" |publisher=Ling.mq.edu.au |date=14 August 2009 |accessdate=26 July 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081231163640/http://www.ling.mq.edu.au/speech/phonetics/phonetics/ausenglish/impressionistic.html| archivedate=31 December 2008&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A limited range of [[Word usage|word choice]]s is strongly regional in nature. Consequently, the geographical background of individuals can be inferred, if they use words that are peculiar to particular Australian states or territories and, in some cases, even smaller regions.

In addition, some Australians speak [[English-based creole languages|creole languages]] derived from Australian English, such as [[Australian Kriol language|Australian Kriol]], [[Torres Strait Creole]] and [[Norfuk language|Norfuk]].

===Sociocultural===
The ''broad'', ''general'' and ''cultivated'' accents form a continuum that reflects minute variations in the Australian accent. They can reflect the [[social class]], education and urban or rural background of speakers, though such indicators are not always reliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.mq.edu.au/globe/default.aspx?id=244&amp;EditionID=162 Australia's unique and evolving sound] Edition 34, 2007 (23 August 2007) – The Macquarie Globe&lt;/ref&gt; According to linguists, the general Australian variant emerged some time before 1900.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Moore (Australian Oxford Dictionary) and Felicity Cox (Macquarie University) [interviewed in]: ''Sounds of Aus'' (television documentary) 2007; director: David Swann; Writer: Lawrie Zion, Princess Pictures (broadcaster: ABC Television).&lt;/ref&gt; Recent generations have seen a comparatively smaller proportion of the population speaking with the broad variant, along with the near extinction of the cultivated Australian accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Das|first=Sushi|title=Struth! Someone's nicked me Strine|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/Struth-Someones-nicked-me-Strine/2005/01/28/1106850102203.html|newspaper=The Age|date=29 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corderoy|first=Amy|title=It's all English, but vowels ain't voils|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/its-all-english-but-vowels-aint-voils-20100125-mukf.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=26 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The growth and dominance of general Australian accents perhaps reflects its prominence on radio and television during the late 20th century.

[[Australian Aboriginal English]] is made up of a range of forms which developed differently in different parts of Australia, and are said to vary along a continuum, from forms close to Standard Australian English to more non-standard forms. There are distinctive features of accent, grammar, words and meanings, as well as language use.

The ethnocultural dialects are diverse accents in Australian English that are spoken by the [[Minority group|minority]] groups, which are of non-English speaking background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english |title=australian english &amp;#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A massive immigration from Asia has made a large increase in diversity and the will for people to show their cultural identity within the Australian context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/australian-english-defined |title=australian english defined &amp;#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date=25 October 2009 |accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ethnocultural varieties contain features of General Australian English as adopted by the children of immigrants blended with some non-English language features, such as the [[Afro-Asiatic]] and [[Asian languages]].

===Regional variation===
Although Australian English is relatively homogeneous, there are some regional variations. The dialects of English spoken in [[South Australian English|South Australia]], [[Western Australian English|Western Australia]], [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Tasmania]], [[Queensland]] and the [[Torres Strait English|Torres Strait Islands]] differ slightly in vocabulary and phonology.

Most regional differences are in word usage. Swimming clothes are known as ''cossies'' or ''swimmers'' in New South Wales, ''togs'' in Queensland, and ''bathers'' in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-01-05/what-do-you-call-battered-deep-fried-potato-snack-linguistic/7069684|title=Divide over potato cake and scallop, bathers and togs mapped in 2015 Linguistics Roadshow|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|author=Kellie Scott|date=5 January 2016|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; What most of Australia calls a ''stroller'' is usually called a ''pram'' in Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania.&lt;ref name="Pauline Bryant 1985"&gt;Pauline Bryant (1985): Regional variation in the Australian English lexicon, Australian Journal of Linguistics, 5:1, 55-66&lt;/ref&gt; Preference for some synonymous words also differ between states. ''Garbage'' (i.e., garbage bin, garbage truck) dominates over ''rubbish'' in New South Wales and Queensland, while ''rubbish'' is more popular in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and South Australia.&lt;ref name="Pauline Bryant 1985"/&gt; The word ''footy'' generally refers to the most popular [[Football in Australia|football code]] in an area; that is, [[rugby league]] or [[rugby union]] depending on the local area, in most of New South Wales and Queensland, and [[Australian rules football]] elsewhere. Beer glasses are also [[Australian English vocabulary#Alcohol|named differently]] in different states. Distinctive grammatical patterns exist such as the use of the interrogative ''eh'' (also spelled ''ay'' or ''aye''), which is particularly associated with Queensland.

There are some notable regional variations in the pronunciations of certain words. The [[Trap–bath split|trap‑bath split]] is more complete in South Australia, which had a different settlement chronology and type from other parts of the country. This resulted in a British English influence that lasted longer that of the other colonies. Words such as ''dance'', ''advance'', ''plant'', ''graph'', ''example'' and ''answer'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/aː/}} (as in ''father'') far more frequently in South Australia while elsewhere in Australia the older {{IPA|/æ/}} (as in ''mad'') is more common.&lt;ref name="Pauline Bryant 1985"/&gt; [[L-vocalization|''L''-vocalisation]] is also more common in South Australia than other states.  In Western Australian and Queensland English, the vowels in ''near'' and ''square'' are typically realised as centring diphthongs ("nee-ya"), whereas in the other states they may also be realised as monophthongs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clas.mq.edu.au/australian-voices/regional-accents |title=regional accents &amp;#124; Australian Voices |publisher=Clas.mq.edu.au |date= |accessdate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature common in Victorian English is [[English-language vowel changes before historic l#Salary–celery merger|salary–celery merger]], whereby a Victorian pronunciation of ''Ellen'' may sound like ''Alan'' to speakers from other states. There is also regional variation in {{IPA|/uː/}} before {{IPA|/l/}} (as in ''school'' and ''pool'').

==Vocabulary==
===Intrinsic traits===
{{Main|Australian English vocabulary}}
[[File:Banjo Patterson.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bush poets such as [[Banjo Paterson]] captured the Australian vocabulary of the 19th century in their [[bush ballad]]s.]]

Australian English has many words and idioms which are unique to the dialect and have been written on extensively, with the ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'', widely regarded as the national standard, incorporating numerous Australian terms.&lt;ref&gt;"The Macquarie Dictionary", Fourth Edition. The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Internationally well-known examples of Australian terminology include ''[[outback]]'', meaning a remote, sparsely populated area, ''[[the bush]]'', meaning either a native forest or a country area in general, and ''g'day'', a greeting. ''Dinkum'', or ''fair dinkum'' means "true" or "is that true?", among other things, depending on context and inflection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/pubs/ozwords/November_98/index.html Frederick Ludowyk, 1998, "Aussie Words: The Dinkum Oil On Dinkum; Where Does It Come From?" (''0zWords'', Australian National Dictionary Centre)]. Access date: 5 November 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316062047/http://www.anu.edu.au/andc/pubs/ozwords/November_98/index.html |date=16 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The derivative ''dinky-di'' means "true" or devoted: a "dinky-di Aussie" is a "true Australian".

[[Australian performance poetry|Australian poetry]], such as "[[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man from Snowy River]]", as well as [[Australian folk music|folk songs]] such as "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", contain many historical Australian words and phrases that are understood by Australians even though some are not in common usage today.

Australian English, in common with several British English dialects (for example, [[Cockney]], [[Scouse]], [[Glasgow patter|Glaswegian]] and [[Geordie]]), uses the word ''[[Mate (colloquialism)|mate]]''. Many words used by Australians were at one time used in the United Kingdom but have since fallen out of usage or changed in meaning there.

For example, ''creek'' in Australia, as in North America, means a stream or small river, whereas in the UK it means a small watercourse flowing into the sea; ''paddock'' in Australia means field, whereas in the UK it means a small enclosure for livestock; ''bush'' or ''scrub'' in Australia, as in North America, means a wooded area, whereas in England they are commonly used only in proper names (such as [[Shepherd's Bush]] and [[Wormwood Scrubs]]).

[[Litotes]], such as "not bad", "not much" and "you're not wrong", are also used, as are [[diminutive]]s, which are commonly used and are often used to indicate familiarity. Some common examples are ''arvo'' (afternoon), ''barbie'' (barbecue), ''[[smoko]]'' (cigarette break), ''Aussie'' (Australian) and ''pressie'' (present/gift). This may also be done with people's names to create [[nickname]]s (other English speaking countries create [[English diminutive|similar diminutives]]). For example, "Gazza" from Gary, or "Smitty" from John Smith. The use of the suffix ''-o'' originates in Irish Gaelic{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} (Irish ''ó''), which is both a postclitic and a suffix with much the same meaning as in Australian English.

In informal speech, incomplete comparisons are sometimes used, such as "sweet as" (as in "That car is sweet as."). "Full", "fully" or "heaps" may precede a word to act as an intensifier (as in "The waves at the beach were heaps good."). This was more common in regional Australia and South Australia{{When|date=September 2014}} but has been in common usage in urban Australia for decades. The suffix "-ly" is sometimes omitted in broader Australian English. For instance, "really good" can become "real good".

Australia's switch to the [[metric system]] in the 1970s changed most of the country's vocabulary of measurement from [[imperial units|imperial]] to metric measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.measurement.gov.au/measurementsystem/Pages/HistoryofMeasurementinAustralia.aspx |title=History of Measurement in Australia |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |work=web page |publisher=Australian Government National Measurement Institute |accessdate=14 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the switch to metric, heights of individuals are listed in centimetres on official documents such as a driver's licence but older people understand and may speak of feet and inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilks|first1=Kevin|title=Metrication in Australia: A review of the effectiveness of policies and procedures in Australia's conversion to the metric system|date=1992|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|location=Canberra|isbn=0 644 24860 2|page=114|url=http://themetricmaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Metrication-in-Australia-built-2013-06-24.pdf|accessdate=5 August 2017|quote=Measurements used by people in their private lives, in conversation or in estimation of sizes had not noticeably changed nor was such a change even attempted or thought necessary.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison with other varieties===
Where [[American and British English differences|British and American vocabulary differs]], Australians sometimes favour a usage different from both varieties, as with footpath (for US sidewalk, UK pavement), capsicum (for US bell pepper, UK green/red pepper), or doona  (for US [[comforter]], UK [[duvet]]) from a trademarked brand. In other instances, it either shares a term with American English, as with [[truck]] (UK: lorry) or [[eggplant]] (UK: aubergine), or with British English, as with [[mobile phone]] (US: cell phone) or [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]] (US: hood).

A non-exhaustive selection of common British English terms not commonly used in Australian English include (Australian usage in brackets): artic/articulated lorry ([[semi-trailer]]); aubergine ([[eggplant]]); bank holiday ([[public holiday]]); bedsit (one-bedroom [[apartment]]); bin lorry ([[garbage truck]]); cagoule ([[raincoat]]); candy floss ([[cotton candy|fairy floss]]); cash machine (automatic teller machine/[[Automated teller machine|ATM]]); child-minder ([[babysitter]]); chivvy (nag); clingfilm (glad wrap/[[plastic wrap|cling wrap]]); cooker ([[stove]]); courgette ([[zucchini]]); skive ([[truancy|wag]]); dungarees ([[overalls]]); dustbin ([[waste container|garbage/rubbish bin]]); dustcart ([[garbage truck|garbage/rubbish truck]]); duvet ([[duvet|doona]]); elastoplast/plaster ([[adhesive bandage|band-aid]]); estate car ([[station wagon]]); fairy cake ([[cupcake]]/patty cake); free phone ([[toll-free telephone number|toll-free]]); football ([[soccer]]); full fat milk (full-cream milk); [[goose bumps]] (goose pimples); high street ([[main street]]); hoover (''v'' - to [[vacuum cleaner|vacuum]]); horsebox (horse float); ice lolly ([[ice block]]/icy pole); kitchen roll ([[paper towel]]); lorry ([[truck]]); marrow ([[cucurbita|squash]]); nettled (irritated); off-licence ([[liquor store|bottle shop]]); pavement ([[sidewalk|footpath]]); potato crisps ([[potato chips]]); red/green pepper ([[capsicum]]); pilchard ([[sardine]]); pillar box ([[post box]]); plimsoll ([[plimsoll shoe|sandshoe]]); pushchair (pram/[[stroller]]); saloon car (sedan); snog (''v'' - [[kiss]]); swan (''v'' - to go somewhere in an ostentatious way); sweets ([[candy|lollies]]); tangerine ([[mandarin orange|mandarin]]); utility room ([[laundry room|laundry]]); Wellington boots ([[wellington boot|gumboots]]).

A non-exhaustive list of American English terms not commonly found in Australian English include: acclimate (acclimatise); aluminum ([[aluminium]]); bangs (fringe); bell pepper ([[capsicum]]); bellhop (hotel porter); broil ([[Grilling|grill]]); burglarize (burgle); busboy (included under the broader term of [[waiter]]); [[candy]] (lollies); cell phone ([[mobile phone]]); cilantro ([[coriander]]); comforter ([[duvet|doona]]); counter-clockwise (anticlockwise); diaper (nappy); downtown ([[central business district|CBD]]); drywall (plasterboard); emergency brake (handbrake); faucet (tap); [[flashlight]] (torch); frosting (icing); gasoline ([[petroleum|petrol]]); golden raisin ([[sultana (grape)|sultana]]); hood (bonnet); jell-o (jelly); jelly (jam); math (maths); nightstand (bedside table); pacifier (dummy); period (full stop); [[parking lot]] (car park); popsicle ([[ice block]]/icy pole); railway ties (sleepers); rear view mirror (rear vision mirror); row house ([[terraced house|terrace house]]); [[scallion]] (spring onion); silverware/flatware ([[cutlery]]); stickshift (manual transmission); streetcar ([[tram]]); takeout (takeaway); trash can ([[waste container|garbage/rubbish bin]]); trunk (boot); turn signal (indicator/blinker); vacation (holiday); upscale/downscale (upmarket/downmarket); [[windshield]] (windscreen).

Terms shared by British and American English but not so commonly found in Australian English include: abroad (overseas); [[cooler]]/ice box ([[Esky]]); [[flip-flops]] (thongs); [[pickup truck]] ([[Ute (vehicle)|ute]]); [[wildfire]] (bushfire).

Australian English is particularly divergent from other varieties with respect to geographical terminology, due to the country's unique geography. This is particularly true when comparing with British English, due to that country's dramatically different geography. British geographical terms not in common use in Australia include: coppice (cleared bushland); dell (valley); fen (swamp); heath (shrubland); meadow (grassy plain); moor (swampland); spinney (shrubland); stream (creek); woods (bush) and village (even the smallest settlements in Australia are called ''towns'' or ''stations'').

In addition, a number of words in Australian English have different meanings from those ascribed in other varieties of English. Clothing-related examples are notable. ''Pants'' in Australian English follows American usage in refer to British English ''trousers'' but in British English refer to Australian English ''underpants''; ''vest'' in Australian English pass also in American refers to British English ''waistcoat'' but in British English refers to Australian English ''singlet''; ''thong'' in both American and British English refers to underwear (otherwise known as a [[G-string]]), while in Australian English it refers to British and American English ''flip-flop'' (footwear). There are numerous other examples, including ''[[biscuit]]'' which refers in Australian and British English to what in American English is ''cookie'' or ''cracker'' but to a savoury cake in American English; ''Asian'', which in Australian and American English commonly refers to people of [[East Asia]]n heritage, as opposed to British English, in which it commonly refers to people of [[South Asia]]n descent; and ''(potato) chips'' which refers both to British English ''crisps'' (which is not commonly used in Australian English) and to American English ''French fries'' (which is used alongside ''hot chips'').

In addition to the large number of uniquely Australian idioms in common use, there are instances of idioms taking differing forms in the various Anglophone nations, for example ''home away from home'', ''take with a grain of salt'' and ''wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole'' (which in British English take the respective forms ''home from home'', ''take with a pinch of salt'' and ''wouldn't touch with a barge pole''), or ''a drop in the ocean'' and ''touch wood'' (which in American English take the forms ''a drop in the bucket'' and ''knock on wood'').

==Grammar==
As with American English, but unlike British English, collective nouns are almost always singular in construction, e.g., ''the government was unable to decide'' as opposed to ''the government were unable to decide''. ''Shan't'', the use of ''should'' as in ''I should be happy if ...'', the use of ''haven't any'' instead of ''haven't got any'' and the use of ''don't let's'' in place of ''let's not'', common in upper-register British English, are almost never encountered in Australian (or North American) English. ''River'' generally follows the name of the river in question as in North America, i.e., ''Darling River'', rather than the British convention of coming before the name, e.g., ''River Thames''. In South Australia however, the British convention applies—for example, the ''River Murray'' or the ''River Torrens''. As with American English, ''on the weekend'' and ''studied medicine'' are used rather than the British ''at the weekend'' and ''read medicine''. Similarly, ''around'' is more commonly used in constructions such as ''running around'', ''stomping around'' or ''messing around'' in contrast with the British convention of using ''about''.

In common with British English, the past tense and past participles of the verbs ''learn'', ''spell'' and ''smell'' are often irregular (''learnt'', ''spelt'', ''smelt''). Similarly, in Australian usage, the ''to'' in ''I'll write to you'' is retained, as opposed to US usage where it may be dropped. While prepositions before days may be omitted in American English, i.e., ''She resigned Thursday'', they are retained in Australian English, as in British English: ''She resigned on Thursday''. Ranges of dates use ''to'', i.e., ''Monday to Friday'', as with British English, rather than ''Monday through Friday'' in American English. When saying or writing out numbers, ''and'' is inserted before the tens and units, i.e., ''one hundred and sixty-two'', as with British practice. However Australians, like Americans, are more likely to pronounce numbers such as 1,200 as ''twelve hundred'', rather than ''one thousand two hundred''.

==Spelling and style==&lt;!-- [[Australian spelling]] redirects here--&gt;
As in most English-speaking countries, there is no official governmental regulator or overseer of correct spelling and grammar. The ''[[Macquarie Dictionary]]'' is used by some [[University|universities]] and some other organisations as a standard for Australian English spelling. The ''Style Manual: For Authors, Editors and Printers'', the ''Cambridge Guide to Australian English Usage'' and the ''Australian Guide to Legal Citation'' are prominent style guides.

Australian spelling is closer to [[American and British English spelling differences|British]] than [[American and British English spelling differences|American spelling]]. As with British spelling, the ''u'' is retained in words such as ''colour'', ''honour'', ''labour'' and ''favour''.  While the Macquarie Dictionary lists the ''-our'' ending and follows it with the ''-or'' ending as an acceptable variant, the latter is rarely found in actual use today. Australian print media, including digital media, today strongly favour ''-our'' endings. A notable exception to this rule is the [[Australian Labor Party]], which adopted the American spelling in 1912 as a result of ''-or'' spellings' comparative popularity at that time. Consistent with British spellings, ''-re'', rather than ''-er'', is the only listed variant in Australian dictionaries in words such as ''theatre'', ''centre'' and ''manoeuvre''. Unlike British English, which is split between ''-ise'' and ''-ize'' in words such as ''organise'' and ''realise'', with ''-ize'' favoured by the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] and ''-ise'' listed as a variant, ''-ize'' is rare in Australian English and designated as a variant by the Macquarie Dictionary. ''Ae'' and ''oe'' are often maintained in words such as ''manoeuvre'', ''paedophilia'' and ''foetus'' (excepting those listed below); however, the Macquarie dictionary lists forms with ''e'' (e.g., pedophilia, fetus) as acceptable variants and notes a tendency within Australian English towards using only ''e''. Individual words where the preferred spelling is listed by the Macquarie Dictionary as being different from the British spellings include "program" (in all contexts) as opposed to "programme", "inquire" and derivatives "inquired", "inquiry", etc. as opposed to "enquire" and derivatives, "analog" (as opposed to digital) as opposed to "analogue", "livable" as opposed to "liveable", "guerilla" as opposed to "guerrilla", "yoghurt" as opposed to "yogurt", "verandah" as opposed to "veranda", "burqa" as opposed to "burka", "pastie" (food) as opposed to "pasty".&lt;ref name="Fourth Edition 2005"&gt;"The Macquarie Dictionary", Fourth Edition.  The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="macquariedictionary.com.au"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macquariedictionary.com.au |title=Macquarie Dictionary |publisher=Macquarie Dictionary |date= |accessdate=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com&lt;/ref&gt; Unspaced prepositions such as "onto", "anytime", "alright" and "anymore" are also listed as being equally as acceptable as their spaced counterparts.&lt;ref name="Fourth Edition 2005"&gt;"The Macquarie Dictionary", Fourth Edition.  The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="macquariedictionary.com.au"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"/&gt;

Different spellings have existed throughout Australia's history. A pamphlet entitled ''The So-Called "American Spelling"'', published in Sydney some time in the 19th century, argued that "there is no valid etymological reason for the preservation of the ''u'' in such words as ''honor'', ''labor'', etc."&lt;ref name = "ljnijo"&gt;''The So Called "American Spelling." Its Consistency Examined.'' pre-1901 pamphlet, Sydney, E. J. Forbes. Quoted by Annie Potts in [http://www.bikwil.com/Vintage19/Webster's-Dictionary.html this article]&lt;/ref&gt; The pamphlet also claimed that "the tendency of people in Australasia is to excise the u, and one of the Sydney morning papers habitually does this, while the other generally follows the older form." What are today regarded as American spellings were popular in Australia throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the Victorian Department of Education endorsing them into the 1970s and ''[[The Age]]'' newspaper until the 1990s. This influence can be seen in the spelling of the [[Australian Labor Party]] and also in some place names such as [[Victor Harbor, South Australia|Victor Harbor]]. The ''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'' has been attributed with re-establishing the dominance of the British spellings in the 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paradisec.org.au/blog/2008/01/webster-in-australia/ |title=Endangered Languages and Cultures » Blog Archive » Webster in Australia |publisher=Paradisec.org.au |date=2008-01-30 |accessdate=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a short time during the late 20th century, [[Harry Lindgren]]'s 1969 spelling reform proposal ([[SR1|''Spelling Reform 1'' or ''SR1'']]) gained some support in Australia: in 1975, the [[Australian Teachers' Federation]] adopted SR1 as a policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.englishspellingsociety.org/journals/j2/jimmieson.php|title=Spelling Reform 1 - And Nothing Else!|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120730222013/http://www.englishspellingsociety.org/journals/j2/jimmieson.php|archivedate=July 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; SR1 calls for the short {{IPA|/e/}} sound (as in ''bet'') to be spelt with E (for example ''friend→frend, head→hed'').

Both [[Quotation mark|single and double quotation marks]] are in use (with double quotation marks being far more common in print media), with [[Logical punctuation|logical (as opposed to typesetter's) punctuation]]. Spaced and unspaced em-dashes remain in mainstream use, as with American and Canadian English. The DD/MM/YYYY [[Calendar date|date format]] is followed and the 12-hour clock is generally used in everyday life (as opposed to service, police, and airline applications).

==Computer keyboards==

There are [[British and American keyboards|two major English language keyboard layouts]], the United States layout and the United Kingdom layout. Australia universally uses the United States keyboard layout, which lacks pound sterling, Euro currency and [[negation]] symbols. Punctuation symbols are also placed differently from British keyboards.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Capital, Volume III''''', subtitled ''The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole'', is the third volume of ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]''. It was prepared by [[Friedrich Engels]] from notes left by [[Karl Marx]] and published in 1894. 

==Contents==
Volume III is in seven parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capital, Volume 3|isbn=0-7178-0490-9|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|publisher=International Publishers Co, Inc.|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The conversion of Surplus Value into Profit and the rate of Surplus Value into the rate of Profit
# Conversion of Profit into Average Profit
# The Law of the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall]]
# Conversion of Commodity Capital and Money Capital into Commercial Capital and Money-Dealing Capital (Merchant's Capital)
# Division of Profit Into Interest and Profit of Enterprise, Interest Bearing Capital.
# Transformation of Surplus-Profit into [[economic rent|Ground Rent]].
# Revenues and Their Sources

The work is best known today for part 3, which in summary says that as the organic fixed capital requirements of production rise as a result of advancements in production generally, the [[rate of profit]] tends to fall. This result, which orthodox Marxists believe is a principal contradictory characteristic leading to an inevitable collapse of the capitalist order,&lt;ref&gt;"At any rate, it is but a requirement of the capitalist mode of production that the number of wage-workers should increase absolutely, in spite of its relative decrease. Labour-power becomes redundant for it as soon as it is no longer necessary to employ it for 12 to 15 hours a daily. A development of productive forces which would diminish the absolute number of labourers, i.e. enable the entire nation to accomplish its total production in a shorter time span, would cause a revolution, because it would put the bulk of the population out of the running. This is another manifestation of the specific barrier of capitalist production, showing also that capitalist production is by no means an absolute form for the development of the productive forces and for the creation of wealth, but rather that at a certain point it comes into collision with this development. This collision appears partly in its [[Late 2000s recession|periodical crises]], which arise from the circumstances that now this and now that portion of the labouring population becomes redundant under its old mode of employment. The limit of capitalist production is the excess time of the labourers. The absolute spare time gained by society does not concern it. The development of productivity concerns it only in so far as it increases the surplus labour-time of the working class, not because it decreases the labour time for material production in general. It moves thus in a contradiction. " Ch. XV ''Exposition of the Internal Contradictions of the Law'', &amp;sect; IV Supplementary Remarks. p 263 Institute of Marxism Leninism, Moscow translation. The reference to hours worked per day reflects [[full employment]] norms [[eight-hour day|of the 19th century]].&lt;/ref&gt; was held by Marx and Engels to, as a result of  various contradictions in the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], result in [[Crisis (Marxian)|crises]] whose resolution necessitates the emergence of an entirely new [[mode of production]] as the culmination of the same historical dialectic that led to the emergence of [[capitalism]] from [[feudalism|prior forms]].&lt;ref&gt;"... This transformation stems from the development of the productive forces under capitalist production, and from the ways and means by which this development takes place." Ch. XV ''Exposition of the Internal Contradictions of the Law'', &amp;sect; IV Supplementary Remarks. p 264 &amp;para; 2 Institute of Marxism Leninism, Moscow translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 3 is subtitled "The process of capitalist production as a whole" and is concerned primarily with the internal differentiation of the capitalist class. The first three parts are concerned with the division of surplus value amongst individual capitals, where it takes the form of profit. The following parts are concerned with merchants' capital, interest-bearing capital and landed capital. The last part draws the whole account together. The aim of the volume as a whole is to 'locate and describe the concrete forms which grow out of the movements of capital as a whole...The various forms of capital,
as evolved in this book, thus approach step by step the form which they assume on the surface of society, in the action of different capitals on one another in competition, and in the ordinary consciousness of the agents of production themselves." (25) (Clarke).{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

As an [[education reform]], the broad goal of '''class size reduction''' (CSR) is to increase the number of individualized student-teacher interactions intended to improve student learning. A reform long holding theoretical attraction to many constituencies,&lt;ref&gt;Hattie, J. (2005, August), What is the nature of evidence that makes a difference to learning? Keynote address presented at the 2005 Research Conference, Lumina Grand Hyatt Hotel, Melbourne, 7–9 August 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; some have claimed CSR as the most studied educational reform of the last century.&lt;ref name="Biddle, B. J. 2002"&gt;Biddle, B. J. &amp; Berliner, D. C. (2002) Research synthesis: small class size and its effects, ''Educational Leadership, 59''(5), 12–23.&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, interpretations of these studies have often been contentious. Some educational groups like the [[American Federation of Teachers]] and [[National Education Association]] are in favor of reducing class sizes. Others argue that class size reduction has little effect on student achievement. Many are concerned about the costs of reducing class sizes.&lt;ref name="Hanushek 1999"&gt;[[Eric Hanushek]] (1999) [http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/evidence-class-size “The Evidence on Class Size,”]  in ''Earning and learning: How schools matter'', edited by Susan E. Mayer and Paul E. Peterson (Washington, DC: Brookings Institution): 131-168&lt;/ref&gt;

The two most prominent CSR studies are Project STAR, which was conducted in the mid- to late-80s in Tennessee and Project SAGE, conducted in the early 2000s in Wisconsin. Studies following the work of Project STAR and SAGE found that, even when reintroduced to larger class-sizes later in their educational career, the positive foundation for learning caused students to later in life to be more likely to take advanced classes, graduate from high school, attend college, and major in a [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] field.&lt;ref name="Biddle, B. J. 2002" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Subsequent research on the effects of class size reduction has linked small class sizes with a variety of cognitive and non-cognitive benefits for students and teachers, both short and long-term, especially when class sizes are reduced in the early grades (K-3). Its benefits are particularly pronounced for lower-income students and children of color, who experience two to three times the gains from smaller classes, leading CSR to be one of only a few education reforms proven to reduce the achievement gap. Smaller classes have also been found to have a positive impact on school climate, student socio-emotional growth, safety and suspension rates, parent engagement, and teacher attrition, especially in schools  with large numbers of disadvantaged children.

==  Definition of class size ==

An early complication in measuring the efficacy of class size reduction was the tendency for different [[Ideology|ideological]] camps to use different definitions of ''class size'' in the literature. As a direct measure of the number of students in each class, ''group size'' is currently understood by the educational community to be the best measure of a teacher's "true opportunity to build direct relationships with each student." A more malleable definition and one now held in dubious regard,&lt;ref name="Graue, M. E. 2007"&gt;Graue, M. E., Hatch, K., Rao, K., &amp; Oen, D. (2007). The wisdom of class size reduction. ''American Educational Research Journal, 44''(3), 670-700.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pupil-teacher ratios|pupil to teacher ratio]],'' would declare a situation in which one teacher leads a class while another does paperwork in the back but does not interact with students as being half as large as its group size.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrenberg, R. G., Brewer, D. J., Gamoran, A., &amp; Willms, J. D. (2001). Class size and student
achievement. ''Psychological Science and the Public Interest, 2''(1), 1-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, depending on which measure was used, researchers tended toward far different interpretations of the benefits of class size reduction leading to far different recommendations for implementation. In 2002, [[Margaret Spellings]], secretary of education under President [[George W. Bush]], pointed out the need for a standardized definition of what is meant by class size.

To differentiate student-teacher ratio and class size, it is important to know several key distinctions. Class size, generally speaking, refers to the average class size in a given grade level of a given school. Student-teacher ratios, normally, are calculated by taking the total number of teachers at a given school divided by the complete enrollment of that school. This distinction is significant, because the ratio will not always match up with the class size figure (or vice versa). For example, a student-teacher ratio may be small but a class size may be larger than what the student-teacher ratio leads one to believe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greatschools.org/find-a-school/defining-your-ideal/174-class-size.gs?page=all&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Project STAR and Project SAGE ==

=== Project STAR ===

Aware of both the preliminary results of a CSR program in [[Indiana]] called Project Prime Time and the potential large scale costs of additional classrooms and teachers, in 1985, under then Governor [[Lamar Alexander]], Tennessee began a three-phase project to determine the effects of reduced class sizes on short and long term pupil performance in the earliest grades.

The first phase, termed Project STAR (Student-Teacher Achievement Ratio),&lt;ref&gt;Mosteller, F. (1995). The Tennessee study of class size in the early school grades. The Future of Children, 5, 113-127.&lt;/ref&gt; randomly assigned teachers and students to three groups, “small” (13 to 17), “regular” (22 to 25) classes with a paid aide, and “regular” (22 to 25) classes with no aide. In total some 6,500 students in about 330 classrooms at approximately 80 schools participated.

Using both standardized and [[curriculum]] based testing, the initial study concluded that small classes produced “substantial improvement in early learning and cognitive studies” with the effect about double for [[Minority group|minority]] students. As this is considered the seminal study (in an area that has received much political attention) there have been many attempts to reinterpret the data.

Dubbed the Lasting Benefits Study, the second phase began in 1989 and sought to determine whether the benefits of CSR persisted into upper grades when all students entered standard size classes. Observations confirmed that children originally enrolled in smaller classes continued to outperform their peers when they returned to regular-sized classrooms.  These results were deemed true for all types of classes and all types of cities (rural, suburban, and metropolitan).

Under the third phase, Project Challenge, the 17 economically poorest [[school district]]s were adequately funded to provide smaller class sizes for their K-3 students. These districts improved their end-of-year- standing (among 139 districts) in [[mathematics]] and reading from below average to above average.

[[Eric Hanushek|Dr. Eric Hanushek]] has called into question the validity of the study on Project STAR, arguing that the bulk of scientific research on small-class sizes shows no or statistically insignificant effects and that there must be another explanation, like flawed random assignment, that produced the result rather than small class size.&lt;ref&gt;http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/some-findings-independent-investigation-tennessee-star-experiment-and-other&lt;/ref&gt; However, subsequent research has disproven Hanushek's claim that "there is no strong or consistent relationship between school inputs and student performance".&lt;ref&gt;Hanushek, E. A. (1997). ‘Assessing the effects of school resources on student performance: an update’, Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, vol. 19(2), pp. 141–64.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan Krueger|Dr. Alan Krueger]] reanalyzed the data on which Hanushek based this claim and found that Hanushek "places a disproportionate share of weight on a small number of studies that frequently used small samples and estimated misspecified models." When this is corrected, the literature actually reveals a strong correlation between reduced class size and academic performance and suggests that the [[internal rate of return]] from reducing class size from 22 to 15 students is around 6 percent.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It should be noted that, in more recent years, Hanushek has defended his work in his book "Money Might Matter Somewhere", in which he argues that the amount of money spent per pupil is not as important a factor towards student achievement inasmuch as how the money is spent.&lt;ref&gt;Hanushek, Eric (May 1994). [http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/money-might-matter-somewhere-response-hedges-laine-and-greenwald "Money Might Matter Somewhere: A Response to Hedges, Laine, and Greenwald"]. ''Hoover Institution''. Retrieved November 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, Hanushek argues that giving a student $10,000 worth of pens and pencils would not impact their overall student achievement as much as, say, a $10,000 investment into training and development for that student's teacher.

=== Project SAGE ===

In 2002 the state of Wisconsin began its own investigations into “the wisdom of class size reduction," &lt;ref&gt;Graue, E., Hatch, K., Rao, K. &amp; Oen, D. (2007). The wisdom of class-size reduction.''American Educational Research Journal, 44''(3), 670-700.&lt;/ref&gt; by initiating Project SAGE (Student Achievement Guarantee in Education). In all, nine low income schools were studied, their locations spanning urban, semi-urban, and rural geographies. Evaluation included site visits, standardized assessments, collection of curriculum, and interviews with teachers, principals, and students.

The guiding assumptions of the study were:

(1) Class size implementation alone is insufficient to promote [[student achievement]]. Changes in teaching methods that take full advantage of smaller class sizes will also be needed.

(2) Class size reduction may have unintended consequences.

(3) [[Generalization]] requires careful adaptation. Every classroom has a unique and specific context.

One primary difficulty encountered by the SAGE project was the availability of funds for teachers but not space. Each district was then left to this potential problem in their own unique way. In schools constrained by space this often involved tag-team teaching rather than increased [[individualized instruction]] (lowering of PTR but not class size).

Results from the study demonstrated increased teacher [[Job satisfaction|satisfaction with job]], increased [[communication]] with parents, and (as with Project STAR) long term increases in student [[graduation]] rates and admission into [[college]]. Although no significant differences were observed in the gains of both male and female students, improved outcomes were again larger amongst minority and disadvantaged students.

== Other CSR Studies ==

=== Project PRIME TIME ===
Project PRIME TIME was proposed in 1981 by former Indiana Governor [[Robert D. Orr]]. The intent was to upgrade the quality of early school experiences by reducing class sizes. The Indiana General Assembly appropriated $300,000 for the 1981–82 and 1982-82 school years to pilot PRIME TIME in nine schools, grades K-3, across Indiana. In 1983, the General Assembly increased PRIME TIME's funding for 1983-84 and 1984-85 to $2 million. This increased funding allowed for PRIME TIME's expansion in first grade. The program was expanded to second grade in 1985 and by the fall of 1987, it covered kindergarten through third grade.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Weis, Trish. 1990. "Indiana's PRIME TIME." ''Contemporary Education'' 62.1(Fall 1990): 31. http://search.proquest.com/openview/76c3b5ee2ab61ebc355f76e210ee95ce/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&lt;/ref&gt;

Results from the study showed:&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
# PRIME TIME students made improvements in reading and math [[standardized test]]s in kindergarten, first and second grades.  
# Students in PRIME TIME classes had fewer behavioral issues, better self-esteem and responsibility, greater time on task, and were less likely to be held back a grade. 
# Teachers of smaller class sizes reported themselves as more productive and efficient, had improved morale and better communication with parents, and were able to increase individualized attention to students.

=== Benefits in the UK ===

In a British study{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}, students were closely observed by teams of researchers who recorded their “moment to moment” behaviors in blocks of 10-second intervals. The researchers found that adding five students to a class decreased the odds of students’ being on task by nearly a quarter. In classes of 30, low-attaining students were nearly twice as likely to be disengaged as they were in classes of 15.

Contrary to some class-size studies conducted in the United States, the British researchers found no “threshold effect” in their study. In other words, classes did not have to be reduced to 15 or 20 students before the behavioral benefits started to kick in. Reducing class size at any end of the class-size spectrum seemed to help.

=== California K-3 CSR Program ===
The [[California]] K–3 CSR Program was established in 1996 to improve education, especially in reading and mathematics, by reducing class sizes in kindergarten through grade three. The K–3 CSR Program&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Bohrnstedt and Stecher (1999). [https://www.rand.org/pubs/periodicals/rand-review/issues/rr-fall-99/crowd.html "Crowding Out: Small Classes Teach a Lesson in Unintended Consequences"]. ''RAND Corporation''. Retrieved November 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; provided funds to public and charter schools that reduced their class sizes to 20 pupils per certified teacher, rewarding each school with $850 per student that was in one of these smaller classes. As a result, the program was consuming 6% of the state's general education budget by 2001 and had, thus far, cost a total of $22 billion.

There has been a lot of controversy surrounding the program, with some critics arguing it had disappointing or null results.&lt;ref name="Graue, E. 2007"&gt;Graue, E., Hatch, K., Rao, K. &amp; Oen, D. (2007). The wisdom of class-size reduction. ''American Educational Research Journal, 44''(3), 670-700.&lt;/ref&gt; Because nearly all elementary schools in the state reduced class size at once, especially in grades K-2, it was difficult for researchers to find a control group with which to compare outcomes. The state exam was also new, making it difficult to compare achievement gains to past trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classsizematters.org/fact-sheets-on-the-benefits-of-class-size/the-evidence-from-california/|title=The Evidence from California|date=2013-06-12|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some researchers have noted that the program lacked adequate funding to be properly implemented.&lt;ref name="Graue, E. 2007" /&gt; One serious drawback of this program is that it was much tougher for schools in lower-income communities to benefit as they were already struggling to retain high-quality teachers and maintain a sufficient quantity of classrooms. Thus, schools in higher-income communities, that already had average class sizes around 20 students, most benefited from this program—increasing inequality within the education system.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Despite these limitations and concerns, controlled studies of the effects of California's CSR program showed significant achievement gains from smaller classes,&lt;ref&gt;Harold Urman, “The Effects of Class Size Reduction on Students’ Achievement, English Proficiency Designation, Retention in Grade, and Attendance,” Vital Research, July 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penny Fidler, "The Impact of Class Size Reduction on Student Achievement," Los Angeles Unified School District, Publication No. 109, September 7, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Penny Fidler. "The Relationship Between Teacher Instructional Techniques and Characteristics and Student Achievement in Reduced Size Classes," Los Angeles Unified School District, Publication No. 120, March 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; even among third graders who were only in the program for one year.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Stecher and George Borhnstedt eds., “Class Size Reduction in California: Findings from 1999–00 and 2000–01,” 2002, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers found, for example, that students who were in reduced classes in grades K-3 had slightly higher scores on [[National Assessment of Educational Progress|NAEP]] math exams in 4th grade than students from larger classes.&lt;ref&gt;Fatih Unlu, “California Class Size Reduction Reform: New Findings from the NAEP,” Princeton University, Nov. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant result of this program was that class sizes, across the state, were, on average, reduced.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some other significant effects of the program were that teacher quality had decreased and the use of [[Multi-age classroom|combination classes]] had increased. Teacher quality worsened because schools had to dig deeper down in the barrel to find teachers, who were typically less educated and less experienced. The percent of teachers not fully certified, yet teaching, in high-poverty schools increased from 6% in 1995 to 20% by 2001 and 1% to 6% in low-poverty schools.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; As to why achievement gains were greater for high-poverty minority students, the Coleman Report has a lot to say.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;Egalite, Anna (Spring 2016). [http://educationnext.org/how-family-background-influences-student-achievement/ "How Family Background Influences Student Achievement"]. ''Education Next''. Retrieved November 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The [[James Samuel Coleman|Coleman]] Report ===
The Coleman Report, published in 1966, concluded quite controversially that, in essence, family background matters significantly more to a student's academic achievement than any resources a school can offer.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The exact factors defining "family background" that this report focused on were "parents' educational attainment, parents' income, parents’ criminal history, and family structure". The report goes on to explain that it is equally important, if not more so, for public policy to focus on improving resources of the family rather than those of the school. This could suggest that policies attempting to reduce class size might not have as significant effects on a student's educational achievement as would a policy that reduces a student's level of poverty.

== Effects of CSR ==

Research on the effects of class size reduction has linked small class sizes with a variety of cognitive and non-cognitive benefits for students and teachers, both short and long-term, especially when class sizes are reduced in the early grades. In fact, class size reduction is one of only a handful of K12 reforms cited by the Institute of Education Sciences (2003) as proven to increase student achievement through rigorous evidence.

Reducing class size is among an even smaller number of education reforms that have been shown to narrow the achievement gap.  Its benefits are particularly pronounced for lower-income students and children of color, who experience two to three times the gains from smaller classes.

Smaller classes have also been found to have a positive impact on school climate, student socio-emotional growth, safety and suspension rates, parent engagement, and teacher attrition, especially in schools with large numbers of disadvantaged children.

=== Academic Achievement ===
* In a meta-analysis by Glass and Smith (1978),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.classsizematters.org/meta-analysis-of-research-on-class-size-and-achievement/|title=Meta-Analysis of Research on Class Size and Achievement|date=2016-09-13|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; small class sizes (20 students or less) were associated with improved academic performance. Effects were strongest in the early primary grades and among low-income students. 
* For a study commissioned by the US Department of Education, McLaughlin et al (2000)&lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, Donald, Gili Drori, and Michael Ross. 2000. “School-level Correlates of Academic Achievement: Student Assessment Scores in SASS Public Schools.” ''U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics.'' Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the performance of students in over 2500 schools on state exams adjusted for difficulty via their scores on the NAEP (national) exams.  The analysis showed that after controlling for student background, the only factor positively correlated with student test scores was class size. In this study, student achievement was even more strongly linked to smaller classes in the upper than the lower grades. 
* A literature review by Wilson (2002)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Wilson, Valerie. 2002. ''Does Small Really Make a Difference?'' University of Glasgow: The Scottish Council for Research in Education.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that results from the Tennessee STAR study, a large-scale randomized experiment in grades K-3, showed that grade retention was lower for students in small classes: 17% of students from small classes were held back, compared with 30% and 44% respectively from ‘regular’ and ‘regular plus aide’ classes. Also, fewer students that had been in smaller classes in the early grade had dropped out of school by tenth grade. 
* Using data from the Tennessee STAR study, Krueger (2003)&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;Krueger, Alan B. 2003. “Economic Considerations and Class Size.” ''The Economic Journal'' 113 (February): F34-F63.&lt;/ref&gt;  demonstrated that smaller class sizes in grades K-3 led to significant gains in test scores, and that the economic benefits from higher achievement alone would be expected to yield twice the cost of reducing class size.
* Finn et al (2005)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Finn, Jeremy D. and Susan B. Gerber and Jayne Boyd-Zaharias. '''2005. “'''Small Classes in the Early Grades, Academic Achievement, and Graduating from High School,'''”''' ''Journal of Educational Psychology''.&lt;/ref&gt; found that four years of a small class in K–3 improved the odds of graduating from high school by about 80%. 
* [[Susan Dynarski|Dynarski]] et al (2013)&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Dynarski, Susan, Joshua Hyman, and Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach. 2013. “Experimental Evidence on the Effect of Childhood Investments on Postsecondary Attainment and Degree Completion.” Journal of Policy Analysis and Management 32(4): 692-717.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that smaller classes significantly increased the probability of a student attending college, earning a college diploma, and earning degrees in a STEM field (science, technology, engineering, or mathematics).  
* A review by Zyngier (2014) of the research literature showed that smaller classes had a strong positive impact on student achievement and narrowing the achievement gap in the vast majority of studies. The benefits of smaller class size outweighed the cost in all but three of the 112 peer-reviewed studies.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Zyngier, David. 2014. “Class size and academic results, with a focus on children from culturally, linguistically and economically disenfranchised communities.” ''Evidence Base'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achievement Gaps ===
* Based on STAR data, Krueger and Whitmore (2002)&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Krueger, Alan B., &amp; Whitmore, D. M. 2002. "Would Smaller Classes Help Close the Black-White Achievement Gap?"  ''Bridging the Achievement Gap.'' Brookings Institution Press. 
&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that if all students were assigned to a small class in grades K-3 for one to four years, the black-white test-score gap would drop by 38 percent in grades K-3 and by 15 percent thereafter.  They also estimated that national trends in pupil-teacher ratios for black and white students between 1971 and 1999 accounted for nearly all of the narrowing of the black-white test score gap over that period, as measured by the NAEP exam. In addition, they concluded that smaller classes in grades K-3 would lead to a narrowing of the black-white gap in taking college entrance exams by 60%, and would shrink the gap in scores on these exams.
* Dee (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Dee, Thomas S.  2004. “Teachers, Race, and Student Achievement in a Randomized Experiment.” ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'' 86(1): 195-210.&lt;/ref&gt; looked at the effects of student-teacher racial mismatch on academic achievement in small classes. He found that while racial mismatch of teacher and student had negative effects on academic achievement in regular sized classes, this effect was absent in small classes. 
* Finn et al (2005)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; concluded that three years or more of small classes in the early grades increased the odds of graduating from high school of low-SES students by about 67%.  Four years of small classes in the early grades more than doubled the odds.  The graduation rates for low-income students with three or more years in a small class were at least as high as those of higher income students, closing the income gap. 
* Konstantopoulos and Chung (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Konstantopoulos, Spyros and Vicki Chung. 2009. “What are the Long-term Effects of Small Classes on the Achievement Gap? Evidence from the Lasting Benefits Study.” ''American Journal of Education'' 116: 125-154.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that while all types of students benefit in later grades from being in small classes in early grades, low achievers benefited more, especially in reading and science.
* In a study examining the effect of a variety of inputs on student achievement in majority Latina/o schools, Heilig et al (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Heilig, Julian Vasquez, Amy Williams, and Su Jin Jez. 2010. “Inputs and Student Achievement: An Analysis of Latina/o-Serving Urban Elementary Schools.”  ''Association of Mexican American Educators Journal'' 48-58.&lt;/ref&gt; found that the reduction in student-teacher ratios was the largest predictor of increases in student achievement.  
* After analyzing Social Security data, Wilde et al (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Wilde E.T., J. Finn, G. Johnson, P. Muennig.  2011. “The effect of class size in grades K-3 on adult earnings, employment, and disability status: evidence from a multi-center randomized controlled trial.” ''Journal of Health Care for the Poor and Underserved'' 22(4):1424-35.&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that Black students who were randomly assigned to a small class size in the early grades had significantly higher employment rates and earnings as adults.
* Yongyun Shin (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Shin, Yongyun. 2012. “Do Black Children Benefit More from Small Classes? Multivariate Instrumental Variable Estimators with Ignorable Missing Data.” ''Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics, 37(4).''&lt;/ref&gt; found that for Black students, reduced class size in grades K-3 led to significantly higher academic achievement in reading, math, listening, and word recognition skills.
* Achilles (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Achilles, Charles M. 2012. ''Class-size Policy: The Star Experiment and Related Class-size Studies.'' National Council of Professors of Educational Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that poor, minority, and male students received especially large benefits from reduced class size in terms of improved test scores, school engagement, and lower grade retention and dropout rates.
* [[Susan Dynarski|Dynarski]] et al (2013)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; investigated the effects of small class sizes on postsecondary attainment and degree completion and estimated that assignment to small classes increased the probability of attending college by 2.7 percentage points, with effects more than twice as large among blacks. Among students with the lowest probability of attending college, the increase in college attendance was 11 percentage points. 
* Schanzenbach (2014)&lt;ref&gt;''Schanzenbach,'' Diane W'''.'''  2014. ''Does Class Size Matter?'' National Education Policy Center and University of Colorado Boulder.  Boulder, CO.&lt;/ref&gt; summarized the benefits of class size reduction and its efficacy in narrowing the achievement gap in a report for the National Education Policy Center (NEPC).  She concluded that significant savings would be produced from higher graduation rates and increased employment, particularly among low-income and minority groups.
* Zyngier’s meta-analysis (2014)&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; revealed that of 112 peer-reviewed studies, the overwhelming majority found that smaller classes helped to narrow the achievement gap.
* Mathis (2016)&lt;ref&gt;Mathis, William J. 2016. ''The Effectiveness of Class Size Reduction.'' National Education Policy Center and University of Colorado Boulder. Boulder, CO.&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the positive effects of class size reduction are twice as large for poor and minority students, in a literature review for the National Education Policy Center (NEPC) report.

=== Safety, Attendance and Disciplinary Issues ===
*  Wilson (2002)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; analyzed Tennessee STAR data, showing that there were lower suspension rates in later grades among students who had been in small classes in the early years. Tenth grade students who had been in small classes in K-3 were suspended on average 0.32 days, compared with 0.62 and 0.77 days for students in ‘regular’ and ‘regular plus aide’ classes respectively. Similarly, school attendance was significantly higher for tenth graders who had been assigned to small classes in the early years (16 days per year of absence compared to 23 and 24 for ‘regular’ and ‘regular plus aide’ classes). 
* Krueger and Whitmore (2002)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; found that the teen birth rate was one third lower for white girls if they had been assigned to smaller classes in the early grades, and the teen fatherhood rate for black teenage males was 40% lower.
* In a review of the literature, Finn et al (2003)&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Finn, Jeremy D., Gina M. Pannozzo, and Charles M. Achilles. 2003. “The Why’s of Small Class Size: Student Behavior in Small Classes.” ''Journal of Educational Psychology'' 97(2): 214-223&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed 11 separate class size studies, and nearly all showed a positive impact of smaller classes on students' learning behavior, including  decreases in anti-social behavior (i.e., withdrawing from interactions with the teacher or other students and/or engaging in disruptive acts) and increases in pro-social behavior (i.e., following rules and interacting positively with the teacher as well as collaborating with other children). In one class size study in North Carolina, disciplinary referrals decreased sharply in the two years after small classes were implemented, with a 26% drop in the first year and a 50% drop in the second year.

=== School Climate and Non-Cognitive or Socio-Emotional Factors ===
*  Finn et al (2003)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; analyzed the relationship between class size and learning behavior, social behavior, and teaching styles, showing a positive relationship between reduced class size and outcomes in all three areas. Reduced class size was linked with increased academic engagement, student effort, initiative taking in the classroom and time on task. Additionally, teachers of small classes were able to get to know each student more intimately and their tolerance for a broader range of student behaviors was increased. 
* Babcock and Betts (2009)&lt;ref&gt;Babcock, Philip and Julian R. Betts. 2009. “Reduced-class distinctions: Effort, ability, and the education production function.” ''Journal of Urban Economics'' 65: 314-322.&lt;/ref&gt; investigated the mechanism through which smaller classes boost academic achievement and found that small class sizes better enabled teachers to engage “low-effort” students, as defined by a below average tendency to begin work promptly, behave appropriately in class, exhibit self-discipline, and follow directions. 
* Bascia (2010)&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Bascia, Nina. 2010. ''Reducing Class Size: What Do We Know?'' Canadian Education Association. Toronto, ON.&lt;/ref&gt; summarized the impacts of class size reduction, noting that teachers were able to interact with individual students more frequently and use a greater variety of instructional and differentiated strategies. Students were more engaged and less disruptive in the classroom. 
* In an analysis of national longitudinal data of eighth graders, Dee and West (2011)&lt;ref&gt;Dee, Thomas S. and Martin R. West. 2011. “The Non-Cognitive Returns to Class Size.” ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis'' 33(1): 23-46.&lt;/ref&gt; found that reductions in class size were associated with improvements in non-cognitive skills related to psychological engagement with school, more positive reactions to teachers, peers, and academics in general, higher levels of interest and motivation, lower levels of boredom and anxiety, and a greater sense of belonging. Students in small classes were more likely to look forward to class, believe that the subject was useful for their future, and were less afraid to ask questions.

=== Parent Engagement ===
* Bohrnstedt and Stecher (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Bohrnstedt, George W. and Brian M. Stecher. 1999. ''Class Size Reduction in California 1996-1998: Early Findings Signal Promise and Concerns.'' CSR Research Consortium.&lt;/ref&gt; found that parents of students in reduced size classes had more contact with teachers and were more satisfied with their children’s education. 74% of parents reported initiating contact with their children’s teachers, compared with 69% of parents in non-reduced classes. Parents who had children in smaller classes also gave higher ratings to every aspect of their schooling.
* Bascia (2010)&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; summarized a study conducted by the University of Alberta. After interviewing parents, researchers found that they were encouraged by being able to meet with teachers more frequently. The report also cited evidence from a study of Ontario’s class size reduction initiative showing that many parents reported a better relationship with teachers when their children were assigned to a smaller class.

=== Teacher Attrition ===
* According to a NY City Council survey (2004)&lt;ref&gt;NYC Council Investigation Division. 2004. ''Report on Teacher Attrition and Retention'''''.'''&lt;/ref&gt; of public school teachers, nearly ''a third (30%) of new teachers (1-5 years of experience) in NYC said that it was unlikely that they would be teaching in a NYC school in the next three years.  For those teachers who were thinking of leaving NYC public schools, the top three changes in their work conditions most likely to persuade them to stay included a new contract with higher pay, smaller classes, and better student discipline.''
* [[Susanna Loeb|Loeb]] et al (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Loeb, Susanna, Linda Darling-Hammond, and John Luczak. 2005. “How Teaching Conditions Predict Teacher Turnover in California Schools.” ''Peabody Journal of Education'' 80(3):44-70.&lt;/ref&gt; examined data from teacher surveys and school-level data to determine the relationship between occupational conditions and teacher turnover. They found that the presence of very large classes significantly increased teacher turnover.
* A report from the Pennsylvania State Education Association (2008)&lt;ref&gt;Pennsylvania State Education Association. 2008. ''Class Size Reduction: PSEA Promising Practices to Close Student Achievement Gaps.''&lt;/ref&gt; noted that smaller classes improved teacher morale, which translates into higher rates of teacher attendance, reduced costs for substitute teachers and less teacher attrition.
* Pas Isenberg (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Pas Isenberg, Emily. 2010. “The Effect of Class Size on Teacher Attrition: Evidence from Class Size Reduction Policies in New York State.” ''U.S. Bureau of the Census Center for Economic Studies''. Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; found that a decrease in class size from 23 to 20 students in New York State under a district-wide policy decreased the probability that a teacher would leave the school by 4.2 percentage points.
* Ingersoll (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Ingersoll, Richard M. 2015. “Why Schools Have Difficulty Staffing Their Classrooms with Qualified Teachers.” ''Consortium for Policy Research in Education.''&lt;/ref&gt; noted that job dissatisfaction is the leading factor behind teacher turnover, with 54% of teachers who leave their school reporting that large class sizes contributed to their decision.

== Teacher training ==

Smaller classes provide opportunities for teachers to engage in practices that improve student achievement. However, some researchers worry whether teachers will take full advantage of these opportunities, arguing that they tend to use the same strategies (primarily lecturing) with both large and small groups.&lt;ref&gt;Cahen, L. S., Filby, N., McCutcheon, G., &amp; Kyle, D. W. (1983). ''Class size and instruction: A''
field study.'' New York: Longman.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rice, J. K. (1999). The impact of class size on instructional strategies and the use of time in high school mathematics and science courses. ''Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, 21''(2), 399-414.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slavin, R. (1989). ''Achievement effects of substantial reductions to class size.'' In R. Slavin (Ed.),
School and classroom organization (pp. 247-257). Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stasz, C., &amp; Stecher, B. M. (2002). Before and after class size reduction. In J. D. Finn &amp; M. C. Wang (Eds.), ''Taking small classes one step further'' (pp. 19-50). Greenwich, CT: Information Age Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; This concern has led some to advocate for teacher training to unlock the full potential of reduced class sizes.&lt;ref name="Graue, E. 2007" /&gt;

Though teacher training may improve CSR outcomes, research has demonstrated the benefits of CSR even without any instructional changes. A book reviewing evidence and perspectives on class size from around the world concludes that "Project STAR produced gains without any changes in the curriculum or any focused teacher training. Small classes in and of themselves produced benefits," as was also the case in Wisconsin and California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=N9wRDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT182&amp;dq=But+Project+STAR+produced+gains+without+any+changes+in+the+curriculum+or+any+focused+teacher+training#v=onepage&amp;q=But%2520Project%2520STAR%2520produced%2520gains%2520without%2520any%2520changes%2520in%2520the%2520curriculum%2520or%2520any%2520focused%2520teacher%2520training&amp;f=false|title=Class Size: Eastern and Western perspectives|last=Blatchford|first=Peter|last2=Chan|first2=Kam Wing|last3=Galton|first3=Maurice|last4=Lai|first4=Kwok Chan|last5=Lee|first5=John Chi Kin|date=2016-04-28|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317643470|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economics of smaller classrooms ==

Given the current uncertainty of national [[financial market]]s, some commentators have encouraged [[policymaker]]s to consider whether implementing or broadening class-size-reduction policies is feasible in a time of major budget cuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/National%20Highlights%20Report.pdf |title=Quality Counts |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, teacher magazine polls show that greater than 70% of current teachers cite large class sizes as one of their primary barriers to both job satisfaction and their ability to teach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edweek.org/tsb/section/news/2008/09/10/01polls.h02.html |title=Teacher Magazine: Reader Polls |publisher=Edweek.org |date=2008-09-10 |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led proponents of class size reduction argue that CSR is in fact highly cost effective. They note that low teacher retention rates lead to higher retraining costs and contribute to the current lack of qualified teachers. When faced with a constant flux of new teachers, student achievement has also been shown to suffer.

Students who go on to finish their education also bring more value to their communities causing some [[economist]]s to suggest that smaller class sizes may pay for themselves internally,&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, A.B. (2003). ‘Economic considerations and class size’, ''Economic Journal, 113''(F34–63).&lt;/ref&gt;  although other [[economist]]s question this.[http://hanushek.stanford.edu/publications/failure-input-based-schooling-policies] An analysis of the Tennessee STAR study demonstrated that the economic benefits from higher achievement alone would be expected to yield twice the cost of reducing class size.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; A meta-analysis of CSR literature revealed that the benefits of smaller class size outweighed the cost in all but three of the 112 peer-reviewed studies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; However, one prominent study&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;Chetty et. al (March 2011). [http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/star_paper.pdf "How Does Your Kindergarten Classroom Affect Your Earnings?"] (PDF). ''http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/assets/documents/star_paper.pdf''. Retrieved November 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; looking at the program's effect on long-term average wage earnings of students who participated in STAR by linking the data from the experiment to IRS tax records 26 years later disagrees. One of the main findings of this study&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; was that class size does not have a significant effect on earnings by age 27. However, it should be noted that the authors themselves do not consider their evidence to be conclusive and should thus be discounted. One valid finding, though, was that students who had teachers with greater education training and work experience were more likely to achieve higher earnings later in life. Additional findings were that students who were put into smaller classes were more likely to graduate high school and to, later, attend college.

The '''Committees on Arms Export Controls''' (formerly the '''Quadripartite Committee''') is the name for the concurrent meeting of four [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|select committees]], comprising the [[Business and Enterprise Select Committee]], the [[Defence Select Committee]], the [[Foreign Affairs Select Committee]], and the [[International Development Select Committee]].

The remit of the committee is to examine the Government's expenditure, administration and policy on strategic exports (licensing of [[Arms industry|arms exports]] and other controlled goods).

In 2015 to 2016 the committee did not meet for over 9 months after the chairman Sir [[John Stanley (Tonbridge and Malling MP)|John Stanley]] retired as an MP, because of a long delay in appointing new members.  [[Chris White (politician)|Chris White]] was elected chair in February 2016.&lt;ref name=independent-20160310&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/saudi-arabia-use-of-british-weapons-in-yemen-to-be-investigated-by-parliamentary-commission-a6922906.html |title=Saudi Arabia's use of British weapons in Yemen to be investigated by Parliamentary commission |author=Cahal Milmo |newspaper=The Independent |date=10 March 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/other-committees/committee-on-arms-export-controls/news-parliament-2015/chair-elected-15-16/ |title=Chris White MP elected as Chair |publisher=UK Parliament |work=House of Commons |date=10 February 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016 an inquiry into the use of UK-manufactured weapons [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen|in Yemen]] was launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/other-committees/committee-on-arms-export-controls/news-parliament-2015/uk-arms-yemen-launch-15-16/ |title=Use of UK-manufactured arms in Yemen inquiry launched |publisher=UK Parliament |work=House of Commons |date=10 March 2016 |accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''double duty dollar''' was used in the United States from the early 1900s through the early 1960s, to express the notion that dollars spent with businesses that hired [[African American]]s "simultaneously purchased a commodity and advanced the race". Where that concept applied, it was believed that retailers who excluded African Americans as employees should be shunned. 

The slogan was popularized by journalist [[Gordon Blaine Hancock]].&lt;ref&gt;Gavins, Raymond. "Gordon Blaine Hancock: A Black Profile from the New South." ''Journal of Negro History'' 59.3 (1974): 207-227. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716763 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous ministers and  activists such as [[Booker T. Washington]] and [[Marcus Garvey]] urged their communities to redirect their dollars from retailers and services who refused to hire African Americans to those who did hire them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=double duty dollar|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22double+duty+dollar%22&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C5&amp;as_sdtp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=selective patronage|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22selective+patronage%22&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though the [[Swadeshi movement]] had much broader goals, in the 1920s [[Mohandas Gandhi]] of India urged his countrymen to avoid funding their own subjugation by buying items from the British which they could produce and trade independently, such as cloth and clothing. In the 1940s and 1950s, Leon Sullivan applied the broader phrase [[Leon Sullivan#Selective Patronage Movement|"'selective patronage"]] to denote consumers' choice of retailers as a tool a) to influence businesses toward having more fair and just interactions with African Americans, and b) to build demand for African-American businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Mark Silverman, "Ethnic solidarity and black business." ''American Journal of Economics and Sociology'' 58.4 (1999): 829-841.&lt;/ref&gt;

While African-American efforts continue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn=1610390245 | title=Our Black Year}}&lt;/ref&gt; the strategy has also been applied by others for different, but similar reasons. Among their goals are 
*to create economic incentives for [[gay-friendly]] suppliers; 
*to decrease [[food miles]]; 
*to reduce the [[Agriculture in Concert with the Environment|environmental impact of agriculture]] and make it more [[Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education|sustainable]]; 
*to make [[Deep Economy|local economies deeper]], etc.  The ''double duty dollar'' concept is part of a broad spectrum of [[consumer activism]] or [[ethical consumerism]] strategies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5194">The '''Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive Project''' is a collaborative project that aims to create a digital registry of ethnographic field video for use by instructors and scholars. It is a collection of digitized, unedited videos which represent ethnographic research and its corresponding scholarly documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EVIA Digital Archive|url=http://www.eviada.org/default.cfm||website=EVIA Digital Archive Project|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collections gathered by EVIA Project include a diverse range of traditions from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collections|url=http://www.eviada.org/mainCat.cfm?mc=7|website=EVIA Digital Archive Project|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The EVIA Digital Archive Project's central purpose is to create a repository of ethnographic video and a framework of tools and systems to support librarians, archivists, and scholars in ethnographic instruction. EVIA Project specifically focuses on topics such as anthropology, dance ethnology ethnomusicology, and folklore. The primary mission of EVIA Project is preserving ethnographic videos that were created by scholars while conducting their research. The secondary goal is to make the content generated by the project available with descriptive annotations, and ultimately, creating a distinct database for scholars, instructors, and students to refer to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Overview|url=http://www.eviada.org/subCat.cfm?mc=8&amp;ctID=32|website=EVIA Digital Archive|publisher=The Trustees of Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Funding for the Ethnographic Video for Instruction and Analysis (EVIA) Digital Archive Project began in 2001 by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and further included contributions from Indiana University and University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EVIA Digital Archive Project|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~libarchm/index.php/projects/evia-digital-archive.html|website=Indiana University Bloomington}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally conceived as the “Ethnomusicological Video for Instruction and Analysis Digital Archive”, but moved toward a broader ethnographic center that altered the meaning of its acronym.

In 2001, the first formal efforts of Digital Archive Project surfaced as their initial planning phases began. Team members which included ethnomusicologists, intellectual property specialists, and digital and video technologists from Indiana University, the University of Michigan, Harvard University, and Ohio State University were all involved in planning workshops trying to resolve issues such as geographic coverage, technical challenges, and ethical issues surrounding the EVIA Project. At the end of the year, team members presented their proposal for the project to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and succeeded in receiving funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planning Phase (2001-2002)|url=http://www.eviada.org/element.cfm?mc=8&amp;ctID=21&amp;eID=97|website=EVIA Digital Archive|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, EVIA Project began working on moving away from their dependence on Mellon Foundation and move more toward a model of sustainability to generate income and financial support from users and institutions, as well as, acquire supplementary income from additional grants and subscription fees from individuals and institutions. Currently, EVIA Project’s work focuses on establishing markets for its products and services and developing efficient means to serve clientele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainability Phase (2009-Present)|url=http://www.eviada.org/element.cfm?mc=8&amp;ctID=21&amp;eID=100|website=EVIA Digital Archive|publisher=The Trustees of Indiana University|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The archive==
EVIA Project utilizes both physical and digital storage systems. EVIA Project operates out of the Archives of Traditional Music at Indiana University, one of the oldest and largest university-based ethnographic sound archives in the United States. Physical tapes, whether they are a Digital Betacam preservation master or original copies, are maintained in a temperature and humidity-controlled vault of the Archives of Traditional Music.

Digital files, whether they are the original recordings or preservation transfers from the original, are stored in Indiana University's Mass Data Storage System (MDSS). They are governed as a partnership between the Archives of Traditional Music, The EVIA Project, and the Digital Library Program at Indiana University. Any metadata gathered about the recordings as part of the EVIA deposition undertakings are maintained in a FEDORA archive generated by EVIA Project and maintained as part of the Digital Library Program at Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archival Storage|url=http://www.eviada.org/element.cfm?mc=8&amp;ctID=33&amp;eID=121|website=EVIA Digital Archive|publisher=The Trustees of Indiana University|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''False cognates''' are pairs of words that seem to be [[cognate]]s because of similar sounds and meaning, but have different etymologies; they can be within the same [[language]] or from different languages.{{sfnp|Moss|1992|p=?}} For example, the English word ''dog'' and the [[Mbabaram]] word ''dog'' have exactly the same meaning, [[Mbabaram language#Word for "dog"|but by complete coincidence]]. This is different from [[false friend]]s, which are similar-sounding words with different meanings, but which may in fact be etymologically related. (For example: Spanish ''dependiente'' looks like ''dependent'', but means sales assistant or clerk as well.)

Even though false cognates lack a common root, there may still be an indirect connection between them (for example by [[phono-semantic matching]] or [[folk etymology]]).

==Phenomenon==
The term "false cognate" is sometimes misused to refer to [[false friend]]s, but the two phenomena are distinct.{{sfnp|Moss|1992|p=?}}{{sfnp|Chamizo-Domínguez|2008|p=166}} False friends occur when two words in different languages or dialects look similar, but have different meanings. While some false friends are also false cognates, many are genuine cognates (see [[false friend#Causes|False friends § Causes]]).{{sfnp|Chamizo-Domínguez|2008|p=166}}  For example, English ''pretend'' and French ''prétendre'' are false friends, but not false cognates, as they have the same origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pretend |title=Pretend |work=The Online Etymological Dictionary |last=Harper |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Harper |accessdate=2015-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13998">'''Girl studies''', also known as '''girlhood studies''', is an interdisciplinary academic field of study that is focused on [[girl]]hood and girls' culture that combines advocacy and the direct perspectives and thoughts of girls themselves.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Kirk, Jackie, Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh. “Welcome to this inaugural issue of Girlhood Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal (GHS).” ''Girlhood Studies'', vol. 1, no. 1, 2008. 
&lt;/ref&gt;  The field officially emerged in the 1990s after decades of falling under the broader field of women’s studies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kearney|first=Mary Celeste|year=2009|title=Coalescing: The Development of Girls' Studies|url=|journal=NWSA|volume=21|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars within girl studies examine social and cultural elements of girlhood and move away from an adult-centered focus.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Driscoll, Catherine. “Girls Today: Girls, Girl Culture and Girl Studies.” ''Girlhood Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal,'' vol. 1, no. 1, 2008. 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Those working in the field of girl studies have studied it primarily in relation to other fields that include sociology, psychology, education, history, literary studies, media studies, and communication studies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Girl studies seeks to work directly with girls themselves in order to analyze their lives and understand the large societal forces at play within them.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Scholars in girl studies also explore the connection the field has to [[women's studies]], [[boyhood]] studies, and masculinity studies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History and development ==
Girl studies officially became a field in the 1990s, after the increase in conversation about getting more girls into science, math, and technology fields in the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Girlhood and the Politics of Place|last=Mitchell|first=Claudia|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2016|isbn=|editor-last=Mitchell|editor-first=Claudia|location=|pages=|chapter=Charting Girlhood Studies|editor-last2=Rentschler|editor-first2=Carrie|editor-link2=Carrie Rentschler}}&lt;/ref&gt; though scholars and researchers were studying girls prior to this decade. In the 1970s, some feminist scholars brought to attention the unbalanced focus of boyhood in comparison to girlhood in youth research. Angela McRobbie, Meda Chesney-Lind, and Christine Griffin were some of the few scholars studying and critiquing the lack of study on girlhood and girl culture in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  In the early 1990s, the [[Harvard]] Project on Women's Psychology and Girls' Development conducted a study on the social development of relationships of girls. This study found that when they approach adolescence, girls begin to hide their honest feelings and desires from those they are in close relationships with, making it hard for them to express their feelings later in life. In 1992, the [[American Association of University Women]] (AAUW) published ''How Schools Shortchange Girls,'' "the first national survey to assert a link between girls' psychosocial experience and schooling".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Benjamin, Beth Cooper and Ward, Janie Victoria. “Women, Girls, and the Unfinished Work of Connection: A Critical Review of American Girls’ Studies.” ''All about the Girl: Culture, Power, and Identity'', edited by Anita Harris, Psychology Press, 2004, pp. 15-27.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Girl studies emerged in the 1990s, a time when there was an increased interest from the media and fashion and beauty industries in young women. Advertisers and retailers marketed towards girls by "promising female youth agency and social value" from purchasing the products.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the academy, there was an increase in feminist and gender studies scholars focusing on intersectionality and subsequently on girls.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In 2008, scholars Claudia Mitchell, Jacqueline Reid-Walsh, and [[Jackie Kirk]] established and launched ''[[Girlhood Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal]]'' after recognizing the emerging interest in the field at the 2001 "A New Girl Order: Young Women and the Future of Feminist Inquiry" conference at [[King's College London]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As girl studies develops, "there has been significant movement away from studying girls as future women and toward analyzing girls as members of a unique demographic group", especially in psychology, history, and sociology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There is also a movement towards focusing more on [[intersectionality]] and the experiences of girls across the world.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a 2016 article, Claudia Mitchell acknowledges the presence of girlhood studies in Africa, referencing a South African video project called ''Vikea Abantwana (Protect The Children: A Story about Incest)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctt14jxn16.10|title=Girlhood and the Politics of Place|date=2016|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=9780857456021|pages=87–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video chronicles the life of Philendelini, a young girl who was raped by her father. Mitchell mentions this film to highlight the necessity of girlhood studies; in the film, Philendelini confides in several adult women about her assault and is ignored or turned down in each instance.

On the topic of insuring an intersectional and transnational approach in girl studies, scholar Oneka LaBennett commented “Black schoolgirls and college students have engaged in protests across the globe. Girls themselves have drawn attention to the negative impact of things like white beauty standards, the intersections of racial and gender violence, the problems with police brutality and the school-to-prison pipeline."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Meet-the-Scholars-Building-a/239716|title=Meet the Scholars Building a Network Around Black Girlhood|date=2017-04-06|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Black Girlhood Studies ==
Black Girlhood Studies has developed in recent years to combat the white washed field of Girls' studies. Black girlhood studies is understood as a site of Black feminist inquiry with aims of centering the coming into knowing Black girls’ experience and representations of Black girlhood. In ''Black Girlhood Celebration: Toward a Hip-hop Feminist'' Ruth Nicole Brown states that Black girlhood are, “the representations, memories, and lived experiences of being and becoming in a body marked as youthful, Black, and female.”&lt;ref name="Brown, Ruth Nicole 2008"&gt;Brown, Ruth Nicole. Black Girlhood Celebration: Toward a Hip-Hop Feminist Pedagogy. First printing edition. New York: Peter Lang Inc., International Academic Publishers, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  For Brown, Black girlhood is a powerful concept that enables Black girls to create sacred spaces for themselves and each other even while structural forces work “to posit [Black girls] as the very “risky” problem, an aberration of normal.”&lt;ref name="Brown, Ruth Nicole 2008"/&gt;  Brown’s sentiments were echoed again during the 2016 “Black Girl Movement: A National Conference”, a three-day conference at Columbia University in New York City that focused on Black girls, cis, queer, and trans girls, in the United States. The purpose of the conference was to recognize that while Black girls are “among the most significant cultural producers, community connectors, and trendsetters”, Black girls still remain highly invisible and “are in crisis.”&lt;ref&gt;“Black Girl Movement Conference | IRAAS Institute for Research in African-American Studies.” Accessed December 7, 2017. http://iraas.columbia.edu/Event/black-girl-movement-conference.&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholars  have used this moment to theorize liberating projects for Black girls and Black girlhood, a site of both theoretical and practical analysis. Founded by LaKisha Simmons, Renee Sentilles, and Corinne Field, [https://historyofblackgirlhood.org/ History of Black Girlhood: An Academic Network] provides a forum for scholars centering Black girlhood to share work and collaborate. While many of the work in Black Girlhood Studies is contemporary, there are Black feminist canonical texts that hone in on the ways in which Black girlhood has always already been present in the work of Black women ([[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]] by Toni Morrison, [[For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf|For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow is Enuf]] by Ntozake Shange, [[The Bluest Eye]] by Toni Morrison, [[Bone Black|Bone Black: Memories of Girlhood]] by bell hooks, among many others). These materials span literature, film, poetry, policy, magazine articles, and so on.

Many of the texts foundational to the contemporary field of Black girlhood studies fall within an ethnographic tradition. These works include Elizabeth Chin’s ''Purchasing Power: Black Kids and American Consumer Culture'' (2001), Ruth Nicole Brown’s ''Black Girlhood Celebration: Toward a Hip-hop Feminist Pedagogy'' (2009) Oneka LaBennett’s S''he’s Mad Real: Popular Culture and West Indian Girls in Brooklyn'' (2011), and Aimee Meredith Cox’s ''Shapeshifters: Black Girls and the Choreography of Citizenship'' (2015). These texts examine Black girls’ complex racialized, gendered, and age-based cultural realities as they navigate and resist multiple forms of violences. These [[Ethnography|ethnographies]] are rooted in a Black feminist epistemological emphasis on centering lived experiences.

Historians Abosede George ''Making Modern Girls: A history of girlhood, labor, and social development in 20th century colonial Lagos'' (2015), Marcia Chatelain ''South Side Girls: Growing Up in the Great Migration'' (2015), LaKisha Simmons ''Crescent City Girls: The Lives of Young Black Women in Segregated New Orleans'' (2015) extends beyond the ethnographic work of the field in which the three scholars mentioned focus on place and social history to tell the stories of Black girls. This regional approach emphasizes the necessary local specifies of Black girlhood. Nazera Sadiq Wright's ''Black Girlhood in the Nineteenth Century'' (2016) traces a long literary tradition to discover the origins of Black girlhood as we have come to understand the category today.

== Criticism ==
As an emerging field, girl studies has faced some criticisms from other scholars. Janie Victoria Wald and Beth Cooper Benjamin have found that connections between "girls' psychosocial development and persistent issues in adult women's lives" are not as present in recent scholarship as they were during the advent of the field and believe they should be in order to explore intergenerational relationships.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These two scholars also criticize the increased specialization of focus in the field and subsequent disconnect between the subfields.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Mary Celeste Kearney, a scholar who does work in girl studies, notices that though there is a focus on intersectionality within the field, "non-white, non-Western girls remain vastly understudied as result of such research being conducted primarily in Canada, Australia, Great Britain, Northern Europe, and the United States."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some critics identify problems that they see with the field as a whole, claiming that it is neither a new nor exciting field, as the ''[[Girlhood Studies]]'' journal states, but rather one that is established and in crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Mendes Kaitlynn, Kumarini Silva, Linda Duits, Liesbet van Zoonen, Sharon Lamb, Shakuntala Banaji, and Natalie Edwards (2009) Commentary and criticism, Feminist Media Studies, 9:1.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future of Girlhood ==
Girlhood and girl power work t&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonick|first=Marnina|last2=Renold|first2=Emma|last3=Ringrose|first3=Jessica|last4=Weems|first4=Lisa|date=2009-01-01|title=Rethinking Agency and Resistance: What Comes After Girl Power?|url=https://www.berghahnjournals.com/view/journals/girlhood-studies/2/2/ghs020202.xml|journal=Girlhood Studies|language=en-US|volume=2|issue=2|pages=1–9|doi=10.3167/ghs.2009.020202|issn=1938-8209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cherland|first=Meredith|date=2005|title=CHAPTER SIX: Reading Elisabeth's Girlhood: History and Popular Culture at Work in the Subjectivity of a Tween|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/42978694|journal=Counterpoints|volume=245|pages=95–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;ogether to form a strong bond between young girls across the globe. When girls are growing up, they are learning from the women around them, what is right and what is wrong. Women of the older ages are set up as role models for those who are under the age of 18. The future of girlhood is in the hands of those who chose to set a good example forward for these young people to grasp onto. Marnina et al., explained in their book that we are past the after-girl power stage (2009). After passing this stage these groups of writers are posing another question as to if there is something that comes after this stage. Girls have seen violence from all sorts of stages causing them to fear their growing up ways. As mentioned in the text ''History and Popular Culture at Work in the Subjectivity of a Tween,'' the authors daughter was scared to become an adult because of the concerns of others. Other people in her class were bring articles and other pieces of writing that scared Elisabeth into thinking that growing up was not something that she wanted to do (2005). With girls having these types of ideas rushing through their minds as they get older – we are not helping them grow in a safe space. Instead, we are raising them to fear the outside world and not want to be a part of it. This can change if we focus on what comes next once we pass the after-girl power.

{{about|the book on India written by Ctesias|other uses|Indica (disambiguation)}}

'''''Indica''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἰνδικά}} ''Indika'') is a book by the [[Classical Greece|classical]] [[Greeks|Greek]] [[physician]] [[Ctesias]] purporting to describe [[India]]. Written in the fifth century BC, it is the first known Greek reference to that distant land. Ctesias was the court physician to king [[Artaxerxes II]] of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]], and the book is not based on his own experiences, but on stories brought to Persia by traders, along the [[Silk Road]] from [[Serica]], a land north of [[China]] and India where domesticated [[silk]] originated.

== Contents ==

The book contains the first known reference to the [[unicorn]], ostensibly an [[Asinus|ass]] in India that had a single 1.5 [[cubit]] (27 [[inch]]) horn on its head, and introduces the European world to the talking parrot, and falconry, which was not yet practiced in Europe. 

Among the information apparently conveyed in the book (mostly according to second-hand accounts of its contents):

* The Indus river is identified, and described as being up to twenty miles across.
* India is heavily populated, more than the rest of the world combined
* Indian elephants are first described, generations before [[Alexander the Great]] faced them while conquering part of India.
* While monkeys were well known in the Mediterranean, unusual types are described for India, including a tiny breed with a six foot long tail
* Indian dogs the size of lions
* Gigantic mountains
* The [[martikhora]] (manticore), a red creature with a face like a man's, three rows of teeth, and a scorpion's sting on its tail. This is the earliest known Western reference to the manticore.
* Detailed descriptions of Indian customs, proclaiming them very just and honorable.
* Short, black men called [[Pygmy (Greek mythology)|pygmies]], who live in the middle of India.
* Palm and date trees three times the size of those in Babylon

[[File:Nuremberg_chronicles_-_Strange_People_-_Umbrella_Foot_(XIIr).jpg|thumb|right|Among the more absurd claims of Indica were the stories of a race of people with only one leg, or with feet so big they could be used as an umbrella]]
Ctesias' books contains such a mix of obviously dubious [[apocrypha]] among its truths that it was sometimes mocked by subsequent authors as a source of wild yarns and myths. 

In the Second Century AD, the satirist [[Lucian]] depicted Ctesias as being condemned to a special part of [[hell]] reserved for those who spread wild lies during their lifetimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YVwBAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT96&amp;lpg=PT96&amp;dq=ctesias+seres&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wm03XC6y3v&amp;sig=9f60X-h_Du4hUaNSFSabWylcHlM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0g5YUqDrJcfIqQGWgYGAAw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA Ctesias: On India]&lt;/ref&gt; Indica apparently included such anecdotes as the description of a race of one-legged people called the Monosceli, another whose feet were so big they could be used as umbrellas (the Skiopolae), men with tails like [[satyr]]s, and claimed that people in the actual land of Serica (a word thought in some other cases to be the Greek word for part of China) were 18 feet tall.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=D7gIAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;ots=NaXoTO8p6j&amp;sig=CFYEddCdUMz31JQ_YM9twLksZGk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0g5YUqDrJcfIqQGWgYGAAw&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Notes on the Indica of Ctesias]&lt;/ref&gt; Lucian's own similar book, [[True History|A True Story]], was presented as a satire of ''Indica'', including an introduction that calls Ctesias and other similar authors inexperienced liars. Lucian states that he, himself, will now present a similar lie, but unlike his predecessors, he is at least honest enough to state this plainly up-front.

Conversely, the book did serve as the original source for a great deal of actual knowledge about the East that appears to have been completely absent in Western literature. Though only fragments exist today, its probable contents are very well-known because they were the main reference for Mediterranean knowledge of India, for centuries, and therefore are cited and quoted by many ancient authors whose works do survive to this day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7944">In art, '''Institutional Critique''' is the systematic inquiry into the workings of art institutions, such as galleries and museums, and is most associated with the work of artists like [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Andrea Fraser]], [[John Knight (artist)]], [[Adrian Piper]], [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], and [[Hans Haacke]] and the scholarship of [[Alexander Alberro]], [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]], [[Birgit Pelzer]], and [[Anne Rorimer]].&lt;ref&gt;https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/institutional-critique&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moca.org/exhibition/1965-1975-reconsidering-the-object-of-art&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutional Critique takes the form of temporary or nontransferable approaches to painting and sculpture, architectural alterations and interventions, and performative gestures and language intended to disrupt the otherwise transparent operations of galleries and museums and the professionals who administer them. Examples would be [[Neile Toroni]] making imprints of a No. 50 brush at 30cm intervals directly onto gallery walls as opposed to applying the same mark to paper or canvas;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renaissancesociety.org/exhibitions/366/niele-toroni/&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Burden's ''Exposing the Foundation of the Museum'' (1986), in which he made an excavation in a gallery of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, to expose the literal concrete foundation of the building;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.moca.org/collection/work/exposing-the-foundation-of-the-museum&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Andrea Fraser]] inhabiting the persona of an archetypical museum docent in the form of a live performance or video document.&lt;ref&gt;https://thewadsworth.org/threehistoriesfraser/&lt;/ref&gt; Assumptions about the aesthetic autonomy of painting and sculpture, the neutral context of the [[white cube]], and the objective delivery of information are explored as subjects of art, mapped out as discursive formations, and (re)framed within the context of the museum itself. As such, Institutional Critique seeks to make visible the social, political, economic, and historical underpinnings of art. Institutional Critique questions the false distinction between taste and disinterested aesthetic judgement, revealing that taste is an institutionally cultivated sensibility that differs depending on the intersection of any one person's class, ethnic, sexual, or gender subject positions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jrp-ringier.com/pages/index.php?id_r=4&amp;id_t=&amp;id_p=7&amp;id_b=573&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==

Institutional Critique is a practice that emerged from the developments of [[Minimalism]] and its concerns with the phenomenology of the viewer; formalist art criticism and art history (e.g. [[Clement Greenberg]] and [[Michael Fried (art critic)|Michael Fried]]); [[conceptual art]] and its concerns with language, processes, and administrative society; and the critique of authorship that begins with [[Roland Barthes]] and [[Michel Foucault]] in the late 1960s and continues with the advent of [[appropriation art]] in the 1970s and its upending of long-held notions of authorship, originality, artistic production, popular culture, and identity.  Institutional critique is often site-specific and is contemporaneous with the advent of artists who eschewed gallery and museum contexts altogether to build monumental earthworks in the landscape, notably [[Michael Heizer]], [[Nancy Holt]], [[Walter de Maria]], and [[Robert Smithson]]. Institutional critique is also associated with the development of post-structuralist philosophy, [[critical theory]], [[literary theory]], [[feminism]], gender studies, and [[critical race theory]].

== Artists ==

Artists associated with Institutional Critique since the 1960s include [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Daniel Buren]], [[Hans Haacke]], [[Michael Asher (artist)|Michael Asher]], [[John Knight (artist)]], [[Christopher D'Arcangelo]], [[Robert Smithson]], [[Dan Graham]], [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], [[Adrian Piper]], and [[Martha Rosler]]. Artists active since the 1980s include [[Louise Lawler]], [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]], [[Renée Green]], [[Group Material]], [[Andrea Fraser]], [[Fred Forest]], [[Christian Philipp Müller]], [[Aaron Flint Jamison]], and [[Mark Dion]]. 

In the early 1990s, influenced in large part by Daniel Buren, [[Jacques Tati]], [[Roland Barthes]], and the participatory sculptures of [[Felix Gonzalez-Torres]], a loose affiliation of artists including [[Liam Gillick]], [[Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster]], [[Pierre Huyghe]], and [[Rirkrit Tiravanija]] engaged the institution of art in a convivial manner. These artists, gathered under the rubric of [[Relational Aesthetics]] by critic [[Nicholas Bourriaud]], saw galleries and museums as sites of social interaction and the spontaneous creation of works of art characterized by their contingent temporality.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mayrevue.com/en/traffic-espaces-temps-de-lechange/&lt;/ref&gt; The collegial atmosphere of these open-ended situations was quite distinct from the more confrontational strategies of Buren, Haacke, [[Jenny Holzer]], and [[Barbara Kruger]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marginalutility.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Claire-Bishop_Antagonism-and-Relational-Aesthetics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sachabaumann.com/shes-krafty-diary/2004/2/12/traffic-control-joe-scanlan-on-social-space-and-relational-a.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[Maurizio Cattelan]], [[Brian Goeltzenleuchter]], [[Matthieu Laurette]], [[Tameka Norris]], [[Tino Sehgal]], [[Carey Young]], and others have taken a critical eye to the art museum and its role as a public and private institution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thingsthatfall.com/fair-use.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.guggenheim.org/exhibition/maurizio-cattelan-america&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==

One of the criticisms of Institutional Critique is that it requires from its audience a familiarity with its esoteric concerns. As with much contemporary music and dance,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/28/alex-ross-modern-classical-music&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.um.es/vmca/proceedings/docs/35.Inma-Alvarez.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Institutional Critique of art is a practice that only specialists in the field—artists, theorists, historians, and critics—are privy to. Due to its sophisticated understanding of modern art and society—and as part of a privileged discourse not unlike other specialized forms of knowledge—art as Institutional Critique can often leave [[layman]] viewers alienated and/or marginalized.

Another criticism of the concept is that it can be a misnomer. Artist [[Andrea Fraser]] (in Artforum) and critic Michael Kimmelman (in The New York Times) have argued, for example, that institutional critique artists work within—and benefit from—the very same institutions they ostensibly critique.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marginalutility.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/Andrea-Fraser_From-the-Critique-of-Institutions-to-an-Institution-of-Critique.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/25/arts/design/tall-french-visitor-takes-up-residence-in-the-guggenheim.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Standard Book Number''' ('''ISBN''') is a unique{{efn|Occasionally, publishers erroneously assign an ISBN to more than one title—the first edition of ''[[The Ultimate Alphabet]]'' and ''The Ultimate Alphabet Workbook'' have the same ISBN, 0-8050-0076-3.

Publishers purchase ISBNs from an affiliate of the International ISBN Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International ISBN Agency|url=https://www.isbn-international.org/|accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an [[e-book]], a [[paperback]] and a [[hardcover]] edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN. The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. The method of assigning an ISBN is nation-based and varies from country to country, often depending on how large the publishing industry is within a country.

The initial ISBN configuration of recognition{{clarify|date=October 2017|reason=What is a "configuration of recognition", and what does it mean to generate it?}} was generated in 1967, based upon the 9-digit '''Standard Book Numbering''' ('''SBN''') created in 1966. The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108 (the SBN code can be converted to a ten-digit ISBN by prefixing it with a zero digit "0").

Privately published books sometimes appear without an ISBN. The International ISBN agency sometimes assigns such books ISBNs on its own initiative.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Philip (1992). {{cite web |url= http://www.theindexer.org/files/18-1/18-1_025.pdf |title=Book numbering: The importance of the ISBN }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(245KB)}}. ''The Indexer.'' '''18''' (1): 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another identifier, the [[International Standard Serial Number]] (ISSN), identifies periodical publications such as [[magazine]]s; and the [[International Standard Music Number]] (ISMN) covers for musical scores.

==History==
The Standard Book Numbering (SBN) [[code]] is a 9-digit commercial [[book]] [[identifier]] system created by [[Gordon Foster]], Emeritus Professor of Statistics at [[Trinity College, Dublin]],&lt;ref name="From Archive.org-4646971"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.informaticsdevelopmentinstitute.net/isbn.html |title= INTERNATIONAL STANDARD BOOK NUMBERING (ISBN) SYSTEM original 1966 report |website= informaticsdevelopmentinstitute.net |date=1966 |access-date=20 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430024722/http://www.informaticsdevelopmentinstitute.net/isbn.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |first= Gordon |last=Foster}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the booksellers and stationers [[WHSmith]] and others in 1965.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.isbn.org/ISBN_history |title=ISBN History |website= isbn.org |date=20 April 2014 |access-date= 20 April 2014 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140420232459/http://www.isbn.org/ISBN_history |archivedate=20 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISBN configuration of recognition was generated in 1967 in the United Kingdom by David Whitaker&lt;ref name="ktieb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manwal ghall-Utenti tal-ISBN |url= http://ktieb.org.mt/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Manwal-ghall-Utenti-tal-ISBN-Maltese.pdf |publisher=Kunsill Nazzjonali tal-Ktieb |edition=6th |language= Maltese |location=[[Malta]] |date=2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817083617/http://ktieb.org.mt/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Manwal-ghall-Utenti-tal-ISBN-Maltese.pdf |archivedate=17 August 2016 |page=5 |isbn= 978-99957-889-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; (regarded as the "Father of the ISBN"&lt;ref name="niso.org"&gt;{{citation |format=PDF |url= http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/6294/ISQ_vol8_no3_July1996.pdf |title= Information Standards Quarterly |date=July 1996 |page=12 |number=3 |volume=8 |publisher= ISO |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140804153745/http://www.niso.org/apps/group_public/download.php/6294/ISQ_vol8_no3_July1996.pdf | archivedate= 4 August 2014 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and in 1968 in the United States by Emery Koltay&lt;ref name="ktieb" /&gt; (who later became director of the U.S. ISBN agency [[R.R.

The 10-digit ISBN format was developed by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) and was published in 1970 as international standard ISO 2108.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ktieb" /&gt; The United Kingdom continued to use the 9-digit SBN code until 1974. ISO has appointed the International ISBN Agency as the registration authority for ISBN worldwide and the ISBN Standard is developed under the control of ISO Technical Committee 46/Subcommittee 9 [[TC 46/SC 9]]. The [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] on-line facility only refers back to 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |format=PDF |url= http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=6897 |title= ISO 2108:1978 |publisher= ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An SBN may be converted to an ISBN by prefixing the digit "0". For example, the second edition of ''[[The Guv'nor and Other Short Stories|Mr. J. G. Reeder Returns]]'', published by Hodder in 1965, has {{Nowrap|"SBN 340 01381 8"}} – 340 indicating the publisher, 01381 their serial number, and 8 being the check digit. This can be converted to {{ISBN|0-340-01381-8}}; the check digit does not need to be re-calculated.

Since 1 January 2007, ISBNs have contained 13 digits, a format that is compatible with "[[Bookland]]" [[European Article Number]] EAN-13s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/iso/tc46sc9/isbn.htm | title=Frequently Asked Questions about the new ISBN standard from ISO | author=TC 46/SC 9 | publisher=LAC‐BAC | place=CA | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610160919/http://www.lac-bac.gc.ca/iso/tc46sc9/isbn.htm | archivedate=10 June 2007 | df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
An ISBN is assigned to each edition and variation (except reprintings) of a book. For example, an ebook, a paperback, and a hardcover edition of the same book would each have a different ISBN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |title=See paragraph 5.2 of ISBN Users' Manual International edition (2012) }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(548&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISBN is 13 digits long if assigned on or after 1 January 2007, and 10 digits long if assigned before 2007. An International Standard Book Number consists of 4 parts (if it is a 10-digit ISBN) or 5 parts (for a 13-digit ISBN):

[[File:ISBN Details.svg|thumb|The parts of a 10-digit ISBN and the corresponding EAN‑13 and barcode. Note the different check digits in each. The part of the EAN‑13 labeled "EAN" is the [[Bookland]] country code.]]

# for a 13-digit ISBN, a prefix element – a ''[[GS1]] prefix'': so far 978 or 979 have been made available by GS1,&lt;ref name="ISBN User Man" /&gt;
# the ''registration group element'' (language-sharing country group, individual country or territory),&lt;ref&gt;Some books have several codes in the first block: e.g. A. M. Yaglom's ''Correlation Theory...'', published by [[Springer Verlag]], has two ISBNs, 0-387-96331-6 and 3-540-96331-6. Though Springer's 387 and 540 codes are different for English (0) and German (3); the same item number 96331 produces the same check digit: 6. Springer uses 431 as their publisher code for Japanese (4) and 4-431-96331-? would also have check digit ? = 6.  Other Springer books in English have publisher code 817, and 0-817-96331-? would also get check digit ? = 6. This suggests special considerations were made for assigning Springer's publisher codes, as random assignments of different publisher codes would ''not'' lead the same item number to get the same check digit every time. Finding publisher codes for English and German, say, with this effect amounts to solving a linear equation in modular arithmetic.&lt;/ref&gt;
# the ''registrant'' element,
# the ''publication element'',&lt;ref name="ISBN User Man" /&gt; and
# a ''[[checksum]] character'' or [[check digit]].&lt;ref name="ISBN User Man" /&gt;

A 13-digit ISBN can be separated into its parts (''prefix element'', ''registration group'', ''registrant'', ''publication'' and ''check digit''), and when this is done it is customary to separate the parts with [[hyphen]]s or spaces. Separating the parts (''registration group'', ''registrant'', ''publication'' and ''check digit'') of a 10-digit ISBN is also done with either hyphens or spaces. Figuring out how to correctly separate a given ISBN is complicated, because most of the parts do not use a fixed number of digits.&lt;ref&gt;The International ISBN agency's ''ISBN User's Manual'' says: "The ten-digit number is divided into four parts of variable length, which must be separated clearly, by hyphens or spaces" although omission of separators is permitted for internal data processing. If present, hyphens must be correctly placed; see [https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation ISBN hyphenation definition]. The actual definition for hyphenation contains more than 220 different registration group elements with each one broken down into a few to several ranges for the length of the registrant element (more than 1,000 total). The document defining the ranges, listed by agency, is 29 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== How ISBNs are issued ===
ISBN issuance is country-specific, in that ISBNs are issued by the ISBN registration agency that is responsible for that country or territory regardless of the publication language. The ranges of ISBNs assigned to any particular country are based on the publishing profile of the country concerned, and so the ranges will vary depending on the number of books and the number, type, and size of publishers that are active. Some ISBN registration agencies are based in national libraries or within ministries of culture and thus may receive direct funding from government to support their services. In other cases, the ISBN registration service is provided by organisations such as bibliographic data providers that are not government funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ISBN Canada|url = http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/services/isbn-canada/Pages/isbn-canada.aspx|website = www.bac-lac.gc.ca|access-date = 2016-01-19|first = Library and Archives|last = Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Registration group identifier ===
{{anchor|Registration Group identifier}}
{{anchor|ISBN format}}
The ISBN [[list of ISBN identifier groups|registration group identifier]] is a 1- to 5-digit number that is valid within a single prefix element (i.e. one of 978 or 979),&lt;ref name="ISBN User Man" /&gt; and can be separated between hyphens, such as {{nobr|"978-1-..."}}. Registration group identifiers have primarily been allocated within the 978 prefix element.&lt;ref name="ISBN Ranges"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation |title= ISBN Ranges |website=isbn-international.org |at=Select the format you desire and click on the Generate button |date= 29 April 2014 |accessdate= 29 April 2014 |author= |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140429101326/https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation |archivedate= 29 April 2014 |deadurl=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The single-digit group identifiers within the 978-prefix element are: 0 or 1 for English-speaking countries; 2 for French-speaking countries; 3 for German-speaking countries; 4 for Japan; 5 for Russian-speaking countries; and 7 for People's Republic of China. An example 5-digit group identifier is 99936, for [[Bhutan]]. The allocated group IDs are: 0–5, 600–622, 65, 7, 80–94, 950–989, 9920–9989, and 99901–99981.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation a complete list of group identifiers].  ISBN.org sometimes calls them ''group numbers''. Their table of identifiers now refers to ''ISBN prefix ranges'', which must be assumed to be group identifier ranges.&lt;/ref&gt; Books published in rare languages typically have longer group identifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hailman |first=Jack Parker |date=2008 |title=Coding and redundancy: man-made and animal-evolved signals |publisher=Harvard University Press |page=209 |isbn=978-0-674-02795-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the 979 prefix element, the registration group identifier 0 is reserved for compatibility with [[International Standard Music Number]]s (ISMNs), but such material is not actually assigned an ISBN.&lt;ref name="ISBN User Man"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |title=ISBN Users' manual |work=isbn-international.org |edition=Sixth International |isbn=978-92-95055-02-5 |date=2012 |accessdate=29 April 2014 |author=International ISBN Agency |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429101742/https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2014 |deadurl=no |pages=7, 23 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The registration group identifiers within prefix element 979 that have been assigned are 10 for France, 11 for the Republic of Korea, and 12 for Italy.&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-5691881"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.isbn-international.org/export_rangemessagebyprefix.pdf |title=International ISBN Agency – Range Message (pdf sorted by prefix) |page=29 |website=isbn-international.org |date=5 December 2014 |accessdate=15 December 2014 |author=International ISBN Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original 9-digit standard book number (SBN) had no registration group identifier, but prefixing a zero (0) to a 9-digit SBN creates a valid 10-digit ISBN.

=== Registrant element ===
The national ISBN agency assigns the registrant element ([[cf.]] [[:Category:ISBN agencies]]) and an accompanying series of ISBNs within that registrant element to the publisher; the publisher then allocates one of the ISBNs to each of its books. In most countries, a book publisher is not required by law to assign an ISBN; however, most bookstores only handle ISBN bearing publications.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

A listing of more than 900,000 assigned publisher codes is published, and can be ordered in book form ([[Euro|€]]1399, [[United States dollar|US$]]1959). The web site of the ISBN agency does not offer any free method of looking up publisher codes.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.isbn-international.org/page/directory Publisher's International ISBN Directory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921085436/http://isbn-international.org/page/directory |date=21 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Partial lists have been compiled (from library catalogs) for the English-language groups: [[List of group-0 ISBN publisher codes|identifier 0]] and [[List of group-1 ISBN publisher codes|identifier 1]].

Publishers receive blocks of ISBNs, with larger blocks allotted to publishers expecting to need them; a small publisher may receive ISBNs of one or more digits for the registration group identifier, several digits for the registrant, and a single digit for the publication element. Once that block of ISBNs is used, the publisher may receive another block of ISBNs, with a different registrant element. Consequently, a publisher may have different allotted registrant elements. There also may be more than one registration group identifier used in a country. This might occur once all the registrant elements from a particular registration group have been allocated to publishers.

By using variable block lengths, registration agencies are able to customise the allocations of ISBNs that they make to publishers. For example, a large publisher may be given a block of ISBNs where fewer digits are allocated for the registrant element and many digits are allocated for the publication element; likewise, countries publishing many titles have few allocated digits for the registration group identifier and many for the registrant and publication elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Book Book: A Complete Guide to Creating a Book on Your Computer|last=Splane|first=Lily|publisher=Anaphase II Publishing|year=2002|isbn=978-0-945962-14-4|location=|pages=37|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some sample &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; codes, illustrating block length variations.

==== Pattern for English language ISBNs ====
English-language registration group elements are 0 and 1 (2 of more than 220 registration group elements). These two registration group elements are divided into registrant elements in a systematic pattern, which allows their length to be determined, as follows:&lt;ref name="C4WDefault-9122662"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.isbn-international.org/range_file_generation |title=ISBN Ranges |date=15 September 2014 &lt;!-- No date available; last modification date used. --&gt; |accessdate=15 September 2014 |website=isbn-international.org |author1=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |publisher=International ISBN Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Check digits ==
A [[check digit]] is a form of redundancy check used for [[error detection]], the decimal equivalent of a binary [[check bit]]. It consists of a single digit computed from the other digits in the number. The method for the ten-digit code is an extension of that for SBNs, the two systems are compatible, and SBN prefixed with "0" will give the same check-digit as without – the digit is base eleven, and can be 0-9 or X. The system for thirteen-digit codes is not compatible and will, in general, give a different check digit from the corresponding 10-digit ISBN, and does not provide the same protection against transposition. This is because the thirteen-digit code was required to be compatible with the EAN format, and hence could not contain an "X".

=== ISBN-10 check digits ===
The 2001 edition of the official manual of the [http://www.isbn-international.org/ International ISBN Agency] says that the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[check digit]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/international/html/usm4.htm |title=ISBN Users' Manual – 4. Structure of ISBN |publisher=Isbn.org |accessdate=2013-05-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522043458/http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/international/html/usm4.htm |archivedate=22 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; – which is the last digit of the ten-digit ISBN – must range from 0 to 10 (the symbol X is used for 10), and must be such that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 1, is a multiple of [[11 (number)|11]].

For example, for an &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; of 0-306-40615-2:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 s &amp;= (0\times 10) + (3\times 9) + (0\times 8) + (6\times 7) + (4\times 6) + (0\times 5) + (6\times 4) + (1\times 3) + (5\times 2) + (2\times 1) \\
   &amp;=    0 + 27 +   0 +  42 +  24 +   0 + 24  +   3 + 10 + 2\\
   &amp;= 132 = 12\times 11
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Formally, using [[modular arithmetic]], we can say:
:&lt;math&gt;(10x_1+9x_2+8x_3+7x_4+6x_5+5x_6+4x_7+3x_8+2x_9+x_{10})\equiv 0 \pmod{11}.&lt;/math&gt;

It is also true for &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt;'s that the sum of all the ten digits, each multiplied by its weight in ''ascending'' order from 1 to 10, is a multiple of 11. For this example:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 s &amp;= (0\times 1) + (3\times 2) + (0\times 3) + (6\times 4) + (4\times 5) + (0\times 6) + (6\times 7) + (1\times 8) + (5\times 9) + (2\times 10) \\
   &amp;=    0 + 6 +   0 +  24 +  20 +   0 + 42  +   8 + 45 + 20\\
   &amp;= 165 = 15\times 11
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Formally, we can say:
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 + 4x_4 + 5x_5 + 6x_6 + 7x_7 + 8x_8 + 9x_9 + 10x_{10})\equiv 0 \pmod{11}.&lt;/math&gt;

The two most common errors in handling an ISBN (e.g., typing or writing it) are a single altered digit or the transposition of adjacent digits. It can be [[mathematical proof|proved]] that all possible valid &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt;'s have at least two digits different from each other. It can also be proved that there are no pairs of valid &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt;'s with eight identical digits and two transposed digits. (These are true only because the ISBN is less than 11 digits long, and because 11 is a [[prime number]].)
The ISBN check digit method therefore ensures that it will always be possible to detect these two most common types of error, i.e. if either of these types of error has occurred, the result will never be a valid ISBN&amp;nbsp;– the sum of the digits multiplied by their weights will never be a multiple of 11. However, if the error occurs in the publishing house and goes undetected, the book will be issued with an invalid ISBN.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''I'saka: a sketch grammar of a language of north-central New Guinea.'' Pacific Linguistics. ISBN "0-85883-554-4".&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, it is possible for other types of error, such as two altered non-transposed digits, or three altered digits, to result in a valid ISBN (although it is still unlikely).

=== ISBN-10 check digit calculation ===
&lt;!-- "Damm algorithm" links here --&gt;
Each of the first nine digits of the ten-digit ISBN—excluding the check digit itself—is multiplied by its (integer) weight, descending from 10 to 2, and the sum of these nine products found. The value of the check digit is simply the one number between 0 and 10 which, when added to this sum, means the total is a multiple of 11.

For example, the check digit for an &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; of 0-306-40615-''?'' is calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 s &amp;= (0\times 10)+(3\times 9)+(0\times 8)+(6\times 7)+(4\times 6)+(0\times 5)+(6\times 4)+(1\times 3)+(5\times 2)\\
   &amp;= 130
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
Adding 2 to 130 gives a multiple of 11 (132 = 12 x 11) &amp;minus; this is the only number between 0 and 10 which does so. Therefore, the check digit has to be 2, and the complete sequence is &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN 0-306-40615-2&lt;/nowiki&gt;. The value &lt;math&gt;x_{10}&lt;/math&gt; required to satisfy this condition might be 10; if so, an 'X' should be used.

Alternatively, [[modular arithmetic]] is convenient for calculating the check digit using modulus 11. The [[remainder]] of this sum when it is divided by 11 (i.e. its value modulo 11), is computed. This remainder plus the check digit must equal either 0 or 11. Therefore, the check digit is (11 minus the remainder of the sum of the products modulo 11) modulo 11. Taking the remainder modulo 11 a second time accounts for the possibility that the first remainder is 0. Without the second modulo operation the calculation could end up with 11 – 0 = 11 which is invalid. (Strictly speaking the ''first'' "modulo 11" is unneeded, but it may be considered to simplify the calculation.)

For example, the check digit for the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; of 0-306-40615-''?'' is calculated as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 s &amp;= (11 - ( ((0\times 10)+(3\times 9)+(0\times 8)+(6\times 7)+(4\times 6)+(0\times 5)+(6\times 4)+(1\times 3)+(5\times 2) ) \,\bmod\, 11 ) \,\bmod\, 11\\
   &amp;=    (11 - (0 + 27 +   0 +  42 +  24 +   0 + 24  +   3 + 10 ) \,\bmod\, 11) \,\bmod\, 11\\
   &amp;= (11-(130 \,\bmod\, 11))\,\bmod\, 11 \\
   &amp;= (11-(9))\,\bmod\, 11 \\
   &amp;= (2)\,\bmod\, 11 \\
   &amp;= 2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the check digit is 2.

It is possible to avoid the multiplications in a software implementation by using two accumulators. Repeatedly adding &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; computes the necessary multiples:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
// Returns ISBN error syndrome, zero for a valid ISBN, non-zero for an invalid one.
// digits[i] must be between 0 and 10.
int CheckISBN(int const digits[10])
{
        int i, s = 0, t = 0;

        for (i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) {
                t += digits[i];
                s += t;
        }
        return s % 11;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
The modular reduction can be done once at the end, as shown above (in which case &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; could hold a value as large as 496, for the invalid &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN 99999-999-9-X&lt;/nowiki&gt;), or &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;t&lt;/code&gt; could be reduced by a conditional subtract after each addition.

=== ISBN-13 check digit calculation ===
The 2005 edition of the International ISBN Agency's official manual&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |title=ISBN Users' Manual International edition (2012) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429101742/https://www.isbn-international.org/sites/default/files/ISBN%20Manual%202012%20-corr.pdf |archivedate=29 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(284&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes how the 13-digit ISBN [[check digit]] is calculated. The &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; check digit, which is the last digit of the ISBN, must range from 0 to 9 and must be such that the sum of all the thirteen digits, each multiplied by its (integer) weight, alternating between 1 and 3, is a multiple of [[10 (number)|10]].

Formally, using [[modular arithmetic]], we can say:
:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 + x_5 + 3x_6 + x_7 + 3x_8 + x_9 + 3x_{10} + x_{11} + 3x_{12} + x_{13} ) \equiv 0 \pmod{10}.&lt;/math&gt;

The calculation of an &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; check digit begins with the first 12 digits of the thirteen-digit ISBN (thus excluding the check digit itself). Each digit, from left to right, is alternately multiplied by 1 or 3, then those products are summed [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] 10 to give a value ranging from 0 to 9. Subtracted from 10, that leaves a result from 1 to 10. A zero (0) replaces a ten (10), so, in all cases, a single check digit results.

For example, the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; check digit of 978-0-306-40615-''?'' is calculated as follows:
&lt;!-- This is what we'd like to do, but it is far too wide.
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle \begin{array}{rlllllllllllll}
s &amp;{}= 1 \times 9 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 7 &amp;{}+ 1 \times 8 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 0 &amp;{}+ 1 \times 3 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 0 &amp;{}+ 1 \times 6 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 4 &amp;{}+ 1 \times 0 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 6 &amp;{}+ 1 \times 1 &amp;{}+ 3 \times 5 \\
 &amp;{}= 9 &amp;{}+21 &amp;{}+ 8 &amp;{}+ 0 &amp;{}+ 3 &amp;{}+ 0 &amp;{}+ 6 &amp;{}+ 12 &amp;{}+ 0 &amp;{}+ 18 &amp;{}+ 1 &amp;{}+ 15 \\
 &amp;{}= 93
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;
 s = 9×1 + 7×3 + 8×1 + 0×3 + 3×1 + 0×3 + 6×1 + 4×3 + 0×1 + 6×3 + 1×1 + 5×3
   =   9 +  21 +   8 +   0 +   3 +   0 +   6 +  12 +   0 +  18 +   1 +  15
   = 93
 93 / 10 = 9 remainder 3
 10 –  3 = 7

Thus, the check digit is 7, and the complete sequence is &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN 978-0-306-40615-7&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

In general, the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; check digit is calculated as follows.

Let
:&lt;math&gt;r = \big(10 - \big(x_1 + 3x_2 + x_3 + 3x_4 + \cdots + x_{11} + 3x_{12}\big) \,\bmod\, 10\big).&lt;/math&gt;

Then
:&lt;math&gt;x_{13} = \begin{cases} r &amp;\text{ ; } r &lt; 10 \\ 0 &amp;\text{ ; } r = 10 . \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

This check system&amp;nbsp;– similar to the [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] check digit formula&amp;nbsp;– does not catch all errors of adjacent digit transposition. Specifically, if the difference between two adjacent digits is 5, the check digit will not catch their transposition. For instance, the above example allows this situation with the 6 followed by a 1. The correct order contributes 3×6+1×1 = 19 to the sum; while, if the digits are transposed (1 followed by a 6), the contribution of those two digits will be 3×1+1×6 = 9. However, 19 and 9 are congruent modulo 10, and so produce the same, final result: both ISBNs will have a check digit of 7. The &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-10&lt;/nowiki&gt; formula uses the [[prime number|prime]] modulus 11 which avoids this blind spot, but requires more than the digits 0-9 to express the check digit.

Additionally, if the sum of the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 12th digits is tripled then added to the remaining digits (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), the total will always be divisible by 10 (i.e., end in 0).

=== ISBN-10 to ISBN-13 conversion ===
The conversion is quite simple as one only needs to prefix "978" to the existing number and calculate the new checksum using the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; algorithm.

=== {{anchor|Cancelled ISBN}}Errors in usage ===
Publishers and [[library|libraries]] have varied policies about the use of the ISBN check digit. Publishers sometimes fail to check the correspondence of a book title and its ISBN before publishing it; that failure causes book identification problems for libraries, booksellers, and readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Book Publishing I|last=Lorimer|first=Rowland|last2=Shoichet|first2=Jillian|last3=Maxwell|first3=John W.|publisher=CCSP Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-9738727-0-5|location=|pages=299|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, {{ISBN|0-590-76484-5}} is shared by two books – ''Ninja gaiden®: a novel based on the best-selling game by Tecmo'' (1990) and ''Wacky laws'' (1997), both published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]].

Most libraries and booksellers display the book record for an invalid ISBN issued by the publisher. The [[Library of Congress]] catalogue contains books published with invalid ISBNs, which it usually tags with the phrase "Cancelled ISBN".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd020.html 020 – International Standard Book Number (R) – MARC 21 Bibliographic – Full]. Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt; However, book-ordering systems such as [[Amazon.com]] will not search for a book if an invalid ISBN is entered to its search engine.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} [[OCLC]] often indexes by invalid ISBNs, if the book is indexed in that way by a member library.

=== eISBN ===
Only the term "ISBN" should be used; the terms "eISBN" and "e-ISBN" have historically been sources of confusion and should be avoided. If a book exists in one or more digital ([[e-book]]) formats, each of those formats must have its own ISBN. In other words, each of the three separate [[EPUB]], [[Amazon Kindle]], and [[PDF]] formats of a particular book will have its own specific ISBN. They should not share the ISBN of the paper version, and there is no generic "eISBN" which encompasses all the e-book formats for a title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sellbox.com/myth-eisbn-every-ebook-edition-needs-unique-number/|title=The Myth of the eISBN Why Every eBook Edition Needs a Unique Number – Publishing services for self publishing authors and businesses|date=2013-06-28|newspaper=Publishing services for self publishing authors and businesses|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EAN format used in barcodes, and upgrading ==
Currently the [[barcode]]s on a book's back cover (or inside a mass-market [[paperback]] book's front cover) are [[European Article Number|EAN-13]]; they may have a separate barcode encoding five digits called an [[EAN-5]] for the [[currency]] and the [[recommended retail price]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Frequently asked questions |publisher= ISBN |place= [[U.S.|US]] |date= 12 March 2014 |url= http://www.isbn-us.com/blog/2014/03/12/isbn-information-frequently-asked-questions/ |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140416211950/http://www.isbn-us.com/blog/2014/03/12/isbn-information-frequently-asked-questions/ |archivedate= 16 April 2014 |df= dmy-all }} — including a detailed description of the EAN-13 format.&lt;/ref&gt; For 10-digit ISBNs, the number "978", the [[Bookland]] "country code", is prefixed to the ISBN in the barcode data, and the check digit is recalculated according to the EAN13 formula (modulo 10, 1x and 3x weighting on alternating digits).

Partly because of an expected shortage in certain ISBN categories, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) decided to migrate to a thirteen-digit ISBN (&lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt;). The process began 1 January 2005 and was planned to conclude 1 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher= Collections |contribution-url= http://www.collectionscanada.ca/iso/tc46sc9/isbn.htm |type= FAQ |title= ISO TC49SC9 |contribution= ISBN |place= [[Canada|CA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2011}}, all the 13-digit ISBNs began with 978. As the 978 ISBN supply is exhausted, the 979 prefix was introduced. Part of the 979 prefix is reserved for use with the [[Bookland|Musicland]] code for [[Sheet music|musical scores]] with an [[ISMN]]. The 10-digit ISMN codes differed visually as they began with an "M" letter; the bar code represents the "M" as a zero (0), and for checksum purposes it counted as a 3. All ISMNs are now 13 digits commencing 979-0; 979-1 to 979-9 will be used by ISBN.

Publisher identification code numbers are unlikely to be the same in the 978 and 979 ISBNs, likewise, there is no guarantee that language area code numbers will be the same. Moreover, the ten-digit ISBN check digit generally is not the same as the thirteen-digit ISBN check digit. Because the GTIN-13 is part of the [[Global Trade Item Number]] (GTIN) system (that includes the GTIN-14, the GTIN-12, and the GTIN-8), the 13-digit ISBN falls within the 14-digit data field range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Standards | contribution-url = http://www.isbn.org/standards/home/isbn/transition.asp | contribution = Are You Ready for &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt;? | publisher = ISBN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barcode format compatibility is maintained, because (aside from the group breaks) the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; barcode format is identical to the EAN barcode format of existing 10-digit ISBNs. So, migration to an EAN-based system allows booksellers the use of a single numbering system for both books and non-book products that is compatible with existing ISBN based data, with only minimal changes to [[information technology]] systems. Hence, many [[bookstore|booksellers]] (e.g., [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]) migrated to EAN barcodes as early as March 2005. Although many American and Canadian booksellers were able to read EAN-13 barcodes before 2005, most general retailers could not read them. The upgrading of the [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] [[barcode system]] to full EAN-13, in 2005, eased migration to the &lt;nowiki&gt;ISBN-13&lt;/nowiki&gt; in North America.

In September 2010 undergoing the selection process in the Judicial Commission Indonesia. He is rank No. 1 candidate for the peak position in the Judicial Commission. 4

==Academic Background==
In 1976 Jawahir Thontowi graduated from the one of the first Education for Islamic Judges in Indonesia established in Yogyakarta. This was a school which will become of the pioneers of legal practitioners in Indonesia. As an example the head of the Constitution Court in Indonesia Mahfud MD is an alumnus.

Between 1978 and 1979 became the president of the Student Representative Council in The law faculty UII and at the same time the Vice director of the Human Right Commission which was later turned into the Legal Aid Institute in Yogyakarta.  In 1979-1980 become the Secretary General for Student Government Council UII then became the staff member of the community development in Muslim students association Yogyakarta.  During these years he has become a prominent activist in the campus which builds the foundation of his organization skills in later life.

In 1981 he received an LLB Degree from the Faculty of Law Universitas Islam Indonesia. Then in 1984 became the Head of Community Development Division Institute for Research and Community at the Universitas Islam Indonesia.  Then in 1986 took a course in Center for Research Training of Social Science, Universitas Hasanudin. In August that year he received an Award for an outstanding field research Stunent given by YIIS and PLPIIS in Jakarta. Working in the campus and research would then lead to further development in his academic career and an opportunity to attain higher education in Australia. This was a turning point that would excel in academic career.

In 1990 he started a preliminary Masters of Arts at the Anthology Department of UWA . Then in 1992 receive a research grant for the post graduate students from the University of Western Australia.  In 1998 finally completed his Ph.D Degree in the University of Western Australia.  He was ready to go back to Indonesia to implement his knowledge and skill in an Indonesia context, especially going back to campus to teach again. 
Upon return from Australia and going back to Indonesia holding a Ph.D he was appoint Head of the International Department for 3 years in 1999-2001. During this time he was focusing on building and improving the law faculty and made it more dynamic. He pas the team leader in various initiatives conducted by the campus such Designing University Joint Collaboration and development then Establishing the Doctorate Program in Law Faculty University.  This was a major breakthrough for UII having established a Doctorate program in the field of Law.

September 2000 he became the Director of the Doctorate Program law faculty.  In September the next year in 2001 he made an initiative to make the International Program for Law in the campus which took a one-year process. For the Law faculty he made two important contributions that are the establishment of the Doctorate program and the second the International program. March that year he was elected to become the Dean of the Law Faculty until 2006.

In 2006 the election for the Rector of UII He participated in first direct election for the position being the fourth rank,  Edy Suandi Hamid having 284.5 votes,  Amir Mu’alim 92 votes, Luthfi Hasan, 87.5 votes.  Eddy Suandi Hamid came out as winner to lead the campus.  The next election for the position as the Vice Rector I to be in charge of academics it was between Jawahir Thontowi and Sarwidi which was a very close election and Sarwidi manages to be elected for the position having 309,5 votes compared to only 298,5 votes. Supporters of Jawahir Thontowi in campus still remain strong.

In 2010 election Jawahir Thontowi became in the running for the peak positions in campus again. Still competing versus Edy Suandi Hamid and Sarwidi,  the election process was very tight Edy Suandi Hamid with only 32 votes, Jawahir Thontowi 31 votes and Sarwidi 25 votes.  Interesting that in 2006 elections he lost to Sarwidi for the position but now in the 2010 he has more votes.

After losing from the selection process, he came back to the law faculty to continue to teach, practice what he has learned and implement his understanding about the law in Indonesia. This experience will be the foundations of the position in the future for the next election process in 2014 to become the rector of campus. To have the highest academic career in UII starting as a student activist, then becoming a researcher and lecturer, then become the dean of the law faculty and hope the next position becoming the rector.

[[File:Amazing stories 192911.jpg|thumb|right|Hansen's "The Undersea Tube", her first published story, took the cover of the November 1929 issue of ''[[Amazing Stories]]'']]

'''L. (Lucile) Taylor Hansen''' (November 30, 1897 – May 1976) was a writer of science fiction popular science articles and books who used a male writing persona for the early part of her career. She is the author of eight short stories, nearly sixty nonfiction articles popularizing [[anthropology]] and geology, and three nonfiction books.

==Early life==

An autobiographical sketch by Hansen begins with her memory of staying with her parents in an abandoned fort after the "Indian Wars." In 1919, she writes, she was initiated into an [[Ojibwe]] tribe after she suggested to the tribe that they not kill the agency doctor but instead protest his appointment to Washington administrators. She then enters into a lifelong project to study of Native American legends.

She attended classes at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] during the 1920s but did not receive a degree.&lt;ref name=Bleiler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bleiler|first1=Everett Franklin|title=Science-Fiction: The Gernsback Years|date=1998|publisher=[[Kent State University Press]]|isbn=0-87338-604-3|page=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PbMdeizaCNcC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;dq=%22L.+Taylor+Hansen%22+degree&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OEvgobLNOA&amp;sig=d1Rpfnbi7zUSAZKQ_jownC8g0N4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=k1R0VK2rKsKsaY-3grAB&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22L.%20Taylor%20Hansen%22%20degree&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Davin&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davin|first1=Eric Leif|title=Partners in Wonder: Women and the Birth of Science Fiction, 1926-1965|date=2005|publisher=[[Lexington Books]]|isbn=978-0-7391-1267-0|page=385|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoNDebTvUnsC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=%22L.+Taylor+Hansen%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KlV0VIacEIzoaNqrgIAK&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBQ#v=snippet&amp;q=Hansen%20%20&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science==

Starting with the September 1941 issue of ''Amazing,'' Hansen wrote "Scientific Mysteries," a regular column of non-fiction articles that continued until 1948. Combined with her other non-fiction articles, she wrote nearly sixty articles during this period, appearing from five to twelve times per year. Her first article picks up on the work of her father regarding the continental drift. She reviews criticisms of the theory and presents evidence that supports it, such as geologic continuities and homologous species that appear on different continents. She presents a field of researchers working together so that "the veils of mystery are being pushed back from the library which is the past."&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, L. Taylor. "Gondwanaland, the Mystery Continent of the Past." ''Amazing Stories,'' September 1941, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen credits this series of articles as being the start of her investigation of how the different stories of the Americas might have some common origins.

Hansen did not shy away from the controversial issues surrounding anthropology as the last vestiges of [[scientific racism]] fell away in the years before [[World War II]]. A July 1942 article, for instance, asserts that contemporary "standards of color are far too superficial." She points out that the skull shape of the Mayans, which would have supported the [[Craniometry|craniometric]] proposition that races differ culturally because of their distinctive skull geometries, does not "affect their intelligence." While she reports on findings that are now not credible – such as the idea that the population of Africa is a recently evolved type – she is remarkable for suggesting that Africans are not primitive but more evolved than other human types.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, L. Taylor. "The White Race—Does It Exist?", ''Amazing Stories,'' July 1942, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Hansen begins experimenting with pseudonyms. The article "America's Mysterious Race of Indian Giants" appeared in the December 1946 issue of ''Amazing,'' and while the writing style was "recognizable as that of columnist L. Taylor Hansen," it was credited to "Chief Sequoyah."&lt;ref&gt;Professor Solomon, ''Visitors to the Inner Earth.'' Top Hat Press, 2011, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; A second story by Chief Sequoyah, "Spirit of the Serpent God," appeared in the June 1948 issue of ''Amazing.'' The story "The Fire-Trail," credited to a Navaho Oge-Make, appeared in the January 1948 issue of ''Amazing.'' She also credited a second story to Oge-Make, "Tribal Memories of the Flying Saucers," that appeared in another magazine Palmer edited, [[Fate (magazine)|Fate]], in the September 1949 issue.

As she completed her survey of Native American legends, Hansen published three nonfiction books. The first, ''Some Considerations of and Additions to the Taylor-Wegener Hypothesis of Continental Displacement'' (1946), details the elaboration of the continental drift theory proposed by Frank Bursley Taylor. Her second book, ''He Walked the Americas'' (1963), is a frequently cited taxonomy of Native American legends that report of a light-skinned prophet. Her last book, ''The Ancient Atlantic'' (1969), surveys the culture and geography of the Atlantic Ocean and touches on the legend of [[Atlantis]].

Hansen wrote the book ''He Walked the Americas'' in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;L. Taylor Hansen, He walked the Americas, Amherst Press, 1963&lt;/ref&gt; In the book drawing from [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[legend]]s, [[folklore]] and [[mythology]] discussed that a "White Prophet" had visited many different parts of America.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh1WHqo0JN8C&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=he+walked+the+americas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bKL3TeCpDcq38QPQn73XCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-preview-link&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDUQuwUwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=he%20walked%20the%20americas&amp;f=false Taylor discussed in Lost Cities of North and Central America By David Hatcher Childress]&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Mormons]] have used this book as evidence supporting the [[Book of Mormon]], which depicts Christianity practiced in the ancient Americas, including a visitation of the resurrected Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Waylon Gary White Deer | title=Touched by Thunder | publisher=Routledge | year=2016 | page=76 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jvVmDAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=%22he%20walked%20the%20americas%22%20mormon&amp;pg=PA76#v=twopage&amp;q=%22he%20walked%20the%20americas%22&amp;f=false | accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Rex E.

==Science Fiction==
[[File:L Taylor Hansen fake WS3010.jpg|thumb|right|The image used to conceal Hansen's sex in ''[[Wonder Stories]]'' in 1930]]
Hansen's science fiction career was brief, but she is notable for being an early woman in the genre who concealed her sex. Her first story, "What the Sodium Lines Revealed," appeared in [[Hugo Gernsback]]'s ''Amazing Stories Quarterly'' in the Winter 1929 issue. This story, while a Gernsback-era adventure, hinges upon scientific ideas in that a message is detected in a spectrograph by an amateur astronomer.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, L. Taylor. "What the Sodium Lines Revealed." ''Amazing Stories Quarterly,'' Winter 1929.&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, her second story "The Undersea Tube," details an underground civilization that is uncovered while developing a pneumatic commuter train between New York and Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, L. Taylor. "The Undersea Tube." ''Amazing Stories,'' November 1929.&lt;/ref&gt;

As asserted by Eric Leif Davin, of the women in the early science fiction magazines, only L. Taylor Hansen seems to have concealed her sex.&lt;ref&gt;Davin, Eric Leif. ''Partners in Wonder: Women and the Birth of Science Fiction, 1926–1965.'' New York: Lexington Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The subterfuge was extensive. An illustration of a young man, purportedly Hansen, appeared with Hansen's fifth story, "The City on the Cloud."&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, L. Taylor. "The City on the Cloud." ''Wonder Stories,'' October 1930, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen continued the subterfuge by asserting on the telephone to fan [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] that she was not the author of her stories but only handled them for her brother.&lt;ref&gt;Bleiler, Everett Franklin. ''Science-Fiction: The Gernsback Years,'' p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Jane Donawerth suggests that Hansen's creation of a world-traveled, male brother was a "probably social crisis" in that she did not want to violate the convention of a male narrator in science fiction and so her persona allows her to "protect herself from social disapproval."&lt;ref&gt;Donawerth, Jane. ''Frankenstein's Daughters: Women Writing Science Fiction,'' p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as reported by Davin, the facts of the encounter between Ackerman and Hansen are somewhat contradictory.&lt;ref&gt;Davin, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; A letter from Hansen was titled "L. Taylor Hansen Defends Himself" in the July 1943 issue of ''Amazing Stories,'' but Davin asserts this is because she was a private person and not because she was trying to maintain credibility. The editor, [[Raymond A. Palmer]], had "little trouble working with women" as evinced by the many women who were published in ''Amazing'' during the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;Davin, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Legal practice''' is sometimes used to distinguish the body of judicial or administrative [[precedent]]s, [[regulation|rule]]s, [[policy|policies]], [[Custom (law)|custom]]s, and [[doctrine]]s from legislative [[enactment (British legal term)|enactments]] such as [[statute]]s and [[constitution]]s which might be called "laws" in the strict sense of being commands to the general public, rather than only to a set of parties.&lt;ref&gt;''Anastasoff v. United States'', 223 F.3d 898, 903 (8th Cir. 2000). Discussed in "Precedent and Judicial Power after the Founding", Polly J. Price, ''Bostom College L.R.'', Vol. 42 No. 1, Dec. 2000, pg. 81-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==England from Henry II==

===Common law forms of pleading: Writs===

In the legal practice that emerged in royal courts under [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] any case had to fit into a narrowly defined form of pleading usually called a "writ". By the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] the number of such writs had grown to over 500, but even that many did not cover all the possible claims that people sought to make.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Rembar, ''The Law of the Land: The Evolution of Our Legal System'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1980. Pp. 172''ff''. {{ISBN|0-06-097219-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Provisions of Oxford]] in 1258 forbade the royal clerks to create any new writs. The result of this was that the courts began to adopt "fictions" such as imaginary parties or actors so that the facts of a case could be fit within one of the established forms, and the [[Writ of Trespass]] came to become the catchall form for most claims.&lt;ref&gt;Rembar, ''Law of the Land'', p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to understand that, unlike much current practice, the writs of pleading were not court orders granting relief but the [[summons]], prepared by the plaintiff, filed with the court, and served on the respondent.

==United States==

===U.S. Constitution===

The nonconflicting parts of the English and American common law and its forms of pleading were explicitly incorporated into the U.S. Constitution.

[[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventh Amendment]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In Suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Field Code 1848===

By the middle of the 19th century strong resistance developed to the rigidities of the common law forms of pleading brought over from England, whose monarchical forms often conflicted with U.S. republican law that made the people the [[sovereign]].

[[New York State]] was the first to adopt a codification of legal forms and procedures, called the [[Field Code]] from its principal author, [[David Dudley Field II]]. Within a few years, most but not all other states adopted similar codes. One of the reforms made was to unite courts of law and equity. The reforms made it easier to get a case started without loading most of the argument and proof at the outset, and made discovery more important during the course of the case. However, there was opposition to the reforms,&lt;ref&gt;Is Codification of the Law Expedient?, by William B. Hornblower. Address delivered before the American Social Science Association (Department of Jurisprudence) at Saratoga, N.Y., September 6, 1888. [http://www.constitution.org/cmt/hornblower/cod_law_over.pdf Link]&lt;/ref&gt; and resistance from the legal profession, including judges, that prevented the codes from being implemented as intended.

===Federal Rules 1938===

Before the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) were enacted in 1938, [[common law]] pleading was more formal, traditional, and particular in its phrases and requirements. For example, a plaintiff bringing a [[trespass]] suit would have to mention certain key words in his complaint or risk it being dismissed with prejudice. In contrast, the FRCP is based on a legal construction called '''[[notice pleading]]''', which is less formal, created and modified by legal experts, and far less technical in requirements. In notice pleading, the same plaintiff bringing suit would not face dismissal for lack of the exact legal term, so long as the claim itself was legally [[legal action|actionable]]. The policy behind this change is to simply give "notice" of your grievances, and leave the details for later in the case. This acts in the interest of [[Justice|equity]] by concentrating on the actual law and not the exact construction of pleas.

Thirty-five states have adopted versions of the federal rules as their own procedural code.

In addition to notice pleading, a minority of states (''e.g.'', [[California]]) use an intermediate system known as ''code pleading''. Code pleading is an older system than notice pleading and is based on legislative [[statute]]. It tends to straddle the gulf between obsolete common-law pleading and modern notice pleading. Code pleading places additional burdens on a party to plead the "ultimate facts" of its case, laying out the party's entire case and the facts or allegations underlying it. Notice pleading, by contrast, simply requires a "short and plain statement" showing only that the pleader is entitled to [[relief]]. (FRCP 8(a)(2)).  One important exception to this rule is that when a party alleges [[fraud]], that party must plead the [[fact]]s of the alleged fraud with particularity. (FRCP 9(b)).

There has been some controversy over whether the FCRP violate the Eighth Amendment requirement of common law rules, but the usual answer has been that the changes are only in form and not in substance.

A [[practical joke]] (also known as a prank, gag, jape or shenanigan) is a mischievous trick or [[joke]] played on someone, typically causing the victim to experience embarrassment, perplexity, confusion, or discomfort.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/practical%20joke?fromAsk=true&amp;o=100074 |title=Practical joke|publisher=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Practical jokes differ from [[confidence trick]]s or [[hoax]]es in that the victim finds out, or is let in on the joke, rather than being fooled into handing over money or other valuables. Practical jokes or pranks are generally lighthearted, reversible and non-permanent, and aim to make the victim feel foolish or victimised to a degree, but may also involve [[cruelty]] and become a form of [[bullying]] if performed without appropriate finesse.

==List of works==

===Tortall universe===
The Tortall universe is a fictional setting shared by five book series: [The] ''Song of the Lioness''; [The] ''Immortals, or Wild Magic''; ''Protector of the Small''; ''Daughter of the Lioness, or Tricksters''; and ''Beka Cooper'' (''Provost's Dog'') as well as multiple short stories.&lt;ref name=isfdb&gt;
[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?867 "Tamora Pierce – Summary Bibliography"]. [[Internet Speculative Fiction Database]] ('''ISFDB'''). Retrieved 2013-03-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Setting'''

The Tortall series is named for the country in which the majority of the works are set, Tortall. The capital of Tortall is Corus, located near the western coast on the Emerald Ocean.
To the north is Scanra, a wild and somewhat barbaric country. Tortall and Scanra are at war in the last two Protector books and the first Trickster book, ''Trickster's Choice''. To the east are Galla, Tusaine, and Tyra, and past them are Maren and Sarain. Carthak (setting for ''Emperor Mage'') is south of Tortall across the Inland Sea, while to the west lie the Yamani Islands and the Copper Isles. To the east of Maren and Sarain is The Roof of the World, a large mountain range. The Trickster books mostly take place in the Copper Isles, further south than the Yamani islands.

''The Hunt Records'' take place hundreds of years before the other books, and Barzun, a nation between Tortall and the Inland Sea later is occasional mentioned. Barzun was later conquered by Tortall.

Tortall is a place somewhat reminiscent of the European Middle Ages, with its monarchy, court, nobility, and knights, but is otherwise a completely different world. Magic is very real and practical to Tortallans, from the common hedgewitch to the King's court mages. Deities are revered and often play a part in human lives, sometimes choosing humans as champions, sometimes using them to further their own purposes. Though these deities are shown as powerful beyond belief, they rely on their human instruments to shape the world.

====''The Song of the Lioness''====
{{main article|The Song of the Lioness}}  
&lt;!-- full synopsis found in separate article --&gt;

''The Song of The Lioness'' was originally written as one single book for adults, but her literary agent suggested that she rewrite it into four books aimed at a young adult audience.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamora-pierce.com/bio.html |title=Tamora Pierce Biography |accessdate=2013-08-15 |last=Pierce |first=Tamora |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130613183932/http://www.tamora-pierce.com/bio.html |archivedate=2013-06-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierce literally cut up the manuscript&lt;ref name="bio"/&gt; and used the pieces to form four new books for teenagers. She has received numerous requests to publish the original manuscript, but claims it no longer exists, and wouldn't be worth publishing anyway.

'''Plot'''

[[Alanna (The Song of the Lioness)|Alanna of Trebond]] (later Alanna of Pirate's Swoop and Olau) is a ground-breaking female knight. Although noble-born girls traditionally go to the convent to learn how to be proper noblewomen and wives, Alanna desires to become a knight, a position only given to noble-born boys. In order to achieve her dream, Alanna disguises herself as a boy under the name of Alan and goes to the palace in place of her twin brother Thom. As Thom has no interest in becoming a knight, and is far more interested in his magic, Thom forges a letter so that he can go to a temple to become an enormously strong and skilled sorcerer.

The series follows Alanna's training and the early years of her full knighthood, a time-span of ten years. Alanna has quite a few strong [[romantic relationship]]s throughout the series, including Prince Jonathan, George Cooper, and Liam Ironarm, the Shang (a martial arts society) Dragon.

*''[[Alanna: The First Adventure]]'' (1983) – Alanna, a young [[nobility|noble]] girl, disguises herself as a boy with the help of her [[twin]] brother, Thom, in order to realize her dream of becoming a [[knight]] as Thom goes to a temple to become a mage. She makes powerful friends, including the crown prince and the Rogue (king of the thieves), along with tremendously powerful and dangerous enemies.
*''[[In the Hand of the Goddess]]'' (1984) – Finding life as a knight-in-training more difficult than she imagined but still in her disguise, Alanna serves as a [[squire]] to Prince Jonathan of Conté, fights in a war alongside her knight master and struggles with the attention of the evil [[Duke]] [[Roger of Conté]] all the while struggling to find her identity as a woman, in tandem with her dreams of becoming a knight.
*''[[The Woman Who Rides Like a Man]]'' (1986), Alternate title: The Girl Who Rides Like a Man – After rightfully gaining her knight's shield, "Sir Alanna" travels south, meeting up with a [[Bazhir]] tribe. She learns to reconcile with her magic, a part of her she formerly despised, and becomes a shaman. Jonathan also becomes "The Voice," an honored Bazhir figure who is able to speak to every one who has performed the traditional Bazhir rituals. By doing this, he reconciles the Bazhir, who have long resented the Conté rule, to the capital city of Corus. Jonathan and Alanna also fight, and break up. Alanna soon finds another relationship with George, the Rogue, but continues to struggle with her romantic feelings for Jonathan, who has gone on to court a "proper woman," a princess of the Copper Isles.
*''[[Lioness Rampant]]'' (1988) – Alanna travels to the "Roof of the World" in search of the mystically powerful Dominion Jewel in order to prove her worth as the first female knight in centuries. The Dominion Jewel is a legendary magical artifact rumored to unite any ruler who holds it with the land that he or she rules. During this journey she meets Princess Thayet, her bodyguard Buri, and the Shang Dragon, whom she develops a strong romantic relationship with, despite his open fear of magic. She later returns to Tortall to face an old nemesis, who threatens the entire kingdom.
* The omnibus edition of this quartet is ''Song of the Lioness'' (without 'The'), published in 2002 by Science Fiction Book Club (SFBC).&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;

====''The Immortals''====
{{main article|The Immortals (series)}}
This quartet is also called ''Wild Magic'' after its first volume, published by Atheneum in 1992. The story features [[Veralidaine Sarrasri|Veralidaine (Daine) Sarrasri]] who was orphaned when raiders attacked her village. Daine has an unusual (and extremely strong) gift of wild magic which is mistaken for insanity because she is unable to control it. Though convinced she has no magical Gift, it is discovered that she has 'wild magic' – a magic that is not uncommon, but for some reason is a disregarded branch of magic. What is rare is the amount of it that Daine possesses, and what she is able to do with it. This magic gives her a unique connection with animals. Her abilities manifest gradually throughout the series, allowing her first to speak with animals, to heal their injuries and eventually to shape-shift into animal forms. The series covers a timespan of four years, following Daine as she learns to communicate with humans, animals, and [[legendary creature|Immortals]].

*''[[Wild Magic]]'' (1992) – Daine, a 13-year-old girl, finds out that her knack with wild animals is in fact a rare and powerful form of magic. Under the guidance of [[Numair Salmalín]] (the most powerful mage in Tortall), she learns to control her magic, which proves very important for herself and her companions. This first novel in the quartet also reunites us briefly with the protagonist of the Song of the Lioness quartet, Alanna of Pirate's Swoop and Olau, formerly [[Alanna of Trebond]].
*''[[Wolf-Speaker]]'' (1994) – Daine travels with Numair to meet a pack of wolves that she knew from her home village.  The wolves show her that the valley containing their home range is being devastated, and this is eventually connected with a treasonous conspiracy against her adopted king and country.
*''[[Emperor Mage]]'' (1995) – Daine joins a delegation of Tortallan diplomats sent to Carthak, where she finally meets the Emperor [[The Immortals (series)#Characters|Ozorne]], who had previously attempted to execute her teacher Numair. Daine is caught up in a strange battle involving displeased gods and strange magics.
*''[[The Realms of the Gods]]'' (1996) – Caught in a mysterious attack, Daine and Numair are snatched into the Divine Realms and struggle to make their way back to [[Tortall]], where war is raging again. While in the Divine Realms, Daine discovers Numair's true feelings for her and works out her own.  This book takes place in both the Divine (Immortal) and mortal realms.
* The Omnibus Edition is ''The Immortals'' (SFBC, 2003).&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;

====''Protector of the Small''====
{{main article|Protector of the Small}}
The story features [[Keladry of Mindelan]], the first girl to follow in Alanna's footsteps—legally and without disguise, after a law is passed allowing girls to try for knighthood. As she begins her training, Kel is constantly harassed, injured, plagued by doubters and put on probation by her training master, who thinks a girl will never succeed. Kel discovers the [[hazing]] of young [[page (occupation)|pages]] and fights the bullies to put a stop to it. Kel makes memorable friends throughout the series, including the wry Nealan of Queenscove, and also Lord Raoul of Goldenlake, an old friend of Alanna's. She meets some key enemies, including Joren of Stone Mountain, her fellow page. The series follows Kel's training and the first year of her knighthood, a timespan of nine years.

*''[[First Test]]'' (1999) – Keladry of Mindelan, the first openly female page, faces giant spidrens (Immortals, see the Immortals series), hazing, bullying and the mistrust of her superiors in her first probationary year as a page.
*''[[Page (Tamora Pierce novel)|Page]]'' (2000) – Kel, to the surprise of many, is allowed to complete her page's training. In this second book of the series Kel faces dangers that will change the way pages are taught.
*''[[Squire (Tamora Pierce novel)|Squire]]'' (2001) – In the second half of her training, Kel has a new master, [[Raoul of Goldenlake]], who gives her new duties, and teaches her new skills. Alongside her own study, Kel becomes increasingly involved with the war that brews on Tortall's northern border, and her fellow squire, Cleon of Kennan.
*''[[Lady Knight]]'' (2002) – Though she is now a knight, Kel is still inexperienced. She struggles with her sense of duty when her commanders assign her to manage a [[refugee camp]] instead of to the front lines. She struggles to find a balance between her duties and completing a quest assigned by The Chamber during her knighthood ordeal. 7th place for the 2003 Locus Best Young Adult Novel
* The Omnibus edition is ''Protector of the Small'' (SFBC, 2004).&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt;
* ''Bone's Day Out'' (2014) – a Tortall short story is only found in the 2014 ''Protecter of the Small'' omnibus and is part of the Protecter of the Small series of events

====''Tricksters''====
{{main article|Tricksters series}} 
This duology is also called ''Daughter of the Lioness'' from ''The Song of the Lioness'' four-book series. Its omnibus edition is ''Tricksters'' (SFBC, 2005).&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; It is actually as long as the earlier quartets, because these books are about twice the length of the earlier works. Pierce explained that the greatly huge, popular success of the seven [[Harry Potter]] books finally showed publishers that young readers will read big books.

The duology is the story of Alianne (Aly) of Pirate's Swoop, the 16-year-old daughter of the legendary Alanna the Lioness. Disallowed work as a Tortallan [[spy]] by her parents, Aly leaves home only to be captured by [[pirate]]s and sold into [[slavery]] in the Copper Isles. Under the guidance of Kyprioth, the god of tricksters, Aly involves herself with a conspiracy of the native ''raka'' people against their ''luarin'' conquerors, in accordance with a [[prophecy]] made by Kyprioth himself through one of his priestesses, centuries earlier. The duology covers a timespan of two years. Aly is a much different person from her mother, closer to her father.

*''[[Trickster's Choice]]'' (2003) – When Aly is taken by pirates, she is sold as a slave in the Copper Isles and makes a bet with the god Kyprioth, to protect the children of the Balitang family from unknown dangers. She soon learns that two of the daughters, Saraiyu Balitang (Sarai) and Dovasary Balitang (Dove), are linked to prophecy predicting that one of them will become a queen capable of uniting the luarin conquerors with the oppressed raka. She learns to speak to crows, and makes a wonderfully close and dear friend, Nawat Crow, a crow-turned-man. 7th place for the 2004 Locus Best Young Adult Book.
*''[[Trickster's Queen]]'' (2004) – Returning to the capital city Rajmuat after the Balitang's short exile, the raka conspirators in the Balitang household prepares to overthrow the century long Rittevon ruled throne and replace the vicious monarchs with a half raka, half luarin queen. Alianne, Alanna's daughter, is the conspiracy's spymaster.
* The Omnibus edition is ''Tricksters'' (2005)

====''Beka Cooper: The Hunt Records''====
{{main article|Beka Cooper}} 
This [[trilogy]] is also called Provost's Dog.&lt;ref name=isfdb/&gt; It is set in the realm of Tortall, 200 years before ''Alanna: The First Adventure''. Nominated for the 2012 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Children's Literature.

George Cooper is a young boy in the series prologue, and is caught stealing. His ashamed mother then tells him about his famous ancestress, named Rebakah Cooper. "Beka" Cooper is a trainee for the Provost's Guard, which is Tortall's equivalent of a police force. In those days, they were called "Dogs" and trainees were known as "Puppies," both of whom were stationed at "Kennels" (this was where the term "Provost's Dog" came from).

* ''[[Terrier (novel)|Terrier]]'', the first book in the series, was released on October 24, 2006. Terrier covers Beka's first months as a Puppy. All of Pierce's previous books were written in the third person, but this series is told from a diary-style first person perspective. Beka's entries detail how hard she works to try to make her home, the Lower City of Corus, safer. Beka's roots in the Lower City give her both a keen insight and a sense of empathy for the people she is there to protect. Beka is referred to as a "Terrier" for her youth and dogged determination despite her size.
* ''[[Bloodhound (novel)|Bloodhound]]'', the second book in this trilogy, was released on April 14, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tammypierce.livejournal.com/ |title=Dare to Be Stupid |publisher=Tammypierce.livejournal.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, we follow Beka to Port Caynn, where a secretive ring of cole-mongers threatens to destroy the country.
* ''[[Mastiff (novel)|Mastiff]]'', formerly titled ''Elkhound'', is the third and final book in the trilogy. It was released October 25, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamora-pierce.com/|title=Home – Tamora Pierce|website=Tamora Pierce}}&lt;/ref&gt; An excerpt from Mastiff is included in ''Tortall and Other Lands: A Collection of Tales''. After a devastating attack at the summer palace, Beka is assigned to recapture what was stolen, but a traitor will make the quest difficult. 12th place for the 2012 Locus Best Young Adult Book
* The Omnibus Edition is ''Beka Cooper: The Hunt Records'' (2012)

==== ''Tortall and Other Lands: A Collection of Tales'' ====

* ''Tortall and Other Lands: A Collection of Tales'' (2010) contains multiple short stories set in the Tortall Universe. It is a collection of all Tamora Pierce's short stories and contains all of those written as of its publication in 2010, with the exception of ''Slippery in the Stairwell, 1965'' (2009) For a complete listing see the '''Short Stories''' section.

==== ''The Numair Chronicles'' ====
The Numair Chronicles is a three-book series about the childhood of Arram Draper, who will grow up to be the Great Mage, Numair Salmalín.

* ''Tempests And Slaughter'', the first book in the series, was released February 6, 2018.

A must-have for any Tortall fan, it will also include the story of Aly's first mission – and the reason her parents refused to let her go on any others – along with illustrations of characters and "personnel files" kept by the Whisper Man himself&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17312145-a-spy-s-guide-to-tortall|title=Tortall|website=Goodreads}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamora-pierce.net/frequently-asked-questions/misc-faq/|title=Miscellaneous FAQ – Tamora Pierce|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Chronological order of all Tortall books and short stories ====

===Circle universe===

'''Setting''' 
The ''Circle of Magic'' quartet is set in the land of [[Emelan]]; the ''Circle Opens'' quartet and the ''Circle Reforged'' quartet are set in Emelan and various neighbouring countries. 
Neighboring countries include Sotat (east of Emelan; birthplace of Briar Moss), Qalai (north-east of Emelan), Lairan (north of Emelan), Gansar (north-west of Emelan), and Anderann (west of Emelan, birthplace of Dedicate Rosethorn). Other countries in the Circle universe include Chammur (setting of ''Street Magic''), Thairos (setting of ''Shatterglass''), Namorn (far north, setting of ''Cold Fire'' and ''The Will of the Empress''), Gyongxe (setting of Battle Magic), Yanjing (birthplace of Evumeimei Dingzai) Capchen (birthplace of Trisana Chandler), the Battle Islands (setting of Melting Stones), Hatar Island in the Pebbled Sea, Olart (north of the Pebbled Sea), and Mbau (south of the Pebbled Sea).

In the Circle universe, magic is common and regularly used, but individuals need to be born with the ability to use it. There are two forms of magic. Academic magic is directly linked to the energy within the user and may require incantations or physical catalysts. Ambient magic is less common, is associated with a certain craft (such as carpentry) or item of nature (such as lightning), and involves power from the surroundings flowing through the user. Most cultures in the Circle universe are polytheistic, but unlike the Tortall universe, gods less frequently try to affect mortal events.

====''Circle of Magic''====
{{main article|Circle of Magic}}

'''Plot'''
The series tells the stories of four 10-year-old children: [[Sandrilene fa Toren]], [[Trisana Chandler]], [[Daja Kisubo]] and [[Briar Moss]], known as Sandry, Tris, Daja, and Briar, respectively. They are discovered in various troubled circumstances and brought together by Niklaren Goldeye (referred to as Niko), a powerful mage, who tells them that they are "ambient mages," which means that they use magic derived from the environment. The four youths do not fit in with the other children of the monastic Winding Circle community to which Niko brings them and are put together in a separate cottage, called Discipline. Here they each learn of their hidden talents: Sandry with thread, Tris with weather, Daja with fire and metal, and Briar with plants. Lark, a gentle woman especially attentive to Sandry since she also has thread magic, and Rosethorn, a sharp woman who shares Briar's ability with plants, live with and instruct the children in their magical and personal growth. Also teaching and guiding them is Niko, technically Tris's teacher, but available to all four. Daja is taught by Dedicate Initiate Frostpine, a smith mage. At first it seems that a merchant, a street rat, a noblewoman, and a Trader (a trading race that is often hated by others) will never get along, but an extraordinary circumstance brings them together. Through an earthquake, they realize their full potential and are bound closely together forever. As children skilled in uncommon magics, they struggle to earn the respect of the adults they encounter and to fully understand and control their magical powers.

The '''London Charterhouse''' is a historic complex of buildings in [[Smithfield, London]], dating back to the 14th century. It occupies land to the north of [[Charterhouse Square]], and lies within the [[London Borough of Islington]]. 

The Charterhouse began as (and takes its name from) a [[Carthusian]] [[priory]], founded in 1371 and dissolved in 1537. Substantial fragments remain from this monastic period, but the site was largely rebuilt after 1545 as a large [[courtyard house]]. Thus, today it "conveys a vivid impression of the type of large rambling 16th century mansion that once existed all round London".&lt;ref name="Pevsner"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Bridget |last1=Cherry |authorlink1=Bridget Cherry |first2=Nikolaus |last2=Pevsner |authorlink2=Nikolaus Pevsner |title=London 4: North |series=[[Pevsner Architectural Guides|The Buildings of England]] |place=London |publisher=Penguin |year=1998 |isbn=0-14-071049-3 |pages=614–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Charterhouse was further altered and extended after 1611, when it became an [[almshouse]] and school, endowed by [[Thomas Sutton]]. The almshouse (a home for gentlemen pensioners) still occupies the site today under the name '''The Charterhouse'''; the school moved out in 1872 to [[Godalming]], Surrey, where it survives as [[Charterhouse School]] (although its formal name does not include the word "school").

==History==

===Priory===
In 1348, [[Walter de Manny]] rented {{convert|13|acre|km2|2|sing=on}} of land in Spital Croft, north of [[Long Lane, City of London|Long Lane]], from the Master and Brethren of [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] for a graveyard and plague pit for victims of the [[Black Death]]. A chapel and hermitage were constructed, renamed New Church Haw; but in 1371 this land was granted for the foundation of the London Charterhouse, a [[Carthusian]] monastery.&lt;ref name=Charter&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22116 ''Religious Houses: House of Carthusian monks''], ''A History of the County of Middlesex:'' Volume 1: ''Physique, Archaeology, Domesday, Ecclesiastical Organization, The Jews, Religious Houses, Education of Working Classes to 1870, Private Education from Sixteenth Century'' (1969), pp. 159–169.  accessed: 10 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The twenty-five monks each had their own small building and garden. [[Thomas More]] came to the monastery for spiritual recuperation. The name is derived as an Anglicisation of ''La Grande Chartreuse'', whose order founded the monastery.&lt;ref name=Charterhouse&gt;[http://www.charterhouse.org.uk/about/history/suttonshospital/suttons_hospital.asp Charterhouse history]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed 17 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The monastery was closed in 1537, in the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in the [[English Reformation]]. As it resisted dissolution the monastery was treated harshly: the [[Prior]], [[Saint John Houghton|John Houghton]] was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] and ten monks were taken to the nearby [[Newgate Prison]]; nine of these men starved to death and the tenth was executed three years later at [[Tower Hill, London|Tower Hill]]. They constitute the group known as the [[Carthusian Martyrs of London|Carthusian Martyrs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncregister.com/blog/kturley/the-london-charterhouse-murder-plague-and-martyrdom Turley, K.V., "The London Charterhouse: Murder, Plague and Martyrdom", ''National Catholic Register'', March 12, 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tudor Mansion===
For several years after the dissolution of the priory, members of the [[Jeronimo Bassano|Bassano]] family of instrument makers were amongst the tenants of the former monks' cells, whilst Henry VIII stored hunting equipment in the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Lasocki |title=The Anglo-Venetian Bassano family as instrument makers and repairers |journal=Galpin Society Journal |volume=38 |year=1985 |pages=112–32 }}&lt;/ref&gt; But, in 1545, the entire site was bought by [[Edward North, 1st Baron North|Sir Edward (later Lord) North]] (c. 1496–1564), who transformed the complex into a luxurious mansion house. North demolished the church and built the Great Hall and adjoining Great Chamber.&lt;ref name="Pevsner"/&gt; In 1558, during North's occupancy, [[Queen Elizabeth I]] used the house during the preparations for her [[coronation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecharterhouse.org/blog/queen-elizabeth-i-charterhouse/|title=Queen Elizabeth I at the Charterhouse|date=28 November 2017|publisher=The Charterhouse|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following North's death, the property was purchased by [[Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk]], who renamed it '''Howard House'''. In 1570, following his imprisonment in the [[Tower of London]] for scheming to marry [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], Norfolk was placed under house arrest at the Charterhouse. He occupied his time by embellishing the house, and built a long terrace in the garden (which survives as the "Norfolk Cloister") leading to a tennis court.&lt;ref name="Pevsner"/&gt; In 1571, Norfolk's involvement in the [[Ridolfi plot]] was exposed after a ciphered letter from Mary, Queen of Scots was discovered under a doormat in the house; he was executed the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb |first=Michael A. R. |last=Graves |title=Howard, Thomas, fourth duke of Norfolk (1538–1572) |origyear=2004 |year=2008 |edition=online |id=13941 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The property passed to Norfolk's son, [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk]]. During his occupancy, [[James I of England|James I]] held court there on his first entrance into London in 1603.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4c8_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=King+James+I++Charterhouse+1603&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5Un9Lf5BHi&amp;sig=MHLK7GrDRttZIq6fF1oV9xEwdKI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_hubR24rcAhUCVsAKHVyvDSoQ6AEIrgEwFA#v=onepage&amp;q=King%20James%20I%20%20Charterhouse%201603&amp;f=false|title=The Progresses, Processions, and Magnificent Festivities of King James the First|first=John |last=Nichols|year=1828|publisher=J. B. Nichols|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Almshouse and school===
[[Image:A View of the Charter House Taken from the Green 1813.jpg|thumb|left|''A View of the Charter House taken from the Green'', 1813]]
In May 1611 it came into the hands of [[Thomas Sutton]] (1532–1611) of [[Knaith]], [[Lincolnshire]]. He was appointed Master of Ordnance in Northern Parts, and acquired a fortune by the discovery of [[coal]] on two estates which he had leased near [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], and later, upon moving to London, he carried on a commercial career. Before he died on 12 December of that year, he endowed a hospital on the site of the Charterhouse, calling it the Hospital of King James; and in his will he bequeathed money to maintain a chapel, hospital ([[almshouse]]) and school.&lt;ref name=sh&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.charterhouse.org.uk/about-us/suttons-hospital|title=Sutton's Hospital|publisher=Charterhouse|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Case of Sutton's Hospital]]'',&lt;ref&gt;(1612) 77 Eng Rep 960&lt;/ref&gt; his will was hotly contested but upheld in court, meaning the foundation was constituted to afford a home for eighty male pensioners ("gentlemen by descent and in poverty, soldiers that have borne arms by sea or land, merchants decayed by piracy or shipwreck, or servants in household to the King or Queens Majesty"), and to educate forty boys.&lt;ref name=sh/&gt;

Charterhouse early established a reputation for excellence in hospital care and treatment, thanks in part to [[Henry Levett]], M.D., an Oxford graduate who joined the school as physician in 1712. Levett was widely esteemed for his medical writings, including an early tract on the treatment of [[smallpox]]. He was buried in Charterhouse Chapel, and his widow married [[Andrew Tooke]], the master of Charterhouse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9RIJAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22henry+levett%22+charterhouse&amp;source=web&amp;ots=UrPwCJ6g8h&amp;sig=cogs9fe5CtuDXMAqlNwFVg6rRms&amp;hl=en#PPA21,M1 The Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London, 1861]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Ga8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=%22henry+levett%22+charterhouse&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JGUi-Dn7ID&amp;sig=OXXcDHCNT_LjnmI50BrZH0E3R4A&amp;hl=en The Roll of the Royal College of Physicians of London, 1878]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The school, [[Charterhouse School]], developed beyond the original intentions of its founder, to become a well-regarded [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]]. In 1872, under the headmastership of {{Abbreviation|Rev.|The Reverend}} [[William Haig Brown]], the school moved to new buildings in the parish of [[Godalming]] in Surrey, opening on 18 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/education/charterhouse.html|title=Charterhouse|first=Jacqueline |last=Banerjee|publisher=Victorian Web|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
Following the departure of Charterhouse School, its buildings, on the site of the former monastic great cloister, were taken over by [[Merchant Taylors' School, Northwood|Merchant Taylors' School]], until that moved out in turn in 1933 to a new site near [[Northwood, London|Northwood]], [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merchant-taylors.co.uk/our-activities/education/|title=The Company's Role in Education|publisher=The Merchant Taylors' Company|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school buildings then became home to the [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] Medical School, and (though now much redeveloped) remain one of the sites occupied by its successor, [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]]. The main part of the cloister garth continues to be a well-tended site mostly laid to lawn in the quadrangle of the university site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://londongardensonline.org.uk/gardens-online-record.php?ID=ISL068|title=St Bartholomew's Medical College Green|publisher=London Gardens Online|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal historic buildings of the Charterhouse were severely damaged by enemy action in May 1941, during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. They were sensitively restored between 1950 and 1959 under the direction of the architects [[Henry John Alexander Seely, 2nd Baron Mottistone|John Seely]] and [[Paul Edward Paget|Paul Paget]], an exercise which allowed the exposure and embellishment of some [[medieval]] and much 16th- and 17th-century fabric that had previously been concealed or obscured.&lt;ref&gt;Oswald 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In preparation for and in conjunction with the restoration project, archaeological investigations were carried out by [[W. F. Grimes]], which led to a greatly enhanced understanding of the layout of the monastic buildings, and the discovery of the remains of [[Walter de Manny]], the founder, buried in a lead coffin before the high altar of the monastic chapel. These remains were identified as Manny's beyond reasonable doubt by the presence in the coffin of a lead ''[[Bulla (seal)|bulla]]'' (seal) of [[Pope Clement VI]]: in 1351 Clement had granted Manny a licence to select his own deathbed [[confessor]], a document that would have been issued with just such a ''bulla'' attached.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles and Grimes 1954, esp. pp. 48–49, 87–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Charterhouse continues to serve as an almshouse to 40 male pensioners, known as Brothers, who are in need of financial and companionship support. The complex is open for pre-booked guided tours; and the chapel can be viewed as part of the annual [[Open House London]] event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecharterhouse.org/joining-the-community/|title=Joining the Community|publisher=The Charterhouse|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revealing the Charterhouse===
In partnership with the [[Museum of London]] the Charterhouse has opened up the site to the public. There are three key elements to the project: a new museum, which tells the story of the Charterhouse from the [[Black Death]] to the present day; a Learning Room and Learning Programme so that school groups can discover how the Charterhouse has been home to everyone from monks and monarchs to schoolboys and Brothers; and a newly landscaped Charterhouse Square open to the public so that more people can enjoy the green surroundings.&lt;ref name="thecharterhouse.org"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Revealing the Charterhouse - the Charterhouse|url = http://www.thecharterhouse.org/revealing-charterhouse/|accessdate = 2015-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Works for this project were completed and opened to the public in January 2017.  Guided tours are available.&lt;ref name="thecharterhouse.org"/&gt;

==Local government==
Charterhouse was considered to be an [[extra-parochial area]] and was not incorporated or included in a district of parishes by the [[Metropolis Management Act 1855]]. In 1858, following the [[Extra-Parochial Places Act 1857]], it effectively became a [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]] for all purposes, with the provision that it would not form part of any [[poor law union]]. It was later added to the Holborn union in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V9FRDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA228&amp;lpg=PA228&amp;dq=charterhouse+holborn+union+1877&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mYgeXyawrg&amp;sig=d1gsYpiWOgknmcs_Obg8E4qqB64&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiu0ayz4orcAhWqAsAKHYeZDHIQ6AEIVzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=charterhouse%20holborn%20union%201877&amp;f=false|title=English Poor Law Policy|first1= Sidney |last1=Webb|first2=Beatrice |last2=Webb|publisher=Longmans, Green &amp; Co|year=1910|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900 it became part of the [[Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury]], and was abolished as a separate civil parish in 1915. Since 1965 it has been part of the [[London Borough of Islington]] in Greater London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://directory.islington.gov.uk/kb5/islington/directory/service.page?id=1QD2FDuTU8k|title=The Charterhouse|publisher=Islington Directory|accessdate=6 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bociurkiw was born in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] to Vera Anne (née Wasylyshyn)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Vera Bociurkiw.|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/edmontonjournal/obituary.aspx?pid=162368218#sthash.yTKW0p9G.dpuf|publisher=Edmonton Journal|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bohdan Rostyslav Bociurkiw,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bociurkiw|first1=Michael|title=A Personal Reflection Lives Lived: Bohdan R Bociurkiw, ,|journal=The Ukrainian Weekly|date=November 1, 1998|volume= LXVI|issue= 44|url=http://www.ukrweekly.com/old/archive/1998/449819.shtml|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corley|first1=Felix|title=Obituary: Professor Bohdan Bociurkiw|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-professor-bohdan-bociurkiw-1183010.html|accessdate=May 11, 2016|publisher=Independent|date=November 5, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bociurkiw, Bohdan|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CB%5CO%5CBociurkiwBohdan.htm|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine.|accessdate=May 11, 2016|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krawchuk|first1=Andrii|title=Church and State in the USSR: A Bio-Bibliography of Bohdan R.

Ukrainian history and culture were central to Bociurkiw's childhood, and instilled in her a sense of Ukrainian identity and history, as well as a desire to rewrite that history.&lt;ref&gt;Grekul, Lisa, "Pedagogies in Practice" in Sugars, Cynthia ed., ''Home-work: Postcolonialism, Pedagogy, and Canadian Literature'', University of Ottawa Press Ottawa: 2004. 378&lt;/ref&gt; This is a common thread throughout Bociurkiw's books, essays, and films: reflecting critically and intersectionally on what it means to be Ukrainian, Canadian, feminist, and lesbian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Grekul|editor-first1=Lisa|editor-last2=Ledohowski|editor-first2=Lindy|title=Unbound: Ukrainian Canadians writing home|date=2016|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|pages=10–11|chapter=Introduction Ukrainian Canadian Poet-Pedagogues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==

Bociurkiw completed her Bachelor of Fine Arts (1982) at the [[NSCAD University|Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (NSCAD) University]]. While there, she discovered feminist art and the new field of video art. She studied with [[Bruce Barber]] and [[Garry Neill Kennedy]]. She was part of what Barber has called "the gathering momentum of a feminist movement at NSCAD",&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Bruce, "Introduction" in Barber ed., ''NSCAD: The 80's'' , Halifax: Anna Leonowens Gallery 2006. 10&lt;/ref&gt; co-founding the Women Artists' File at the NSCAD Library, which later inspired the Toronto-based Women's Art Resource Centre. She was active on the board of the Centre for Art Tapes in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], where she curated a Toronto-Halifax exchange of activist performance art entitled "Performance As Resistance" (1985), which featured [[Dub poetry|dub poets]] [[Lillian Allen]] and [[Clifton Joseph]], humourist [[Sheila Gostick]] and Halifax [[A cappella|a capella]] group Four The Moment.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Bruce, "Introduction" in Barber ed., NSCAD: The 80's , Halifax: Anna Leonowens Gallery 2006. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from NSCAD, she moved to Toronto and in 1983, collectively produced the documentary, ''Our Choice, A Tape About Teenage Mothers'' (Women's Media Alliance). In 1984, she co-founded the feminist video collective, Emma Productions, which produced several works, including ''No Small Change: The Story of the Eaton's Strike'' (dir. Ruth Bishop &amp; Marusya Bociurkiw 1985) and ''Bullets for a Revolution'' (dir. Marusya Bociurkiw 1988). These films were produced and screened in the context of the dynamic feminist media culture in 1980's Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;Masters, Philinda, "Women, Culture &amp; Communications", in Pierson, Ruth &amp; Griffin Cohen, Marjorie eds.,  ''Canadian Women's Issues: Volume I: Strong Voices'',  Lorimer 1993. 401.&lt;/ref&gt; These were followed by several single-authored works, including ''Unspoken Territory'', about the history of racial profiling in Canada; and the more recent ''This is Gay Propaganda: LGBT Rights and the War in Ukraine'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costa|first1=Daniela|title="This is Gay Propaganda" highlights LGBT life in Ukraine|url=http://www.afterellen.com/movies/447081-gay-propaganda-highlights-lgbt-life-ukraine|publisher=After Ellen|accessdate=May 11, 2016|date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This film uses interviews with LGBT Ukrainians to explore the role of queer activists in Ukraine's [[Euromaidan]] Revolution and the Russian occupation that followed. Bociurkiw's films have screened at film festivals on several continents.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Bociurkiw is also an award-winning writer and media studies scholar. Her narrative and critical writing have been widely published in such journals and collections as Border/Lines, [[Fuse (magazine)|Fuse]], [[Rites (magazine)|Rites Magazine]], The Journey Prize Anthology ([[McClelland &amp; Stewart]]), Dykewords (Women's Press), Queer Looks ([[Routledge]]), Two Lands, New Vision (Coteau) and Unbound: Ukrainian Canadians Writing Home (University of Toronto Press). In 1994, Bociurkiw published her first book, ''The Woman Who Loved Airports'' (Press Gang) a collection of short stories, followed by a poetry collection, ''Halfway to the East'' (Lazara Press 1999). In 1999, she completed an MA in Social and Political Thought, at [[York University]] (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Bociurkiw's creative and scholarly careers have always been intertwined. While teaching sessional positions, completing a PhD in Interdisciplinary Studies at the [[University of British Columbia]] (2005) and later working as a Professor in the [[Radio and Television Arts|Radio and Television Arts (RTA) School of Media]], [[Ryerson University]] (2007 to present), she completed her first novel, ''The Children of Mary'' (Inanna 2006), and her award-winning memoir, ''Comfort Food for Breakups'' (Arsenal 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Falkner|first1=Julie|title=Book Reviews: Comfort Food for Breakups. |url=https://www.forewordreviews.com/reviews/comfort-food-for-breakups/|publisher=Foreword Reviews|accessdate=May 11, 2016|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, she published the academic book, ''Feeling Canadian: Television Nationalism &amp; Affect'' (Wilfrid Laurier University Press).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yates|first1=Dana|title=New book tracks television's role in Canadian nationalism. |url=http://www.ryerson.ca/news/news/Research_News/20110414_tv.html|publisher=[[Ryerson University]]|accessdate=May 11, 2016|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bociurkiw promotes feminist and anti-racist pedagogy and research through [[the Studio for Media Activism &amp; Critical Thought]], a research hub at Ryerson University that blurs the boundaries between media art, activism, and scholarly investigation. It organizes a yearly speakers' series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://theeyeopener.com/2015/03/dames-making-games-at-ryerson/ |first1=Richa |last1=Syal |first2=Truman |last2=Kwan |website=The Eyeopener |title=Dames making games at Ryerson |date=23 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; symposia, student mentorship, and an online graduate journal. In 2015, the Studio's Speaker Series—which is open to Ryerson students, faculty and the public—featured Indigenous Scholar, Dr. Raven Sinclair; media artist, [[Deanna Bowen]]; anti-poverty activists, [[Cathy Crowe]] and Dr. Alex Abramovitch; and disability studies scholar and activist, Dr. Eliza Chandler.

==Activism==

As founder of the feminist video collective Emma Productions, and as an out queer, Bociurkiw was very active in the Toronto and Vancouver [[feminist movement]], peace, and [[LGBT social movements]] throughout the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. In the 1980s, she was active in Women's Action for Peace, International Women's Day Coalition, the pro-choice movement, the Latin American solidarity movement, and Women for Economic Justice While living in Montreal, she co-designed and co-taught the first course on LGBT cinema in Canada, at [[Concordia University]], with [[Thomas Waugh]]. She was among the first group of women in Canada to enter the male-dominated field of media art, and to use film and video to draw attention to women's, labour and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;Beard, William, &amp; White, Jerry, ''North of Everything: English Canadian Cinema Since 1980'', Edmonton: University of Alberta Press 2002. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bociurkiw's most recent film—''This is Gay Propaganda: LGBT Rights and the War in Ukraine—''highlights the role of LGBT activists in the 2013 [[Euromaidan]] and [[2014 Ukrainian revolution]], which culminated in the expulsion of Ukrainian President [[Viktor Yanukovych]]. LGBT people in Ukraine had a lot to lose from the rise of Russian political influences there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costa|first1=Daniela|title="This is Gay Propaganda" highlights LGBT life in Ukraine|url=http://www.afterellen.com/movies/447081-gay-propaganda-highlights-lgbt-life-ukraine|publisher=AfterEllen|accessdate=May 11, 2016|date=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the illegal occupation and [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] in 2014—bringing it under the [[Russian LGBT propaganda law]]—many LGBT Ukrainians from [[Crimea]] and [[Donetsk]] were forced to flee to safe houses in [[Kiev]] and [[Odessa]]. Though the law criminalizing same sex sexual activity under Soviet Union law was revoked when Ukraine achieved independence in 1991, there remains a high level of social censure. Political leaders in Ukraine, before and after Euromaidan, have been reluctant to pass anti-discrimination legislation, despite pressure to comply with the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]]. After many delays, a law banning workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity was finally passed on November 12, 2015. Russian and religious influences continue to threaten the safety and social recognition of LGBT people in Ukraine. Bociurkiw's film draws attention to this struggle and gives voice to the heroes of the [[LGBT rights in Ukraine|Ukrainian LGBT rights]] movement.

Bociurkiw continues to engage in activist research, teaching, and production; initiating courses like Social Justice Media and #Activism. In 2016, she published the article "Big Affect: The Ephemeral Archive of Second Wave Feminist Video Collectives in Canada," the result of several years' research into Canadian feminist media history and its intersections with broadcast technologies and activism.&lt;ref&gt;Camera Obscura 2016 Volume 31, Number 3 93: 5-33&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people{{Who|date=August 2018}} of different faiths used violence in order to harass and persecute people who adhered to different religious beliefs. The members of the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (LDS), especially in its early history, were both the victims and perpetrators of violence in much the same way as were the followers of other major [[religion]]s.{{cn|date=March 2018}} [[Mormons]] were violently persecuted and pushed from [[Ohio]] to [[Missouri]], from Missouri to [[Illinois]] and from Illinois, they were pushed west to the [[Utah Territory]]. There were [[Haun's Mill massacre|incidents of massacre]], home burning and pillaging, followed by the death of their founder, [[Joseph Smith]]. Smith died from multiple gunshot wounds in a gun battle while jailed in Carthage; Smith defended himself with a small pistol smuggled to him by Cyrus Wheelock while trying protect himself against an illegal mob.  There were also notable incidents in which Mormons perpetrated violence.  Under the direction of Mormon prophets and apostles, Mormons [[1838_Mormon_War#Daviess_County_expedition|burned and looted Daviess County]], [[Battle of Crooked River|attacked and killed members of the Missouri state militia]], and [[Battle at Fort Utah|carried out an extermination order on the Timpanogos]].  Other Mormon leaders lead the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]], [[Battle Creek massacre]], and [[Black Hawk War (1865–72)#Circleville Massacre|Circleville Massacre]].  Mormons have also been a major part in several wars, including the [[1838 Mormon War]], [[Walker War]] and [[Black Hawk War (Utah)|Black Hawk War]].

The memory of this violence has affected both the [[history of the Latter Day Saint movement|history]] and the doctrines of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]].&lt;ref name="Bagley2004"&gt;{{Citation |title= [[Blood of the Prophets]] |last= Bagley |first= Will |authorlink= Will Bagley |publisher= [[University of Oklahoma Press]] |year= 2004 |page= xvii |isbn= 978-0-8061-3639-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of religious violence against Mormons==
{{Refimprove|date=August 2018}}
Early Mormon history is marked by many instances of violence, which have helped to shape the church's views on violence. The first significant instance occurred in [[Missouri]]. Mormons who lived there tended to vote as a bloc, which often lead to the unseating of the local political leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Monroe |first= R.D. |contribution= Congress and the Mexican War, 1844-1849 |title= Lincoln's Biography |series= Lincoln/Net: Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project |publisher= [[Northern Illinois University]] Libraries |contribution-url= http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/biography4text.html |accessdate= 2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences culminated in hostilities and the eventual issuing of an [[Executive order#State governor executive orders|executive order]] (often called the [[Extermination Order (Mormonism)|Extermination Order]]) by Missouri [[governor]] [[Lilburn Boggs]] declaring "the Mormons must be treated as enemies, and must be exterminated or driven from the State." Three days later, a militia unit [[Haun's Mill massacre|attacked a Mormon settlement at Haun's Mill]], resulting in the death of 18 Mormons and no militiamen. The Extermination Order was not formally rescinded until 1976.

In [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], conflict was often based on the tendency of Mormons to "dominate community, economic, and political life wherever they landed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= VandeCreek |first= Drew E. |contribution= Religion and Culture |title= Historical Themes |series= Lincoln/Net: Abraham Lincoln Historical Digitization Project |publisher= [[Northern Illinois University]] Libraries |contribution-url= http://lincoln.lib.niu.edu/religionculture.html |accessdate= 2012-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of Nauvoo had become the largest in Illinois, the city council was predominantly Mormon, and the [[Nauvoo Legion]] (the Mormon [[militia]]) continued to grow. Other issues of contention included [[polygamy]], [[freedom of speech]], [[History of slavery in the United States#Anti-Slavery|anti-slavery]] views during Smith’s presidential campaign, and the [[Criticism of Mormonism#The nature of divinity|deification of man]]. After the destruction of the press of the ''[[Nauvoo Expositor]]'', Joseph Smith was arrested and incarcerated in [[Carthage Jail]] where [[Death of Joseph Smith, Jr.|he was killed by a mob]] on June 27, 1844. The conflict in [[Illinois]] became so severe that most of the residents of Nauvoo fled across the [[Mississippi River]] in February 1846.

After Mormons established a community hundreds of miles away in the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in 1847, anti-Mormon activists in the [[Utah Territory]] convinced President [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]] that the Mormons in the territory were rebelling against the United States under the direction of [[Brigham Young]]. &lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, W. (2008). Buchanan's Thrust from the Pacific:The Utah War's Ill-Fated Second Front. ''Journal of Mormon History,34''(4), 226-260. &lt;/ref&gt;In response in 1857 Buchanan sent one-third of United States's standing army to Utah in what is known as the [[Utah War]]. During the Utah War, the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]] occurred.

==Mormon views on capital punishment==
===Capital punishment in Mormon scripture===

Religious justification for [[capital punishment]] is not unique to Mormonism {{Harv|Gardner|1979|p=10}}.

===Retribution===
[[File:GeneralJosephSmithAddress-JohnHafen.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Joseph Smith]] did not teach blood atonement, but taught a "blood for blood" law of God's retribution, stating that if he could enact a death penalty law, "I am opposed to [[hanging]], even if a man kill another, I will shoot him, or cut off his head, spill his blood on the ground and let the smoke ascend thereof up to God...." {{Harv|Roberts|1909|p=296}}.]]

[[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], was a strong proponent of capital punishment, and he favored execution methods that involved the shedding of blood as retribution for crimes of bloodshed. In 1843, he or his scribe commented that the common execution method in Christian nations was hanging, "instead of blood for blood according to the law of heaven."&lt;ref&gt;This statement is found in {{Harvnb|Roberts|1902|p=435}}, which was written by [[Willard Richards]]in 1843 {{Harv|Jessee|441}}. Years before making this remark, however, Smith was quoted as saying that the hanging of [[Judas Iscariot]] was not a suicide, but an execution carried out by [[Saint Peter]] {{Harv|Peck|1839|pp=26, 54–55}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 4, 1843, debate with church leader [[George A. Smith]], who argued against capital punishment,&lt;ref&gt;[[George A. Smith]] later changed his views on capital punishment, and would write the first criminal code in Utah which allowed both [[execution by firing squad]] and [[decapitation]] {{Harv|Gardner|1979|p=14}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith said that if he ever had the opportunity to enact a death penalty law, he "was opposed to hanging" the convict; rather, he would "shoot him, or cut off his head, spill his blood on the ground, and let the smoke thereof ascend up to God" {{Harv|Roberts|1909|p=296}}. In the church's April 6, 1843, [[general conference (Latter Day Saints)|general conference]], Smith said he would "wring a thief's neck off if I can find him. if I cannot bring him to justice any other way."&lt;ref&gt;first manuscript version, minutes of general conference, LDS Archives. See {{Harvnb|Quinn|1997|p=531, n.140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sidney Rigdon]], Smith's counselor in the [[First Presidency]], also supported capital punishment involving the spilling of blood, stating, "There are men standing in your midst that you cant do anything with them but cut their throat &amp; bury them."&lt;ref&gt;April 6, 1844, statement compiled on April 24, 1844, by [[Thomas Bullock (Mormon)|Thomas Bullock]], LDS Church Archives. See {{Harvnb|Quinn|1997|p=531, n.140}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Smith was willing to tolerate the presence of men "as corrupt as [[Satan|the devil himself]]" in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], who "had been guilty of [[murder]] and [[robbery]]," in the chance that they might "come to the waters of [[baptism]] through [[repentance]], and redeem a part of their allotted time" {{Harv|Roberts|1932}}.

[[Brigham Young]], Smith's successor in the LDS Church, initially held views on capital punishment that were similar to those of Smith. On January 27, 1845, he spoke approvingly of Smith's toleration of "corrupt men" in Nauvoo who were guilty of murder and robbery on the chance that they might repent and be baptized {{Harv|Roberts|1932}}. On the other hand, on February 25, 1846, after the Saints had left Nauvoo, Young threatened adherents who had stolen wagon cover strings and rail timber with having their throats cut "when they get out of the settlements where his orders could be executed"{{Harv|Roberts|1932|p=597}}. Later that year, Young gave orders that "when a man is found to be a thief,... cut his throat &amp; thro' him in the River."&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Thomas Bullock, 13 December 1846.&lt;/ref&gt; Young also stated that the [[decapitation]] of repeated sinners "is the law of God &amp; it shall be executed."&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Willard Richards, Dec. 20, 1846; Watson, Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 1846-1847, p. 480.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no documented instances of such a sentence being carried out on the [[Mormon Trail]].

In the [[Salt Lake Valley]], Young acted as the executive authority while the [[Council of Fifty]] acted as a legislature. One of his main concerns in the early Mormon settlement was theft, and he swore that "a thief{{Sic}} should not live in the Valley, for he would cut off their heads or be the means of haveing{{Sic}} it done as the Lord lived."&lt;ref&gt;Diary of Mary Haskin Parker Richards, 16 Apr. 1848.&lt;/ref&gt; A Mormon listening to one of Young's sermons in 1849 recorded that he said that "if any one was catched stealing to shoot them dead on the spot and they should not be hurt for it."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Davis diary, 8 July 1849, LDS archives, quoted in {{Harv|Quinn|1997|p=247}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Utah Territory, there was a law from 1851 to 1888 that allowed persons who were convicted of murder to be executed by decapitation; during that time, no person was executed by that method {{Harv|Gardner|1979|p=13}}.

====Blood atonement====
{{Main|Blood atonement}}

"Blood atonement" is the controversial concept that there are certain [[sin]]s to which the [[atonement in Christianity|atonement]] of [[Jesus]] does not apply, and before a Mormon who has committed such sins can achieve [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|the highest degree of salvation]], he or she must personally atone for the sin by "hav[ing] their blood spilt upon the ground, that the smoke thereof might ascend to heaven as an offering for their sins" {{Harv|Young|1856a|p=53}}. Blood atonement was supposed to be voluntarily practiced by the sinner, or it was contemplated as being mandatory in a theoretical [[theocracy]] which was planned for the [[Utah Territory]], but it was supposed to be carried out with love and compassion for the sinner, not out of a desire for vengeance {{Harv|Young|1857|p=220}}. The concept was first taught in the mid-1850s by the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) during the [[Mormon Reformation]], when [[Brigham Young]] governed the [[Utah Territory]] as a near-[[theocracy]]. Even though there was discussion about implementing the doctrine, there is no direct evidence that it was ever practiced by the Mormon leadership in their capacity as the leaders of both church and state {{Harv|Campbell|1988|loc=ch. 11}}. There is inconclusive evidence, however, to suggest that the doctrine was independently enforced a few times by Mormon individuals {{Harv|Stenhouse|1873|pp=467–71}}. Scholars have also argued that the doctrine contributed to a culture of violence, which, combined with paranoia that resulted from the church's long history of being persecuted, incited several extrajudicial killings by Mormons, including the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]] {{Harv|Quinn|1997}}.

LDS Church leaders taught the concept of blood atonement well into the 20th century within the context of government-sanctioned capital punishment, and it was responsible for laws in the state of [[Utah]] that allowed prisoners on death row to be [[execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] (''Salt Lake Tribune'', 11 May 1994, p. D1). Although the LDS Church repudiated the teaching in 1978, it still has adherents within the LDS Church as well as adherents within [[Mormon fundamentalism]], a [[Schism|schismatic]] branch of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] whose adherents seek to follow early Mormon teachings [[letter and spirit of the law|to the letter]]. Despite its repudiation by the LDS Church, the concept also survives in Mormon culture, particularly with regard to capital crimes.&lt;ref name="Stack 1994-11-4"&gt;{{citation |last= Stack |first= Peggy Fletcher |authorlink= Peggy Fletcher Stack |title= Concept of Blood Atonement Survives in Utah Despite Repudiation |newspaper= [[Salt Lake Tribune]] |date= November 5, 1994|quote= In the past decade, potential jurors in every Utah capital homicide were asked whether they believed in the Mormon concept of 'blood atonement.'}} The article also notes that [[Arthur Gary Bishop]], a convicted serial killer, was told by a top church leader that "blood atonement ended with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, when the defense in the trial of [[James Edward Wood]] alleged that a local church leader had "talked to [Wood] about shedding his own blood," the LDS Church's First Presidency submitted a document to the court that denied the church's acceptance and practice of such a doctrine, and included the 1978 repudiation.&lt;ref name="Stack 1994-11-4" /&gt;

==Penalties==

===Blood oaths===
Historically, Mormon ritual provided an example in which capital punishment is contemplated, though not necessarily required, for violations of historical [[Penalty (Mormonism)|blood oaths]] in the [[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment ritual]]. The blood oaths in the ceremony were related to protecting the ritual's secrecy. Participants made an oath that rather than ever revealing the secret gestures of the ceremony, they would rather have: "my throat... be cut from ear to ear, and my tongue torn out by its roots," "our breasts... be torn open, our hearts and vitals torn out and given to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field," "your body... be cut asunder and all your bowels gush out," showing an entire refusal to accept the promises made in the [[washing and anointing]] ordinances {{Harv|Buerger|2002|p=141}}. They were changed to a reference to "different ways in which life may be taken" {{Harv|Buerger|2002|p=141}}. The entire "penalty" portion of the ceremony was removed by the LDS Church in 1990, and during its lifetime, there is no documented instance in which a person has been killed for violating the oaths of secrecy.

===Law of vengeance===
After the [[death of Joseph Smith]], [[Brigham Young]] added an [[oath of vengeance]] to the Nauvoo [[endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment ritual]]. Participants in the ritual made an oath to pray that God would "avenge the blood of the prophets on this nation" {{Harv|Buerger 2002|p=134}}. "The prophets" were Joseph and [[Hyrum Smith]], and "this nation" was the United States {{Harv|Buerger|2002|p=134}}. The oath was removed from the ceremony during the 1920s {{Harv|Buerger|2002|pp=139–40}}.

In 1877, Young noted what he viewed as a similarity between Smith's death and the blood atonement doctrine in that "whether we believe in blood atonement or not," Smith and other prophets "sealed their testimony with their blood."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal of Discourses]]'' 18:361 (May 6, 1877).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instances of theological violence==

===Mountain Meadows Massacre===
The widely publicized [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]] of September 11, 1857, during the [[Utah War]], was a mass killing of about 130 emigrants, mostly from Arkansas and heading for California. It was led by prominent Mormon leader [[John D. Lee]] over a [[Nauvoo Legion|Mormon militia]]. Lee was later excommunicated and executed for his role in the killings. After escalating rumors that some of the emigrants had participated in early Mormon persecution, the militia attacked the emigrants, forced them to surrender, and killed most of them in cold blood, although a few children did survive. The Mormons forcibly adopted these children and blamed the massacre on [[Investigations and prosecutions relating to the Mountain Meadows massacre#Part played by Paiutes|largely uninvolved Native Americans]].

Though widely connected with the blood atonement doctrine by the United States press and general public,{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} there is no direct evidence that the massacre was related to "saving" the emigrants by the shedding of their blood (as they had not entered into Mormon covenants); rather, most commentators{{Who|date=August 2018}} view it as an act of intended retribution. Brigham Young was accused with either directing the massacre, or with complicity after the fact. When Young was interviewed on the matter and asked if he believed in blood atonement, he replied, "I do, and I believe that Lee has not half atoned for his great crime." He said "we believe that execution should be done by the shedding of blood instead of by hanging," but only "according to the laws of the land" {{Harv|Young|1877|p=242}}.

American troops who visited the site later constructed a cairn at the site, topped with a sign saying "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord." According to a Mormon present at the even, when Young visited the site sometime afterward, he remarked "Vengeance is ''mine'', and I have taken a little"; his party proceeded to destroy the cairn and memorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Karakuer |first= Jon |date= |title= Under the Banner of Heaven |url= |location=New York |publisher=Anchor Books |page=232 |isbn=1-4000-3280-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1976, LDS Church [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Boyd K. Packer]] gave a sermon entitled "[[To Young Men Only]]".&lt;ref name="Quinn 2001 p. 382-4"&gt;{{harvnb|Quinn|2001|pages=382–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.religioustolerance.org/hom_lds2.htm |title= The LDS Church (Mormons) &amp; homosexuality.

If you are ever approached to participate in anything like that, it is time to vigorously resist. While I was in a mission on one occasion, a missionary said he had something to confess. I was very worried because he just could not get himself to tell me what he had done. After patient encouragement he finally blurted out, "I hit my companion." "Oh, is that all," I said in great relief. "But I floored him," he said. After learning a little more, my response was "Well, thanks. Somebody had to do it, and it wouldn't be well for a General Authority to solve the problem that way" I am not recommending that course to you, but I am not omitting it. You must protect yourself." {{harvnb|Packer|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sermon was later published as a pamphlet and was widely circulated to LDS young men. Openly gay&lt;ref name="Interview of D. Michael Quinn"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/mormons/interviews/quinn.html |title=Interview of D. Michael Quinn |author= |date=30 April 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2011 |work= |publisher=[[PBS]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; historian [[D. Michael Quinn]] criticized Packer's comments, saying they constituted an endorsement of [[gay bashing]], and he also claimed that the church itself endorses such behavior by continuing to publish Packer's speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= D. Michael |last= Quinn |authorlink= D.

On July 5, 2015, the LDS Church issued an official statement in response to the Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage and to clarify its official position of non-violence to the LGBT community:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/top-church-leaders-counsel-members-after-supreme-court-same-sex-marriage-decision |title= Top Church Leaders Counsel Members After Supreme Court Same Sex Marriage Decision |accessdate=31 Aug 2015 | journal= MormonNewsRoom.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The gospel of Jesus Christ teaches us to love and treat all people with kindness and civility—even when we disagree. We affirm that those who avail themselves of laws or court rulings authorizing same-sex marriage should not be treated disrespectfully. Indeed, the Church has advocated for rights of same-sex couples in matters of hospitalization and medical care, fair housing and employment, and probate, so long as these do not infringe on the integrity of the traditional family or the constitutional rights of churches.

During 2014, 15-year-old Mormon Jared Padgett killed a fellow student at their Oregon high school, injured a teacher, and then committed suicide.

==Violence in the Mormon scriptures==
There are many [[wars mentioned in the Book of Mormon]]. Battles often occur between peoples called the [[Nephites]] and [[Lamanites]], but other groups attacked or drawn into battle included "[[Secret combination (Latter Day Saints)|secret combinations]]" (i.e., organized criminals), factions among the [[Jaredites]], and the [[Army of Helaman]].

The Book of Mormon concludes with a war between the Nephites and Lamanites. The final prophet of the Book of Mormon, a Nephite named [[Moroni (Book of Mormon prophet)|Moroni]], laments that his people have participated in sexual violence, torture, and cannibalism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
And notwithstanding this great abomination of the Lamanites, it doth not exceed that of our people in Moriantum. For behold, many of the daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners; and after depriving them of that which was most dear and precious above all things, which is chastity and virtue—And after they had done this thing, they did murder them in a most cruel manner, torturing their bodies even unto death; and after they have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild beasts, because of the hardness of their hearts; and they do it for a token of bravery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/moro/9.9-10#8 Moroni 9:9–10].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several decapitations and dismemberments are also described in the Book of Mormon. In chapter 4 of the [[First Book of Nephi]], the prophet [[Nephi (son of Lehi)|Nephi]] obeys the Holy Spirit and cuts off the head of Laban.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/4 1 Nephi 4].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Book of Ether|Ether]] chapter 15, the warrior Coriantumr, who is the last survivor of the Jaredites, decapitates Shiz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/ether/15.29-32#28 Ether 15:29–32].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Book of Alma|Alma]] chapter 17, [[Ammon (Book of Mormon missionary)|Ammon]] (a Nephite [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionary]]) defends a king's livestock by cutting off the arms of several thieves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/17 Alma 17].&lt;/ref&gt;

In chapter 9 of the [[Third Book of Nephi]], Jesus announces to ancient Americans that he has destroyed more than a dozen cities and their inhabitants. He announces that he destroyed some cities by causing them "to be burned with fire because of their sins and their wickedness," while others were "sunk in the depths of the sea" or "covered with earth".&lt;ref name = 3nephi9&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/9 3 Nephi 9].&lt;/ref&gt; The text reports that some of the victims mourned, "O that we had repented before this great and terrible day, and had not killed and stoned the prophets, and cast them out; then would our mothers and our fair daughters, and our children have been spared".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/8.25#24 3 Nephi 8:25].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book of Mormon is not unique in describing divinely directed or sanctioned violence. Additional examples appear in the Old Testament, which Mormons also consider to be sacred scripture.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

[[File:Tiflis by aivazovsky.jpg|thumb|250px|View of Old Tbilisi in 1868, by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]].]] 
'''Old Tbilisi''' ({{lang-ka|ძველი თბილისი}}, ''dzveli t'bilisi'') was an administrative district ([[raioni]]) in [[Tbilisi]], capital of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], from 2007 to 2013. Although the term "Old Tbilisi" has long been used to denote a historical part of the city, it was only in 2007 that it became a distinct administrative entity to incorporate several historical neighborhoods formerly included in the districts of [[Mtatsminda-Krtsanisi]], [[Isani-Samgori]], and [[Didube-Chughureti]]. The district was abolished in 2013, with its territories allotted to several other divisions of the capital.

Old Tbilisi is principally centered on what is commonly referred to as the Tbilisi Historic District, which, due to its significant architectural and urban value, as well as the threat to its survival, was previously listed on the [[World Monuments Fund|World Monuments Watch]] (1998, 2000, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;[http://wmf.org/watch_past.html Sites previously listed on the World Monuments Watch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105182704/http://wmf.org/watch_past.html |date=2009-01-05 }}. ''[[World Monuments Fund]]''. Retrieved on May 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The district is located on the both sides of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] and is dominated by [[Mount Mtatsminda]], [[Narikala]] fortress and the [[Kartlis Deda]] monument. It chiefly represents a 19th-century urban fabric with largely eclectic architecture which includes the buildings and structures from the 5th to the 20th century. However, most of the pre-19th century city did not survive due to the devastating [[Battle of Krtsanisi|Persian invasion of 1795]]. The district houses a bulk of the tourist attractions in Tbilisi, including churches, museums, sulphur bathhouses, and peculiar wooden houses with open, carved balconies. In the 19th century, the core territory of the modern-day district of Old Tbilisi was tentatively subdivided into ethnic neighborhoods such as [[Avlabari]] with its Armenian and Georgian quarters, [[Alexanderdorf]] German quarter on the left bank of the Kura River and the Persian Quarter (Said-Abad) on the right bank of the Kura River.

Old Tbilisi has been the centre of a thriving art community with artist Giovanni Vepkhavadze known for specializing in painting many street scenes in the district.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgiaabout.com/2014/03/12/paintings-of-old-tbilisi-by-giovanni-vepkhvadze/ |title= Old Tbilisi Series |author=Giovanni Vepkhvadze |accessdate=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Life of Old Tbilisi==

In 2010, the government of Tbilisi started a program initiated by [[Mayor of Tbilisi|Mayor]] [[Gigi Ugulava]]. The idea was to renew old and damaged houses and cobbled streets to make Old Tbilisi more attractive for tourists and visitors.

The '''Phonetics Laboratory''' is the [[phonetics]] laboratory at the [[University of Oxford]], [[England]]. It is located at 41 [[Wellington Square, Oxford]].

The laboratory focusses on experimental tests of linguistic assumptions and empirical linguistics.  It provides teaching at the undergraduate and graduate level.  Research students in the laboratory are normally reading for a higher degree in Experimental Linguistics, though students from other disciplines touching on the subject of speech are sometimes based in Phonetics.

The Phonetics Laboratory was established in 1980. It occupies the basement of 41 Wellington Square, a mid-Victorian brick building, expanded since.  It has experimental areas (sound-insulated recording booths), and general experimental space.  The lab also supports signal processing research via software, speech corpora, and processor clusters.

==Working Papers==
The Phonetics Lab has published collections of working papers (ongoing research and research getting ready for peer-reviewed publication) since 1996.   The 2009 Working Papers are titled "Papers in Phonetics and Computational Linguistics."

'''''Plan of a Novel, according to Hints from Various Quarters''''' is a short [[satire|satirical]] work by [[Jane Austen]], probably written in May 1816.&lt;ref name="Poplawski1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Poplawski|title=A Jane Austen Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hW-OXDSc3rAC&amp;pg=PA238|accessdate=4 September 2013|date=1 January 1998|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-30017-2|pages=238–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in complete form for the first time by [[Robert William Chapman (scholar)|R.

==Background==
In 1815 Austen met the Rev. [[James Stanier Clarke]] in London. He had ideas for her fiction, including a novel to be based on a clergyman with a foothold in urban life, as well as the provincial rural settings she had used so far for clerics in her novels.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time (October 1815) she was staying with her brother in London negotiating the publication of ''[[Emma (novel)|Emma]]'', which was then dedicated to the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince Regent]] through the good offices of Clarke, who was the Prince's librarian.&lt;ref name="Poplawski1998"/&gt; Among Clarke's suggestions was a [[historical novel]] on the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|House of Coburg]]: Austen side-stepped with a disclaimer about her talents.&lt;ref&gt;Claire Lamont, ''Jane Austen and the Old'', The Review of English Studies New Series, Vol. 54, No. 217 (Nov., 2003), pp. 661-674, at p. 663. Published by: Oxford University Press. Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3661480&lt;/ref&gt;  Clarke recommended that Austen should dedicate ''Emma ''to the Prince Regent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Myer|first1=Valerie Grosvenor|title=Jane Austen : obstinate heart : a biography|date=1997|publisher=Arcade Publ.|location=New York|isbn=9781559703871|page=215|edition=1. North American}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She did this, although she disapproved of his attitude towards his wife.&lt;ref&gt;Austen wrote in a letter to Martha Lloyd on 16 February 1813 of the Prince's infidelities and his wife: "I am resolved at least always to think that she would have been respectable, if the Prince had behaved only tolerably by her at first."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content and humour of the ''Plan''==
The intention of the work was to set down the essential parts of the "ideal novel". Austen was following, and guying, the recommendations of Clarke.&lt;ref name="Poplawski1998"/&gt; The work was also influenced by some of Austen's personal circle with views on the novel of [[courtship]], and names are recorded in the margins of the manuscript;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Deborah Kaplan|title=Jane Austen Among Women|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wrpNvr_H0TUC&amp;pg=PA184|accessdate=4 September 2013|year=1994|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-4970-1|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt; they included [[William Gifford]], her publisher, and her niece Fanny Knight.&lt;ref name="KeymerMee2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas Keymer|author2=Jon Mee|title=The Cambridge Companion to English Literature, 1740-1830|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JyvdbEUGX6sC&amp;pg=PA256|accessdate=4 September 2013|date=17 June 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-00757-3|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Plan'' became a sort of family joke among the Austens. Some of its aspects parody contemporary works by authors such as [[Sophie Cottin]], [[Fanny Burney]], [[Anna Maria Porter]], and [[Mary Brunton]].&lt;ref name="KeymerMee2004"/&gt; The satire of the ''Plan'' was analysed by Austen's nephew [[James Edward Austen-Leigh]], in his biography ''[[A Memoir of Jane Austen]]'' (1869, expanded edition 1871).

'''Private law''' is that part of a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[legal system]] which is part of the ''[[jus commune]]'' that involves relationships between individuals, such as the law of [[contract]]s or [[tort]]s&lt;ref name="Mattei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.common-core.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=46&amp;Itemid=34 |title=The Project - Delivered at the first general meeting on July 6, 1995 - The Trento Common Core Project |last=Mattei |first=Ugo|author2=Bussani, Mauro |date=18 May 2010|work=The Common Core of European Private Law|publisher=Common Core Organizing Secretariat, [[The International University College of Turin]] |accessdate=8 September 2011|location=Turin, Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as it is called in the [[common law]]), and the [[law of obligations]] (as it is called in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil legal systems]]). It is to be distinguished from [[public law]], which deals with relationships between both [[natural person|natural]] and [[Juristic person|artificial persons]] (i.e., organizations) and the [[State (polity)|state]], including regulatory [[statute]]s, [[penal law]] and other law that affects the [[public order]]. In general terms, private law involves interactions between private citizens, whereas public law involves interrelations between the state and the general population.

==Private law in common law jurisdictions==
The concept of private law in common law countries is a little more broad, in that it also encompasses private relationships between governments and private individuals or other entities. That is, relationships between governments and individuals based on the law of contract or torts are governed by private law, and are not considered to be within the scope of public law.

== Areas of private law ==
*[[Civil law (common law)|Civil law]]
**[[Contract law|Law of contract]]
**[[Law of torts]]
**[[Unjust enrichment|Law of unjust enrichment]]
**[[Trust law|Law of trusts]]
**[[Law of agency]]
**[[Property law|Law of property]]
**[[Family law]] family-related issues and domestic relations including marriage, civil unions, divorce, spousal abuse, child custody and visitation, property, alimony, and child support awards, child abuse issues, and adoption.
**[[Inheritance|Succession]], estate, probate, and testamentary laws

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32185">{{redirect|Aliases||Alias (disambiguation)}} 

A '''pseudonym''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|sj|uː|d|ən|ɪ|m}}) or '''alias''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|l|i|ə|s}}) is a [[name]] that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their first or true name ([[orthonym]]).&lt;ref&gt;Room (2010, 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudonyms include [[stage name]]s and [[User (computing)|user names]], [[ring name]]s, [[pen name]]s, [[nickname]]s, aliases, [[superhero]] or [[villain]] identities and code names, gamer identifications, and [[regnal name]]s of [[emperors]], [[pope]]s, and other [[monarch]]s. Historically, they have often taken the form of [[anagram]]s, Graecisms, and [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinisations]], although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym.&lt;ref&gt;Peschke (2006, vii).&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudonyms should not be confused with new names that replace old ones and become the individual's full-time name. Pseudonyms are "part-time" names, used only in certain contexts – usually adopted to hide an individual's real identity, as with writers' [[pen name]]s, [[graffiti]] artists' tags, [[Resistance movement|resistance fighters']] or [[terrorist|terrorists']] ''noms de guerre'', and computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]]' [[User (computing)|handles]]. [[Actor]]s, musicians, and other performers sometimes use [[stage name]]s, for example, to mask their ethnic backgrounds.

In some cases, pseudonyms are adopted because they are part of a cultural or organisational tradition: for example [[Religious name|devotional names]] used by members of some [[religious institute]]s, and "cadre names" used by [[Communist party]] leaders such as [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] and [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].

A pseudonym may also be used for personal reasons: for example, an individual may prefer to be called or known by a name that differs from their given or [[legal name]], but is not ready to take the numerous steps to get their name [[Name change|legally changed]]; or an individual may simply feel that the context and content of an exchange offer no reason, legal or otherwise, to provide their given or legal name.

A ''collective name'' or ''collective pseudonym'' is one shared by two or more persons, for example the co-authors of a work, such as [[Ellery Queen]], [[Nicolas Bourbaki]]. or [[James S. A. Corey]].

==Etymology==
The term is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|ψευδώνυμον}} (''pseudṓnymon''), literally "false name", from {{lang|grc|ψεῦδος}} (''pseûdos''), "lie, falsehood"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dyeu%3Ddos ψεῦδος],
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|ὄνομα}} (''ónoma''), "name".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Do%29%2Fnoma ὄνομα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus project&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction from allonyms, ghost writers and pseudepigrapha==

A pseudonym is distinct from an ''allonym'', which is the (real) name of another person, assumed by the author of a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Turco|first1=Lewis|title=The Book of Literary Terms: The Genres of Fiction, Drama, Nonfiction, Literary Criticism, and Scholarship|date=1999|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover and London|page=182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=noTRMjASamEC&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=allonym&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may occur when someone is [[ghostwriting]] a book or play, or in [[parody]], or when using a "front" name, such as by [[screenwriter]]s [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisted]] in [[Hollywood]] in the 1950s and 1960s. See also [[pseudepigraph]], for ''falsely'' attributed authorship.

==Usage==
===Legal name change===
Sometimes people change their name in such a manner that the new name becomes permanent and is used by all who know the person. This is not an alias or pseudonym, but in fact a new name. In many countries, including [[common law]] countries, a name change can be ratified by a court and become a person's new legal name.

For example, in the 1960s, black civil rights campaigner [[Malcolm X|Malcolm Little]] changed his surname to "X", to represent his unknown African ancestral name that had been lost when his ancestors were brought to North America as slaves. He then changed his name again to Malik El-Shabazz when he converted to Islam.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Likewise some Jews adopted Hebrew family names upon immigrating to [[Israel]], dropping surnames that had been in their families for generations. The politician [[David Ben-Gurion]], for example, was born David Grün in Poland. He adopted his Hebrew name in 1910, when he published his first article in a Zionist journal in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vision.org/visionmedia/biography-david-ben-gurion/5810.aspx|title= Biography David Ben-Gurion: For the Love of Zion|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[transgender]] people also choose to adopt a new name, typically around the time of their [[Transitioning (transgender)|social transitioning]], to resemble their desired gender better than their birth name.

===Concealing identity===
====Business====
Businesspersons of ethnic minorities in some parts of the world are sometimes advised by an employer to use a pseudonym that is common or acceptable in that area when conducting business, to overcome [[racial bias|racial]] or religious [[Bias#Prejudices|bias]].&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Nan, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and ''The New York Times (N.Y.: Random House, [2nd printing?] 1992 ({{ISBN|0-394-58452-X}})), p. 221. In 1968, one such employer was [[The New York Times]], the affected workers were classified-advertising takers, and the renaming was away from [[Jews|Jewish]], [[Irish people|Irish]], and [[Italian people|Italian]] names to ones "with a [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] flavor".&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criminal activity====
Criminals may use aliases, [[fictitious business names]], and [[dummy corporations]] ([[corporate shells]]) to hide their identity, or to impersonate other persons or entities in order to commit fraud. Aliases and fictitious business names used for dummy corporations may become so complex that, in the words of the ''[[Washington Post]]'', "getting to the truth requires a walk down a bizarre labyrinth" and multiple government agencies may become involved to uncover the truth.&lt;ref name=RTR&gt;The Ruse That Roared, ''The Washington Post'', 5 November 1995, Richard Leiby, James Lileks&lt;/ref&gt;

====Literature====
[[File:Die junge George Sand.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A young [[George Sand]] (real name "Amantine Lucile Dupin")]]

A [[pen name]], or ''"nom de plume"'' (French for "pen name"), is a pseudonym (sometimes a particular form of the real name) adopted by an [[author]] (or on the author's behalf by their publishers).

Some female authors used male pen names, in particular in the 19th century, when writing was a male-dominated profession. The [[Brontë family]] used pen names for their early work, so as not to reveal their gender (see below) and so that local residents would not know that the books related to people of the neighbourhood. The Brontës used their neighbours as inspiration for characters in many of their books. Anne Brontë published ''The Tenant of Wildfell Hall'' under the name Acton Bell. Charlotte Brontë published ''Shirley'' and ''Jane Eyre'' under the name Currer Bell. Emily Brontë published ''Wuthering Heights'' as Ellis Bell.
A well-known example of the former is Mary Ann Evans, who wrote as [[George Eliot]]. Another example is Amandine Aurore Lucile Dupin, a 19th-century French writer who used the pen name [[George Sand]].

In contrast, some twentieth and twenty first century male romance novelists have used female pen names.&lt;ref name=maleauthors&gt;{{cite news|last=Naughton|first=Julie|title=Yes, Virgil, There Are Men Writing Romance: Focus on Romance 2012|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/new-titles/adult-announcements/article/52473-yes-virgil-there-are-men-writing-romance-focus-on-romance-2012.html|accessdate=6 May 2014|newspaper=Publishers Weekly|date=1 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few examples of male authors using female pseudonyms include Brindle Chase, [[Peter O'Donnell]] (wrote as Madeline Brent) and [[Christopher Wood (writer)|Christopher Wood]] (wrote as Penny Sutton and Rosie Dixon).&lt;ref name="maleauthors" /&gt;

A pen name may be used if a writer's real name is likely to be confused with the name of another writer or notable individual, or if their real name is deemed to be unsuitable.

Authors who write both fiction and non-fiction, or in different [[genres]], may use different pen names to avoid confusing their readers.

In some cases, an author may become better known by his pen name than his real name.
One famous example of this is Samuel Clemens writing under the pen name [[Mark Twain]]. British [[mathematician]] Charles Dodgson, who wrote fantasy novels under the pen name [[Lewis Carroll]] and mathematical treatises under his own name, refused to open letters addressed to him as "Lewis Carroll".

Some authors, such as [[Harold Robbins]], use several literary pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trussel.com/books/pseud_r.htm Rubin, Harold Francis (1916–)], Author Pseudonyms: R. Accessed 27 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pen names have been used for long periods, even decades, without the author's true identity being discovered, such as [[Elena Ferrante]] and [[Torsten Krol]].

Some pen names are not strictly pseudonyms, as they are simply variants of the authors' actual names. The authors [[C. L. Moore]] and [[S. E. Hinton]] were female authors who used the initialised forms of their full names. [[C. L. Moore]] was Catherine Lucille Moore, who wrote in the 1930s male-dominated science fiction genre, and [[S. E. Hinton]], (author of ''[[The Outsiders (novel)|The Outsiders]]'') is Susan Eloise Hinton. ''[[Star Trek]]'' writer [[D. C. Fontana]] (Dorothy Catherine) wrote using her abbreviated own name and also under the pen names Michael Richards and J. Michael Bingham. Author [[V.C. Andrews]] intended to publish under her given name of Virginia Andrews, but was told that, due to a production error, her first novel was being released under the name of "V.C. Andrews"; later she learned that her publisher had in fact done this deliberately. Joanne Kathleen Rowling&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.levesoninquiry.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Witness-Statement-of-JK-Rowling2.pdf|title=Witness statement of Joanne Kathleen Rowling| publisher= The [[Leveson Inquiry]]|date=November 2011|accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; published the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series under the shortened name [[J. K. Rowling]].&lt;!-- See article for further explanation, keep it simple here --&gt; Rowling also published the [[Cormoran Strike]] series, a series of detective novels including ''[[The Cuckoo's Calling]]'' under the pseudonym "Robert Galbraith".

[[Winston Churchill]] wrote under the pen name [[Winston Churchill as writer|Winston S. Churchill]] (from his full surname "Spencer-Churchill" which he did not otherwise use) in an attempt to avoid confusion with the [[Winston Churchill (novelist)|American novelist of the same name]]. In this case, the attempt was not entirely successful – and the two are still sometimes confused by booksellers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Age 19 October 1940, hosted on Google News|title=Two Winston Churchills|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&amp;dat=19401019&amp;id=QJZVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PpcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4893,3645349|accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=My Early Life – 1874–1904, hosted on Google Books |title=Oldham |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n2EK2khQWfsC&amp;pg=PA218&amp;lpg=PA218&amp;dq=%22mr.+winston+churchill+makes+haste+to+add%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mr.%20winston%20churchill%20makes%20haste%20to%20add%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pen name may be used specifically to hide the identity of the author, as in the case of [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]] books about [[espionage]] or [[crime]], or explicit erotic fiction. Some prolific authors adopt a pseudonym to disguise the extent of their published output, e.g. [[Stephen King]] writing as [[Richard Bachman]]. Co-authors may choose to publish under a collective pseudonym, e.g., [[P. J. Tracy]] and [[Perri O'Shaughnessy]]. [[Frederic Dannay]] and [[Manfred Lee]] used the name [[Ellery Queen]] as both a pen name for their collaborative works and as the name of their main character.

A famous case in French literature was [[Romain Gary]]. Already a well-known and highly acclaimed writer, he started publishing books under the pen name [[Émile Ajar]]. He wanted to test whether his new books would be well received on their own merits and without the aid of his established reputation, and they were: Émile Ajar, like Romain Gary before him, was awarded the prestigious [[Prix Goncourt]] by a jury unaware that both were the same person. Similarly, [[Ronnie Barker]] submitted comedy material under the name of Gerald Wiley.

A collective pseudonym may represent an entire publishing house, or any contributor to a long-running series, especially with juvenile literature. Examples include [[Watty Piper]], [[Victor Appleton]], [[Erin Hunter]], and Kamiru M. Xhan.

Another use of a pseudonym in literature is to present a story as being written by the fictional characters in the story. The series of novels known as ''[[A Series Of Unfortunate Events]]'' are written by [[Daniel Handler]] under the pen name of [[Lemony Snicket]], a character in the series.

An '''anonymity pseudonym''' or [[multiple-use name]] is a name used by many different people to protect anonymity.&lt;ref Name="Home"&gt;{{cite book

This has led to the idea of the "open pop star".

====Medicine====
Pseudonyms and [[acronym]]s are often employed in [[medical research]] to [[Privacy for research participants|protect subjects' identities]] through a process known as [[de-identification]].

===={{anchor|Noms de guerre}}Military and paramilitary organizations====&lt;!-- [[Noms de guerre]], [[Nom de guerre]] and [[Nom-de-guerre]] redirect here --&gt;
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2016}}

In [[Ancien Régime]] France, a ''nom de guerre'' ("war name") would be adopted by each new recruit (or assigned to them by the captain of their company) as they enlisted in the [[French army]]. These pseudonyms had an official character and were the predecessor of [[Dog tag|identification numbers]]: soldiers were identified by their first names, their family names, and their ''noms de guerre'' (e.g. ''Jean Amarault dit Lafidélité''). These pseudonyms were usually related to the soldier's place of origin (e.g. ''Jean Deslandes dit Champigny'', for a soldier coming from a town named [[Champigny (disambiguation)|Champigny]]), or to a particular physical or personal trait (e.g. ''Antoine Bonnet dit Prettaboire'', for a soldier ''prêt à boire'', ready to drink). In 1716, a ''nom de guerre'' was mandatory for every soldier; officers did not adopt ''noms de guerre'' as they considered them derogatory. In daily life, these aliases could replace the real family name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.histori.ca/prodev/article.do?id=15333 |title=Home &amp;#124; Historica – Dominion |publisher=Historica |date= |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Noms de guerre'' were adopted for security reasons by members of the [[World War II]] [[French resistance]] and [[Polish underground state|Polish resistance]]. Such pseudonyms are often adopted by military special forces soldiers, such as members of the SAS and other similar units, [[Resistance movement|resistance fighters]], [[terrorism|terrorists]], and [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]]. This practice hides their identities and may protect their families from reprisals; it may also be a form of [[wikt:dissociation|dissociation]] from domestic life. Some well-known men who adopted ''noms de guerre'' include Carlos, for [[Ilich Ramírez Sánchez]]; [[Willy Brandt]], [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor]] of [[West Germany]]; and [[Subcomandante Marcos]], the spokesman of the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] (EZLN). {{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} During [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]]'s underground fight against the British in [[Mandatory Palestine]], the organization's commander [[Yitzchak Shamir]] (later [[Prime Minister of Israel]]) adopted the ''nom de guerre'' "Michael", in honour of [[Ireland]]'s [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]].

Revolutionaries and resistance leaders, such as [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]], [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]], [[Golda Meir]], [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]], and [[Josip Broz Tito]], often adopted their ''noms de guerre'' as their proper names after the struggle. [[George Grivas]], the Greek-Cypriot [[EOKA]] militant, adopted the ''nom de guerre'' Digenis (Διγενής). In the [[French Foreign Legion]], recruits can adopt a pseudonym to break with their past lives. Mercenaries have long used "noms de guerre", even sometimes multiple identities depending on country, conflict and circumstance.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Some of the most familiar noms de guerre today are the [[Kunya (Arabic)|kunya]] used by Islamic [[mujahideen]]. These take the form of a [[teknonym]], either literal or figurative.

====Online activity====
Individuals using a computer [[online]] may adopt or be required to use a form of pseudonym known as a "handle" (a term deriving from [[CB slang]]), "[[User (computing)|user]] name", "[[Logging (computer security)|login]] name", "[[Avatar (virtual reality)|avatar]]", or, sometimes, "[[Screen name (computing)|screen name]]", "[[gamertag]]" "IGN ('''I'''n '''G'''ame ('''N'''ick)'''N'''ame)" or "[[nickname]]". On the Internet, [[pseudonymous remailer]]s use [[cryptography]] that achieves persistent [[pseudonymity]], so that two-way communication can be achieved, and reputations can be established, without linking physical [[identity theft|identities]] to their respective pseudonyms. [[Aliasing (computing)|Aliasing]] is the use of multiple names for the same data location.

More sophisticated cryptographic systems, such as anonymous [[digital credential]]s, enable users to communicate pseudonymously (i.e., by identifying themselves by means of pseudonyms). In well-defined abuse cases, a designated authority may be able to revoke the pseudonyms and reveal the individuals' real identity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Use of pseudonyms is common among professional [[eSports]] players, despite the fact that many professional games are played on [[LAN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ongamers.com/articles/why-esports-needs-to-ditch-online-aliases/1100-205/|title=Why esports needs to ditch online aliases|first=Taylor |last=Cocke |date=26 November 2013|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Privacy====
People seeking privacy often use pseudonyms to make appointments and reservations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Harriet |last1=Ryan |first2=Kimi |last2=Yoshino |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-jackson17-2009jul17,0,3782664.story |title=Investigators target Michael Jackson's pseudonyms |publisher=Latimes.com |date=17 July 2009 |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those writing to [[advice column]]s in newspapers and magazines may use pseudonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?nid=4TOpqqG69KYC&amp;dat=18830407&amp;printsec=frontpage |title=''Toronto Daily Mail, "Women's Kingdom", "A Delicate Question", April 7, 1883, page 5 |publisher=News.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Wozniak]] used a pseudonym when attending the [[University of California, Berkeley]] after cofounding [[Apple Computer]] because, he said, "I knew I wouldn't have time enough to be an A+ student."&lt;ref name="stix19860514"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1986-05-14/news/vw-5389_1_steve-wozniak | title=A UC Berkeley Degree Is Now the Apple of Steve Wozniak's Eye | work=Los Angeles Times | date=14 May 1986 | accessdate=5 January 2015 | author=Stix, Harriet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage names===
{{main|Stage name}}
When used by an [[actor]], [[musician]], radio [[disc jockey]], [[model (person)|model]], or other performer or "[[show business]]" personality a pseudonym is called a ''stage name'', or, occasionally, a ''professional name'', or ''screen name''.

====Film, theatre, and related activities====
Members of a marginalized ethnic or religious group have often adopted stage names, typically changing their surname or entire name to mask their original background.

Stage names are also used to create a more marketable name, as in the case of Creighton Tull Chaney, who adopted the pseudonym [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], a reference to his famous father [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]

[[Chris Curtis]] of [[Deep Purple]] fame was christened as Christopher Crummey. In this and similar cases a stage name is adopted simply to avoid an unfortunate [[pun]].

Pseudonyms are also used to comply with the rules of [[performing arts]] [[guild]]s ([[Screen Actors Guild]] (SAG), [[Writers Guild of America, East]] (WGA), [[AFTRA]], etc.), which do not allow performers to use an existing name, in order to avoid confusion. For example, these rules required film and television actor Michael Fox to add a middle initial and become [[Michael J. Fox]], to avoid being confused with another actor named [[Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox]]. This was also true of author and actress [[Fannie Flagg]], who chose this pseudonym; her real name, Patricia Neal, being the name of [[Patricia Neal|another well-known actress]]; and British actor [[Stewart Granger]], whose real name was James Stewart. The film-making team of [[Coen brothers|Joel and Ethan Coen]], for instance, share credit for editing under the alias Roderick Jaynes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2008/01/roderick_jaynes_imaginary_osca.html |title=Roderick Jaynes, Imaginary Oscar Nominee for ‘No Country’ – Vulture |publisher=Nymag.com |date= |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is that actor [[Gary Morgan (actor)|Gary Morgan]] used his fictional name "Barnard Panansky" in the [[Kidsongs]]' I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing video while in Kidsongs: Very Silly Songs, his actual name appears in the credits.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Some stage names are used to conceal a person's identity, such as the pseudonym [[Alan Smithee]], which was used by directors in the [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA) to remove their name from a film they feel was edited or modified beyond their artistic satisfaction. In theatre, the pseudonyms [[George Spelvin|George or Georgina Spelvin]], and [[Walter Plinge]] are used to hide the identity of a performer, usually when he or she is "doubling" (playing more than one role in the same play).

[[David Agnew]] was a name used by the [[BBC]] to conceal the identity of a scriptwriter, such as for the [[Doctor Who]] serial [[City of Death]], which had 3 writers, including [[Douglas Adams]], who was at the time of writing the show's Script Editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/episodeguide/cityofdeath/detail.shtml|title=BBC – Doctor Who Classic Episode Guide – City of Death – Details|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another Doctor Who serial, [[The Brain of Morbius]], writer [[Terrance Dicks]] demanded the removal of his name from the credits saying it could go out under a "bland pseudonym".&lt;ref name="Brief History"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Time (Travel); The Brain of Morbius|url=http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/4k.html|author=Shannon Patrick Sullivan|accessdate=29 April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="codenames"/&gt; This ended up being the name ''Robin Bland''.&lt;ref name="codenames"&gt;{{cite web|first=William |last=Gallagher |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-27/doctor-whos-secret-history-of-codenames-revealed |title=Doctor Who's secret history of codenames revealed |work=[[Radio Times]] |date=27 March 2012 |accessdate=31 March 2013 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227211038/http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-03-27/doctor-whos-secret-history-of-codenames-revealed |archivedate=27 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Walker and Stammers ''Doctor Who the Handbook: The Fourth Doctor'' pp 175–176&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====
{{sources|section|date=September 2018}}
Musicians and singers can use pseudonyms to allow artists to collaborate with artists on other labels while avoiding the need to gain permission from their own labels, such as the artist [[Jerry Samuels]], who made songs under Napoleon XIV. Rock singer-guitarist [[George Harrison]], for example, played guitar on [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s song "[[Badge (song)|Badge]]" using a pseudonym.&lt;ref name="John Wynn"&gt;{{cite book|last=Winn|first=John|year=2009 | title = That Magic Feeling: The Beatles' Recorded Legacy, Volume Two, 1966–1970 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=978-0-307-45239-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LdsMqbAQJWgC&amp;dq |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In classical music, some record companies issued recordings under a ''nom de disque'' in the 1950s and 1960s to avoid paying royalties. A number of popular budget LPs of piano music were released under the pseudonym [[Paul Procopolis]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Another example is that [[Paul McCartney]] used his fictional name "Bernerd Webb" for [[Peter and Gordon]]'s song [[Woman (Paul McCartney song)|Woman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/5579|title=45cat - Peter And Gordon - Woman / Wrong From The Start - Capitol - USA - 5579 |publisher=45cat |accessdate=30 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pseudonyms are also used as stage names in [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands, such as [[Tracii Guns]] in [[LA Guns]], [[Axl Rose]] and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] in [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Mick Mars]] in [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Dimebag Darrell]] in [[Pantera]], or [[C.C. Deville]] in [[Poison (American band)|Poison]]. Some of these names have additional meanings, like that of Brian Hugh Warner, more commonly known as [[Marilyn Manson]]: Marilyn coming from [[Marilyn Monroe]] and Manson from convicted serial killer [[Charles Manson]]. [[Jacoby Shaddix]] of [[Papa Roach]] went under the name "Coby Dick" during the ''[[Infest (album)|Infest]]'' era. He changed back to his birth name when ''[[lovehatetragedy]]'' was released.

[[David Johansen]], frontman for the hard rock band [[New York Dolls]],  recorded and performed pop and lounge music under the pseudonym Buster Poindexter in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The music video for Poindexter's debt single, [[Hot Hot Hot (Arrow song)#Buster Poindexter version|Hot Hot Hot]], opens with a monologue from Johansen where he notes his time with the New York Dolls and explains his desire to create more sophisticated music. 

[[Ross Bagdasarian, Sr.]], creator of [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], wrote original songs, arranged, and produced the records under his real name, but performed on them as [[David Seville]].  He also wrote songs using the name Skipper Adams.  Danish pop pianist [[Bent Fabric]], whose full name is Bent Fabricius-Bjerre, wrote his biggest instrumental hit "[[Alley Cat (song)|Alley Cat]]" under the name Frank Bjorn.

For a time, the musician [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] used an unpronounceable "[[Prince (musician)#Stage names|Love Symbol]]" as a pseudonym ("Prince" is his actual first name rather than a stage name). He wrote the song "[[Sugar Walls]]" for [[Sheena Easton]] under the alias "Alexander Nevermind" and "[[Manic Monday]]" for [[The Bangles]] as "Christopher Tracy" (he also produced albums early in his career as "Jamie Starr").

Many Italian-American singers have used stage names as their birth names were difficult to pronounce, or considered too ethnic for American tastes.  Singers changing their names included [[Dean Martin]] (born Dino Paul Crocetti), [[Connie Francis]] (born Concetta Franconero), [[Frankie Valli]] (born Francesco Castelluccio), [[Tony Bennett]] (born Anthony Benedetto), and [[Lady Gaga]] (born Stefani Germanotta)

In 2009, British rock band [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] briefly changed their name to [[Renegades (band)|Renegades]] so they could play a whole show featuring a setlist in which 95 percent of the songs played were from their forthcoming new album of the same name, with none of their singles included. Frontman [[Grant Nicholas]] felt that if they played as Feeder, there would be an uproar that they did not play any of the singles, so used the pseudonym as a hint. A series of small shows were played in 2010, at 250- to 1,000-capacity venues with the plan not to say who the band really are and just announce the shows as if they were a new band.

In many cases, hip-hop and rap artist prefer to use pseudonyms that represents some variation of their name, personality, or interests. Prime examples include [[Iggy Azalea]] (her name comes from her dog name, Iggy, and her home street in [[Mullumbimby]], Azalea street) [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] (who was known under at least six aliases), [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] (previously known at various times as Puffy, P. Diddy, and Puff Daddy), [[Ludacris]], [[Flo Rida]] (his name is a tribute to his home state, [[Florida]]), [[LL Cool J]], and [[Chingy]]. [[Black metal]] artists also adopt pseudonyms, usually symbolizing dark values, such as [[Nocturno Culto]], [[Gaahl]], Abbath, and Silenoz. In punk and hardcore punk, singers and band members often replace their real names with "tougher"-sounding stage names, such as [[Sid Vicious]] (real name John Simon Ritchie) of the late 1970s band [[Sex Pistols]] and "Rat" of the early 1980s band [[The Varukers]] and the 2000s re-formation of [[Discharge (band)|Discharge]]. Punk rock band [[The Ramones]] also had every member take the last name of Ramone.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Henry John Deutschendorf Jr., an American [[singer-songwriter]] used the stage name [[John Denver]]. The Australian country musician born Robert Lane changed his name to [[Tex Morton]]. Reginald Kenneth Dwight legally changed his name to [[Elton John]] in 1972.

'''Raymond Ian Page''' (25 September 1924 – 10 March 2012) was a British historian of [[Anglo-Saxon]] England and the [[Viking Age]], and a renowned [[Runology|runologist]] who specialised in the study of [[Anglo-Saxon runes]].

==Biography==
Page was born in [[Sheffield]] in 1924, and was educated at [[King Edward VII School (Sheffield)|King Edward VII School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ Cite web | title=The Old Edwardian | url= http://oldedwardians.org.uk/newsletters/97.OENewsletter.html | publisher=The Old Edwardians Association | date=18 July 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9158876/Professor-Raymond-Page.html "Professor Raymond Page"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 21 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; His family circumstances required him to leave school at the age of 16. In 1942 he took a course in mechanical engineering at Rotherham Technical College, applying thereafter for a commission in the Royal Navy. After the war, on discharge from the Navy, he was able as an ex-serviceman to obtain a place as an undergraduate at the [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;ref name="asnc-2012-03-12"&gt;{{Cite web | title=Professor Raymond Page | url=http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/news/2012/03/13/1071/ | publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] | date=13 March 2012 | accessdate=13 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating in English, he spent a year in Copenhagen working on an MA and then moved to the University of Nottingham, where he was appointed to an assistant lectureship in English in 1951 and completed his doctoral dissertation on ''The Inscriptions of the Anglo-Saxon Rune-Stones'' in 1959.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1=Page | first1=Raymond Ian | last2=Parsons | first2=David | title=Runes and Runic Inscriptions: Collected Essays on Anglo-Saxon and Viking Runes | publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer | year=1995 | isbn=9780851155999 | pages=xi, 332 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Page joined the faculty at the [[University of Cambridge]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/about-corpus/newstest/982-professor-raymond-page-1924-2012 Professor Raymond Page 1924 – 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427123357/http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/about-corpus/newstest/982-professor-raymond-page-1924-2012 |date=27 April 2012 }}, News, [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] (giving his date of death incorrectly as 11 March).&lt;/ref&gt; where he was a lecturer, and later reader, in [[Old Norse]] language and literature.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; In 1965 he was appointed Parker Librarian at the [[Parker Library, Corpus Christi College]], and in 1984 he was appointed [[Elrington and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon]]. He held these two prestigious posts until his retirement in 1991.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=ASNC&gt;[http://www.asnc.cam.ac.uk/news/2012/03/13/1071/ Professor Raymond Page], News, Anglo-Saxon, Norse &amp; Celtic, 13 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=magic&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=162165&amp;sectioncode=22|title=Runes minus magic|last=Barnes|first=Michael P.|date=6 September 1996|work=[[Times Higher Education]]|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to work at Corpus Christi after his retirement in an out-of-the-way office which he called 'Paradise' because it was so hard to reach.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

==Academic reputation==
[[Rudolf Simek]] said that Page "is widely acknowledged as ''the'' authority on Old English runes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Simek|first=Simek|year=2001|title=Rev. of Page, ''An Introduction to English Runes''|journal=[[Albion: A Quarterly Journal Concerned with British Studies]]|volume=33|issue=3|pages=429–30|jstor=4053201|doi=10.2307/4053201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Elmer Antonsen of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] has noted that "serious study of English runes without Raymond Ian Page... is simply inconceivable";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Antonsen | first=Elmer H. | title=Review of ''Runes and Runic Inscriptions: Collected Essays on Anglo-Saxon and Viking Runes'' | journal=Journal of English and Germanic Philology | volume=97 | issue=3 | year=1998 | page=402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; others praise him as a "meticulous scholar".&lt;ref name=magic/&gt; Page's ''An Introduction to English Runes'' was first published in 1973, and revised and republished in 1999. Page intended it as a prefatory publication to a complete corpus edition of Anglo-Saxon runes, and it was praised for, among other qualities, its "healthy skepticism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Antonsen|first=Elmer H.|year=1977|title=Rev. of Page, ''An Introduction to English Runes''|journal=[[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]|volume=76|issue=1|pages=56–57|jstor=27708114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in 2003, it remained "the only book-length study providing a comprehensive and scholarly guide to the Anglo-Saxon use of runes", and the revised edition was deemed as authoritative as the first one was in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hines|first=John|year=2003|title=Rev. of Page, ''An Introduction to English Runes''|journal=[[Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]|volume=102|issue=1|pages=128–30|jstor=27712313}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his work was aimed at a general readership, but many of his scholarly articles were collected in 1995 in ''Runes and Runic Inscriptions: Collected Essays on Anglo-Saxon and Viking Runes.''&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

Page called himself a 'sceptical' runologist, demonstrating that runes were most often used for mundane purposes and arguing against their 'romantic' association with the occult.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

In 1996 he was awarded an [[List of Honorary Doctors of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology|honorary doctorate at The Norwegian University of Sceince and Technology (NTNU)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntnu.edu/phd/honorary-doctors|title=Honorary Doctors|last=|first=|date=|website=www.ntnu.edu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1953 Page married Elin Hustad; they had two daughters and a son. True to his Yorkshire roots, he would not permit red roses in his garden.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; Known as a connoisseur of real ale and single-malt whisky, he was presented on his 70th birthday with an oak manuscript conservation box specially made to contain a bottle of whisky, with its spine embossed with the title ''The Runes of Jura''.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

'''Respect Renewal''' was a faction that existed during the 2007-8 split within [[Respect – The Unity Coalition]], a UK political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.respectrenewal.org/content/view/58/74/|title=Respect Constitution|publisher=Respect Renewal|year=2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080428005317/http://www.respectrenewal.org/content/view/58/74/|archivedate=28 April 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect Renewal was led by Linda Smith, the National Chair, Leader and Nominating Officer of Respect, and was formed in November 2007. Its supporters included [[George Galloway]], [[Ken Loach]], Victoria Brittain, [[Salma Yaqoob]] and Nick Wrack.

==History==
{{main|Respect - The Unity Coalition#The split in Respect}}
In September 2007, Galloway wrote a letter to Respect's national council members saying that the party was "too disorganised" and "faced oblivion" unless it reformed its internal party management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themuslimweekly.com/fullstoryview.aspx?NewsID=215082B330A483E173B045F1&amp;MENUID=HOMENEWS&amp;DESCRIPTION=UK%20News|title=Galloway slams own Respect party|work=[[The Muslim Weekly]]|date=14 September 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105232630/http://www.themuslimweekly.com/fullstoryview.aspx?NewsID=215082B330A483E173B045F1&amp;MENUID=HOMENEWS&amp;DESCRIPTION=UK%20News|archivedate=5 November 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of a dispute within Respect between Galloway and his supporters and the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) on the other side.

On 3 November 2007, Galloway's camp announced plans to hold the Respect Renewal conference on 17 November, the same day as the planned national conference of Respect. The Respect Renewal conference was an open event and organisers claim 350 people attended, comparable with the Respect national conference, although the figure was disputed by [[Chris Harman]] in the SWP's ''[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=396&amp;issue=117|title=The Crisis in Respect|accessdate=5 January 2008|work=International Socialism|year=2008|author=Chris Harman|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331122555/http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=396&amp;issue=117|archivedate=31 March 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This split continued with both Respect Renewal and the SWP-led faction claiming to be the real Respect. Respect Renewal, through Linda Smith, had control over the use of the Respect name in elections, while the SWP-led faction used the electoral label [[Left List]], but did control the original Respect website. Both the Respect Renewal faction, as 'Respect (George Galloway)', and Left List stood in the [[London Assembly election, 2008|2008 London Assembly elections]]. Neither party won a seat or did as well as Respect did in the [[London Assembly election, 2004|2004 elections]], but 'Respect (George Galloway)' outpolled Left List.

The split was finally resolved in October 2008, when the Left List ended its claim on the Respect name.

==Criticisms of Respect Renewal==
The SWP has attributed the split within Respect to a shift to the right by George Galloway and his allies, motivated by electoralism (placing election-winning above other principles). This, according to the SWP leadership, led to attacks on the SWP as the most prominent left group in Respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swp.org.uk/respect_cc.php|title=The record: The Socialist Workers Party and Respect|author=SWP Central Committee Statement|date=3 November 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907150924/http://www.swp.org.uk/respect_cc.php|archivedate=7 September 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation of events is countered by Respect Renewal, which criticises the SWP for opportunism and lack of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1407/respect_cc.php|title=The SWP’s ever-increasing welter of allegations and distortions|author=Alan Thornett, Respect National Council Member|date=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of poems by '''[[Robert E. Howard]]''' (1906–1936), an American writer and poet in early 20th century Texas. His love of poetry came from being read to by his mother at a young age. However, his attempts to make a living by poetry were unsuccessful and he is today most remembered for his short stories and fiction. Nevertheless, Howard wrote hundreds of poems; many were published within his lifetime and the others published after his 1936 suicide.

The lack of information in a column does not necessarily mean that the information does not exist, only that verifiable information is not currently available. For example, the lack of publication information does not necessarily mean that a poem has not been published to date, nor does the lack of a definite note about the public domain indicate that a poem is still under copyright.

This table may be sorted by different columns by clicking on the icon in the appropriate column.  Clicking the icon again will alternate between ascending and descending order.

;Additional notes:

'''Title/Alternative title:''' Some poems are known by multiple titles.  Alternative titles are shown in the column of the same name. Every effort has been made to list full information at all entries for each title, to save the user time in scrolling. Occasionally, alternative titles appear consecutively, in which case the second entry will follow without additional information, shown in a darker gray on the table.  In other cases, some poems were not titled by Howard or the original title has not survived. Some poems have been given tentative titles after Howard's death; this is indicated in the Notes column. Where multiple titles exist, they have been listed alphabetically by their various designations following the word "Untitled."  Some pieces of poetry were used by Howard as [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraphs]] within his stories. {{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|loc=}} listed these poems under the title of the short story rather than the title of the poem itself, so the poems are listed under those titles as well.  With epigraphs, the first publication information given in this table is that of the poem's first printing separated from the story.

'''Lines:''' The number of lines in the poem.

'''Source text:''' Links given in the Source Text column are to copies of the poem in online libraries (where available). For ease of browsing the table, these links are preceded by a small icon. For example, [[Image:Wikisource-logo.svg|15px]] for poems on [[Wikisource]].

'''References:''' Bibliographic references are given in the final column of each row.  The exception to this is the Notes column; as notes may come from diverse sources, or from a separate part of one of the main sources, each individual note is followed by its own reference.

* {{note|progress|J}} ''The Progress'' was published by Cross Plains High School.

;Notes on short hand
* {{note|letter|K}} All or part of these poems are from or were included in a letter from Robert E. Howard to some recipient (the date is either the explicit date on the letter, an approximate dating of the letter where possible or else simply marked undated).  e.g. "Letter: Tevis Clyde Smith, June 23, 1926" indicates that the poem is from a letter to Tevis Clyde Smith dated June 23, 1926.
* {{note|pd|L}} These poems are in the public domain in the United States and any country where the Rule of the Shorter Term applies. {{Harv|Herman|2007|loc=Poems}}
* {{note|conflict|M}} With these poems, two or more sources give different publications and dates of the first appearance. e.g. "Conflict: {{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=186}}, ''The Howard Collector'', 1962/{{Harvtxt|Herman|2006|p=204}}, ''The Junto'', 1929" indicates that {{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=186}} states first publication as ''The Howard Collector'' (published in 1962), while {{Harvtxt|Herman|2006|p=204}} states first publication as ''The Junto'' (published in 1929).  Always listed with the earliest date first.
* {{note|version|N}} Howard sometimes used the same title more than once, or the same title has been attached to untitled works by others.  In these cases the poems have been numbered to distinguish them.  e.g. "(2)" following the title indicates that this the second poem with the same name.
* {{note|penname|O}} These poems were published under a [[pen name]].  e.g. "Pen name: Patrick Howard" indicated that the poem was published under the pen name Patrick Howard.
* {{note|notus|P}} These poems were first published in a non-American publication. e.g. "French" indicates that it was first published in a French book or magazine.
* {{note|justin|R}} &lt;!--skipped Q, too similar to O--&gt; These poems are attributed to "Justin Geoffrey," a fictional poet Howard created for his fiction.
* {{note|epigraph|S}} These poems were originally used as epigraphs, heading chapter and whole stories, in works of prose fiction.  This list shows where they were printed separately from the prose.  e.g. "Epigraph: ''The Phoenix on the Sword''" indicates that the poem was used as an opening in the short story ''The Phoenix on the Sword''.
* {{note|from|T}} These poems were part of a different work, usually prose fiction, but were not used to open the work or head chapters.  This list shows where they were printed separately from the main work, if at all. e.g. "From: ''Men of the Shadows''" indicates that this poem was originally included in, or part of, the short story''Men of the Shadows''.
* {{note|lost|U}} Poems with these titles are on record but no known copy exists today.

'''Robotic mapping''' is a discipline related to [[computer vision]]&lt;ref name="Juan-Antonio2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fernández-Madrigal, Juan-Antonio|title=Simultaneous Localization and Mapping for Mobile Robots: Introduction and Methods: Introduction and Methods|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JbaeBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22computer%20vision%22&amp;f=false|date=30 September 2012|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-4666-2105-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cartography]]. The goal for an [[autonomous robot]] is to be able to construct (or use) a map (outdoor use) or [[floor plan]] (indoor use) and to localize itself and its recharging bases or  beacons in it. Robotic mapping is that branch which deals with the study and application of ability to localize itself in a map / plan and sometimes to  
construct the map or floor plan by the autonomous robot.
 
Evolutionarily shaped blind action may suffice to keep some animals alive. For some [[insect]]s for example, the environment is not interpreted as a map, and they survive only with a triggered response. A slightly more elaborated navigation strategy dramatically enhances the capabilities of the robot. [[Cognitive map]]s enable planning capacities and use of current perceptions, memorized events, and expected consequences.

== Operation ==
The robot has two sources of information: the [[idiothetic]] and the [[allothetic]] sources. When in motion, a robot can use [[dead reckoning]] methods such as tracking the number of revolutions of its wheels; this corresponds to the [[idiothetic]] source and can give the absolute position of the robot, but it is subject to cumulative error which can grow quickly.

The [[allothetic]] source corresponds the sensors of the robot, like a camera, a microphone, [[laser]], [[lidar]] or [[sonar]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} The problem here is "[[perceptual aliasing]]". This means that two different places can be perceived as the same. For example, in a building, it is nearly impossible to determine a location solely with the visual information, because all the corridors may look the same.&lt;ref&gt;Filliat, David, and Jean-Arcady Meyer. "[http://hal.upmc.fr/docs/00/65/54/73/PDF/Filliat-Meyer_Navigation_Cartes.pdf Map-based navigation in mobile robots:: I. a review of localization strategies]." Cognitive Systems Research 4.4 (2003): 243-282.&lt;/ref&gt; 3-dimensional models of a robot's environment can be generated using [[3D scanner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Surmann, Hartmut, Andreas Nüchter, and Joachim Hertzberg. "[http://www2.inf.uni-osnabrueck.de/hertzberg/Papers/SurmannEtAlRAAS-2003.pdf An autonomous mobile robot with a 3D laser range finder for 3D exploration and digitalization of indoor environments]." Robotics and Autonomous Systems 45.3-4 (2003): 181-198.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Map representation ==
The internal representation of the map can be "metric" or "topological": 
*The metric framework is the most common for humans and considers a two-dimensional space in which it places the objects. The objects are placed with precise coordinates. This representation is very useful, but is sensitive to noise and it is difficult to calculate the distances precisely.
*The topological framework only considers places and relations between them. Often, the distances between places are stored. The map is then a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]], in which the nodes corresponds to places and arcs correspond to the paths.

Many techniques use probabilistic representations of the map, in order to handle uncertainty.

There are three main methods of map representations, i.e., free space maps, object maps, and composite maps. These employ the notion of a grid, but permit the resolution of the grid to vary so that it can become finer where more accuracy is needed and more coarse where the map is uniform.

== Map learning ==
Map learning cannot be separated from the localization process, and a difficulty arises when errors in localization are incorporated into the map. This problem is commonly referred to as [[Simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM).

An important additional problem is to determine whether the robot is in a part of environment already stored or never visited. One way to solve this problem is by using [[electric beacon]]s, [[Near field communication]] (NFC), [[WiFi]],  [[Visible light communication]] (VLC) and [[Li-Fi]] and [[Bluetooth]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.indooratlas.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Path planning ==
[[motion planning|Path planning]] is an important issue as it allows a robot to get from point A to point B. Path planning algorithms are measured by their computational complexity. The feasibility of real-time motion planning is dependent on the accuracy of the map (or [[floorplan]]), on robot localization and on the number of obstacles. Topologically, the problem of path planning is related to the [[shortest path problem]] of finding a route between two nodes in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]].

== Robot navigation {{anchor|Navigation}}==
{{main|Robot navigation}}
[[Outdoor]] robots can use GPS in a similar way to [[automotive navigation system]]s.

Alternative systems can be used with [[floor plan]] and beacons instead of [[map]]s for [[indoor]] robots, combined with localization wireless hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://ijme.us/issues/spring2014/Z__IJME%20spring%202014%20v14%20n2%20(PDW-3).pdf#page=30|title = An Autonomous Passive RFID-Assisted Mobile Robot System for Indoor Positioning|publisher = |accessdate = 19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electric beacon]]s can help for cheap robot navigational systems.

The '''Shapell Manuscript Foundation''' '''(SMF)''' is a non-profit independent educational organization dedicated to research and the collection of historical documents and original manuscripts. The Foundation focuses on the histories of the United States and the [[Holy Land]],  with emphasis on the people and events of the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shapell Manuscript Foundation|url=http://www.vintageallies.com/General/shapell-manuscript-foundation.html|website=Vintage Allies|accessdate=8 July 2014|date=3 June 2012|quote=The foundation's focus is on the histories of the United States and the Holy Land, with emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==

The Shapell Manuscript Collection is a private holding of primary source documents&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benjamin Shapell Family Manuscript Foundation|url=http://cargocollective.com/tairbarkay/Benjamin-Shapell-Family-Manuscript-Foundation|website=Cargo Collective|accessdate=8 July 2014|quote=The Benjamin Shapell Family Manuscript Foundation foundation is a private collection of manuscripts, exploring the jewish and american relationship throughout the years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  relating to various events and historical figures in American, Jewish, and Holy Land history. Included in the Collection are signed documents, photographs and rare books. It is particularly rich with items from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, [[Mark Twain]], [[Albert Einstein]], and many other historical figures.  Among the many noteworthy items are exceptional letters written by [[George Washington]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], and [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hnn.us/article/154714|website=History News Network|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=8 July 2014|date=2-12-14|year=2014|title=Grover Cleveland, Lover? Read the Love Letter He Wrote to His 21-Year-Old Bride}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Website==
The Shapell Manuscript Foundation's website offers a large digitized selection of the Collection online for public viewing and research. The online Collection is continuously expanding its offerings of primary source documents and historical artifacts as the digitization process continues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collection|url=http://www.shapell.org/collection.aspx|website=Shapell Manuscript Foundation|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Shapell Roster Project==

The Shapell Roster Project is the ongoing research of Jewish Civil War soldiers and their stories.  As part of the Foundation's contribution to the Civil War Sesquicentennial Celebration, the Shapell Manuscript Foundation is preparing a new roster of Jewish Civil War soldiers. The Roster is based on a parallel section in [[Simon Wolf]]'s book, The American Jew as Soldier, Patriot and Citizen, (1895), but uses modern research tools and technology to expand and correct the almost 120-year-old roster.

In addition, the Roster will provide documentation (letters, photographs and official documents) for each soldier discussed in the list. At the completion of the project all information and documents will be available online as well as be available in book form. The Roster is scheduled to be published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sellers|first1=John R.|title=Jewish Participation in the Civil War|url=http://lincolncottage.org/jewish-participation-in-the-civil-war/|publisher=President Lincoln's Cottage|accessdate=8 July 2014|date=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Shapell Roster|url=http://shapellroster.org/about-the-shapell-roster.html|website=Shapell Roster|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish American Historical Research==
In addition to a general focus on the historic manuscripts of universally recognized world-renowned individuals, the foundation's collection frequently relates to the history of American Jewish life. The collected manuscripts explore such topics as the lives of Jewish soldiers during the American Civil War and other topics which bring light to bear on the role of American Jews on the general society around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Menachem M.

==Exhibitions==

The documents and artifacts in the Foundation's holdings have been on display at various exhibitions internationally.  While the Foundation produces its own exhibitions, it also serves as a resource for other institutions' research efforts and exhibitions. The Foundation has collaborated with various historical institutes by creating and enhancing exhibitions with items on loan, and by contributing original research.

The Foundation regularly exhibits at the [[National Library of Israel]] at the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shapell Manuscript Foundation|url=http://merhav.nli.org.il/primo_library/libweb/action/search.do;jsessionid=FC02B0DEC16943F0F635F9AD1B26FD0D?fn=search&amp;ct=search&amp;initialSearch=true&amp;mode=Basic&amp;tab=default_tab&amp;indx=1&amp;dum=true&amp;srt=rank&amp;vid=NLI&amp;frbg=&amp;vl%28freeText0%29=shapell+manuscript+foundation&amp;scp.scps=scope%3A%28NNL%29|website=Merhav|publisher=The National Library of Israel|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The administrative offices are located in the United States and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shapell Manuscript Foundation in Beverly Hills, California (CA)|url=http://www.faqs.org/tax-exempt/CA/Benjamin-Shapell-Family-Foundation.html#overview_a|publisher=FAQS.org|accessdate=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Cullen Davis''' (born September 22, 1933, [[Fort Worth, Texas]]) is an [[United States|American]] oil heir and member of a prominent family. Davis is best known for being acquitted of murder and attempted murder in two high-profile trials during the 1970s. At the time of his first trial, Davis was believed to be the wealthiest man to have stood trial for murder in the United States.

First he was accused of murdering his stepdaughter on August 2, 1976, during a contentious divorce from his second wife, Priscilla Davis. He was found not guilty. The second trial, two years later, involved allegations that Davis attempted to hire a hitman to kill both Priscilla and the judge overseeing his divorce from Priscilla. Again, Davis was acquitted.

==Early life and first trial==
Thomas Cullen Davis was one of three siblings, all male. His father founded KenDavis Industries International, Inc., which manufactured goods used in the petroleum industry.&lt;ref name=CartwrightBook1979&gt;Gary Cartwight (1979) Blood Will Tell: The Murder Trials of T. Cullen Davis, Harcourt, {{ISBN|0151699615}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis and his brothers received equal shares of their father's estate upon his death, and all three were described as possessing keen business instincts.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; At the first trial, Davis's wealth was estimated at over $100 million (${{Inflation|US|100|1976|r=-1|fmt=c}} million today).{{cn|date=June 2018}}

Davis had a reputation in Fort Worth society circles for displays of bad temper and general "creepiness", according to female associates.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Millionaires death case acquittal leaves doubts", ''The Spokesman-Review'', November 21, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; Davis' second marriage was to Priscilla Lee Childers. They were married on August 29, 1968, only hours after the death of his father. It was her third marriage. Priscilla had one daughter from her first marriage, and two children from her second marriage, including Andrea Wilborn.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Gary Cartwright. "Rich Man Dead Man", ''Texas Monthly'' March 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Davis spent $6 million (${{Inflation|US|6|1972|r=-0|fmt=c}} million today) to build [[Stonegate Mansion]], a five-bedroom, 11-bath mansion with an indoor pool and a {{convert|2000|sqft|m2|adj=mid}} master bedroom. In its prime, the luxurious, contemporary home of courtyards, tunnels and balconies at 4100 Mockingbird Lane was decorated with more than 100 oil paintings. The mansion was designed by Albert S. Komatsu and Associates.

Davis and Childers separated in 1974 and both began dating other people openly. A judge granted Priscilla the right to live in the Stonegate property during the divorce proceedings and further authorized substantial spousal and child support payments from Davis to Childers. Her live-in boyfriend was Stan Farr, a former basketball star at nearby [[Texas Christian University]].&lt;ref name=CartwrightBook1979/&gt;

On August 2, 1976, an intruder entered Stonegate Mansion and killed 12-year-old Andrea, who was home alone after returning from a Bible study. The body of Andrea would later be found in the basement, apparently shot [[execution-style killing|execution-style]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; 

When Childers and her then-boyfriend Stan Farr returned home, both were shot. Farr died at the scene. Childers staggered from the house being pursued by the killer as two family friends, Beverly Bass and Gus Gavrel, Jr., drove up to the mansion. The killer shot Gavrel, paralyzing him for life.&lt;ref name=CartwrightBook1979/&gt;

Childers identified Davis to police, saying he had shot her and Farr, wearing no disguise except a wig. Gavrel said he was shot after his companion recognized the gunman as Davis and called him by name. Police arrested Davis that same night, at the home he shared with Karen Master, his then-girlfriend who would become his third wife.

Davis was only tried for the murder of Andrea. He was defended by famous Texas defense attorney [[Richard Haynes (criminal lawyer)|Richard "Racehorse" Haynes]]. The prosecution case relied almost entirely on eyewitness testimony. Earlier the day of the shooting, a judge had ordered Davis's monthly support to Priscilla increased from $3500 to $5000 (${{Inflation|US|3500|1976|r=-1|fmt=c}} to ${{Inflation|US|5000|1976|r=-1|fmt=c}} today) and to pay her legal fees of $25,000 (${{Inflation|US|25000|1976|r=-1|fmt=c}} today) and household expenses of $24,000 (${{Inflation|US|24000|1976|r=-1|fmt=c}} today).&lt;ref&gt;Tom Stephenson (1977). [https://www.dmagazine.com/publications/d-magazine/1977/march/priscilla-davis-cullen-davis-murder-story Is Priscilla Davis' Story True?], dmagazine.com, March 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This change was proposed as a motive for the crimes. Davis did not testify in his own defense. Haynes's defense concentrated on two main points. First, the complete lack of physical evidence linking Davis to the crime (no fingerprints, no firearm linked to the murder, etc.).&lt;ref name=Cartwright1979&gt;Gary Cartwright. [https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/how-cullen-davis-beat-the-rap-2 How Cullen Davis Beat the Rap], TexasMonthly.com,  May 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Second, Haynes focused on the eyewitness testimony, particularly Priscilla. Haynes depicted her as living in two worlds: Fort Worth high society, and a milieu of drug dealers, criminals and sleazy sex. Haynes proposed that Priscilla's admitted heavy use of prescription painkillers made her an unreliable witness who might have been confused about the identity of her attacker.&lt;ref name=Cartwright1979/&gt; 

Journalist George Cartwright wrote: "most observers agreed later that the case was won as soon as Haynes completed his cross-examination of Priscilla"; this occurred only two weeks into a three-month trial.&lt;ref name=Cartwright1979/&gt; Davis was found not guilty. Of the trial, prosecutor [[Tim Curry (attorney)|Tim Curry]] said, "We were out-bought and out-thought".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Other trials==
In related civil litigation concerning Wilborn's death following the murder trial, Davis prevailed and was held not liable for her death. The children of Stan Farr later sued Davis for [[wrongful death]] and received a $250,000 out of court settlement.&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maidment|first=Paul|title=All The Money in the World: Criminally Rich|url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/09/14/forbes-400-criminals-biz-cx_pm_0914criminals.html|newspaper=Forbes.com|date=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Davis was arrested again, this time for allegedly hiring a hitman to murder both Priscilla Davis and the judge overseeing their ongoing divorce litigation.&lt;ref name="shuy"&gt;Shuy, Roger W (2001). "Discourse Analysis in the Legal Context", ''The Handbook of Discourse Analysis'' (eds. Deborah Schiffrin, Deborah Tannen, and Heidi E. Hamilton). Oxford: [[Blackwell Publishing]], pp. 438-39.&lt;!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The case largely hinged on a tape-recorded conversation between Davis and David McCrory, an [[undercover]] employee posing as a hitman for hire which was recorded in the parking lot of the Denny's restaurant where Davis was arrested. In the recording, Davis was alleged to have asked the undercover employee to murder his wife and the judge. The trial of ''Texas v. Cullen T. Davis'' was one of the first uses of [[Forensic linguistics|forensic discourse analysis]] on tape-recorded evidence in a legal setting in the United States.&lt;ref name="shuy"/&gt; 

A discourse analyst testified that Davis' words in the tape did not constitute solicitation of murder. Haynes again defended Davis. He again attacked the prosecution's physical evidence: Davis's fingerprints were not found on critical pieces of evidence, such as the cash he allegedly paid to the McCrory.&lt;ref name=Cartwright1979/&gt; Unlike the first trial, Davis testified in his own defense. He stated that he had not solicited McCrory's offer to kill Priscilla and the judge, and claimed it was a plot orchestrated by her to frame him. Davis claimed he merely played along with the plot in an attempt to eventually convince McCrory to admit that Priscilla was to blame for the entire scheme.&lt;ref name=Cartwright1979/&gt; 

Unlike the first trial where observers were convinced that David would likely be acquitted, opinion was split in the second trial with the general consensus being that Davis's best hope was a [[hung jury]].&lt;ref name=Cartwright1979/&gt; After a lengthy trial Davis was acquitted a second time.&lt;ref name=Cartwright1979/&gt;

==Later life==
According to [[truTV]], Davis lost most of his oil fortune in the recession of the 1980s, and eventually declared bankruptcy. Cullen and Karen Davis sold their home and {{convert|300|acre|ha|adj=on}} property to a real estate developer in 1984. Davis continues to live in the Fort Worth area, while his wife Karen died of organ failure on September 22, 2016. Davis in later life became a born-again Christian, and at one point worked with controversial televangelist [[James Robison (televangelist)|James Robison]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.upi.com/Archives/1983/01/11/Evangelist-James-Robison-and-millionaire-T-Cullen-Davis-last/1963411109200/&lt;/ref&gt;

Priscilla Lee Childers died of [[breast cancer]] on February 19, 2001, still adamantly insisting on Davis' guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2011/06/06/buying-justice|title=Buying justice|date=6 June 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States involvement in regime change''' has entailed both overt and covert actions aimed at altering, replacing, or preserving foreign governments. In the latter half of the 19th century, the [[U.S. government]] initiated actions for [[regime change]] mainly in Latin America and the southwest Pacific, and included the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican–American]], [[Spanish–American War|Spanish–American]] and [[Philippine–American War|Philippine–American]] wars. At the onset of the 20th century the United States shaped or installed friendly governments in many countries including [[History of Panama#US involvement|Panama]], [[History of Honduras#The Rise of United States influence in Honduras (1899–1919)|Honduras]], [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]], [[United States occupation of Veracruz|Mexico]], [[United States occupation of Haiti|Haiti]], and the [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–24)|Dominican Republic]].

In the aftermath of [[World War II]], the U.S. government expanded the geographic scope of its actions to foster regime change, as the country struggled with the [[Soviet Union]] for global leadership and influence within the context of the [[Cold War]]. Significant operations included the U.S. and UK-orchestrated [[1953 Iranian coup d'état]], the 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] targeting Cuba, the [[Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66|anti-communist purge]] in Indonesia, and support for the Argentinian [[Dirty War]], in addition to the U.S.'s traditional area of operations, [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]].  In addition, the U.S. has [[Foreign electoral intervention|interfered]] in the national elections of many countries, including in [[Japan]] in the 1950s and 1960s to keep its preferred center-right [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]] in power using secret funds, in the [[Philippines]] to orchestrate the campaign of [[Ramon Magsaysay]] for president in 1953, and in [[Lebanon]] to help Christian parties in the 1957 elections using secret cash infusions.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 13, 2016, "The Long History of the US Interfering with Elections Elsewhere," https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/13/the-long-history-of-the-u-s-interfering-with-elections-elsewhere/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616141032/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/10/13/the-long-history-of-the-u-s-interfering-with-elections-elsewhere/ |date=June 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. has executed at least 81 overt and covert known interventions in foreign elections during the period 1946–2000.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]]'', February 17, 2019, "Russia Isn't the Only One Meddling in Elections, We Do It, Too," https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/sunday-review/russia-isnt-the-only-one-meddling-in-elections-we-do-it-too.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219201141/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/sunday-review/russia-isnt-the-only-one-meddling-in-elections-we-do-it-too.html |date=February 19, 2018 }} ''citing'' [[Conflict Management and Peace Science]], September 19, 2016 "Partisan Electoral Interventions by the Great Powers: Introducing the PEIG Dataset," http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0738894216661190&lt;/ref&gt;

Also after World War II, the United States in 1945 ratified&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Foundation, August 20, 2015, "The American Ratification of the UN Charter," http://unfoundationblog.org/the-american-ratification-of-the-un-charter/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160910061820/http://unfoundationblog.org/the-american-ratification-of-the-un-charter/ |date=September 10, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[UN Charter]], the preeminent international law document,&lt;ref&gt;Mansell, Wade and Openshaw, Karen, "International Law: A Critical Introduction," Chapter 5, Hart Publishing, 2014, https://books.google.com/booksid=XYrqAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT140&lt;/ref&gt; which legally bound the U.S. government to the Charter's provisions, including Article 2(4), which prohibits the threat or use of force in international relations, except in very limited circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;"All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."

Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the United States has led or supported wars to determine the governance of a number of countries. Stated U.S. aims in these conflicts have included fighting the [[War on Terror]] as in the 2001 [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghan war]], or removing dictatorial and hostile regimes in the 2003 [[Iraq War]] and [[2011 military intervention in Libya]].

== 19th century interventions ==
=== 1846: U.S.–Mexico War ===

[[File:Wpdms mexican cession.png|250 px|right]]
The [[Mexican–American War]] was an armed conflict between the United States of America and [[Mexico]] from 1846 to 1848 in the wake of the 1845 U.S. [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]], which Mexico considered part of its territory despite the 1836 [[Texas Revolution]].

American forces occupied [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|New Mexico]] and [[Alta California|California]], then invaded parts of Northeastern Mexico and Northwestern Mexico; Another American army captured Mexico City, and the war ended with a victory for the United States. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] specified the major consequence of the war: the forced [[Mexican Cession]] of the territories of [[Alta California]] and [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|New Mexico]] to the U.S. in exchange for $18 million. In addition, the United States forgave debt owed by the Mexican government to U.S. citizens. Mexico accepted the loss of Texas and thereafter cited the [[Rio Grande]] as its national border. The war did not result in a regime change in Mexico.

=== 1887–1889: Samoa ===

[[File:Samoa in Oceania (small islands magnified).svg|250 px|right]]
The [[Samoan crisis]] was a confrontation between the United States, [[Germany]] and [[Great Britain]] from 1887 to 1889, with the powers backing rival claimants to the throne of the [[Samoan Islands]] during the [[Samoan Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Stevenson, Robert Louis |title=A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa |year=1892 |publisher=BiblioBazaar |isbn=978-1-4264-0754-3|title-link=A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Second Samoan Civil War]] followed in 1898, involving the US (who backed the incumbent king) and Germany, eventually resulting, via the [[Tripartite Convention]] of 1899, in the partition of the Samoan Islands into [[American Samoa]] and [[German Samoa]].&lt;ref&gt;Ryden, George Herbert.

== 1893–1917: U.S. empire and expansionism ==

=== 1890s ===

==== 1893: Kingdom of Hawaii ====
[[File:Hawaii in Oceania (-mini map -rivers).svg|250 px|right]]
Anti-monarchial elements, mostly Americans, in [[Hawaii]], engineered the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow]] of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]]. On January 17, 1893, the native monarch, Queen [[Liliuokalani|Lili'uokalani]], was overthrown. Hawaii was initially reconstituted as an independent [[republic]], but the ultimate goal of the action was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which was finally accomplished in 1898.

==== 1898: Cuba and Puerto Rico ====
{{See also|Banana Wars}}
[[File:Cuba in its region.svg|250 px|right]]
As part of the [[Spanish–American War]], the United States invaded and occupied Spanish-ruled [[Cuba]] and [[Puerto Rico]] in 1898. [[History of Cuba|Cuba]] was occupied by the U.S. from 1898 to 1902 under military governor [[Leonard Wood]], and again from 1906 to 1909, in 1912 and from 1917 to 1922; governed by the terms of the [[Platt Amendment]] through 1934.

[[File:Puerto Rico in its region.svg|250 px|right]]
The [[Puerto Rican Campaign]] was an American military sea and land operation on the island of [[Puerto Rico]] during the [[Spanish–American War]]. The [[United States Navy]] attacked the [[archipelago]]'s colonial capital, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. Though the damage inflicted on the city was minimal, the Americans were able to establish a [[blockade]] in the city's harbor, [[San Juan Bay]]. The land offensive began on July 25 with 1,300 infantry soldiers. All military actions in Puerto Rico were suspended on August 13, after U.S. President [[William McKinley]] and French Ambassador [[Jules Cambon]], acting on behalf of the Spanish government, signed an [[armistice]] whereby Spain relinquished its sovereignty over the territories of Puerto Rico, Cuba, the [[Philippines]] and [[Guam]].

==== 1899: Philippines ====
[[File:Philippines in its region.svg|250 px|right]]
The [[Philippine–American War]] was part of a series of conflicts in the [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|Philippine struggle for independence]] against United States occupation. Fighting erupted between US and Filipino revolutionary forces on February 4, 1899, and quickly escalated into the 1899 [[Battle of Manila (1899)|Battle of Manila]]. On June 2, 1899, the First Philippine Republic officially declared war against the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kalaw|1927|Ref=Kalaw1927appC|pp=[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=philamer&amp;cc=philamer&amp;idno=afj2233.0001.001&amp;frm=frameset&amp;view=image&amp;seq=219&amp;size=100 199–200]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war officially ended on July 4, 1902.&lt;ref name=worcester1914p180&gt;{{Harvnb|Worcester|1914|p=[https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=56151&amp;pageno=180 180 in The Philippines: Past and Present (Volume 1 of 2) by Dean C.  Worcester] |Ref=worcester1914ch9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This US intervention was intended to prevent regime change, and retain US control over the Philippines.

==== 1898–1901: China ====
[[File:Ching Dynasty 1892.png|250 px|right]]
The [[Boxer Rebellion]] was a proto-[[Chinese nationalism|nationalist]] movement in [[China]] between 1898 and 1901, so called because it was led by fighters who called themselves the Society of the Righteous and Harmonious Fists. The United States was part of an [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] that brought 20,000 armed troops to China, defeated the Imperial Chinese Army, and captured [[Beijing]]. The Eight-Nation Alliance was a military [[coalition]] formed to defeat the rebellion, and the eight nations, in addition to the US, were [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Russian Empire|Russia]], [[British Empire|Britain]], [[French Third Republic|France]], the [[German Empire|Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] and [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name="Gardner2016"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hall Gardner |title=The Failure to Prevent World War I: The Unexpected Armageddon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R-K_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127 |date=March 16, 2016 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-03217-5 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1900s ===

==== 1903: Panama ====
[[File:Pm-map.png|250 px|right]]
In 1903, the U.S. aided the [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|secession of Panama from the Republic of Colombia]]. The secession was engineered by a [[Panama]]nian faction backed by the Panama Canal Company, a French–US corporation whose aim was the construction of a waterway across the [[Isthmus of Panama]] thus connecting the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s. In 1903, the U.S. signed the [[Hay-Herrán Treaty]] with Colombia, granting the United States use of the Isthmus of Panama in exchange for financial compensation.&lt;ref&gt;This Day in History, "November 3: 1903 Panama Declares Independence," https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/panama-declares-independence {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312144932/https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/panama-declares-independence |date=March 12, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a state speech in December 1903, [[President Theodore Roosevelt]] put the number of "revolutions, rebellions, insurrections, riots, and other outbreaks" in Panama at 53, within the space of 57 years. in "Theodore Roosevelt's third state of the union address":http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt%27s_Third_State_of_the_Union_Address {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502210448/http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt%27s_Third_State_of_the_Union_Address |date=May 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; amidst the [[Thousand Days' War]]. The [[Panama Canal]] was already under construction, and the [[Panama Canal Zone]] was carved out and placed under United States sovereignty. The US did not transfer the zone back to Panama until 2000.

==== 1900s–1920s: Honduras ====
[[File:Honduras in its region.svg|250 px|right]]
In what became known as the "[[Banana Wars]]," between the end of the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898 and the inception of the [[Good Neighbor Policy]] in 1934, the U.S. staged many military invasions and interventions in [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mark T. |last=Gilderhusrt |title=The Second Century: U.S.–Latin American Relations Since 1889 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2000 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Marine Corps]], which most often fought these wars, developed a manual called ''[[Small Wars Manual|The Strategy and Tactics of Small Wars]]'' in 1921 based on its experiences. On occasion, the [[United States Navy|Navy]] provided [[Naval gunfire support|gunfire support]] and [[United States Army|Army]] troops were also used. The [[United Fruit Company]] and [[Standard Fruit Company]] dominated [[History of Honduras|Honduras]]' key [[banana]] export sector and associated land holdings and railways. The U.S. staged invasions and incursions of US troops in 1903 (supporting a coup by [[Manuel Bonilla]]), 1907 (supporting Bonilla against a Nicaraguan-backed coup), 1911 and 1912 (defending the regime of [[Miguel R. Davila]] from an uprising), 1919 (peacekeeping during a civil war, and installing the caretaker government of [[Francisco Bográn]]), 1920 (defending the Bográn regime from a general strike), 1924 (defending the regime of [[Rafael López Gutiérrez]] from an uprising) and 1925 (defending the elected government of [[Miguel Paz Barahona]]) to defend US interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.truman.edu/~marc/resources/interventions.html |title=History of U.S. Interventions in Latin America |first=Marc |last=Becker |website=www2.truman.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[O. Henry]] coined the term "[[Banana republic]]" in 1904 to describe Honduras.

=== 1910s ===

==== 1912–1933: Nicaragua ====
[[File:Nicaragua in its region.svg|250 px|right]]
The U.S. government [[United States occupation of Nicaragua|invaded]] [[Nicaragua]] in 1912 after intermittent US military landings and naval bombardments in the previous decades. The U.S. was providing political support to conservative-led forces who were rebelling against President [[José Santos Zelaya]], a liberal. U.S. motives included disagreement with the proposed [[Nicaragua Canal]], since the U.S. controlled the [[Panama Canal Zone]], which included the [[Panama Canal]], and President Zelaya's attempts to regulate access by foreigners to Nicaraguan natural resources.  On November 17, 1909, two Americans were executed by order of Zelaya after the two men confessed to having laid a mine in the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] with the intention of blowing up the ''Diamante''. The U.S. justified the intervention by claiming to protect American lives and property. Zelaya resigned later that year. The U.S. occupied the country almost continuously from 1912 through 1933.

==== 1914: Mexico ====
[[File:Mexico in its region.svg|250 px|right]]
U.S. troops [[United States occupation of Veracruz|invaded]] [[Veracruz]] in [[Mexico]] in 1914 following the [[Tampico Affair]]. The US occupied the city for six months.
{{See also|United States involvement in the Mexican Revolution}}

==== 1915–1934: Haiti ====
[[File:Haiti in its region.svg|250 px|right]]
The U.S. [[United States occupation of Haiti|occupied]] [[Haiti]] from 1915 to 1934. US banks had lent money to Haiti and requested U.S. government intervention. The U.S. installed a new government in 1917 and dictated the terms of a new Haitian [[constitution]] in 1917 that instituted changes that included an end to the prior ban on land ownership by non-Haitians. The [[Cacos (military group)]] were originally armed militias of formerly enslaved persons who rebelled and took control of mountainous areas following the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1804. Such groups fought a guerilla war against the US occupation in what were known as the "[[Caco Wars]]."&lt;ref&gt;Giles A. Hubert, War and the Trade Orientation of Haiti, https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/1053341.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1916–1924: Dominican Republic ====
[[File:Dominican Republic in its region.svg|250 px|right]]
[[U.S. marines]] invaded the [[Dominican Republic]] and [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916–24)|occupied]] the it from 1916 to 1924, and this was preceded by US military interventions in 1903, 1904, and 1914. The [[US Navy]] installed its personnel in all key positions in government and controlled the Dominican army and police.&lt;ref name="Proceedings"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dxNLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA239 |title=Proceedings of the United States Naval Institute |author=United States Naval Institute |year=1879 |location=Annapolis, MD |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a couple of days, the constitutional president, [[Juan Isidro Jimenes]], resigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2niSFlmaSssC&amp;pg=PA49 |title=The Dominican Republic and the United States: From Imperialism to Transnationalism |publisher=Univ. of Georgia Press |author1=Atkins, G.

=== 1918: Russia ===

[[File:Russian civil war in the west.svg|250 px|right]]
After the new [[Bolshevik]] government withdrew from [[World War I]], the U.S. military together with forces of its [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|invaded]] [[Russia]] in 1918. Approximately 250,000 invading soldiers, including troops from Europe, the US and the [[Empire of Japan]] invaded Russia to aid the [[White Army]] against the [[Red Army]] of the new [[Soviet]] government in the [[Russian civil war]]. The invaders launched the [[North Russia Campaign|North Russia invasion]] from [[Arkhangelsk]] and the [[Allied Intervention in Siberia|Siberia invasion]] from [[Vladivostok]].  The invading forces included 13,000 U.S. troops whose mission after the end of World War I included the toppling of the new Soviet government and the restoration of the previous [[Tsarist regime]]. U.S. and other Western forces were unsuccessful in this aim and withdrew by 1920 but the Japanese military continued to occupy parts of [[Siberia]] until 1922 and the northern half of [[Sakhalin]] until 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Rick, "The Greatest Stories Never Told" 2003: A&amp;E Television Networks / The History Channel, pp. 152–153, {{ISBN|0060014016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States government used its contacts in the [[Panama]] National Guard, which the U.S. had earlier trained, to orchestrate a coup against the government of Panama in October 1941. The U.S. had requested that the government of Panama allow it to build over 130 new military installations inside and outside of the [[Panama Canal Zone]], and the government of Panama refused this request at the price suggested by the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Coatsworth, John.

[[File:Koreas in its region.svg|300 px|right]]
As the [[Empire of Japan]] surrendered in August 1945, under the leadership of [[Lyuh Woon-Hyung]] committees throughout [[Korea]] formed to coordinate transition to Korean independence.  On August 28, 1945 these committees formed the temporary national government of Korea, naming it the [[People's Republic of Korea]] (PRK) a couple of weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Landsberg, Martin, Korea: Division, Reunification, &amp; U.S. Foreign Policy, Monthly Review Press (1998), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cumings, Bruce, The Origins of the Korean War, Liberation and the Emergence of Separate Regimes, 1945–1947, Princeton University Press (1981), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; On September 8, 1945, the United States government landed forces in Korea and thereafter established the [[United States Army Military Government in Korea]] (USAMGK) to govern Korea south of the [[38th parallel north]]. The USAMGK staffed the governing administration with Japanese governors and many other Japanese officials who had been part of the brutal Japanese imperial colonial government and with [[Chinilpa|Koreans who had collaborated]] with it, which made the government unpopular and engendered popular resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Hart-Landsberg, Martin, Korea: Division, Reunification, &amp; U.S. Foreign Policy, Monthly Review Press (1998), pp. 63–67, 70–77&lt;/ref&gt; USAMGK refused to recognize the PRK government, which had been formed to self-govern the country, and the [[Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea]], which had been based in [[China]] during [[WWII]] and had fought against the Japanese, and then the USAMGK by military decree outlawed the PRK government.&lt;ref&gt;Cumings, Bruce, "The Autumn Uprising," The Origins of the Korean War, Liberation and the Emergence of Separate Regimes, 1945–1947, Princeton University Press(1981)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Korea Times, June 15, 2015, "Korea Neglects Memory of Provisional Government," http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/03/180_180890.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108190044/http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/03/180_180890.html |date=January 8, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1948, USAMGK sent units to attack Koreans who were seeking Korean independence, and carried out several mass atrocities, including the killing hundreds of Korean civilians on [[Jeju Island]] who were suspected of supporting those in favor of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kim |first=Hunjoon |title=Seeking truth after 50 years: The National Committee for Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju 4.3 events |journal=[[International Journal of Transitional Justice]] |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=406–23 |doi=10.1093/ijtj/ijp014 |date=November 2009 |ref=harv |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The National Committee for Investigation of the Truth about the Jeju April 3  Incident, Jeju 4·3 Peace Foundation, March 29, 2003, "The Jeju 4.3 Incident Investigation Report," http://www.jeju43peace.or.kr/report_eng.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150921114226/http://www.jeju43peace.or.kr/report_eng.pdf |date=September 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Hankyoreh, January 8, 2009, "439 Civilians Confirmed Dead in Yeosu-Suncheon Uprising of 1948: New Report by The Truth Commission Places Blame on Syngman Rhee and The Defense Ministry, Advises Government Apology," http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/332032.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511184103/http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/332032.html |date=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] directed General [[Mark W. Clark]] to formulate a plan to overthrow South Korean President [[Syngman Rhee]], fearing that the political crisis which arose from his authoritarian conduct would imperil military objectives. Operation Everready, as the plan was named, was shelved once Rhee yielded to American pressure and released arrested opposition leaders.

The U.S. government provided military, logistical and other aid to the right-wing [[Kuomintang|Chinese Nationalist Party]] (KMT) army led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]] against [[Chinese Communist Party]] forces.  The US airlifted many KMT troops from central China to [[Manchuria]]. Approximately 50,000 U.S. troops were sent to guard strategic sites in [[Hupeh]] and [[Shandong]].

The British military together with [[Greece|Greek]] forces under control of the Greek government fought for control of the country in the [[Greek Civil War]] against the [[Democratic Army of Greece]] (DSE).

In 1947, the US-backed [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]] (DC), led by [[Alcide De Gasperi]], were losing popularity, and the [[Communist Party of Italy]] (PCI) was growing particularly fast due to its organizing efforts supporting sharecroppers in [[Sicily]], [[Tuscany]] and [[Umbria]], movements which were also bolstered by the reforms of [[Fausto Gullo]], the Communist minister of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;Ginsborg, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=cnGQBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=may%201947&amp;f=false A History of Contemporary Italy]'', pp. 106–113&lt;/ref&gt; The DC engineered the [[May 1947 crises|expulsion of all left-wing ministers from the cabinet]] on May 31.

The U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) acknowledged giving $1 million to Italian [[Centrism|centrist]] parties for the 1948 election. The CIA also publishing forged letters in order to discredit the leaders of the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI). U.S. agencies undertook a campaign of writing ten million letters, made numerous [[short-wave radio]] broadcasts and funded the publishing of books and articles, all of which warned the Italians of what was believed to be the consequences of a communist victory.

CIA pilots, such as [[Allen Lawrence Pope]], piloted planes operated by CIA [[front organization]] [[Civil Air Transport]] (CAT) that bombed civilian and military targets in Indonesia. The CIA instructed CAT pilots to target commercial shipping in order to frighten foreign merchant ships away from Indonesian waters, thereby to weaken the [[Economy of Indonesia|Indonesian economy]] and thus to destabilize the democratically elected government of Indonesia.

On August 9, 1960, Captain [[Kong Le]] with his [[paratroop]] battalion seized control of the administrative capital city of [[Vientiane]] in a bloodless coup on a "Neutralist" platform with the stated aims of ending the [[Laotian Civil War|civil war]] raging in [[Laos]], ending foreign interference in the country, ending the corruption caused by foreign aid, and better treatment for soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[[US Library of Congress]], [[Federal Research Division]], [[Library of Congress Country Studies]], "Laos: The Attempt to Restore Neutrality," https://web.archive.org/web/20041031091831/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd%2Fcstdy%3A%40field%28DOCID%2Bla0039%29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Castle, Timothy, "At War in the Shadow of Vietnam: United States Military Aid to the Royal Lao Government, 1955–1975," ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Columbia University Press]], 1993), pp. 32–33&lt;/ref&gt; With CIA support, [[Field Marshal]] [[Sarit Thanarat]], the prime minister of Thailand, set up a covert Thai military advisory group, called Kaw Taw.

==== 1963: Vietnam ====
Although the United States was allied with [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]], the Kennedy administration had grown increasingly frustrated with South Vietnamese President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]]'s corrupt and repressive rule. In light of Diem's refusal to adopt reforms, American officials debated whether they should support efforts to replace him. These debates resulted in the dispatch of [[Cable 243]] on August 24, 1963, which instructed [[United States Ambassador to South Vietnam]], [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]], to "examine all possible alternative leadership and make detailed plans as to how we might bring about Diem's replacement if this should become necessary". Lodge and his liaison officer, [[Lucien Conein]], established contact with discontented [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] officers and stimulated their resolve to overthrow Diem. These efforts culminated in [[Arrest and assassination of Ngo Dinh Diem|a coup d'etat]] on November 2, 1963, during which Diem and [[Ngô Đình Nhu|his brother]] were assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kinzer |first1=Stephen |title=Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change from Hawaii to Iraq |date=2007 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |location=New York |isbn=978-1-4299-0537-4 |pages=158–166 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pentagon Papers]] concluded that "Beginning in August of 1963 we variously authorized, sanctioned and encouraged the coup efforts of the Vietnamese generals and offered full support for a successor government. In October we cut off aid to Diem in a direct rebuff, giving a green light to the generals. We maintained clandestine contact with them throughout the planning and execution of the coup and sought to review their operational plans and proposed new government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=U.S. and Diem's Overthrow: Step by Step |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/07/01/archives/us-and-diems-overthrow-step-by-step-pentagon-papers-the-diem-coup.html |accessdate=July 21, 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=July 1, 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. launched "Operation Power Pack," a US military operation to interpose the US military between the rebels and the junta's forces so as to prevent the rebel's advance and possibly victory.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanford University]], Fearon, James and Laitin, David, June 27, 2006, "Dominican Republic (Dominican RepublicRN1.2)," pp. 4–6, https://web.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/Random%20Narratives/Dominican%20RepublicRN1.2.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313075753/http://web.stanford.edu/group/ethnic/Random%20Narratives/Dominican%20RepublicRN1.2.pdf |date=March 13, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Times]], November 2, 2001, "Juan Bosch, 92, Freely Elected Dominican President, Dies," https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/02/world/juan-bosch-92-freely-elected-dominican-president-dies.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160829121923/http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/02/world/juan-bosch-92-freely-elected-dominican-president-dies.html |date=August 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most civilian advisers had recommended against immediate intervention hoping that the junta could bring an end to the civil war but [[US President]] [[Lyndon B.

'''UpStage''' is an open source server-side application that has been purpose built for [[Cyberformance]]: multiple artists collaborate in real time via the UpStage platform to create and present live theatrical performances, for audiences who can be online (from anywhere in the world) or in a shared space, and who can interact with the performance via a text chat tool. It can also be understood as a form of [[digital puppetry]]. It is the first open source platform designed specifically for avatar performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nonverbal Communication in Virtual Worlds|last=Tanenbaum|first=Joshua|last2=El-Nasr|first2=Magy Seif|last3=Nixon|first3=Michael|publisher=ETC Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1-304-81204-9|location=USA|pages=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and context==
[[File:Indigenous Maniacs.jpg|thumb|Screengrab from "Indigenous Maniacs", a performance created by UpStage workshop participants at the Computing Women's Congress, Waikato University (NZ), February 2006.]]UpStage was developed during 2003 by programmer [http://halo.gen.nz Douglas Bagnall], to realise the vision of [[cyberformance]] troupe Avatar Body ''Collision''; the group had been creating live performance on the internet using free chat applications such as iVisit and the Palace, and wanted to create an application that better met their artistic needs. The first version of the software was created with a grant from the Smash Palace Collaboration Fund, a joint initiative of [[Creative New Zealand]] and the [[Ministry of Research, Science and Technology (New Zealand)|NZ Ministry for Research, Science and Technology]]; it was launched on 9 January 2004 and began to be used by artists and students around the world, as well as by the originators, Avatar Body ''Collision''.

In 2006, the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the [[Auckland University of Technology]] began a relationship with the UpStage project, which has seen teams of final year software development students work on UpStage as a real-world software development project. This has provided invaluable ongoing maintenance and development for the software.

Also in 2006, UpStage received a second grant, this time from the Community Partnership Fund of the New Zealand government's Digital Strategy, which enabled the development of UpStage V2. Douglas Bagnall was once again the lead developer, working this time in conjunction with the AUT students. UpStage V2 was launched in June 2007, with a two-week exhibition at the [[New Zealand Film Archive]] and the first UpStage festival, 070707. The festival featured 13 performances by artists from around the world and took place over a 12-hour period on 7 July 2007. 

A second festival was held on 080808 (8–9 August 2008), this time covering an 18-hour period and involving artists from at least 14 time zones. It was reviewed in the Australian Stage Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, festivals were held annually on the successive monthly dates until 121212 (12 December 2012) when the festival extended over a period of one week and included cyberformance in UpStage and other online platforms. A number of works from previous festivals were restaged as a retrospective programme within the festival.

Although "131313" was not possible, the tenth birthday of UpStage was celebrated 13 months after 121212, with a mini-festival of three performances and a meeting to discuss the future of UpStage. At this point, UpStage was unfunded and sustained by volunteers and the (also voluntary) work of the AUT student team. The meeting took place physically in Wellington, New Zealand, and online participants joined via UpStage. Everyone agreed that the project should continue - somehow - and also agreed that the software itself needs to be completely redeveloped, in order to take advantage of newer technologies and be more easily developed and maintained by globally dispersed open source developers.

==Features of UpStage==
[[File:Eindhoven02.png|thumb|Screengrab from the cyberformance "We have a situation - Peopoly", performed online in UpStage and at De Bibliotheek Eindhoven on 18 April 2013.]]As a web-based [[server-side]] application, UpStage can be accessed by both performers and audiences from almost any internet connected computer, using any operating system and browser; computers behind [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] may require specific ports to be open, and the browser must have the [[Flash player]] plug-in as this is used to serve the media to the browser.

"Players" (performers) log into UpStage and have access to a "workshop" or backstage area where they can upload media (graphics and audio), create "stages", and assign media to stages. Once on the stage, a logged-in player has access to numerous tools which allow them to manipulate the media - place, move and speak aloud with graphical avatars (using [[Text2Speech|text2speech]]), change backdrops, play audio files, draw directly on the stage in real time, add live web cam feeds, use text chat and perform other tasks in order to create and present a performance.

Audience members (also known as "chatters") do not log in - they simply follow a link from an email or another web page, and arrive at the stage which loads as a web page in their browser. They do not see any of the player tools, but they see and hear everything that the players are creating on the stage, and they can chat in the text chat along with the players. Audience chat appears grey and silent, while player chat is black and spoken aloud.

Newcomers (both players and audience) to UpStage can learn the basics very quickly, and the fact that no additional software download is required (unless the Flash player plug-in is not already installed) makes it very accessible. The chat interface encourages playful banter and audience members contribute to and embellish the performance via the chat.

The media used in UpStage performances is created outside of UpStage, using graphic or audio software. Once optimised for Upstage, it is then uploaded via the web interface known as the Workshop and becomes available to everyone who has a log in for that particular UpStage server.

UpStage is an [[open source]] project; it can be downloaded from the [[GitHub]] site and installed on a web server, giving control over who has log-in access. The interface can also be customised.

'''Valentí Fàbrega i Escatllar''' ([[Barcelona]], 1931) is a [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Philologist]] and [[Theologian]], who lives since 1971 in [[Cologne]].

== Life ==
Valentí Fàbrega i Escatllar was born in 1931 in Barcelona. He belonged until 1971 to the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit Order]]. During this time he got several university degrees ([[Humanities]], [[Philosophy]] and [[Theology]] among others). He became [[Doctor of Theology]] in the [[University of Innsbruck]]. He studied for two years in the Protestant Faculty of Theology of the [[Heidelberg University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fragmenta.cat/ca/autors/4159 Biographical information about these facts]. {{ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also temporary teacher in the Theology College of the Jesuits in [[Sant Cugat del Vallès]] (Barcelona) and in the [[Comillas Pontifical University]] (Madrid). Because of a two-year grant for research that was given to him by the [[Alexander von Humboldt Foundation]], he moved in 1971 to Cologne, and he became German citizen in 1975. There he was teacher for a long time in a Cologne high school of [[Latin]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Religion]]. Later he became also teacher in the [[University of Cologne]], where he taught Spanish language and literature. He is retired since 1996. His main theological researches deal with [[Ecclesiology]] and [[Eschatology]]. Since 1971 he is married with the Protestant Theologian and [[German studies|Germanist]] Inga Weyer-Fabrega.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escatllar.cat/ Biographical information taken from his personal blog] {{de icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Xalapa''' (often spelled '''Jalapa''', {{IPA-es|xaˈlapa|-|XalapaPronunciation.ogg}}; {{IPAc-en|lang|h|ə|ˈ|l|ɑː|p|ə}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jalapa|url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/INV_JED/JALAPA_XALAPA_or_HALAPA.html|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; officially '''Xalapa-Enríquez''' {{IPA-es|xaˈlapa enˈrikes|}}) is the capital city of the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Veracruz]] and the name of the surrounding municipality. In the 2005 census the city reported a population of 387,879 and the [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] of which it serves as municipal seat reported a population of 413,136.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ Link to tables of population data from Census of 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EjXaEdST?url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |date=27 February 2013 }} INEGI: Instituto Nacional de Estadística, Geografía e Informática.&lt;/ref&gt; The municipality has an area of 118.45&amp;nbsp;km². Xalapa lies near the geographic center of the state and is the second-largest city in the state after the city of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] to the southeast.

== Etymology ==
The name Xalapa comes from the [[Nahuatl]] roots xālli [ʃaːlːi] "sand" and āpan [aːpan] "place of water", which means approximately "spring in the sand". It's classically pronounced [[Help:IPA/Nahuatl|[ʃalaːpan]]] in Nahuatl, although the final /n/ is often omitted; the sound [[Voiceless postalveolar fricative|/ʃ/]] (like the English sh) was written x in the 16th century. This doesn't occur in contemporary [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and its modern counterpart (the sound [[Voiceless velar fricative|[x]]] or [[Voiceless glottal fricative|[h]]]) is normally written as j. The spelling Xalapa (like the word México) reflects the old pronunciation. Xalapa is pronounced [[Help:IPA/Spanish|[xalapa] or [halapa]]], the last pronunciation is used principally in [[Mexican Spanish|dialects of Mexico's south]], [[Caribbean Spanish|the Caribbean]], a large part of [[Central American Spanish|Central America]], some places in [[Spanish language in South America|South America]] and [[Andalusian Spanish|the Canary Islands and western Andalusia]] in Spain where [x] has converted into a [[Voiceless glottal fricative|voiceless glottal fricative ([h])]].

The complete name of the city is Xalapa-Enriquez, bestowed in honor of governor from the 19th century, [[Juan de la Luz Enríquez]]. The city's nickname, City of Flowers (Spanish: La ciudad de las flores), was given by [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who visited the city February 10, 1804. The reference is also related to the city's older colonial history. According to folklore, the Spanish believed that Jalapa was the birthplace and home of the world's most beautiful woman, la Florecita, which literally means "little flower". {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The residents of Xalapa are called Xalapeños or [[Jalapeño|Jalapeños]], which is the name given to the large popular peppers cultivated in this area.

==History==
The [[Totonac]]s first established themselves around {{ILL|Macuiltepetl|es}} ("fifth mountain" in Nahuatl).&lt;ref&gt;(Macuilli: five, fifth; Tepetl: hill, mountain).&lt;/ref&gt; This extinct volcano received its name because the [[Aztec]]s used it as the fifth reference mountain to get to the gulf of Mexico's shores. Today it is preserved in a park. During the 14th century, four indigenous peoples settled in the territory today known as Xalapa. Each built a small village: Xalitic (in the sand) was founded by the Totonacas; Techacapan (river of waste) was founded by the [[Chichimec]]as; in the northeast Tecuanapan (river of the beasts) was founded by the [[Toltec]]as, and Tlalnecapan was founded by the Teochichimecas.

Around 1313, the four villages grew together and joined, forming one large village named Xallapan. [[Moctezuma Ilhuicamina]], the fifth [[Aztec]] emperor, invaded the territory during the second half of the 15th century. All the land was ruled as part of the Aztec Empire before the arrival and conquest of the Spanish [[conquistador]]es.

In 1519 [[Hernán Cortés]] passed through en route to [[Tenochtitlan]].&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|135}}  In 1555 Spanish Franciscans completed construction of a [[convent]], an important event in the [[Nueva España]] of that time.
[[Image:Carlos IV de rojo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Charles IV of Spain]] officially elevated the status of Xalapa to town on 18 December 1791.]]
When the Spanish arrived, Xalapa was barely populated. The population rose after the conquest and colonial settlement. When the Spanish improved the Mexico-[[Orizaba]]-[[Veracruz]] route, Xalapa declined in importance as a  transport hub, and its population stagnated in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="MX"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xalapa:Historia |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/veracruz/municipios/30087a.htm |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |accessdate=13 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517094230/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/veracruz/municipios/30087a.htm |archivedate=17 May 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1720 on Xalapa became increasingly important, due to trade with merchants from New Spain arriving to buy and sell the products of the peninsula.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt; Numerous Spanish families from the nearby towns settled in Xalapa, so by 1760 the population had increased to over 1,000 inhabitants, including [[mestizo]] and Spanish. The growth of Xalapa in population, culture, commerce and importance, increased dramatically in the 18th century. Responding to residents' requests, [[Carlos IV of Spain]] declared Xalapa a town on 18 December 1791.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt;

In 1772, construction of [[Xalapa Cathedral]] began. On 18 May 1784, José María Alfaro got the first air [[balloon]] in the Americas, airborne, in Xalapa. Due to the abundance of flowers growing in the region, [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who visited the town on 10 February 1804, christened it the "city of the flowers".&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt;

Since the beginning of the 19th century, Xalapa has been the scene of some important historical events. It supported independence from Spain. Ideas flowed freely in the town, and Xalapa was represented by many who put forward these ideas to those in [[Mexico City]] government meetings.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt; On 20 May 1821, shortly before Mexican Independence on 27 September the same year, Xalapa was attacked by the forces of Don [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]. Together with Don Joaquin Leño, he forced Spanish captain Juan Horbregoso to surrender the town.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt; Independence was gained months later; the first emperor [[Agustín de Iturbide]] was not warmly received in Xalapa due to past differences.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt;
On 9 May 1824, by decree of the President of the Republic Don [[Guadalupe Victoria]], the first legislature of the state of Veracruz was established in Xalapa. That year, Xalapa was declared the state capital.

In the 1820s Xalapa and the surrounding area revolted when [[Vicente Guerrero]] replaced General [[Anastasio Bustamante]]. Veracruz was attacked by [[Isidro Barradas]], who was attempting to reconquer parts of Mexico, and over 3,000{{clarify|date=July 2017}} were deployed in the military defense of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]], [[Córdoba, Veracruz|Córdoba]] and [[Orizaba]].&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt; Anastacio Bustamante, betraying the confidence put him, unsuccessfully revolted against the legitimate government with a new plan of Xalapa{{clarify|date=July 2017}}, signed on 4 December 1829.

On 29 November 1830 by decree, Xalapa was named a city. In 1843, Don Antonio María de Rivera founded the Normal School of Xalapa to train teachers. Today it operates as a preparatory school for students going to college.

In 1847 in the [[Mexican–American War]] Santa Anna attempted to defeat the opposing forces near Xalapa in the [[Battle of Cerro Gordo]]. He led an army of more than 12,000 soldiers. Mexican troops suffered many casualties; around a thousand were killed and three thousand wounded on 18 April 1847. The US invaders occupied the city the following day.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt; Among them was Lt. [[Ulysses S. Grant]], later the commanding general of the Union armies in the [[American Civil War]]. Grant's letters call Jalapa “decidedly the most beautiful place I ever saw in my life” and its climate “the best in the world.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=U.S. Grant |coauthors= |title=Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant; Selected Letters |year=1990 |publisher=Library of America |quote= . . . and from what I saw I would be willing to make Jalapa my home for life with only one condition [that his wife could join him]. | url= |isbn=0-940450-58-5 }}(Letter to Julia Dent April 24, 1847)&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Image:Battle Cerro Gordo.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Battle of Cerro Gordo]] (1847)]]
Xalapeños such as Ambrosio Alcalde and Antonio García fought bravely to defend the city of Veracruz, but were taken prisoner. They were released and paroled, but after rejoining the fighting against the US, they were recaptured near [[Teocelo]], taken to Xalapa, sentenced to death and executed on 24 November 1847.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt; Today these two men are remembered as martyrs. An obelisk commemorates their sacrifice, between San Jose Church and Alcalde Market, named for Ambrosio Alcalde.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt; US forces marched on to capture Mexico City and departed after the [[Mexican–American War#Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo|Treaty of Guadaloupe Hidalgo]].

In November 1862 Xalapa was attacked in the French invasion; foreigners temporarily took control of the state capital. On 27 November 1867 the corpse of emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]], who had been executed in [[Querétaro]], arrived and was held in San José, attended by the priest José María y Daza, then transferred to Veracruz the following day. The remains were shipped back to [[Austria]] for burial.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt;

In 1885 General [[Juan de la Luz Enríquez]] increased the influence of Xalapa when he moved some legislative authority from Orizaba to Xalapa, in accordance with a decree issued in June 1884 by provisional Governor [[Juan Manuel Fernández de Jáuregui]]. Enríquez and Swiss teacher {{ILL|Enrique C. Rébsamen|es}} in 1886 founded the Normal School in Xalapa, the first school of this type in the country.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt; [[Image:Juan de la Luz Enríquez.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Governor [[Juan de la Luz Enríquez]] (1836–1892) for whom the city is named.]] Enríquez died in 1892, but the construction of the Normal School and founding of its other schools led to Xalapa becoming known as a center of learning, the “Athens of Veracruz”.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt;

Under Enríquez, the old San Francisco convent was demolished, and the area developed into Parque Juárez. In June 1890 railroad construction brought the first locomotive on the Xalapa--[[Coatepec, Veracruz|Coatepec]]-[[Teocelo]] railroad to the city{{clarify|date=July 2017}}. The [[Interoceanic Railway of Mexico|interoceanic railroad]] was completed in Veracruz in 1901.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt; The public lighting system was introduced in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;See [[William K. Boone]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906 a clock was installed in the centre of the city on a building on Enríquez Street, which now houses the National Lottery agency.

On 18 May 1911, [[Francisco I. Madero]] visited Xalapa. On 21 June of the same year a minor conflict occurred between federal forces and revolutionaries.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt;

On 3 January 1920, a strong earthquake rattled the city, destroying several buildings. Years later in December 1923, Xalapa fell into the power of the [[huertístas]], commanded by Guadalupe Sánchez.&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt;

In 1940 the water building and agricultural house were constructed, today is occupied by the Agrarian League of Communities and Union Farmers of the State. On 11 September 1944 the [[Universidad de Veracruzana]] was established, and Dr. Manuel Suárez became its first director. On 4 September 1978, by decree number 325, the Local Legislature declared that the official name of Xalapa Enríquez should be written with a “X” rather than a "J", to emphasize its derivation from [[Nahuatl]].&lt;ref name="MX"/&gt;

Xalapa is a thriving center for commerce and many multinational companies have large retail stores and franchise restaurants in the city. These include [[Wal-Mart]], [[Superama]], [[Sam's Club]], [[The Home Depot]], [[Liverpool (store)|Liverpool]], [[Sears]], [[Costco]], [[Office Depot]], [[Office Max]], [[Oxxo]], [[Sanborns]], [[Comercial Mexicana]], [[C&amp;A]], Fabricas de Francia, Coppel, Garcia, Milano, [[McDonald's]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Pizza Hut]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]], [[Starbucks]], [[Kentucky Fried Chicken]], [[Little Caesars]], [[Hugo Boss]], [[Pull and Bear]], and [[Carl's Jr.]], [[Prada]], [[Tous Designer House|Tous]], etc.

Xalapa also has a number of cinemas, some of them of substantial size, such as the [[Cinepolis]] Museum (10 screens), Cinepolis the Americas (16 screens), and other cinemas, such as XTreme Cinemas in Crystal and Cinetix in Plaza Animas, which is a local movie theater. There are also several retail malls in Xalapa: Plaza Crystal, Plaza Museo, Plaza Animas (L.A. Fashion), Plaza Américas, and Plaza los Arcos.

Many people in Xalapa are employed by the government, since it is the state capital. Xalapa is also the head one of the five regional sections of the Tribunal Electoral (a level below the Supreme Court). This area encompasses 7 states: [[Campeche (state)|Campeche]], [[Chiapas (state)|Chiapas]], [[Oaxaca (state)|Oaxaca]], [[Quintana Roo (state)|Quintana Roo]],  [[Tabasco (state)|Tabasco]], [[Veracruz (state)|Veracruz]] and [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]. The other regional seats are [[Mexico City]], [[Toluca]], [[Monterrey]] and [[Guadalajara]].

==Culture==
[[Image:CabezaColosal1 MuseoXalapa.jpg|thumb|right|Giant [[Olmec]] head, a mark of the indigenous civilizations of Xalapa.]]

Xalapa is known as the "Athens of Veracruz" because of the strong cultural influence of its major university, [[Universidad Veracruzana]] (the main public university in the State of Veracruz). General Enriquez is known for policies encouraging the educational system in Xalapa.

Culturally, Xalapa has a wide variety of events associated with its theatres, museums, and street art. Many musicians and dancers frequently perform in the center in the nights, especially on special occasions and events of celebration or commemoration; they often dance the [[fandango]].

Art has a keen following in Xalapa. The gallery, ''[[Pinacoteca Diego Rivera]],'' located near the City Hall and [[Parque Juárez]] in downtown, has the most numerous collection of [[Diego Rivera]]'s paintings in all of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Florecita"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/student/abroad/summer/xalapa.html |title=Xalapa, Mexico:History |publisher=[[University of Texas]], [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] |accessdate=14 October 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423103759/http://www.utexas.edu/student/abroad/summer/xalapa.html |archivedate=23 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holidays===
Feast day of San José, Feast of Santiago Apostle, Feast of the Immaculate Heart of Jesus, Conception of Maria, and Expo-Fair International are all celebrated in the city. An important religious holiday is on 8 December, the Feast of the Immaculate Conception, celebrating Mary the Mother of God patroness of the city. On 24 October [[San Rafael Guizar]] and Valencia are celebrated, with thousands of people from all over Mexico visiting their tomb that is in a chapel within the cathedral. The cathedral remains open all night and day during this event.

===Cuisine===
Xalapa is the place of origin of the famous [[Jalapeño]] peppers.&lt;ref name="MXGast"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xalapa:Gastronomía |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/veracruz/municipios/30087a.htm |work=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México |publisher=Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |accessdate=13 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517094230/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/veracruz/municipios/30087a.htm |archivedate=17 May 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dishes made with maize: [[gordita]]s, [[Tostada (tortilla)|tostada]]s, [[Pasty|pasties]], [[Enchilada#Varieties|enfrijoladas]], and chicken are common. The desserts that are consumed in the region are typically sweet such as cake and [[cocodas]] and craft candies like [[candied fruit]], [[dulce de leche]] and jamoncillo.

:Of the original printing, L de G wrote in ''Revue des Pyrënëes,'' Volume 11, 1899:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What will be appreciated above all is the considerable labor and the wisdom that [his work] has needed. It will be, in any case, a precious document to consult by all who are interested in our old ''Langue d'oc'' in its many local dialects."&lt;ref&gt;Translated from the French [https://books.google.com/books?id=T3k5AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA721&amp;dq=Emile+Mazuc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwicwozHzMfcAhVMYK0KHWHYAykQ6AEIUDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Emile%20Mazuc&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
